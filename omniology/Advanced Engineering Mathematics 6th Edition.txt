In courses such as calculus or differential equations, the content is fairly standardized 
but the content of a course entitled engineering mathematics often varies considerably 
between two different academic institutions. Therefore a text entitled Advanced Engi-
neering Mathematics is a compendium of many mathematical topics, all of which are 
loosely related by the expedient of either being needed or useful in courses in science and 
engineering or in subsequent careers in these areas. There is literally no upper bound to 
the number of topics that could be included in a text such as this. Consequently, this book 
represents the author’s opinion of what constitutes engineering mathematics.

For flexibility in topic selection this text is divided into five major parts. As can be seen 
from the titles of these various parts it should be obvious that it is my belief that the 
backbone of science/engineering related mathematics is the theory and applications of 
ordinary and partial differential equations.
Part 1: Ordinary Differential Equations (Chapters 1–6)
The six chapters in Part 1 constitute a complete short course in ordinary differential equa-
tions. These chapters, with some modifications, correspond to Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, and 9 in the text A First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications, 
Eleventh Edition, by Dennis G. Zill (Cengage Learning). In Chapter 2 the focus is on 
methods for solving first-order differential equations and their applications. Chapter 3 
deals mainly with linear second-order differential equations and their applications. Chap-
ter 4 is devoted to the solution of differential equations and systems of differential equa-
tions by the important Laplace transform.
Part 2: Vectors, Matrices, and Vector Calculus (Chapters 7–9)
Chapter 7, Vectors, and Chapter 9, Vector Calculus, include the standard topics that are 
usually covered in the third semester of a calculus sequence: vectors in 2- and 3-space, 
vector functions, directional derivatives, line integrals, double and triple integrals, surface 
integrals, Green’s theorem, Stokes’ theorem, and the divergence theorem. In Section 7.6 
the vector concept is generalized; by defining vectors analytically we lose their geometric 
interpretation but keep many of their properties in n-dimensional and infinite-dimensional 
vector spaces. Chapter 8, Matrices, is an introduction to systems of algebraic equations, 
determinants, and matrix algebra, with special emphasis on those types of matrices that

are useful in solving systems of linear differential equations. Optional sections on cryp-
tography, error correcting codes, the method of least squares, and discrete compartmental 
models are presented as applications of matrix algebra.
Part 3: Systems of Differential Equations (Chapters 10 and 11)
There are two chapters in Part 3. Chapter 10, Systems of Linear Differential Equations, 
and Chapter 11, Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations, draw heavily on the matrix 
material presented in Chapter 8 of Part 2. In Chapter 10, systems of linear first-order 
equations are solved utilizing the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonaliza-
tion, and by means of a matrix exponential function. In Chapter 11, qualitative aspects of 
autonomous linear and nonlinear systems are considered in depth.
Part 4: Partial Differential Equations (Chapters 12–16)
The core material on Fourier series and boundary-value problems involving second-order 
partial differential equations was originally drawn from the text Differential Equations with 
Boundary-Value Problems, Ninth Edition, by Dennis G. Zill (Cengage Learning). In Chapter 
12, Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series, the fundamental topics of sets of orthogonal 
functions and expansions of functions in terms of an infinite series of orthogonal functions 
are presented. These topics are then utilized in Chapters 13 and 14 where boundary-value 
problems in rectangular, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates are solved using the 
method of separation of variables. In Chapter 15, Integral Transform Method, boundary-
value problems are solved by means of the Laplace and Fourier integral transforms.
Part 5: Complex Analysis (Chapters 17–20)
The final four chapters of the hardbound text cover topics ranging from the basic complex 
number system through applications of conformal mappings in the solution of Dirichlet’s prob-
lem. This material by itself could easily serve as a one quarter introductory course in complex 
variables. This material was taken from Complex Analysis: A First Course with  Applications, 
Third Edition, by Dennis G. Zill and Patrick D. Shanahan (Jones & Bartlett Learning).
Additional Online Material: Probability and Statistics (Chapters 21 and 22)
These final two chapters cover the basic rudiments of probability and statistics and can  obtained 
as either a PDF download on the accompanying Student Companion Website and Projects 
Center or as part of a custom publication. For more information on how to access these addi-
tional chapters, please contact your Account Specialist at go.jblearning.com/findmyrep.
 Design of the Text
For the benefit of those instructors and students who have not used the preceding edition, 
a word about the design of the text is in order. Each chapter opens with its own table of 
contents and a brief introduction to the material covered in that chapter. Because of the 
great number of figures, definitions, and theorems throughout this text, I use a double-
decimal numeration system. For example, the interpretation of “Figure 1.2.3” is
 
Chapter Section of Chapter 1
 
T T
 
1.2.3 d Third figure in Section 1.2
I think that this kind of numeration makes it easier to find, say, a theorem or figure when it is 
referred to in a later section or chapter. In addition, to better link a figure with the text, the first 

 
Preface xiii
textual reference to each figure is done in the same font style and color as the figure number. 
For example, the first reference to the second figure in Section 5.7 is given as FIGURE 5.7.2 and 
all subsequent references to that figure are written in the tradition style Figure 5.7.2.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Differential Equations
1.1 
Definitions and Terminology
INTRODUCTION The words differential and equation certainly suggest solving some kind 
of equation that contains derivatives. But before you start solving anything, you must learn some 
of the basic defintions and terminology of the subject.
 A Definition The derivative dy/dx of a function y  f(x) is itself another function f(x) 
found by an appropriate rule. For example, the function y  e0.1x2 is differentiable on the interval 
(q, q), and its derivative is dy/dx  0.2xe0.1x2. If we replace e0.1x2 in the last equation by the 
symbol y, we obtain
 
dy
dx  0.2xy. 
(1)
Now imagine that a friend of yours simply hands you the differential equation in (1), and that 
you have no idea how it was constructed. Your friend asks: “What is the function represented by 
the symbol y?” You are now face-to-face with one of the basic problems in a course in differen-
tial equations:
How do you solve such an equation for the unknown function y  f(x)?
The problem is loosely equivalent to the familiar reverse problem of differential calculus: Given 
a derivative, find an antiderivative.
Before proceeding any further, let us give a more precise definition of the concept of a dif-
ferential equation.
In order to talk about them, we will classify a differential equation by type, order, and linearity.
 Classification by Type If a differential equation contains only ordinary derivatives of 
one or more functions with respect to a single independent variable it is said to be an ordinary 
differential equation (ODE). An equation involving only partial derivatives of one or more 
functions of two or more independent variables is called a partial differential equation (PDE). 
Our first example illustrates several of each type of differential equation.

are examples of partial differential equations. Notice in the third equation that there are two 
dependent variables and two independent variables in the PDE. This indicates that u and v 
must be functions of two or more independent variables.
Definition 1.1.1 
Differential Equation
An equation containing the derivatives of one or more dependent variables, with respect to 
one or more independent variables, is said to be a differential equation (DE).

1.1 Definitions and Terminology

 Notation Throughout this text, ordinary derivatives will be written using either the Leibniz 
notation dy/dx, d 2y/dx 2, d 3y/dx 3, … , or the prime notation y, y , y , … . Using the latter nota-
tion, the first two differential equations in (2) can be written a little more compactly as 
y  6y  ex and y   y  12y  0, respectively. Actually, the prime notation is used to denote 
only the first three derivatives; the fourth derivative is written y(4) instead of y . In general, the 
nth derivative is d ny/dx n or y(n). Although less convenient to write and to typeset, the Leibniz 
notation has an advantage over the prime notation in that it clearly displays both the dependent 
and independent variables. For example, in the differential equation d 2x/dt 2  16x  0, it is im-
mediately seen that the symbol x now represents a dependent variable, whereas the independent 
variable is t. You should also be aware that in physical sciences and engineering, Newton’s dot 
notation (derogatively referred to by some as the “flyspeck” notation) is sometimes used to 
denote derivatives with respect to time t. Thus the differential equation d 2s/dt 2  32 becomes 
s$  32. Partial derivatives are often denoted by a subscript notation indicating the indepen-
dent variables. For example, the first and second equations in (3) can be written, in turn, as 
uxx  uyy  0 and uxx  utt  ut.
 Classification by Order The order of a differential equation (ODE or PDE) is the 
order of the highest derivative in the equation.

are examples of a second-order ordinary differential equation and a fourth-order partial dif-
ferential equation, respectively.
A first-order ordinary differential equation is sometimes written in the differential form
 
M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  0.
EXAMPLE 3 
Differential Form of a First-Order ODE
If we assume that y is the dependent variable in a first-order ODE, then recall from calculus 
that the differential dy is defined to be dy  y9dx.
(a) By dividing by the differential dx an alternative form of the equation (y 2 x) dx 1 
4x dy  0 is given by
 
y 2 x  4x dy
dx  0 or equivalently 4x dy
dx  y  x.
(b) By multiplying the differential equation
6xy dy
dx  x2  y2  0
by dx we see that the equation has the alternative differential form
 
(x2  y2) dx  6xy dy  0.
In symbols, we can express an nth-order ordinary differential equation in one dependent vari-
able by the general form
 
F(x, y, y, … , y(n) )  0, 
(4)
where F is a real-valued function of n  2 variables: x, y, y, … , y(n). For both practical and 
theoretical reasons, we shall also make the assumption hereafter that it is possible to solve an

ordinary differential equation in the form (4) uniquely for the highest derivative y(n) in terms of 
the remaining n  1 variables. The differential equation

(5)
where f is a real-valued continuous function, is referred to as the normal form of (4). Thus, when 
it suits our purposes, we shall use the normal forms

(b) By solving for the derivative y0 the normal form of the second-order differential 
equation
 
y  y  6y  0 is y  y  6y.
 Classification by Linearity An nth-order ordinary differential equation (4) is said to 
be linear in the variable y if F is linear in y, y, … , y(n). This means that an nth-order ODE is 
linear when (4) is an(x)y

Two important special cases of (6) are linear first-order (n  1) and linear second-order
(n  2) ODEs.

dx  a0(x)y  g(x) and a2(x) d
 2y
dx2  a1(x) dy
dx  a0(x)y  g(x). 
(7)
In the additive combination on the left-hand side of (6) we see that the characteristic two proper-
ties of a linear ODE are
•  The dependent variable y and all its derivatives y, y, … , y(n) are of the first degree; that 
is, the power of each term involving y is 1.
•  The coefficients a0, a1, … , an of y, y, … , y(n) depend at most on the independent 
variable x.
A nonlinear ordinary differential equation is simply one that is not linear. If the coefficients 
of y, y, … , y(n) contain the dependent variable y or its derivatives or if powers of y, y, … , 
y(n), such as (y)2, appear in the equation, then the DE is nonlinear. Also, nonlinear functions 
of the dependent variable or its derivatives, such as sin y or ey cannot appear in a linear 
 equation.

dx 3  3x dy
dx 2 5y  e x
are, in turn, examples of linear first-, second-, and third-order ordinary differential equations. 
We have just demonstrated in part (a) of Example 3 that the first equation is linear in y by 
writing it in the alternative form 4xy  y  x.
Remember these two 
characteristics of a 
linear ODE.

are examples of nonlinear first-, second-, and fourth-order ordinary differential equations, 
respectively.
 Solution As stated before, one of our goals in this course is to solve—or find solutions 
of—differential equations. The concept of a solution of an ordinary differential equation is 
defined next.
Definition 1.1.2 
Solution of an ODE
Any function f, defined on an interval I and possessing at least n derivatives that are con-
tinuous on I, which when substituted into an nth-order ordinary differential equation reduces 
the equation to an identity, is said to be a solution of the equation on the interval.
In other words, a solution of an nth-order ordinary differential equation (4) is a function f
that possesses at least n derivatives and
 
F(x, f(x), f(x), … , f(n)(x))  0 for all x in I.
We say that f satisfies the differential equation on I. For our purposes, we shall also assume that 
a solution f is a real-valued function. In our initial discussion we have already seen that y  e0.1x2
is a solution of dy/dx  0.2xy on the interval (q, q).
Occasionally it will be convenient to denote a solution by the alternative symbol y(x).
 Interval of Definition You can’t think solution of an ordinary differential equation 
without simultaneously thinking interval. The interval I in Definition 1.1.2 is variously called 
the interval of definition, the interval of validity, or the domain of the solution and can be an 
open interval (a, b), a closed interval [a, b], an infinite interval (a, q), and so on.
EXAMPLE 6 
Verification of a Solution
Verify that the indicated function is a solution of the given differential equation on the interval 
(q, q).
(a) dy
dx  xy1>2; y  1
16 x4 
(b) y  2y  y  0; y  xex
SOLUTION One way of verifying that the given function is a solution is to see, after substi-
tuting, whether each side of the equation is the same for every x in the interval (q, q).
(a) From 
left-hand side: dy
dx  4 x3
16  x3
4
 
  
right-hand side: xy1>2  x a x4
16b
1>2
 x x2
4  x3
4 ,
we see that each side of the equation is the same for every real number x. Note that y1/2  1
4x2 is, 
by definition, the nonnegative square root of 1
16 x4.
(b) From the derivatives y  xex + ex and y  xex  2ex we have for every real number x,
 
left-hand side: y  2y  y  (xex  2ex)  2(xex  ex)  xex  0
 
right-hand side: 0.
Note, too, that in Example 6 each differential equation possesses the constant solution y  0, 
defined on (q, q). A solution of a differential equation that is identically zero on an interval 
I is said to be a trivial solution.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Differential Equations
 Solution Curve The graph of a solution f of an ODE is called a solution curve. Since 
f is a differentiable function, it is continuous on its interval I of definition. Thus there may be a 
difference between the graph of the function f and the graph of the solution f. Put another way, 
the domain of the function f does not need to be the same as the interval I of definition (or 
 domain) of the solution f.
EXAMPLE 7 
Function vs. Solution
(a) Considered simply as a function, the domain of y  1/x is the set of all real numbers x
except 0. When we graph y  1/x, we plot points in the xy-plane corresponding to a judicious 
sampling of numbers taken from its domain. The rational function y  1/x is discontinuous 
at 0, and its graph, in a neighborhood of the origin, is given in FIGURE 1.1.1(a). The function 
y  1/x is not differentiable at x  0 since the y-axis (whose equation is x  0) is a vertical 
asymptote of the graph.
(b) Now y  1/x is also a solution of the linear first-order differential equation xy  y  0 
(verify). But when we say y  1/x is a solution of this DE we mean it is a function defined on 
an interval I on which it is differentiable and satisfies the equation. In other words, 
y  1/x is a solution of the DE on any interval not containing 0, such as (3, 1), ( 1
2, 10), 
(q, 0), or (0, q). Because the solution curves defined by y  1/x on the intervals (3, 1) 
and on (1
2, 10) are simply segments or pieces of the solution curves defined by 
y  1/x on (q, 0) and (0, q), respectively, it makes sense to take the interval I to be as large 
as possible. Thus we would take I to be either (q, 0) or (0, q). The solution curve on the 
interval (0, q) is shown in Figure 1.1.1(b).
 Explicit and Implicit Solutions You should be familiar with the terms explicit and 
implicit functions from your study of calculus. A solution in which the dependent variable is 
expressed solely in terms of the independent variable and constants is said to be an explicit solution. 
For our purposes, let us think of an explicit solution as an explicit formula y  f(x) that we can 
manipulate, evaluate, and differentiate using the standard rules. We have just seen in the last two 
examples that y  1
16 x 4, y  xex, and y  1/x are, in turn, explicit solutions of dy/dx  xy1/2, 
y   2y  y  0, and xy  y  0. Moreover, the trivial solution y  0 is an explicit solution 
of all three equations. We shall see when we get down to the business of actually solving some 
ordinary differential equations that methods of solution do not always lead directly to an explicit 
solution y  f(x). This is particularly true when attempting to solve nonlinear first-order dif-
ferential equations. Often we have to be content with a relation or expression G(x, y)  0 that 
defines a solution f implicitly.
Definition 1.1.3 
Implicit Solution of an ODE
A relation G(x, y)  0 is said to be an implicit solution of an ordinary differential equation (4) 
on an interval I provided there exists at least one function f that satisfies the relation as well 
as the differential equation on I.
It is beyond the scope of this course to investigate the conditions under which a relation 
G(x, y)  0 defines a differentiable function f. So we shall assume that if the formal implementa-
tion of a method of solution leads to a relation G(x, y)  0, then there exists at least one function 
f that satisfies both the relation (that is, G(x, f(x))  0) and the differential equation on an in-
terval I. If the implicit solution G(x, y)  0 is fairly simple, we may be able to solve for y in terms 
of x and obtain one or more explicit solutions. See (iv) in the Remarks.

explicit solutions defined on the interval (5, 5). The solution curves given in FIGURE 1.1.2(b)

Any relation of the form x2  y2  c  0 formally satisfies (8) for any constant c. However, 
it is understood that the relation should always make sense in the real number system; thus, for 
example, we cannot say that x2  y2  25  0 is an implicit solution of the equation. Why not?
Because the distinction between an explicit solution and an implicit solution should be intui-
tively clear, we will not belabor the issue by always saying, “Here is an explicit (implicit) 
solution.”
 Families of Solutions The study of differential equations is similar to that of integral 
calculus. When evaluating an antiderivative or indefinite integral in calculus, we use a single constant 
c of integration. Analogously, when solving a first-order differential equation F(x, y, y)  0, we 
usually obtain a solution containing a single arbitrary constant or parameter c. A solution contain-
ing an arbitrary constant represents a set G(x, y, c)  0 of solutions called a one-parameter 
family of solutions. When solving an nth-order differential equation F(x, y, y, … , y(n))  0, we 
seek an n-parameter family of solutions G(x, y, c1, c2, … , cn)  0. This means that a single 
differential equation can possess an infinite number of solutions corresponding to the unlim-
ited number of choices for the parameter(s). A solution of a differential equation that is free 
of arbitrary parameters is called a particular solution. For example, the one-parameter family 
y  cx  x cos x is an explicit solution of the linear first-order equation xy  y  x2 sin x on the 
interval (q, q) (verify). FIGURE 1.1.3, obtained using graphing software, shows the graphs of 
some of the solutions in this family. The solution y  x cos x, the red curve in the figure, is a 
particular solution corresponding to c  0. Similarly, on the interval (q, q), y  c1e x  c2xe x 
is a two-parameter family of solutions (verify) of the linear second-order equation y   2y  y  0 
in part (b) of Example 6. Some particular solutions of the equation are the trivial solution 
y  0 (c1  c2  0), y  xex (c1  0, c2  1), y  5e x  2xe x (c1  5, c2  2), and so on.
In all the preceding examples, we have used x and y to denote the independent and dependent 
variables, respectively. But you should become accustomed to seeing and working with other 
symbols to denote these variables. For example, we could denote the independent variable by t 
and the dependent variable by x.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Differential Equations
For x  c1 cos 4t, the first two derivatives with respect to t are x  4c1 sin 4t and 
x  16c1 cos 4t. Substituting x and x then gives
 
x  16x  16c1 cos 4t  16(c1 cos 4t)  0.
In like manner, for x  c2 sin 4t we have x  16c2 sin 4t, and so
 
x  16x  16c2 sin 4t  16(c2 sin 4t)  0.
Finally, it is straightforward to verify that the linear combination of solutions for the two-
parameter family x  c1 cos 4t  c2 sin 4t is also a solution of the differential equation.
The next example shows that a solution of a differential equation can be a piecewise-defined 
function.
EXAMPLE 10 
A Piecewise-Defined Solution
You should verify that the one-parameter family y  cx4 is a one-parameter family of solutions 
of the linear differential equation xy  4y  0 on the interval (q, q). See FIGURE 1.1.4(a). 
The piecewise-defined differentiable function
 
y  ex4,
x , 0
    x4,
x $ 0
is a particular solution of the equation but cannot be obtained from the family y  cx4 by a 
single choice of c; the solution is constructed from the family by choosing c  1 for x 	 0 
and c  1 for x  0. See Figure 1.1.4(b).
 Singular Solution Sometimes a differential equation possesses a solution that is not a 
member of a family of solutions of the equation; that is, a solution that cannot be obtained by 
specializing any of the parameters in the family of solutions. Such an extra solution is called a 
singular solution. For example, we have seen that y  1
16x4 and y  0 are solutions of the dif-
ferential equation dy/dx  xy1/2 on (q, q). In Section 2.2 we shall demonstrate, by actually 
solving it, that the differential equation dy/dx  xy1/2 possesses the one-parameter family of 
solutions y  (1
4x2  c)2, c  0. When c  0, the resulting particular solution is y  1
16x4. But 
notice that the trivial solution y  0 is a singular solution since it is not a member of the family 
y  (1
4x2  c)2; there is no way of assigning a value to the constant c to obtain y  0.
 Systems of Differential Equations Up to this point we have been discussing sin-
gle differential equations containing one unknown function. But often in theory, as well as in 
many applications, we must deal with systems of differential equations. A system of ordinary 
differential equations is two or more equations involving the derivatives of two or more unknown 
functions of a single independent variable. For example, if x and y denote dependent variables 
and t the independent variable, then a system of two first-order differential equations is given by
 
 dx
dt  f (t, x, y)
 
 dy
dt  g(t, x, y). 
(10)
A solution of a system such as (10) is a pair of differentiable functions x  f1(t), y  f2(t) 
defined on a common interval I that satisfy each equation of the system on this interval. See 
Problems 41 and 42 in Exercises 1.1.

REMARKS
(i) It might not be apparent whether a first-order ODE written in differential form M(x, y) dx 
N(x, y) dy  0 is linear or nonlinear because there is nothing in this form that tells us which 
symbol denotes the dependent variable. See Problems 9 and 10 in Exercises 1.1.
(ii) We will see in the chapters that follow that a solution of a differential equation may involve 
an integral-defined function. One way of defining a function F of a single variable x by

means of a definite integral is
 
F(x)  #
x
a
g(t) dt. 
(11)
If the integrand g in (11) is continuous on an interval [a, b] and a  x  b, then the derivative 
form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that F is differentiable on (a, b) and
 
F9(x)  d

a
g(t) dt  g(x). 
(12)
The integral in (11) is often nonelementary, that is, an integral of a function g that does 
not have an elementary-function antiderivative. Elementary functions include the familiar 
functions studied in a typical precalculus course:
constant, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse 
trigonometric functions,
as well as rational powers of these functions, finite combinations of these functions using 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and function compositions. For example, even 
though et 2, "1  t 3, and cos t2 are elementary functions, the integrals eet 2 dt, e"1  t 3 dt, 
and ecos t 2 dt are nonelementary. See Problems 25–28 in Exercises 1.1.
(iii) Although the concept of a solution of a differential equation has been emphasized in this 
section, you should be aware that a DE does not necessarily have to possess a solution. See 
Problem 43 in Exercises 1.1. The question of whether a solution exists will be touched on in 
the next section.
(iv) A few last words about implicit solutions of differential equations are in order. In Example 8 
we were able to solve the relation x2  y2  25 for y in terms of x to get two explicit solutions, 
f1(x)  "25 2 x2 and f2(x)  "25 2 x2, of the differential equation (8). But don’t 
read too much into this one example. Unless it is easy, obvious, or important, or you are in-
structed to, there is usually no need to try to solve an implicit solution G(x, y)  0 for y ex-
plicitly in terms of x. Also do not misinterpret the second sentence following Definition 1.1.3. 
An implicit solution G(x, y)  0 can define a perfectly good differentiable function f that is 
a solution of a DE, but yet we may not be able to solve G(x, y)  0 using analytical methods 
such as algebra. The solution curve of f may be a segment or piece of the graph of G(x, y)  0. 
See Problems 49 and 50 in Exercises 1.1. 
(v) If every solution of an nth-order ODE F(x, y, y, … , y(n))  0 on an interval I can be obtained 
from an n-parameter family G(x, y, c1, c2, … , cn)  0 by appropriate choices of the parameters 
ci, i  1, 2, … , n, we then say that the family is the general solution of the DE. In solving 
linear ODEs, we shall impose relatively simple restrictions on the coefficients of the equation; 
with these restrictions one can be assured that not only does a solution exist on an interval but 
also that a family of solutions yields all possible solutions. Nonlinear equations, with the 
exception of some first-order DEs, are usually difficult or even impossible to solve in terms 
of familiar elementary functions. Furthermore, if we happen to obtain a family of solutions 
for a nonlinear equation, it is not evident whether this family contains all solutions. On a 
practical level, then, the designation “general solution” is applied only to linear DEs. Don’t 
be concerned about this concept at this point but store the words general solution in the back 
of your mind—we will come back to this notion in Section 2.3 and again in Chapter 3.
In Problems 1–8,  state the order of the given ordinary 
differential equation. Determine whether the equation is linear 
or nonlinear by matching it with (6).

ear differential equation y  2y  4y  5 sin t has a solution 
of the form y  A sin t  B cos t, where A and B are constants.

In Problems 49 and 50, the given figure represents the graph

defines several solutions of the DE. Carefully reproduce each 
figure on a piece of paper. Use different colored pencils to mark 
off segments, or pieces, on each graph that correspond to graphs 
of solutions. Keep in mind that a solution f must be a function 
and differentiable. Use the solution curve to estimate the 
interval I of definition of each solution f.

the DE in Problem 51 help in finding points on the graph of

knowing where a tangent line is vertical help in determining 
an interval I of definition of a solution f of the DE? Carry out 
your ideas and compare with your estimates of the intervals in 
Problem 50.
 53. In Example 8, the largest interval I over which the explicit

 57. The normal form (5) of an nth-order differential equation 
is equivalent to (4) whenever both forms have exactly the 
same solutions. Make up a first-order differential equation

parameters c1 and c2.
Qualitative information about a solution y  f(x) of a 
differential equation can often be obtained from the equation 
itself. Before working Problems 59–62, recall the geometric 
significance of the derivatives dy/dx and d 2y/dx2.

function on any interval of the x-axis.
(b) What are lim
xS 2qdy/dx and lim
xSqdy/dx? What does this 
suggest about a solution curve as x S 
q?
(c) Determine an interval over which a solution curve is concave 
down and an interval over which the curve is concave up.
(d) Sketch the graph of a solution y  f(x) of the differential 
equation whose shape is suggested by parts (a)–(c).
 60. Consider the differential equation dy/dx  5  y.
(a) Either by inspection, or by the method suggested in 
Problems 37–40, find a constant solution of the DE.
(b) Using only the differential equation, find intervals on the 
y-axis on which a nonconstant solution y  f(x) is in-

Initial-Value Problems
INTRODUCTION We are often interested in problems in which we seek a solution y(x) of a 
differential equation so that y(x) satisfies prescribed side conditions—that is, conditions that are 
imposed on the unknown y(x) or on its derivatives. In this section we examine one such problem 
called an initial-value problem.
 Initial-Value Problem On some interval I containing x0, the problem
 
Solve: 
d
 n
 y
dxn  f (x, y, y9, p  , y(n21))
 
(1)
 
Subject to: 
y(x0)  y0, y9(x0)  y1, p  , y(n21)(x0)  yn21,
where y0, y1, … , yn1 are arbitrarily specified real constants, is called an initial-value problem (IVP). 
The values of y(x) and its first n1 derivatives at a single point x0: y(x0)  y0, y(x0)  y1, … , 
y(n1)(x0)  yn1, are called initial conditions (IC).
 First- and Second-Order IVPs The problem given in (1) is also called an nth-order 
initial-value problem. For example,
 
Solve: 
dy
dx  f (x, y)
 
Subject to: y(x0)  y0 
(2)
and 
Solve: 
d 2y
dx2  f (x, y, y9)
 
Subject to: y(x0)  y0, y9(x0)  y1 
(3)
are first- and second-order initial-value problems, respectively. These two problems are easy 
to interpret in geometric terms. For (2) we are seeking a solution of the differential equation on 
an interval I containing x0 so that a solution curve passes through the prescribed point (x0, y0). 
See FIGURE 1.2.1. For (3) we want to find a solution of the differential equation whose graph not 
only passes through (x0, y0) but passes through so that the slope of the curve at this point is y1. 
See FIGURE 1.2.2. The term initial condition derives from physical systems where the independent 
variable is time t and where y(t0)  y0 and y(t0)  y1 represent, respectively, the position and 
velocity of an object at some beginning, or initial, time t0.
Solving an nth-order initial-value problem frequently entails using an n-parameter family of 
solutions of the given differential equation to find n specialized constants so that the resulting 
particular solution of the equation also “fits”—that is, satisfies—the n initial conditions.

EXAMPLE 1 
First-Order IVPs
(a) It is readily verified that y  cex is a one-parameter family of solutions of the simple 
first-order equation y  y on the interval (q, q). If we specify an initial condition, say, 
y(0)  3, then substituting x  0, y  3 in the family determines the constant 3  ce0  c. 
Thus the function y  3ex is a solution of the initial-value problem
 
y  y, y(0)  3.
(b) Now if we demand that a solution of the differential equation pass through the point 
(1, 2) rather than (0, 3), then y(1)  2 will yield 2  ce or c  2e1. The function
y  2e x1 is a solution of the initial-value problem
 
y  y, y(1)  2.
The graphs of these two solutions are shown in blue in FIGURE 1.2.3.
The next example illustrates another first-order initial-value problem. In this example, notice 
how the interval I of definition of the solution y(x) depends on the initial condition y(x0)  y0.
EXAMPLE 2 
Interval I of Definition of a Solution
In Problem 6 of Exercises 2.2 you will be asked to show that a one-parameter family of solutions 
of the first-order differential equation y  2xy2  0 is y  1/(x2  c). If we impose the initial 
condition y(0)  1, then substituting x  0 and y  1 into the family of solutions gives 
1  1/c or c  1. Thus, y  1/(x2  1). We now emphasize the following three distinctions.
•  Considered as a function, the domain of y  1/(x2  1) is the set of real numbers x for 
which y(x) is defined; this is the set of all real numbers except x  1 and 
x  1. See FIGURE 1.2.4(a).
•  Considered as a solution of the differential equation y  2xy2  0, the interval I 
of definition of y  1/(x2  1) could be taken to be any interval over which y(x) is 
defined and differentiable. As can be seen in Figure 1.2.4(a), the largest intervals on which 
y  1/(x2  1) is a solution are (q, 1), (1, 1), and (1, q).
•  Considered as a solution of the initial-value problem y  2xy2  0, y(0)  1, the interval 
I of definition of y  1/(x2  1) could be taken to be any interval over which y(x) is defined, 
differentiable, and contains the initial point x  0; the largest interval for which this is true 
is (–1, 1). See Figure 1.2.4(b).
See Problems 3–6 in Exercises 1.2 for a continuation of Example 2.
EXAMPLE 3 
Second-Order IVP
In Example 9 of Section 1.1 we saw that x  c1 cos 4t  c2 sin 4t is a two-parameter family 
of solutions of x  16x  0. Find a solution of the initial-value problem
 
x0  16x  0, x(p/2)  2, x(p/2)  1. 
(4)
SOLUTION  We first apply x(p/2)  2 to the given family of solutions: c1 cos 2p  c2 sin 2p 
2. Since cos 2p  1 and sin 2p  0, we find that c1  2. We next apply x(p/2)  1 to 
the one-parameter family x(t)  2 cos 4t  c2 sin 4t. Differentiating and then setting 
t  p/2 and x  1 gives 8 sin 2p  4c2 cos 2p  1, from which we see that c2  1
4. Hence 
x  2 cos 4t  1
4 sin 4t is a solution of (4).
 Existence and Uniqueness Two fundamental questions arise in considering an initial-
value problem:
Does a solution of the problem exist? If a solution exists, is it unique?
For a first-order initial-value problem such as (2), we ask:
Existence 
  Does the differential equation dy/dx  f (x, y) possess solutions?
Do any of the solution curves pass through the point (x0, y0)?
Uniqueness 
  When can we be certain that there is precisely one solution curve passing through 
the point (x0, y0)?

CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Differential Equations
Note that in Examples 1 and 3, the phrase “a solution” is used rather than “the solution” of the 
problem. The indefinite article “a” is used deliberately to suggest the possibility that other solu-
tions may exist. At this point it has not been demonstrated that there is a single solution of each 
problem. The next example illustrates an initial-value problem with two solutions.
EXAMPLE 4 
An IVP Can Have Several Solutions
Each of the functions y  0 and y  1
16x4 satisfies the differential equation dy/dx  xy1/2 and 
the initial condition y(0)  0, and so the initial-value problem dy/dx  xy1/2, y(0)  0, has at 
least two solutions. As illustrated in FIGURE 1.2.5, the graphs of both functions pass through 
the same point (0, 0).
Within the safe confines of a formal course in differential equations one can be fairly con-
fident that most differential equations will have solutions and that solutions of initial-value 
problems will probably be unique. Real life, however, is not so idyllic. Thus it is desirable to 
know in advance of trying to solve an initial-value problem whether a solution exists and, when 
it does, whether it is the only solution of the problem. Since we are going to consider first-
order differential equations in the next two chapters, we state here without proof a straight-
forward theorem that gives conditions that are sufficient to guarantee the existence and 
uniqueness of a solution of a first-order initial-value problem of the form given in (2). We 
shall wait until Chapter 3 to address the question of existence and uniqueness of a second-order 
initial-value problem.
Theorem 1.2.1 
Existence of a Unique Solution
Let R be a rectangular region in the xy-plane defined by a  x  b, c  y  d, that contains 
the point (x0, y0) in its interior. If f (x, y) and f/y are continuous on R, then there exists some 
interval I0: (x0  h, x0  h), h  0, contained in [a, b], and a unique function y(x) defined on 
I0 that is a solution of the initial-value problem (2).
The foregoing result is one of the most popular existence and uniqueness theorems for first-
order differential equations, because the criteria of continuity of f (x, y) and f/y are relatively 
easy to check. The geometry of Theorem 1.2.1 is illustrated in FIGURE 1.2.6.
EXAMPLE 5 
Example 4 Revisited
We saw in Example 4 that the differential equation dy/dx  xy1/2 possesses at least two solu-
tions whose graphs pass through (0, 0). Inspection of the functions
f ( x, y)  xy1>2 and 
0f
0y 
x
2y1>2
shows that they are continuous in the upper half-plane defined by y  0. Hence Theorem 1.2.1 
enables us to conclude that through any point (x0, y0), y0  0, in the upper half-plane there 
is some interval centered at x0 on which the given differential equation has a unique 
solution. Thus, for example, even without solving it we know that there exists some 
interval centered at 2 on which the initial-value problem dy/dx  xy1/2, y(2)  1, has a 
unique solution.
In Example 1, Theorem 1.2.1 guarantees that there are no other solutions of the initial-value 
problems y  y, y(0)  3, and y  y, y(1)  2, other than y  3e x and y  2e x–1, respec-
tively. This follows from the fact that f (x, y)  y and f/y  1 are continuous throughout the 
entire xy-plane. It can be further shown that the interval I on which each solution is defined 
is (–q, q).
 Interval of Existence/Uniqueness Suppose y(x) represents a solution of the 
initial-value problem (2). The following three sets on the real x-axis may not be the same: 
the domain of the function y(x), the interval I over which the solution y(x) is defined or ex-
ists, and the interval I0 of existence and uniqueness. In Example 7 of Section 1.1 we illustrated 
FIGURE 1.2.5 Two solutions of the same

1.2 Initial-Value Problems

the difference between the domain of a function and the interval I of definition. Now suppose 
(x0, y0) is a point in the interior of the rectangular region R in Theorem 1.2.1. It turns out that the 
continuity of the function f (x, y) on R by itself is sufficient to guarantee the existence of at least 
one solution of dy/dx  f (x, y), y(x0) = y0, defined on some interval I. The interval I of definition 
for this initial-value problem is usually taken to be the largest interval containing x0 over which 
the solution y(x) is defined and differentiable. The interval I depends on both f (x, y) and the 
initial condition y(x0)  y0. See Problems 31–34 in Exercises 1.2. The extra condition of continu-
ity of the first partial derivative f/y on R enables us to say that not only does a solution exist 
on some interval I0 containing x0, but it also is the only solution satisfying y(x0)  y0. However, 
Theorem 1.2.1 does not give any indication of the sizes of the intervals I and I0; the interval I of 
definition need not be as wide as the region R and the interval I0 of existence and uniqueness 
may not be as large as I. The number h  0 that defines the interval I0: (x0  h, x0  h), could 
be very small, and so it is best to think that the solution y(x) is unique in a local sense, that is, a 
solution defined near the point (x0, y0). See Problem 50 in Exercises 1.2.

REMARKS
(i) The conditions in Theorem 1.2.1 are sufficient but not necessary. When f (x, y) and f/y 
are continuous on a rectangular region R, it must always follow that a solution of (2) exists 
and is unique whenever (x0, y0) is a point interior to R. However, if the conditions stated 
in the hypotheses of Theorem 1.2.1 do not hold, then anything could happen: Problem (2) 
may still have a solution and this solution may be unique, or (2) may have several solutions, 
or it may have no solution at all. A rereading of Example 4 reveals that the hypotheses of 
Theorem 1.2.1 do not hold on the line y  0 for the differential equation dy/dx  xy1/2, and 
so it is not surprising, as we saw in Example 4 of this section, that there are two solutions 
defined on a common interval (h, h) satisfying y(0)  0. On the other hand, the hypotheses 
of Theorem 1.2.1 do not hold on the line y  1 for the differential equation dy/dx  | y  1|. 
Nevertheless, it can be proved that the solution of the initial-value problem dy/dx  | y  1|, 
y(0)  1, is unique. Can you guess this solution?

Differential Equations as Mathematical Models
INTRODUCTION In this section we introduce the notion of a mathematical model. Roughly 
speaking, a mathematical model is a mathematical description of something. This description could 
be as simple as a function. For example, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was able to deduce the 
speed v of a falling body by a examining a sequence. Leonardo allowed water drops to fall, at equally 
spaced intervals of time, between two boards covered with blotting paper. When a spring mechanism 
was disengaged, the boards were clapped together. See FIGURE 1.3.1. By carefully examining the 
sequence of water blots, Leonardo discovered that the distances between consecutive drops increased 
in “a continuous arithmetic proportion.” In this manner he discovered the formula v  gt.
Although there are many kinds of mathematical models, in this section we focus only on dif-
ferential equations and discuss some specific differential-equation models in biology, physics, 
and chemistry. Once we have studied some methods for solving DEs, in Chapters 2 and 3 we 
return to, and solve, some of these models.
 Mathematical Models It is often desirable to describe the behavior of some real-life 
system or phenomenon, whether physical, sociological, or even economic, in mathematical terms. 
The mathematical description of a system or a phenomenon is called a mathematical model and 
is constructed with certain goals in mind. For example, we may wish to understand the mecha-
nisms of a certain ecosystem by studying the growth of animal populations in that system, or we 
may wish to date fossils by means of analyzing the decay of a radioactive substance either in the 
fossil or in the stratum in which it was discovered.
Construction of a mathematical model of a system starts with identification of the variables that 
are responsible for changing the system. We may choose not to incorporate all these variables into 
the model at first. In this first step we are specifying the level of resolution of the model. Next, 
FIGURE 1.3.1 Da Vinci’s apparatus for 
 determining the speed of falling body

20 
| CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Differential Equations
we make a set of reasonable assumptions or hypotheses about the system we are trying to describe. 
These assumptions will also include any empirical laws that may be applicable to the system.
For some purposes it may be perfectly within reason to be content with low-resolution models. 
For example, you may already be aware that in modeling the motion of a body falling near the surface 
of the Earth, the retarding force of air friction, is sometimes ignored in beginning physics courses; 
but if you are a scientist whose job it is to accurately predict the flight path of a long-range projectile, 
air resistance and other factors such as the curvature of the Earth have to be taken into account.
Since the assumptions made about a system frequently involve a rate of change of one or more 
of the variables, the mathematical depiction of all these assumptions may be one or more equa-
tions involving derivatives. In other words, the mathematical model may be a differential equation 
or a system of differential equations.
Once we have formulated a mathematical model that is either a differential equation or a 
system of differential equations, we are faced with the not insignificant problem of trying to solve 
it. If we can solve it, then we deem the model to be reasonable if its solution is consistent with 
either experimental data or known facts about the behavior of the system. But if the predictions 
produced by the solution are poor, we can either increase the level of resolution of the model or 
make alternative assumptions about the mechanisms for change in the system. The steps of the 
modeling process are then repeated as shown in FIGURE 1.3.2.

FIGURE 1.3.2 Steps in the modeling process
Of course, by increasing the resolution we add to the complexity of the mathematical model and 
increase the likelihood that we cannot obtain an explicit solution.
A mathematical model of a physical system will often involve the variable time t. A solution of 
the model then gives the state of the system; in other words, for appropriate values of t, the values 
of the dependent variable (or variables) describe the system in the past, present, and future.
 Population Dynamics One of the earliest attempts to model human population growth 
by means of mathematics was by the English economist Thomas Malthus (1776–1834) in 1798. 
Basically, the idea of the Malthusian model is the assumption that the rate at which a population 
of a country grows at a certain time is proportional* to the total population of the country at that 
time. In other words, the more people there are at time t, the more there are going to be in the 
future. In mathematical terms, if P(t) denotes the total population at time t, then this assumption 
can be expressed as
 
dP
dt r P or 
dP
dt  kP, 
(1)
where k is a constant of proportionality. This simple model, which fails to take into account many 
factors (immigration and emigration, for example) that can influence human populations to either 
grow or decline, nevertheless turned out to be fairly accurate in predicting the population of the 
United States during the years 1790–1860. Populations that grow at a rate described by (1) are 
rare; nevertheless, (1) is still used to model growth of small populations over short intervals of 
time, for example, bacteria growing in a petri dish.
*If two quantities u and v are proportional, we write u ~ v. This means one quantity is a constant multiple 
of the other: u  kv.

1.3 Differential Equations as Mathematical Models 
| 21
 Radioactive Decay The nucleus of an atom consists of combinations of protons and 
neutrons. Many of these combinations of protons and neutrons are unstable; that is, the atoms 
decay or transmute into the atoms of another substance. Such nuclei are said to be radioactive. 
For example, over time, the highly radioactive radium, Ra-226, transmutes into the radioactive 
gas radon, Rn-222. In modeling the phenomenon of radioactive decay, it is assumed that the 
rate dA/dt at which the nuclei of a substance decays is proportional to the amount (more precisely, 
the number of nuclei) A(t) of the substance remaining at time t:
 
dA
dt r A  or 
dA
dt  kA. 
(2)
Of course equations (1) and (2) are exactly the same; the difference is only in the interpretation 
of the symbols and the constants of proportionality. For growth, as we expect in (1), k  0, and 
in the case of (2) and decay, k 	 0.
The model (1) for growth can be seen as the equation dS/dt  rS, which describes the growth of 
capital S when an annual rate of interest r is compounded continuously. The model (2) for decay also 
occurs in a biological setting, such as determining the half-life of a drug—the time that it takes for 
50% of a drug to be eliminated from a body by excretion or metabolism. In chemistry, the decay 
model (2) appears as the mathematical description of a first-order chemical reaction. The point is this:
A single differential equation can serve as a mathematical model for many different 
 phenomena.
Mathematical models are often accompanied by certain side conditions. For example, in (1) 
and (2) we would expect to know, in turn, an initial population P0 and an initial amount of radio-
active substance A0 that is on hand. If this initial point in time is taken to be t  0, then we know 
that P(0)  P0 and A(0)  A0. In other words, a mathematical model can consist of either an initial-
value problem or, as we shall see later in Section 3.9, a boundary-value problem.
 Newton’s Law of Cooling/Warming According to Newton’s empirical law of 
cooling—or warming—the rate at which the temperature of a body changes is proportional to the 
difference between the temperature of the body and the temperature of the surrounding medium, 
the so-called ambient temperature. If T(t) represents the temperature of a body at time t, Tm the 
temperature of the surrounding medium, and dT/dt the rate at which the temperature of the body 
changes, then Newton’s law of cooling/warming translates into the mathematical statement
 
dT
dt r T 2 Tm or 
dT
dt  k(T 2 Tm), 
(3)
where k is a constant of proportionality. In either case, cooling or warming, if Tm is a constant, 
it stands to reason that k 	 0.
 Spread of a Disease A contagious disease—for example, a flu virus—is spread through-
out a community by people coming into contact with other people. Let x(t) denote the number 
of people who have contracted the disease and y(t) the number of people who have not yet been 
exposed. It seems reasonable to assume that the rate dx/dt at which the disease spreads is pro-
portional to the number of encounters or interactions between these two groups of people. If we 
assume that the number of interactions is jointly proportional to x(t) and y(t), that is, proportional 
to the product xy, then
 
dx
dt  kxy, 
(4)
where k is the usual constant of proportionality. Suppose a small community has a fixed population 
of n people. If one infected person is introduced into this community, then it could be argued that x(t) 
and y(t) are related by x  y  n  1. Using this last equation to eliminate y in (4) gives us the model
 
dx
dt  kx(n  1 2 x). 
(5)
An obvious initial condition accompanying equation (5) is x(0)  1.
 Chemical Reactions The disintegration of a radioactive substance, governed by the 
differential equation (2), is said to be a first-order reaction. In chemistry, a few reactions follow 
this same empirical law: If the molecules of substance A decompose into smaller molecules, it 

22 
| CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Differential Equations
is a natural assumption that the rate at which this decomposition takes place is proportional to 
the amount of the first substance that has not undergone conversion; that is, if X(t) is the amount 
of substance A remaining at any time, then dX/dt  kX, where k is a negative constant since X is 
decreasing. An example of a first-order chemical reaction is the conversion of t-butyl chloride 
into t-butyl alcohol:
 
(CH3)3CCl  NaOH S (CH3)3COH  NaCl.
Only the concentration of the t-butyl chloride controls the rate of reaction. But in the reaction
 
CH3Cl  NaOH S CH3OH  NaCl,
for every molecule of methyl chloride, one molecule of sodium hydroxide is consumed, thus 
forming one molecule of methyl alcohol and one molecule of sodium chloride. In this case the 
rate at which the reaction proceeds is proportional to the product of the remaining concentrations 
of CH3Cl and of NaOH. If X denotes the amount of CH3OH formed and a and b are the given 
amounts of the first two chemicals A and B, then the instantaneous amounts not converted to 
chemical C are a  X and b  X, respectively. Hence the rate of formation of C is given by
 
dX
dt  k(a 2 X)(b 2 X), 
(6)
where k is a constant of proportionality. A reaction whose model is equation (6) is said to be 
second order.
 Mixtures The mixing of two salt solutions of differing concentrations gives rise to a first-
order differential equation for the amount of salt contained in the mixture. Let us suppose that a 
large mixing tank initially holds 300 gallons of brine (that is, water in which a certain number 
of pounds of salt has been dissolved). Another brine solution is pumped into the large tank at a 
rate of 3 gallons per minute; the concentration of the salt in this inflow is 2 pounds of salt per 
gallon. When the solution in the tank is well stirred, it is pumped out at the same rate as the enter-
ing solution. See FIGURE 1.3.3. If A(t) denotes the amount of salt (measured in pounds) in the tank 
at time t, then the rate at which A(t) changes is a net rate:
 
dA
dt  ainput rate
of salt b 2 aoutput rate
of salt
b  Rin 2 Rout. 
(7)
The input rate Rin at which the salt enters the tank is the product of the inflow concentration of 
salt and the inflow rate of fluid. Note that Rin is measured in pounds per minute:

Rin  (2 lb/gal)  (3 gal/min)  (6 lb/min).
Now, since the solution is being pumped out of the tank at the same rate that it is pumped in, the 
number of gallons of brine in the tank at time t is a constant 300 gallons. Hence the concentration 
of the salt in the tank, as well as in the outflow, is c(t)  A(t)/300 lb/gal, and so the output rate 
Rout of salt is

If rin and rout denote general input and output rates of the brine solutions,* respectively, then 
there are three possibilities: rin  rout , rin  rout , and rin 	 rout . In the analysis leading to (8) we

have assumed that rin  rout . In the latter two cases, the number of gallons of brine in the tank is 
either increasing (rin  rout) or decreasing (rin 	 rout) at the net rate rin  rout . See Problems 10–12 
in Exercises 1.3.
 Draining a Tank In hydrodynamics, Torricelli’s law states that the speed v of efflux of 
water through a sharp-edged hole at the bottom of a tank filled to a depth h is the same as the 
speed that a body (in this case a drop of water) would acquire in falling freely from a height h; 
that is, v  !2gh, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. This last expression comes from 
equating the kinetic energy 1
2 mv2 with the potential energy mgh and solving for v. Suppose a tank 
filled with water is allowed to drain through a hole under the influence of gravity. We would like 
to find the depth h of water remaining in the tank at time t. Consider the tank shown in FIGURE 1.3.4. 
If the area of the hole is Ah (in ft2) and the speed of the water leaving the tank is v  !2gh 
(in ft/s), then the volume of water leaving the tank per second is Ah!2gh (in ft3/s). Thus if V(t) 
denotes the volume of water in the tank at time t,
 
dV
dt  Ah!2gh, 
(9)
where the minus sign indicates that V is decreasing. Note here that we are ignoring the possibil-
ity of friction at the hole that might cause a reduction of the rate of flow there. Now if the tank 
is such that the volume of water in it at time t can be written V(t)  Aw h, where Aw (in ft2) is the 
constant area of the upper surface of the water (see Figure 1.3.4), then dV/dt  Awdh/dt. Substituting 
this last expression into (9) gives us the desired differential equation for the height of the water 
at time t:
 
dh
dt   Ah
Aw
!2gh. 
(10)
It is interesting to note that (10) remains valid even when Aw is not constant. In this case we must 
express the upper surface area of the water as a function of h; that is, Aw  A(h). See Problem 14 
in Exercises 1.3.
 Series Circuits Consider the single-loop LRC-series circuit containing an inductor, resis-
tor, and capacitor shown in FIGURE 1.3.5(a). The current in a circuit after a switch is closed is denoted 
by i(t); the charge on a capacitor at time t is denoted by q(t). The letters L, R, and C are known 
as inductance, resistance, and capacitance, respectively, and are generally constants. Now ac-
cording to Kirchhoff’s second law, the impressed voltage E(t) on a closed loop must equal the 
sum of the voltage drops in the loop. Figure 1.3.5(b) also shows the symbols and the formulas 
for the respective voltage drops across an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor. Since current i(t) 
is related to charge q(t) on the capacitor by i  dq/dt, by adding the three voltage drops

and equating the sum to the impressed voltage, we obtain a second-order differential equation
 
 L d 2q

(11)
We will examine a differential equation analogous to (11) in great detail in Section 3.8.
 Falling Bodies In constructing a mathematical model of the motion of a body moving 
in a force field, one often starts with Newton’s second law of motion. Recall from elementary 
physics that Newton’s first law of motion states that a body will either remain at rest or will 
continue to move with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. In each case 
this is equivalent to saying that when the sum of the forces F  Fk —that is, the net or resul-
tant force—acting on the body is zero, then the acceleration a of the body is zero. Newton’s 
second law of motion indicates that when the net force acting on a body is not zero, then the 
net force is proportional to its acceleration a, or more precisely, F  ma, where m is the mass 
of the body.

Now suppose a rock is tossed upward from a roof of a building as illustrated in FIGURE 1.3.6. 
What is the position s(t) of the rock relative to the ground at time t ? The acceleration of the rock 
is the second derivative d 2s/dt 2. If we assume that the upward direction is positive and that no 
force acts on the rock other than the force of gravity, then Newton’s second law gives
 
m d
 2s
dt
 2  mg  or  
d

 2  g. 
(12)
In other words, the net force is simply the weight F  F1  W of the rock near the surface of 
the Earth. Recall that the magnitude of the weight is W  mg, where m is the mass of the body 
and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The minus sign in (12) is used because the weight of the 
rock is a force directed downward, which is opposite to the positive direction. If the height of the 
building is s0 and the initial velocity of the rock is v0, then s is determined from the second-order 
initial-value problem
 
d 2s
dt
 2  g, 
s(0)  s0, 
s9(0)  v0. 
(13)
Although we have not stressed solutions of the equations we have constructed, we note that (13) 
can be solved by integrating the constant g twice with respect to t. The initial conditions de-
termine the two constants of integration. You might recognize the solution of (13) from elemen-
tary physics as the formula s(t)  1
2 gt 2  v0 t  s0.
 Falling Bodies and Air Resistance Prior to the famous experiment by Italian 
mathematician and physicist Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, it 
was generally believed that heavier objects in free fall, such as a cannonball, fell with a greater 
acceleration than lighter objects, such as a feather. Obviously a cannonball and a feather, when 
dropped simultaneously from the same height, do fall at different rates, but it is not because a 
cannonball is heavier. The difference in rates is due to air resistance. The resistive force of air 
was ignored in the model given in (13). Under some circumstances a falling body of mass 
m—such as a feather with low density and irregular shape—encounters air resistance propor-
tional to its instantaneous velocity v. If we take, in this circumstance, the positive direction to 
be oriented downward, then the net force acting on the mass is given by F  F1  F2  mg  kv, 
where the weight F1  mg of the body is a force acting in the positive direction and air resis-
tance F2  kv is a force, called viscous damping, or drag, acting in the opposite or upward 
direction. See FIGURE 1.3.7. Now since v is related to acceleration a by a  dv/dt, Newton’s second 
law becomes F  ma  m dv/dt. By equating the net force to this form of Newton’s second law, 
we obtain a first-order differential equation for the velocity v(t) of the body at time t,
 
 m dv
dt  mg 2 kv. 
(14)
Here k is a positive constant of proportionality called the drag coefficient. If s(t) is the distance 
the body falls in time t from its initial point of release, then v  ds/dt and a  dv/dt  d  2s/dt 2. 
In terms of s, (14) is a second-order differential equation

 Suspended Cables Suppose a flexible cable, wire, or heavy rope is suspended between 
two vertical supports. Physical examples of this could be a long telephone wire strung between 
two posts as shown in red in FIGURE 1.3.8(a), or one of the two cables supporting the roadbed of a 
suspension bridge shown in red in Figure 1.3.8(b). Our goal is to construct a mathematical model 
that describes the shape that such a cable assumes.
To begin, let’s agree to examine only a portion or element of the cable between its lowest point 
P1 and any arbitrary point P2. As drawn in blue in FIGURE 1.3.9, this element of the cable is the 
curve in a rectangular coordinate system with the y-axis chosen to pass through the lowest point 
P1 on the curve and the x-axis chosen a units below P1. Three forces are acting on the cable: the 
tensions T1 and T2 in the cable that are tangent to the cable at P1 and P2, respectively, and the 
portion W of the total vertical load between the points P1 and P2. Let T1  | T1 |, 
T2  | T2 |, and W  | W | denote the magnitudes of these vectors. Now the tension T2 resolves

into horizontal and vertical components (scalar quantities) T2 cos u and T2 sin u. Because of static 
equilibrium, we can write
 
T1  T2 cos u and 
W  T2 sin u.
By dividing the last equation by the first, we eliminate T2 and get tan u  W/T1. But since 
dy/dx  tan u, we arrive at

(16)
This simple first-order differential equation serves as a model for both the shape of a flexible wire 
such as a telephone wire hanging under its own weight as well as the shape of the cables that 
support the roadbed. We will come back to equation (16) in Exercises 2.2 and in Section 3.11.
REMARKS
Each example in this section has described a dynamical system: a system that changes or evolves 
with the flow of time t. Since the study of dynamical systems is a branch of mathematics currently 
in vogue, we shall occasionally relate the terminology of that field to the discussion at hand.
In more precise terms, a dynamical system consists of a set of time-dependent variables, 
called state variables, together with a rule that enables us to determine (without ambiguity) the 
state of the system (this may be past, present, or future states) in terms of a state prescribed 
at some time t0. Dynamical systems are classified as either discrete-time systems or continuous-time 
systems. In this course we shall be concerned only with continuous-time dynamical systems—
systems in which all variables are defined over a continuous range of time. The rule or the 
mathematical model in a continuous-time dynamical system is a differential equation or a system 
of differential equations. The state of the system at a time t is the value of the state variables at 
that time; the specified state of the system at a time t0 is simply the initial conditions that ac-
company the mathematical model. The solution of the initial-value problem is referred to as the 
response of the system. For example, in the preceding case of radioactive decay, the rule is 
dA/dt  kA. Now if the quantity of a radioactive substance at some time t0 is known, say 
A(t0)  A0, then by solving the rule, the response of the system for t  t0 is found to be 
A(t)  A0et2t0 (see Section 2.7). The response A(t) is the single-state variable for this  system. 
In the case of the rock tossed from the roof of the building, the response of the system, the solu-
tion of the differential equation d 2s/dt  2  g subject to the initial state s(0)  s0, s(0)  v0, is 
the function s(t)  1
2gt  2  v0t  s0, 0  t  T, where the symbol T represents the time when 
the rock hits the ground. The state variables are s(t) and s(t), which are, respectively, the vertical 
position of the rock above ground and its velocity at time t. The acceleration s(t) is not a state 
variable since we only have to know any initial position and initial velocity at a time t0 to uniquely 
determine the rock’s position s(t) and velocity s(t)  v(t) for any time in the interval [t0, T ]. The 
acceleration s(t)  a(t) is, of course, given by the differential equation s(t)  g, 0 	 t 	 T.
One last point: Not every system studied in this text is a dynamical system. We shall also 
examine some static systems in which the model is a differential equation.
Population Dynamics
 1. Under the same assumptions underlying the model in (1), de-
termine a differential equation governing the growing popula-
tion P(t) of a country when individuals are allowed to immigrate 
into the country at a constant rate r 
 0. What is the differen-
tial equation for the population P(t) of the country when indi-
viduals are allowed to emigrate at a constant rate r 
 0?
 2. The population model given in (1) fails to take death into 
consideration; the growth rate equals the birth rate. In another 
model of a changing population of a community, it is assumed 
that the rate at which the population changes is a net rate—that 
is, the difference between the rate of births and the rate of 
deaths in the community. Determine a model for the popula-
tion P(t) if both the birth rate and the death rate are proportional

Spread of a Disease/Technology
 7. Suppose a student carrying a flu virus returns to an isolated 
college campus of 1000 students. Determine a differential 
equation governing the number of students x(t) who have con-
tracted the flu if the rate at which the disease spreads is pro-
portional to the number of interactions between the number 
of students with the flu and the number of students who have 
not yet been exposed to it.
 8. At a time t  0, a technological innovation is introduced into 
a community with a fixed population of n people. Determine 
a differential equation governing the number of people x(t) 
who have adopted the innovation at time t if it is assumed that 
the rate at which the innovation spreads through the commu-
nity is jointly proportional to the number of people who have 
adopted it and the number of people who have not adopted it.
Mixtures
 9. Suppose that a large mixing tank initially holds 300 gallons 
of water in which 50 pounds of salt has been dissolved. Pure 
water is pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 gal/min, and when 
the solution is well stirred, it is pumped out at the same rate. 
Determine a differential equation for the amount A(t) of salt 
in the tank at time t. What is A(0)?
 10. Suppose that a large mixing tank initially holds 300 gallons 
of water in which 50 pounds of salt has been dissolved. 
Another brine solution is pumped into the tank at a rate of 3 
gal/min, and when the solution is well stirred, it is pumped 
out at a slower rate of 2 gal/min. If the concentration of the 
solution entering is 2 lb/gal, determine a differential equation 
for the amount A(t) of salt in the tank at time t.
 11. What is the differential equation in Problem 10 if the well-
stirred solution is pumped out at a faster rate of 3.5 gal/min?
 12. Generalize the model given in (8) of this section by assuming 
that the large tank initially contains N0 number of gallons of brine, 
rin and rout are the input and output rates of the brine, respectively 
(measured in gallons per minute), cin is the concentration of the 
salt in the inflow, c(t) is the concentration of the salt in the tank 
as well as in the outflow at time t (measured in pounds of salt 
per gallon), and A(t) is the amount of salt in the tank at time t.
Draining a Tank
 13. Suppose water is leaking from a tank through a circular hole of 
area Ah at its bottom. When water leaks through a hole, friction 
and contraction of the stream near the hole reduce the volume 
of the water leaving the tank per second to cAh"2gh, where 
c (0 	 c 	 1) is an empirical constant. Determine a differential 
equation for the height h of water at time t for the cubical tank 
in FIGURE 1.3.12. The radius of the hole is 2 in and g  32 ft/s2.

shown in FIGURE 1.3.16 falling before the parachute is opened—

Newton’s Second Law and Archimedes’ Principle
 18. A cylindrical barrel s ft in diameter of weight w lb is floating 
in water as shown in FIGURE 1.3.17(a). After an initial depres-
sion, the barrel exhibits an up-and-down bobbing motion along 
a vertical line. Using Figure 1.3.17(b), determine a differential 
equation for the vertical displacement y(t) if the origin is taken 
to be on the vertical axis at the surface of the water when the 
barrel is at rest. Use Archimedes’ principle: Buoyancy, or 
upward force of the water on the barrel, is equal to the weight 
of the water displaced. Assume that the downward direction 
is positive, that the weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft3, and 
that there is no resistance between the barrel and the water.

Newton’s Second Law and Hooke’s Law
 19. After a mass m is attached to a spring, it stretches s units and 
then hangs at rest in the equilibrium position as shown in 
FIGURE 1.3.18(b). After the spring/mass system has been set in 
motion, let x(t) denote the directed distance of the mass beyond 
the equilibrium position. As indicated in Figure 1.3.18(c), as-
sume that the downward direction is positive, that the motion 
takes place in a vertical straight line through the center of 
gravity of the mass, and that the only forces acting on the 
system are the weight of the mass and the restoring force of 
the stretched spring. Use Hooke’s law: The restoring force of 
a spring is proportional to its total elongation. Determine a 
differential equation for the displacement x(t) at time t.

ment x(t) if the motion takes place in a medium that imparts 
a damping force on the spring/mass system that is proportional 
to the instantaneous velocity of the mass and acts in a direction 
opposite to that of motion?
Newton’s Second Law and Variable Mass
When the mass m of a body moving through a force field is variable, 
Newton’s second law of motion takes on the form: If the net force 
acting on a body is not zero, then the net force F is equal to the 
time rate of change of momentum of the body. That is,
 
F  d
dt (mv)*, 
(17)
where mv is momentum. Use this formulation of Newton’s second 
law in Problems 21 and 22.
*Note that when m is constant, this is the same as F  ma.

 21. Consider a single-stage rocket that is launched vertically up-
ward as shown in the accompanying photo. Let m(t) denote 
the total mass of the rocket at time t (which is the sum of three 
masses: the constant mass of the payload, the constant mass 
of the vehicle, and the variable amount of fuel). Assume that 
the positive direction is upward, air resistance is proportional 
to the instantaneous velocity v of the rocket, and R is the upward 
thrust or force generated by the propulsion system. Use (17) 
to find a mathematical model for the velocity v(t) of the rocket.

 22. In Problem 21, suppose m(t)  mp  mv  mf (t) where mp is 
constant mass of the payload, mv is the constant mass of the 
vehicle, and mf (t) is the variable amount of fuel. 
(a) Show that the rate at which the total mass of the rocket 
changes is the same as the rate at which the mass of the 
fuel changes.
(b) If the rocket consumes its fuel at a constant rate l, find 
m(t). Then rewrite the differential equation in Problem 
21 in terms of l and the initial total mass m(0)  m0.
(c) Under the assumption in part (b), show that the burnout 
time tb  0 of the rocket, or the time at which all the fuel 
is consumed, is tb  mf (0)/l, where mf (0) is the initial 
mass of the fuel.
Newton’s Second Law and the Law of Universal 
Gravitation
 23. By Newton’s law of universal gravitation, the free-fall accel-
eration a of a body, such as the satellite shown in FIGURE 1.3.19, 
falling a great distance to the surface is not the constant g. Rather, 
the acceleration a is inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance from the center of the Earth, a  k/r2, where k is the 
constant of proportionality. Use the fact that at the surface of 
the Earth r  R and a  g to determine k. If the positive direc-
tion is upward, use Newton’s second law and his universal law 
of gravitation to find a differential equation for the distance r.

Additional Mathematical Models
 25. Learning Theory In the theory of learning, the rate at which a 
subject is memorized is assumed to be proportional to the amount 
that is left to be memorized. Suppose M denotes the total amount 
of a subject to be memorized and A(t) is the amount memorized 
in time t. Determine a differential equation for the amount A(t).
 26. Forgetfulness In Problem 25, assume that the rate at which 
material is forgotten is proportional to the amount memorized 
in time t. Determine a differential equation for A(t) when for-
getfulness is taken into account.
 27. Infusion of a Drug A drug is infused into a patient’s blood-
stream at a constant rate of r grams per second. Simultaneously, 
the drug is removed at a rate proportional to the amount x(t) 
of the drug present at time t. Determine a differential equation 
governing the amount x(t).
 28. Tractrix A motorboat starts at the origin and moves in the 
direction of the positive x-axis, pulling a waterskier along a 
curve C called a tractrix. See FIGURE 1.3.21. The waterskier, 
initially located on the y-axis at the point (0, s), is pulled by 
keeping a rope of constant length s, which is kept taut through-
out the motion. At time t . 0 the waterskier is at the point 
P(x, y). Find the differential equation of the path of motion C.

parallel to the x-axis striking the surface are reflected to a single 
point O (the origin). Use the fact that the angle of incidence is 
equal to the angle of reflection to determine a differential equa-
tion that describes the shape of the curve C. Such a curve C is

Discussion Problems
 30. Reread Problem 45 in Exercises 1.1 and then give an explicit 
solution P(t) for equation (1). Find a one-parameter family of 
solutions of (1).
 31. Reread the sentence following equation (3) and assume that 
Tm is a positive constant. Discuss why we would expect 
k  0 in (3) in both cases of cooling and warming. You might 
start by interpreting, say, T(t)  Tm in a graphical manner.
 32. Reread the discussion leading up to equation (8). If we assume 
that initially the tank holds, say, 50 lbs of salt, it stands to reason 
that since salt is being added to the tank continuously for t  0, 
that A(t) should be an increasing function. Discuss how you 
might determine from the DE, without actually solving it, the 
number of pounds of salt in the tank after a long period of time.
 33. Population Model The differential equation dP/dt  (k cos t)P, 
where k is a positive constant, is a model of human population 
P(t) of a certain community. Discuss an interpretation for the 
solution of this equation; in other words, what kind of popu-
lation do you think the differential equation describes?
 34. Rotating Fluid As shown in FIGURE 1.3.23(a), a right-circular 
cylinder partially filled with fluid is rotated with a constant 
angular velocity v about a vertical y-axis through its center. The 
rotating fluid is a surface of revolution S. To identify S we first 
establish a coordinate system consisting of a vertical plane de-
termined by the y-axis and an x-axis drawn perpendicular to the 
y-axis such that the point of intersection of the axes (the origin) 
is located at the lowest point on the surface S. We then seek a 
function y  f (x), which represents the curve C of intersection 
of the surface S and the vertical coordinate plane. Let the point 
P(x, y) denote the position of a particle of the rotating fluid of 
mass m in the coordinate plane. See Figure 1.3.23(b).
(a) At P, there is a reaction force of magnitude F due to the 
other particles of the fluid, which is normal to the surface S. 
By Newton’s second law the magnitude of the net force 
acting on the particle is mv2x. What is this force? Use Figure 
1.3.23(b) to discuss the nature and origin of the equations
F cos u  mg,  F sin u  mv2x.
(b) Use part (a) to find a first-order differential equation that 
defines the function y  f (x).

 35. Falling Body In Problem 23, suppose r  R  s, where s is 
the distance from the surface of the Earth to the falling body. 
What does the differential equation obtained in Problem 23 
become when s is very small compared to R?
 36. Raindrops Keep Falling In meteorology, the term virga refers 
to falling raindrops or ice particles that evaporate before they 
reach the ground. Assume that a typical raindrop is spherical 
in shape. Starting at some time, which we can designate as 
t  0, the raindrop of radius r0 falls from rest from a cloud 
and begins to evaporate.
(a) If it is assumed that a raindrop evaporates in such a manner 
that its shape remains spherical, then it also makes sense to 
assume that the rate at which the raindrop evaporates—that 
is, the rate at which it loses mass—is proportional to its 
surface area. Show that this latter assumption implies that 
the rate at which the radius r of the raindrop decreases is 
a constant. Find r(t). [Hint: See Problem 55 in Exercises 1.1.]
(b) If the positive direction is downward, construct a math-
ematical model for the velocity v of the falling raindrop 
at time t. Ignore air resistance. [Hint: Use the form of 
Newton’s second law as given in (17).]
 37. Let It Snow The “snowplow problem” is a classic and appears 
in many differential equations texts but was probably made 
famous by Ralph Palmer Agnew:
“One day it started snowing at a heavy and steady rate. A 
snowplow started out at noon, going 2 miles the first hour 
and 1 mile the second hour. What time did it start snowing?”
 
 If possible, find the text Differential Equations, Ralph Palmer 
Agnew, McGraw-Hill, and then discuss the construction and 
solution of the mathematical model.

We begin our study of differential 
equations with first-order 
equations. In this chapter we 
illustrate the three different ways 
differential equations can be 
studied: qualitatively, 
analytically, and numerically.
In Section 2.1 we examine DEs 
qualitatively. We shall see that a 
DE can often tell us information 
about the behavior of its 
solutions even if you do not 
have any solutions in hand. In 
Sections 2.2–2.5 we examine DEs 
analytically. This means we study 
specialized techniques for 
obtaining implicit and explicit 
solutions. In Sections 2.7 and 2.8 
we apply these solution methods 
to some of the mathematical 
models that were discussed in 
Section 1.3. Then in Section 2.6 
we discuss a simple technique for 
“solving” a DE numerically. This 
means, in contrast to the 
analytical approach where 
solutions are equations or 
formulas, that we use the DE to 
construct a way of obta ining 
quantitative information about an 
unknown solution.
The chapter ends with an 
introduction to mathematical 
modeling with systems of first-
order differential equations.

2.1 
Solution Curves Without a Solution
INTRODUCTION Some differential equations do not possess any solutions. For example, 
there is no real function that satisfies (y)2  1  0. Some differential equations possess solutions 
that can be found analytically, that is, solutions in explicit or implicit form found by implement-
ing an equation-specific method of solution. These solution methods may involve certain ma-
nipulations, such as a substitution, and procedures, such as integration. Some differential 
equations possess solutions but the differential equation cannot be solved analytically. In other 
words, when we say that a solution of a DE exists, we do not mean that there also exists a method 
of solution that will produce explicit or implicit solutions. Over a time span of centuries, math-
ematicians have devised ingenious procedures for solving some very specialized equations, so 
there are, not surprisingly, a large number of differential equations that can be solved analytically. 
Although we shall study some of these methods of solution for first-order equations in the sub-
sequent sections of this chapter, let us imagine for the moment that we have in front of us a 
first-order differential equation in normal form dy/dx  f (x, y), and let us further imagine that 
we can neither find nor invent a method for solving it analytically. This is not as bad a predica-
ment as one might think, since the differential equation itself can sometimes “tell” us specifics 
about how its solutions “behave.” We have seen in Section 1.2 that whenever f (x, y) and 0f/0y 
satisfy certain continuity conditions, qualitative questions about existence and uniqueness of 
solutions can be answered. In this section we shall see that other qualitative questions about 
properties of solutions—such as, How does a solution behave near a certain point? or, How does 
a solution behave as x S q?—can often be answered when the function f depends solely on the 
variable y.
We begin our study of first-order differential equations with two ways of analyzing a DE 
qualitatively. Both these ways enable us to determine, in an approximate sense, what a solution 
curve must look like without actually solving the equation.
2.1.1 Direction Fields
 Slope We begin with a simple concept from calculus: A derivative dy/dx of a differen-
tiable function y  y(x) gives slopes of tangent lines at points on its graph. Because a solution 
y  y(x) of a first-order differential equation dy/dx  f (x, y) is necessarily a differentiable 
function on its interval I of definition, it must also be continuous on I. Thus the corresponding 
solution curve on I must have no breaks and must possess a tangent line at each point (x, y(x)). 
The slope of the tangent line at (x, y(x)) on a solution curve is the value of the first derivative 
dy/dx at this point, and this we know from the differential equation f (x, y(x)). Now suppose 
that (x, y) represents any point in a region of the xy-plane over which the function f is defined. 
The value f (x, y) that the function f assigns to the point represents the slope of a line, or as we 
shall envision it, a line segment called a lineal element. For example, consider the equation 
dy/dx  0.2xy, where f (x, y)  0.2xy. At, say, the point (2, 3), the slope of a lineal element is 
f (2, 3)  0.2(2)(3)  1.2. FIGURE 2.1.1(a) shows a line segment with slope 1.2 passing through 
(2, 3). As shown in Figure 2.1.1(b), if a solution curve also passes through the point (2, 3), it 
does so tangent to this line segment; in other words, the lineal element is a miniature tangent 
line at that point.
 Direction Field If we systematically evaluate f over a rectangular grid of points in the 
xy-plane and draw a lineal element at each point (x, y) of the grid with slope f (x, y), then the 
collection of all these lineal elements is called a direction field or a slope field of the differential 
equation dy/dx  f (x, y). Visually, the direction field suggests the appearance or shape of a fam-
ily of solution curves of the differential equation, and consequently it may be possible to see at 
a glance certain qualitative aspects of the solutions—regions in the plane, for example, in which 
a solution exhibits an unusual behavior. A single solution curve that passes through a direction 
field must follow the flow pattern of the field; it is tangent to a lineal element when it intersects 
a point in the grid.

EXAMPLE 1 
Direction Field
The direction field for the differential equation dy/dx  0.2xy shown in FIGURE 2.1.2(a) was 
obtained using computer software in which a 5  5 grid of points (mh, nh), m and 
n integers, was defined by letting 5  m  5, 5  n  5 and h  1. Notice in 
Figure 2.1.2(a) that at any point along the x-axis (y  0) and the y-axis (x  0) the slopes 
are f (x, 0)  0 and f (0, y)  0, respectively, so the lineal elements are horizontal. Moreover, 
observe in the first quadrant that for a fixed value of x, the values of f (x, y)  0.2xy 
 increase as y increases; similarly, for a fixed y, the values of f (x, y)  0.2xy increase as 
x increases. This means that as both x and y increase, the lineal elements become almost 
vertical and have positive slope ( f (x, y)  0.2xy  0 for x  0, y  0). In the second 
quadrant, | f (x, y)| increases as |x| and y increase, and so the lineal elements again become 
almost vertical but this time have negative slope ( f (x, y)  0.2xy 	 0 for x 	 0, y  0). 
Reading left to right, imagine a solution curve starts at a point in the second quadrant, 
moves steeply downward, becomes flat as it passes through the y-axis, and then as it 
enters the first quadrant moves steeply upward—in other words, its shape would be  concave 
upward and similar to a horseshoe. From this it could be surmised that y S q as x S 
q. 
Now in the third and fourth quadrants, since f (x, y)  0.2xy  0 and f (x, y)  0.2xy 	 0, 
respectively, the situation is reversed; a solution curve increases and then decreases as 
we move from left to right.
 
We saw in (1) of Section 1.1 that y  e0.1x2 is an explicit solution of the differential 
equation dy/dx  0.2xy; you should verify that a one-parameter family of solutions of the 
same equation is given by y  ce0.1x2. For purposes of comparison with Fig ure 2.1.2(a) some 
representative graphs of members of this family are shown in Figure 2.1.2(b).
EXAMPLE 2 
Direction Field
Use a direction field to sketch an approximate solution curve for the initial-value  problem 
dy/dx  sin y, y(0)   3
2.
SOLUTION Before proceeding, recall that from the continuity of f (x, y)  sin y and 
0f/0y  cos y, Theorem 1.2.1 guarantees the existence of a unique solution curve passing 
through any specified point (x0, y0) in the plane. Now we set our computer software again 
for a 5  5 rectangular region, and specify (because of the initial condition) points in that 
region with vertical and horizontal separation of 1
2 unit—that is, at points (mh, nh), h  1
2, 
m and n integers such that 10  m  10, 10  n  10. The result is shown in FIGURE 2.1.3. 
Since the right-hand side of dy/dx  sin y is 0 at y  0 and at y  p, the lineal elements 
are horizontal at all points whose second coordinates are y  0 or y  p. It makes sense 
then that a solution curve passing through the initial point (0,  3
2) has the shape shown in 
color in the figure.
 Increasing/Decreasing Interpretation of the derivative dy/dx as a function that gives 
slope plays the key role in the construction of a direction field. Another telling property of the 
first derivative will be used next, namely, if dy/dx  0 (or dy/dx 	 0) for all x in an interval I, 
then a differentiable function y  y(x) is increasing (or decreasing) on I.

REMARKS
Sketching a direction field by hand is straightforward but time consuming; it is probably one 
of those tasks about which an argument can be made for doing it once or twice in a lifetime, 
but is overall most efficiently carried out by means of computer software. Prior to calculators, 
PCs, and software, the method of isoclines was used to facilitate sketching a direction field 
by hand. For the DE dy/dx  f (x, y), any member of the family of curves f (x, y)  c, 
c a constant, is called an isocline. Lineal elements drawn through points on a specific isocline, 
say, f (x, y)  c1, all have the same slope c1. In Problem 15 in Exercises 2.1, you have your 
two opportunities to sketch a direction field by hand.

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
2.1.2 Autonomous First-Order DEs
 DEs Free of the Independent Variable In Section 1.1 we divided the class of or-
dinary differential equations into two types: linear and nonlinear. We now consider briefly another 
kind of classification of ordinary differential equations, a classification that is of particular im-
portance in the qualitative investigation of differential equations. An ordinary differential equa-
tion in which the independent variable does not appear explicitly is said to be autonomous. If 
the symbol x denotes the independent variable, then an autonomous first-order differential equa-
tion can be written in general form as F(y, y)  0 or in normal form as
dy
dx  f (y). 
(1)
We shall assume throughout the discussion that follows that f in (1) and its derivative f  are 
continuous functions of y on some interval I. The first-order equations
 
f ( y) 
f (x, y)
T 
T
dy
dx  1  y2 and 
dy
dx  0.2xy
are autonomous and nonautonomous, respectively.
Many differential equations encountered in applications, or equations that are models of 
physical laws that do not change over time, are autonomous. As we have already seen in Section 
1.3, in an applied context, symbols other than y and x are routinely used to represent the dependent 
and independent variables. For example, if t represents time, then inspection of
 
dA
dt  kA, 
dx
dt  kx(n  1 2 x), 
dT
dt  k(T 2 Tm), 
dA
dt  6 2
1
100 A,
where k, n, and Tm are constants, shows that each equation is time-independent. Indeed, all of 
the first-order differential equations introduced in Section 1.3 are time-independent and so are 
autonomous.
 Critical Points The zeros of the function f in (1) are of special importance. We say that 
a real number c is a critical point of the autonomous differential equation (1) if it is a zero of f  ,
that is, f (c)  0. A critical point is also called an equilibrium point or stationary point. Now 
observe that if we substitute the constant function y(x)  c into (1), then both sides of the equation 
equal zero. This means
If c is a critical point of (1), then y (x)  c is a constant solution of the autonomous 
differential equation.
A constant solution y(x)  c of (1) is called an equilibrium solution; equilibria are the only 
constant solutions of (1).
As already mentioned, we can tell when a nonconstant solution y  y(x) of (1) is increas-
ing or decreasing by determining the algebraic sign of the derivative dy/dx; in the case of (1) 
we do this by identifying the intervals on the y-axis over which the function f (y) is positive 
or negative.

where a and b are positive constants, has the normal form dP/dt  f (P), which is (1) with t 
and P playing the parts of x and y, respectively, and hence is autonomous. From 
f (P)  P(a  bP)  0, we see that 0 and a/b are critical points of the equation and so the 
equilibrium solutions are P(t)  0 and P(t)  a/b. By putting the critical points on a vertical line, 
we divide the line into three intervals defined by q 	 P 	 0, 0 	 P 	 a/b, a/b 	 P 	 q. 
The arrows on the line shown in FIGURE 2.1.4 indicate the algebraic sign of f (P)  P(a  bP) 
on these intervals and whether a nonconstant solution P(t) is increasing or decreasing on an 
interval. The following table explains the figure.

Figure 2.1.4 is called a one-dimensional phase portrait, or simply phase portrait, of the 
differential equation dP/dt  P(a  bP). The vertical line is called a phase line.
 Solution Curves Without solving an autonomous differential equation, we can usually 
say a great deal about its solution curves. Since the function f in (1) is independent of the vari-
able x, we can consider f defined for q 	 x 	 q or for 0  x 	 q. Also, since f and its 
derivative f  are continuous functions of y on some interval I of the y-axis, the fundamental results 
of Theorem 1.2.1 hold in some horizontal strip or region R in the xy-plane corresponding to I, 
and so through any point (x0, y0) in R there passes only one solution curve of (1). See FIGURE 2.1.5 (a). 
For the sake of discussion, let us suppose that (1) possesses exactly two critical points, c1 and c2, 
and that c1 	 c2. The graphs of the equilibrium solutions y(x)  c1 and y(x)  c2 are horizontal 
lines, and these lines partition the region R into three subregions R1, R2, and R3 as illustrated in 
Figure 2.1.5(b). Without proof, here are some conclusions that we can draw about a nonconstant 
solution y(x) of (1):
•  If (x0, y0) is in a subregion Ri, i  1, 2, 3, and y(x) is a solution whose graph passes through 
this point, then y(x) remains in the subregion Ri for all x. As illustrated in Figure 2.1.5(b), 
the solution y(x) in R2 is bounded below by c1 and above by c2; that is, c1 	 y(x) 	 c2 for 
all x. The solution curve stays within R2 for all x because the graph of a nonconstant solu-
tion of (1) cannot cross the graph of either equilibrium solution y(x)  c1 or y(x)  c2. See 
Problem 33 in Exercises 2.1.
•  By continuity of f we must then have either f (y)  0 or f (y) 	 0 for all x in a subregion Ri, 
i  1, 2, 3. In other words, f (y) cannot change signs in a subregion. See Problem 33 in 
Exercises 2.1.
•  Since dy/dx  f (y(x)) is either positive or negative in a subregion Ri, i  1, 2, 3, a solution 
y(x) is strictly monotonic—that is, y(x) is either increasing or decreasing in a subregion Ri. 
Therefore y(x) cannot be oscillatory, nor can it have a relative extremum (maximum or 
minimum). See Problem 33 in Exercises 2.1.
•  If y(x) is bounded above by a critical point c1 (as in subregion R1 where y(x) 	 c1 for all x), 
then the graph of y(x) must approach the graph of the equilibrium solution y(x)  c1 either 
as x S q or as x S q. If y(x) is bounded—that is, bounded above and below by two 
consecutive critical points (as in subregion R2 where c1 	 y(x) 	 c2 for all x), then the graph 
of y(x) must approach the graphs of the equilibrium solutions y(x)  c1 and y(x)  c2, one 
as x S q and the other as x S q. If y(x) is bounded below by a critical point (as in 
subregion R3 where c2 	 y(x) for all x), then the graph of y(x) must approach the graph of 
the equilibrium solution y(x)  c2 either as x S q or as x S q. See Problem 34 in 
Exercises 2.1.
 With the foregoing facts in mind, let us reexamine the differential equation in Example 3.

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
EXAMPLE 4 
Example 3 Revisited
The three intervals determined on the P-axis or phase line by the critical points P  0 and 
P  a/b now correspond in the tP-plane to three subregions:
 
R1: q 	 P 	 0,  R2: 0 	 P 	 a/b,  R3: a/b 	 P 	 q,
where q 	 t 	 q. The phase portrait in Figure 2.1.4 tells us that P(t) is decreasing in R1, 
increasing in R2, and decreasing in R3. If P(0)  P0 is an initial value, then in R1, R2, and R3, 
we have, respectively, the following:
 
(i) 
 For P0 	 0, P(t) is bounded above. Since P(t) is decreasing, P(t) decreases without 
bound for increasing t and so P(t) S 0 as t S q. This means the negative t-axis, 
the graph of the equilibrium solution P(t)  0, is a horizontal asymptote for a solu-
tion curve.
 
(ii)  For 0 	 P0 	 a/b, P(t) is bounded. Since P(t) is increasing, P(t) S a/b as t S q 
and P(t) S 0 as t S q. The graphs of the two equilibrium solutions, P(t)  0 and 
P(t)  a/b, are horizontal lines that are horizontal asymptotes for any solution curve 
starting in this subregion.
 
(iii)  For P0  a/b, P(t) is bounded below. Since P(t) is decreasing, P(t) S a/b as t S q. 
The graph of the equilibrium solution P(t)  a/b is a horizontal  asymptote for a 
solution curve.
In FIGURE 2.1.6, the phase line is the P-axis in the tP-plane. For clarity, the original phase 
line from Figure 2.1.4 is reproduced to the left of the plane in which the subregions R1, R2, 
and R3 are shaded. The graphs of the equilibrium solutions P(t)  a/b and P(t)  0 (the t-axis) 
are shown in the figure as blue dashed lines; the solid graphs represent typical graphs of P(t) 
illustrating the three cases just discussed.
In a subregion such as R1 in Example 4, where P(t) is decreasing and unbounded below, we 
must necessarily have P(t) S q. Do not interpret this last statement to mean P(t) S q as 
t S q; we could have P(t) S q as t S T, where T  0 is a finite number that depends on the 
initial condition P(t0)  P0. Thinking in dynamic terms, P(t) could “blow up” in finite time; 
thinking graphically, P(t) could have a vertical asymptote at t  T  0. A similar remark holds 
for the subregion R3.
The differential equation dy/dx  sin y in Example 2 is autonomous and has an infinite number 
of critical points since sin y  0 at y  np, n an integer. Moreover, we now know that because 
the solution y(x) that passes through (0, 3
2) is bounded above and below by two consecutive 
critical points (p 	 y(x) 	 0) and is decreasing (sin y 	 0 for p 	 y 	 0), the graph of y(x) 
must approach the graphs of the equilibrium solutions as horizontal asymptotes: y(x) S p as 
x S q and y(x) S 0 as x S q.
EXAMPLE 5 
Solution Curves of an Autonomous DE
The autonomous equation dy/dx  (y  1)2 possesses the single critical point 1. From the 
phase portrait in FIGURE 2.1.7(a), we conclude that a solution y(x) is an increasing function in 
the subregions defined by q 	 y 	 1 and 1 	 y 	 q, where q 	 x 	 q. For an initial 
condition y(0)  y0 	 1, a solution y(x) is increasing and bounded above by 1, and so y(x) S 1 
as x S q; for y(0)  y0  1, a solution y(x) is increasing and unbounded.
Now y(x)  1  1/(x  c) is a one-parameter family of solutions of the differential equa-
tion. (See Problem 4 in Exercises 2.2.) A given initial condition determines a value for c. 
For the initial conditions, say, y(0)  1 	 1 and y(0)  2  1, we find, in turn, that 
y(x)  1  1/(x  1
2) and so y(x)  1  1/(x  1). As shown in Figure 2.1.7(b) and 2.1.7(c), 
the graph of each of these rational functions possesses a vertical asymptote. But bear in mind 
that the solutions of the IVPs

three types of behavior y(x) can exhibit near c. In FIGURE 2.1.8 we have placed c on four ver-
tical phase lines. When both arrowheads on either side of the dot labeled c point toward c, as 
in Figure 2.1.8(a), all solutions y(x) of (1) that start from an initial point (x0, y0) sufficiently 
near c exhibit the asymptotic behavior limxSq y(x)  c. For this reason the critical point c is 
said to be asymptotically stable. Using a physical analogy, a solution that starts near c is like 
a charged particle that, over time, is drawn to a particle of opposite charge, and so c is also 
referred to as an attractor. When both arrowheads on either side of the dot labeled c point 
away from c, as in Figure 2.1.8(b), all solutions y(x) of (1) that start from an initial point 
(x0, y0) move away from c as x increases. In this case the critical point c is said to be unstable. 
An unstable critical point is also called a repeller, for obvious reasons. The critical point c 
illustrated in Figures 2.1.8(c) and 2.1.8(d) is neither an attractor nor a repeller. But since c 
exhibits characteristics of both an attractor and a repeller—that is, a solution starting from 
an initial point (x0, y0) sufficiently near c is attracted to c from one side and repelled from the 
other side—we say that the critical point c is semi-stable. In Example 3, the critical point a/b 
is asymptotically stable (an attractor) and the critical point 0 is unstable (a repeller). The 
critical point 1 in Example 5 is semi-stable.
 Autonomous DEs and Direction Fields If a first-order differential equation is 
autonomous, then we see from the right-hand side of its normal form dy/dx  f (y) that slopes 
of lineal elements through points in the rectangular grid used to construct a direction field 
for the DE depend solely on the y-coordinate of the points. Put another way, lineal elements 
passing through points on any horizontal line must all have the same slope and therefore are 
parallel; slopes of lineal elements along any vertical line will, of course, vary. These facts 
are apparent from inspection of the horizontal gray strip and vertical blue strip in FIGURE 2.1.9. 
The figure exhibits a direction field for the autonomous equation dy/dx  2(y  1). The 
red lineal elements in Figure 2.1.9 have zero slope because they lie along the graph of the 
equilibrium solution y  1.

| CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
 Translation Property Recall from precalculus mathematics that the graph of a function 
y  f (x  k), where k is a constant, is the graph of y  f (x) rigidly translated or shifted horizontally 
along the x-axis by an amount | k |; the translation is to the right if k . 0 and to the left if k , 0.
It turns out that under the assumptions stated after equation (1), solution curves of an au-
tonomous first-order DE are related by the concept of translation. To see this, let’s consider 
the differential equation dy/dx  y(3  y), which is a special case of the autonomous equation 
considered in Examples 3 and 4. Since y  0 and y  3 are equilibrium solutions of the DE, 
their graphs divide the xy-plane into subregions R1, R2, and R3, defined by the three 
inequalities:
 
R1: q  y  0,  R2: 0  y  3,  R3: 3  y  q.
In FIGURE 2.1.10 we have superimposed on a direction field of the DE six solutions curves. The 
figure illustrates that all solution curves of the same color, that is, solution curves lying within a 
particular subregion Ri, all look alike. This is no coincidence but is a natural consequence of the 
fact that lineal elements passing through points on any horizontal line are parallel. That said, the 
following translation property of an autonomous DE should make sense:
 If y(x) is a solution of an autonomous differential equation dy/dx  f ( y), 
then y1(x)  y(x  k), k a constant, is also a solution.
Hence, if y(x) is a solution of the initial-value problem dy/dx  f (y), y(0)  y0, then 
y1(x)  y(x  x0) is a solution of the IVP dy/dx  f (y), y(x0)  y0. For example, it is easy to 
verify that y(x)  ex, q  x  q, is a solution of the IVP dy/dx  y, y(0)  1 and so a solution 
y1(x) of, say, dy/dx  y, y(4)  1 is y(x)  ex translated 4 units to the right:
 
y1(x)  y(x  4)  ex4, q  x  q.

tonomous DE of the form given in (1) for which every critical 
point is nonisolated? Do not think profound thoughts.
 33. Suppose that y(x) is a nonconstant solution of the autonomous 
equation dy/dx  f (y) and that c is a critical point of the DE. 
Discuss: Why can’t the graph of y(x) cross the graph of the

oscillatory or have a relative extremum (maximum or minimum)?

is a well-known population model. Suppose the DE is 
changed to
 
dP

 where a and b are positive constants. Discuss what happens 
to the population P as time t increases.
 39. Population Model Another population model is given by 
 
dP

 where h  0 and k  0 are constants. For what initial values 
P(0)  P0 does this model predict that the population will go 
extinct?
 40. Terminal Velocity The autonomous differential equation
 
m dv
dt  mg 2 kv,
 
 where k is a positive constant of proportionality called the 
drag coefficient and g is the acceleration due to gravity, is 
a model for the instantaneous velocity v of a body of mass 
m that is falling under the influence of gravity. Because the 
term kv represents air resistance or drag, the velocity of 
a body falling from a great height does not increase without 
bound as time t increases. Use a phase portrait of the 
 differential equation to find the limiting, or terminal, veloc-
ity of the body. Explain your reasoning. See page 24.
 41. Terminal Velocity In Problem 17 of Exercises 1.3, we indi-
cated that for high-speed motion of a body, air resistance 
is taken to be proportional to a power of its instantaneous 
velocity v. If we take air resistance to be proportional to v2, 
then the mathematical model for the instantaneous velocity 
of a falling body of mass m in Problem 40 becomes
 
m  dv
dt  mg 2 kv2,
 
 where k  0. Use a phase portrait to find the terminal velocity 
of the body. Explain your reasoning. See page 27.
 42. Chemical Reactions When certain kinds of chemicals are 
combined, the rate at which a new compound is formed is 
governed by the differential equation
 
dX
dt  k(a 2 X )(b 2 X ),
 
 where k  0 is a constant of proportionality and b  a  0. 
Here X(t) denotes the number of grams of the new compound 
formed in time t. See page 22.
(a) Use a phase portrait of the differential equation to predict 
the behavior of X as t S q.
(b) Consider the case when a  b. Use a phase portrait of 
the differential equation to predict the behavior of X as 
t S q when X(0) 	 a. When X(0)  a.

k  1 and a  b is X(t)  a  1/(t  c). Find a solution

Graph these two solutions. Does the behavior of the solu-
tions as t S q agree with your answers to part (b)?
2.2 Separable Equations
INTRODUCTION Consider the first-order equations dy/dx  f (x, y). When f does not depend 
on the variable y, that is, f (x, y)  g(x), the differential equation
 
dy
dx  g(x) 
(1)
can be solved by integration. If g(x) is a continuous function, then integrating both sides of (1) 
gives the solution y   g(x) dx  G(x)  c, where G(x) is an anti derivative (indefinite integral) 
of g(x). For example, if dy/dx  1  e2x, then y   (1  e2x) dx or y  x  1
2e2x  c.
 A Definition Equation (1), as well as its method of solution, is just a special case when 
f in dy/dx  f (x, y) is a product of a function of x and a function of y.
Definition 2.2.1 
Separable Equation
A first-order differential equation of the form
 
dy
dx  g(x) h(y) 
is said to be separable or to have separable variables.

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
For example, the differential equations
dy
dx  x2y4e5x23y and dy
dx  y  cos x
are separable and nonseparable, respectively. To see this, note that in the first equation we can 
factor f (x,  y)  x2y4e5x23y as
 
g(x) 
h( y)
 
f (x,  y)  x2y4e5x23y  (x2e5x)(y4e3y)
but in the second there is no way writing y  cos x as a product of a function of x times a func-
tion of y.
Observe that by dividing by the function h( y), a separable equation can be written as
p(y) dy
dx  g(x), 
(2)
where, for convenience, we have denoted 1/h( y) by p( y). From this last form we can see im-
mediately that (2) reduces to (1) when h( y)  1.
Now if y  f(x) represents a solution of (2), we must have p(f(x))f(x)  g(x), and 
therefore,
 
#p(f(x))f9(x) dx  #g(x) dx. 
(3)
But dy  f(x) dx, and so (3) is the same as
 
#p(y) dy  #g(x) dx or H(y)  G(x)  c, 
(4)
where H( y) and G(x) are antiderivatives of p(y)  1/h( y) and g(x), respectively.
 Method of Solution Equation (4) indicates the procedure for solving separable equa-
tions. A one-parameter family of solutions, usually given implicitly, is obtained by integrating 
both sides of the differential form p( y) dy  g(x) dx.
There is no need to use two constants in the integration of a separable equation, because if we 
write H( y)  c1  G(x)  c2, then the difference c2  c1 can be replaced by a single constant c, 
as in (4). In many instances throughout the chapters that follow, we will relabel constants in a 
manner convenient to a given equation. For example, multiples of constants or combinations of 
constants can sometimes be replaced by a single constant.
EXAMPLE 1 
Solving a Separable DE
Solve (1  x) dy  y dx  0.
SOLUTION Dividing by (1  x)y, we can write dy/y  dx/(1  x), from which it follows that

and so 
 y 

Relabeling 
ec1 by c then gives y  c(1  x).

use only one constant.

2.2 Separable Equations

In the solution of Example 1, because each integral results in a logarithm, a judicious choice 
for the constant of integration is ln | c | rather than c. Rewriting the second line of the solution as 
ln | y |  ln | 1  x |  ln | c | enables us to combine the terms on the right-hand side by the proper-
ties of logarithms. From ln | y |  ln | c(1  x) |, we immediately get y  c(1  x). Even if the 
indefinite integrals are not all logarithms, it may still be advantageous to use ln | c |. However, no 
firm rule can be given.
In Section 1.1 we have already seen that a solution curve may be only a segment or an arc of 
the graph of an implicit solution G(x, y)  0.
EXAMPLE 2 
Solution Curve
Solve the initial-value problem 
dy

SOLUTION By rewriting the equation as y dy  x dx we get
 
#y  dy  #x  dx and 
y2
2  x2
2  c1.
We can write the result of the integration as x2  y2  c2 by replacing the constant 2c1 by c2. 
This solution of the differential equation represents a one-parameter family of concentric 
circles centered at the origin.
Now when x  4, y  3, so that 16  9  25  c2. Thus the initial-value problem de-
termines the circle x2  y2  25 with radius 5. Because of its simplicity, we can solve this 
implicit solution for an explicit solution that satisfies the initial condition. We have seen this 
solution as y  f2(x) or y  "25 2 x2, 5 , x , 5 in Example 8 of Section 1.1. A 
solution curve is the graph of a differentiable function. In this case the solution curve is the 
lower semicircle, shown in blue in FIGURE 2.2.1, that contains the point (4, 3).
 Losing a Solution Some care should be exercised when separating variables, since the 
variable divisors could be zero at a point. Specifically, if r is a zero of the function h(y), then 
substituting y  r into dy/dx  g(x) h(y) makes both sides zero; in other words, y  r is a constant 
solution of the differential equation. But after separating variables, observe that the left side 
of dy/h(y)  g(x) dx is undefined at r. As a consequence, y  r may not show up in the family 
of solutions obtained after integration and simplification. Recall, such a solution is called a 
singular solution.

The second equation in (5) is the result of using partial fractions on the left side of the first 
equation. Integrating and using the laws of logarithms gives

4 ln |y 2 2| 2 1
4 ln |y  2|  x  c1 or ln 2 y 2 2
y  2 2  4x  c2 or 
y 2 2
y  2  e4xc2.
Here we have replaced 4c1 by c2. Finally, after replacing ec2 by c and solving the last equation 
for y, we get the one-parameter family of solutions
 
y  2 1  ce4x
1 2 ce4x. 
(6)
Now if we factor the right side of the differential equation as dy/dx  (y  2)(y  2), we know 
from the discussion in Section 2.1 that y  2 and y  2 are two constant (equilibrium)

ing to the value c  0. However, y  2 is a singular solution; it cannot be obtained from (6) 
for any choice of the parameter c. This latter solution was lost early on in the solution process. 
Inspection of (5) clearly indicates that we must preclude y 

dx  ey sin 2x, y(0)  0.
SOLUTION Dividing the equation by e y cos x gives
 
e2y 2 y
ey
 dy 
 sin 2x
 cos x  dx.
Before integrating, we use termwise division on the left side and the trigonometric identity 
sin 2x  2 sin x cos x on the right side. Then
 
 #(ey 2 yey) dy  2#
 sin x dx
yields 
   ey  yey  ey  2 cos x  c. 
(7)
The initial condition y  0 when x  0 implies c  4. Thus a solution of the initial-value 
problem is
 
ey  yey  ey  4 2 2 cos x. 
(8)
 Use of Computers In the Remarks at the end of Section 1.1 we mentioned that it may 
be difficult to use an implicit solution G(x, y)  0 to find an explicit solution y  f(x). 
Equation (8) shows that the task of solving for y in terms of x may present more problems than 
just the drudgery of symbol pushing—it simply can’t be done! Implicit solutions such as (8) are 
somewhat frustrating; neither the graph of the equation nor an interval over which a solution 
satisfying y(0)  0 is defined is apparent. The problem of “seeing” what an implicit solution 
looks like can be overcome in some cases by means of technology. One way* of proceeding is 
to use the contour plot application of a CAS. Recall from multivariate calculus that for a function 
of two variables z  G(x, y) the two-dimensional curves defined by G(x, y)  c, where c is con-
stant, are called the level curves of the function. With the aid of a CAS we have illustrated in 
FIGURE 2.2.2 some of the level curves of the function G(x, y)  ey  ye–y  e–y  2 cos x. The 
family of solutions defined by (7) are the level curves G(x, y)  c. FIGURE 2.2.3 illustrates, in blue, 
the level curve G(x, y)  4, which is the particular solution (8). The red curve in Figure 2.2.3 is the 
level curve G(x, y)  2, which is the member of the family G(x, y)  c that satisfies y(p/2)  0.
If an initial condition leads to a particular solution by finding a specific value of the 
 parameter c in a family of solutions for a first-order differential equation, it is a natural 
 inclination for most students (and instructors) to relax and be content. However, a solution 
of an initial-value problem may not be unique. We saw in Example 4 of Section 1.2 that the 
initial-value problem
 
dy
dx  xy1>2, 
y(0)  0, 
(9)
has at least two solutions, y  0 and y  1
16 x4. We are now in a position to solve the equation.

Each of the functions in the family given in (10) is a solution of equation (9) on the interval 
(q, q) provided we take c  0. See Problem 48 in Exercises 2.2. Now when we substitute x  0, 
y  0 in (10) we see that c  0. Therefore y  1
16x4 is a solution of the IVP. The trivial solution 
y  0 was lost by dividing by y

solutions, since for any choice of the parameter a  0 the piecewise-defined function

satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition. See FIGURE 2.2.4.
 An Integral-Defined Function In (ii) of the Remarks at the end of Section 1.1 it was 
pointed out that a solution method for a certain kind of differential equation may lead to an 
integral-defined function. This is especially true for separable differential equations because inte-
gration is the method of solution. For example, if g is continuous on some interval I containing 
x0 and x, then a solution of the simple initial-value problem dy/dx  g(x), y(x0)  y0 defined on 
I is given by 
 
y(x)  y0  #
x
x0
g(t) dt. 
To see this, we have immediately from (12) of Section 1.1 that dy/dx  g(x) and y(x0)  y0
because ex0
x0  g(t) dt  0. When e g(t) dt is nonelementary, that is, cannot be expressed in terms of 
elementary functions, the form y(x)  y0  ex
x0 g(t) dt may be the best we can do in obtaining 
an explicit solution of an IVP. The next example illustrates this idea.

SOLUTION The function g(x)  ex2 is continuous on the interval (q,  q) but its antide-

The procedure illustrated in Example 5 works equally well on separable equations dy/dx 
g(x) f (y) where, say, f (y) possesses an elementary antiderivative but g(x) does not possess an 
elementary antiderivative. See Problems 29 and 30 in Exercises 2.2.

25–28 in Exercises 1.1.

REMARKS
In some of the preceding examples we saw that the constant in the one-parameter family of 
solutions for a first-order differential equation can be relabeled when convenient. Also, it can 
easily happen that two individuals solving the same equation correctly arrive at dissimilar 
expressions for their answers. For example, by separation of variables, we can show that 
one-parameter families of solutions for the DE (1  y 2) dx  (1  x 2) dy  0 are
 
arctan x  arctan y  c or 
x  y
1 2 xy  c.
As you work your way through the next several sections, keep in mind that families of solutions 
may be equivalent in the sense that one family may be obtained from another by either relabeling 
the constant or applying algebra and trigonometry. See Problems 27 and 28 in Exercises 2.2.

2.2 Separable Equations 
| 49
Often a radical change in the form of the solution of a differen-
tial equation corresponds to a very small change in either the 
initial condition or the equation itself. In Problems 39–42, find 
an explicit solution of the given initial-value problem. Use a 
graphing utility to plot the graph of each solution. Compare each 
solution curve in a neighborhood of (0, 1).

 43. Every autonomous first-order equation dy/dx  f (y) is 
separable. Find explicit solutions y1(x), y2(x), y3(x), and y4(x) 
of the differential equation dy/dx  y  y3 that satisfy, in turn, 
the initial conditions y1(0)  2, y2(0)  1

y4(0)  2. Use a graphing utility to plot the graphs of each 
solution. Compare these graphs with those predicted in 
Problem 19 of Exercises 2.1. Give the exact interval of defini-
tion for each solution.

concave up and where they are concave down (see 
Problems 35 and 36 in Exercises 2.1). Use the phase por-
trait and concavity to sketch, by hand, some typical solu-
tion curves.
(b) Find explicit solutions y1(x), y2(x), y3(x), and y4(x) of the 
differential equation in part (a) that satisfy, in turn, the 
initial conditions y1(0)  4, y2(0)  2, y3(1)  2, and

tion y  f2(x) of the initial-value problem in Example 2 
is the open interval (5, 5).
(b) Can any solution of the differential equation cross the 
x-axis? Do you think that x 2  y 2  1 is an implicit solution 
of the initial-value problem dy/dx  x/y, y(1)  0?

tions of the first-order differential equation dy/dx  xy

y  (1
4x4  c)2 for c  0. Each solution in this family is 
 defined on the interval (q, q). The last statement is not 
true if we choose c to be negative. For c  1, explain why 
y  (1
4x4 2 1)2 is not a solution of the DE on (q, q). Find 
an interval of definition I on which y  (1
4x4 2 1)2 is a solution 
of the DE.
 49. In Problems 43 and 44 we saw that every autonomous first-

also in the regions defined by | x |  1, | y |  1. Sketch all

possesses real solutions.
(b) Solve the DE in part (a) in the regions defined by | x |  1,

mathematical model for the shape of a flexible cable strung 
between two vertical supports is

(11)
 
 where W denotes the portion of the total vertical load between 
the points P1 and P2 shown in Figure 1.3.9. The DE (11) is 
separable under the following conditions that describe a sus-
pension bridge.
 
   Let us assume that the x- and y-axes are as shown in 
FIGURE 2.2.5—that is, the x-axis runs along the horizontal 
roadbed, and the y-axis passes through (0, a), which is the 
lowest point on one cable over the span of the bridge, co-
inciding with the interval [L/2, L/2]. In the case of a sus-
pension bridge, the usual assumption is that the vertical load 
in (11) is only a uniform roadbed distributed along the 
horizontal axis. In other words, it is assumed that the weight 
of all cables is negligible in comparison to the weight of the 

50 
| CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
roadbed and that the weight per unit length of the roadbed 
(say, pounds per horizontal foot) is a constant r. Use this 
information to set up and solve an appropriate initial-value 
problem from which the shape (a curve with equation 
y  f(x)) of each of the two cables in a suspension bridge 
is determined. Express your solution of the IVP in terms of 
the sag h and span L shown in Figure 2.2.5.

2.3 Linear Equations
INTRODUCTION We continue our search for solutions of first-order DEs by next examining 
linear equations. Linear differential equations are an especially “friendly” family of differential 
equations in that, given a linear equation, whether first-order or a higher-order kin, there is always 
a good possibility that we can find some sort of solution of the equation that we can look at.
 A Definition The form of a linear first-order DE was given in (7) of Section 1.1. This 
form, the case when n  1 in (6) of that section, is reproduced here for convenience.
Definition 2.3.1 
Linear Equation
A first-order differential equation of the form
 
a1(x) dy
dx  a0(x)y  g(x) 
(1)
is said to be a linear equation in the dependent variable y.

 
2.3 Linear Equations 
| 51
When g(x)  0, the linear equation (1) is said to be homogeneous; otherwise, it is 
nonhomogeneous.
 Standard Form By dividing both sides of (1) by the lead coefficient a1(x) we obtain a 
more useful form, the standard form, of a linear equation
 
dy
dx  P(x)y  f (x). 
(2)
We seek a solution of (2) on an interval I for which both functions P and f are continuous.
In the discussion that follows, we illustrate a property and a procedure and end up with a 
formula representing the form that every solution of (2) must have. But more than the formula, 
the property and the procedure are important, because these two concepts carry over to linear 
equations of higher order.
 The Property The differential equation (2) has the property that its solution is the sum 
of the two solutions, y  yc  yp, where yc is a solution of the associated homogeneous equation
 
dy
dx  P(x)y  0 
(3)
and yp is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (2). To see this, observe
 
d
dx fyc  ypg  P(x)fyc  ypg  c dyc
dx  P(x)ycd  c
dyp
dx  P(x)ypd  f ( x).
 
 
 
0 
f (x)
 The Homogeneous DE The homogeneous equation (3) is also separable. This fact 
enables us to find yc by writing (3) as
 
dy
y  P(x) dx  0
and integrating. Solving for y gives yc  ce–P(x)dx. For convenience let us write yc  cy1(x), where 
y1  e–P(x)dx. The fact that dy1/dx  P(x)y1  0 will be used next to determine yp.
 The Nonhomogeneous DE We can now find a particular solution of equation (2) by a 
procedure known as variation of parameters. The basic idea here is to find a function u so that 
yp  u(x)y1(x)  u(x) e–P(x)dx is a solution of (2). In other words, our assumption for yp is the same as 
yc  cy1(x) except that c is replaced by the “variable parameter” u. Substituting yp  uy1 into (2) gives
 
Product Rule 
zero
 
T 
T
 
u dy1
dx  y1 du
dx  P(x)uy1  f ( x) or uc dy1
dx  P(x)y1d  y1 du
dx  f ( x)
so that 
y1 du
dx  f ( x).
Separating variables and integrating then gives
 
du  f (x)
y1(x) dx and u  #
f (x)
y1(x) dx.
From the definition of y1(x), we see 1/y1(x)  eP(x) dx. Therefore
 
yp  uy1  a#
f (x)
y1(x) dxb  eeP(x) dx  eeP(x) dx#eeP(x) dxf (x) dx,
and 
y  yc  yp  ceeP(x) dx  eeP(x) dx#eeP(x) dxf (x) dx. 
(4)
Hence if (2) has a solution, it must be of form (4). Conversely, it is a straightforward exercise in 
differentiation to verify that (4) constitutes a one-parameter family of solutions of equation (2).

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
You should not memorize the formula given in (4). There is an equivalent but easier way of 
solving (2). If (4) is multiplied by
eeP(x) dx 
(5)
and then 
eeP(x) dxy  c  #eeP(x) dxf ( x) dx 
(6)
is differentiated, 
d
dx feeP(x) dxyg  eeP(x) dxf ( x), 
(7)
we get 
eeP(x) dx dy
dx  P(x) eeP(x) dxy  eeP(x) dxf ( x). 
(8)
Dividing the last result by eP(x) dx gives (2).
 Method of Solution The recommended method of solving (2) actually consists of 
(6)–(8) worked in reverse order. In other words, if (2) is multiplied by (5), we get (8). The left 
side of (8) is recognized as the derivative of the product of eP(x) dx and y. This gets us to (7). We 
then integrate both sides of (7) to get the solution (6). Because we can solve (2) by integration 
after multiplication by eeP(x) dx, we call this function an integrating factor for the differential 
equation. For convenience we summarize these results. We again emphasize that you should not 
memorize formula (4) but work through the following two-step procedure each time.

Solving a Linear DE
Solve 
dy
dx 2 3y  6.
SOLUTION This linear equation can be solved by separation of variables. Alternatively, since 
the equation is already in the standard form (2), we see that the integrating factor is 
e(–3) dx  e–3x. We multiply the equation by this factor and recognize that
e3x dy
dx 2 3e3xy  6e3x is the same as 
d
dx fe3xyg  6e3x.
Integrating both sides of the last equation gives e–3xy  2e–3x  c. Thus a solution of the 
differential equation is y  2  ce3x, q , x , q.
When a1, a0, and g in (1) are constants, the differential equation is autonomous. In Example 1, 
you can verify from the normal form dy/dx  3(y  2) that 2 is a critical point and that it is 
unstable and a repeller. Thus a solution curve with an initial point either above or below the graph 
of the equilibrium solution y  2 pushes away from this horizontal line as x increases.
 Constant of Integration Notice in the general discussion and in Example 1 we disre-
garded a constant of integration in the evaluation of the indefinite integral in the exponent of 
eP(x) dx. If you think about the laws of exponents and the fact that the integrating factor multiplies 
both sides of the differential equation, you should be able to answer why writing P(x) dx  c is 
unnecessary. See Problem 51 in Exercises 2.3.
Guidelines for Solving a Linear First-Order Equation
 (i) Put a linear equation of form (1) into standard form (2) and then determine P(x) and the 
integrating factor eP(x) dx.
 (ii) Multiply (2) by the integrating factor. The left side of the resulting equation is auto-
matically the derivative of the integrating factor and y. Write
 
d
dx feeP(x) dxyg  eeP(x) dx f ( x)
and then integrate both sides of this equation.

 General Solution Suppose again that the functions P and  f  in (2) are continuous on a 
common interval I. In the steps leading to (4) we showed that if (2) has a solution on I, then it must 
be of the form given in (4). Conversely, it is a straightforward exercise in differentiation to verify 
that any function of the form given in (4) is a solution of the differential equation (2) on I. In other 
words, (4) is a one-parameter family of solutions of equation (2), and every solution of (2) defined 
on I is a member of this family. Consequently, we are justified in calling (4) the general solution 
of the differential equation on the interval I. Now by writing (2) in the normal form y  F(x, y) 
we can identify F(x, y)  P(x)y  f (x) and 0F/0y  P(x). From the continuity of P and f on the 
interval I, we see that F and 0F/0y are also continuous on I. With Theorem 1.2.1 as our justification, 
we conclude that there exists one and only one solution of the first-order initial-value problem
 
dy
dx  P(x)y  f (x), y(x0)  y0 
(9)
defined on some interval I0 containing x0. But when x0 is in I, finding a solution of (9) is just a 
matter of finding an appropriate value of c in (4); that is, for each x0 in I there corresponds a 
distinct c. In other words, the interval I0 of existence and uniqueness in Theorem 1.2.1 for the 
initial-value problem (9) is the entire interval I.
EXAMPLE 2 
General Solution
Solve 
x dy
dx 2 4y  x6ex.
SOLUTION By dividing by x we get the standard form
 
dy
dx 2 4
x y  x 5ex. 
(10)
From this form we identify P(x)  4/x and f (x)  x5e x and observe that P and f are con-
tinuous on the interval (0, q). Hence the integrating factor is
 
we can use ln x instead of ln | x | since x  0
 
T
 
e4edx/x  e4 ln x  eln x4  x4.
Here we have used the basic identity blog bN  N, N  0. Now we multiply (10) by x–4,
 
x4 dy
dx 2 4x5y  xex, and obtain 
d
dx fx4yg  xe
 x.
It follows from integration by parts that the general solution defined on (0, q) is x–4y  
xex  ex  c or y  x5e
 x 2 x4e
 x  cx4.
 Singular Points Except in the case when the lead coefficient is 1, the recasting of equa-
tion (1) into the standard form (2) requires division by a1(x). Values of x for which a1(x)  0 are 
called singular points of the equation. Singular points are potentially troublesome. Specifically 
in (2), if P(x) (formed by dividing a0(x) by a1(x)) is discontinuous at a point, the discontinuity 
may carry over to functions in the general solution of the differential equation.
EXAMPLE 3 
General Solution
Find the general solution of 
(x2 2 9) dy
dx  xy  0.
SOLUTION We write the differential equation in standard form
 
dy
dx 
x
x
 2 2 9 y  0 
(11)
and identify P(x)  x/(x2  9). Although P is continuous on (q, 3), on (3, 3), and on 
(3, q), we shall solve the equation on the first and third intervals. On these intervals the

 integrating factor is
e
 ex dx/(x229)  e
 1
2e2x dx/(x229)  e

2  ln |x229|  "x2 2 9.
After multiplying the standard form (11) by this factor, we get
d
dx f "x2 2 9 yg  0 and integrating gives 
"x2 2 9 y  c.
Thus on either (q, 3) or (3, q), the general solution of the equation is y  c/"x2 2 9.
Notice in the preceding example that x  3 and x  3 are singular points of the equation 
and that every function in the general solution y  c/"x2 2 9 is discontinuous at these points. 
On the other hand, x  0 is a singular point of the differential equation in Example 2, but the 
general solution y  x5ex  x4ex  cx4 is noteworthy in that every function in this one-parameter 
family is continuous at x  0 and is defined on the interval (q, q) and not just on (0, q) as 
stated in the solution. However, the family y  x5ex  x4ex  cx4 defined on (q, q) cannot 
be considered the general solution of the DE, since the singular point x  0 still causes a problem. 
See Problems 46 and 47 in Exercises 2.3. We will study singular points for linear differential 
equations in greater depth in Section 5.2.
EXAMPLE 4 
An Initial-Value Problem
Solve the initial-value problem 
dy
dx  y  x, y(0)  4.
SOLUTION The equation is in standard form, and P(x)  1 and f (x)  x are continuous on 
the interval (q, q). The integrating factor is edx  ex, and so integrating
 
d
dx fexyg  xex
gives exy  xex  ex  c. Solving this last equation for y yields the general solution 
y  x  1  ce–x. But from the initial condition we know that y  4 when x  0. Substituting 
these values in the general solution implies c  5. Hence the solution of the problem on the 
interval (q, q) is 
 
y  x  1  5e–x. 
(12)
Recall that the general solution of every linear first-order differential equation is a sum of two 
special solutions: yc , the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation (3), and yp , a 
particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (2). In Example 4 we identify yc  ce–x and 
yp  x  1. FIGURE 2.3.1, obtained with the aid of a graphing utility, shows (12) in blue along with 
other representative solutions in the family y  x  1  ce–x. It is interesting to observe that as 
x gets large, the graphs of all members of the family are close to the graph of yp  x  1, which 
is shown in green in Figure 2.3.1. This is because the contribution of yc  ce–x to the values of a 
solution becomes negligible for increasing values of x. We say that yc  ce–x is a transient 
term since yc S 0 as x S q. While this behavior is not a characteristic of all general solu-
tions of linear equations (see Example 2), the notion of a transient is often important in 
applied problems.
 Piecewise-Linear Differential Equation In the construction of mathematical mod-
els (especially in the biological sciences and engineering) it can happen that one or more coef-
ficients in a differential equation is a piecewise-defined function. In particular, when either P(x) 
or f(x) in (2) is a piecewise-defined function the equation is then referred to as a piecewise-linear 
differential equation. In the next example, f(x) is piecewise continuous on the interval [0, q) 
with a single jump discontinuity at x  1. The basic idea is to solve the initial-value problem in 
two parts corresponding to the two intervals over which f(x) is defined; each part consists of a 
linear equation solvable by the method of this section. As we will see, it is then possible to piece 
the two solutions together at x  1 so that y(x) is continuous on [0, q). See Problems 33–38 
in Exercises 2.3.

EXAMPLE 5 
An Initial-Value Problem
Solve 
dy
dx  y  f (x), y(0)  0 where 
f (x)  e1,
0 # x # 1
0,
x . 1.
SOLUTION The graph of the discontinuous function f is shown in FIGURE 2.3.2. We solve the 
DE for y(x) first on the interval [0, 1] and then on the interval (1, q). For 0  x  1 we have
dy
dx  y  1 or, equivalently, 
d
dx fexyg  ex.
Integrating this last equation and solving for y gives y  1  c1e–x. Since y(0)  0, we must 
have c1  1, and therefore y  1  e–x, 0  x  1. Then for x  1, the equation
 
dy
dx  y  0
leads to y  c2e– x. Hence we can write
y  e1 2 ex,
0 # x # 1
c2ex,
x . 1.
By appealing to the definition of continuity at a point it is possible to determine c2 so that the 
foregoing function is continuous at x  1. The requirement that limxS1  y(x)  y(1) implies 
that c2e–1  1  e–1 or c2  e  1. As seen in FIGURE 2.3.3, the piecewise defined function
 
y  e1 2 ex,
0 # x # 1
(e 2 1) ex,
x . 1
 
(13)
is continuous on the interval [0, q).
It is worthwhile to think about (13) and Figure 2.3.3 a little bit; you are urged to read and 
answer Problem 49 in Exercises 2.3.
 Error Function In mathematics, science, and engineering, some important functions are 
defined in terms of nonelementary integrals. Two such special functions are the error function
and complementary error function:
erf(x) 
2
!p#
x
0
e 2t2dt and erfc(x) 
2
!p#
q
x
e 2t2dt. 
(14)
From the known result eq
0 et2dt  !p>2, we can write (2> !p)eq
0 et2dt  1. Using the additive 
interval property of definite integrals eq
0  ex
0  eq
x  we can rewrite the last result in the alterna-
tive form
 
erf(x) 
erfc( x)

et2 dt 
2
!p#
x
0
et2 dt 
2
!p#
q
x
et2 dt  1. 
(15)
It is seen from (15) that the error function erf(x) and complementary error function erfc(x) are 
related by the identity
erf(x)  erfc(x)  1.
Because of its importance in probability, statistics, and applied partial differential equations, the 
error function has been extensively tabulated. Note that erf(0)  0 is one obvious function value. 
Numerical values of erf(x) can also be found using a CAS such as Mathematica.
If we are solving an initial-value problem (9) and recognize that indefinite integration of the 
right-hand side of (7) would lead to a nonelementary integral, then as we saw in Example 5 of 
Section 2.2 it is convenient to use instead definite integration over the interval [x0, x]. The last example 
illustrates that this procedure automatically incorporates the initial condition at x0 into the solution 
of the DE, in other words, we do not have to solve for the constant c in its general solution.

EXAMPLE 6 
The Error Function
Solve the initial-value problem 
dy
dx 2 2xy  2, y(0)  1.
SOLUTION The differential equation is already in standard form, and so we see that the in-
tegrating factor is e(2x dx)  ex2. Multiplying both sides of the equation by this factor then 
gives ex2
 dy
dx 2 2xex2 y  2ex2 which is the same as
 
d
dx
 fex2 yg  2ex2. 
(16)
Because indefinite integration of both sides of equation (16) leads to the nonelementary inte-
gral eex2 dx, we identify x0  0 and use definite integration over the interval [0, x]:
 
#
x

d

x

et2 dt or ex2 y(x) 2 y(0)  2#

Using the initial condition y(0)  1 the last expression yields the solution
 
y  ex2  2ex2#
x

et2 dt. 
(17)
Then by inserting the factor !p> !p into this solution in the following manner:
 
erf( x)
 
 
y  ex2  2ex2 #
x
0
et2 dt  ex2c1  !p  a 2

we see from (14) that (17) can be rewritten in terms of the error function as
 
y  ex2f1  !p erf(x)g.

The graph of solution (18), shown in FIGURE 2.3.4, was obtained with the aid of a CAS.
See Problems 39–44 in Exercises 2.3.

solutions for some kinds of differential equations. For example, to solve the equation y  2y  x, 
we use the input commands

(in Mathematica)
and 
dsolve(diff(y(x), x) + 2*y(x)  x, y(x));

REMARKS
(i) Occasionally a first-order differential equation is not linear in one variable but is linear in 
the other variable. For example, the differential equation
dy
dx 

x  y2
is not linear in the variable y. But its reciprocal
dx
dy  x  y2 or 
dx
dy 2 x  y2

is recognized as linear in the variable x. You should verify that the integrating factor 
e(–1)dy  e–y and integration by parts yield an implicit solution of the first equation: 
x  y2  2y  2  cey.
(ii) Because mathematicians thought they were appropriately descriptive, certain words were 
“adopted” from engineering and made their own. The word transient, used earlier, is one of 
these terms. In future discussions the words input and output will occasionally pop up. The 
function f in (2) is called the input or driving function; a solution of the differential equation 
for a given input is called the output or response.
In Problems 1–24, find the general solution of the given differ-
ential equation. Give the largest interval over which the general 
solution is defined. Determine whether there are any transient

Theorem 2.4.1 shows that the equality of these partial derivatives is no coincidence.

2.4 Exact Equations
INTRODUCTION Although the simple differential equation y dx  x dy  0 is separable, we 
can solve it in an alternative manner by recognizing that the left-hand side is equivalent to the 
differential of the product of x and y; that is, y dx  x dy  d(xy). By integrating both sides of the 
equation we immediately obtain the implicit solution xy  c.
 Differential of a Function of Two Variables If z  f (x, y) is a function of two 
variables with continuous first partial derivatives in a region R of the xy-plane, then its differential 
(also called the total differential) is
 
dz  0f
0x dx  0f
0y dy. 
(1)
Now if f (x, y)  c, it follows from (1) that
 
0f
0x dx  0f
0y dy  0. 
(2)
In other words, given a one-parameter family of curves f (x, y)  c, we can generate a first-order dif-
ferential equation by computing the differential. For example, if x2  5xy  y3  c, then (2) gives
 
(2x  5y) dx  (5x  3y2) dy  0. 
(3)
For our purposes it is more important to turn the problem around; namely, given a first-order DE 
such as (3), can we recognize that it is equivalent to the differential d(x2  5xy  y3)  0?
Definition 2.4.1 
Exact Equation
A differential expression M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy is an exact differential in a region R of the 
xy-plane if it corresponds to the differential of some function f (x, y). A first-order differential 
equation of the form
 
M(x, y)  dx  N(x, y)  dy  0
is said to be an exact equation if the expression on the left side is an exact differential.
Theorem 2.4.1 
Criterion for an Exact Differential
Let M(x, y) and N(x, y) be continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in a rect-
angular region R defined by a 	 x 	 b, c 	 y 	 d. Then a necessary and sufficient condition 
that M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy be an exact differential is
 
0M
0y  0N
0x .

| CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
PROOF: (Proof of the Necessity) For simplicity let us assume that M(x, y) and N(x, y) have 
continuous first partial derivatives for all (x, y). Now if the expression M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy is 
exact, there exists some function f such that for all x in R,
 
M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  0f
0x dx  0f
0y dy.
Therefore, 
M(x, y)  0f
0x, 
N(x, y)  0f
0y, 
and 
0M
0y  0
0y a 0f
0xb 
02f
0y 0x  0
0x a 0f
0yb  0N
0x .
The equality of the mixed partials is a consequence of the continuity of the first partial 
derivatives of M(x, y) and N(x, y).
The sufficiency part of Theorem 2.4.1 consists of showing that there exists a function f for 
which 0f/0x  M(x, y) and 0f/0y  N(x, y) whenever (4) holds. The construction of the function f 
actually reflects a basic procedure for solving exact equations.
 Method of Solution Given an equation of the form M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  0, deter-
mine whether the equality in (4) holds. If it does, then there exists a function f for which
 
0f
0x  M(x, y).
We can find f by integrating M(x, y) with respect to x, while holding y constant:
 
f (x, y)  #M(x, y) dx  g(y), 
(5)
where the arbitrary function g(y) is the “constant” of integration. Now differentiate (5) with re-
spect to y and assume 0f/0y  N(x, y):
 
0f
0y  0
0y#M(x, y) dx  g9(y)  N(x, y).
This gives 
g9(y)  N(x, y) 2 0
0y#M(x, y) dx. 
(6)
Finally, integrate (6) with respect to y and substitute the result in (5). The implicit solution of the 
equation is f (x, y)  c.
Some observations are in order. First, it is important to realize that the expression 
N(x, y)  (0/0 y)  M(x, y) dx in (6) is independent of x, because
 
0
0x cN(x, y) 2 0
0y#M(x, y) dxd  0N
0x 2 0
0y a 0
0x#M(x, y) dxb  0N
0x 2 0M
0y  0.
Second, we could just as well start the foregoing procedure with the assumption that 
0f/0y  N(x, y). After integrating N with respect to y and then differentiating that result, we would 
find the analogues of (5) and (6) to be, respectively,
 
f (x, y)  #N(x, y) dy  h(x) and 
h9(x)  M(x, y) 2 0
0x#N(x, y) dy.
If you find that integration of 0f /0 x  M(x, y) with respect to x is difficult, then try 
integrating 0f /0 y  N(x, y) with respect to y. In either case none of these formulas should 
be memorized.

EXAMPLE 1 
Solving an Exact DE
Solve 2xy dx  (x2  1) dy  0.
SOLUTION With M(x, y)  2xy and N(x, y)  x2  1 we have
0M
0y  2x  0N
0x .
Thus the equation is exact, and so, by Theorem 2.4.1, there exists a function f (x, y) such that
 
0f
0x  2xy and 
0f
0y  x2 2 1.
From the first of these equations we obtain, after integrating,
 
f (x, y)  x2y  g(y).
Taking the partial derivative of the last expression with respect to y and setting the result equal 
to N(x, y) gives
 
0f
0y  x2  g9(y)  x2 2 1. d N(x, y)
It follows that 
g(y)  1 and g(y)  y.
Hence, f (x, y)  x2y  y, and so the solution of the equation in implicit form is x2y  y  c. 
The explicit form of the solution is easily seen to be y  c/(x2  1) and is defined on any in-
terval not containing either x  1 or x  1.
The solution of the DE in Example 1 is not f (x, y)  x2y  y. Rather it is f (x, y)  c; or if a 
constant is used in the integration of g(y), we can then write the solution as f (x, y)  0. Note, 
too, that the equation could be solved by separation of variables.
EXAMPLE 2 
Solving an Exact DE
Solve (e2y  y cos xy) dx  (2xe2y  x cos xy  2y) dy  0.
SOLUTION The equation is exact because
 
0M
0y  2e2y  xy sin xy 2
 cos xy  0N
0x .
Hence a function f (x, y) exists for which
 
M(x, y)  0f
0x and 
N(x, y)  0f
0y.
Now for variety we shall start with the assumption that 0f/0y  N(x, y);
that is, 
0f
0y  2xe2y 2 x cos xy  2y
 
f (x, y)  2x#e2y
 dy 2 x#
 cos xy dy  2#y dy  h(x)
Remember, the reason x can come out in front of the symbol  is that in the integration with 
respect to y, x is treated as an ordinary constant. It follows that
 
f (x,  y)  xe2y 2
 sin xy  y2  h(x)
 
0f
0x  e2y 2 y cos xy  h9(x)  e2y 2 y cos xy d M(x, y)
and so h(x)  0 or h(x)  c. Hence a family of solutions is
 
xe2y  sin xy  y2  c  0.
Note the form of the 
solution. It is f (x, y)  c.

EXAMPLE 3 
An Initial-Value Problem
Solve the initial-value problem 
dy
dx  xy2 2
 cos x sin x
y(1 2 x2)
, y(0)  2.
SOLUTION By writing the differential equation in the form
 
(cos x sin x  xy2) dx  y(1  x2) dy  0
we recognize that the equation is exact because
0M
0y  2xy  0N
0x .
Now 
0f
0y  y(1 2 x2)
f (x, y)  y2
2
 (1 2 x2)  h(x)
0f
0x  xy2  h9(x) 
 cos x sin x 2 xy2.
The last equation implies that h(x)  cos x sin x. Integrating gives
h(x)  #( cos x)( sin x dx)  1
2
 cos 2x.
Thus 
y2
2  (1 2 x2) 2 1
2 cos 2x  c1 or 
y2(1 2 x2) 2
 cos 2x  c, 
(7)
where 2c1 has been replaced by c. The initial condition y  2 when x  0 demands that 
4(1)  cos2 (0)  c and so c  3. An implicit solution of the problem is then 
y2(1 2 x2) 2
 cos2
 x  3.
The solution curve of the IVP is part of an interesting family of curves and is the curve drawn 
in blue in FIGURE 2.4.1. The graphs of the members of the one-parameter family of solutions given 
in (7) can be obtained in several ways, two of which are using software to graph level curves 
as discussed in the last section, or using a graphing utility and carefully graphing the explicit 
functions obtained for various values of c by solving y2  (c  cos2 x)/(1  x2) for y.
 Integrating Factors Recall from the last section that the left-hand side of the linear 
equation y  P(x)y  f (x) can be transformed into a derivative when we multiply the equation 
by an integrating factor. The same basic idea sometimes works for a nonexact differential equa-
tion M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  0. That is, it is sometimes possible to find an integrating factor 
µ(x, y) so that after multiplying, the left-hand side of
 
µ(x, y)M(x, y) dx  µ(x, y)N(x, y) dy  0 
(8)
is an exact differential. In an attempt to find µ we turn to the criterion (4) for exactness. Equation (8) 
is exact if and only if ( µM)y  ( µN)x, where the subscripts denote partial derivatives. By the 
Product Rule of differentiation the last equation is the same as µMy  µy M  µNx  µx N or
 
µxN  µyM  (My  Nx)µ. 
(9)
Although M, N, My, Nx are known functions of x and y, the difficulty here in determining the 
unknown µ(x, y) from (9) is that we must solve a partial differential equation. Since we are not 
prepared to do that we make a simplifying assumption. Suppose µ is a function of one variable; 
say that µ depends only upon x. In this case µx  du/dx and (9) can be written as
dµ
dx 
My 2 Nx
N
 µ. 
(10)
We are still at an impasse if the quotient (My  Nx)/N depends upon both x and y. However, if 
after all obvious algebraic simplifications are made, the quotient (My  Nx)/N turns out to depend 
FIGURE 2.4.1 Some solution curves in the 
family (7) of Example 3

solely on the variable x, then (10) is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can finally 
determine µ because (10) is separable as well as linear. It follows from either Section 2.2 or 
Section 2.3 that µ(x)  ee((My2Nx)>N ) dx. In like manner it  follows from (9) that if µ depends only 
on the variable y, then
 
dµ
dy 
Nx 2 My
M
 µ. 
(11)
In this case, if (Nx  My)/M is a function of y, only then we can solve (11) for µ.
We summarize the results for the differential equation
 
M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  0. 
(12)
• If (My  Nx)/N is a function of x alone, then an integrating factor for equation (12) is
 
µ(x)  ee 
My2Nx

(13)
• If (Nx  My)/M is a function of y alone, then an integrating factor for equation (12) is

(14)
EXAMPLE 4 
A Nonexact DE Made Exact
The nonlinear first-order differential equation xy dx  (2x2  3y2  20) dy  0 is not exact. 
With the identifications M  xy, N  2x2  3y2  20 we find the partial derivatives My  x 
and Nx  4x. The first quotient from (13) gets us nowhere since
 
My 2 Nx
N

x 2 4x
2x2  3y2 2 20 
3x
2x2  3y2 2 20
depends on x and y. However (14) yields a quotient that depends only on y:
 
Nx 2 My
M
 4x 2 x
xy
 3x
xy  3
y.
The integrating factor is then e3 dy/y  e3 ln y  eln y3  y3. After multiplying the given DE by 
µ(y)  y3 the resulting equation is
 
xy4 dx  (2x2y3  3y5  20y3) dy  0.
You should verify that the last equation is now exact as well as show, using the method of this 
section, that a family of solutions is 1
2 x2y4  1
2 y6 2 5y4  c.
REMARKS
(i) When testing an equation for exactness, make sure it is of the precise form M(x, y) dx  
N(x, y) dy  0. Sometimes a differential equation is written G(x, y) dx  H(x, y) dy. In this 
case, first rewrite it as G(x, y) dx  H(x, y) dy  0, and then identify M(x, y)  G(x, y) and 
N(x, y)  H(x, y) before using (4).
(ii) In some texts on differential equations the study of exact equations precedes that of linear 
DEs. If this were so, the method for finding integrating factors just discussed can be used to 
derive an integrating factor for y  P(x)y  f (x). By rewriting the last equation in the dif-
ferential form (P(x)y  f (x)) dx  dy  0 we see that
My 2 Nx
N
 P(x).
From (13) we arrive at the already familiar integrating factor eP(x) dx used in Section 2.3.

2.5 Solutions by Substitutions
INTRODUCTION We usually solve a differential equation by recognizing it as a certain 
kind of equation (say, separable) and then carrying out a procedure, consisting of equation-
specific mathematical steps, that yields a function that satisfies the equation. Often the first 
step in solving a given differential equation consists of transforming it into another differential 
equation by means of a substitution. For example, suppose we wish to transform the first-
order equation dy/dx  f (x, y) by the substitution y  g(x, u), where u is regarded as a function 
of the variable x.
If g possesses first-partial derivatives, then the Chain Rule gives
 
dy
dx  gx(x, u)  gu(x, u) du
dx.
By replacing dy/dx by f (x, y) and y by g(x, u) in the foregoing derivative, we get the new first-
order differential equation
 
f (x, g(x, u))  gx(x, u)  gu(x, u) du
dx, 
which, after solving for du/dx, has the form du/dx  F(x, u). If we can determine a solution u  f(x) 
of this second equation, then a solution of the original differential equation is y  g(x, f(x)).

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
 Homogeneous Equations If a function f possesses the property f (tx, ty)  t a f (x, y) 
for some real number a, then f is said to be a homogeneous function of degree a. For example, 
f (x, y)  x3  y3 is a homogeneous function of degree 3 since
 
f (tx, ty)  (tx)3  (ty)3  t3(x3  y3)  t3f (x, y),
whereas f (x, y)  x3  y3  1 is seen not to be homogeneous. A first-order DE in differential 
form
 
M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  0 
(1)
is said to be homogeneous if both coefficients M and N are homogeneous functions of the same
degree. In other words, (1) is homogeneous if
 
M(tx, ty)  taM(x, y)  and  N(tx, ty)  taN(x, y).
The word homogeneous as used here does not mean the same as it does when applied to linear 
differential equations. See Sections 2.3 and 3.1.
If M and N are homogeneous functions of degree a, we can also write
 
M(x, y)  xaM(1, u) 
and 
N(x, y)  xaN(1, u) 
where u  y/x, 
(2)
and 
M(x, y)  yaM(v, 1) 
and 
N(x, y)  yaN(v, 1) 
where v  x/y. 
(3)
See Problem 31 in Exercises 2.5. Properties (2) and (3) suggest the substitutions that can be used 
to solve a homogeneous differential equation. Specifically, either of the substitutions y  ux or 
x  vy, where u and v are new dependent variables, will reduce a homogeneous equation to a 
separable first-order differential equation. To show this, observe that as a consequence of (2) a 
homogeneous equation M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  0 can be rewritten as
 
xa M(1, u) dx  xa N(1, u) dy  0  or  M(1, u) dx  N(1, u) dy  0,
where u  y/x or y  ux. By substituting the differential dy  u dx  x du into the last equation 
and gathering terms, we obtain a separable DE in the variables u and x:
 
   M(1, u) dx  N(1, u)[u dx  x du]  0
 
[M(1, u)  uN(1, u)] dx  xN(1, u) du  0
or 
     
dx
x 
N(1, u) du
M(1, u)  uN(1, u)  0.
We hasten to point out that the preceding formula should not be memorized; rather, the procedure
should be worked through each time. The proof that the substitutions x  vy and dx  v dy  y dv
also lead to a separable equation follows in an analogous manner from (3).
A linear ﬁ rst-order DE

g(x) = 0.
EXAMPLE 1 
Solving a Homogeneous DE
Solve (x2  y2) dx  (x2  xy) dy  0.
SOLUTION Inspection of M(x, y)  x2  y2 and N(x, y)  x2  xy shows that these coeffi-
cients are homogeneous functions of degree 2. If we let y  ux, then dy  u dx  x du so that, 
after substituting, the given equation becomes
 
(x2  u2x2) dx  (x2  ux2)[u dx  x du]  0

Although either of the indicated substitutions can be used for every homogeneous differ-
ential equation, in practice we try x  vy whenever the function M(x, y) is simpler than N(x, y). 
Also it could happen that after using one substitution, we may encounter integrals that are 
difficult or impossible to evaluate in closed form; switching substitutions may result in an 
easier problem.
 Bernoulli’s Equation The differential equation
 
 dy
dx  P(x)y  f (x)yn, 
(4)
where n is any real number, is called Bernoulli’s equation and is named after the Swiss math-
ematican Jacob Bernoulli (1654 –1705). Note that for n  0 and n  1, equation (4) is linear. 
For n  0 and n  1, the substitution u  y1n reduces any equation of form (4) to a 
linear equation.

gives x–1u  x  c or u  x2  cx. Since u  y–1 we have y  1/u, and so a solution of 
the given equation is y  1/(x2  cx).
Note that we have not obtained the general solution of the original nonlinear differential equa-
tion in Example 2, since y  0 is a singular solution of the equation.

back to this equation and solve it by an alternative method in 
Section 2.8, solve the DE this first time using the fact that it 
is a Bernoulli equation.
2.6 A Numerical Method
INTRODUCTION In Section 2.1 we saw that we could glean qualitative information from a 
first-order DE about its solutions even before we attempted to solve the equation. In Sections 2.2–2.5 
we examined first-order DEs analytically; that is, we developed procedures for actually obtain-
ing explicit and implicit solutions. But many differential equations possess solutions and yet 
these solutions cannot be obtained analytically. In this case we “solve” the differential equation 
numerically; this means that the DE is used as the cornerstone of an algorithm for approximating 

70 
| CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
the unknown solution. It is common practice to refer to the algorithm as a numerical method, 
the approximate solution as a numerical solution, and the graph of a numerical solution as a 
numerical solution curve.
In this section we are going to consider only the simplest of numerical methods. A more ex-
tensive treatment of this subject is found in Chapter 6.
 Using the Tangent Line Let us assume that the first-order initial-value problem
 
y  f (x, y), y(x0)  y0 
(1)
possesses a solution. One of the simplest techniques for approximating this solution is to 
use tangent lines. For example, let y(x) denote the unknown solution of the first-order 
 initial-value problem y9  0.1!y  0.4x2, y(2)  4. The nonlinear differential equation 
cannot be solved directly by the methods considered in Sections 2.2, 2.4, and 2.5; neverthe-
less we can still find approximate numerical values of the unknown y(x). Specifically, suppose 
we wish to know the value of y(2.5). The IVP has a solution, and, as the flow of the direction 
field in FIGURE 2.6.1(a) suggests, a solution curve must have a shape similar to the curve shown 
in blue.

(b) Lineal element at (2, 4)

–4
The direction field in Figure 2.6.1(a) was generated so that the lineal elements pass through 
points in a grid with integer coordinates. As the solution curve passes through the initial point 
(2, 4), the lineal element at this point is a tangent line with slope given by f (2, 4)  0.1 !4  
0.4(2)2  1.8. As is apparent in Figure 2.6.1(a) and the “zoom in” in Figure 2.6.1(b), when x is 
close to 2 the points on the solution curve are close to the points on the tangent line (the lineal 
element). Using the point (2, 4), the slope f (2, 4)  1.8, and the point-slope form of a line, we 
find that an equation of the tangent line is y  L(x), where L(x)  1.8x  0.4. This last equation, 
called a linearization of y(x) at x  2, can be used to approximate values y(x) within a small 
neighborhood of x  2. If y1  L(x1) denotes the value of the y-coordinate on the tangent line 
and y(x1) is the y-coordinate on the solution curve corresponding to an x-coordinate x1 that is 
close to x  2, then y(x1)  y1. If we choose, say, x1  2.1, then y1  L(2.1)  1.8(2.1)  0.4  4.18, 
and so y(2.1)  4.18.
 Euler’s Method To generalize the procedure just illustrated, we use the linearization of 
the unknown solution y(x) of (1) at x  x0:
 
L(x)  f (x0, y0)(x  x0)  y0. 
(2)
The graph of this linearization is a straight line tangent to the graph of y  y(x) at the point 
(x0, y0). We now let h be a positive increment of the x-axis, as shown in FIGURE 2.6.2. Then by 
replacing x by x1  x0  h in (2) we get
 
L(x1)  f (x0, y0)(x0  h  x0)  y0  or  y1  y0  hf (x0, y0),
where y1  L(x1). The point (x1, y1) on the tangent line is an approximation to the point 
(x1, y(x1)) on the solution curve. Of course the accuracy of the approximation y1  y(x1)

 depends heavily on the size of the increment h. Usually we must choose this step size to 
be “reasonably small.” We now repeat the process using a second “tangent line” at (x1, y1).*
By replacing (x0, y0) in the above discussion with the new starting point (x1, y1), we 
obtain an approximation y2  y(x2) corresponding to two steps of length h from x0, that is, 
x2  x1  h  x0  2h and
 
y(x2)  y(x0  2h)  y(x1  h)  y2  y1  hf (x1, y1).
Continuing in this manner, we see that y1, y2, y3, . . . , can be defined recursively by the 
general formula
 
yn  1  yn  hf (xn, yn), 
(3)
where xn  x0  nh, n  0, 1, 2, . . . . This procedure of using successive “tangent lines” is called 
Euler’s method.
EXAMPLE 1 
Euler’s Method
Consider the initial-value problem y  0.1 !y  0.4x2, y(2)  4. Use Euler’s method to 
obtain an approximation to y(2.5) using first h  0.1 and then h  0.05.
SOLUTION With the identification f (x, y)  0.1 !y  0.4x2, (3) becomes
 
yn1  yn  h(0.1"yn  0.4x2
n).
Then for h  0.1, x0  2, y0  4, and n  0, we find
 
y1  y0  h(0.1"y0  0.4x2
0)  4  0.1(0.1"4  0.4(2)2)  4.18,
which, as we have already seen, is an estimate to the value of y(2.1). However, if we use the 
smaller step size h  0.05, it takes two steps to reach x  2.1. From
 
y1  4  0.05(0.1 !4  0.4(2)2)  4.09
 
y2  4.09  0.05(0.1 !4.09  0.4(2.05)2)  4.18416187
we have y1  y(2.05) and y2  y(2.1). The remainder of the calculations were carried out 
 using software; the results are summarized in Tables 2.6.1 and 2.6.2. We see in Tables 2.6.1 
and 2.6.2 that it takes five steps with h  0.1 and ten steps with h  0.05, respectively, to get 
to x  2.5. Also, each entry has been rounded to four decimal places.
In Example 2 we apply Euler’s method to a differential equation for which we have already 
found a solution. We do this to compare the values of the approximations yn at each step with the 
true values of the solution y(xn) of the initial-value problem.
EXAMPLE 2 
Comparison of Approximate and Exact Values
Consider the initial-value problem y  0.2xy, y(1)  1. Use Euler’s method to obtain an 
 approximation to y(1.5) using first h  0.1 and then h  0.05.
SOLUTION With the identification f (x, y)  0.2xy, (3) becomes
 
yn  1  yn  h(0.2xn  yn),
where x0  1 and y0  1. Again with the aid of computer software we obtain the values in 
Tables 2.6.3 and 2.6.4.

By comparing the last two columns in Tables 2.6.3 and 2.6.4, it is clear that the accuracy of the 
approximations improve as the step size h decreases. Also, we see that even though the percent-
age relative error is growing with each step, it does not appear to be that bad. But you should not 
be deceived by one example. If we simply change the coefficient of the right side of the DE in 
Example 2 from 0.2 to 2, then at xn  1.5 the percentage relative errors increase dramatically. 
See Problem 4 in Exercises 2.6.
 A Caveat Euler’s method is just one of many different ways a solution of a differential 
equation can be approximated. Although attractive for its simplicity, Euler’s method is seldom 
used in serious calculations. We have introduced this topic simply to give you a first taste of 
numerical methods. We will go into greater detail and discuss methods that give significantly 
greater accuracy, notably the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, in Chapter 6. We shall refer 
to this important numerical method as the RK4 method.
 Numerical Solvers Regardless of whether we can actually find an explicit or implicit 
solution, if a solution of a differential equation exists, it represents a smooth curve in the 
Cartesian plane. The basic idea behind any numerical method for ordinary differential equa-
tions is to somehow approximate the y-values of a solution for preselected values of x. We start 
at a specified initial point (x0, y0) on a solution curve and proceed to calculate in a step-by-step 
fashion a sequence of points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn) whose y-coordinates yi approximate 
the y-coordinates y(xi) of points (x1, y(x1)), (x2, y(x2)), . . . , (xn, y(xn)) that lie on the graph of 
the usually unknown solution y(x). By taking the x-coordinates close together (that is, for small 
values of h) and by joining the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn) with short line segments, 
we obtain a polygonal curve that appears smooth and whose qualitative characteristics we hope 
are close to those of an actual solution curve. Drawing curves is something well suited to a 
computer. A computer program written to either implement a numerical method or to render 
a visual representation of an approximate solution curve fitting the numerical data produced

numerical approximations, whereas others generate both hard numerical data as well as the 
corresponding approximate or numerical solution curves. As an illustration of the connect-
the-dots nature of the graphs produced by a numerical solver, the two red polygonal graphs in 
FIGURE 2.6.3 are numerical solution curves for the initial-value problem y  0.2xy, y(0)  1, 
on the interval [0, 4] obtained from Euler’s method and the RK4 method using the step size 
h  1. The blue smooth curve is the graph of the exact solution y  e0.1x2 of the IVP. Notice 
in Figure 2.6.3 that even with the ridiculously large step size of h  1, the RK4 method pro-
duces the more believable “solution curve.” The numerical solution curve obtained from the 
RK4 method is indistinguishable from the actual solution curve on the interval [0, 4] when a 
more typical step size of h  0.1 is used.
 Using a Numerical Solver Knowledge of the various numerical methods is not 
necessary in order to use a numerical solver. A solver usually requires that the differential 
equation be expressed in normal form dy/dx  f (x, y). Numerical solvers that generate 
only curves usually require that you supply f (x, y) and the initial data x0 and y0 and 
specify the desired numerical method. If the idea is to approximate the numerical value 
of y(a), then a solver may additionally require that you state a value for h, or, equivalently, 
require the number of steps that you want to take to get from x  x0 to x  a. For example, 
if we want to approximate y(4) for the IVP illustrated in Figure 2.6.3, then, starting at 
x  0, it takes four steps to reach x  4 with a step size of h  1; 40 steps is equivalent to 
a step size of h  0.1. Although it is not our intention here to delve into the many problems 
that one can encounter when attempting to approximate mathematical quantities, you 
should be at least aware of the fact that a numerical solver may break down near certain 
points or give an incomplete or misleading picture when applied to some first-order dif-
ferential equations in the normal form. FIGURE 2.6.4 illustrates the numerical solution curve 
obtained by applying Euler’s method to a certain first-order initial value problem 
dy/dx  f (x, y), y(0)  1. Equivalent results were obtained using three different commer-
cial numerical solvers, yet the graph is hardly a plausible solution curve. (Why?) There 
are several avenues of recourse when a numerical solver has difficulties; three of the more 
obvious are decrease the step size, use another numerical method, or try a different 
numerical solver.

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
2.7 
Linear Models
INTRODUCTION In this section we solve some of the linear first-order models that were 
introduced in Section 1.3.
 Growth and Decay The initial-value problem
dx
dt  kx, 
x(t0)  x0, 
(1)
where k is the constant of proportionality, serves as a model for diverse phenomena involving ei-
ther growth or decay. We have seen in Section 1.3 that in biology, over short periods of time, 
the rate of growth of certain populations (bacteria, small animals) is observed to be proportional 
to the population present at time t. If a population at some arbitrary initial time t0 is known, 
then the solution of (1) can be used to predict the population in the future—that is, at times t  t0. 
The constant of proportionality k in (1) can be determined from the solution of the initial-value 
problem using a subsequent measurement of x at some time t1  t0. In physics and chemistry, (1) 
is seen in the form of a first-order reaction, that is, a reaction whose rate or velocity dx/dt is di-
rectly proportional to the first power of the reactant concentration x at time t. The decomposition 
or decay of U-238 (uranium) by radioactivity into Th-234 (thorium) is a first-order reaction.
EXAMPLE 1 
Bacterial Growth
A culture initially has P0 number of bacteria. At t  1 h the number of bacteria is measured 
to be 3
2 P0. If the rate of growth is proportional to the number of bacteria P(t) present at 
time t, determine the time necessary for the number of bacteria to triple.
SOLUTION  We first solve the differential equation in (1) with the symbol x replaced by P. 
With t0  0 the initial condition is P(0)  P0. We then use the empirical observation that 
P(1)  3
2 P0 to determine the constant of proportionality k.
Notice that the differential equation dP/dt  kP is both separable and linear. When it is put 
in the standard form of a linear first-order DE,
 
dP
dt 2 kP  0,
we can see by inspection that the integrating factor is e–kt. Multiplying both sides of the equa-
tion by this term immediately gives
 
d
dt fektPg  0.
Integrating both sides of the last equation yields e–ktP  c or P(t)  cekt. At t  0 it follows that 
P0  ce0  c, and so P(t)  P0ekt. At t  1 we have 3
2 P0  P0ek or ek  3
2 . From the last equation 
we get k  ln 3
2  0.4055. Thus P(t)  P0e0.4055t. To find the time at which the number of bac-
teria has tripled, we solve 3P0  P0e0.4055t for t. It follows that 0.4055t  ln 3, and so
 
t 
ln 3
0.4055 < 2.71 h.
See FIGURE 2.7.1.
Notice in Example 1 that the actual number P0 of bacteria present at time t  0 played no part 
in determining the time required for the number in the culture to triple. The time necessary for 
an initial population of, say, 100 or 1,000,000 bacteria to triple is still approximately 2.71 hours.
As shown in FIGURE 2.7.2, the exponential function ekt increases as t increases for k  0 and 
decreases as t increases for k  0. Thus problems describing growth (whether of populations, 
bacteria, or even capital) are characterized by a positive value of k, whereas problems involving 
decay (as in radioactive disintegration) yield a negative k value. Accordingly, we say that k is 
either a growth constant (k  0) or a decay constant (k  0).

 Half-Life In physics the half-life is a measure of the stability of a radioactive substance. The 
half-life is simply the time it takes for one-half of the atoms in an initial amount A0 to disintegrate, 
or transmute, into the atoms of another element. The longer the half-life of a substance, the more 
stable it is. For example, the half-life of highly radioactive radium, Ra-226, is about 1700 years. In 
1700 years one-half of a given quantity of Ra-226 is transmuted into radon, Rn-222. The most 
commonly occurring uranium isotope, U-238, has a half-life of approximately 4,500,000,000 years. 
In about 4.5 billion years, one-half of a quantity of U-238 is transmuted into lead, Pb-206.
EXAMPLE 2 
Half-Life of Plutonium
A breeder reactor converts relatively stable uranium-238 into the isotope plutonium-239. After 
15 years it is determined that 0.043% of the initial amount A0 of the plutonium has disinte-
grated. Find the half-life of this isotope if the rate of disintegration is proportional to the 
amount remaining.
SOLUTION  Let A(t) denote the amount of plutonium remaining at any time. As in Example 1, 
the solution of the initial-value problem
 
dA
dt  kA, 
A(0)  A0, 
(2)
is A(t)  A0ekt. If 0.043% of the atoms of A0 have disintegrated, then 99.957% of the substance 
remains. To find the decay constant k, we use 0.99957A0  A(15); that is, 0.99957A0  A0e15k. 
Solving for k then gives k  1
15 ln 0.99957  0.00002867. Hence A(t)  A0e0.00002867t. Now 
the half-life is the corresponding value of time at which A(t)  1
2 A0. Solving for t gives 
1
2 A0  A0e–0.00002867t or 1
2  e–0.00002867t. The last equation yields
 
t 
ln 2
0.00002867 < 24,180 years.
 Carbon Dating About 1950, a team of scientists at the University of Chicago led by the 
American physical chemist Willard F. Libby (1908–1980) devised a method using a radioactive 
isotope of carbon as a means of determining the approximate ages of carbonaceous fossilized mat-
ter. The theory of carbon dating is based on the fact that the radioisotope carbon-14 is produced in 
the atmosphere by the action of cosmic radiation on nitrogen-14. The ratio of the amount of C-14 
to the stable C-12 in the atmosphere appears to be a constant, and as a consequence the proportion-
ate amount of the isotope present in all living organisms is the same as that in the atmosphere. When 
a living organism dies, the absorption of C-14, by breathing, eating, or photosynthesis, ceases. Thus 
by comparing the proportionate amount of C-14, say, in a fossil with the constant amount ratio 
found in the atmosphere, it is possible to obtain a reasonable estimation of its age. The method is 
based on the knowledge of the half-life of C-14. Libby’s calculated value for the half-life of C-14 
was approximately 5600 years and is called the Libby half-life. Today the commonly accepted 
value for the half-life of C-14 is the Cambridge half-life that is close to 5730 years. For his work, 
Libby was award the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1960. Libby’s method has been used to date 
wooden furniture in Egyptian tombs, the woven flax wrappings of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the 
cloth of the enigmatic Shroud of Turin. 
EXAMPLE 3 
Age of a Fossil
A fossilized bone is found to contain 0.1% of its original amount of C-14. Determine the age 
of the fossil.
SOLUTION  As in Example 2 the starting point is A(t)  A0ekt. To determine the value of the 
decay constant k we use the fact that 1
2A0  A(5730) or 1
2A0  A0e5730k. The last equation 
implies 5730k  ln 1
2  ln 2 and so we get k  (ln 2)/5730  0.00012097. Therefore 
A(t)  A0e0.00012097t. With A(t)  0.001A0 we have 0.001A0  A0e–0.00012097t and 0.00012097t  
ln (0.001)  ln 1000. Thus
 
t 
ln 1000
0.00012097 < 57,103 years.

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
The date found in Example 3 is really at the border of accuracy of this method. The usual 
carbon-14 technique is limited to about 10 half-lives of the isotope, or roughly 60,000 years. One 
fundamental reason for this limitation is the relatively short half-life of C-14. There are other 
problems as well; the chemical analysis needed to obtain an accurate measurement of the remain-
ing C-14 becomes somewhat formidable around the point 0.001A0. Moreover, this analysis requires 
the destruction of a rather large sample of the specimen. If this measurement is accomplished 
indirectly, based on the actual radioactivity of the specimen, then it is very difficult to distinguish 
between the radiation from the specimen and the normal background radiation. But recently the 
use of a particle accelerator has enabled scientists to separate the C-14 from the stable C-12 
directly. When the precise value of the ratio of C-14 to C-12 is computed, the accuracy can be 
extended to 70,000–100,000 years. For these reasons and the fact that the C-14 dating is restricted 
to organic materials this method is used mainly by archaeologists. On the other hand, geologists 
who are interested in questions about the age of rocks or the age of the Earth use radiometric 
dating techniques. Radiometric dating, invented by the physicist/chemist Ernest Rutherford 
(1871–1937) around 1905, is based on the radioactive decay of a naturally occurring radioactive 
isotope with a very long half-life and a comparison between a measured quantity of this decaying 
isotope and one of its decay products, using known decay rates. Radiometric methods using 
potassium-argon, rubidium-strontium, or uranium-lead can give dates of certain kinds of rocks 
of several billion years. See Problems 5 and 6 in Exercises 2.9 for a discussion of the potassium-
argon method of dating.
 Newton’s Law of Cooling / Warming In equation (3) of Section 1.3 we saw that the 
mathematical formulation of Newton’s empirical law of cooling of an object is given by the 
linear first-order differential equation
dT
dt  k(T 2 Tm), 
(3)
where k is a constant of proportionality, T(t) is the temperature of the object for t  0, and Tm is 
the ambient temperature—that is, the temperature of the medium around the object. In Example 4 
we assume that Tm is constant.
EXAMPLE 4 
Cooling of a Cake
When a cake is removed from an oven, its temperature is measured at 300F. Three minutes 
later its temperature is 200F. How long will it take for the cake to cool off to a room tem-
perature of 70F?
SOLUTION  In (3) we make the identification Tm  70. We must then solve the initial-value 
problem
 
dT
dt  k(T 2 70), 
T(0)  300 
(4)
and determine the value of k so that T(3)  200.
Equation (4) is both linear and separable. Separating variables,
 
dT
T 2 70  k dt,
yields ln | T  70 |  kt  c1, and so T  70  c2ekt. When t  0, T  300, so that 300  70  c2
gives c2  230, and, therefore, T  70  230ekt. Finally, the measurement T(3)  200 leads 
to e3k  13
23 or k  1
3 ln 13
23  0.19018. Thus
 
T(t)  70  230e–0.19018t. 
(5)
We note that (5) furnishes no finite solution to T(t)  70 since limtSq T(t)  70. Yet intuitively 
we expect the cake to reach the room temperature after a reasonably long period of time. How 
long is “long”? Of course, we should not be disturbed by the fact that the model (4) does not 
quite live up to our physical intuition. Parts (a) and (b) of FIGURE 2.7.3 clearly show that the 
cake will be approximately at room temperature in about one-half hour.
The size and location of the sample 
caused major difﬁ culties when a team of 
scientists were invited to use carbon-14 
dating on the Shroud of Turin in 1988. 
See Problem 12 in Exercises 2.7.
The half-life of uranium-238 
is 4.47 billion years.

 Mixtures The mixing of two fluids sometimes gives rise to a linear first-order differential 
equation. When we discussed the mixing of two brine solutions in Section 1.3, we assumed that 
the rate x(t) at which the amount of salt in the mixing tank changes was a net rate:
dx
dt  ainput rate
of salt b 2 aoutput rate
of salt
b  Rin 2 Rout. 
(6)
In Example 5 we solve equation (8) of Section 1.3.
EXAMPLE 5 
Mixture of Two Salt Solutions
Recall that the large tank considered in Section 1.3 held 300 gallons of a brine solution. 
Salt was entering and leaving the tank; a brine solution was being pumped into the tank at 
the rate of 3 gal/min, mixed with the solution there, and then the mixture was pumped out 
at the rate of 3 gal/min. The concentration of the salt in the inflow, or solution entering, 
was 2 lb/gal, and so salt was entering the tank at the rate Rin  (2 lb/gal) 	 (3 gal/min)  
6 lb/min and leaving the tank at the rate Rout  (x/300 lb/gal) 	 (3 gal/min)  x/100 lb/min. 
From this data and (6) we get equation (8) of Section 1.3. Let us pose the question: If there 
were 50 lb of salt dissolved initially in the 300 gallons, how much salt is in the tank after 
a long time?
SOLUTION  To find the amount of salt x(t) in the tank at time t, we solve the initial-value 
problem
 
dx
dt 
1
100 x  6, 
x(0)  50.
Note here that the side condition is the initial amount of salt, x(0)  50 in the tank, and not 
the initial amount of liquid in the tank. Now since the integrating factor of the linear differ-
ential equation is et/100, we can write the equation as
 
d
dtfet>100xg  6et>100.
Integrating the last equation and solving for x gives the general solution x(t)  600  ce–t/100. 
When t  0, x  50, so we find that c  550. Thus the amount of salt in the tank at any time 
t is given by
 
x(t)  600  550e–t/100. 
(7)
The solution (7) was used to construct the table in FIGURE 2.7.4 (b). Also, it can be seen from 
(7) and Figure 2.7.4(a) that x(t) S 600 as t S q. Of course, this is what we would expect 
in this case; over a long time the number of pounds of salt in the solution must be 
(300 gal)(2 lb/gal)  600 lb.
In Example 5 we assumed that the rate at which the solution was pumped in was the same as 
the rate at which the solution was pumped out. However, this need not be the situation; the mixed 
brine solution could be pumped out at a rate rout faster or slower than the rate rin at which the 
other brine solution was pumped in.

Example 5 Revisited
If the well-stirred solution in Example 5 is pumped out at the slower rate of rout  2 gallons 
per minute, then liquid accumulates in the tank at a rate of 
 
rin 2 rout  (3 2 2) gal/min  1 gal/min. 
After t minutes there are 300  t gallons of brine in the tank and so the concentration of the 
outflow is c(t)  x/(300  t). The output rate of salt is then Rout  c(t) 	 rout or

 Series Circuits For a series circuit containing only a resistor and an inductor, Kirchhoff’s 
second law states that the sum of the voltage drop across the inductor (L(di/dt)) and the voltage 
drop across the resistor (iR) is the same as the impressed voltage (E(t)) on the circuit. See FIGURE 2.7.5.
Thus we obtain the linear differential equation for the current i(t),

(8)
where L and R are known as the inductance and the resistance, respectively. The current i(t) is 
also called the response of the system.
The voltage drop across a capacitor with capacitance C is given by q(t)/C, where q is the 
charge on the capacitor. Hence, for the series circuit shown in FIGURE 2.7.6, Kirchhoff’s second 
law gives
 
Ri  1
C q  E(t).

But current i and charge q are related by i  dq/dt, so (9) becomes the linear differential equation

EXAMPLE 7 
LR-Series Circuit
A 12-volt battery is connected to an LR-series circuit in which the inductance is 1

the resistance is 10 ohms. Determine the current i if the initial current is zero.
SOLUTION  From (8) we see that we must solve the equation

From (4) of Section 2.3 we can write a general solution of (8):
 
i(t)  e(R>L)t
L #e(R>L)t E(t) dt  ce(R>L)t. 
(11)
In particular, when E(t)  E0 is a constant, (11) becomes
 
i(t)  E0
R  ce(R>L)t. 
(12)
Note that as t S q, the second term in (12) approaches zero. Such a term is usually called a 
transient term; any remaining terms are called the steady-state part of the solution. In this case 
E0   /R is also called the steady-state current; for large values of time it then appears that the cur-
rent in the circuit is simply governed by Ohm’s law (E  iR).
REMARKS
The solution P(t)  P0e0.4055t of the initial-value problem in Example 1 described the popula-
tion of a colony of bacteria at any time t  0. Of course, P(t) is a continuous function that 
takes on all real numbers in the interval defined by P0  P  q. But since we are talking 
about a population, common sense dictates that P can take on only positive integer values. 
Moreover, we would not expect the population to grow continuously—that is, every second, 
every microsecond, and so on—as predicted by our solution; there may be intervals of time 
[t1, t2] over which there is no growth at all. Perhaps, then, the graph shown in FIGURE 2.7.7(a) 
is a more realistic description of P than is the graph of an exponential function. Using a con-
tinuous function to describe a discrete phenomenon is often more a matter of convenience 
than of accuracy. However, for some purposes we may be satisfied if our model describes the 
system fairly closely when viewed macroscopically in time, as in Figures 2.7.7(b) and 2.7.7(c), 
rather than microscopically, as in Figure 2.7.7(a). Keep firmly in mind, a mathematical model 
is not reality.

 4. The population of bacteria in a culture grows at a rate propor-
tional to the number of bacteria present at time t. After 3 hours 
it is observed that 400 bacteria are present. After 10 hours 
2000 bacteria are present. What was the initial number of 
bacteria?
 5. The radioactive isotope of lead, Pb-209, decays at a rate pro-
portional to the amount present at time t and has a half-life of

Mixtures
 21. A tank contains 200 liters of fluid in which 30 grams of salt 
is dissolved. Brine containing 1 gram of salt per liter is then 
pumped into the tank at a rate of 4 L /min; the well-mixed 
solution is pumped out at the same rate. Find the number A(t) 
of grams of salt in the tank at time t.
 22. Solve Problem 21 assuming that pure water is pumped into 
the tank.
 23. A large tank is filled to capacity with 500 gallons of pure 
water. Brine containing 2 pounds of salt per gallon is pumped 
into the tank at a rate of 5 gal/min. The well-mixed solution 
is pumped out at the same rate. Find the number A(t) of pounds 
of salt in the tank at time t.
 24. In Problem 23, what is the concentration c(t) of the salt in the 
tank at time t? At t  5 min? What is the concentration of the 
salt in the tank after a long time; that is, as  t S q? At what 
time is the concentration of the salt in the tank equal to one-
half this limiting value?
 25. Solve Problem 23 under the assumption that the solution is 
pumped out at a faster rate of 10 gal/min. When is the tank 
empty?
 26. Determine the amount of salt in the tank at time t in Example 5 
if the concentration of salt in the inflow is variable and given 
by cin(t)  2  sin(t/4) lb/gal. Without actually graphing, 
conjecture what the solution curve of the IVP should look like. 
Then use a graphing utility to plot the graph of the solution 
on the interval [0, 300]. Repeat for the interval [0, 600] and 
compare your graph with that in Figure 2.7.4(a).
 27. A large tank is partially filled with 100 gallons of fluid in 
which 10 pounds of salt is dissolved. Brine containing 1
2 pound 
of salt per gallon is pumped into the tank at a rate of 6 gal/min. 
The well-mixed solution is then pumped out at a slower rate 
of 4 gal/min. Find the number of pounds of salt in the tank 
after 30 minutes.
 28. In Example 5 the size of the tank containing the salt mixture 
was not given. Suppose, as in the discussion following 
Example 5, that the rate at which brine is pumped into the 
tank is 3 gal/min but that the well-stirred solution is pumped 
out at a rate of 2 gal/min. It stands to reason that since brine 
is accumulating in the tank at the rate of 1 gal/min, any finite 
tank must eventually overflow. Now suppose that the tank has 
an open top and has a total capacity of 400 gallons.
(a) When will the tank overflow?
(b) What will be the number of pounds of salt in the tank at 
the instant it overflows?
(c) Assume that, although the tank is overflowing, the brine 
solution continues to be pumped in at a rate of 3 gal/min 
and the well-stirred solution continues to be pumped 
out at a rate of 2 gal/min. Devise a method for deter-
mining the number of pounds of salt in the tank at

ential equation describing the velocity v of a falling mass 
subject to air resistance proportional to the instantaneous

 where k  0 is a constant of proportionality called the drag 
coefficient. The positive direction is downward.
(a) Solve the equation subject to the initial condition 
v(0)  v0.
(b) Use the solution in part (a) to determine the limiting, or 
terminal, velocity of the mass. We saw how to determine 
the terminal velocity without solving the DE in Problem 39 
in Exercises 2.1.
(c) If the distance s, measured from the point where the 
mass was released above ground, is related to velocity v 
by ds/dt  v, find an explicit expression for s(t) if 
s(0)  0.
 36. How High?—No Air Resistance Suppose a small cannonball 
weighing 16 lb is shot vertically upward with an initial veloc-
ity v0  300 ft/s. The answer to the question, “How high does 
the cannonball go?” depends on whether we take air resistance 
into account.
(a) Suppose air resistance is ignored. If the positive direction 
is upward, then a model for the state of the cannonball is 
given by d 2s/dt 2  g (equation (12) of Section 1.3). 
Since ds/dt  v(t) the last differential equation is the same 
as dv/dt  g, where we take g  32 ft  /s2. Find the 
velocity v(t) of the cannonball at time t.
(b) Use the result obtained in part (a) to determine the 
height s(t) of the cannonball measured from ground 
level. Find the maximum height attained by the 
 cannonball.
 37. How High?—Linear Air Resistance Repeat Problem 36, 
but this time assume that air resistance is proportional to 
instantaneous velocity. It stands to reason that the maximum 
height attained by the cannonball must be less than that in 
part (b) of Problem 36. Show this by supposing that the drag 
coefficient is k  0.0025. [Hint: Slightly modify the DE in 
Problem 35.]
 38. Skydiving A skydiver weighs 125 pounds, and her parachute 
and equipment combined weigh another 35 pounds. After 
exiting from a plane at an altitude of 15,000 feet, she waits 
15 seconds and opens her parachute. Assume the constant of 
proportionality in the model in Problem 35 has the value 
k  0.5 during free fall and k  10 after the parachute is 
opened. Assume that her initial velocity on leaving the plane 
is zero. What is her velocity and how far has she traveled 
20 seconds after leaving the plane? How does her velocity at 
20 seconds compare with her terminal velocity? How long 
does it take her to reach the ground? [Hint: Think in terms of 
two distinct IVPs.]
 39. Evaporating Raindrop As a raindrop falls, it evaporates while 
retaining its spherical shape. If we make the further assump-
tions that the rate at which the raindrop evaporates is propor-
tional to its surface area and that air resistance is negligible, 
then a model for the velocity v(t) of the raindrop is
 
dv
dt 
3(k/r)
(k/r)t  r0
 v  g.
 
 Here r is the density of water, r0 is the radius of the raindrop 
at t  0, k  0 is the constant of proportionality, and the 
downward direction is taken to be the positive direction.
(a) Solve for v(t) if the raindrop falls from rest.
(b) Reread Problem 36 of Exercises 1.3 and then show that 
the radius of the raindrop at time t is r(t)  (k/r)t  r0.
(c) If r0  0.01 ft and r  0.007 ft 10 seconds after the rain-
drop falls from a cloud, determine the time at which the 
raindrop has evaporated completely.
 40. Fluctuating Population The differential equation dP/dt  
(k cos t)P, where k is a positive constant, is a mathematical 
model for a population P(t) that undergoes yearly seasonal 
fluctuations. Solve the equation subject to P(0)  P0. Use a 
graphing utility to obtain the graph of the solution for differ-
ent choices of P0.

 where dB/dt and dD/dt are the birth and death rates, 
respectively.

(b) Analyze the cases k1  k2, k1  k2, and k1  k2.

rate of memorization of a subject is given by

 where k1  0, k2  0, A(t) is the amount to be memorized in 
time t, M is the total amount to be memorized, and M  A is 
the amount remaining to be memorized. See Problems 25 and 
26 in Exercises 1.3.
(a) Since the DE is autonomous, use the phase portrait con-
cept of Section 2.1 to find the limiting value of A(t) as 
t S q. Interpret the result.
(b) Solve for A(t) subject to A(0)  0. Sketch the graph of 
A(t) and verify your prediction in part (a).

which a drug disseminates into the bloodstream is given by 
dx/dt  r  kx, where r and k are positive constants. The 
function x(t) describes the concentration of the drug in the 
bloodstream at time t.
(a) Since the DE is autonomous, use the phase portrait con-
cept of Section 2.1 to find the limiting value of x(t) as 
t S q.
(b) Solve the DE subject to x(0)  0. Sketch the graph of x(t) 
and verify your prediction in part (a). At what time is the 
concentration one-half this limiting value?

 47. Heart Pacemaker A heart pacemaker, shown in FIGURE 2.7.10, 
consists of a switch, a battery, a capacitor, and the heart as 
a resistor. When the switch S is at P, the capacitor charges; 
when S is at Q, the capacitor discharges, sending an electri-
cal stimulus to the heart. In Problem 53 in Exercises 2.3, we 
saw that during the time the electrical stimulus is being

(a) Let us assume that over the time interval of length t1, 
(0, t1), the switch S is at position P shown in Figure 2.7.10 
and the capacitor is being charged. When the switch is 
moved to position Q at time t1 the capacitor discharges, 
sending an impulse to the heart over the time interval of 
length t2: [t1, t1  t2). Thus, over the initial charging/
discharging interval (0, t1  t2) the voltage to the heart is 
actually modeled by the piecewise-linear differential

plane that makes an angle u with the horizontal as shown in

of the box at time t in each of the following three cases:
 (i) 
No sliding friction and no air resistance
 (ii) With sliding friction and no air resistance
 (iii) With sliding friction and air resistance
 
 In cases (ii) and (iii), use the fact that the force of friction 
opposing the motion of the box is µN, where µ is the 
coefficient of sliding friction and N is the normal compo-
nent of the weight of the box. In case (iii) assume that air 
resistance is proportional to the instantaneous velocity.

air in this room contains 0.25% by volume of carbon dioxide 
(CO2). Starting at 9:00 A.M. fresh air containing 0.04% by 
volume of CO2 is circulated into the room at the rate of 
400 m3/min. Assume that the stale air leaves the room at the 
same rate as the incoming fresh air and that the stale air and 
fresh air mix immediately in the room. See FIGURE 2.7.12.

 50. Sliding Box—Continued (a)  In Problem 48, let s(t) be the
distance measured down the inclined plane from the high-
est point. Use ds/dt  v(t) and the solution for each of the 
three cases in part (b) of Problem 48 to find the time that 
it takes the box to slide completely down the inclined plane. 
A root-finding application of a CAS may be useful here.
(b) In the case in which there is friction ( µ  0) but no 
air resistance, explain why the box will not slide down 
the plane starting from rest from the highest point 
above ground when the inclination angle u satisfies 
tan u  µ.
(c) The box will slide downward on the plane when tan u  µ 
if it is given an initial velocity v(0)  v0  0. Suppose 
that µ  !3/4 and u  23. Verify that tan u  µ. How 
far will the box slide down the plane if v0  1 ft  /s?
(d) Using the values µ  !3/4 and u  23, approximate 
the smallest initial velocity v0 that can be given to the 
box so that, starting at the highest point 50 ft above 
ground, it will slide completely down the inclined 
plane. Then find the corresponding time it takes to slide 
down the plane.
 51. What Goes Up (a)  It is well-known that the model in which
air resistance is ignored, part (a) of Problem 36, predicts 
that the time ta it takes the cannonball to attain its maxi-
mum height is the same as the time td it takes the can-
nonball to fall from the maximum height to the ground. 
Moreover, the magnitude of the impact velocity vi will be 
the same as the initial velocity v0 of the cannonball. Verify 
both of these results.
(b) Then, using the model in Problem 37 that takes linear air 
resistance into account, compare the value of ta with td 
and the value of the magnitude of vi with v0. A root-finding 
application of a CAS (or graphic calculator) may be 
useful here.
2.8 Nonlinear Models
INTRODUCTION We finish our discussion of single first-order differential equations by 
 examining some nonlinear mathematical models.
 Population Dynamics If P(t) denotes the size of a population at time t, the model for 
exponential growth begins with the assumption that dP/dt  kP for some k  0. In this model 
the relative, or specific, growth rate defined by
 
dP>dt
P
 
(1)
is assumed to be a constant k. True cases of exponential growth over long periods of time are 
hard to find, because the limited resources of the environment will at some time exert restrictions 
on the growth of a population. Thus (1) can be expected to decrease as P increases in size.
The assumption that the rate at which a population grows (or declines) is dependent only on 
the number present and not on any time-dependent mechanisms such as seasonal phenomena 
(see Problem 33 in Exercises 1.3) can be stated as
 
dP>dt
P
 f (P) or 
dP
dt  Pf (P). 
(2)
The differential equation in (2), which is widely assumed in models of animal populations, is 
called the density-dependent hypothesis.
 Logistic Equation Suppose an environment is capable of sustaining no more than a 
fixed number of K individuals in its population. The quantity K is called the carrying capacity 
of the environment. Hence, for the function f in (2) we have f (K)  0, and we simply let f (0)  r. 

 
2.8 Nonlinear Models 
| 85
FIGURE 2.8.1 shows three functions f that satisfy these two conditions. The simplest assumption 
that we can make is that f (P) is linear—that is, f (P)  c1P  c2. If we use the conditions f (0)  r 
and f (K)  0, we find, in turn, c2  r, c1  r/K, and so f takes on the form f (P)  r  (r/K)P. 
Equation (2) becomes
 
dP
dt  P ar 2 r
K Pb. 
(3)
Relabeling constants a  r and b  r/K, the nonlinear equation (3) is the same as
 
dP
dt  P (a 2 bP). 
(4)
Around 1840 the Belgian mathematician/biologist P. F. Verhulst (1804–1849) was concerned 
with mathematical models for predicting the human population of various countries. One of the 
equations he studied was (4), where a  0, b  0. Equation (4) came to be known as the logistic 
equation, and its solution is called the logistic function. The graph of a logistic function is called 
a logistic curve.
The linear differential equation dP/dt  kP does not provide a very accurate model for popula-
tion when the population itself is very large. Overcrowded conditions, with the resulting detri-
mental effects on the environment, such as pollution and excessive and competitive demands for 
food and fuel, can have an inhibiting effect on population growth. As we shall now see, a solution 
of (4) that satisfies an initial condition P(0)  P0, where 0  P0  a/b, is bounded as 
t S q. If we rewrite (4) as dP/dt  aP  bP2, the nonlinear term bP 2, b  0, can be interpreted 
as an “inhibition” or “competition” term. Also, in most applications, the positive constant a is 
much larger than the constant b.
Logistic curves have proved to be quite accurate in predicting the growth patterns, in a limited 
space, of certain types of bacteria, protozoa, water fleas (Daphnia), and fruit flies (Drosophila).
 Solution of the Logistic Equation One method of solving (4) is by separation of 
variables. Decomposing the left side of dP/P(a  bP)  dt into partial fractions and integrat-
ing gives

a ln |a 2 bP|  t  c

It follows from the last equation that
 
P(t) 
ac1eat
1  bc1eat 
ac1
bc1  eat.
If P(0)  P0, P0  a/b, we find c1  P0 /(a  bP0), and so, after substituting and simplifying, the 
solution becomes
 
P(t) 
aP0
bP0  (a 2 bP0)eat. 
(5)
 Graphs of P(t ) The basic shape of the graph of the logistic function P(t) can be obtained 
without too much effort. Although the variable t usually represents time and we are seldom 
concerned with applications in which t  0, it is nonetheless of some interest to include this 
interval when displaying the various graphs of P. From (5) we see that
 
P(t) S aP0

P(t) S 0 as t S q.

CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
The dashed line P  a/2b shown in FIGURE 2.8.2 corresponds to the y-coordinate of a point of 
inflection of the logistic curve. To show this, we differentiate (4) by the Product Rule:
 d 2P
dt2  P ab dP
dt b  (a 2 bP) dP
dt  dP
dt  (a 2 2bP)
   P (a 2 bP)(a 2 2bP)
   2b2P aP 2 a
bb  aP 2 a
2bb.
From calculus, recall that the points where d2P/dt2  0 are possible points of inflection, but 
P  0 and P  a/b can obviously be ruled out. Hence P  a/2b is the only possible ordinate 
value at which the concavity of the graph can change. For 0  P  a/2b it follows that P  0, 
and a/2b  P  a/b implies P  0. Thus, as we read from left to right, the graph changes from 
concave up to concave down at the point corresponding to P  a/2b. When the initial value 
satisfies 0  P0  a/2b, the graph of P(t) assumes the shape of an S, as we see in Figure 2.8.2(b). 
For a/2b  P0  a/b the graph is still S-shaped, but the point of inflection occurs at a negative 
value of t, as shown in Figure 2.8.2(c).
We have already seen equation (4) above in (5) of Section 1.3 in the form dx/dt  kx(n  1  x), 
k  0. This differential equation provides a reasonable model for describing the spread of an 
epidemic brought about initially by introducing an infected individual into a static population. 
The solution x(t) represents the number of individuals infected with the disease at time t.
EXAMPLE 1 
Logistic Growth
Suppose a student carrying a flu virus returns to an isolated college campus of 1000 students. 
If it is assumed that the rate at which the virus spreads is proportional not only to the number x 
of infected students but also to the number of students not infected, determine the number of 
infected students after 6 days if it is further observed that after 4 days x(4)  50.
SOLUTION  Assuming that no one leaves the campus throughout the duration of the disease, 
we must solve the initial-value problem
 
dx
dt  kx(1000 2 x), 
x(0)  1.
By making the identifications a  1000k and b  k, we have immediately from (5) that
 
x(t) 
1000k
k  999ke1000kt 
1000

Now, using the information x(4)  50, we determine k from
 
50 
1000

We find 1000k  1
4 ln 19
999  0.9906. Thus
 
x(t) 

Finally, 
x (6) 

Additional calculated values of x(t) are given in the table in FIGURE 2.8.3(b).
 Modifications of the Logistic Equation There are many variations of the logistic 
equation. For example, the differential equations
 
dP
dt  P(a 2 bP) 2 h  and  
dP
dt  P(a 2 bP)  h 
(6)
could serve, in turn, as models for the population in a fishery where fish are harvested or are 
restocked at rate h. When h  0 is a constant, the DEs in (6) can be readily analyzed qualitatively

or solved by separation of variables. The equations in (6) could also serve as models of a human 
population either increased by immigration or decreased by emigration. The rate h in (6) could 
be a function of time t or may be population dependent; for example, harvesting might be done 
periodically over time or may be done at a rate pro portional to the population P at time t. In the 
latter instance, the model would look like P  P(a  bP)  cP, c  0. A human population of 
a community might change due to immigration in such a manner that the contribution due to im-
migration is large when the population P of the community is itself small, but then the immigration 
contribution might be small when P is large; a reasonable model for the population of the com-
munity is then P  P(a  bP)  ce–kP, c  0, k  0. Another equation of the form given in (2),
 
dP
dt  P(a 2 b ln P), 
(7)
is a modification of the logistic equation known as the Gompertz differential equation. This 
DE is sometimes used as a model in the study of the growth or decline of population, in the growth 
of solid tumors, and in certain kinds of actuarial predictions. See Problems 5–8 in Exercises 2.8.
 Chemical Reactions Suppose that a grams of chemical A are combined with b grams 
of chemical B. If there are M parts of A and N parts of B formed in the compound and X(t) is 
the number of grams of chemical C formed, then the numbers of grams of chemicals A and B 
remaining at any time are, respectively,
 
a 2
M
M  N X  and  
b 2
N
M  N X.
By the law of mass action, the rate of the reaction satisfies
 
dX
dt r aa 2
M
M  N Xb  ab 2
N
M  N Xb. 
(8)
If we factor out M/(M  N) from the first factor and N/(M  N) from the second and introduce 
a constant k  0 of proportionality, (8) has the form
 
dX
dt  k(a 2 X)(b 2 X), 
(9)
where a  a(M  N)/M and b  b(M  N)/N. Recall from (6) of Section 1.3 that a chemical 
reaction governed by the nonlinear differential equation (9) is said to be a second-order reaction.
EXAMPLE 2 
Second-Order Chemical Reaction
A compound C is formed when two chemicals A and B are combined. The resulting reaction 
between the two chemicals is such that for each gram of A, 4 grams of B are used. It is observed 
that 30 grams of the compound C are formed in 10 minutes. Determine the amount of C at 
time t if the rate of the reaction is proportional to the amounts of A and B remaining and if 
initially there are 50 grams of A and 32 grams of B. How much of the compound C is present 
at 15 minutes? Interpret the solution as t S q.
SOLUTION  Let X(t) denote the number of grams of the compound C present at time t. Clearly 
X(0)  0 g and X(10)  30 g.
If, for example, 2 grams of compound C are present, we must have used, say, a grams of A 
and b grams of B so that a  b  2 and b  4a. Thus we must use a  2
5  2(1
5) g of chemical 
A and b  8
5  2(4
5) g of B. In general, for X grams of C we must use
 
1
5 X grams of A  and  4
5 X grams of B.
The amounts of A and B remaining at any time are then
 
50  1
5 X and 
32 2 4
5 X,
respectively.

Now we know that the rate at which compound C is formed satisfies
 
dX

To simplify the subsequent algebra, we factor 1
5 from the first term and 4
5 from the second and 
then introduce the constant of proportionality:
 
dX
dt  k(250 2 X)(40 2 X).
By separation of variables and partial fractions we can write

40 2 X  c2e210kt. 
(10)
When t  0, X  0, so it follows at this point that c2  25

(11)
The behavior of X as a function of time is displayed in FIGURE 2.8.4. It is clear from the 
 accompanying table and (11) that X S 40 as t S q. This means that 40 grams of compound

P(0)  P0,
 
where a, b, h, and P0 are positive constants. Suppose 
a  5, b  1, and h  4. Since the DE is autonomous, 
use the phase portrait concept of Section 2.1 to sketch

 10. The Allee Effect  For an initial population P0, where P0  K 
the logistic population model (3) predicts that population can-
not sustain itself over time so it decreases but yet never falls 
below the carrying capacity K of the ecosystem. Moreover, 
for 0  P0  K, the same model predicts that, regardless of 
how small P0 is, the population increases over time and 
does not surpass the carrying capacity K. See Figure 2.8.2, 
where a/b  K. But the American ecologist Warder Clyde 
Allee (1885–1955) showed that by depleting certain fisheries 
beyond a certain level, the fishery population never recovers. 
How would you modify the differential equation (3) to describe 
a population P that has these same two characteristics of (3) 
but additionally has a threshold level A, 0  A  K, below 
which the population cannot sustain itself and becomes extinct. 
[Hint: Construct a phase portrait of what you want and then 
form a DE.]

rate, or velocity, of the reaction is proportional to the product 
of the instantaneous amounts of A and B not converted to chem-

for each gram of B, 2 grams of A are used. It is observed that 
10 grams of C are formed in 5 minutes. How much is formed in

 where 0  c  1. How long will it take the tank in Problem 13(b) 
to empty if c  0.6? See Problem 13 in Exercises 1.3.
 15. Leaking Conical Tank A tank in the form of a right-circular 
cone standing on end, vertex down, is leaking water through 
a circular hole in its bottom.
(a) Suppose the tank is 20 feet high and has radius 8 feet and 
the circular hole has radius 2 inches. In Problem 14 in 
Exercises 1.3 you were asked to show that the differential 
equation governing the height h of water leaking from a 
tank is

In this model, friction and contraction of the water at the 
hole were taken into account with c  0.6, and g was 
taken to be 32 ft/s2. See Figure 1.3.13. If the tank is ini-
tially full, how long will it take the tank to empty?
(b) Suppose the tank has a vertex angle of 60, and the cir-
cular hole has radius 2 inches. Determine the differential 
equation governing the height h of water. Use c  0.6 
and g  32 ft/s2. If the height of the water is initially 
9 feet, how long will it take the tank to empty?
 16. Inverted Conical Tank Suppose that the conical tank in 
Problem 15(a) is inverted, as shown in FIGURE 2.8.5, and that 
water leaks out a circular hole of radius 2 inches in the center 
of the circular base. Is the time it takes to empty a full tank the 
same as for the tank with vertex down in Problem 15? Take the 
friction/contraction coefficient to be c  0.6 and g  32 ft/s2.

to the square of the instantaneous velocity is

 where k  0 is the drag coefficient. The positive direction is 
downward.
(a) Solve this equation subject to the initial condition 
v(0)  v0.
(b) Use the solution in part (a) to determine the limiting, or 
terminal, velocity of the mass. We saw how to determine 
the terminal velocity without solving the DE in Problem 41 
in Exercises 2.1.
(c) If distance s, measured from the point where the mass 
was released above ground, is related to velocity v by 
ds/dt  v(t), find an explicit expression for s(t) if s(0)  0.
 18. How High?—Nonlinear Air Resistance Consider the 
16-pound cannonball shot vertically upward in Problems 36 
and 37 in Exercises 2.7 with an initial velocity v0  300 ft/s. 
Determine the maximum height attained by the cannonball if 
air resistance is assumed to be proportional to the square of 
the instantaneous velocity. Assume the positive direction is 
upward and take the drag coefficient to be k  0.0003. [Hint: 
Slightly modify the DE in Problem 17.]
 19. That Sinking Feeling (a)  Determine a differential equation 
for the velocity v(t) of a mass m sinking in water that 
imparts a resistance proportional to the square of the in-
stantaneous velocity and also exerts an upward buoyant 
force whose magnitude is given by Archimedes’ principle. 
See Problem 18 in Exercises 1.3. Assume that the positive 
direction is downward.
(b) Solve the differential equation in part (a).
(c) Determine the limiting, or terminal, velocity of the 
sinking mass.
 20. Solar Collector The differential equation

 describes the shape of a plane curve C that will reflect all 
incoming light beams to the same point and could be a model 
for the mirror of a reflecting telescope, a satellite antenna, or 
a solar collector. See Problem 29 in Exercises 1.3. There are 
several ways of solving this DE.
(a) Verify that the differential equation is homogeneous (see 
Section 2.5). Show that the substitution y  ux yields
 
u du
"1  u2(1 2 "1  u2)
 dx
x .
 
Use a CAS (or another judicious substitution) to integrate 
the left-hand side of the equation. Show that the curve C 
must be a parabola with focus at the origin and is sym-
metric with respect to the x-axis.
(b) Show that the first differential equation can also be solved 
by means of the substitution u  x2  y2.

given by
 
dW

where W(x)  0 is the height of the wave expressed as a 
function of its position relative to a point offshore. By 
inspection, find all constant solutions of the DE.

(b) Solve the differential equation in part (a). A CAS may be 
useful for integration.
(c) Use a graphing utility to obtain the graphs of all solutions 
that satisfy the initial condition W(0)  2.
 22. Evaporation An outdoor decorative pond in the shape of a 
hemispherical tank is to be filled with water pumped into the 
tank through an inlet in its bottom. Suppose that the radius 
of the tank is R  10 ft, that water is pumped in at a rate of 
p ft3/min, and that the tank is initially empty. See FIGURE 2.8.6. 
As the tank fills, it loses water through evaporation. Assume 
that the rate of evaporation is proportional to the area A of the 
surface of the water and that the constant of proportionality 
is k  0.01.
(a) The rate of change dV/dt of the volume of the water at 
time t is a net rate. Use this net rate to determine a differen-
tial equation for the height h of the water at time t. The vol-
ume of the water shown in the figure is V  pRh2  1
3 ph3, 
where R  10. Express the area of the surface of the water 
A  pr2 in terms of h.
(b) Solve the differential equation in part (a). Graph the 
solution.
(c) If there were no evaporation, how long would it take the 
tank to fill?
(d) With evaporation, what is the depth of the water at the 
time found in part (c)? Will the tank ever be filled? Prove 
your assertion.

 23. Sawing Wood A long uniform piece of wood (cross sections 
are the same) is cut through perpendicular to its length by a 
vertical saw blade. See FIGURE 2.8.7. If the friction between the 
sides of the saw blade and the wood through which the blade 
passes is ignored, then it can be assumed that the rate at which 
the saw blade moves through the piece of wood is inversely 
proportional to the width of the wood in contact with its cut-
ting edge. As the blade advances through the wood (moving 
left to right), the width of a cross section changes as a non-
negative continuous function w. If a cross section of the wood 
is described as a region in the xy-plane defined over an in-
terval fa, bg, then as shown in Figure 2.8.7(c) the position x 
of the saw blade is a function of time t and the vertical cut 
made by the blade can be represented by a vertical line seg-
ment. The length of this vertical line is the width w(x) of the 
wood at that point. Thus the position x(t) of the saw blade 
and the rate dx>dt at which it moves to the right are related 
to w(x) by
 
w(x) dx
dt  k, x(0)  a. 
(14)
 
 Here k represents the number of square units of the material 
removed by the saw blade per unit time. In the problems that 
follow, we assume that the saw can be programmed so that 
k  1. Find an explicit solution x(t) of the initial-value prob-
lem (14) when a cross section of the piece of wood is trian-
gular and is bounded by the graphs of y  x, x  1, and y  0. 
How long does it take the saw to cut through this piece 
of wood? 
 24. (a)  Find an implicit solution of the initial-value problem (14) 
in Problem 23 when the piece of wood is a circular log. 
Assume a cross section is a circle of radius 2 centered at 
(0, 0). [Hint: To save time, see formula 33 in the table of 
integrals given on the right page inside the front cover.]
(b) Solve the implicit solution obtained in part (b) for time t 
as a function of x. Graph the function t(x). With the aid 
of the graph, approximate the time that it takes the saw 
to cut through this piece of wood. Then find the exact 
value of this time.
 25. Solve the initial-value problem (14) in Problem 23 when a 
cross section of a uniform piece of wood is the triangular 
region given in FIGURE 2.8.8. Assume again that k  1. How 
long does it take to cut through this piece of wood?

 26. Regression Line Read the documentation for your CAS on 
scatter plots (or scatter diagrams) and least-squares linear fit. 
The straight line that best fits a set of data points is called a 
regression line or a least squares line. Your task is to construct 
a logistic model for the population of the United States, defin-
ing f (P) in (2) as an equation of a regression line based on the 
population data in the table in Problem 4. One way of
doing this is to approximate the left-hand side 1

equation in (2) using the forward difference quotient in place 
of dP/dt:
 
Q(t) 

.
(a) Make a table of the values t, P(t), and Q(t) using t  0, 
10, 20, . . . , 160, and h  10. For example, the first line 
of the table should contain t  0, P(0), and Q(0). With 
P(0)  3.929 and P(10)  5.308,
 
Q(0) 

Note that Q(160) depends on the 1960 census population 
P(170). Look up this value.
(b) Use a CAS to obtain a scatter plot of the data (P(t), Q(t)) 
computed in part (a). Also use a CAS to find an equation 
of the regression line and to superimpose its graph on the 
scatter plot.
(c) Construct a logistic model dP/dt  Pf (P), where f (P) is 
the equation of the regression line found in part (b).
(d) Solve the model in part (c) using the initial condition 
P(0)  3.929.
(e) Use a CAS to obtain another scatter plot, this time of the 
ordered pairs (t, P(t)) from your table in part (a). Use your 
CAS to superimpose the graph of the solution in part (d) 
on the scatter plot.
(f  ) Look up the U.S. census data for 1970, 1980, and 1990. 
What population does the logistic model in part (c) predict 
for these years? What does the model predict for the U.S. 
population P(t) as t S q?
 27. Immigration Model (a)  In Examples 3 and 4 of Section 2.1,
 
 we saw that any solution P(t) of (4) possesses the asymp-
totic behavior P(t) S a/b as t S q for P0  a/b and for 
0  P0  a/b; as a consequence, the equilibrium solution 
P  a/b is called an attractor. Use a root-finding applica-
tion of a CAS (or a graphic calculator) to approximate 
the equilibrium solution of the immigration model
 
dP
dt  P(1 2 P)  0.3eP.
(b) Use a graphing utility to graph the function F(P)  
P(1  P)  0.3e–P. Explain how this graph can be used 
to determine whether the number found in part (a) is 
an attractor.
(c) Use a numerical solver to compare the solution curves 
for the IVPs
 
dP
dt  P(1 2 P), 
P(0)  P0
 
for P0  0.2 and P0  1.2 with the solution curves for 
the IVPs
 
dP
dt  P(1 2 P)  0.3eP, 
P(0)  P0
 
for P0  0.2 and P0  1.2. Superimpose all curves on the 
same coordinate axes but, if possible, use a different color 
for the curves of the second initial-value problem. Over 
a long period of time, what percentage increase does the 
immigration model predict in the population compared 
to the logistic model?
 28. What Goes Up . . . . In Problem 18 let ta be the time it takes 
the cannonball to attain its maximum height and let td be 
the time it takes the cannonball to fall from the maximum 
height to the ground. Compare the value of ta with the value 
of td and compare the magnitude of the impact velocity vi 
with the initial velocity v0. See Problem 51 in Exercises 2.7. 
A root-finding application of a CAS may be useful here. 
[Hint: Use the model in Problem 17 when the cannonball 
is falling.]
 29. Skydiving A skydiver is equipped with a stopwatch and an 
altimeter. She opens her parachute 25 seconds after exiting 
a plane flying at an altitude of 20,000 ft and observes that her 
altitude is 14,800 ft. Assume that air resistance is proportional 
to the square of the instantaneous velocity, her initial veloc-
ity upon leaving the plane is zero, and g  32 ft/s2.
(a) Find the distance s(t), measured from the plane, that the 
skydiver has traveled during free fall in time t. [Hint: The 
constant of proportionality k in the model given in 
Problem 17 is not specified. Use the expression for ter-
minal velocity vt obtained in part (b) of Problem 17 to 
eliminate k from the IVP. Then eventually solve for vt.]
(b) How far does the skydiver fall and what is her velocity at 
t  15 s?
 30. Hitting Bottom A helicopter hovers 500 feet above a large 
open tank full of liquid (not water). A dense compact object 
weighing 160 pounds is dropped (released from rest) from the 
helicopter into the liquid. Assume that air resistance is propor-
tional to instantaneous velocity v while the object is in the air 
and that viscous damping is proportional to v2 after the object 
has entered the liquid. For air, take k  1
4, and for the liquid, 
k  0.1. Assume that the positive direction is downward. If 
the tank is 75 feet high, determine the time and the impact 
velocity when the object hits the bottom of the tank. [Hint: 
Think in terms of two distinct IVPs. If you use (13), be careful 
in removing the absolute value sign. You might compare the 
velocity when the object hits the liquid—the initial velocity 
for the second problem—with the terminal velocity vt of the 
object falling through the liquid.]

2.9 Modeling with Systems of First-Order DEs
INTRODUCTION In this section we are going to discuss mathematical models based on 
some of the topics that we have already discussed in the preceding two sections. This section 
will be similar to Section 1.3 in that we are only going to discuss systems of first-order dif-
ferential equations as mathematical models and we are not going to solve any of these models. 
There are two good reasons for not solving systems at this point: First, we do not as yet possess 
the necessary mathematical tools for solving systems, and second, some of the systems that we 
discuss cannot be solved analytically. We shall examine solution methods for systems of linear 
first-order DEs in Chapter 10 and for systems of linear higher-order DEs in Chapters 3 and 4.
 Systems Up to now all the mathematical models that we have considered were single 
differential equations. A single differential equation could describe a single population in an 
environment; but if there are, say, two interacting and perhaps competing species living in the 
same environment (for example, rabbits and foxes), then a model for their populations x(t) and 
y(t) might be a system of two first-order differential equations such as
 
dx
dt  g1(t, x, y)
dy
dt  g2(t, x, y).
 
(1)
When g1 and g2 are linear in the variables x and y; that is,
 
g1(t, x, y)  c1x  c2 y  f1(t)  and  g2(t, x, y)  c3x  c4 y  f2(t),
then (1) is said to be a linear system. A system of differential equations that is not linear is said 
to be nonlinear.
 Radioactive Series In the discussion of radioactive decay in Sections 1.3 and 2.7, we 
assumed that the rate of decay was proportional to the number A(t) of nuclei of the substance 
present at time t. When a substance decays by radioactivity, it usually doesn’t just transmute into 
one stable substance and then the process stops. Rather, the first substance decays into another 
radioactive substance, this substance in turn decays into yet a third substance, and so on. This 
process, called a radioactive decay series, continues until a stable element is reached. For ex-
ample, the uranium decay series is U-238 S Th-234 S . . . S Pb-206, where Pb-206 is a stable 
isotope of lead. The half-lives of the various elements in a radioactive series can range from 
billions of years (4.5  109 years for U-238) to a fraction of a second. Suppose a radioactive 
series is described schematically by X h
l1
 Y h
l2
 Z, where k1  l1  0 and k2  l2  0 
are the decay constants for substances X and Y, respectively, and Z is a stable element. Suppose 
too, that x(t), y(t), and z(t) denote amounts of substances X, Y, and Z, respectively, remaining at 
time t. The decay of element X is described by
 
dx
dt  l1x,
whereas the rate at which the second element Y decays is the net rate,
 
dy
dt  l1x 2 l2 y,
since it is gaining atoms from the decay of X and at the same time losing atoms due to its own 
decay. Since Z is a stable element, it is simply gaining atoms from the decay of element Y:
 
dz
dt  l2y.

 Mixtures Consider the two tanks shown in FIGURE 2.9.1. Let us suppose for the sake of 
discussion that tank A contains 50 gallons of water in which 25 pounds of salt is dissolved. 
Suppose tank B contains 50 gallons of pure water. Liquid is pumped in and out of the tanks as 
indicated in the figure; the mixture exchanged between the two tanks and the liquid pumped out 
of tank B is assumed to be well stirred. We wish to construct a mathematical model that describes 
the number of pounds x1(t) and x2(t) of salt in tanks A and B, respectively, at time t.
By an analysis similar to that on page 22 in Section 1.3 and Example 5 of Section 2.7, we see 
for tank A that the net rate of change of x1(t) is
 
input rate of salt 
output rate of salt

Similarly, for tank B, the net rate of change of x2(t) is
 
dx2
dt  4 	 x1
50 2 3 	 x2
50 2 1 	 x2
50  2

Thus we obtain the linear system

Observe that the foregoing system is accompanied by the initial conditions x1(0)  25, x2(0)  0.
 A Predator–Prey Model Suppose that two different species of animals interact within 
the same environment or ecosystem, and suppose further that the first species eats only vegetation 
and the second eats only the first species. In other words, one species is a predator and the other 
is a prey. For example, wolves hunt grass-eating caribou, sharks devour little fish, and the snowy 
owl pursues an arctic rodent called the lemming. For the sake of discussion, let us imagine that 
the predators are foxes and the prey are rabbits.
Let x(t) and y(t) denote, respectively, the fox and rabbit populations at time t. If there were no 
rabbits, then one might expect that the foxes, lacking an adequate food supply, would decline in 
number according to
 
dx
dt  ax, a  0. 
(4)
When rabbits are present in the environment, however, it seems reasonable that the number of 
encounters or interactions between these two species per unit time is jointly proportional to their 
populations x and y; that is, proportional to the product xy. Thus when rabbits are present there 
is a supply of food, and so foxes are added to the system at a rate bxy, b  0. Adding this last 
rate to (4) gives a model for the fox population:
 
dx
dt  ax  bxy.

FIGURE 2.9.1 Connected mixing tanks

On the other hand, were there no foxes, then the rabbits would, with an added assumption of un-
limited food supply, grow at a rate that is proportional to the number of rabbits present at time t:
dy
dt  dy, d  0. 
(6)
But when foxes are present, a model for the rabbit population is (6) decreased by cxy, c  0; that 
is, decreased by the rate at which the rabbits are eaten during their encounters with the foxes:
 
dy
dt  dy 2 cxy. 
(7)
Equations (5) and (7) constitute a system of nonlinear differential equations
dx
dt  ax  bxy  x(a  by)
dy
dt  dy 2 cxy  y(d 2 cx),
 
(8)
where a, b, c, and d are positive constants. This famous system of equations is known as the 
Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model.
Except for two constant solutions, x(t)  0, y(t)  0 and x(t)  d/c, y(t)  a/b, the nonlinear 
system (8) cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions. However, we can analyze such 
systems quantitatively and qualitatively. See Chapters 6 and 11.
EXAMPLE 1 
Predator–Prey Model
Suppose
 
dx
dt  0.16x  0.08xy
dy
dt  4.5y 2 0.9xy
represents a predator–prey model. Since we are dealing with populations, we have x(t) 
 0, 
y(t) 
 0. FIGURE 2.9.2, obtained with the aid of a numerical solver, shows typical population 
curves of the predators and prey for this model superimposed on the same coordinate axes. The 
initial conditions used were x(0)  4, y(0)  4. The curve in red represents the population x(t) 
of the predator (foxes), and the blue curve is the population y(t) of the prey (rabbits). Observe 
that the model seems to predict that both populations x(t) and y(t) are periodic in time. This 
makes intuitive sense since, as the number of prey decreases, the predator population eventually 
decreases because of a diminished food supply; but attendant to a decrease in the number of 
predators is an increase in the number of prey; this in turn gives rise to an increased number of 
predators, which ultimately brings about another decrease in the number of prey.
 Competition Models Now suppose two different species of animals occupy the same 
ecosystem, not as predator and prey but rather as competitors for the same resources (such as 
food and living space) in the system. In the absence of the other, let us assume that the rate at 
which each population grows is given by
 
dx
dt  ax and 
dy
dt  cy, 
(9)
respectively.
Since the two species compete, another assumption might be that each of these rates is dimin-
ished simply by the influence, or existence, of the other population. Thus a model for the two 
populations is given by the linear system
 
dx
dt  ax 2 by
dy
dt  cy 2 dx,
 
(10)
where a, b, c, and d are positive constants.

| CHAPTER 2 First-Order Differential Equations
On the other hand, we might assume, as we did in (5), that each growth rate in (9) should be 
reduced by a rate proportional to the number of interactions between the two species:
 
dx
dt  ax 2 bxy
dy
dt  cy 2 dxy.
 
(11)
Inspection shows that this nonlinear system is similar to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model. 
Last, it might be more realistic to replace the rates in (9), which indicate that the population of 
each species in isolation grows exponentially, with rates indicating that each population grows 
logistically (that is, over a long time the population is bounded):
 
dx
dt  a1x 2 b1x2 and 
dy
dt  a2y 2 b2 y2. 
(12)
When these new rates are decreased by rates proportional to the number of interactions, we 
obtain another nonlinear model
 
dx
dt  a1x 2 b1x2 2 c1xy  x (a1 2 b1x 2 c1y)
dy
dt  a2y 2 b2y2 2 c2xy  y (a2 2 b2y 2 c2x),
 
(13)
where all coefficients are positive. The linear system (10) and the nonlinear systems (11) and 
(13) are, of course, called competition models.
 Networks An electrical network having more than one loop also gives rise to simultaneous 
differential equations. As shown in FIGURE 2.9.3, the current i1(t) splits in the directions shown at 
point B1, called a branch point of the network. By Kirchhoff’s first law we can write
 
i1(t)  i2(t)  i3(t). 
(14)
In addition, we can also apply Kirchhoff’s second law to each loop. For loop A1B1B2A2A1, sum-
ming the voltage drops across each part of the loop gives
 
E(t)  i1R1  L 1 di2

Similarly, for loop A1B1C1C2B2A2A1 we find

Radioactive Series
 1. We have not discussed methods by which systems of first-order 
differential equations can be solved. Nevertheless, systems such 
as (2) can be solved with no knowledge other than how to solve 
a single linear first-order equation. Find a solution of (2) subject 
to the initial conditions x(0)  x0, y(0)  0, z(0)  0.
 2. In Problem 1, suppose that time is measured in days, that the 
decay constants are k1  0.138629 and k2  0.004951, 
and that x0  20. Use a graphing utility to obtain the graphs 
of the solutions x(t), y(t), and z(t) on the same set of coordinate 
axes. Use the graphs to approximate the half-lives of sub-
stances X and Y.
 3. Use the graphs in Problem 2 to approximate the times when the 
amounts x(t) and y(t) are the same, the times when the amounts 
x(t) and z(t) are the same, and the times when the amounts y(t) 
and z(t) are the same. Why does the time determined when the 
amounts y(t) and z(t) are the same make intuitive sense?
 4. Construct a mathematical model for a radioactive series of 
four elements W, X, Y, and Z, where Z is a stable element.
But for several reasons it is complicated, and sometimes prob-
lematic, to determine how much of the Ca-40 in a sample is 
radiogenic. In contrast, when an igneous rock is formed by 
volcanic activity, all of the argon (and other) gas previously 
trapped in the rock is driven away by the intense heat. At the 
moment when the rock cools and solidifies, the gas trapped 
inside the rock has the same composition as the atmosphere. 
There are three stable isotopes of argon, and in the atmosphere 
they occur in the following relative abundances: 0.063% 
 Ar-38, 0.337% Ar-36, and 99.60% Ar-40. Of these, just one, 
Ar-36, is not created radiogenically by the decay of any element, 
so any Ar-40 in excess of 99.60/(0.337)  295.5 times the 
amount of Ar-36 must be radiogenic. So the amount of radio-
genic Ar-40 in the sample can be determined from the amounts 
of Ar-38 and Ar-36 in the sample, which can be measured.
 
    Assuming that we have a sample of rock for which the 
amount of K-40 and the amount of radiogenic Ar-40 have been 
determined, how can we calculate the age of the rock? Let 
P(t) be the amount of K-40, A(t) the amount of radiogenic 
Ar-40, and C(t) the amount of radiogenic Ca-40 in the sample 
as functions of time t in years since the formation of the rock. 
Then a mathematical model for the decay of K-40 is the sys-
tem of linear first-order differential equations

dt  (lA  lC)P,
 
 where lA  0.581 3 101 0
  and  lC  4.962 3 101 0.
(a) From the system of differential equations find P(t) if 
P(0)  P0.
(b) Determine the half-life of K-40. 
(c) Use P(t) from part (a) to find A(t)  and C(t) if A(0)  0 
and C(0)  0.
(d) Use your solution for A(t) in part (c) to determine the 
percentage of an initial amount P0 of K-40 that decays 
into Ar-40 over a very long period of time (that is, t S q).
What percentage of P0 decays into Ca-40?
6. Potassium–Argon Dating (a)  Use the solutions in parts (a)
 
and (c) of Problem 5 to show that

 fe(lAlC)t 2 1g.
(b) Solve the expression in part (a) for t in terms A(t), P(t), 
lA,  and lC. 
(c) Suppose it is found that each gram of a rock sample con-
tains 8.6 3 107 grams of radiogenic Ar-40 and 
5.3 3 106 grams of K-40. Use the equation obtained in 
part (b) to determine the approximate age of the rock.
Mixtures
 7. Consider two tanks A and B, with liquid being pumped in 
and out at the same rates, as described by the system of 
Contributed Problems
5. Potassium-40 Decay The mineral potassium, whose chem-
ical symbol is K, is the eighth most abundant element in the 
Earth’s crust, making up about 2% of it by weight, and one of 
its naturally occurring isotopes, K-40, is radioactive. The ra-
dioactive decay of K-40 is more complex than that of carbon-14 
because each of its atoms decays through one of two different 
nuclear decay reactions into one of two different substances: 
the mineral calcium-40 (Ca-40) or the gas argon-40 (Ar-40). 
Dating methods have been developed using both of these de-
cay products. In each case, the age of a sample is calculated 
using the ratio of two numbers: the amount of the parent
isotope K-40 in the sample and the amount of the daughter
isotope (Ca-40 or Ar-40) in the sample that is radiogenic, in 
other words, the substance which originates from the decay 
of the parent isotope after the formation of the rock.

An igneous rock is solidified magma
 
    The amount of K-40 in a sample is easy to calculate. 
K-40 comprises 1.17% of naturally occurring potassium, 
and this small percentage is distributed quite uniformly, so 
that the mass of K-40 in the sample is just 1.17% of the total 
mass of potassium in the sample, which can be measured.

Additional Mathematical Models
 17. SIR Model A communicable disease is spread throughout 
a small community, with a fixed population of n people, by 
contact between infected individuals and people who are 
susceptible to the disease. Suppose initially that everyone is 
susceptible to the disease and that no one leaves the com-
munity while the epidemic is spreading. At time t, let s(t), 
i(t), and r(t) denote, in turn, the number of people in the 
community (measured in hundreds) who are susceptible to 
the disease but not yet infected with it, the number of people 
who are infected with the disease, and the number of people 
who have recovered from the disease. Explain why the system 
of differential equations

 where k1 (called the infection rate) and k2 (called the  removal 
rate) are positive constants, is a reasonable mathematical 
model, commonly called a SIR model, for the spread of the 
epidemic throughout the community. Give plausible initial 
conditions associated with this system of equations. Show that 
the system implies that

determine what the model predicts about the epidemic in the 
two cases s0  k2/k1 and s0  k2/k1. In the case of an epidemic, 
estimate the number of people who are eventually infected.

temperature of the body is T1 and the initial temperature of 
the medium is T2, then it can be shown in this case that 
Newton’s law of cooling is dT/dt  k(T  Tm), k  0, where

shape of a curve  such that a bead, under the influence of grav-

time. See FIGURE 2.R.7. It can be shown that a nonlinear differ-
ential equation for the shape y(x) of the path is y[1  (y)2]  k,

 The clepsydra, or water clock, was a device used by the an-
cient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Chinese to measure the 
passage of time by observing the change in the height of wa-
ter that was permitted to flow out of a small hole in the bottom 
of a container or tank. In Problems 39–42, use the differential 
equation (see Problems 13–16 in Exercises 2.8)

in each of these problems that h(0)  2 ft corresponds to

model the data in the table is to use the initial condition 
P0  32.8 and to search for a value of k so that the graph 
of P0ekt appears to fit the data points. Experiment, using 
a graphic calculator or a CAS, by varying the birth rate
k until the graph of P0ekt appears to fit the data well over 
the time period 0 # t # 35. 
   Alternatively, it is also possible to solve analytically 
for a value of k that will guarantee that the curve passes 
through exactly two of the data points. Find a value of k
so that P(5)  55.8. Find a different value of k so that 
P(35)  584. 
(b) In practice, a mathematical model rarely passes through 
every experimentally obtained data point, and so statisti-
cal methods must be used to find values of the model’s 
parameters that best fit experimental data. Specifically, 
we will use linear regression to find a value of k that 
describes the given data points:
•  Use the table to obtain a new data set of the form 
(ti,  ln P(ti)), where P(ti) is the given population at the 
times t1  0,  t2  5,  . . . .
•  Most graphic calculators have a built-in routine to find 
the line of least squares that fits this data. The routine 
gives an equation of the form ln P(t)  mt  b, where 
m and b are, respectively, the slope and intercept cor-
responding to the line of best fit. (Most calculators also 
give the value of the correlation coefficient that indi-
cates how well the data is approximated by a line; a 
correlation coefficient of 1 or 1 means perfect cor-
relation. A correlation coefficient near 0 may mean that 
the data do not appear to be fit by an exponential 
model.)
•  Solving ln P(t)  mt  b gives P(t)  emtb or P(t) 
ebemt. Matching the last form with P0ekt, we see that 
eb is an approximate initial population, and m is the 
value of the birth rate that best fits the given data.
(c) So far you have produced four different values of the birth 
rate k. Do your four values of k agree closely with each 
other? Should they? Which of the four values do you think 
is the best model for the growth of the toad population 
during the years for which we have data? Use this birth 
rate to predict the toad’s range in the year 2039. Given 
that the area of Australia is 7,619,000 km2, how confident 
are you of this prediction? Explain your reasoning.
 52. Invasion of the Marine Toads—Continued In part (a) of 
Problem 51, we made the assumption that there was an aver-
age of one toad per square kilometer. But suppose we are 
wrong and there were actually an average of two toads per 
square kilometer. As before, solve analytically for a value of 
k that will guarantee that the curve passes through exactly two 
of the data points. In particular, if we now assume that 
P(0)  65.6, find a value of k so that P(5)  111.6, and a 
different value of k so that P(35)  1168. How do these val-
ues of k compare with the values you found previously? What 
does this tell us? Discuss the importance of knowing the exact 
average density of the toad population.

51. Invasion of the Marine Toads* In 1935, the poisonous 
American marine toad (Bufo marinus) was introduced, 
against the advice of ecologists, into some of the coastal 
sugar cane districts in Queensland, Australia, as a means of 
controlling sugar cane beetles. Due to lack of natural preda-
tors and the existence of an abundant food supply, the toad 
population grew and spread into regions far from the origi-
nal districts. The survey data given in the accompanying 
table indicate how the toads expanded their territorial bounds 
within a 40-year period. Our goal in this problem is to find 
a population model of the form P(ti) but we want to construct 
the model that best fits the given data. Note that the data are 
not given as number of toads at 5-year intervals since this 
kind of information would be virtually impossible to obtain.
(a) For ease of computation, let’s assume that, on the aver-
age, there is one toad per square kilometer. We will also 
count the toads in units of thousands and measure time 
in years with t  0 corresponding to 1939. One way to

We turn now to DEs of order two 
or higher. In the first six sections 
of this chapter we examine the 
underlying theory of linear DEs 
and methods for solving certain 
kinds of linear equations. The 
difficulties that surround higher-
order nonlinear DEs and the 
few methods that yield analytic 
solutions for such equations are 
examined next (Section 3.7). 
The chapter concludes with 
higher-order linear and nonlinear 
mathematical models (Sections 
3.8, 3.9, and 3.11) and the first of 
several methods to be  considered 
on solving systems of linear DEs 
(Section 3.12).

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
3.1 
Theory of Linear Equations
INTRODUCTION We turn now to differential equations of order two or higher. In this section 
we will examine some of the underlying theory of linear DEs. Then in the five sections that fol-
low we learn how to solve linear higher-order differential equations.
3.1.1 Initial-Value and Boundary-Value Problems
 Initial-Value Problem In Section 1.2 we defined an initial-value problem for a general 
nth-order differential equation. For a linear differential equation, an nth-order initial-value 
problem (IVP) is
Solve:  
an(x) d ny
dx n  an21(x) d n21y
dx n21  . . .  a1(x) dy
dx  a0(x)y  g(x)
 
Subject to: y(x0)  y0, y9(x0)  y1, . . . , y(n21)(x0)  yn21. 
(1)
Recall that for a problem such as this, we seek a function defined on some interval I containing 
x0 that satisfies the differential equation and the n initial conditions specified at x0: y(x0)  y0, 
y(x0)  y1, . . ., y(n1)(x0)  yn1. We have already seen that in the case of a second-order initial-
value problem, a solution curve must pass through the point (x0, y0) and have slope y1 at this point.
 Existence and Uniqueness In Section 1.2 we stated a theorem that gave conditions 
under which the existence and uniqueness of a solution of a first-order initial-value problem were 
guaranteed. The theorem that follows gives sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique 
solution of the problem in (1).
EXAMPLE 1 
Unique Solution of an IVP
The initial-value problem
 
3y  5y  y  7y  0,  y(1)  0,  y(1)  0,  y(1)  0
possesses the trivial solution y  0. Since the third-order equation is linear with constant 
coefficients, it follows that all the conditions of Theorem 3.1.1 are fulfilled. Hence y  0 is 
the only solution on any interval containing x  1.
EXAMPLE 2 
Unique Solution of an IVP
You should verify that the function y  3e2x  e2x  3x is a solution of the initial-value problem 
 
y  4y  12x,  y(0)  4,  y(0)  1.
Now the differential equation is linear, the coefficients as well as g(x)  12x are continuous, 
and a2(x)  1  0 on any interval I containing x  0. We conclude from Theorem 3.1.1 that 
the given function is the unique solution on I.
The requirements in Theorem 3.1.1 that ai(x), i  0, 1, 2, . . ., n be continuous and an(x)  0 for 
every x in I are both important. Specifically, if an(x)  0 for some x in the interval, then the 
solution of a linear initial-value problem may not be unique or even exist. For example, you 
should verify that the function y  cx2  x  3 is a solution of the initial-value problem
 
x2y  2xy  2y  6,  y(0)  3,  y(0)  1
Theorem 3.1.1 
Existence of a Unique Solution
Let an(x), an1(x), . . . , a1(x), a0(x), and g(x) be continuous on an interval I, and let an(x)  0 
for every x in this interval. If x  x0 is any point in this interval, then a solution y(x) of the 
initial-value problem (1) exists on the interval and is unique.

on the interval (q, q) for any choice of the parameter c. In other words, there is no unique 
solution of the problem. Although most of the conditions of Theorem 3.1.1 are satisfied, the 
obvious difficulties are that a2(x)  x2 is zero at x  0 and that the initial conditions are also 
imposed at x  0.
 Boundary-Value Problem Another type of problem consists of solving a linear dif-
ferential equation of order two or greater in which the dependent variable y or its derivatives are 
specified at different points. A problem such as
Solve: 
a2(x) d 2y
dx2  a1(x) dy
dx  a0(x)y  g(x)
Subject to: y(a)  y0, y(b)  y1
is called a two-point boundary-value problem, or simply a boundary-value problem (BVP). 
The prescribed values y(a)  y0 and y(b)  y1 are called boundary conditions (BC). A solution 
of the foregoing problem is a function satisfying the differential equation on some interval I, 
containing a and b, whose graph passes through the two points (a, y0) and (b, y1). See FIGURE 3.1.1.
For a second-order differential equation, other pairs of boundary conditions could be
 
y(a)  y0, 
    y(b)  y1
 
    y(a)  y0, 
y(b)  y1
 
y(a)  y0, 
y(b)  y1,
where y0 and y1 denote arbitrary constants. These three pairs of conditions are just special cases 
of the general boundary conditions
 
A1 y(a)  B1 y(a)  C1
 
A2 y(b)  B2 y(b)  C2.
The next example shows that even when the conditions of Theorem 3.1.1 are fulfilled, a 
boundary-value problem may have several solutions (as suggested in Figure 3.1.1), a unique 
 solution, or no solution at all.
EXAMPLE 3 
A BVP Can Have Many, One, or No Solutions
In Example 9 of Section 1.1 we saw that the two-parameter family of solutions of the dif-
ferential equation x  16x  0 is
 
x  c1 cos 4t  c2 sin 4t. 
(2)
(a)  Suppose we now wish to determine that solution of the equation that further satisfies the 
boundary conditions x(0)  0, x(p/2)  0. Observe that the first condition 0  c1 cos 0  c2 sin 0 
implies c1  0, so that x  c2 sin 4t. But when t  p/2, 0  c2 sin 2p is satisfied for any choice 
of c2 since sin 2p  0. Hence the boundary-value problem
 
x0  16x  0, 
x (0)  0, 
x(p/2)  0 
(3)
has infinitely many solutions. FIGURE 3.1.2 shows the graphs of some of the members of the 
one-parameter family x  c2 sin 4t that pass through the two points (0, 0) and (p/2, 0).
(b)  If the boundary-value problem in (3) is changed to
 
x0  16x  0, 
x (0)  0, 
x(p/8)  0, 
(4)
then x(0)  0 still requires c1  0 in the solution (2). But applying x(p/8)  0 to x  c2 sin 4t
demands that 0  c2 sin(p/2)  c2 	 1. Hence x  0 is a solution of this new boundary-value 
problem. Indeed, it can be proved that x  0 is the only solution of (4).

(c) Finally, if we change the problem to
 
x  16x  0,  x(0)  0,  x(p/2)  1, 
(5)
 we find again that c1  0 from x(0)  0, but that applying x(p/2)  1 to x  c2 sin 4t leads 
to the contradiction 1  c2 sin 2p  c2 	 0  0. Hence the boundary-value problem (5) has 
no solution.
3.1.2 Homogeneous Equations
A linear nth-order differential equation of the form
 
an(x) d ny
dx n  an21(x) d n21y
dxn21  . . .  a1(x) dy
dx  a0(x) y  0 
(6)
is said to be homogeneous, whereas an equation 
 
an(x) d ny
dxn  an21(x) d n21y
dxn21  . . .  a1(x) dy
dx  a0(x) y  g(x) 
(7)
with g(x) not identically zero is said to be nonhomogeneous. For example, 2y  3y  5y  0 
is a homogeneous linear second-order differential equation, whereas x2y  6y  10y  ex is a 
nonhomogeneous linear third-order differential equation. The word homogeneous in this context 
does not refer to coefficients that are homogeneous functions as in Section 2.5; rather, the word 
has exactly the same meaning as in Section 2.3.
We shall see that in order to solve a nonhomogeneous linear equation (7), we must first be 
able to solve the associated homogeneous equation (6).
To avoid needless repetition throughout the remainder of this section, we shall, as a matter of 
course, make the following important assumptions when stating definitions and theorems about 
the linear equations (6) and (7). On some common interval I, 
• the coefficients ai(x), i  0, 1, 2, . . ., n, are continuous;
• the right-hand member g(x) is continuous; and
• an(x)  0 for every x in the interval.
 Differential Operators In calculus, differentiation is often denoted by the capital letter D; 
that is, dy/dx  Dy. The symbol D is called a differential operator because it transforms a differ-
entiable function into another function. For example, D(cos 4x)  4 sin 4x, and D(5x3  6x 2) 
15x2  12x. Higher-order derivatives can be expressed in terms of D in a natural manner:
 
d
dx
 ady
dxb  d 2y
dx2  D(Dy)  D2y and in general d ny
dx n  D ny,
where y represents a sufficiently differentiable function. Polynomial expressions involving D, 
such as D  3, D2  3D  4, and 5x3D3  6x2D2  4xD  9, are also differential operators. In 
general, we define an nth-order differential operator to be
 
L  an(x)Dn  an1(x)Dn1  . . .  a1(x)D  a0(x). 
(8)
As a consequence of two basic properties of differentiation, D(cf (x))  c Df (x), c a constant, 
and D{ f (x)  g(x)}  Df (x)  Dg(x), the differential operator L possesses a linearity property; 
that is, L operating on a linear combination of two differentiable functions is the same as the 
linear combination of L operating on the individual functions. In symbols, this means
 
L{af (x)  bg(x)}  aL( f (x))  bL(g(x)), 
(9)
where a and b are constants. Because of (9) we say that the nth-order differential operator L is 
a linear operator.
 Differential Equations Any linear differential equation can be expressed in terms of 
the D notation. For example, the differential equation y  5y  6y  5x  3 can be written as 
Note y  0 is always a 
solution of a homogeneous 
linear equation. 
Remember these assumptions 
in the deﬁ nitions and 
theorems of this chapter.

D2y  5Dy  6y  5x  3 or (D2  5D  6)y  5x  3. Using (8), the linear nth-order dif-
ferential equations (6) and (7) can be written compactly as
 
L( y)  0  and  L( y)  g(x),
respectively.
 Superposition Principle In the next theorem we see that the sum, or superposition, 
of two or more solutions of a homogeneous linear differential equation is also a solution.
Theorem 3.1.2 
Superposition Principle—Homogeneous Equations
Let y1, y2, . . . , yk be solutions of the homogeneous nth-order differential equation (6) on an 
interval I. Then the linear combination
 
y  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)  . . .  ck yk(x),
where the ci, i  1, 2, . . . , k are arbitrary constants, is also a solution on the interval.
Corollaries to Theorem 3.1.2
 
(a)  A constant multiple y  c1y1(x) of a solution y1(x) of a homogeneous linear 
 differential equation is also a solution.
 
(b) A homogeneous linear differential equation always possesses the trivial solution y  0.
Definition 3.1.1 
Linear Dependence/Independence
A set of functions f1(x), f2(x), . . ., fn(x) is said to be linearly dependent on an interval I if there 
exist constants c1, c2, . . ., cn, not all zero, such that
 
c1  f1(x)  c2  f2(x)  . . .  cn  fn(x)  0
for every x in the interval. If the set of functions is not linearly dependent on the interval, it is 
said to be linearly independent.
PROOF: We prove the case k  2. Let L be the differential operator defined in (8), and let y1(x) 
and y2(x) be solutions of the homogeneous equation L(y)  0. If we define y  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x), 
then by linearity of L we have
 
L(y)  L{c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)}  c1L( y1)  c2L( y2)  c1 	 0  c2 	 0  0.
EXAMPLE 4 
Superposition—Homogeneous DE
The functions y1  x2 and y2  x2 ln x are both solutions of the homogeneous linear equation 
x3y  2xy  4y  0 on the interval (0, q). By the superposition principle, the linear 
 combination
 
y  c1x2  c2x2 ln x
is also a solution of the equation on the interval.
The function y  e7x is a solution of y  9y  14y  0. Since the differential equation is 
linear and homogeneous, the constant multiple y  ce7x is also a solution. For various values of c 
we see that y  9e7x, y  0, y   
 !5e7x, . . ., are all solutions of the equation.
 Linear Dependence and Linear Independence The next two concepts are basic 
to the study of linear differential equations.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
In other words, a set of functions is linearly independent on an interval if the only constants 
for which
 
c1  f1(x)  c2  f2(x)  . . .  cn  fn(x)  0
for every x in the interval are c1  c2  . . .  cn  0.
It is easy to understand these definitions in the case of two functions f1(x) and f2(x). If the 
functions are linearly dependent on an interval, then there exist constants c1 and c2 that are not 
both zero such that for every x in the interval c1 f1(x)  c2 f2(x)  0. Therefore, if we assume that 
c1  0, it follows that f1(x)  (c2/c1)f2(x); that is
If two functions are linearly dependent, then one is simply a constant multiple of the other.
Conversely, if f1(x)  c2 f2(x) for some constant c2, then (1) 	 f1(x)  c2 f2(x)  0 for every x 
on some interval. Hence the functions are linearly dependent, since at least one of the constants 
(namely, c1  1) is not zero. We conclude that:
Two functions are linearly independent when neither is a constant multiple of the other 
on an interval.
For example, the functions f1(x)  sin 2x and f2(x)  sin x cos x are linearly dependent on 
(q, q) because f1(x) is a constant multiple of f2(x). Recall from the double angle formula for 
the sine that sin 2x  2 sin x cos x. On the other hand, the functions f1(x)  x and f2(x)  | x | are 
linearly independent on (q, q). Inspection of FIGURE 3.1.3 should convince you that neither 
function is a constant multiple of the other on the interval.
It follows from the preceding discussion that the ratio f2(x)/f1(x) is not a constant on an interval 
on which f1(x) and f2(x) are linearly independent. This little fact will be used in the next section.
EXAMPLE 5 
Linearly Dependent Functions
The functions f1(x)  cos2x, f2(x)  sin2x, f3(x)  sec2x, f4(x)  tan2x are linearly  dependent 
on the interval (p/2, p/2) since
 
c1 cos2x  c2 sin2x  c3 sec2x  c4 tan2x  0,
when c1  c2  1, c3  1, c4  1. We used here cos2x  sin2x  1 and 1  tan2x  sec2x 
for every number x in the interval.
A set of n functions f1(x), f2(x), . . ., fn(x) is linearly dependent on an interval I if at least one 
of the functions can be expressed as a linear combination of the remaining functions. For example, 
three functions f1(x), f2(x), and f3(x) are linearly dependent on I if at least one of these functions 
is a linear combination of the other two, say,
f3(x)  c1 f1(x)  c2 f2(x) 
for all x in I. A set of n functions is linearly independent on I if no one function is a linear com-
bination of the other functions.
EXAMPLE 6 
Linearly Dependent Functions
The functions f1(x)  !x  5, f2(x)  !x  5x, f3(x)  x 1, f4(x)  x 2 are linearly dependent 
on the interval (0, q) since f2 can be written as a linear combination of f1, f3, and f4. Observe that
 
f2(x)  1 	 f1(x)  5 	 f3(x)  0 	 f4(x)
for every x in the interval (0, q).
 Solutions of Differential Equations We are primarily interested in linearly inde-
pendent functions or, more to the point, linearly independent solutions of a linear differential 
equation. Although we could always appeal directly to Definition 3.1.1, it turns out that the 
question of whether n solutions y1, y2, . . ., yn of a homogeneous linear nth-order differential 
equation (6) are linearly independent can be settled somewhat mechanically using a determinant.

Definition 3.1.2 
Wronskian
Suppose each of the functions f1(x), f2(x), . . ., fn(x) possesses at least n 1 derivatives. The

where the primes denote derivatives, is called the Wronskian of the functions.
The Wronskian determinant is named after the Polish philosopher and mathematician Jósef 
Maria Hoëné-Wronski (1778–1853).
Theorem 3.1.3 
Criterion for Linearly Independent Solutions
Let y1, y2, . . ., yn be n solutions of the homogeneous linear nth-order differential equation (6) 
on an interval I. Then the set of solutions is linearly independent on I if and only if 
W(y1, y2, . . ., yn)  0 for every x in the interval.
It follows from Theorem 3.1.3 that when y1, y2, . . ., yn are n solutions of (6) on an interval I, 
the Wronskian W(y1, y2, . . ., yn) is either identically zero or never zero on the interval. Thus, if 
we can show that W(y1, y2, . . ., yn)  0 for some x0 in I, then the solutions y1, y2, . . ., yn are linearly 
independent on I. For example, the functions
 
y1(x)  cos(2 ln x)
x3
,   y2(x)  sin(2 ln x)
x3
are solutions of the differential equation
 
x2y  7xy  13y  0
on the interval (0, q). Note that the coefficient functions a2(x)  x2, a1(x)  7x, and a0(x)  13 
are continuous on (0, q) and that a2(x)  0 for every value of x in the interval. The Wronskian is

Rather than expanding this unwieldy determinant, we choose x  1 in the interval (0, q) and 
find
W(y1(1), y2(1))  `     1
3
0  
2  `  2.
The fact that W(y1(1), y2(1))  2  0 is sufficient to conclude that y1(x) and y2(x) are linearly 
independent on (0, q).
A set of n linearly independent solutions of a homogeneous linear nth-order differential equa-
tion is given a special name.
Definition 3.1.3 
Fundamental Set of Solutions
Any set y1, y2, . . ., yn of n linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous linear nth-order 
differential equation (6) on an interval I is said to be a fundamental set of solutions on the 
interval.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
The basic question of whether a fundamental set of solutions exists for a linear equation is 
answered in the next theorem.
Theorem 3.1.4 
Existence of a Fundamental Set
There exists a fundamental set of solutions for the homogeneous linear nth-order  differential 
equation (6) on an interval I.
Theorem 3.1.5 
General Solution—Homogeneous Equations
Let y1, y2, . . ., yn be a fundamental set of solutions of the homogeneous linear nth-order differ-
ential equation (6) on an interval I. Then the general solution of the equation on the interval is
y  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)  . . .  cn yn(x),
where ci, i  1, 2, . . ., n are arbitrary constants.
Analogous to the fact that any vector in three dimensions can be expressed uniquely as a linear 
combination of the linearly independent vectors i, j, k, any solution of an nth-order homogeneous 
linear differential equation on an interval I can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of n 
linearly independent solutions on I. In other words, n linearly independent solutions y1, y2, . . ., yn 
are the basic building blocks for the general solution of the equation.
Theorem 3.1.5 states that if Y(x) is any solution of (6) on the interval, then constants C1, C2, . . ., 
Cn can always be found so that
 
Y(x)  C1 y1(x)  C2 y2(x)   . . .  Cn yn(x).
We will prove the case when n  2.
PROOF: Let Y be a solution and y1 and y2 be linearly independent solutions of a2 y  a1 y 
a0 y  0 on an interval I. Suppose x  t is a point in I for which W( y1(t), y2(t))  0. Suppose also 
that Y(t)  k1 and Y(t)  k2. If we now examine the equations
 
C1y1(t)  C2 y2(t)  k1
 
    C1y1(t)  C2 y2(t)  k2,
it follows that we can determine C1 and C2 uniquely, provided that the determinant of the coef-
ficients satisfies
 
2 y1(t)
y2(t)
y19(t)
y29(t) 2 2 0.
But this determinant is simply the Wronskian evaluated at x  t, and, by assumption, W  0. 
If we define G(x)  C1y1(x)  C2 y2(x), we observe that G(x) satisfies the differential equation, 
since it is a superposition of two known solutions; G(x) satisfies the initial conditions
 
G(t)  C1 y1(t)  C2 y2(t)  k1  and  G(t)  C1 y1(t)  C2 y2(t)  k2;
Y(x) satisfies the same linear equation and the same initial conditions. Since the solution of this 
linear initial-value problem is unique (Theorem 3.1.1), we have Y(x)  G(x) or Y(x)  C1 y1(x)  
C2 y2(x).
EXAMPLE 7 
General Solution of a Homogeneous DE
The functions y1  e3x and y2  e3x are both solutions of the homogeneous linear equation 
y  9y  0 on the interval (q, q). By inspection, the solutions are linearly independent 
on the x-axis. This fact can be corroborated by observing that the Wronskian
 
W(e3x, e3x)  2 e3x
e3x
3e3x
3e3x2  6 2 0
for every x. We conclude that y1 and y2 form a fundamental set of solutions, and consequently 
y  c1e3x  c2e3x is the general solution of the equation on the interval.

A Solution Obtained from a General Solution
The function y  4 sinh 3x  5e3x is a solution of the differential equation in Example 7. 
(Verify this.) In view of Theorem 3.1.5, we must be able to obtain this solution from the 
 general solution y  c1e3x  c2e3x. Observe that if we choose c1  2 and c2  7, then
y  2e3x  7e3x can be rewritten as
 
y  2e3x 2 2e3x 2 5e3x  4 ae3x 2 e3x

b 2 5e3x.
The last expression is recognized as y  4 sinh 3x  5e3x.

The functions y1  ex, y2  e2x, and y3  e3x satisfy the third-order equation y  6y 

e3x
ex

3e3x
ex
4e2x
9e3x
3  2e6x 2 0
for every real value of x, the functions y1, y2, and y3 form a fundamental set of solutions on 
(q, q). We conclude that y  c1ex  c2e2x  c3e3x is the general solution of the differential 
equation on the interval.
3.1.3 Nonhomogeneous Equations
Any function yp free of arbitrary parameters that satisfies (7) is said to be a particular solution
of the equation. For example, it is a straightforward task to show that the constant function 
yp  3 is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation y  9y  27.
Now if y1, y2, . . ., yk are solutions of (6) on an interval I and yp is any particular solution of (7) 
on I, then the linear combination
 
y  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)   . . .  ck yk(x)  yp(x) 
(10)
is also a solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (7). If you think about it, this makes sense, 
because the linear combination c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)  . . .  ck yk(x) is mapped into 0 by the opera-
tor L  anDn  an1Dn1  . . .  a1D  a0, whereas yp is mapped into g(x). If we use k  n
linearly independent solutions of the nth-order equation (6), then the expression in (10) becomes 
the general solution of (7).
Theorem 3.1.6 
General Solution—Nonhomogeneous Equations
Let yp be any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous linear nth-order differential equation (7) 
on an interval I, and let y1, y2, . . ., yn be a fundamental set of solutions of the associated ho- 
mogeneous differential equation (6) on I. Then the general solution of the equation on the 
interval is
 
y  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)  . . .  cn yn(x)  yp (x),
where the ci, i  1, 2, . . ., n are arbitrary constants.
PROOF: Let L be the differential operator defined in (8), and let Y(x) and yp(x) be particular 
solutions of the nonhomogeneous equation L( y)  g(x). If we define u(x)  Y(x)  yp(x), then 
by linearity of L we have
 
L(u)  L{Y(x)  yp(x)}  L(Y(x))  L( yp(x))  g(x)  g(x)  0.
This shows that u(x) is a solution of the homogeneous equation L(y)  0. Hence, by Theorem 3.1.5, 
u(x)  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)  . . .  cn yn(x), and so
 
Y(x)  yp(x)  c1 y1(x)  c2  y2(x)  . . .  cn yn(x)
or 
Y(x)  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)  . . .  cn yn(x)  yp(x).

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
 Complementary Function We see in Theorem 3.1.6 that the general solution of a 
nonhomogeneous linear equation consists of the sum of two functions:
 
y  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)   . . .  cn yn(x)  yp(x)  yc(x)  yp(x).
The linear combination yc(x)  c1 y1(x)  c2 y2(x)   . . .  cn yn(x), which is the general solution 
of (6), is called the complementary function for equation (7). In other words, to solve a nonho-
mogeneous linear differential equation we first solve the associated  homogeneous equation and 
then find any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation. The general solution of the 
nonhomogeneous equation is then
 
y  complementary function  any particular solution.
EXAMPLE 10 
General Solution of a Nonhomogeneous DE
By substitution, the function yp  11
12  1
2x is readily shown to be a particular solution of the 
nonhomogeneous equation
 
y  6y  11y  6y  3x. 
(11)
In order to write the general solution of (11), we must also be able to solve the associated 
homogeneous equation
 
y  6y  11y  6y  0.
But in Example 9 we saw that the general solution of this latter equation on the interval 
(q, q) was yc  c1ex  c2e2x  c3e3x. Hence the general solution of (11) on the interval is
 
y  yc  yp  c1e x  c2e2x  c3e3x 2 11
12 2 1
2x.
 Another Superposition Principle The last theorem of this discussion will be useful 
in Section 3.4, when we consider a method for finding particular solutions of nonhomogeneous 
equations.
Theorem 3.1.7 
Superposition Principle—Nonhomogeneous Equations
Let yp1, yp2, . . ., ypk be k particular solutions of the nonhomogeneous linear nth-order differen-
tial equation (7) on an interval I corresponding, in turn, to k distinct functions g1, g2, . . ., gk. 
That is, suppose ypi denotes a particular solution of the corresponding differential equation
 
an(x)y(n)  an1(x)y(n1)  . . .  a1(x)y  a0(x)y  gi(x), 
(12)
where i  1, 2, . . ., k. Then
 
yp(x)  yp1(x)  yp2(x)  . . .  ypk(x) 
(13)
is a particular solution of
 
an(x)y(n)  an1(x)y(n1)  . . .  a1(x)y  a0(x)y
 g1(x)  g2(x)  . . .  gk(x). 
(14)
PROOF: We prove the case k  2. Let L be the differential operator defined in (8), and let yp1(x) 
and yp2(x) be particular solutions of the nonhomogeneous equations L(y)  g1(x) and L(y)  g2(x),

respectively. If we define yp(x)  yp1(x)  yp2(x), we want to show that yp is a particular solution 
of L( y)  g1(x)  g2(x). The result follows again by the linearity of the operator L:
 
L( yp)  L{ yp1(x)  yp2(x)}  L( yp1(x))  L( yp2(x))  g1(x)  g2(x).
EXAMPLE 11 
Superposition—Nonhomogeneous DE
You should verify that
 
yp1  4x2 
is a particular solution of 
y  3y  4y  16x2  24x  8,
 
yp2  e2x

yp3  xex 
is a particular solution of 
y  3y  4y  2xex  ex.
It follows from Theorem 3.1.7 that the superposition of yp1, yp2, and yp3,
 
y  yp1  yp2  yp3  4x2  e2x  xex,
is a solution of

If the ypi are particular solutions of (12) for i  1, 2, . . ., k, then the linear com bination 
 
yp  c1yp1  c2 yp2  . . .  ck ypk,
where the ci are constants, is also a particular solution of (14) when the right-hand member of 
the equation is the linear combination
 
c1g1(x)  c2g2(x)  . . .  ckgk(x).
Before we actually start solving homogeneous and nonhomogeneous linear differential equa-
tions, we need one additional bit of theory presented in the next section.
REMARKS
This remark is a continuation of the brief discussion of dynamical systems given at the end 
of Section 1.3.
A dynamical system whose rule or mathematical model is a linear nth-order  differential 
equation
 
an(t)y(n)  an1(t)y(n1)  . . .  a1(t)y  a0(t)y  g(t)
is said to be a linear system. The set of n time-dependent functions y(t), y(t), . . ., y(n1)(t) are 
the state variables of the system. Recall, their values at some time t give the state of the 
system. The function g is variously called the input function or forcing function. A solution 
y(t) of the differential equation is said to be the output or response of the system. Under the 
conditions stated in Theorem 3.1.1, the output or response y(t) is uniquely determined by 
the input and the state of the system prescribed at a time t0; that is, by the initial conditions 
y(t0), y(t0), . . ., y(n1)(t0).
In order that a dynamical system be a linear system, it is necessary that the superposition 
principle (Theorem 3.1.7) hold in the system; that is, the response of the system to a superposi-
tion of inputs is a superposition of outputs. We have already examined some simple linear 
systems in Section 2.7 (linear first-order equations); in Section 3.8 we examine linear systems 
in which the mathematical models are second-order differential equations.
This sentence is a generalization 
of Theorem 3.1.7.

3.2 Reduction of Order
INTRODUCTION In Section 3.1 we saw that the general solution of a homogeneous linear 
second-order differential equation
 
a2(x)y  a1(x)y  a0(x)y  0 
(1)
was a linear combination y  c1y1  c2 y2, where y1 and y2 are solutions that constitute a linearly 
independent set on some interval I. Beginning in the next section we examine a method for 
determining these solutions when the coefficients of the DE in (1) are constants. This method, 
which is a straightforward exercise in algebra, breaks down in a few cases and yields only a 
single solution y1 of the DE. It turns out that we can construct a second solution y2 of a homo-
geneous equation (1) (even when the coefficients in (1) are variable) provided that we know 
one nontrivial solution y1 of the DE. The basic idea described in this section is that the linear 
second-order equation (1) can be reduced to a linear first-order DE by means of a substitution 
involving the known solution y1. A second solution, y2 of (1), is apparent after this first-order 
DE is solved.
 Reduction of Order Suppose y(x) denotes a known solution of equation (1). We seek 
a second solution y2(x) of (1) so that y1 and y2 are linearly independent on some interval I. 
Recall that if y1 and y2 are linearly independent, then their ratio y2/y1 is nonconstant on I; that is,

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
y2/y1  u(x) or y2(x)  u(x)y1(x). The idea is to find u(x) by substituting y2(x)  u(x)y1(x) into 
the given differential equation. This method is called reduction of order since we must solve a 
first-order equation to find u.
The first example illustrates the basic technique.
EXAMPLE 1 
Finding a Second Solution
Given that y1  e x is a solution of y  y  0 on the interval (q, q), use reduction of order 
to find a second solution y2.
SOLUTION If y  u(x)y1(x)  u(x)e x, then the first two derivatives of y are obtained from 
the product rule:
 
y  ue x  e xu,  y  ue x  2e xu  e xu.
By substituting y and y into the original DE, it simplifies to
 
y  y  e x(u  2u)  0.
Since e x  0, the last equation requires u  2u  0. If we make the substitution w  u, this 
linear second-order equation in u becomes w  2w  0, which is a linear first-order equation 
in w. Using the integrating factor e2x, we can write d/dx [e2xw]  0. After integrating we get 
w  c1e2x or u  c1e2x. Integrating again then yields u  1
2 c1e2x  c2. Thus
 
y  u(x)e x  c1
2  ex  c2e x. 
(2)
By choosing c2  0 and c1  2 we obtain the desired second solution, y2  ex. Because 
W(e x, ex )  0 for every x, the solutions are linearly independent on (q, q).
Since we have shown that y1  e x and y2  ex are linearly independent solutions of a linear 
second-order equation, the expression in (2) is actually the general solution of y  y  0 on 
the interval (q, q).
 General Case Suppose we divide by a2(x) in order to put equation (1) in the standard form
 
y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  0, 
(3)
where P(x) and Q(x) are continuous on some interval I. Let us suppose further that y1(x) 
is a known solution of (3) on I and that y1(x)  0 for every x in the interval. If we define 
y  u(x)y1(x), it follows that
 
y  uy1  y1u,  y  uy1  2y1u  y1u
 
y  Py  Qy  u[ y1  Py1  Qy1]  y1u  (2y1  Py1)u  0.
 
 
zero
This implies that we must have
 
y1u  (2y1  Py1)u  0  or  y1w  (2y1  Py1)w  0, 
(4)
where we have let w  u. Observe that the last equation in (4) is both linear and separable. 
Separating variables and integrating, we obtain

y1
 dx  P dx  0
 
ln Zwy2
1Z  #P dx  c  or  wy2

We solve the last equation for w, use w  u, and integrate again:
 
u  c1#
eePdx

By choosing c1  1 and c2  0, we find from y  u(x)y1(x) that a second solution of equation (3) is
 
 y2  y1(x)#
eeP(x) dx
y2
1(x)  dx. 
(5)
It makes a good review of differentiation to verify that the function y2(x) defined in (5) satisfies 
equation (3) and that y1 and y2 are linearly independent on any interval on which y1(x) is not zero.

Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients
INTRODUCTION We have seen that the linear first-order DE y  ay  0, where a is a 
 constant, possesses the exponential solution y  c1eax on the interval (q, q). Therefore, it is 
natural to ask whether exponential solutions exist for homogeneous linear higher-order DEs
 
an y(n)  an1 y(n1)   . . .  a1 y  a0 y  0, 
(1)
where the coefficients ai, i  0, 1, . . ., n are real constants and an  0. The surprising fact is that 
all solutions of these higher-order equations are either exponential functions or are constructed 
out of exponential functions.
 Auxiliary Equation We begin by considering the special case of a second-order  equation
 
ay  by  cy  0. 
(2)
If we try a solution of the form y  emx, then after substituting y  memx and y  m2emx equa-
tion (2) becomes
 
am2emx  bmemx  cemx  0  or  emx(am2  bm  c)  0.
Since emx is never zero for real values of x, it is apparent that the only way that this exponential 
function can satisfy the differential equation (2) is to choose m as a root of the quadratic equation
 
am2  bm  c  0. 
(3)
This last equation is called the auxiliary equation of the differential equation (2). Since the two 
roots of (3) are m1  (b  "b2 2 4ac2/2a and m2  (b  "b2 2 4ac2/2a, there will be 
three forms of the general solution of (1) corresponding to the three cases:
• m1 and m2 are real and distinct (b2  4ac 
 0),
• m1 and m2 are real and equal (b2  4ac  0), and
• m1 and m2 are conjugate complex numbers (b2  4ac  0).
We discuss each of these cases in turn.

 
3.3 Homogeneous Linear Equations with Constant Coefficients 
| 121
 
Case I : 
 Distinct Real Roots Under the assumption that the auxiliary equation (3) 
has two unequal real roots m1 and m2, we find two solutions, y1  em1x and 
y2  em2x, respectively. We see that these functions are linearly independent 
on (q, q) and hence form a fundamental set. It follows that the general 
solution of (2) on this interval is
 
y  c1em1x  c2 em2x. 
(4)
 
Case II :  Repeated Real Roots When m1  m2 we necessarily obtain only one expo-
nential solution, y1  em1x. From the quadratic formula we find that m1  b/2a 
since the only way to have m1  m2 is to have b2  4ac  0. It follows from 
the discussion in Section 3.2 that a second solution of the equation is
 
y2  em1x#
e2m1x
e2m1x dx  em1x#dx  xem1x.
 
(5)
 
 
In (5) we have used the fact that b/a  2m1. The general solution is then
 
y  c1em1x  c2xem1x. 
(6)
 
Case III :  Conjugate Complex Roots If m1 and m2 are complex, then we can write 
m1  a  ib and m2  a  ib, where a and b 
 0 are real and i2  1. 
Formally, there is no difference between this case and Case I, hence
 
y  C1e(aib)x  C2e(aib)x.
 
 
 However, in practice we prefer to work with real functions instead of complex 
exponentials. To this end we use Euler’s formula:
 
eiu  cos u  i sin u,
 
 
where u is any real number.* It follows from this formula that
 
eibx  cos bx  i sin bx  and  eibx  cos bx – i sin bx, 
(7)
 
 
 where we have used cos(bx)  cos bx and sin(bx)  sin bx. Note that 
by first adding and then subtracting the two equations in (7), we obtain, 
 respectively,
 
eibx  eibx  2 cos bx  and  eibx  eibx  2i sin bx.
 
 
 Since y  C1e(aib)x  C2e(aib)x is a solution of (2) for any choice of the 
constants C1 and C2, the choices C1  C2  1 and C1  1, C2  1 give, in 
turn, two solutions:
 
y1  e(aib)x  e(aib)x  and  y2  e(aib)x  e(aib)x.
 
 
But 
y1  eax(eibx  eibx)  2eax cos bx
 
 
and 
y2  eax(eibx  eibx)  2ieax sin bx.
*A formal derivation of Euler’s formula can be obtained from the Maclaurin series e x  g
q
n = 0x n/n! by 
substituting x  iu, using i2  1, i3  i, . . ., and then separating the series into real and imaginary 
parts. The plausibility thus established, we can adopt cos u  i sin u as the definition of eiu.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
Hence from Corollary (a) of Theorem 3.1.2 the last two results show that eax cos bx and 
eax sin bx are real solutions of (2). Moreover, these solutions form a fundamental set on 
(q, q). Consequently, the general solution of (2) on (q, q) is
 
y  c1eax cos bx  c2eax sin bx  eax(c1 cos bx  c2 sin bx).

b  !3, we have
 
y  e2x(c1 cos !3x  c2 sin!3x).
EXAMPLE 2 
An Initial-Value Problem
Solve the initial-value problem 4y  4y  17y  0, y(0)  1, y(0)  2.
SOLUTION By the quadratic formula we find that the roots of the auxiliary equation 4m2  4m  
17  0 are m1  1
2  2i and m2  1
2  2i. Thus from (8) we have y  ex/2(c1 cos 2x  
c2 sin 2x). Applying the condition y(0)  1, we see from e0(c1 cos 0  c2 sin 0)  1 
that c1  1. Differentiating y  ex/2(cos 2x  c2 sin 2x) and then using y(0)  2 gives 
2c2  1
2  2 or c2  3
4. Hence the solution of the IVP is y  ex/2(cos 2x  3
4 sin 2x). In 
FIGURE 3.3.1 we see that the solution is oscillatory but y S 0 as x S q.
 Two Equations Worth Knowing The two differential equations
 
y  k2y  0  and  y  k2y  0,
k real, are important in applied mathematics. For y  k 2y  0, the auxiliary equation m2  k 2  0 
has imaginary roots m1  ki and m2  ki. With a  0 and b  k in (8), the general solution 
of the DE is seen to be
 
y  c1 cos kx  c2 sin kx. 
(9)
On the other hand, the auxiliary equation m2  k2  0 for y  k2y  0 has distinct real roots 
m1  k and m2  k and so by (4) the general solution of the DE is
 
y  c1ekx  c2ekx. 
(10)
Notice that if we choose c1  c2  1
2 and c1  1

 Higher-Order Equations In general, to solve an nth-order differential equation
 
an y(n)  an1 y(n  1)   . . .  a2 y  a1 y  a0 y  0, 
(12)
where the ai, i  0, 1, . . ., n are real constants, we must solve an nth-degree polynomial equation
 
anmn  an1mn1   . . .  a2m2  a1m  a0  0. 
(13)
If all the roots of (13) are real and distinct, then the general solution of (12) is
y  c1em1x  c2em2x   . . .  cnemn x.
It is somewhat harder to summarize the analogues of Cases II and III because the roots of an 
auxiliary equation of degree greater than two can occur in many combinations. For example, 
a fifth-degree equation could have five distinct real roots, or three distinct real and two com-
plex roots, or one real and four complex roots, or five real but equal roots, or five real roots 
but with two of them equal, and so on. When m1 is a root of multiplicity k of an nth-degree 
auxiliary equation (that is, k roots are equal to m1), it can be shown that the linearly independent 
solutions are
em1x,  xem1x,  x2em1x, p  ,  x
 k21em1x
and the general solution must contain the linear combination
c1em1x  c2  xem1x  c3  x2em1x  . . .  ck  xk1em1x.
Lastly, it should be remembered that when the coefficients are real, complex roots of an auxiliary 
equation always appear in conjugate pairs. Thus, for example, a cubic polynomial equation can 
have at most two complex roots.
EXAMPLE 3 
Third-Order DE
Solve y  3y  4y  0.
SOLUTION It should be apparent from inspection of m3  3m2  4  0 that one root is 
m1  1 and so m  1 is a factor of m3  3m2  4. By division we find
 
m3  3m2  4  (m  1)(m2  4m  4)  (m  1)(m  2)2,
and so the other roots are m2  m3  2. Thus the general solution is
 
y  c1e x  c2e2x  c3xe2x.

SOLUTION The auxiliary equation m4  2m2  1  (m2  1)2  0 has roots m1  m3  i 
and m2  m4  i. Thus from Case II the solution is
 
y  C1eix  C2eix  C3xeix  C4xeix.
By Euler’s formula the grouping C1eix  C2eix can be rewritten as c1 cos x  c2 sin x after a 
relabeling of constants. Similarly, x(C3eix  C4eix) can be expressed as x(c3 cos x  c4 sin x). 
Hence the general solution is
 
y  c1 cos x  c2 sin x  c3 x cos x  c4 x sin x.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
Example 4 illustrates a special case when the auxiliary equation has repeated complex roots. 
In general, if m1  a  ib, b 
 0, is a complex root of multiplicity k of an auxiliary equation 
with real coefficients, then its conjugate m2  a  ib is also a root of multiplicity k. From the 
2k complex-valued solutions
 
e(aib)x, xe(aib)x, x2e(aib)x, . . . , x k1e(aib)x
 
e(aib)x, xe(aib)x, x2e(aib)x, . . . , x k1e(aib)x
we conclude, with the aid of Euler’s formula, that the general solution of the corresponding differ-
ential equation must then contain a linear combination of the 2k real linearly independent solutions
 
eax cos bx, xeax cos bx, x2eax cos bx, . . . , x k1eax cos bx
 
eax sin bx, xeax sin bx, x2eax sin bx, . . . , x k1eax sin bx.
In Example 4 we identify k  2, a  0, and b  1.
 Rational Roots Of course the most difficult aspect of solving constant-coefficient 
 differential equations is finding roots of auxiliary equations of degree greater than two. 
Something we can try is to test the auxiliary equation for rational roots. Recall from precalcu-
lus mathematics, if m1  p/q is a rational root (expressed in lowest terms) of a polynomial 
equation anmn  . . .  a1m  a0  0 with integer coefficients, then the integer p is a factor of 
the constant term a0 and the integer q is a factor of the leading coefficient an.
EXAMPLE 5 
Finding Rational Roots
Solve 3y  5y  10y  4y  0.
SOLUTION To solve the equation we must solve the cubic polynomial auxiliary equation 
3m3  5m2  10m  4  0. With the identifications a0  4 and a3  3 then the integer 
factors of a0 and a3 are, respectively, p: 1, 2, 4 and q: 1, 3. So the possible rational 
roots of the cubic equation are
 
p
q: 1, 2, 4, 1
3, 2
3, 4
3.
Each of these numbers can then be tested—say, by synthetic division. In this way we discover 
both the root m1  1
3 and the factorization
 
3m3  5m2  10m  4  (m  1
3)(3m2  6m  12).
The quadratic formula applied to 3m2  6m  12  0 then yields the remaining two roots 
m2  1 2 !3i and m3  1  !3i. Therefore the general solution of the given differ-
ential equation is y  c1ex>3  ex(c2 cos!3x  c3 sin!3x).
 Use of Computers Finding roots or approximations of roots of polynomial equations 
is a routine problem with an appropriate calculator or computer software. The computer algebra 
systems Mathematica and Maple can solve polynomial equations (in one variable) of degree less 
than five in terms of algebraic formulas. For the auxiliary equation in the preceding paragraph, 
the commands
 
Solve[3 m∧3  5 m∧2  10 m  4  0, m] 
(in Mathematica)
 
solve(3*m∧3  5*m∧2  10*m  4, m); 
(in Maple)
yield immediately their representations of the roots 1
3, 1  !3i, 1  !3i. For auxiliary 
equations of higher degree it may be necessary to resort to numerical commands such as NSolve 
and FindRoot in Mathematica. Because of their capability of solving polynomial equations, it 
is not surprising that some computer algebra systems are also able to give explicit solutions of 
homogeneous linear constant-coefficient differential equations. For example, the inputs
 
DSolve [y[x]  2 y[x]  2 y[x]  0, y[x], x] 
(in Mathematica)
 
dsolve(diff(y(x), x$2)  2*diff(y(x), x)  2*y(x)  0, y(x)); 
(in Maple)

and 
y(x)  _C1 exp(–x) sin(x) –  _C2 exp(–x) cos(x)
Translated, this means y  c2ex cos x  c1ex sin x is a solution of y  2y  2y  0.
In the classic text Differential Equations by Ralph Palmer Agnew* (used by the author as a 
student), the following statement is made:
It is not reasonable to expect students in this course to have computing skills and 
 equipment necessary for efficient solving of equations such as
 
4.317 d 4y
dx4  2.179 d 3y
dx3  1.416 d 2y
dx2  1.295 dy
dx  3.169y  0. 
(15)
Although it is debatable whether computing skills have improved in the intervening years, it is a 
certainty that technology has. If one has access to a computer algebra system, equation (15) could 
be considered reasonable. After simplification and some relabeling of the output, Mathematica 
yields the (approximate) general solution
 
y  c1e0.728852x cos(0.618605x)  c2e0.728852x sin(0.618605x)
 
 c3e0.476478x cos(0.759081x)  c4e0.476478x sin(0.759081x).
We note in passing that the DSolve and dsolve commands in Mathematica and Maple, like most 
aspects of any CAS, have their limitations.
Finally, if we are faced with an initial-value problem consisting of, say, a fourth-order differential 
equation, then to fit the general solution of the DE to the four initial conditions we must solve a 
system of four linear equations in four unknowns (the c1, c2, c3, c4 in the general solution). Using 
a CAS to solve the system can save lots of time. See Problems 35, 36, 69, and 70 in Exercises 3.3.

3.4 Undetermined Coefficients
INTRODUCTION To solve a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation
 
an y(n)  an1 y(n1)   . . .  a1 y  a0 y  g(x) 
(1)
we must do two things: (i) find the complementary function yc; and (ii) find any particular solu-
tion yp of the nonhomogeneous equation. Then, as discussed in Section 3.1, the general solution 
of (1) on an interval I is y  yc  yp.
The complementary function yc is the general solution of the associated homogeneous DE 
of (1), that is
 
an y(n)  an1 y(n1)   . . .  a1 y  a0 y  0.
In the last section we saw how to solve these kinds of equations when the coefficients were 
constants. Our goal then in the present section is to examine a method for obtaining particular 
solutions.
 Method of Undetermined Coefficients The first of two ways we shall consider 
for obtaining a particular solution yp is called the method of undetermined coefficients. The 
underlying idea in this method is a conjecture, an educated guess really, about the form of yp 
motivated by the kinds of functions that make up the input function g(x). The general method is 
limited to nonhomogeneous linear DEs such as (1) where
• the coefficients, ai, i  0, 1, . . ., n are constants, and
•  where g(x) is a constant, a polynomial function, exponential function eax, sine or cosine 
functions sin bx or cos bx, or finite sums and products of these functions.
Strictly speaking, g(x)  k (a constant) is a polynomial function. Since a constant function 
is probably not the first thing that comes to mind when you think of polynomial functions, 
for emphasis we shall continue to use the redundancy “constant functions, polynomial 
functions, . . ..”
A constant k is a polynomial 
function of degree 0.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
The following functions are some examples of the types of inputs g(x) that are appropriate for 
this discussion:
 
g(x)  10,  g(x)  x2  5x,  g(x)  15x  6  8ex
 
g(x)  sin 3x  5x cos 2x,  g(x)  xe x sin x  (3x2  1)e4x.
That is, g(x) is a linear combination of functions of the type
P(x)  anx n  an1x n1   . . .  a1x  a0, P(x)eax, P(x)eax sin bx, and P(x)eax cos bx,
where n is a nonnegative integer and a and b are real numbers. The method of undetermined 
coefficients is not applicable to equations of form (1) when
 
g(x)  ln x,  g(x)  1
x,  g(x)  tan x,  g(x)  sin1x,
and so on. Differential equations in which the input g(x) is a function of this last kind will be 
considered in Section 3.5.
The set of functions that consists of constants, polynomials, exponentials eax, sines, and 
cosines has the remarkable property that derivatives of their sums and products are again sums 
and products of constants, polynomials, exponentials eax, sines, and cosines. Since the linear 
combination of derivatives an yp
(n)  an1 yp
(n1)   . . .  a1yp  a0 yp must be identical to g(x), it 
seems reasonable to assume that yp has the same form as g(x).
The next two examples illustrate the basic method.
EXAMPLE 1 
General Solution Using Undetermined Coefficients
Solve y  4y – 2y  2x2  3x  6. 
(2)
SOLUTION Step 1 We first solve the associated homogeneous equation y  4y – 2y  0. 
From the quadratic formula we find that the roots of the auxiliary equation m2  4m  2  0 
are m1  2  !6 and m2  2  !6. Hence the complementary function is
 
yc  c1e(2"6 ) x  c2e(2"6 ) x.
Step 2 Now, since the function g(x) is a quadratic polynomial, let us assume a particular 
solution that is also in the form of a quadratic polynomial:
 
yp  Ax 2  Bx  C.
We seek to determine specific coefficients A, B, and C for which yp is a solution of (2). 
Substituting yp and the derivatives yp  2Ax  B and yp  2A into the given differential 
equation (2), we get
 
yp  4yp  2yp  2A  8Ax  4B  2Ax 2  2Bx  2C 
 
 2x 2  3x  6.
Since the last equation is supposed to be an identity, the coefficients of like powers of x must 
be equal:
 
–2A
x2 +
8A – 2B
x + 2A + 4B – 2C = 2x2 – 3x + 6.
equal
That is,
 
2A  2,  8A  2B  3,  2A  4B  2C  6.

Solving this system of equations leads to the values A  1, B  5
2, and C  9. Thus a 
particular solution is
 
yp  x2 2 5
2
 x 2 9.
Step 3 The general solution of the given equation is
 
y  yc  yp  c1e(2"6 ) x  c2e (2"6 ) x 2 x2 2 5
2x 2 9.
EXAMPLE 2 
Particular Solution Using Undetermined Coefficients
Find a particular solution of y  y  y  2 sin 3x.
SOLUTION A natural first guess for a particular solution would be A sin 3x. But since suc-
cessive differentiations of sin 3x produce sin 3x and cos 3x, we are prompted instead to  assume 
a particular solution that includes both of these terms:
 
yp  A cos 3x  B sin 3x.
Differentiating yp and substituting the results into the differential equation gives, after 
regrouping,
 
yp  yp  yp  (8A  3B) cos 3x  (3A  8B) sin 3x  2 sin 3x
or
 
–8A – 3B cos 3x + 3A – 8B sin 3x = 0 cos 3x + 2 sin 3x.
equal
From the resulting system of equations,
8A  3B  0,  3A  8B  2,
we get A  6
73 and B  16
73. A particular solution of the equation is
 
yp  6
73
 cos 3x 2 16
73
 sin 3x.
As we mentioned, the form that we assume for the particular solution yp is an educated guess; 
it is not a blind guess. This educated guess must take into consideration not only the types of 
functions that make up g(x) but also, as we shall see in Example 4, the functions that make up 
the complementary function yc.
EXAMPLE 3 
Forming yp by Superposition
Solve y  2y – 3y  4x  5  6xe2x. 
(3)
SOLUTION Step 1 First, the solution of the associated homogeneous equation y  2y – 3y  0 
is found to be yc  c1ex  c2e3x.
Step 2 Next, the presence of 4x  5 in g(x) suggests that the particular solution includes a 
linear polynomial. Furthermore, since the derivative of the product xe2x produces 2xe2x and 
e2x, we also assume that the particular solution includes both xe2x and e2x. In other words, 
g is the sum of two basic kinds of functions:
 
g(x)  g1(x)  g2(x)  polynomial  exponentials.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
Correspondingly, the superposition principle for nonhomogeneous equations (Theorem 3.1.7) 
suggests that we seek a particular solution 
 
yp  yp1  yp2,
where yp1  Ax  B and yp2  Cxe2x  Ee2x. Substituting
 
yp  Ax  B  Cxe2x  Ee2x
into the given equation (3) and grouping like terms gives
 
yp  2yp  3yp  3Ax  2A  3B  3Cxe2x  (2C  3E)e2x  4x  5  6xe2x. (4)
From this identity we obtain the four equations
 
3A  4,  2A  3B  5,  3C  6,  2C  3E  0.
The last equation in this system results from the interpretation that the coefficient of e2x in 
the right member of (4) is zero. Solving, we find A  4
3, B  23
9 , C  2, and E  4
3. 
Consequently,
 
yp  4
3 x  23
9 2 2xe2x 2 4
3 e2x.
Step 3 The general solution of the equation is
 
y  c1ex  c2e3x 2 4
3 x  23
9 2 a2x  4
3b  e2x.
In light of the superposition principle (Theorem 3.1.7), we can also approach Example 3 from 
the viewpoint of solving two simpler problems. You should verify that substituting
 
yp1  Ax  B 
into 
y  2y – 3y  4x  5
and 
yp2  Cxe2x  Ee2x 
into 
y  2y – 3y  6xe2x
yields, in turn, yp1  4
3 x  23
9  and yp2   (2x  4
3) e2x. A particular solution of (3) is then 
yp  yp1  yp2.
The next example illustrates that sometimes the “obvious” assumption for the form of yp is 
not a correct assumption.
EXAMPLE 4 
A Glitch in the Method
Find a particular solution of y  5y  4y  8ex.
SOLUTION Differentiation of ex produces no new functions. Thus, proceeding as we did in 
the earlier examples, we can reasonably assume a particular solution of the form yp  Ae x. 
But substitution of this expression into the differential equation yields the contradictory state-
ment 0  8e x, and so we have clearly made the wrong guess for yp.
  The difficulty here is apparent upon examining the complementary function yc  c1ex  
c2e4x. Observe that our assumption Ae x is already present in yc. This means that e x is a solution 
of the associated homogeneous differential equation, and a constant multiple Ae x when 
substituted into the differential equation necessarily produces zero.
  What then should be the form of yp? Inspired by Case II of Section 3.3, let’s see whether 
we can find a particular solution of the form
 
yp  Axe x.

the solution of Example 3.

Substituting y 
p  Axe x  Ae x and y 
p  Axe x  2Ae x into the differential equation and sim-
plifying gives
 
yp  5yp  4yp  3Ae x  8e x.
From the last equality we see that the value of A is now determined as A  8
3. Therefore a 
particular solution of the given equation is yp  8
3 xe x.
The difference in the procedures used in Examples 1–3 and in Example 4 suggests that we 
consider two cases. The first case reflects the situation in Examples 1–3.
 
Case I :  No function in the assumed particular solution is a solution of the associated 
homogeneous differential equation.
In Table 3.4.1 we illustrate some specific examples of g(x) in (1) along with the correspond-
ing form of the particular solution. We are, of course, taking for granted that no function in 
the assumed particular solution yp is duplicated by a function in the complementary
function yc.
EXAMPLE 5 
Forms of Particular Solutions—Case I
Determine the form of a particular solution of
(a)  y  8y  25y  5x3ex  7ex   (b)  y  4y  x cos x.
SOLUTION (a)  We can write g(x)  (5x3  7)ex. Using entry 9 in Table 3.4.1 as a model, 
we assume a particular solution of the form
 
yp  (Ax3  Bx2  Cx  E)ex.
Note that there is no duplication between any of the terms in yp and the terms in the complemen-
tary function yc  e4x(c1 cos 3x  c2 sin 3x).
(b)  The function g(x)  x cos x is similar to entry 11 in Table 3.4.1 except, of course, that we 
use a linear rather than a quadratic polynomial and cos x and sin x instead of cos 4x and 
sin 4x in the form of yp:
 
yp  (Ax  B) cos x  (Cx  E) sin x.
Again observe that there is no duplication of terms between yp and yc  c1 cos 2x  c2 sin 2x.

TABLE 3.4.1 Trial Particular Solutions

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
If g(x) consists of a sum of, say, m terms of the kind listed in the table, then (as in Example 3) 
the assumption for a particular solution yp consists of the sum of the trial forms yp1, yp2, p  ,  ypm
corresponding to these terms:
yp  yp1  yp2  p  ypm.
The foregoing sentence can be put another way.
Form Rule for Case I : The form of yp is a linear combination of all linearly independent 
functions that are generated by repeated differentiations of g(x).
EXAMPLE 6 
Finding yp by Superposition—Case I
Determine the form of a particular solution of
 
y  9y  14y  3x 2  5 sin 2x  8xe6x.
SOLUTION The right-hand side of the equation g(x)  3x2  5 sin 2x  8xe6x consists of 
three different types of functions x2, sin 2x, and xe6x. The derivatives of these functions yield, 
in turn, the additional functions x, 1; cos 2x; and e6x. Therefore:
corresponding to x2 we assume 
yp1  Ax2  Bx  C,
corresponding to sin 2x we assume 
yp2  E cos 2x  F sin 2x,
corresponding to xe6x we assume 
yp3  Gxe6x  He6x.
The assumption for a particular solution of the given nonhomogeneous differential equation 
is then
 
yp  yp1  yp2  yp3  Ax2  Bx  C  E cos 2x  F sin 2x  (Gx  H)e6x.
Note that none of the seven terms in this assumption for yp duplicates a term in the comple-
mentary function yc  c1e2x  c2e7x.
 
Case II :  A function in the assumed particular solution is also a solution of the  associated 
homogeneous differential equation.
The next example is similar to Example 4.
EXAMPLE 7 
Particular Solution—Case II
Find a particular solution of y  2y  y  ex.
SOLUTION The complementary function is yc  c1e x  c2xe x. As in Example 4, the as-
sumption yp  Ae x will fail since it is apparent from yc that e x is a solution of the associated 
homogeneous equation y  2y  y  0. Moreover, we will not be able to find a particular 
solution of the form yp  Axe x since the term xe x is also duplicated in yc. We next try
 
yp  Ax2ex.
Substituting into the given differential equation yields 2Ae x  e x and so A  1
2. Thus a par-
ticular solution is yp  1
2x2e x.
Suppose again that g(x) consists of m terms of the kind given in Table 3.4.1, and suppose 
further that the usual assumption for a particular solution is
 
yp  yp1  yp2  p  ypm,
where the ypi, i  1, 2, . . ., m are the trial particular solution forms corresponding to these terms. 
Under the circumstances described in Case II, we can make up the following general rule.
Multiplication Rule for Case II : If any ypi contains terms that duplicate terms in yc  , 
then that ypi must be multiplied by x n, where n is the smallest positive integer that eliminates 
that duplication.

EXAMPLE 8 
An Initial-Value Problem
Solve the initial-value problem y  y  4x  10 sin x, y(p)  0, y(p)  2.
SOLUTION The solution of the associated homogeneous equation y  y  0 is yc  c1 cos x  
c2 sin x. Since g(x)  4x  10 sin x is the sum of a linear polynomial and a sine function, our 
normal assumption for yp, from entries 2 and 5 of Table 3.4.1, would be the sum of yp1  Ax  B 
and yp2  C cos x  E sin x:
 
yp  Ax  B  C cos x  E sin x. 
(5)
But there is an obvious duplication of the terms cos x and sin x in this assumed form and two 
terms in the complementary function. This duplication can be eliminated by simply multiply-
ing yp2 by x. Instead of (5) we now use
 
yp  Ax  B  Cx cos x  Ex sin x.
Differentiating this expression and substituting the results into the differential equation gives
 
yp  yp  Ax  B  2C sin x  2E cos x  4x  10 sin x. 
(6)
and so A  4, B  0, 2C  10, 2E  0. The solutions of the system are immediate: A  4, 
B  0, C  5, and E  0. Therefore from (6) we obtain yp  4x  5x cos x. The general 
solution of the given equation is
 
y  yc  yp  c1 cos x  c2 sin x  4x  5x cos x.
We now apply the prescribed initial conditions to the general solution of the equation. First, 
y(p)  c1 cos p  c2 sin p  4p  5p cos p  0 yields c1  9p since cos p  1 and 
sin p  0. Next, from the derivative
 
  y  9p sin x  c2 cos x  4  5x sin x  5 cos x
and 
y(p)  9p sin p  c2 cos p  4  5p sin p  5 cos p  2
we find c2  7. The solution of the initial value is then
y  9p cos x  7 sin x  4x  5x cos x.
EXAMPLE 9 
Using the Multiplication Rule
Solve y  6y  9y  6x2  2  12e3x.
SOLUTION The complementary function is yc  c1e3x  c2xe3x. And so, based on entries 
3 and 7 of Table 3.4.1, the usual assumption for a particular solution would be
 
yp  Ax2  Bx  C  Ee3x.
 
 
 
yp1    yp2
Inspection of these functions shows that the one term in yp2 is duplicated in yc. If we multiply 
yp2 by x, we note that the term xe3x is still part of yc. But multiplying yp2 by x2 eliminates all 
duplications. Thus the operative form of a particular solution is
 
yp  Ax2  Bx  C  Ex2e3x.
Differentiating this last form, substituting into the differential equation, and collecting like 
terms gives
 
yp  6yp  9yp  9Ax 2  (12A  9B)x  2A  6B  9C  2Ee3x  6x 2  2  12e3x.

Third-Order DE—Case I
Solve y  y  ex cos x.
SOLUTION From the characteristic equation m3  m2  0 we find m1  m2  0 and m3  1. 
Hence the complementary function of the equation is yc  c1  c2x  c3ex. With g(x) 
excos x, we see from entry 10 of Table 3.4.1 that we should assume
 
yp  Aex cos x  Bex sin x.
Since there are no functions in yp that duplicate functions in the complementary solution, we 
proceed in the usual manner. From
 
yp  yp  (2A  4B)ex cos x  (4A  2B)ex sin x  ex cos x
we get 2A  4B  1,  4A  2B  0. This system gives A   1
10 and B  1
5, so that a 
particular solution is yp   1

5 ex sin x. The general solution of the equation is
 
y  yc  yp  c1  c2x  c3ex  1
10 ex cos x + 1
5 ex sin x.
EXAMPLE 11 
Fourth-Order DE—Case II
Determine the form of a particular solution of y(4)  y  1  x2ex.
SOLUTION Comparing yc  c1  c2x  c3x2  c4ex with our normal assumption for a 
particular solution
 
yp  A  Bx2ex  Cxex  Eex,
 
 
 
yp1 
yp2
we see that the duplications between yc and yp are eliminated when yp1 is multiplied by x3 and 
yp2 is multiplied by x. Thus the correct assumption for a particular solution is 
 
     yp  Ax3  Bx3ex  Cx2ex  Exex.
REMARKS
(i) In Problems 27–36 of Exercises 3.4, you are asked to solve initial-value problems, and in 
Problems 37–40, boundary-value problems. As illustrated in Example 8, be sure to apply the 
initial conditions or the boundary conditions to the general solution y  yc  yp. Students 
often make the mistake of applying these conditions only to the complementary function yc
since it is that part of the solution that contains the constants.
(ii) From the “Form Rule for Case I” on page 132 of this section you see why the method of 
undetermined coefficients is not well suited to nonhomogeneous linear DEs when the input

3.5 Variation of Parameters
INTRODUCTION The method of variation of parameters used in Section 2.3 to find a 
particular solution of a linear first-order differential equation is applicable to linear higher-order 
equations as well. Variation of parameters has a distinct advantage over the method of the pre-
ceding section in that it always yields a particular solution yp provided the associated homoge-
neous equation can be solved. In addition, the method presented in this section, unlike 
undetermined coefficients, is not limited to cases where the input function is a combination of 
the four types of functions listed on page 128, nor is it limited to differential equations with 
constant coefficients.
 Some Assumptions To adapt the method of variation of parameters to a linear second-
order differential equation
 
a2(x)y  a1(x)y  a0(x)y  g(x), 
(1)

 
3.5 Variation of Parameters 
| 137
we begin as we did in Section 3.2—we put (1) in the standard form
 
y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  f (x) 
(2)
by dividing through by the lead coefficient a2(x). Equation (2) is the second-order analogue of 
the linear first-order equation dy/dx  P(x)y  f (x). In (2) we shall assume P(x), Q(x), and f (x) 
are continuous on some common interval I. As we have already seen in Section 3.3, there is no 
difficulty in obtaining the complementary function yc of (2) when the coefficients are constants.
 Method of Variation of Parameters Corresponding to the substitution 
yp  u1(x)y1(x) that we used in Section 2.3 to find a particular solution yp of dy/dx  P(x)y  f (x), 
for the linear second-order DE (2) we seek a solution of the form
 
yp(x)  u1(x)y1(x)  u2(x)y2(x), 
(3)
where y1 and y2 form a fundamental set of solutions on I of the associated homogeneous form 
of (1). Using the product rule to differentiate yp twice, we get
 
yp  u1y1  y1u1  u2 y2  y2u2
 
yp  u1y1  y1u1  y1u1  u1y1  u2 y2  y2u2  y2u2  u2 y2.
Substituting (3) and the foregoing derivatives into (2) and grouping terms yields

yp  P(x)yp  Q(x)yp  u1[y1  Py1  Qy1]  u2[ y2  Py2  Qy2]
 
        y1u1  u1 y1  y2u2  u2 y2  P[ y1u1  y2u2]  y1u1  y2u2

 d
dx [ y1u1  y2u2]  P[ y1u1  y2u2]  y1u1  y2u2  f (x). 
(4)
Because we seek to determine two unknown functions u1 and u2, reason dictates that we need 
two equations. We can obtain these equations by making the further assumption that the functions 
u1 and u2 satisfy y1u1  y2u2  0. This assumption does not come out of the blue but is prompted 
by the first two terms in (4), since, if we demand that y1u1  y2u2  0, then (4) reduces 
to y1u1  y2u2  f (x). We now have our desired two equations, albeit two equations for determin-
ing the derivatives u1 and u2. By Cramer’s rule, the solution of the system
 
y1u1  y2u2  0 
 
y1u1  y2u2  f (x)
can be expressed in terms of determinants:
 
u19  W1
W   y2  f ( x)
W  and u29  W2
W  y1  f ( x)
W
 
(5)
where 
W  2  y1
y2
y19
y29
 2 , W1  2 0
y2
 f (x)
y29 2 , W2  2  y1
0
y19
f (x)
 2 . 
(6)
The functions u1 and u2 are found by integrating the results in (5). The determinant W is recog-
nized as the Wronskian of y1 and y2. By linear independence of y1 and y2 on I, we know that 
W( y1(x), y2(x))  0 for every x in the interval.
 Summary of the Method Usually it is not a good idea to memorize formulas in lieu 
of understanding a procedure. However, the foregoing procedure is too long and complicated to 
use each time we wish to solve a differential equation. In this case it is more efficient simply to 
use the formulas in (5). Thus to solve a2 y  a1y  a0y  g(x), first find the complementary 
function yc  c1y1  c2 y2 and then compute the Wronskian W( y1(x), y2(x)). By dividing by a2, 
we put the equation into the standard form y  Py  Qy  f (x) to determine f (x). We find u1 
and u2 by integrating u1 W1/W and u2  W2/W, where W1 and W2 are defined as in (6). A par-
ticular solution is yp  u1y1  u2 y2. The general solution of equation (1) is then y  yc  yp.
If you are unfamiliar with 
Cramer’s rule, see Section 8.7.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
EXAMPLE 1 
General Solution Using Variation of Parameters
Solve y  4y  4y  (x  1)e2x.
SOLUTION From auxiliary equation m2  4m  4  (m  2)2  0 we have yc  c1e2x  c2xe2x. 
With the identifications y1  e2x and y2  xe2x, we next compute the Wronskian:
 
W(e2x, xe2x)  2 e2x
xe2x
2e2x
2xe2x  e2x2  e4x.
Since the given differential equation is already in form (2) (that is, the coefficient of y is 1), 
we identify f (x)  (x  1)e2x. From (6) we obtain
 W1  2

(x  1)e2x
2xe2x  e2x2  (x  1)xe4x, W2  2 e2x

(x  1)e2x2  (x  1)e4x,
and so from (5)

Integrating the foregoing derivatives gives
u1  1

EXAMPLE 2 
General Solution Using Variation of Parameters
Solve 4y  36y  csc 3x.
SOLUTION We first put the equation in the standard form (2) by dividing by 4:
 
y  9y  1
4 csc 3x.
Since the roots of the auxiliary equation m2  9  0 are m1  3i and m2  3i, the comple-
mentary function is yc  c1 cos 3x  c2 sin 3x. Using y1  cos 3x, y2  sin 3x, and f (x)  
1
4 csc 3x, we obtain
 
W(cos 3x, sin 3x)  2

Thus from (3) a particular solution is
 
yp   1

The general solution of the equation is
 
y  yc  yp  c1 cos 3x  c2 sin 3x  1
12 x cos 3x  1
36 (sin 3x) ln |  sin 3x  |. 
(7)
Equation (7) represents the general solution of the differential equation on, say, the interval 
(0, p/3).
 Constants of Integration When computing the indefinite integrals of u1 and u2, we 
need not introduce any constants. This is because
 
y  yc  yp  c1y1  c2 y2  (u1  a1)y1  (u2  b1)y2
 
 (c1  a1)y1  (c2  b1)y2  u1 y1  u2 y2
 
 C1 y1  C2 y2  u1 y1  u2 y2.
 Integral-Defined Functions We have seen several times in the preceding sections 
and chapters that when a solution method involves integration we may encounter nonelementary 
integrals. As the next example shows, sometimes the best we can do in constructing a particular 
solution (3) of a linear second-order differential equation is to use the integral-defined functions.

Here we assume that the integrand is continuous on the interval [x0, x]. See Problems 23–26 in 
Exercises 3.5.
EXAMPLE 3 
General Solution Using Variation of Parameters
Solve y  y  1>x.
SOLUTION The auxiliary equation m2  1  0 yields m1  1 and m2  1. Therefore

In Example 3 we can integrate on any interval [x0, x] not containing the origin. Also see 
Examples 2 and 3 in Section 3.10.
 Higher-Order Equations The method we have just examined for nonhomogeneous 
second-order differential equations can be generalized to linear nth-order equations that have 
been put into the standard form
 
y(n)  Pn1(x)y(n1)   . . .  P1(x)y  P0(x)y  f (x). 
(8)
If yc  c1y1  c2 y2   . . .  cn yn is the complementary function for (8), then a particular solution is
 
yp(x)  u1(x)y1(x)  u2(x)y2(x)   . . .  un(x)yn(x),
where the uk, k  1, 2, . . ., n, are determined by the n equations

REMARKS
In the problems that follow do not hesitate to simplify the form of yp. Depending on how 
the antiderivatives of u1 and u2 are found, you may not obtain the same yp as given in the 
answer section. For example, in Problem 3 in Exercises 3.5, both yp  1

Cauchy–Euler Equations
INTRODUCTION The relative ease with which we were able to find explicit solutions of 
linear higher-order differential equations with constant coefficients in the preceding sections 
does not, in general, carry over to linear equations with variable coefficients. We shall see in 
Chapter 5 that when a linear differential equation has variable coefficients, the best that we can 
usually expect is to find a solution in the form of an infinite series. However, the type of dif-
ferential equation considered in this section is an exception to this rule; it is an equation with 
variable coefficients whose general solution can always be expressed in terms of powers of x, 
sines, cosines, logarithmic, and exponential functions. Moreover, its method of solution is quite 
similar to that for constant equations.
 Cauchy–Euler Equation Any linear differential equation of the form
 
anxn d
 ny
dx
 n  an21xn21 d
 n21y
dx
 n21  p  a1x dy
dx  a0y  g(x),
where the coefficients an, an1, . . ., a0 are constants, is known diversely as a Cauchy–Euler 
equation, an Euler–Cauchy equation, an Euler equation, or an equidimensional equation. 
The differential equation is named in honor of two of the most prolific mathematicians of all 
time, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (French, 1789–1857) and Leonhard Euler (Swiss, 1707–1783). 
The observable characteristic of this type of equation is that the degree k  n, n  1, . . ., 1, 0 of 
the monomial coefficients xk matches the order k of differentiation d ky/dx k:

As in Section 3.3, we start the discussion with a detailed examination of the forms of the 
general solutions of the homogeneous second-order equation
 
ax2 d 2y
dx2  bx dy
dx  cy  0. 
(1)
The solution of higher-order equations follows analogously. Also, we can solve the nonhomo-
geneous equation ax2y  bxy  cy  g(x) by variation of parameters, once we have determined 
the complementary function yc(x) of (1).
The coefficient of d 2y/dx2 is zero at x  0. Hence, in order to guarantee that the fundamental 
results of Theorem 3.1.1 are applicable to the Cauchy–Euler equation, we confine our attention 
to finding the general solution on the interval (0, q). Solutions on the interval (q, 0) can be 
obtained by substituting t  x into the differential equation. See Problems 49 and 50 in 
Exercises 3.6.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
 Method of Solution We try a solution of the form y  x m, where m is to be determined. 
Analogous to what happened when we substituted emx into a linear equation with constant coeffi-
cients, after substituting x m each term of a Cauchy–Euler equation becomes a polynomial in m times 
xm since
 
akx k d
 ky
dx
 k  akx km(m  1)(m  2) p (m  k  1) x mk
 
 akm(m  1)(m  2) p (m  k  1) x m.
For example, by substituting y  xm the second-order equation (1) becomes
 
ax2 d 2y
dx2  bx dy
dx  cy  am(m  1)xm  bmxm  cxm  (am(m  1)  bm  c)xm  0.
Thus y  xm is a solution of the differential equation whenever m is a solution of the auxiliary 
equation
 
am(m  1)  bm  c  0  or  am2  (b  a)m  c  0. 
(2)
There are three different cases to be considered, depending on whether the roots of this quadratic 
equation are real and distinct, real and equal, or complex. In the last case the roots appear as a 
conjugate pair.
 
Case I :  Distinct Real Roots Let m1 and m2 denote the real roots of (2) such that 
m1  m2. Then y1  xm1 and y2  xm2 form a fundamental set of solutions. Hence 
the general solution of (1) is
 
         y  c1x m1  c2x m2. 
(3)
EXAMPLE 1 
Distinct Roots
Solve

dx 2 4y  0.
SOLUTION Rather than just memorizing equation (2), it is preferable to assume y  xm 
as the solution a few times in order to understand the origin and the difference between 
this new form of the auxiliary equation and that obtained in Section 3.3. Differentiate 
twice,
 
dy
dx  mxm21, d
 2y
dx
 2  m(m 2 1)xm22,
and substitute back into the differential equation:
 
x2 d 2y
dx 2  2x dy
dx  4y  x2 	 m(m  1)x m2  2x 	 mx m1  4xm
 
 x m(m(m  1)  2m  4)  x m(m2  3m  4)  0
if m2  3m  4  0. Now (m  1)(m  4)  0 implies m1  1, m2  4 and so (3) yields 
the general solution y  c1x1  c2x4.
 
Case II :  Repeated Real Roots If the roots of (2) are repeated (that is, m1  m2), then 
we obtain only one solution, namely, y  x m1. When the roots of the quadratic 
equation am2  (b  a)m  c  0 are equal, the discriminant of the coeffi-
cients is necessarily zero. It follows from the quadratic formula that the root 
must be m1  (b  a)/2a.
 
  Now we can construct a second solution y2, using (5) of Section 3.2. We 
first write the Cauchy–Euler equation in the standard form
 
         
d 2y
dx2  b
ax
  dy
dx 

  y  0

and make the identifications P(x)  b/ax and (b/ax) dx  (b/a) ln x. Thus
 
 y2  xm1 #

The general solution of (1) is then
 
y  c1xm1  c2xm1 ln x. 
(4)
EXAMPLE 2 
Repeated Roots 
Solve 
4x2 d 2y
dx2  8x dy
dx  y  0.
SOLUTION The substitution y  xm yields
 
4x2 d 2y
dx2  8x dy
dx  y  xm(4m(m  1)  8m  1)  xm(4m2  4m  1)  0
when 4m2  4m  1  0 or (2m  1)2  0. Since m1   1
2 is a repeated root, (4) gives the 
general solution y  c1x1/2  c2x1/2 ln x.
For higher-order equations, if m1 is a root of multiplicity k, then it can be shown that
 
xm1,  xm1 ln x,  xm1(ln x)2,  . . .,  xm1(ln x)k1
are k linearly independent solutions. Correspondingly, the general solution of the differential 
equation must then contain a linear combination of these k solutions.
 
Case III :  Conjugate Complex Roots If the roots of (2) are the conjugate pair 
m1  a  ib, m2  a  ib, where a and b 
 0 are real, then a  solution 
is y  C1xaib  C2xaib. But when the roots of the auxiliary equation are 
complex, as in the case of equations with constant  coefficients, we wish 
to write the solution in terms of real functions only. We note the identity
 
xib  (eln x ) ib  eib ln x,
 
which, by Euler’s formula, is the same as
 
 xib  cos(b ln x)  i sin(b ln x).
 
Similarly, 
xib  cos(b ln x)  i sin(b ln x).
 
Adding and subtracting the last two results yields
 
xib  xib  2 cos(b ln x)  and  xib  xib  2i sin( b ln x),
 
 respectively. From the fact that y  C1xaib  C2xaib is a solution for 
any values of the constants, we see, in turn, for C1  C2  1 and C1  1, 
C2  1 that
 
y1  xa(xib  xib)  and  y2  xa(xib  xib)
 
or 
y1  2xa cos( b ln x)  and  y2  2ixa sin( b ln x)
 
 are also solutions. Since W(xa cos( b ln x), xa sin( b ln x))  bx2a1  0, 
b 
 0, on the interval (0, q), we conclude that
 
y1  xa cos( b ln x)  and  y2  xa sin( b ln x)
 
 constitute a fundamental set of real solutions of the differential equation.

An Initial-Value Problem
Solve the initial-value problem 4x2y  17y  0, y(1)  1, y(1)  1
2.
SOLUTION The y term is missing in the given Cauchy–Euler equation; nevertheless, the 
substitution y  xm yields
 
4x2y  17y  xm(4m(m  1)  17)  xm(4m2  4m  17)  0
when 4m2  4m  17  0. From the quadratic formula we find that the roots are m1  1
2  2i
and m2  1
2  2i. With the identifications a  1
2 and b  2, we see from (5) that the general 
solution of the differential equation on the interval (0, q) is
 
y  x1/2 [c1 cos(2 ln x)  c2 sin(2 ln x)].
By applying the initial conditions y(1)  1, y(1)  0 to the foregoing solution and using 
ln 1  0 we then find, in turn, that c1  1 and c2  0. Hence the solution of the initial-
value problem is y  x1/2cos (2 ln x). The graph of this function, obtained with the aid of 
computer software, is given in FIGURE 3.6.1 The particular solution is seen to be oscillatory and 
unbounded as x S q.
 
The next example illustrates the solution of a third-order Cauchy–Euler equation.

so that the given differential equation becomes

   xm(m3  2m2  4m  8)  xm(m  2)(m2  4)  0.
In this case we see that y  xm will be a solution of the differential equation for m1  2, 
m2  2i, and m3  2i. Hence the general solution on the interval (0, q) is
 y  c1x2  c2 cos(2 ln x)  c3 sin(2 ln x).
 Nonhomogeneous Equations The method of undetermined coefficients as described 
in Section 3.4 does not carry over, in general, to linear differential equations with variable coef-
ficients. Consequently, in the following example the method of variation of parameters is employed.
EXAMPLE 5 
Variation of Parameters
Solve x2y  3xy  3y  2x4e x.
SOLUTION Since the equation is nonhomogeneous, we first solve the associated homogeneous 
equation. From the auxiliary equation (m  1)(m  3)  0 we find yc  c1x  c2x3. Now

on page 137, and were derived under the assumption that the differential equation has been 
put into the standard form y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  f (x). Therefore we divide the given equation 
by x2, and from

The integral of the latter function is immediate, but in the case of u1 we integrate by parts 
twice. The results are u1  x2e x  2xe x  2e x and u2  e x. Hence
 
yp  u1y1  u2y2  (x 2e x  2xe x  2e x)x  e xx3  2x2e x  2xex.
Finally the general solution of the given equation is
 
y  yc  yp  c1x  c2x3  2x2ex  2xex.
 A Generalization The second-order differential equation

dx  cy  0 
(6)
is a generalization of equation (1). Note that (6) reduces to (1) when x0  0. We can solve 
Cauchy–Euler equations of the form given in (6) exactly as we did in (1), namely, by seeking 
solutions y  (x  x0)m and using
 
dy
dx  m(x 2 x0)m21  and  d 2y
dx2  m(m 2 1)(x 2 x0)m22.
See Problems 39–42 in Exercises 3.6.
REMARKS
The similarity between the forms of solutions of Cauchy–Euler equations and solutions of 
linear equations with constant coefficients is not just a coincidence. For example, when the 
roots of the auxiliary equations for ay  by  cy  0 and ax2y  bxy  cy  0 are distinct 
and real, the respective general solutions are
 
y  c1em1x  c2em2x and y  c1xm1  c2xm2, x . 0. 
(7)
In view of the identity eln x  x, x 
 0, the second solution given in (7) can be expressed in 
the same form as the first solution:
 
y  c1em1ln x  c2em2ln x  c1em1t  c2em2t,
where t  ln x. This last result illustrates another fact of mathematical life: Any Cauchy–
Euler equation can always be rewritten as a linear differential equation with constant coef-
ficients by means of the substitution x  et. The idea is to solve the new differential 
equation in terms of the variable t, using the methods of the previous sections, and once 
the general solution is obtained, resubstitute t  ln x. Since this procedure provides a good 
review of the Chain Rule of differentiation, you are urged to work Problems 43–48 in 
Exercises 3.6.

formed by two concentric circular cylinders of different

concentric cylinders as shown in green in FIGURE 3.6.2. The 
inner cylinder has a radius of 1 and is thermally insulated, 
while the outer cylinder has a radius of 2 and is maintained 
at a constant temperature T0. The rate of heat generation in 
the fluid due to the chemical reactions is proportional to T>r2, 
where T(r) is the temperature of the fluid within the space

Nonlinear Equations
INTRODUCTION The difficulties that surround higher-order nonlinear DEs and the few 
methods that yield analytic solutions are examined next.
 Some Differences There are several significant differences between linear and nonlin-
ear differential equations. We saw in Section 3.1 that homogeneous linear equations of order two 
or higher have the property that a linear combination of solutions is also a solution (Theorem 
3.1.2). Nonlinear equations do not possess this property of superposability. For example, on the 
interval (q, q), y1  ex, y2  ex, y3  cos x, and y4  sin x are four linearly independent 
solutions of the nonlinear second-order differential equation ( y)2  y2  0. But linear combina-
tions such as y  c1ex  c3 cos x, y  c2ex  c4 sin x, y  c1ex  c2ex  c3 cos x  c4 sin x are 
not solutions of the equation for arbitrary nonzero constants ci. See Problem 1 in Exercises 3.7.
In Chapter 2 we saw that we could solve a few nonlinear first-order differential equations by 
recognizing them as separable, exact, homogeneous, or perhaps Bernoulli equations. Even though 
the solutions of these equations were in the form of a one-parameter family, this family did not, 
as a rule, represent the general solution of the differential equation. On the other hand, by paying 
attention to certain continuity conditions, we obtained general solutions of linear first-order 
equations. Stated  another way, nonlinear first-order differential equations can possess singular 
solutions whereas linear equations cannot. But the major difference between linear and nonlinear 
equations of order two or higher lies in the realm of solvability. Given a linear equation there is 
a chance that we can find some form of a solution that we can look at, an explicit solution or 
perhaps a solution in the form of an infinite series. On the other hand, nonlinear higher-order

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
differential equations virtually defy solution. This does not mean that a nonlinear higher-order 
differential equation has no solution but rather that there are no analytical methods whereby 
either an explicit or implicit solution can be found.
Although this sounds disheartening, there are still things that can be done; we can always 
analyze a nonlinear DE qualitatively and numerically.
Let us make it clear at the outset that nonlinear higher-order differential equations are 
important—dare we say even more important than linear equations?—because as we fine-tune 
the mathematical model of, say, a physical system, we also increase the likelihood that this 
higher-resolution model will be nonlinear.
We begin by illustrating an analytical method that occasionally enables us to find explicit/
implicit solutions of special kinds of nonlinear second-order differential equations.
 Reduction of Order Nonlinear second-order differential equations F (x, y, y)  0, 
where the dependent variable y is missing, and F ( y, y, y)  0, where the independent variable 
x is missing, can sometimes be solved using first-order methods. Each equation can be reduced 
to a first-order equation by means of the substitution u  y.
The next example illustrates the substitution technique for an equation of the form F (x, y, y)  0. 
If u  y, then the differential equation becomes F (x, u, u)  0. If we can solve this last equation 
for u, we can find y by integration. Note that since we are solving a second-order equation, its 
solution will contain two arbitrary constants.
EXAMPLE 1 
Dependent Variable y Is Missing
Solve y  2x(y)2.
SOLUTION If we let u  y, then du/dx  y. After substituting, the second-order equation 
reduces to a first-order equation with separable variables; the independent variable is x and 
the dependent variable is u:
 
du
dx  2xu2 or du
u2  2x dx
 
 #u2du  #2x dx
 
u1  x2  c2
1.
The constant of integration is written as c1
2 for convenience. The reason should be obvious in 
the next few steps. Since u1  1/y, it follows that
 
            dy
dx   
1
x2  c2
1
and so 
y  #
dx
x2  c2
1 or y   1
c1
 tan1 x
c1
 c2.
Next we show how to solve an equation that has the form F ( y, y, y)  0. Once more we let 
u  y, but since the independent variable x is missing, we use this substitution to transform the 
differential equation into one in which the independent variable is y and the dependent variable 
is u. To this end we use the Chain Rule to compute the second derivative of y:
y0  du
dx  du
dy dy
dx  u du
dy.
In this case the first-order equation that we must now solve is F ( y, u, u du/dy)  0.
EXAMPLE 2 
Independent Variable x Is Missing
Solve yy  ( y)2.
SOLUTION With the aid of u  y, the Chain Rule shown above, and separation of variables, 
the given differential equation becomes
y au du
dyb  u2  or  du
u  dy
y .

3.7 Nonlinear Equations

149
Integrating the last equation then yields ln |u|  ln |y|  c1, which, in turn, gives u  c2y, 
where the constant ec1 has been relabeled as c2. We now resubstitute u  dy/dx, separate 
variables once again, integrate, and relabel constants a second time:
 
#
dy
y  c2#dx  or  ln |y|  c2x  c3  or  y  c4ec2 x.
 Use of Taylor Series In some instances a solution of a nonlinear initial-value prob-
lem, in which the initial conditions are specified at x0, can be approximated by a Taylor series 
centered at x0.
EXAMPLE 3 
Taylor Series Solution of an IVP
Let us assume that a solution of the initial-value problem
 
y  x  y  y2,  y(0)  1,  y(0)  1 
(1)
exists. If we further assume that the solution y(x) of the problem is analytic at 0, then y(x) 
possesses a Taylor series expansion centered at 0:

Note that the value of the first and second terms in the series (2) are known since those values 
are the specified initial conditions y(0)  1, y(0)  1. Moreover, the differential equation 
itself defines the value of the second derivative at 0: y(0)  0  y(0)  y(0)2  0  (1) 
(1)2  2. We can then find expressions for the higher derivatives y, y(4), . . ., by calculating 
the successive derivatives of the differential equation:

(5)
and so on. Now using y(0)  1 and y(0)  1 we find from (3) that y(0)  4. From the 
values y(0)  1, y(0)  1, and y(0)  2, we find y(4)(0)  8 from (4). With the additional 
information that y(0)  4, we then see from (5) that y(5)(0)  24. Hence from (2), the first 
six terms of a series solution of the initial-value problem (1) are
 
y(x)  1  x 2 x2  2

5 x5  p.
 Use of a Numerical Solver Numerical methods, such as Euler’s method or a Runge–
Kutta method, are developed solely for first-order differential equations and then are extended 
to systems of first-order equations. In order to analyze an nth-order initial-value problem 
numerically, we express the nth-order ODE as a system of n first-order equations. In brief, 
here is how it is done for a second-order initial-value problem: First, solve for y; that is, 
put the DE into normal form y  f (x, y, y), and then let y  u. For example, if we substitute 
y  u in
 
d
 2y
dx2  f (x, y, y),  y(x0)  y0, y(x0)  u0, 
(6)
then y  u and y(x0)  u(x0) so that the initial-value problem (6) becomes
 
Solve:

Subject to: y(x0)  y0 , u(x0)  u0.

However, it should be noted that a commercial numerical solver may not require* that you supply

equivalent to

with initial conditions y(0)  1, u(0)  1. With the aid of a numerical solver we get the 
solution curve shown in blue in FIGURE 3.7.1. For comparison, the curve shown in red is the 
graph of the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial T5(x)  1  x  x2  2
3x3 2 1

5x5. Although 
we do not know the interval of convergence of the Taylor series obtained in Example 3, the 
closeness of the two curves in the neighborhood of the origin suggests that the power series 
may converge on the interval (1, 1).
 Qualitative Questions The blue graph in Figure 3.7.1 raises some questions of a qual-
itative nature: Is the solution of the original initial-value problem oscillatory as x S q? The graph 
generated by a numerical solver on the larger interval shown in FIGURE 3.7.2 would seem to suggest
that the answer is yes. But this single example, or even an assortment of examples, does not 
answer the basic question of whether all solutions of the differential equation y  x  y  y2 
are oscillatory in nature. Also, what is happening to the solution curves in Figure 3.7.2 when x
is near 1? What is the behavior of solutions of the differential equation as x S q? Are solu-
tions bounded as x S q? Questions such as these are not easily answered, in general, for non-
linear second-order differential equations. But certain kinds of second-order equations lend 
themselves to a systematic qualitative analysis, and these, like their first-order relatives encoun-
tered in Section 2.1, are the kind that have no explicit dependence on the independent variable. 
Second-order ODEs of the form
 
F ( y, y, y)  0  or  d 2y
dx2  f ( y, y),
that is, equations free of the independent variable x, are called autonomous. The differential 
equation in Example 2 is autonomous, and because of the presence of the x term on its right side, 
the equation in Example 3 is nonautonomous. For an in-depth treatment of the topic of stability 
of autonomous second-order differential equations and autonomous systems of differential equa-
tions, the reader is referred to Chapter 11.
*Some numerical solvers require only that a second-order differential equation be expressed in normal 
form y  f (x, y, y). The translation of the single equation into a system of two equations is then built into 
the computer program, since the first equation of the system is always y  u and the second equation is 
u  f (x, y, u).

in which each mathematical model is a linear second-order differential equation with constant 
coefficients along with initial conditions specified at time t0:

| CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
The function g is variously called the input, driving, or forcing function of the system. The 
output or response of the system is a function y(t) defined on an I interval containing t0 that 
satisfies both the differential equation and the initial conditions on the interval I.
3.8.1 Spring/Mass Systems: Free Undamped Motion
 Hooke’s Law Suppose a flexible spring is suspended vertically from a rigid support and 
then a mass m is attached to its free end. The amount of stretch, or elongation, of the spring will, 
of course, depend on the mass; masses with different weights stretch the spring by differing 
amounts. By Hooke’s law, the spring itself exerts a restoring force F opposite to the direction of elonga-
tion and proportional to the amount of elongation s. Simply stated, F  ks, where k  0 is a constant 
of proportionality called the spring constant. The spring is essentially characterized by the number k. 
Using ZFZ  kZsZ, we see that if a mass weighing 10 lb stretches a spring 1
2 ft, then 10  k(1
2) implies 
k  20 lb/ft. Necessarily then, a mass weighing, say, 8 lb stretches the same spring only 2
5 ft.
 Newton’s Second Law After a mass m is attached to a spring, it stretches the spring by 
an amount s and attains a position of equilibrium at which its weight W is balanced by the restor-
ing force ks. Recall that weight is defined by W  mg, where mass is measured in slugs, kilograms, 
or grams and g  32 ft/s2, 9.8 m/s2, or 980 cm/s2, respectively. As indicated in FIGURE 3.8.1(b), the 
condition of equilibrium is mg  ks or mg  ks  0. If the mass is displaced by an amount x 
from its equilibrium position, the restoring force of the spring is then k(x  s). Assuming that 
there are no retarding forces acting on the system and assuming that the mass vibrates free of 
other external forces—free motion—we can equate Newton’s second law with the net, or resultant, 
force of the restoring force and the weight:
 
m d
 2x
dt
 2    k(s  x)  mg   kx  mg  ks   kx. 
(1)
 
 
zero
The negative sign in (1) indicates that the restoring force of the spring acts opposite to the direc-
tion of motion. Furthermore, we can adopt the convention that displacements measured below 
the equilibrium position are positive. See FIGURE 3.8.2.
 DE of Free Undamped Motion By dividing (1) by the mass m we obtain the second-
order differential equation d 2x/dt 2  (k/m)x  0 or
 
d 2x
dt2  v2x  0, 
(2)
where v2  k/m. Equation (2) is said to describe simple harmonic motion or free undamped 
motion. Two obvious initial conditions associated with (2) are x(0)  x0, the amount of initial 
displacement, and x(0)  x1, the initial velocity of the mass. For example, if x0  0, x1  0, the 
mass starts from a point below the equilibrium position with an imparted upward velocity. When 
x1  0 the mass is said to be released from rest. For example, if x0  0, x1  0, the mass is released 
from rest from a point Zx0Z units above the equilibrium position.
 Solution and Equation of Motion To solve equation (2) we note that the solutions 
of the auxiliary equation m2  v2  0 are the complex numbers m1  vi, m2  vi. Thus from 
(8) of Section 3.3 we find the general solution of (2) to be
 
x(t)  c1 cos vt  c2 sin vt. 
(3)
The period of free vibrations described by (3) is T  2p/v, and the frequency is f  1/T  
v/2p. For example, for x(t)  2 cos 3t  4 sin 3t the period is 2p/3 and the frequency is 3/2p. 
The former number means that the graph of x(t) repeats every 2p/3 units; the latter number 
means that there are three cycles of the graph every 2p units or, equivalently, that the mass 
undergoes 3/2p complete vibrations per unit time. In addition, it can be shown that the period 
2p/v is the time interval between two successive maxima of x(t). Keep in mind that a maxi-
mum of x(t) is a positive displacement corresponding to the mass’s attaining a maximum 
distance below the equilibrium position, whereas a minimum of x(t) is a negative displacement

corresponding to the mass’s attaining a maximum height above the equilibrium position. We 
refer to either case as an extreme displacement of the mass. Finally, when the initial condi-
tions are used to determine the constants c1 and c2 in (3), we say that the resulting particular 
solution or response is the equation of motion.
EXAMPLE 1 
Free Undamped Motion
A mass weighing 2 pounds stretches a spring 6 inches. At t  0 the mass is released from a 
point 8 inches below the equilibrium position with an upward velocity of 4
3 ft/s. Determine 
the equation of free motion.
SOLUTION Because we are using the engineering system of units, the measurements given 
in terms of inches must be converted into feet: 6 in  1
2 ft; 8 in  2
3 ft. In addition, we must 
convert the units of weight given in pounds into units of mass. From m  W/g we have 
m  2
32  1
16 slug. Also, from Hooke’s law, 2  k(1
2) implies that the spring constant is 
k  4 lb/ft. Hence (1) gives

The initial displacement and initial velocity are x(0)  2
3, x(0)   4
3, where the negative sign 
in the last condition is a consequence of the fact that the mass is given an initial  velocity in 
the negative, or upward, direction.
Now v2  64 or v  8, so that the general solution of the differential equation is
 
x(t)  c1 cos 8t  c2 sin 8t. 
(4)
Applying the initial conditions to x(t) and x(t) gives c1  2

6. Thus the equation 
of motion is
x(t)  2
3
 cos 8t 2 1

 sin 8t. 
(5)
 Alternative Form of x(t ) When c1  0 and c2  0, the actual amplitude A of free 
vibrations is not obvious from inspection of equation (3). For example, although the mass in 
Example 1 is initially displaced 2
3 foot beyond the equilibrium position, the amplitude of  vibrations 
is a number larger than 2
3. Hence it is often convenient to convert an equation of simple harmonic 
motion of the form given in (3) into the form of a shifted sine function (6) or a shifted cosine 
function (6). In both (6) and (6) the number A  "c2

  c2

and f is a phase angle. Note carefully that f is defined in a slightly different manner in (7)

Alternative Form of Solution (5)
In view of the foregoing discussion, we can write the solution (5) in the alternative forms (6) 
and 1692. In both cases the amplitude is A  "(2

care should be exercised when computing a phase angle f.
(a)  With c1  2
3 and c2  1
6 we find from (7) that tan f  4. A calculator then gives 
tan1(4)  1.326  rad. However, this is not the phase angle since tan1(4) is located in 
the fourth quadrant and therefore contradicts the fact that sin f . 0 and cos f , 0 because 
c1 . 0 and c2 , 0. Hence we must take f to be the second-quadrant angle 
f  p  (1.326)  1.816  rad. Thus, (6) gives
 
x(t)  "17

 sin (8t  1.816). 
(9)
The period of this function is T  2p/8  p/4.
(b)  Now with c1  2
3 and c2  1
6, we see that (7) indicates that sin f , 0  and cos f . 0
and so the angle f lies in the fourth quadrant. Hence from tan f  1
4 we can take 
f  tan1(1
4)  0.245  rad. A second alternative form of solution (5) is then
x(t)  "17

 Graphical Interpretation 
FIGURE 3.8.4(a) illustrates the mass in Example 2 going through 
approximately two complete cycles of motion. Reading left to right, the first five positions marked 
with black dots in the figure correspond, respectively, 
• to the initial position (x  2
3) of the mass below the equilibrium position, 
•  to the mass passing through the equilibrium position (x  0) for the first time heading 
upward, 
•  to the mass at its extreme displacement (x   "17
6 ) above the equilibrium position,
•  to the mass passing through the equilibrium position (x  0) for the second time heading 
downward, and
•  to the mass at its extreme displacement (x  "17
6 ) below the equilibrium position.
The dots on the graph of (9) given in Figure 3.8.4(b) also agree with the five positions just given.

Note, however, that in Figure 3.8.4(b) the positive direction in the tx-plane is the usual upward 
direction and so is opposite to the positive direction indicated in Figure 3.8.4(a). Hence the blue 
graph representing the motion of the mass in Figure 3.8.4(b) is the mirror image through the 
t-axis of the red dashed curve in Figure 3.8.4(a).
Form (6) is very useful, since it is easy to find values of time for which the graph of x(t) crosses 
the positive t-axis (the line x  0). We observe that sin(vt  f)  0 when vt  f  np, where 
n is a nonnegative integer.
 Double Spring Systems Suppose two parallel springs, with constants k1 and k2, are 
attached to a common rigid support and then to a metal plate of negligible mass. A single mass 
m is attached to the center of the plate in the double-spring arrangement as shown in FIGURE 3.8.5. 
If the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position, the displacement x is the same for both 
springs and so the net restoring force of the spring in (1) is simply k1x  k2x  (k1  k2)x. 
We say that
 
keff  k1  k2
is the effective spring constant of the system.
On the other hand, suppose two springs supporting a single mass m are in series, that is, the 
springs are attached end-to-end as shown in FIGURE 3.8.6. In this case, a displacement x of the 
mass from its equilibrium consists of the sum x  x1  x2, where x1 and x2 are the displacements 
of the respective springs. But the restoring force is the same for both springs so if keff is the 
effective spring constant of the system we have
 
keff(x1  x2)  k1x1  k2x2.
From k1x1  k2x2 we see x1  (k2k1)x2 and so keff (x1  x2)  k2x2 is the same as
 
keffak2
k1
x2  x2b  k2x2.
Solving the last equation for keff yields
 
keff 
k1k2
k1  k2
.
So in either of the above cases, the differential equation of motion is (1) with k replaced by keff. 
See Problems 13–18 in Exercises 3.8.
 Systems with Variable Spring Constants In the model discussed above, we assumed 
an ideal world, a world in which the physical characteristics of the spring do not change over time. 
In the nonideal world, however, it seems reasonable to expect that when a spring/mass system is in 
motion for a long period the spring would weaken; in other words, the “spring constant” would 
vary, or, more specifically, decay with time. In one model for the aging spring, the spring constant 
k in (1), is replaced by the decreasing function K(t)  keat, k 
 0, a 
 0. The linear differential 
equation mx  keatx  0 cannot be solved by the methods considered in this chapter. Nevertheless, 
we can obtain two linearly independent solutions using the methods in Chapter 5. See Problem 19 
in Exercises 3.8.
When a spring/mass system is subjected to an environment in which the temperature is rapidly 
decreasing, it might make sense to replace the constant k with K(t)  kt, k 
 0, a function that 
increases with time. The resulting model, mx  ktx  0, is a form of Airy’s differential equa-
tion. Like the equation for an aging spring, Airy’s equation can be solved by the methods of 
Chapter 5. See Problem 20 in Exercises 3.8.
3.8.2 Spring/Mass Systems: Free Damped Motion
The concept of free harmonic motion is somewhat unrealistic, since the motion described by 
equation (1) assumes that there are no retarding forces acting on the moving mass. Unless the 
mass is suspended in a perfect vacuum, there will be at least a resisting force due to the surround-
ing medium. As FIGURE 3.8.7 shows, the mass could be suspended in a viscous medium or  connected 
to a dashpot damping device.

| CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
 DE of Free Damped Motion In the study of mechanics, damping forces acting on a 
body are considered to be proportional to a power of the instantaneous velocity. In particular, we 
shall assume throughout the subsequent discussion that this force is given by a constant multiple 
of dx/dt. When no other external forces are impressed on the system, it follows from Newton’s 
second law that
 
m d

 2  kx 2 b dx

(10)
where b is a positive damping constant and the negative sign is a consequence of the fact that 
the damping force acts in a direction opposite to the motion.
Dividing (10) by the mass m, we find the differential equation of free damped motion is 
d 2x/dt2  (b/m) dx/dt  (k/m)x  0 or

 2  2l dx

(11)
where 
2l  b

(12)
The symbol 2l is used only for algebraic convenience, since the auxiliary equation is m2  2lm  
v2  0 and the corresponding roots are then
 
m1  l  "l2 2 v2, m2  l 2 "l2 2 v2.
We can now distinguish three possible cases depending on the algebraic sign of l2  v2. Since 
each solution contains the damping factor elt, l 
 0, the displacements of the mass become 
negligible over a long period of time.
 
Case I :    l2  v2 +  0 In this situation the system is said to be overdamped because 
the damping coefficient b is large when compared to the spring constant k. 
The corresponding solution of (11) is x(t)  c1em1t  c2em2t or
 
x(t)  elt(c1e"l22v2t  c2e"l22v2t
 ). 
(13)
Equation 13 represents a smooth and nonoscillatory motion. FIGURE 3.8.8 shows two possible 
graphs of x(t).
 
Case II :    l2  v2  0 The system is said to be critically damped because any slight 
decrease in the damping force would result in oscillatory motion. The general 
solution of (11) is x(t)  c1em1t  c2tem1t or
 
x(t)  elt(c1  c2t). 
(14)
Some graphs of typical motion are given in FIGURE 3.8.9. Notice that the motion is quite similar 
to that of an overdamped system. It is also apparent from (14) that the mass can pass through the 
equilibrium position at most one time.
 
Case III :  l2  v2 *  0 In this case the system is said to be underdamped because 
the damping coefficient is small compared to the spring constant. The roots 
m1 and m2 are now complex:
 
m1  l  #v2 2 l2i,  m2  l 2 #v2 2 l2i.
 
Thus the general solution of equation (11) is
 
x(t)  elt(c1 cos "v2 2 l2t  c2 sin "v2 2 l2t). 
(15)
As indicated in FIGURE 3.8.10, the motion described by (15) is oscillatory, but because of the coef-
ficient elt, the amplitudes of vibration S 0 as t S q.

(16)
The problem can be interpreted as representing the overdamped motion of a mass on a spring. 
The mass starts from a position 1 unit below the equilibrium position with a downward veloc-
ity of 1 ft/s.
  To graph x(t) we find the value of t for which the function has an extremum—that is, the 
value of time for which the first derivative (velocity) is zero. Differentiating (16) gives 
x(t)  5

3e4t so that x(t)  0 implies e3t  8
5 or t  1
3 ln 8
5  0.157. It follows from 
the first derivative test, as well as our intuition, that x(0.157)  1.069 ft is actually a maximum. 
In other words, the mass attains an extreme displacement of 1.069 feet below the equilibrium 
position.
  We should also check to see whether the graph crosses the t-axis, that is, whether the mass 
passes through the equilibrium position. This cannot happen in this instance since the equation 
x(t)  0, or e3t  2
5, has the physically irrelevant solution t  1

5  0.305.
  The graph of x(t), along with some other pertinent data, is given in FIGURE 3.8.11.
EXAMPLE 4 
Critically Damped Motion
An 8-pound weight stretches a spring 2 feet. Assuming that a damping force numerically 
equal to two times the instantaneous velocity acts on the system, determine the equation of 
motion if the weight is released from the equilibrium position with an upward velocity 
of 3 ft/s.
SOLUTION From Hooke’s law we see that 8  k(2) gives k  4 lb/ft and that W  mg gives 
m  8

(17)
The auxiliary equation for (17) is m2  8m  16  (m  4)2  0 so that m1  m2  4. 
Hence the system is critically damped and
 
x(t)  c1e4t  c2te4t. 
(18)
Applying the initial conditions x(0)  0 and x(0)  3, we find, in turn, that c1  0 and 
c2  3. Thus the equation of motion is
 
x(t)  3te4t. 
(19)
To graph x(t) we proceed as in Example 3. From x(t)  3e4t(1  4t) we see that x(t)  0 when 
t  1
4. The corresponding extreme displacement is x(1

in FIGURE 3.8.12, we interpret this value to mean that the weight reaches a maximum height 
of 0.276 foot above the equilibrium position.
EXAMPLE 5 
Underdamped Motion
A 16-pound weight is attached to a 5-foot-long spring. At equilibrium the spring measures 
8.2 feet. If the weight is pushed up and released from rest at a point 2 feet above the equilibrium 
position, find the displacements x(t) if it is further known that the surrounding medium offers 
a resistance numerically equal to the instantaneous velocity.

SOLUTION The elongation of the spring after the weight is attached is 8.2  5  3.2 ft, so 
it follows from Hooke’s law that 16  k(3.2) or k  5 lb/ft. In addition, m  16

(20)
Proceeding, we find that the roots of m2  2m  10  0 are m1  1  3i and m2  1  3i, 
which then implies the system is underdamped and
 
x(t)  et(c1 cos 3t  c2 sin 3t). 
(21)
Finally, the initial conditions x(0)  2 and x(0)  0 yield c1  2 and c2   2

equation of motion is
 
x(t)  et a2 cos 3t 2 2

(22)
 Alternative Form of x(t ) In a manner identical to the procedure used on page 153, 
we can write any solution
 
x(t)  elt(c1 cos "v2 2 l2t  c2 sin "v2 2 l2t)
in the alternative form
 
x(t)  Aelt sin ("v2 2 l2t  f), 
(23)
where A  "c2

2 and the phase angle f is determined from the equations
 
 sin f  c1
A,  cos f  c2

. 
The coefficient Aelt is sometimes called the damped amplitude of vibrations. Because (23) is 
not a periodic function, the number 2p/"v2 2 l2 is called the quasi period and "v2 2 l2/2p 
is the quasi frequency. The quasi period is the time interval between two successive maxima of 
x(t). You should verify, for the equation of motion in Example 5, that A  2!10/3 and f  4.391. 
Therefore an equivalent form of (22) is
 
x(t)  2"10

 et sin (3t  4.391).
3.8.3 Spring/Mass Systems: Driven Motion
 DE of Driven Motion with Damping Suppose we now take into consideration an 
external force f (t) acting on a vibrating mass on a spring. For example, f (t) could represent a 
driving force causing an oscillatory vertical motion of the support of the spring. See FIGURE 3.8.13. 
The inclusion of f (t) in the formulation of Newton’s second law gives the differential equation 
of driven or forced motion:

(26)
SOLUTION We can interpret the problem to represent a vibrational system consisting of a 
mass (m  1
5 slug or kilogram) attached to a spring (k  2 lb/ft or N/m). The mass is released 
from rest 1
2 unit (foot or meter) below the equilibrium position. The motion is damped ( b  1.2) 
and is being driven by an external periodic (T  p/2 s) force beginning at t  0. Intuitively 
we would expect that even with damping, the system would remain in motion until such time 
as the forcing function was “turned off,” in which case the amplitudes would diminish. However, 
as the problem is given, f (t)  5 cos 4t will remain “on” forever.
We first multiply the differential equation in (26) by 5 and solve
 
dx
 2
dt

dt  10x  0
by the usual methods. Since m1  3  i, m2  3  i, it follows that
 
xc(t)  e3t(c1 cos t  c2 sin t).
Using the method of undetermined coefficients, we assume a particular solution of the form 
xp(t)  A cos 4t  B sin 4t. Differentiating xp(t) and substituting into the DE gives
 
xp  6xp  10xp  ( 6A  24B) cos 4t  (24A  6B) sin 4t  25 cos 4t.
The resulting system of equations
 6A  24B  25,  24A  6B  0
yields A   25
102 and B  50
51. It follows that
 
x(t)  e3t(c1 cos t  c2 sin t)  25
102 cos 4t  50
51 sin 4t. 
(27)
When we set t  0 in the above equation, we obtain c1  38
51. By differentiating the  expression 
and then setting t  0, we also find that c2   86
51. Therefore the equation of motion is
 
x(t)  e3t

(28)
 Transient and Steady-State Terms When F is a periodic function, such as F (t) 
F0 sin gt or F (t)  F0 cos gt, the general solution of (25) for l 
 0 is the sum of a nonperiodic func-
tion xc(t) and a periodic function xp(t). Moreover, xc(t) dies off as time increases; that is, limtSq xc(t)  0. 
Thus for a long period of time, the displacements of the mass are closely approximated by the par-
ticular solution xp(t). The complementary function xc(t) is said to be a transient term or transient 
solution, and the function xp(t), the part of the solution that remains after an interval of time, is called 
a steady-state term or steady-state solution. Note therefore that the effect of the initial conditions 
on a spring/mass system driven by F is transient. In the particular solution (28), e3t(38
51 cos t  86
51 sin t) 
is a transient term and xp(t)   25
102 cos 4t  50
51 sin 4t is a steady-state term. The graphs of these two 
terms and the solution (28) are given in FIGURES 3.8.14(a) and 3.8.14(b), respectively.

 DE of Driven Motion Without Damping With a periodic impressed force and no 
damping force, there is no transient term in the solution of a problem. Also, we shall see that a 
periodic impressed force with a frequency near or the same as the frequency of free undamped 
vibrations can cause a severe problem in any oscillatory mechanical system.

SOLUTION  The complementary function is xc(t)  c1 cos vt  c2 sin vt. To obtain a

xp  v2xp  A(v2  g2) cos gt  B(v2  g2) sin gt  F0 sin gt.
Equating coefficients immediately gives A  0 and B  F0 /(v2  g2). Therefore

Applying the given initial conditions to the general solution

 Pure Resonance Although equation (30) is not defined for g  v, it is interesting to 
observe that its limiting value as g S v can be obtained by applying L’Hôpital’s rule. This 
limiting process is analogous to “tuning in” the frequency of the driving force (g/2p) to the 
frequency of free vibrations (v/2p). Intuitively we expect that over a length of time we

As suspected, when t S q the displacements become large; in fact, | x(tn) | S q when tn  np/v,

given in FIGURE 3.8.16 shows typical motion in this case.
In conclusion, it should be noted that there is no actual need to use a limiting process on (30) to 
obtain the solution for g  v. Alternatively, equation (31) follows by solving the initial-value

directly by the methods of undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters.
If the displacements of a spring/mass system were actually described by a function such 
as (31), the system would necessarily fail. Large oscillations of the mass would eventually force 
the spring beyond its elastic limit. One might argue too that the resonating model presented in 
Figure 3.8.16 is completely unrealistic, because it ignores the retarding effects of ever-present 
damping forces. Although it is true that pure resonance cannot occur when the smallest amount 
of damping is taken into consideration, large and equally destructive amplitudes of vibration 
(although bounded as t S q) can occur. See Problem 47 in Exercises 3.8.
3.8.4 Series Circuit Analogue
 LRC-Series Circuits As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, many different 
physical systems can be described by a linear second-order differential equation similar to the 
differential equation of forced motion with damping:
 
m d 2x
dt 2  b dx
dt  kx  f (t). 
(32)
If i(t) denotes current in the LRC-series electrical circuit shown in FIGURE 3.8.17, then the voltage 
drops across the inductor, resistor, and capacitor are as shown in Figure 1.3.5. By Kirchhoff’s 
second law, the sum of these voltages equals the voltage E(t) impressed on the circuit; that is,
 
L di
dt  Ri  1
C q  E(t). 
(33)
But the charge q(t) on the capacitor is related to the current i(t) by i  dq/dt, and so (33) becomes 
the linear second-order differential equation

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
If E(t)  0, the electrical vibrations of the circuit are said to be free. Since the auxiliary equation 
for (34) is Lm2  Rm  1/C  0, there will be three forms of the solution with R  0, depending 
on the value of the discriminant R2  4L/C. We say that the circuit is
 
overdamped if 
R2  4L/C  0,
 
critically damped if 
R2  4L/C  0,
and 
underdamped if 
R2  4L/C 	 0.
In each of these three cases the general solution of (34) contains the factor eRt/2L, and so q(t) S 0 
as t S q. In the underdamped case when q(0)  q0, the charge on the capacitor oscillates as it 
decays; in other words, the capacitor is charging and discharging as t S q. When E(t)  0 and 
R  0, the circuit is said to be undamped and the electrical vibrations do not approach zero as t 
increases without bound; the response of the circuit is simple harmonic.
EXAMPLE 9 
Underdamped Series Circuit
Find the charge q(t) on the capacitor in an LRC-series circuit when L  0.25 henry (h), 
R  10 ohms (V), C  0.001 farad (f ), E(t)  0 volts (V), q(0)  q0 coulombs (C), and 
i(0)  0 amperes (A).
SOLUTION  Since 1/C  1000, equation (34) becomes
 
1
4 q  10q  1000q  0   or   q  40q  4000q  0.
Solving this homogeneous equation in the usual manner, we find that the circuit is underdamped 
and q(t)  e20t (c1 cos 60t  c2 sin 60t). Applying the initial conditions, we find c1  q0 and c2  
q0 /3. Thus q(t)  q0e20t(cos 60t  1
3 sin 60t). Using (23), we can write the foregoing solution as
 
q(t)  q0"10

 e20t sin(60t  1.249). 
When there is an impressed voltage E(t) on the circuit, the electrical vibrations are said to be 
forced. In the case when R  0, the complementary function qc(t) of (34) is called a transient 
solution. If E(t) is periodic or a constant, then the particular solution qp(t) of (34) is a steady-
state solution.

3.9 Linear Models: Boundary-Value Problems
INTRODUCTION The preceding section was devoted to dynamic physical systems each 
described by a mathematical model consisting of a linear second-order differential equation 
accompanied by prescribed initial conditions—that is, side conditions that are specified on 
the unknown function and its first derivative at a single point. But often the mathematical 
description of a steady-state phenomenon or a static physical system demands that we solve 
a linear differential equation subject to boundary conditions—that is, conditions specified 
on the unknown function, or on one of its derivatives, or even on a linear combination of the 
unknown function and one of its derivatives, at two different points. By and large, the number 
of specified boundary conditions matches the order of the linear DE. We begin this section 
with an application of a relatively simple linear fourth-order differential equation associated 
with four boundary conditions.
 Deflection of a Beam Many structures are constructed using girders, or beams, and these 
beams deflect or distort under their own weight or under the influence of some external force. As we 
shall now see, this deflection y(x) is governed by a relatively simple linear fourth-order differential 
equation.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
To begin, let us assume that a beam of length L is homogeneous and has uniform cross sections 
along its length. In the absence of any load on the beam (including its weight), a curve joining the 
centroids of all its cross sections is a straight line called the axis of symmetry. See FIGURE 3.9.1(a). 
If a load is applied to the beam in a vertical plane containing the axis of symmetry, the beam, as 
shown in Figure 3.9.1(b), undergoes a distortion, and the curve connecting the centroids of all 
cross sections is called the deflection curve or elastic curve. The deflection curve approximates 
the shape of the beam. Now suppose that the x-axis coincides with the axis of symmetry and that 
the deflection y(x), measured from this axis, is positive if downward. In the theory of elasticity 
it is shown that the bending moment M(x) at a point x along the beam is related to the load per 
unit length w(x) by the equation
 
d
 2M
dx 2  w(x).

In addition, the bending moment M(x) is proportional to the curvature k of the elastic curve

where E and I are constants; E is Young’s modulus of elasticity of the material of the beam, and I
is the moment of inertia of a cross section of the beam (about an axis known as the neutral axis). 
The product EI is called the flexural rigidity of the beam.
Now, from calculus, curvature is given by k  y/[1  (y)2]3/2. When the deflection y(x) is 
small, the slope y  0 and so [1  (y)2]3/2  1. If we let k  y, equation (2) becomes M  EI y.

Using the given result in (1) to replace d 2M/dx2 in (3), we see that the deflection y(x) satisfies the

(4)
Boundary conditions associated with equation (4) depend on how the ends of the beam are 
supported. A cantilever beam is embedded or clamped at one end and free at the other. A div-
ing board, an outstretched arm, an airplane wing, and a balcony are common examples of such 
beams, but even trees, flagpoles, skyscrapers, and the George Washington monument can act as 
cantilever beams, because they are embedded at one end and are subject to the bending force of 
the wind. For a cantilever beam, the deflection y(x) must satisfy the following two conditions at 
the embedded end x  0:
• y(0)  0 since there is no deflection, and
•  y(0)  0 since the deflection curve is tangent to the x-axis (in other words, the slope 
of the deflection curve is zero at this point).
At x  L the free-end conditions are
• y(L)  0 since the bending moment is zero, and
• y(L)  0 since the shear force is zero.
The function F (x)  dM/dx  EI d3y/dx3 is called the shear force. If an end of a beam is 
simply supported or hinged (also called pin supported, and fulcrum supported), then we must 
have y  0 and y  0 at that end. Table 3.9.1 summarizes the boundary conditions that are 
 associated with (4). See FIGURE 3.9.2.

SOLUTION  From (4), we see that the deflection y(x) satisfies
 
EI d 4y
dx4  w0.
Because the beam is embedded at both its left end (x  0) and right end (x  L), there is no 
vertical deflection and the line of deflection is horizontal at these points. Thus the boundary 
conditions are
 
y(0)  0,   y(0)  0,   y(L)  0,   y(L)  0.
We can solve the nonhomogeneous differential equation in the usual manner (find yc by ob-
serving that m  0 is a root of multiplicity four of the auxiliary equation m4  0, and then 
find a particular solution yp by undetermined coefficients), or we can simply integrate the 
equation d  4y/dx4  w0 /EI four times in succession. Either way, we find the general solution 
of the equation y  yc  yp to be
 
y(x)  c1  c2x  c3x2  c4x3 
w0
24EI x4.
Now the conditions y(0)  0 and y(0)  0 give, in turn, c1  0 and c2  0, whereas the 
 remaining conditions y(L)  0 and y(L)  0 applied to y(x)  c3x2  c4x3  w0
24EI  x4 yield 
the simultaneous equations
 
 c3L2  c4L3 
w0
24EI L4  0
 
 3c3L  3c4L2  w0
6EI L3  0.
Solving this system gives c3  w0 L2/24EI and c4  w0L/12EI. Thus the deflection is
 
y(x)  w0 L2

deflection curve in FIGURE 3.9.3. 
The discussion of the beam notwithstanding, a physical system that is described by a two-point 
boundary-value problem usually involves a second-order differential equation. Hence, for the 
remainder of the discussion in this section we are concerned with boundary-value problems of 
the type
 
Solve:    
a2(x)  d 2y
dx2  a1(x)  dy
dx  a0(x) y  g(x), a , x , b 
(5)
 
Subject to:  
A1y(a)  B1y9(a)  C1
A2 y(b)  B2y9(b)  C2.
 
(6)
In (5) we assume that the coefficients a0(x), a1(x), a2(x), and g(x) are continuous on the interval 
[a, b] and that a2(x)  0 for all x in the interval. In (6) we assume that A1 and B1 are not both zero 
and A2 and B2 are not both zero. When g(x)  0 for all x in [a, b] and C1 and C2 are 0, we say that 
the boundary-value problem is homogeneous. Otherwise, we say that the boundary-value problem 
is nonhomogeneous. For example, the BVP y  y  0, y(0)  0, y(p)  0 is homogeneous, 
whereas the BVP y  y  1, y(0)  0, y(2p)  0 is nonhomogeneous.
 Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions In applications involving homogeneous boundary-
value problems, one or more of the coefficients in the differential equation (5) may depend on a 
constant parameter l. As a consequence the solutions y1(x) and y2(x) of the homogeneous DE (5) 
also depend on l. We often wish to determine those values of the parameter for which the 
boundary-value problem has nontrivial solutions. The next example illustrates this idea.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
EXAMPLE 2 
Nontrivial Solutions of a BVP
Solve the homogeneous boundary-value problem
 
y  ly  0,   y(0)  0,   y(L)  0.
SOLUTION  We consider three cases: l  0, l 	 0, and l  0.
Case I: 
 For l  0, the solution of the DE y   0 is y  c1x  c2. Applying the bound-
ary conditions y(0)  0 and y(L)  0 to this solution yields, in turn, c2  0 and 
c1  0. Hence for l  0, the only solution of the boundary-value problem is 
the trivial solution y  0.
Case II: 
 For l 	 0, it is convenient to write l  a2, where a  0. With this new nota-
tion the auxiliary equation is m2  a2  0 and has roots m1  a and m2  a. 
Because the interval on which we are working is finite, we choose to write 
the general solution of y   a2y  0 in the hyperbolic form y  c1 cosh ax  
c2 sinh ax. From y(0)  0 we see
y(0)  c1 cosh 0  c2 sinh 0  c1  1  c2  0  c1
 
 
 implies c1  0. Hence y  c2 sinh ax. The second boundary condition y(L) 0 
then requires c2 sinh aL  0. When a  0, sinh aL  0, and so we are forced 
to choose c2  0. Once again the only solution of the BVP is the trivial solution 
y  0.
Case III: 
 For l  0 we write l  a2, where a  0. The auxiliary equation m2  a2  0 
now has complex roots m1  ia and m2  ia, and so the general solution of 
the DE y  a2y  0 is y  c1 cos ax  c2 sin ax. As before, y(0)  0 yields 
c1  0 and so y  c2 sinx. Then y(L)  0 implies
c2 sin aL  0.
 
 
 If c2  0, then necessarily y  0. But this time we can require c2  0 since 
sin aL  0 is satisfied whenever aL is an integer multiple of p:
 
aL  np or a  np
L  or ln  a2
n  anp
L b
2
, n  1, 2, 3, p.
 
 
 Therefore for any real nonzero c2, yn  c2sin(npx/L) is a solution of the prob-
lem for each positive integer n. Since the differential equation is homogeneous, 
any constant multiple of a solution is also a solution. Thus we may, if desired, 
simply take c2  1. In other words, for each number in the sequence
 
l1  p2
L2, l2  4p2
L2 , l3  9p2
L2 , p,
 
 
the corresponding function in the sequence
 
y1 
 sin p
L, y2 
 sin 2p
L , y3 
 sin 3p
L ,  p,
 
 
is a nontrivial solution of the original problem. 
The numbers ln  n2p2/L2, n  1, 2, 3, ...for which the boundary-value problem in Example 2 
possesses nontrivial solutions are known as eigenvalues.  The nontrivial solutions that depend 
on these values of ln, yn  c2 sin(npx/L) or simply yn  sin(npx/L) are called eigenfunctions. 
The graphs of the eigenfunctions for n 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are shown in FIGURE 3.9.4. Note that each of 
the fives graphs passes through the two points (0, 0) and (0, L).
EXAMPLE 3 
Example 2 Revisited
If we choose L  p in Example 2, then the eigenvalues of the problem 
 
y  ly  0,   y(0)  0,   y(p)  0

are ln  n2, n  1, 2, 3, .... It follows then that the boundary-value problem
y  10y  0,   y(0)  0,   y(p)  0
possesses only the trivial solution y  0 because 10 is not an eigenvalue; that is, 10 is not the 
square of a positive integer. 
 Buckling of a Thin Vertical Column In the eighteenth century Leonhard Euler was 
one of the first mathematicians to study an eigenvalue problem in analyzing how a thin elastic 
column buckles under a compressive axial force.
Consider a long slender vertical column of uniform cross section and length L. Let y(x) denote 
the deflection of the column when a constant vertical compressive force, or load, P is applied to 
its top, as shown in FIGURE 3.9.5. By comparing bending moments at any point along the column 
we obtain
 
EI d 2y
dx2  Py  or  EI d 2y
dx2  Py  0, 
(7)
where E is Young’s modulus of elasticity and I is the moment of inertia of a cross section about 
a vertical line through its centroid.
EXAMPLE 4 
The Euler Load
Find the deflection of a thin vertical homogeneous column of length L subjected to a constant 
axial load P if the column is simply supported or hinged at both ends.
SOLUTION  The boundary-value problem to be solved is
 
EI d
 2y
dx
 2  Py  0, y(0)  0, y(L)  0.
First note that y  0 is a perfectly good solution of this problem. This solution has a simple 
intuitive interpretation: If the load P is not great enough, there is no deflection. The question 
then is this: For what values of P will the column bend? In mathematical terms: For what 
values of P does the given boundary-value problem possess nontrivial solutions?
By writing l  P/EI we see that
 
y  ly  0,   y(0)  0,   y(L)  0
is identical to the problem in Example 2. From Case III of that discussion we see that the 
deflection curves are yn(x)  c2 sin(npx/L), corresponding to the eigenvalues ln  Pn /EI  
n2p2/L2, n  1, 2, 3, .... Physically this means that the column will buckle or deflect only when 
the compressive force is one of the values Pn  n2p2EI/L2, n  1, 2, 3,  . . . . These different 
forces are called critical loads. The deflection curve corresponding to the smallest critical 
load P1  p2EI/L2, called the Euler load, is y1(x)  c2 sin(px/L) and is known as the first 
buckling mode. 
The deflection curves in Example 4 corresponding to n  1, n  2, and n  3 are shown in 
FIGURE 3.9.6. Note that if the original column has some sort of physical restraint put on it at x  L/2, 
then the smallest critical load will be P2  4p2EI/L2 and the deflection curve will be as shown 
in Figure 3.9.6(b). If restraints are put on the column at x  L/3 and at x  2L/3, then the column 
will not buckle until the critical load P3  9p2EI/L2 is applied and the deflection curve will be 
as shown in Figure 3.9.6(c). See Problem 25 in Exercises 3.9.

spring/mass system and the simple harmonic response of a series circuit. It is apparent when the 
model for the deflection of a thin column in (7) is written as d2y/dx2  (P/EI)y  0 that it is the 
same as (8). We encounter the basic equation (8) one more time in this section: as a model that 
defines the deflection curve or the shape y(x) assumed by a rotating string. The physical situation 
is analogous to when two persons hold a jump rope and twirl it in a synchronous manner. See 
FIGURE 3.9.7 parts (a) and (b).
Suppose a string of length L with constant linear density r (mass per unit length) is stretched along 
the x-axis and fixed at x  0 and x  L. Suppose the string is then rotated about that axis at a constant 
angular speed v. Consider a portion of the string on the interval [x, x  D x], where D x is small. If the 
magnitude T of the tension T, acting tangential to the string, is constant along the string, then the desired 
differential equation can be obtained by equating two different formulations of the net force acting on 
the string on the interval [x, x  D x]. First, we see from Figure 3.9.7(c) that the net vertical force is
 
F  T sin u2  T sin u1. 
(9)
When angles u1 and u2 (measured in radians) are small, we have sin u2  tan u2 and sin u1  tan u1. 
Moreover, since tan u2 and tan u1 are, in turn, slopes of the lines containing the vectors T2 and 
T1, we can also write
 
tan u2  y(x  D x)  and  tan u1  y(x).
Thus (9) becomes
 
F  T [ y(x  D x)  y(x)]. 
(10)
Second, we can obtain a different form of this same net force using Newton’s second law, F  ma. 
Here the mass of string on the interval is m  rD x; the centripetal acceleration of a body rotating 
with angular speed v in a circle of radius r is a  rv2. With D x small we take r  y. Thus the 
net vertical force is also approximated by
 
F  (rD x)yv2, 
(11)
where the minus sign comes from the fact that the acceleration points in the direction opposite 
to the positive y-direction. Now by equating (10) and (11) we have 
 
difference quotient
 
 
T [y(x  D x)  y(x)]  (rD x)yv2  or  T y9(x  Dx) 2 y9(x)
Dx
  rv2y  0. 
(12)
For D x close to zero the difference quotient in (12) is approximately the second derivative d2y/dx2. 
Finally we arrive at the model
 
T d 2y
dx2  rv2y  0. 
(13)
Since the string is anchored at its ends x  0 and x  L, we expect that the solution y(x) of equa-
tion (13) should also satisfy the boundary conditions y(0)  0 and y(L)  0.

REMARKS
(i) We will pursue the subject of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for linear second-order dif-
ferential equations in greater detail in Section 12.5.
(ii) Eigenvalues are not always easily found as they were in Example 2; you may have to 
approximate roots of equations such as tan x  x or cos x cosh x  1. See Problems 32 and 
38–42 in Exercises 3.9.
(iii) Boundary conditions can lead to a homogeneous algebraic system of linear equations 
where the unknowns are the coefficients ci in the general solution of the DE. Such a system 
is always consistent, but in order to possess a nontrivial solution (in the case when the number 
of equations equals the number of unknowns) we must have the determinant of the coefficients 
equal to zero. See Problems 21 and 22 in Exercises 3.9.

9. Blowing in the Wind In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo 
hammered the coast of South Carolina with winds estimated 
at times to be as high as 60.4 m/s (135 mi/h).  Of the bil-
lions of dollars in damage, approximately $420 million of 
this was due to the market value of loblolly pine (Pinus 
taeda) lumber in the Francis Marion National Forest. One 
image from that storm remains hauntingly bizarre: all 
through the forest and surrounding region, thousands upon 
thousands of pine trees lay pointing exactly in the same 
direction, and all the trees were broken 5–8 meters from 
their base. In September 1996, Hurricane Fran destroyed 
over 8.2 million acres of timber forest in eastern North 
Carolina. As happened seven years earlier, the planted lob-
lolly trees all broke at approximately the same height. This 
seems to be a reproducible phenomenon, brought on by the 
fact that the trees in these planted forests are approximately 
the same age and size.

Wind damage to loblolly pines

174 
| CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
 
    In this problem, we are going to examine a mathematical 
model for the  bending of loblolly pines in strong winds, and 
then use the model to predict the height at which a tree will 
break in hurricane-force winds.*
 
    Wind hitting the branches of a tree transmits a force to the 
trunk of the tree. The trunk is approximately a big cylindrical 
beam of length L, and so we will model the deflection y(x) of the 
tree with the static beam equation EIy(4)  w(x) (equation (4) in 
this section), where x is distance measured in meters from ground 
level.  Since the tree is rooted into the ground, the accompanying 
boundary conditions are those of a cantilevered beam: y(0)  0, 
y(0)  0 at the rooted end, and y0(L)  0,  y-(L)  0 at the 
free end, which is the top of the tree.
(a) Loblolly pines in the forest have the majority of their crown 
(that is, branches and needles) in the upper 50% of their 
length, so let’s ignore the force of the wind on the lower por-
tion of the tree. Furthermore, let’s assume that the wind hitting 
the tree’s crown results in a uniform load per unit length w0. 
In other words, the load on the tree is modeled by
 
w(x)  e0,
0 # x , L / 2
w0,
L / 2 # x # L
 
We can determine y(x) by integrating both sides of 
EIy(4)  w(x). Integrate w(x) on [0, L/2] and then on 
[L /2, L] to find an expression for EIy-(x) on each of these 
intervals. Let c1 be the constant of integration on [0, L/2] 
and c2 be the constant of integration on [L/2, L]. Apply 
the boundary condition y-(L)  0 and solve for c2. Then 
find the value of c1 that ensures continuity of the third 
derivative y- at the point x  L/2.
(b) Following the same procedure as in part (a) show that

 (8x3 2 24Lx2  24L2x 2 L3),

Integrate EIy to obtain the deflection y(x). 
(c) Note that in our model y(L) describes the maximum 
amount by which the loblolly will bend. Compute this 
quantity in terms of the problem’s parameters.
 10. Blowing in the Wind—Continued 
By making some 
assumptions about the density of crown’s foliage, the total force 
F on the tree can be calculated using a formula from physics: 
F  rAv2/6 where r L 1.225 kg/m3 is the density of air, v is the 
wind speed in m/s, and A is the cross-sectional area of the tree’s 
crown. If we assume that the crown in roughly cylindrical, then 
its cross section is a rectangle of area A  (2R)(L/2)  RL, 
where R is the average radius of the cylinder. Then the total 
force per unit length is then w0  F/(L/2)  0.408Rv 2. 
 
    The cross-sectional moment of inertia for a uniform cy-
lindrical beam is I  1
4pr4, where r is the radius of the cylin-
der (tree trunk). 
*For further information about the bending of trees in high winds, see 
the articles by W. Kubinec (Phys. Teacher, March, 1990), or F. Mergen 
(J. Forest.) 52(2), 1954.
 
    By your answer to part (c) in Problem 9 and the explana-
tions above, the amount that a loblolly will bend depends on 
each of the parameters in the following table.
Symbol 
Description 
Typical values
r 
radius of trunk 
0.15–0.25 m
R 
radius of crown 
3–4 m
L 
height of pine 
15–20 m
E 
modulus of elasticity 
11–14 N/m2
v 
Hugo wind speeds 
40–60 m/s (90–135 mi/h)
(a) Mathematically show how each parameter affects the bend-
ing, and explain in physical terms why this makes sense. 
(For example, a large value of E results in less bending since 
E appears in the denominator of y(L). This means that hard 
wood like oak bends less than a soft wood such as palm.)
(b) Graph y(x) for 40 m/s winds for an “average” tree by 
choosing average values of each parameter (for example, 
r  0.2, R  3.5, and so on). Graph y(x) for 60 m/s winds 
for a “tall” (but otherwise average) pine.
(c) Recall that in the derivation of the beam equation on page 
166 it was assumed that the deflection of the beam was 
small. What is the largest possible value of y(L) that is 
predicted by the model if all parameters are chosen from 
the given table? Is this prediction realistic, or is the math-
ematical model no longer valid for parameters in this range?
(d) The beam equation always predicts that a beam will bend, 
even if the load and flexural rigidity reflect an elephant 
standing on a toothpick! Different methods are used by 
engineers to predict when and where a beam will break. 
In particular, a beam subject to a load will break at the 
location where the stress function y(x)/I(x) reaches a max-
imum. Differentiate the function in part (b) of Problem 9 to 
obtain EI y, and use this to obtain the stress y(x)/I(x). 
(e) Real pine tree trunks are not uniformly wide; they taper as they 
approach the top of the tree. Substitute r(x)  0.2  x/(15L) 
into the equation for I and then use a graphing utility to graph 
the resulting stress as a function of height for an average 
loblolly. Where does the maximum stress occur? Does this 
location depend on the speed of the wind? On the radius of 
the crown? On the height of the pine tree? Compare the 
model to observed data from Hurricane Hugo.
(f ) A mathematical model is sensitive to an assumption if small 
changes in the assumption lead to widely different predic-
tions for the model. Repeat part (e) using r(x)  0.2  x/(20L) 
and r(x)  0.2  x/(10L) as formulas that describe the 
radius of a pine tree trunk that tapers. Is our model sensitive 
to our choice for these formulas?

Buckling of a Thin Column
 23. Consider Figure 3.9.6. Where should physical restraints be 
placed on the column if we want the critical load to be P4? 
Sketch the deflection curve corresponding to this load.
 24. The critical loads of thin columns depend on the end conditions 
of the column. The value of the Euler load P1 in Example 4 was 
derived under the assumption that the column was hinged at 
both ends. Suppose that a thin vertical homogeneous column 
is embedded at its base (x  0) and free at its top (x  L) and 
that a constant axial load P is applied to its free end. This load 
either causes a small deflection d as shown in FIGURE 3.9.9 or 
does not cause such a deflection. In either case the differential 
equation for the deflection y(x) is
 
EI d

(a) What is the predicted deflection when d  0?
(b) When d  0, show that the Euler load for this column is 
one-fourth of the Euler load for the hinged column in 
Example 4.

 25. As was mentioned in Problem 24, the differential equation (7) 
that governs the deflection y(x) of a thin elastic column subject 
to a constant compressive axial force P is valid only when the 
ends of the column are hinged. In general, the differential 
equation governing the deflection of the column is given by
 
d 2
dx2 aEI d 2y
dx2b  P d 2y
dx2  0.
 
 Assume that the column is uniform (EI is a constant) and that 
the ends of the column are hinged. Show that the solution of 
this fourth-order differential equation subject to the boundary 
conditions y(0)  0, y(0)  0, y(L)  0, y(L)  0 is equiva-
lent to the analysis in Example 4.
 26. Suppose that a uniform thin elastic column is hinged at the 
end x  0 and embedded at the end x  L.
(a) Use the fourth-order differential equation given in 
Problem 25 to find the eigenvalues ln, the critical loads 
Pn, the Euler load P1, and the deflections yn(x).
(b) Use a graphing utility to graph the first buckling mode.
Rotating String
 27. Consider the boundary-value problem introduced in the construc-
tion of the mathematical model for the shape of a rotating string:
 
  
T d 2y
dx2  rv2y  0, y (0)  0, y (L)  0.
 
 For constant T and r, define the critical speeds of angular 
rotation vn as the values of v for which the boundary-value 
problem has nontrivial solutions. Find the critical speeds vn 
and the corresponding deflections yn(x).
 28. When the magnitude of tension T is not constant, then a model 
for the deflection curve or shape y(x) assumed by a rotating 
string is given by
 
  
d

dxd  rv2y  0.
 
 Suppose that 1 	 x 	 e and that T(x)  x2.
(a) If y(1)  0, y(e)  0, and rv2  0.25, show that the 
critical speeds of angular rotation are

and the corresponding deflections are
 
     yn(x)  c2x1/2

(b) Use a graphing utility to graph the deflection curves on 
the interval [1, e] for n  1, 2, 3. Choose c2  1.

 29. Temperature in a Sphere  Consider two concentric spheres 
of radius r  a and r  b, a 	 b. See FIGURE 3.9.10. The tem-
perature u(r) in the region between the spheres is determined 
from the boundary-value problem

satisfies the differential equation 
 EI d 4y

  where r is density per unit length. If the shaft is simply sup-

shape from y  0 to a deflection given by y1(x).

Discussion Problems
 33. Simple Harmonic Motion  The model mx  kx  0 for 
simple harmonic motion, discussed in Section 3.8, can be 
related to Example 2 of this section.
 
    Consider a free undamped spring/mass system for which 
the spring constant is, say, k  10 lb/ft. Determine those masses 
mn that can be attached to the spring so that when each mass is 
released at the equilibrium position at t  0 with a nonzero 
velocity v0, it will then pass through the equilibrium position at 
t  1 second. How many times will each mass mn pass through 
the equilibrium  position in the time interval 0  t  1?
 34. Damped Motion  Assume that the model for the spring/mass 
system in Problem 33 is replaced by mx  2x  kx  0. 
In other words, the system is free but is subjected to damping 
numerically equal to two times the instantaneous velocity. 
With the same initial conditions and spring constant as in 
Problem 33, investigate whether a mass m can be found that 
will pass through the equilibrium position at t  1 second.
In Problems 35 and 36, determine whether it is possible to find 
values y0 and y1 (Problem 35) and values of L  0 (Problem 36)

3.10 Green’s Functions
INTRODUCTION 
We have seen in Section 3.8 that the linear second-order differential equation
 
a2(x)  d 2y
dx2  a1(x)  dy
dx  a0(x)y  g(x) 
(1)
plays an important role in applications. In the mathematical analysis of physical systems it is 
often desirable to express the response or output y(x) of (1) subject to either initial conditions or 
boundary conditions directly in terms of the forcing function or input g(x). In this manner the 
response of the system can quickly be analyzed for different forcing functions.
To see how this is done we start by examining solutions of initial-value problems in which 
the DE (1) has been put into the standard form
 
y0  P(x)y9  Q(x)y  f (x) 
(2)
by dividing the equation by the lead coefficient a2(x). We also assume throughout this section 
that the coefficient functions P(x), Q(x), and f(x) are continuous on some common interval I.
3.10.1 Initial-Value Problems
 Three Initial-Value Problems We will see as the discussion unfolds that the solution 
of the second-order initial-value problem
 
y0  P(x)y9  Q(x)y  f (x), y(x0)  y0, y9(x0)  y1  
(3)
can be expressed as the superposition of two solutions: the solution yh of the associated homo-
geneous DE with nonhomogeneous initial conditions
 
y0  P(x)y9  Q(x)y  0, y(x0)  y0, y9(x0)  y1, 
(4)
and the solution yp of the nonhomogeneous DE with homogeneous (that is, zero) initial conditions
 
y0  P(x)y9  Q(x)y  f (x), y(x0)  0, y9(x0)  0. 
(5)
As we have seen in the preceding sections of this chapter, in the case where P and Q are 
constants the solution of the IVP (4) presents no difficulties: We use the methods of Section 3.3 
to find the general solution of the homogeneous DE and then use the given initial conditions to 
determine the two constants in that solution. So we will focus on the solution of the IVP (5). 
Because of the zero initial conditions, the solution of (5) could describe a physical system that 
is initially at rest and so is sometimes called a rest solution.
 Green’s Function If y1(x) and y2(x) form a fundamental set of solutions on the interval 
I of the associated homogeneous form of (2), then a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous 
equation (2) on the interval I can be found by variation of parameters. Recall from (3) of Section 3.5, 
the form of this solution is
 
yp(x)  u1(x)y1(x)  u2(x)y2(x). 
(6)
The variable coefficients u1(x) and u2(x) in (6) are defined by (5) of Section 3.5:
 
u91 (x)  y2(x) f (x)
W
, u92(x)  y1(x) f (x)

Here at least one of the numbers 
y0 or y1 is assumed to be nonzero. 
If both y0 and y1 are 0, then the 
solution of the IVP is y  0.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
The linear independence of y1(x) and y2(x) on the interval I guarantees that the Wronskian 
W  W( y1(x), y2(x))  0 for all x in I. If x and x0 are numbers in I, then integrating the derivatives 
in (7) on the interval [x0, x] and substituting the results in (6) give
 yp(x)  y1(x)#

where  
W(t)  W( y1(t), y2(t))  2  y1(t) y2(t)

From the properties of the definite integral, the two integrals in the second line of (8) can be 
rewritten as a single integral
yp(x)  #
x
x0
G(x, t) f (t) dt. 
(9)
The function G(x, t) in (9),
G(x, t)  y1(t)y2(x) 2 y1(x)y2(t)
W(t)
, 
(10)
is called the Green’s function for the differential equation (2).
Observe that a Green’s function (10) depends only on the fundamental solutions, y1(x) and 
y2(x) of the associated homogeneous differential equation for (2) and not on the forcing func-
tion f (x). Therefore all linear second-order differential equations (2) with the same left-hand side 
but different forcing functions have the same Green’s function. So an alternative title for (10) is 
the Green’s function for the second-order differential operator L  D2  P(x)D  Q(x).
EXAMPLE 1 
Particular Solution
Use (9) and (10) to find a particular solution of y  y  f (x).
SOLUTION  The solutions of the associated homogeneous equation y  y  0 are y1  e x, 
y2  ex, and W( y1(t), y2(t))  2. It follows from (10) that the Green’s function is
 
G(x, t)  e tex 2 e xet
2
 e x2t 2 e(x2t)
2
 sinh(x 2 t). 
(11)
Thus from (9), a particular solution of the DE is
yp(x)  #
x
x0
sinh(x 2 t) f (t) dt. 
(12)
EXAMPLE 2 
General Solutions
Find the general solution of the following nonhomogeneous differential equations.
(a) y0 2 y  1/x 
(b) y0 2 y  e2x
SOLUTION  From Example 1, both DEs possess the same complementary function 
yc  c1ex  c2e x. Moreover, as pointed out in the paragraph preceding Example 1, the 
Green’s function for both differential equations is (11).
(a)  With the identifications f (x)  1/x and f (t)  1/t we see from (12) that a particular so-
lution of y0 2 y  1/x is yp(x)  #
x
x0
sinh(x 2 t)
t
 dt. Thus the general solution y  yc  yp
of the given DE on any interval fx0, xg not containing the origin is
 
y  c1e x  c2ex  #
x
x0
sinh(x 2 t)
t
 dt. 
(13)
Because y1(x) and y2(x) are constant with 
respect to the integration on t, we can 
move these functions inside the deﬁ nite 
integrals.
Important. Read this paragraph 
a second time.

You should compare this solution with that found in Example 3 of Section 3.5.
(b)  With f (x)  e2x in (12), a particular solution of y0 2 y  e2x is 
yp(x)  e
x
x0sinh(x 2 t)e2t dt. The general solution y  yc  yp is then
y  c1e x  c2ex  #
x
x0
sinh(x 2 t) e2t dt. 
(14)
Now consider the special initial-value problem (5) with homogeneous initial conditions. One 
way of solving the problem when f (x) 2 0 has already been illustrated in Sections 3.4 and 3.5; 
that is, apply the initial conditions y(x0)  0, y9(x0)  0 to the general solution of the nonho-
mogeneous DE. But there is no actual need to do this because we already have solution of the 
IVP at hand; it is the function defined in (9).
Theorem 3.10.1 
Solution of the IVP (5) 
The function yp(x) defined in (9) in the solution of the initial-value problem (5).
PROOF: By construction we know that yp(x) in (9) satisfies the nonhomogeneous DE. Next, 
because a definite integral has the property e
a
a  0 we have
 
yp(x0)  #
x0
x0
G(x0, t) f (t) dt  0.
Finally, to show that y9p(x0)  0 we utilize the Leibniz formula* for the derivative of an integral:
 
y9p(x)  G(x, x) f (x)  #
x
x0
   y1(t)y92(x) 2 y91(x)y2(t)
W(t)
 f (t) dt.
Hence, 
y9p(x0)  #
x0
x0
  y1(t)y92(x0) 2 y91(x0)y2(t)
W(t)
 f (t) dt  0.

Example 2 Revisited
Solve the initial-value problems
(a) y0 2 y  1/x, y(1)  0, y9(1)  0  (b) y0 2 y  e2x, y(0)  0, y9(0)  0.
SOLUTION  (a)  With x0  1 and f (t)  1/t, it follows from (13) of Example 2 and 
Theorem 3.10.1 that the solution of the initial-value problem is
 
yp(x)  #
x

  sinh(x 2 t)
t

where f1, xg,  x . 0.
(b) Identifying x0  0 and f (t)  e2t, we see from (14) that the solution of the IVP is
 
yp(x)  #
x
0
sinh(x 2 t) e2t dt. 
(15)
In Part (b) of Example 3, we can carry out the integration in (15), but bear in mind that x is

 Initial-Value Problems—Continued We can now make use of Theorem 3.10.1 to 
find the solution of the initial-value problem posed in (3).
Theorem 3.10.2 
Solution of the IVP (3) 
If yh is the solution of the initial-value problem (4) and yp is the solution (9) of the initial-value 
problem (5) on the interval I, then
 
y  yh  yp 
(16)
is the solution of the initial-value problem (3).
PROOF: Because yh is a linear combination of the fundamental solutions, it follows from (10) 
of Section 3.1 that y  yh  yp is a solution of the nonhomogeneous DE. Moreover, since yh 
satisfies the initial conditions in (4) and yp satisfies the initial conditions in (5), we have
 
 y(x0)  yh(x0)  yp(x0)  y0  0  y0
 
 y9(x0)  y9h(x0)  y9p(x0)  y1  0  y1.
Keeping in mind the absence of a forcing function in (4) and the presence of such a term in 
(5), we see from (16) that the response y(x) of a physical system described by the initial-value 
problem (3) can be separated into two different responses:
 
y(x)    yh(x)      yp(x) 
(17)
 
response of system 
response of system
 
due to initial conditions 
due to the forcing
 
y(x0)  y0, y(x0)  y1 
function f
Here we have used the trigo-
nometric identity sin(2x  2t)  
sin 2x cos 2t  cos 2x sin 2t.

In different symbols, the following initial-value problem represents the pure resonance situ-
ation for a vibrating spring/mass system. See page 161.
EXAMPLE 5 
Using Theorem 3.10.2
Solve the initial-value problem
y0  4y  sin 2x, y(0)  1, y9(0)  2.
SOLUTION  We solve two initial-value problems.
  First, we solve y0  4y  0, y(0)  1, y9(0)  2. By applying the initial conditions to 
the general solution y(x)  c1 cos 2x  c2 sin 2x of the homogeneous DE, we find that c1  1
and c2  1. Therefore, yh(x)  cos 2x  sin 2x.
  Next we solve y0  4y  sin 2x, y(0)  0, y9(0)  0. Since the left-hand side of the dif-
ferential equation is the same as the DE in Example 4, the Green’s function is the same; namely, 
G(x, t)  1
2 sin 2(x 2 t). With f (t)  sin 2t we see from (9) that the solution of this second 
problem is yp(x)  1
2e
x
0sin 2(x 2 t) sin 2t dt.
  Finally, in view of (16) in Theorem 3.10.2, the solution of the original IVP is
 
y(x)  yh(x)  yp(x)  cos 2x 2 sin 2x  1
2#
x
0
sin 2(x 2 t) sin 2t dt. 
(18)
  If desired, we can integrate the definite integral in (18) by using the trigonometric identity
sin A sin B  1
2
 fcos(A 2 B) 2 cos(A  B)g
with A  2(x 2 t) and B  2t:
 yp(x)  1
2#
x
0
sin 2(x 2 t) sin 2t dt
  1
4#
x

fcos(2x 2 4t) 2 cos 2xg dt

4 sin (2x 2 4t) 2 t  cos 2xd
x
0
  1
8 sin 2x 2 1

 x cos 2x.
Hence, the solution (18) can be rewritten as
y(x)  yh(x)  yp(x)  cos 2x 2 sin 2x  a1
8 sin 2x 2 1
4
  x cos 2xb,
or 
y(x)  cos 2x 2 7
8 sin 2x 2 1
4
  x cos 2x. 
(20)
Note that the physical significance indicated in (17) is lost in (20) after combining like terms in 
the two parts of the solution y(x)  yh(x)  yp(x).
The beauty of the solution given in (18) is that we can immediately write down the response 
of a system if the initial conditions remain the same but the forcing function is changed. For 
example, if the problem in Example 5 is changed to
y0  4y  x, y(0)  1, 
y9(0)  2,

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
we simply replace sin 2t in the integral in (18) by t and the solution is then
 
 y(x)  yh(x)  yp(x)
  cos 2x 2 sin 2x  1
2#

Because the forcing function f is isolated in the particular solution yp(x)  e
x
x0G(x, t) f (t) dt,
the solution in (16) is useful when f is piecewise defined. The next example illustrates this idea.
EXAMPLE 6 
An Initial-Value Problem
Solve the initial-value problem
 
y0  4y  f (x), y(0)  1, y9(0)  2,
when the forcing function f is piecewise defined:
 
f (x)  •
0,           x , 0
sin 2x,  0 # x # 2p
0,           x . 2p.

y(x)  cos 2x 2 sin 2x  1

sin 2(x 2 t)  f (t) dt.
Because f is defined in three pieces, we consider three cases in the evaluation of the definite 
integral. For x 	 0,

and so
 
   
y(x)  yh(x)  yp(x)  cos 2x 2 sin 2x  yp(x).
Putting all the pieces together we get

The graph y(x) is given in FIGURE 3.10.1.
We next examine how a boundary-value problem (BVP) can be solved using a different kind 
of Green’s function.
3.10.2 Boundary-Value Problems
In contrast to a second-order IVP in which y(x) and y(x) are specified at the same point, a BVP 
for a second-order DE involves conditions on y(x) and y(x) that are specified at two different 
points x  a and x  b. Conditions such as
 
y(a)  0, y(b)  0; y(a)  0, y9(b)  0; y9(a)  0, y9(b)  0
are just special cases of the more general homogeneous boundary conditions
 
A1y(a)  B1y9(a)  0 
(21)
and 
      A2 y(b)  B2 y9(b)  0, 
(22)
where A1, A2, B1, and B2 are constants. Specifically, our goal is to find an integral solution yp(x) 
that is analogous to (9) for nonhomogeneous boundary-value problems of the form
 
y0  P(x)y9  Q(x)y  f (x),
 
A1y(a)  B1y9(a)  0 
(23)
 
A2 y(b)  B2 y9(b)  0.
In addition to the usual assumptions that P(x), Q(x), and f (x) are continuous on [a, b], we assume 
that the homogeneous problem
 
 y0  P(x)y9  Q(x)y  0,
 
    A1y(a)  B1y9(a)  0
 
     A2 y(b)  B2 y9(b)  0,
possesses only the trivial solution y  0. This latter assumption is sufficient to guarantee that a 
unique solution of (23) exists and is given by an integral yp(x)  e
b
a G(x, t) f (t) dt, where G(x, t) 
is a Green’s function.
The starting point in the construction of G(x, t) is again the variation of parameters formulas 
(6) and (7).

| CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
 Another Green’s Function Suppose y1(x) and y2(x) are linearly independent solutions 
on fa, bg of the associated homogeneous form of the DE in (23) and that x is a number in the 
interval fa, bg. Unlike the construction of (8) where we started by integrating the derivatives in 
(7) over the same interval, we now integrate the first equation in (7) on fb, xg and the second 
equation in (7) on fa, xg:
 
u1(x)  #
x
b
y2(t) f (t)
W(t)
 dt and 
u2(x)  #
x
a
y1(t) f (t)
W(t)
 dt. 
(24)
The reason for integrating u91 (x) and u92 (x) over different intervals will become clear shortly. 
From (24), a particular solution yp(x)  u1(x)y1(x)  u2(x)y2(x) of the DE is
 
yp(x)  y1(x)#
b
x
y2(t) f (t)
W(t)
 dt  y2(x)#
x
a
y1(t) f (t)
W(t)

or 
yp(x)  #
x
a
y2(x)y1(t)
W(t)
 f (t) dt  #
b
x
y1(x)y2(t)
W(t)
 f (t) dt. 
(25)
The right-hand side of (25) can be written compactly as a single integral
 
yp(x)  #
b
a
G(x, t) f (t) dt, 
(26)
where the function G(x, t) is
 
G(x, t)  μ
y1(t)y2(x)
W(t)
,
                          a # t # x
y1(x)y2(t)
W(t)
,
                          x # t # b.
 
(27)
The piecewise-defined function (27) is called a Green’s function for the boundary-value prob-
lem (23). It can be proved that G(x, t) is a continuous function of x on the interval [a, b].
Now if the solutions y1(x) and y2(x) used in the construction of (27) are chosen in such a 
manner that at x  a, y1(x) satisfies A1y1(a)  B1y91(a)  0, and at x  b, y2(x) satisfies 
A2y2(b)  B2y92(b)  0, then, wondrously, yp(x) defined in (26) satisfies both homogeneous 
boundary conditions in (23).
To see this we will need
 
 yp(x)  u1(x)y1(x)  u2(x)y2(x)
 
(28)
and 
 y9p(x)  u1(x)y91(x)  y1(x)u91(x)  u2(x)y92(x)  y2(x)u92(x)
 
  u1(x)y91(x)  u2(x)y92(x).
 
(29)
Before proceeding, observe in (24) that u1(b)  0 and u2(a)  0. In view of the second of these 
two properties we can show that yp(x) satisfies (21) whenever y1(x) satisfies the same boundary 
condition. From (28) and (29) we have
 
0
0
 
 A1yp(a)  B1y9p(a)  A1fu1(a)y1(a)  u2(a)y2(a)g  B1fu1(a)y91(a)  u2(a)y92(a)g
 
  u1(a)fA1y1(a)  B1y91(a)g  0.
 
0 from (21)
here we used the minus
sign in (24) to reverse
the limits of integration
The last line in (29) results from 
the fact that 
y1(x)u1(x)  y2(x)u2(x)  0.
See the discussion in Section 3.5 
following (4).

Likewise, u1(b)  0 implies that whenever y2(x) satisfies (22) so does yp(x):
 
0
0
 
 A2 yp(b)  B2 y9p(b)  A2fu1(b)y1(b)  u2(b)y2(b)g  B2fu1(b)y91(b)  u2(b)y92(b)g
  u2(b)fA2 y2(b)  B2 y92(b)g  0.
0 from (22)
The next theorem summarizes these results.
Theorem 3.10.3 
Solution of the BVP (23)
Let y1(x) and y2(x) be linearly independent solutions of
 
y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  0
on [a, b], and suppose y1(x) and y2(x) satisfy boundary conditions (21) and (22), respectively. 
Then the function yp(x) defined in (26) is a solution of the boundary-value problem (23).
EXAMPLE 7 
Using Theorem 3.10.3
Solve the boundary-value problem
y0  4y  3, y9(0)  0, y(p/2)  0.
SOLUTION  The solutions of the associated homogeneous equation y0  4y  0 are 
y1(x)  cos 2x and y2(x)  sin 2x and y1(x) satisfies y9(0)  0, whereas y2(x) satisfies 
y(p/2)  0. The Wronskian is W( y1, y2)  2, and so from (27) we see that the Green’s func-
tion for the boundary-value problem is
 
G(x, t)  e
1
2 cos 2t sin 2x,    0 # t # x
1
2 cos 2x sin 2t,    x # t # p/2.
It follows from Theorem 3.10.3 that a solution of the BVP is (26) with the identifications 
a  0, b  p/2, and f (t)  3:
 
 yp(x)  3#
p/2

 sin 2x#

2
 cos 2x#
p/ 2
x
sin 2t dt,
or after evaluating the definite integrals, yp(x)  3
4  3
4 cos 2x.
Don’t infer from the preceding example that the demand that y1(x) satisfy (21) and y2(x) satisfy 
(22) uniquely determines these functions. As we see in the last example, there is a certain arbi-
trariness in the selection of these functions.

| CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
From the auxiliary equation m(m 2 1) 2 3m  3  (m 2 1)(m 2 3)  0 the general so-
lution of the associated homogeneous equation is y  c1x  c2x3. Applying y(1)  0 to 
this solution implies c1  c2  0 or c1  c2. By choosing c2  1 we get c1  1 and 
y1  x 2 x3. On the other hand, y(2)  0 applied to the general solution shows 2c1  8c2  0 
or c1  4c2. The choice c2  1 now gives c1  4 and so y2(x)  4x 2 x3. The Wronskian 
of these two functions is
 
W(y1(x), y2(x))  2 x 2 x3     4x 2 x3
1 2 3x2    4 2 3x2 2  6x3.
Hence, the Green’s function for the boundary-value problem is
 
G(x, t)  μ
(t 2 t 3)(4x 2 x3)
6t3
,
                   1 # t # x
(x 2 x3)(4t 2 t 3)
6t3
,
                    x # t # 2.
In order to identify the correct forcing function f we must write the DE in standard form:
 
y0 2 3
x
 y9  3
x2
 y  24x3.
From this equation we see that f (t)  24t3 and so (26) becomes

Straightforward definite integration and algebraic simplification yields the solution

Nonlinear Models
INTRODUCTION 
In this section we examine some nonlinear higher-order mathematical 
models. We are able to solve some of these models using the substitution method introduced on 
page 148. In some cases where the model cannot be solved, we show how a nonlinear DE can 
be replaced by a linear DE through a process called linearization.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
where F(x)  kx. Since x denotes the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position, 
F(x)  kx is Hooke’s law, that is, the force exerted by the spring that tends to restore the mass 
to the equilibrium position. A spring acting under a linear restoring force F(x)  kx is naturally 
referred to as a linear spring. But springs are seldom perfectly linear. Depending on how it is 
constructed and the material used, a spring can range from “mushy” or soft to “stiff ” or hard, so 
that its restorative force may vary from something below to something above that given by the 
linear law. In the case of free motion, if we assume that a nonaging spring possesses some non-
linear characteristics, then it might be reasonable to assume that the restorative force F(x) of a 
spring is proportional to, say, the cube of the displacement x of the mass beyond its equilibrium 
position or that F(x) is a linear combination of powers of the displacement such as that given by 
the nonlinear function F(x)  kx  k1x3. A spring whose mathematical model incorporates a 
nonlinear restorative force, such as
 
m d
 2x
dt
 2  kx3  0   or   m d
 2x
dt
 2  kx  k1x3  0, 
(2)
is called a nonlinear spring. In addition, we examined mathematical models in which damping 
imparted to the motion was proportional to the instantaneous velocity dx/dt, and the restoring 
force of a spring was given by the linear function F(x)  kx. But these were simply assumptions; 
in more realistic situations damping could be proportional to some power of the instantaneous 
velocity dx/dt. The nonlinear differential equation
 
m d
 2x
dt
 2  b  2 dx
dt 2  dx
dt  kx  0 
(3)
is one model of a free spring/mass system with damping proportional to the square of the veloc-
ity. One can then envision other kinds of models: linear damping and nonlinear restoring force, 
nonlinear damping and nonlinear restoring force, and so on. The point is, nonlinear characteris-
tics of a physical system lead to a mathematical model that is nonlinear.
Notice in (2) that both F(x)  kx3 and F(x)  kx  k1x3 are odd functions of x. To see why a 
polynomial function containing only odd powers of x provides a reasonable model for the restor-
ing force, let us express F as a power series centered at the equilibrium position x  0:
 
F(x)  c0  c1x  c2x2  c3x3  ….
When the displacements x are small, the values of xn are negligible for n sufficiently large. If we 
truncate the power series with, say, the fourth term, then
 
F(x)  c0  c1x  c2x2  c3x3.
In order for the force at x  0 (F(x)  c0  c1x  c2x2  c3x3) and the force at x  0 (F(x)  
c0  c1x  c2x2  c3x3) to have the same magnitude but act in the opposite directions, we must 
have F(x)  F(x). Since this means F is an odd function, we must have c0  0 and c2  0, 
and so F(x)  c1x  c3x3. Had we used only the first two terms in the series, the same argument 
yields the linear function F(x)  c1x. For discussion purposes we shall write c1  k and c2  k1. 
A restoring force with mixed powers such as F(x)  kx  k1x2, and the corresponding vibrations, 
are said to be unsym metrical.
 Hard and Soft Springs Let us take a closer look at the equation in (1) in the case where 
the restoring force is given by F(x)  kx  k1x3, k  0. The spring is said to be hard if k1  0 and 
soft if k1  0. Graphs of three types of restoring forces are illustrated in FIGURE 3.11.1. The next 
example illustrates these two special cases of the differential equation m d 2x/dt 2  kx  k1x3  0, 
m  0, k  0.

are special cases of (2) and are models of a hard spring and soft spring, respectively. 
FIGURE 3.11.2(a) shows two solutions of (4) and Figure 3.11.2(b) shows two solutions of (5) 
obtained from a numerical solver. The curves shown in red are solutions satisfying the initial 
conditions x(0)  2, x(0)  3; the two curves in blue are solutions satisfying x(0)  2, 
x(0)  0. These solution curves certainly suggest that the motion of a mass on the hard spring 
is oscillatory, whereas motion of a mass on the soft spring is not oscillatory. But we must 
be careful about drawing conclusions based on a couple of solution curves. A more complete 
picture of the nature of the solutions of both equations can be obtained from the qualitative 
analysis discussed in Chapter 11. 
 Nonlinear Pendulum Any object that swings back and forth is called a physical pen-
dulum. The simple pendulum is a special case of the physical pendulum and consists of a rod 
of length l to which a mass m is attached at one end. In describing the motion of a simple pen-
dulum in a vertical plane, we make the simplifying assumptions that the mass of the rod is 
negligible and that no external damping or driving forces act on the system. The displacement 
angle u of the pendulum, measured from the vertical as shown in FIGURE 3.11.3, is considered 
positive when measured to the right of OP and negative to the left of OP. Now recall that the arc s of a 
circle of radius l is related to the central angle u by the formula s  lu. Hence angular acceleration is
 
a  d
 2s

 2  l d
 2u

From Newton’s second law we then have
 
F  ma  ml d

 2 .
From Figure 3.11.3 we see that the magnitude of the tangential component of the force due to 
the weight W is mg sin u. In direction this force is mg sin u, since it points to the left for u  0 
and to the right for u  0. We equate the two different versions of the tangential force to obtain 
ml d 2u/dt 2  mg sin u or
 
d 2u
dt2  g
l  sin  u  0. 
(6)
 Linearization Because of the presence of sin u, the model in (6) is nonlinear. In an at-
tempt to understand the behavior of the solutions of nonlinear higher-order differential equations, 
one sometimes tries to simplify the problem by replacing nonlinear terms by certain approxima-
tions. For example, the Maclaurin series for sin u is given by
 
 sin u  u 2 u3
3!  u5
5! 2 p,
and so if we use the approximation sin u  u  u3/6, equation (6) becomes d 2u/dt 2  (g/l)u  
(g/6l)u3  0. Observe that this last equation is the same as the second nonlinear equation in (2) 
with m  1, k  g/l, and k1  g/6l. However, if we assume that the displacements u are small 
enough to justify using the replacement sin u  u, then (6)  becomes
 
d 2u
dt2  g
l  u  0. 
(7)
See Problem 24 in Exercises 3.11. If we set v2  g/l, we recognize (7) as the differential equation 
(2) of Section 3.8 that is a model for the free undamped vibrations of a linear spring/mass system. 
In other words, (7) is again the basic linear equation y  ly  0 discussed on pages 170–171 
of Section 3.9. As a consequence, we say that equation (7) is a linearization of equation (6). 
Since the general solution of (7) is u(t)  c1 cos vt  c2 sin vt, this linearization suggests that 
for initial conditions amenable to small oscillations the motion of the pendulum described by 
(6) will be periodic.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
EXAMPLE 2 
Two Initial-Value Problems
The graphs in FIGURE 3.11.4(a) were obtained with the aid of a numerical solver and represent 
solution curves of equation (6) when v2  1. The blue curve depicts the solution of (6) that 
satisfies the initial conditions u(0)  1
2, u(0)  1
2 whereas the red curve is the solution of (6) 
that satisfies u(0)  1
2, u(0)  2. The blue curve represents a periodic solution—the pendulum 
oscillating back and forth as shown in Figure 3.11.4(b) with an apparent amplitude A 	 1. The 
red curve shows that u increases without bound as time increases—the pendulum, starting from 
the same initial displacement, is given an initial velocity of magnitude great enough to send it 
over the top; in other words, the pendulum is whirling about its pivot as shown in Figure 3.11.4(c). 
In the absence of damping the motion in each case is continued indefinitely.

 Telephone Wires The first-order differential equation

is equation (16) of Section 1.3. This differential equation, established with the aid of Figure 1.3.9 
on page 24, serves as a mathematical model for the shape of a flexible cable suspended between 
two vertical supports when the cable is carrying a vertical load. In Exercises 2.2, you may have 
solved this simple DE under the assumption that the vertical load carried by the cables of a sus-
pension bridge was the weight of a horizontal roadbed distributed evenly along the x-axis. With 
W  rw, r the weight per unit length of the roadbed, the shape of each cable between the verti-
cal supports turned out to be parabolic. We are now in a position to determine the shape of a 
uniform flexible cable hanging under its own weight, such as a wire strung between two telephone 
posts. The vertical load is now the wire itself, and so if r is the linear density of the wire (mea-
sured, say, in lb/ft) and s is the length of the segment P1P2 in Figure 1.3.9, then W  rs. Hence,

In the example that follows, we solve (11) and show that the curve assumed by the suspended 
cable is a catenary. Before proceeding, observe that the nonlinear second-order differential 
equation (11) is one of those equations having the form F(x, y, y)  0 discussed in Section 3.7. 
Recall, we have a chance of solving an equation of this type by reducing the order of the equation 
by means of the substitution u  y.
EXAMPLE 3 
An Initial-Value Problem
From the position of the y-axis in Figure 1.3.9 it is apparent that initial conditions associated 
with the second differential equation in (11) are y(0)  a and y(0)  0. If we substitute u  y, 
the last equation in (11) becomes du

T1
"1  u2. Separating variables,
 
#
du
"1  u2  r
T1#dx  gives   sinh 1u  r
T1
x  c1.
Now, y(0)  0 is equivalent to u(0)  0. Since sinh1 0  0, we find c1  0 and so 
u  sinh (rx/T1). Finally, by integrating both sides of
 
dy
dx 
 sinh  r
T1
x  we get  y  T1
r  cosh  r
T1
x  c2.
Using y(0)  a, cosh 0  1, the last equation implies that c2  a  T1/r. Thus we see that the 
shape of the hanging wire is given by y  (T1/r) cosh(rx/T1)  a  T1/r. 
In Example 3, had we been clever enough at the start to choose a  T1/r, then the solution of 
the problem would have been simply the hyperbolic cosine y  (T1/r) cosh (rx/T1).
 Rocket Motion In Section 1.3 we saw that the differential equation of a free-falling body 
of mass m near the surface of the Earth is given by
 
m d  2s
dt 2  mg  or simply  d  2s
dt 2  g,
where s represents the distance from the surface of the Earth to the object and the positive direc-
tion is considered to be upward. In other words, the underlying assumption here is that the distance 
s to the object is small when compared with the radius R of the Earth; put yet another way, the 
distance y from the center of the Earth to the object is approximately the same as R. If, on the 
other hand, the distance y to an object, such as a rocket or a space probe, is large compared to R, 
then we combine Newton’s second law of motion and his universal law of gravitation to derive 
a differential equation in the variable y.
Suppose a rocket is launched vertically upward from the ground as shown in FIGURE 3.11.5. If 
the positive direction is upward and air resistance is ignored, then the differential equation of 
motion after fuel burnout is
 
m d 2y
dt 2  k Mm
y2   or  d 2y
dt 2  k M
y2, 
(12)
where k is a constant of proportionality, y is the distance from the center of the Earth to the 
rocket, M is the mass of the Earth, and m is the mass of the rocket. To determine the constant 
k, we use the fact that when y  R, kMm/R2  mg or k  gR2/M. Thus the last equation in 
(12) becomes
 
d
 2y
dt
 2  g R2
y2. 
(13)
See Problem 14 in Exercises 3.11.
 Variable Mass Notice in the preceding discussion that we described the motion of the 
rocket after it has burned all its fuel, when presumably its mass m is constant. Of course during 
its powered ascent, the total mass of the rocket varies as its fuel is being expended. The second 
law of motion, as originally advanced by Newton, states that when a body of mass m moves

through a force field with velocity v, the time rate of change of the momentum mv of the body 
is equal to applied or net force F acting on the body:
 F  d

(14)
See Problems 21 and 22 in Exercise 1.3. If m is constant, then (14) yields the more familiar form 
F  m dv/dt  ma, where a is acceleration. We use the form of Newton’s second law given in 
(14) in the next example, in which the mass m of the body is variable.
EXAMPLE 4 
Rope Pulled Upward by a Constant Force
A uniform 10-foot-long heavy rope is coiled loosely on the ground. One end of the rope is 
pulled vertically upward by means of a constant force of 5 lb. The rope weighs 1 lb per foot. 
Determine the height x(t) of the end above ground level at time t. See FIGURE 1.R.2 and Problem 43 
in Chapter 1 in Review.
SOLUTION  Let us suppose that x  x(t) denotes the height of the end of the rope in the air 
at time t, v  dx/dt, and that the positive direction is upward. For that portion of the rope in 
the air at time t we have the following variable quantities:
weight: W  (x ft) 
 (1 lb/ft)  x,
mass: m  W/g  x/32,
net force: F  5  W  5  x.
Thus from (14) we have

The nonlinear second-order differential equation (16) has the form F(x, x, x)  0, which is 
the second of the two forms considered in Section 3.7 that can possibly be solved by reduction 
of order. In order to solve (16), we revert back to (15) and use v  x along with the Chain

form M(x, v) dx  N(x, v) dv  0, we observe that the nonexact equation
 
(v2  32x  160) dx  xv dv  0 
(18)
can be transformed into an exact equation by multiplying it by an integrating factor.* When 
(18) is multiplied by µ(x)  x, the resulting equation is exact (verify). If we identify 0f/0x 

 19. Pursuit Curve In a naval exercise, a ship S1 is pursued by a 
submarine S2, as shown in FIGURE 3.11.8. Ship S1 departs 
point (0, 0) at t  0 and proceeds along a straight-line 
course (the y-axis) at a constant speed v1. The submarine 
S2 keeps ship S1 in visual contact, indicated by the straight 
dashed line L in the figure, while traveling at a constant 
speed v2 along a curve C. Assume that S2 starts at the point 
(a, 0), a  0, at t  0 and that L is tangent to C. Determine 
a mathematical model that describes the curve C. Find an 
explicit solution of the differential equation. For conve-

 20. Pursuit Curve  In another naval exercise, a destroyer S1 pur-
sues a submerged submarine S2. Suppose that S1 at (9, 0) on 
the x-axis detects S2 at (0, 0) and that S2 simultaneously detects 
S1. The captain of the destroyer S1 assumes that the submarine 
will take immediate evasive action and conjectures that its 
likely new course is the straight line indicated in FIGURE 3.11.9. 
When S1 is at (3, 0) it changes from its straight-line course 
toward the origin to a pursuit curve C. Assume that the speed 
of the destroyer is, at all times, a constant 30 mi/h and the 
submarine’s speed is a constant 15 mi/h.

system. Use the values g  32 ft/s2 and R  4000 mi to

this problem and your answer to part (a) of Problem 15.

the pendulum is released from rest at a small displacement

 25. Consider a pendulum that is released from rest from an 
 initial displacement of u0 radians. Solving the linear model (7) 
subject to the initial conditions u(0)  u0, u(0)  0 gives 
u(t)  u0 cos !g/lt. The period of oscillations predicted by this 
model is given by the  familiar formula T  2p/!g/l  2p"l/g. 
The interesting thing about this formula for T is that it does 

196 
| CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
not depend on the magnitude of the initial displacement u0. In 
other words, the linear model predicts that the time that it would 
take the pendulum to swing from an initial displacement of, 
say, u0  p/2 ( 90) to p/2 and back again would be exactly 
the same time to cycle from, say, u0  p/360 ( 0.5) to 
p/360. This is intuitively unreasonable; the actual period must 
depend on u0.
 
    If we assume that g  32 ft/s2 and l  32 ft, then the period 
of oscillation of the linear model is T  2p s. Let us compare 
this last number with the period predicted by the nonlinear 
model when u0  p/4. Using a numerical solver that is ca-
pable of generating hard data, approximate the solution of

pendulum reaches the position OP in Figure 3.11.3, then the 
period of the nonlinear pendulum is 4t1. Here is another way 
of solving the equation u(t)  0. Experiment with small step 
sizes and advance the time starting at t  0 and ending at t  2. 
From your hard data, observe the time t1 when u(t) changes, 
for the first time, from positive to negative. Use the value t1 
to determine the true value of the period of the nonlinear 
pendulum. Compute the percentage relative error in the period 
estimated by T  2p.
3.12 Solving Systems of Linear Equations
INTRODUCTION We conclude this chapter as we did in Chapter 2 with systems of differential 
equations. But unlike Section 2.9, we will actually solve systems in the discussion that follows.
 Coupled Systems/Coupled DEs In Section 2.9 we briefly examined some mathemat-
ical models that were systems of linear and nonlinear first-order ODEs. In Section 3.8 we saw 
that the mathematical model describing the displacement of a mass on a single spring, current in 
a series circuit, and charge on a capacitor in a series circuit consisted of a single differential 
equation. When physical systems are coupled—for example, when two or more mixing tanks are 
connected, when two or more spring/mass systems are attached, or when circuits are joined to 
form a network—the mathematical model of the system usually consists of a set of coupled dif-
ferential equations, in other words, a system of differential equations.
We did not attempt to solve any of the systems considered in Section 2.9. The same remarks 
made in Sections 3.7 and 3.11 pertain as well to systems of nonlinear ODEs; that is, it is nearly 
impossible to solve such systems analytically. However, linear systems with constant coefficients 
can be solved. The method that we shall examine in this section for solving linear systems with 
constant coefficients simply uncouples the system into distinct linear ODEs in each dependent 
variable. Thus, this section gives you an opportunity to practice what you learned earlier in 
the chapter.
Before proceeding, let us continue in the same vein as Section 3.8 by considering a spring/
mass system, but this time we derive a mathematical model that describes the vertical displace-
ments of two masses in a coupled spring/mass system.
 Coupled Spring/Mass System Suppose two masses m1 and m2 are connected to 
two springs A and B of negligible mass having spring constants k1 and k2, respectively. As 
shown in FIGURE 3.12.1(a), spring A is attached to a rigid support and spring B is attached to the 
bottom of mass m1. Let x1(t) and x2(t) denote the vertical displacements of the masses from 
their equilibrium positions. When the system is in motion, Figure 3.12.1(b), spring B is subject 
to both an elongation and a compression; hence its net elongation is x2  x1. Therefore it fol-
lows from Hooke’s law that springs A and B exert forces k1x1 and k2(x2  x1), respectively, 
on m1. If no damping is present and no external force is impressed on the system, then the net 
force on m1 is k1x1  k2(x2  x1). By Newton’s second law we can write
 
m1 d
 2x1

 2  k1x1  k2(x2 2 x1).

Similarly, the net force exerted on mass m2 is due solely to the net elongation of spring B, that 
is, k2(x2  x1). Hence we have
 
m2 d

dt
 2  k2(x2 2 x1).
In other words, the motion of the coupled system is represented by the system of linear second-
order equations
 
 m1x10  k1x1  k2(x2 2 x1)
 
 m2x20  k2(x2 2 x1). 
(1)
After we have illustrated the main idea of this section, we will return to system (1).
 Systematic Elimination The method of systematic elimination for solving systems 
of linear equations with constant coefficients is based on the algebraic principle of elimination 
of variables. The analogue of multiplying an algebraic equation by a constant is operating on an 
ODE with some combination of derivatives. The elimination process is expedited by rewriting 
each equation in a system using differential operator notation. Recall from Section 3.1 that a 
single linear equation
 
an y(n)  an1y(n1)  …  a1y  a0y  g(t),
where the coefficients a i, i  0, 1, . . . , n are constants, can be written as
 
(anDn  an1Dn1  …  a1D  a0)y  g(t).
If an nth-order differential operator anDn  an1Dn1  . . .   a1D  a0 factors into differential 
operators of lower order, then the factors commute. Now, for example, to rewrite the system
 
x  2x  y  x  3y  sin t
 
x  y  4x  2y  et
in terms of the operator D, we first bring all terms involving the dependent variables to one side 
and group the same variables:
 
x  2x  x  y  3y  sin t      (D2  2D  1)x  (D2  3)y  sin t
 
x  4x  y  2y  et  
so that
       (D  4)x  (D  2)y  et.
 Solution of a System A solution of a system of differential equations is a set of suf-
ficiently differentiable functions x  f1(t), y  f2(t), z  f3(t), and so on, that satisfies each 
equation in the system on some common interval I.
 Method of Solution Consider the simple system of linear first-order equations
 
dx
dt  3y
dy
dt  2x
   or, equivalently,   Dx 2 3y  0
2x 2 Dy  0. 
(2)
Operating on the first equation in (2) by D while multiplying the second by 3 and then adding 
eliminates y from the system and gives D2x  6x  0. Since the roots of the auxiliary equation 
of the last DE are m1  !6 and m2   !6, we obtain
 
x(t)  c1e"6t  c2e"6t. 
(3)

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
Multiplying the first equation in (2) by 2 while operating on the second by D and then subtracting 
gives the differential equation for y, D2y  6y  0. It follows immediately that
 
y(t)  c3e"6t  c4e"6t. 
(4)
Now, (3) and (4) do not satisfy the system (2) for every choice of c1, c2, c3, and c4 because the 
system itself puts a constraint on the number of parameters in a solution that can be chosen ar-
bitrarily. To see this, observe that after substituting x(t) and y(t) into the first equation of the 
original system, (2) gives, after simplification,
 
("6c1 2 3c3)e"6t  ("6c2 2 3c4)e"6t  0.
Since the latter expression is to be zero for all values of t, we must have  !6c1  3c3  0 and 
!6c2  3c4  0. Thus we can write c3 and a multiple of c1 and c4 as a multiple of c2:
 
c3  "6
3  c1 and c4  "6
3  c2. 
(5)
Hence we conclude that a solution of the system must be
 
x(t)  c1e"6t  c2e"6t, y(t)  "6
3  c1e"6t  "6
3  c2e"6t.
You are urged to substitute (3) and (4) into the second equation of (2) and verify that the same 
relationship (5) holds between the constants.
EXAMPLE 1 
Solution by Elimination
Solve 
Dx  (D  2)y  0
 
(D  3)x   
2y  0. 
(6)
SOLUTION  Operating on the first equation by D  3 and on the second by D and then sub-
tracting eliminates x from the system. It follows that the differential equation for y is
 
[(D  3)(D  2)  2D]y  0  or  (D2  D  6)y  0.
Since the characteristic equation of this last differential equation is m2  m  6  
(m  2)(m  3)  0, we obtain the solution
 
y(t)  c1e2t  c2e3t. 
(7)
Eliminating y in a similar manner yields (D2  D  6)x  0, from which we find
 
x(t)  c3e2t  c4e3t. 
(8)
As we noted in the foregoing discussion, a solution of (6) does not contain four independent 
constants. Substituting (7) and (8) into the first equation of (6) gives
 
(4c1  2c3)e2t  (c2  3c4)e3t  0.
From 4c1  2c3  0 and c2  3c4  0 we get c3  2c1 and c4  1
3c2. Accordingly, a 
solution of the system is
 
x(t)  2c1e2t  1
3c2e3t,  y(t)  c1e2t  c2e3t. 
This is important.

Since we could just as easily solve for c3 and c4 in terms of c1 and c2, the solution in Example 1 
can be written in the alternative form
 
x(t)  c3e2t  c4e3t,  y(t)  1
2c3e2t  3c4e3t.
It sometimes pays to keep one’s eyes open when solving systems. Had we solved for x first, then y 
could be found, along with the relationship between the constants, by using the last equation in 
(6). You should verify that substituting x(t) into y  1
2(Dx  3x) yields y   1
2c3e2t  3c4e3t.
EXAMPLE 2 
Solution by Elimination
Solve 
x  4x  y  t 2
 
x  x  y  0. 
(9)
SOLUTION  First we write the system in differential operator notation:
 
(D  4)x  D2y  t 2
 
(D  1)x  Dy  0. 
(10)
Then, by eliminating x, we obtain
 
[(D  1)D2  (D  4)D]y  (D  1)t 2  (D  4)0
or 
(D3  4D)y  t 2  2t.
Since the roots of the auxiliary equation m(m2  4)  0 are m1  0, m2  2i, and m3  2i, 
the complementary function is
 
yc  c1  c2 cos 2t  c3 sin 2t.
To determine the particular solution yp we use undetermined coefficients by assuming 
yp  At 3  Bt 2  Ct. Therefore
 
yp  3At 2  2Bt  C,   yp  6At  2B,   yp  6A,
 
yp  4yp  12At 2  8Bt  6A  4C  t 2  2t.
The last equality implies 12A  1, 8B  2, 6A  4C  0, and hence A  1
12, B  1
4, C  1
8. 
Thus
 
y  yc  yp  c1  c2 cos 2t  c3 sin 2t  1
12 t 3  1
4 t 2  1
8 t. 
(11)
Eliminating y from the system (9) leads to
 
[(D  4)  D(D  1)]x  t 2  or  (D2  4)x  t 2.
It should be obvious that
 
xc  c4 cos 2t  c5 sin 2t
and that undetermined coefficients can be applied to obtain a particular solution of the form 
xp  At 2  Bt  C. In this case the usual differentiations and algebra yield xp  1
4t 2  1
8, 
and so
 
x  xc  xp  c4 cos 2t  c5 sin 2t  1
4t 2  1
8. 
(12)
Watch for a shortcut.

CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
Now c4 and c5 can be expressed in terms of c2 and c3 by substituting (11) and (12) into either 
equation of (9). By using the second equation, we find, after combining terms,
 
(c5  2c4  2c2) sin 2t  (2c5  c4  2c3) cos 2t  0
so that c5  2c4  2c2  0 and 2c5  c4  2c3  0. Solving for c4 and c5 in terms of c2 and c3

EXAMPLE 3 
A Mathematical Model Revisited
In (3) of Section 2.9 we saw that a system of linear first-order differential equations described 
the number of pounds of salt x1(t) and x2(t) of a brine mixture that flows between two tanks. 
See Figure 2.9.1. At that time we were not able to solve the system. But now, in terms of dif-
ferential operators, the system is
aD  2
25b x1 2  
1
50 x2  0
2 2
25 x1  aD  2
25b x2  0.
Operating on the first equation by D  2
25, multiplying the second equation by 1
50, adding, and 
then simplifying, gives
 
(625D2  100D  3)x1  0.
From the auxiliary equation 625m2  100m  3  (25m  1)(25m  3)  0 we see 
immediately that
 
x1(t)  c1et/25  c2e3t/25.
In like manner we find (625D2  100D  3)x2  0 and so
 
x2(t)  c3et/25  c4e3t/25.
Substituting x1(t) and x2(t) into, say, the first equation of the system then gives
 
(2c1  c3)et/25  (2c2  c4)e3t/25  0.
From this last equation we find c3  2c1 and c4  2c2. Thus a solution of the system is
 
x1(t)  c1et/25  c2e3t/25,   x2(t)  2c1et/25  2c2e3t/25.
In the original discussion we assumed that initial conditions were x1(0)  25 and x2(0)  0. 
Applying these conditions to the solution yields c1  c2  25 and 2c1  2c2  0. Solving 
these equations simultaneously gives c1  c2  25
2 . Finally, a solution of the initial-value 
problem is
 
x1(t)  25
2 et/25  25
2 e3t/25,   x2(t)  25et/25  25e3t/25. 
The graphs of x1(t) and x2(t) are given in FIGURE 3.12.2. Notice that even though the number of 
pounds x2(t) of salt in tank B starts initially at 0 lb it quickly increases and surpasses the 
number of pounds x1(t) of salt in tank A.

In our next example we solve system (1) under the assumption that k1  6, k2  4, m1  1, 
and m2  1.
EXAMPLE 4 
A Special Case of System (1)
Solve 
x1  10x1 
4x2  0
 
4x1  x2  4x2  0 
(13)
subject to x1(0)  0, x1(0)  1, x2(0)  0, x2(0)  1.
SOLUTION  Using elimination on the equivalent form of the system
 
(D2  10)x1 
 4x2  0
 
4x1  (D2  4)x2  0
we find that x1 and x2 satisfy, respectively,
 
(D2  2)(D2  12)x1  0  and  (D2  2)(D2  12)x2  0.
Thus we find
 
x1(t)  c1 cos !2t  c2 sin !2t  c3 cos 2 !3t  c4 sin 2 !3t
 
x2(t)  c5 cos !2t  c6 sin !2t  c7 cos 2 !3t  c8 sin 2 !3t.
Substituting both expressions into the first equation of (13) and simplifying eventually 
yields c5  2c1, c6  2c2, c7  1
2c3, c8  1
2c4. Thus, a solution of (13) is
 
x1(t)  c1 cos !2t  c2 sin !2t  c3 cos 2 !3t  c4 sin 2 !3t
 
x2(t)  2c1 cos !2t  2c2 sin !2t  1
2c3 cos 2 !3t  1
2c4 sin 2 !3t.
The stipulated initial conditions then imply c1  0, c2   "2/10, c3  0, c4  "3/5. 
And so the solution of the initial-value problem is
 
 x1(t)  "2

 sin "2t  "3

 sin 2"3t
 
(14)
 
 x2(t)  "2

The graphs of x1 and x2 in FIGURE 3.12.3 reveal the complicated oscillatory motion of 
each mass. 
We will revisit Example 4 in Section 4.6, where we will solve the system in (13) by means of 
the Laplace transform.

 25. Consider the solution x1(t) and x2(t) of the initial-value prob-
lem given at the end of Example 3. Use a CAS to graph x1(t) 
and x2(t) in the same coordinate plane on the interval 
[0, 100]. In Example 3, x1(t) denotes the number of pounds 
of salt in tank A at time t, and x2(t) the number of pounds of 
salt in tank B at time t. See Figure 2.9.1. Use a root-finding

(c) Since only pure water is pumped into tank A, it stands to 
reason that the salt will eventually be flushed out of all 
three tanks. Use a root-finding application of a CAS to 
determine the time when the amount of salt in each tank 
is less than or equal to 0.5 pounds. When will the amounts 
of salt x1(t), x2(t), and x3(t) be simultaneously less than 
or equal to 0.5 pounds?

tions of the masses m1 and m2 in this problem and that of 
the masses illustrated in Figure 3.12.3?
(c) As parametric equations, plot x1(t) and x2(t) in the 
x1x2-plane. The curve defined by these parametric equa-
tions is called a Lissajous curve.

 48. A 32-pound weight stretches a spring 6 inches. The weight moves

tance of C  104 f, and an electromotive force of E(t) 

(a) Find the equation for the charge at time t.
(b) Find the equation for the current at time t.

 Show that except for the case l  0, there are two independent 
eigenfunctions corresponding to each eigen value.
 52. Sliding Bead A bead is constrained to slide along a friction-
less rod of length L. The rod is rotating in a vertical plane 
with a constant angular velocity v about a pivot P fixed at 
the midpoint of the rod, but the design of the pivot allows 
the bead to move along the entire length of the rod. Let r(t) 
denote the position of the bead relative to this rotating co-
ordinate system, as shown in FIGURE 3.R.1. In order to apply 
Newton’s second law of motion to this rotating frame of 
reference it is necessary to use the fact that the net force 
acting on the bead is the sum of the real forces (in this case, 
the force due to gravity) and the inertial forces (coriolis, 
transverse, and centrifugal). The mathematics is a little 
complicated, so we give just the resulting differential equa-
tion for r,

(b) Determine initial conditions for which the bead exhibits 
simple harmonic motion. What is the minimum length L 
of the rod for which it can accommodate simple harmonic 
motion of the bead?
(c) For initial conditions other than those obtained in part 
(b), the bead must eventually fly off the rod. Explain us-
ing the solution r(t) in part (a).
(d) Suppose v  1 rad/s. Use a graphing utility to plot the 
graph of the solution r(t) for the initial conditions 
r(0)  0, r(0)  v0, where v0 is 0, 10, 15, 16, 16.1, 
and 17.
(e) Suppose the length of the rod is L  40 ft. For each 
pair of initial conditions in part (d), use a root-finding

 57. Ballistic Pendulum Historically, in order to maintain quality 
control over munitions (bullets) produced by an assembly 
line, the manufacturer would use a ballistic pendulum to 
determine the muzzle velocity of a gun, that is, the speed of 
a bullet as it leaves the barrel. The ballistic pendulum, in-
vented in 1742 by the British mathematician and military 
engineer Benjamin Robins (1707–1751), is simply a plane 
pendulum consisting of a rod of negligible mass to which a 
block of wood of mass mw is attached. The system is set in 
motion by the impact of a bullet that is moving horizontally 
at the unknown muzzle velocity vb; at the time of the impact, 
t  0, the combined mass is mw  mb, where mb is the mass 
of the bullet embedded in the wood. We have seen in (7) of 
Section 3.10 that in the case of small oscillations, the angu-
lar displacement u(t) of a plane pendulum shown in Figure 
3.11.3 is given by the linear DE u0  (g/l)u  0, where 
u . 0 corresponds to motion to the right of vertical. The 
velocity vb can be found by measuring the height h of the 
mass mw  mb at the maximum displacement angle umax 
shown in FIGURE 3.R.3.
 
   Intuitively, the horizontal velocity V of the combined mass 
mw  mb after impact is only a fraction of the velocity vb 
of the bullet, that is, V  a

tance s traveled by a particle moving along a circular path 
is related to the radius l and central angle u by the formula

time t, it follows that the angular velocity v of the mass 
and its linear velocity v are related by v  lv. Thus the 
initial angular velocity v0 at the time t at which the bullet 
impacts the wood block is related to V by V  lv0 or

is, it consists of separate differential equations for x(t)

can be solved simply by antidifferentiating twice. Solve 
(2) to obtain explicit formulas for x(t) and y(t) in terms 
of v0 and u. Then algebraically eliminate t to show that 
the trajectory of the projectile in the xy-plane is a 
 parabola.
(b) A central question throughout the history of ballistics 
has been this: Given a gun that fires a projectile with 
a certain initial speed v0, at what angle with respect 
to the horizontal should the gun be fired to maximize 
its range? The range is the horizontal distance tra-
versed by a projectile before it hits the ground. Show 
that according to (2), the range of the projectile is

tile if launched with u  45+ for maximum range is

 62. The Paris Guns—Continued  Mathematically, Galileo’s 
model in Problem 61 is perfect. But in practice it is only as 
accurate as the hypotheses upon which it is based. The motion 
of a real projectile is resisted to some extent by the air, and 
the stronger this effect, the less realistic are the hypotheses of 
constant horizontal velocity and constant vertical acceleration, 
as well as the resulting independence of the projectile’s motion 
in the x and y directions.
 
    The first successful model of air resistance was formulated 
by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) 
and Isaac Newton (1643–1727). It was based not so much 
on a detailed mathematical formulation of the underlying 
physics involved, which was beyond what anyone could man-
age at the time, but on physical intuition and groundbreaking 
experimental work. Newton’s version, which is known to 
this day as Newton’s law of air resistance, states that the 
Contributed Problems
 61. The Paris Guns  The first mathematically correct theory 
of projectile motion was originally formulated by Galileo 
Galilei (1564–1642), then clarified and extended by his 
younger collaborators Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598–1647) 
and Evangelista Torricelli (1608–1647). Galileo’s theory 
was based on two simple hypotheses suggested by ex-
perimental observations: that a projectile moves with 
constant horizontal velocity and with constant downward 
vertical acceleration. Galileo, Cavalieri, and Torricelli did 
not have calculus at their disposal, so their arguments 
were largely geometric, but we can reproduce their results 
using a system of differential equations. Suppose that a 
projectile is launched from ground level at an angle u with 
respect to the horizontal and with an initial velocity of 
magnitude 7  v07  v0  m/s. Let the projectile’s height above 
the ground be y meters and its horizontal distance from 
the launch site be x meters, and for convenience take the 
launch site to be the origin in the xy-plane. Then Galileo’s 
hypotheses can be represented by the following initial-
value problem:

resisting force or drag force on an object moving through a 
resisting medium acts in the direction opposite to the direc-
tion of the object’s motion with a magnitude proportional to 
the density r of the medium, the cross sectional area A of 
the object taken perpendicular to the direction of motion, 
and the square of the speed 7v7  of the object. In modern 
vector notation, the drag force is a vector fD given in terms 
of the velocity v of the object:
 
fD  1

ivi  1
2CrA7v7   v,
 
 where in the coordinate system of Problem 61 the velocity is 
the vector v  kdx/dt, dy/dtl. When the force of gravity and 
this drag force are combined according to Newton’s second 
law of motion we get:

   Huygens seemed to believe that the proportionality of 
drag force to the square of the speed was universal, but 
Newton suspected that multiple different physical effects 
contributed to drag force, not all of which behaved that 
way. He turned out to be correct. For example, when the 
speed of an object is low enough compared to the viscos-
ity (internal resistance to flow) of the medium, drag force 
ends up being approximately proportional to its speed (not 
the square of its speed), a relationship known as Stokes’ 
law of air resistance. Even today, there is no quick recipe 
for predicting the drag force for all objects under all con-
ditions. The modeling of air resistance is complicated and 
is done in practice by a combination of theoretical and 
empirical methods. The coefficient C in (3) is called the 
drag coefficient. It is dimensionless (that is, it is the same 
no matter what units are used to measure mass, distance, 
and time) and it can usually be regarded as depending only 
on the shape of a projectile and not on its size. The drag 
coefficient is such a convenient index for measuring how 
much air resistance is felt by a projectile of a given shape 
that it is now defined in terms of the drag force to be 
27fD7/(r A7v7 2) even when this ratio cannot be regarded as 
constant. For example, under Stokes’ law of air resistance, 
C would be proportional to the reciprocal of the speed. Of 
greater concern to us is the fact that the drag coefficient 
of a projectile in air  increases sharply as its speed ap-
proaches the speed of sound (approximately 340 m/s in 
air), then decreases gradually for even higher speeds, be-
coming nearly constant again for speeds several times the 
speed of sound. This was first discovered by the military 
engineer Benjamin Robins (see Problem 57), whose book 
Principles of Gunnery is generally regarded as inaugurat-
ing the modern age of artillery and of the science of bal-
listics in general. As guns were used to shoot projectiles 
further and further with greater and greater initial speeds 
throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the 
dependence of the drag coefficient on speed took on greater 
and greater practical importance. Moreover, as these pro-
jectiles went higher and higher, the fact that the density of 
the air decreases with increasing  altitude also became im-
portant. By World War I, the density of the air as a function 
of altitude y above sea level in meters was commonly mod-
eled by the function:
 
r( y)  1.225e0.00010361y
  kg/m3
 
 and military engineers were accustomed to incorporating into 
(3) the dependence of C on velocity and of r on y. But one 
last major surprise was stumbled upon by German engineers 
during World War I. Our version of this story is based on the 
book Paris Kanonen—the Paris Guns (Wilhelmgeschütze) and 
Project HARP by Gerald V. Bull (Verlag E. S. Mittler & Sohn 
GmbH, Herford, 1988).
 
   In the fall of 1914, the German Navy charged the Friedrich 
Krupp engineering firm with designing a system (gun and 
shells) capable of bombing the English port of Dover from 
the French coast. This would require firing a shell approx-
imately 37 kilometers, a range some 16 kilometers greater 
than had ever been achieved before.  Krupp was ready for 
this challenge because it had already succeeded in design-
ing and building shells with innovative shapes that had 
lower drag coefficients than any prewar shells. The drag 
coefficient for one of these shells can be well approximated 
by the following piecewise linear function, where the speed 
v is in m/s:
  
C(v)  μ
0.2,
0 , v , 306
0.2  (v 2 306)/340,
306 # v , 374,
0.4 2 (v 2 374)/3230,
374 # v , 1020
0.2,
v . 1020.
 
   In addition, Krupp’s engineers already had built an ex-
perimental gun having a 35.5 cm diameter barrel that could 
fire 535 kg shells with an initial speed of 940 m/s. They 
calculated that if they built one of their new low-drag shells 
with that diameter and mass and used this gun to launch it 
at a 43+ angle to the horizontal, the shell should have a 
range of about 39 km. The shell was built, and a test firing 
was conducted on October 21, 1914. For the results, we 
quote a first-hand account by Professor Fritz Rausenberger, 
 
CHAPTER 3 in Review

| CHAPTER 3 Higher-Order Differential Equations
managing director of the Krupp firm at the time (from pages 
24–25 in Bull’s book):
“After the firing of the first shot, with a top zone propel-
ling charge and at 43+ elevation, we all waited with 
anxiety for the spotting report to be telephoned back to 
us giving the location of the inert shell impact. The 
anxiety was that normally associated when trying to 
reach a range never before achieved. But the spotter’s 
report on impact never came. None of the observers 
located along the full length of the range had observed 
impact p.
  Since no observation posts had been established 
beyond the 40 km mark, any impact outside of the 
area would have to be located and reported by local 
inhabitants using normal telephone communication 
between the neighbouring farms and villages. Thus 
it took several hours before the range staff received 
notification that the shell had impacted in a garden 
(without causing damage) some 49 km down-range 
from the battery. This was an unexpectedly favorable 
result but raised the question of how the range in-
crease of  25% over that predicted using standard 
exterior ballistic techniques occurred p. After care-
ful study of the method of calculating range, it was 
clear that in the computations an average, constant 
air density was used which was larger than the aver-
age along the trajectory. The method of calculating 
trajectory was therefore changed to allow for varia-
tion of density along the trajectory. This was done by 
dividing the atmosphere into 3 km bands from the 
Earth’s surface upwards. For each band an average 
air density value was determined and applied over 
that portion of the trajectory falling in this band. This 
step-by-step calculation technique was carried out 
from the muzzle until impact. The resultant calculated 
trajectory, using the drag coefficient as determined 
from small calibre firings, matched closely the ex-
perimental results from the 21st of October Meppen 
firing.”
 
   Note that Rausenberger does not tell us what “average, 
constant” air density was used in the faulty calculation, or 
how it was determined. Actually, there is a logical problem 
here in that it is not possible to know how low the air den-
sity will become along the path of a trajectory without 
already knowing how high the trajectory will go. 
Nevertheless the engineers were confident of their calcula-
tions, so it seems likely that they did not regard the air 
density as a critical parameter when their concern was only 
to find an approximate range. (After all, they had never 
shot anything so high before.)
(a) Use a computer algebra system to write a routine that can 
numerically solve (3) with the piecewise defined C and 
exponentially decaying r given above and graph the re-
sulting trajectory in the xy-plane. (You may need to 
 rewrite (3) as a first-order system. See Section 6.4.) The 
area A is that of a circle with the diameter of the shell. 
Test your routine on the case r  0, which was solved 
analytically in Problem 61.
(b) Suppose that, as Krupp engineers, we use the results of 
part (c) in Problem 61 to calculate the maximum height 
M that would have been attained by the test shell had it 
been launched in a vacuum (r  0), then figure that the 
real test shell might reach about half that height, and 
finally settle on a “constant, average” value for r of 
(r(M/2)  r(0))/2. Plot the resulting trajectory, and show 
that the resulting range is uncannily close to that 
 predicted by the Krupp engineers for the October 14, 
1914, test.  
(c) Note that the launch angle for this test was not the 45+ 
angle that yields maximum range in a vacuum, but a 
smaller 43+ angle. Does this smaller launch angle lead 
to greater range under the constant air density assump-
tion that you used in part (b)? To the nearest degree, 
what launch angle yields maximum range according to 
this model?
(d) Now plot the trajectory of the test shell using the proper 
exponentially decaying r. What happens? (In evaluat-
ing the results, it should make you feel better that we 
are not pretending to take everything into account in 
this model. For example, a missile moving at an angle 
relative to its axis of symmetry can experience a sub-
stantial lift force of the same sort that makes airplanes 
fly. Our model does not account for the possibility of 
lift, the curvature and rotation of the Earth, or numer-
ous other effects.)
 
   Rausenberger notes that once his engineers realized how 
 important the exponentially decaying r was in calculating 
range, they did a series of calculations and found that the 
maximum range for their test would actually have been 
achieved with a launch angle of 50+ to 55+. In hindsight, they 
realized that this was because a larger launch angle would 
result in the shell traveling higher and therefore in less 
dense air.
(e) Check this by plotting the trajectory of the test shell with 
exponentially decaying r every two degrees from 43+ to 
55+. What do you find?
 
   After these surprising results, engineers at Krupp became 
interested in the challenge of attaining even larger ranges. 
The only way they could think of to talk the German High 
Command into committing to the trouble and expense of 
pursuing this goal was to sell them on the possibility of 

bombing Paris from behind the German front line, which 
would require a range of some 120 km. The German High 
Command quickly approved this idea, and after several 
years of work Krupp produced what are now known as the 
Paris Guns. These guns were designed to launch a 106 kg 
shell having a diameter of 216 mm with an initial velocity 
of 1646 m/s. At a 50+ launch angle, such a shell was pre-
dicted to travel over 120 km.

(f ) Simulate the trajectory of a shell from a Paris Gun using 
(2) with exponentially decaying r. Evaluate the results 
keeping in mind the caveats about our modeling noted in 
part (d). How high does the shell go?  Now change the 
launch angle from 50+ to 45+. What happens?
 
   Seven Paris Guns were built, but only three were used. 
They fired a total of 351 shells towards Paris between March 
23 and August 9 of 1918. The damage and casualties that 
they caused were not tactically significant. They were never 
intended to be so; there was no control over where the shells 
would fall in Paris, and the amount of explosive carried by 
each shell was quite small. Instead, they were intended as a 
form of intimidation, a “scare tactic.” However, military 
historians agree that they were not effective in that sense 
either. Their significance turned out to be more scientific 
than military. The shells that they launched were the first 
man-made objects to reach the stratosphere, initiating the 
space age in the science of ballistics.

In the linear mathematical

as a spring/mass system or a

or driving function represents 
either an external force f(t) or an 
impressed voltage E(t). In 
Section 3.8 we considered 
problems in which f and E were 
continuous. However, 
discontinuous driving functions 
are not uncommon. Although we 
have solved piecewise-linear 
differential equations using the 
techniques of Chapters 2 and 3, 
the Laplace transform discussed

4.1 
Definition of the Laplace Transform
INTRODUCTION In elementary calculus you learned that differentiation and integration are 
transforms—this means, roughly speaking, that these operations transform a function into another 
function. For example, the function f (x)  x2 is transformed, in turn, into a linear function, a 
family of cubic polynomial functions, and a constant by the operations of differentiation, 
indefinite integration, and definite integration:
 
d
dx
 x2  2x, #x2 dx  1
3 x3  c, #
3
0
x2 dx  9.
Moreover, these two transforms possess the linearity property; this means the transform 
of a linear combination of functions is a linear combination of the transforms. For a and b 
constants,
 
 d
dx fa f (x)  b g(x)g  a f 9(x)  b g9(x)

provided each derivative and integral exists. In this section we will examine a special type of 
integral transform called the Laplace transform. In addition to possessing the linearity property, 
the Laplace transform has many other interesting properties that make it very useful in solving 
linear initial-value problems.
If f (x, y) is a function of two variables, then a partial definite integral of f with respect to 
one of the variables leads to a function of the other variable. For example, by holding y con-
stant we see that e2
1 2xy2 dx  3y2. Similarly, a definite integral such as eb
a K(s, t) f (t) dt 
transforms a function f (t) into a function of the variable s. We are particularly interested in 
integral transforms of this last kind, where the interval of integration is the unbounded 
 interval [0, q).
 Basic Definition If f (t) is defined for t  0, then the improper integral eq
0  K(s, t) f (t) dt 
is defined as a limit:
 
#
q
0
K(s, t) f (t) dt  lim
bSq
 #
b
0
K(s, t) f (t) dt. 
(1)
If the limit exists, the integral is said to exist or to be convergent; if the limit does not exist, the 
integral does not exist and is said to be divergent. The foregoing limit will, in general, exist for 
only certain values of the variable s. The choice K(s, t)  est gives us an especially important 
integral transform.
We will assume throughout 
that s is a real variable.

Let f be a function defined for t  0. Then the integral

The Laplace transform most likely was invented by Leonhard Euler, but is named after the 
famous French astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Marquis de Laplace (1749–1827) 
who used the transform in his investigations of probability theory.
When the defining integral (2) converges, the result is a function of s. In general discussion, if 
we use a lowercase (uppercase) letter to denote the function being transformed, then the correspond-
ing uppercase (lowercase) letter will be used to denote its Laplace transform, for example,
 
l{ f (t)}  F (s), l{g(t)}  G(s), l{y(t)}  Y(s), and 
+5H(t)6  h(s).

(3)
Because of the property given in (3), + is said to be a linear transform. Furthermore, by the 
properties of the definite integral, the transform of any finite linear combination of functions f1(t), 
f2(t), . . . , fn(t) is the sum of the transforms provided each transform exists on some common 
interval on the s-axis.
EXAMPLE 5 
Linearity of the Laplace Transform
In this example we use the results of the preceding examples to illustrate the linearity of the 
Laplace transform.
(a) From Examples 1 and 2 we know that both +{1} and +{t} exist on the interval defined 
by s  0. Hence, for s  0 we can write

(b) From Example 3 we saw that +{e6t} exists on the interval defined by s  6, and in 
Example 4 we saw that +{sin 2t} exists on the interval defined by s  0. Thus both transforms 
exist for the common values of s defined by s  6, and we can write

We state the generalization of some of the preceding examples by means of the next theo-

that s is sufficiently restricted to guarantee the convergence of the appropriate Laplace 
transform.

 Sufficient Conditions for Existence of + { f (t )} The integral that defines the 
Laplace transform does not have to converge. For example, neither +{1/t} nor +{et2} exists. 
Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of +{ f (t)} are that f be piecewise continuous 
on [0, q) and that f be of exponential order for t  T. Recall that a function f is piecewise con-
tinuous on [0, q) if, in any interval defined by 0  a  t  b, there are at most a finite number 
of points tk, k  1, 2, … , n (tk  1  tk), at which f has finite discontinuities and is continuous on 
each open interval defined by tk  1  t  tk. See FIGURE 4.1.1. The concept of exponential order 
is defined in the following manner.
If f is an increasing function, then the condition | f (t)|  Mect, t  T, simply states that the 
graph of f on the interval (T, q) does not grow faster than the graph of the exponential function 
Mect, where c is a positive constant. See FIGURE 4.1.2. The functions f (t)  t, f (t)  et, and 
f (t)  2 cos t are all of exponential order c  1 for t  0 since we have, respectively,
 
| t |  et,  | et |  et,  | 2 cos t |  2et.
A comparison of the graphs on the interval [0, q) is given in FIGURE 4.1.3.
A positive integral power of t is always of exponential order since, for c  0,

Definition 4.1.2 
Exponential Order
A function f is said to be of exponential order if there exist constants c, M  0, and T  0

CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
is equivalent to showing that limtSq tn/ect is finite for n  1, 2, 3, . . . . The result follows by 
n applications of L’Hôpital’s rule. A function such as f (t)  et 2 is not of exponential order since, 
as shown in FIGURE 4.1.4, et 2 grows faster than any positive linear power of e for t  c  0. This 
can also be seen from
 
`  et 2

integral eq

Theorem 4.1.2 
Sufficient Conditions for Existence
If f (t) is piecewise continuous on the interval [0, q) and of exponential order, then +{ f (t)} 
exists for s  c.
PROOF: By the additive interval property of definite integrals,
 
+5 f (t)6  #
T
0
estf (t) dt  #
q
T
estf (t) dt  I1  I2.
The integral I1 exists because it can be written as a sum of integrals over intervals on which estf (t) 
is continuous. Now f is of exponential order, so there exists constants c, M  0, T  0 so that 
| f (t)|  Mect for t  T. We can then write
 
|I2| # #

Zestf (t)Z dt # M#
q
T
estect dt  M#
q
T
e(s2c)t dt  M e(s2c)T
s 2 c
for s  c. Since eq
T Me(s  c)t dt converges, the integral eq
T  |estf (t)| dt converges by the comparison 
test for improper integrals. This, in turn, implies that I2 exists for s  c. The existence of I1 and 
I2 implies that +{ f (t)}  eq
0  estf (t) dt exists for s  c.

REMARKS
Throughout this chapter we shall be concerned primarily with functions that are both piecewise 
continuous and of exponential order. We note, however, that these two conditions are sufficient 
but not necessary for the existence of a Laplace transform. The function f (t)  t1/2 is not 
piecewise continuous on the interval [0, q); nevertheless its Laplace transform exists. See 
Problem 43 in Exercises 4.1.

4.2 The Inverse Transform and Transforms of Derivatives
INTRODUCTION In this section we take a few small steps into an investigation of how the 
Laplace transform can be used to solve certain types of equations. After we discuss the concept of 
the inverse Laplace transform and examine the transforms of derivatives we then use the Laplace 
transform to solve some simple ordinary differential equations.
4.2.1 Inverse Transforms
 The Inverse Problem If F (s) represents the Laplace transform of a function f (t), 
that is, +{ f (t)}  F (s), we then say f (t) is the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) and write 
f (t)  +1{F (s)}. For example, from Examples 1, 2, and 3 in Section 4.1 we have, respectively,
1  +1 e 1
s f ,  t  +1 e 1
s2 f ,  and  e3t  +1 e
1
s  3 f .
The analogue of Theorem 4.1.1 for the inverse transform is presented next.
Theorem 4.2.1

When evaluating inverse transforms, it often happens that a function of s under consideration 
does not match exactly the form of a Laplace transform F(s) given in a table. It may be necessary 
to “fix up” the function of s by multiplying and dividing by an appropriate constant.

Applying Theorem 4.2.1
Evaluate (a)  +1 e 1

(b)  +1 e

Partial Fractions and Linearity
Evaluate +1 e

(s 2 1)(s 2 2)(s  4)
.
Since the denominators are identical, the numerators are identical:
 
s2  6s  9  A(s 2 2)(s  4)  B(s 2 1)(s  4)  C(s 2 1)(s 2 2). 
(3)
By comparing coefficients of powers of s on both sides of the equality, we know that (3) is 
equivalent to a system of three equations in the three unknowns A, B, and C. However, recall 
that there is a shortcut for determining these unknowns. If we set s  1, s  2, and s  4 
(b) To match the form given in part (d) of Theorem 4.2.1, we identify k 2  7 and so k  !7. 
We fix up the expression by multiplying and dividing by !7:

 +1 Is a Linear Transform The inverse Laplace transform is also a linear transform; 
that is, for constants a and b,
 
1{a F (s)  b G(s)}  a 1{F (s)}  b 1{G(s)},

where F and G are the transforms of some functions f and g. Like (3) of Section 4.1, (1) extends 
to any finite linear combination of Laplace transforms.

 Partial Fractions Partial fractions play an important role in finding inverse Laplace 
transforms. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the decomposition of a rational expression into com-
ponent fractions can be done quickly by means of a single command on most computer algebra 
systems. Indeed, some CASs have packages that implement Laplace transform and inverse 
Laplace transform commands. But for those of you without access to such software, we will 
review in this and subsequent sections some of the basic algebra in the important cases in which 
the denominator of a Laplace transform F(s) contains distinct linear factors, repeated linear 
factors, and quadratic polynomials with no real factors. We shall examine each of these cases 
as this chapter develops.

4.2.2 Transforms of Derivatives
 Transform of a Derivative As pointed out in the introduction to this chapter, our im-
mediate goal is to use the Laplace transform to solve differential equations. To that end we need 
to evaluate quantities such as +{dy/dt} and +{d 2y/dt 2}. For example, if f 
 is continuous for 
t  0, then integration by parts gives
 
+{ f 
(t)}  #
q

estf 
(t) dt  estf (t) 2

 estf (t) dt
 
 f (0)  s+{ f (t)}
or 
+{ f 
(t)}  sF (s)  f (0). 
(6)
Here we have assumed that est f (t) S 0 as t S q. Similarly, with the aid of (6),
+{ f  (t)}  #
q

 est f  (t) dt  estf

 f

 s[sF(s)  f (0)]  f 
(0)
or 
+{ f  (t)}  s2F(s)  s f (0)  f 
(0). 
(7)
In like manner it can be shown that
 
+{ f  (t)}  s3F(s)  s2 f (0)  s f 
(0)  f (0). 
(8)
The recursive nature of the Laplace transform of the derivatives of a function f should be appar-
ent from the results in (6), (7), and (8). The next theorem gives the Laplace transform of the nth 
derivative of f.

Theorem 4.2.2 
Transform of a Derivative
If f,  f 
, . . . , f  (n1) are continuous on [0, q) and are of exponential order and if f  (n)(t) is piecewise 
continuous on [0, q), then
+{ f  (n)(t)}  s nF(s)  s n1f (0)  s n2f 
(0)  p  f  (n1)(0),
where F(s)  +{ f (t)}.
*The numbers 1, 2, and 4 are the zeros of the common denominator (s  1)(s  2)(s  4).

4.2 The Inverse Transform and Transforms of Derivatives

221
 Solving Linear ODEs It is apparent from the general result given in Theorem 4.2.2 that 
+{d ny/dt n} depends on Y (s)  +{y(t)} and the n  1 derivatives of y(t) evaluated at t  0. This 
property makes the Laplace transform ideally suited for solving linear initial-value problems in 
which the differential equation has constant coefficients. Such a differential equation is simply 
a linear combination of terms y, y
, y, . . . , y(n): 
an d
 ny
dt n   an1 d
 n21y
dt n21   p  a0 y  g(t),
 y(0)  y0, y
(0)  y1, … , y(n1)(0)  yn1,
where the coefficients ai, i  0, 1, . . . , n and y0, y1, . . . , yn1 are constants. By the linearity property, 
the Laplace transform of this linear combination is a linear combination of Laplace transforms:
 
an + e d
 ny
dt
 n f   an1 + e d
 n21y
dt
 n21 f   p  a0 +{y}  +{g(t)}. 
(9)
From Theorem 4.2.2, (9) becomes
an[snY(s)  sn  1y(0)  p  y(n  1)(0)]
 an1[sn  1Y(s)  sn  2 y(0)  p  y(n  2)(0)]  p  a0Y(s)  G(s), 
(10)
where +{y(t)}  Y(s) and +{g(t)}  G(s). In other words:
The Laplace transform of a linear differential equation with constant coefficients becomes 
an algebraic equation in Y(s).
If we solve the general transformed equation (10) for the symbol Y(s), we first obtain P(s)Y(s)  
Q(s)  G(s), and then write
 
Y(s)  Q(s)
P(s)  G(s)
P(s), 
(11)
where P(s)  ansn  an1sn  1  p  a0, Q(s) is a polynomial in s of degree less than or equal 
to n  1 consisting of the various products of the coefficients ai, i  1, . . . , n, and the prescribed 
initial conditions y0, y1, . . . , yn1, and G(s) is the Laplace transform of g(t).* Typically we put the 
two terms in (11) over the least common denominator and then decompose the expression into 
two or more partial fractions. Finally, the solution y(t) of the original initial-value problem is 
y(t)  +1{Y(s)}, where the inverse transform is done term by term.
The procedure is summarized in FIGURE 4.2.1.

CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
SOLUTION We first take the transform of each member of the differential equation:
+ e dy
dt f   3 +{y}  13 +{sin 2t}. 
(12)
But from (6), +{dy/dt}  sY(s)  y(0)  sY(s)  6, and from part (d) of Theorem 4.1.1, 
+{sin 2t}  2/(s2  4), and so (12) is the same as
sY(s)  6  3Y(s)  
26
s2  4   or  (s  3)Y(s)  6  
26
s2  4.
Solving the last equation for Y(s), we get
 
Y(s) 

s  3 
26
(s  3)(s2  4) 
6s2  50
(s  3)(s2  4). 
(13)
Since the quadratic polynomial s2  4 does not factor using real numbers, its assumed 
numerator in the partial fraction decomposition is a linear polynomial in s:
6s2  50
(s  3)(s2  4) 
A
s  3  Bs  C
s2  4 .
Putting the right side of the equality over a common denominator and equating numerators 
gives 6s2  50  A(s2  4)  (Bs  C)(s  3). Setting s  3 then yields immediately 
A  8. Since the denominator has no more real zeros, we equate the coefficients of s2 and s: 
6  A  B and 0  3B  C. Using the value of A in the first equation gives B  2, and then 
using this last value in the second equation gives C  6. Thus
Y(s) 
6s2  50
(s  3)(s2  4) 
8
s  3  2s  6
s2  4 .
We are not quite finished because the last rational expression still has to be written as two 
fractions. But this was done by termwise division in Example 2. From (2) of that example,

It follows from parts (c), (d), and (e) of Theorem 4.2.1 that the solution of the initial-value 
problem is y(t)  8e3t 2 2 cos 2t  3 sin 2t.

4.2 The Inverse Transform and Transforms of Derivatives 
| 223
Examples 4 and 5 illustrate the basic procedure for using the Laplace transform to solve 
a linear initial-value problem, but these examples may appear to demonstrate a method that 
is not much better than the approach to such problems outlined in Sections 2.3 and 3.3–3.6. 
Don’t draw any negative conclusions from the two examples. Yes, there is a lot of algebra 
inherent in the use of the Laplace transform, but observe that we do not have to use variation 
of parameters or worry about the cases and algebra in the method of undetermined coeffi-
cients. Moreover, since the method incorporates the prescribed initial conditions directly into 
the solution, there is no need for the separate operations of applying the initial conditions to 
the general solution y  c1y1  c2y2  p  cn yn yp of the DE to find specific constants in 
a particular solution of the IVP.
The Laplace transform has many operational properties. We will examine some of these 
properties and illustrate how they enable us to solve problems of greater complexity in the sec-
tions that follow.
We conclude this section with a little bit of additional theory related to the types of 
functions of s that we will generally be working with. The next theorem indicates that not 
every arbitrary function of s is a Laplace transform of a piecewise-continuous function of 
exponential order.
Theorem 4.2.3 
Behavior of F(s) as s S q
If f is piecewise continuous on [0, q) and of exponential order, then lim
sSq + { f (t)}  0.
PROOF: Since f (t) is piecewise continuous on the closed interval [0, T ], it is necessarily bounded 
on the interval. That is, | f (t)|  M1  M1e0t. Also, because f is assumed to be of exponential 
order, there exist constants g, M2  0, and T  0, such that | f (t)|  M2eg t for t  T. If M denotes 
the maximum of {M1, M2} and c denotes the maximum of {0, g}, then
Z+5 f (t)6Z # #

q

est ect dt  M e(s2c)t
s 2 c  2
 q
 0

M
s 2 c
for s  c. As s S q, we have Z+{ f (t)}Z S 0, and so +{ f (t)} S 0.
As a consequence of Theorem 4.2.3 we can say that functions of s such as F1(s)  1 and 
F2(s)  s/(s  1) are not the Laplace transforms of piecewise-continuous functions of exponential 
order since F1(s) S 0 and F2(s) S 0 as s S q. But you should not conclude from this that F1(s) 
and F2(s) are not Laplace transforms. There are other kinds of functions.
REMARKS
(i) The inverse Laplace transform of a function F(s) may not be unique; in other words, 
it is possible that +{ f1(t)}  +{ f2(t)} and yet f1 	 f2. For our purposes this is not any-
thing to be concerned about. If f1 and f2 are piecewise continuous on [0, q) and of ex-
ponential order, then f1 and f2 are essentially the same. See Problem 50 in Exercises 4.2. 
However, if f1 and f2 are continuous on [0, q) and +{ f1(t)}  +{ f2(t)}, then f1  f2 on 
the interval.
(ii) This remark is for those of you who will be required to do partial fraction decompo-
sitions by hand. There is another way of determining the coefficients in a partial fraction 
decomposition in the special case when +{ f (t)}  F(s) is a rational function of s and the 
denominator of F is a product of distinct linear factors. Let us illustrate by reexamining 
Example 3. Suppose we multiply both sides of the assumed decomposition
 
s2  6s  9
(s 2 1)(s 2 2)(s  4) 
A
s 2 1 
B
s 2 2 
C
s  4 
(15)

224 
| CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
by, say, s  1, simplify, and then set s  1. Since the coefficients of B and C on the right side 
of the equality are zero, we get
s2  6s  9
(s 2 2)(s  4) 2
 s1
 A or A  16
5 .
Written another way,
s2  6s  9
(s 2 1) (s 2 2)(s  4) 2
 s1
 16
5  A,
where we have colored or covered up the factor that canceled when the left side was multiplied 
by s  1. Now to obtain B and C we simply evaluate the left-hand side of (15) while covering 
up, in turn, s  2 and s  4: 
s2  6s  9
(s 2 1) (s 2 2) (s  4) 2
 s2
 25
6  B and 
s2  6s  9
(s 2 1)(s 2 2) (s  4) 2
 s4
 1
30  C.
The desired decomposition (15) is given in (4). This special technique for determining coef-
ficients is naturally known as the cover-up method.
(iii) In this remark we continue our introduction to the terminology of dynamical systems. 
Because of (9) and (10) the Laplace transform is well adapted to linear dynamical systems. In 
(11) the polynomial P(s)  ansn  an  1sn  1  p  a0 is the total coefficient of Y(s) in (10) 
and is simply the left-hand side of the DE with the derivatives d ky/dt k replaced by powers sk, 
k  0, 1, … , n. It is usual practice to call the reciprocal of P(s), namely, W(s)  1/P(s), the 
transfer function of the system and write (11) as
 
Y(s)  W(s)Q(s)  W(s)G(s). 
(16)
In this manner we have separated, in an additive sense, the effects on the response that are due 
to the initial conditions (that is, W(s)Q(s)) and to the input function g (that is, W(s)G(s)). See 
(13) and (14). Hence the response y(t) of the system is a superposition of two responses
y(t)  +1{W(s)Q(s)}  +1{W(s)G(s)}  y0(t)  y1(t).
If the input is g(t)  0, then the solution of the problem is y0(t)  +1{W(s)Q(s)}. This 
solution is called the zero-input response of the system. On the other hand, the function 
y1(t)  +1{W(s)G(s)} is the output due to the input g(t). Now if the initial state of the system 
is the zero state (all the initial conditions are zero), then Q(s)  0, and so the only solution of 
the initial-value problem is y1(t). The latter solution is called the zero-state response of the 
system. Both y0(t) and y1(t) are particular solutions: y0(t) is a solution of the IVP consisting of 
the associated homogeneous equation with the given initial conditions, and y1(t) is a solution of 
the IVP consisting of the nonhomogeneous equation with zero initial conditions. In Example 5, 
we see from (14) that the transfer function is W(s)  1/(s2  3s  2), the zero-input response is
y0(t)   +21 b
s  2
(s 2 1)(s 2 2) r  3et  4e2t,
and the zero-state response is
y1(t)  +1 b
1
(s 2 1)(s 2 2)(s  4) r  1
5 et  1
6 e2t  1
30 e4t.
Verify that the sum of y0(t) and y1(t) is the solution y(t) in that example and that y0(0)  1, 
y90(0)  5, whereas y1(0)  0, y91(0)  0.

4.3 Translation Theorems
INTRODUCTION It is not convenient to use Definition 4.1.1 each time we wish to find the 
Laplace transform of a given function f (t). For example, the integration by parts required to 
determine the transform of, say, f (t)  et t 2 sin 3t is formidable to say the least when done by 
hand. In this section and the next we present several labor-saving theorems that enable us to build 
up a more extensive list of transforms (see the table in Appendix III) without the necessity of 
using the definition of the Laplace transform.

Evaluating transforms such as +{e5tt 3} and +{e–2t cos 4t} is straightforward provided we know 
+{t 3} and +{cos 4t}, which we do. In general, if we know +{ f (t)}  F(s) it is possible to 
compute the Laplace transform of an exponential multiple of the function f, that is, +{eat f (t)}, 
with no additional effort other than translating, or shifting, F(s) to F(s  a). This result is known 
as the first translation theorem or first shifting theorem.
Theorem 4.3.1 
First Translation Theorem
If +{ f (t)}  F(s) and a is any real number, then
+{eat f (t)}  F(s  a).
PROOF: The proof is immediate, since by Definition 4.1.1
+{eat f (t)}  #
q
0
esteat f (t) dt  #
q
0
e (s  a)t f (t) dt  F(s  a).
If we consider s a real variable, then the graph of F(s  a) is the graph of F(s) shifted on the 
s-axis by the amount |a|. If a  0, the graph of F(s) is shifted a units to the right, whereas if a  0, 
the graph is shifted |a| units to the left. See FIGURE 4.3.1.
For emphasis it is sometimes useful to use the symbolism
+{eat f (t)}  +{ f (t)}sSs  a ,
where s S s  a means that in the Laplace transform F(s) of f (t) we replace the symbol s where 
it appears by s  a.

 Inverse Form of Theorem 4.3.1 To compute the inverse of F(s  a) we must recognize 
F(s), find f (t) by taking the inverse Laplace transform of F(s), and then multiply f (t) by the expo-
nential function eat. This procedure can be summarized symbolically in the following manner:
 
+1{F(s  a)}  +1{F (s)ZsSs  a}  eatf (t), 
(1)
where f (t)  +1{F(s)}.

SOLUTION (a)  A repeated linear factor is a term (s  a)n, where a is a real number and n is 
a positive integer  2. Recall that if (s  a)n appears in the denominator of a rational expres-
sion, then the assumed decomposition contains n partial fractions with constant numerators 
and denominators s  a, (s  a)2, … , (s  a)n. Hence with a  3 and n  2 we write
 
2s  5
(s 2 3)2 
A
s 2 3 
B
(s 2 3)2.
The numerator obtained by putting the two terms on the right over a common denominator is 
2s  5  A(s  3)  B, and this identity yields A  2 and B  11. Therefore,

Now 1/(s  3)2 is F(s)  1/s2 shifted 3 units to the right. Since +1{1/s2}  t, it follows from 
(1) that

(s 2 3)2 f   2e3t  11e3tt.

(b)  To start, observe that the quadratic polynomial s2  4s  6 does not have real zeros and 
so has no real linear factors. In this situation we complete the square:
 
s/2  5/3
s2  4s  6 
s/2  5/3
(s  2)2  2. 
(5)
Our goal here is to recognize the expression on the right as some Laplace transform F(s) in 
which s has been replaced throughout by s  2. What we are trying to do here is analogous 
to working part (b) of Example 1 backward. The denominator in (5) is already in the correct 
form; that is, s2  2 with s replaced by s  2. However, we must fix up the numerator by 
manipulating the constants: 1

4.3.2 Translation on the t-axis
 Unit Step Function In engineering, one frequently encounters functions that are either 
“off ” or “on.” For example, an external force acting on a mechanical system or a voltage impressed 
on a circuit can be turned off after a period of time. It is convenient, then, to define a special func-
tion that is the number 0 (off) up to a certain time t  a and then the number 1 (on) after that time. 
This function is called the unit step function or the Heaviside function, named after the renowned 
English electrical engineer, physicist, and mathematician Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925). The 
Heaviside layer in the ionosphere, which can reflect radio waves, is named in his honor.

Definition 4.3.1 
Unit Step Function
The unit step function 8(t  a) is defined to be
8(t 2 a)  e0,
0 # t , a
1,
t $ a.
Notice that we define 8(t  a) only on the nonnegative t-axis since this is all that we are 
concerned with in the study of the Laplace transform. In a broader sense 8(t  a)  0 for t  a. 
The graph of 8(t  a) is given in FIGURE 4.3.2.
When a function f defined for t  0 is multiplied by 8(t  a), the unit step function “turns 
off ” a portion of the graph of that function. For example, consider the function f (t)  2t  3. 
To “turn off  ” the portion of the graph of f on, say, the interval 0  t  1, we simply form the 
product (2t  3)8(t  1). See FIGURE 4.3.3. In general, the graph of f (t) 8(t  a) is 0 (off ) for 
0  t  a and is the portion of the graph of f (on) for t  a.
The unit step function can also be used to write piecewise-defined functions in a compact 
form. For example, by considering 0  t  2, 2  t  3, t  3, and the corresponding values 
of 8(t  2) and 8(t  3), it should be apparent that the piecewise-defined function shown in 
FIGURE 4.3.4 is the same as f (t)  2  3 8(t  2)  8(t  3). Also, a general piecewise-defined 
function of the type
 
f (t)  eg(t),
0 # t , a
h(t),
t $ a 
(9)
is the same as
 
f (t)  g(t)  g(t) 8(t  a)  h(t) 8(t  a). 
(10)
Similarly, a function of the type
 
f (t)  •
0,
g(t),
0,
 
0 # t , a
a # t , b
t $ b
 
(11)
can be written 
f (t)  g(t)[8(t  a)  8(t  b)]. 
(12)

SOLUTION The graph of f is given in FIGURE 4.3.5. Now from (9) and (10) with a  5, 
g(t)  20t, and h(t)  0, we get f (t)  20t 2 20t 8 (t 2 5).
Consider a general function y  f (t) defined for t  0. The piecewise-defined function
 
f (t  a)8(t  a)  e0,
 f (t 2 a), 0 # t , a

CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
plays a significant role in the discussion that follows. As shown in FIGURE 4.3.6, for a  0 the 
graph of the function y  f (t  a) 8(t  a) coincides with the graph of y  f (t  a) for t  a 
(which is the entire graph of y  f (t), t  0, shifted a units to the right on the t-axis) but is iden-
tically zero for 0  t  a.
We saw in Theorem 4.3.1 that an exponential multiple of f (t) results in a translation of the 
transform F(s) on the s-axis. As a consequence of the next theorem we see that whenever F(s) is 
multiplied by an exponential function eas, a  0, the inverse transform of the product easF(s) 
is the function f shifted along the t-axis in the manner illustrated in Figure 4.3.6(b). This result, 
presented next in its direct transform version, is called the second translation theorem or 
second shifting theorem.

Second Translation Theorem
If F(s)  +{ f (t)} and a  0, then
 
+{ f (t  a)8(t  a)}  easF(s).
PROOF: By the additive interval property of integrals, eq
0 estf (t  a) 8(t  a) dt can be written 
as two integrals:
 
+{ f (t  a) 8(t  a)}  #

es (v  a)f (v) dv

We often wish to find the Laplace transform of just a unit step function. This can be found 
from either Definition 4.1.1 or Theorem 4.3.2. If we identify f (t)  1 in Theorem 4.3.2, then 
f (t  a)  1, F(s)  +{1}  1/s, and so
 
+{8(t  a)}   eas
s . 
(14)
EXAMPLE 6 
Figure 4.3.4 Revisited

The last expression can be simplified somewhat using the addition formula for the cosine. 
Verify that the result is the same as sin 3t 8 (t 2 p/2).
 Alternative Form of Theorem 4.3.2 We are frequently confronted with the problem 
of finding the Laplace transform of a product of a function g and a unit step function 8(t  a) 
where the function g lacks the precise shifted form f (t  a) in Theorem 4.3.2. To find the Laplace 
transform of g(t)8(t  a), it is possible to fix up g(t) into the required form f (t  a) by algebraic 
manipulations. For example, if we want to use Theorem 4.3.2 to find the Laplace transform of 
t 2 8(t  2), we would have to force g(t)  t 2 into the form f (t  2). You should work through 
the details and verify that t 2  (t  2)2  4(t  2)  4 is an identity. Therefore,
 
+{t 2 8(t  2)}  +{(t  2)2 8(t  2)  4(t  2) 8(t  2)  48(t  2)},
 
 2e2s
s3

by Theorem 4.3.2. But since these manipulations are time-consuming and often not obvious, it 
is simpler to devise an alternative version of Theorem 4.3.2. Using Definition 4.1.1, the definition 
of 8(t  a), and the substitution u  t  a, we obtain
 
+{g(t)8(t  a)}  #

That is,

(19)
where E is Young’s modulus of elasticity and I is a moment of inertia of a cross section of the beam. 
The Laplace transform is particularly useful when w(x) is piecewise  defined, but in order to use the 
transform, we must tacitly assume that y(x) and w(x) are defined on (0, q) rather than on (0, L). 
Note, too, that the next example is a boundary-value problem rather than an initial-value problem.

are y(0)  0, y
(0)  0, y(L)  0, y
(L)  0. Now by (10) we can express w(x) in terms of the

4.4 Additional Operational Properties
INTRODUCTION In this section we develop several more operational properties of the Laplace 
transform. Specifically, we shall see how to find the transform of a function f (t) that is multiplied 
by a monomial t n, the transform of a special type of integral, and the transform of a periodic func-
tion. The last two transform properties allow us to solve some equations that we have not encoun-
tered up to this point: Volterra integral equations, integrodifferential equations, and ordinary 
differential equations in which the input function is a periodic piecewise-defined function.

4.4.1 Derivatives of Transforms
 Multiplying a Function by t n The Laplace transform of the product of a function f (t) 
with t can be found by differentiating the Laplace transform of f (t). If F (s)  +{ f (t)} and if we 
assume that interchanging of differentiation and integration is possible, then

that is, 
+{t f (t)}   d
ds +{ f (t)}.
Similarly,

  +{t  f (t)}
 
         d

ds +5 f (t)6b  d 2
ds2 +5 f (t)6.
The preceding two cases suggest the following general result for +{t nf (t)}.
Theorem 4.4.1 
Derivatives of Transforms
If F (s)  +{ f (t)} and n  1, 2, 3, … , then
 
+5tnf (t)6  (1)n d n
dsn F(s).
EXAMPLE 1 
Using Theorem 4.4.1
Evaluate +{t sin kt}.
SOLUTION With f (t)  sin kt, F(s)  k/(s2  k 2), and n  1, Theorem 4.4.1 gives
 
+5t sin kt6   d
ds +5 sin  kt6   d
ds a
k
s2  k2b 
2ks
(s2  k2)2. 
If we wanted to evaluate +{t 2 sin kt} and +{t 3 sin kt}, all we need do, in turn, is take the nega-
tive of the derivative with respect to s of the result in Example 1 and then take the negative of the 
derivative with respect to s of +{t 2 sin kt}.
To find transforms of functions t neat we can use either the first translation theorem or 
Theorem 4.4.1. For example,

An Initial-Value Problem
Solve x  16x  cos 4t, x(0)  0, x
(0)  1.
SOLUTION The initial-value problem could describe the forced, undamped, and resonant 
motion of a mass on a spring. The mass starts with an initial velocity of 1 foot per second in 
the downward direction from the equilibrium position.
Transforming the differential equation gives

4.4.2 Transforms of Integrals
 Convolution If functions f and g are piecewise continuous on the interval f0, q), then 
the convolution of f and g, denoted by the symbol f * g, is a function defined by the integral
 
f  * g  #
t
0
f (t)g(t 2 t) dt. 
(2)
Because we are integrating in (2) with respect to the variable t (the lowercase Greek letter tau), 
the convolution f * g is a function of t. To emphasize this fact, (2) is also written ( f * g)(t). As 
the notation f * g suggests, the convolution (2) is often interpreted as a generalized product of 
two functions f and g.
EXAMPLE 3 
Convolution of Two Functions
Evaluate (a)  et * sin t  (b)  +{et * sin t}.
SOLUTION (a) With the identifications
f (t)  et, g(t)  sin t and f (t)  et, g(t 2 t)  sin(t 2 t)
it follows from (2) and integration by parts that

that is, f * g  g * f. In other words, the convolution of two functions is commutative.
 Convolution Theorem 
We have seen that if f and g are both piecewise continuous for 
t  0, then the Laplace transform of a sum f  g is the sum of the individual Laplace transforms. 
While it is not true that the Laplace transform of the product fg is the product of the Laplace 

transforms, we see in the next theorem—called the convolution theorem—that the Laplace trans-
form of the generalized product f * g is the product of the Laplace transforms of f and g.
Theorem 4.4.2 
Convolution Theorem
If f (t) and g(t) are piecewise continuous on [0, q) and of exponential order, then
+{ f * g}  +{ f (t)}+{g(t)}  F(s) G(s).
PROOF: Let
F(s)  +5 f (t)6  #
q

estf (t) dt and G(s)  +5g(t)6  #

In the tt-plane we are integrating over the shaded region in FIGURE 4.4.1. Since f and g are 
piecewise continuous on [0, q) and of exponential order, it is possible to interchange the 
order of integration:

functions without actually evaluating the definite integral #

CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
 Inverse Form of Theorem 4.4.2 The convolution theorem is sometimes useful in 
finding the inverse Laplace transforms of the product of two Laplace transforms. From 
Theorem 4.4.2 we have
+15F (s) G(s)6  f * g. 
(4)
Many of the results in the table of Laplace transforms in Appendix III can be derived using (4). 
For instance, in the next example we obtain entry 25 of the table:
 
+{sin kt  kt cos kt}  
2k3
(s2  k2)2. 
(5)
EXAMPLE 5 
Inverse Transform as a Convolution
Evaluate +1 e

(s2  k 2 )2 f .
SOLUTION Let F(s)  G(s)  
1
s2  k2
so that 
f (t)  g(t)  1
k +1 e
k
s2  k2 f  1

In this case (4) gives
 
+1 e
1
(s2  k2)2 f  1
k2#
t

 sin kt sin k(t  t) dt. 
(6)
Now recall from trigonometry that
 
sin A sin B  1
2 [cos (A  B)  cos (A  B)].
If we set A  kt and B  k(t  t), we can carry out the integration in (6):
 +1 e

(s2  k2)2 f 

Multiplying both sides by 2k 3 gives the inverse form of (5).
 Transform of an Integral When g(t)  1 and +{g(t)}  G(s)  1/s, the convolution 
theorem implies that the Laplace transform of the integral of f is

The inverse form of (7),

can be used in lieu of partial fractions when s n is a factor of the denominator and f (t)  +1{F(s)} 
is easy to integrate. For example, we know for f (t)  sin t that F(s)  1/(s2  1), and so by (8)

and so on.
 Volterra Integral Equation The convolution theorem and the result in (7) are useful 
in solving other types of equations in which an unknown function appears under an integral sign. 
In the next example, we solve a Volterra integral equation for f (t),
 
f (t)  g(t)  #
t
0
 f (t) h(t  t) dt. 
(9)
The functions g(t) and h(t) are known. Notice that the integral in (9) has the convolution form 
(2) with the symbol h playing the part of g.
EXAMPLE 6 
An Integral Equation
Solve f (t)  3t 2  et  #
t

  f (t) et  t dt for f (t).
SOLUTION In the integral we identify h(t  t)  et  t so that h(t)  et. We take the Laplace 
transform of each term; in particular, by Theorem 4.4.2 the transform of the integral is the 
product of +{ f (t)}  F(s) and +{et}  1/(s  1):
F(s)  3 2
s3 2

After solving the last equation for F(s) and carrying out the partial fraction decomposition, 
we find
F(s)  6

The inverse transform then gives

 Series Circuits In a single-loop or series circuit, Kirchhoff ’s second law states that the 
sum of the voltage drops across an inductor, resistor, and capacitor is equal to the impressed 
voltage E(t). Now it is known that the voltage drops across an inductor, resistor, and capacitor 
are, respectively,
 
L di

where i(t) is the current and L, R, and C are constants. It follows that the current in an LRC-series

CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
EXAMPLE 7 
An Integrodifferential Equation
Determine the current i(t) in a single-loop LRC-circuit when L  0.1 h, R  2 , C  0.1 f, 
i(0)  0, and the impressed voltage is
 
E(t)  120t  120t 8(t  1).
SOLUTION Using the given data, equation (10) becomes
 
0.1 di
dt  2i  10#
t
0 i(t) dt  120t  120t 8(t  1).
Now by (7), +{et
0 i(t) dt}  I(s)/s, where I(s)  +{i(t)}. Thus the Laplace transform of the 
integrodifferential equation is

Multiplying this equation by 10s, using s2  20s  100  (s  10)2, and then solving for I(s) 
gives

From the inverse form of the second translation theorem, (15) of Section 4.3, we finally obtain
 
i(t)  12 [1  8(t  1)] 12 [e10t  e10(t  1) 8(t  1)]
 
  120te10t  1080(t  1)e10(t  1) 8(t  1).
Written as a piecewise-defined function, the current is

Using the last form of the solution and a CAS, we graph i(t) on each of the two intervals and 
then combine the graphs. Note in FIGURE 4.4.3 that even though the input E(t) is discontinuous, 
the output or response i(t) is a continuous function.

we can use the inverse form of the convolution theorem (4) to write the solution of the IVP as

(12)
where +1 e

s2  as  b f  g(t) and +15F(s)6  f (t). On the other hand, we know from 
(9) of Section 3.10 that the solution of the IVP is also given by
 
y(t)  #
t
0
 G(t, t)  f (t) dt, 
(13)
where G(t, t) is the Green’s function for the differential equation.
By comparing (12) and (13) we see that the Green’s function for the differential equation is 
related to +1 e

s2  as  b f  g(t) by
 
G(t, t)  g(t  t). 
(14)
For example, for the initial-value problem y  4y  f (t), y(0)  0, y
(0)  0 we find
 
+1 e

Thus from (14) we see that the Green’s function for the DE y  4y  f (t) is G(t, t)  g(t  t) 

2 sin 2(t  t). See Example 4 in Section 3.10.
In Example 4 of Section 3.10, the 
roles of the symbols x and t are 
played by t and t, respectively, in 
this discussion.
REMARKS
Although the defining integral in the Laplace transform was known and used for a long time 
prior to the twentieth century, it was not used to solve differential equations. The fact that we 
use the Laplace transform today to solve a variety of equations is actually due to Oliver 
Heaviside (see page 229). In 1893, Heaviside invented an operational calculus for solving 
differential equations encountered in electrical engineering. Heaviside was no mathematician, 
and his procedures for solving differential equations were formal manipulations or procedures 
lacking mathematical justification. Nonetheless, these procedures worked. In an attempt to 
put his operational calculus on a sound foundation, mathematicians discovered that the rules 
of his calculus matched many properties of the Laplace transform. Over time, Heaviside’s 
operation calculus disappeared, to be replaced by the theory and applications of the Laplace 
transform.
You should verify either by substitution in the equation or by the method of Section 2.3 
that y(t)  etet
0eu2u du is a perfectly good solution of the linear initial-value problem 
y9  y  et2, y(0)  0. We now solve the same equation with a formal application of the 
Laplace transform. If we denote +{y} Y(s) and +5et26  F(s), then the transform of the 
equation is
sY(s) 2 y(0)  Y(s)  F(s)  or  Y(s)  F(s)
s  1.
Using +15F(s)6  et2 and +1 e

s  1 f  et it follows from the inverse form (4) of the

4.5 The Dirac Delta Function
INTRODUCTION Just before the Remarks on page 223, we indicated that as an immediate 
consequence of Theorem 4.2.3, F(s)  1 cannot be the Laplace transform of a function f that is 
piecewise continuous on [0, q) and of exponential order. In the discussion that follows we are 
going to introduce a function that is very different from the kinds that you have studied in previ-
ous courses. We shall see that there does indeed exist a function, or more precisely a generalized 
function, whose Laplace transform is F(s)  1.
 Unit Impulse Mechanical systems are often acted on by an external force (or emf in an 
electrical circuit) of large magnitude that acts only for a very short period of time. For example, 
a vibrating airplane wing could be struck by lightning, a mass on a spring could be given a sharp 
blow by a ball peen hammer, a ball (baseball, golf ball, tennis ball) could be sent soaring when 
struck violently by some kind of club (baseball bat, golf club, tennis racket). The graph of the 
piecewise-defined function

(1)
a  0, t0  0, shown in FIGURE 4.5.1(a), could serve as a model for such a force. For a small value of a, 
da(t  t0) is essentially a constant function of large magnitude that is “on” for just a very short period of 
time, around t0. The behavior of da(t  t0) as a S 0 is illustrated in Figure 4.5.1(b). The function 
da(t  t0) is called a unit impulse since it possesses the integration property eq
0 da(t  t0) dt  1.

 The Dirac Delta Function In practice it is convenient to work with another type of unit 
impulse, a “function” that approximates da(t  t0) and is defined by the limit
 
d(t  t0)  lim
aS0 da(t  t0).  
(2)
The latter expression, which is not a function at all, can be characterized by the two properties
 
(i) d(t  t0)  e q,
0, t  t0
t 2 t0
  and  (ii) #
q
0
d(t  t0) dt  1.
The unit impulse d(t  t0) is called the Dirac delta function.
It is possible to obtain the Laplace transform of the Dirac delta function by the formal assump-
tion that +{d(t  t0)}  limaS0 +{da(t  t0)}.
Theorem 4.5.1 
Transform of the Dirac Delta Function
For t0 . 0, 
+5d(t 2 t0)6  est0. 
(3)
PROOF: To begin, we can write da(t  t0) in terms of the unit step function by virtue of (11) and 
(12) of Section 4.3:
 
da(t 2 t0)  1
2a f8(t 2 (t0 2 a)) 2 8(t 2 (t0  a))g.
By linearity and (14) of Section 4.3, the Laplace transform of this last expression is
 
+5da(t 2 t0)6  1
2a c es(t02a)
s
2 es(t0a)
s
d  est0 aesa 2 esa
2sa
b. 
(4)
Since (4) has the indeterminate form 0/0 as a S 0, we apply L’Hôpital’s rule:
+5d(t 2 t0)6  lim
aS0 +5da(t 2 t0)6  est0 lim
aS0 aesa 2 esa
2sa
b  est0.
Now when t0  0, it seems plausible to conclude from (3) that
 
+{d (t)}  1.
The last result emphasizes the fact that d(t) is not the usual type of function that we have been 
considering, since we expect from Theorem 4.2.3 that +{ f (t)} S 0 as s S q.
EXAMPLE 1 
Two Initial-Value Problems
Solve y  y  4 d (t  2p) subject to
(a)  y(0)  1, y
(0)  0   (b)  y(0)  0, y
(0)  0.
The two initial-value problems could serve as models for describing the motion of a mass on 
a spring moving in a medium in which damping is negligible. At t  2p the mass is given a 
sharp blow. In part (a) the mass is released from rest 1 unit below the equilibrium position. In 
part (b) the mass is at rest in the equilibrium position.
SOLUTION (a)  From (3) the Laplace transform of the differential equation is
 
s2Y(s)  s  Y(s)  4e2ps or Y(s)  
s
s2  1  4e2ps
s2  1.
Using the inverse form of the second translation theorem, (15) of Section 4.3, we find
 
y(t)  cos t  4 sin(t  2p) 8(t  2p).
4.5 The Dirac Delta Function 
|
249

250 
| CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
REMARKS
(i) If d(t  t0) were a function in the usual sense, then property (ii ) on page 249 would imply 
eq
0 d(t  t0) dt  0 rather than eq
0 d(t  t0) dt  1. Since the Dirac delta function did not “behave” 
like an ordinary function, even though its users produced correct results, it was met initially with 
great scorn by mathematicians. However, in the 1940s Dirac’s controversial function was put 
on a rigorous footing by the French mathematician Laurent Schwartz in his book Théorie des 
distributions, and this, in turn, led to an entirely new branch of mathematics known as the 
theory of distributions or generalized functions. In this theory, (2) is not an accepted definition 
of d(t  t0), nor does one speak of a function whose values are either q or 0. Although we shall 
not pursue this topic any further, suffice it to say that the Dirac delta function is best character-
ized by its effect on other functions. If f is a continuous function, then
 
#
q
0
 f (t) d(t 2 t0) dt  f (t0) 
(7)
can be taken as the definition of d(t  t0). This result is known as the sifting property since 
d(t  t0) has the effect of sifting the value f (t0) out of the set of values of f on [0, q). Note that 
property (ii) (with f (t)  1) and (3) (with f (t)  est) are consistent with (7).
(ii) In the Remarks in Section 4.2 we indicated that the transfer function of a general linear 
nth-order differential equation with constant coefficients is W(s)  1/P(s), where P(s)  
ansn  an1sn  1  p  a0. The transfer function is the Laplace transform of function w(t), 
called the weight function of a linear system. But w(t) can be characterized in terms of the 
discussion at hand. For simplicity let us consider a second-order linear system in which the 
input is a unit impulse at t  0:
 
a2 y  a1 y
  a0 y  d(t),  y(0)  0,  y
(0)  0.
Applying the Laplace transform and using +{d(t)}  1 shows that the transform of the 
response y in this case is the transfer function
 
Y(s) 
1
a2s2  a1s  a0

1
P(s)  W(s) and so y  +1 e 1
P(s) f  w(t).
From this we can see, in general, that the weight function y  w(t) of an nth-order linear 
system is the zero-state response of the system to a unit impulse. For this reason w(t) is called 
as well the impulse response of the system.
Since sin(t  2p)  sin t, the foregoing solution can be written as
 
y(t)  ecos t,
cos t  4 sin t, 0 # t , 2p 
t $ 2p. 
(5)
In FIGURE 4.5.2 we see from the graph of (5) that the mass is exhibiting simple harmonic motion 
until it is struck at t  2p. The influence of the unit impulse is to increase the amplitude of 
vibration to !17 for t  2p.
(b) In this case the transform of the equation is simply
 
Y(s)  4e2ps
s2  1,
and so 
 y(t)  4 sin(t  2p) 8(t  2p)
 
 
 e0,
4 sin t, 0 # t , 2p.
t $ 2p. 
(6)
The graph of (6) in FIGURE 4.5.3 shows, as we would expect from the initial conditions, that 
the mass exhibits no motion until it is struck at t  2p.

Solve the system in (5) under the conditions E(t)  60 V, L  1 h, R  50 , C  104 f, and

since the current through the capacitor is i3(t)  i1(t)  i2(t)  60te100t, we observe that i3(t) S 0 
as t S q.
 Double Pendulum As shown in FIGURE 4.6.2, a double pendulum oscillates in a vertical 
plane under the influence of gravity. For small displacements u1(t) and u2(t), it can be shown that 
the system of differential equations describing the motion is

As indicated in Figure 4.6.2, u1 is measured (in radians) from a vertical line extending downward 
from the pivot of the system and u2 is measured from a vertical line extending downward from the 
center of mass m1. The positive direction is to the right and the negative direction is to the left.

 21. Range of a Projectile—No Air Resistance 
If you worked 
Problem 23 in Exercises 3.12, you saw that when air resis-
tance and all other forces except its weight w  mg are 
ignored, the path of motion of a ballistic projectile, such 
as a cannon shell, is described by the system of linear dif-
ferential equations
 
 
 m  d 2x
dt2  0
 
 
  m  d 2y
dt2  mg. 
(8)
(a) If the projectile is launched from level ground with an 
initial velocity v0 assumed to be tangent to its path of 
motion or trajectory, then the initial conditions accom-
panying the system are x(0)  0, x(0)  v0 cos u, y(0)  
0, y(0)  v0 sin u where v0  7v07  the initial speed is 
constant and u is the constant angle of elevation of the 
cannon. See Figure 3.R.5 in The Paris Guns problem on 
page 206. Use the Laplace transform to solve system (8). 
(b) The solutions x(t) and y(t) of the system in part (a) are 
parametric equations of the trajectory of the projectile. 
By using x(t) to eliminate the parameter t in y(t) show 
that the trajectory is parabolic.
(c) Use the results of part (b) to show that the horizontal range 
R of the projectile is given by
 
R  v 2

  sin2u.

4.6 Systems of Linear Differential Equations

| CHAPTER 4 The Laplace Transform
 
From (9) we not only see that R is a maximum when u  
p/4 but that a projectile launched at distinct complemen-
tary angles u and p/2  u has the same submaximum 
range. See FIGURE 4.6.8. Use a trigonometric identity to 
prove this last result.
(d) Show that the maximum height H of the projectile is 
given by
 
H  v 2

2 g
  sin2u. 
(10)
(e) Suppose g  32 ft/s2, u 5 38, and v0  300 ft/s. Use 
(9) and (10) to find the horizontal range and maximum 
height of the projectile. Repeat with u  52 and 
v0  300 ft/s.
(f ) Because formulas (9) and (10) are not valid in all cases 
(see Problem 22), it is advantageous to you to remember 
that the range and maximum height of a ballistic projectile 
can be obtained by working directly with x(t) and y(t), that 
is, by solving y(t)  0 and y(t)  0. The first equation 
gives the time when the projectile hits the ground and the 
second gives the time when y(t) is a maximum. Find these 
times and verify the range and maximum height obtained 
in part (e) for the trajectory with u 5 38 and v0  300 ft/s.
Repeat with u 5 52.
(g) With g  32 ft/s2, u 5 38 and v0  300 ft/s use a graph-
ing utility or CAS to plot the trajectory of the projectile 
defined by the parametric equations x(t) and y(t) in 
part (a). Repeat with u 5 52. Using different colors 
superimpose both curves on the same coordinate 
system.

 22. Range of a Projectile—With Linear Air Resistance In The 
Paris Guns problem on pages 206–207, the effect that 
nonlinear air resistance has on the trajectory of a cannon shell 
was examined numerically. In this problem we consider linear 
air resistance on a projectile.
(a) Suppose that air resistance is a retarding force tangent to 
the path of the projectile but acts opposite to the motion. 
If we take air resistance to be proportional to the velocity 
of the projectile, then from Problem 24 of Exercises 3.12 
the motion of the projectile is described by the system of 
linear differential equations
 
m  d 2x
dt2  b  dx
dt
 
m  d 2y
dt2  mg 2 b  dy
dt, 
(11)
 
where b  0 is a constant. Use the Laplace transform to 
solve system (11) subject to the initial conditions in part 
(a) of Problem 21. 
(b) Suppose m  1
4  slug, g  32 ft/s2, b  0.02, u 5 38, 
and v0  300 ft/s. Use a calculator or CAS to approx-
imate the time when the projectile hits the ground and 
then compute x(t) to find its corresponding horizontal 
range.
(c) The complementary-angle property in part (c) of 
Problem 21 does not hold when air resistance is taken 
into consideration. To show this, repeat part (b) using the 
complementary angle u 5 52 and compare the horizon-
tal range with that found in part (b).
(d)  With m  1
4  slug, g  32 ft/s2, b  0.02, u 5 38, and 
v0  300 ft/s, use a graphing utility or CAS to plot the 
trajectory of the projectile defined by the parametric 
equations x(t) and y(t). Repeat with u 5 52. Using dif-
ferent colors, superimpose both of these curves along 
with the two curves in part (g) of Problem 21 on the 
same coordinate system.
Computer Lab Assignment
 23. (a)  Use the Laplace transform and the information given in 
Example 3 to obtain the solution (7) of the system given 
in (6).
(b) Use a graphing utility to plot the graphs of u1(t) and u2(t) 
in the tu-plane. Which mass has extreme displacements 
of greater magnitude? Use the graphs to estimate the 
first time that each mass passes through its equilibrium 
position. Discuss whether the motion of the pendulums 
is periodic.
(c) As parametric equations, graph u1(t) and u2(t) in the 
u1u2-plane. The curve defined by these parametric equa-
tions is called a Lissajous curve.
(d) The position of the masses at t  0 is given in 
Figure 4.6.3(a). Note that we have used 1 radian  57.3. 
Use a calculator or a table application in a CAS to con-
struct a table of values of the angles u1 and u2 for 
t  1, 2, . . ., 10 seconds. Then plot the positions of the 
two masses at these times.
(e) Use a CAS to find the first time that u1(t)  u2(t) and 
compute the corresponding angular value. Plot the posi-
tions of the two masses at these times.
(f ) Utilize a CAS to also draw appropriate lines to simulate 
the pendulum rods as in Figure 4.6.3. Use the animation 
capability of your CAS to make a “movie” of the motion 
of the double pendulum from t  0 to t  10 using a time 
increment of 0.1. [Hint: Express the coordinates 
(x1(t), y1(t)) and (x2(t), y2(t)) of the masses m1 and m2, 
respectively, in terms of u1(t) and u2(t).]

Up to this point we primarily have 
solved differential equations of 
order two or higher when the 
equation was linear and had 
constant coefficients. In 
applications, linear second-order 
equations with variable 
coefficients are as important as 
differential equations with 
constant coefficients. The only 
linear DEs with variable 
coefficients considered so far 
were the Cauchy–Euler equations 
(Section 3.6). In this chapter we 
will see that the same ease with 
which we solved second-order 
Cauchy–Euler equations does not 
carry over to even an 
unpretentious second-order 
equation with variable 
coefficients such as y”  xy  0. 
We will see that solutions of this 
DE are defined by infinite series.

Solutions about Ordinary Points
INTRODUCTION In Section 3.3 we saw that solving a homogeneous linear DE with con-
stant coefficients was essentially a problem in algebra. By finding the roots of the auxiliary 
equation we could write a general solution of the DE as a linear combination of the elementary 
functions xk, xkeax, xkeaxcos bx, and xkeaxsin bx, k a nonnegative integer. But as pointed out in 
the introduction to Section 3.6, most linear higher-order DEs with variable coefficients cannot 
be solved in terms of elementary functions. A usual course of action for equations of this sort is 
to assume a solution in the form of infinite series and proceed in a manner similar to the method 
of undetermined coefficients (Section 3.4). In this section we consider linear second-order DEs 
with variable coefficients that possess solutions in the form of power series.
5.1.1 Review of Power Series
Recall from calculus that a power series in x  a is an infinite series of the form
 
a
q
n0
cn(x 2 a)n  c0  c1(x 2 a)  c2(x 2 a)2  p.
Such a series is also said to be a power series centered at a. For example, the power 
series g
q
n0(x  1)n is centered at a  l. In this section we are concerned mainly with power 
series in x; in other words, power series such as g
q
n1 2n21xn  x  2x2  4x3  p that are 
centered at a  0. The following list summarizes some important facts about power series.
•  Convergence A power series g
q
n0 cn(x 2 a)n is convergent at a specified value of x if its 
sequence of partial sums {SN( x)} converges; that is, if limNSq SN(x)  limNSq gN
n0 cn (x  a)n
exists. If the limit does not exist at x, the series is said to be divergent.
•  Interval of Convergence Every power series has an interval of convergence. The interval 
of convergence is the set of all real numbers x for which the series converges.
•  Radius of Convergence Every power series has a radius of convergence R. If R  0, then 
a power series g
q
n0 cn(x 2 a)n converges for |x  a|  R and diverges for |x  a|  R.
If the series converges only at its center a, then R  0. If the series converges for all x, then 
we write R  q. Recall that the absolute-value inequality |x  a|  R is equivalent to the 
simultaneous inequality a  R  x  a  R. A power series may or may not converge at 
the endpoints a  R and a  R of this interval. FIGURE 5.1.1 shows four possible intervals 
of convergence for R  0.
•  Absolute Convergence Within its interval of convergence a power series converges 
absolutely. In other words, if x is a number in the interval of convergence and is not an 
endpoint of the interval, then the series of absolute values g
q
n0|cn(x  a)n| converges.
•  Ratio Test Convergence of power series can often be determined by the ratio test. Suppose 
that cn  0 for all n, and that
 
lim
nSq 2  cn1(x 2 a)n1
cn(x 2 a)n
 2  |x 2 a| lim
nSq 2  cn1
cn
 2  L.
If L  1 the series converges absolutely, if L  1 the series diverges, and if L  1 the test 
is inconclusive. For example, for the power series g
q
n1 (x  3)n/2nn the ratio test gives
 
lim
nSq 2  (x 2 3)n1/2n1(n  1)
(x 2 3)n/2nn
 2  |x 2 3| lim
nSq 
n
2(n  1)  1
2 |x 2 3|.
The series converges absolutely for 1
2 |x  3|  1 or |x  3|  2 or 1  x  5. This last 
interval is referred to as the open interval of convergence. The series diverges for 
|x  3|  2, that is, for x  5 or x  1. At the left endpoint x  1 of the open interval of 
convergence, the series of constants g
q
n1 ((1)n/n) is convergent by the alternating series 
test. At the right endpoint x  5, the series g
q
n1 (1/n) is the divergent harmonic series. 
The interval of convergence of the series is [1, 5) and the radius of convergence is R  2.

• A Power Series Defines a Function A power series defines a function f (x)  
g
q
n0 cn(x  a)n whose domain is the interval of convergence of the series. If the radius 
of convergence is R  0, then f is continuous, differentiable, and integrable on the interval 
(a  R, a  R). Moreover, f (x) and  f  (x) dx can be found by term-by-term differentiation 
and integration. Convergence at an endpoint may be either lost by differentiation or gained 
through integration. If y5g
q
n0 cnxn is a power series in x, then the first two derivatives 
are y9 5g
q
n0 nxn21 and y0 5g
q
n0 n(n 2 1)xn22. Notice that the first term in the first 
derivative and the first two terms in the second derivative are zero. We omit these zero 
terms and write
 
y9  a
q
n1
 cn nx
 n21 and y0  a
q
n2
cn n(n 2 1) x
 n22. 
(1)
These results are important and will be used shortly.
•  Identity Property If g
q
n0 cn(x  a)n  0, R  0, for all numbers x in the interval of 
convergence, then cn  0 for all n.
• Analytic at a Point A function f is analytic at a point a if it can be represented by a power 
series in x  a with a positive radius of convergence. In calculus it is seen that functions 
such as e x, cos x, sin x, ln(x  1), and so on, can be represented by Taylor series. Recall, 
for example, that
e
 x  1  x
1!  x2
2!  p,  sin x  x 2 x3
3!  x5
5! 2 p,  cos x  1 2 x2
2!  x4
4! 2 x6
6!  p, (2)
for |x|  q. These Taylor series centered at 0, called Maclaurin series, show that ex, sin x, 
and cos x are analytic at x  0.
•  Arithmetic of Power Series Power series can be combined through the operations of 
addition, multiplication, and division. The procedures for power series are similar to the 
way in which two polynomials are added, multiplied, and divided—that is, we add coef-
ficients of like powers of x, use the distributive law and collect like terms, and perform 
long division. For example, using the series in (2), 
 e
 x sin x  a1  x  x2
2  x3
6  x4
24  pb ax 2 x3
6  x5

120 2 1
12  1
24b x5  p
  x  x2  x3
3 2 x5
30 2 p.
Since the power series for e x and sin x converge for | x |  q, the product series converges 
on the same interval. Problems involving multiplication or division of power series can be 
done with minimal fuss using a computer algebra system.
 Shifting the Summation Index For the remainder of this section, as well as this 
chapter, it is important that you become adept at simplifying the sum of two or more power series, 
each series expressed in summation (sigma) notation, to an expression with a single 	. As 
the next example illustrates, combining two or more summations as a single summation often 
requires a reindexing, that is, a shift in the index of summation.

| CHAPTER 5 Series Solutions of Linear Differential Equations
SOLUTION In order to add the two series, it is necessary that both summation indices start with 
the same number and that the powers of x in each series be “in phase”; that is, if one series starts 
with a multiple of, say, x to the first power, then we want the other series to start with the same 
power. Note that in the given problem, the first series starts with x0, whereas the second series 
starts with x1. By writing the first term of the first series outside of the summation notation, 
 
series starts with

we see that both series on the right side start with the same power of x, namely, x1. Now to 
get the same summation index we are inspired by the exponents of x; we let k  n  2 in the 
first series and at the same time let k  n  1 in the second series. The right side becomes

Remember, the summation index is a “dummy” variable; the fact that k  n  1 in one 
case and k  n  1 in the other should cause no confusion if you keep in mind that it is the 
value of the summation index that is important. In both cases k takes on the same successive 
values k  1, 2, 3, . . . when n takes on the values n  2, 3, 4, . . . for k  n  1 and 
n  0, 1, 2, . . . for k  n  1. We are now in a position to add the series in (3) term by term:

equality.
5.1.2 Power Series Solutions
 A Definition Suppose the linear second-order differential equation
 
a2(x)y  a1(x)y  a0(x)y  0 
(5)
is put into standard form
 
y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  0 
(6)
by dividing by the leading coefficient a2(x). We make the following definition.
Important.
Definition 5.1.1 
Ordinary and Singular Points
A point x0 is said to be an ordinary point of the differential equation (5) if both P(x) and Q(x) 
in the standard form (6) are analytic at x0. A point that is not an ordinary point is said to be a 
singular point of the equation.
Every finite value of x is an ordinary point of y  (e x )y  (sin x) y  0. In particular, x  0 
is an ordinary point, since, as we have already seen in (2), both ex and sin x are analytic at this 
point. The negation in the second sentence of Definition 5.1.1 stipulates that if at least one of 
the functions P(x) and Q(x) in (6) fails to be analytic at x0 , then x0 is a singular point. Note that 
x  0 is a singular point of the differential equation y  (ex)y  (ln x)y  0, since Q(x)  ln x 
is discontinuous at x  0 and so cannot be represented by a power series in x.
 Polynomial Coefficients We shall be interested primarily in the case in which (5) has 
polynomial coefficients. A polynomial is analytic at any value x, and a rational function is analytic 
except at points where its denominator is zero. Thus, if a2(x), a1(x), and a0(x) are polynomials 
with no common factors, then both rational functions P(x)  a1(x)/a2(x) and Q(x)  a0(x)/a2(x) 
are analytic except where a2(x)  0. 

5.1 Solutions about Ordinary Points 
|
265
It follows, then, that x  x0 is an ordinary point of (5) if a2(x0)  0, whereas x  x 0 is a 
singular point of (5) if a2(x0)  0.
For example, the only singular points of the equation (x2  1)y  2xy  6y  0 are solutions of 
x2  1  0 or x  1. All other finite values* of x are ordinary points. Inspection of the Cauchy–
Euler equation ax2y  bxy  cy  0 shows that it has a singular point at x  0. Singular points 
need not be real numbers. The equation (x2  1)y  xy  y  0 has singular points at the solutions 
of x2  1  0; namely, x  i. All other values of x, real or complex, are ordinary points.
We state the following theorem about the existence of power series solutions without proof.
*For our purposes, ordinary points and singular points will always be finite points. It is possible for an 
ODE to have, say, a singular point at infinity.
Theorem 5.1.1 
Existence of Power Series Solutions
If x  x0 is an ordinary point of the differential equation (5), we can always find two linearly 
independent solutions in the form of a power series centered at x0; that is, y  g
q
n0 cn(x 2 x0)n. 
A series solution converges at least on some interval defined by |x  x0|  R, where R is the 
distance from x0 to the closest singular point.
A solution of the form y  g
q
n0 cn(x 2 x0)n is said to be a solution about the ordi-
nary point x0. The distance R in Theorem 5.1.1 is the minimum value or lower bound for 
the radius of convergence. For example, the complex numbers 1  2i are singular points of 
(x2  2x  5)y  xy  y  0, but since x  0 is an ordinary point of the equation, Theorem 5.1.1 
guarantees that we can find two power series solutions centered at 0. That is, the solutions look 
like y  g
q
n0 cn x n, and, moreover, we know without actually finding these solutions that each 
series must converge at least for | x |  !5, where R  !5 is the distance in the complex plane 
from 0 to either of the numbers 1  2i or 1  2i. See FIGURE 5.1.2. However, the differential 
 equation has a solution that is valid for much larger values of x; indeed, this solution is valid 
on the interval (q, q) because it can be shown that one of the two solutions is a polynomial.
In the examples that follow, as well as in Exercises 5.1, we shall, for the sake of simplicity, 
only find power series solutions about the ordinary point x  0. If it is necessary to find a power 
series solution of an ODE about an ordinary point x0  0, we can simply make the change of 
variable t  x  x0 in the equation (this translates x  x0 to t  0), find solutions of the new 
equation of the form y  g
q
n0 cn t n, and then resubstitute t  x  x0.
Finding a power series solution of a homogeneous linear second-order ODE has been 
accurately described as “the method of undetermined series coefficients,” since the proce-
dure is quite analogous to what we did in Section 3.4. In brief, here is the idea: We substitute 
y  g
q
n0 cn x n into the differential equation, combine series as we did in Example 1, and then 
equate all coefficients to the right side of the equation to determine the coefficients cn. But since 
the right side is zero, the last step requires, by the identity property in the preceding bulleted 
list, that all coefficients of x must be equated to zero. No, this does not mean that all coefficients 
are zero; this would not make sense, because after all, Theorem 5.1.1 guarantees that we can 
find two linearly independent solutions. Example 2 illustrates how the single assumption that 
y  g
q
n0 cn x n  c0  c1x  c2x2  … leads to two sets of coefficients so that we have two 
distinct power series y1(x) and y2(x), both expanded about the ordinary point x  0. The general 
solution of the differential equation is y  C1y1(x)  C2 y2(x); indeed, if y1(0)  1, y1(0)  0, and 
y2(0)  0, y2(0)  1, then C1  c0 and C2  c1.
All the power series solutions 
will be centered at 0.

| CHAPTER 5 Series Solutions of Linear Differential Equations
Now we have already added the last two series on the right side of the equality in (7) by shift-
ing the summation index in Example 1. From the result given in (4),
 
y  xy  2c2  a
q
k1
 [(k  1)(k  2)ck  2  ck  1]x k  0. 
(8)
At this point we invoke the identity property. Since (8) is identically zero, it is necessary that 
the coefficient of each power of x be set equal to zero; that is, 2c2  0 (it is the coefficient 
of x0), and
 
(k  1)(k  2)ck  2  ck1  0,  k  1, 2, 3, . . . . 
(9)
Now 2c2  0 obviously dictates that c2  0. But the expression in (9), called a recurrence 
relation, determines the ck in such a manner that we can choose a certain subset of the set of 
coefficients to be nonzero. Since (k  1)(k  2)  0 for all values of k, we can solve (9) for 
ck  2 in terms of ck1:
 
ck2 

(k  1)(k  2), k  1, 2, 3, p  .

Since the recursive use of (10) leaves c0 and c1 completely undetermined, they can be chosen
arbitrarily. As mentioned prior to this example, the linear combination y  c0 y1(x)  c1y2(x) 
actually represents the general solution of the differential equation. Although we know from 
Theorem 5.1.1 that each series solution converges for |x|  q, this fact can also be verified 
by the ratio test.
The differential equation in Example 2 is called Airy’s equation and is named after the 
English astronomer and mathematician Sir George Biddell Airy (1801–1892). Airy’s equation 
is encountered in the study of diffraction of light, diffraction of radio waves around the surface 
of the Earth, aerodynamics, and the deflection of a uniform thin vertical column that bends under 
its own weight. Other common forms of Airy’s equation are y0  xy  0 and y0  a2xy  0. 
See Problem 46 in Exercises 5.3 for an application of the last equation. It should also be appar-
ent by making a sign change in (10) of Example 2 that the general solution of y0  xy  0 is 
y  c0y1(x)  c1y2(x), where the series solutions are in this case

If we seek a power series solution y  g

we obtain c2  c0 /2 and the recurrence relation

 ,   k  1, 2, 3, . . . .
Examination of the formula shows that the coefficients c3,  c4,  c5,  p are expressed in terms 
of both c1and c0, and moreover, the algebra required to do this becomes a little messy. To 
simplify life we can first choose c0 2 0,  c1  0; this yields consecutive coefficients for one 
solution that are expressed entirely in terms of c0. If we next choose c0  0,  c1 2 0, then the 
This formula is called a 
three-term recurrence 
relation.

coefficients for the other solution are expressed in terms of c1.  Using c2  1

the recurrence relation for k  1,  2,  3,  p gives

Each series converges for all finite values of x.
 Nonpolynomial Coefficients The next example illustrates how to find a power series 
solution about the ordinary point x0  0 of a differential equation when its coefficients are not 
polynomials. In this example we see an application of multiplication of two power  series.
EXAMPLE 5 
ODE with Nonpolynomial Coefficients
Solve y  (cos x)y  0.
SOLUTION  We see x  0 is an ordinary point of the equation because, as we have already 
seen, cos x is analytic at that point. Using the Maclaurin series for cos x given in (2), along 
with the usual assumption y  g
q

2 c0b x2  a20c5  c3 2 1
2 c1b x3  p  0.
It follows that
 
2c2  c0  0,  6c3  c1  0,  12c4  c2  1
2 c0  0,  20c5  c3  1
2 c1  0,
and so on. This gives c2  1
2 c0, c3  1
6 c1, c4  1
12 c0, c5  1
30 c1, p . By grouping terms we 
arrive at the general solution y  c0 y1(x)  c1 y2(x), where
 
y1(x)  1 2 1
2 x2  1
12 x4 2 p and y2(x)  x 2 1
6 x3  1
30 x5 2 p.
Since the differential equation has no finite singular points, both power series converge for 
|x|  q.

| CHAPTER 5 Series Solutions of Linear Differential Equations
 Solution Curves The approximate graph of a power series solution y(x)  g
q
n0 cn x n 
can be obtained in several ways. We can always resort to graphing the terms in the sequence of 
partial sums of the series, in other words, the graphs of the polynomials SN (x)  g
N
n0 cn x n. For 
large values of N, SN (x) should give us an indication of the behavior of y(x) near the ordinary 
point x  0. We can also obtain an approximate solution curve by using a numerical solver as 
we did in Section 3.7. For example, if you carefully scrutinize the series solutions of Airy’s 
equation in Example 2, you should see that y1(x) and y2(x) are, in turn, the solutions of the initial-
value problems
 
y  xy  0,  y(0)  1,  y(0)  0,
 
y  xy  0,  y(0)  0,  y(0)  1. 
(11)
The specified initial conditions “pick out” the solutions y1(x) and y2(x) from y  c0 y1(x)  c1y2(x), 
since it should be apparent from our basic series assumption y  g
q
n0 cn x n that y(0)  c0 and 
y(0)  c1. Now if your numerical solver requires a system of equations, the substitution y  u
in y  xy  0 gives y  u  xy, and so a system of two first-order equations equivalent to 
Airy’s equation is
 
y  u
 
u  xy. 
(12)
Initial conditions for the system in (12) are the two sets of initial conditions in (11) but rewritten 
as y(0)  1, u(0)  0, and y(0)  0, u(0)  1. The graphs of y1(x) and y2(x) shown in FIGURE 5.1.3 
were obtained with the aid of a numerical solver using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method 
with a step size of h  0.1.

(i) In the problems that follow, do not expect to be able to write a solution in terms of summation 
notation in each case. Even though we can generate as many terms as desired in a series solution 
y  g
q
n0 cn x
 n either through the use of a recurrence  relation or, as in Example 5, by multipli-
cation, it may not be possible to deduce any general term for the coefficients cn. We may have 
to settle, as we did in Examples 4 and 5, for just writing out the first few terms of the series.
(ii) A point x0 is an ordinary point of a nonhomogeneous linear second-order DE y  P(x)y  
Q(x)y = f (x) if P(x), Q(x), and f (x) are analytic at x0. Moreover, Theorem 5.1.1 extends to such

5.2 Solutions about Singular Points
INTRODUCTION The two differential equations y  xy  0 and xy  y  0 are similar 
only in that they are both examples of simple linear second-order DEs with variable coefficients. 
That is all they have in common. Since x  0 is an ordinary point of the first equation, we saw in 
the preceding section that there was no problem in finding two distinct power series solutions

centered at that point. In contrast, because x  0 is a singular point of the second DE, finding two 
infinite series solutions — notice we did not say “power series solutions”— of the equation about 
that point becomes a more difficult task.
 A Definition A singular point x  x0 of a linear differential equation
 
a2(x)y  a1(x)y  a0(x)y  0 
(1)
is further classified as either regular or irregular. The classification again depends on the func-
tions P and Q in the standard form
 
y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  0. 
(2)
Definition 5.2.1 
Regular/Irregular Singular Points
A singular point x0 is said to be a regular singular point of the differential equation (1) if the 
functions p(x)  (x  x0)P(x) and q(x)  (x  x0)2Q(x) are both analytic at x0. A singular point 
that is not regular is said to be an irregular singular point of the equation.
The second sentence in Definition 5.2.1 indicates that if one or both of the functions 
p(x)  (x  x0)P(x) and q(x)  (x  x0)2Q(x) fails to be analytic at x0, then x0 is an irregular 
singular point.
 Polynomial Coefficients As in Section 5.1, we are mainly interested in linear equations 
(1) where the coefficients a2(x), a1(x), and a0(x) are polynomials with no common factors. We have 
already seen that if a2(x0)  0, then x  x0 is a singular point of (1) since at least one of the rational func-
tions P(x)  a1(x)/a2(x) and Q(x)  a0(x)/a2(x) in the standard form (2) fails to be analytic at that point. 
But since a2(x) is a polynomial and x0 is one of its zeros, it follows from the Factor Theorem of algebra 
that x  x0 is a factor of a2(x). This means that after a1(x)/a2(x) and a0(x)/a2(x) are reduced to lowest 
terms, the factor x  x0 must remain, to some positive integer power, in one or both denominators. 
Now suppose that x  x0 is a singular point of (1) but that both the functions defined by the products 
p(x)  (x  x0)P(x) and q(x)  (x  x0)2Q(x) are analytic at x0. We are led to the conclusion that 
multiplying P(x) by x  x0 and Q(x) by (x  x0)2 has the effect (through cancellation) that x  x0 
no longer appears in either denominator. We can now determine whether x0 is regular by a quick 
visual check of denominators:
If x  x0 appears at most to the first power in the denominator of P(x) and at most to the 
second power in the denominator of Q(x), then x  x0 is a regular singular point.
Moreover, observe that if x  x0 is a regular singular point and we multiply (2) by (x  x0)2, then 
the original DE can be put into the form
 
(x  x0)2 y  (x  x0)p(x)y  q(x)y  0, 
(3)
where p and q are analytic at x  x0.
EXAMPLE 1 
Classification of Singular Points
It should be clear that x  2 and x  2 are singular points of
 
(x 2  4)2y  3(x  2)y  5y  0.
After dividing the equation by (x 2  4)2  (x  2)2(x  2)2 and reducing the coefficients to 
lowest terms, we find that
 
P(x) 
3
(x 2 2)(x  2)2 and Q(x) 
5
(x 2 2)2(x  2)2.
We now test P(x) and Q(x) at each singular point.
In order for x  2 to be a regular singular point, the factor x  2 can appear at most to the 
first power in the denominator of P(x) and at most to the second power in the denominator 
of Q(x). A check of the denominators of P(x) and Q(x) shows that both these conditions are 

 
5.2 Solutions about Singular Points

satisfied, so x  2 is a regular singular point. Alternatively, we are led to the same conclusion 
by noting that both rational functions
 
p(x)  (x  2)P(x)  
3
(x  2)2   and   q(x)  (x  2)2Q(x)  
5
(x  2)2
are analytic at x  2.
Now since the factor x  (2)  x  2 appears to the second power in the denominator of 
P(x), we can conclude immediately that x  2 is an irregular singular point of the equation. 
This also follows from the fact that p(x)  (x  2)P(x)  3[(x  2)(x  2)] is not analytic 
at x  2.
In Example 1, notice that since x  2 is a regular singular point, the original equation can be 
written as
 
p(x) analytic at x  2 
q(x) analytic at x  2

As another example, we can see that x  0 is an irregular singular point of x3y  2xy  
8y  0 by inspection of the denominators of P(x)  2/x 2 and Q(x)  8/x 3. On the other hand, 
x  0 is a regular singular point of xy  2xy  8y  0 since x  0 and (x  0)2 do not even 
appear in the respective denominators of P(x)  2 and Q(x)  8/x. For a singular point x  x0, 
any nonnegative power of x  x0 less than one (namely, zero) and any nonnegative power less 
than two (namely, zero and one) in the denominators of P(x) and Q(x), respectively, imply that 
x0 is a regular singular point. A singular point can be a complex number. You should verify that 
x  3i and x  3i are two regular singular points of (x 2  9)y  3xy  (1  x)y  0.
Any second-order Cauchy–Euler equation ax2y  bxy  cy  0, with a, b, and c real 
 constants, has a regular singular point at x  0. You should verify that two solutions of 
the Cauchy–Euler equation x 2 y  3xy  4y  0 on the interval (0, q) are y1  x 2 and 
y2  x 2 ln x. If we attempt to find a power series solution about the regular singular point x  0, 
namely, y  g
q
n0 cn x n, we would succeed in obtaining only the polynomial solution y1  x2. The 
fact that we would not obtain the second solution is not surprising since ln x, and consequently, 
y2  x 2 ln x is not analytic at x  0; that is, y2 does not possess a Taylor series expansion centered 
at x  0.
 Method of Frobenius To solve a differential equation (1) about a regular singular point, 
we employ the following theorem due to the eminent German mathematician Ferdinand Georg 
Frobenius (1849–1917).
Theorem 5.2.1 
Frobenius’ Theorem
If x  x0 is a regular singular point of the differential equation (1), then there exists at least 
one nonzero solution of the form
 
y  (x 2 x0)r a
q
n0
cn(x 2 x0)n  a
q
n0
cn(x 2 x0)nr, 
(4)
where the number r is a constant to be determined. The series will converge at least on some 
interval defined by 0  x  x0  R.
Notice the words at least in the first sentence of Theorem 5.2.1. This means that, in contrast 
to Theorem 5.1.1, we have no assurance that two series solutions of the type indicated in (4) can 
be found. The method of Frobenius, finding series solutions about a regular singular point x0, 
is similar to the “method of undetermined series coefficients” of the preceding section in that 
we substitute y  g
q
n0 cn(x  x0)n  r into the given differential equation and determine the 
unknown coefficients cn by a recursion relation. However, we have an additional task in this 
procedure; before determining the coefficients, we must first find the unknown exponent r. 
If r is found to be a number that is not a nonnegative integer, then the corresponding solution 
y  g
q
n0 cn (x  x0)n  r is not a power  series.

CHAPTER 5 Series Solutions of Linear Differential Equations
As we did in the discussion of solutions about ordinary points, we shall always assume, for 
the sake of simplicity in solving differential equations, that the regular singular point is x  0.
All solutions will be 
about the regular 
 singular point 0.

5.2 Solutions about Singular Points

275
Here we encounter something that did not happen when we obtained solutions about an ordi-
nary point; we have what looks to be two different sets of coefficients, but each set contains 
the same multiple c0. Omitting this term, the series solutions are

(11)
By the ratio test it can be demonstrated that both (10) and (11) converge for all finite values 
of x; that is, |x|  q. Also, it should be apparent from the form of these solutions that neither 
series is a constant multiple of the other and, therefore, y1(x) and y2(x) are linearly independent 
on the entire x-axis. Hence by the superposition principle y  C1 y1(x)  C2 y2(x) is another 
solution of (5). On any interval not containing the origin, such as (0, q), this linear combina-
tion represents the general solution of the differential equation.
 Indicial Equation Equation (6) is called the indicial equation of the problem, and 
the values r1  2
3 and r2  0 are called the indicial roots, or exponents, of the singularity x  0. 
In general, after substituting y  g
q
n0 cn x n  r into the given differential equation and simplifying, 
the indicial equation is a quadratic equation in r that results from equating the total coefficient 
of the lowest power of x to zero. We solve for the two values of r and substitute these values into 
a recurrence relation such as (7). Theorem 5.2.1 guarantees that at least one nonzero solution of 
the assumed series form can be found.
It is possible to obtain the indicial equation in advance of substituting y  g
q
n0 cn x n  r into 
the differential equation. If x  0 is a regular singular point of (1), then by Definition 5.2.1 both 
functions p(x)  xP(x) and q(x)  x 2Q(x), where P and Q are defined by the standard form (2), 
are analytic at x  0; that is, the power series expansions
 
p(x)  xP(x)  a0  a1x  a2 x 2  p  and  q(x)  x 2Q(x)  b0  b1x  b2 x 2  p 
(12)
are valid on intervals that have a positive radius of convergence. By multiplying (2) by x2, we get 
the form given in (3):
 
x 2 y  x[xP(x)]y  [x 2Q(x)]y  0. 
(13)
After substituting y  g
q
n0 cn x n  r and the two series in (12) into (13) and carrying out the 
multiplication of series, we find the general indicial equation to be
 
r (r  1)  a0r  b0  0, 
(14)
where a0 and b0 are defined in (12). See Problems 13 and 14 in Exercises 5.2.

Only One Series Solution
Solve xy  y  0.
SOLUTION  From xP(x)  0 and x2Q(x)  x and the fact that 0 and x are their own power 
 series centered at 0, we conclude a0  0 and b0  0 and so from (14) the indicial equation is 
r (r  1)  0. You should verify that the two recurrence relations corresponding to the indicial 
roots r1  1 and r2  0 yield exactly the same set of coefficients. In other words, in this case 
the method of Frobenius produces only a single series solution

 Three Cases For the sake of discussion, let us again suppose that x  0 is a regular singular 
point of equation (1) and that indicial roots r1 and r2 of the singularity are real, with r1 denoting 
the largest root. When using the method of Frobenius, we distinguish three cases corresponding 
to the nature of the indicial roots r1 and r2.

 
Case I: 
 If r1 and r2 are distinct and do not differ by an integer, there exist two linearly 
independent solutions of the form
y1(x)  a
q
n0
cn x
 nr1 and y2(x)  a
q
n0
bn x
 nr2.
This is the case illustrated in Examples 2 and 3.
In the next case, we see that when the difference of indicial roots r1  r2 is a positive 
integer, the second solution may contain a logarithm.
 
Case II:  If r1  r2  N, where N is a positive integer, then there exist two linearly 
independent solutions of equation (1) of the form
 
 y1(x)  a
q
n0
cn x
 nr1, c0 Z 0, 
(19)
 
 y2(x)  Cy1(x) ln x  a
q
n0
bn x
 nr2, b0 Z 0, 
(20)
where C is a constant that could be zero.
Finally, in the last case, the case when the indicial roots r1 and r2 are equal, a second solution 
will always contain a logarithm. The situation is analogous to the solution of a Cauchy–Euler 
equation when the roots of the auxiliary equation are equal.
 
Case III:  If r1  r2, then there always exist two linearly independent solutions of equa-
tion (1) of the form
 
 y1(x)  a
q
n0
cn x
 nr1, c0 2 0, 
(21)
 
 y2(x)  y1(x) ln x  a
q
n0
bn x
 nr2. 
(22)
 Finding a Second Solution When the difference r1  r2 is a positive integer (Case II), 
we may or may not be able to find two solutions having the form y  g
q
n0 cn x n  r. This is some-
thing we do not know in advance but is determined after we have found the indicial roots and have 
carefully examined the recurrence relation that defines the coefficients cn. We just may be lucky 
enough to find two solutions that involve only powers of x; that is, y1(x)  g
q
n0 cn x n  r1 (equa-
tion (19)) and y2  g
q
n0 bn x n  r2 (equation (20) with C  0). See Problem 31 in Exercises 5.2. 
On the other hand, in Example 4 we see that the difference of indicial roots is a positive integer 
(r1  r2  1) and the method of Frobenius failed to give a second series solution. In this situ-
ation, equation (20), with C  0, indicates what the second solution looks like. Finally, when 
the difference r1  r2 is a zero (Case III), the method of Frobenius fails to give a second series 
solution; the second solution (22) always contains a logarithm and is actually (20) with C  1. 
One way to obtain this second solution with the logarithmic term is to use the fact that 
 
y2(x)  y1(x)#
eeP(x) dx
y2
1(x)  dx 
(23)
is also a solution of y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  0 whenever y1(x) is the known solution. We will 
 illustrate how to use (23) in the next example.
This is (5) in Section 3.2.

REMARKS
(i) The three different forms of a linear second-order differential equation in (1), (2), and (3) 
were used to discuss various theoretical concepts. But on a practical level, when it comes to 
actually solving a differential equation using the method of Frobenius, it is advisable to work 
with the form of the DE given in (1).
(ii) When the difference of indicial roots r1  r2 is a positive integer (r1  r2), it sometimes 
pays to iterate the recurrence relation using the smaller root r2 first. See Problems 31 and 32 
in Exercises 5.2.
(iii) Since an indicial root r is a root of a quadratic equation, it could be complex. We shall 
not, however, investigate this case.
(iv) If x  0 is an irregular singular point, we may not be able to find any solution of the DE 
of form y  g

Mathematical Model
 34. Buckling of a Tapered Column  In Example 4 of Section 3.9, 
we saw that when a constant vertical compressive force or 
load P was applied to a thin column of uniform cross section, 
the deflection y(x) satisfied the boundary-value problem
 
EI d 2y
dx 2  Py  0,   y(0)  0,   y(L)  0.
 
 The assumption here is that the column is hinged at both ends. 
The column will buckle or deflect only when the compressive 
force is a critical load Pn.
(a) In this problem let us assume that the column is of length L, 
is hinged at both ends, has circular cross sections, and 
is tapered as shown in FIGURE 5.2.1(a). If the column, a 
truncated cone, has a linear taper y  cx as shown in 
cross section in Figure 5.2.1(b), the moment of inertia of 
a cross section with respect to an axis perpendicular to 
the xy-plane is I  1
4 pr4, where r  y and y  cx. Hence 
we can write I(x)  I0(x/b)4, where I0  I(b)  1
4 p (cb)4. 
Substituting I(x) into the differential equation in (24), we see 
that the deflection in this case is determined from the BVP
 
x4 d 2y
dx 2  ly  0,  y(a)  0,  y(b)  0,
 
where l  Pb4/EI0. Use the results of Problem 33 to find 
the critical loads Pn for the tapered column. Use an 
 appropriate identity to express the buckling modes yn(x) 
as a single function.
(b) Use a CAS to plot the graph of the first buckling mode y1(x) 
corresponding to the Euler load P1 when b  11 and a  1.

often arise in the advanced studies of applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. Equation 
(1) is called Bessel’s equation of order n and is named after the noted German astronomer and 
mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784–1846), who was the first person to determine 
the accurate distance from the Sun to another star. Bessel first encountered a special form of 
equation (1) in his study of elliptical planetary motion and eventually carried out a systematic 
study of the properties of the solutions of the general equation. Differential equation (2) is known 
as Legendre’s equation of order n and is named after the French mathematician Adrien-Marie 
Legendre (1752–1833). When we solve (1), we will assume that n  0; whereas in (2), we will 
consider only the case where n is a nonnegative integer.
5.3.1 Bessel Functions

that there exists at least one solution of the form y5g

From (3) we see that the indicial equation is r 2  n2  0 so that the indicial roots are r1  n and

Therefore, by the usual argument we can write (1  2n)c1  0 and

It is standard practice to choose c0 to be a specific value—namely,
 
c0 

2nG(1  n)
 ,
where 	(1  n) is the gamma function. See Appendix II. Since this latter function possesses the 
convenient property 	(1  a)  a	(a), we can reduce the indicated product in the denominator 
of (6) to one term. For example,
 
	(1  n  1)  (1  n)	(1  n)
 
	(1  n  2)  (2  n)	(2  n)  (2  n)(1  n)	(1  n).
Hence we can write (6) as

(7)
If n  0, the series converges at least on the interval [0, q). Also, for the second exponent r2  n 
we obtain, in exactly the same manner,
 
Jn(x)  a
q
n0
 
(1)n
n!G(1 2 n  n)

(8)
The functions Jn(x) and Jn(x) are called Bessel functions of the first kind of order n and n, 
respectively. Depending on the value of n, (8) may contain negative powers of x and hence 
converge on the interval (0, q).*
Now some care must be taken in writing the general solution of (1). When n  0, it is appar-
ent that (7) and (8) are the same. If n 
 0 and r1  r2  n  (n)  2n is not a  positive integer, 
it follows from Case I of Section 5.2 that Jn(x) and Jn(x) are linearly  independent solutions of 
(1) on (0, q), and so the general solution on the interval is y  c1Jn(x)  c2Jn(x). But we also 
know from Case II of Section 5.2 that when r1  r2  2n is a positive integer, a second series solu-
tion of (1) may exist. In this second case we distinguish two possibilities. When n  m  positive 
integer, Jm(x) defined by (8) and Jm(x) are not linearly independent solutions. It can be shown 
that Jm is a constant multiple of Jm (see Property (i) on page 284). In addition, r1  r2  2n can 
be a positive integer when n is half an odd positive integer. It can be shown in this latter event that 
Jn(x) and Jn(x) are linearly independent. In other words, the general solution of (1) on (0, q) is
 
y  c1Jn(x)  c2Jn(x), n  integer.

CHAPTER 5  Series Solutions of Linear Differential Equations
EXAMPLE 1 
General Solution: n Not an Integer
By identifying n2  1
4 and n  1
2 we can see from (9) that the general solution of the equation 
x2y  xy  (x2  1
4)y  0 on (0, q) is y  c1J1/2(x)  c2J1/2(x). 
 Bessel Functions of the Second Kind If n  integer, the function defined by the 
linear combination
 
Yn(x)  
 cos npJn(x) 2 Jn(x)
 sin np
 
(10)
and the function Jn(x) are linearly independent solutions of (1). Thus another form of the general 
solution of (1) is y  c1Jn(x)  c2Yn(x), provided n  integer. As n S m, m an integer, (10) has 
the indeterminate form 0/0. However, it can be shown by L’Hôpital’s rule that limnSm Yn(x) 
exists. Moreover, the function
 
Ym(x)  lim
nSmYn(x)
and Jm(x) are linearly independent solutions of x2y  xy  (x2  m2)y  0. Hence for any value 
of n the general solution of (1) on the interval (0, q) can be written as
 
y  c1Jn(x)  c2Yn(x). 
(11)
Yn(x) is called the Bessel function of the second kind of order n. FIGURE 5.3.2 shows the graphs 
of Y0(x) (blue) and Y1(x) (red).
EXAMPLE 2 
General Solution: n an Integer
By identifying n2  9 and n  3 we see from (11) that the general solution of the equation 
x2y  xy  (x2  9)y  0 on (0, q) is y  c1J3(x)  c2Y3(x). 
 DEs Solvable in Terms of Bessel Functions Sometimes it is possible to transform 
a differential equation into equation (1) by means of a change of variable. We can then  express 
the solution of the original equation in terms of Bessel functions. For example, if we let t  ax, 
a 
 0, in
 
x2y  xy  (a2x2  n2)y  0, 
(12)
then by the Chain Rule,

Accordingly (12) becomes

dt  (t 2 2 n2)y  0 or t 2 d

 2  t dy
dt  (t
 2 2 n 2 )y  0.
The last equation is Bessel’s equation of order n with solution y  c1Jn(t)  c2Yn(t). By 
resubstituting t  ax in the last expression we find that the general solution of (12) on the 
interval (0, q) is
 
y  c1Jn(ax)  c2Yn(ax). 
(13)
Equation (12), called the parametric Bessel equation of order n, and its general solution (13) 
are very important in the study of certain boundary-value problems involving partial differential 
equations that are expressed in cylindrical coordinates.

 Modified Bessel Functions Another equation that bears a resemblance to (1) is the 
modified Bessel equation of order n,
x2y  xy  (x2  n2)y  0. 
(14)
This DE can be solved in the manner just illustrated for (12). This time if we let t  ix, where 
i2  1, then (14) becomes
 
t 2 d
 2y
dt
 2  t dy
dt  (t
 2 2 n 2)y  0.
Since solutions of the last DE are Jn(t) and Yn(t), complex-valued solutions of equation (14) are 
Jn(ix) and Yn(ix). A real-valued solution, called the modified Bessel function of the first kind 
of order n, is defined in terms of Jn(ix):
 
In (x)  inJn (ix). 
See Problem 21 in Exercises 5.3. The general solution of (14) is
 
y  c1In(x)  c2In(x), n  integer. 
(15)
When n is an integer n the functions In(x) and In (x) are not linearly independent on the interval 
(0, q). So, analogous to (10), we define the modified Bessel function of the second kind of 
order n  integer to be
 
Kn (x)  p
2 In (x) 2 In (x)
 sin np
, 
(16)
and for integral n  n,
 
Kn(x)  lim
nSn Kn (x).
Because In and Kn are linearly independent on the interval (0, q) for any value of n, the general 
solution of (14) is
 
y  c1 In (x)  c2Kn (x). 
(17)
The graphs of I0(x) (blue) and I1(x) (red) are given in FIGURE 5.3.3 and the graphs K0(x) (blue) 
and K1(x) (red) are shown in FIGURE 5.3.4. Unlike the Bessel functions of the first and second 
kinds, the graphs of the modified Bessel functions of the first kind and second kind are not 
oscillatory. Moreover, the graphs in Figures 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 illustrate the fact that the modified 
Bessel functions In(x) and Kn(x), n  0, 1, 2, . . . have no real zeros in the interval (0, q). Also, 
note that Kn(x) S q as x S 0.
Proceeding as we did in (12) and (13), we see that the general solution of the parametric 
form of the modified Bessel equation of order n
 
x2y  xy  (a2x2  n2)y  0 
(18)
on the interval (0, q) is
 
y  c1In(a x)  c2Kn(a x). 
(19)
EXAMPLE 3 
Parametric Modified Bessel Equation
By identifying a2  25, n2  4, a  5, and n  2 it follows from (19) that the general solution 
of the equation x2y0  xy9 2 (25x2  4)y  0 on (0, q) is y  c1I2(5x)  c2K2(5x).

equations are satisfied by taking b  6 and p  2. From (21) we find that the general solution

EXAMPLE 5 
The Aging Spring Revisited
Recall that in Section 3.8 we saw that one mathematical model for the free undamped motion 
of a mass on an aging spring is given by mx  keatx  0, a  0. We are now in a position 
to find the general solution of the equation. It is left as a problem to show that the change of 
variables s  2
aÅ
k
m eat/2 transforms the differential equation of the aging spring into
 
s2 d
 2x
ds
 2  s dx
ds  s2x  0.
The last equation is recognized as (1) with n  0 and where the symbols x and s play the roles 
of y and x, respectively. The general solution of the new equation is x  c1J0(s)  c2Y0(s). If 
we resubstitute s, then the general solution of mx  keatx  0 is seen to be
 
x(t)  c1J0 a2
a Å
k
m eat/2b  c2Y0 a2
a Å
k
m eat/2b.
See Problems 33 and 45 in Exercises 5.3. 
The other model discussed in Section 5.1 of a spring whose characteristics change with time 
was mx  ktx  0. By dividing through by m we see that the equation x   (k/m) tx  0 is Airy’s 
equation, y  a2xy  0. See the discussion following Example 2 in Section 5.1. The general 
solution of Airy’s differential equation can also be written in terms of Bessel functions. See 
Problems 34, 35, and 46 in Exercises 5.3.
 Properties We list below a few of the more useful properties of Bessel functions of the 
first and second kinds of order m, m  0, 1, 2, . . . :
 
(i) Jm(x)  (1)mJm(x)

Note that Property (ii) indicates that Jm(x) is an even function if m is an even integer and an odd 
function if m is an odd integer. The graphs of Y0(x) and Y1(x) in Figure 5.3.2 illustrate Property (iv): 
Ym(x) is unbounded at the origin. This last fact is not obvious from (10). The solutions of the Bessel

The result in Example 6 can be written in an alternative form. Dividing xJn(x)  nJn(x) 

Jn(x)  n

This last expression is recognized as a linear first-order differential equation in Jn(x). Multiplying 
both sides of the equality by the integrating factor x then yields

It can be shown in a similar manner that

See Problem 27 in Exercises 5.3. The differential recurrence relations (22) and (23) are also valid

The function jn(x) is called the spherical Bessel function of the first kind and yn(x) is the 
spherical Bessel function of the second kind. For example, by using (26) and (29) we see that

5.3 Special Functions

Since we know that a constant multiple of a solution of Legendre’s equation is also a solution, 
it is traditional to choose specific values for c0 or c1, depending on whether n is an even or odd 
positive integer, respectively. For n  0 we choose c0  1, and for n  2, 4, 6, . . . ,

 Legendre Polynomials These specific nth-degree polynomial solutions are called 
Legendre polynomials and are denoted by Pn(x). From the series for y1(x) and y2(x) and from 
the above choices of c0 and c1 we find that the first six Legendre polynomials are
 
P0(x)  1, 
P1(x)  x,

(iii) Pn(1)  (1)n
 
(iv) Pn(0)  0, n odd 
(v) Pn(0)  0, n even.

ing to whether n is even or odd.
 Recurrence Relation Recurrence relations that relate Legendre polynomials of differ-
ent degrees are also important in some aspects of their applications. We state, without proof, the 
following three-term recurrence relation

which is valid for k  1, 2, 3, … . In (34) we listed the first six Legendre polynomials. If, say, we 
wish to find P6(x), we can use (36) with k  5. This relation expresses P6(x) in terms of the known 
P4(x) and P5(x). See Problem 51 in Exercises 5.3.

REMARKS
Although we have assumed that the parameter n in Legendre’s differential equation
 
(1  x2)y  2xy  n(n  1)y  0
represented a nonnegative integer, in a more general setting n can represent any real number. 
If n is not a nonnegative integer, then both Legendre functions y1(x) and y2(x) given in (33) are 
infinite series convergent on the open interval (–1, 1) and divergent (unbounded) at x  1. If 
n is a nonnegative integer, then as we have just seen one of the Legendre functions in (33) is a 
polynomial and the other is an infinite series convergent for 1  x  1. You should be 
aware of the fact that Legendre’s equation possesses solutions that are bounded on the closed 
interval [–1, 1] only in the case when n  0, 1, 2, … . More to the point, the only Legendre 
functions that are bounded on the closed interval [–1, 1] are the Legendre polynomials Pn(x) 
or constant multiples of these polynomials. See Problem 53 in Exercises 5.3 and Problem 24 
in Chapter 5 in Review.

 47. Column Bending Under Its Own Weight  A uniform thin col-
umn of length L, positioned vertically with one end embedded 
in the ground, will deflect, or bend away, from the vertical 
under the influence of its own weight when its length or height 
exceeds a certain critical value. It can be shown that the an-
gular deflection u(x) of the column from the vertical at a point 
P(x) is a solution of the boundary-value problem

of inertia, d is the constant linear density, and x is the 
distance along the column measured from its base. See 
FIGURE 5.3.8.
 
   The column will bend only for those values of L for which 
the boundary-value problem has a nontrivial solution.
(a) Restate the boundary-value problem by making the 
change of variables t  L  x. Then use the results of 
a problem earlier in this exercise set to express the gen-
eral solution of the differential equation in terms of 
Bessel functions.

the BVP and an equation that defines the critical length L,
that is, the smallest value of L for which the column will start 
to bend.

 48. Buckling of a Thin Vertical Column In Example 4 of 
Section 3.9 we saw that when a constant vertical compressive

tion of the BVP:
 
EI d 2y
dx 2  Py  0, y(0)  0, y(L)  0.
(a) If the bending stiffness factor EI is proportional to x, then 
EI(x)  kx, where k is a constant of proportionality. If 
EI(L)  kL  M is the maximum stiffness factor, then 
k  M/L and so EI(x)  Mx/L. Use the information in 
Problem 37 to find a solution of

sponding to the Euler load P1. For simplicity assume that 
c1  1 and L  1.

in a vertical plane, the mass m can be raised or lowered. In other 
words, the length l(t) of the pendulum varies with time. Under 
the same assumptions leading to equation (6) in Section 3.11, 
it follows from (1) in Chapter 3 in Review that the differential 
equation for the displacement angle u(t) is now

A differential equation need not 
possess a solution. But even when 
a solution exists, we may not be 
able to exhibit it in an explicit or 
implicit form—we may have to be 
content with an approximation 
to the solution. In this chapter 
we continue the basic idea 
introduced in Section 2.6, that 
is, using the differential 
equation to construct algorithms 
to approximate the y-coordinates 
of the points on an actual 
solution curve.

Euler Methods and Error Analysis
INTRODUCTION In Section 2.6 we examined one of the simplest numerical methods for 
approximating solutions of first-order initial-value problems y  f (x, y), y(x0)  y0. Recall that 
the backbone of Euler’s method was the formula
 
yn1  yn  h f (xn, yn), 
(1)
where f is the function obtained from the differential equation y  f (x, y). The recursive use 
of (1) for n  0, 1, 2, . . . yields the y-coordinates y1, y2, y3, . . . of points on successive “tangent 
lines” to the solution curve at x1, x2, x3, . . . or xn  x0  nh, where h is a constant and is the size 
of the step between xn and xn  1. The values y1, y2, y3, . . . approximate the values of a solution 
y(x) of the IVP at x1, x2, x3, . . . . But whatever advantage (1) has in its simplicity is lost in the 
crudeness of its approximations.
 A Comparison In Problem 4 in Exercises 2.6 you were asked to use Euler’s method to 
obtain the approximate value of y(1.5) for the solution of the initial-value problem y  2xy, 
y(1)  1. You should have obtained the analytic solution y  ex221 and results similar to those 
given in Tables 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.

TABLE 6.1.2 Euler’s Method with h  0.05
In this case, with a step size h  0.1, a 16% relative error in the calculation of the approxi-
mation to y(1.5) is totally unacceptable. At the expense of doubling the number of calculations, 
some improvement in accuracy is obtained by halving the step size to h  0.05.
 Errors in Numerical Methods In choosing and using a numerical method for the so-
lution of an initial-value problem, we must be aware of the various sources of errors. For some 
kinds of computation the accumulation of errors might reduce the accuracy of an approxima-
tion to the point of making the computation useless. On the other hand, depending on the use to 
which a numerical solution may be put, extreme accuracy may not be worth the added expense 
and complication.
One source of error always present in calculations is round-off error. This error results from 
the fact that any calculator or computer can represent numbers using only a finite number of 
digits. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that we have a calculator that uses base 10 arithmetic 
and carries four digits, so that 1
3 is represented in the calculator as 0.3333 and 1
9 is represented as 
0.1111. If we use this calculator to compute (x2  1
9)(x  1
3) for x  0.3334, we obtain
 
(0.3334)2 2 0.1111
0.3334 2 0.3333
 0.1112 2 0.1111
0.3334 2 0.3333  1.

With the help of a little algebra, however, we see that

x 2 1

 (x 2 1
3)(x  1
3)
x 2 1

 x  1

so that when x  0.3334, (x2  1
9)(x  1
3)  0.3334  0.3333  0.6667. This example shows that 
the effects of round-off error can be quite serious unless some care is taken. One way to reduce 
the effect of round-off error is to minimize the number of calculations. Another technique on a 
computer is to use double-precision arithmetic to check the results. In general, round-off error 
is unpredictable and difficult to analyze, and we will neglect it in the error analysis that follows. 
We will concentrate on investigating the error introduced by using a formula or algorithm to 
approximate the values of the solution.
 Truncation Errors for Euler’s Method In the sequence of values y1, y2, y3, . . . generated 
from (1), usually the value of y1 will not agree with the actual solution evaluated at x1, namely, 
y(x1), because the algorithm gives only a straight-line approximation to the solution. See 
Figure 2.6.2. The error is called the local truncation error, formula error, or discretization 
error. It occurs at each step; that is, if we assume that yn is accurate, then yn  1 will contain a 
local truncation error.
To derive a formula for the local truncation error for Euler’s method, we use Taylor’s formula 
with remainder. If a function y(x) possesses k  1 derivatives that are continuous on an open 
interval containing a and x, then
 
y(x)  y(a)  y(a) x 2 a
1!
 p  y(k)(a) (x 2 a)k
k!
 y(k1)(c) (x 2 a)k1
(k  1)! ,
where c is some point between a and x. Setting k  1, a  xn, and x  xn  1  xn  h, we get
 
y(xn  1)  y(xn)  y(xn) h
1!  y(c) h2
2!   or   y(xn  1)  yn  hf ( xn, yn)  y(c) h2
2!.
  
yn1
Euler’s method (1) is the last formula without the last term; hence the local truncation error in 
yn  1 is
 
y(c) h2
2!   where   xn  c  xn  1.
The value of c is usually unknown (it exists theoretically), and so the exact error cannot be cal-
culated, but an upper bound on the absolute value of the error is
 
M h2
2! where M 
max
xn,x,xn  1
|y0(x)|.
In discussing errors arising from the use of numerical methods, it is helpful to use the notation 
O(hn). To define this concept we let e(h) denote the error in a numerical calculation depending on h.
Then e(h) is said to be of order hn, denoted by O(hn), if there is a constant C and a positive integer n 
such that |e(h)|  Chn for h is sufficiently small. Thus the local truncation error for Euler’s method 
is O(h2). We note that, in general, if e(h) in a numerical method is of order hn, and h is halved, 
the new error is approximately C(h/2)n  Chn/2n; that is, the error is reduced by a factor of (1
2)n.
EXAMPLE 1 
Bound for Local Truncation Error
Find a bound for the local truncation errors for Euler’s method applied to y  2xy, y(1)  1.
SOLUTION From the solution y  ex221 we get y  (2  4x 2)ex221, and so the local trun-
cation error is
 
y(c) h2
2   (2  4c2)e(c221) h2
2 ,

CHAPTER 6 Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations
where c is between xn and xn  h. In particular, for h  0.1 we can get an upper bound on the 
local truncation error for y1 by replacing c by 1.1:
 
[2  (4)(1.1)2]e((1.1)221) (0.1)2
2
  0.0422.
From Table 6.1.1 we see that the error after the first step is 0.0337, less than the value given 
by the bound.
Similarly, we can get a bound for the local truncation error for any of the five steps given 
in Table 6.1.1 by replacing c by 1.5 (this value of c gives the largest value of y(c) for any of 
the steps and may be too generous for the first few steps). Doing this gives
 
[2  (4)(1.5)2]e((1.5)221) (0.1)2
2
  0.1920 
(2)
as an upper bound for the local truncation error in each step.
Note in Example 1 that if h is halved to 0.05, then the error bound is 0.0480, about one-fourth 
as much as shown in (2). This is expected because the local truncation error for Euler’s method 
is O(h2).
In the above analysis we assumed that the value of yn was exact in the calculation of yn  1, but 
it is not because it contains local truncation errors from previous steps. The total error in yn  1 is 
an accumulation of the errors in each of the previous steps. This total error is called the global 
truncation error. A complete analysis of the global truncation error is beyond the scope of this 
text, but it can be shown that the global truncation error for Euler’s method is O(h).
We expect that, for Euler’s method, if the step size is halved the error will be approximately 
halved as well. This is borne out in Tables 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, where the absolute error at x  1.50 
with h  0.1 is 0.5625 and with h  0.05 is 0.3171, approximately half as large.
In general it can be shown that if a method for the numerical solution of a differential equation 
has local truncation error O(ha  1), then the global truncation error is O(ha).
For the remainder of this section and in the subsequent sections we study methods that give 
significantly greater accuracy than Euler’s method.
 Improved Euler’s Method The numerical method defined by the formula
 
 yn1  yn  h f (xn, yn)  f (xn1, y*n1)
2
, 
(3)
where 
y*n1  yn  h f (xn, yn), 
(4)
is commonly known as the improved Euler’s method. In order to compute yn1 for n  0, 1, 
2, . . . , from (3) we must, at each step, first use Euler’s method (4) to obtain an initial estimate 
y*n1. For example, with n  0, (4) would give y*1  y0  hf (x0, y0), and then knowing this value 
we use (3) to get y1  y0  h(   f ( x0, y0)  f ( x1, y*1 ))2, where x1  x0  h. These equations can 
be readily visualized. In FIGURE 6.1.1 observe that m0  f ( x0, y0) and m1  f (x1, y*1) are slopes 
of the solid straight lines shown passing through the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y*1), respectively. 
By taking an average of these slopes, that is, mave  (  f ( x0, y0)  f (x1, y*1 ))2, we obtain the 
slope of the parallel dashed skew lines. With the first step, rather than advancing along the line 
through (x0, y0) with slope f ( x0, y0) to the point with y-coordinate y*1 obtained by Euler’s method, 
we advance instead along the red dashed line through (x0, y0) with slope mave until we reach x1. 
It seems plausible from inspection of the figure that y1 is an improvement over y*1.
In general, the improved Euler’s method is an example of a predictor–corrector method. 
The value of y*n1 given by (4) predicts a value of y(xn), whereas the value of yn  1 defined by 
formula (3) corrects this estimate.

TABLE 6.1.4 Improved Euler’s Method with h  0.05
A brief word of caution is in order here. We cannot compute all the values of y*n first and then 
substitute these values into formula (3). In other words, we cannot use the data in Table 6.1.1 to 
help construct the values in Table 6.1.3. Why not?
 Truncation Errors for the Improved Euler’s Method The local truncation error 
for the improved Euler’s method is O(h3). The derivation of this result is similar to the derivation 
of the local truncation error for Euler’s method. Since the local truncation error for the improved 
Euler’s method is O(h3), the global truncation error is O(h2). This can be seen in Example 2; 
when the step size is halved from h  0.1 to h  0.05, the absolute error at x  1.50 is reduced 
from 0.0394 to 0.0108, a reduction of approximately ( 1
2)2  1

Note that we can’t compute 
all the y*n ﬁ rst.
Given the initial-value problems in Problems 1–10, use the 
improved Euler’s method to obtain a four-decimal approxima-
tion to the indicated value. First use h  0.1 and then use 
h  0.05.

Use the improved Euler’s method with h  0.1 and h  0.05 
to obtain approximate values of the solution at x  0.5. At 
each step compare the approximate value with the exact value 
of the analytic solution.
 12. Although it may not be obvious from the differential equa-
tion, its solution could “behave badly” near a point x at 
which we wish to approximate y(x). Numerical procedures 
may give widely differing results near this point. Let y(x) 
be the solution of the initial-value problem y  x2  y3, 
y(1)  1.
(a) Use a numerical solver to obtain the graph of the solution 
on the interval [1, 1.4].
(b) Using the step size h  0.1, compare the results obtained 
from Euler’s method with the results from the improved 
Euler’s method in the approximation of y(1.4).

6.2 Runge–Kutta Methods
INTRODUCTION Probably one of the more popular, as well as most accurate, numerical 
procedures used in obtaining approximate solutions to a first-order initial-value problem 
y  f ( x, y), y(x0)  y0, is the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. As the name suggests, there 
are Runge–Kutta methods of different orders.
 Runge–Kutta Methods Fundamentally, all Runge–Kutta methods are generalizations 
of the basic Euler formula (1) of Section 6.1 in that the slope function f is replaced by a weighted 
average of slopes over the interval defined by xn  x  xn  1. That is,
 
weighted average
 
 
yn1  yn  h(w1k1  w2k2  p  wmkm). 
(1)
Here the weights wi, i  1, 2, . . . , m are constants that generally satisfy w1  w2  . . .  wm  1 
and each ki, i  1, 2, . . . , m is the function f evaluated at a selected point (x, y) for which xn  x  xn  1. 
We shall see that the ki are defined recursively. The number m is called the order of the method. 
Observe that by taking m  1, w1  1, and k1  f ( xn, yn) we get the familiar Euler formula 
yn  1  yn  hf ( xn, yn). Hence Euler’s method is said to be a first-order Runge–Kutta method.
The average in (1) is not formed willy-nilly, but parameters are chosen so that (1) agrees with 
a Taylor polynomial of degree m. As we have seen in the last section, if a function y(x) possesses 
k  1 derivatives that are continuous on an open interval containing a and x, then we can write
 
y(x)  y(a)  y9(a) x 2 a
1!
 y0(a) (x 2 a)2
2!
 p  y(k1)(c) (x 2 a)k1
(k  1)! ,
where c is some number between a and x. If we replace a by xn and x by xn  1  xn  h, then the 
foregoing formula becomes
 
y(xn1)  y(xn  h)  y(xn)  hy9(xn)  h2
2! y0(xn)  p 
hk1
(k  1)! y(k1)(c),

 
6.2 Runge–Kutta Methods 
| 303
where c is now some number between xn and xn  1. When y(x) is a solution of y  f ( x, y), in the 
case k  1 and the remainder 1
2h2y(c) is small, we see that a Taylor polynomial y(xn  1)  y(xn)  hy(xn) 
of degree 1 agrees with the approximation formula of Euler’s method
 
yn1  yn  hyn9  yn  hf (xn, yn).
 A Second-Order Runge–Kutta Method To further illustrate (1), we consider now 
a second-order Runge–Kutta method. This consists of finding constants, or parameters, w1, 
w2, a, and b so that the formula
 
yn  1  yn  h(w1k1  w2k2), 
(2)
where 
k1  f ( xn, yn),
 
k2  f ( xn  ah, yn  bhk1)
agrees with a Taylor polynomial of degree 2. For our purposes it suffices to say that this can be 
done whenever the constants satisfy
 
w1  w2  1, w2a  1
2, and w2 b  1
2. 
(3)
This is an algebraic system of three equations in four unknowns and has infinitely many solutions:
 
w1  1 2 w2, a 
1
2w2
, and b 
1
2w2
, 
(4)
where w2 	 0. For example, the choice w2  1
2 yields w1  1
2, a  1, b  1 and so (2) becomes
 
yn1  yn  h
2 (k1  k2),
where 
k1  f (xn, yn) and k2  f (xn  h, yn  hk1).
Since xn  h  xn1 and yn  hk1  yn  h f (xn, yn) the foregoing result is recognized to be the 
improved Euler’s method that is summarized in (3) and (4) of Section 6.1.
In view of the fact that w2 	 0 can be chosen arbitrarily in (4), there are many possible second-
order Runge–Kutta methods. See Problem 2 in Exercises 6.2.
We shall skip any discussion of third-order methods in order to come to the principal point of 
discussion in this section.
 A Fourth-Order Runge–Kutta Method A fourth-order Runge–Kutta procedure 
consists of finding parameters so that the formula
 
yn1  yn  h(w1k1  w2k2  w3k3  w4k4), 
(5)
where 
k1  f ( xn, yn)
 
k2  f ( xn  a1h, yn  b1hk1)
 
k3  f ( xn  a2h, yn  b2hk1  b3hk2)
 
k4  f ( xn  a3h, yn  b4hk1  b5hk2  b6hk3)
agrees with a Taylor polynomial of degree 4. This results in a system of 11 equations in 13 un-
knowns. The most commonly used set of values for the parameters yields the following result:
 
yn  1  yn  h
6 (k1  2k2  2k3  k4),
 
k1  f ( xn , yn)
 
k2  f ( xn  1
2h, yn  1
2hk1) 
(6)
 
k3  f ( xn  1
2h, yn  1
2hk2)
 
k4  f ( xn  h, yn  hk3).

CHAPTER 6 Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations
While other fourth-order formulas are easily derived, the algorithm summarized in (6) is so 
widely used and recognized as a valuable computational tool it is often referred to as the fourth-
order Runge–Kutta method or the classical Runge–Kutta method. It is (6) that we have in mind, 
hereafter, when we use the abbreviation “the RK4 method.”
You are advised to look carefully at the formulas in (6); note that k2 depends on k1, k3 depends 
on k2, and k4 depends on k3. Also, k2 and k3 involve approximations to the slope at the midpoint 
xn  1
2h of the interval [xn , xn  1].
EXAMPLE 1 
RK4 Method
Use the RK4 method with h  0.1 to obtain an approximation to y(1.5) for the solution of 
y  2xy, y(1)  1.
SOLUTION For the sake of illustration, let us compute the case when n  0. From (6) we find
 
k1  f ( x0, y0)  2x0y0  2
 
k2  f ( x0  1
2(0.1), y0  1
2(0.1)2)
 
  2(x0  1
2(0.1))( y0  1
2(0.2))  2.31
 
k3  f ( x0  1
2(0.1), y0  1
2(0.1)2.31)
 
  2(x0  1
2(0.1))( y0  1
2(0.231))  2.34255
 
k4  f ( x0  (0.1), y0  (0.1)2.34255)
 
  2(x0  0.1)( y0  0.234255)  2.715361
and therefore
 
y1  y0  0.1
6  (k1  2k2  2k3  k4)
 
  1  0.1
6   (2  2(2.31)  2(2.34255)  2.715361)  1.23367435.
The remaining calculations are summarized in Table 6.2.1, whose entries are rounded to four 
decimal places.
Inspection of Table 6.2.1 shows why the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is so popular. 
If four-decimal-place accuracy is all that we desire, there is no need to use a smaller step 
size. Table 6.2.2 compares the results of applying Euler’s, the improved Euler’s, and the 
fourth-order Runge–Kutta methods to the initial-value problem y  2xy, y(1)  1. See 
Tables 6.1.1–6.1.4.

 Truncation Errors for the RK4 Method In Section 6.1 we saw that global trunca-
tion errors for Euler’s method and for the improved Euler’s method are, respectively, O(h) and 
O(h2). Because the first equation in (6) agrees with a Taylor polynomial of degree 4, the local 
truncation error for this method is y(5)(c)h5/5! or O(h5), and the global truncation error is thus 
O(h4). It is now obvious why Euler’s method, the improved Euler’s method, and (6) are first-,
second-, and fourth-order Runge–Kutta methods, respectively.
*The Runge–Kutta method of order four used in RKF45 is not the same as that given in (6).
EXAMPLE 2 
Bound for Local Truncation Errors
Find a bound for the local truncation errors for the RK4 method applied to y  2xy, y(1)  1.
SOLUTION By computing the fifth derivative of the known solution y(x)  ex221 we get
 
y(5)(c) h5
5!  (120c  160c3  32c5 )ec221 h5
5! . 
(7)
Thus with c  1.5, (7) yields a bound of 0.00028 on the local truncation error for each of 
the five steps when h  0.1. Note that in Table 6.2.1 the error in y1 is much less than this 
bound.
Table 6.2.3 gives the approximations to the solution of the initial-value problem at x  1.5 
that are obtained from the RK4 method. By computing the value of the analytic solution at 
x  1.5 we can find the error in these approximations. Because the method is so accurate, 
many decimal places must be used in the numerical solution to see the effect of halving the 
step size. Note that when h is halved, from h  0.1 to h  0.05, the error is divided by a factor 
of about 24  16, as expected.
 Adaptive Methods  We have seen that the accuracy of a numerical method for approxi-
mating solutions of differential equations can be improved by decreasing the step size h. Of course, 
this enhanced accuracy is usually obtained at a cost—namely, increased computation time and 
greater possibility of round-off error. In general, over the interval of approximation there may 
be subintervals where a relatively large step size suffices and other subintervals where a smaller 
step size is necessary in order to keep the truncation error within a desired limit. Numerical 
methods that use a variable step size are called adaptive methods. One of the more popular of 
the adaptive routines is the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method. Because Fehlberg employed two 
Runge–Kutta methods of differing orders, a fourth- and a fifth-order method, this algorithm is 
frequently denoted as the RKF45 method.*

Computer Lab Assignment
 21. The RK4 method for solving an initial-value problem over an 
interval [a, b] results in a finite set of points that are supposed 
to approximate points on the graph of the exact solution. In 
order to expand this set of discrete points to an approximate 
solution defined at all points on the interval [a, b], we can use 
an interpolating function. This is a function, supported by 
most computer algebra systems, that agrees with the given 
data exactly and assumes a smooth transition between data 
points. These interpolating functions may be polynomials or 
sets of polynomials joined together smoothly. In Mathematica 
the command y  Interpolation[data] can be used to obtain 
an interpolating function through the points data  
{ {x0, y0} , {x1, y1} , . . . , {xn, yn} }. The interpolating function y[x] 
can now be treated like any other function built into the com-
puter algebra system.

6.3 Multistep Methods
INTRODUCTION Euler’s, the improved Euler’s, and the Runge–Kutta methods are examples 
of single-step or starting methods. In these methods each successive value yn  1 is computed 
based only on information about the immediately preceding value yn. On the other hand, mul-
tistep or continuing methods use the values from several computed steps to obtain the value 
of yn  1. There are a large number of multistep method formulas for approximating solutions of 
DEs, but since it is not our intention to survey the vast field of numerical procedures, we will 
consider only one such method here.
 Adams–Bashforth–Moulton Method The multistep method discussed in this sec-
tion is called the fourth-order Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method, or a bit more awkwardly, 
the Adams–Bashforth/Adams–Moulton method. Like the improved Euler’s method it is a 
predictor–corrector method—that is, one formula is used to predict a value y*n1, which in turn 
is used to obtain a corrected value yn  1. The predictor in this method is the Adams–Bashforth 
formula

Notice that formula (1) requires that we know the values of y0, y1, y2, and y3 in order to 
obtain y4. The value of y0 is, of course, the given initial condition. Since the local truncation 
error of the Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method is O(h5), the values of y1, y2, and y3 are gener-
ally computed by a method with the same error property, such as the fourth-order Runge–Kutta 
formula.
EXAMPLE 1 
Adams–Bashforth–Moulton Method
Use the Adams–Bashforth–Moulton method with h  0.2 to obtain an approximation to y(0.8) 
for the solution of
 
y  x  y  1,   y(0)  1.
SOLUTION With a step size of h  0.2, y(0.8) will be approximated by y4. To get started we 
use the RK4 method with x0  0, y0  1, and h  0.2 to obtain
 
y1  1.02140000,   y2  1.09181796,   y3  1.22210646.
Now with the identifications x0  0, x1  0.2, x2  0.4, x3  0.6, and f ( x, y)  x  y  1, 
we find
 
y90  f ( x0, y0)  (0)  (1)  1  0
 
y91  f ( x1, y1)  (0.2)  (1.02140000)  1  0.22140000
 
y92  f ( x2, y2)  (0.4)  (1.09181796)  1  0.49181796
 
  y93  f ( x3, y3)  (0.6)  (1.22210646)  1  0.82210646.

With the foregoing values, the predictor (1) then gives
 
y*4 y3  0.2
24  (55y93  59y92  37y91  9y90)  1.42535975.
To use the corrector (2) we first need
 
y94  f ( x4, y*4)  0.8  1.42535975  1  1.22535975.
Finally, (2) yields
 
y4  y3  0.2
24  (9y94  19y93  5y92  y91)  1.42552788.
You should verify that the exact value of y(0.8) in Example 1 is y(0.8)  1.42554093.
 Stability of Numerical Methods An important consideration in using numerical 
methods to approximate the solution of an initial-value problem is the stability of the method. 
Simply stated, a numerical method is stable if small changes in the initial condition result in 
only small changes in the computed solution. A numerical method is said to be unstable if it 
is not stable. The reason that stability considerations are important is that in each step after the 
first step of a numerical technique we are essentially starting over again with a new initial-value 
problem, where the initial condition is the approximate solution value computed in the preced-
ing step. Because of the presence of round-off error, this value will almost certainly vary at least 
slightly from the true value of the solution. Besides round-off error, another common source of 
error occurs in the initial condition itself; in physical applications the data are often obtained by 
imprecise measurements.
One possible method for detecting instability in the numerical solution of a specific initial-
value problem is to compare the approximate solutions obtained when decreasing step sizes 
are used. If the numerical method is unstable, the error may actually increase with smaller step 
sizes. Another way of checking stability is to observe what happens to solutions when the initial 
condition is slightly perturbed (for example, change y(0)  1 to y(0)  0.999).
For a more detailed and precise discussion of stability, consult a numerical analysis text. In gen-
eral, all of the methods we have discussed in this chapter have good stability characteristics.
 Advantages/Disadvantages of Multistep Methods Many considerations enter 
into the choice of a method to solve a differential equation numerically. Single-step meth-
ods, particularly the Runge–Kutta method, are often chosen because of their accuracy and 
the fact that they are easy to program. However, a major drawback is that the right-hand 
side of the differential equation must be evaluated many times at each step. For instance, 
the RK4 method requires four function evaluations for each step. On the other hand, if the 
function evaluations in the previous step have been calculated and stored, a multistep method 
requires only one new function evaluation for each step. This can lead to great savings in 
time and expense.
As an example, to solve y  f ( x, y), y(x0)  y0 numerically using n steps by the RK4 method 
requires 4n function evaluations. The Adams–Bashforth multistep method requires 16 function 
evaluations for the Runge–Kutta fourth-order starter and n  4 for the n Adams–Bashforth steps, 
giving a total of n  12 function evaluations for this method. In general the Adams–Bashforth 
multistep method requires slightly more than a quarter of the number of function evaluations 
required for the RK4 method. If the evaluation of f ( x, y) is complicated, the multistep method 
will be more efficient.
Another issue involved with multistep methods is how many times the Adams–Moulton 
corrector formula should be repeated in each step. Each time the corrector is used, another 
function evaluation is done, and so the accuracy is increased at the expense of losing an 
advantage of the multistep method. In practice, the corrector is calculated once, and if the 
value of yn  1 is changed by a large amount, the entire problem is restarted using a smaller 
step size. This is often the basis of the variable step size methods, whose discussion is beyond 
the scope of this text.

6.4 Higher-Order Equations and Systems
INTRODUCTION So far we have focused on numerical techniques that can be used to ap-
proximate the solution of a first-order initial-value problem y  f ( x, y), y(x0)  y0. In order to 
approximate the solution of a second-order initial-value problem we must express a second-order 
DE as a system of two first-order DEs. To do this we begin by writing the  second-order DE in 
normal form by solving for y in terms of x, y, and y.
 Second-Order IVPs A second-order initial-value problem
 
y  f ( x, y, y),   y(x0)  y0,   y(x0)  u0, 
(1)
can be expressed as an initial-value problem for a system of first-order differential equations. If 
we let y  u, the differential equation in (1) becomes the system
 
y  u
 
u  f ( x, y, u). 
(2)
Since y(x0)  u(x0), the corresponding initial conditions for (2) are then y(x0)  y0, u(x0)  u0. 
The system (2) can now be solved numerically by simply applying a particular numerical method 
to each first-order differential equation in the system. For example, Euler’s method applied to 
the system (2) would be
 
yn  1  yn  hun
 
un  1  un  hf ( xn, yn, un), 
(3)
whereas the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, or RK4 method, would be
 
yn  1  yn  h

un  1  un  h

where

In general, we can express every nth-order differential equation 
 
y(n)  f ( x, y, y, . . . , y(n  1)) 
as a system of n first-order equations using the substitutions y  u1, y  u2, y  u3, . . . ,

EXAMPLE 1 
Euler’s Method
Use Euler’s method to obtain the approximate value of y(0.2), where y(x) is the solution of 
the initial-value problem
 
y  xy  y  0,   y(0)  1,   y(0)  2. 
(5)
SOLUTION In terms of the substitution y  u, the equation is equivalent to the system
 
y  u
 
u  xu  y.
Thus from (3) we obtain
 
yn  1  yn  hun
 
un  1  un  h[–xnun  yn].
Using the step size h  0.1 and y0  1, u0  2, we find
 
y1  y0  (0.1)u0  1  (0.1)2  1.2
 
u1  u0  (0.1)[x0u0  y0]  2  (0.1)[– (0)(2)  1]  1.9
 
y2  y1  (0.1)u1  1.2  (0.1)(1.9)  1.39
 
u2  u1  (0.1)[x1u1  y1]  1.9  (0.1)[(0.1)(1.9)  1.2]  1.761.
In other words, y(0.2)  1.39 and y(0.2)  1.761.
With the aid of the graphing feature of a numerical solver we have compared in FIGURE 6.4.1(a)
the solution curve of (5) generated by Euler’s method (h  0.1) on the interval [0, 3] with the 
solution curve generated by the RK4 method (h  0.1). From Figure 6.4.1(b), it would appear 
that the solution y(x) of (4) has the property that y(x) S 0 as x S q.
 Systems Reduced to First-Order Systems Using a procedure similar to that just 
discussed, we can often reduce a system of higher-order differential equations to a system of 
first-order equations by first solving for the highest-order derivative of each dependent variable 
and then making appropriate substitutions for the lower-order derivatives.
EXAMPLE 2 
A System Rewritten as a First-Order System
Write 
x  x  5x  2y  et
 
   2x  y  2y  3t 2
as a system of first-order differential equations.
SOLUTION Write the system as
 
x  2y  et  5x  x
 
       y  3t 2  2x  2y

 
6.4 Higher-Order Equations and Systems 
| 311
and then eliminate y by multiplying the second equation by 2 and subtracting. This gives
 
x  9x  4y  x  et  6t 2.
Since the second equation of the system already expresses the highest-order derivative of y in 
terms of the remaining functions, we are now in a position to introduce new variables. If we 
let x  u and y  v, the expressions for x and y become, respectively,
 
u  x  9x  4y  u  et  6t 2
 
v  y  2x  2y  3t 2.
The original system can then be written in the form
 
x  u
 
y  v
 
u  9x  4y  u  et  6t 2
 
v  2x  2y  3t 2.
It may not always be possible to carry out the reductions illustrated in Example 2.
 Numerical Solution of a System The solution of a system of the form

dxn
dt   gn(t, x1, x2, . . . , xn)
can be approximated by a version of the Euler, Runge–Kutta, or Adams–Bashforth–Moulton 
method adapted to the system. For example, the RK4 method applied to the system
 
x  f ( t, x, y)
 
y  g(t, x, y) 
(6)
 
x(t0)  x0, y(t0)  y0
looks like this:

CHAPTER 6 Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations
You should verify that the solution of the initial-value problem in Example 3 is given by 
x(t)  (26t  1)e4t, y(t)  (13t  6)e4t. From these equations we see that the actual values 
x(0.6)  160.9384 and y(0.6)  152.1198 compare favorably with the entries in the last line of 
Table 6.4.2. The graph of the solution in a neighborhood of t  0 is shown in FIGURE 6.4.2; the 
graph was obtained from a numerical solver using the RK4 method with h  0.1.
In conclusion, we state Euler’s method for the general system (6):
 
xn  1  xn  h f (tn, xn, yn)
 
   yn  1  yn  h g(tn, xn, yn). 
EXAMPLE 3 
RK4 Method
Consider the initial-value problem
 
x  2x  4y
 
y  –x  6y
 
x(0)  –1, y(0)  6.
Use the RK4 method to approximate x(0.6) and y(0.6). Compare the results for h  0.2 and 
h  0.1.
SOLUTION We illustrate the computations of x1 and y1 with the step size h  0.2. With the 
identifications f ( t, x, y)  2x  4y, g(t, x, y)  x  6y, t0  0, x0  1, and y0  6, we see 
from (8) that
 
m1  f ( t0, x0, y0)  f ( 0, 1, 6)  2(–1)  4(6)  22
 
k1  g(t0, x0, y0)  g(0, –1, 6)  1(1)  6(6)  37
 
m2  f ( t0  1

k3  g(t0  1
2h, x0  1
2hm2, y0  1
2hk2)  g(0.1, 3.12, 11.7)  67.08
 
m4  f ( t0  h, x0  hm3, y0  hk3)  f ( 0.2, 9.608, 19.416)  96.88
 
k4  g(t0  h, x0  hm3, y0  hk3)  g(0.2, 9.608, 19.416)  106.888.
Therefore from (7) we get
 
x1  x0  0.2

where, as usual, the computed values of x1 and y1 are rounded to four decimal places. These 
numbers give us the approximations x1  x(0.2) and y1  y(0.2). The subsequent values, 
obtained with the aid of a computer, are summarized in Tables 6.4.1 and 6.4.2.

6.5 Second-Order Boundary-Value Problems
INTRODUCTION We just saw in Section 6.4 how to approximate the solution of a second-
order initial-value problem y  f ( x, y, y), y(x0)  y0, y(x0)  u0. In this section we are going 
to examine two methods for approximating a solution of a second-order boundary-value problem 
y  f ( x, y, y), y(a)  a, y(b)  b. Unlike the procedures used with second-order initial-value 
problems, the methods of second-order boundary-value problems do not require rewriting the

| CHAPTER 6 Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations
For the subsequent discussion it is convenient, then, to rewrite this last expression in two alter-
native forms:
 
y(x  h)  y(x)  y9(x)h  y0(x) h2
2  y-(x) h3
6  p 
(1)
and 
y(x 2 h)  y(x) 2 y9(x)h  y0(x) h2
2 2 y-(x) h3
6  p. 
(2)
If h is small, we can ignore terms involving h4, h5, . . . , since these values are negligible. Indeed, 
if we ignore all terms involving h2 and higher, then solving (1) and (2), in turn, for y(x) yields 
the following approximations for the first derivative:
 
y(x)  1
h [ y(x  h)  y(x)] 
(3)
 
   y(x)  1
h [ y(x)  y(x  h)]. 
(4)
Subtracting (1) and (2) also gives
 
y(x)  1
2h [ y(x  h)  y(x  h)]. 
(5)
On the other hand, if we ignore terms involving h3 and higher, then by adding (1) and (2) we 
obtain an approximation for the second derivative y(x):
 
y(x)  1
h2 [ y(x  h)  2y(x)  y(x  h)]. 
(6)
The right sides of (3), (4), (5), and (6) are called difference quotients. The expressions
 
y(x  h)  y(x), y(x)  y(x  h), y(x  h)  y(x  h)
and 
y(x  h)  2y(x)  y(x  h)
are called finite differences. Specifically, y(x  h)  y(x) is called a forward difference, 
y(x)  y(x  h) is a backward difference, and both y(x  h)  y(x  h) and y(x  h)  2y(x)  
y(x  h) are called central differences. The results given in (5) and (6) are referred to as central 
difference approximations for the derivatives y and y.
 Finite Difference Method Consider now a linear second-order boundary-value  problem
 
y  P(x)y  Q(x)y  f ( x),   y(a)  a,   y(b)  b. 
(7)
Suppose a  x0  x1  x2  . . .  xn – 1  xn  b represents a regular partition of the interval 
[a, b]; that is, xi  a  ih, where i  0, 1, 2, . . . , n and h  (b  a)/n. The points
 
x1  a  h,   x2  a  2h,   . . . ,   xn – 1  a  (n  1)h,
are called interior mesh points of the interval [a, b]. If we let
 
yi  y(xi),   Pi  P(xi),   Qi  Q(xi),   and   fi  f ( xi)
and if y and y in (7) are replaced by the central difference approximations (5) and (6), we get
 
yi1 2 2yi  yi21

 Pi yi1 2 yi21

or, after simplifying,
 
a1  h

6.5 Second-Order Boundary-Value Problems 
|
315
The last equation, known as a finite difference equation, is an approximation to the dif-
ferential equation. It enables us to approximate the solution y(x) of (7) at the interior mesh 
points x1, x2, . . . , xn – 1 of the interval [a, b]. By letting i take on the values 1, 2, . . . , n  1 in 
(8), we obtain n  1 equations in the n  1 unknowns y1, y2, . . . , yn – 1. Bear in mind that we 
know y0 and yn, since these are the prescribed boundary conditions y0  y(x0)  y(a)  a 
and yn  y(xn)  y(b)  b.
In Example 1 we consider a boundary-value problem for which we can compare the approxi-
mate values found with the exact values of an explicit solution.
EXAMPLE 1 
Using the Finite Difference Method
Use the difference equation (8) with n  4 to approximate the solution of the boundary-value 
problem
 
y  4y  0,   y(0)  0,   y(1)  5.
SOLUTION To use (8) we identify P(x)  0, Q(x)   4,  f ( x)  0, and h  (1  0)4  1
4. 
Hence the difference equation is
 
yi  1  2.25yi  yi – 1  0. 
(9)
Now the interior points are x1  0  1
4, x2  0  2
4, x3  0  3
4, and so for i  1, 2, and 3, 
(9) yields the following system for the corresponding y1, y2, and y3:
 
y2  2.25y1  y0  0
 
y3  2.25y2  y1  0
 
    y4  2.25y3  y2  0.
With the boundary conditions y0  0 and y4  5, the foregoing system becomes
 
2.25y1  
y2 
 0
 
y1  2.25y2  
y3  0
 
y2  2.25y3  5.
Solving the system gives y1  0.7256, y2  1.6327, and y3  2.9479.
Now the general solution of the given differential equation is y  c1 cosh 2x  c2 sinh 2x. 
The condition y(0)  0 implies c1  0. The other boundary condition gives c2. In this way we 
see that an explicit solution of the boundary-value problem is y(x)  (5 sinh 2x)/sinh 2.
Thus the exact values (rounded to four decimal places) of this solution at the interior points 
are as follows: y(0.25)  0.7184, y(0.5)  1.6201, and y(0.75)  2.9354.
The accuracy of the approximations in Example 1 can be improved by using a smaller 
value of h. Of course, the trade-off here is that a smaller value of h necessitates solving a 
larger system of equations. It is left as an exercise to show that with h  1
8, approximations 
to y(0.25), y(0.5), and y(0.75) are 0.7202, 1.6233, and 2.9386, respectively. See Problem 11 
in Exercises 6.5.
EXAMPLE 2 
Using the Finite Difference Method
Use the difference equation (8) with n  10 to approximate the solution of
 
y  3y  2y  4x 2,   y(1)  1,   y(2)  6.
SOLUTION In this case we identify P(x)  3, Q(x)  2,  f ( x)  4x 2, and h  (2  1)10  0.1, 
and so (8) becomes
 
1.15yi  1  1.98yi  0.85yi – 1  0.04x 2

Now the interior points are x1  1.1, x2  1.2, x3  1.3, x4  1.4, x5  1.5, x6  1.6, x7  1.7, 
x8  1.8, and x9  1.9. For i  1, 2, . . . , 9 and y0  1, y10  6, (10) gives a system of nine 
equations and nine unknowns:
 
1.15y2  1.98y1  
 0.8016
 
1.15y3  1.98y2  0.85y1   0.0576
 
1.15y4  1.98y3  0.85y2   0.0676
 
1.15y5  1.98y4  0.85y3  0.0784
 
1.15y6  1.98y5  0.85y4   0.0900
 
1.15y7  1.98y6  0.85y5   0.1024
 
1.15y8  1.98y7  0.85y6   0.1156
 
1.15y9  1.98y8  0.85y7   0.1296
 
 
1.98y9  0.85y8   6.7556.
We can solve this large system using Gaussian elimination or, with relative ease, by means of 
a computer algebra system. The result is found to be y1  2.4047, y2  3.4432, y3  4.2010, 
y4  4.7469, y5  5.1359, y6  5.4124, y7  5.6117, y8  5.7620, and y9  5.8855.
 Shooting Method Another way of approximating a solution of a second-order boundary-
value problem y  f ( x, y, y), y(a)  a, y(b)  b, is called the shooting method. The starting 
point in this method is the replacement of the boundary-value problem by an initial-value problem
 
y  f ( x, y, y),   y(a)  a,   y(a)  m1. 
(11)
The number m1 in (11) is simply a guess for the unknown slope of the solution curve at the known 
point (a, y(a)). We then apply one of the step-by-step numerical techniques to the second-order 
equation in (11) to find an approximation b1 for the value of y(b). If b1 agrees with the given 
value y(b)  b to some preassigned tolerance, we stop; otherwise the calculations are repeated, 
starting with a different guess y(a)  m2 to obtain a second approximation b2 for y(b). This 
method can be continued in a trial-and-error manner or the subsequent slopes m3, m4, . . . , can be 
adjusted in some systematic way; linear interpolation is particularly successful when the differ-
ential equation in (11) is linear. The procedure is analogous to shooting (the “aim” is the choice 
of the initial slope) at a target until the bullseye y(b) is hit. See Problem 14 in Exercises 6.5.
Of course, underlying the use of these numerical methods is the assumption, which we know 
is not always warranted, that a solution of the boundary-value problem exists.
REMARKS
The approximation method using finite differences can be extended to boundary-value prob-
lems in which the first derivative is specified at a boundary—for example, a problem such as 
y  f ( x, y, y), y(a)  a, y(b)  b. See Problem 13 in Exercises 6.5.
In Problems 1–10, use the finite difference method and the indi-
cated value of n to approximate the solution of the given boundary-
value problem.

7.1 
Vectors in 2-Space
INTRODUCTION In science, mathematics, and engineering, we distinguish two important 
quantities: scalars and vectors. A scalar is simply a real number or a quantity that has magnitude. 
For example, length, temperature, and blood pressure are represented by numbers such as 80 m, 
20C, and the systolic/diastolic ratio 120/80. A vector, on the other hand, is usually described as 
a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.
 Geometric Vectors Geometrically, a vector can be represented by a directed line 
segment—that is, by an arrow—and is denoted either by a boldface symbol or by a symbol with 
an arrow over it; for example, v, u!, or AB
!
. Examples of vector quantities shown in FIGURE 7.1.1 
are weight w, velocity v, and the retarding force of friction Ff .

FIGURE 7.1.1 Examples of vector quantities
 Notation and Terminology A vector whose initial point (or end) is A and whose 
terminal point (or tip) is B is written AB
!
. The magnitude of a vector is written iAB
!
i. Two 
vectors that have the same magnitude and same direction are said to be equal. Thus, in 
FIGURE 7.1.2, we have AB
!
  CD
!
. Vectors are said to be free, which means that a vector can 
be moved from one position to another provided its magnitude and direction are not changed. 
The negative of a vector AB
!
, written AB
!
, is a vector that has the same magnitude as AB
!
 
but is opposite in direction. If k  0 is a scalar, the scalar multiple of a vector, kAB
!
, is a 
vector that is |k| times as long as AB
!
. If k  0, then kAB
!
 has the same direction as the vector 
AB
!
; if k  0, then kAB
!
 has the direction opposite that of AB
!
. When k  0, we say 0AB
!
  0 
is the zero vector. Two vectors are parallel if and only if they are nonzero scalar multiples 
of each other. See FIGURE 7.1.3.
 Addition and Subtraction Two vectors can be considered as having a common initial 
point, such as A in FIGURE 7.1.4(a). Thus, if nonparallel vectors AB
!
 and AC
!
 are the sides of a 
parallelogram as in Figure 7.1.4(b), we say the vector that is the main diagonal, or AD
!
, is the 
sum of AB
!
 and AC
!
. We write
 
    AD
!
  AB
!
  AC
!
.
The difference of two vectors AB
!
 and AC
!
 is defined by
 
AB
!
  AC
!
  AB
!
  (AC
!
).
As seen in FIGURE 7.1.5(a), the difference AB
!
  AC
!
 can be interpreted as the main diagonal of 
the parallelogram with sides AB
!
 and AC
!
. However, as shown in Figure 7.1.5(b), we can also 
interpret the same vector difference as the third side of a triangle with sides AB
!
 and AC
!
. In this 
second interpretation, observe that the vector difference CB
h  AB
!
  AC
!
 points toward the 
terminal point of the vector from which we are subtracting the second vector. If AB
!
  AC
!
, then
 
AB
!
  AC
!
  0.
The question of what is the direction of 0 
is usually answered by saying that the 
zero vector can be assigned any direction. 
More to the point, 0 is needed in order to 
have a vector algebra.

 Vectors in a Coordinate Plane To describe a vector analytically, let us suppose for the 
remainder of this section that the vectors we are considering lie in a two-dimensional coordinate 
plane or 2-space. We shall denote the set of all vectors in the plane by R 2. The vector shown 
in FIGURE 7.1.6, with initial point the origin O and terminal point P(x1, y1), is called the position
vector of the point P and is written
OP
!
   x1, y1.
 Components In general, a vector a in R 2 is any ordered pair of real numbers,
a  a1, a2.
The numbers a1 and a2 are said to be the components of the vector a.
As we shall see in the first example, the vector a is not necessarily a position vector.
EXAMPLE 1 
Position Vector
The displacement from the initial point P1(x, y) to the terminal point P2(x  4, y  3) in 
FIGURE 7.1.7(a) is 4 units to the right and 3 units up. As seen in Figure 7.1.7(b), the position 
vector of a  4, 3 emanating from the origin is equivalent to the displacement vector P1P
!
2
from P1(x, y) to P2(x  4, y  3).
Addition and subtraction of vectors, multiplication of vectors by scalars, and so on, are defined 
in terms of their components.
Definition 7.1.1 
Addition, Scalar Multiplication, Equality
Let a   a1, a2 and b   b1, b2 be vectors in R 2.
(i) Addition: a  b   a1  b1, a2  b2 
(1)
(ii) Scalar multiplication: k a   ka1, ka2 
(2)
(iii) Equality: a  b   if and only if   a1  b1, a2  b2 
(3)
 Subtraction Using (2), we define the negative of a vector b by
b  (1)b  b1, b2.
We can then define the subtraction, or the difference, of two vectors as
 
a  b  a  (b)   a1  b1, a2  b2. 
(4)
In FIGURE 7.1.8(a) on page 324, we have illustrated the sum of two vectors OP1
!
 and OP2
!
. In Figure 7.1.8(b), 
the vector P1P2
!
, with initial point P1 and terminal point P2, is the difference of position vectors
 
P1P2
!
  OP2
!
  OP1
!
   x2  x1, y2  y1.
As shown in Figure 7.1.8(b), the vector P1P2
!
 can be drawn either starting from the terminal point 
of OP1
!
 and ending at the terminal point of OP2
!
, or as the position vector OP
!
 whose terminal 
point has coordinates (x2  x1, y2  y1). Remember, OP
!
 and P1P2
!
 are considered equal, since 
they have the same magnitude and direction.

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
 Properties The component definition of a vector can be used to verify each of the fol-
lowing properties of vectors in R 2:
Theorem 7.1.1 
Properties of Vectors
(i) 
a  b  b  a 
 
(ii) 
a  (b  c)  (a  b)  c 
(iii) a  0  a  
(iv) a  (a)  0 
 
(v) 
k(a  b)  ka  kb,  k a scalar
(vi) (k1  k2)a  k1a  k2a,  k1 and k2 scalars
(vii) k1(k2a)  (k1k2)a,  k1 and k2 scalars
(viii) 1a  a
(ix) 0 a  0 
 
 
 
 
  d zero vector
d commutative law
d associative law
d additive identity
d additive inverse
The zero vector 0 in properties (iii), (iv), and (ix) is defined as
0   0, 0.
 Magnitude The magnitude, length, or norm of a vector a is denoted by iai. Motivated 
by the Pythagorean theorem and FIGURE 7.1.9, we define the magnitude of a vector
a   a1, a2   to be   iai  "a2
1  a2
2.
Clearly, iai  0 for any vector a, and iai  0 if and only if a  0. For example, if a   6, 2, 
then iai  "62  (2)2  "40  2"10.
 Unit Vectors A vector that has magnitude 1 is called a unit vector. We can obtain a unit 
vector u in the same direction as a nonzero vector a by multiplying a by the positive scalar k 
1>iai (reciprocal of its magnitude). In this case we say that  u  (1/iai) a is the normalization
of the vector a. The normalization of the vector a is a unit vector because
iui  g 1
iai ag 

7ai 7ai  1.
Note: It is often convenient to write the scalar multiple u  (1>iai) a as
u  a
iai.
EXAMPLE 3 
Unit Vectors
Given a   2, 1, form a unit vector in the same direction as a. In the opposite direc-
tion of a.
SOLUTION The magnitude of the vector a is iai  "22  (1)2  "5. Thus a unit vector 
in the same direction as a is the scalar multiple
u 

A unit vector in the opposite direction of a is the negative of u:

If a and b are vectors and c1 and c2 are scalars, then the expression c1a  c2b is called a linear
combination of a and b. As we see next, any vector in R 2 can be written as a linear combination 
of two special vectors.

 The i, j Vectors In view of (1) and (2), any vector a   a1, a2 can be written as a sum:
 
 a1, a2   a1, 0   0, a2  a1 1, 0  a2 0, 1. 
(5)
The unit vectors  1, 0 and  0, 1 are usually given the special symbols i and j. See FIGURE 7.1.10(a). 
Thus, if
 
i   1, 0   and   j   0, 1,
then (5) becomes 
a  a1i  a2 j. 
(6)
The unit vectors i and j are referred to as the standard basis for the system of two-dimensional 
vectors, since any vector a can be written uniquely as a linear combination of i and j. If 
a  a1i  a2 j is a position vector, then Figure 7.1.10(b) shows that a is the sum of the vectors 
a1i and a2 j, which have the origin as a common initial point and which lie on the x- and y-axes, 
respectively. The scalar a1 is called the horizontal component of a, and the scalar a2 is called 
the vertical component of a.

(e) a  6i  4j and b  9i  6j are parallel, since b is a scalar multiple of a. We see 
that b  3

Vectors in 3-Space
INTRODUCTION In the plane, or 2-space, one way of describing the position of a point P 
is to assign to it coordinates relative to two mutually orthogonal, or perpendicular, axes called 
the x- and y-axes. If P is the point of intersection of the line x  a (perpendicular to the x-axis) 
and the line y  b (perpendicular to the y-axis), then the ordered pair (a, b) is said to be the 
rectangular or Cartesian coordinates of the point. See FIGURE 7.2.1. In this section we extend 
the notions of Cartesian coordinates and vectors to three dimensions.
 Rectangular Coordinate System in 3-Space In three dimensions, or 3-space, a rec-
tangular coordinate system is constructed using three mutually orthogonal axes. The point at which 
these axes intersect is called the origin O. These axes, shown in FIGURE 7.2.2(a), are labeled in accor-
dance with the so-called right-hand rule: If the fingers of the right hand, pointing in the direction 
of the positive x-axis, are curled toward the positive y-axis, then the thumb will point in the direction 
of a new axis perpendicular to the plane of the x-and y-axes. This new axis is labeled the z-axis.

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
The dashed lines in Figure 7.2.2(a) represent the negative axes. Now, if
 
x  a,   y  b,   z  c
are planes perpendicular to the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, respectively, then the point P at which 
these planes intersect can be represented by an ordered triple of numbers (a, b, c) said to be the 
rectangular or Cartesian coordinates of the point. The numbers a, b, and c are, in turn, called 
the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of P(a, b, c). See Figure 7.2.2(b).
 Octants Each pair of coordinate axes determines a coordinate plane. As shown in 
FIGURE 7.2.3, the x- and y-axes determine the xy-plane, the x- and z-axes determine the xz-plane, 
and so on. The coordinate planes divide 3-space into eight parts known as octants. The octant 
in which all three coordinates of a point are positive is called the first octant. There is no agree-
ment for naming the other seven octants.
The following table summarizes the coordinates of a point either on a coordinate axis or in a 
coordinate plane. As seen in the table, we can also describe, say, the xy-plane by the simple equa-
tion z  0. Similarly, the xz-plane is y  0 and the yz-plane is x  0.

Graphs of Three Points
Graph the points (4, 5, 6), (3, 3, 1), and (2, 2, 0).
SOLUTION Of the three points shown in FIGURE 7.2.4, only (4, 5, 6) is in the first octant. The 
point (2, 2, 0) is in the xy-plane.
 Distance Formula To find the distance between two points P1(x1, y1, z1) and P2(x2, y2, z2) 
in 3-space, let us first consider their projection onto the xy-plane. As seen in FIGURE 7.2.5, the 
distance between (x1, y1, 0) and (x2, y2, 0) follows from the usual distance formula in the plane 
and is "(x2 2 x1)2  (y2 2 y1)2. If the coordinates of P3 are (x2, y2, z1), then the Pythagorean 
theorem applied to the right triangle P1P2P3 yields 
 
 fd(P1, P2)g2  f "(x2 2 x1)2  (y2 2 y1)2g2  Zz2 2 z1Z2

 Midpoint Formula The formula for finding the midpoint of a line segment between two 
points in 2-space carries over in an analogous fashion to 3-space. If P1(x1, y1, z1) and P2(x2, y2, z2) 
are two distinct points, then the coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment between 
them are

Find a unit vector in the direction of a  2, 3, 6.

the fact that a>iai is a unit vector in the direction of a. The magnitude of a is

 The i, j, k Vectors We saw in the preceding section that the set of two unit vectors 
i  1, 0 and j  0, 1 constitute a basis for the system of two-dimensional vectors. That is, 
any vector a in 2-space can be written as a linear combination of i and j: a  a1i  a2 j. Likewise 
any vector a  a1, a2, a3 in 3-space can be expressed as a linear combination of the unit vectors
 
i  1, 0, 0,   j  0, 1, 0,   k  0, 0, 1.
To see this we use (i) and (ii) of Definition 7.2.1 to write
 
a1, a2, a3  a1, 0, 0  0, a2, 0  0, 0, a3
 
         a11, 0, 0  a20, 1, 0  a30, 0, 1;
that is, 
a  a1i  a2 j  a3k.
The vectors i, j, and k illustrated in FIGURE 7.2.8(a) are called the standard basis for the system 
of three-dimensional vectors. In Figure 7.2.8(b) we see that a position vector a  a1i  a2 j  a3k
is the sum of the vectors a1i, a2 j, and a3k, which lie along the coordinate axes and have the origin 
as a common initial point.
EXAMPLE 6 
Using the i, j, k Vectors
The vector a  7, 5, 13 is the same as a  7i  5j  13k.
When the third dimension is taken into consideration, any vector in the xy-plane is equiva-
lently described as a three-dimensional vector that lies in the coordinate plane z  0. Although 
the vectors a1, a2 and a1, a2, 0 are technically not equal, we shall ignore the distinction. That 
is why, for example, we denoted 1, 0 and 1, 0, 0 by the same symbol i. But to avoid any 
 possible confusion, hereafter we shall always consider a vector a three-dimensional vector, and 
the symbols i and j will represent only 1, 0, 0 and 0, 1, 0, respectively. Similarly, a vector 
in either the xy-plane or the xz-plane must have one zero component. In the yz-plane, a vector
 
b  0, b2, b3   is written   b  b2 j  b3k.
In the xz-plane, a vector
 
c  c1, 0, c3   is the same as   c  c1i  c3k.
EXAMPLE 7 
Vector in xz-Plane
(a) The vector a  5i  3k  5i  0j  3k lies in the xz-plane and can also be written 
as a  5, 0, 3.

EXAMPLE 8 
Linear Combination
If a  3i  4j  8k and b  i  4k, find 5a  2b.
SOLUTION We treat b as a three-dimensional vector and write, for emphasis, b  i  0j  4k. 
From
 
5a  15i  20j  40k   and   2b  2i  0j  8k
we get 
5a  2b  (15i  20j  40k)  (2i  0j  8k)
 
 13i  20j  48k.

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
7.3 
Dot Product
INTRODUCTION In this and the following section, we shall consider two kinds of products 
between vectors that originated in the study of mechanics and electricity and magnetism. The 
first of these products, known as the dot product, is studied in this section.
 Component Form of the Dot Product The dot product, defined next, is also known 
as the inner product, or scalar product. The dot product of two vectors a and b is denoted by 
a 
 b and is a real number, or scalar, defined in terms of the components of the vectors.
Definition 7.3.1 
Dot Product of Two Vectors
In 2-space the dot product of two vectors a  a1, a2  and b  b1, b2  is the number
a 
 b  a1b1  a2b2. 
(1)
In 3-space the dot product of two vectors a  a1, a2, a3  and b  b1, b2, b3  is the number
a 
 b  a1b1  a2b2  a3b3. 
(2)
EXAMPLE 1 
Dot Product Using (2)
If a  10i  2 j  6k and b  1
2i  4 j  3k, then it follows from (2) that
 
a 
 b  (10)(1
2)  (2)(4)  (6)(3)  21.
EXAMPLE 2 
Dot Products of the Basis Vectors
Since i  1, 0, 0, j  0, 1, 0, and k  0, 0, 1, we see from (2) that
 
i 
 j  j 
 i  0, j 
 k  k 
 j  0, and k 
 i  i 
 k  0. 
(3)
Similarly, by (2)
 
i 
 i  1, j 
 j  1, and k 
 k  1. 
(4)
 Properties The dot product possesses the following properties.

PROOF: All the properties can be proved directly from (2). We illustrate by proving parts (iii) 
and (vi).
To prove part (iii) we let a  a1, a2, a3 , b  b1, b2, b3 , and c  c1, c2, c3 . Then
 
a

 a 
 a  a1, a2, a3  
 a1, a2, a3  a2
1  a2
2  a2
3  iai2.
Notice that (vi) of Theorem 7.3.1 states that the magnitude of a vector can be written in terms 
of the dot product:
 
iai  "a
 a  "a2
1  a2
2  a2
3.
 Alternative Form The dot product of two vectors a and b can also be expressed in terms 
of the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them. If the vectors a and b are positioned in 
such a manner that their initial points coincide, then we define the angle between a and b as the 
angle u that satisfies 0 # u # p.
Theorem 7.3.2 
Alternative Form of Dot Product
The dot product of two vectors a and b is
 
a 
 b  iai ibi cos u 
(5)
where u in the angle between the vectors.
PROOF:  Suppose u is the angle between the vectors a  a1i  a2 j  a3k and b  b1i  b2 j  b3k. 
Then the vector
 
c  b  a  (b1  a1)i (b2  a2) j  (b3  a3)k
is the third side of the triangle indicated in FIGURE 7.3.1. By the law of cosines we can write 
ici2  ibi2  iai2 2 2iai ibi cos u or
 
iai ibi cos u  1
2
 (ibi2  iai2 2 ici2). 
(6)
Using 
iai2  a2
1  a2
2  a2
3, ibi2  b2
1  b2
2  b2
3,
and 
ici2  ib 2 ai2  (b1 2 a1)2   (b2 2 a2)2   (b3 2 a3)2,
the right-hand side of equation (6) simplifies to a1b1  a2b2  a3b3. Since the last expression 
is (2) in Definition 7.3.1, we see that iai ibi cos u  a 
 b.
 Orthogonal Vectors If a and b are nonzero vectors, then iai  and ibi are both positive 
numbers.  In this case it follows from (5) that the sign of the dot product a 
 b is the same as the sign 
of cos u. In FIGURE 7.3.2 we see various orientations of two vectors for angles that satisfy 0 # u # p. 
Observe from Figure 7.3.2 and (5) that a 
 b  0 for u  0, a 
 b  0 when u is acute, a 
 b  0 for 
u  p/2, a 
 b  0 when u is obtuse, and a 
 b  0 for u  p. In the special case u  p/2 we say 
that the vectors are orthogonal or perpendicular. Moreover, if we know that a 
 b  0, then the 
only angle for which this is true and satisfying 0 # u # p is u  p/2. This leads us to the next result.
This more geometric form 
is what is generally used 
as the deﬁ nition of the 
dot product in a physics 
course.

Theorem 7.3.3 
Criterion for Orthogonal Vectors
Two nonzero vectors a and b are orthogonal if and only if a 
 b  0.
Since 0 
 b  0, 0, 0 
 b1, b2, b3   0(b1)  0(b2)  0(b3)  0 for every vector b, the zero 
vector 0 is considered to be orthogonal to every vector.

EXAMPLE 3 
Orthogonal Vectors
If a  3i  j  4k and b  2i  14j  5k, then
 
a 
 b  (3)(2)  (1)(14)  (4)(5)  0.
From Theorem 7.3.3, we conclude that a and b are orthogonal.
In Example 1, from a 
 b  0 we can conclude that the vectors a  10i  2 j  6k and 
b  1
2i  4 j  3k are not orthogonal. From (3) of Example 2, we see what is apparent in 
Figure 7.2.8, namely, the vectors i, j, and k constitute a set of mutually orthogonal unit vectors.
 Angle Between Two Vectors By equating the two forms of the dot product, (2) and 
(5), we can determine the angle between two vectors from

Find the direction cosines and direction angles of the vector a  2i  5j  4k.

Find the angle between a  2i  3j  k and b  i  5j  k.
SOLUTION From iai  "14, ibi  "27, a

and so u  cos–1 ("42>9)  0.77 radian or u  43.9.
 Direction Cosines For a nonzero vector a  a1i  a2 j  a3k in 3-space, the angles a, 
b, and g between a and the unit vectors i, j, and k, respectively, are called direction angles of 
a. See FIGURE 7.3.3. Now, by (7),

which simplify to
 cos a  a1
iai,  cos b  a2
iai,  cos g  a3

We say that cos a, cos b, and cos g are the direction cosines of a. The direction cosines of a 
nonzero vector a are simply the components of the unit vector (1>iai)a:
1
iai a  a1
iai i  a2
iai j  a3
iai k  ( cos a) i  ( cos b) j  ( cos g) k.
Since the magnitude of (1>iai) a is 1, it follows from the last equation that
 
cos2a  cos2b  cos2g  1.

 Component of a on b The distributive law and (3) enable us to express the components 
of a vector a  a1i  a2 j  a3k in terms of the dot product:
 
a1  a 
 i,   a2  a 
 j,   a3  a

(8)
Symbolically, we write the components of a as
 
compia  a 
 i,   compja  a 
 j,   compka  a 
 k. 
(9)
We shall now see that the results indicated in (9) carry over to finding the component of a on 
an arbitrary vector b. Note that in either of the two cases shown in FIGURE 7.3.4,
 
compba  iai cos u. 
(10)
In Figure 7.3.4(b), compba  0 since p/2  u  p. Now, by writing (10) as

In other words:

Projection of a Vector on Another Vector
Find the projection of a  4i  j onto the vector b  2i  3 j. Graph.

 Physical Interpretation of the Dot Product When a constant force of magnitude F
moves an object a distance d in the same direction of the force, the work done is simply W  Fd. 
However, if a constant force F applied to a body acts at an angle u to the direction of motion, 
then the work done by F is defined to be the product of the component of F in the direction of 
the displacement and the distance idi that the body moves:
 
W  (iFi cos u) idi  iFi idi cos u.
See FIGURE 7.3.8. It follows from Theorem 7.3.2 that if F causes a displacement d of a body, then 
the work done is
 
W  F  d.

Cross Product
INTRODUCTION The dot product, introduced in the preceding section, works in both two- and 
three-dimensional spaces and results in a number. On the other hand, the cross product, introduced 
in this section, is only defined for vectors in 3-space and results in another vector in 3-space. 
Before proceeding we need the following two results from the theory of determinants.
 Review of Determinants  A determinant of order 2 is the number
 
2a1

A determinant of order 3 is the number defined in terms of three determinants of order 2:

 Component Form of the Cross Product As we did in the discussion of the dot prod-
uct, we define the cross product of two vectors a and b in terms of the components of the vectors.
See Sections 8.4 and 8.5 for 
a complete discussion of 
determinants.
Definition 7.4.1 
Cross Product of Two Vectors
The cross product of two vectors a  a1, a2, a3  and b  b1, b2, b3  is the vector
 
a  b  (a2 b3  a3 b2)i  (a1 b3  a3 b1)j  (a1 b2  a2 b1)k. 
(3)

7.4 Cross Product

The coefficients of the basis vectors in (3) are recognized as determinants of order 2, so (3) 
can be written as
a  b  2a2
a3
b2
b3
2  i 2 2a1
a3
b1
b3
2  j  2a1

2 k. 
(4)
By comparing (4) with (2), we see that the cross product can be formally expressed as a deter-
minant of order 3 with the unit vectors i, j, and k as entries in the first row and the components 
of a and b entries of the second and third rows, respectively:
a  b  3

The results in (6) can be obtained using the circular mnemonic illustrated in FIGURE 7.4.1. Notice 
in (7), if we cross two basis vectors in the direction opposite to that shown in Figure 7.4.1, then 
we get the negative of the corresponding vector in (6). The results in (6), (7), and (8) are special 
cases of (ii) and (vi) in Theorem 7.4.1.

product.

         (a  b)  (a  c).
Because part (ii) of Theorem 7.4.1 indicates that the cross product is not commutative, there 
are two distributive laws in parts (iii) and (iv) of the theorem.
Parts (vii) and (viii) of Theorem 7.4.1 deserve special attention. In view of Theorem 7.3.3 we 
see (vii) and (viii) imply that the vector a  b is orthogonal to a and that a  b is orthogonal 
to b. In the case when a and b are nonzero vectors, then a  b is orthogonal to every vector in 
the plane containing a and b. Put another way,
 
a  b is orthogonal to the plane containing a and b. 
(9)
You can see in Figure 7.4.1 and from the results in (6) that i  j is orthogonal to the plane of 
i and j; that is, the xy-plane, j  k is orthogonal to the yz-plane, and k  i is orthogonal to the 
xz-plane.
The results in (6) and (7) give us a clue as to the direction in which the vector a  b points.
 Right-Hand Rule The vectors a, b, and a  b form a right-handed system or a right-
handed triple. This means that a  b points in the direction given by the right-hand rule:
If the fingers of the right hand point along the vector a and then curl toward 
the vector b, the thumb will give the direction of a  b. 
(10)
See FIGURE 7.4.2(a). In Figure 7.4.2(b), the right-hand rule shows the direction of b  a.

FIGURE 7.4.2 Right-hand rule
Because a  b is a vector its magnitude ia  bi can be found from (vii) of Definition 7.2.1. 
As we see in the next theorem, ia  bi can also be expressed in terms of the angle u between 
the vectors a and b.

Theorem 7.4.2 
Magnitude of the Cross Product
For nonzero vectors a and b, if u is the angle between a and b (0  u  p), then
 
ia  bi  iai ibi sin u. 
(11)
Theorem 7.4.3 
Criterion for Parallel Vectors
Two nonzero vectors a and b are parallel if and only if a  b  0.
PROOF: We separately compute the squares of the left- and right-hand sides of equation (11) 
using the component forms of a and b:

Since both sides are equal to the same quantity, they must be equal to each other, so
 
ia  bi2  (iai ibi sin u)2.
Finally, taking the square root of both sides and using the fact that "sin2 u  sin u since sin u 	 0 
for 0  u  p, we have ia  bi  iai ibi sin u.
 Alternative Form Combining (9), (10), and Theorem 7.4.2 we see for any pair of vectors 
a and b in R 3 that the cross product has the alternative form
 
a  b  (iai ibi sin u) n, 
(12)
where n is a unit vector given by the right-hand rule that is orthogonal to the plane of a and b.
 Parallel Vectors We saw in Section 7.1 that two nonzero vectors are parallel if and only 
if one is a nonzero scalar multiple of the other. Thus, two vectors are parallel if they have the 
forms a and ka, where a is any vector and k is a scalar. By properties (v) and (vi) in Theorem 
7.4.1, the cross product of parallel vectors must be 0. This fact is summarized in the next theorem.
This more geometric form is 
generally used as the deﬁ nition 
of the cross product in a physics 
course.
Of course, Theorem 7.4.3 follows as well from (12) because the angle between parallel 
 vectors a and b is either u  0 or u  p.

7.4 Cross Product 
| 343
 Volume of a Parallelepiped If the vectors a, b, and c do not lie in the same plane, 
then the volume of the parallelepiped with edges a, b, and c shown in FIGURE 7.4.4 is
 
V  (area of base) (height)
 
 ib  ci u compbca u
 
 ib  ci ` a a
1
ib 3 ci b 3 cb  `
or 
V  ua  (b  c) u. 
(18)
Thus, the volume of a parallelepiped determined by three vectors is the absolute value of the 
scalar triple product of the vectors.
 Coplanar Vectors Vectors that lie in the same plane are said to be coplanar. We have 
just seen that if the vectors a, b, and c are not coplanar, then necessarily a  (b  c)  0, since 
the volume of a parallelepiped with edges a, b, and c has nonzero volume. Equivalently stated, 
this means that if a  (b  c)  0, then the vectors a, b, and c are coplanar. Since the converse 
of this last statement is also true, we have:
 
a  (b  c)  0 if and only if a, b, and c are coplanar.
 Physical Interpretation of the Cross Product In physics a force F acting at the 
end of a position vector r, as shown in FIGURE 7.4.5, is said to produce a torque  defined by 
  r 3 F. For example, if iFi  20 N, iri  3.5 m, and u  30, then from (11),
 
i  i  (3.5)(20) sin 30  35 N-m.
If F and r are in the plane of the page, the right-hand rule implies that the direction of  is outward 
from, and perpendicular to, the page (toward the reader).
As we see in FIGURE 7.4.6, when a force F is applied to a wrench, the magnitude of the torque 
 is a measure of the turning effect about the pivot point P and the vector  is directed along the 
axis of the bolt. In this case  points inward from the page.

REMARKS
When working with vectors, one should be careful not to mix the symbols  and  with the 
symbols for ordinary multiplication, and to be especially careful in the use, or lack of use, of 
parentheses. For example, expressions such as
 
a  b  c   a  b  c   a  b  c   a  bc
are not meaningful or well-defined.

7.5 
Lines and Planes in 3-Space
INTRODUCTION In this section we discuss how to find various equations of lines and planes 
in 3-space.
 Lines: Vector Equation As in the plane, any two distinct points in 3-space determine 
only one line between them. To find an equation of the line through P1(x1, y1, z1) and P2(x2, y2, z2), 
let us assume that P(x, y, z) is any point on the line. In FIGURE 7.5.1, if r  OP
!
, r1  OP1
!
, and 
r2  OP2
!
, we see that vector a  r2  r1 is parallel to vector r  r2. Thus,
 
r  r2  t (r2  r1). 
(1)
If we write
 
a  r2  r1  x2  x1, y2  y1, z2  z1  a1, a2, a3, 
(2)
then (1) implies that a vector equation for the line +a is
 
r  r2  t a.
The scalar t is called a parameter and the nonzero vector a is called a direction vector; the 
components a1, a2, and a3 of the direction vector a are called direction numbers for the line.
Since r  r1 is also parallel to +a, an alternative vector equation for the line is r  r1  ta. 
Indeed, r  r1  t(a) and r  r1  t(ka), k a nonzero scalar, are also equations for +a.
EXAMPLE 1 
Vector Equation of a Line
Find a vector equation for the line through (2, 1, 8) and (5, 6, 3).
SOLUTION Define a  2  5,  1  6, 8  (3)  3, 7, 11. The following are three 
different vector equations for the line:
 
x, y, z   2, 1, 8  t 3, 7, 11 
(3)
 
x, y, z   5, 6, 3  t 3, 7, 11 
(4)
 
x, y, z   5, 6, 3  t 3, 7, 11. 
(5)
 Parametric Equations By writing (1) as
 
x, y, z  x2  t (x2  x1), y2  t ( y2  y1), z2  t (z2  z1)
 
 x2  a1t, y2  a2t, z2  a3t
and equating components, we obtain
 
x  x2  a1t,   y  y2  a2t,   z  z2  a3t. 
(6)
The equations in (6) are called parametric equations for the line through P1 and P2. As the 
parameter t increases from q to q, we can think of the point P(x, y, z) tracing out the entire 
line. If the parameter t is restricted to a closed interval [t0, t1], then P(x, y, z) traces out a line 
segment starting at the point corresponding to t0 and ending at the point corresponding to t1. For 
example, in Figure 7.5.1, if 1  t  0, then P(x, y, z) traces out the line segment starting at 
P1(x1, y1, z1) and ending at P2(x2, y2, z2).
EXAMPLE 2 
Parametric Equations of a Line
Find parametric equations for the line in Example 1.
SOLUTION From (3), it follows that
 
x  2  3t,   y  1  7t,   z  8  11t. 
(7)
An alternative set of parametric equations can be obtained from (5):
 
x  5  3t,   y  6  7t,   z  3  11t.

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
Note that the value t  0 in (7) gives (2, 1, 8), whereas in (8), t  1 must be used to obtain 
the same point.
EXAMPLE 3 
Vector Parallel to a Line
Find a vector a that is parallel to the line +a whose parametric equations are x  4  9t, 
y  14  5t, z  1  3t.
SOLUTION The coefficients (or a nonzero constant multiple of the coefficients) of the pa-
rameter in each equation are the components of a vector that is parallel to the line. Thus, 
a  9i  5j  3k is parallel to +a and hence is a direction vector of the line.
 Symmetric Equations From (6), observe that we can clear the parameter by writing
 
t  x 2 x2
a1
 y 2 y2
a2
 z 2 z2
a3
provided that the three direction numbers a1, a2, and a3 are nonzero. The resulting equations
x 2 x2
a1
 y 2 y2
a2
 z 2 z2
a3
 
(9)
are said to be symmetric equations for the line through P1 and P2.
EXAMPLE 4 
Symmetric Equations of a Line
Find symmetric equations for the line through (4, 10, 6) and (7, 9, 2).
SOLUTION Define a1  7  4  3, a2  9  10  1, and a3  2  (6)  8. It follows 
from (9) that symmetric equations for the line are
 
x 2 7
3
 y 2 9
1
 z 2 2
8
.
If one of the direction numbers a1, a2, or a3 is zero in (6), we use the remaining two equations 
to eliminate the parameter t. For example, if a1  0, a2  0, a3  0, then (6) yields
 
x  x2   and   t  y 2 y2
a2
 z 2 z2
a3
.
In this case, 
x  x2, 
y 2 y2
a2
 z 2 z2
a3
are symmetric equations for the line.
EXAMPLE 5 
Symmetric Equations of a Line
Find symmetric equations for the line through (5, 3, 1) and (2, 1, 1).
SOLUTION Define a1  5  2  3, a2  3  1  2, and a3  1  1  0. From the preced-
ing discussion, it follows that symmetric equations for the line are
 
x 2 5
3
 y 2 3
2
, z  1.
In other words, the symmetric equations describe a line in the plane z  1.
A line in space is also determined by specifying a point P1(x1, y1, z1) and a nonzero direction 
vector a. Through the point P1, there passes only one line +a parallel to the given vector. If 
P(x, y, z) is a point on the line +a, shown in FIGURE 7.5.2, then, as before,

EXAMPLE 6 
Line Parallel to a Vector
Write vector, parametric, and symmetric equations for the line through (4, 6, 3) and parallel 
to a  5i  10j  2k.
SOLUTION With a1  5, a2  10, and a3  2 we have immediately

 Planes: Vector Equation 
FIGURE 7.5.3(a) illustrates the fact that through a given point 
P1(x1, y1, z1) there pass an infinite number of planes. However, as shown in Figure 7.5.3(b), if a 
point P1 and a vector n are specified, there is only one plane  containing P1 with n normal, or 
perpendicular, to the plane. Moreover, if P(x, y, z) is any point on , and r  OP
!
, r1  OP1
!
, 
then, as shown in Figure 7.5.3(c), r  r1 is in the plane. It follows that a vector equation of the 
plane is

 Cartesian Equation Specifically, if the normal vector is n  ai  bj  ck, then (10) 
yields a Cartesian equation of the plane containing P1(x1, y1, z1):
 
a(x  x1)  b(y  y1)  c(z  z1)  0. 
(11)
Equation (11) is sometimes called the point-normal form of the equation of a plane.
EXAMPLE 7 
Equation of a Plane
Find an equation of the plane with normal vector n  2i  8j  5k containing the point 
(4, 1, 3).
SOLUTION It follows immediately from the point-normal form (11) that an equation of the 
plane is 2(x  4)  8(y  1)  5(z  3)  0 or 2x  8y  5z  15  0.
Equation (11) can always be written as ax  by  cz  d  0 by identifying d  ax1  by1  cz1. 
Conversely, we shall now prove that any linear equation
 
ax  by  cz  d  0,   a, b, c not all zero 
(12)
is a plane.
Theorem 7.5.1 
Plane with Normal Vector
The graph of any equation ax  by  cz  d  0, a, b, c not all zero, is a plane with the 
normal vector n  ai  bj  ck.

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
PROOF: Suppose x0, y0, and z0 are numbers that satisfy the given equation. Then, ax0  by0  
cz0  d  0 implies that d  ax0  by0  cz0. Replacing this latter value of d in the original 
equation gives, after simplifying, a(x  x0)  b(y  y0)  c(z  z0)  0, or, in terms of vectors,
 
[ai  bj  ck]  [(x  x0)i  ( y  y0) j  (z  z0)k]  0.
This last equation implies that ai  bj  ck is normal to the plane containing the point (x0, y0, z0) 
and the vector (x  x0)i  ( y  y0)j  (z  z0)k.
EXAMPLE 8 
A Vector Normal to a Plane
A vector normal to the plane 3x  4y  10z  8  0 is n  3i  4j  10k.
Of course, a nonzero scalar multiple of a normal vector is still perpendicular to the plane.
Three noncollinear points P1, P2, and P3 also determine a plane.* To obtain an equation of the 
plane, we need only form two vectors between two pairs of points. As shown in FIGURE 7.5.4, their 
cross product is a vector normal to the plane containing these vectors. If P(x, y, z) represents any 
point on the plane, and r  OP

, then r  r1 (or, for that matter, 
r  r2 or r  r3) is in the plane. Hence,

is a vector equation of the plane. Do not memorize the last formula. The procedure is the same 
as (10) with the exception that the vector n normal to the plane is obtained by means of the cross 
product.
EXAMPLE 9 
Three Points That Determine a Plane
Find an equation of the plane that contains (1, 0, 1), (3, 1, 4), and (2, 2, 0).
SOLUTION We need three vectors. Pairing the points on the left as shown yields the vectors 
on the right. The order in which we subtract is irrelevant. 
(1, 0, 1)
(3, 1, 4)r  u  2i  j  5k,  
(3, 1, 4)
(2, 2, 0)r  v  i  3j  4k,  (2, 2, 0)

is a vector normal to the plane containing the given points. Hence, a vector equation of the 
plane is (u  v)  w  0. The latter equation yields
 
11(x  2)  3( y  2)  5z  0   or   11x  3y  5z  16  0.
 Graphs The graph of (12) with one or even two variables missing is still a plane. For 
 example, we saw in Section 7.2 that the graphs of
 
x  x0,   y  y0,   z  z0,
where x0, y0, z0 are constants, are planes perpendicular to the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In 
general, to graph a plane, we should try to find
 
(i) the x-, y-, and z-intercepts and, if necessary,
 
(ii) the trace of the plane in each coordinate plane.
A trace of a plane in a coordinate plane is the line of intersection of the plane with a coordinate 
plane.

EXAMPLE 10 
Graph of a Plane
Graph the equation 2x  3y  6z  18.
SOLUTION Setting: y  0, z  0 
gives 
x  9
 
x  0, z  0 
gives 
y  6
 
x  0, y  0 
gives 
z  3.
As shown in FIGURE 7.5.5, we use the x-, y-, and z-intercepts (9, 0, 0), (0, 6, 0), and (0, 0, 3) to 
draw the graph of the plane in the first octant.
EXAMPLE 11 
Graph of a Plane
Graph the equation 6x  4y  12.
SOLUTION In two dimensions, the graph of the equation is a line with x-intercept (2, 0) and 
y-intercept (3, 0). However, in three dimensions, this line is the trace of a plane in the xy-
coordinate plane. Since z is not specified, it can be any real number. In other words, (x, y, z) 
is a point on the plane provided that x and y are related by the given equation. As shown in 
FIGURE 7.5.6, the graph is a plane parallel to the z-axis.
EXAMPLE 12 
Graph of a Plane
Graph the equation x  y  z  0.
SOLUTION First observe that the plane passes through the origin (0, 0, 0). Now, the trace 
of the plane in the xz-plane (y  0) is z  x, whereas its trace in the yz-plane (x  0) is z  y. 
Drawing these two lines leads to the graph given in FIGURE 7.5.7.
Two planes 1 and 2 that are not parallel must intersect in a line +. See FIGURE 7.5.8. 
Example 13 will illustrate one way of finding parametric equations for the line of intersection. 
In Example 14 we shall see how to find a point of intersection (x0, y0, z0) of a plane  and a 
line +. See FIGURE 7.5.9.
EXAMPLE 13 
Line of Intersection of Two Planes
Find parametric equations for the line of intersection of
 
2x  3y  4z  1
 
    x  y  z  5.
SOLUTION In a system of two equations and three unknowns, we choose one variable arbi-
trarily, say z  t, and solve for x and y from
 
2x  3y  1  4t
 
x  y  5  t.
Proceeding, we find x  14  7t, y  9  6t, z  t. These are parametric equations for the 
line of intersection of the given planes.
EXAMPLE 14 
Point of Intersection of a Line and a Plane
Find the point of intersection of the plane 3x  2y  z  5 and the line x  1  t, 
y  2  2t, z  4t.
SOLUTION If (x0, y0, z0) denotes the point of intersection, then we must have 3x0  2y0  z0  
5 and x0  1  t0, y0  2  2t0, z0  4t0, for some number t0. Substituting the latter equa-
tions into the equation of the plane gives
 
3(1  t0)  2(2  2t0)  4t0  5   or   t0   4.
From the parametric equations for the line, we then obtain x0  3, y0  10, and z0  16. 
The point of intersection is (3, 10, 16).

REMARKS
In everyday speech, the words orthogonal, perpendicular, and normal are often used 
interchangeably in the sense that two objects touch, intersect, or abut at a 90 angle. But in 
recent years an unwritten convention has arisen to use these terms in specific mathematical 
contexts. As a general rule, we say that two vectors are orthogonal, two lines (or two planes) 
are perpendicular, and that a vector is normal to a plane.

Vector Spaces
INTRODUCTION 
In the preceding sections we were dealing with points and vectors in 2- and 
3-space. Mathematicians in the nineteenth century, notably the English mathematicians Arthur 
Cayley (1821–1895) and James Joseph Sylvester (1814–1897) and the Irish mathematician 
William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865), realized that the concepts of point and vector could 
be generalized. A realization developed that vectors could be described, or defined, by analytic 
rather than geometric properties. This was a truly significant breakthrough in the history of 
mathematics. There is no need to stop with three dimensions;  ordered quadruples a1, a2, a3, a4, 
quintuples a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, and n-tuples a1, a2, … , an of real numbers can be thought of as 
vectors just as well as ordered pairs a1, a2 and  ordered triples a1, a2, a3; the only difference 
being that we lose our ability to visualize  directed line segments or arrows in 4-dimensional, 
5-dimensional, or n-dimensional space.

| CHAPTER 7 Vectors
 n-Space In formal terms, a vector in n-space is any ordered n-tuple a  a1, a2, … , an  of 
real numbers called the components of a. The set of all vectors in n-space is denoted by R n. The 
concepts of vector addition, scalar multiplication, equality, and so on, listed in Definition 7.2.1 
carry over to R n in a natural way. For example, if a  a1, a2, … , an  and b  b1, b2, … , bn , 
then addition and scalar multiplication in n-space are defined by
 
a  b  a1  b1, a2  b2, … , an  bn    and   ka  ka1, ka2, … , kan . 
(1)
The zero vector in R n is 0  0, 0, … , 0. The notion of length or magnitude of a vector 
a  a1, a2, … , an in n-space is just an extension of that concept in 2- and 3-space:
 
iai  "a2
1  a2
2  p  a2
n.
The length of a vector is also called its norm. A unit vector is one whose norm is 1. For a nonzero 
vector a, the process of constructing a unit vector u by multiplying a by the reciprocal 
of its norm, that is, u  1
iai
 a, is referred to as normalizing a. For example, if a  3, 1, 2, 1, 
then iai  "32  12  22  (1)2  "15 and a unit vector is

The standard inner product, also known as the Euclidean inner product or dot product, 
of two n-vectors a  a1, a2, … , an and b  b1, b2, … , bn is the real number defined by
 
a 
 b  a1, a2, … , an 
 b1, b2, … , bn  a1b1  a2b2  


  anbn.

Two nonzero vectors a and b in R n are said to be orthogonal if and only if a 
 b  0. For 
example, a  3, 4, 1, 6 and b  1, 1
2, 1, 1 are orthogonal in R 4 since a

 Vector Space We can even go beyond the notion of a vector as an ordered n-tuple in R n. A 
vector can be defined as anything we want it to be: an ordered n-tuple, a number, an array of numbers, 
or even a function. But we are particularly interested in vectors that are elements in a special kind 
of set called a vector space. Fundamental to the notion of vector space are two kinds of objects, 
vectors and scalars, and two algebraic operations analogous to those given in (1). For a set of vec-
tors we want to be able to add two vectors in this set and get another vector in the same set, and we 
want to multiply a vector by a scalar and obtain a vector in the same set. To determine whether a 
set of objects is a vector space depends on whether the set possesses these two algebraic operations 
along with certain other properties. These properties, the axioms of a vector space, are given next.
Definition 7.6.1 
Vector Space
Let V be a set of elements on which two operations called vector addition and scalar multiplication 
are defined. Then V is said to be a vector space if the following 10 properties are satisfied.
Axioms for Vector Addition:
(i)

In this brief introduction to abstract vectors we shall take the scalars in Definition 7.6.1 to be 
real numbers. In this case V is referred to as a real vector space, although we shall not belabor this 
term. When the scalars are allowed to be complex numbers we obtain a complex vector space. 
Since properties (i)–(viii) on page 352 are the prototypes for the axioms in Definition 7.6.1, it is 
clear that R2 is a vector space. Moreover, since vectors in R3 and R n have these same properties, 
we conclude that R3 and R n are also vector spaces. Axioms (i) and (vi) are called the closure
axioms and we say that a vector space V is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication. 
Note, too, that concepts such as length and inner product are not part of the axiomatic structure 
of a vector space.
EXAMPLE 1 
Checking the Closure Axioms
Determine whether the sets (a)  V  {1} and (b)  V  {0} under ordinary addition and mul-
tiplication by real numbers are vector spaces.
SOLUTION (a)  For this system consisting of one element, many of the axioms given in 
Definition 7.6.1 are violated. In particular, axioms (i) and (vi) of closure are not satisfied. 
Neither the sum 1  1  2 nor the scalar multiple k  1  k, for k  1, is in V. Hence V is 
not a vector space.
(b)  In this case the closure axioms are satisfied since 0  0  0 and k  0  0 for any real 
number k. The commutative and associative axioms are satisfied since 0  0  0  0 and 
0  (0  0)  (0  0)  0. In this manner it is easy to verify that the remaining axioms are 
also satisfied. Hence V is a vector space.
The vector space V  {0} is often called the trivial or zero vector space.
If this is your first experience with the notion of an abstract vector, then you are cautioned 
to not take the names vector addition and scalar multiplication too literally. These operations 
are defined and as such you must accept them at face value even though these operations may 
not bear any resemblance to the usual understanding of ordinary addition and multiplication in, 
say, R, R 2, R 3, or R n. For example, the addition of two vectors x and y could be x  y. With this 
forewarning, consider the next example.
EXAMPLE 2 
An Example of a Vector Space
Consider the set V of positive real numbers. If x and y denote positive real numbers, then we 
write vectors in V as x  x and y  y. Now, addition of vectors is defined by
 
x  y  xy
and scalar multiplication is defined by
 
kx  x k.
Determine whether V is a vector space.
SOLUTION We shall go through all ten axioms in Definition 7.6.1.
 (i) 
For x  x  0 and y  y  0, x  y  xy  0. Thus, the sum x  y is in V; V is 
closed under addition.
 (ii) 
Since multiplication of positive real numbers is commutative, we have for all 
x  x and y  y in V, x  y  xy  yx  y  x. Thus, addition is commutative.
 (iii) For all x  x, y  y, z  z in V,
 
x  (y  z)  x(yz)  (xy)z  (x  y)  z.
Thus, addition is associative.
 (iv) Since 1  x  1x  x  x and x  1  x1  x  x, the zero vector 0 is 1  1.
 (v) 
If we define x  1
x, then
 
x  (x)  x 1
x  1  1  0 and (x)  x  1
x x  1  1  0.
Therefore, the negative of a vector is its reciprocal.

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
 (vi) If k is any scalar and x  x  0 is any vector, then k x  x k  0. Hence V is closed 
under scalar multiplication.
 (vii) If k is any scalar, then
 
k(x  y)  (xy)k  xkyk  kx  ky.
 (viii) For scalars k1 and k2,
 
(k1  k2)x  x
 (k1k2) xk1 xk2 k1x  k2x.
 (ix) For scalars k1 and k2,
 
k1(k2x)  (x
 k2)k1 x
 k1 k2  (k1k2)x.
 (x) 
1x  x1  x  x.
Since all the axioms of Definition 7.6.1 are satisfied, we conclude that V is a vector space.
Here are some important vector spaces—we have mentioned some of these previously. The 
operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are the usual operations associated with 
the set.
• The set R of real numbers
• The set R2 of ordered pairs
• The set R3 of ordered triples
• The set R n of ordered n-tuples
• The set Pn of polynomials of degree less than or equal to n
• The set P of all polynomials
• The set of real-valued functions f defined on the entire real line
• The set C[a, b] of real-valued functions f continuous on the closed interval [a, b]
•  The set C(q, q) of real-valued functions f continuous on the entire real line
•  The set C n[a, b] of all real-valued functions f for which f, f , f  , … , f  (n) exist and are 
continuous on the closed interval [a, b]
 Subspace It may happen that a subset of vectors W of a vector space V is itself a vector 
space.
Definition 7.6.2 
Subspace
If a subset W of a vector space V is itself a vector space under the operations of vector addition 
and scalar multiplication defined on V, then W is called a subspace of V.
Every vector space V has at least two subspaces: V itself and the zero subspace {0}; {0} is a 
subspace since the zero vector must be an element in every vector space.
To show that a subset W of a vector space V is a subspace, it is not necessary to demonstrate 
that all ten axioms of Definition 7.6.1 are satisfied. Since all the vectors in W are also in V, these 
vectors must satisfy axioms such as (ii) and (iii). In other words, W inherits most of the proper-
ties of a vector space from V. As the next theorem indicates, we need only check the two closure 
axioms to demonstrate that a subset W is a subspace of V.
Theorem 7.6.1 
Criteria for a Subspace
A nonempty subset W of a vector space V is a subspace of V if and only if W is closed under 
vector addition and scalar multiplication defined on V:
(i) If x and y are in W, then x  y is in W.
(ii) If x is in W and k is any scalar, then k x is in W.
EXAMPLE 3 
A Subspace
Suppose f and g are continuous real-valued functions defined on the entire real line. Then we 
know from calculus that f  g and k f, for any real number k, are continuous and real-valued 
functions. From this we can conclude that C(q, q) is a subspace of the vector space of 
real-valued functions defined on the entire real line.

EXAMPLE 4 
A Subspace
The set Pn of polynomials of degree less than or equal to n is a subspace of C(q, q), the 
set of real-valued functions continuous on the entire real line.
It is always a good idea to have concrete visualizations of vector spaces and subspaces. The 
subspaces of the vector space R3 of three-dimensional vectors can be easily visualized by think-
ing of a vector as a point (a1, a2, a3). Of course, {0} and R 3 itself are subspaces; other subspaces 
are all lines passing through the origin, and all planes passing through the origin. The lines and 
planes must pass through the origin since the zero vector 0  (0, 0, 0) must be an element in 
each subspace.
Similar to Definition 3.1.1 we can define linearly independent vectors.
Definition 7.6.3 
Linear Independence
A set of vectors {x1, x2, … , xn} is said to be linearly independent if the only constants satis-
fying the equation
 
k1x1  k2x2  


  kn x n  0 
(3)
are k1  k2  


  kn  0. If the set of vectors is not linearly independent, then it is said to 
be linearly dependent.
In R3, the vectors i  1, 0, 0, j  0, 1, 0, and k  0, 0, 1 are linearly independent since 
the equation k1i  k2 j  k3k  0 is the same as
 
k11, 0, 0  k20, 1, 0  k30, 0, 1  0, 0, 0   or   k1, k2, k3  0, 0, 0.
By equality of vectors, (iii) of Definition 7.2.1, we conclude that k1  0, k2  0, and k3  0. In 
Definition 7.6.3, linear dependence means that there are constants k1, k2, … , kn not all zero such 
that k1x1  k2x2  


  knxn  0. For example, in R3 the vectors a  1, 1, 1, b  2, 1, 4, 
and c  5, 2, 7 are linearly dependent since (3) is satisfied when k1  3, k2  1, and k3  1:
 
31, 1, 1  2, 1, 4  5, 2, 7  0, 0, 0   or   3a  b  c  0.
We observe that two vectors are linearly independent if neither is a constant multiple of the 
other.
 Basis Any vector in R 3 can be written as a linear combination of the linearly independent 
vectors i, j, and k. In Section 7.2, we said that these vectors form a basis for the system of three-
dimensional vectors.
Definition 7.6.4 
Basis for a Vector Space
Consider a set of vectors B  {x1, x2, … , xn} in a vector space V. If the set B is linearly 
independent and if every vector in V can be expressed as a linear combination of these vectors, 
then B is said to be a basis for V.
 Standard Bases Although we cannot prove it in this course, every vector space has a basis. 
The vector space Pn of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to n has the basis {1, x, x2, … , xn} 
since any vector (polynomial) p(x) of degree n or less can be written as the linear combination 
p(x)  cnxn  


  c2x2  c1x  c0. A vector space may have many bases. We mentioned previ-
ously the set of vectors {i, j, k} is a basis for R 3. But it can be proved that {u1, u2, u3}, where
 
u1  1, 0, 0,   u2  1, 1, 0,   u3  1, 1, 1
is a linearly independent set (see Problem 23 in Exercises 7.6) and, furthermore, every vector 
a  a1, a2, a3 can be expressed as a linear combination a  c1u1  c2u2  c3u3. Hence, the set 
of vectors {u1, u2, u3} is another basis for R3. Indeed, any set of three linearly independent vec-
tors is a basis for that space. However, as mentioned in Section 7.2, the set {i, j, k} is referred to 
as the standard basis for R3. The standard basis for the space Pn is {1, x, x2, … , xn}. For the

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
vector space R n, the standard basis consists of the n vectors
 
e1  1, 0, 0, … , 0, e2  0, 1, 0, … , 0, … , en  0, 0, 0, … , 1. 
(4)
If B is a basis for a vector space V, then for every vector v in V there exist scalars ci, i  1, 2, . . . , n
such that
 
v  c1x2  c2x2  p  cnxn. 
(5)
The scalars ci , i  1, 2, … , n, in the linear combination (5) are called the coordinates of v relative 
to the basis B. In R n, the n-tuple notation a1, a2, … , an for a vector a means that real numbers 
a1, a2, … , an are the coordinates of a relative to the standard basis with ei’s in the precise order 
given in (4).
 Dimension If a vector space V has a basis B consisting of n vectors, then it can be proved 
that every basis for that space must contain n vectors. This leads to the next definition.
Definition 7.6.5 
Dimension of a Vector Space
The number of vectors in a basis B for a vector space V is said to be the dimension of the 
space.
EXAMPLE 5 
Dimensions of Some Vector Spaces
(a) In agreement with our intuition, the dimensions of the vector spaces R, R 2, R 3, and R n 
are, in turn, 1, 2, 3, and n.
(b) Since there are n  1 vectors in the standard basis B  {1, x, x2, … , x n}, the dimension 
of the vector space Pn of polynomials of degree less than or equal to n is n  1.
(c) The zero vector space {0} is given special consideration. This space contains only 0 
and since {0} is a linearly dependent set, it is not a basis. In this case it is customary to take 
the empty set as the basis and to define the dimension of {0} as zero.
If the basis of a vector space V contains a finite number of vectors, then we say that the vector 
space is finite dimensional; otherwise it is infinite dimensional. The function space C  n(I ) of n 
times continuously differentiable functions on an interval I is an example of an infinite-dimensional 
vector space.
 Linear Differential Equations Consider the homogeneous linear nth-order differential 
equation
 
an(x) d
 ny
dx
 n  an21(x) d
 n21y
dx
 n21  p  a1(x) dy
dx  a0(x)y  0 
(6)
on an interval I on which the coefficients are continuous and an(x)  0 for every x in the interval. 
A solution y1 of (6) is necessarily a vector in the vector space C  n(I). In addition, we know from 
the theory examined in Section 3.1 that if y1 and y2 are solutions of (6), then the sum y1  y2 and 
any constant multiple ky1 are also solutions. Since the solution set is closed under addition and 
scalar multiplication, it follows from Theorem 7.6.1 that the solution set of (6) is a subspace of 
C  n(I  ). Hence the solution set of (6) deserves to be called the solution space of the differential 
equation. We also know that if {y1, y2, … , yn} is a linearly independent set of solutions of (6), 
then its general solution of the differential equation is the linear combination
 
y  c1y1(x)  c2 y2(x)  p  cn yn(x).
Recall that any solution of the equation can be found from this general solution by specialization 
of the constants c1, c2, … , cn. Therefore, the linearly independent set of solutions {y1, y2, … , yn} 
is a basis for the solution space. The dimension of this solution space is n.
EXAMPLE 6 
Dimension of a Solution Space
The general solution of the homogeneous linear second-order differential equation y  25y  0 
is y  c1 cos 5x  c2 sin 5x. A basis for the solution space consists of the linearly independent 
vectors {cos 5x, sin 5x}. The solution space is two-dimensional.
Read the last sentence 
several times.

The set of solutions of a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation is not a vector space. Several 
axioms of a vector space are not satisfied; most notably the set of solutions does not contain a zero 
vector. In other words, y  0 is not a solution of a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation.
 Span If S denotes any set of vectors {x1, x2, … , xn} in a vector space V, then the set of all 
linear combinations of the vectors x1, x2, … , xn in S,
 
{k1x1  k2x2  p  knxn},
where the ki, i  1, 2, … , n are scalars, is called the span of the vectors and written Span(S) 
or Span(x1, x2, … , xn). It is left as an exercise to show that Span(S) is a subspace of the vector 
space V. See Problem 33 in Exercises 7.6. Span(S) is said to be a subspace spanned by the vectors 
x1, x2, … , xn. If V  Span(S), then we say that S is a spanning set for the vector space V, or that 
S spans V. For example, each of the three sets
 
{i, j, k},   {i, i  j, i  j  k},   and   {i, j, k, i  j, i  j  k}
are spanning sets for the vector space R 3. But note that the first two sets are linearly independent, 
whereas the third set is dependent. With these new concepts we can rephrase Definitions 7.6.4 
and 7.6.5 in the following manner:
A set S of vectors {x1, x2, … , xn} in a vector space V is a basis for V if S is linearly  
independent and is a spanning set for V. The number of vectors in this spanning set S is 
the dimension of the space V.
REMARKS
(i) Suppose V is an arbitrary real vector space. If there is an inner product defined on V it need not 
look at all like the standard or Euclidean inner product defined on R  n. In Chapter 12 we will work 
with an inner product that is a definite integral. We shall denote an inner product that is not the 
Euclidean inner product by the symbol (u, v). See Problems 30, 31, and 38(b) in Exercises 7.6.
(ii) A vector space V on which an inner product has been defined is called an inner product 
space. A vector space V can have more than one inner product defined on it. For example, a 
non-Euclidean inner product defined on R2 is (u, v)  u1v1  4u2v2, where u  u1, u2 and 
v  v1, v2. See Problems 37 and 38(a) in Exercises 7.6.
(iii) A lot of our work in the later chapters in this text takes place in an infinite-dimensional 
vector space. As such, we need to extend the definition of linear independence of a finite set 
of vectors S  {x1, x2, … , xn} given in Definition 7.6.3 to an infinite set:
An infinite set of vectors S  {x1, x2, …} is said to be linearly independent if every 
finite subset of the set S is linearly independent. If the set S is not linearly independent, 
then it is linearly dependent.
We note that if S contains a linearly dependent subset, then the entire set S is linearly dependent.
The vector space P of all polynomials has the standard basis B  {1, x, x 2, …}. The infinite 
set B is linearly independent. P is another example of an infinite-dimensional vector space.
In Problems 1–10, determine whether the given set is a vector 
space. If not, give at least one axiom that is not satisfied. Unless 
stated to the contrary, assume that vector addition and scalar 
multiplication are the ordinary operations defined on that set.

Gram–Schmidt Orthogonalization Process
INTRODUCTION 
In Section 7.6 we saw that a vector space V can have many different bases. 
Recall, the defining characteristics of any basis B  {x1, x2, … , xn} of a vector space V is that
• the set B is linearly independent, and
• the set B spans the space.
In this context the word span means that every vector in the space can be expressed as a linear 
combination of the vectors x1, x2, … , xn. For example, every vector u in R n can be written as a 
linear combination of the vectors in the standard basis B  {e1, e2, … , en}, where
 
e1  1, 0, 0, … , 0,   e2  0, 1, 0, … , 0,   …,   en  0, 0, 0, … , 1.
This standard basis B  {e1, e2, … , en} is also an example of an orthonormal basis; that is, the 
ei , i  1, 2, … , n are mutually orthogonal and are unit vectors; that is,
 
ei  ej  0, i  j   and   ieii  1, i  1, 2, … , n.
In this section we focus on orthonormal bases for R n and examine a procedure whereby we 
can transform or convert any basis B of R n into an orthonormal basis.

is linearly independent and spans the space R 3. Hence B  {w1, w2, w3} is a basis for R 3. 
Using the standard inner product or dot product defined on R 3, observe
 
w1  w2  0, w1  w3  0, w2  w3  0,  and  iw1i  1, iw2i  1, iw3i  1.
Hence B is an orthonormal basis.
A basis B for R n need not be orthogonal nor do the basis vectors need to be unit  vectors. In 
fact, any linearly independent set of n vectors can serve as a basis for the n-dimensional vector 
space R n. For example, it is a straightforward task to show that the vectors
 
u1  1, 0, 0,    u2  1, 1, 0,    u3  1, 1, 1
in R 3 are linearly independent and hence B  {u1, u2, u3} is a basis for R 3. Note that B is not an 
orthogonal basis.
Generally, an orthonormal basis for a vector space V turns out to be the most convenient basis 
for V. One of the advantages that an orthonormal basis has over any other basis for R n is the 
comparative ease with which we can obtain the coordinates of a vector u relative to 
that basis.
Theorem 7.7.1 
Coordinates Relative to an Orthonormal Basis
Suppose B  {w1, w2, … , wn} is an orthonormal basis for R n. If u is any vector in R n, then
 
 u  (u  w1)w1  (u  w2)w2  p  (u  wn )wn.
PROOF: The vector u is in R n and so it is an element of the set Span(B). In other words, there 
exist real scalars ki, i  1, 2, … , n such that u can be expressed as the linear combination
 
u  k1w1  k2w2  p  knwn.

CHAPTER 7 Vectors
The scalars ki are the coordinates of u relative to the basis B. These coordinates can be found by 
taking the dot product of u with each of the basis vectors:
 u 
 wi  (k1w1  k2w2  p  knwn) 
 wi  k1(w1 
 wi)  k2(w2 
 wi)  p  kn(wn 
 wi). (2)
Since B is orthonormal, wi is orthogonal to all vectors in B with the exception of wi itself. 
That is, wi 
 wj  0, i  j and wi 
 wi  iwii2  1. Hence from (2), we obtain ki  (u 
 wi) 
for i  1, 2, … , n.
EXAMPLE 2 
Coordinates of a Vector in R  3
Find the coordinates of the vector u   3, 2, 9 relative to the orthonormal basis B for R 3 
given in (1) of Example 1. Write u in terms of the basis B.
SOLUTION From Theorem 7.7.1, the coordinates of u relative to the basis B in (1) of Example 1 
are simply
 
u 
 w1  10
"3
 , u 
 w2 

Hence we can write

 Gram–Schmidt Orthogonalization Process The procedure known as the Gram–
Schmidt orthogonalization process is a straightforward algorithm for generating an orthogonal 
basis B  {v1, v2, … , vn} from any given basis B  {u1, u2, … , un} for R n. We then produce an 
orthonormal basis B  {w1, w2, … , wn} by normalizing the vectors in the orthogonal basis B. 
The key idea in the orthogonalization process is vector projection, and so we suggest that you 
review that concept in Section 7.3. Also, for the sake of gaining some geometric insight into the 
process, we shall begin in R 2 and R 3.
 Constructing an Orthogonal Basis for R   2 The Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization 
process for R n is a sequence of steps; at each step we construct a vector vi that is orthogonal to 
the vector in the preceding step. The transformation of a basis B  {u1, u2} for R 2 into an or-
thogonal basis B  {v1, v2} consists of two steps. See FIGURE 7.7.1(a). The first step is simple, 
we merely choose one of the vectors in B, say, u1, and rename it v1. Next, as shown in Figure 
7.7.1(b), we project the remaining vector u2 in B onto the vector v1 and define a second vector 
to be v2  u2  projv1u2. Recall from (12) of Section 7.3 that projv1u2  au2 
 v1

Figure 7.7.1(c), the vectors
 
 v1  u1
 
(3)
 v2  u2 2 au2 
 v1
v1

b v1
are orthogonal. If you are not convinced of this, we suggest you verify the orthogonality of v1
and v2 by demonstrating that v1 
 v2  0.
EXAMPLE 3

The set B  {u1, u2}, where u1  3, 1, u2  1, 1, is a basis for R 2. Transform B into an

SOLUTION We choose v1 as u1: v1  3, 1. Then from the second equation in (3), with 
u2

 v1  10, we obtain

The set B  {v1, v2}  {3, 1, 1

The basis B is shown in FIGURE 7.7.2(a), and the new orthonormal basis B  {w1, w2} is shown 
in blue in Figure 7.7.2(b).
In Example 3 we are free to choose either vector in B  {u1, u2} as the vector v1. However, 
by choosing v1  u2  1, 1, we obtain a different orthonormal basis, namely, B   {w1, w2}, 
where w1  1 "2, 1 "2 and w2  1 "2, 1 "2. See Problems 5–8 in Exercises 7.7.
 Constructing an Orthogonal Basis for R 3 Now suppose B  {u1, u2, u3} is a basis 
for R 3. Then the set B  {v1, v2, v3}, where
 
 v1  u1
 
   v2  u2 2 au2  v1
v1  v1
b v1 
(4)
 
 v3  u3 2 au3  v1
v1  v1
b v1 2 au3  v2
v2  v2
b v2
is an orthogonal basis for R3. Again, if you do not see this, then compute v1  v2, v1  v3, and 
v2  v3.
Since the vectors v1 and v2 in the list (4) are by construction orthogonal, the set {v1, v2} must 
be linearly independent. See Problem 36 in Exercises 7.6. Thus, W2  Span(v1, v2) is necessarily 
a two-dimensional subspace of R 3. Now the vector x  au3  v1
v1  v1
b v1  au3  v2
v2  v2
b v2 is a vector 
in W2 because it is a linear combination of v1 and v2. The vector x is called the orthogonal 
projection of u3 onto the subspace W2 and is usually denoted by x  projW2 u3. In FIGURE 7.7.3, 
x is the red vector. Notice, too, that x is the sum of two projections. Using (12) of Section 7.3, 
we can write 
 
projv1 u3 
projv2 u3
 
 
 
  x  projW2
 u3  au3  v1
v1  v1
b v1  au3  v2
v2  v2
b v2. 
(5)
The difference v3  u3  x is orthogonal to x. Indeed, v3 is orthogonal to v1 and v2 and to every 
vector in W2. This is precisely the same idea in (3). In that context, v2  u2  x, where x was 
the projection of u2 onto the one-dimensional subspace W1  Span(v1) of R 2. Analogous to (5), 
we have
 
projv1 u2
 
 
x   projW1
 u2  au2  v1
v1  v1
b v1.

As in Example 3, we finish the job by normalizing each vector in B. Using iv1i  "3, 
iv2i  "6>3, iv3i  "2>2, and wi  1
ivii vi, i  1, 2, 3, we find that an orthonormal basis

The set B is recognized as the orthonormal basis for R3 examined in Example 1.
We conclude this section with a theorem that summarizes the most general case of the 
Gram–Schmidt process for R n. The orthogonalization process can be used on any linearly 
independent set S, and so we can use it to find orthonormal bases for subspaces of R n.

REMARKS
Although we have focused on R n in the foregoing discussion, the orthogonalization process 
summarized in (7) of Theorem 7.7.2 holds in all vector spaces V on which an inner product 
(u, v) is defined. In this case, we replace the symbol R n in (7) with the words “an inner product 
space V  ” and each dot product symbol u  v with (u, v). See Problems 17 and 18 in Exercises 7.7.
In Problems 1 and 2, verify that the basis B for the given vector 
space is orthonormal. Use Theorem 7.7.1 to find the coordinates 
of the vector u relative to the basis B. Then write u as a linear

In mathematics one is often 
faced with the task of handling 
large arrays of numbers or 
functions. Such an array is called 
a matrix. The theory of matrices 
was the invention of the eminent 
English mathematician Arthur 
Cayley (1821–1895).

8.1 
Matrix Algebra
INTRODUCTION 
In the last section of Chapter 7 we saw that a vector in R n is an ordered 
n-tuple (x1, x2, . . ., xn). Vectors are also written as a horizontal or vertical array with no commas:
 
(x1 x2 p xn) or  ±
x1
x2
(
xn
≤. 
(1)
Each array in (1) is called a matrix. Our objective in this section is to consider the algebra of 
such arrays.
 A Definition The arrays in (1) are just special cases of (2) in the definition that follows.
Definition 8.1.1 
Matrix
A matrix is any rectangular array of numbers or functions:

a12
p
a1n
a21
a22

am2
p
amn
≤. 
(2)
The numbers or functions in the array (2) are called entries or elements of the matrix. If a 
matrix has m rows and n columns we say that its size is m by n (written m  n). An n  n matrix 
is called a square matrix or a matrix of order n. A 1  1 matrix is simply a constant or a single 
function. For example, A  a1 2 5
6 9 3b is a 2  3 matrix, whereas
 
B  ±

is a 4  4 square matrix or a matrix of order 4. Throughout this text we shall denote a matrix by 
a capital boldfaced letter such as A, B, C, or X.
The entry in the ith row and jth column of an m  n matrix A is written aij. An m  n matrix 
A is then abbreviated as A  (aij)mn. For an n  n square matrix, the entries a11, a22, . . . , ann are 
called the main diagonal entries. The main diagonal entries for the matrix B in (3) are 9, 2, 
1, and 4.
Definition 8.1.2 
Column and Row Vectors
An n  1 matrix,
 
±

is called a column vector. A 1  n matrix,
 
(a1 a2 . . . an),
is called a row vector.

Definition 8.1.3 
Equality of Matrices
Two m  n matrices A and B are equal if aij  bij for each i and j.
In other words, two matrices are equal if and only if they have the same size and their 
corresponding entries are equal.
EXAMPLE 1 
Equality
(a) The matrices a1
1
1
1b and a1
1 1
1 1
1b are not equal, since the size of the first  matrix 
is 2  2 and the size of the second matrix is 2  3.
(b) The matrices a1
2
3
4b and a1
2
4
3b are not equal, since the corresponding entries in the 
second rows of the matrices are not the same.
 Matrix Addition When two matrices A and B are of the same size we can add them by 
adding their corresponding entries.
Definition 8.1.4 
Matrix Addition
If A and B are m  n matrices, then their sum is
 
A  B  (aij  bij)mn.

Definition 8.1.5 
Scalar Multiple of a Matrix
If k is a real number, then the scalar multiple of a matrix A is
 
kA  §

ka22

In other words, to compute kA, we simply multiply each entry of A by k. For example, from 
Definition 8.1.5,

1b  a5 2
5 (3)

We note in passing that for any matrix A the scalar multiple kA is the same as Ak.
The difference of two m  n matrices is defined in the usual manner: A  B  A  (B) 
where B  (1)B.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
The following theorem summarizes some of the properties of matrix addition and scalar multi-
plication. Each of the six parts of the theorem can be proved using Definitions 8.1.4 and 8.1.5.
Theorem 8.1.1 
Properties of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication
Suppose A, B, and C are m  n matrices and k1 and k2 are scalars. Then
(i) A  B  B  A 
d commutative law of addition
(ii) A  (B  C)  (A  B)  C 
d associative law of addition
(iii) (k1k2)A  k1(k2A)
(iv) 1A  A
(v) k1(A  B)  k1A  k1B 
d distributive law
(vi) (k1  k2)A  k1A  k2A 
d distributive law
 Matrix Multiplication We have just seen that any matrix A can be multiplied by a scalar. 
But can two matrices be multiplied together? The next definition gives the answer.
Definition 8.1.6

n columns. The product AB is the m  n matrix

Definition 8.1.6 states that the product C  AB is defined only when the number of columns 
in the matrix A is the same as the number of rows in B. The dimension of the product can be 
determined from
 
Am  pBp  n  Cm  n .
 
Also, you might recognize that the entries in, say, the ith row of the final matrix C  AB are 
formed by using the component definition of the inner or dot product of the ith row (vector) of 
A with each of the columns (vectors) of B.
EXAMPLE 3

3 9  5 6
3  (2)  5 8b  a78

The number of columns of 
A must equal the number of 
rows of B.

Unlike matrix addition, matrix multiplication is, in general, not commutative. That is, BA  AB. 
Observe that in part (a) of Example 3, BA  a30
53
48
82b, whereas in part (b) the product BA is 
not defined because the first matrix (in this case, B) does not have the same number of columns 
as the second matrix has rows.
The product of an m  n matrix with an n  1 column vector is an m  1 column vector. For 
example,
 
a4
2
3
8b ax1
x2
b  a4x1  2x2
3x1  8x2
b  . 
(4)
It is often convenient to write a column vector as a sum of two or more column vectors. In view 
of Definitions 8.1.4 and 8.1.5, the result in (4) can be written
 
a4x1  2x2
3x1  8x2
b  x1a4
3b  x2a2
8b  .
 Associative Law Although we shall not prove it, matrix multiplication is associative. If 
A is an m  p matrix, B a p  r matrix, and C an r  n matrix, then the product
 
A(BC)  (AB)C
is an m  n matrix.
 Distributive Law If B and C are both r  n matrices and A is an m  r matrix, then the 
distributive law is
 
A(B  C)  AB  AC.
Furthermore, if the product (B  C)A is defined, then
 
(B  C)A  BA  CA.
Definition 8.1.7 
Transpose of a Matrix
The transpose of the m  n matrix (2) is the n  m matrix AT given by
 
AT  ±
a11
a21
p

In other words, the rows of a matrix A become the columns of its transpose AT.

In the next theorem we give some important properties of the transpose.
Theorem 8.1.2 
Properties of Transpose
Suppose A and B are matrices and k a scalar. Then
(i) (AT)T  A 
d transpose of a transpose
(ii) (A  B)T  AT  BT 
d transpose of a sum
(iii) (AB)T  BTAT 
d transpose of a product
(iv) (kA)T  kAT 
d transpose of a scalar multiple
Of course, in properties (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 8.1.2 we assume that the sum and 
product of A and B are defined. Note carefully that part (iii) of the theorem indicates that 
the transpose of the product is the product of the transposes in reverse order. Moreover, 
(ii) and (iii) extend to any finite sum or product of matrices. For example, in the case of 
three matrices we have
 
(A  B  C)T  AT  BT  CT and (ABC)T  CTBTAT.
 Special Matrices In matrix theory there are many special kinds of matrices that are 
important because they possess certain properties. The following is a list of some of these 
 matrices:
•  A matrix that consists of all zero entries is called a zero matrix and is denoted by 0. For 
example,
 
0  a0
0b  , 0  a0
0
0
0b  , 0  °

are zero matrices. If A and 0 are m  n matrices, then
 
A  0  A. 
(5)
In addition, 
A  (A)  0. 
(6)
•  An n  n matrix A is said to be a triangular matrix if all its entries above the main diagonal 
are zeros or if all its entries below the main diagonal are zeros. In other words, a square 
matrix A = (aij)nn is triangular if aij  0 whenever i  j or aij  0 whenever i 	 j. More 
specifically, in the first case the matrix is called lower triangular, and in the second the 
matrix is called upper triangular. The following two matrices are triangular:

•  An n  n matrix A is said to be a diagonal matrix if all its entries not on the main diagonal 
are zeros. In terms of the symbolism A  (aij)nn, A is a diagonal matrix if aij  0 for i  j. 
The following is a diagonal matrix:

 is denoted by the symbol I (or In when there is a need to emphasize the order of the ma-
trix). For any m  n matrix A it is readily verified that Im A  A In  A. Because this last 
property is analogous to 1  a  a  1  a, for any real number a, the matrix I is called the 
identity matrix.
•  An n  n matrix A is said to be symmetric if AT  A; that is, A is symmetric if 
aij  aji for all i and j. This means that the entries in a symmetric matrix are symmetric 
with respect to the main diagonal of the matrix. For example, a quick inspection of the 
matrix

REMARKS
Suppose the symbol Mm,n denotes the set of all m  n matrices on which the operations of 
matrix addition and scalar multiplication are defined. Then
 
A  B is in Mm,n  and  kA is in Mm,n 
(7)
for every A and B in Mm,n and for every scalar k. That is to say, Mm,n is closed under matrix 
addition and scalar multiplication. When we combine (7) with properties (5) and (6) and the 
properties listed in Theorem 8.1.1, it follows immediately that Mm,n is a vector space. For 
practical purposes, the vector spaces M1,n (row vectors) and Mn,1 (column vectors) are indis-
tinguishable from the vector space R n.

system in which the coordinates of P are (x, y, z) and a 
spacecraft coordinate system that moves with the particular 
rotation. In Figure 8.1.2(b) we have illustrated a yaw—that 
is, a rotation around the z-axis (which is perpendicular to the 
plane of the paper). The coordinates (xY, yY, zY) of the point

8.2 Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations
INTRODUCTION 
Recall, any equation of the form ax  by  c, where a, b, and c are real num-
bers is said to be a linear equation in the variables x and y. The graph of a linear equation in two 
variables is a straight line. For real numbers a, b, c, and d, ax  by  cz  d is a linear equation in 
the variables x, y, and z and is the equation of a plane in 3-space. In general, an equation of the form
 
a1x1  a2x2  . . .  anxn  bn ,
where a1, a2, . . . , an, and bn are real numbers, is a linear equation in the n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn.
In this section we will study systems of linear equations. Systems of linear equations are 
also called linear systems.

 General Form A system of m linear equations in n variables, or unknowns, has the general form
 
a11x1  a12x2  . . .  a1nxn  b1
 
a21x1  a22x2  . . .  a2nxn  b2
 
o 
o 
(1)
 
am1x1  am2x2  . . .  amnxn  bm .
The coefficients of the variables in the linear system (1) can be abbreviated as aij, where i denotes 
the row and j denotes the column in which the coefficient appears. For example, a23 is the coefficient 
of the unknown in the second row and third column (that is, x3). Thus, i  1, 2, 3, . . ., m and j  1, 
2, 3, . . ., n. The numbers b1, b2, . . ., bm are called the constants of the system. If all the constants are 
zero, the system (1) is said to be homogeneous; otherwise it is nonhomogeneous. For example,
 
this system is homogeneous 
this system is nonhomogeneous

5x1  9x2  x3   0 
2x1  5x2  6x3  1
 
x1  3x2       0 
4x1  3x2   x3  9.
 
4x1  6x2  x3  0
 Solution A solution of a linear system (1) is a set of n numbers x1, x2, . . ., xn that satisfies 
each equation in the system. For example, x1  3, x2  1 is a solution of the system
 
3x1  6x2  3
 
x1  4x2  7.
To see this we replace x1 by 3 and x2 by 1 in each equation:
 
3(3)  6(1)  9  6  3  and  3  4(1)  3  4  7.
Solutions of linear systems are also written as an ordered n-tuple (x1, x2, . . ., xn). The solution for 
the above system is then the ordered pair (3, 1).
A linear system of equations is said to be consistent if it has at least one solution, and 
inconsistent if it has no solutions. If a linear system is consistent, it has either
• a unique solution (that is, precisely one solution), or
• infinitely many solutions.
Thus, a system of linear equations cannot have, say, exactly three solutions.
For a linear system with two equations and two variables, the lines in the plane, or 2-space, 
intersect at one point as in FIGURE 8.2.1(a) (unique solution), are identical as in Figure 8.2.1(b) 
(infinitely many solutions), or are parallel as in Figure 8.2.1(c) (no solutions).
For a linear system with three equations and three variables, each equation in the system 
represents a plane in 3-space. FIGURE 8.2.2 shows some of the many ways that this kind of linear 
system can be interpreted.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
EXAMPLE 1 
Verification of a Solution
Verify that x1  14  7t, x2  9  6t, x3  t, where t is any real number, is a solution of the 
system
 
2x1  3x2  4x3  1
 
   x1   x2   x3  5.
SOLUTION Replacing x1, x2, and x3 in turn by 14  7t, 9  6t, and t, we have
 
2(14  7t)  3(9  6t)  4t  1
 
14  7t   (9  6t)  t  5.
For each real number t we obtain a different solution of the system; in other words, the 
system has an infinite number of solutions. For instance, t  0, t  4, and t  2 give the 
three solutions
 
x1  14, 
x2  9, 
x3  0,
 
x1  42, 
x2  33, 
x3  4,
and 
x1  0, 
x2  3, 
x3  2,
respectively. Geometrically, each equation in the system represents a plane in R3. In this 
case, the planes intersect in a line as shown in Figure 8.2.2(b). Parametric equations of the 
line are x1  14  7t, x2  9  6t, x3  t. The solution can also be written as the ordered 
triple (x1, x2, x3) or (14  7t, 9  6t, t). 
 Solving Systems We can transform a system of linear equations into an equivalent 
system (that is, one having the same solutions) using the following elementary operations:
(i) 
Multiply an equation by a nonzero constant.
(ii) Interchange the positions of equations in the system.
(iii) Add a nonzero multiple of one equation to any other equation.
As the next example will show, these elementary operations enable us to systematically eliminate 
variables from the equations of the system.
EXAMPLE 2 
Solving a Linear System
Solve 
2x1  6x2   x3  7
 
x1  2x2   x3  1
 
5x1  7x2  4x3  9.
SOLUTION We begin by interchanging the first and second rows:
 
 x1  2x2   x3   1
 
2x1  6x2   x3  7
 
5x1  7x2  4x3  9.
Our goal now is to eliminate x1 from the second and third equations. If we add to the second 
equation 2 times the first equation, we obtain the equivalent system
 
 x1  2x2   x3   1
 
    2x2  3x3  9
 
5x1  7x2  4x3  9.

By adding to the third equation 5 times the first equation, we get a new equivalent 
system:
 
   x1  2x2   x3  1
 
   2x2  3x3  9
 
  3x2   x3   14.
We are now going to use the second equation to eliminate the variable x2 from the first and 
third equations. To simplify matters, let us multiply the second equation by 1
2:
 
x1  2x2     x3  1
 
    x2  3
2x3  9
2
 
   3x2   x3  14.
Adding to the first equation 2 times the second equation yields
 
x1     4x3  10
 
    x2  3
2x3  9
2
 
  3x2   x3  14.
Next, by adding 3 times the second equation to the third equation we get
 
x1         4x3  10
 
     x2  3
2x3  9
2
 
      11
2 x3  55
2 .
We shall use the last equation to eliminate the variable x3 from the first and second equations. 
To this end, we multiply the third equation by 2
11:
 
x1       4x3  10
 
    x2  3
2x3  9
2
 
       x3  5.
At this point we could use back-substitution; that is, substitute the value x3  5 back into 
the remaining equations to determine x1 and x2. However, by continuing with our systematic 
elimination, we add to the second equation 3
2 times the third equation:
 
x1      4x3  10
 
   x2       3
 
      x3   5.
Finally, by adding to the first equation 4 times the third equation, we obtain
 
x1 
 
 
 10
 
 
x2 
 
 3
 
 
 
x3  5.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
It is now apparent that x1  10, x2  3, x3  5 is the solution of the original system. The 
answer written as the ordered triple (10,  3, 5) means that the planes represented by the three 
equations in the system intersect at a point as in Figure 8.2.2(a). 
 Augmented Matrix Reflecting on the solution of the linear system in Example 2 should 
convince you that the solution of the system does not depend on what symbols are used as vari-
ables. Thus, the systems
 
2x  6y   z  7          2u  6v   w  7
 
 x  2y   z  1  and   u  2v   w  1
 
5x  7y  4z  9         5u  7v  4w  9
have the same solution as the system in Example 2. In other words, in the solution of a linear 
system, the symbols used to denote the variables are immaterial; it is the coefficients of the 
variables and the constants that determine the solution of the system. In fact, we can solve a 
system of form (1) by dropping the variables entirely and performing operations on the rows of 
the array of coefficients and constants:

system (1).

 Elementary Row Operations Since the rows of an augmented matrix represent the 
equations in a linear system, the three elementary operations on a linear system listed previously 
are equivalent to the following elementary row operations on a matrix:
(i) 
Multiply a row by a nonzero constant.
(ii) Interchange any two rows.
(iii) Add a nonzero multiple of one row to any other row.

Of course, when we add a multiple of one row to another, we add the corresponding entries in 
the rows. We say that two matrices are row equivalent if one can be obtained from the other 
through a sequence of elementary row operations. The procedure of carrying out elementary row 
operations on a matrix to obtain a row-equivalent matrix is called row reduction.
 Elimination Methods To solve a system such as (1) using an augmented matrix, we 
shall use either Gaussian elimination or the Gauss–Jordan elimination method. In the former 
method, we row-reduce the augmented matrix of the system until we arrive at a row-equivalent 
augmented matrix in row-echelon form:
(i) 
The first nonzero entry in a nonzero row is a 1.
(ii) In consecutive nonzero rows, the first entry 1 in the lower row appears to the right 
of the 1 in the higher row.
(iii) Rows consisting of all zeros are at the bottom of the matrix.
In the Gauss–Jordan method, the row operations are continued until we obtain an augmented 
matrix that is in reduced row-echelon form. A reduced row-echelon matrix has the same three 
properties listed previously, but in addition:
(iv) A column containing a first entry 1 has zeros everywhere else.

 are in reduced row-echelon form. Note that the remaining entries in the columns that contain 
a leading entry 1 are all zeros. 
It should be noted that in Gaussian elimination, we stop when we have obtained an augmented 
matrix in row-echelon form. In other words, by using different sequences of row operations, we 
may arrive at different row-echelon forms. This method then requires the use of back-substitution. 
In Gauss–Jordan elimination, we stop when we have obtained the augmented matrix in reduced 
row-echelon form. Any sequence of row operations will lead to the same augmented matrix in 
reduced row-echelon form. This method does not require back-substitution; the solution of the 
system will be apparent by inspection of the final matrix. In terms of the equations of the original 
system, our goal in both methods is simply to make the coefficient of x1 in the first equation* 
equal to one and then use multiples of that equation to eliminate x1 from other equations. The 
process is repeated for the other variables.
To keep track of the row operations used on an augmented matrix, we shall utilize the follow-
ing notation: 
 
Symbol 
Meaning
Ri 4 Rj 
Interchange rows i and j
cRi 
Multiply the ith row by the nonzero constant c
cRi  Rj 
Multiply the ith row by c and add to the jth row
*We can always interchange equations so that the first equation contains the variable x1.
Note: Row operations can 
lead to different row-echelon 
forms.

In this case, the last matrix in reduced row-echelon form implies that the original system 
of three equations in three variables is really equivalent to two equations in the variables.

Since only x3 is common to both equations (the nonzero rows), we can assign its values 
arbitrarily. If we let x3  t, where t represents any real number, then we see that the system 
has infinitely many solutions: x1  2  t, x2  3  t, x3  t. Geometrically, these equa-
tions are the parametric equations for the line of intersection of the planes x1  0x2  x3  2 
and 0x1  x2  x3  3.

The third row of the last matrix means 0x1  0x2  16 (or 0  16). Since no numbers x1 and 
x2 can satisfy this equation, we conclude that the system has no solution. 
Inconsistent systems of m linear equations in n variables will always yield the situation illustrated 
in Example 7; that is, there will be a row in the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented 
matrix in which the first n entries are zero and the (n  1)st entry is nonzero.
 Networks The currents in the branches of an electrical network can be determined by 
using Kirchhoff’s point and loop rules:
Point rule: The algebraic sum of the currents toward any branch point is 0.
Loop rule: The algebraic sum of the potential differences in any loop is 0.
When a loop is traversed in a chosen direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), an emf is taken to 
be positive when it is traversed from  to  and negative when traversed from  to . An iR prod-
uct is taken to be positive if the chosen direction through the resistor is opposite that of the assumed 
current, and negative if the chosen direction is in the same direction as the assumed current.
In FIGURE 8.2.3, the branch points of the network are labeled A and B, the loops are labeled L1 
and L2, and the chosen direction in each loop is clockwise. Now, applying the foregoing rules to 
the network yields the nonhomogeneous system of linear equations
 
  i1  i2  i3  0       i1    i2    i3      0

 Homogeneous Systems All the systems in the preceding examples are nonhomogeneous 
systems. As we have seen, a nonhomogeneous system can be consistent or inconsistent. By 
contrast, a homogeneous system of linear equations
 
a11x1  a12x2  . . .  a1nxn  0
 
a12x1  a22x2  . . .  a2nxn  0

o 
(4)
 
am1x1  am2x2  . . .  amnxn  0
is always consistent, since x1  0, x2  0, . . ., xn  0 will satisfy each equation in the system. 
The solution consisting of all zeros is called the trivial solution. But naturally we are interested 
in whether a system of form (4) has any solutions for which some of the xi, i  1, 2, . . ., n, are 
not zero. Such a solution is called a nontrivial solution. A homogeneous system either possesses 
only the trivial solution or possesses the trivial solution along with infinitely many nontrivial 
solutions. The next theorem, presented without proof, will give us a sufficient condition for the 
existence of nontrivial solutions.
Theorem 8.2.1 
Existence of Nontrivial Solutions
A homogeneous system of form (4) possesses nontrivial solutions if the number m of equa-
tions is less than the number n of variables (m  n).
EXAMPLE 9 
Solving a Homogeneous System
Solve 
2x1  4x2  3x3  0
x1  x2  2x3  0.
SOLUTION Since the number of equations is less than the number of variables, we know 
from Theorem 8.2.1 that the given system has nontrivial solutions. Using Gauss–Jordan elim-
ination, we find

obtain the trivial solution x1  0, x2  0, x3  0 for this system by choosing t  0. For t  0 
we get nontrivial solutions. For example, the solutions corresponding to t  6, t  12, and 
t  3 are, in turn, x1  5, x2  7, x3  6; x1  10, x2  14, x3  12; and x1  5

Balancing a Chemical Equation

SOLUTION We want to find positive integers x1, x2, x3, and x4 so that
 
x1C2H6  x2O2 S x3CO2  x4H2O.
Because the number of atoms of each element must be the same on each side of the last

carbon (C):   2x1  x3 
 
2x1  0x2   x3  0x4  0

and so x1  1

a manner so that x1, x2, and x3 are positive integers. To accomplish this we pick t  6. This 
gives x1  2, x2  7, x3  4, x4  6. The balanced chemical equation is then

such systems.

Theorem 8.2.2 
Two Properties of Homogeneous Systems
Let AX  0 denote a homogeneous system of linear equations.
(i) If X1 is a solution of AX  0, then so is cX1 for any constant c.
(ii) If X1 and X2 are solutions of AX  0, then so is X1  X2.
PROOF: (i) Because X1 is a solution, then AX1  0. Now
 
A(cX1)  c(AX1)  c0  0.
 This shows that a constant multiple of a solution of a homogeneous linear system is also 
a solution.
(ii) Because X1 and X2 are solutions, then AX1  0 and AX2  0. Now
 
A(X1  X2)  AX1  AX2   0  0  0.
This shows that X1  X2 is a solution.
By combining parts (i) and (ii) of Theorem 8.2.2 we can say that if X1 and X2 are solutions 
of AX  0, then so is the linear combination
 
c1X1  c2X2,
where c1 and c2 are constants. Moreover, this superposition principle extends to three or more 
solutions of AX  0.

is also a solution of the system. Verify this.
 Terminology Suppose a linear system has m equations and n variables. If there are more 
equations than variables, that is, m  n, then the system is said to be overdetermined. If the 
system has fewer equations than variables, that is, m  n, then the system is called underdeter-
mined. An overdetermined linear system may put too many constraints on the variables and so 
is usually—not always—inconsistent. The system in Example 7 is overdetermined and is incon-
sistent. On the other hand an underdetermined system is usually—but not always—consistent. 
The systems in Examples 9 and 10 are underdetermined and are consistent. It should be noted 
that it is impossible for a consistent underdetermined system to possess a single or unique solu-
tion. To see this, suppose that m  n. If Gaussian elimination is used to solve the system, then 
the row-echelon form that is row equivalent to the matrix of the system will contain r nonzero 
rows where r  m  n. Thus we can solve for r of the variables in terms of n  r  0 variables 
or parameters. If the underdetermined system is consistent, then those remaining n  r variables 
can be chosen arbitrarily and so the system has an infinite number of solutions.

REMARKS
(i) To solve large systems of linear equations, we obviously need the help of a computer. Since 
the two methods in this section are so systematic, they can be programmed easily. However, 
the requirement that each nonzero row start with a one may at times demand division by a 
very small number. Problems can then occur. Large systems are often solved indirectly—that 
is, by an approximation technique such as Gauss–Seidel iteration. See Section 16.1.
(ii) Since Gauss–Jordan elimination avoids the necessity of back-substitution, it would appear 
that it is the more efficient of the two methods we have considered. Actually, this is not the 
case. It has been shown that for large systems, Gauss–Jordan elimination can require about 
50% more operations than Gaussian elimination.
(iii) A consistent nonhomogeneous linear system AX  B, B  0, shares a property with 
nonhomogeneous linear differential equations. If Xh is a solution of the associated homoge-
neous system AX  0, and Xp is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system AX  B, 
then the superposition Xh  Xp is also a solution of the nonhomogeneous system. This is 
readily verified by the distributive law of matrix multiplication:
 
A(Xh  Xp)  AXh  AXp  0  B  B.
(iv) The set S of all solution vectors X of a homogeneous linear system with m equations and 
n variables,
 
S  {Xu AX  0}
is called the null-space of the matrix A.  If you have studied Section 7.6, then S is a subspace 
of the vector space Rn. See pages 354 and 355. This fact follows immediately from 
Theorems 7.6.1 and 8.2.2.
In Problems 1–20, use either Gaussian elimination or 
Gauss–Jordan elimination to solve the given system or show that 
no solution exists.

are called the row vectors of A and the column vectors of A, respectively.
 A Definition As vectors, the set u1, u2, . . . , um is either linearly independent or linearly 
dependent. We have the following definition.
Definition 8.3.1 
Rank of a Matrix
The rank of an m  n matrix A, denoted by rank(A), is the maximum number of linearly
independent row vectors in A.

SOLUTION With u1  (1  1  1  3), u2  (2  2  6  8), and u3  (3  5  7  8), we see 
that 4u1  1
2u2  u3  0. In view of Definition 7.6.3 and the discussion following it, we 
conclude that the set u1, u2, u3 is linearly dependent. On the other hand, since neither u1 nor 
u2 is a constant multiple of the other, the set of row vectors u1, u2 is linearly independent. 
Hence by Definition 8.3.1, rank(A)  2. 
 Row Space In the terminology of the preceding chapter, the row vectors u1, u2, u3 of the 
matrix (1) are a set of vectors in the vector space R4. Since RA  Span(u1, u2, u3) (the set of all 
linear combinations of the vectors u1, u2, u3) is a subspace of R4, we are justified in calling RA
the row space of the matrix A. Now the set of vectors u1, u2 is linearly independent and also 
spans RA; in other words, the set u1, u2 is a basis for RA. The dimension (the number of vectors 
in a basis) of the row space RA is 2, which is rank(A).
 Rank by Row Reduction Example 1 notwithstanding, it is generally not easy to 
determine the rank of a matrix by inspection. Although there are several mechanical ways 
of finding rank(A), we examine one way that uses the elementary row operations introduced 
in the preceding section. Specifically, the rank of A can be found by row reducing A to a
row-echelon matrix B. To understand this, first recall that an m  n  matrix B is row equiva-
lent to an m  n matrix A if the rows of B were obtained from the rows of A by applying 
elementary row operations. If we simply interchange two rows in A to obtain B, then the 
row space RA of A and the row space RB of B are equal because the row vectors of A and B
are the same. When the row vectors of B are linear combinations of the rows of A, it follows 
See page 352 in Section 7.6.

390
|
CHAPTER 8 Matrices
that the row vectors of B are in the row space RA, and so RB is a subset of RA (written RB 8 RA). 
Conversely, A is row equivalent to B, since we can obtain A by applying row operations to B. 
Hence the rows of A are  linear combinations of the rows of B, and so it follows that RA is 
a subset of RB (RA 8 RB). From RB 8 RA and RA 8 RB, we conclude that RA  RB. Finally, 
if we row-reduce A into a row-echelon matrix B, then the nonzero rows of B are linearly 
independent. (Why?) The nonzero rows of B form a basis for the row space RA, and so we 
have the result that rank(A)  dimension of RA.
We summarize these conclusions in the next theorem.
Theorem 8.3.1 
Rank of a Matrix by Row Reduction
If a matrix A is row equivalent to a row-echelon form B, then
(i) the row space of A  the row space of B,
(ii) the nonzero rows of B form a basis for the row space of A, and
(iii) rank(A)  the number of nonzero rows in B.
EXAMPLE 2 
Rank by Row Reduction—Example 1 Revisited
We row-reduce a matrix A to a row-echelon form B in exactly the same manner as we row-
reduced the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations to an echelon form when we 
solved the system using Gaussian elimination. Using the matrix (1) in Example 1, elementary 
row operations give

Since the last matrix is in row-echelon form, and since the last matrix has two nonzero rows, 
we conclude from (iii) of Theorem 8.3.1 that rank(A)  2. 
EXAMPLE 3 
Linear Independence/Dependence
Determine whether the set of vectors u1  2, 1, 1, u2  0, 3, 0, u3  3, 1, 2, in R3 is 
linearly dependent or linearly independent.
SOLUTION It should be clear from the discussion above that if we form a matrix A with 
the given vectors as rows, and if we row-reduce A to a row-echelon form B with rank 3, 
then the set of vectors is linearly independent. If rank(A)  3, then the set of vectors is 
linearly dependent. In this case, it is easy to carry the row reduction all the way to a reduced 
row-echelon form:

Thus rank(A)  3 and the set of vectors u1, u2, u3 is linearly independent. 
As mentioned previously, the vectors in the row-echelon form of a matrix A can serve as a 
basis for the row space of the matrix A. In Example 3, we see that a basis for the row space of A 
is the standard basis 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 of R3.
 Rank and Linear Systems The concept of rank can be related back to solvability of 
linear systems of algebraic equations. Suppose AX  B is a linear system and that (AB) denotes 
the augmented matrix of the system. In Example 7 of Section 8.2, we saw that the system

was inconsistent. The inconsistency of the system is seen in the fact that, after row reduction of 
the augmented matrix (AB),

the last row of the reduced row-echelon form is nonzero. Of course, this reduction shows that 
rank(AB)  3. But note, too, that the result in (2) indicates that rank(A)  2 because

We have illustrated a special case of the next theorem.
Theorem 8.3.2 
Consistency of AX  B
A linear system of equations AX  B is consistent if and only if the rank of the coefficient 
matrix A is the same as the rank of the augmented matrix of the system (AB).
In Example 6 of Section 8.2, we saw that the system
 
 x1  3x2  2x3  7
 
4x1   x2  3x3  5 
(3)
 
2x1  5x2  7x3  19
was consistent and had an infinite number of solutions. We solved for two of the variables, 
x1 and x2, in terms of the remaining variable x3, which we relabeled as a parameter t. The 
number of parameters in a solution of a system is related to the rank of the coefficient 
matrix A.
Theorem 8.3.3 
Number of Parameters in a Solution
Suppose a linear system AX  B with m equations and n variables is consistent. If 
the coefficient matrix A has rank r, then the solution of the system contains n  r 
parameters.
For the system (3), we can see from the row reduction

that rank(A)  rank(AB)  2, and so the system is consistent by Theorem 8.3.2. With n  3, 
we see from Theorem 8.3.3 the number of parameters in the solution is 3  2  1.

REMARKS
We have not mentioned the connection between the columns of a matrix A and the rank of A. 
It turns out that the maximum number of independent columns that a matrix A can have must 
equal the maximum number of independent rows. In the terminology of vector spaces, the 
row space RA of matrix A has the same dimension as its column space CA. For example, if we 
take the transpose of the matrix in (1) and reduce it to a row-echelon form:

we see that the maximum number of rows of AT is 2, and so the maximum number of linearly

A determinant of an n  n matrix is said to be a determinant of order n. We begin by defining 
the determinants of 1  1, 2  2, and 3  3 matrices.
 A Definition For a 1  1 matrix A  (a), we have det A  |a|  a. For example, if 
A  (5), then det A  |5|  5. In this case the vertical bars | | around a number do not mean 
the absolute value of the number.

As a mnemonic, a determinant of order 2 is thought to be the product of the main diagonal 
entries of A minus the product of the other diagonal entries:

 a11a23a32 2 a12a21a33.
 
(3)
The expression in (3) can be written in a more tractable form. By factoring, we have
 
det A  a11(a22a33  a23a32)  a12(a21a33  a23a31)  a13(a21a32  a22a31).
But in view of (1), each term in parentheses is recognized as the determinant of a 2  2 matrix:
 
 det  A  a112a22
a23
a32
a33
2  a12 a 2a21
a23
a31
a33
2 b  a13 2a21
a22
a31
a32
2 . 
(4)
Observe that each determinant in (4) is a determinant of a submatrix of the matrix A and corre-
sponds to its coefficient in the following manner: a11 is the coefficient of the determinant of the 
submatrix obtained by deleting the first row and first column of A; a12 is the coefficient of the 
negative of the determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting the first row and second column 
of A; and finally, a13 is the coefficient of the determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting 
the first row and third column of A. In other words, the coefficients in (4) are simply the entries 
of the first row of A. We say that det A has been expanded by cofactors along the first row, 
with the cofactors of a11, a12, and a13 being the determinants
 
C11  2a22
a23
a32

2  C12  2a21
a23
a31
a33
2  C13  2a21
a22
a31
a32
2 .

Thus (4) is
 
det A  a11C11  a12C12  a13C13. 
(5)
In general, the cofactor of aij is the determinant
Cij  (1)ijMij , 
(6)
where Mij is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting the ith row and the jth column 
of A. The determinant Mij is called a minor determinant. A cofactor is a signed minor determi-
nant; that is, Cij  Mij when i  j is even and Cij  Mij when i  j is odd.
A 3  3 matrix has nine cofactors:
 
C11  M11      C12  M12  C13  M13
 
C21  M21  C22  M22      C23  M23
 
C31  M31      C32  M32   C33  M33.
Inspection of the above array shows that the sign factor 1 or 1 associated with a cofactor can 
be obtained from the checkerboard pattern:
 
  
 
   
(7)
 
  
 
3  3 matrix
Now observe that (3) can be rearranged and factored again as
 
det A  a12(a21a33  a23a31)  a22(a11a33  a13a31)  a32(a11a23  a13a21)
 a12 a 2a21
a23
a31

a33
2  a32 a 2a11
a13
a21
a23
2 b 
(8)
 
 a12C12  a22C22  a32C32,
which is the cofactor expansion of det A along the second column. It is left as an exercise to show 
from (3) that det A can also be expanded by cofactors along the third row:
 
det A  a31C31  a32C32  a33C33. 
(9)
We are, of course, suggesting in (5), (8), and (9) the following general result:
The determinant of a 3  3 matrix can be evaluated by expanding det A by cofactors along 
any row or along any column.

If a matrix has a row (or a column) containing many zero entries, then wisdom dictates that 
we evaluate the determinant of the matrix using cofactor expansion along that row (or column). 
Thus, in Example 1, had we expanded the determinant of A using cofactors along, say, the second 
row, then
 
det A  6C21  0C22  3C23  6C21  3C23

 7[6(4)  5(2)]  238. 
Carrying the above ideas one step further, we can evaluate the determinant of a 4  4 matrix 
by multiplying the entries in a row (or column) by their corresponding cofactors and adding the 

products. In this case, each cofactor is a signed minor determinant of an appropriate 3  3 sub-
matrix. The following theorem, which we shall give without proof, states that the determinant of 
any n  n matrix A can be evaluated by means of cofactors.
Theorem 8.4.1 
Cofactor Expansion of a Determinant
Let A  (aij)nn be an n  n matrix. For each 1  i  n, the cofactor expansion of det A along 
the ith row is
 
det A  ai1Ci1  ai2Ci2  . . .  ainCin.
For each 1  j  n, the cofactor expansion of det A along the jth column is
 
det A  a1jC1j  a2jC2j  . . .  anjCnj.
The sign factor pattern for the cofactors illustrated in (7) extends to matrices of order greater 
than 3:

A word of caution is in order here. The memory device given in (11), though easily adapted 
to matrices larger than 3  3, does not give the correct results. There are no mnemonic devices 
for evaluating the determinants of order 4 or greater.

8.5 Properties of Determinants
INTRODUCTION 
In this section we are going to consider some of the many properties of 
determinants. Our goal in the discussion is to use these properties to develop a means of evaluat-
ing a determinant that is an alternative to cofactor expansion.
 Properties The first property states that the determinant of an n  n matrix and its trans-
pose are the same.
Theorem 8.5.1 
Determinant of a Transpose
If AT is the transpose of the n  n matrix A, then det AT  det A.
For example, for the matrix A  a5
7
3
4b, we have AT  a5
3
7
4b. Observe that
 
det A  25
7
3
42  41  and  det AT  25
3
7
42  41.
Since transposing a matrix interchanges its rows and columns, the significance of Theorem 8.5.1 
is that statements concerning determinants and the rows of a matrix also hold when the word row
is replaced by the word column.
Theorem 8.5.2 
Two Identical Rows
If any two rows (columns) of an n  n matrix A are the same, then det A  0.
EXAMPLE 1 
Matrix with Two Identical Rows
Since the second and third columns in the matrix A  °
6
2
2
4
2
2
9
2
2
¢  are the same, it follows 
from Theorem 8.5.2 that
 
det A  3
6
2
2
4
2
2
9
2
2
3   0.
You should verify this by expanding the determinant by cofactors.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
Theorem 8.5.3 
Zero Row or Column
If all the entries in a row (column) of an n  n matrix A are zero, then det A  0.
PROOF: Suppose the ith row of A consists of all zeros. Hence all the products in the expansion 
of det A by cofactors along the ith row are zero and consequently det A  0. 
For example, it follows immediately from Theorem 8.5.3 that
zero column T

Theorem 8.5.4 
Interchanging Rows
If B is the matrix obtained by interchanging any two rows (columns) of an n  n  matrix A, 
then det B  det A.
For example, if B is the matrix obtained by interchanging the first and third rows of 
A  °

You should verify this by computing both determinants.
Theorem 8.5.5 
Constant Multiple of a Row
If B is the matrix obtained from an n  n matrix A by multiplying a row (column) by a nonzero 
real number k, then det B  k det A.
PROOF: Suppose the entries in the ith row of A are multiplied by the number k. Call the result-
ing matrix B. Expanding det B by cofactors along the ith row then gives
 
det B  kai1Ci1  kai2Ci2  . . .  kainCin
 
 k(ai1Ci1  ai2Ci2  . . .  ainCin)  k det A.

Theorem 8.5.6 
Determinant of a Matrix Product
If A and B are both n  n matrices, then det AB  det A  det B.
In other words, the determinant of a product of two n  n matrices is the same as the product of 
the determinants.

det AB  24, det A  8, det B  3, and so we see that
 
det A  det B  (8)(3)  24  det AB. 
Theorem 8.5.7 
Determinant Is Unchanged
Suppose B is the matrix obtained from an n  n matrix A by multiplying the entries in a row 
(column) by a nonzero real number k and adding the result to the corresponding entries in 
another row (column). Then det B  det A.

 Row Reduction Evaluating the determinant of an n  n matrix by the method of cofac-
tor expansion requires a Herculean effort when the order of the matrix is large. To expand the 
determinant of, say, a 5  5 matrix with nonzero entries requires evaluating five cofactors that 
are determinants of 4  4 submatrices; each of these in turn requires four additional cofactors 
that are determinants of 3  3 submatrices, and so on. There is a more practical (and program-
mable) method for evaluating the determinant of a matrix. This method is based on reducing the 
matrix to a triangular form by row operations and the fact that determinants of triangular matri-
ces are easy to evaluate (see Theorem 8.5.8).

d Theorem 8.5.8 
Our final theorem concerns cofactors. We saw in Section 8.4 that a determinant det A of an 
n  n matrix A could be evaluated by cofactor expansion along any row (column). This means 
that the n entries aij of a row (column) are multiplied by the corresponding cofactors Cij and the 
n products are added. If, however, the entries aij of a row (aij of a column) of A are multiplied by 
the corresponding cofactors Ckj of a different row (Cik of a different column), the sum of the 
n products is zero.
Theorem 8.5.9 
A Property of Cofactors
Suppose A is an n  n matrix. If ai1, ai2, . . . , ain are the entries in the ith row and Ck1, Ck2, . . . , 
Ckn are the cofactors of the entries in the kth row, then
 
ai1Ck1  ai2Ck2  . . .  ainCkn  0 for i  k.
If a1j, a2j, . . . , anj are the entries in the jth column and C1k, C2k, . . ., Cnk are the cofactors of the 
entries in the kth column, then
 
a1jC1k  a2jC2k  . . .  anjCnk  0 for j  k.
PROOF: We shall prove the result for rows. Let B be the matrix obtained from A by letting the 
entries in the ith row of A be the same as the entries in the kth row—that is, 
ai1  ak1, ai2  ak2, . . ., ain  akn. Since B has two rows that are the same, it follows from Theorem 
8.5.2 that det B  0. Cofactor expansion along the kth row then gives the desired result:
 
0  det B  ak1Ck1  ak2Ck2  . . .  aknCkn
 
 ai1Ck1  ai2Ck2  . . .  ainCkn.

8.6 Inverse of a Matrix
INTRODUCTION 
The concept of the determinant of an n  n, or square, matrix will play an 
important role in this and the following section.
8.6.1 Finding the Inverse
In the real number system, if a is a nonzero number, then there exists a number b such that ab  
ba  1. The number b is called the multiplicative inverse of the number a and is denoted by a1. 
For a square matrix A it is also important to know whether we can find another square matrix B 
of the same order such that AB  BA  I. We have the following definition.
Definition 8.6.1 
Inverse of a Matrix
Let A be an n  n matrix. If there exists an n  n matrix B such that
 
AB  BA  I, 
(1)
where I is the n  n identity, then the matrix A is said to be nonsingular or invertible. The 
matrix B is said to be the inverse of A.
For example, the matrix A  a2
1
1
1b  is nonsingular or invertible since the matrix 
B  a
1
1
1
2b is its inverse. To verify this, observe that
 
 AB  a2

1b a

2b  a1

1b  I
and 
 BA  a

1
1
2b a2
1
1
1b  a1
0
0
1b  I.
Unlike the real number system, where every nonzero number a has a multiplicative inverse, 
not every nonzero n  n matrix A has an inverse.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
EXAMPLE 1 
Matrix with no Inverse
The matrix A  a1
1
0
0b has no multiplicative inverse. To see this suppose B  ab11
b12
b21
b22
b.
Then

0
0b ab11
b12
b21
b22
b  ab11  b21
b12  b22
0
0
b.
Inspection of the last matrix shows that it is impossible to obtain the 2  2 identity matrix I, 
because there is no way of selecting b11, b12, b21, and b22 to get 1 as the entry in the second row 
and second column. We conclude that the matrix A  a1
1
0
0b has no inverse.
An n  n matrix that has no inverse is called singular. If A is nonsingular, its inverse is 
denoted by B  A1.
Note that the symbol 1 in the notation A1 is not an exponent; in other words, A1 is not a 
reciprocal. Also, if A is nonsingular, its inverse is unique.
 Properties The following theorem lists some properties of the inverse of a matrix.
Theorem 8.6.1 
Properties of the Inverse
Let A and B be nonsingular matrices. Then
(i) (A1)1  A
(ii) (AB)1  B1A1
(iii) (AT)1  (A1)T
PROOF OF (i): This part of the theorem states that if A is nonsingular, then its inverse A1
is also nonsingular and its inverse is A. To prove that A1 is nonsingular, we have to show that 
a matrix B can be found such that A1B  BA1  I. But since A is assumed to be nonsingu-
lar, we know from (1) that AA1  A1A  I and, equivalently, A1A  AA1  I. The last 
matrix equation indicates that the required matrix, the inverse of A1, is B  A. Consequently, 
(A1)1  A. 
Theorem 8.6.1(ii) extends to any finite number of nonsingular matrices:
 
(A1A2 . . . Ak )1  Ak
1A1
 
k1 . . . A1
1;
that is, the inverse of a product of nonsingular matrices is the product of the inverses in reverse order.
In the discussion that follows we are going to consider two different ways of finding A1 for 
a nonsingular matrix A. The first method utilizes determinants, whereas the second employs the 
elementary row operations introduced in Section 8.2.
 Adjoint Method Recall from (6) of Section 8.4 that the cofactor Cij of the entry aij of an 
n  n matrix A is Cij  (1)ijMij, where Mij is the minor of aij; that is, the determinant of the 
(n  1)  (n  1) submatrix obtained by deleting the ith row and the jth column of A.
Definition 8.6.2 
Adjoint Matrix
Let A be an n  n matrix. The matrix that is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors corre-
sponding to the entries of A:

is called the adjoint of A and is denoted by adj A.
Important.

The next theorem will give a compact formula for the inverse of a nonsingular matrix in 
terms of the adjoint of the matrix. However, because of the determinants involved, this method 
becomes unwieldy for n  4.
Theorem 8.6.2 
Finding the Inverse
Let A be an n  n matrix. If det A  0, then
 
A1  a

since det A  ai1Ci1  ai2Ci2  ai3Ci3, for i  1, 2, 3, are the expansions of det A by cofactors

The reader is urged to verify that AA1  A1A  I. 

We are now in a position to prove a necessary and sufficient condition for an n  n
matrix A to have an inverse.
Theorem 8.6.3 
Nonsingular Matrices and det A
An n  n matrix A is nonsingular if and only if det A  0. 
PROOF: We shall first prove the sufficiency. Assume det A  0. Then A is nonsingular, since 
A1 can be found from Theorem 8.6.2.
To prove the necessity, we must assume that A is nonsingular and prove that det A  0. Now 
from Theorem 8.5.6, AA1  A1A  I implies
 
(det A)(det A1)  (det A1)(det A)  det I.
But since det I  1 (why?), the product (det A)(det A1)  1  0 shows that we must have 
det A  0. 
For emphasis we restate Theorem 8.6.3 in an alternative manner:
 
An n  n matrix A is singular if and only if det A  0. 
(6)
EXAMPLE 4 
Using (6)
The 2  2 matrix A  a2
2
3
3b  has no inverse; that is, A is singular, because 
det A  6  6  0. 
Because of the number of determinants that must be evaluated, the foregoing method for 
calculating the inverse of a matrix is tedious when the order of the matrix is large. In the case of 
3  3 or larger matrices, the next method is a particularly efficient means for finding A1.
 Row Operations Method Although it would take us beyond the scope of this book to 
prove it, we shall nonetheless use the following results:
Theorem 8.6.4 
Finding the Inverse
If an n  n matrix A can be transformed into the n  n identity I by a sequence of elementary 
row operations, then A is nonsingular. The same sequence of operations that transforms A 
into the identity I will also transform I into A1.
It is convenient to carry out these row operations on A and I simultaneously by means of an 
n  2n matrix obtained by augmenting A with the identity I as shown here:
 
(A|I)  ±

The procedure for finding A1 is outlined in the following diagram:
Perform row operations on
A until I is obtained. This
means A is nonsingular.
By simultaneously applying
the same row operations to
I we get A–1.

8.6.2 Using the Inverse to Solve Systems
A system of m linear equations in n variables x1, x2, . . ., xn,
 
a11x1  a12x2  . . .  a1nxn  b1
 
a21x1  a22x2  . . .  a2nxn  b2

 Special Case Let us suppose now that m  n in (7) so that the coefficient matrix A is 
n  n. In particular, if A is nonsingular, then the system AX  B can be solved by multiplying 
both of the equations by A1. From A1(AX)  A1B, we get (A1A)X  A1B. Since 
A1A  I and IX  X, we have
 
X  A1B.

Consequently, x1  19, x2  62, and x3  36. 
 Uniqueness When det A  0 the solution of the system AX  B is unique. Suppose 
not—that is, suppose det A  0 and X1 and X2 are two different solution vectors. Then AX1  B 
and AX2  B imply AX1  AX2. Since A is nonsingular, A1 exists, and so A1(AX1)  A1(AX2) 
and (A1A)X1  (A1A)X2. This gives IX1  IX2 or X1  X2, which contradicts our assumption 
that X1 and X2 were different solution vectors.
 Homogeneous Systems A homogeneous system of equations can be written AX  0. 
Recall that a homogeneous system always possesses the trivial solution X  0 and possibly an 
infinite number of solutions. In the next theorem we shall see that a homogeneous system of n 
equations in n variables possesses only the trivial solution when A is non singular.
Theorem 8.6.5 
Trivial Solution Only
A homogeneous system of n linear equations in n variables AX  0 has only the trivial 
 solution if and only if A is nonsingular.
PROOF: We prove the sufficiency part of the theorem. Suppose A is nonsingular. Then by (8), 
we have the unique solution X  A10  0. 
The next theorem will answer the question: When does a homogeneous system of n linear 
equations in n variables possess a nontrivial solution? Bear in mind that if a homogeneous system 
has one nontrivial solution, it must have an infinite number of solutions.
Theorem 8.6.6 
Existence of Nontrivial Solutions
A homogeneous system of n linear equations in n variables AX  0 has a nontrivial solution 
if and only if A is singular.
In view of Theorem 8.6.6, we can conclude that a homogeneous system of n linear equations 
in n variables AX  0 possesses
• only the trivial solution if and only if det A  0, and
• a nontrivial solution if and only if det A  0.
The last result will be put to use in Section 8.8.
REMARKS
(i) As a practical means of solving n linear equations in n variables, the use of an inverse 
matrix offers few advantages over the method of Section 8.2. However, in applications we 
sometimes need to solve a system AX  B several times; that is, we need to examine the 
solutions of the system corresponding to the same coefficient matrix A but different input 
vectors B. In this case, the single calculation of A1 enables us to obtain these solutions quickly 
through the matrix multiplication A1B.

(ii) In Definition 8.6.1 we saw that if A is an n  n matrix and if there exists another n  n 
matrix B that commutes with A such that
 
AB  I  and  BA  I, 
(9)
then B is the inverse of A. Although matrix multiplication is in general not commutative, the 
condition in (9) can be relaxed somewhat in this sense: If we find an n  n matrix B for which 
AB  I, then it can be proved that BA  I as well, and so B is the inverse of A. As a conse-
quence of this result, in the subsequent sections of this chapter if we wish to prove that a 
certain matrix B is the inverse of a given matrix A, it will suffice to show only that AB  I. 
We need not demonstrate that B commutes with A to give I.

matrix A.

INTRODUCTION 
We saw at the end of the preceding section that a system of n linear 
equations in n variables AX  B has precisely one solution when det A  0. This solution, as 
we shall now see, can be expressed in terms of determinants. For example, the system of two 
equations in two variables
 
a11x1  a12x2  b1
 
a21x1  a22x2  b2 
(1)
possesses the solution
 
x1  b1a22 2 a12b2
a11a22 2 a12a21 and x2  a11b2 2 b1a21
a11a22 2 a12a21
 
(2)
provided that a11a22  a12a21  0. The numerators and denominators in (2) are recognized as 
determinants. That is, the system (1) has the unique solution

Theorem 8.7.1 
Cramer’s Rule
Let A be the coefficient matrix of system (4). If det A  0, then the solution of (4) is given by
 
x1 

 det A , x2 
 det A2
 det A , p   , xn 
 det An
 det A , 
(6)
where Ak, k  1, 2, . . . , n, is defined in (5).
PROOF: We first write system (4) as AX  B. Since det A  0, A1 exists, and so
 X  A1B 

Now the entry in the kth row of the last matrix is
xk  b1C1k  b2C2k  p  bnCnk
 det A
. 
(7)
But b1C1k  b2C2k  . . .  bnCnk is the cofactor expansion of det Ak, where Ak is the matrix given 
in (5), along the kth column. Hence, we have xk  det Ak/det A for k  1, 2, . . . , n.

where N is the magnitude of the normal force exerted on the block

REMARKS
Like the method of the preceding section, Cramer’s rule is not a very practical means for 
solving systems of n linear equations in n variables. For n  4, the work required to evaluate 
the determinants becomes formidable. Nonetheless, as we saw in Section 3.5, Cramer’s rule 
is used sometimes, and it is of theoretical importance.
In the application of Cramer’s rule, some shortcuts can be taken. In Example 1, for instance, 
we really did not have to compute det A3 since once we found the values of x1 and x2, the value 
of x3 can be found by using one of the equations in the system.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
8.8 The Eigenvalue Problem
INTRODUCTION 
If A is an n  n matrix and K is an n  1 matrix (column vector), then 
the product AK is defined and is another n  1 matrix. It is important in many applications to 
determine whether there exist nonzero n  1 matrices K such that the product vector AK is a 
constant multiple l of K itself. The problem of solving AK  lK for nonzero vectors K is called 
the eigenvalue problem for the matrix A.
 A Definition The foregoing introductory remarks are summarized in the next definition.
Definition 8.8.1 
Eignvalues and Eigenvectors
Let A be an n  n matrix. A number l is said to be an eigenvalue of A if there exists a nonzero 
solution vector K of the linear system
 
AK  lK. 
(1)
The solution vector K is said to be an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue l.
The word eigenvalue is a combination of German and English terms adapted from the German 
word eigenwert, which, translated literally, is proper value. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are 
also called characteristic values and characteristic vectors,  respectively.
Gauss–Jordan elimination introduced in Section 8.2 can be used to find the eigenvectors of 
a square matrix A.

We see from the preceding line and Definition 8.8.1 that l  2 is an eigenvalue of A. 
Using properties of matrix algebra, we can write (1) in the alternative form
 
(A  lI)K  0, 
(2)
where I is the multiplicative identity. If we let

then (2) is the same as
 
(a11  l)k1             a12k2  . . .             a1nkn  0

(3)
 
an1k1             an2k2  . . .  (ann  l)kn  0.
Although an obvious solution of (3) is k1  0, k2  0, . . . , kn  0, we are seeking only nontrivial 
solutions. Now we know from Theorem 8.6.5 that a homogeneous system of n linear equations 
in n variables has a nontrivial solution if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is 
equal to zero. Thus to find a nonzero solution K for (2), we must have
 
det(A  lI)  0. 
(4)
Inspection of (4) shows that expansion of det(A  lI) by cofactors results in an nth-degree poly-
nomial in l. The equation (4) is called the characteristic equation of A. Thus, the eigenvalues
of A are the roots of the characteristic equation. To find an eigenvector corresponding to an 
 eigenvalue l, we simply solve the system of equations (A  lI)K  0 by applying GaussJordan 
elimination to the augmented matrix (A  lI 	 0).

Hence the eigenvalues are l1  0, l2  4, l3  3. To find the eigenvectors, we must now 
reduce (A  lI | 0) three times corresponding to the three distinct eigenvalues.

It should be obvious from Example 2 that eigenvectors are not uniquely determined. For

When an n  n matrix A possesses n distinct eigenvalues l1, l2, . . . , ln, it can be proved that 
a set of n linearly independent eigenvectors K1, K2, . . . , Kn can be found. However, when the 
characteristic equation has repeated roots, it may not be possible to find n linearly independent 
eigenvectors for A.

we see l1  l2  5 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2. In the case of a 2  2 matrix, there is 
no need to use Gauss–Jordan elimination. To find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to l1  5, 
we resort to the system (A  5I  0) in its equivalent form
 
2k1  4k2  0
 
k1  2k2  0.
It is apparent from this system that k1  2k2. Thus, if we choose k2  1, we find the single

 Complex Eigenvalues A matrix A may have complex eigenvalues.
Theorem 8.8.1 
Complex Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Let A be a square matrix with real entries. If l  a  ib, b  0, is a complex eigenvalue of A, 
then its conjugate l  a  ib is also an eigenvalue of A. If K is an eigenvector corresponding 
to l, then its conjugate K is an eigenvector corresponding to l.
PROOF: Since A is a matrix with real entries, the characteristic equation det(A  lI)  0 is a 
polynomial equation with real coefficients. From algebra we know that complex roots of such 
equations appear in conjugate pairs. In other words, if l  a  ib is a root, then l  a  ib
is also a root. Now let K be an eigenvector of A corresponding to l. By definition, AK  lK. 
Taking complex conjugates of the latter equation gives
A K  l K or AK  l K,
since A is a real matrix. The last equation indicates that K is an eigenvector corresponding 
to l.

 Eigenvalues and Singular Matrices If the number 0 is an eigenvalue of an n  n 
matrix A, then by Definition 8.8.1 the homogeneous linear system
 
AK  0K  0
of n equations in n variables must possess a nontrivial solution vector K. But this fact tells us 
something important about the matrix A. By Theorem 8.6.6 a homogeneous system of n equations 
in n variables possesses a nontrivial solution if and only if the coefficient matrix A is singular. 
We summarize this result in the following theorem.
Theorem 8.8.2 
Zero Eigenvalue and a Singular Matrix
Let A be an n  n matrix. Then the number l  0 is an eigenvalue of A if and only if A is 
singular.
Put a different way:
A matrix A is nonsingular if and only if the number 0 is not an eigenuvalue of A. 
(6)
Reexamination of Example 2 shows that l1  0 is an eigenvalue of the 3  3 matrix (5). So 
we can conclude from Theorem 8.8.2 that the matrix (5) is singular, that is, does not possess an 
inverse. On the other hand, we conclude from (6) that the matrices in Examples 3 and 4 are 
nonsingular because none of the eigenvalues of the matrices are 0.
The eigenvalues of an n  n matrix A are related to det A. Because the characteristic equation 
det(A  lI)  0 is an nth degree polynomial equation, it must, counting multiplicities and com-
plex numbers, have n roots l1, l2, l3, … ln. By the Factor Theorem of algebra, the characteristic 
polynomial det(A  lI) can then be written
 
det(A 2 lI)  (l1 2 l)(l2 2 l)(l3 2 l) p (ln 2 l). 
(7)
By setting 
  0 in (7) we see that
 
det A  l1l2l3 p ln, 
(8)
that is:
The determinant of A is the product of its eigenvalues.
The result in (8) provides an alternative proof of Theorem 8.8.2: If, say, l1  0 then det A  0. 
Conversely, if det A  0, then l1l2l3 p ln  0 implies that at least one of the eigenvalues of A is 0.
*Note that the second equation is simply 1  2i times the first.

 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of A1 If an n  n matrix A is nonsingular, then 
A1 exists and we now know that none of the eigenvalues of A are 0. Suppose that l is an eigen-
value of A with corresponding eigenvector K. By multiplying both sides of the equation AK  lK 
by A1, we get
 
A1 (AK)  lA1K
 
(A1 A)K  lA1K
 
IK  lA1K
or 
A1K  1

(9)
Comparing the result in (9) with (1) leads us to the following conclusion.
Theorem 8.8.3 
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of A1
Let A be a nonsingular matrix. If l is an eigenvalue of A with corresponding eigenvector K, 
then 1/l is an eigenvalue of A1 with the same corresponding eigenvector K.

Our last theorem follows immediately from the fact that the determinant of an upper trian-
gular, lower triangular, and a diagonal matrix is the product of the main diagonal entries. See 
Theorem 8.5.8.

Triangular and Diagonal Matrices
The eigenvalues of an upper triangular, lower triangular, and diagonal matrix are the main 
diagonal entries.

8.9 Powers of Matrices
INTRODUCTION 
It is sometimes important to be able to quickly compute a power Am, m a 
positive integer, of an n  n matrix A:
 
Am  AAA p A.
 
 
m factors
Of course, computation of Am could be done with the appropriate software or by writing a short 
computer program, but even then, you should be aware that it is inefficient to simply use brute 
force to carry out repeated multiplications: A2  AA, A3  AA2, A4  AAAA  A(A3)  A2A2, 
and so on.
 Computation of Am We are going to sketch an alternative method for computing Am by 
means of the following theorem known as the Cayley–Hamilton theorem.
Theorem 8.9.1 
Cayley–Hamilton Theorem
An n  n matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation.
If (1)nln  cn1ln1  . . .  c1l  c0  0 is the characteristic equation of A, then Theorem 8.9.1 
states that by replacing l by A we have
 
(1)nAn  cn1An1  . . .  c1A  c0I  0. 
(1)

 Matrices of Order 2 The characteristic equation of the 2  2 matrix A  a2
4
1
3b 
is l2  l  2  0, and the eigenvalues of A are l1  1 and l2  2. Theorem 8.9.1 implies 
A2  A  2I  0, or, solving for the highest power of A,
 
A2  2I  A. 
(2)
Now if we multiply (2) by A, we get A3  2A  A2, and if we use (2) again to eliminate A2 on 
the right side of this new equation, then
 
A3  2A  A2  2A  (2I  A)  2I  3A.
Continuing in this manner—in other words, multiplying the last result by A and using (2) to eliminate 
A2—we obtain in succession powers of A expressed solely in terms of the identity matrix I and A:
 
A4  6I  5A
 
A5  10I  11A 
(3)
 
A6  22I  21A
and so on (verify). Thus, for example,
 
A6  22 a1
0
0
1b  21 a2
4
1
3b  a20
84
21
85b  . 
(4)
Now we can determine the ck without actually carrying out the repeated multiplications and 
resubstitutions as we did in (3). First, note that since the characteristic equation of the matrix 
A  a2
4
1
3b can be written l2  2  l, results analogous to (3) must also hold for the eigen-
values l1  1 and l2  2; that is, l3  2  3l, l4  6  5l, l5  10  11l, l6  22  21l, . . . . 
It follows then that the equations
 
Am  c0I  c1A  and  lm  c0  c1l 
(5)
hold for the same pair of constants c0 and c1. We can determine the constants c0 and c1 by simply 
setting l  1 and l  2 in the last equation in (5) and solving the resulting system of two 
equations in two unknowns. The solution of the system
 
(1)m  c0  c1(1)
 
2m  c0  c1(2)
is c0  1
3[2m  2(1)m], c1  1
3[2m  (1)m]. Now by substituting these coefficients in the first 
equation in (5), adding the two matrices and simplifying each entry, we obtain
 
Am  a

3f2m  4(1)mg
4
3f2m 2 (1)mg
1
3f2m 2 (1)mg
1
3f2m2 2 (1)mgb  . 
(6)
You should verify the result in (4) by setting m  6 in (6). Note that (5) and (6) are valid for 
m  0 since A0  I and A1  A.
 Matrices of Order n If the matrix A were 3  3, then the characteristic equation (1) is 
a cubic polynomial equation, and the analogue of (2) would enable us to express A3 in terms of

I, A, and A2. We could proceed as just illustrated to write any power Am in terms of I, A, and A2. 
In general, for an n  n matrix A, we can write
 
Am  c0I  c1A  c2A2  . . .  cn1An1,
and where each of the coefficients ck, k  0, 1, . . . , n  1, depends on the value of m.

SOLUTION The characteristic equation of A is l3  2l2  l  2  0 or l3  2  l  2l2, 
and the eigenvalues are l1  1, l2  1, and l3  2. From the preceding discussion we know 
that the same coefficients hold in both of the following equations:
 
Am  c0I  c1A  c2A2  and  lm  c0  c1l  c2l2. 
(7)
Setting, in turn, l  1, l  1, l  2 in the last equation generates three equations in three 
unknowns:
 
(1)m  c0    c1    c2
 
1  c0    c1    c2

After computing A2, we substitute these coefficients into the first equation of (7) and simplify

REMARKS
There are some obvious problems with the method just illustrated for finding Am. If, for ex-
ample, the matrix in Example 1 had an eigenvalue of multiplicity two, then instead of three 
equations and three unknowns as in (8) we would have only two equations in three unknowns. 
How do we then find unique coefficients c0, c1, and c2? See Problems 11–14 in Exercises 8.9. 
Also, for larger matrices, even with distinct eigenvalues, solving a large system of equations 
for c0, c1, c2, . . . , cn1 is far too tedious to do by hand.
In Problems 1 and 2, verify that the given matrix satisfies its 
own characteristic equation.

 eigenvalue l1 of multiplicity two. As a consequence, the 
equations lm  c0  c1l (Problem 11) and lm  c0  c1l  c2l2 
(Problem 12) do not yield enough independent equations to 
form a system for determining the coefficients ci. Use the

 How many pairs of rabbits will be produced in a year begin-
ning with a single pair, if every month each pair bears a new 
pair which become productive from the second month on?

Orthogonal Matrices
INTRODUCTION 
In this section we are going to use some elementary properties of complex 
numbers. Suppose z  a  ib denotes a complex number, where a and b are real and the symbol i 
is defined by i2  1. If z  a  ib is the conjugate of z, then the equality z  z or 
a  ib  a  ib implies that b  0. In other words, if z  z, then z is a real number. In addition, 
it is easily verified that the product of a complex number z and its conjugate z is a real number: 
zz  a2  b2. The magnitude of z is defined to be the real number |z|  "a2  b2. The mag-
nitude of z can be expressed in terms of the product zz: |z|  "a2  b2  |zz|, or |z|2  zz. A 
detailed discussion of complex numbers can be found in Section 17.1.
There are many types of special matrices, but two types occur again and again in applications: 
symmetric matrices (page 373) and orthogonal matrices (page 413). In this section we are going 
to examine both these matrices in further detail.
 Symmetric Matrices We begin by recalling, in formal terms, the definition of a sym-
metric matrix.
Definition 8.10.1 
Symmetric Matrix
An n  n matrix A is symmetric if A  AT, where AT is the transpose of A.
The proof of the next theorem depends on the properties of complex numbers discussed in 
the review at the start of this section.
Theorem 8.10.1 
Real Eigenvalues
Let A be a symmeric matrix with real entries. Then the eigenvalues of A are real.

PROOF: If K is an eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue l of A, then AK  lK. The 
conjugate of the last equation is
 
AK  lK. 
(1)
Since the entries of A are real, we have A  A, and so (1) is
 
AK  lK. 
(2)
We now take the transpose of (2), use the fact that A is symmetric, and multiply the resulting 
equation on the right by K:
 
KTAK  lKTK. 
(3)
But if we multiply AK  lK on the left by KT, we obtain
 
KTAK  lKTK. 
(4)
Subtracting (4) from (3) then gives
 
0  (l  l)KTK. 
(5)
Now KT is a 1  n matrix and K is an n  1 matrix, so the product KTK is the 1  1 matrix 
KTK  (|k1|2  |k2|2  . . .  |kn|2). Since by definition, K  0, the last expression is a positive 
quantity. Therefore we conclude from (5) that l  l  0 or l  l. This implies that l is a real 
number. 
 Inner Product In Rn the inner product or dot of two vectors x  (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and 
y  (y1, y2, . . . , yn) is given by
 
x  y  x1y1  x2 y2  . . .  xn yn. 
(6)
Now if X and Y are n  1 column vectors, X  ±
x1
x2
(
xn
≤ and Y  ±
y1
y2
(
yn
≤, then the matrix analogue 
of (6) is
 
X  Y  XTY  (x1y1  x2 y2  . . .  xnyn).* 
(7)
Of course, for the column vectors given, YTX  XTY. The norm of a column vector X is given by
 
iXi  "X  X  "XTX  "x2
1  x2
2  p  x2
n.
Theorem 8.10.2 
Orthogonal Eigenvectors
Let A be an n  n symmetric matrix. Then eigenvectors corresponding to distinct (different) 
eigenvalues are orthogonal.
*Since a 1  1 matrix is simply a scalar, we will hereafter drop the parentheses and write 
XTY  x1 y1  x2 y2  . . .  xnyn.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
PROOF: Let l1 and l2 be two distinct eigenvalues of A corresponding to the eigenvectors K1
and K2, respectively. We wish to show that K1  K2  K1
TK2  0.
Now by definition we must have
 
AK1  l1K1  and  AK2  l2K2. 
(8)
We form the transpose of the first of these equations, use AT  A, and then multiply the result 
on the right by K2:
 
K1
 TAK2  l1K1
 TK2. 
(9)
The second equation in (8) is multiplied on the left by K1
 T:
 
K1
 TAK2  l2K1
 TK2. 
(10)
Subtracting (10) from (9) yields
 
0  l1K1
 TK2  l2K1
 TK2  or  0  (l1  l2)K1
 TK2.
Since l1  l2, it follows that K1
T K2  0.

We saw in Example 3 of Section 8.8 that it may not be possible to find n linearly independent 
eigenvectors for an n  n matrix A when some of the eigenvalues are repeated. But a symmetric 
matrix is an exception. It can be proved that a set of n linearly independent eigenvectors can 
always be found for an n  n symmetric matrix A even when there is some repetition of the 
 eigenvalues. (See Example 4 of Section 8.8.)

A set of vectors x1, x2, . . . , xn in R n is called orthonormal if every pair of distinct vectors is 
orthogonal and each vector in the set is a unit vector. In terms of the inner product of vectors, the 
set is orthonormal if
 
xi  xj  0,  i  j,  i, j  1, 2, . . . , n  and  xi  xi  1,  i  1, 2, . . . , n.
The last condition simply states that ixii  "xi xi  1, i  1, 2, . . . , n.
 Orthogonal Matrix The concept of an orthonormal set of vectors plays an important 
role in the consideration of the next type of matrix.
Definition 8.10.2 
Orthogonal Matrix
An n  n nonsingular matrix A is orthogonal if A1  AT.
In other words, A is orthogonal if ATA  I.

X2, . . . , Xn. Hence, the rows of AT are X1

It follows from the definition of equality of matrices that
 
Xi
 T Xj  0,  i  j,  i, j  1, 2, . . . , n  and  Xi
 T Xi  1,  i  1, 2, . . . , n.
This means that the columns of the orthogonal matrix form an orthonormal set of n vectors. 
If we write the columns of the matrix in part (b) of Example 2 as

 Constructing an Orthogonal Matrix If an n  n real symmetric matrix A possesses 
n distinct eigenvalues l1, l2, . . . , ln, it follows from Theorem 8.10.2 that the corresponding 
eigenvectors K1, K2, . . . , Kn are mutually orthogonal. By multiplying each vector by the recipro-
cal of its norm, we obtain a set of mutually orthogonal unit vectors—that is, an orthonormal set. 
We can then construct an orthogonal matrix by forming an n  n matrix P whose columns are 
these normalized eigenvectors of A.

We will use the technique of constructing an orthogonal matrix from the eigenvectors of a 
symmetric matrix in the next section.
Do not misinterpret Theorem 8.10.2. We can always find n linearly independent eigenvectors 
for an n  n real symmetric matrix A. However, the theorem does not state that all the eigenvec-
tors are mutually orthogonal. The set of eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are 
orthogonal, but the different eigenvectors corresponding to a repeated eigenvalue may not be 
orthogonal. Consider the symmetric matrix in the next example.

Observe, in accordance with Theorem 8.10.2, the vector K3 is orthogonal to K1 and to 
K2, but K1 and K2, eigenvectors corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue l1  9, are not 
orthogonal since K1  K2  4  0.
We use the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process (see pages 359–360) to transform

For a real n  n symmetric matrix with repeated eigenvalues it is always possible to find, 
rather than construct, a set of n mutually orthogonal eigenvectors. In other words, the Gram–

In Problems 1– 4, (a) verify that the indicated column vectors are 
eigenvectors of the given symmetric matrix, (b) identify the 
corresponding eigenvalues, and (c) verify that the column 
vectors are orthogonal.

Approximation of Eigenvalues
INTRODUCTION 
Recall, to find the eigenvalues for a matrix A we must find the roots of the 
polynomial equation p(l)  det(A  lI)  0. If A is a large matrix, the computations involved 
in obtaining this characteristic equation can be overwhelming. Moreover, even if we can find the 
exact characteristic equation it is likely that we would have to use a numerical procedure to ap-
proximate its roots. There are alternative numerical procedures for approximating eigenvalues 
and the corresponding eigenvectors. The procedure that we shall consider in this section deals 
with matrices that possess a dominant eigenvalue.
 A Definition A dominant eigenvalue of a square matrix A is one whose absolute value 
is greater than the absolute value of each of the remaining eigenvalues. We formalize the last 
sentence in the next definition.

Definition 8.11.1 
Dominant Eigenvalue
Let l1, l2, . . . , lk, . . . , ln denote the eigenvalues of an n  n matrix A. The eigen value lk is 
said to be the dominant eigenvalue of A if
 
|lk|  li,  i  1, 2, . . . , n,   but i  k.
An eigenvector corresponding to lk is called the dominant eigenvector of A.
In Example 2 of Section 8.8, we saw that the eigenvalues of the matrix
A  °

¢
are l1  0, l2  4, and l3  3. Since |4|  0 and |4|  3, we see that l2  4 is the 
dominant eigenvalue of A.
EXAMPLE 1 
Matrices with No Dominant Eigenvalue
(a) The matrix A  a2

2b has eigenvalues l1  2 and l2  2. Since |l1|  |l2|  2, 
it follows that there is no dominant eigenvalue.
(b) The eigenvalues of the matrix

are l1  2, l2  l3  5. Again, the matrix has no dominant eigenvalue. 
 Power Method Suppose the n  n matrix A has a dominant eigenvalue l1. The it-
erative technique for approximating a corresponding dominant eigenvector is due to the German 
mathematician Richard von Mises (1883–1953) and is called the power method. The basic idea 
of this procedure is first to compute an approximation to a dominant eigenvector by means of 
the sequence
 
Xi  AXi1,  i  1, 2, 3, . . . , 
(1)
where X0 represents a nonzero n  1 vector that is an initial guess or approximation for the 
 eigenvector we seek. Iterating (1) gives
 
X1  AX0
 
X2  AX1  A2X0
 
o 
(2)
 
Xm  AXm1  AmX0.
Under certain circumstances, for large values of m the vector defined by Xm  AmX0 is an 
approximation to a dominant eigenvector. To see this, let us make some further assumptions about 
the matrix A. Let us assume that the eigenvalues of A are such that
 
|l1|  |l2|  |l3|  . . .   |ln|

and that the corresponding n eigenvectors K1, K2, . . . , Kn are linearly independent. Because of 
this last assumption, K1, K2, . . . , Kn can serve as a basis for Rn (see Section 7.6). Thus, for any 
nonzero n  1 vector X0, constants c1, c2, . . . , cn can be found such that
 
X0  c1K1  c2K2  . . .   cnKn. 
(3)
We shall also assume X0 is chosen so that c1  0. Multiplying (3) by A then gives
 
AX0  c1AK1  c2AK2  . . .   cnAKn.
Since AK1  l1K1, AK2  l2K2, . . . , AKn  lnKn, the last line becomes
 
AX0  c1l1K1  c2l2K2  . . .   cnlnAKn. 
(4)
Multiplying (4) by A gives
 
A2X0  c1l1AK1  c2l2AK2  . . .   cnlnAKn
 c1l1
 2K1  c2l2
 2K2  . . .  cnln
 2Kn.
Continuing in this manner, we find that
 
AmX0  c1l1
 mK1  c2l2
 mK2  . . .   cnln
 mKn 
(5)
 
 lm
1  ac1K1  c2 al2

K2  p  cn aln

(6)
Since |l1|  |li| for i  2, 3, . . . , n, we have |li /l1|  1 and consequently limmS(li /l1)m  0. 
Therefore, as m S , we see from (6) that
 
AmX0  l1
 mc1K1. 
(7)
Since a nonzero constant multiple of an eigenvector is an eigenvector, it follows from (7) that 
for large values of m and under all the assumptions that were made, the n  1 matrix Xm  
AmX0 is an approximation to a dominant eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue 
l1. The rate at which this method converges depends on the quotient l2/l1: If |l2/l1| is very 
small, then convergence is fast, whereas if |l2/l1| is close to one, convergence is slow. Of course, 
this information is not as useful as it seems because we generally do not know the eigenvalues 
in advance.
It remains, then, to approximate the dominant eigenvalue itself. This can be done by means 
of the inner product. If K is an eigenvector of a matrix A corresponding to the eigenvalue l, we 
have AK  lK, and so we have AK  K  lK  K. Since AK  K and K  K are scalars, we can 
solve this last equation for l:
 
l  AK  K
K  K .
Hence, if Xm  AmX0 is an approximation to a dominant eigenvector obtained by the iteration 
of (1), then the dominant eigenvalue l1 can be approximated by the quotient
 
l1 < AXm Xm
Xm Xm
 . 
(8)
The quotient in (8) is sometimes referred to as the Rayleigh quotient.

SOLUTION Since we do not know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we may as well take 
X0  a1

364b a3576
1772b a17,848
8956 b a89,304
44,588b
At this point it may not appear that we are getting anywhere, since the entries of the vectors 
in the table appear to be growing without bound. But bear in mind that (7) indicates we are 
obtaining a constant multiple of a vector. If the power method converges, then by factoring 
the entry with the largest absolute value from Xm (for a large value of m), we should obtain a 
reasonable approximation to a dominant eigenvector. From the table,
 
X7  89,304 a
1
0.4933b  . 
(9)
It appears then that the vectors are approaching scalar multiples of a 1
0.5b.
We now use (8) to approximate the dominant eigenvalue l1. First we have

Finally, we have
 
l1  AX7  X7
X7  X7
 6.2472
1.2493  5.0006.
The reader should use the procedure of Section 8.7 to verify that the eigenvalues and corre-
sponding eigenvectors of A are l1  5, l2  2, K1  a 1
0.5b, and K2  a
1
3b  . 
 Scaling As we have just seen, iteration of (1) often results in vectors whose entries become 
very large in absolute value. Large numbers can, of course, cause a problem if a computer is 
used to carry out a great number of iterations. The result in (9) suggests that one way around 
this difficulty is to use a scaled-down vector at each step of the iteration. To do this, we simply 
multiply the vector AX0 by the reciprocal of the entry with the largest absolute value. That is, 
we multiply
 
AX0  °
x1
(
xn
¢ by 
1
max5Zx1Z, Zx2Z, p  , ZxnZ6
 .
This resulting matrix, whose entries are now less than or equal to one, we label X1. We repeat 
the process with the vector AX1 to obtain the scaled-down vector X2, and so on.

In contrast to the table in Example 2, it is apparent from this table that the vectors are 
approaching a 1
0.5b. 
 Method of Deflation After we have found the dominant eigenvalue l1 of a matrix A it 
may still be necessary to find nondominant eigenvalues. The procedure we shall consider next 
is a modification of the power method and is called the method of deflation. We will limit the 
discussion to the case where A is a symmetric matrix.
Suppose l1 and K1 are, respectively, the dominant eigenvalue and a corresponding normalized
eigenvector* (that is, ||K1||  1) of a symmetric matrix A. Furthermore, suppose the eigenvalues 
of A are such that
 
|l1|  |l2|  |l3|  . . .   |ln|.
It can be proved that the matrix
 
B  A  l1K1K1
 T 
(10)
has eigenvalues 0, l2, l3, . . . , ln and that eigenvectors of B are also eigenvectors of A. Note that 
l2 is now the dominant eigenvalue of B. We apply the power method to B to approximate l2 and 
a corresponding eigenvector.

Example 4 is somewhat artificial since eigenvalues of a matrix need not be “nice” numbers 
such as 3, 2, and 1. Moreover, we used the exact values of the dominant eigenvalues l1 and l2 
in the formation of the matrices B and C. In practice, of course, we may have to be content with 
working with approximations to the dominant eigenvalue l1 and a corresponding normalized 
dominant eigenvector K1 of A. If these approximations are used in (10), an error is introduced 
in the computation of the matrix B, and so more errors may be introduced in the computation of 
its dominant eigenvalue l2 and dominant eigenvector K2. If l2 and K2 are now used to con-
struct the matrix C, it seems reasonable to conclude that errors are being compounded. In 
other words, the method of deflation can become increasingly inaccurate as more eigenvalues 
are computed.
 Inverse Power Method In some applied problems we are more interested in approxi-
mating the eigenvalue of a matrix A of smallest absolute value than the dominant eigenvalue. If 
A is nonsingular, then the eigenvalues of A are nonzero, and if l1, l2, . . . , ln are the eigenvalues 
of A, then 1/l1, 1/l2, . . . , 1/ln are the eigenvalues of A1. Now if the eigenvalues of A can be 
arranged in the order
 
|l1|  |l2|  |l3|  . . .   |ln1|  |ln|,
then we see that 1/ln is the dominant eigenvalue of A1. By applying the power method to A1, 
we approximate the eigenvalue of largest magnitude and, by taking its reciprocal, we find the 
eigenvalue of A of least magnitude. This is called the inverse power method. See Problems 
11–13 in Exercises 8.11.

Diagonalization
INTRODUCTION 
In Chapter 10 we shall see that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, orthogonal matri-
ces, and the topic of this present section, diagonalization, are important tools in the solution of 
systems of linear first-order differential equations. The basic question that we shall consider in this 
section is
For an n  n matrix A, can we find an n  n nonsingular matrix P such that P1AP  D 
is a diagonal matrix?
 A Special Notation We begin by introducing a shorthand notation for the product of 
two n  n matrices. This notation will be useful in proving the principal theorem of this section. 
To illustrate, suppose A and B are 2  2 matrices. Then
 
AB  aa11

a21b11  a22b21
a21b12  a22b22
b  .

column 1 
column 2

If we write the columns of the matrix B as vectors X1  ab11
b21
b and X2  ab12
b22
b, then column 1 
and column 2 in the product (1) can be expressed as the products AX1 and AX2. That is,
 
AB  (AX1  AX2).
 
column 1 column 2
In general, for two n  n matrices
 
AB  A(X1 X2 . . .  Xn)  (AX1 AX2 . . .  AXn), 
(2)
where X1, X2, . . . , Xn, are the columns of B.
 Diagonalizable Matrix If an n  n nonsingular matrix P can be found so that P1AP  D 
is a diagonal matrix, then we say that the n  n matrix A can be diagonalized, or is diagonaliz-
able, and that P diagonalizes A.
To discover how to diagonalize a matrix, let us assume for the sake of discussion that A is a 
3  3 diagonalizable matrix. Then there exists a 3  3 nonsingular matrix P such that P1AP  D 
or AP  PD, where D is a diagonal matrix
 
D  °
d11
0
0
0
d22
0
0
0
d33
¢.
If P1, P2, and P3 denote the columns of P, then it follows from (2) that the equation AP  PD is 
the same as
 
(AP1 AP2 AP3)  (d11P1 d22P2 d33P3)
or 
AP1  d11P1,  AP2  d22P2,  AP3  d33P3.
But by Definition 8.8.1 we see that d11, d22, and d33 are eigenvalues of A associated with the 
 eigenvectors P1, P2, and P3. These eigenvectors are linearly independent, since P was assumed 
to be nonsingular.
We have just discovered, in a particular case, that if A is diagonalizable, then the columns of 
the diagonalizing matrix P consist of linearly independent eigenvectors of A. Since we wish to 
diagonalize a matrix, we are really concerned with the validity of the converse of the last sentence. 
In other words, if we can find n linearly independent eigenvectors of an n  n matrix A and form 
an n  n matrix P whose columns consist of these eigenvectors, then does P diagonalize A? The 
answer is yes and will be proved in the next theorem.
Theorem 8.12.1 
Sufficient Condition for Diagonalizability
If an n  n matrix A has n linearly independent eigenvectors K1, K2, . . . , Kn, then A is 
 diagonalizable.
PROOF: We shall prove the theorem in the case when A is a 3  3 matrix. Let K1, K2, and K3 
be linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues l1, l2, and l3; that is,
 
AK1  l1K1,  AK2  l2K2,  and  AK3  l3K3. 
(3)
Next form the 3  3 matrix P with column vectors K1, K2, and K3: P  (K1 K2 K3). P is non-
singular since, by hypothesis, the eigenvectors are linearly independent. Now using (2) and (3)

we can write the product AP as

¢   PD.
Multiplying the last equation on the left by P1 then gives P1AP  D. 
Note carefully in the proof of Theorem 8.12.1 that the entries in the diagonalized matrix are the 
eigenvalues of A and the order in which these numbers appear on the diagonal of D corresponds 
to the order in which the eigenvectors are used as columns in the matrix P.
In view of the motivational discussion preceding Theorem 8.12.1, we can state the general 
result:
Theorem 8.12.2 
Criterion for Diagonalizability
An n  n matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if A has n linearly independent eigenvectors.
We saw in Section 8.8 that an n  n matrix A has n linearly independent eigenvectors whenever 
it possesses n distinct eigenvalues.
Theorem 8.12.3 
Sufficient Condition for Diagonalizability
If an n  n matrix A has n distinct eigenvalues, it is diagonalizable.
EXAMPLE 1 
Diagonalizing a Matrix
Diagonalize A  a5

SOLUTION First we find the eigenvalues of A. The characteristic equation is det(A  lI) 
25 2 l
9
6
10 2 l 2  l2  5l  4  (l  1)(l  4)  0. The eigenvalues are l1  1 
and l2  4. Since the eigenvalues are distinct, we know from Theorem 8.12.3 that A is 
diagonalizable.
Next the eigenvectors of A corresponding to l1  1 and l2  4 are, respectively,
 
K1  a3
2b and K2  a1
1b.
Using these vectors as columns, we find that the nonsingular matrix P that diagonalizes A is
 
P  (K1 K2)  a3
1
2
1b.
Now 
P1  a

and so carrying out the multiplication gives

matrix would have been D  a4

The condition that an n  n matrix A have n distinct eigenvalues is sufficient—that is, a 
guarantee—that A is diagonalizable. The condition that there be n distinct eigenvalues is not a 
necessary condition for the diagonalization of A. In other words, if the matrix A does not have 
n distinct eigenvalues, then it may or may not be diagonalizable.
EXAMPLE 3 
A Matrix That Is Not Diagonalizable
In Example 3 of Section 8.8 we saw that the matrix A  a

l1  l2  5. Correspondingly we were able to find only a single eigenvector K1  a2

conclude from Theorem 8.12.2 that A is not diagonalizable.

From the last matrix we see that k1  k2  0. Since k3 is not determined from the last matrix,

get the eigenvector

 Symmetric Matrices An n  n symmetric matrix A with real entries can always be 
diagonalized. This is a consequence of the fact that we can always find n linearly independent 
eigenvectors for such a matrix. Moreover, since we can find n mutually orthogonal eigenvectors, 
we can use an orthogonal matrix P to diagonalize A. A symmetric matrix is said to be orthogo-
nally diagonalizable.
Theorem 8.12.4 
Criterion for Orthogonal Diagonalizability
An n  n matrix A can be orthogonally diagonalized if and only if A is symmetric.
PARTIAL PROOF: We shall prove the necessity part (that is, the “only if ” part) of the theorem. 
Assume an n  n matrix A is orthogonally diagonalizable. Then there exists an orthogonal ma-
trix P such that P1AP  D or A  PDP1. Since P is orthogonal, P1  PT and consequently 
A  PDPT. But from (i) and (iii) of Theorem 8.1.2 and the fact that a diagonal matrix is sym-
metric, we have
 
AT  (PDPT)T  (PT)TDTPT  PDPT  A.
Thus, A is symmetric.

The eigenvectors K1, K2, and K3 are linearly independent, but note that they are not mutually

which implies that k1  k2  k3  0. Since two of the variables are arbitrary, we selected 
k2  1, k3  0 to obtain K2, and k2  0, k3  1 to obtain K3. Now if instead we choose k2  1, 
k3  1 and then k2  1, k3  1, we obtain, respectively, two entirely different but orthogo-

 Quadratic Forms An algebraic expression of the form

In calculus you may have seen that an appropriate rotation of axes enables us to eliminate the 
xy-term in an equation
 
ax2  bxy  cy2  dx  ey  f  0.
As the next example will illustrate, we can eliminate the xy-term by means of an orthogonal 
matrix and diagonalization rather than by using trigonometry.

Since P orthogonally diagonalizes the symmetric matrix A, the last equation is the same as

respectively. From this we conclude that the X-axis and Y-axis are as shown in FIGURE 8.12.1. 
The eigenvectors, shown in red in the figure, lie along the new axes. The X- and Y-axes are 
called the principal axes of the conic.

REMARKS
The matrix A in Example 5 is symmetric and as such eigenvectors corresponding to distinct 
eigenvalues are orthogonal. In the third line of the example, note that K1, an eigenvector for 
l1  11, is orthogonal to both K2 and K3. The eigenvectors K2  °

¢  and K3  °

¢  
corresponding to l2  l3  8 are not orthogonal. As an alternative to searching for orthogo-
nal eigenvectors for this repeated eigenvalue by performing Gauss–Jordan elimination a sec-
ond time, we could simply apply the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process and transform 
the set {K2, K3} into an orthogonal set. See Section 7.7 and Example 4 in Section 8.10.

LU-Factorization
INTRODUCTION 
Just as positive integers and polynomials can be factored, so too a matrix 
can sometimes be factored into other matrices. For example, in the last section we saw that if an 
n  n matrix A is diagonalizable, then there exists a nonsingular matrix P and a diagonal matrix 
D such that P1AP  D. When the last equation is written as A  PDP1 we say that A has 
been factored or decomposed into three matrices. There are many ways of factoring an n  n 
matrix A, but in this section we are interested in a special type of factorization that involves 
triangular matrices.
The notion of a triangular matrix 
was introduced in Section 8.1. 
See page 372.

lower triangular matrix 
upper triangular matrix
Lower and upper triangular matrices are very important in a variety of computational applica-
tions, but in this section we will confine our attention to their use in solving linear systems 
AX  B. We will denote a lower triangle matrix by the letter L and an upper triangular matrix 
by U. This leads to the following definition.
Definition 8.13.1 
LU-Factorization
Let A be an n  n matrix. If A can be written as a product A  LU where L and U are lower 
triangular and upper triangular matrices, respectively, then we say that A  LU is an 
LU-factorization of A.
An LU-factorization of a matrix A is also called an LU-decomposition of the matrix A.

 Finding an LU-Factorization Of course, the obvious question is: How do we find an 
LU-factorization for a given matrix A? For the sake of discussion let’s assume that A is a 3  3 
matrix, although the procedures discussed in this section are applicable to square matrices of any 
order. We want to find two 3  3 matrices L and U such that A  LU or

By carrying out the indicated multiplication on the right-hand side of (3) and equating its 
entries to the corresponding known entries aij on the left-hand side we obtain a system of 9 
equations in 12 variables, the variables being the lij and uij. Recall, such a system is under-
determined and, if consistent, would have many solutions. This leads us immediately to the

Section 8.2.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
conclusion that the matrices L and U in an LU-factorization are not uniquely determined. 
In other words: 
• An n  n matrix A can have several different LU-factorizations. 
The factorization depends on the method used.  
 Doolittle’s Method In order to determine unique matrices L and U we need to impose 
three conditions on the variables lij and uij in (3). The method that we examine in the examples 
that follow is called Doolittle’s method after the American mathematician Myrick H. Doolittle 
(1830–1913). In this method the main diagonal entries lii of L in (3) are chosen to be all 1’s. The 
next example illustrates a method for obtaining the remaining nine variables.

gular matrix L we write

At first glance (5) may look a bit formidable to solve, but it is not. Indeed, (5) is not so much 
a system of equations as it is a sequence of nine linear equations in one variable. The trick in 
solving (5) is to read each equation beginning with the first row moving left to right and use 
previously found values to determine the one variable in each equation. The variable deter-
mined by each equation is indicated in red in (5). Using the values u11  1, u12  1, u13  1 
from the first row in the three equations in the second row yield, in turn, l21  3, u22  2, 
u23  1. Note that we also had to use l21  3 to find u22, and so on. The three equations in 
the third row then give l31  1, l32  1, u33  1. Substituting these values in the appropriate 
triangular matrices in (4) gives LU-factorization,

 An Algorithm Doolittle’s method is very popular in that it is easily programmed in 
computer algebra systems such as Mathematica or MATLAB. In lieu of the brute force technique 
illustrated in Example 2, we can carry out Doolittle’s method using one of the elementary row 
operations that we used in Gaussian elimination to create an upper triangular matrix U out of the 
matrix A. In particular, we use the notion of row addition, that is, adding a nonzero multiple of 
one row of a matrix A to another row. Recall from Section 8.2, the notation cRi  Rj denotes the 
multiplication of the entries in the ith row of a matrix A by a nonzero constant c and adding them 

8.13 LU-Factorization

455
to the corresponding entries in the jth row. We state the following two-step algorithm without a 
formal proof. We assume that A has an LU-factorization.
(i) 
Create an upper triangular matrix U using row addition to zero out the entries below 
the main diagonal of A. For a 3  3 matrix, this looks like

(6)
(ii) Keep a record of the negatives of the multipliers of the rows used in  step (i) by en-
tering these numbers in an appropriate-sized identity matrix I.  If we perform the 
addition cRi  Rj, then enter c in the jth row and ith column of I. For example, if 
we perform 5R1  R2 on A in (6) to zero out the entry in the second row and first 
column, we then replace the 0 in the second row and first column of the 3  3 iden-
tity I by the number 5:

 When finished with the reduction of A to U, the matrix created by recording the 
negatives of all the multipliers of the rows we used is a lower triangular matrix L 
because these numbers are placed in I in exactly the same position as the 0’s in the 
matrix U (below the diagonal).

 Solving Linear Systems Suppose AX  B is a linear system of n equations in n
variables. If an n 3 n coefficient matrix A in the system has an LU-factorization A  LU 
then AX  B is the same as  (LU)X  B,   or  L(UX)  B. This last system can be solved 
efficiently in two steps:
 
 (i)  First, let Y  UX so that L(UX)  B becomes LY  B. Solve for Y by 
 forward-substitution.
 
 (ii) Then solve UX  Y for X using back-substitution.
The next example illustrates the method.

We now use forward-substitution in the second form of the system in (12). That is, we sub-
stitute y1  0 obtained from the first equation into the second equation of (12).  This imme-
diately gives y2  1. Then substituting both these values into the third equation of (12) yields 
y3  3. Since the column matrix Y is now determined, we now solve UX  Y, that is

(13)
We solve the second form of the system in (13) by back-substitution, that is, we substitute
 x3   3 from the third equation into the second equation to obtain  x2   2. Substituting 
these two values into the first equation of (13) yields x1  1. Hence the solution of the 
original system is x1  1,   x2   2,   x3   3.
 Relationship to Determinants If an n 3 n matrix A has an LU-factorization A  LU, 
then det A is easy to evaluate using the determinant property det A  det L  det U.

page 401.

REMARKS
(i) Not every n 3 n matrix A has an LU-factorization. For example, the 2 3 2 matrix 
A  a0
2
1
1b has no LU-factorization. Try the method in Example 2 and see what happens. 
In general, if interchanges of rows are required in the method illustrated in Examples 3 and 4 
in order to obtain U, then we say that an LU-factorization does not exist.
(ii) When solving a linear system AX  B by Gaussian elimination, the steps of that method 
must be repeated if the coefficient matrix A is the same but the column vector B is changed. 
The method for solving systems of linear equations illustrated in Example 5 is especially 
useful if a system AX  B has to be solved for different vectors Bi,  i  1, 2, p,  n, since the 
matrices L and U remain the same in each system and so can be retained in a computer pro-
gram. See Problems 31–34 in Exercises 8.13.
(iii) If a matrix A already has a 0 below its main diagonal such as
A  °
1
4
5
2
1
3
0
4
6
¢
then we do not have to zero out the entry in the third row and first column by a row addition.  
So in the matrix in which we are recording the negatives of the multipliers we simply retain 
the 0 in the third row and first column. 
(iv) Had we chosen the main diagonal entries uii of U in (3) to be all 1’s, then an LU-factorization 
of a 3 3 3 matrix A looks like

This is called Crout’s method because it was devised by the American mathematician 
Preston D. Crout (1907–1984). Like the Doolittle method, Crout’s method also gives a unique 
LU-factorization of A. See Problems 41 and 42 in Exercises 8.13.   
(v) Cholesky’s method discovered by the French military officer and mathematician Andre-
Louis Cholesky (1875–1918) is a way of finding an LU-factorization of a symmetric matrix,

8.14 Cryptography
INTRODUCTION The word cryptography is a combination of two Greek words: crypto, 
meaning “hidden” or “secret,” and grapho, which means “writing.” Cryptography then is the 
study of making “secret writings” or codes.
In this section we will consider a system of encoding and decoding messages that requires 
both the sender of the message and the receiver of the message to know:
•  a specified rule of correspondence between a set of symbols (such as letters of the alphabet 
and punctuation marks from which messages are composed) and a set of integers; and
• a specified nonsingular matrix A.

460 
| CHAPTER 8 Matrices
 Encoding/Decoding A natural correspondence between the first 27 nonnegative integers 
and the letters of the alphabet and a blank space (to separate words) is given by
From (1) the numerical equivalent of the message

is

(2)
The sender will encode the message by means of the nonsingular matrix A and, as we shall see, 
the receiver of the encoded message will decode the message by means of the (unique) matrix 
A1. The numerical message (2) is now written as a matrix. Since there are 23 symbols in the 
message, we need a matrix that will hold a minimum of 24 entries (an m  n matrix has mn 
entries). We choose to write (2) as the 3  8 matrix

Note that the last entry a38 in the message matrix M has been simply padded with a space repre-
sented by the number 0. Of course, we could have written (2) as a 6  4 or a 4  6 matrix but 
that would require a larger encoding matrix. A 3  8 matrix allows us to encode the message by 
means of a 3  3 matrix. The size of the matrices used is only a concern when the encoding and 
decoding are done by hand rather than by a computer.
The encoding matrix A is chosen, or rather constructed, so that
• A is nonsingular,
• A has only integer entries, and
• A1 has only integer entries.
The last criterion is not particularly difficult to accomplish. We need only select the integer 
entries of A in such a manner that det A  1. For a 2  2 or a 3  3 matrix we can then find 
A1 by the formulas in (4) and (5) of Section 8.6. If A has integer entries, then all the cofactors 
C11, C12, and so on, are also integers. For the discussion on hand we choose

You should verify that det A  1.
The original message is encoded by premultiplying the message matrix M by A; that is, the 
message is sent as the matrix:

You should try to imagine the difficulty of decoding (5) without knowledge of A. But the re-
ceiver of the encoded message B knows A and its inverse, and so decoding is the straightforward 
computation of premultiplying B by A1:

By also knowing the original correspondence (1), the receiver translates the numbers into
SEND_THE_DOCUMENT_TODAY 
where we have indicated the blank spaces by lines.
Some observations are in order. The correspondence or mapping (1) is one of many such cor-
respondences that can be set up between the letters of the alphabet (we could even include 
punctuation symbols such as the comma and period) and integers. Using the 26 letters of the 
alphabet and the blank space, we can set up 27! of these correspondences. (Why?) Furthermore, 
we could have used a 2  2 matrix to encode (2). The size of the message matrix M would then 
have to be at least 2  12 in order to contain the 23 entries of the message. For example, if

There is no particular reason why the numerical message (2) has to be broken down as rows 
(1  8 vectors) as in the matrix (3). Alternatively, (2) could be broken down as columns (3  1

8.15 An Error-Correcting Code
INTRODUCTION In contrast to the last section, there is no connotation of secretiveness 
to the word code as used in this section. We are going to examine briefly the concept of digital 
communication, say, communication between a satellite and a computer. As a consequence, we 
will deal only with matrices whose entries are binary digits, namely, 0s and 1s. When adding 
and multiplying such matrices, we will use arithmetic modulo 2. This arithmetic is defined by 
the addition and multiplication tables

Fundamental properties such as the commutative and associative laws hold in this system. The 
only notable exception here is that 1  1  0.
 Binary Strings In digital communication the messages or words are binary n-tuples; 
that is, n-tuples consisting of only 0s and 1s or bits. An n-bit word is also said to be a binary
string of length n.
EXAMPLE 1 
Binary Strings
(a) The ordered 4-tuple (0, 1, 0, 1) is a 4-bit word or a string of length four.
(b) The binary (that is, base 2) representation of the number 39 is 1 0 0 1 1 1 or as a 6-tuple
(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1).
(c) The ASCII* word for the letter Z is the string of length eight: (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0). 
For convenience a word of length n will be written as a 1  n matrix, that is, as a row vector. 
For example, the 4-bit word in Example 1 would be written as the 1  4 matrix W  (0  1  0  1).
 Codes By encoding a message, we mean a process whereby we transform a word W of 
length n into another word C of length n  m by augmenting W with m additional bits, called 
parity check bits. An encoded word is said to be a code word. By decoding a received message 
we mean another process that gives either the decoded message or an indication that an error has 
occurred during transmission. An encoding/decoding scheme is called a code.
One of the simplest codes is the parity check code. In this code a word is encoded according 
to the rule:
   If the number of ones in the word is  
even: Add 0 to the word.
odd: Add 1 to the word.
 
(1)
The word parity refers to whether the number of ones in a word is even or odd. The encoding 
rule given in (1) makes the parity of the code word always even.
EXAMPLE 2 
Encoding Words
Use the parity check code to encode the words:
(a) W  (1  0  0  0  1  1)             (b) W  (1  1  1  0  0  1).
SOLUTION (a) Since the number of ones in W is odd, we add the extra bit 1 to the end of the 
word W. The code word is then C  (1  0  0  0  1  1  1).
(b) In this case the number of ones is even, so the extra bit added to the word is 0. The encoded 
word is C  (1  1  1  0  0  1  0).
*American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
In digital communication it is the encoded word C that is transmitted. But due to some kind of 
interference or noise in the transmission channel, one or more of the bits of C may be changed. 
Thus, the message transmitted is not always the message received. See FIGURE 8.15.1.
The parity check code enables the decoder to detect single errors. Suppose R is the message 
received. A single error in R means that one bit has been changed; either a zero has been changed 
to a one or a one has been changed to a zero. In either circumstance the parity of the word R is odd.

EXAMPLE 3 
Decoding Words
Use the parity check code to decode the words:  
(a) R  (1 1 0 0 1 0 1)        (b) R  (1 0 1 1 0 0 0).
SOLUTION  (a) The parity of R is even. We drop the last bit and take the decoded mes sage 
to be (1 1 0 0 1 0).
(b) The parity of R is odd. The decoding is simple: a parity error. 
For some types of digital communication, such as communication internal to a computer, 
the parity check code is adequate. But Example 2 clearly indicates one major pitfall of the 
code: If an error occurs, we do not know how to correct it since we do not know which bit 
is incorrect. Moreover, multiple errors could occur in transmission. If, say, two ones were 
changed to zeros in transmission, the message received still has even parity and the decod-
ing takes place by dropping the last bit. In this case at least one of the bits in the decoded 
message is in error.
 Hamming Codes The parity check code is an example of an error-detecting, but not an 
error-correcting, code. For the remainder of this discussion we will consider an error-detecting/
correcting code called the Hamming (7, 4) code. This code, one of a widely used set of codes 
invented by the mathematician Richard W. Hamming (1915–1998) at Bell Laboratories in the 
1950s, is an encoding/decoding scheme that can detect the presence of a single error in a received 
message and can tell which bit must be corrected. In the (7, 4) code the encoding process con-
sists of transforming a 4-bit word W  (w1  w2  w3  w4) into a 7-bit code word
 
C  (c1  c2  w1  c3  w2  w3  w4),
where c1, c2, and c3 denote the parity check bits. (Words longer than four bits can be broken up 
into sequences of words of length four.)
 Encoding In the Hamming (7, 4) code, the parity check bits c1, c2, and c3 are defined in 
terms of the information bits w1, w2, w3, and w4:
 
c1  w1  w2  w4
 
c2  w1  w3  w4 
(2)
 
c3  w2  w3  w4,
where the arithmetic is carried out modulo 2. Using matrices, we can write (2) as the product

EXAMPLE 4 
Encoding a Word
Encode the word W  (1  0  1  1).
SOLUTION  From (3) we have, with w1  1, w2  0, w3  1, and w4  1:

From this product we see that c1  0, c2  1, c3  0, and so the corresponding code 
word is C  (0  1  1  0  0  1  1). 
Before launching into the details of how to decode a message we need to introduce a special 
matrix. We first observe that in modulo 2 arithmetic there are no negative numbers; the additive 
inverse of 1 is 1, not 1. With this in mind, we can write the system (2) in the equivalent form
 
c3  w2  w3  w4  0
 
c2  w1  w3  w4  0 
(4)
 
c1  w1  w2  w4  0.
These are called parity check equations. This means that each ci is a parity check on three of 
the digits in the original word. For instance, if the number of ones in the three digits w2, w3, and 
w4 is odd, then, as in the parity check code discussed previously, we would take c1  1 and so 
on. As a matrix product, (4) can be written

is called the parity check matrix. We have shown in (5) that the binary digits of a code word 
C  (c1  c2  w1  c3  w2  w3  w4) satisfy the matrix equation
 
HCT  0. 
(6)
A closer inspection of H shows a surprising fact: The columns of H, left to right, are the numbers 
1 through 7 written in binary. For example, by writing the column °
1
1
0
¢  as 1 1 0, we recognize 
the binary representation of the number 6.
Let R be a 1  7 matrix representing the received message. Since H is a 3  7 matrix and RT
is a 7  1 matrix, the product
 
S  HRT 
(7)
is a 3  1 matrix called the syndrome of R.

CHAPTER 8 Matrices
 Decoding If the syndrome of the received message R is
 
S  HRT  0,
then, in view of the result in (6), we conclude that R is a code word, and it is assumed that the 
transmission is correct and that R is the same as the original encoded message C. The decoding 
of the message is accomplished by simply dropping the three check bits in R.
EXAMPLE 5 
Syndromes
Compute the syndrome of:  
(a) R  (1  1  0  1  0  0  1)        (b)  R  (1  0  0  1  0  1  0).

Since S  0, the received message R is not a code word. 
As mentioned earlier, the Hamming (7, 4) code enables us to detect and also to correct a single 
error in the message R. Now let C be a code word and let E  (e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7) be a single-
error noise word added to C during its transmission. The entries of E are defined by
ei  e1,
if noise changes the ith bit
0,
if noise does not change the ith bit.
The received message is then R  C  E. From the property RT  CT  ET and the distributive 
law, we see that the syndrome of R is the same as the syndrome of E:
 
HRT  H(CT  ET)  HCT  HET  0  HET  HET.
From the definition of matrix addition, it is a straightforward matter to verify that the syndrome of E
 
HET  °
e4  e5  e6  e7
e2  e3  e6  e7
e1  e3  e5  e7

Now consider the set of 3  1 column vectors whose entries are binary digits. Since there are 
only two ways to select each of the three entries, there are 23  8 such vectors. The seven nonzero
vectors are the columns of H or the column vectors displayed in (8). The syndrome S of the re-
ceived message R is a 3  1 column vector with binary entries; hence, if S  0, then S must be 
one of the columns of H. If R contains a single error, then S  0 and, since the entries of E are all 
zero except for one entry of one, we see from (8) that the syndrome itself indicates which bit is 
in error. In practice there is no need to write out (8); just compute the syndrome S of the received 
message R. S is a column of H and consequently is the binary number of the bit that is in error.
EXAMPLE 6 
Decoding a Word
In part (b) of Example 5 we saw that the syndrome of the message R   (1  0  0  1  0  1  0) 
was S  °
0
1
1
¢ . This is the third column of H (or the binary representation of the number 3) 
and so we conclude that the third bit in R is incorrect. Changing zero to one gives the code 
word C  (1  0  1  1  0  1  0). Hence by dropping the first, second, and fourth bits from C
we arrive at the decoded message (1  0  1  0).
In these brief descriptions of cryptography and coding theory we have not even begun to scratch 
the surface of these fascinating subjects. Our goal was a modest one: to show how matrix theory 
is a natural working tool in various areas of mathematics and computer science.
REMARKS
The Hamming (7, 4) code can detect but not correct any pair of errors. Students interested in 
how this is done or in further details of coding theory should check their library for more 
specialized texts.

8.16 Method of Least Squares
INTRODUCTION When performing experiments we often tabulate data in the form of ordered 
pairs (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn), with each xi distinct. Given the data, it is then often desirable 
to be able to extrapolate or predict y from x by finding a mathematical model, that is, a function 
that approximates or “fits” the data. In other words, we want a function f(x) such that
 
f (x1)  y1,   f (x2)  y2,   . . . ,   f (xn)  yn.
But naturally we do not want just any function but a function that fits the data as closely as possible.
In the discussion that follows we shall confine our attention to the problem of finding a linear 
polynomial f (x)  ax  b or straight line that “best fits” the data (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn). The 
procedure for finding this linear function is known as the method of least squares.
We begin with an example.

EXAMPLE 1 
Line of Best Fit
Consider the data (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5) shown in FIGURE 8.16.1(a). Visually, and the 
fact that the line y  x  1, shown in Figure 8.16.1(b), passes through two of the data points, 
we might take this line as that best fitting the data. 
Obviously we need something better than a visual guess to determine the linear function 
y  f (x), as in the last example. We need a criterion that defines the concept of “best fit” or, as 
it is sometimes called, “the goodness of fit.”
If we try to match the data points with the function f (x)  ax  b, then we wish to find a and b
that satisfy the system of equations
 
y1  ax1  b
 
y2  ax2  b

(2)
Unfortunately (1) is an overdetermined system and, unless the data points lie on the same line, 
has no solution. Thus we shall be content to find a vector X  aa
bb so that the right side AX is 
close to the left side Y.

 
8.16 Method of Least Squares 
| 469
 Least Squares Line If the data points are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn), then one way to 
determine how well the linear function f (x)  ax  b fits the data is to measure the vertical 
distances between the points and the graph of f:
 
ei  |yi  f (xi)|,   i  1, 2, . . . , n.
We can think of each ei as the error in approximating the data value yi by the functional value 
f(xi). See FIGURE 8.16.2. Intuitively, we know that the function f will fit the data well if the sum of 
all the ei values is a minimum. Actually, a more convenient approach to the problem is to find a 
linear function f so that the sum of the squares of all the ei values is a minimum. We shall define 
the solution of the system (1) to be those coefficients a and b that minimize the expression E  
e1 
2  e2 
2  . . .  en 
2; that is,
 
E  [ y1  f (x1)]2  [ y2  f (x2)]2  . . .  [ yn  f (xn)]2
 
 [ y1  (ax1  b)]2  [ y2  (ax2  b)]2  . . .  [ yn  (axn  b)]2
or 
E  a
n
i1
fyi 2 axi 2 bg2. 
(3)
The expression E is called the sum of the square errors. The line y  ax  b that minimizes 
the sum of the square errors (3) is defined to be the line of best fit and is called the least squares 
line for the data (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn).
The problem remains: How does one find a and b so that (3) is a minimum? The answer can 
be found from calculus. If we think of (3) as a function of two variables a and b, then to find the 
minimum value of E we set the first partial derivatives equal to zero:
 
0E
0a  0 and 0E
0b  0.
The last two conditions yield, in turn,
 
2 a

i1
xi[ yi  axi  b]  0
 
2 a

[ yi  axi  b]  0.

Expanding the sums and using gn

(5)
Although we shall not give the details, the values of a and b that satisfy the system (5) yield the 
minimum value of E.
In terms of matrices it can be shown that (5) is equivalent to
 
ATAX  ATY, 
(6)
where A, Y, and X are defined in (2). Since A is an n  2 matrix and AT is a 2  n matrix, the 
matrix ATA is a 2  2 matrix. Moreover, unless the data points all lie on the same vertical line, 
Partial differentiation is 
reviewed in Section 9.4.

the overdetermined system

Thus the least squares solution of (8) is a  1.1 and b  0.5, and the least squares line is

For the line y  x  1 that we guessed and that also passed through two of the data points, 
we find E  3.0.
By way of comparison, FIGURE 8.16.3 shows the data points, the line y  x  1 (green), and 
the least squares line y  1.1x  0.5 (blue).

8.17 Discrete Compartmental Models
INTRODUCTION The construction of the mathematical model (3) in Section 2.9, describing 
the number of pounds of salt in two connected tanks in which brine is flowing into and out of the 
tanks, is an example of compartmental analysis. In the discussion in Section 2.9, the compart-
mental model was a system of differential equations. In this section we introduce the notion of 
a discrete mathematical model.
 The General Two-Compartment Model Suppose material flows between two tanks 
with volumes V1 and V2. In the diagram shown in FIGURE 8.17.1, F01, F12, F21, F10, and F20 denote 
flow rates. Note that the double-subscripted symbol Fij denotes the flow rate from tank i to tank j. 
Next, suppose a second substance, called the tracer, is infused into compartment 1 at a known 
rate I(t). As we did in Section 2.9, we will assume that the tracer is thoroughly mixed in both 
compartments at all times t. If x(t) denotes the amount of tracer in compartment 1 and y(t) the 
amount of tracer in compartment 2, then the concentrations are c1(t)  x(t)/V1 and c2(t)  y(t)/V2, 
respectively. It follows that the general two-compartment model is
 
dx
dt   (F12  F10)c1(t)  F21c2(t)  I(t)
 
dy
dt   F21c1(t)  (F21  F20)c2(t). 
(1)
The model in (1) keeps track of the amount of tracer that flows between the compartments. 
The material consisting of, say, a fluid and a tracer is continually interchanged. We present next 
a model that keeps track of compartmental contents every t units of time and assumes that the 
system changes only at times t, 2t, . . . , nt, . . . . Of course, by selecting t very small, we can 
approximate the continuous case.
 Discrete Compartmental Models In constructing a compartmental model of a phys-
ical system, we conceptually separate the system into a distinct number of small components 
between which material is transported. Compartments need not be spatially distinct (like the 
tanks used in Section 2.9) but must be distinguishable on some basis. The following are a few 
examples:
•  Acid rain (containing strontium 90, for example) is deposited onto pastureland. Compartments 
might be grasses, soil, streams, and litter.
•  In studying the flow of energy through an aquatic ecosystem, we might separate the system 
into phytoplankton, zooplankton, plankton predators, seaweed, small carnivores, large 
carnivores, and decay organisms.
•  A tracer is infused into the bloodstream and is lost to the body by the metabolism of a 
particular organ and by excretion. Appropriate compartments might be arterial blood, 
venous blood, the organ, and urine.
Suppose then that a system is divided into n compartments and, after each t units of time, 
material is interchanged between compartments. We will assume that a fixed fraction tij of the 
contents of compartment j are passed to compartment i every t units of time, as depicted in 
FIGURE 8.17.2. This hypothesis is known as the linear donor- controlled hypothesis.
Let the entries xi in the n  1 matrix X,

represent the amount of tracer in compartment i. We say that X specifies the state of the system. 
The n  1 matrix Y is the state of the system t units of time later. We will show that X and Y

are related by the matrix equation Y  TX, where T is an n  n matrix determined by the transfer
coefficients tij. To find T, observe, for example, that
 
y1  x1  (amount of tracer entering 1)  (amount of tracer leaving 1)
 
 x1  (t12x2  t13x3  . . .  t1n xn)  (t21  t31  . . .  tn1) x1
 
 (1  t21  t31  . . .  tn1) x1  t12x2  . . .  t1n xn.
If we let t11  1  t21  t31  . . .  tn1, then t11 is just the fraction of the contents of compart-
ment 1 that remains in 1.
Letting tii  1  jitji we have, in general,
 
y1  t11x1  t12 x2  p  t1n xn
y2  t21x1  t22 x2  p  t2n xn

The matrix equation in (3) is the desired equation Y  TX. The matrix T  (tij)nn is called the 
transfer matrix. Note that the sum of the entries in any column, the transfer coefficients, is equal 
to 1.
Discrete compartmental models are illustrated in the next two examples.
Note: A transfer matrix is an ex-
ample of a stochastic matrix. See 
Problem 32 in Exercises 8.8.
EXAMPLE 1

In FIGURE 8.17.3 the three boxes represent three compartments. The content of each compart-
ment at time t is indicated in each box. The transfer coefficients are shown along the arrows 
connecting the compartments.

specifies the rate of transfer to compartment i from compartment j. Hence we are given that 
t21  0.2, t12  0.05, t32  0.3, t23  0, t13  0.25, and t31  0. From these numbers we

X1  TX0,  X2  TX1,  X3  TX2, . . . ,  Xn1  TXn.

We could, of course, use the method illustrated in Section 8.9 to compute Tn, but with the aid of 
a calculator or a CAS it is just as easy to use the recursion formula Xn1  TXn by letting 
n  0, 1, . . . .
EXAMPLE 2 
States of an Ecosystem
Strontium-90 is deposited into pastureland by rainfall. To study how this material is cycled 
through the ecosystem, we divide the system into the compartments shown in FIGURE 8.17.4. 
Suppose that t  1 month and the transfer coefficients (which have been estimated experi-
mentally) shown in the figure are measured in fraction/month. (We will ignore that some 
strontium-90 is lost due to radioactive decay.) Suppose that rainfall has deposited the strontium-90 
into the compartments so that X0  ±

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
9.1 
Vector Functions
INTRODUCTION Recall that a curve C in the xy-plane is simply a set of ordered pairs 
(x, y). We say that C  is a parametric curve if the x- and y-coordinates of a point on the curve are 
defined by a pair of functions x  f (t), y  g(t) that are continuous on some interval a  t  b. 
The notion of a parametric curve extends to 3-space as well. A parametric curve in space, or 
space curve, is a set of ordered triples (x, y, z) where
 
x  f (t),  y  g(t),  z  h(t), 
(1)
are continuous on an interval defined by a  t  b. In this section we combine the concepts of 
parametric curves with vectors.
 Vector-Valued Functions It is often convenient in science and engineering to introduce 
a vector r whose components are functions of a parameter t. We say that
 
r(t)    f (t), g(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j
and 
r(t)    f (t), g(t), h(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j  h(t) k,
are vector-valued functions or simply vector functions. As shown in FIGURE 9.1.1, for a given 
value of the parameter, say t0, the vector r(t0) is the position vector of a point P on a curve C. 
In other words, as the parameter t varies, we can envision the curve C being traced out by the 
moving arrowhead of r(t).
We have already seen an example of parametric equations, as well as the vector function of 
a space curve, in Section 7.5, when we discussed the line in 3-space.
EXAMPLE 1 
Circular Helix
Graph the curve traced by the vector function
 
r(t)  2 cos t i  2 sin t j  t k, t  0.
SOLUTION The parametric equations of the curve are x  2 cos t, y  2 sin t, z  t. By 
eliminating the parameter t from the first two equations:
 
x 2  y2  (2 cos t)2  (2 sin t)2  22
we see that a point on the curve lies on the circular cylinder x2  y2  4. As seen in FIGURE 9.1.2 
and the accompanying table, as the value of t increases, the curve winds upward in a spiral 
or circular helix.

The curve in Example 1 is a special case of the vector function
 
r(t)  a cos t i  b sin t j  ct k,  a  0, b  0, c  0,
which describes an elliptical helix. When a  b, the helix is circular. The pitch of a helix is defined 
to be the number 2pc. Problems 9 and 10 in Exercises 9.1 illustrate two other kinds of helixes.
EXAMPLE 2 
Circle in a Plane
Graph the curve traced by the vector function
 
r(t)  2 cos t i  2 sin t j  3 k.
SOLUTION The parametric equations of this curve are x  2 cos t, y  2 sin t, z  3. As 
in Example 1, we see that a point on the curve must also lie on the cylinder x 2  y 2  4. 
However, since the z-coordinate of any point has the constant value z  3, the vector function 
r(t) traces out a circle 3 units above the xy-plane. See FIGURE 9.1.3.
EXAMPLE 3 
Curve of Intersection
Find the vector function that describes the curve C of intersection of the plane y  2x and the 
paraboloid z  9  x 2  y 2.
SOLUTION We first parameterize the curve C of intersection by letting x  t. It follows 
that y  2t and z  9  t 2  (2t)2  9  5t 2. From the parametric equations x  t, y  2t, 
z  9  5t 2, we see that a vector function describing the trace of the paraboloid in the plane 
y  2x is given by r(t)  t i  2t j  (9  5t 2) k. See FIGURE 9.1.4.
 Limits, Continuity, and Derivatives The fundamental notion of the limit of a vec-
tor function r(t)    f (t), g(t), h(t) is defined in terms of the limits of the component functions.
Definition 9.1.1 
Limit of a Vector Function
If limtSa f (t), limtSa g(t), and limtSa h(t) exist, then
 
lim
tSa r (t)  hlim
tSa f (t), lim
tSa g(t), lim
tSa h(t)i.

C
The notation t S a in Definition 9.1.1 can, of course, be replaced by t S a, t S a, t S q, or 
t S q.
As an immediate consequence of Definition 9.1.1, we have the following result.
Theorem 9.1.1 
Properties of Limits
If limtSa r1(t)  L1 and limtSa r2(t)  L2, then
(i)  lim
tSa cr1(t)  cL1, c a scalar
(ii)  lim
tSa [r1(t)  r2(t)]  L1  L2
(iii)  lim
tSa r1(t)  r2(t)  L1  L2.
Equivalently, r(t) is continuous at t  a if and only if the component functions f, g, and h are 
continuous there.
Definition 9.1.2 
Continuity of a Vector Function
A vector function r is said to be continuous at t  a if
(i)  r(a) is defined,  (ii) lim
tSa r(t) exists, and  (iii) lim
tSa r(t)  r(a).

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
The derivative of r is also written dr/dt. The next theorem will show that on a practical level 
the derivative of a vector function is obtained by simply differentiating its component functions.
Definition 9.1.3 
Derivative of Vector Function
The derivative of a vector function r is
 
r	(t)  lim
DtS0 1
Dt [r(t  
t)  r(t)] 
(2)
for all t for which the limit exists.
Theorem 9.1.2 
Differentiation of Components
If r(t)    f (t), g(t), h(t), where f, g, and h are differentiable, then
 
r	(t)    f 	(t), g	(t), h	(t).
PROOF: From (2) we have
 r9(t)  lim
DtS0 1
Dt Bk  f ( t  Dt), g(t  Dt), h(t  Dt)l 2 k f ( t), g(t), h(t)lR

DtS0hf (t  Dt) 2 f (t)
Dt
, g(t  Dt) 2 g(t)
Dt
, h(t  Dt) 2 h(t)
Dt
i.
Taking the limit of each component yields the desired result.
 Smooth Curves When the component functions of a vector function r have continuous 
first derivatives and r	(t)  0 for all t in the open interval (a, b), then r is said to be a smooth 
function and the curve C traced by r is called a smooth curve.
 Geometric Interpretation of r	(t) If the vector r	(t) is not 0 at a point P, then it may 
be drawn tangent to the curve at P. As seen in FIGURE 9.1.5, the vectors
 

r  r(t  
t)  r(t)  and  Dr
Dt   1
Dt [r(t  
t)  r(t)]  
are parallel. If we assume lim
tS0 
r/
t exists, it seems reasonable to conclude that as 
t S 0, 
r(t) and r(t  
t) become close and, as a consequence, the limiting position of the vector 
r/
t
is the tangent line at P. Indeed, the tangent line at P is defined as that line through P parallel to r	(t).
EXAMPLE 4 
Tangent Vectors
Graph the curve C that is traced by a point P whose position is given by r(t)  cos 2t i  sin t j, 
0  t  2p. Graph r	(0) and r	(p/6).
SOLUTION By clearing the parameter from the parametric equations x  cos 2t, y  sin t, 
0  t  2p, we find that C is the parabola x  1  2y2, 1  x  1. From r	(t)  2 sin 2t i  cos t j 
we find
 
r	(0)  j  and  r9ap

tively.

EXAMPLE 5 
Tangent Line
Find parametric equations of the tangent line to the graph of the curve C whose parametric 
equations are x  t 2, y  t 2  t, z  7t at t  3.
SOLUTION The vector function that gives the position of a point P on the curve is given by 
r(t)  t 2 i  (t 2  t) j  7t k. Now,
 
r	(t)  2t i  (2t  1) j  7 k  and so  r	(3)  6 i  5 j  7 k,
which is tangent to C at the point whose position vector is
 
r(3)  9 i  6 j  21 k;
that is, P(9, 6, 21). Using the components of r	(3), we see that parametric equations of the 
tangent line are x  9  6t, y  6  5t, z  21  7t.
 Higher-Order Derivatives Higher-order derivatives of a vector function are also 
 obtained by differentiating its components. In the case of the second derivative, we have
 
r(t)    f (t), g(t), h(t)  f  (t) i  g(t) j  h(t) k.
EXAMPLE 6 
Derivative of a Vector Function
If r(t)  (t 3  2t 2) i  4t j  et k, then
 
r	(t)  (3t 2  4t) i  4 j  et k  and  r(t)  (6t  4) i  et k.
Theorem 9.1.3 
Chain Rule
If r is a differentiable vector function and s  u(t) is a differentiable scalar function, then the 
derivative of r(s) with respect to t is
dr
dt  dr
ds ds
dt   r	(s) u	(t).

If r(s)  cos 2s i  sin 2s j  e3s k, where s  t 4, then

 8t 3 sin(2t 4) i  8t 3 cos(2t 4) j  12t 3e23t4 k.
Details of the proof of the next theorem are left as exercises.

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
Since the cross product of two vectors is not commutative, the order in which r1 and r2 appear 
in part (iv) of Theorem 9.1.4 must be strictly observed.
 Integrals of Vector Functions If f, g, and h are integrable, then the indefinite and 
definite integrals of a vector function r(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j  h(t) k are defined, respectively, by
 
 #r (t) dt  B#f (t) dtR   i  B#g(t) dtR   j  B#h(t) dtR  k

The indefinite integral of r is another vector function R  c such that R	(t)  r(t).
Note of caution.
EXAMPLE 8

If r(t)  6t 2 i  4e2t j  8 cos 4t k,
then

where c  c1i  c2  j  c3 k.
 Length of a Space Curve If r(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j  h(t) k is a smooth function, then it 
can be shown that the length of the smooth curve traced by r is given by
 
s  #

(3)
 Arc Length as a Parameter A curve in the plane or in space can be parameterized in 
terms of the arc length s.
EXAMPLE 9 
Example 1 Revisited
Consider the helix of Example 1. Since ir	(t) i  !5, it follows from (3) that the length of 
the curve from r(0) to an arbitrary point r(t) is
 
s  #
t
0
"5 du  "5t,
where we have used u as a dummy variable of integration. Using t  s/!5, we obtain a vector 
equation of the helix as a function of arc length:
 
r(s)  2 cos s
"5
 i  2 sin s
"5
 j 
s

 k. 
(4)
Parametric equations of the helix are then
 
f (s)  2 cos s
"5
,  g(s)  2 sin s
"5
,  h(s)  s
"5
.
The derivative of a vector function r(t) with respect to the parameter t is a tangent vector to the 
curve traced by r. However, if the curve is parameterized in terms of arc length s, then r	(s) is a 
unit tangent vector. To see this, let a curve be described by r(s), where s is arc length. From (3), 
the length of the curve from r(0) to r(s) is s  s
0ir	(u)i  du. Differentiation of this last equation 
with respect to s then yields ir	(s)i   1.

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
9.2 Motion on a Curve
INTRODUCTION In the preceding section we saw that the first and second derivatives of the 
vector function r(t)    f (t), g(t), h(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j  h(t) k can be obtained by differentiat-
ing the component functions f, g, and h. In this section we give a physical interpretation to the 
vectors r	(t) and r(t).
 Velocity and Acceleration Suppose a particle or body moves along a curve C so that 
its position at time t is given by the vector function r(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j  h(t) k. If the component 
functions f, g, and h have second derivatives, then the vectors
 
v(t)  r	(t)  f 	(t) i  g	(t) j  h	(t) k
 
a(t)  r(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j  h(t) k
are called the velocity and acceleration of the particle, respectively. The scalar function iv(t)i  
is the speed of the particle. Since
 
iv(t)i  g d r
dt g  Å adx
dt b

speed is related to arc length s by s	(t)  iv(t)i. In other words, arc length is given by s  e
t1
t0 iv(t)i dt. 
It also follows from the discussion of Section 9.1 that if P(x1, y1, z1) is the position of the particle 
on C at time t1, then we may draw v(t1) tangent to C at P. Similar remarks hold for curves traced 
by the vector function r(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j.
EXAMPLE 1 
Velocity and Acceleration Vectors
The position of a moving particle is given by r(t)  t 2 i  t j  5
2 t k. Graph the curve defined 
by r(t) and the vectors v(2) and a(2).
SOLUTION Since x  t 2, y  t, the path of the particle is above the parabola x  y2. When 
t  2 the position vector r(2)  4 i  2 j  5 k indicates that the particle is at the point 
P(4, 2, 5). Now,
 
v(t)  r	(t)  2t  i  j 5
2 k  and  a(t)  r(t)  2 i
so that v(2)  4 i  j  5
2 k and a(2)  2 i. These vectors are shown in FIGURE 9.2.1.
If a particle moves with a constant speed c, then its acceleration vector is perpendicular to 
the velocity vector v. To see this, note that ivi2  c2 or v  v  c2. We differentiate both sides 
with respect to t and obtain, with the aid of Theorem 9.1.4(iii):
 
d
dt (v v)  v d v
dt  d v
dt  v  2v d v
dt  0.
Thus, 
d v
dt   v  0  or  a(t)  v(t)  0 for all t.
EXAMPLE 2 
Velocity and Acceleration Vectors
Suppose the vector function in Example 2 of Section 9.1 represents the position of a particle 
moving in a circular orbit. Graph the velocity and acceleration vector at t  p/4.
SOLUTION Recall that r(t)  2 cos t i  2 sin t j  3 k is the position vector of a particle 
moving in a circular orbit of radius 2 in the plane z  3. When t  p/4 the particle is at the 
point P( !2, !2, 3). Now,
 
v(t)  r	(t)  2 sin t i  2 cos t j
 
a(t)  r(t)  2 cos t i  2 sin t j.

Since the speed is iv(t)i   2 for all time t, it follows from the discussion preceding this 
example that a(t) is perpendicular to v(t). (Verify this.) As shown in FIGURE 9.2.2, the vectors
 
 v ap
4 b  2 sin p
4 i  2 cos p
4 j  "2 i  "2 j
 
 a ap

4 j  "2 i 2 "2 j
are drawn at the point P. The vector v(p/4) is tangent to the circular path and a(p/4) points 
along a radius toward the center of the circle.
 Centripetal Acceleration For circular motion in the plane, described by r(t)  r0 cos vt i 
r0 sin vt j, r0 and v constants, it is evident that r  v2 r. This means that the acceleration 
vector a(t)  r(t) points in the direction opposite to that of the position vector r(t). We then say 
a(t) is centripetal acceleration. See FIGURE 9.2.3. If v  i v(t)i  and a  i a(t)i , we leave it as 
an exercise to show that a  v2/r0.
 Curvilinear Motion in the Plane Many important applications of vector functions 
occur in regard to curvilinear motion in a plane. For example, planetary and projectile motion 
take place in a plane.
In analyzing the motion of short-range ballistic projectiles,* we begin with the acceleration 
of gravity written in vector form: a(t)  g j.
If, as shown in FIGURE 9.2.4, a projectile is launched with an initial velocity v0  v0 cos u i  
v0 sin u j from an initial height s0  s0  j, then
 
v(t)  #(g j) dt  gt j  c1,
where v(0)  v0 implies that c1  v0. Therefore,
 
v(t)  (v0 cos u) i  (gt  v0 sin u) j.
Integrating again and using r(0)  s0 yields
 
r(t)  (v0 cos u)t i  c1
2 gt
 2  (v0 sin u) t  s0d  j. 
(1)
Hence, parametric equations for the trajectory of the projectile are
 
x(t)  (v0 cos u)t,  y(t)  1
2 gt 2  (v0 sin u)t  s0. 
(2)
We are naturally interested in finding the maximum height H and the range R attained by a 
projectile. As shown in FIGURE 9.2.5, these quantities are the maximum values of y(t) and x(t), 
respectively.
*A projectile is shot or hurled rather than self-propelled. In the analysis of long-range ballistic motion, 
the curvature of the Earth must be taken into consideration.
EXAMPLE 3 
Trajectory of a Projectile
A projectile is launched from ground level with an initial speed v0  768 ft/s at an angle of 
elevation u  30. Find (a) the vector function and parametric equations of the projectile’s 
trajectory, (b) the maximum altitude attained, (c) the range of the projectile, and (d) the 
impact speed.
SOLUTION (a) The initial height and velocity are, respectively, s0  0 and
 
r9(0)  v0  (768 cos 308)i  (768 sin 308)j  384"3i  384j.

Integrating (4) and using r(0)  s0  0 then give 
 
r(t)  (384"3)t i  (16t2  384t)j.
The components of this vector function, 
 
x(t)  (384"3)t, y(t)  16t2  384t, 
(5)
are the parametric equations of the projectile’s trajectory.
(b) From (5) we see that y	(t)  0 when 32t  384  0 or t  12 s. The maximum 
height attained by the projectile is 
 
H  y(12)  16(12)2  384(12)  2304 ft.
(c) From (5) we see that y(t)  0 when 16t2  384t  16t(t 2 24)  0. The time 
that projectile hits the ground is t  24 s and the corresponding range is
 
R  x(24)  384"3(24) < 15,963 ft.
(d) Finally, from (4) we see that v(24)  (384"3)i  (384)j and so the impact speed is
 
7v(24)7  "(384!3)2  (384)2  768 ft/s.
In Example 3, note that the impact speed is the same as the launch speed v0  768 ft/s. Verify 
that this is still the case if we change the angle of elevation to, say, u  50. See Problem 16 in 
Exercises 9.2.
REMARKS
We have seen that the rate of change of arc length ds/dt is the same as the speed iv(t)i  ir	(t)i. 
However, as we shall see in the next section, it does not follow that the scalar acceleration 
d 2s/dt 2 is the same as ia(t)i  ir(t)i. See Problem 24 in Exercises 9.2.
In Problems 1–8, r(t) is the position vector of a moving particle.

eration at these points?

(c) the range of the shell, and

 13. A used car is pushed off an 81-ft-high sheer seaside cliff with 
a speed of 4 ft/s. Find the speed at which the car hits the water.
 14. A small projectile is launched from ground level with an initial 
speed of 98 m/s. Find the possible angles of elevation so that 
its range is 490 m.
 15. A football quarterback throws a 100-yd “bomb” at an angle 
of 45 from the horizontal. What is the initial speed of the 
football at the point of release?
 16. If a projectile is launched from level ground, then the initial condi-
tions are r(0)  0, r9(0)  v0  (v0 cos u)i  (v0 sin u)j and 
the vector function (1) becomes
 
r(t)  (v0 cos u)t i  f1
2gt2  (v0 sin u)tg j. 
(6)
 
 This function is equivalent to the solution x(t), y(t) of the 
system of linear differential equations (8) in Problem 21 of 
Exercises 4.6 subject to the same initial conditions. Underlying 
that earlier discussion, as well as in the derivation of (1), is the 
assumption that the projectile is not subject to air resistance. 
Use (6) to show that the impact speed of a projectile is the 
same as the initial speed 7r9(0)7  7v07  v0 for any angle 
of elevation u, 0 , u , 90.
 17. When air resistance is ignored, we saw in Problem 21 
of Exercises 4.6 that a projectile launched at an angle u, 
0 , u , 90 from level ground (r(0)  0), then its horizontal 
range and maximum height are, respectively,
 
R  v2
0
g  sin 2u  and  H  v 2
0
2g sin2 u.
 
 From the first formula, it follows that when the projectile 
is launched at distinct complementary angles the horizontal 
range is the same and that the maximum range is attained 
when the angle of elevation is u  45. But if the projectile is 
launched from an initial height s0 . 0 the foregoing formulas 
and statements are not valid.
(a) With v0  480 ft/s, s0  1600 ft rework Problem 12, 
but this time use the complementary angle of elevation 
u  60. Compare the maximum height, range, and im-
pact speed of the projectile with the answers to parts (b), 
(c) and (d) of Problem 12.
(b) Use a graphing utility or CAS to plot the trajectory of the 
projectile defined by the parametric equations x(t) and 
y(t) in part (a) of Problem 12. Repeat for the parametric 
equations in part (a) of this problem. Superimpose both 
of these curves on the same coordinate system.
 18. As mentioned in Problem 17, if a projectile is launched from 
an initial height s0 . 0 the maximum range of the projectile 
is not attained using u  45 as the angle of elevation.
(a) A projectile is launched from an initial height of v0  480 ft/s, 
s0  1600 ft, at an angle of elevation of u  45. Use a 
calculator or CAS to find the time the projectile hits the 
ground and the corresponding range.
(b) If the angle of elevation in part (a) is changed to u  39.76, 
show that the range is greater than that in part (a).
(c) Use a graphing utility or CAS to plot the trajectories of 
the projectiles in parts (a) and (b). Superimpose both of 
these curves on the same coordinate system.
 19. If a projectile is launched from level ground, the initial con-
ditions are r(0)  0, r9(0)  v0  (v0 cos u)i  (v0 sin u)j, 
and if linear air resistance is taken into consideration, the 
vector function analogue of (1) is

 This function is equivalent to the solution x(t), y(t) of the 
system of linear differential equations (11) in Problem 22 of 
Exercises 4.6 subject to the same initial conditions. Here b . 0 
is a constant of proportionality related to the air resistance or 
drag. If m  1
4 slug, g  32 ft/s2, b  0.02, v0  300 ft/s, 
and u  38, use a calculator or CAS to find the impact speed 
of the projectile. See part (b) of Problem 22 in Exercises 4.6.
 20. Suppose the angle of elevation of the projectile in Problem 19 
is changed to u  52. Do you think that the impact speed of 
the projectile is the same, greater than, or less than the value 
found in that problem? Prove your assertion.
 21. A projectile is fired from a cannon directly at a target that 
is dropped from rest simultaneously as the cannon is fired. 
Show that the projectile will strike the target in midair. See 
FIGURE 9.2.6. [Hint: Assume that the origin is at the muzzle of 
the cannon and that the angle of elevation is u. If rp and rt are 
position vectors of the projectile and target, respectively, is 
there a time at which rp  rt?]

tance a supply pack travels relative to the point from which 
it was dropped. At what line-of-sight angle a should the

 where p  m v is called linear momentum. The angular 
momentum of the particle with respect to the origin is defined 
to be L  r  p, where r is its position vector. If the torque 
of the particle about the origin is t  r  F  r  d p/dt,

tion vector r of the planet. Here k is the gravitational constant, 
r  i ri , u  r/r is a unit vector in the direction of r, and the 
minus sign indicates that F is an attractive force—that is, a 
force directed toward the Sun. See FIGURE 9.2.9.

9.3 Curvature and Components of Acceleration
INTRODUCTION Let C be a smooth curve in either 2- or 3-space traced out by a vector 
function r(t). In this section we are going to consider in greater detail the acceleration vector 
a(t)  r(t) introduced in the last section. But before doing this, we need to examine a scalar 
quantity called the curvature of a curve.
 A Definition We know that r	(t) is a tangent vector to the curve C, and consequently
 
T(t)  r9(t)
ir9(t)i 
(1)
is a unit tangent. But recall from the end of Section 9.1 that if C is parameterized by arc length s, 
then a unit tangent to the curve is also given by dr/ds. The quantity ir	(t)i in (1) is related to arc 
length s by ds/dt  i r	(t)i . Since the curve C is smooth, we know from pages 482 and 484 that 
ds/dt  0. Hence by the Chain Rule,
 
d r
dt  d r
ds ds
dt and so dr
ds 
d r>dt
ds>dt 
 r9(t)
ir9(t)i  T(t). 
(2)
Now suppose C is as shown in FIGURE 9.3.1. As s increases, T moves along C, changing direction 
but not length (it is always of unit length). Along the portion of the curve between P1 and P2 the 
vector T varies little in direction; along the curve between P2 and P3, where C obviously bends 
more sharply, the change in the direction of the tangent T is more pronounced. We use the rate 
at which the unit vector T changes direction with respect to arc length as an indicator of the 
curvature of a smooth curve C.
Definition 9.3.1 
Curvature 
Let r(t) be a vector function defining a smooth curve C. If s is the arc length parameter and 
T  d r/ds is the unit tangent vector, then the curvature of C at a point is
 
k 5 g d T
ds g. 
(3)
The symbol k in (3) is the Greek letter kappa. Now since curves are generally not parameterized 
by arc length, it is convenient to express (3) in terms of a general parameter t. Using the Chain 
Rule again, we can write
 
d T
dt 5 d T
ds  ds
dt and consequently d T
ds 5
d T>dt
ds>dt .

EXAMPLE 1 
Curvature of a Circle
Find the curvature of a circle of radius a.
SOLUTION A circle can be described by the vector function r(t)  a cos t i  a sin t j. Now 
from r	(t)  a sin t i  a cos t j and ir	(t)i   a, we get
 
T(t)  r9(t)
ir9(t)i  sin t i  cos t j  and  T	(t)  cos t i  sin t j.
Hence, from (4) the curvature is
 
k(t)  iT9(t)i
ir9(t)i  " cos2 t 
 sin2 t
a
 1
a. 
(5)
The result in (5) shows that the curvature at a point on a circle is the reciprocal of the radius 
of the circle and indicates a fact that is in keeping with our intuition: A circle with a small 
radius curves more than one with a large radius. See FIGURE 9.3.2.
 Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration Suppose a particle moves 
in 2- or 3-space on a smooth curve C described by the vector function r(t). Then the velocity of the 
particle on C is v(t)  r	(t), whereas its speed is ds/dt  v  iv(t)i. Thus, (1) implies v(t)  v T. 
Differentiating this last expression with respect to t gives acceleration:
 
a(t)  v d T
dt  dv
dt T. 
(6)
Furthermore, with the help of Theorem 9.1.4(iii), it follows from the differentiation of 
T  T  1 that T  d T/dt  0. Hence, at a point P on C the vectors T and d T/dt are  orthogonal. 
If id T/dt i  0, the vector
 
N(t) 
d T>dt
id T>dti 
(7)
is a unit normal to the curve C at P with direction given by d T/dt. The vector N is also called 
the principal normal. But since curvature is k 
idT>dti
v
, it follows from (7) that d T/dt  
kv N. Thus, (6) becomes
 
a(t)  kv2 N  dv
dt  T. 
(8)
By writing (8) as 
a(t)  aN N  aT T, 
(9)
we see that the acceleration vector a of the moving particle is the sum of two orthogonal vec-
tors aN N and aT T. See FIGURE 9.3.3. The scalar functions aT  dv/dt and aN  kv2 are called the 
tangential and normal components of the acceleration, respectively. Note that the tangential 
component of the acceleration results from a change in the magnitude of the velocity v, whereas 
the normal component of the acceleration results from a change in the direction of v.
 The Binormal A third unit vector defined by
 
B(t)  T(t)  N(t)
is called the binormal. The three unit vectors T, N, and B form a right-handed set of mutually 
orthogonal vectors called the moving trihedral. The plane of T and N is called the osculating 
plane,* the plane of N and B is said to be the normal plane, and the plane of T and B is the 
rectifying plane. See FIGURE 9.3.4.

9.3 Curvature and Components of Acceleration

The three mutually orthogonal unit vectors T, N, and B can be thought of as a movable right-
handed coordinate system since
 
B(t)  T(t)  N(t),  N(t)  B(t)  T(t),  T(t)  N(t)  B(t).
This movable coordinate system is referred to as the TNB-frame.
EXAMPLE 2 
Tangent, Normal, and Binormal Vectors
The position of a moving particle is given by r(t)  2 cos t i  2 sin t j  3t k. Find the vectors 
T, N, and B. Find the curvature.
SOLUTION Since r	(t)  2 sin t i  2 cos t j  3 k, ir	(t)i  "13, and so from (1) we 
see that a unit tangent is

Hence, (7) gives the principal normal

Finally, using id T/dti  2/ "13 and ir	(t)i  "13, we obtain from (4) that the curvature 
at any point is the constant
 
k 
2> "13
"13
 2
13.
The fact that the curvature in Example 2 is constant is not surprising, since the curve defined 
by r(t) is a circular helix.
EXAMPLE 3 
Osculating, Normal, Rectifying Planes
At the point corresponding to t  p>2 on the circular helix in Example 2, find an equation of 
(a) the osculating plane, (b) the normal plane, and (c) the rectifying plane. 
SOLUTION From r(p>2)  k0, 2, 3p>2l the point P in question is (0, 2, 3p>2).
(a) A normal vector to the osculating plane at P is

To find an equation of a plane we do not require a unit normal, so in lieu of B(p>2) it 
is a bit simpler to use k3, 0, 2l. From (11) of Section 7.5 an equation of the osculating 
plane is
3(x 2 0)  0(y 2 2)  2az 2 3p
2 b  0  or  3x  2z  3p.

(b) At the point P, the vector T(p>2) 

!13k2, 0, 3l or k2, 0, 3l is normal to the plane 
containing N(p>2) and B(p>2). Hence an equation of the normal plane is
2(x 2 0)  0(y 2 2)  3az 2 3p
2 b  0  or  4x  6z  9p.
(c) Finally, at the point P, the vector N(p>2)  k0, 1, 0l is normal to the plane contain-
ing T(p>2) and B(p>2). An equation of the rectifying plane is
0(x 2 0)  (1)(y 2 2)  0az 2 3p
2 b  0  or  y  2.
With the help of Mathematica, portions of the helix and the osculating plane in Example 3 are 
shown in FIGURE 9.3.5. The point (0, 2, 3p>2) is indicated in the figure by the red dot. 
 Formulas for aT , aN , and Curvature By dotting, and in turn crossing, the vector 
v  v T with (9), it is possible to obtain explicit formulas involving r, r	, and r for the tangential 
and normal components of the acceleration and the curvature. Observe that
 
v  a  aN (v T  N)  aT (v T  T)  aTv

On the other hand,

Since iB i  1, it follows that the normal component of acceleration is

3t 3 k is said to be a “twisted cubic.” If r(t) is the position 
vector of a moving particle, find the tangential and normal components of the acceleration at 
any t. Find the curvature.
 SOLUTION v(t)  r	(t)  i  t j  t 2 k,  a(t)  r(t)  j  2t k.
Since v  a  t  2t 3 and ivi  "1  t 2  t 4, it follows from (10) that

t4  4t2  1
t4  t2  1 .
From (12) we find that the curvature of the twisted cubic is given by
 
k(t)  (t4  4t2  1)
 1>2
(t4  t2  1)
 3>2 .
 Radius of Curvature The reciprocal of the curvature, r  1/k, is called the radius of 
curvature. The radius of curvature at a point P on a curve C is the radius of a circle that “fits” 
the curve there better than any other circle. The circle at P is called the circle of curvature and 
its center is the center of curvature. The circle of curvature has the same tangent line at P as 
the curve C, and its center lies on the concave side of C. For example, a car moving on a curved 
track, as shown in FIGURE 9.3.6, can, at any instant, be thought to be moving on a circle of radius r. 
Hence, the normal component of its acceleration aN  kv2 must be the same as the magnitude 
of its centripetal acceleration a  v2/r. Therefore, k  1/r and r  1/k. Knowing the radius of 
curvature, we can determine the speed v at which a car can negotiate a banked curve without 
skidding. (This is essentially the idea in Problem 26 in Exercises 9.2.)

a(t)  ds

we note that the so-called scalar acceleration d 2s/dt 2, referred to in the last remark, is now

Partial Derivatives
INTRODUCTION In this section we consider functions of two or more variables and how 
to find the instantaneous rate of change—that is, the derivative—of such functions with respect 
to each variable.
 Functions of Two Variables Recall from calculus that a function of two variables
is a rule of correspondence that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers (x, y) of a subset 
of the xy-plane one and only one number z in the set R of real numbers. The set of ordered pairs 
(x, y) is called the domain of the function and the set of corresponding values of z is called the 
range. A function of two variables is usually written z  f (x, y). The variables x and y are called 
the independent variables of the function, and z is called the dependent variable. The graph 
of a function z  f (x, y) is a surface in 3-space. See FIGURE 9.4.1.
 Level Curves For a function z  f (x, y), the curves defined by f (x, y)  c, for suitable 
c, are called the level curves of f. The word level arises from the fact that we can interpret the 
equation f (x, y)  c as the projection onto the xy-plane of the curve of intersection, or trace, of 
z  f (x, y) and the (horizontal or level) plane z  c. See FIGURE 9.4.2.

 Functions of Three or More Variables Functions of three or more variables are 
defined analogously to functions of two variables. For example, a function of three variables
is a rule of correspondence that assigns to each ordered triple of real numbers (x, y, z) of a subset 
of 3-space one and only one number w in the set R of real numbers. We write w  F(x, y, z).
 Level Surfaces Although we cannot draw a graph of a function of three variables 
w  F(x, y, z), we can draw the surfaces defined by F(x, y, z)  c for suitable values of c. These 
surfaces are called level surfaces. This is an unfortunate, though standard, choice of words, since 
level surfaces are usually not level.
EXAMPLE 2 
Level Surfaces
Describe the level surfaces of the function F(x, y, z)  (x 2  y2)/z.
SOLUTION For c  0 the level surfaces are given by
x

z
  c  or  x 2  y 2  cz.
A few members of this family of paraboloids are shown in FIGURE 9.4.4.
 Partial Derivatives The derivative of a function of one variable y  f (x) is given by
dy
dx  lim
DxS0 f (x  Dx) 2 f (x)
Dx
.
In exactly the same manner, we can define a derivative of a function of two variables with respect 
to each variable. If z  f (x, y), then the partial derivative with respect to x is
 
0z
0x  lim
DxS0 f (x  Dx, y) 2 f (x, y)
Dx
 
(1)
and the partial derivative with respect to y is
0z
0y  lim
DyS0 f (x, y  Dy) 2 f (x, y)
Dy
, 
(2)
provided each limit exists.
In (1) the variable y does not change in the limiting process; that is, y is held fixed. Similarly, 
in (2) the variable x is held fixed. The two partial derivatives (1) and (2) then represent the rates 
of change of f with respect to x and y, respectively. On a practical level:
To compute z / x, use the laws of ordinary differentiation while treating y as a constant.
To compute z / y, use the laws of ordinary differentiation while treating x as a constant.
EXAMPLE 3 
Partial Derivatives
If z  4x 3y2  4x 2  y6  1, find z / x and z / y.
SOLUTION We hold y fixed and treat constants in the usual manner. Thus,
0z
0x  12x 2y2  8x.
By treating x as a constant, we obtain
0z
0y  8x 3y  6y5.
 Alternative Symbols The partial derivatives z /x and z /y are often represented by 
alternative symbols. If z  f (x, y), then

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
 Higher-Order and Mixed Derivatives For a function of two variables z  f (x, y), 
the partial derivatives z /x and z /y are themselves functions of x and y. Consequently, we 
can compute second and higher partial derivatives. Indeed, we can find the partial derivative 
of z/x with respect to y, and the partial derivative of z/y with respect to x. The latter types of 
partial derivatives are called mixed partial derivatives. In summary, for z  f (x, y):
Second-order partial derivatives:
 
 02z
0x2  0
0x a 0z
0xb and 02z
0y2  0
0y a 0z
0yb.
Third-order partial derivatives:
 
 03z
0x3  0
0x a 02z
0x2b and   03z
0y3  0
0y a 02z
0y2b.
Mixed second-order partial derivatives:
 
 02z
0x0y  0
0x a 0z
0yb and  02z
0y0x  0
0y a 0z
0xb.
 Alternative Symbols The second- and third-order partial derivatives are denoted by fxx , 
fyy ,  fxxx, and so on. The subscript notation for mixed second partial derivatives is fxy or fyx. Note that
 
fxy  (  fx)y  0
0y a 0z
0xb  02z
0y0x and fyx  02z
0x0y.
Although we shall not prove it, if a function f  has continuous second partial derivatives, then the 
order in which a mixed second partial derivative is done is irrelevant; that is,
 
fxy  fyx .

ables w  F(x, y, z) in the x, y, and z directions are w/x, w/y, and w/z, respectively. To compute, 
say, w/x, we differentiate with respect to x in the usual manner while holding both y and z constant. 
In this manner we extend the process of partial differentiation to functions of any number of variables.
EXAMPLE 4 
Partial Derivatives
If F(x, y, t)  e3pt cos 4x sin 6y, then the partial derivatives with respect to x, y, and t are, in turn,
 
Fx(x, y, t)  4e3pt sin 4x sin 6y,
 
Fy(x, y, t)  6e3pt cos 4x cos 6y,
 
Ft(x, y, t)  3pe3pt cos 4x sin 6y.
 Chain Rule The Chain Rule for functions of one variable states that if y  f (u) is a dif-
ferentiable function of u, and u  g(x) is a differentiable function of x, then the derivative of the 
composite function is
 
dy
dx 5 dy
du du
dx. 
(4)
For a composite function of two variables z  f (u, v), where u  g(x, y) and v  h(x, y), we would 
naturally expect two formulas analogous to (4), since we can compute both z /x and z /y. The 
Chain Rule for functions of two variables is summarized as follows:
Theorem 9.4.1 
Chain Rule
If z  f (u, v) is differentiable and u  g(x, y) and v  h(x, y) have continuous first partial 
derivatives, then

EXAMPLE 5 
Chain Rule
If z  u2  v3 and u  e2x3y, v  sin(x 2  y 2), find z/x and z/y.
SOLUTION Since z/u  2u and z/v  3v2, it follows from (5) that
0z
0x  2u(2e2x3y)  3v2[2x cos(x 2  y2)]  4ue2x3y  6xv2 cos(x 2  y2) 
(6)
0z
0y  2u(3e2x3y)  3v2[(2y) cos(x2  y2)]  6ue2x3y  6yv2 cos(x2  y2). (7)
Of course, in Example 5 we could substitute the expressions for u and v in the original func-
tion and then find the partial derivatives directly. In the same manner, the answers (6) and (7) 
can be expressed in terms of x and y.
 Special Case If z  f (u, v) is differentiable and u  g(t) and v  h(t) are differentiable 
functions of a single variable t, then Theorem 9.4.1 implies that the ordinary derivative dz/dt is
 
dz
dt 5 0z
0u du
dt 1 0z
0v dv

(8)
 Generalizations The results given in (5) and (8) immediately generalize to any number 
of variables. If z  f (u1, u2, . . . , un) and each of the variables u1, u2, u3, . . . , un are functions of 
x1, x2, . . . , xk, then under the same assumptions as in Theorem 9.4.1 we have

where i  1, 2, . . . , k. Similarly, if the ui, i  1, . . . , n, are differentiable functions of a single 
variable t, then

 Tree Diagrams The results in (5) can be memorized in terms of a tree diagram. The dots 
in the first diagram in FIGURE 9.4.5(a) indicate the fact that z depends on u and v; u and v depend, in 
turn, on x and y. To compute z /x for example, we read the diagram vertically downward starting 
from z and following the two blue polygonal paths leading to x, multiply the partial derivatives 
on each path, and then add the products. The result given in (8) is represented by the second tree 
diagram in Figure 9.4.5(b).
We shall use tree diagrams in the next two examples to illustrate special cases of (9) and (10).

9.5 Directional Derivative
INTRODUCTION We saw in the last section that for a function f of two variables x and y, 
the partial derivatives z/x and z/y give the slope of the tangent to the trace, or curve of in-
tersection of the surface defined by z  f (x, y) and vertical planes that are, respectively, parallel 
to the x- and y-coordinates axes. Equivalently, we can think of the partial derivative z/x as 
the rate of change of the function f in the direction given by the vector i, and z/y as the rate of 
change of the function f in the j-direction. There is no reason to confine our attention to just two 
directions. In this section we shall see how to find the rate of change of a differentiable function 
in any direction. See FIGURE 9.5.1.
 The Gradient of a Function In this and the next sections it is convenient to introduce 
a new vector based on partial differentiation. When the vector differential operator
 
= 5 i 0
0x 1 j 0

0x 1 j 0
0y 1 k 0

are the gradients of the respective functions. The symbol , an inverted capital Greek delta, is 
called “del” or “nabla.” The vector f is usually read “grad f.”
EXAMPLE 1 
Gradient
Compute f (x, y) for f (x, y)  5y  x3y2.
SOLUTION From (1), f (x, y)  0
0x (5y  x3y2)i  0
0y (5y  x3y2) j; therefore
f (x, y)  3x2y2 i  (5  2x3y) j.
EXAMPLE 2 
Gradient at a Point
If F(x, y, z)  xy 2  3x 2  z3, find F(x, y, z) at (2, 1, 4).
SOLUTION From (2), F(x, y, z)  ( y 2  6x) i  2xy j  3z2 k and so
 
F(2, 1, 4)  13 i  4 j  48 k.
 A Generalization of Partial Differentiation Suppose u  cos u i  sin u j is a unit 
vector in the xy-plane that makes an angle u with the positive x-axis and is parallel to the vector 
v from (x, y, 0) to (x   x, y  y, 0). If h  "(Dx)2  (Dy)2  0, then v  h u. Furthermore, 
let the plane perpendicular to the xy-plane that contains these points slice the surface z  f ( x, y) 
in a curve C. We ask: What is the slope of the tangent line to C at a point P with coordinates 
(x, y, f (x, y)) in the direction given by v? See FIGURE 9.5.2.
From the figure we see that x  h cos u and y  h sin u so that the slope of the indicated 
secant line is
 
f (x  Dx, y  Dy) 2 f (x, y)
h
 f (x  h cos u, y  h sin u) 2 f (x, y)

We expect the slope of the tangent at P to be the limit of (3) as h S 0. This slope is the rate of change 
of f at P in the direction specified by the unit vector u. This leads us to the following definition:
Definition 9.5.1 
Directional Derivative
The directional derivative of z  f (x, y) in the direction of a unit vector u  cos u i  sin u j is
 
Du f (x, y)  lim
hS0 f (x  h cos u, y  h sin u) 2 f (x, y)

(4)
provided the limit exists.

503
Observe that (4) is truly a generalization of partial differentiation, since
u  0   implies that Di f (x, y)  lim
hS0 f (x  h, y) 2 f (x, y)
h
 0z
0x
and 
u  p
2 implies that Dj f (x, y)  lim
hS0 f (x, y  h) 2 f (x, y)
h
 0z
0y.
 Method for Computing the Directional Derivative While (4) could be used 
to find Du f (x, y) for a given function, as usual we seek a more efficient procedure. The next 
theorem will show how the concept of the gradient of a function plays a key role in computing 
a directional derivative.
 g9(t)  f1(x  t cos u, y  t sin u) d
dt (x  t cos u)  f2(x  t cos u, y  t sin u) d
dt (x  t sin u) 
(7)
  f1(x  t cos u, y  t sin u) cos u  f2(x  t cos u, y  t sin u) sin u.
Here the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the partial derivatives of f (x  t cos u, y  t sin u) with respect 
to x  t cos u and y  t sin u, respectively. When t  0, we note that x  t cos u and y  t sin u
are simply x and y, and therefore (7) becomes
 
g	(0)  fx(x, y) cos u  fy(x, y) sin u. 
(8)
Comparing (4), (6), and (8) then gives
 
Du  f (x, y)  fx(x, y) cos u  fy(x, y) sin u
 
 [ fx(x, y) i  fy(x, y) j]  (cos u i  sin u j)
 
 f (x, y)  u.
Theorem 9.5.1 
Computing a Directional Derivative
If z  f (x, y) is a differentiable function of x and y and u  cos u i  sin u j, then
 
Du  f (x, y)  f (x, y)  u. 
(5)
PROOF: Let x, y, and u be fixed so that g(t)  f (x  t cos u, y  t sin u) is a function of one 
variable. We wish to compare the value of g	(0), which is found by two different methods. First, 
by the definition of a derivative,
 
g9(0)  lim
hS0 g(0  h) 2 g(0)
h
 lim
hS0 f (x  h cos u, y  h sin u) 2 f (x, y)

.

Second, by the Chain Rule, (8) of Section 9.4,
EXAMPLE 3 
Directional Derivative
Find the directional derivative of f (x, y)  2x2y3  6xy at (1, 1) in the direction of a unit vector 
whose angle with the positive x-axis is p/6.
SOLUTION Since 0f
0x  4xy3  6y and 0f
0y  6x 2y2  6x, we have
 
f (x, y)  (4xy3  6y) i  (6x 2y2  6x) j and f (1, 1)  10 i  12 j.
Now, at u  p/6, u  cos u i  sin u j becomes u  "3

EXAMPLE 4 
Directional Derivative
Consider the plane that is perpendicular to the xy-plane and passes through the points P(2, 1) 
and Q(3, 2). What is the slope of the tangent line to the curve of intersection of this plane with 
the surface f (x, y)  4x2  y2 at (2, 1, 17) in the direction of Q?
SOLUTION We want Du f (2, 1) in the direction given by the vector PQ
!
  i  j. But since 
PQ

 Functions of Three Variables For a function w  F(x, y, z) the directional derivative 
is defined by
 
DuF (x, y, z)  lim

,
where a, b, and g are the direction angles of the unit vector u measured relative to the positive 
x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively.* But in the same manner as before, we can show that
 
Du F(x, y, z)  F(x, y, z)  u. 
(9)
Notice that since u is a unit vector, it follows from (10) of Section 7.3 that
 
Du  f (x, y)  compuf (x, y)  and  Du F(x, y, z)  compuF(x, y, z).
In addition, (9) reveals that
 
Dk F(x, y, z)  0w
0z .
*Note that the numerator in (4) can be written f (x  h cos a, y  h cos b) – f (x, y), where b  (p/2)  a.

F( x, y, z)  ( y2  8xy) i  (2xy  4x2) j  2z k
 
F(1, 1, 2)  9 i  6 j  4 k.

 Maximum Value of the Directional Derivative Let f represent a function of either 
two or three variables. Since (5) and (9) express the directional derivative as a dot product, we 
see from (5) of Theorem 7.3.2 that
 
Du  f  if i iui cos f  if i cos f,  (iui  1),

where f is the angle between f and u. Because 0  f  p, we have 1  cos f  1 and, 
consequently, if i  Du  f  if i. In other words:
The maximum value of the directional derivative is if i and it occurs when u  
(10)
has the same direction as f (when cos f  1).
The minimum value of the directional derivative is if i and it occurs when u  
(11)
and f have opposite directions (when cos f  1).
EXAMPLE 6 
Max/Min of Directional Derivative
In Example 5 the maximum value of the directional derivative of F of (1, 1, 2) is 
iF(1, 1, 2)i  "133. The minimum value of DuF(1, 1, 2) is then  "133. 
 Gradient Points in Direction of Most Rapid Increase of f Put yet another way, 
(10) and (11) state:
The gradient vector f points in the direction in which f increases most rapidly, 
whereas f points in the direction of the most rapid decrease of  f.
EXAMPLE 7 
Direction of Steepest Ascent
Each year in Los Angeles there is a bicycle race up to the top of a hill by a road known to be 
the steepest in the city. To understand why a bicyclist with a modicum of sanity will zigzag 
up the road, let us suppose the graph of f (x, y)  4 2

where r  x i  y j is a vector pointing to the center of the circular base.
Thus the steepest ascent up the hill is a straight road whose projection in the xy-plane is a 
radius of the circular base. Since Du  f  compuf, a bicyclist will zigzag, or seek a direction 
u other than f, in order to reduce this component.
 T(x, y, z)  yz(2  y)(3  z)(1  2x)i  xz(1  x)(3  z)(2  2y)j  xy(1  x)(2  y)(3  2z)k.
Therefore, T (1

of 1

Tangent Planes and Normal Lines
INTRODUCTION The notion of the gradient of a function of two or more variables was 
introduced in the preceding section as an aid in computing directional derivatives. In this section 
we give a geometric interpretation of the gradient vector.
 Geometric Interpretation of the Gradient—Functions of Two Variables
Suppose f (x, y)  c is the level curve of the differentiable function z  f (x, y) that passes through 
a specified point P(x0, y0); that is, f (x0, y0)  c. If this level curve is parameterized by the 
 differentiable functions
 
x  g(t),  y  h(t)  such that  x0  g(t0),  y0  h(t0),
then the derivative of f (g(t), h(t))  c with respect to t is
 
0f
0x dx
dt  0f
0y dy
dt  0. 
(1)
When we introduce the vectors
 
f (x, y)   0f
0x i  0f
0y j  and  r	(t)  dx
dt  i  dy
dt  j,
(1) becomes f  r	  0. Specifically, at t  t0, we have
 
f (x0, y0)  r	(t0)  0. 
(2)
Thus, if r	(t0)  0, the vector f (x0, y0) is orthogonal to the tangent vector r	(t0) at P(x0, y0). We 
interpret this to mean:
f is orthogonal to the level curve at P.
See FIGURE 9.6.1.

EXAMPLE 1 
Gradient at a Point
Find the level curve of f (x, y)  x 2  y2 passing through (2, 3). Graph the gradient at the point.
SOLUTION Since f (2, 3)  4  9  5, the level curve is the hyperbola x 2  y2  5. Now,
 
f (x, y)  2xi  2yj  and  f (2, 3)  4 i  6 j.
FIGURE 9.6.2 shows the level curve and f (2, 3).
 Geometric Interpretation of the Gradient—Functions of Three Variables 
Proceeding as before, let F(x, y, z)  c be the level surface of a differentiable function w  F(x, y, z) 
that passes through P(x0, y0, z0). If the differentiable functions x  f (t), y  g(t), z  h(t) are the 
parametric equations of a curve C on the surface for which x0  f (t0), y0  g(t0), z0  h(t0), then 
the derivative of F(  f (t), g(t), h(t))  0 implies that
 
0F
0x dx
dt  0F
0y dy
dt  0F
0z  dz

0x i  0F
0y j  0F
0z  kb  adx
dt i  dy
dt j  dz
dt kb  0. 
(3)
In particular, at t  t0, (3) is
 
F(x0, y0, z0)  r	(t0)  0. 
(4)
Thus, when r	(t0)  0, the vector F(x0, y0, z0) is orthogonal to the tangent vector r	(t0). Since this 
argument holds for any differentiable curve through P(x0, y0, z0) on the surface, we conclude that:
 
F is normal ( perpendicular) to the level surface at P.

Definition 9.6.1 
Tangent Plane
Let P(x0, y0, z0) be a point on the graph of F(x, y, z)  c, where F is not 0. The tangent plane
at P is that plane through P that is normal to F evaluated at P.
Thus, if P(x, y, z) and P(x0, y0, z0) are points on the tangent plane and r and r0 are their respective 
position vectors, then a vector equation of the tangent plane is F(x0, y0, z0)  (r  r0)  0. See 
FIGURE 9.6.5. We summarize this last result:
Theorem 9.6.1 
Equation of Tangent Plane
Let P(x0, y0, z0) be a point on the graph of F(x, y, z)  c, where F is not 0. Then an equation 
of the tangent plane at P is
 
Fx(x0, y0, z0)(x  x0)  Fy(x0, y0, z0)( y  y0)  Fz(x0, y0, z0)(z  z0)  0.

EXAMPLE 2 
Gradient at a Point
Find the level surface of F(x, y, z)  x 2  y2  z2 passing through (1, 1, 1). Graph the 
 gradient at the point.
SOLUTION Since F(1, 1, 1)  3, the level surface passing through (1, 1, 1) is the sphere 
x2  y2  z2  3. The gradient of the function is
 
F(x, y, z)  2x i  2y j  2z k,
and so, at the given point, F(1, 1, 1)  2 i  2 j  2 k. The level surface and F(1, 1, 1) are 
illustrated in FIGURE 9.6.4.
 Tangent Plane In the study of differential calculus a basic problem was finding an equa-
tion of a tangent line to the graph of a function. In 3-space the analogous problem is finding an 
equation of a tangent plane to a surface. We assume again that w  F(x, y, z) is a differentiable 
function and that a surface is given by F(x, y, z)  c.
EXAMPLE 3 
Equation of Tangent Plane
Find an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of x 2  4y2  z 2  16 at (2, 1, 4).
SOLUTION By defining F(x, y, z)  x2  4y2  z2, the given surface is the level surface 
F(x, y, z)  F(2, 1, 4)  16 passing through (2, 1, 4). Now, Fx(x, y, z)  2x, Fy(x, y, z)  8y, 
and Fz(x, y, z)  2z, so that
 
F(x, y, z)  2x i  8y j  2z k  and  F(2, 1, 4)  4 i  8 j  8 k.

It follows from (5) that an equation of the tangent plane is
 
4(x  2)  8( y  1)  8(z  4)  0  or  x  2y  2z  8.
 Surfaces Given by z  f (x, y ) For a surface given explicitly by a differentiable 
function z  f (x, y), we define F(x, y, z)  f (x, y)  z or F(x, y, z)  z  f (x, y). Thus, a point 
(x0, y0, z0) is on the graph of z  f (x, y) if and only if it is also on the level surface F(x, y, z)  0. 
This follows from F(x0, y0, z0)  f (x0, y0)  z0  0.

Equation of Tangent Plane
Find an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of z  1
2 x2  1
2 y2  4 at (1, 1, 5).
SOLUTION Define F(x, y, z)  1
2 x2  1
2 y2  z  4 so that the level surface of F passing 
through the given point is F(x, y, z)  F(1, 1, 5) or F(x, y, z)  0. Now, Fx  x, Fy  y, 
and Fz  1, so that
 
F(x, y, z)  x i  y j  k  and  F(1, 1, 5)  i  j  k.
Thus, from (5) the desired equation is
 
(x  1)  ( y  1)  (z  5)  0  or  x  y  z  7.
See FIGURE 9.6.6.
 Normal Line Let P(x0, y0, z0) be a point on the graph of F(x, y, z)  c, where F is 
not 0. The line containing P(x0, y0, z0) that is parallel to F(x0, y0, z0) is called the normal 
line to the surface at P. As indicated by its name, this line is normal to the tangent plane to 
the surface at P.
EXAMPLE 5 
Normal Line to a Surface
Find parametric equations for the normal line to the surface in Example 4 at (1, 1, 5).
SOLUTION A direction vector for the normal line at (1, 1, 5) is F(1, 1, 5)  i  j  k. 
It follows that parametric equations for the normal line are 
 
x  1  t, y  1  t, z  5  t.
Expressed as symmetric equations the normal line to a surface F (x, y, z) = c at P(x0, y0, z0) 
is given by
 
x 2 x0
Fx(x0, y0, z0) 
y 2 y0
Fy(x0, y0, z0)   
z 2 z0
Fz(x0, y0, z0).
In Example 5, you should verify that symmetric equations of the normal line at (1, 1, 5) 
are

INTRODUCTION In Section 9.1 we introduced the concept of vector function of one variable. 
In this section we examine vector functions of two and three variables.

are also called vector fields. For example, the motion of a wind or a fluid can be described by 
means of a velocity field because a vector can be assigned at each point representing the veloc-
ity of a particle at the point. See FIGURE 9.7.1(a) and 9.7.1(b). The concept of a force field plays 
an important role in mechanics, electricity, and magnetism. See Figure 9.7.1(c) and 9.7.1(d).

EXAMPLE 1 
Two-Dimensional Vector Field
Graph the two-dimensional vector field F(x, y)  y i  x j.
SOLUTION One manner of proceeding is simply to choose points in the xy-plane and then graph 
the vector F at that point. For example, at (1, 1) we would draw the vector F(1, 1)  i  j.
For the given vector field it is possible to systematically draw vectors of the same length. 
Observe that iFi  "x2  y2, and so vectors of the same length k must lie along the curve 
defined by "x2  y2  k; that is, at any point on the circle x 2  y2  k2 a vector would 
have length k. For simplicity let us choose circles that have some points on them with integer 
coordinates. For example, for k  1, k  "2, and k  2, we have:
x2  y2  1: At the points (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1) the corresponding vectors 
j, i, j, i have the same length 1.
x2  y2  2: At the points (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1) the corresponding 
vectors i  j, i  j, i  j, i  j have the same length "2.
x2  y2  4: At the points (2, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0), (0, 2) the corresponding vectors 
2 j, 2 i, 2 j, 2 i have the same length 2.
The vectors at these points are shown in FIGURE 9.7.2.
In Section 9.5 we saw that the del operator
 
=  0
0x i  0
0y j  0
0z k
combined with a scalar function f(x, y, z) produces a vector field
 
F(x, y, z)  =f  0f
0x  i  0f
0y  j  0f
0z  k
called the gradient of f or a gradient field. The del operator can also be combined with a vector 
field F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z) i  Q(x, y, z) j  R(x, y, z) k in two different ways: in one case produc-
ing another vector field and in the other producing a scalar function. We will assume hereafter 
that P, Q, and R have continuous partial derivatives.

There is another combination of partial derivatives of the component functions of a vector field 
that occurs frequently in science and engineering. Before we state the next definition, consider 
the following motivation.
If F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z) i  Q(x, y, z) j  R(x, y, z) k is the velocity field of a fluid, then as 
shown in FIGURE 9.7.3, the volume of the fluid flowing through an element of surface area 
S 
per unit time—that is, the flux of the vector field F through the area 
S—is approximated by
 
(height)(area of base)  (compn F) 
S  (F  n) 
S, 
(2)
where n is a unit vector normal to the surface. Now consider the rectangular parallelepiped shown 
in FIGURE 9.7.4. To compute the total flux of F through its six sides in the outward direction we 
first compute the total flux out of parallel faces. The area of face F1 is 
x 
z and its outward unit 
normal is j, and so by (2) the flux of F through F1 is approximately
 
F  (j) 
x 
z  Q(x, y, z) 
x 
z.
The flux out of face F2, whose outward normal is j, is approximated by
 
(F  j) 
x 
z  Q(x, y  
y, z) 
x 
z.
Consequently the total flux out of these parallel faces is
 
Q(x, y  
y, z) 
x 
z  (Q(x, y, z) 
x 
z)  [Q(x, y  
y, z)  Q(x, y, z)] 
x 
z. 
(3)
By multiplying (3) by 
y/
y and recalling the definition of a partial derivative, we get for 

y close to 0,
 
Q(x, y  Dy, z) 2 Q(x, y, z)
Dy
 Dx Dy Dz < 0Q
0y  Dx Dy Dz.
Arguing in exactly the same manner, we see that the contributions to the total flux out of the 
parallelepiped from the two faces parallel to the yz-plane, and from the two faces parallel to the 
xy-plane, are, in turn,
 
0P
0x Dx Dy Dz and 0R
0z  Dx Dy Dz.
Adding the results, we see that the net flux of F out of the parallelepiped is approxi mately
 
a 0P
0x  0Q
0y  0R
0z b Dx Dy Dz.

It is this combination of partial derivatives that is given a special name.

We ask you to prove the following two important properties. If f is a scalar function with 
continuous second partial derivatives, then
 
curl(grad f  )    f  0.

 Physical Interpretations The word curl was introduced by James Clerk Maxwell 
(1831–1879), a Scottish physicist, in his studies of electromagnetic fields. However, the curl 
is easily understood in connection with the flow of fluids. If a paddle device, such as shown 
in FIGURE 9.7.5, is inserted in a flowing fluid, then the curl of the velocity field F is a measure 
of the tendency of the fluid to turn the device about its vertical axis w. If curl F  0, then the 
flow of the fluid is said to be irrotational, which means that it is free of vortices or whirlpools 
that would cause the paddle to rotate.* In FIGURE 9.7.6 the axis w of the paddle points straight 
out of the page.

In the motivational discussion leading to Definition 9.7.2 we saw that the divergence of a 
velocity field F near a point P(x, y, z) is the flux per unit volume. If div F(P)  0, then P is said 
to be a source for F, since there is a net outward flow of fluid near P; if div F(P)  0, then P is 
said to be a sink for F, since there is a net inward flow of fluid near P; if div F(P)  0, there are 
no sources or sinks near P. See FIGURE 9.7.7.
The divergence of a vector field can also be interpreted as a measure of the rate of change of 
the density of the fluid at a point. In other words, div F is a measure of the fluid’s compressibility. 
If   F  0, the fluid is said to be incompressible. In electromagnetic theory, if   F  0, the 
vector field F is said to be solenoidal.

Line Integrals
INTRODUCTION The notion of the definite integral b
a f (x)  dx; that is, integration of a 
function defined over an interval, can be generalized to integration of a function defined along 
a curve. To this end we need to introduce some terminology about curves.
 Terminology Suppose C is a curve parameterized by x  f (t), y  g(t), a  t  b, and A 
and B are the points (  f (a), g(a)) and (  f (b), g(b)), respectively. We say that
 (i) 
 C is a smooth curve if f 	 and g	 are continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and not 
 simultaneously zero on the open interval (a, b).
 (ii)  C is piecewise smooth if it consists of a finite number of smooth curves 
C1, C2, . . . , Cn joined end to end—that is, C  C1 ´ C2 ´ p ´ Cn.
 (iii) C is a closed curve if A  B.
 (iv) C is a simple closed curve if A  B and the curve does not cross itself.
 (v)  If C is not a closed curve, then the positive direction on C is the direction corresponding 
to increasing values of t.
FIGURE 9.8.1 illustrates each type of curve defined in (i)(iv).
This same terminology carries over in a natural manner to curves in space. For example, a 
curve C defined by x  f (t), y  g(t), z  h(t), a  t  b, is smooth if f 	, g	, and h	 are continu-
ous on [a, b] and not simultaneously zero on (a, b).
 Definite Integral Before defining integration along a curve, let us review the five steps 
leading to the definition of the definite integral.
 1. Let y  f (x) be defined on a closed interval [a, b].
 2. Partition the interval [a, b] into n subintervals [xk1, xk] of lengths 
xk  xk  xk1. Let P 
denote the partition shown in FIGURE 9.8.2(a).
 3. Let iPi be the length of the longest subinterval. The number iPi is called the norm of the 
partition P.
 4. Choose a sample point x*
k in each subinterval. See Figure 9.8.2(b).
 5. Form the sum a
n
k1
  f (x*

The definite integral of a function of a single variable is given by the limit of a sum:
 
#

f (x) dx  lim

k1
 f (x*

 Line Integrals in the Plane The following analogous five steps lead to the definitions 
of three line integrals* in the plane.
 1. Let z  G (x, y) be defined in some region that contains the smooth curve C 
defined by x  f (t), y  g(t), a  t  b.
 2. Divide C into n subarcs of lengths 
sk according to the partition 
 
 a  t0 t1  t 2  . . .   tn  b of [a, b]. Let the projection of each subarc 
onto the x- and y-axes have lengths 
xk and 
yk, respectively.
 3. Let iPi be the norm of the partition or the length of the longest subarc.
 4. Choose a sample point (x*
k, y*
k) on each subarc. See FIGURE 9.8.3.

It can be proved that if G(x, y) is continuous on C, then the integrals defined in (i), (ii), and 
(iii) exist. We shall assume continuity of G as a matter of course.
 Method of Evaluation—Curve Defined Parametrically The line integrals in 
Definition 9.8.1 can be evaluated in two ways, depending on whether the curve C is defined 
parametrically or by an explicit function. In either case the basic idea is to convert the line inte-
gral to a definite integral in a single variable. If C is a smooth curve parameterized by x  f (t), 
y  g(t), a  t  b, then we simply replace x and y in the integral by the functions f (t) and g(t), 
and the appropriate differential dx, dy, or ds by f 	(t) dt, g	(t) dt, or "f f 9(t)g2  fg9(t)g2 dt. The 
expression ds  "f f 9(t)g2  fg9(t)g2 dt is called the differential of arc length. The integration 
is carried out with respect to the variable t in the usual manner:

A line integral along a piecewise-smooth curve C is defined as the sum of the integrals over 
the various smooth curves whose union comprises C. For example, if C is composed of smooth 
curves C1 and C2, then

where C1, C2, and C3 are the curves shown in Figure 9.8.6(b). On C1, we use x as a  parameter.

It is important to be aware that a line integral is independent of the parameterization of the 
curve C provided C is given the same orientation by all sets of parametric equations defining the 
curve. See Problem 37 in Exercises 9.8. Also, recall for definite integrals that a

b

denotes the curve having the opposite orientation of C. Then it can be shown that

or equivalently,

For example, in part (a) of Example 1, C xy2 dx  64.
 Line Integrals in Space Line integrals of a function G of three variables, C G(x, y, z) dx, 
C G(x, y, z) dy, and C G(x, y, z) ds, are defined in a manner analogous to Definition 9.8.1. 
However, to that list we add a fourth line integral along a space curve C with respect to z:

 Method of Evaluation If C is a smooth curve in 3-space defined by the parametric 
equations x  f (t), y  g(t), z  h(t), a  t  b, then the integral in (9) can be evaluated by using
 
#

G( f (t), g(t), h(t)) h9(t) dt.
The integrals C G(x, y, z) dx and C G(x, y, z) dy are evaluated in a similar fashion. The line

9.8 Line Integrals 
| 521
We can use the concept of a vector function of several variables to write a general line integral in 
a compact fashion. For example, suppose the vector-valued function F(x, y)  P(x, y) i  Q(x, y) j 
is defined along a curve C: x  f (t), y  g(t), a  t  b, and suppose r(t)  f (t) i  g(t) j is the 
position vector of points on C. Then the derivative of r(t),
 
dr
dt  f 9(t) i  g9(t) j  dx
dt i  dy
dt j,
prompts us to define dr  dr
dt  dt  dx i  dy j. Since F(x, y)  dr  P(x, y) dx  Q(x, y) dy 
we can write
 
#
C
P(x, y) dx  Q(x, y) dy #
C
F  dr. 
(10)
Similarly, for a line integral on a space curve,
 
#
C
P(x, y, z) dx  Q(x, y, z) dy  R(x, y, z) dz  #
C
F  d r, 
(11)
where F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z) i  Q(x, y, z) j  R(x, y, z) k and dr  dx i  dy j  dz k.
 Work In Section 7.3 we saw that the work W done by a constant force F that causes a 
straight-line displacement d of an object is W  F  d. In beginning courses in calculus or phys-
ics it is then shown that the work done in moving an object from x  a to x  b by a force F(x), 
which varies in magnitude but not in direction, is given by the definite integral W  b
a F(x) dx. 
In general, a force field F(x, y)  P(x, y) i  Q(x, y) j acting at each point on a smooth curve 
C: x  f (t), y  g(t), a  t  b, varies in both magnitude and direction. See FIGURE 9.8.8(a). If A 
and B are the points (  f  (a), g(a)) and (  f  (b), g(b)), respectively, we ask: What is the work done 
by F as its point of application moves along C from A to B ? To answer this question, suppose C 
is divided into n subarcs of lengths 
 sk. On each subarc F(x*
k, y*
k ) is a constant force. If, as shown 
in Figure 9.8.8(b), the length of the vector 
rk  (xk  xk1)i  (yk  yk1)j  
xki  
yk  j is 
an approximation to the length of the kth subarc, then the approximate work done by F over the 
subarc is
 
 AiF(x*
k, y*
k)i cos uB iDrki  F(x*
k, y*
k )  Drk
 
  P(x*
k, y*
k ) Dxk  Q(x*
k, y*
k ) Dyk.
By summing these elements of work and passing to the limit, we naturally define the work done 
by F along C as the line integral
 
W  #
C
P(x, y) dx  Q(x, y) dy or W  #
C
F dr. 
(12)
Of course, (12) extends to force fields acting at points on a space curve. In this case, work C F  dr 
is defined as in (11).
Now, since 
dr

we let dr  T ds, where T  dr/ds is a unit tangent to C. Hence,
 
W  #

(13)
In other words:
 The work done by a force F along a curve C is due entirely to the tangential component of F.

SOLUTION (a) The vector function r(t) gives the parametric equations x  cos t, y  sin t, 
0  t  p, which we recognize as a half-circle. As seen in FIGURE 9.8.9, the force field F is 
perpendicular to C at every point. Since the tangential components of F are zero, the work 
done along C is zero. To see this we use (12):

The units of work depend on the units of iF i and on the units of distance.
 Circulation A line integral of a vector field F around a simple closed curve C is said to 
be the circulation of F around C; that is,
 
circulation  BC
F  dr  BC
F  T ds.
In particular, if F is the velocity field of a fluid, then the circulation is a measure of the amount 
by which the fluid tends to turn the curve C by rotating, or circulating, around it. For example, if 
F is perpendicular to T for every (x, y) on C, then C F  T ds  0, and the curve does not move 
at all. On the other hand, C F  T ds  0 and C F  T ds  0 mean that the fluid tends to rotate C 
in the counterclockwise and clockwise directions, respectively. See FIGURE 9.8.11.
REMARKS
In the case of two variables, the line integral with respect to arc length C G(x, y) ds can be 
interpreted in a geometric manner when G(x, y)  0 on C. In Definition 9.8.1 the symbol 
sk 
represents the length of the kth subarc on the curve C. But from Figure 9.8.3 accompanying 
that definition, we have the approximation 
sk  "(Dxk)2  (Dyk)2. With this interpreta-
tion of 
sk we see from FIGURE 9.8.12(a) that the product G(x*
k, y*
k ) 
sk is the area of a vertical 
rectangle of height G(x*
k, y*
k ) and width 
sk. The integral C G(x, y) ds then represents the area 
of one side of a “fence” or “curtain” extending from the curve C in the xy-plane up to the 
graph of G(x, y) that corresponds to points (x, y) on C. See Figure 9.8.12(b).

9.9 Independence of the Path
INTRODUCTION In this section we refer to a piecewise-smooth curve C between an initial 
point A and a terminal point B as a path of integration or simply a path. We begin the dis-
cussion by considering line integrals in 2-space. Recall, in (10) of Section 9.8 we saw that if 
F(x, y) = P(x, y)i  Q(x, y)j is a vector field in 2-space and a path C is defined by the vector 
function r(t)  f (t)i  g(t)j, a # t # b, then a line integral can be written as
 
#C P dx 1 Q dy 5 #C F  dr,
where dr  dx i  dy j. Generally the value of a line integral eC  F  dr depends on the path of inte-
gration. Stated another way, if C1 and C2 are two different paths between the same points A and B,

9.9 Independence of the Path 
|
525
then we expect that eC1  F  dr  eC2  F  dr. However, there is an important exception. As we see 
in this section, line integrals that involve a certain kind of vector field F depend not on the path C 
but only on the endpoints A  ( f (a), g(a)) and B  ( f (b), g(b)) of the path.
Note: To avoid needless repetition we assume throughout that the component functions of 
the vector field F are continuous in some region of 2- or 3-space, its component functions have 
continuous first partial derivatives in the region, and the path C of integration lies entirely in 
the region.
EXAMPLE 1 
Path Independence
The integral eC y dx  x dy has the same value on each path C between (0, 0) and (1, 1) shown 
in FIGURE 9.9.1. You may recall from Problems 11–14 in Exercises 9.8 that on these paths
 
#C
y dx  x dy  1.
You are also urged to verify eC y dx  x dy  1 on the curves y 5 x3,  y 5 x4, and y  "x
between (0, 0) and between (1, 1). The relevance of all this is to suggest that the integral 
eC y dx  x dy does not depend on the path joining these two points. We continue this dis-
cussion in Examples 2 and 3.

 Conservative Vector Fields Before proceeding, we need to introduce a special kind 
of vector field F called a conservative field.
Definition 9.9.1 
Conservative Vector Field
A vector function F in 2- or 3-space is said to be conservative if F can be written as the 
gradient of a scalar function f. The function f is called a potential function for F.
In other words, F is conservative if there exists a function f such that F 5 =f. A conserva-
tive vector field is also called a gradient vector field.
EXAMPLE 2 
Conservative Vector Field
The integral in Example 1 can be interpreted as a line integral of a vector field F along a path C. 
If F(x, y)  y i  x j and dr  dx i  dy j, then eC y dx  x dy  eC F dr.  Now consider the 
function f(x, y)  xy. The gradient of the scalar function f is
 
=f  0f
0x
  i  0f
0y
  j  y i  x j.
Because =f  F(x, y) we conclude that F(x, y)  y i  x j is a conservative vector field and 
that f is a potential function for F.
Of course, not every vector field is a conservative field although many vector fields encoun-
tered in physics are conservative. For present purposes, the importance of conservative vector 
fields will become evident as we continue our study of line integrals.

526 
| CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
 Path Independence If the value of a line integral is the same for every path in a region 
connecting the initial point A and terminal point B, then the integral is said to be independent 
of the path. In other words, a line integral eC F dr of F along C is independent of the path if 
eC1 F dr  eC2 F dr for any two paths C1 and C2 between A and B.
 A Fundamental Theorem The next theorem establishes an important relationship 
between the value of a line integral eC F dr and the fact that its path of integration C lies within 
a conservative vector field F. In addition, it provides a means of evaluating these line integrals 
in a manner that is akin to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
 
#
b
a
f 9(x) dx  f (b) 2 f (a), 
(1)
where f (x) is an antiderivative of f 9(x). In the next theorem, known as the Fundamental Theorem 
for Line Integrals, the gradient =f of a scalar function f plays the part of the derivative f 9(x) 
in (1).
Theorem 9.9.1 
Fundamental Theorem
Suppose C is a path in an open region R of the xy-plane and is defined by r(t)  x(t)i  y(t)j, 
a # t # b. If F(x, y)  P(x, y)i + Q(x, y)j is a conservative vector field in R and f is a potential 
function for F, then
 
#C
F dr  #C
=f  dr  f(B) 2 f(A), 
(2)
where A  (x (a), y (a)) and B  (x (b), y (b)).
PROOF: We will prove the theorem for a smooth path C. Because f is a potential function for F 
we have
 
F 5 =f 5 0f
0x
 i 1 0f
0y
 j.
Then using r9(t)  (dx>dt)i  (dy>dt)j we can write the line integral of F along the path C as

F r9(t) dt  #

In view of the Chain Rule (see (8) in Section 9.4),

it follows that

9.9 Independence of the Path

527
For piecewise-smooth curves, the foregoing proof must be modified by considering each 
smooth arc of the curve C.
Theorem 9.9.1 shows that if F is a conservative vector field in an open region in 2- or 3-space, 
then eC F dr depends only on the initial and terminal points A and B of the path C, and not on 
C itself. In other words, line integrals of conservative vector fields are independent of the path. 
Such integrals are often written

EXAMPLE 3 
Example 1 Revisited Again
Evaluate eC y dx 1 x dy, where C is a path with initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (1, 1).
SOLUTION The path C shown in FIGURE 9.9.2 represents any piecewise-smooth curve with 
initial and terminal points (0, 0) and (1, 1). We have just seen that F  yi  xj is a conservative 
vector field defined at each point of the xy-plane and that f(x, y)  xy is a potential function 
for F. Thus, in view of (2) of Theorem 9.9.1 and (3), we can write
 
#C
y dx  x dy  #
(1, 1)
(0, 0)
F dr  #

(0, 0)
=f  dr

5 1 1 2 0 0 5 1.
In using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (1), any antiderivative of f 9(x) can be used, 
such as f (x)  K, where K is a constant. Similarly, a potential function for the vector field in 
Example 2 is f(x, y)  xy  K where K is a constant. We may disregard this constant when 
using (2) of Theorem 9.9.1 since
 
#
B
A
F dr  (f(B)  K) 2 (f(A)  K)  f(B) 2 f(A).
 Some Terminology We say that a region (in the plane or in space) is connected if every 
pair of points A and B in the region can be joined by a piecewise-smooth curve that lies entirely in 
the region. A region R in the plane is simply connected if it is connected and every simple closed 
curve C lying entirely within the region can be shrunk, or contracted, to a point without leaving R. 
The last condition means that if C is any simple closed curve lying entirely in R, then the region 
in the interior of C also lies entirely in R. Roughly put, a simply connected region has no holes 
in it. The region R in FIGURE 9.9.3(a) is a simply connected region. In Figure 9.9.3(b) the region R 
shown is not connected, or disconnected, since A and B cannot be joined by a piecewise-smooth 
curve C that lies in R. The region in Figure 9.9.3(c) is connected but not simply connected because 
it has three holes in it. The representative curve C in the figure surrounds one of the holes, and 
so cannot be shrunk to a point without leaving the region. This last region is said to be multiply 
connected. Lastly, a region R is said to be open if it contains no boundary points.
In an open connected region R, the notions of path independence and a conservative vector 
field are equivalent. This means: If F is conservative in R, then eC F  dr is independent of the 
path C, and conversely, if eC F  dr is independent of the path, then F is conservative.
We state this formally in the next theorem.

Theorem 9.9.2 
Equivalent Concepts
In an open connected region R, eC F dr is independent of the path C if and only if the vector 
field F is conservative in R.

528 
| CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
PROOF: If F is conservative in R, then we have already seen that eC F dr is independent of the 
path C as a consequence of Theorem 9.9.1.
For convenience we prove the converse for a region R in the plane. Assume that eC F dr is 
independent of the path in R and that (x0, y0) and (x, y) are arbitrary points in the region R. Let 
the function f(x, y) be defined as
 
f(x, y)  #
(x, y)
(x0, y0)
F dr,
where C is an arbitrary path in R from (x0, y0) to (x, y) and F  P i  Q j. See FIGURE 9.9.4(a). Now 
choose a point (x1, y), x1  x, so that the line segment from (x1, y) to (x, y) is in R. See Figure 
9.9.4(b). Then by path independence we can write
 
f(x, y)  #
(x1, y)
(x0, y0)
F dr  #
(x, y)
(x1, y)
F dr.
Now,
 
0f
0x  0  0
0x#
(x, y)
(x1, y)
P dx  Q dy
since the first integral does not depend on x. But on the line segment between (x1, y) and (x, y), 
y is constant so that dy  0. Hence, e
(x, y)
(x1, y) P dx  Q dy  e
(x, y)
(x1, y) P dx. By the derivative form of 
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we then have
 
0f
0x  0
0x#
(x, y)
(x1, y)
P(x, y) dx  P(x, y).
Likewise we can show that 0f>0y  Q(x, y). Hence, from
 
=f  0f
0x
 i  0f
0y
 j  P i  Q j  F(x, y)
we conclude that F is conservative.
 Integrals Around Closed Paths Recall from Section 9.8 that a path, or curve, C is said 
to be closed when its initial point A is the same as the terminal point B. If C is a parametric curve 
defined by a vector function r(t), a # t # b, then C is closed when A  B; that is, r(a)  r(b). 
The next theorem is an immediate consequence of Theorem 9.9.1.

Theorem 9.9.3 
Equivalent Concepts
In an open connected region R, eC F  dr is independent of the path if and only if eC F  dr 5 0 
for every closed path C in R.
PROOF: First, we show that if eC F  dr is independent of the path, then eC F  dr 5 0 for 
every closed path C in R. To see this let us suppose A and B are any two points on C and that 
C  C1 ´ C2, where C1 is a path from A to B and C2 is a path from B to A. See FIGURE 9.9.5(a). 
Then
 
#C
F  dr 5 #C1
F  dr 1 #C2
F  dr 5 #C1
F  dr 2 #2C2
F  dr, 
(4)
where C2 is now a path from A to B. Because of path independence eC1 F  dr 5 e2C2 F  dr. 
Thus (4) implies that eC F  dr 5 0.

9.9 Independence of the Path 
|
529
Next, we prove the converse that if eC F  dr 5 0 for every closed path C in R, then eC F dr is 
independent of the path. Let C1 and C2 represent any two paths from A to B and so C  C1 ´ (C2 )
is a closed path. See Figure 9.9.5(b). It follows from eC F dr 5 0 or
0 5 #C F  dr 5 #C1
F  dr 1 #2C2
F  dr 5 #C1
F  dr 2 #C2
F  dr
that eC1 F dr 5 eC2 F dr. Hence eC F dr is independent of the path.
Suppose F is a conservative vector field defined over an open connected region and C is 
a closed path lying entirely in the region. When the results of the preceding theorems are put 
together we conclude that:
 
F conservative 3 path independence 3#C
F dr  0. 
(5)
The symbol 3 in (5) is read “equivalent to” or “if and only if.”
 Test for a Conservative Field The implications in (5) show that if the line integral 
eC F dr is not path independent, then the vector field is not conservative. But there is an easier 
way of determining whether F is conservative. The following theorem is a test for a conserva-
tive vector field that uses the partial derivatives of the component functions of F  P i  Q j.
Theorem 9.9.4 
Test for a Conservative Field
Suppose F(x, y)  P(x, y)i  Q(x, y)j is a conservative vector field in an open region R, and 
that P and Q are continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in R. Then
0P
0y  0Q
0x  
(6)
for all (x, y) in R. Conversely, if the equality (6) holds for all (x, y) in a simply connected region 
R, then F  P i  Q j is conservative in R.
PARTIAL PROOF: We prove the first half of the theorem. Assume that the component func-
tions of the conservative vector field F  P i  Q j are continuous and have continuous first 
partial derivatives in an open region R. Since F is conservative there exists a potential function 
f such that
 
F 5 P i 1 Q j 5 =f 5 0f
0x
 i 1 0f
0y
 j.
Thus P 5 0f>0x and Q 5 0f>0y. Now
 
0P
0y 5 0
0y
 a 0f
0x b 5 02f
0y0x  and  0Q
0x 5 0
0x
 a 0f
0y b 5 02f
0x0y.
From continuity of the partial derivatives we have 0P>0y 5 0Q>0x as was to be shown.
EXAMPLE 4 
Using Theorem 9.9.4
The conservative vector field F(x, y)  yi  xj in Example 2 is continuous and has com-
ponent functions that have continuous first partial derivatives throughout the open region R 
consisting of the entire xy-plane. With the identifications P  y and Q  x it follows from 
(6) of Theorem 9.9.4,
 
0P

SOLUTION With P  yexy and Q  xexy, we find
 
0P
0y  xyexy 2 exy  0Q
0x .
The components of F are continuous and have continuous partial derivatives. Thus (6) 
holds throughout the xy-plane, which is a simply connected region. From the converse in 
Theorem 9.9.4 we can conclude that F is conservative.
We have one more important question to answer in this section:
 
If F is a conservative vector field, how does one find a potential function f for F? 
(7)
In the next example we give the answer to the question posed in (7).
EXAMPLE 7 
Integral That Is Path Independent
(a) Show that eC F dr, where F(x, y)  (y2 2 6xy  6)i  (2xy 2 3x2 2 2y)j, is 
 independent of the path C between (1, 0) and (3, 4).
(b) Find a potential function f for F.
(c) Evaluate #
(3, 4)
(21, 0 )
F dr.
SOLUTION (a) Identifying P  y2 2 6xy  6 and Q  2xy 2 3x2 2 2y yields
 
0P
0y  2y 2 6x  0Q
0x .
The vector field F is conservative because (6) holds throughout the xy-plane and as a conse-
quence the integral eC F dr is independent of the path between any two points A and B in the 
plane.
(b) Because F is conservative there is a potential function f such that
 
0f
0x  y2 2 6xy  6 and 0f
0y  2xy 2 3x2 2 2y. 
(8)
Employing partial integration on the first expression in (8) gives
 
f  #( y2 2 6xy  6) dx  xy2 2 3x2y  6x  g(y), 
(9)
where g(y) is the “constant” of integration. Now we take the partial derivative of (9) with 
respect to y and equate it to the second expression in (8):
 
0f
0y  2xy 2 3x2  g9(y)  2xy 2 3x2 2 2y.
In partial integration with 
respect to x, the variable 
y is treated as a constant. 
Similarly, in partial inte-
gration with respect to y 
we treat x as a constant.

 
9.9 Independence of the Path 
| 531
From the last equality we find g9(y)  2y. Integrating again gives g(y)  y2  C, where 
C is a constant. Thus
 
f  xy2 2 3x2y  6x 2 y2  C. 
(10)
(c) We can now use Theorem 9.9.2 and the potential function (10) (without the constant) to 
evaluate the line integral:
 
#C
F dr  #
(3, 4)
(1, 0)
F dr  (xy2 2 3x2y  6x 2 y2)d
(3, 4)
(1, 0)
 
 (48 2 108  18 2 16) 2 (6)  52.
Note: Since the integral in Example 7 was shown to be independent of the path in part (a), 
we can evaluate it without finding a potential function. We can integrate along any convenient 
curve C connecting the given points. In particular, the line y  x  1 is such a curve. Using x 
as a parameter then gives
 #C
F dr  #C
(y2 2 6xy  6) dx  (2xy 2 3x2 2 2y) dy
  #

 Conservative Vector Fields in 3-Space For a three-dimensional conservative vec-
tor field
 
F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z)i  Q(x, y, z)j  R(x, y, z)k
and a piecewise-smooth space curve r(t)  x(t)i  y(t)j  z(t)k,  a # t # b, the basic form of 
(2) is the same:
 
#C
F dr  #C
=f  dr  f(x(b), y(b), z(b)) 2 f(x(a), y(a), z(a))  f(B) 2 f(A). 
(11)
If C is a space curve, a line integral eC F dr is independent of the path whenever the three-
dimensional vector field
 
F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z) i  Q(x, y, z) j  R(x, y, z) k
is conservative. The three-dimensional analogue of Theorem 9.9.4 goes like this: If F is conser-
vative and P, Q, and R are continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in some open 
region of 3-space, then
 
0P
0y  0Q
0x , 0P
0z  0R
0x, 0Q
0z  0R
0y . 
(12)
Conversely, if (12) holds throughout an appropriate region of 3-space, then F is conservative.
The necessity of (12) can be seen from (5) of Section 9.7. If F is conservative then F  =f 
and curl =f 5 curl F 5 0; that is
 
curl F 5 a 0R
0y 2 0Q
0z b  i 1 a 0P
0z 2 0R
0x b  j 1 a 0Q
0x 2 0P
0y b  k 5 0.
Setting the three components of the vector curl F equal to 0 yields (12).

Integral That Is Path Independent
(a) Show that the line integral
#C
(
 
y  yz) dx  (x  3z 3  xz) dy  (9yz 2  xy 2 1) dz
is independent of the path C between (1, 1, 1) to (2, 1, 4).
(b) Evaluate #
(2,1,4)
(1,1,1)

SOLUTION (a) With the identifications
F(x, y, z)  (y  yz)i  (x  3z 3  xz)j  (9yz 2  xy 2 1)k,
P  y  yz, Q  x  3z 3  xz, and R  9yz 2  xy 2 1,
we see that the equalities
0P
0y 5 1 1 z 5 0Q
0x , 0P
0z 5 y 5 0R
0x, and 0Q
0z 5 9z2 1 x 5 0R
0y
hold throughout 3-space. From (12) we conclude that F is conservative and therefore the 
integral is independent of the path.
(b) The path C shown in FIGURE 9.9.6 represents any path with initial and terminal points 
(1, 1, 1) and (2, 1, 4). To evaluate the integral we again illustrate how to find a potential func-
tion f(x, y, z) for F using partial integration.
First we know that
0f
0x 5 P, 0f
0y 5 Q, and 0f
0z 5 R.
Integrating the first of these three equations with respect to x gives
f  xy  xyz  g( y, z).
The derivative of this last expression with respect to y must then be equal to Q:
 
0f
0y  x  xz  0g
0y  x  3z 3  xz.
Hence,
 
0g
0y  3z 3 implies g  3yz 3  h(z).
Consequently, 
f  xy  xyz  3yz 3  h(z).
The partial derivative of this last expression with respect to z must now be equal to the func-
tion R:
 
0f
0z  xy  9yz 2  h9(z)  9yz 2  xy 2 1.
From this we get h9(z)  1  and h(z)  z  K. Disregarding K, we can write
 
f  xy  xyz  3yz 3 2 z. 
(13)
Finally, from (11) and the potential function (13) we obtain
#

(1, 1, 1)
( y  yz) dx  (x  3z 3  xz) dy  (9yz 2  xy 2 1) dz

9.9 Independence of the Path 
| 533
 Conservation of Energy In a conservative force field F, the work done by the force 
on a particle moving from position A to position B is the same for all paths between these points. 
Moreover, the work done by the force along a closed path is zero. See Problem 29 in Exercises 9.9. 
For this reason, such a force field is also said to be conservative. In a conservative field F the 
law of conservation of mechanical energy holds:
For a particle moving along a path in a conservative field,
kinetic energy  potential energy  constant.
See Problem 31 in Exercises 9.9.
A frictional force such as air resistance is nonconservative. Nonconservative forces are dissipa-
tive in that their action reduces kinetic energy without a corresponding increase in potential energy. 
Stated in another way, if the work done eC F dr depends on the path, then F is nonconservative.
In Problems 1–10, show that the given line integral is indepen-
dent of the path. Evaluate in two ways: (a) Find a potential func-
tion f and then use Theorem 9.9.1, and (b) Use any convenient 
path between the endpoints of the path.

Double Integrals
INTRODUCTION In Section 9.8 we gave the five steps leading to the definition of the definite 
integral b
a f (x) dx. The analogous steps that lead to the concept of the two-dimensional definite 
integral, known simply as the double integral of a function f of two variables, will be given next.
 1. Let z  f (x, y) be defined in a closed and bounded region R of 2-space.
 2. By means of a grid of vertical and horizontal lines parallel to the coordinate axes, form a 
partition P of R into n rectangular subregions Rk of areas 
Ak that lie entirely in R.
 3. Let iPi be the norm of the partition or the length of the longest diagonal of the Rk.
 4. Choose a sample point (x*
k, y*
k) in each subregion Rk. See FIGURE 9.10.1.
 5. Form the sum a

 f (x*

Thus we have the following definition:
Definition 9.10.1 
The Double Integral
Let f be a function of two variables defined on a closed region R of 2-space. Then the 
 double integral of f over R is given by

 Integrability If the limit in (1) exists, we say that f is integrable over R and that R is 
the region of integration. When f is continuous on R, then f is necessarily integrable over R.

be interpreted as the volume of a rectangular prism of height f (x*

Ak is an approximation to the volume V of the solid

exists, gives the exact volume of this solid; that is, if f is nonnegative on R, then

R  R1 ´ R2. R1 and R2 can have no points in common except possibly on their common border. 
Furthermore, Theorem 9.10.1(iii) extends to any finite number of nonoverlapping subregions 
whose union is R.
 Regions of Type I and II The region shown in FIGURE 9.10.4(a), 
 
R: a  x  b,  g1(x)  y  g2(x), 
where the boundary functions g1 and g2 are continuous, is called a region of Type I. In Figure 
9.10.4(b), the region
 
R: c  y  d,  h1( y)  x  h2( y), 
where the functions h1 and h2 are continuous, is called a region of Type II.
 Iterated Integrals Since the partial integral e
g2(x)
g1(x)  f (x, y) dy is a function of x alone, we 
may in turn integrate the resulting function now with respect to x. If f is continuous on a region 
of Type I, we define an iterated integral of f over the region by

(4)
The basic idea in (4) is to carry out successive integrations. The partial integral with respect to 
y gives a function of x, which is then integrated in the usual manner from x  a to x  b. The 
end result of both integrations will be a real number. In a similar manner, we define an iterated 
integral of a continuous function f over a region of Type II by

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
 Evaluation of Double Integrals Iterated integrals provide the means for evaluating 
a double integral R f (x, y) dA over a region of Type I or Type II or a region that can be ex-
pressed as a union of a finite number of these regions. The following result is due to the Italian 
mathematician Guido Fubini (1879–1943).
Theorem 9.10.2

Theorem 9.10.2 is the double integral analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 
While Theorem 9.10.2 is difficult to prove, we can get some intuitive feeling for its significance 
by considering volumes. Let R be a Type I region and z  f(x, y) be continuous and nonnegative 
on R. The area A of the vertical plane, as shown in FIGURE 9.10.5, is the area under the trace of the 
surface z  f(x, y) in the plane x  constant and hence is given by the partial integral
 
A(x)  #
g2 (x)
g1(x)
f (x, y) dy. 
By summing all these areas from x  a to x  b, we obtain the volume V of the solid above R 
and below the surface:
 
V  #

As an aid in reducing a double integral to an iterated integral with correct limits of integration, 
it is useful to visualize, as suggested in the foregoing discussion, the double integral as a double 
summation process. Over a Type I region the iterated integral eb
a e
g2(x)
g1(x)  f(x, y) dy dx is first a sum-
mation in the y-direction. Pictorially, this is indicated by the vertical arrow in FIGURE 9.10.7(a); 
the typical rectangle in the arrow has area dy dx. The dy placed before the dx signifies that the 
“volumes” f (x, y) dy dx of prisms built up on the rectangles are summed vertically with respect 
to y from the lower boundary curve g1 to the upper boundary curve g2. The dx following the dy 
signifies that the result of each vertical summation is then summed horizontally with respect to 
x from left (x  a) to right (x  b). Similar remarks hold for double integrals over regions of 
Type II. See Figure 9.10.7(b). Recall from (2) that when f (x, y)  1, the double integral A  R dA 
gives the area of the region. Thus, Figure 9.10.7(a) shows that e
b
a e
g2(x)
g1(x)  dy dx adds the rectangular 
areas vertically and then horizontally, whereas Figure 9.10.7(b) shows that e
d
c e
h2(y)
h1(y)  dx dy adds 
the rectangular areas horizontally and then vertically.
 Reversing the Order of Integration A problem may become easier when the order of 
integration is changed or reversed. Also, some iterated integrals that may be impossible to eval-
uate using one order of integration can perhaps be evaluated using the reverse order of integration.

 Laminas with Variable Density—Center of Mass If r is a constant density (mass 
per unit area), then the mass of the lamina coinciding with a region bounded by the graphs of 
y  f (x), the x-axis, and the lines x  a and x  b is

If a lamina corresponding to a region R has a variable density r(x, y), where r is nonnegative 
and continuous on R, then analogous to (8) we define its mass m by the double integral

are the moments of the lamina about the y- and x-axes, respectively. The center of mass is the 
point where we consider all the mass of the lamina to be concentrated. If r(x, y) is a constant, 
the center of mass is called the centroid of the lamina.
EXAMPLE 3 
Center of Mass
A lamina has the shape of the region in the first quadrant that is bounded by the graphs of y  sin x,

 Moments of Inertia The integrals Mx and My in (11) are also called the first moments
of a lamina about the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The so-called second moments of a lamina 
or moments of inertia about the x- and y-axes are, in turn, defined by the double integrals
 
Ix  6

Iy  6

A moment of inertia is the rotational equivalent of mass. For translational motion, kinetic energy 
is given by K  1
2 mv2, where m is mass and v is linear speed. The kinetic energy of a particle of 
mass m rotating at a distance r from an axis is K  1
2mv2  1
2m(rv)2  1
2(mr 2)v2  1
2Iv2, where 
I  mr2 is its moment of inertia about the axis of rotation and v is angular speed.

Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates
INTRODUCTION A double integral, which may be difficult or even impossible to evaluate in 
rectangular xy-coordinates, may become more tractable when expressed in a different coordinate 
system. In this section we examine double integrals in polar ru-coordinates.
 Polar Rectangles Suppose R is a region in the plane bounded by the graphs of the polar 
equations r  g1(u), r  g2(u), and the rays u  a, u  b, and f is a function of r and u that is 
continuous on R. In order to define the double integral of f over R, we use rays and concentric 
circles to partition the region into a grid of polar rectangles or subregions Rk. See FIGURE 9.11.1(a) 
and 9.11.1(b). The area  Ak of typical subregion Rk, shown in Figure 9.11.1(c), is the difference 
of the areas of two circular sectors:  Ak  1

 Change of Variables: Rectangular to Polar Coordinates In some instances 
a double integral eeR f (x, y) dA that is difficult or even impossible to evaluate using rectangular 
coordinates may be readily evaluated when a change of variables is used. If we assume that f is 
continuous on the region R and if R can be described in polar coordinates as 0  g1(u)  r  g2(u),

Green’s Theorem
INTRODUCTION One of the most important theorems in vector integral calculus relates 
a line integral around a piecewise-smooth simple closed curve C to a double integral over the 
region R bounded by the curve.
 Line Integrals Along Simple Closed Curves We say the positive direction around 
a simple closed curve C is that direction a point on the curve must move, or the direction a person 

 
9.12 Green’s Theorem 
| 547
must walk on C, in order to keep the region R bounded by C to the left. See FIGURE 9.12.1(a). 
Roughly, as shown in Figure 9.12.1(b) and 9.12.1(c), the positive and negative directions cor-
respond to the counterclockwise and clockwise directions, respectively. Line integrals on simple 
closed curves are written
 
BC
P (x, y) dx  Q (x, y) dy, BC
P (x, y) dx  Q (x, y) dy, BC
F(x, y) ds,
and so on. The symbols BC
 and BC
 refer, in turn, to integrations in the positive and negative 
directions.

cian and physicist. The words in the plane suggest that the theorem generalizes to 3-space. It 
does—read on.

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
Although the foregoing proof is not valid, the theorem is applicable to more complicated 
regions, such as those shown in FIGURE 9.12.3. The proof consists of decomposing R into a finite 
number of subregions to which (1) can be applied and then adding the results.
EXAMPLE 1 
Using Green’s Theorem
Evaluate C (x2  y2) dx  (2y  x) dy, where C consists of the boundary of the region in the 
first quadrant that is bounded by the graphs of y  x 2 and y  x 3.
SOLUTION If P(x, y)  x 2  y2 and Q(x, y)  2y  x, then 0P/0y  2y and 0Q/0x  1. 
From (1) and FIGURE 9.12.4, we have
 BC

We note that the line integral in Example 1 could have been evaluated in a straightforward 
manner using the variable x as a parameter. However, in the next example, ponder the problem 
of evaluating the given line integral in the usual manner.
EXAMPLE 2 
Using Green’s Theorem
Evaluate C (x5  3y) dx  (2x  ey3) dy, where C is the circle (x  1)2  ( y  5)2  4.
SOLUTION Identifying P(x, y)  x 5  3y and Q(x, y)  2x  ey 3, we have 0P/0y  3 and 
0Q/0x  2. Hence, (1) gives
 
BC
 (x
 5  3y) dx  (2x 2 ey3
 ) dy  6
R
(2 2 3) dA   6

 dA.
Now the double integral eeR dA gives the area of the region R bounded by the circle of radius 2 
shown in FIGURE 9.12.5. Since the area of the circle is p 22  4p, it follows that
 
BC
 (x

 ) dy   4p.
EXAMPLE 3 
Work Done by a Force
Find the work done by the force F  (16y  sin x2) i  (4e y  3x2) j acting along the simple 
closed curve C shown in FIGURE 9.12.6.
SOLUTION From (12) of Section 9.8 the work done by F is given by

 F  dr  BC
 (16y  sin x2) dx  (4ey  3x 2) dy
and so by Green’s theorem W  eeR (6x  16) dA. In view of the region R, the last integral is 
best handled in polar coordinates. Since R is defined by 0  r  1, p/4  u  3p/4,

since P, Q, 0P/0y, and 0Q/0x are not continuous at the origin.
 Region with Holes Green’s theorem can also be extended to a region R with “holes,” 
that is, a region bounded between two or more piecewise-smooth simple closed curves. In 
FIGURE 9.12.8(a) we have shown a region R bounded by a curve C that consists of two simple 
closed curves C1 and C2; that is, C  C1 ´ C2. The curve C is positively oriented, since if we 
traverse C1 in a counterclockwise direction and C2 in a clockwise direction, the region R is 
always to the left. If we now introduce crosscuts as shown in Figure 9.12.8(b), the region R is 
divided into two subregions, R1 and R2. By applying Green’s theorem to R1 and R2, we obtain

As a consequence of the discussion preceding Example 5 we can establish a result for line 
integrals that enables us, under certain circumstances, to replace a complicated closed path with 
a path that is simpler. Suppose, as shown in FIGURE 9.12.10, that C1 and C2 are two nonintersecting 
piecewise-smooth simple closed paths that have the same counterclockwise orientation. Suppose

Example 5 it is apparent that P  y/(x2  y2) and Q  x/(x2  y2) have continuous first

INTRODUCTION In the xy-plane, the length of an arc of the graph of y  f (x) from x  a 
to x  b is given by the definite integral

(1)
The problem in three dimensions, which is the counterpart of the arc length problem, is to find 
the area A(s) of that portion of the surface S given by a function z  f (x, y) having continuous 
first partial derivatives on a closed region R in the xy-plane. Such a surface is said to be smooth.
 Surface Area Suppose, as shown in FIGURE 9.13.1(a), that an inner partition P of R is formed 
using lines parallel to the x- and y-axes. P then consists of n rectangular elements Rk of area 
 Ak   xk   yk that lie entirely within R. Let (xk, yk, 0) denote any point in an Rk. As we see in 
Figure 9.13.1(a), by projecting the sides of Rk upward, we determine two quantities: a portion or 
patch Sk of the surface and a portion Tk of a tangent plane at (xk, yk, f (xk, yk)). It seems reasonable 
to assume that when Rk is small, the area Tk of Tk is approximately the same as the area  Sk of Sk.

The indicated vectors u and v, which form two sides of Tk, are given by

One could have almost guessed the form of (2) by naturally extending the one-variable structure

 Differential of Surface Area The function
 
dS  "1  f fx(x, y)g2  f fy(x, y)g2 dA

is called the differential of the surface area. We will use this function in the discussion that follows.
 Surface Integral As we have seen, a double integral

R
 f (x, y) dA
is a generalization of the definite integral eb
a f (x) dx. The surface area integral (2) is a generaliza-
tion of the arc length integral (1). We are now going to consider a generalization of the line 
integral eC G(x, y) ds. This generalization is called a surface integral.
 1. Let w  G(x, y, z) be defined in a region of 3-space that contains a surface S, which is the 
graph of a function z  f (x, y). Let the projection R of the surface onto the xy-plane be either 
a Type I or a Type II region.
 2. Divide the surface S into n patches Sk with areas  Sk that correspond to a partition P of R 
into n rectangles Rk with areas  Ak.
 3. Let iPi be the norm of the partition or the length of the longest diagonal of the Rk.

 Orientable Surfaces In Example 5, we are going to evaluate a surface integral of a vec-
tor field. In order to do this we need to examine the concept of an orientable surface. Roughly, 
an orientable surface S, such as that given in FIGURE 9.13.6(a), has two sides that could be painted 
different colors. The Möbius strip* shown in Figure 9.13.6(b) is not an orientable surface and 
is one-sided. A person who starts to paint the surface of a Möbius strip at a point will paint the 
entire surface and return to the starting point.
Specifically, we say a smooth surface S is orientable or is an oriented surface if there ex-
ists a continuous unit normal vector function n defined at each point (x, y, z) on the surface. 
The vector field n(x, y, z) is called the orientation of S. But since a unit normal to the surface 
S at (x, y, z) can be either n(x, y, z) or n(x, y, z), an orientable surface has two orientations. 
See FIGURE 9.13.7(a)–(c). The Möbius strip shown again in Figure 9.13.7(d) is not an oriented 
surface, since if a unit normal n starts at P on the surface and moves once around the strip on the 
curve C, it ends up on the “opposite side” of the strip at P and so points in the opposite direction. 
*To construct a Möbius strip cut out a long strip of paper, give one end a half-twist, and then attach the 
ends with tape.

CHAPTER 9 Vector Calculus
A surface S defined by z  f (x, y) has an upward orientation (Figure 9.13.7(b)) when the unit 
normals are directed upward—that is, have positive k components, and it has a downward 
orientation (Figure 9.13.7(c)) when the unit normals are directed downward—that is, have 
negative k components.

 Integrals of Vector Fields If F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z) i  Q(x, y, z) j  R(x, y, z) k is the 
velocity field of a fluid, then, as we saw in Figure 9.7.3, the volume of the fluid flowing through 
an element of surface area S per unit time is approximated by
 
(height)(area of base)  (compn F)  S  (F  n)  S,
where n is a unit normal to the surface. See FIGURE 9.13.9. The total volume of a fluid passing 
through S per unit time is called the flux of F through S and is given by
 
flux  6
S
(F  n) dS. 
(10)
In the case of a closed surface S, if n is the outer (inner) normal, then (10) gives the volume of 
fluid flowing out (in) through S per unit time.

REMARKS
If the surface S is piecewise defined, we express a surface integral over S as the sum of the 
surface integrals over the various pieces of the surface. For example, suppose S is the orient-
able piecewise-smooth closed surface bounded by the paraboloid z  x2  y2 (S1) and the 
plane z  1 (S2). Then the flux of a vector field F out of the surface S is

Stokes’ Theorem
INTRODUCTION Green’s theorem of the preceding section has two vector forms. In this 
and in Section 9.16 we shall generalize these forms to three dimensions.

vector field, then

F T ds  6

(curl F)  k dA;  
(1)
that is, the line integral of the tangential component of F is the double integral of the normal 
component of curl F. 
 Green’s Theorem in 3-Space The vector form of Green’s theorem given in (1) 
relates a line integral around a piecewise-smooth simple closed curve C forming the bound-
ary of a plane region R to a double integral over R. Green’s theorem in 3-space relates a 
line integral around a piecewise-smooth simple closed curve C forming the boundary of a 
surface S with a surface integral over S. Suppose z  f (x, y) is a continuous function whose 
graph is a piecewise-smooth orientable surface over a region R on the xy-plane. Let C form 
the boundary of S and let the projection of C onto the xy-plane form the boundary of R. The 
positive direction on C is induced by the orientation of the surface S; the positive direction 
on C corresponds to the direction a person would have to walk on C to have his or her head 
point in the direction of the orientation of the surface while keeping the surface to the left. 
See FIGURE 9.14.1. More precisely, the positive orientation of C is in accordance with the 
right-hand rule: If the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the orientation of the 
surface, then roughly the fingers of the right hand wrap around the surface in the positive 
direction. Finally, let T be a unit tangent vector to C that points in the positive direction. 
The three-dimensional form of Green’s theorem, which we now give, is called Stokes’ 
theorem after the Irish mathematical physicist George G. Stokes (1819–1903).
Theorem 9.14.1 
Stokes’ Theorem
Let S be a piecewise-smooth orientable surface bounded by a piecewise-smooth simple closed 
curve C. Let F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z) i  Q(x, y, z) j  R(x, y, z) k be a vector field for which P, 
Q, and R are continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in a region of 3-space 
containing S. If C is traversed in the positive direction, then

where n is a unit normal to S in the direction of the orientation of S.

If Cxy is the projection of C onto the xy-plane and has the parametric equations x  x(t), y  y(t),

Subtracting (6) from (5) and using the fact that 02f/0x 0y  02f/0y 0x, we see that (4)  becomes, after

Note that if F is the gradient of a scalar function, then, in view of (5) in Section 9.7, (2) 
implies that the circulation C F  dr is zero. Conversely, it can be shown that if the circula-
tion is zero for every simple closed curve, then F is the gradient of a scalar function. In other 
words, F is irrotational if and only if F  f, where f is a potential for F. Equivalently, 
this gives a test for a conservative vector field: 
F is a conservative vector field if and only if curl F  0.
 Physical Interpretation of Curl In Section 9.8 we saw that if F is a velocity field 
of a fluid, then the circulation C F  dr of F around C is a measure of the amount by which the 
fluid tends to turn the curve C by circulating around it. The circulation of F is closely related to 
the curl of F. To see this, suppose P0(x 0, y0, z0 ) is any point in the fluid and Cr is a small circle 
of radius r centered at P0. See FIGURE 9.14.4. Then by Stokes’  theorem,

9.14 Stokes’ Theorem 
| 563
Now at all points P(x, y, z) within the small circle Cr, if we take curl F(P) < curl F(P0), then 
(8) gives the approximation
 
 BCr
 F d r < 6
Sr

   (curl F (P0))  n(P0) 6
Sr

(9)
 
   (curl F(P0))  n(P0) Ar , 
where Ar is the area (pr2) of the circular surface Sr. As we let r S 0, the approximation curl 
F(P) < curl F(P0) becomes better, and so (9) yields
 
(curl F(P0))  n(P0)  lim
rS0 1
Ar
 BCr
 F  d r. 
(10)
Thus we see that the normal component of curl F is the limiting value of the ratio of the circulation 
of F to the area of the circular surface. For a small but fixed value of r, we have
 
(curl F(P0))  n(P0) < 1
Ar FCr
F  d r. 
(11)
Roughly then, the curl of F is the circulation of F per unit area. If curl F(P0)  0, then the left-
hand side of (11) is a maximum when the circle Cr is situated in a manner so that n(P0) points 
in the same direction as curl F(P0). In this case, the circulation on the right side of (11) will also 
be a maximum. Thus, a paddle wheel inserted into the fluid at P0 will rotate fastest when its axis 
points in the direction of curl F(P0). See FIGURE 9.14.5. Note, too, that the paddle wheel will not 
rotate if its axis is perpendicular to curl F(P0).
REMARKS
The value of the surface integral in (2) is determined solely by the integral around its bound-
ary C. This basically means that the shape of the surface S is irrelevant. Assuming that the 
hypotheses of Theorem 9.14.1 are satisfied, then for two different surfaces S1 and S2 with the 
same orientation and with the same boundary C, we have

Triple Integrals
INTRODUCTION The steps leading to the definition of the three-dimensional definite integral 
or triple integral are quite similar to the steps leading to the definition of the double integral. 
Obvious differences: instead of a function of two variables we are integrating a function f of three 
variables, not over a region R in a coordinate plane, but over a region D of 3-space.
 1. Let w  F(x, y, z) be defined over a closed and bounded region D of space.
 2. By means of a three-dimensional grid of vertical and horizontal planes parallel to the coor-
dinate planes, form a partition P of D into n subregions (boxes) Dk of volumes Vk that lie 
entirely in D.
 3. Let iPi be the norm of the partition or the length of the longest diagonal of the Dk.
 4. Choose a sample point (x*
k, y*
k, z *
k) in each subregion Dk. See FIGURE 9.15.1.

9.15 Triple Integrals 
| 565
As in our previous discussions on the integral, when F is continuous over D, the limit in 
(1) exists; that is, F is integrable over D.
 Evaluation by Iterated Integrals If the region D is bounded above by the graph 
of z  f2(x, y) and bounded below by the graph of z  f1(x, y), then it can be shown that the 
triple integral (1) can be expressed as a double integral of the partial integral e
f2(x, y)
f1(x, y) F(x, y, z) dz; 
that is,

where R is the orthogonal projection of D onto the xy-plane. In particular, if R is a Type I region, 
then, as shown in FIGURE 9.15.2, the triple integral of F over D can be written as an iterated integral:

To evaluate the iterated integral in (2) we begin by evaluating the partial integral
 
#
f2(x, y)
f1(x, y)
 F(x, y, z) dz, 
in which both x and y are held fixed.
In a double integral there are only two possible orders of integration: dy dx and dx dy. The 
triple integral in (2) illustrates one of six possible orders of integration:
 
dz dy dx,   dz dx dy,   dy dx dz, 
 
dx dy dz,   dx dz dy,   dy dz dx.
The last two differentials tell the coordinate plane in which the region R is situated. For 
example, the iterated integral corresponding to the order of integration dx dz dy must have

Depending on the geometry of a region in 3-space, the evaluation of a triple integral over that 
region may be made easier by utilizing a new coordinate system.
 Cylindrical Coordinates The cylindrical coordinate system combines the polar descrip-
tion of a point in the plane with the rectangular description of the z-component of a point in space. 
As seen in FIGURE 9.15.6(a), the cylindrical coordinates of a point P are denoted by the ordered triple 
(r, u, z). The word cylindrical arises from the fact that a point P in space is determined by the intersec-
tion of the planes z  constant and u  constant with a cylinder r  constant. See Figure 9.15.6(b).

 Conversion of Cylindrical Coordinates to Rectangular Coordinates From 
Figure 9.15.6(a) we also see that the rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) of a point can be obtained 
from the cylindrical coordinates (r, u, z) by means of
 
x  r cos u,    y  r sin u,    z  z .

EXAMPLE 3 
Cylindrical to Rectangular Coordinates
Convert (8, p/3, 7) in cylindrical coordinates to rectangular coordinates.
SOLUTION From (3), 
 
x  8 cos p
3  4,  y  8 sin  p
3  4"3,  z  7.
Thus, (8, p/3, 7) is equivalent to (4, 4 "3, 7) in rectangular coordinates.
 Conversion of Rectangular Coordinates to Cylindrical Coordinates To 
express rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) as cylindrical coordinates, we use
 
r 2  x 2  y2,    tan u  y
x,    z  z .

If we take r  2, then, consistent with the fact that x  0 and y  0, we take u  3p/4.* 
Consequently, ("2, "2,  1) is equivalent to (2, 3p/4, 1) in cylindrical coordinates. See 
FIGURE 9.15.7.
 Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates Recall from Section 9.11 that the area 
of a polar rectangle is  A  r* r u, where r* is the average radius. From FIGURE 9.15.8(a) we 
see that the volume of a cylindrical wedge is simply V  (area of base)(height)  r* r u 
z. Thus, if F(r, u, z) is a continuous function over the region D, as shown in Figure 9.15.8(b), 
then the triple integral of F over D is given by

 Spherical Coordinates As seen in FIGURE 9.15.10(a), the spherical coordinates of a 
point P are given by the ordered triple (r, f, u), where r is the distance from the origin to P, f 
is the angle between the positive z-axis and the vector OP

the positive x-axis to the vector projection OQ

 of OP

.* Figure 9.15.10(b) shows that a point P 
in space is determined by the intersection of a cone f  constant, a plane u  constant, and a 
sphere r  constant; whence arises the name “spherical” coordinates.

 Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates As seen in FIGURE 9.15.11, the volume 
of a spherical wedge is given by the approximation
 
V < r2 sin f r f u.
Thus, in a triple integral of a continuous spherical coordinate function F(r, f, u), the differential 
of volume dV is given by
 
dV  r2 sin f dr df du.
A typical triple integral in spherical coordinates has the form

FIGURE 9.15.13 Parallels and great circles
REMARKS
Spherical coordinates are used in navigation. If we think of the Earth as a sphere of fixed 
radius centered at the origin, then a point P can be located by specifying two angles u and f. 
As shown in FIGURE 9.15.13, when f is held constant, the resulting curve is called a parallel. 
Fixed values of u result in curves called great circles. Half of one of these great circles joining 
the north and south poles is called a meridian. The intersection of a parallel and a meridian 
gives the position of a point P. If 0  f  180 and 180  u  180, the angles 90  f 
and u are said to be the latitude and longitude of P, respectively. The prime meridian cor-
responds to a longitude of 0. The latitude of the equator is 0; the latitudes of the north and 
south poles are, in turn, 90 (or 90 North) and 90 (or 90 South).

Divergence Theorem
INTRODUCTION In Section 9.14 we saw that Stokes’ theorem was a three-dimensional 
generalization of a vector form of Green’s theorem. In this section we present a second vector 
form of Green’s theorem and its three-dimensional analogue.
 Another Vector Form of Green’s Theorem Let F(x, y)  P(x, y) i  Q(x, y)  j be 
a two-dimensional vector field, and let T  (dx/ds) i  (dy/ds) j be a unit tangent to a simple 
closed plane curve C. In (1) of Section 9.14 we saw that C (F  T) ds can be evaluated by a 
double integral involving curl F. Similarly, if n  (dy/ds) i  (dx/ds) j is a unit normal to C 
(check T  n), then C (F  n) ds can be expressed in terms of a double integral of div F. From

Let D be a closed and bounded region in 3-space with a piecewise-smooth boundary S that is 
oriented outward. Let F(x, y, z)  P(x, y, z) i  Q(x, y, z)  j  R(x, y, z) k be a vector field for 
which P, Q, and R are continuous and have continuous first partial  derivatives in a region of

PARTIAL PROOF: We will prove (2) for the special region D shown in FIGURE 9.16.1 whose

where R is the projection of D onto the xy-plane and C is the boundary of R. Since

On S3: Since this side is vertical, k is perpendicular to n. Consequently, k  n  0 and

Finally, adding (7), (8), and (9), we get

which is the same as (6).
Although we proved (2) for a special region D that has a vertical side, we note that this type 
of region is not required in Theorem 9.16.1. A region D with no vertical side is illustrated in 
FIGURE 9.16.2; a region bounded by a sphere or an ellipsoid also does not have a vertical side. The 
divergence theorem also holds for the region D bounded between two closed surfaces, such as 
the concentric spheres Sa and Sb shown in FIGURE 9.16.3; the boundary surface S of D is the union 
of Sa and Sb. In this case S (F  n) dS  D div F dV becomes

 Physical Interpretation of Divergence In Section 9.14 we saw that we could 
express the normal component of the curl of a vector field F at a point as a limit involving the 
circulation of F. In view of (2), it is possible to interpret the divergence of F at a point as a limit 
involving the flux of F. Recall from Section 9.7 that the flux of the velocity field F of a fluid is 
the rate of fluid flow—that is, the volume of fluid flowing through a surface per unit time. In 
Section 9.7 we saw that the divergence of F is the flux per unit volume. To reinforce this last idea 
let us suppose P0(x0, y0, z 0) is any point in the fluid and Sr is a small sphere of radius r centered 
at P0. See FIGURE 9.16.5. If Dr is the sphere Sr and its interior, then the divergence theorem gives

(11)
If we take the approximation div F(P)  div F(P0) at all points P(x, y, z) within the small sphere, 
then (11) gives

(F n) dS < 9
Dr

   div F(P0) 9

(12)
 
   div F(P0)Vr ,
where Vr is the volume ( 4
3pr 3) of the spherical region Dr. By letting r S 0, we see from (12) 
that the divergence of F is the limiting value of the ratio of the flux of F to the volume of the 
spherical region:
 
div F(P0)  lim
rS0 1
Vr
 6
Sr
 (F n) dS.
Hence, divergence F is flux per unit volume.
The divergence theorem is extremely useful in the derivation of some of the famous equations 
in electricity and magnetism and hydrodynamics. In the discussion that follows we shall consider 
an example from the study of fluids.
 Continuity Equation At the  end of Section 9.7 we mentioned that one interpretation 
of div F was a measure of the rate of change of the density of a fluid at a point. To see why 
this is so, let us suppose that F is a velocity field of a fluid and that r(x, y, z, t) is the density 
of the fluid at a point P(x, y, z) at a time t. Let D be the closed region consisting of a sphere S 
and its interior. We know from Section 9.15 that the total mass m of the fluid in D is given by 
m  D r(x, y, z, t) dV. The rate at which the mass increases in D is given by
 
dm

(13)
Now from Figure 9.7.3 we saw that the volume of fluid flowing through an element of surface 
area S per unit time is approximated by (F  n)  S. The mass of the fluid flowing through an 
element of surface area  S per unit time is then ( r F  n)  S. If we assume that the change in

9.16 Divergence Theorem 
| 579
mass in D is due only to the flow in and out of D, then the volume of fluid flowing out of D per 
unit time is given by (10) of Section 9.13, S (F  n) dS, whereas the mass of the fluid flowing 
out of D per unit time is S ( r F  n) dS. Hence, an alternative expression for the rate at which 
the mass increases in D is
 
 6
S
(rF n) dS. 
(14)
By the divergence theorem, (14) is the same as

Since this last result is to hold for every sphere, we obtain the equation of continuity for fluid 
flows:

(16)
On page 514 we stated that if div F    F  0, then a fluid is incompressible. This fact 
follows immediately from (16). If a fluid is incompressible (such as water), then r is constant, 
so consequently   ( r F)  r  F. But in addition  	r/	t  0 and so (16) implies   F  0.
In Problems 1 and 2, verify the divergence theorem.

Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals

make a substitution, or change of variable, in a definite integral e

where the u-limits of integration c and d are defined by a  g(c) and b  g(d). There are three 
things that bear emphasizing in (1). To change the variable in a definite integral we replace x
where it appears in the integrand by g(u), we change the interval of integration [a, b] on the x-axis 
to the corresponding interval [c, d] on the u-axis, and we replace dx by a function multiple (namely, 
the derivative of g) of du. If we write J(u)  dx/du, then (1) has the form

 Double Integrals Although changing variables in a multiple integral is not as straight-
forward as the procedure in (1), the basic idea illustrated in (2) carries over. To change variables 
in a double integral we need two equations such as
 
x  f (u, v),    y  g(u, v). 
(3)
To be analogous with (2), we expect that a change of variables in a double integral would take 
the form
 
6
R
F( x, y) dA  6
S
F(  f (u, v), g(u, v)) J(u, v) dA,  
(4)
where S is the region in the uv-plane corresponding to the region R in the xy-plane and J(u, v) is 
some function that depends on the partial derivatives of the equations in (3). The symbol dA on 
the right side of (4) represents either du dv or dv du.
In Section 9.11 we briefly discussed how to change a double integral R F(x, y) dA from 
rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Recall that in Example 2 of that section the 
substitutions
 
x  r cos u,    y  r sin u 
(5)
led to

(6)
As we see in FIGURE 9.17.1, the introduction of polar coordinates changes the original region 
of integration R in the xy-plane to the more convenient rectangular region of integration S in 
the ru-plane. We note, too, that by comparing (4) with (6), we can identify J(r, u)  r and 
dA  dr du.
The change-of-variable equations in (3) define a transformation or mapping T from the 
uv-plane to the xy-plane. A point (x0, y0) in the xy-plane determined from x0  f (u0, v0), y0  g(u0, v0) 
is said to be an image of (u0, v0).

S2, and S3.
 
 S1: On this side v  0 so that x  u2, y  u2. Eliminating u then gives y  x. Now 
imagine moving along the boundary from (1, 0) to (2, 0) (that is, 1  u  2). The 
equations x  u2, y  u2 then indicate that x ranges from x  1 to x  4 and y ranges

simultaneously from y  1 to y  4. In other words, in the xy-plane the image of S1 is 
the line segment y  x from (1, 1) to (4, 4).
 
 S2: On this boundary u2  v2  4 and so x  4. Now as we move from the point 
(2, 0) to (#5
2, #3
2 ), the remaining equation y  u2  v2 indicates that y ranges from 
y  22  02  4 to y  (#5
2 )2 2 (#3
2 )2  1. In this case the image of S2 is the verti-
cal line segment x  4 starting at (4, 4) and going down to (4, 1).
 
 S3: Since u2  v2  1, we get y  1. But as we move on this boundary from (#5
2, #3
2 ), 
to (1, 0), the equation x  u2  v2 indicates that x ranges from x  4 to x  1. The image 
of S3 is the horizontal line segment y  1 starting at (4, 1) and ending at (1, 1).
The image of S is the region R given in Figure 9.17.2(b).
Observe in Example 1 that as we traverse the boundary of S in the counterclockwise direc-
tion, the boundary of R is traversed in a clockwise manner. We say that the transformation of 
the boundary of S has induced an orientation on the boundary of R.
While a proof of the formula for changing variables in a multiple integral is beyond the level 
of this text, we will give some of the underlying assumptions that are made about the equations 
(3) and the regions R and S. We assume that
• The functions f and g have continuous first partial derivatives on S.
• The transformation is one-to-one.
•  Each of the regions R and S consists of a piecewise-smooth simple closed curve and its 
interior.
• The determinant

 is not zero on S.
A transformation T is said to be one-to-one if each point (x0, y0) in R is the image under T of 
a unique point (u0, v0) in S. Put another way, no two points in S have the same image in R. With 
the restrictions that r  0 and 0  u  2p, the equations in (5) define a one-to-one transformation 
from the ru-plane to the xy-plane. The determinant in (7) is called the Jacobian determinant, or 
simply Jacobian, of the transformation T and is the key to changing variables in a multiple inte-
gral. The Jacobian of the transformation defined by the equations in (3) is denoted by the symbol
 
0(x, y)
0(u, v).
Similar to the notion of a one-to-one function, a one-to-one transformation T has an inverse 
transformation T 1 such that (u0, v0) is the image under T 1 of (x0, y0). See FIGURE 9.17.3. If it 
is possible to solve (3) for u and v in terms of x and y, then the inverse transformation is defined 
by a pair of equations
 
u  h(x, y),    v  k(x, y).

We now turn our attention to the main point of this discussion: how to change variables in a 
multiple integral. The idea expressed in (4) is valid; the function J(u, v) turns out to be |	(x, y)	(u, v)|. 
Under the assumptions made above, we have the following result:
EXAMPLE 3 
Changing Variables in a Double Integral
Evaluate R sin(x  2y) cos(x  2y) dA over the region R shown in FIGURE 9.17.4(a).
SOLUTION The difficulty in evaluating this double integral is clearly the integrand. The pres-
ence of the terms x  2y and x  2y prompts us to define the change of variables u  x  2y,
v  x  2y. These equations will map R onto a region S in the uv-plane. As in Example 1, we 
transform the sides of the region.
 
 S1: y  0 implies u  x and v  x or v  u. As we move from (2p, 0) to (0, 0), we see 
that the corresponding image points in the uv-plane lie on the line segment v  u from 
(2p, 2p) to (0, 0).
 
 S2: x  0 implies u  2y and v  2y, or v  u. As we move from (0, 0) to (0, p), 
the corresponding image points in the uv-plane lie on the line segment v  u from 
(0, 0) to (2p, 2p).
 
 S3: x  2y  2p implies u  2p. As we move from (0, p) to (2p, 0), the equation 
v  x  2y shows that v ranges from v  2p to v  2p. Thus, the image of S3 is the
Theorem 9.17.1

S
 F( f (u, v), g(u, v))  2 0(x, y)

Formula (3) of Section 9.11 for changing a double integral to polar coordinates is just a special 
case of (11) with
2 0(x, y)
0(r, u) 2  ZrZ  r, 
since r  0. In (6) then we have J(r, u)  | 	(x, y)/ 	(r, u)|  r.
A change of variables in a multiple integral can be used for either a simplification of the 
integrand or a simplification of the region of integration. The actual change of variables used is 
often inspired by the structure of the integrand F(x, y) or by equations that define the region R. As 
a consequence, the transformation is then defined by equations of the form given in (8); that is, 
we are dealing with the inverse transformation. The next two examples will illustrate these ideas.

EXAMPLE 4 
Changing Variables in a Double Integral
Evaluate R xy dA over the region R shown in FIGURE 9.17.5(a).
SOLUTION In this case the integrand is fairly simple, but integration over the region R would 
be tedious since we would have to express R xy dA as the sum of three integrals. (Verify this.)
The equations of the boundaries of R suggest the change of variables
 
u  y
x2,   v  xy. 
(12)
Obtaining the image of R is a straightforward matter in this case, since the images of the curves 
that make up the four boundaries are simply u  1, u  4, v  1, and v  5. In other words, the 
image of the region R is the rectangular region S: 1  u  4, 1  v  5. See Figure 9.17.5(b).
Now instead of trying to solve the equations in (12) for x and y in terms of u and v, we can 
compute the Jacobian 	(x, y)/	(u, v) by computing 	(u, v)/	(x, y) and using (10). We have

We encountered systems of 
ordinary differential equations in 
Sections 2.9, 3.12, and 4.6 and 
were able to solve some systems 
using either systematic 
elimination or the Laplace 
transform. In this chapter we 
focus only on systems of linear 
first-order differential equations. 
We will see that the general 
theory of systems of linear DEs 
and the solution procedure is 
similar to that of linear higher-
order equations considered in 
Chapter 3. This material is 
fundamental to the analysis of 
systems of nonlinear first-order 
equations in Chapter 11.
Matrix notation and properties 
are used extensively throughout 
this chapter. If you are unfamiliar 
with these concepts, a review of 
Chapter 8 is recommended.

Theory of Linear Systems
INTRODUCTION Recall that in Section 3.12 we illustrated how to solve systems of n linear 
differential equations in n unknowns of the form
 
P11(D)x1  P12(D)x2  p  P1n(D)xn  b1(t)
 
P21(D)x1  P22(D)x2  p  P2n(D)xn  b2(t) 
(1)
 
(  
(
 
  Pn1(D)x1  Pn2(D)x2  p  Pnn(D)xn  bn(t), 
where the Pij were polynomials of various degrees in the differential operator D. In this chapter 
we confine our study to systems of first-order DEs that are special cases of systems that have 
the normal form
 
dx1
dt  g1(t, x1, x2,  p  , xn)
 
dx2
dt  g2(t, x1, x2,  p  , xn) 
(2)
 
(  
(
 
  dxn
dt  gn(t, x1, x2,  p  , xn).
A system such as (2) of n first-order equations is called a first-order system.
 Linear Systems When each of the functions g1, g2, … , gn in (2) is linear in the depen-
dent variables x1, x2, … , xn , we get the normal form of a first-order system of linear equations:
 
 dx1
dt  a11(t)x1  a12(t)x2  p  a1n(t)xn  f1(t)
 
 dx2
dt  a21(t)x1  a22(t)x2  p  a2n(t)xn  f2(t) 
(3)
 
(  
(
 
   dxn
dt  an1(t)x1  an2(t)x2  p  ann(t)xn  fn(t).
We refer to a system of the form given in (3) simply as a linear system. We assume that the 
coefficients ai j(t) as well as the functions fi(t) are continuous on a common interval I. When fi(t)  0, 
i  1, 2, … , n, the linear system is said to be homogeneous; otherwise it is nonhomogeneous.

Definition 10.1.1 
Solution Vector
A solution vector on an interval I is any column matrix
X  ±
x1(t)
x2(t)
(

whose entries are differentiable functions satisfying the system (4) on the interval.
A solution vector of (4), of course, is equivalent to n scalar equations x1  f1(t), x2  f2(t), … , 
xn  fn(t), and can be interpreted geometrically as a set of parametric equations of a space curve. 
In the cases n  2 and n  3, the equations x1  f1(t), x2  f2(t), and x1  f1(t), x2  f2(t), 
x3  f3(t) represent curves in 2-space and 3-space, respectively. It is common practice to call 
such a solution curve a trajectory. The plane is also called the phase plane. We will illustrate 
these concepts in the section that follows, as well as in Chapter 11.

CHAPTER 10 Systems of Linear First-Order Differential Equations
Much of the theory of systems of n linear first-order differential equations is similar to that 
of linear nth-order differential equations.
 Initial-Value Problem Let t0 denote a point on an interval I and
 
X(t0)  ±
x1(t0)
x2(t0)
(
xn(t0)
≤ and X0  ±
g1
g2
(
gn
≤, 
where the gi , i  1, 2, … , n are given constants. Then the problem
 
Solve: 
X  A(t)X  F(t) 
(7)
 
Subject to: 
X(t0)  X0
is an initial-value problem on the interval.
Theorem 10.1.1 
Existence of a Unique Solution
Let the entries of the matrices A(t) and F(t) be functions continuous on a common interval I
that contains the point t0. Then there exists a unique solution of the initial-value problem (7) 
on the interval.
Theorem 10.1.2 
Superposition Principle
Let X1, X2, … , Xk be a set of solution vectors of the homogeneous system (5) on an interval I. 
Then the linear combination
 
X  c1X1  c2X2  p  ckXk  , 
where the ci , i  1, 2, … , k are arbitrary constants, is also a solution of the system on the interval.
 Homogeneous Systems In the next several definitions and theorems we are concerned 
only with homogeneous systems. Without stating it, we shall always assume that the ai  j and the 
fi are continuous functions of t on some common interval I.
 Superposition Principle The following result is a superposition principle for solu-
tions of linear systems.
It follows from Theorem 10.1.2 that a constant multiple of any solution vector of a homogeneous 
system of linear first-order differential equations is also a solution.
EXAMPLE 3 
Using the Superposition Principle
You should practice by verifying that the two vectors

 Linear Dependence and Linear Independence We are primarily interested in 
linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous system (5).
Definition 10.1.2 
Linear Dependence/Independence
Let X1, X2, … , Xk be a set of solution vectors of the homogeneous system (5) on an interval I. 
We say that the set is linearly dependent on the interval if there exist constants c1, c2, … , ck , 
not all zero, such that
 
c1X1  c2X2  p  ckXk  0
for every t in the interval. If the set of vectors is not linearly dependent on the interval, it is 
said to be linearly independent.
Theorem 10.1.3 
Criterion for Linearly Independent Solutions
Let 
X1  ±
x11
x21
(
xn1
≤,  X2  ±
x12
x22
(
xn2
≤,  p  ,  Xn  ±
x1n
x2n
(
xnn
≤
be n solution vectors of the homogeneous system (5) on an interval I. Then the set of solution 
vectors is linearly independent on I if and only if the Wronskian
 
W(X1, X2, … , Xn)  4
x11
x12
p
x1n
x21
x22
p
x2n
(
(
xn1
xn2
p
xnn
4   0 
(9)
for every t in the interval.
The case when k  2 should be clear; two solution vectors X1 and X2 are linearly dependent 
if one is a constant multiple of the other, and conversely. For k  2, a set of solution vectors is 
linearly dependent if we can express at least one solution vector as a linear combination of the 
remaining vectors.
 Wronskian As in our earlier consideration of the theory of a single ordinary differential 
equation, we can introduce the concept of the Wronskian determinant as a test for linear inde-
pendence. We state the following theorem without proof.
It can be shown that if X1, X2, … , Xn are solution vectors of (5), then for every t
in I, either W(X1, X2, … , Xn)  0 or W(X1, X2, … , Xn)  0. Thus if we can show that 
W  0 for some t0 in I, then W  0 for every t; hence the set of solutions is linearly independent 
on the interval.
Notice that, unlike our definition of the Wronskian in Section 3.1, here the definition of the 
determinant (9) does not involve differentiation.
EXAMPLE 4 
Linearly Independent Solutions
In Example 2 we saw that X1  a
1
1b e2t and X2  a3
5b e6t are solutions of system (6).
Clearly X1 and X2 are linearly independent on the interval (q, q) since neither vector is a 
constant multiple of the other. In addition, we have
 
W(X1, X2)  2
e2t
3e6t
e2t
5e6t 2  8e4t  0
for all real values of t.

CHAPTER 10 Systems of Linear First-Order Differential Equations
The next two theorems are the linear system equivalents of Theorems 3.1.5 and 3.1.6.
Definition 10.1.3 
Fundamental Set of Solutions
Any set X1, X2, … , Xn of n linearly independent solution vectors of the homogeneous 
system (5) on an interval I is said to be a fundamental set of solutions on the interval.
Theorem 10.1.4 
Existence of a Fundamental Set
There exists a fundamental set of solutions for the homogeneous system (5) on an  interval I.
Theorem 10.1.5 
General Solution—Homogeneous Systems
Let X1, X2, … , Xn be a fundamental set of solutions of the homogeneous system (5) on an 
interval I. Then the general solution of the system on the interval is
X  c1X1  c2X2  p  cnXn ,
where the ci , i  1, 2, … , n are arbitrary constants.
EXAMPLE 5 
General Solution of System (6)
From Example 2 we know that X1  a
1
1b e2t and X2  a3
5b e6t are linearly independent 
solutions of (6) on (q, q). Hence X1 and X2 form a fundamental set of solutions on the 
interval. The general solution of the homogeneous system on the interval is then
 
X  c1X1  c2X2  c1 a

1b  e2t  c2 a3
5b  e6t.

on (q, q). Thus the general solution of the homogeneous system on the interval is the linear

 Nonhomogeneous Systems For nonhomogeneous systems, a particular solution 
Xp on an interval I is any vector, free of arbitrary parameters, whose entries are functions that 
satisfy system (4).

Theorem 10.1.6 
General Solution—Nonhomogeneous Systems
Let Xp be a given solution of the nonhomogeneous system (4) on an interval I, and let
 
Xc  c1X1  c2X2  p  cnXn
denote the general solution on the same interval of the associated homogeneous system (5). 
Then the general solution of the nonhomogeneous system on the interval is
X  Xc  Xp.
The general solution Xc of the associated homogeneous system (5) is called the complementary 
function of the nonhomogeneous system (4).

3b X, was seen in (10) of Example 5 to be 
Xc  c1a

1b e2t  c2a3
5b e6t  a
3t 2 4

is the general solution of the nonhomogeneous system (11) on the interval (q, q).

(a11  l)k1             a12k2  p              a1nkn  0
     a21k1  (a22  l)k2  p              a2nkn  0
 
(  
(
     an1k1              an2k2  p  (ann  l)kn  0.
Thus to find a nontrivial solution X of (2) we must first find a nontrivial solution of the foregoing 
system; in other words, we must find a nontrivial vector K that satisfies (3). But in order for (3) 
to have solutions other than the obvious trivial solution k1  k2  p   kn  0, we must have
 
det(A  lI)  0.
This polynomial equation in l is called the characteristic equation of the matrix A; its solutions 
are the eigenvalues of A. A solution K  0 of (3) corresponding to an eigenvalue l is called an 
eigenvector of A. A solution of the homogeneous system (2) is then X  Kelt.
In the following discussion we examine three cases: all the eigenvalues are real and distinct 
(that is, no eigenvalues are equal), repeated eigenvalues, and finally, complex eigenvalues.
10.2.1 
Distinct Real Eigenvalues
When the n  n matrix A possesses n distinct real eigenvalues l1, l2, … , ln, then a set of n 
linearly independent eigenvectors K1, K2, … , Kn can always be found and
 
X1  K1el1t, X2  K2el2t, p  , Xn  Knelnt
is a fundamental set of solutions of (2) on (q, q).
We will be dealing only with 
linear systems with constant 
coefﬁ cients.
See Theorem 8.6.6 on page 412. 
Theorem 10.2.1 
General Solution—Homogeneous Systems
Let l1, l2, … , ln be n distinct real eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix A of the homogeneous 
system (2), and let K1, K2, … , Kn be the corresponding eigenvectors. Then the general solution 
of (2) on the interval (q, q) is given by
 
 X  c1K1el1t  c2K2el2t  p  cnKnelnt.

Now for l1  1, (3) is equivalent to
 
3k1  3k2  0
 
 2k1  2k2  0.
Thus k1  k2. When k2  1, the related eigenvector is

For l2  4, we have

so that k1  3

independent solutions of (4),
 
X1  a

we conclude that the general solution of the system is

 Phase Portrait For the sake of review, you should keep firmly in mind that a solution of 
a system of linear first-order differential equations, when written in terms of matrices, is simply 
an alternative to the method that we employed in Section 3.12—namely, listing the individual 
functions and the relationship between the constants. If we add the vectors on the right side of 
(5) and then equate the entries with the corresponding entries in the vector of the left, we obtain 
the more familiar statement
 
x  c1et  3c2e4t,  y  c1et  2c2e4t.
As pointed out in Section 10.1, we can interpret these equations as parametric equations of a 
curve or trajectory in the xy-plane or phase plane. The three graphs shown in FIGURE 10.2.1, 
x(t) in the tx-plane, y(t) in the ty-plane, and the trajectory in the phase plane, correspond to the 
choice of constants c1  c2  1 in the solution. A collection of trajectories in the phase plane as 
shown in FIGURE 10.2.2 is said to be a phase portrait of the given linear system. What appears 
to be two red lines in Figure 10.2.2 are actually four half-lines defined parametrically in the 
first, second, third, and fourth quadrants by the solutions X2, X1, X2, and X1, respectively. 
For example, the Cartesian equations y  2
3x, x  0, and y  x, x  0, of the half-lines in the 
first and fourth quadrants were obtained by eliminating the parameter t in the solutions x  3e4t, 
y  2e4t, and x  et, y  et, respectively. Moreover, each eigenvector can be visualized as a 
two-dimensional vector lying along one of these half-lines. The eigenvector K2  a3
2b lies along 
y  2
3x in the first quadrant and K1  a
1
1b lies along y  x in the fourth quadrant; each 
vector starts at the origin with K2 terminating at the point (2, 3) and K1 terminating at (1, 1).

The origin is not only a constant solution, x  0, y  0, of every 2  2 homogeneous linear 
system X  AX but is as well an important point in the qualitative study of such systems. If 
we think in physical terms, the arrowheads on a trajectory in Figure 10.2.2 indicate the direc-
tion that a particle with coordinates (x(t), y(t)) on a trajectory at time t would move as time 
increases. Observe that the arrowheads, with only those on the half-lines in the second and 
fourth quadrants being the exception, indicate that a particle would move away from the origin 
as time t increases. If we imagine time ranging from q to q, then inspection of the solution 
x  c1et  3c2e4t, y  c1et  2c2e4t, c1  0, c2  0, shows that a trajectory, or moving 
particle, “starts” asymptotic to one of the half-lines defined by X1 or X1 (since e4t is negligible 
for t S q) and “finishes” asymptotic to one of the half-lines defined by X2 and X2 (since 
et is negligible for t S q).
We note in passing that Figure 10.2.2 represents a phase portrait that is typical of all 2  2 
homogeneous linear systems X  AX with real eigenvalues of opposite signs. See Problem 19 
in Exercises 10.2. Moreover, phase portraits in the two cases when distinct real eigenvalues have 
the same algebraic sign would be typical portraits of all such 2  2 linear systems; the only dif-
ference is that the arrowheads would indicate that a particle would move away from the origin on 
any trajectory as t S q when both l1 and l2 are positive and would move toward the origin on 
any trajectory when both l1 and l2 are negative. Consequently, it is common to call the origin a 
repeller in the case l1  0, l2  0, and an attractor in the case l1 	 0, l2 	 0. See Problem 20 
in Exercises 10.2. The origin in Figure 10.2.2 is neither a repeller nor an attractor. Investigation 
of the remaining case when l  0 is an eigenvalue of a 2  2 homogeneous linear system is left 
as an exercise. See Problem 52 in Exercises 10.2.

 Use of Computers Software packages such as MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple can 
be real time savers in finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. For example, to find the 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix of coefficients in (6) using Mathematica, we first 
input the definition of the matrix by rows:
 
m  { {4, 1, 1}, { 1, 5, 1}, { 0, 1, 3} }.
The commands Eigenvalues[m] and Eigenvectors[m] given in sequence yield
 
{5, 4, 3}  and  { { 1, 8, 1}, { 10, 1, 1}, { 1, 0, 1} },
respectively. In Mathematica, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can also be obtained at the same 
time by using Eigensystem[m].
10.2.2  Repeated Eigenvalues
Of course, not all of the n eigenvalues l1, l2, … , ln of an n  n matrix A need be distinct; that 
is, some of the eigenvalues may be repeated. For example, the characteristic equation of the 
coefficient matrix in the system
 
X  a3
18
2
9b X 
(10)
is readily shown to be (l  3)2  0, and therefore l1  l2  3 is a root of multiplicity two. 
For this value we find the single eigenvector
 
K1  a3
1b , so X1  a3
1b e3t 
(11)
is one solution of (10). But since we are obviously interested in forming the general solution of 
the system, we need to pursue the question of finding a second solution.
In general, if m is a positive integer and (l  l1)m is a factor of the characteristic equation 
while (l  l1)m1 is not a factor, then l1 is said to be an eigenvalue of multiplicity m. The next 
three examples illustrate the following cases:
 (i) For some n  n matrices A it may be possible to find m linearly independent eigen-
vectors K1, K2, … , Km corresponding to an eigenvalue l1 of multiplicity m 
 n. In 
this case, the general solution of the system contains the linear combination
 
c1K1el1t  c2K2el1t  p  cmKmel1t.

 (ii) If there is only one eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue l1 of multiplicity 
m, then m linearly independent solutions of the form

 Eigenvalue of Multiplicity Two We begin by considering eigenvalues of multiplicity 
two. In the first example we illustrate a matrix for which we can find two distinct eigenvectors 
corresponding to a repeated eigenvalue.

The matrix of coefficients A in Example 3 is a special kind of matrix known as a symmetric 
matrix. An n  n matrix A is said to be symmetric if its transpose AT (where the rows and col-
umns are interchanged) is the same as A; that is, if AT  A. It can be proved that if the matrix 
A in the system X  AX is symmetric and has real entries, then we can always find n linearly 
independent eigenvectors K1, K2, … , Kn, and the general solution of such a system is as given 
in Theorem 10.2.1. As illustrated in Example 3, this result holds even when some of the eigen-
values are repeated.
 Second Solution Now suppose that l1 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity two and that there 
is only one eigenvector associated with this value. A second solution can be found of the form
 
X2  Ktel1t  Pel1t, 
(12)
where 
K  ±

To see this we substitute (12) into the system X  AX and simplify:
 
(AK 2 l1K)tel1t  (AP 2 l
 1P 2 K)el1t  0.
Since this last equation is to hold for all values of t, we must have
 
(A  l1I)K  0 
(13)
and 
     (A  l1I)P  K. 
(14)
Equation (13) simply states that K must be an eigenvector of A associated with l1. By solving 
(13), we find one solution X1  Kel1t. To find the second solution X2 we need only solve the 
additional system (14) for the vector P.

2p1 2 16p2  1.
Since this system is obviously equivalent to one equation, we have an infinite number of choices 
for p1 and p2. For example, by choosing p1  1 we find p2  1

shall choose p1  1

By assigning various values to c1 and c2 in the solution in Example 4, we can plot trajectories 
of the system in (10). A phase portrait of (10) is given in FIGURE 10.2.3. The solutions X1 and X1
determine two half-lines y  1
3x, x  0, and y  1
3x, x 	 0, respectively, that are shown in red in 
Figure 10.2.3. Because the single eigenvalue is negative and e3t S 0 as t S q on every trajectory, 
we have (x(t), y(t)) S (0, 0) as t S q. This is why the arrowheads in Figure 10.2.3 indicate that a 
particle on any trajectory would move toward the origin as time increases and why the origin is an 
attractor in this case. Moreover, a moving particle on a trajectory x  3c1e3t  c2(te3t  1
2e3t), 
y  c1e3t  c2te3t, c2  0, approaches (0, 0) tangentially to one of the half-lines as t S q. In 
contrast, when the repeated eigenvalue is positive the situation is reversed and the origin is a 
repeller. See Problem 23 in Exercises 10.2. Analogous to Figure 10.2.2, Figure 10.2.3 is typical 
of all 2  2 homogeneous linear systems X  AX that have repeated negative eigenvalues. See 
Problem 34 in Exercises 10.2.
 Eigenvalue of Multiplicity Three When the coefficient matrix A has only one eigen-
vector associated with an eigenvalue l1 of multiplicity three, we can find a solution of the form 
(12) and a third solution of the form

    (A  l1I)P  K 
(17)

If l1  a  ib and l2  a  ib, b  0, i 2  1, are complex eigenvalues of the coefficient

We can verify by means of the Wronskian that these solution vectors are linearly independent, 
and so the general solution of (19) is
 
X  c1 a
1
1 2 2ib  e(52i) t  c2 a
1
1  2ib  e(522i) t. 
(20)
Note that the entries in K2 corresponding to l2 are the conjugates of the entries in K1 cor-
responding to l1. The conjugate of l1 is, of course, l2. We write this as l2  l1 and K2  K1. 
We have illustrated the following general result.
REMARKS
When an eigenvalue l1 has multiplicity m, then we can either find m linearly independent eigen-
vectors or the number of corresponding eigenvectors is less than m. Hence the two cases listed 
on pages 602 and 603 are not all the possibilities under which a repeated eigenvalue can occur. 
It could happen, say, that a 5  5 matrix has an eigenvalue of multiplicity 5 and there exist three 
corresponding linearly independent eigenvectors. See Problems 33 and 53 in Exercises 10.2.
*When the characteristic equation has real coefficients, complex eigenvalues always appear in conjugate 
pairs.
†Note that the second equation in the system is simply 1  2i  times the first equation.
Theorem 10.2.2 
Solutions Corresponding to a Complex Eigenvalue
Let A be the coefficient matrix having real entries of the homogeneous system (2), and let K1 
be an eigenvector corresponding to the complex eigenvalue l1  a  ib, a and b real. Then
 
 K1el1t and K1el1t  
are solutions of (2).

 
10.2 Homogeneous Linear Systems 
| 607
It is desirable and relatively easy to rewrite a solution such as (20) in terms of real functions. 
To this end we first use Euler’s formula to write
 
e(52i)t  e5te2ti  e5t(cos 2t  i sin 2t)
 
e(52i)t  e5te2ti  e5t(cos 2t  i sin 2t).
Then, after we multiply complex numbers, collect terms, and replace c1  c2 by C1 and (c1  c2)i 
by C2, (20) becomes
 
X  C1X1  C2X2, 
(21)
where 
X1  c a1
1b  cos 2t 2 a
0
2b  sin 2td e5t  a
cos 2t
cos 2t  2 sin 2tbe5t
and 
X2  c a
0
2b  cos 2t  a1
1b  sin 2td e5t  a
sin 2t
2 cos 2t  sin 2tbe5t.
It is now important to realize that the two vectors X1 and X2 in (21) are themselves linearly 
independent real solutions of the original system. Consequently, we are justified in ignoring 
the relationship between C1, C2 and c1, c2, and we can regard C1 and C2 as completely arbitrary 
and real. In other words, the linear combination (21) is an alternative general solution of (19).
The foregoing process can be generalized. Let K1 be an eigenvector of the coefficient 
matrix A (with real entries) corresponding to the complex eigenvalue l1  a  ib. Then the two 
solution vectors in Theorem 10.2.2 can be written as
 
K1el1t  K1eateibt  K1eat(cos bt  i sin bt)
 
K1el1t  K1eateibt  K1eat(cos bt 2 i sin bt).
By the superposition principle, Theorem 10.1.2, the following vectors are also solutions:
 
 X1  1
2 (K1el1t  K1el1t )  1
2 (K1  K1) eat
 cos bt 2 i
2 (K1  K1) eat
 sin bt
 
 X2  i
2 (K1el1t  K1el1t
 )  i
2 (K1  K1) eat
 cos bt  1
2 (K1  K1) eat
 sin bt.
For any complex number z  a  ib, both 1
2 (z  z )  a and i
2
 (z  z )  b are real numbers. 
Therefore, the entries in the column vectors 1
2 (K1  K1) and i
2 (K1  K1) are real numbers. 
By defining
 
B1  1
2 (K1  K1) and B2  i
2 (K1  K1), 
(22)
we are led to the following theorem.
Theorem 10.2.3 
Real Solutions Corresponding to a Complex Eigenvalue
Let l1  a  ib be a complex eigenvalue of the coefficient matrix A in the homogeneous 
system (2), and let B1 and B2 denote the column vectors defined in (22). Then
 
X1  [B1 cos bt  B2 sin bt]eat 
(23)
 
X2  [B2 cos bt  B1 sin bt]eat
are linearly independent solutions of (2) on (q, q).

The matrices B1 and B2 in (22) are often denoted by
B1  Re(K1)  and  B2  Im(K1) 
(24)
since these vectors are, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvector K1. For

k1  (2  2i )k2  0
gives k1  (2  2i)k2. By choosing k2  1 we get

Now from (24) we form

Some graphs of the curves or trajectories defined by the solution (26) of the system are illustrated

in which each x9i  is expressed as a linear combination of x1, x2, … , xn is said to be coupled. If the 
coefficient matrix A is diagonalizable, then the system can be uncoupled in that each x9i  can be 
expressed solely in terms of xi.
If the matrix A has n linearly independent eigenvectors then we know from Theorem 8.12.2 
that we can find a matrix P such that P1AP  D, where D is a diagonal matrix. If we make the 
substitution X  PY in the system X  AX, then

of these linear equations is yi  cieli t, i  1, 2, … , n. Hence the general solution of (3) can be

Solution by diagonalization will always work provided we can find n linearly independent 
eigenvectors of the n  n matrix A; the eigenvalues of A could be real and distinct, complex, or 
repeated. The method fails when A has repeated eigenvalues and n linearly independent eigen-
vectors cannot be found. Of course, in this last situation A is not diagonalizable.
Since we have to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, this method is essentially equivalent 
to the procedure presented in the last section.
In the next section we shall see that diagonalization can also be used to solve nonhomogeneous 
linear systems X  AX  F(t).

CHAPTER 10 Systems of Linear First-Order Differential Equations
10.4 Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems
INTRODUCTION The methods of undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters
used in Chapter 3 to find particular solutions of nonhomogeneous linear ODEs can both be adapted 
to the solution of nonhomogeneous linear systems. Of the two methods, variation of parameters 
is the more powerful technique. However, there are instances when the method of undetermined 
coefficients provides a quick means of finding a particular solution.
In Section 10.1, we saw that the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear system 
X  AX  F(t) on an interval I is X  Xc  Xp where Xc  c1X1  c2X2  p  cnXn is 
the complementary function or general solution of the associated homogeneous linear system 
X  AX and Xp is any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system. We just saw how 
to obtain Xc in Section 10.2 when A was an n  n matrix of constants; we now consider three 
methods for obtaining Xp.
10.4.1  Undetermined Coefficients
 The Assumptions As in Section 3.4, the method of undetermined coefficients con-
sists of making an educated guess about the form of a particular solution vector Xp; the guess 
is motivated by the types of functions that comprise the entries of the column matrix F(t). Not 
surprisingly, the matrix version of undetermined coefficients is only applicable to X  AX  F(t) 
when the entries of A are constants and the entries of F(t) are constants, polynomials, exponential 
functions, sines and cosines, or finite sums and products of these functions.
EXAMPLE 1 
Undetermined Coefficients
Solve the system X  a1
2
1
1b X  a8
3b on the interval (q, q).
SOLUTION We first solve the associated homogeneous system
 
X9  a1
2
1
1b X.
The characteristic equation of the coefficient matrix A,
 
 det (A 2 lI)  21 2 l
2
1
1 2 l 2  l2  1  0,
yields the complex eigenvalues l1  i and l2  l1  i. By the procedures of Section 10.2, 
we find
 
Xc  c1 a
 cos t 
 sin t
 cos t
b  c2 a
 cos t 2
 sin t
 sin t
b.
Now since F(t) is a constant vector, we assume a constant particular solution vector Xp  aa1
b1
b . 
Substituting this latter assumption into the original system and equating entries leads to
 
 0  a1  2b1 2 8
 
 0  a1  2b1  3.
Solving this algebraic system gives a1  14 and b1  11, and so a particular solution is 
Xp  a14
11b . The general solution of the original system of differential equations on the 
interval (q, q) is then X  Xc  Xp or
 
X  c1 a

Now because F(t) can be written F(t)  a
6

4b we shall try to find a particular 
solution of the system that possesses the same form:
 
Xp  aa2

Substituting this last assumption into the given system yields

(4a2  3b2 2 10) t  4a1  3b1 2 b2  4b.
From the last identity we obtain four algebraic equations in four unknowns:
 
6a2  1b2  16  0
4a2  3b2 2 10  0  and  6a1  1b1 2 a2  4  0
4a1  3b1 2 b2  4  0.
Solving the first two equations simultaneously yields a2  2 and b2  6. We then substi-
tute these values into the last two equations and solve for a1 and b1. The results are a1  4
7, 
b1  10
7 . It follows, therefore, that a particular solution vector is
 
Xp  a2

10.4.2  Variation of Parameters
 A Fundamental Matrix If X1, X2, … , Xn is a fundamental set of solutions of the homo-
geneous system X  AX on an interval I, then its general solution on the interval is the linear 
combination X  c1X1  c2X2  p  cnXn , or

The last matrix in (1) is recognized as the product of an n  n matrix with an n  1 matrix. In 
other words, the general solution (1) can be written as the product
 
X  (t)C, 
(2)
where C is the n  1 column vector of arbitrary constants c1, c2, … , cn, and (t) is the n  n 
matrix whose columns consist of the entries of the solution vectors of the system X  AX:

The matrix (t) is called a fundamental matrix of the system on the interval.
REMARKS
The method of undetermined coefficients for linear systems is not as straightforward as the 
last three examples would seem to indicate. In Section 3.4, the form of a particular solution yp 
was predicated on prior knowledge of the complementary function yc. The same is true for the 
formation of Xp. But there are further difficulties; the special rules governing the form of yp in 
Section 3.4 do not quite carry to the formation of Xp. For example, if F(t) is a constant vector as 
in Example 1 and l  0 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity one, then Xc contains a constant vector. 
Under the “multiplication rule” on page 132, we would ordinarily try a particular solution 
of the form Xp  aa1
b1
b t. This is not the proper assumption for linear systems; it should be 
Xp  aa2
b2
b  t  aa1
b1
b . Similarly, in Example 3, if we replace et in F(t) by e2t (l  2 is an 
eigenvalue), then the correct form of the particular solution vector is
 
Xp  aa4
b4
b  te2t  aa3
b3
b  e2t  aa2
b2
b  t  aa1
b1
b  .
Rather than delve into these difficulties, we turn instead to the method of variation of parameters.

10.4 Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems

617
In the discussion that follows, we need to use two properties of a fundamental matrix:
• A fundamental matrix (t) is nonsingular.
• If (t) is a fundamental matrix of the system X  AX, then
(t)  A(t). 
(3)
A reexamination of (9) of Theorem 10.1.3 shows that det (t) is the same as the Wronskian 
W(X1, X2, … , Xn). Hence the linear independence of the columns of (t) on the interval I guar-
antees that det (t)  0 for every t in the interval. Since (t) is nonsingular, the multiplicative 
inverse 1(t) exists for every t in the interval. The result given in (3) follows immediately from 
the fact that every column of (t) is a solution vector of X  AX.
 Variation of Parameters Analogous to the procedure in Section 3.5, we ask whether 
it is possible to replace the matrix of constants C in (2) by a column matrix of functions
U(t)  ±
u1(t)
u2(t)
(
un(t)
≤  so that  Xp  (t)U(t) 
(4)
is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system
 
X  AX  F(t). 
(5)
By the Product Rule, the derivative of the last expression in (4) is
 
Xp  (t)U(t)  (t)U(t). 
(6)
Note that the order of the products in (6) is very important. Since U(t) is a column matrix, the 
products U(t)(t) and U(t)(t) are not defined. Substituting (4) and (6) into (5) gives
(t)U(t)  (t)U(t)  A(t)U(t)  F(t). 
(7)
Now if we use (3) to replace (t), (7) becomes
(t)U(t)  A(t)U(t)  A(t)U(t)  F(t)
or 
  (t)U(t)  F(t). 
(8)
Multiplying both sides of equation (8) by 1(t) gives
 
U(t)  1(t)F(t)  and so   U(t)  #1(t)F(t) dt.
Since Xp  (t)U(t), we conclude that a particular solution of (5) is
Xp  (t) #1(t)F(t) dt. 
(9)
To calculate the indefinite integral of the column matrix 1(t)F(t) in (9), we integrate each 
entry. Thus the general solution of the nonhomogeneous system (5) is X  Xc  Xp or
 
X  (t)C  (t) #1(t)F(t) dt.

det(A  lI)  23 2 l

4 2 l 2  (l  2)(l  5)  0,
so the eigenvalues are l1  2 and l2  5. By the usual method we find that the eigenvectors 
corresponding to l1 and l2 are, respectively,
 
a1

The solution vectors of the homogeneous system (12) are then

e2tb  and  X2  a

2b  e5t  a

The entries in X1 form the first column of (t), and the entries in X2 form the second column

(13)
where t and t0 are points in the interval. The last form is useful in solving (5) subject to an initial

vanishes at t  t0. Substituting t  t0 in (13) yields X0  (t0)C, from which we get C  1(t0)X0.

10.4.3  Diagonalization
 The Assumptions As in Section 10.3, if the coefficient matrix A possesses n linearly in-
dependent eigenvectors, then we can use diagonalization to uncouple the system X  AX  F(t). 
Suppose P is the matrix such that P1AP  D, where D is a diagonal matrix. Substituting X  PY 
into the nonhomogeneous system X  AX  F(t) gives
 
PY  APY  F  or  Y  P1APY  P1F  or  Y  DY  G. 
(15)
In the last equation in (15), G  P1F is a column vector. So each differential equation in this new 
system has the form y9i   li yi  gi(t), i  1, 2, … , n. But notice that, unlike the procedure for solv-
ing a homogeneous system X  AX, we now are required to compute the inverse of the matrix P.

10.5 Matrix Exponential
INTRODUCTION Matrices can be used in an entirely different manner to solve a system 
of linear first-order differential equations. Recall that the simple linear first-order differential 
equation x  ax, where a is a constant, has the general solution x  ceat. It seems natural, then, 
to ask whether we can define a matrix exponential eAt, where A is a matrix of constants, so that 
eAt is a solution of the system X  AX.
 Homogeneous Systems We shall now see that it is possible to define a matrix expo-
nential eAt so that the homogeneous system X  AX, where A is an n  n matrix of constants, 
has a solution
 
X  eAtC. 
(1)
Since C is to be an n  1 column matrix of arbitrary constants, we want eAt to be an n  n matrix. 
While the complete development of the meaning and theory of the matrix exponential would 
require a thorough knowledge of matrix algebra, one way of defining eAt is inspired by the power 
series representation of the scalar exponential function eat:
 
eat  1  at  a2 t

2!  p  am t

m!  p  a

CHAPTER 10 Systems of Linear First-Order Differential Equations
The series in (2) converges for all t. Using this series, with 1 replaced by the identity I and the constant 
a replaced with an n  n matrix A of constants, we arrive at a definition for the n  n matrix eAt.
Definition 10.5.1

For any n  n matrix A,
eAt  I  At  A2 t

(3)
It can be shown that the series given in (3) converges to an n  n matrix for every value of t. 
Also, in (3), A0  I, A2  AA, A3  A(A2), and so on.

In view of (2) and the identifications a  2 and a  3, the power series in the first and second 
rows of the last matrix represent, respectively, e2t and e3t and so we have
eAt  ae2t

e3tb.
The matrix in Example 1 is an example of a 2  2 diagonal matrix. In general, an n  n 
matrix A is a diagonal matrix if all its entries off the main diagonal are zero; that is,

10.5 Matrix Exponential 
| 623
 Derivative of e At The derivative of the matrix exponential eAt is analogous to that of the 
scalar exponential; that is, d/dt eat  aeat. To justify
 
d
dt eAt  AeAt 
(4)
we differentiate (3) term-by-term:
 
 d
dt eAt  d

m!  pd  A  A2t  A3 t2
2!  p
 
 
  A cI  At  A2 t
 2
2!  pd  AeAt.
Because of (4), we can now prove that (1) is a solution of X  AX for every n  1  vector C 
of constants:
 
X  d
dt eAtC  AeAtC  A(eAtC)  AX. 
(5)
 e At Is a Fundamental Matrix If we denote the matrix exponential eAt by the symbol 
(t), then (4) is equivalent to the matrix differential equation (t)  A (see (3) of Section 10.4). In 
addition, it follows immediately from Definition 10.5.1 that (0)  eA0  I and so det (0)  0. 
It turns out that these two properties are sufficient for us to conclude that (t) is a fundamental 
matrix of the system X  AX.
 Nonhomogeneous Systems We have seen in (4) of Section 2.3 that the general solu-
tion of the single linear first-order differential equation x  ax  f (t), where a is a constant, can 
be expressed as
 
x  xc  xp  ceat  eat#
t
t0
eas  f (s) ds.
For a nonhomogeneous system of linear first-order differential equations, it can be shown that 
the general solution of X  AX  F(t), where A is an n  n matrix of constants, is
 
X  Xc  Xp  eAtC  eAt#
t
t0
eAs  F(s) ds. 
(6)
Since the matrix exponential eAt is a fundamental matrix, it is always nonsingular and eAs  (eAs)1. 
Note that eAs can be obtained from eAt by replacing t by s.
 Computation of e At The definition of eAt given in (3) can, of course, always be used 
to compute eAt. However, the practical utility of (3) is limited by the fact that the entries in eAt 
are power series in t. With one’s natural desire to work with simple and familiar things, we 
then try to recognize whether these series define a closed form function. See Problems 1–4 in 
Exercises 10.5. Fortunately there are many alternative ways of computing eAt. We sketch two of 
these methods in the discussion that follows.
 Using the Laplace Transform We saw in (5) that X  eAt is a solution of X  AX. 
Indeed, since eA0  I, X  eAt is a solution of the initial-value problem
 
X  AX,  X(0)  I. 
(7)
If x(s)  +{X(t)}  +{eAt}, then the Laplace transform of (7) is
 
sx(s)  X(0)  Ax(s)  or  (sI  A)x(s)  I.
Multiplying the last equation by (sI  A)1 implies x(s)  (sI  A)1I  (sI  A)1. In other 
words, +{eAt}  (sI  A)1 or
 
eA t  +1{(sI  A)1}.

 Using Powers Am In Section 8.9, we developed a method for computing an arbitrary 
power Ak, k a nonnegative integer, of an n  n matrix A. Recall from Section 8.9 that we 
can write
Ak  a
n21
j0
cjAj  and  lk  a
n21
j0
cjlj, 
(10)
where the coefficients cj are the same in each and the last expression is valid for the eigen-
values l1, l2, … , ln of A. We assume here that the eigenvalues of A are distinct. By setting 
l  l1, l2, … , ln in the second expression in (10), we were able to find the cj in the first expres-
sion by solving n equations in n unknowns. It will be convenient in the development that follows 
to emphasize the fact that the coefficients cj in (10) depend on the power k by replacing cj by 
cj (k). From (3) and (2), we have
eAt  a
q
k0
Ak t
 k
k!  and  elt  a
q
k0
lk t

(11)
We next use (10) in (11) to replace Ak and lk as finite sums followed by an interchange of the 
order of summations

determine the cj, we again use the eigenvalues, but this time in the finite sum (13) to deter-
mine a system of equations to determine the bj; these coefficients, in turn, are used in (12) to 
determine eAt.

SOLUTION We have already seen the matrix A in Section 8.9, and there we found its eigen-
values to be l1  1 and l2  2. Now since A is a 2  2 matrix, we have from (12) and (13)
 
eAt  b0I  b1A  and  elt  b0  b1l. 
(14)
Setting l  1 and l  2 in the second equation of (14) gives two equations in the two 
unknowns b0 and b1. Solving the system
 
et  b0  b1
 
       e2t  b0  2b1
yields b0  1
3[e2t  2et], b1  1
3[e2t  et]. Substituting these values in the first equation of 
(14) and simplifying the entries yields

In Problems 23–26 in Exercises 10.5, we show how to compute the matrix exponential eAt 
when the matrix A is diagonalizable (see Section 8.12).
 Use of Computers For those willing to momentarily trade understanding for speed of 
solution, eAt can be computed with the aid of computer software; for example, in Mathematica, 
the function MatrixExp[A t] computes the matrix exponential for a square matrix A; in Maple, 
the command is exponential(A, t); in MATLAB the function is expm(At). See Problems 27 
and 28 in Exercises 10.5.

In Chapter 10 we used matrix 
techniques to solve systems 
of linear first-order differential 
equations of the form X  
AX  F(t). When a system of 
differential equations is not 
linear, it is usually not possible 
to find solutions that can be 
expressed in terms of elementary 
functions.  In this chapter we 
will see that valuable 
information about the geometric 
nature of solutions can be 
obtained by first analyzing 
special constant solutions called 
critical points and then 
searching for periodic solutions 
called limit cycles. The 
important concept of stability 
will be introduced and illustrated 
with examples from physics and 
biology.

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
11.1 
Autonomous Systems
INTRODUCTION 
We introduced the notions of autonomous first-order DEs, critical points of 
an autonomous DE, and the stability of a critical point in Section 2.1. This earlier consideration of 
stability was purposely kept at a fairly intuitive level; it is now time to give the precise definition 
of this concept. To do this we need to examine autonomous systems of first-order DEs. In this 
section we define critical points of autonomous systems of two first-order DEs; the autonomous 
systems can be linear or nonlinear.
 Autonomous Systems A system of first-order differential equations is called autono-
mous when the system can be written in the form
dx1
dt   g1(x1, x2, … , xn)
dx2
dt   g2(x1, x2, … , xn) 
(1)
(  
(
 
  dxn
dt   gn(x1, x2, … , xn).
Notice that the independent variable t does not appear explicitly on the right-hand side of each 
differential equation. Compare (1) with the general system given in (2) of Section 10.1.

is not autonomous because of the presence of t on the right-hand side of both DEs.
When n  1 in (1) a single first-order differential equation takes on the form dx/dt  g(x). 
This last equation is equivalent to (1) of Section 2.1 with the symbols x and t playing the parts 
of y and x, respectively. Explicit solutions can be constructed since the differential equation 
dx/dt  g(x) is separable, and we will make use of this fact to give illustrations of the concepts 
in this chapter.
 Second-Order DE as a System Any autonomous second-order differential equation 
x  g(x, x) can be written as an autonomous system. As we did in Section 3.7, if we let y  x, then 
x0  g(x, x9) becomes y  g(x, y). Thus the second-order differential equation becomes the system 
of two first-order equations
 
x  y
 
y  g(x, y).
See page 150.

11.1 Autonomous Systems

EXAMPLE 2 
The Pendulum DE as an Autonomous System
In (6) of Section 3.11 we showed that the displacement angle u for a pendulum satisfies the 
nonlinear second-order differential equation
d
 2u
dt
 2  g
l  sin u  0.
If we let x  u and y  u, this second-order differential equation can be rewritten as the 
autonomous system
 
 x9  y
 
 y9  g
l  sin x.
 Matrix Forms of (1) If X(t) and g(X) denote the respective column vectors
 
X(t)  ±
x1(t)
x2(t)
(
xn(t)
≤, g(X)  ±
g1(x1, x2, p  , xn)
g2(x1, x2, p  , xn)
(
gn(x1, x2, p  , xn)
≤,
then the autonomous system (1) may be written in the compact column vector form X  g(X). 
The homogeneous linear system X  AX studied in Section 10.2 is an important special case.
In this chapter it is also convenient to write (1) using row vectors. If we let
 
X(t)  (x1(t), x2(t), … , xn(t))
and 
g(X)  (g1(x1, x2, … , xn), g2(x1, x2, … , xn), … , gn(x1, x2, … , xn)),
then the autonomous system (1) can also be written in the compact row vector form 
X  g(X). It should be clear from the context whether we are using column or row vec-
tor form, and therefore we will not distinguish between X and XT, the transpose of X. In 
particular, when n  2 it is convenient to use row vector form and write an initial condition 
as X(0)  (x0, y0).
When the variable t is interpreted as time, we can refer to the system of differential equations 
in (1) as a dynamical system and a solution X(t) as the state of the system or the response of 
the system at time t. With this terminology, a dynamical system is autonomous when the rate 
X(t) at which the system changes depends only on the system’s present state X(t). The linear 
system X  AX  F(t) studied in Chapter 10 is then autonomous when F(t) is constant. In the 
case n  2 or 3 we call a solution a path or trajectory since we may think of x  x1(t), y  x2(t), 
z  x3(t) as parametric equations of a curve.
 Vector Field Interpretation When n  2 the system in (1) is called a plane autono-
mous system, and we write the system as
 
dx
dt   P(x, y)
 
   dy
dt   Q(x, y).
The vector V(x, y)  (P(x, y), Q(x, y)) defines a vector field in a region of the plane, and 
a solution to the system may be interpreted as the resulting path of a particle as it moves 
through the region. To be more specific, let V(x, y)  (P(x, y), Q(x, y)) denote the velocity 
of a stream at position (x, y), and suppose that a small particle (such as a cork) is released 
at a position (x0, y0) in the stream. If X(t)  (x(t), y(t)) denotes the position of the particle at 
time t, then X(t)  (x(t), y(t)) is the velocity vector v. When external forces are not present 
and frictional forces are neglected, the velocity of the particle at time t is the velocity of the

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
stream at position X(t); that is, X(t)  V(x(t), y(t)), or
 
 dx
dt  P(x(t), y(t))
 
 dy
dt  Q(x(t), y(t)).
Thus the path of the particle is a solution to the system that satisfies the initial condition 
X(0)  (x0, y0). We will frequently call on this simple interpretation of a plane autonomous 
system to illustrate new concepts.
EXAMPLE 3 
Plane Autonomous System of a Vector Field
A vector field for the steady-state flow of a fluid around a cylinder of radius 1 is given by
 
V(x, y)  V0a1 2
x2 2 y2
(x
 2  y2)2,  
2xy
(x
 2  y2)2b  ,
where V0 is the speed of the fluid far from the cylinder. If a small cork is released at (3, 1), 
the path X(t)  (x(t), y(t)) of the cork satisfies the plane autonomous system
 
 dx

x

 dy
dt  V0

 2  y2)2
subject to the initial condition X(0)  (3, 1). See FIGURE 11.1.1.
 Types of Solutions If P(x, y), Q(x, y), and the first-order partial derivatives 0P/0x, 
0P/0y, 0Q/0x, and 0Q/0y are continuous in a region R of the plane, then a solution to the plane 
autonomous system
 
 dx
dt  P(x, y)
 
 dy
dt  Q(x, y)
that satisfies X(0)  X0 is unique and one of three basic types:
 (i) A constant solution x(t)  x0, y(t)  y0 (or X(t)  X0 for all t). A constant solution is called 
a critical or stationary point. When the particle is placed at a critical point X0 (that is, 
X(0)  X0), it remains there indefinitely. For this reason a constant solution is also called 
an equilibrium solution. Note that since X(t)  0, a critical point is a solution of the 
system of algebraic equations
 
P(x, y)  0
 
 Q(x, y)  0.
 (ii) A solution x  x(t), y  y(t) defines an arc—a plane curve that does not cross itself. Thus 
the curve in FIGURE 11.1.2(a) can be a solution to a plane autonomous system, whereas the 
curve in Figure 11.1.2(b) cannot be a solution. There would be two solutions that start from 
the point P of intersection.
 (iii) A periodic solution x  x(t), y  y(t). A periodic solution is called a cycle. If p is the 
period of the solution, then X(t  p)  X(t) and a particle placed on the curve at X0 will 
cycle around the curve and return to X0 in p units of time. See FIGURE 11.1.3.

SOLUTION We find the critical points by setting the right-hand side of the differential equa-
tions equal to zero.
(a) The solution to the system
 
x  y  0
 
       x  y  0
consists of all points on the line y  x. Thus there are infinitely many critical points.
(b) To solve the system
 
x2  y2  6  0
 
    x2  y  0
we substitute the second equation, x2  y, into the first equation to obtain y2  y  6  
( y  3) ( y  2)  0. If y  3, then x2  3, and so there are no real solutions. If y  2, 
then x  !2, and so the critical points are ( !2, 2) and (!2, 2).
(c) Finding the critical points requires a careful consideration of cases. The equation 
0.01x(100  x  y)  0 implies x  0 or x  y  100.
If x  0, then substituting in 0.05y(60  y  0.2x)  0 we have y(60  y)  0. Thus 
y  0 or 60, and so (0, 0) and (0, 60) are critical points.
If x  y  100, then 0  y(60  y  0.2(100  y))  y(40  0.8y). It follows that y  0 
or 50, and so (100, 0) and (50, 50) are critical points.
When the plane autonomous system is linear, we can use the methods in Chapter 10 to 
 investigate solutions.
EXAMPLE 5 
Discovering Periodic Solutions
Determine whether the given linear dynamical system possesses a periodic solution.
(a) x  2x  8y 
  (b)  x  x  2y
 
y  x  2y 
      y  1
2x  y
In each case sketch the graph of the solution that satisfies X(0)  (2, 0).
SOLUTION (a) In Example 6 of Section 10.2 we used the eigenvalue–eigenvector method 
to show that
 
x  c1(2 cos 2t  2 sin 2t)  c2(2 cos 2t  2 sin 2t)
 
y  c1(cos 2t)  c2 sin 2t.
Thus every solution is periodic with period p  p. The solution satisfying X(0)  (2, 0) is 
x  2 cos 2t  2 sin 2t, y  sin 2t. This solution generates the ellipse shown in FIGURE 
11.1.4(a).
(b) Using the eigenvalue–eigenvector method, we can show that
 
x  c1(2et cos t)  c2(2et sin t), y  c1(et sin t)  c2(et cos t).
Because of the presence of et in the general solution, there are no periodic solutions (that is, 
cycles). The solution satisfying X(0)  (2, 0) is x  2et cos t, y  et sin t, and the resulting 
curve is shown in Figure 11.1.4(b).
 Changing to Polar Coordinates Except for the case of constant solutions, it is usually 
not possible to find explicit expressions for the solutions of a nonlinear autonomous system. We 
can solve some nonlinear systems, however, by changing to polar coordinates. From the formulas 
r 2  x 2  y2 and u  tan1( y/x) we obtain
 
dr
dt  1
r ax dx
dt  y dy
dt b, du

r 2 ay dx

We can sometimes use (2) to convert a plane autonomous system in rectangular coordinates to 
a simpler system in polar coordinates.

r (0)  !2 and u(0)  p/4. Using separation of variables, we see that the solution of the 
system is

Find and sketch the solutions satisfying X(0)  (0, 1) and X(0)  (3, 0) in rectangular

SOLUTION Applying separation of variables to dr/dt  0.5(3  r) and integrating du/dt
leads to the solution
 
r  3  c1e0.5t, u  t  c2.
If X(0)  (0, 1), then r (0)  1 and u(0)  p/2, and so c1  2 and c2  p/2. The solution 
curve is the spiral r  3  2e0.5(up/2). Note that as t S q, u increases without bound and 
r approaches 3.
If X(0)  (3, 0), then r(0)  3 and u(0)  0. It follows that c1  c2  0, and so r  3 
and u  t. Hence x  r cos u  3 cos t and y  r sin u  3 sin t, and so the solution is 
periodic. The solution generates a circle of radius 3 about (0, 0). Both solutions are shown 
in FIGURE 11.1.6.

Stability of Linear Systems
INTRODUCTION 
We have seen that the plane autonomous system
 
 dx
dt  P(x, y)
 
 dy
dt  Q(x, y)
gives rise to a vector field V(x, y)  (P(x, y), Q(x, y)), and a solution X  X(t) of the system 
may be interpreted as the resulting path of a particle that is initially placed at position 
X(0)  X0. If X0 is a critical point of the system, then the particle remains stationary. In this 
section we examine the behavior of solutions when X0 is chosen close to a critical point of 
the system.
 Some Fundamental Questions Suppose that X1 is a critical point of a plane autono-
mous system and X  X(t) is a solution of the system that satisfies X(0)  X0. If the solution 
is interpreted as a path of a moving particle, we are interested in the answers to the following 
questions when X0 is placed near X1:
 (i) Will the particle return to the critical point? More precisely, if X  X(t) is the solution that 
satisfies X(0)  X0, is limtSq X(t)  X1?
 (ii) If the particle does not return to the critical point, does it remain close to the critical point 
or move away from the critical point? It is conceivable, for example, that the particle may 
simply circle the critical point, or it may even return to a different critical point or to no 
critical point at all. See FIGURE 11.2.1.
If in some neighborhood of the critical point case (a) or (b) in Figure 11.2.1 always occurs, we 
call the critical point locally stable. If, however, an initial value X0 that results in behavior 
similar to (c) can be found in any given neighborhood, we call the critical point unstable. These 
concepts will be made more precise in Section 11.3, where questions (i) and (ii) will be investi-
gated for nonlinear systems.
 Stability Analysis We will first investigate these two stability questions for linear plane 
autonomous systems and lay the foundation for Section 11.3. The solution methods of Chapter 10 
enable us to give a careful geometric analysis of the solutions to
 
 x  ax  by
 
(1)
 
y  cx  dy
in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix
 
A  aa
b
c
db.
Here a, b, c, and d are constants. To ensure that X0  (0, 0) is the only critical point, we will 
assume that the determinant 
  ad  bc  0. If t  a  d is the trace* of matrix A, then the 
characteristic equation det (A  lI)  0 can be rewritten as
 
l2  tl  
  0.
Therefore the eigenvalues of A are l  (t  "t2 2 4D)/2, and the usual three cases for 
these roots occur according to whether t 2  4
 is positive, negative, or zero. In the next 
example we use a numerical solver to discover the nature of the solutions corresponding to 
these cases.
*In general, if A is an n  n matrix, the trace of A is the sum of the main diagonal entries.

EXAMPLE 1 
Eigenvalues and the Shape of Solutions
Find the eigenvalues of the linear system
 
x  x  y
 
y  cx  y
in terms of c, and use a numerical solver to discover the shapes of solutions corresponding to 
the cases c  1
4, 4, 0, and 9.
SOLUTION The coefficient matrix a1
1
c
1b has trace t  2 and determinant 
  1  c, 
and so the eigenvalues are
 
l  t  "t2 2 4D
2
 2  "4 2 4(1 2 c)
2
 1  "c.
The nature of the eigenvalues is therefore determined by the sign of c.
If c  1
4, then the eigenvalues are negative and distinct: l  1
2 and 3
2. In FIGURE 11.2.2(a) 
we have used a numerical solver to generate solution curves or trajectories that correspond to 
various initial conditions. Note that, except for the trajectories drawn in red in the figure, the 
trajectories all appear to approach 0 from a fixed direction. Recall from Chapter 10 that a col-
lection of trajectories in the xy-plane or phase plane is called a phase portrait of the system.
When c  4 the eigenvalues have opposite signs, l  1 and 3, and an interesting phe-
nomenon occurs. All trajectories move away from the origin in a fixed direction except for 
solutions that start along the single line drawn in red in Figure 11.2.2(b). We have already 
seen behavior like this in the phase portrait given in Figure 10.2.2. Experiment with your 
numerical solver and verify these observations.
The selection c  0 leads to a single real eigenvalue l  1. This case is very similar to 
the case c  1
4 with one notable exception. All solution curves in Figure 11.2.2(c) appear to 
approach 0 from a fixed direction as t increases.

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
Finally, when c  9, l  1  !9  1  3i. Thus the eigenvalues are conjugate 
complex numbers with negative real part 1. Figure 11.2.2(d) shows that solution curves 
spiral in toward the origin 0 as t increases.
The behaviors of the trajectories observed in the four phase portraits in Figure 11.2.2 
in Example 1 can be explained using the eigenvalue–eigenvector solution results from 
Chapter 10.
Case I: Real Distinct Eigenvalues (t 2  4
 	 0)
 
According to Theorem 10.2.1 in Section 10.2, the general solution of (1) is 
given by
X(t)  c1K1el1t  c2K2el2t,  
(2)
 
where l1 and l2 are the eigenvalues and K1 and K2 are the corresponding eigenvec-
tors. Note that X(t) can also be written as
 
       X(t)  el1tfc1K1  c2K2e(l22l1)tg. 
(3)
(a) Both eigenvalues negative (t 2  4
 	 0, t  0, and 
 	 0)
 
Stable Node (l2  l1  0): Since both eigenvalues are negative, it follows from (2) 
that limtSq  X(t)  0. If we assume that l2  l1, then l2  l1  0 and so e(l22l1) t is an 
exponential decay function. We may therefore conclude from (3) that X(t)  c1K1el1 t 
for large values of t. When c1  0, X(t) will approach 0 from one of the two directions 
determined by the eigenvector K1 corresponding to l1. If c1  0, X(t)  c2K2el2 t 
and X(t) approaches 0 along the line determined by the eigenvector K2. FIGURE 11.2.3 
shows a collection of solution curves around the origin. A critical point is called a 
stable node when both eigenvalues are negative.
 
(b) Both eigenvalues positive (t 2  4
 	 0, t 	 0, and 
 	 0)
 
 Unstable Node (0  l2  l1): The analysis for this case is similar to (a). Again 
from (2), X(t) becomes unbounded as t increases. Moreover, again assuming l2  l1 
and using (3), we see that X(t) becomes unbounded in one of the directions deter-
mined by the eigenvector K1 (when c1  0) or along the line determined by the 
eigenvector K2 (when c1  0). FIGURE 11.2.4 shows a typical collection of solution 
curves. This type of critical point, corresponding to the case when both eigenvalues 
are positive, is called an unstable node.
 
(c) Eigenvalues have opposite signs (t 2  4
 	 0 and 
  0)
 
Saddle Point (l2  0  l1): The analysis of the solutions is identical to (b) 
with one exception. When c1  0, X(t)  c2K2el2 t and, since l2  0, X(t) will 
approach 0 along the line determined by the eigenvector K2. If X(0) does 
not lie on the line determined by K2, the line determined by K1 serves as an 
asymptote for X(t). Thus the critical point is unstable even though some solutions 
approach 0 as t increases. This unstable critical point is called a saddle point. 
See FIGURE 11.2.5.
EXAMPLE 2 
Real Distinct Eigenvalues
Classify the critical point (0, 0) of each of the following linear systems X  AX as either a 
stable node, an unstable node, or a saddle point.

In each case discuss the nature of the solutions in a neighborhood of (0, 0).
SOLUTION (a)  Since the trace t  3 and the determinant 
  4, the eigenvalues are
 
  
l  t  "t
 2 2 4D
2
 3  "32 2 4(4)

The eigenvalues have opposite signs, and so (0, 0) is a saddle point. It is not hard to show 
(see Example 1, Section 10.2) that eigenvectors corresponding to l1  4 and l2  1 are
 
K1  a3
2b  and  K2  a
1
1b,
respectively. If X(0)  X0 lies on the line y  x, then X(t) approaches 0. For any 
other initial condition X(t) will become unbounded in the directions determined by K1. 
In other words, the line y  2
3x serves as an asymptote for all these solution curves. See 
FIGURE 11.2.6.
(b)  From t  29 and 
  100 it follows that the eigenvalues of A are l1  4 and l2  25. 
Both eigenvalues are negative, and so (0, 0) is in this case a stable node. Since eigenvectors 
corresponding to l1  4 and l2  25 are
 
K1  a1
1b  and  K2  a
2
5b,
respectively, it follows that all solutions approach 0 from the direction defined by K1 except 
those solutions for which X(0)  X0 lies on the line y  5
2x determined by K2. These solu-
tions approach 0 along y  5
2x. See FIGURE 11.2.7.
Case II: A Repeated Real Eigenvalue (t 2  4
  0)
 
Degenerate Nodes: Recall from Section 10.2 that the general solution takes on 
one of two different forms depending on whether one or two linearly independent 
eigenvectors can be found for the repeated eigenvalue l1.
 
(a) Two linearly independent eigenvectors
 
If K1 and K2 are two linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to l1, then 
the general solution is given by
 
      
X(t)  c1K1el1t  c2K2el1t  (c1K1  c2K2)el1t.
 
If l1  0, then X(t) approaches 0 along the line determined by the vector c1K1  c2K2 
and the critical point is called a degenerate stable node. See FIGURE 11.2.8(a). The 
arrows in Figure 11.2.8(a) are reversed when l1 	 0, and we have a degenerate 
unstable node.

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
(b) A single linearly independent eigenvector
 
 When only a single linearly independent eigenvector K1 exists, the general solution 
is given by
X(t)  c1K1el1t  c2(K1tel1t  Pel1t ), 
 
 where (A  l1I)P  K1 (see Section 10.2, (12)(14)), and the solution may be 
rewritten as
 
         
X(t)  tel1tcc2K1  c1
t  K1  c2
t  Pd .
 
If l1  0, then limtSq tel1 t 0 and it follows that X(t) approaches 0 in one of the 
directions determined by the vector K1 (see Figure 11.2.8(b)). The critical point is 
again called a degenerate stable node. When l1 	 0, the solutions look like those in 
Figure 11.2.8(b) with the arrows reversed. The line determined by K1 is an asymptote 
for all solutions. The critical point is again called a degenerate unstable node.
Case III: Complex Eigenvalues (t 2  4
  0)
 
If l1  a  ib and l1  a  ib are the complex eigenvalues and K1  B1  iB2
is a complex eigenvector corresponding to l1, the general solution can be written 
as X(t)  c1X1(t)  c2X2(t), where
         X1(t)  (B1 cos bt  B2 sin bt)eat and X2(t)  (B2 cos bt  B1 sin bt)eat.
 
See equations (23) and (24) in Section 10.2. A solution can therefore be written in 
the form
 
      x(t)  eat(c11 cos bt  c12 sin bt),  y(t)  eat(c21 cos bt  c22 sin bt), 
(4)
 
and when a  0 we have
 
           x(t)  c11 cos bt  c12 sin bt,  y(t)  c21 cos bt  c22 sin bt. 
(5)
 
(a) Pure imaginary roots (t 2  4
  0, t  0)
 
Center: When a  0, the eigenvalues are pure imaginary and, from (5), all solutions 
are periodic with period p  2p/b. Notice that if both c12 and c21 happened to be 0, 
then (5) would reduce to
 
      x(t)  c11 cos bt,  y(t)  c22 sin bt, 
 
which is a standard parametric representation for the ellipse x2/c2
11  y2/c2
22  1. By 
solving the system of equations in (4) for cos bt and sin bt and using the identity 
sin2  bt  cos2  bt  1, it is possible to show that all solutions are ellipses with cen-
ter at the origin. The critical point (0, 0) is called a center, and FIGURE 11.2.9 shows 
a typical collection of solution curves. The ellipses are either all traversed in the 
clockwise direction or all traversed in the counterclockwise direction.
 
(b) Nonzero real part (t 2  4
  0, t  0)
 
Spiral Points: When a  0, the effect of the term eat in (4) is similar to the effect of the 
exponential term in the analysis of damped motion given in Section 3.8. When a  0, 
eat S 0, and the elliptical-like solution spirals closer and closer to the origin. The critical 
point is called a stable spiral point. When a 	 0, the effect is the opposite. An elliptical-
like solution is driven farther and farther from the origin, and the critical point is now 
called an unstable spiral point. See FIGURE 11.2.10.

SOLUTION (a)  Since t  6 and 
  9, the characteristic polynomial is l2  6l  9  
(l  3)2, and so (0, 0) is a degenerate stable node. For the repeated eigenvalue l  3 we 
find a single eigenvector K1  a3
1b, and so the solution X(t) that satisfies X(0)  (1, 0) 
approaches (0, 0) from the direction specified by the line y  x/3.
(b) Since t  0 and 
  1, the eigenvalues are l  i, and so (0, 0) is a center. The 
solution X(t) that satisfies X(0)  (1, 0) is an ellipse that circles the origin every 2p units 
of time.
From Example 4 of Section 10.2 the general solution of the system in part (a) is 
 
X(t)  c1a3
1b  e3t  c2 c a3
1b  te3t  a

0b  e3td .
The initial condition gives c1  0 and c2  2, and so x  (6t  1)e3t, y  2te3t are parametric 
equations for the solution.
The general solution of the system in part (b) is
 
X(t)  c1a
 cos t 
 sin t

The initial condition gives c1  0 and c2  1, and so x  cos t  sin t, y  sin t are para-
metric equations for the ellipse. Note that y  0 for small positive values of t, and therefore 
the ellipse is traversed in the clockwise direction.
The solutions of parts (a) and (b) are shown in FIGURES 11.2.11(a) and 11.2.11(b), 
respectively.
 Classifying Critical Points 
FIGURE 11.2.12 conveniently summarizes the results of 
this section. The general geometric nature of the solutions can be determined by computing 
the trace and determinant of A. In practice, graphs of the solutions are most easily obtained 
not by constructing explicit eigenvalue–eigenvector solutions but rather by generating the 
solutions numerically using a numerical solver and a method such as the Runge–Kutta method 
for first-order systems (Section 6.4).

Stability Criteria for Linear Systems
For a linear plane autonomous system X  AX with det A 	 0, let X  X(t) denote the 
solution that satisfies the initial condition X(0)  X0, where X0 	 0.
(a) limtSq X(t)  0 if and only if the eigenvalues of A have negative real parts. This will 
occur when   0 and t  0.
(b) X(t) is periodic if and only if the eigenvalues of A are pure imaginary. This will 
occur when   0 and t  0.
(c) In all other cases, given any neighborhood of the origin, there is at least one X0 in the 
neighborhood for which X(t) becomes unbounded as t increases.

Linearization and Local Stability
 INTRODUCTION   The key idea in this section is that of  linearization . Recall from calculus 
and Section 2.6, a linearization of a differentiable function  f ( x ) at a number  x 1 is the equation of 
the  tangent line  to the graph of  f  at the point: 
 
 y  f (x1)  f9(x1)(x 2 x1).  
 For  x close to  x 1 the points on the graph of  f are close to the points on the tangent line so values  y ( x ) 
obtained from the equation of the tangent line are said to be  local linear approximations to the cor-
responding function values  f  ( x ). Similarly, a linearization of a function of two variables  f ( x, y ) that is 
differentiable at a point ( x 1 ,  y 1 ) is the equation of the  tangent plane  to the graph of  f  at the point:  
 
 z  f (x1, y1)  fx(x1, y1)(x 2 x1)  fy(x1, y1)(y 2 y1), 

644 
| CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
 where  f x and  f y are partial derivatives with respect to  x and  y , respectively. In this section we will 
use linearization as a means of analyzing nonlinear DEs and nonlinear systems; the idea is to 
replace them by linear DEs and linear systems. 
 Sliding Bead We start this section by refining the stability concepts introduced in 
Section 11.2 in such a way that they will apply to nonlinear autonomous systems as well. Although 
the linear system X  AX had only one critical point when det A  0, we saw in Section 11.1 
that a nonlinear system may have many critical points. We therefore cannot expect that a particle 
placed initially at X0 will remain near a given critical point X1 unless X0 has been placed suffi-
ciently close to X1 to begin with. The particle might well be driven to a second critical point X2. 
To emphasize this idea we will consider the physical system shown in FIGURE 11.3.1 in which a 
bead slides along the curve z  f (x) under the influence of gravity alone. We will show in Section 
11.4 that the x-coordinate of the bead satisfies a nonlinear second-order differential equation 
x   g(x, x), and therefore letting y  x satisfies the nonlinear autonomous system
 
x  y
 
y  g(x, y).
If the bead is positioned at P  (x,  f (x)) and given zero initial velocity, the bead will remain 
at P provided f (x)  0. If the bead is placed near the critical point located at x  x1, it will remain 
near x  x1 only if its initial velocity does not drive it over the “hump” at x  x2 toward the criti-
cal point located at x  x3. Therefore X(0)  (x(0), x(0)) must be near (x1, 0).
In the next definition we will denote the distance between two points X and Y by |X  Y|. 
Recall that if X  (x1, x2, … , xn) and Y  ( y1, y2  … , yn), then
 
|X  Y|  "(x1 2 y1)2  (x2 2 y2)2  p  (xn 2 yn)2.
Definition 11.3.1 
Stable Critical Points
Let X1 be a critical point of an autonomous system, and let X  X(t) denote the solution that 
satisfies the initial condition X(0)  X0, where X0  X1. We say that X1 is a stable critical 
point when, given any radius r 	 0, there is a corresponding radius r 	 0 such that if the 
initial position X0 satisfies |X0  X1|  r, then the corresponding solution X(t) satisfies 
|X(t)  X1|  r for all t 	 0. If, in addition, limtSq X(t)  X1 whenever |X0  X1|  r, we 
call X1 an asymptotically stable critical point.
This definition is illustrated in FIGURE 11.3.2(a). Given any disk of radius r about the critical 
point X1, a solution will remain inside this disk provided X(0)  X0 is selected sufficiently close 
to X1. It is not necessary that a solution approach the critical point in order for X1 to be stable. 
Stable nodes, stable spiral points, and centers are all examples of stable critical points for linear 
systems. To emphasize that X0 must be selected close to X1 the terminology locally stable critical 
point is also used.
By negating Definition 11.3.1 we obtain the definition of an unstable critical point.
Definition 11.3.2 
Unstable Critical Point
Let X1 be a critical point of an autonomous system, and let X  X(t) denote the solution 
that satisfies the initial condition X(0)  X0, where X0  X1. We say that X1 is an unstable 
critical point if there is a disk of radius r 	 0 with the property that, for any r 	 0, there 
is at least one initial position X0 that satisfies |X0  X1|  r, yet the corresponding solution 
X(t) satisfies |X(t)  X1|  r for at least one t 	 0.
If a critical point X1 is unstable, no matter how small the neighborhood about X1, an initial 
position X0 can always be found that results in the solution leaving some disk of radius r at some 
future time t. See Figure 11.3.2(b). Therefore unstable nodes, unstable spiral points, and saddle 
points are all examples of unstable critical points for linear systems. In Figure 11.3.1 the critical 
point (x2, 0) is unstable. The slightest displacement or initial velocity results in the bead sliding 
away from the point (x2, f (x2)).

SOLUTION In Example 6 of Section 11.1 we showed that in polar coordinates
r 

is the solution of the system. If X(0)  (r0, u0) is the initial condition in polar coordinates, then
 
r 
r0
r0t  1,  u  t  u0.
Note that r  r0 for t  0, and r approaches (0, 0) as t increases. Therefore, given r 	 0, a 
solution that starts less than r units from (0, 0) remains within r units of the origin for all t  0. 
Hence the critical point (0, 0) is stable and is in fact asymptotically stable. A typical solution 
is shown in FIGURE 11.3.3. 
EXAMPLE 2 
An Unstable Critical Point
When expressed in polar coordinates, a plane autonomous system takes the form
 dr

 du
dt  1.
Show that (x, y)  (0, 0) is an unstable critical point.
SOLUTION Since x  r cos u and y  r sin u, we have
 dx
dt  r sin u du
dt  dr
dt cos u
 dy
dt  r cos u du
dt  dr
dt sin u.
From dr/dt  0.05r (3  r) we see that dr/dt  0 when r  0 and can conclude that (x, y)  (0, 0) 
is a critical point by substituting r  0 into the new system.
The differential equation dr/dt  0.05r(3  r) is a logistic equation that can be solved 
using separation of variables. If r (0)  r0 and r0  0, then
 
r 

where c0  (3  r0)/r0. Since
 
lim

3
1  c0 e0.15t  3,
it follows that no matter how close to (0, 0) a solution starts, the solution will leave a disk of 
radius 1 about the origin. Therefore (0, 0) is an unstable critical point. A typical solution that 
starts near (0, 0) is shown in FIGURE 11.3.4. 
 Linearization It is rarely possible to determine the stability of a critical point of a non-
linear system by finding explicit solutions, as in Examples 1 and 2. Instead we replace the term

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
g(X) in the original autonomous system X  g(X) by a linear term A(X  X1) that most closely 
approximates g(X) in a neighborhood of X1. This replacement process, called linearization, will 
be illustrated first for the first-order differential equation x  g(x).
An equation of the tangent line to the curve y  g(x) at x  x1 is y  g(x1)  g(x1)(x  x1), 
and if x1 is a critical point of x  g(x), we have
 
x  g(x)  g(x1)(x  x1).
The general solution to the linear differential equation
 
x  g(x1)(x  x1)
is x  x1 cel1t, where l1  g(x1). Thus if g(x1)  0, then x(t) approaches x1. Theorem 11.3.1 
asserts that the same behavior occurs in the original differential equation provided x(0)  x0 is 
selected close enough to x1.
Theorem 11.3.1 
Stability Criteria for x  g(x)
Let x1 be a critical point of the autonomous first-order differential equation x  g(x), where 
g is differentiable at x1.
(a) If g(x1)  0, then x1 is an asymptotically stable critical point.
(b) If g(x1) 	 0, then x1 is an unstable critical point.
EXAMPLE 3 
Stability in a Nonlinear First-Order DE
Both x  p/4 and x  5p/4 are critical points of the autonomous differential equation 
x  cos x  sin x. This differential equation is difficult to solve explicitly, but we can use 
Theorem 11.3.1 to predict the behavior of solutions near these two critical points.
Since g(x)  sin x  cos x, g(p/4)   !2  0 and g(5p/4)  !2 	 0. Therefore 
x  p/4 is an asymptotically stable critical point, but x  5p/4 is unstable. In FIGURE 11.3.5 
we used a numerical solver to investigate solutions that start near (0, p/4) and (0, 5p/4). 
Observe that solution curves that start close to (0, 5p/4) quickly move away from the line 
x  5p/4, as predicted. 
EXAMPLE 4 
Stability Analysis of the Logistic DE
Without solving explicitly, analyze the critical points of the logistic differential equation (see 
Section 2.8) x  r
K  x(K  x), where r and K are positive constants.
SOLUTION The two critical points are x  0 and x  K. Since
 
g(x)  r
K  (K  2x),
g(0)  r and g(K)  r and it follows from Theorem 11.3.1 that x  0 is an unstable critical 
point and x  K is an asymptotically stable critical point. 
 Jacobian Matrix A similar analysis may be carried out for a plane autonomous system. 
An equation of the tangent plane to the surface z  g(x, y) at X1  (x1, y1) is
 
z  g(x1, y1)  0g
0x 2
 (x1, y1)
(x 2 x1)  0g
0y 2
 (x1, y1)
( y 2 y1),
and g(x, y) may be approximated by its tangent plane in a neighborhood of X1.
When X1 is a critical point of a plane autonomous system, P(x1, y1)  Q(x1, y1)  0 and we have
 
 x9  P(x, y) < 0P

This matrix is called the Jacobian matrix at X1 and is denoted by g(X1). If we let H  X  X1, 
then the linear system X  A(X  X1) becomes H  AH, which is the form of the linear system 
analyzed in Section 11.2. The critical point X  X1 for X  A(X  X1) now corresponds to the 
critical point H  0 for H  AH. If the eigenvalues of A have negative real parts, then, by 
Theorem 11.2.1, 0 is an asymptotically stable critical point for H  AH. If there is an eigenvalue 
with a positive real part, H  0 is an unstable critical point. Theorem 11.3.2 asserts that the same 
conclusions can be made for the critical point X1 of the original system.
Theorem 11.3.2 
Stability Criteria for Plane Autonomous Systems
Let X1 be a crtical point of the plane autonomous sytem X  g(X), where P(x, y) and Q(x, y) 
have continuous first partial derivatives in a neighborhood of X1.
(a) If the eigenvalues of A  g(X1) have negative real part, then X1 is an asymptotically 
stable critical point.
(b) If A  g(X1) has an eigenvalue with positive real part, then X1 is an unstable critical 
point.

Since the determinant of A1 is negative, A1 has a positive real eigenvalue. Therefore ("2, 2)

both eigenvalues have negative real parts. It follows that ("2, 2) is a stable critical point.

| CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
Since the matrix A1 has a positive determinant and a positive trace, both eigenvalues have 
positive real parts. Therefore (0, 0) is an unstable critical point. The determinants of matrices 
A2 and A3 are negative, and so in each case one of the eigenvalues is positive. Therefore both 
(0, 60) and (100, 0) are unstable critical points. Since the matrix A4 has a positive determinant 
and a negative trace, (50, 50) is a stable critical point. 
In Example 5 we did not compute t2  4
 (as in Section 11.2) and attempt to further classify 
the critical points as stable nodes, stable spiral points, saddle points, and so on. For example, 
for X1  ("2, 2) in Example 4(a), t2  4
  0, and if the system were linear, we would be 
able to conclude that X1 was a stable spiral point. FIGURE 11.3.6 shows several solution curves 
near X1 that were obtained with a numerical solver, and each solution does appear to spiral in 
toward the critical point.
 Classifying Critical Points It is natural to ask whether we can infer more geometric 
information about the solutions near a critical point X1 of a nonlinear autonomous system from 
an analysis of the critical point of the corresponding linear system. The answer is summarized 
in FIGURE 11.3.7, but you should note the comments following the figure.

 (i) 
In five separate cases (stable node, stable spiral point, unstable spiral point, unstable 
node, and saddle) the critical point may be categorized like the critical point in the cor-
responding linear system. The solutions have the same general geometric features as 
the solutions to the linear system, and the smaller the neighborhood about X1, the closer 
the resemblance.
 (ii) If t2  4
 and t 	 0, the critical point X1 is unstable, but in this borderline case we are 
not yet able to decide whether X1 is an unstable spiral, unstable node, or degenerate 
unstable node. Likewise, if t2  4
 and t  0, the critical point X1 is stable but may 
be either a stable spiral, a stable node, or a degenerate stable node.
 (iii) If t  0 and 
 	 0, the eigenvalues of A  g(X) are pure imaginary, and in this borderline 
case X1 may be either a stable spiral, an unstable spiral, or a center. It is therefore not yet 
possible to determine whether X1 is stable or unstable.

EXAMPLE 6 
Classifying Critical Points of a Nonlinear System
Classify each critical point of the plane autonomous system in Example 5(b) as a stable node, 
a stable spiral point, an unstable spiral point, an unstable node, or a saddle point.
SOLUTION For the matrix A1 corresponding to (0, 0), 
  3, t  4, and so t2  4
  4. 
Therefore (0, 0) is an unstable node. The critical points (0, 60) and (100, 0) are saddles since 

  0 in both cases. For matrix A4, 
 	 0, t  0, and t2  4
 	 0. It follows that (50, 50) 
is a stable node. Experiment with a numerical solver to verify these conclusions.
EXAMPLE 7 
Stability Analysis for a Soft Spring
Recall from Section 3.11 that the second-order differential equation mx  kx  k1x3  0, for 
k 	 0, represents a general model for the free, undamped oscillations of a mass m attached to 
a nonlinear spring. If k  1 and k1  1, the spring is called soft and the plane autonomous 
system corresponding to the nonlinear second-order differential equation x  x  x3  0 is
 
x  y
 
y  x3  x.
Find and classify (if possible) the critical points.
SOLUTION Since x3  x  x(x2  1), the critical points are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, 0). The 
corresponding Jacobian matrices are
 
  A1  g((0, 0))  a
0

1
0b,  A2  g((1, 0))  g((1, 0))  a0

0b.
Since det A2  0, critical points (1, 0) and (1, 0) are both saddle points. The eigenvalues of 
matrix A1 are i, and according to comment (iii) on page 648, the status of the critical point 
at (0, 0) remains in doubt. It may be either a stable spiral, an unstable spiral, or a center. 
 The Phase-Plane Method The linearization method, when successful, can provide useful 
information on the local behavior of solutions near critical points. It is of little help if we are interested 
in solutions whose initial position X(0)  X0 is not close to a critical point or if we wish to obtain a 
global view of the family of solution curves. The phase-plane method is based on the fact that
 
dy
dx 
dy>dt
dx>dt  Q(x, y)
P(x, y)
and it attempts to find y as a function of x using one of the methods available for solving first-
order differential equations (Chapter 2). As we show in Examples 8 and 9, the method can 
sometimes be used to decide whether a critical point such as (0, 0) in Example 7 is a stable 
spiral, an unstable spiral, or a center.

After completing the square, we can write the solution as y2  (x2  1)2/2  c0. If X(0)  (x0, 0),

Note that y  0 when x  x0. In addition, the right-hand side is positive when x0  x  x0, and 
so each x has two corresponding values of y. The solution X  X(t) that satisfies X(0)  (x0, 0) 
is therefore periodic, and so (0, 0) is a center.

Autonomous Systems as Mathematical Models
INTRODUCTION 
Many applications from physics give rise to nonlinear autonomous 
 second-order differential equations—that is, DEs of the form x  g(x, x). For example, in the 
analysis of free, damped motion of a spring/mass system in Section 3.8 we assumed that the damp-
ing force was proportional to the velocity x and the resulting model mx  bx  kx is a linear 
differential equation. But if the magnitude of the damping force is proportional to the square of the 
velocity, the new differential equation mx  bx|x9|  kx is nonlinear. The corresponding plane 
autonomous system is nonlinear:
 
 x9  y
 
 y9  b
m y|y| 2 k
m x.
In this section we will also analyze the nonlinear pendulum, motion of a bead on a curve, the 
Lotka–Volterra predator–prey models, and the Lotka–Volterra competition model. Additional 
models are presented in these exercises.
 Nonlinear Pendulum In (6) of Section 3.11 we showed that the displacement angle u 
for a simple pendulum satisfies the nonlinear second-order differential equation
 
d 2u
dt2  g
l  sin u  0.
When we let x  u and y  u, this second-order differential equation may be rewritten as the 
dynamical system
 
 x9  y
 
 y9  g
l  sin x.
The critical points are (kp, 0), and the Jacobian matrix is easily shown to be
 
g9((kp, 0))  £

If k  2n  1, 
  0, and so all critical points ((2n  1)p, 0) are saddle points. In  particular, 
the critical point at (p, 0) is unstable as expected. See FIGURE 11.4.1. When k  2n, the eigenval-
ues are pure imaginary, and so the nature of these critical points  remains in doubt. Since we have 
assumed that there are no damping forces acting on the pendulum, we expect that all the critical 
points (2np, 0) are centers. This can be verified using the phase-plane method. From

it follows that 
 y2  2g
l  cos x  c.
If X(0)  (x0, 0), then 
 y2  2g
l  ( cos x 2
 cos x0).
Note that y  0 when x  x0, and that (2g/l)(cos x  cos x0) 	 0 for |x|  |x0|  p. Thus each 
such x has two corresponding values of y, and so the solution X  X(t) that satisfies X(0)  (x0, 0) 
is periodic. We may conclude that (0, 0) is a center. Observe that x  u increases for solutions, 
such as the one drawn in red in FIGURE 11.4.2, that correspond to large initial velocities. In this 
case the pendulum spins in complete circles about its pivot.
EXAMPLE 1 
Periodic Solutions of the Pendulum DE
A pendulum in an equilibrium position with u  0 is given an initial angular velocity of 
v0 rad/s. Determine under what conditions the resulting motion is periodic.
SOLUTION We are asked to examine the solution of the plane autonomous system that satis-
fies X(0)  (0, v0). From y 2  (2g/l) cos x  c it follows that
 
y 2  2g
l
  a cos x 2 1  l

To establish that the solution X(t) is periodic it is sufficient to show that there are two 
x-intercepts x  x0 between p and p and that the right-hand side is positive for |x|  |x0|. 
Each such x then has two corresponding values of y.
If y  0, cos x  1  (l/2g)v2
0, and this equation has two solutions x  x0 between p
and p, provided 1  (l/2g)v2
0 	 1. Note that (2g/l)(cos x  cos x0) is then positive for 
|x|  |x0|. This restriction on the initial angular velocity can be written as
Zv0Z , 2 Å

 Nonlinear Oscillations: The Sliding Bead Suppose, as shown in FIGURE 11.4.3, a 
bead with mass m slides along a thin wire whose shape is described by the function z  f (x). A 
wide variety of nonlinear oscillations can be obtained by changing the shape of the wire and by 
making different assumptions about the forces acting on the bead.
The tangential force F due to the weight W  mg has magnitude mg sin u, and therefore the 
x-component of F is Fx  mg sin u cos u. Since tan u  f (x), we can use the identities 
1  tan2 u  sec2 u and sin2 u  1  cos2 u to conclude that
 
Fx  mg sin u cos u  mg
f 9(x)
1  f  f 9(x)g2.
We assume (as in Section 3.8) that a damping force D, acting in the direction opposite to the 
motion, is a constant multiple of the velocity of the bead. The x-component of D is therefore
 
Dx  b dx
dt .
If we ignore the frictional force between the wire and the bead and assume that no other external 
forces are impressed on the system, it follows from Newton’s second law that
mx0  mg 
f 9(x)
1  f  f 9(x)g2 2 bx9,
and the corresponding plane autonomous system is

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
If X1  (x1, y1) is a critical point of the system, y1  0 and therefore f (x1)  0. The bead must 
therefore be at rest at a point on the wire where the tangent line is horizontal. When f is twice 
differentiable, the Jacobian matrix at X1 is
g9(X1)  a
0
1
gf 0(x1)
b>mb  ,
and so t  b/m, 
  g f   (x1), and t 2  4
  b2/m2  4g f  (x1). Using the results of Section 11.3, 
we can make the following conclusions:
 (i) 
f  (x1)  0:
  
A relative maximum therefore occurs at x  x1, and since 
  0, an unstable saddle point
occurs at X1  (x1, 0).
 (ii) f (x1) 	 0 and b 	 0:
  
A relative minimum therefore occurs at x  x1, and since t  0 and 
 	 0, X1  (x1, 0) is a 
stable critical point. If b2 	 4gm2f (x1), the system is overdamped and the critical point is a 
stable node. If b2  4gm2f (x1), the system is underdamped and the critical point is a stable 
spiral point. The exact nature of the stable critical point is still in doubt if b2  4gm2f (x1).
 (iii) f (x1) 	 0 and the system is undamped (b  0):
  
In this case the eigenvalues are pure imaginary, but the phase-plane method can be used to 
show that the critical point is a center. Therefore solutions with X(0)  (x(0), x(0)) near 
X1  (x1, 0) are periodic.
EXAMPLE 2 
Bead Sliding Along a Sine Wave
A 10-gram bead slides along the graph of z  sin x. According to conclusion (ii), the relative 
minima at x1  p/2 and 3p/2 give rise to stable critical points. See FIGURE 11.4.4. Since 
f (p/2)  f (3p/2)  1, the system will be underdamped provided b2  4gm2. If we use 
SI units, m  0.01 kg and g  9.8 m/s2, and so the condition for an underdamped system 
becomes b2  3.92  103.
If b  0.01 is the damping constant, both of these critical points are stable spiral points. 
The two solutions corresponding to initial conditions X(0)  (x(0), x(0))  (2p, 10) and 
X(0)  (2p, 15), respectively, were obtained from a numerical solver and are shown in 
FIGURE 11.4.5. When x(0)  10, the bead has enough momentum to make it over the hill at 
x  3p/2 but not over the hill at x  p/2. The bead then approaches the relative minimum 
based at x  p/2. If x(0)  15, the bead has the momentum to make it over both hills, but 
then it rocks back and forth in the valley based at x  3p/2 and approaches the point (3p/2, 1) 
on the wire. Experiment with other initial conditions using your numerical solver.
FIGURE 11.4.6 shows a collection of solution curves obtained from a numerical solver for 
the undamped case. Since b  0, the critical points corresponding to x1  p/2 and 3p/2 
are now centers. When X(0)  (2p, 10), the bead has sufficient momentum to move over 
all hills. The figure also indicates that when the bead is released from rest at a position on the 
wire between x  3p/2 and x  p/2, the resulting motion is periodic. 
 Lotka–Volterra Predator–Prey Model A predator–prey interaction between two 
species occurs when one species (the predator) feeds on a second species (the prey). For example, 
the snowy owl feeds almost exclusively on a common arctic rodent called a lemming, while a 
lemming uses arctic tundra plants as its food supply. Interest in using mathematics to help explain 
predator–prey interactions has been stimulated by the observation of population cycles in many 
arctic mammals. In the MacKenzie River district of Canada, for example, the principal prey of 
the lynx is the snowshoe hare, and both populations cycle with a period of about 10 years.
There are many predator–prey models that lead to plane autonomous systems with at least 
one periodic solution. The first such model was constructed independently by pioneer biomath-
ematicians Alfred Lotka (1880–1949) and Vito Volterra (1860–1940). If x denotes the number 
of predators and y denotes the number of prey, then the Lotka–Volterra model takes the form
 
x  ax  bxy  x(a  by)
 
y  cxy  dy  y(cx  d),
where a, b, c, and d are positive constants.

Note that in the absence of predators (x  0), y  dy, and so the number of prey grows ex-
ponentially. In the absence of prey, x  ax, and so the predator population becomes extinct. 
The term cxy represents the death rate due to predation. The model therefore assumes that this 
death rate is directly proportional to the number of possible encounters xy between predator and 
prey at a particular time t, and the term bxy represents the resulting positive contribution to the 
predator population.
The critical points of this plane autonomous system are (0, 0) and (d/c, a/b), and the corre-
sponding Jacobian matrices are
 
A1  g9((0, 0))  aa
0
0
db and A2  g9((d>c, a>b))  a
0
bd>c
ac>b
0 b  .
The critical point at (0, 0) is a saddle point, and FIGURE 11.4.7 shows a typical profile of solu-
tions that are in the first quadrant and near (0, 0).
Since the matrix A2 has pure imaginary eigenvalues l  "adi, the critical point (d/c, a/b) 
may be a center. This possibility can be investigated using the phase-plane method. Since
 
dy
dx  y (cx  d)
x (a  by),
we may separate variables and obtain
 
#
a  by

so that
 
a ln y  by  cx  d ln x  c1  or  (x decx)(y aeby)  c0.
The following argument establishes that all solution curves that originate in the first quadrant are 
periodic.
Typical graphs of the nonnegative functions F(x)  x decx and G( y)  y aeby are shown in 
FIGURE 11.4.8. It is not hard to show that F(x) has an absolute maximum at x  d/c, whereas G( y) 
has an absolute maximum at y  a/b. Note that, with the exception of 0 and the absolute maxi-
mum, F and G each take on all values in their range precisely twice.

These graphs can be used to establish the following properties of a solution curve that origi-

1. If y  a/b, the equation F(x)G( y)  c0 has exactly two solutions xm and xM that satisfy 
xm  d/c  xM.
 
2. If xm  x1  xM and x  x1, then F(x)G( y)  c0 has exactly two solutions y1 and y2 that

3. If x is outside the interval [xm, xM], then F(x)G( y)  c0 has no solutions.
We will give the demonstration of 1. and outline parts 2. and 3. in the exercises. Since

erate these cycles. The closer the initial condition X0 is to (80, 50), the more the periodic 
solutions resemble the elliptical solutions to the corresponding linear system. The eigenvalues 
of g((80, 50)) are l  !adi  ( !2/10)i, and so the solutions near the critical point have 
period p  10 !2p, or about 44.4. 
 Lotka–Volterra Competition Model A competitive interaction occurs when two or 
more species compete for the food, water, light, and space resources of an ecosystem. The use of one 
of these resources by one population therefore inhibits the ability of another population to survive and 
grow. Under what conditions can two competing species coexist? A number of mathematical models 
have been constructed that offer insights into conditions that permit coexistence. If x denotes the num-
ber in species I and y denotes the number in species II, then the Lotka–Volterra model takes the form
 
 x9  r1
K1
 x (K1 2 x 2 a12 y) 
(1)
 
 y9  r2
K2
 y (K2 2 y 2 a21 x).
Note that in the absence of species II ( y  0), x  (r1/K1)x(K1  x), and so the first popula-
tion grows logistically and approaches the steady-state population K1 (see Section 2.8 and 
Example 4 in Section 11.3). A similar statement holds for species II growing in the absence of 
species I. The term a21xy in the second equation stems from the competitive effect of species I 
on species II. The model therefore assumes that this rate of inhibition is directly proportional 
to the number of possible competitive pairs xy at a particular time t.
This plane autonomous system has critical points at (0, 0), (K1, 0), and (0, K2). When a12a21  0, 
the lines K1  x  a12y  0 and K2  y  a21x  0 intersect to produce a fourth critical point 
Xˆ   (xˆ, yˆ). FIGURE 11.4.11 shows the two conditions under which (xˆ, yˆ) is in the first quadrant.
The trace and determinant of the Jacobian matrix at (xˆ, yˆ) are, respectively,

 	 0, and so (xˆ, yˆ) is a stable node. Therefore if X(0)  X0 is sufficiently close to 
Xˆ   (xˆ, yˆ), limtSq X(t)  Xˆ , and we may conclude that coexistence is possible. The demonstra-
tion that case (b) leads to a saddle point and the investigation of the nature of critical points at 
(0, 0), (K1, 0), and (0, K2) are left to the exercises.
When the competitive interactions between two species are weak, both of the coefficients a12 
and a21 will be small, and so the conditions K1/a12 	 K2 and K2/a21 	 K1 may be satisfied. This 
might occur when there is a small overlap in the ranges of two predator species that hunt for a 
common prey.

EXAMPLE 4 
A Lotka–Volterra Competition Model
A competitive interaction is described by the Lotka–Volterra competition model
 
x  0.004x(50  x  0.75y)
 
  y  0.001y(100  y  3.0x).
Find and classify all critical points of the system.
SOLUTION Critical points occur at (0, 0), (50, 0), (0, 100), and at the solution (20, 40) of the 
system
 
x  0.75y  50
 
3.0x  y  100.
Since a12a21  2.25 	 1, we have case (b) in Figure 11.4.11, and so the critical point at (20, 40) 
is a saddle point. The Jacobian matrix is
 
g9(X)  a0.2 2 0.008x 2 0.003y
0.003x
0.003y
0.1 2 0.002y 2 0.003xb  ,
and we obtain
 
A1  g9((0, 0))  a0.2
0

0.1b 
A2  g9((50, 0))  a0.2

A3  g9((20, 40))  a0.08

0.06
0.04b  
A4  g9((0, 100))  a0.1
0
0.3
0.1b.
Therefore (0, 0) is an unstable node, whereas both (50, 0) and (0, 100) are stable nodes. (Check 
this!) Since det A3  0, we have a second demonstration that (20, 40) is a saddle point.
Coexistence can also occur in the Lotka–Volterra competition model if there is at least one 
periodic solution lying entirely in the first quadrant. It is possible to show, however, that this 
model has no periodic solutions.

angular velocity of v0 rad/s. Determine under what conditions 
the resulting motion is periodic.
 2. (a)  If a pendulum is released from rest at u  u0, show that 
the angular velocity is again 0 when u  u0.

sliding bead, verify that the Jacobian matrix at X1 is

and the system is undamped, the critical point X1  (x1, 0) is 
a center. Estimate the period of the bead when x(0) is near 
x1 and x(0)  0.
 5. A bead is released from the position x(0)  x0 on the curve 
z  1

(a) Use the phase-plane method to show that the resulting

rises is given by

number of predators occurs when y  a/b.
 9. In many fishery science models the rate at which a species 
is caught is assumed to be directly proportional to its 
abundance. If both predator and prey are being exploited in 
this manner, the Lotka–Volterra differential equations take 
the form

 where e1 and e2 are positive constants.
(a) When e2  d, show that there is a new critical point in 
the first quadrant that is a center.
(b) Volterra’s principle states that a moderate amount of 
exploitation increases the average number of prey and 
decreases the average number of predators. Is this fisher-
ies model consistent with Volterra’s principle?

Miscellaneous Nonlinear Models
 16. If we assume that a damping force acts in a direction opposite 
to the motion of a pendulum and with a magnitude directly 
proportional to the angular velocity du/dt, the displacement

 17. In the analysis of free, damped motion in Section 3.8 we as-
sumed that the damping force was proportional to the 
velocity x. Frequently the magnitude of this damping force is 
proportional to the square of the velocity, and the new 
differential equation becomes

(a) Write the second-order differential equation as a plane 
autonomous system, and find all critical points.
(b) The system is called overdamped when (0, 0) is a stable 
node and is called underdamped when (0, 0) is a stable 
spiral point. Physical considerations suggest that (0, 0) 
must be an asymptotically stable critical point. Show that 
the system is necessarily underdamped. [Hint: 
d>dy (y|y|)  2|y|.]
 18. A bead with mass m slides along a thin wire whose shape 
may be described by the function z  f (x). Small stretches 
of the wire act like an inclined plane, and in mechanics it is 
assumed that the magnitude of the frictional force between 
the bead and wire is directly proportional to mg cos u. See 
Figure 11.4.3.

x-coordinate of the bead is

for some positive constant µ.
(b) Investigate the critical points of the corresponding plane 
autonomous system. Under what conditions is a critical 
point a saddle point? A stable spiral point?
 19. An undamped oscillation satisfies a nonlinear second- order 
differential equation of the form x  f (x)  0, where f (0)  0 
and xf (x)  0 for x 	 0 and d  x  d. Use the phase-plane 
method to investigate whether it is possible for the critical 
point (0, 0) to be a stable spiral point. [Hint: Let F(x)  ex

 20. The Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model assumes that, in the 
absence of predators, the number of prey grows exponentially. 
If we make the alternative assumption that the prey population 
grows logistically, the new system is

11.5 
Periodic Solutions, Limit Cycles, and Global Stability
INTRODUCTION In this section we will investigate the existence of periodic solutions of 
nonlinear plane autonomous systems and introduce special periodic solutions called limit cycles.
We saw in Sections 11.3 and 11.4 that an analysis of critical points using linearization can 
provide valuable information on the behavior of solutions near critical points and insight into a 
variety of biological and physical phenomena. There are, however, some inherent limitations to 
this approach. When the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are pure imaginary, we cannot conclude 
that there are periodic solutions near the critical point. In some cases we were able to solve 
dy/dx  Q(x, y)/P(x, y), obtain an implicit representation f (x, y)  c of the solution curves, and 
investigate whether any of these solutions formed closed curves. More often than not, this differential 
equation will not possess closed-form solutions. For example, the Lotka–Volterra competition 
model cannot be handled by this procedure. The first goal of this section is to determine conditions 
under which we can either exclude the possibility of periodic solutions or assert their existence.
We encountered an additional problem in studying the models in Section 11.3. FIGURE 11.5.1 
illustrates the common situation in which a region R contains a single asymptotically stable criti-
cal point X1. We can assert that limtSq X(t)  X1 when the initial position X(0)  X0 is “near” 
X1, but under what conditions is limtSq X(t)  X1 for all initial positions in R? Such a critical 
point is called globally stable in R. A second goal is to determine conditions under which an 
asymptotically stable critical point is globally stable.
In motivating and discussing the methods in this section, we will use the fact that the vector 
field V(x, y)  (P(x, y), Q(x, y)) can be interpreted as defining a fluid flow in a region of the 
plane, and a solution to the autonomous system may be interpreted as the resulting path of a 
particle as it moves through the region.
 Negative Criteria A number of results can sometimes be used to establish that there are 
no periodic solutions in a given region R of the plane. We will assume that P(x, y) and Q(x, y) have 
continuous first partial derivatives in R and that R is simply connected. Recall that in a simply con-
nected region, any simple closed curve C in R encloses only points in R. Therefore, if there is a 
periodic solution X  X(t) in R, then R will contain all points in the interior of the resulting curve.
Theorem 11.5.1 
Cycles and Critical Points
If a plane autonomous system has a periodic solution X  X(t) in a simply connected region 
R, then the system has at least one critical point inside the corresponding simple closed curve 
C. If there is a single critical point inside C, then that critical point cannot be a saddle point.
Corollary to Theorem 11.5.1
If a simply connected region R either contains no critical points of a plane autonomous system 
or contains a single saddle point, then there are no periodic solutions in R.

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
EXAMPLE 1 
No Periodic Solutions
Show that the plane autonomous system
 
x  xy
 
y  1  x2  y2
has no periodic solutions.
SOLUTION If (x, y) is a critical point, then, from the first equation, either x  0 or y  0. If 
x  0, then 1  y2  0 or y2  1. Likewise, y  0 implies x2  1. Therefore, this plane 
autonomous system has no critical points, and by the corollary possesses no periodic solutions 
in the plane. 
EXAMPLE 2 
Lotka–Volterra Competition Model
Show that the Lotka–Volterra competition model
 
x  0.004x(50  x  0.75y)
 
y  0.001y(100  y  3.0x)
has no periodic solutions in the first quadrant.
SOLUTION In Example 4 in Section 11.4 we showed that this system has critical points at 
(0, 0), (50, 0), (0, 100), and (20, 40), and that (20, 40) is a saddle point. Since only (20, 40) lies 
in the first quadrant, by the corollary there are no periodic solutions in the first quadrant.
Another sometimes useful result can be formulated in terms of the divergence of the vector 
field V(x, y)  (P(x, y), Q(x, y)):
Theorem 11.5.2 
Bendixson Negative Criterion
If div V  P/x  Q/y does not change sign in a simply connected region R, then the plane 
autonomous system has no periodic solutions in R.
PROOF: Suppose, to the contrary, that there is a periodic solution X  X(t) lying in R, and let C
be the resulting simple closed curve and R1 the region bounded by C. Green’s theorem states that
#
C
M(x, y) dx  N(x, y) dy  6
R1
a 0N
0x 2 0M
0y b dx dy
whenever M(x, y) and N(x, y) have continuous first partials in R. If we let N  P and M  Q, 
we obtain
#
C
Q(x, y) dx  P(x, y) dy  6
R1
a 0P
0x 2 0Q
0y b dx dy.
Since X  X(t) is a solution with period p, we have x(t)  P(x(t), y(t)) and y(t)  Q(x(t), y(t)), 
and so
 
#
C
 Q(x, y) dx  P(x, y) dy  #
P

[Q(x(t), y(t))  x(t)  P(x(t), y(t))  y(t)] dt
 
        #
P
0
[QP  PQ] dt  0.
Since div V  P/x  Q/y is continuous and does not change sign in R, it follows that either 
div V  0 in R or div V  0 in R, and so
 
6
R1
a 0P
0x  0Q
0y b dx dy 2 0.
This contradiction establishes that there are no periodic solutions in R.

(b) x  y  x(2  x2  y2)
y  x  2y  yx2  y3 
 
y  x  y(2  x2  y2)
SOLUTION (a) We have div V P/x  Q/y  1  12x2  2  x2  3y2  3, and so 
there are no periodic solutions in the plane.
(b) For this system div V  (2  3x2  y2)  (2  x2  3y2)  4  4(x2  y2). Therefore, if R 
is the interior of the circle x2  y2  1, div V 	 0, and so there are no periodic solutions inside 
this disk. Note that div V  0 on the exterior of the circle. If R is any simply connected subset 
of the exterior, then there are no periodic solutions in R. It follows that if there is a periodic 
solution in the exterior, it must enclose the circle x2  y2  1. In fact, the reader can verify that 
X(t)  (!2 sin t, !2 cos t) is a periodic solution that generates the circle x2  y2  2.
EXAMPLE 4 
Sliding Bead and Periodic Solutions
The sliding bead discussed in Section 11.4 satisfies the differential equation

Show that there are no periodic solutions.
SOLUTION The corresponding plane autonomous system is

and so div V  0P

m , 0. By Theorem 11.5.2 we conclude the system has no 
periodic solutions. 
The following theorem is a generalization of the Bendixson negative criterion, which leaves 
it to the reader to construct an appropriate function d(x, y).
Theorem 11.5.3 
Dulac Negative Criterion
If d (x, y) has continuous first partial derivatives in a simply connected region R and 01dP2
0x
1
01dQ2
0y  
does not change sign in R, then the plane autonomous system has no periodic solutions in R.
There are no general techniques for constructing an appropriate function d(x, y). Instead, 
we experiment with simple functions of the form ax 2  by 2, e axby, x ay b, and so on, and try to 
determine constants for which (dP)/x  (dQ)/y is nonzero in a given region.
EXAMPLE 5 
Dulac Negative Criterion
Show that the second-order nonlinear differential equation
 
x  x2  (x)2  x  x
has no periodic solutions.
SOLUTION The corresponding plane autonomous system is

For (x, y) in the first quadrant, the latter expression is always negative. Therefore, there are 
no periodic solutions.
 Positive Criteria: Poincaré–Bendixson Theory The Poincaré–Bendixson theorem 
is an advanced result that describes the long-range behavior of a bounded solution to a plane 
autonomous system. Rather than present the result in its full generality, we will concentrate on 
a number of special cases that occur frequently in applications. One of these cases will lead to a 
new type of periodic solution called a limit cycle.
Definition 11.5.1 
Invariant Region
A region R is called an invariant region for a plane autonomous system if, whenever X0 is 
in R, the solution X  X(t) satisfying X(0)  X0 remains in R.
FIGURE 11.5.2 shows two standard types of invariant regions. A Type I invariant region R is 
bounded by a simple closed curve C, and the flow at the boundary defined by the vector field 
V(x, y)  (P(x, y), Q(x, y)) is always directed into the region. This prevents a particle from cross-
ing the boundary. A Type II invariant region is an annular region bounded by simple closed 
curves C1 and C2, and the flow at the boundary is again directed toward the interior of R. The 
following theorem provides a method for verifying that a given region is invariant.
Theorem 11.5.4 
Normal Vectors and Invariant Regions
If n(x, y) denotes a normal vector on the boundary that points inside the region, then R will 
be an invariant region for the plane autonomous system provided V(x, y)  n(x, y)  0 for all 
points (x, y) on the boundary.
PROOF: If u is the angle between V(x, y) and n(x, y), then from V  n  iVi ini cos u, we may 
conclude that cos u  0 and so u is between 0 and 90. The flow is therefore directed into the region 
(or at worst along the boundary) for any boundary point (x, y). This prevents a solution that starts in 
R from leaving R. Therefore, R is an invariant region for the plane autonomous system.

The problem of finding an invariant region for a given nonlinear system is an extremely difficult 
one. An excellent first step is to use software that plots the vector field V(x, y)  (P(x, y), Q(x, y)) 
together with the curves P(x, y)  0 (along which the vectors are vertical) and Q(x, y)  0 (along 
which the vectors are horizontal). This can lead to choices for R. In the following examples, we 
will construct invariant regions bounded by lines and circles. In more complicated cases, we will 
be content to offer empirical evidence that an invariant region exists.
EXAMPLE 7 
Circular Invariant Region
Find a circular region with center at (0, 0) that serves as an invariant region for the plane 
autonomous system
 
x  y  x3
 
y  x  y3.
SOLUTION For the circle x2  y2  r 2, n  (2x, 2y) is a normal vector that points toward 
the interior of the circle. Since
 
V  n  (y  x3, x  y3)  (2x, 2y)  2(x4  y4),
we may conclude that V  n  0 on the circle x2  y2  r2. Therefore, by Theorem 11.5.4 
the circular region defined by x2  y2  r  2 serves as an invariant region for the system for 
any r 	 0.
EXAMPLE 8 
Annular Invariant Region
Find an annular region bounded by circles that serves as an invariant region for the plane 
autonomous system
 
x  x  y  5x(x2  y2)  x5
 
   y  x  y  5y(x2  y2)  y5.
SOLUTION As in Example 7, the normal vector n1  (2x, 2y) points inside the circle 
x2  y2  r 2, while the normal vector n2  n1 is directed toward the exterior. Computing 
V  n1 and simplifying, we obtain
 
V  n1  2(r 2  5r4  x6  y6).
Note that r2  5r4  r 2(1  5r 2) takes on both positive and negative values.
If r  1, V  n1  8  2(x6  y6)  0, since the maximum value of x6  y6 on the circle 
x2  y2  1 is 1. The flow is therefore directed toward the interior of the circular region 
x2  y2  1.
If r  1
4, V  n1  2(r 2  5r 4)  0, and so V  n2  V  n1 	 0. The flow is therefore 
directed toward the exterior of the circle x2  y2  1
16, and so the annular region R defined by  
1
16
–––  x 2  y 2  1 is an invariant region for the system.
EXAMPLE 9 
The Van der Pol Equation
The Van der Pol equation is a nonlinear second-order differential equation that arises in 
electronics, and as a plane autonomous system it takes the form
 
 x  y
 
y  µ(x2  1)y  x.
FIGURE 11.5.3 shows the corresponding vector field for µ  1, together with the curves y  0 
and (x2  1)y  x along which the vectors are vertical and horizontal, respectively. (For 
convenience we have sketched the normalized vector field V/iVi.) It is not possible to find a 
simple invariant region whose boundary consists of lines or circles. The figure does offer 
empirical evidence that an invariant region R, with (0, 0) in its interior, does exist. Advanced 
methods are required to demonstrate this mathematically.*

CHAPTER 11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations
We next present two important special cases of the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem that guarantee 
the existence of periodic solutions.
Theorem 11.5.5 
Poincaré–Bendixson I
Let R be an invariant region for a plane autonomous system and suppose that R has no critical 
points on its boundary.
(a) If R is a Type I region that has a single unstable node or an unstable spiral point in 
its interior, then there is at least one periodic solution in R.
(b) If R is a Type II region that contains no critical points of the system, then there is at 
least one periodic solution in R.
In either of the two cases, if X  X(t) is a nonperiodic solution in R, then X(t) spirals toward 
a cycle that is a solution to the system. This periodic solution is called a limit cycle.
The flow interpretation portrayed in Figure 11.5.2 can be used to make the result plausible. 
If a particle is released at a point X0 in a Type II invariant region R, then, with no escape from 
the region and with no resting points, the particle will begin to rotate around the boundary C2
and settle into a periodic orbit. It is not possible for the particle to return to an earlier position 
unless the solution is itself periodic.
EXAMPLE 10 
Existence of a Periodic Solution
Use Theorem 11.5.5 to show that the system
 
    x  y  x(1  x2  y2)  y(x2  y2)
 
y  x  y(1  x2  y2)  x(x2  y2)
has at least one periodic solution.
SOLUTION We first construct an invariant region that is bounded by circles. If n1  (2x, 2y), 
then V  n1  2r  2(1  r  2). If we let r  2 and then r  1
2, we may conclude that the annular 
region R defined by 1
4  x 2  y 2  4 is invariant. If (x1, y1) is a critical point of the system, then 
V  n1  (0, 0)  n1  0. Therefore, r  0 or r  1. If r  0, then (x1, y1)  (0, 0) is a critical 
point. If r  1, the system reduces to 2y  0, 2x  0 and we have reached a contradiction. 
Therefore, (0, 0) is the only critical point, and this critical point is not in R. By part (b) of 
Theorem 11.5.5, the system has at least one periodic solution in R.
The reader can verify that X(t)  (cos 2t, sin 2t) is a periodic solution. 
EXAMPLE 11 
Limit Cycle in the Van der Pol Equation
Show that the Van der Pol differential equation
 
x  µ(x2  1)x  x  0
has a periodic solution when µ 	 0.
SOLUTION We will assume that there is a Type I invariant region R for the corresponding 
plane autonomous system and that this region contains (0, 0) in its interior (see Example 9 
and Figure 11.5.3). The only critical point is (0, 0), and the Jacobian matrix is given by
 
g9((0, 0))  a
0
1
1
µb.
Therefore, t  µ, 
  1, and t 2  4
  µ 2  4. Since µ 	 0, the critical point is either an 
unstable spiral point or an unstable node. By part (a) of Theorem 11.5.5, the system has at 
least one periodic solution in R. FIGURE 11.5.4 shows solutions corresponding to X(0)  (0.5, 
0.5) and X(0)  (3, 3) for µ  1. Each of these solutions spirals around the origin and ap-
proaches a limit cycle. It can be shown that the Van der Pol differential equation has a unique 
limit cycle for all values of the parameter µ.

 Global Stability Another version of the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem can be used to 
show that a locally stable critical point is globally stable:
Theorem 11.5.6 
Poincaré–Bendixson II
Let R be a Type I invariant region for a plane autonomous system that has no periodic solutions 
in R.
(a) If R has a finite number of nodes or spiral points, then given any initial position X0 
in R, limtS X(t)  X1 for some critical point X1.
(b) If R has a single stable node or stable spiral point X1 in its interior and no critical 
points on its boundary, then limtSq X(t)  X1 for all initial positions X0 in R.
In Theorem 11.5.6 the particle cannot escape from R, cannot return to any of its prior posi-
tions, and therefore, in the absence of cycles, must be attracted to some stable critical point X1.
EXAMPLE 12 
A Globally Stable Critical Point
Investigate global stability for the system from Example 7:
 
    x  y  x3
 
y  x  y3.
SOLUTION In Example 7 we showed that the circular region defined by x2  y2  r 2 serves 
as an invariant region for the system for any r 	 0. Since P/x  Q/y  3x2  3y2 does 
not change sign, there are no periodic solutions by the Bendixson negative criterion. It is not 
hard to show that (0, 0) is the only critical point and that the Jacobian matrix is
 
g9((0, 0))  a0
1
1
0b.
Since t  0 and 
  1, (0, 0) may be either a stable or an unstable spiral (it cannot be a center). 
Theorem 11.5.6, however, guarantees that limtSq X(t)  X1 for some critical point X1. Since 
(0, 0) is the only critical point, we must have limtSq X(t)  (0, 0) for any initial position X0 
in the plane. The critical point is therefore a globally stable spiral point. FIGURE 11.5.5 shows 
two views of the solution satisfying X(0)  (4, 4). Figure 11.5.5(b) is an enlarged view of the 
curve around (0, 0). Notice how slowly the solution spirals toward (0, 0).

Our goal in Part 4 of this text is 
solve certain kinds of linear 
partial differential equations in 
an applied context. Although we 
do not solve any PDEs in this 
chapter, the material covered sets 
the stage for the procedures 
discussed later.
In calculus you saw that a 
sufficiently differentiable 
function f could often be 
expanded in a Taylor series, which 
essentially is an infinite series 
consisting of powers of x. The 
principal concept examined in 
this chapter also involves 
expanding a function in an 
infinite series. In the early 1800s, 
the French mathematician Joseph 
Fourier (1768–1830) advanced 
the idea of expanding a function f 
in a series of trigonometric 
functions. It turns out that 
Fourier series are just special 
cases of a more general type of 
series representation of a 
function using an infinite set of 
orthogonal functions. The 
notion of orthogonal functions 
leads us back to eigenvalues and 
the corresponding set of 
eigenfunctions. Since eigenvalues 
and eigenfunctions are the 
linchpins of the procedures in the 
two chapters that follow, you are 
encouraged to review Example 2 
in Section 3.9.

CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
12.1 
Orthogonal Functions
INTRODUCTION In certain areas of advanced mathematics, a function is considered to be a 
generalization of a vector. In this section we shall see how the two vector concepts of inner, or 
dot, product and orthogonality of vectors can be extended to functions. The remainder of the 
chapter is a practical application of this discussion.
 Inner Product Recall, if u  u1i  u2 j  u3k and v  v1i  v2 j  v3k are two vectors 
in R3 or 3-space, then the inner product or dot product of u and v is a real number, called a scalar, 
defined as the sum of the products of their corresponding components:
 
(u, v)  u1v1  u2v2  u3v3  a
3
k1
ukvk.
The inner product (u, v) possesses the following properties:
 (i) 
(u, v)  (v, u)
 (ii) (ku, v)  k(u, v), k a scalar
 (iii) (u, u)  0 if u  0 and (u, u)  0 if u Z 0
 (iv) (u  v, w)  (u, w)  (v, w).
We expect any generalization of the inner product to possess these same properties.
Suppose that f1 and f2 are piecewise-continuous functions defined on an interval [a, b].* Since 
a definite integral on the interval of the product f1(x)  f2(x) possesses properties (i)(iv) of the inner 
product of vectors, whenever the integral exists we are prompted to make the following definition.
In Chapter 7, the inner 
product was denoted by u  v.
Definition 12.1.1 
Inner Product of Functions
The inner product of two functions f1 and f2 on an interval [a, b] is the number
 
(  f1,  f2)  #
b
a
 f1(x) f2(x ) dx.
Definition 12.1.2 
Orthogonal Functions
Two functions f1 and f2 are said to be orthogonal on an interval [a, b] if
(  f1,  f2)  #
b
a
 f1(x) f2(x) dx  0. 
(1)
*The interval could also be (q, q), [0, q), and so on.
 Orthogonal Functions Motivated by the fact that two vectors u and v are orthogonal 
whenever their inner product is zero, we define orthogonal functions in a similar manner.
EXAMPLE 1 
Orthogonal Functions 
The functions f1(x)  x2 and f2(x)  x3 are orthogonal on the interval [1, 1]. This fact  follows 
from (1):
 
(  f1,  f2)  #
1
1
x2  x3 dx #

x5 dx  1

 0.
Unlike vector analysis, where the word orthogonal is a synonym for perpendicular, in this 
present context the term orthogonal and condition (1) have no geometric significance.
 Orthogonal Sets We are primarily interested in infinite sets of orthogonal functions.

 Orthonormal Sets The norm, or length iui, of a vector u can be expressed in terms of 
the inner product. The expression (u, u)  iui 2 is called the square norm, and so the norm is 
iui  "(u, u). Similarly, the square norm of a function fn is ifn(x)i 2  (fn, fn), and so the 
norm,  or its generalized length, is ifn(x)i  "(fn, fn). In other words, the square norm and 
norm of a function fn in an orthogonal set {fn(x)} are, respectively, 
 
ifn(x)i2  #
b
a
f2
n(x) dx  and  ifn(x)i  Å#

n(x) dx. 
(3)
If {fn(x)} is an orthogonal set of functions on the interval [a, b] with the property that ifn(x)i  1 
for n  0, 1, 2, …,  then {fn(x)} is said to be an orthonormal set on the interval.
Definition 12.1.3 
Orthogonal Set

that ep

so that if0(x)i  !2p. For fn(x)  cos nx, n  0, it follows that

| CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
Any orthogonal set of nonzero functions {fn(x)}, n  0, 1, 2, …, can be normalized—that is, 
made into an orthonormal set—by dividing each function by its norm. It follows from Examples 2 
and 3 that the set
 
e
1
"2p
 , 
 cos x
"p
 , 
 cos 2x
"p
 , p f
is orthonormal on the interval [p, p].
 Vector Analogy We shall make one more analogy between vectors and functions. Suppose 
v1, v2, and v3 are three mutually orthogonal nonzero vectors in 3-space. Such an orthogonal set 
can be used as a basis for 3-space; that is, any three-dimensional vector can be written as a linear 
combination
 
u  c1v1  c2v2  c3v3,  
(4)
where the ci , i  1, 2, 3, are scalars called the components of the vector. Each component ci can 
be expressed in terms of u and the corresponding vector vi . To see this we take the inner product 
of (4) with v1:
 
(u, v1)  c1(v1, v1)  c2(v2, v1)  c3(v3, v1)  c1iv1i 2  c2  0  c3  0.
Hence 
c1  (u, v1)
iv1i2 .
In like manner we find that the components c2 and c3 are given by
 
c2  (u, v2)
iv2i2   and  c3  (u, v3)
iv3i2 .
Hence (4) can be expressed as
 
u  (u, v1)
iv1i2  v1  (u,  v2)
iv2i2   v2  (u,  v3)
iv3i2  v3  a
3
n1
(u, vn)
ivni2   vn. 
(5)
 Orthogonal Series Expansion Suppose {fn(x)} is an infinite orthogonal set of func-
tions on an interval [a, b]. We ask: If  y  f (x) is a function defined on the interval [a, b], is it 
possible to determine a set of coefficients cn , n  0, 1, 2, …, for which
 
f (x)  c0f0(x)  c1f1(x)  p  cnfn(x)  p? 
(6)
As in the foregoing discussion on finding components of a vector, we can find the coefficients cn 
by utilizing the inner product. Multiplying (6) by fm(x) and integrating over the interval [a, b] gives 
 #
b
a
f (x)fm(x) dx  c0#
b
a
f0(x)fm(x) dx  c1#
b
a
f1(x)fm(x) dx  p  cn#
b
a
fn(x)fm(x) dx  p
 
 c0(f0, fm)  c1(f1, fm)  p  cn(fn , fm)  p.
By orthogonality, each term on the right-hand side of the last equation is zero except when m  n. 
In this case we have
 
#
b
a
 f (x)fn(x) dx  cn #
b
a
fn
2 (x) dx.
It follows that the required coefficients cn are given by
 
cn  e
b
a   f (x)fn(x) dx
e
b
a f2
n(x) dx
, n  0, 1, 2, p.
An orthogonal set can be 
made into an orthonormal set.

In other words,  
f (x)  a
q
n0
cnfn(x) , 
(7)
where 
 cn  e
b
a  f (x)fn(x) dx
ifn(x)i2
. 
(8)
With inner product notation, (7) becomes
 
f (x)  a
q
n0
 (  f, fn)
ifn(x)i2 fn(x). 
(9)
Thus (9) is seen to be the function analogue of the vector result given in (5).
Definition 12.1.4 
Orthogonal Set/Weight Function
A set of real-valued functions {f0(x), f1(x), f2(x), …} is said to be orthogonal with respect 
to a weight function w(x) on an interval [a, b] if
 
#
b
a
w(x)fm(x)fn(x) dx  0, m Z n.
The usual assumption is that w(x)  0 on the interval of orthogonality [a, b]. The set 
{1, cos x, cos 2x, …} in Example 2 is orthogonal with respect to the weight function w(x)  1 
on the interval [p, p].
If {fn(x)} is orthogonal with respect to a weight function w(x) on the interval [a, b], then 
multiplying (6) by w(x)fn(x) and integrating yields
 
cn  e
b
a   f (x) w (x) fn(x) dx
ifn(x)i2
,  
(10)
where 
ifn(x)i2  #
b
a
w(x) f2
n(x) dx. 
(11)
The series (7) with coefficients cn given by either (8) or (10) is said to be an orthogonal series 
expansion of f or a generalized Fourier series.
 Complete Sets The procedure outlined for determining the coefficients cn was formal; 
that is, basic questions on whether an orthogonal series expansion such as (7) is actually possible 
were ignored. Also, to expand f in a series of orthogonal functions, it is certainly necessary that 
f not be orthogonal to each fn of the orthogonal set {fn(x)}. (If f were orthogonal to every fn, 
then cn  0, n  0, 1, 2, ….) To avoid the latter problem we shall assume, for the remainder of 
the discussion, that an orthogonal set is complete. This means that the only continuous function 
orthogonal to each member of the set is the zero function.
REMARKS
Suppose that { f0(x),  f1(x),  f2(x), …} is an infinite set of real-valued functions that are contin uous 
on an interval [a, b]. If this set is linearly independent on [a, b] (see page 357 for the definition 
of an infinite linearly independent set), then it can always be made into an orthogonal set and, 
as described earlier in this section, can be made into an orthonormal set. See Problem 27 in 
Exercises 12.1.

12.2 Fourier Series
INTRODUCTION We have just seen in the preceding section that if {f0(x), f1(x), f2(x), …} 
is a set of real-valued functions that is orthogonal on an interval [a, b] and if f is a function defined 
on the same interval, then we can formally expand f in an orthogonal series c0f0(x)  c1f1(x)  
c2f2(x)  … . In this section we shall expand functions in terms of a special orthogonal set of 
trigonometric functions.
 Trigonometric Series In Problem 12 in Exercises 12.1, you were asked to show that 
the set of trigonometric functions
 
e1,  cos p
p x,  cos 2p
p  x,  cos 3p
p  x, p  ,  sin p
p x, sin 2p
p  x, sin 3p
p  x, p f  
(1)
is orthogonal on the interval [p, p]. This set will be of special importance later on in the solution 
of certain kinds of boundary-value problems involving linear partial differential equations. In 
those applications we will need to expand a function f  defined on [p, p] in an orthogonal series 
consisting of the trigonometric functions in (1); that is, 
 
f (x)  a0
2  a
q
n1
aan cos np
p  x  bn sin np
p  xb. 
(2)
The coefficients a0, a1, a2, …, b1, b2, …, can be determined in exactly the same manner as in the 
general discussion of orthogonal series expansions on pages 674 and 675. Before proceeding, note 
that we have chosen to write the coefficient of 1 in the set (1) as 1
2 a0 rather than a0; this is for 
convenience only because the formula of an will then  reduce to a0 for n  0.
Now integrating both sides of (2) from p to p gives

(3)
Since cos(npx/p) and sin(npx/p), n  1, are orthogonal to 1 on the interval, the right side of 
(3) reduces to a single term:
 
#
p
p
f (x) dx  a0

Solving for a0 yields
 
a0  1

Now we multiply (2) by cos(mpx/p) and integrate:

instead of a0.

The trigonometric series (2) with coefficients a0, an , and bn defined by (4), (6), and (7), 
respectively, is said to be the Fourier series of the function f. The coefficients obtained from (4), 
(6), and (7) are referred to as Fourier coefficients of f.
In finding the coefficients a0, an,  and bn , we assumed that f was integrable on the interval 
and that (2), as well as the series obtained by multiplying (2) by cos (mpx/p), converged in such 
a manner as to permit term-by-term integration. Until (2) is shown to be convergent for a given 
function f,  the equality sign is not to be taken in a strict or literal sense. Some texts use the 
symbol  in place of . In view of the fact that most functions in applications are of a type that 
guarantees convergence of the series, we shall use the equality symbol. We summarize the results:

Theorem 12.2.1 
Conditions for Convergence
Let f and f  be piecewise continuous on the interval [p, p]; that is, let f and f  be continuous 
except at a finite number of points in the interval and have only finite discontinuities at these 
points. Then for all x in the interval (p, p) the Fourier series of f converges to f (x) at a point 
of continuity. At a point of discontinuity, the Fourier series converges to the  average
 
f (x1)  f (x)
2
,
where f (x) and f (x) denote the limit of f at x from the right and from the left, respectively.*
For a proof of this theorem you are referred to the classic text by Churchill and Brown. †
EXAMPLE 2 
Convergence of a Point of Discontinuity
The function (12) in Example 1 satisfies the conditions of Theorem 12.2.1. Thus for every x
in the interval (p, p), except at x  0, the series (13) will converge to f (x). At x  0 the 
function is discontinuous, and so the series (13) will converge to
 
f (01)  f (0)

| CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
 Periodic Extension Observe that each of the functions in the basic set (1) has a different 
fundamental period,* namely, 2p/n, n  1, but since a positive integer multiple of a period is also 
a period we see that all of the functions have in common the period 2p (verify). Hence the right-
hand side of (2) is 2p-periodic; indeed, 2p is the fundamental period of the sum. We conclude that 
a Fourier series not only represents the function on the interval (p, p) but also gives the periodic 
extension of f outside this interval. We can now apply Theorem 12.2.1 to the periodic extension 
of f, or we may assume from the outset that the given function is periodic with period T  2p; that 
is, f (x  T )  f (x). When f is piecewise continuous and the right- and left-hand derivatives exist 
at x  p and x  p,  respectively, then the series (8) converges to the average [  f (p)  f (p)]/2 
at these endpoints and to this value extended periodically to 	3p,  	5p,  	7p,  and so on. The 
Fourier series in (13) converges to the periodic extension of (12) on the entire x-axis. At 0, 	2p, 
	4p, …, and at 	p, 	3p, 	5p, …, the series converges to the values

 Sequence of Partial Sums It is interesting to see how the sequence of partial sums {SN(x)} 
of a Fourier series approximates a function. For example, the first three partial sums of (13) are

12.3 Fourier Cosine and Sine Series
INTRODUCTION 
The effort expended in the evaluation of coefficients a0, an , and bn in 
expanding a function f in a Fourier series is reduced significantly when f is either an even or an 
odd function. A function f is said to be
 
even if f (x)  f (x)  and  odd if f (x)  f (x).
On a symmetric interval such as (p, p), the graph of an even function possesses symmetry with 
respect to the y-axis, whereas the graph of an odd function possesses  symmetry with respect to 
the origin.
 Even and Odd Functions It is likely the  origin of the words even and odd derives from 
the fact that the graphs of polynomial functions that consist of all even powers of x are symmetric 

682 
| CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
with respect to the y-axis, whereas graphs of polynomials that consist of all odd powers of x are 
symmetric with respect to the origin. For example, 
 
T
 even integer
 
f (x)  x 2 is even since f (x)  (x)2  x 2  f (x)
 
T 
odd integer
 
  f (x)  x3 is odd since f (x)  (x)3  x3  f (x).
See FIGURES 12.3.1 and 12.3.2. The trigonometric cosine and sine functions are even and odd func-
tions, respectively, since cos (x)  cos x and sin (x)  sin x. The exponential functions 
f (x)  e x and f (x)  ex are neither even nor odd.
 Properties The following theorem lists some properties of even and odd functions.

Theorem 12.3.1 
Properties of Even/Odd Functions
(a) The product of two even functions is even.
(b) The product of two odd functions is even.
(c) The product of an even function and an odd function is odd.
(d) The sum (difference) of two even functions is even.
(e) The sum (difference) of two odd functions is odd.
(f ) If f is even, then e
a
a f (x) dx  2 e
a
0  f (x) dx.
(g) If f is odd, then e
a
a f (x) dx  0.
PROOF OF (b): Let us suppose that f and g are odd functions. Then we have f (x)  f (x) 
and g(x)  g(x). If we define the product of f and g as F(x)  f (x)g(x), then
 
F(x)  f (x)g(x)  (f (x))(g(x))  f (x)g(x)  F(x).
This shows that the product F of two odd functions is an even function. The proofs of the remain-
ing properties are left as exercises. See Problem 56 in Exercises 12.3.
 Cosine and Sine Series If f is an even function on the interval (p, p), then in view of 
the foregoing properties, the coefficients (9), (10), and (11) of Section 12.2 become

 Gibbs Phenomenon With the aid of a CAS we have plotted in FIGURE 12.3.6 the graphs 
S1(x), S2(x), S3(x), S15(x) of the partial sums of nonzero terms of (7). As seen in Figure 12.3.6(d) 
the graph of S15(x) has pronounced spikes near the discontinuities at x  0, x  p, x  p, and 
so on. This “overshooting” by the partial sums SN from the function values near a point of dis-
continuity does not smooth out but remains fairly constant, even when the value N is taken to be 
large. This behavior of a Fourier series near a point at which f is discontinuous is known as the 
Gibbs phenomenon.

The periodic extension of f in Example 2 onto the entire x-axis is a meander function (see 
page 247).
 Half-Range Expansions Throughout the preceding discussion it was understood that 
a function f was defined on an interval with the origin as midpoint, that is, (p, p). However, in 
many instances we are interested in representing a function that is defined on an interval (0, L) 
by a trigonometric series. This can be done in many different ways by supplying an arbitrary 
definition of the function on the interval (L, 0). For brevity we consider the three most important 
cases. If y  f (x) is defined on the interval (0, L), then:
 (i) 
reflect the graph of the function about the y-axis onto (L, 0); the function is now even on 
the interval (L, L) (see FIGURE 12.3.7); or
 (ii) reflect the graph of the function through the origin onto (L, 0); the function is now odd 
on the interval (L, L) (see FIGURE 12.3.8); or
 (iii) define f on (L, 0) by f (x)  f (x  L) (see FIGURE 12.3.9).

12.3 Fourier Cosine and Sine Series 
|
685
Note that the coefficients of the series (1) and (4) utilize only the definition of the function 
on (0, p), that is, for half of the interval (p, p). Hence in practice there is no actual need to make 
the reflections described in (i) and (ii). If f  is defined on (0, L), we simply identify the half-period 
as the length of the interval p  L . The coefficient formulas (2), (3), and (5) and the correspond-
ing series yield either an even or an odd periodic extension of period 2L of the original function. 
The cosine and sine series obtained in this manner are known as half-range expansions. Last, 
in case (iii) we are defining the function values on the interval (L, 0) to be the same as the 
values on (0, L). As in the previous two cases, there is no real need to do this. It can be shown 
that the set of functions in (1) of Section 12.2 is orthogonal on [a, a  2p] for any real number 
a. Choosing a  p, we obtain the limits of integration in (9), (10), and (11) of that section. But 
for a  0 the limits of integration are from x  0 to x  2p. Thus if f is defined over the interval 
(0, L), we identify 2p  L or p  L/2. The resulting Fourier series will give the periodic exten-
sion of f with period L. In this manner the values to which the series converges will be the same 
on (L, 0) as on (0, L).

the force f (t) acts on the system for t  0, note that if we extend the graph of the function in 
a 2-periodic manner to the negative t-axis, we obtain an odd function. In practical terms this 
means that we need only find the half-range sine expansion of f (t)  pt,  0

Observe in the solution (14) that there is no integer n  1 for which the denominator 64  n2p2 
of Bn is zero. In general, if there is a value of n, say, N,  for which Np/p  v, where v  !k>m, 
then the system described by (11) is in a state of pure resonance. In other words, we have pure 
resonance if the Fourier series expansion of the driving force f (t) contains a term sin(Np/L)t 
(or cos(Np/L)t) that has the same frequency as the free vibrations.
Of course, if the 2p-periodic extension of the driving force f onto the negative t-axis yields an 
even function, then we expand f in a cosine series.

average of the two series) we get a series with cosines and

this a full Fourier series of f ? [Hint: What does the averaging

Complex Fourier Series
INTRODUCTION As we have seen in the preceding two sections, a real function f can be 
represented by a series of sines and cosines. The functions cos nx, n  0, 1, 2, … and sin nx, 
n  1, 2, … are real-valued functions of a real variable x. The three different real forms of Fourier 
series given in Definitions 12.2.1 and 12.3.1 will be exceedingly important in Chapters 13 and 
14 when we set about to solve linear partial differential equations. However, in certain applica-
tions, for example, the analysis of periodic signals in electrical engineering, it is actually more 
convenient to represent a function f in an infinite series of complex-valued functions of a real 
variable x such as the exponential functions einx, n  0, 1, 2, …, and where i is the imaginary unit 
defined by i2  1. Recall for x a real number, Euler’s formula
 
eix  cos x  i sin x  gives  eix  cos x  i sin x. 
(1)
In this section we are going to use the results in (1) to recast the Fourier series in Definition 12.2.1 
into a complex form or exponential form. We will see that we can represent a real function by 

 
12.4 Complex Fourier Series 
| 689
a complex series: a series in which the coefficients are complex numbers. To that end, recall that 
a complex number is a number z  a  ib, where a and b are real numbers, and i2  1. The 
number z  a  ib is called the conjugate of z.
 Complex Fourier Series If we first add the two expressions in (1) and solve for cos x 
and then subtract the two expressions and solve for sin x, we arrive at
 
 cos x  eix  eix

ficients (9), (10), and (11) respectively, in Definition 12.2.1. When the function f is real, cn and 
cn are complex conjugates and can also be written in terms of complex exponential functions:

Since the subscripts of the coefficients and exponents range over the entire set of integers…3, 
2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …, we can write the results in (3), (4), (5), and (6) in a more compact manner 
by summing over both the negative and nonnegative integers. In other words, we can use one 
summation and one integral that defines all three coefficients c0, cn ,  and cn.

CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
If f satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 12.2.1, a complex Fourier series converges to f (x) at 
a point of continuity and to the average
 
f (x1)  f (x)
2
at a point of discontinuity.
EXAMPLE 1

We can simplify the coefficients cn somewhat using Euler’s formula:
 
e(in1)p  ep(cos np  i sin np)  (1)nep
and 
e(in1)p  ep(cos np  i sin np)  (1)nep, 
since cos np  (1)n and sin np  0. Hence

The series (10) converges to the 2p-periodic extension of f.
You may get the impression that we have just made life more complicated by introducing a com-
plex version of a Fourier series. The reality of the situation is that in areas of engineering, the form 
(7) given in Definition 12.4.1 is sometimes more useful than that given in (8) of Definition 12.2.1.
 Fundamental Frequency The Fourier series in Definitions 12.2.1 and 12.4.1 define a 
periodic function and the fundamental period of that function (that is, the periodic extension 
of f ) is T  2p. Since p  T/2, (8) of Section 12.2 and (7) become, respectively, 
 
a0
2  a
q
n1
(an cos nvx  bn sin nvx)  and   a
q
nq
cneinvx,  
(11)
where number v  2p/T is called the fundamental angular frequency. In Example 1 the pe-
riodic extension of the function has period T  2p; the fundamental angular  frequency is 
v  2p/2p  1.
 Frequency Spectrum In the study of time-periodic signals, electrical engineers find 
it informative to examine various spectra of a wave form. If f is periodic and has fundamental 
period T,  the plot of the points (nv, |cn|), where v is the fundamental angular frequency and the 
cn are the coefficients defined in (8), is called the frequency spectrum of f.

the following informal rule:
Use the exponential form y  c1eax  c2eax when the domain of x is an infinite or 
semi-infinite interval; use the hyperbolic form y  c1 cosh ax  c2 sinh ax when the domain 
of x is a finite interval. 
 Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions Orthogonal functions arise in the solution of dif-
ferential equations. More to the point, an orthogonal set of functions can be generated by solving 
a two-point boundary-value problem involving a linear second-order differential equation con-
taining a parameter l. In Example 2 of Section 3.9 we saw that the boundary-value problem
 
y  ly  0,  y(0)  0,  y(L)  0,  
(1)
possessed nontrivial solutions only when the parameter l took on the values ln  n2p2/L2, 
n  1, 2, 3, … called eigenvalues. The corresponding nontrivial solutions y  c2 sin(npx/L) or 
simply y  sin(npx/L) are called the eigenfunctions of the problem. For example, for (1) we have
 
not an eigenvalue
 
T
 
BVP: y  5y  0, y(0)  0, y(L)  0
 
Solution is trivial: y  0.
 
is an eigenvalue (n  2)
 
T
 
BVP: y  4p2
L2  y  0, y(0)  0, y(L)  0
 
Solution is nontrivial: y  sin(2px/L).
This rule will be useful in 
Chapters 13 and 14.

For our purposes in this chapter it is important to recognize the set of functions generated by this 
BVP; that is, {sin(npx/L)}, n  1, 2, 3, …, is the orthogonal set of functions on the interval [0, L] 
used as the basis for the Fourier sine series.
EXAMPLE 1 
Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions
It is left as an exercise to show, by considering the three possible cases for the parameter l
(zero, negative, or positive; that is, l  0, l  a2 
 0, a  0, and l  a2  0, a  0), that 
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the boundary-value problem
 
y  ly  0,   y(0)  0,   y(L)  0 
(2)
are, respectively, ln  a2
n  n2p2/L2, n  0, 1, 2, …, and y  c1 cos (npx/L), c1 Z 0. In contrast 
to (1), l0  0 is an eigenvalue for this BVP and y  1 is the corresponding eigenfunction. The 
latter comes from solving y  0 subject to the same boundary conditions y(0)  0, y(L)  0. 
Note also that y  1 can be incorporated into the family y  cos (npx/L) by permitting n  0. 
The set {cos (npx/L)}, n  0, 1, 2, 3, …, is orthogonal on the interval [0, L]. See Problem 3 
in Exercises 12.5. 
 Regular Sturm–Liouville Problem The problems in (1) and (2) are special cases of an 
important general two-point boundary-value problem. Let p, q, r, and r be real-valued functions 
continuous on an interval [a, b], and let r (x)  0 and p(x)  0 for every x in the interval. Then
Solve: 
d
dx [r(x)y]  (q(x)  lp(x))y  0 
(3)
Subject to: A1y(a)  B1y(a)  0 
(4)
 
A2 y(b)  B2 y(b)  0 
(5)
is said to be a regular Sturm–Liouville problem. The coefficients in the boundary conditions (4) 
and (5) are assumed to be real and independent of l. In addition, A1 and B1 are not both zero, and A2 
and B2 are not both zero. The boundary-value problems in (1) and (2) are regular Sturm–Liouville 
problems. From (1) we can identify r(x)  1, q(x)  0, and p(x)  1 in the differential equation (3); 
in boundary condition (4) we identify a  0, A1  1, B1  0, and in (5), b  L, A2  1, B2  0. From 
(2) the identifications would be a  0, A1  0, B1  1 in (4), and b  L, A2  0, B2  1 in (5).
The differential equation (3) is linear and homogeneous. The boundary conditions in (4) and (5), 
both a linear combination of y and y equal to zero at a point, are also called homogeneous. A 
boundary condition such as A2 y(b)  B2 y(b)  C2, where C2 is a nonzero constant, is non-
homogeneous. Naturally, a boundary-value problem that consists of a homogeneous linear dif-
ferential equation and homogeneous boundary conditions is said to be homogeneous; otherwise 
it is nonhomogeneous. The boundary conditions (4) and (5) are said to be separated because 
each condition involves only a single boundary point. Boundary conditions are referred to as 
mixed if each condition involves both boundary points x  a and x  b. For example, the periodic 
boundary conditions y(a)  y(b), y(a)  y(b) are mixed boundary conditions.
Because a regular Sturm–Liouville problem is a homogeneous BVP, it always possesses the trivial 
solution y  0. However, this solution is of no interest to us. As in Example 1, in solving such a problem 
we seek numbers l (eigenvalues) and nontrivial solutions y that depend on l (eigenfunctions).
 Properties Theorem 12.5.1 is a list of some of the more important of the many properties 
of the regular Sturm–Liouville problem. We shall prove only the last property.

respect to the weight function p(x) on the interval [a, b].

CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
PROOF OF (d): Let ym and yn be eigenfunctions corresponding to eigenvalues lm and ln ,
respectively. Then
d
dx [r (x)ym ]  (q(x)  lm p(x))ym  0 
(6)
d
dx [r (x)yn ]  (q(x)  ln p(x))yn  0. 
(7)
Multiplying (6) by yn and (7) by ym and subtracting the two equations gives
(lm 2 ln) p(x)ymyn  ym d
dx fr (x) yn9g 2 yn d
dx fr (x)ym9g.
Integrating this last result by parts from x  a to x  b then yields 
(lm  ln)#
b
a
p(x)ym yn dx  r (b) [ym(b) yn9(b)  yn(b)ym9(b)] 
 r (a)[ ym(a)yn9(a)  yn(a)ym9(a)]. (8)
Now the eigenfunctions ym and yn must both satisfy the boundary conditions (4) and (5). In 
particular, from (4) we have
 
A1ym(a)  B1ym9(a)  0
 
A1yn(a)  B1yn9(a)  0.
For this system to be satisfied by A1 and B1, not both zero, the determinant of the coefficients 
must be zero:
 
ym(a)yn9(a)  yn(a)ym9(a)  0.
A similar argument applied to (5) also gives
 
ym(b)yn9(b)  yn(b)ym9(b)  0.
Using these last two results in (8) shows that both members of the right-hand side are zero. Hence 
we have established the orthogonality relation
 
#

a
 p(x)ym(x)yn(x) dx  0,  lm Z ln. 
(9) 
It can also be proved that the orthogonal set of eigenfunctions {y1(x), y2(x), y3(x), …} of a 
regular Sturm–Liouville problem is complete on [a, b]. See page 675.
EXAMPLE 2 
A Regular Sturm–Liouville Problem
Solve the boundary-value problem
 
y  ly  0,   y(0)  0,   y(1)  y(1)  0. 
(10)
SOLUTION You should verify that for l  0 and for l  a2 
 0, where a  0, the BVP 
in (10) possesses only the trivial solution y  0. For l  a2  0, a  0, the general solution 
of the differential equation y  a2y  0 is y  c1cos ax  c2sin ax. Now the condition 
y(0)  0 implies c1  0 in this solution and so we are left with y  c2 sin ax. The second 
boundary condition y(1)  y(1)  0 is satisfied if
 
c2 sin a  c2a cos a  0.
Choosing c2 Z 0, we see that the last equation is equivalent to
 
 tan a  a. 
(11)
If we let x  a in (11), then FIGURE 12.5.1 shows the plausibility that there exists an infinite 
number of roots of the equation tan x  x, namely, the x-coordinates of the points where 
FIGURE 12.5.1 Positive roots of

12.5 Sturm–Liouville Problem

the graph of y  x intersects the branches of the graph of y  tan x. The eigenvalues of 
problem (10) are then ln  an
2, where an, n  1, 2, 3, …, are the consecutive positive roots 
a1, a2, a3, … of (11). With the aid of a CAS it is easily shown that, to four rounded decimal 
places, a1  2.0288, a2  4.9132, a3  7.9787, and a4  11.0855, and the corresponding 
solutions are y1  sin 2.0288x, y2  sin 4.9132x, y3  sin 7.9787x,  and y4  sin 11.0855x. 
In general, the eigenfunctions of the problem are {sin an x}, n  1, 2, 3, ….
With identifications r (x)  1, q(x)  0, p(x)  1, A1  1, B1  0, A2  1, and B2  1 we 
see that (10) is a regular Sturm–Liouville problem. Thus {sin an x}, n  1, 2, 3, … is an or-
thogonal set with respect to the weight function p(x)  1 on the interval [0, 1].
In some circumstances we can prove the orthogonality of the solutions of (3) without the 
necessity of specifying a boundary condition at x  a and at x  b.
 Singular Sturm–Liouville Problem There are several other important conditions 
under which we seek nontrivial solutions of the differential equation (3):
• r (a)  0 and a boundary condition of the type given in (5) is specified at x  b; 
(12)
• r (b)  0 and a boundary condition of the type given in (4) is specified at x  a; 
(13)
• r (a)  r (b)  0 and no boundary condition is specified at either x  a or at x  b; (14)
• r (a)  r (b) and boundary conditions y(a)  y(b), y(a)  y(b). 
(15)
The differential equation (3) along with one of conditions (12) or (13) is said to be a singular 
boundary-value problem. Equation (3) with the conditions specified in (15) is said to be a 
periodic boundary-value problem because the boundary conditions are periodic. Observe that 
if, say, r (a)  0, then x  a may be a singular point of the differential equation, and consequently 
a solution of (3) may become unbounded as x S a. However, we see from (8) that if r (a)  0, 
then no boundary condition is required at x  a to prove orthogonality of the eigenfunctions 
provided these solutions are bounded at that point. This latter requirement guarantees the existence 
of the integrals involved. By assuming the solutions of (3) are bounded on the closed interval [a, b] 
we can see from inspection of (8) that
•  If r (a)  0, then the orthogonality relation (9) holds with no boundary
condition at x  a; 
(16)
•  If r (b)  0, then the orthogonality relation (9) holds with no boundary
condition at x  b*; 
(17)
•  If r (a)  r (b)  0, then the orthogonality relation (9) holds with no boundary
conditions specified at either x  a or x  b; 
(18)
•  If r (a)  r (b), then the orthogonality relation (9) holds with the periodic
boundary conditions y(a)  y(b), y(a)  y(b). 
(19)
 Self-Adjoint Form If we carry out the differentiation d
dx fr (x)y9g, the differential 
 equation in (3) is the same as
 
r (x)y0  r9(x)y9  (q(x)  lp(x))y  0. 
(20)
For example, Legendre’s differential equation (1 2 x2 )y0 2 2xy9  n(n  1)y  0 is exactly 
of the form given in (20) with r (x)  1 2 x2 and r9(x)  2x. In other words, another way of 
writing Legendre’s DE is
 
d
dx
 f(1 2 x2)y9g  n(n  1)y  0. 
(21)
But if you compare other second-order DEs (say, Bessel’s equation, Cauchy–Euler equations, 
and DEs with constant coefficients) you might believe, given the coefficient of y is the derivative 
of the coefficient of y, that few other second-order DEs have the form given in (3). On the con-
trary, if the coefficients are continuous and a(x) Z 0 for all x in some interval, then any second-
order differential equation
 
a(x)y  b(x)y  (c(x)  ld(x))y  0 
(22)
*Conditions (16) and (17) are equivalent to choosing A1  0, B1  0 in (4), and A2  0, B2  0 in (5), 
respectively.

CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
can be recast into the so-called self-adjoint form (3). To see this, we proceed as in Section 2.3 
where we rewrote a linear first-order equation a1(x)y9  a0(x)y  0 in the form d
dx
 fµyg  0 by 
dividing the equation by a1(x) and then multiplying by the integrating factor µ  eeP(x) dx where, 
assuming no common factors, P(x)  a0(x)/a1(x). So first, we divide (22) by a(x). The first two 
terms are then Y9  b(x)
a(x)Y  p where, for emphasis, we have written Y  y. Second, we mul-
tiply this equation by the integrating factor ee(b(x)>a(x)) dx, where a(x) and b(x) are assumed to have 
no common factors
 ee(b(x)>a(x)) dx
 Y9  b(x)
a(x)
 ee(b(x)>a(x)) dx

 fee(b(x)>a(x)) dx
 Yg  p  d

In summary, by dividing (22) by a(x) and then multiplying by ee(b(x)>a(x)) dx we get
 
ee(b>a) dx
 y0  b(x)

 ee(b>a) dx
 y9  ac(x)
a(x)
 ee(b>a) dx  l d(x)
a(x)

(23)
Equation (23) is the desired form given in (20) and is the same as (3):

 ee(b>a) dx  l d(x)

 ee(b>a) dxby  0.

For example, to express 3y  6y  ly  0 in self-adjoint form, we write y  2y  l1
3 y  0 
and then multiply by ee2 dx  e2x. The resulting equation is

3e2x y  0.
It is certainly not necessary to put a second-order differential equation (22) into the self-adjoint 
form (3) in order to solve the DE. For our purposes we use the form given in (3) to determine the 
weight function p(x) needed in the orthogonality relation (9). The next two examples illustrate 
orthogonality relations for Bessel functions and for Legendre polynomials. 
EXAMPLE 3 
Parametric Bessel Equation
In Section 5.3 we saw that the general solution of the parametric Bessel differential equation 
x 2y  xy  (a2x 2  n2)y  0, n  0, 1, 2, … is y  c1Jn(ax)  c2Yn(ax). After dividing the 
parametric Bessel equation by the lead coefficient x 2 and multiplying the resulting equation 
by the integrating factor ee(1>x) dx  eln x  x, x . 0, we obtain the self-adjoint form
 
xy0  y9  aa2x 2 n2
x b y  0  or   d
dx
 fxy9g  aa2x 2 n2
x b y  0, 
where we identify r (x)  x, q(x)  n2/x,  p(x)  x, and l  a2. Now r(0)  0, and of the 
two solutions Jn(ax) and Yn(a x) only Jn(a x) is bounded at x  0. Thus in view of (16) above, 
the set {Jn(ai x)}, i  1, 2, 3, …, is orthogonal with respect to the weight function p(x)  x on 
an interval [0, b]. The orthogonality relation is

(24)
provided the ai, and hence the eigenvalues li  a2
i ,  i  1, 2, 3, …, are defined by means of 
a boundary condition at x  b of the type given in (5):
 
A2Jn(lb)  B2aJn(ab)  0. 
(25)
Note.

The extra factor of a in (25) comes from the Chain Rule:
d
dx Jn(ax)  Jn9(ax) d
dx ax  aJn9(ax).
For any choice of A2 and B2, not both zero, it is known that (25) has an infinite number of roots 
xi  ai b. The eigenvalues are then li  a2
i   (xi /b)2. More will be said about eigenvalues in the 
next chapter.
EXAMPLE 4 
Legendre’s Equation
From the result given in (21) we can identify q(x)  0, p(x)  1, and l  n(n  1). Recall 
from Section 5.3 when n  0, 1, 2, … Legendre’s DE possesses polynomial solutions Pn(x). 
Now we can put the observation that r (1)  r (1)  0 together with the fact that the
Legendre polynomials Pn(x) are the only solutions of (21) that are bounded on the closed 
interval [1, 1], to conclude from (18) that the set {Pn(x)}, n  0, 1, 2, …, is orthogonal with 
respect to the weight function p(x)  1 on [1, 1]. The orthogonality relation is

REMARKS
(i) A Sturm–Liouville problem is also considered to be singular when the interval under 
consideration is infinite. See Problems 9 and 10 in Exercises 12.5.
(ii) Even when the conditions on the coefficients p, q, r, and r are as assumed in the regular 
Sturm–Liouville problem, if the boundary conditions are periodic, then property (b) of 
Theorem 12.5.1 does not hold. You are asked to show in Problem 4 of Exercises 12.5 that

12.6 
Bessel and Legendre Series
INTRODUCTION Fourier series, Fourier cosine series, and Fourier sine series are three ways 
of expanding a function in terms of an orthogonal set of functions. But such expansions are by 
no means limited to orthogonal sets of trigonometric functions. We saw in Section 12.1 that a 
function f defined on an interval (a, b) could be expanded, at least in a formal manner, in terms 
of any set of functions {fn(x)} that is orthogonal with respect to a weight function on [a, b]. 
Many of these orthogonal series expansions or generalized Fourier series derive from Sturm–
Liouville problems that, in turn, arise from attempts to solve linear partial differential equations 
serving as models for physical systems. Fourier series and orthogonal series expansions (the 
latter includes the two series considered in this section) will appear in the subsequent consider-
ation of these applications in Chapters 13 and 14.
12.6.1 Fourier–Bessel Series
We saw in Example 3 of Section 12.5 that for a fixed value of n the set of Bessel functions 
{Jn(ai x)}, i  1, 2, 3, … , is orthogonal with respect to the weight function p(x)  x on an inter-
val [0, b] when the ai are defined by means of a boundary condition of the form

convenience we reproduce those relations here:

 Square Norm The value of the square norm (4) depends on how the eigenvalues 
li  a2
i  are defined. If y  Jn(ax), then we know from Example 3 of Section 12.5 that
 
d
dx fxy9g  aa2x 2 n2
x b y  0.
After we multiply by 2xy, this equation can be written as
 
d
dx fxy9g2  (a2x2 2 n2 ) d
dx fyg2  0.
Integrating the last result by parts on [0, b] then gives

.
Since y  Jn(ax), the lower limit is zero for n  0 because Jn(0)  0. For n  0, the quantity 
[xy]2  a2x 2y2 is zero at x  0. Thus

where we have used the Chain Rule to write y  aJn(ax).
We now consider three cases of the boundary condition (1).
Case I: If we choose A2  1 and B2  0, then (1) is
 
      Jn(ab)  0. 
(8)
 
There are an infinite number of positive roots xi  aib of (8) (see Figure 5.3.1) that 
define the ai as ai  xi /b. The eigenvalues are positive and are then li  a2
i  x2
i  /b2. 
No new eigenvalues result from the negative roots of (8) since Jn(x)  (1)nJn(x). 
(See page 284.) The number 0 is not an eigenvalue for any n since Jn(0)  0 for 
n  1, 2, 3, … and J0(0)  1. In other words, if l  0, we get the trivial function 
(which is never an eigenfunction) for n  1, 2, 3, … , and for n  0, l  0 (or 
equivalently, a  0) does not satisfy the equation in (8). When (6) is written in the 
form x Jn(x)  n Jn(x)  x Jn1(x), it follows from (7) and (8) that the square norm 
of Jn(ai x) is
 
      
i  Jn(ai x)i2  b2
2  J 2
n1(ai b). 
(9)
Case II: If we choose A2  h  0, B2  b, then (1) is
 
      h Jn(a b)  a bJ n(a b)  0. 
(10)
 
Equation (10) has an infinite number of positive roots xi  aib for each positive in-
teger n  1, 2, 3, …. As before, the eigenvalues are obtained from li  a2
i  x2
i  /b2. 
l  0 is not an eigenvalue for n  1, 2, 3, …. Substituting aibJn(aib)  hJn(aib) 
into (7), we find that the square norm of Jn(ai x) is now
 
      
iJn(ai x)i2  a2

      J0(a b)  0. 
(12)

| CHAPTER 12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series
 
Even though (12) is just a special case of (10), it is the only situation for which l  0 
is an eigenvalue. To see this, observe that for n  0, the result in (6) implies that 
J0(ab)  0 is equivalent to J1(ab)  0. Since x1  aib  0 is a root of the last equa-
tion, a1  0, and because J0(0)  1 is nontrivial, we conclude from l1  a2
1  x2
1>b2 
that l1  0 is an eigenvalue. But obviously we cannot use (11) when a1  0, h  0, 
and n  0. However, from the square norm (4) we have

 Convergence of a Fourier–Bessel Series Sufficient conditions for the convergence 
of a Fourier–Bessel series are not particularly restrictive.
Theorem 12.6.1 
Conditions for Convergence
Let f and f  be piecewise continuous on the interval [0, b]. Then for all x in the interval (0, b), 
the Fourier–Bessel series of f converges to f (x) at a point where f is continuous and to the 
average 
 
 f (x1)  f (x)

at a point where f is discontinous.

You are asked to find the first four values of the ai for the foregoing Bessel series in Problem 1 
in Exercises 12.6.
EXAMPLE 2 
Expansion in a Fourier–Bessel Series
If the ai in Example 1 are defined by J1(3a)  aJ91(3a)  0, then the only thing that changes 
in the expansion is the value of the square norm. Multiplying the boundary condition by 3 
gives 3 J1(3a)  3aJ91(3a)  0, which now matches (10) when h  3, b  3, and n  1. Thus 
(18) and (17) yield, in turn,

 Use of Computers Since Bessel functions are “built-in functions” in a CAS, it is a straight-
forward task to find the approximate values of the ai and the coefficients ci in a Fourier–Bessel series. 
For example, in (9) we can think of xi  aib as a positive root of the equation h Jn(x)  x Jn(x)  0. 
Thus in Example 2 we have used a CAS to find the first five positive roots xi of 3J1(x)  x J91(x)  0 
and from these roots we obtain the first five values of ai: a1  x1 /3  0.98320, a2  x2/3  1.94704, 
a3  x3/3  2.95758, a4  x4 /3  3.98538, and a5  x5 /3  5.02078. Knowing the roots xi  3ai 
and the ai , we again use a CAS to calculate the numerical values of J2(3ai), J 2
1(3ai), and finally 
the co efficients ci. In this manner we find that the fifth partial sum S5(x) for the Fourier–Bessel 
series representation of f (x)  x, 0 
 x 
 3 in Example 2 is
 
S5(x)  4.01844 J1(0.98320x)  1.86937 J1(1.94704x)
 
 1.07106 J1(2.95758x)  0.70306 J1(3.98538x)  0.50343 J1(5.02078x).
The graph of S5(x) on the interval (0, 3) is shown in FIGURE 12.6.1(a). In Figure 12.6.1(b) we have 
graphed S10(x) on the interval (0, 50). Notice that outside the interval of definition (0, 3) the series 
does not converge to a periodic extension of f  because Bessel functions are not periodic functions. 
See Problems 11 and 12 in Exercises 12.6.
12.6.2 Fourier–Legendre Series
From Example 4 of Section 12.5 we know that the set of Legendre polynomials {Pn(x)}, 
n  0, 1, 2, …, is orthogonal with respect to the weight function p(x)  1 on the interval [1, 1].

12.6 Bessel and Legendre Series 
| 703
Like the Bessel functions, Legendre polynomials are built-in functions in computer algebra 
systems such as Mathematica and Maple, and so each of the coefficients just listed can be found 
using the integration application of such a program. Indeed, using a CAS, we further find that 
c6  0 and c7   65

function f defined in Example 3 is then

16 P3(x)  11

256 P7(x).
The graph of S5(x) on the interval (1, 1) is given in FIGURE 12.6.2.
 Alternative Form of Series In applications, the Fourier–Legendre series appears in 
an alternative form. If we let x  cos u, then x  1 implies u  0, whereas x  1 implies u  p. 
Since dx  sin u du, (21) and (22) become, respectively,

In this and the next two chapters, 
the emphasis will be on two 
procedures that are frequently 
used in solving problems 
involving temperatures, 
oscillatory displacements, and 
potentials. These problems, called 
boundary-value problems (BVPs) 
are described by relatively simple 
linear second-order partial 
differential equations (PDEs). The 
thrust of both procedures is to 
find particular solutions of a PDE 
by reducing it to one or more 
ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs).

13.1 
Separable Partial Differential Equations
INTRODUCTION Partial differential equations (PDEs), like ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs), are classified as linear or nonlinear. Analogous to a linear ODE (see (6) of Section 1.1), 
the dependent variable and its partial derivatives appear only to the first power in a linear PDE. In 
this and the chapters that follow, we are concerned only with linear partial differential equations.
 Linear Partial Differential Equation If we let u denote the dependent variable and 
x and y the independent variables, then the general form of a linear second-order partial dif-
ferential equation is given by
A 02u
0x2  B 02u
0x0y  C 02u
0y2  D 0u
0x  E 0u
0y  Fu  G, 
(1)
where the coefficients A, B, C, … , G are constants or functions of x and y. When G(x, y)  0, 
equation (1) is said to be homogeneous; otherwise, it is nonhomogeneous. 
EXAMPLE 1 
Linear Second-Order PDEs
The equations
02u
0x2  02u
0y2  0  and  02u
0x2 2 0u
0y  xy
are examples of linear second-order PDEs. The first equation is homogeneous and the second 
is nonhomogeneous.
 Solution of a PDE A solution of a linear partial differential equation (1) is a function 
u(x, y) of two independent variables that possesses all partial derivatives occurring in the equation 
and that satisfies the equation in some region of the xy-plane.
It is not our intention to examine procedures for finding general solutions of linear partial 
differential equations. Not only is it often difficult to obtain a general solution of a linear second-
order PDE, but a general solution is usually not all that useful in applications. Thus our focus 
throughout will be on finding particular solutions of some of the important linear PDEs, that is, 
equations that appear in many applications.
 Separation of Variables Although there are several methods that can be tried to find 
particular solutions of a linear PDE, the one we are interested in at the moment is called the 
method of separation of variables. In this method if we are seeking a particular solution of, say, 
a linear second-order PDE in which the independent variables are x and y, then we seek to find 
a particular solution in the form of product of a function x and a function of y:
 
u(x, y)  X(x)Y( y).
With this assumption, it is sometimes possible to reduce a linear PDE in two variables to two 
ODEs. To this end we observe that
 
0u
0x  X9Y,  0u
0y  XY9,  02u
0x2  X0Y,  02u
0y2  XY0,
where the primes denote ordinary differentiation.
EXAMPLE 2 
Using Separation of Variables
Find product solutions of 02u
0x2  4 0u
0y.
SOLUTION Substituting u(x, y)  X(x)Y( y) into the partial differential equation yields
 
X Y  4XY .
After dividing both sides by 4XY, we have separated the variables:
 
X0
4X  Y9
Y .
We are interested only in 
particular solutions of PDEs.

 
13.1 Separable Partial Differential Equations 
| 709
Since the left-hand side of the last equation is independent of y and is equal to the right-hand 
side, which is independent of x, we conclude that both sides of the equation are independent 
of x and y. In other words, each side of the equation must be a constant. As a practical matter 
it is convenient to write this real separation constant as l. From the two equalities, 
 
X0
4X  Y9
Y  l
we obtain the two linear ordinary differential equations
 
X   4lX  0  and  Y   lY  0. 
(2)
For the three cases for l: zero, negative, or positive; that is, l  0, l  a2  0, and 
l  a2  0, where a  0, the ODEs in (2) are, in turn, 
 
X   0        and  Y  0,  
(3)
 
X   4a2X  0  and  Y  a2Y  0,  
(4)
 
X   4a2X  0  and  Y  a2Y  0. 
(5)
Case I (l  0): 
The DEs in (3) can be solved by integration. The solutions are 
X  c1  c2    x and Y  c3. Thus a particular product solution of the 
given PDE is
 
            u  XY  (c1  c2x)c3  A1  B1x,  
(6)
where we have replaced c1c3 and c2c3 by A1 and B1, respectively.
Case II (l  a 2): The general solutions of the DEs in (4) are
 
                 X  c4 cosh 2ax  c5 sinh 2ax and Y  c6ea2y, 
respectively. Thus, another particular product solution of the PDE is
 
             u  XY  (c4 cosh 2ax  c5 sinh 2ax) c6ea2y
or      u  A2ea2y cosh 2ax  B2ea2y sinh 2ax,  
(7)
where A2  c4c6 and B2  c5c6.
Case III (l  a 2): 
Finally, the general solutions of the DEs in (5) are
 
               X  c7 cos 2ax  c8 sin 2ax and Y  c9ea2y, 
respectively. These results give yet another particular solution
 
         
u  A3ea2y cos 2ax  B3ea2y sin 2ax,  
(8)
where A3  c7c9 and B3  c8c9.
It is left as an exercise to verify that (6), (7), and (8) satisfy the given partial differential equa-
tion uxx  4uy. See Problem 29 in Exercises 13.1.
Separation of variables is not a general method for finding particular solutions; some linear 
partial differential equations are simply not separable. You should verify that the assumption 
u  XY does not lead to a solution for 0 2u/0x2  0u/0y  x.
 Superposition Principle The following theorem is analogous to Theorem 3.1.2 and 
is known as the superposition principle.
See Example 2, Section 3.9 
and Example 1, Section 12.5.
Theorem 13.1.1 
Superposition Principle
If u1, u2, … , uk are solutions of a homogeneous linear partial differential equation, then the 
linear combination
 
u  c1u1  c2u2  p  ckuk ,
where the ci , i  1, 2, … , k are constants, is also a solution.

CHAPTER 13 Boundary-Value Problems in Rectangular Coordinates
Throughout the remainder of the chapter we shall assume that whenever we have an infinite 
set u1, u2, u3, … of solutions of a homogeneous linear equation, we can construct yet another 
 solution u by forming the infinite series
u  a

k51
ckuk,
where the ck , k  1, 2, … , are constants.
 Classification of Equations A linear second-order partial differential equation in two 
independent variables with constant coefficients can be classified as one of three types. This 
classification depends only on the coefficients of the second-order derivatives. Of course, we 
assume that at least one of the coefficients A, B, and C is not zero.
Definition 13.1.1 
Classification of Equations
The linear second-order partial differential equation
A 02u
0x2  B 02u
0x0y  C 02u
0y2  D 0u
0x  E 0u
0y  Fu  G,
where A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are real constants, is said to be
 
hyperbolic if 
B2  4AC  0, 
 
parabolic if 
B2  4AC  0, 
 
elliptic if 
B2  4AC  0.
EXAMPLE 3 
Classifying Linear Second-Order PDEs
Classify the following equations:
(a) 3 02u
0x2  0u
0y  (b)   02u
0x2  02u
0y2  (c)   02u
0x2  02u
0y2  0.
SOLUTION (a)  By rewriting the given equation as
3 02u
0x2 2 0u
0y  0
we can make the identifications A  3, B  0, and C  0. Since B2  4AC  0, the equa-
tion is parabolic.
(b) By rewriting the equation as
 
02u
0x2 2 02u
0y2  0, 
we see that A  1, B  0, C  1, and B2  4AC  4(1)(1)  0. The equation is 
 hyperbolic.
(c) With A  1, B  0, C  1, and B2  4AC  4(1)(1)  0, the equation is elliptic.
REMARKS
(i) Separation of variables is not a general method for finding particular solutions of linear 
partial differential equations. Some equations are simply not separable. You are encouraged 
to verify that the assumption u(x, y)  X(x)Y(y) does not lead to a solution of the linear second-
order PDE 02u>0x2  0u>0x  y.
(ii) A detailed explanation of why the classifications given in Definition 13.1.1 are important 
is beyond the scope of this text. But you should at least be aware that these classifications do 
have a practical importance. Beginning in Section 13.3 we are going to solve some PDEs 
subject to both boundary and initial conditions. The kinds of side conditions appropriate for 
a given equation depend on whether the equation is hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic. Also, 
we shall see in Chapter 16 that numerical solution methods for linear second-order PDEs 
differ in conformity with the classification of the equation.

or slight variations of these equations. These classical equations of mathematical physics are 
known, respectively, as the one-dimensional heat equation, the one- dimensional wave equation, 
and Laplace’s equation in two dimensions. “One-dimensional” refers to the fact that x denotes 
a spatial dimension whereas t represents time; “two dimensional” in (3) means that x and y are 
both spatial dimensions. Laplace’s equation is abbreviated 	 2u  0, where
 
=2u  02u
0x2  02u

is called the two-dimensional Laplacian of the function u. In three dimensions the Laplacian 
of u is
 
=2u  02u
0x 2  02u
0y2  02u
0z
 2.
By comparing equations (1)(3) with the linear second-order PDE given in Definition 13.1.1, 
with t playing the part of y, we see that the heat equation (1) is parabolic, the wave equation (2) 
is hyperbolic, and Laplace’s equation (3) is elliptic. This classification is important in 
Chapter 16.
 Heat Equation Equation (1) occurs in the theory of heat flow—that is, heat transferred 
by conduction in a rod or thin wire. The function u(x, t) is temperature. Problems in mechanical 
vibrations often lead to the wave equation (2). For purposes of discussion, a solution u(x, t) of 
(2) will represent the displacement of an idealized string. Finally, a solution u(x, y) of Laplace’s 
equation (3) can be interpreted as the steady-state (that is, time- independent) temperature distri-
bution throughout a thin, two-dimensional plate.
Even though we have to make many simplifying assumptions, it is worthwhile to see how 
equations such as (1) and (2) arise.
Suppose a thin circular rod of length L has a cross-sectional area A and coincides with the 
x-axis on the interval [0, L]. See FIGURE 13.2.1. Let us suppose:
• The flow of heat within the rod takes place only in the x-direction.
•  The lateral, or curved, surface of the rod is insulated; that is, no heat escapes from this 
surface.
• No heat is being generated within the rod by either chemical or electrical means.
• The rod is homogeneous; that is, its mass per unit volume r is a constant.
• The specific heat g and thermal conductivity K of the material of the rod are constants.
To derive the partial differential equation satisfied by the temperature u(x, t), we need two 
empirical laws of heat conduction:
 (i) The quantity of heat Q in an element of mass m is
 
Q  g m u,  
(4)
 
 where u is the temperature of the element.
 (ii) The rate of heat flow Qt through the cross section indicated in Figure 13.2.1 is propor-
tional to the area A of the cross section and the partial derivative with respect to x of the 
temperature:
 
Qt  K Aux. 
(5)
Since heat flows in the direction of decreasing temperature, the minus sign in (5) is used to ensure 
that Qt is positive for ux  0 (heat flow to the right) and negative for ux  0 (heat flow to the left). 
If the circular slice of the rod shown in Figure 13.2.1 between x and x  
 x is very thin, then 
u(x, t) can be taken as the approximate temperature at each point in the interval. Now the mass 
of the slice is m  r(A 
 x), and so it follows from (4) that the quantity of heat in it is
 
Q  grA 
 x u. 
(6)
Furthermore, when heat flows in the positive x-direction, we see from (5) that heat builds up in 
the slice at the net rate
 
K Aux(x, t)  [K Aux(x  
 x, t)]  K A[ux(x  
 x, t)  ux(x, t)].

13.2 Classical PDEs and Boundary-Value Problems 
| 713
By differentiating (6) with respect to t we see that this net rate is also given by
 
Qt  grA 
x ut . 
(8)
Equating (7) and (8) gives
 
K
gr ux(x  Dx, t) 2 ux(x, t)
Dx
 ut . 
(9)
Taking the limit of (9) as 
x S 0 finally yields (1) in the form*
 
K
gr uxx  ut .
It is customary to let k  K/gr and call this positive constant the thermal diffusivity.
 Wave Equation Consider a string of length L, such as a guitar string, stretched taut be-
tween two points on the x-axis—say, x  0 and x  L. When the string starts to vibrate, assume 
that the motion takes place in the xy-plane in such a manner that each point on the string moves 
in a direction perpendicular to the x-axis (transverse vibrations). As shown in FIGURE 13.2.2(a), let 
u(x, t) denote the vertical displacement of any point on the string measured from the x-axis for 
t  0. We further assume:
• The string is perfectly flexible.
• The string is homogeneous; that is, its mass per unit length r is a constant.
• The displacements u are small compared to the length of the string.
• The slope of the curve is small at all points.
• The tension T acts tangent to the string, and its magnitude T is the same at all points.
• The tension is large compared with the force of gravity.
• No other external forces act on the string.
Now in Figure 13.2.2(b) the tensions T1 and T2 are tangent to the ends of the curve on the 
interval [x, x  
x]. For small values of u1 and u2 the net vertical force acting on the correspond-
ing element 
s of the string is then
 
T sin u2  T sin u1  T tan u2  T tan u1
 
            T [ux(x  
 x, t)  ux(x, t)],†
where T  |T1|  |T2|. Now r 
s  r 
 x is the mass of the string on [x, x  
 x], and so Newton’s 
second law gives
 
   T [ux(x  
 x, t)  ux(x, t)]  r 
 x utt
or 
ux (x  Dx, t) 2 ux(x, t)
Dx
 r
T utt.
If the limit is taken as 
x S 0, the last equation becomes uxx  (r/T )utt. This of course is (2) with 
a2  T/r.
 Laplace’s Equation Although we shall not present its derivation, Laplace’s equation 
in two and three dimensions occurs in time-independent problems involving potentials such as 
electrostatic, gravitational, and velocity in fluid mechanics. Moreover, a solution of Laplace’s 
equation can also be interpreted as a steady-state temperature distribution. As  illustrated in 
FIGURE 13.2.3, a solution u(x, y) of (3) could represent the temperature that varies from point to 
point—but not with time—of a rectangular plate.
We often wish to find solutions of equations (1), (2), and (3) that satisfy certain side 
conditions.

 Initial Conditions Since solutions of (1) and (2) depend on time t, we can prescribe 
what happens at t  0; that is, we can give initial conditions (IC). If f (x) denotes the initial 
temperature distribution throughout the rod in Figure 13.2.1, then a solution u(x, t) of (1) must 
satisfy the single initial condition u(x, 0)  f (x), 0  x  L. On the other hand, for a vibrating 
string, we can specify its initial displacement (or shape) f (x) as well as its initial velocity g(x). 
In mathematical terms we seek a function u(x, t) satisfying (2) and the two initial conditions:
 
u(x, 0)  f (x),  0u
0t 2
 t0
 g(x),  0 , x , L. 
(10)
For example, the string could be plucked, as shown in FIGURE 13.2.4, and released from rest 
(g(x)  0).
 Boundary Conditions The string in Figure 13.2.4 is secured to the x-axis at x  0 and 
x  L for all time. We interpret this by the two boundary conditions (BC):
 
u(0, t)  0,   u(L, t)  0,   t  0.
Note that in this context the function f in (10) is continuous, and consequently f (0)  0 and 
f (L)  0. In general, there are three types of boundary conditions associated with equations (1), 
(2), and (3). On a boundary we can specify the values of one of the following:
 
(i) u,   (ii) 0u
0n,   or  (iii) 0u
0n  hu,  h a constant.
Here 0u/0n denotes the normal derivative of u (the directional derivative of u in the direction 
perpendicular to the boundary). A boundary condition of the first type (i) is called a Dirichlet 
condition, a boundary condition of the second type (ii) is called a Neumann condition, and a 
boundary condition of the third type (iii) is known as a Robin condition. For example, for t  0 
a typical condition at the right-hand end of the rod in Figure 13.2.1 can be
 
(i) 
u(L, t)  u0 ,  u0 a constant, 
 
(ii) 
0u
0x
 2
 xL
  0,  or
 
(iii) 0u
0x
 2
 xL
  h(u(L, t)  um),  h  0 and um constants.
Condition (i) simply states that the boundary x  L is held by some means at a constant tem-
perature u0 for all time t  0. Condition (ii) indicates that the boundary x  L is  insulated. From 
the empirical law of heat transfer, the flux of heat across a boundary (that is, the amount of heat 
per unit area per unit time conducted across the boundary) is proportional to the value of the 
normal derivative 0u/0n of the temperature u. Thus when the boundary x  L is thermally insu-
lated, no heat flows into or out of the rod and so
 
0u
0x
 2
 xL
 0.
We can interpret (iii) to mean that heat is lost from the right-hand end of the rod by being in 
contact with a medium, such as air or water, that is held at a constant temperature. From Newton’s 
law of cooling, the outward flux of heat from the rod is proportional to the difference between 
the temperature u(L, t) at the boundary and the temperature um of the surrounding medium. We 
note that if heat is lost from the left-hand end of the rod, the boundary condition is
 
0u
0x
 2
 x0
 h(u (0, t) 2 um).
The change in algebraic sign is consistent with the assumption that the rod is at a higher tem-
perature than the medium surrounding the ends so that u(0, t)  um and u(L, t)  um. At x  0 
and x  L, the slopes ux(0, t) and ux(L, t) must be positive and negative, respectively.

Of course, at the ends of the rod we can specify different conditions at the same time. For 
example, we could have
 
0u

We note that the boundary condition in (i) is homogeneous if u0  0; if u0  0, the boundary 
condition is nonhomogeneous. The boundary condition (ii) is homogeneous; (iii) is homoge-
neous if um  0 and nonhomogeneous if um  0.

are called boundary-value problems. The problem in (11) is classified as a homogeneous BVP 
since the partial differential equation and the boundary conditions are homogeneous.
 Variations The partial differential equations (1), (2), and (3) must be modified to take 
into consideration internal or external influences acting on the physical system. More general 
forms of the one-dimensional heat and wave equations are, respectively, 
 
k 02u

In Problems 1–  6, a rod of length L coincides with the interval 
[0, L] on the x-axis. Set up the boundary-value problem for the 
temperature u(x, t).
 1. The left end is held at temperature zero, and the right end is 
insulated. The initial temperature is f (x) throughout.
 2. The left end is held at temperature u0, and the right end is held 
at temperature u1. The initial temperature is zero throughout.
 3. The left end is held at temperature 100, and there is heat trans-
fer from the right end into the surrounding medium at tem-
perature zero. The initial temperature is f(x) throughout.
 4. There is heat transfer from the left end into a surrounding 
medium at temperature 20, and the right end is insulated. The 
initial temperature is f (x) throughout.
 5. The left end is at temperature sin(pt/L), the right end is held 
at zero, and there is heat transfer from the lateral surface of 
the rod into the surrounding medium held at temperature zero. 
The initial temperature is f (x) throughout.
 6. The ends are insulated, and there is heat transfer from the 
lateral surface of the rod into the surrounding medium held 
at temperature 50. The initial temperature is 100 throughout.
In Problems 7–10, a string of length L coincides with the 
interval [0, L] on the x-axis. Set up the boundary-value problem 
for the displacement u(x, t).
 7. The ends are secured to the x-axis. The string is released from 
rest from the initial displacement x(L  x).
 8. The ends are secured to the x-axis. Initially the string is 
 undisplaced but has the initial velocity sin(px/L).
 9. The left end is secured to the x-axis, but the right end moves in 
a transverse manner according to sin pt. The string is released 
from rest from the initial displacement f (x). For t  0 the 
transverse vibrations are damped with a force proportional to 
the instantaneous velocity.
 10. The ends are secured to the x-axis, and the string is initially at 
rest on that axis. An external vertical force proportional to the 
horizontal distance from the left end acts on the string for t  0.
In Problems 11 and 12, set up the boundary-value problem for 
the steady-state temperature u(x, y).
 11. A thin rectangular plate coincides with the region in the xy-plane 
defined by 0  x  4, 0  y  2. The left end and the bottom of 
the plate are insulated. The top of the plate is held at temperature 
zero, and the right end of the plate is held at temperature f ( y).
 12. A semi-infinite plate coincides with the region defined by 
0  x  p, y  0. The left end is held at temperature ey, and 
the right end is held at temperature 100 for 0  y  1 and 
temperature zero for y  1. The bottom of the plate is held at 
temperature f (x).

13.3 Heat Equation
INTRODUCTION Consider a thin rod of length L with an initial temperature f (x) throughout 
and whose ends are held at temperature zero for all time t  0. If the rod shown in FIGURE 13.3.1 
satisfies the assumptions given on page 712, then the temperature u(x, t) in the rod is determined 
from the boundary-value problem

u(0, t)  0, u(L, t)  0, t . 0 
(2)
 
u(x, 0)  f (x), 0 , x , L. 
(3)
In the discussion that follows next we show how to solve this BVP using the method of separation 
of variables introduced in Section 13.1.

REMARKS
The analysis of a wide variety of diverse phenomena yields the mathematical models (1), (2), or 
(3) or their generalizations involving a greater number of spatial variables. For example, (1) is 
sometimes called the diffusion equation since the diffusion of dissolved substances in solution is 
analogous to the flow of heat in a solid. The function c(x, t) satisfying the partial differential equa-
tion in this case represents the concentration of the dissolved substance. Similarly, equation (2) and 
its generalization (15) arise in the analysis of the flow of electricity in a long cable or transmission 
line. In this setting (2) is known as the telegraph equation. It can be shown that under certain as-
sumptions the current i(x, t) and the voltage v(x, t) in the line satisfy two partial differential equations 
identical to (2) (or (15)). The wave equation (2) also appears in fluid mechanics, acoustics, and 
elasticity. Laplace’s equation (3) is encountered in determining the static displacement of membranes.

 
13.3 Heat Equation 
| 717
 Solution of the BVP Using the product u(x, t)  X(x)T(t), and l as the separation 
constant, leads to
 
X0
X  T9
kT  l 
(4)
and 
X   lX  0 
(5)
 
T  klT  0. 
(6)
Now the boundary conditions in (2) become u(0, t)  X(0)T(t)  0 and u(L, t)  X(L)T(t)  0. 
Since the last equalities must hold for all time t, we must have X(0)  0 and X(L)  0. These 
homogeneous boundary conditions together with the homogeneous ODE (5) constitute a regular 
Sturm–Liouville problem:
 
X   lX  0, X(0)  0, X(L)  0. 
(7)
The solution of this BVP was discussed in detail in Example 2 of Section 3.9 and on page 692 
of Section 12.5. In that example, we considered three possible cases for the parameter l: zero, 
negative, and positive. The corresponding general solutions of the DEs are
 
X(x)  c1  c2x,  
l  0 
(8)
 
X(x)  c1 cosh ax  c2 sinh ax,  l  a2 , 0 
(9)
 
X(x)  c1 cos ax  c2 sin ax,  
l  a2 . 0. 
(10)
Recall, when the boundary conditions X(0)  0 and X(L)  0 are applied to (8) and (9) these 
solutions yield only X(x)  0 and so we are left with the unusable result u  0. Applying the first 
boundary condition X(0)  0 to the solution in (10) gives c1  0. Therefore X(x)  c2 sin ax. 
The second boundary condition X(L)  0 now implies
 
X(L)  c2 sin a L  0. 
(11)
If c2  0, then X  0 so that u  0. But (11) can be satisfied for c2  0 when sin aL  0. This 
last equation implies that aL  np or a  np/L, where n  1, 2, 3, … . Hence (7) possesses 
nontrivial solutions when ln  a2
n  n2p2/L2, n  1, 2, 3, … . The values ln and the correspond-
ing solutions
 
X(x)  c2 sin np
L  x,  n  1, 2, 3, p 
(12)
are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, respectively, of the problem in (7).
The general solution of (6) is T(t)  c3ek (n2p2>L2
 ) t, and so
 
un  X(x)T(t)  An ek (n2p2>L2) t sin np
L  x,  
(13)
where we have replaced the constant c2c3 by An. The products un(x, t) given in (13) satisfy the 
partial differential equation (1) as well as the boundary conditions (2) for each value of the posi-
tive integer n. However, in order for the functions in (13) to satisfy the initial condition (3), we 
would have to choose the coefficient An in such a manner that
 
un(x, 0)  f (x)  An sin np
L  x. 
(14)
In general, we would not expect condition (14) to be satisfied for an arbitrary, but reasonable, 
choice of f. Therefore we are forced to admit that un(x, t) is not a solution of the problem given 
in (1)(3). Now by the superposition principle the function
 
u(x, t)  a

must also, although formally, satisfy equation (1) and the conditions in (2). If we substitute t  0 
into (15), then
 
u(x, 0)  f (x)  a
q
n1
An sin np
L  x.
This last expression is recognized as the half-range expansion of f in a sine series. If we make 
the identification An  bn, n  1, 2, 3, … , it follows from (5) of Section 12.3 that
 
An  2

by the infinite series

verify that the coefficients (16) are given by

 Use of Computers The solution u in (18) is a function of two variables and as such its 
graph is a surface in 3-space. We could use the 3D-plot application of a computer algebra system 
to approximate this surface by graphing partial sums Sn(x, t) over a rectangular  region defined 
by 0  x  p, 0  t  T. Alternatively, with the aid of the 2D-plot application of a CAS we plot 
the solution u(x, t) on the x-interval [0, p] for increasing values of time t. See FIGURE 13.3.2(a). 
In Figure 13.3.2(b) the solution u(x, t) is graphed on the t-interval [0, 6] for increasing values 
of x (x  0 is the left end and x  p/2 is the midpoint of the rod of length L  p). Both sets of 
graphs verify that which is apparent in (18)—namely, u(x, t) S 0 as t S q.

INTRODUCTION We are now in a position to solve the boundary-value problem (11) dis-
cussed in Section 13.2. The vertical displacement u(x, t) of a string of length L that is freely

As in Section 13.3, the boundary conditions (2) translate into X(0)  0 and X(L)  0. The ODE 
in (4) along with these boundary-conditions is the regular Sturm–Liouville problem
 
X0  lX  0, X(0)  0, X(L)  0. 
(6)
Of the usual three possibilities for the parameter l: l  0, l  a2  0, and l  a2  0, only 
the last choice leads to nontrivial solutions. Corresponding to l  a2, a  0, the general solution 
of (4) is
 
X(x)  c1 cos ax  c2 sin ax.

| CHAPTER 13 Boundary-Value Problems in Rectangular Coordinates
X(0)  0 and X(L)  0 indicate that c1  0 and c2 sin aL  0. The last equation again implies 
that aL  np or a  np/L. The eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of (6) are 
ln  n2p2/L2 and X(x)  c2 sin np

The solution of the boundary-value problem (1)(3) consists of the series (8) with coefficients

We note that when the string is released from rest, then g(x)  0 for every x in the  interval [0, L] 
and consequently Bn  0.
 Plucked String A special case of the boundary-value problem in (1)(3) when g(x)  0 
is a model of a plucked string. We can see the motion of the string by plotting the solution or 
displacement u(x, t) for increasing values of time t and using the animation feature of a CAS. 
Some frames of a movie generated in this manner are given in FIGURE 13.4.1. You are asked to 
emulate the results given in the figure by plotting a sequence of partial sums of (8). See Problems

 Standing Waves Recall from the derivation of the wave equation in Section 13.2 that 
the constant a appearing in the solution of the boundary-value problem in (1) –  (3) is given by 
"T>r, where r is mass per unit length and T is the magnitude of the tension in the string. When 
T is large enough, the vibrating string produces a musical sound. This sound is the result of 
standing waves. The solution (8) is a superposition of product solutions called standing waves 
or normal modes:
 
u(x, t)  u1(x, t)  u2(x, t)  u3(x, t)  p .
In view of (6) and (7) of Section 3.8, the product solutions (7) can be written as
 
un(x, t)  Cn sin anpa
L  t  fnb sin np
L  x, 
(11)
where Cn  "A2
n  B2
n and fn is defined by sin fn  An/Cn and cos fn  Bn /Cn. For n  1, 2, 3, … 
the standing waves are essentially the graphs of sin(npx/L), with a time-varying amplitude given by
 
Cn sin anpa
L  t  fnb.
Alternatively, we see from (11) that at a fixed value of x each product function un(x, t) represents 
simple harmonic motion with amplitude Cnu sin(npx/L) u and frequency fn  na/2L. In other 
words, each point on a standing wave vibrates with a different amplitude but with the same 
frequency. When n  1, 
 
u1(x, t)  C1 sin apa
L  t  f1b sin p
L x
is called the first standing wave, the first normal mode, or the fundamental mode of vibra-
tion. The first three standing waves, or normal modes, are shown in FIGURE 13.4.2. The dashed 
graphs represent the standing waves at various values of time. The points in the interval (0, L), 
for which sin(np/L)x  0, correspond to points on a standing wave where there is no motion. 
These points are called nodes. For example, in Figures 13.4.2(b) and (c) we see that the second 
standing wave has one node at L/2 and the third standing wave has two nodes at L/3 and 2L/3. 
In general, the nth normal mode of vibration has n  1 nodes.

The frequency

of the first normal mode is called the fundamental frequency or first harmonic and is directly 
related to the pitch produced by a stringed instrument. It is apparent that the greater the tension 
on the string, the higher the pitch of the sound. The frequencies fn of the other normal modes, 
which are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, are called overtones. The second 
harmonic is the first overtone, and so on.
 Superposition Principle The superposition principle, Theorem 13.1.1, is the key in 
making the method of separation of variables an effective means of solving certain kinds of 
boundary-value problems involving linear partial differential equations. Sometimes a problem 
can also be solved by using a superposition of solutions of two easier problems. If we can solve 
each of the problems,

then a solution of (1)–(3) is given by u(x, t)  u1(x, t)  u2(x, t). To see this we know that 
u(x, t)  u1(x, t)  u2(x, t) is a solution of the homogeneous equation in (1) because of 
Theorem 13.1.1. Moreover, u(x, t) satisfies the boundary condition (2) and the initial condi-
tions (3) because, in turn,
 
BCeu(0, t)  u1(0, t)  u2(0, t)  0  0  0

13.5 Laplace’s Equation
INTRODUCTION Suppose we wish to find the steady-state temperature u(x, y) in a rectangular 
plate whose vertical edges x  0 and x  a are insulated, and whose upper and lower edges y  b 
and y  0 are maintained at temperatures f (x) and 0, respectively. See FIGURE 13.5.1. When no 
heat escapes from the lateral faces of the plate, we solve the following boundary-value problem:

 Solution of the BVP With u(x, y)  X(x)Y(  y), separation of variables in (1) leads to
 
X0
X  Y0
Y  l
 
X0  lX  0 
(4)
 
Y0 2 lY  0. 
(5)
The three homogeneous boundary conditions in (2) and (3) translate into X (0)  0, X (a)  0, 
and Y(0)  0. The Sturm–Liouville problem associated with the equation in (4) is then
 
X0  lX  0, X9(0)  0, X9(a)  0. 
(6)
Examination of the cases corresponding to l  0, l  a2  0, and l  a2  0, where a  0, 
has already been carried out in Example 1 in Section 12.5. For convenience a shortened version 
of that analysis follows.
For l  0, (6) becomes
 
X0  0, X9(0)  0, X9(a)  0.
The solution of the ODE is X  c1  c2x. The boundary condition X(0)  0 then implies c2  0, 
and so X  c1. Note that for any c1, this constant solution satisfies the second boundary condition 
X (a)  0. By imposing c1  0, X  c1 is a nontrivial solution of the BVP (6). For l  a2  0, 
(6) possesses no nontrivial solution. For l  a2  0, (6) becomes
 
X0  a2X  0, X9(0)  0, X9(a)  0.
Applying the boundary condition X (0)  0 the solution X  c1 cos ax  c2 sin ax implies c2  0 
and so X  c1cos ax. The second boundary condition X(a)  0 applied to this last expression 
then gives c1a sin aa  0. Because a  0, the last equation is satisfied when aa  np or 
a  np/a, n  1, 2, … . The eigenvalues of (6) are then l0 and ln  a2
n  n2p2/a2, n  1, 2, ….

By corresponding l0  0 with n  0, the eigenfunctions of (6) are
 
X 5 c1,  n 5 0,  and  X 5 c1 cos np
a  x,
n 5 1, 2, p  .
We must now solve equation (5) subject to the single homogeneous boundary condition 
Y(0)  0. First, for l0  0 the DE in (5) is simply Y    0, and thus its solution is Y  c3  c4y. But 
Y(0)  0 implies c3  0 so Y  c4y. Second, for ln  n2p2/a2, the DE in (5) is Y    n2p2
a2 Y  0. 
Because 0  y  b is a finite interval, we write the general  solution in terms of hyperbolic 
functions:
 
Y( y)  c3 cosh(npy/a)  c4 sinh(npy/a).
From this solution we see Y(0)  0 again implies c3  0 so Y  c4 sinh(npy/a).
Thus product solutions un  X(x)Y( y) that satisfy the Laplace’s equation (1) and the three 
homogeneous boundary conditions in (2) and (3) are
 
A0 y,  n 5 0,  and  An  sinh np

where we have rewritten c1c4 as A0 for n  0 and as An for n  1, 2, ….

 Dirichlet Problem A boundary-value problem in which we seek a solution to an elliptic 
partial differential equation such as Laplace’s equation 	2u  0 within a region R (in the plane 
or 3-space) such that u takes on prescribed values on the entire boundary of the region is called 
a Dirichlet problem. In Problem 1 in Exercises 13.5 you are asked to show that the solution of 
the Dirichlet problem for a rectangular region

the region R: 0  x  1, 0  y  1 is given in FIGURE 13.5.2(a). You can see in the figure that 
boundary conditions are satisfied; especially note that along y  1, u  100 for 0  x  1. 
The isotherms, or curves, in the rectangular region along which the temperature u(x, y) is 
constant can be obtained using the contour plotting capabilities of a CAS and are illustrated 
in Figure 13.5.2(b). The isotherms can also be visualized as the curves of intersection (pro-
jected into the xy-plane) of horizontal planes u  80, u  60, and so on, with the surface in 
Figure 13.5.2(a). Notice that throughout the region the maximum temperature is u  100 and 
occurs on the portion of the boundary corresponding to y  1. This is no coincidence. There 
is a maximum principle that states a solution u of Laplace’s equation within a bounded 
region R with boundary B (such as a rectangle, circle, sphere, and so on) takes on its maximum 
and minimum values on B. In addition, it can be proved that u can have no relative extrema 
(maxima or minima) in the interior of R. This last statement is clearly borne out by the surface 
shown in Figure 13.5.2(a).
 Superposition Principle A Dirichlet problem for a rectangle can be readily solved by 
separation of variables when homogeneous boundary conditions are specified on two  parallel 
boundaries. However, the method of separation of variables is not applicable to a Dirichlet 
problem when the boundary conditions on all four sides of the rectangle are nonhomogeneous. 
To get around this difficulty we break the boundary-value problem

Suppose u1 and u2 are the solutions of Problems 1 and 2, respectively. If we define 
u(x, y)  u1(x, y)  u2(x, y), it is seen that u satisfies all boundary conditions in the original 
problem (11). For example, 
 
u(0, y)  u1(0, y)  u2(0, y)  0  F(  y)  F(  y)
 
u(x, b)  u1(x, b)  u2(x, b)  g(x)  0  g(x)

words, by solving Problems 1 and 2 and adding their solutions we have solved the original

13.6 Nonhomogeneous Boundary-Value Problems
INTRODUCTION A boundary-value problem is said to be nonhomogeneous if either the 
partial differential equation or the boundary conditions are nonhomogeneous. The method of 
separation of variables employed in the preceding three sections may not be applicable to a 
nonhomogeneous boundary-value problem directly. In the first of the two techniques examined 
in this section we employ a change of dependent variable u  v   that transforms a nonho-
mogeneous boundary-value problem into two BVPs: one involving an ODE and the other involv-
ing a PDE. The latter problem is homogeneous and solvable by separation of variables. The 
second technique may also start with a change of a dependent variable, but is basically a frontal 
attack on the BVP using orthogonal series expansions.
The two solution methods that follow are distinguished by different types of nonhomogeneous 
boundary-value problems.
 Time Independent PDE and BCs We first consider a BVP involving a time- independent 
nonhomogeneous equation and time-independent boundary conditions. An example of such a 
problem is
 
k 02u
0x2  F(x)  0u
0t ,  0 , x , L,  t . 0
 
u(0, t)  u0, u(L, t)  u1,  t . 0 
(1)
 
u(x, 0)  f(x),  0 , x , L, 
where k  0 is a constant. We can interpret (1) as a model for the temperature distribution 
u(x, t) within a rod of length L where heat is being generated internally throughout the rod by 
either electrical or chemical means at a rate F(x) and the boundaries x  0 and x  L are held at 
constant temperatures u0 and u1, respectively. When heat is generated at a constant rate r within 
the rod, the heat equation in (1) takes on the form
 
k 02u
0x2  r  0u
0t . 
(2)
Now equation (2) is readily shown not to be separable. On the other hand, suppose we wish to 
solve the usual homogeneous heat equation kuxx  ut when the boundaries x  0 and x  L are 
held at, say, nonzero temperatures. Even though the substitution u(x, t)  X(x)T(t) separates the 
PDE, we quickly find ourselves at an impasse in determining eigenvalues and eigenfunctions be-
cause no conclusion about the values of X(0) and X(L) can be drawn from u(x, 0)  X(0)T(t)  u0 
and u(x, L)  X(L)T(t)  u1.
By changing the dependent variable u to a new dependent variable v by the substitution 
u(x, t)  v(x, t)  (x), (1) can be reduced to two problems:
 
Problem A: 5kc0  F(x)  0, c(0)  u0, c(L)  u1
 
Problem B: μ
k 02v
0x
 2  0v
0t, 
v(0, t)  0,   v(L, t)  0
v(x, 0)  f (x) 2 c(x)
Observe in Problem A that the simple ODE k  F(x)  0 can be solved by integration. Moreover, 
Problem B is a homogeneous BVP that can be solved straight away by the method of separation 
of variables. A solution of the given nonhomogeneous problem is then a superposition of solutions:
Solution u  Solution c of Problem A  Solution v of Problem B.
There is nothing in the above discussion that should be memorized; you should work through 
the substitution u(x, t)  v(x, t)  (x) each time as outlined in the next example.

EXAMPLE 1 
Time-Independent PDE and BCs
Solve 
k 02u
0x2  r  0u
0t ,  0 , x , 1,  t . 0
u(0, t)  0, u(1, t)  u1,  t . 0 
(3)
 
u(x, 0)  f(x),  0 , x , 1,
where r and u1 are nonzero constants.
SOLUTION Both the partial differential equation and the boundary condition at x  1 are 
nonhomogeneous. If we let u(x, t)  v(x, t)  c(x), then
02u
0x2  02v
0x2  c0(x)  and  0u
0t  0v
0t.
After substituting these results, the PDE in (3) then becomes
 
k 02v
0x2  kc0(x)  r  0v
0t. 
(4)
Equation (4) reduces to a homogeneous equation if we demand that  satisfy
kc0(x)  r  0  or  c0(x)  r
k.
Integrating the last equation twice reveals that
 
c(x)   r
2kx2  c1x  c2. 
(5)
Furthermore, 
u(0, t)  v(0, t)  c(0)  0
 
u(1, t)  v(1, t)  c(1)  u1.
We have v(0, t)  0 and v(1, t)  0 provided that c also satisfies
 
c (0)  0  and  c (1)  u1.
By applying the latter two conditions to (5) we obtain, in turn, c2  0 and c1  r/2k  u1. 
Consequently
c(x)   r
2kx2  a r
2k  u1bx.
Finally, the initial condition in (3) implies v(x, 0)  u(x, 0)  (x)  f(x)  (x).
Thus to determine v(x, t) we solve the new boundary-value problem
 
k 02v

v(0, t)  0, v(1, t)  0, t  0
 
v(x, 0)  f (x)  r
2k x
 2 2 a r
2k  u1bx,  0 , x , 1
by separation of variables. In the usual manner we find
 
v(x, t)  a

A solution of the original problem is u(x, t)  v(x, t)  (x), or

2k  u1bx  a
q

An ekn2p2tsin npx,

where the coefficients An are defined in (7).
Inspection of (6) shows that v(x, t) S 0 as t S , and so v(x, t) is called a transient solution. 
But observe in (8) that u(x, t) S (x) as t S . In the context of solving forms of the heat equa-
tion, (x) is called a steady-state solution.
 Time-Dependent PDE and BCs We turn now to a method for solving some kinds of 
BVPs that involve a time-dependent nonhomogeneous equation and time-dependent boundary 
conditions. A problem similar to (1),
 
k 02u
0x2  F(x, t)  0u
0t ,  0 , x , L,  t . 0
 
u(0, t)  u0(t), u(L, t)  u1(t),  t . 0 
(9)
 
u(x, 0)  f(x),  0 , x , L,
describes the temperatures of a rod of length L but in this case the heat-source term F and the tem-
peratures at the two ends of the rod can vary with time t. Intuitively one might expect that the line 
of attack for this problem would be a natural extension of the procedure that worked in Example 1, 
namely, seek a solution of the form u(x, t)  v(x, t)  c(x, t). While this form of the solution is 
correct in some instances, it is usually not possible to find a function of two variables (x, t) that 
reduces a problem for v(x, t) to a homogeneous one. To understand why this is so, let’s see what 
happens when u(x, t)  v(x, t)  c(x, t) is substituted into the PDE in (9). Because
 
02u
0x2  02v
0x2  02c
0x2  and  0u
0t  0v
0t  0c
0t , 
(10)
the BVP (9) becomes
 
k02v
0x2  k02c
0x2  F(x, t)  0v
0t  0c
0t
 
v(0, t)  c(0, t)  u0(t), v(L, t)  c(L, t)  u1(t) 
(11)
 
v(x, 0)  f(x) 2 c(x, 0).
The boundary conditions on v in (11) will be homogeneous if we demand that
 
c(0, t)  u0(t), c(L, t)  u1(t). 
(12)
Were we, at this point, to follow the same steps in the method used in Example 1, we would try 
to force the problem in (11) to be homogeneous by requiring kcxx  F(x, t)  ct and then im-
posing the conditions in (12) on the solution . But in view of the fact that the defining equation 
for  is itself a nonhomogeneous PDE, this is an unrealistic expectation. So we try an entirely 
different tack by simply constructing a function  that satisfies both conditions given in (12). 
One such function is given by
 
c(x, t)  u0(t)  x
L
 fu1(t) 2 u0(t)g. 
(13)
Reinspection of (11) shows that we have gained some additional simplification with this choice 
of  because cxx  0. We now start over. This time if we substitute
 
u(x, t)  v(x, t)  u0(t)  x
L
 fu1(t) 2 u0(t)g 
(14)

13.6 Nonhomogeneous Boundary-Value Problems

733
the boundary-value problem (11) then becomes
k 02v
0x2  G(x, t)  0v
0t,  0 , x , L,  t . 0
v(0, t)  0, v(L, t)  0,  t . 0 
(15)
v(x, 0)  f (x) 2 c(x, 0),  0 , x , L,
where G(x, t)  F(x, t) 2 ct. While the problem (15) is still nonhomogeneous (the boundary 
conditions are homogeneous but the partial differential equation is nonhomogeneous) it is a 
problem that we can solve.
 The Basic Strategy The solution method for (15) is a bit involved, so before illustrating 
with a specific example, we first outline the basic strategy:
Make the assumption that time-dependent coefficients vn(t) and Gn(t) can be found such 
that both v(x, t) and G(x, t) in (15) can be expanded in the series
 
v(x, t)  a
q
n1
vn(t) sin np
L x and G(x, t)  a
q
n1
Gn(t) sin np
L x, 
(16)
where sin(npx>L), n  1, 2, 3, p, are the eigenfunctions of X0  lX  0, X(0)  0,
X(L)  0 corresponding to the eigenvalues ln  a2
n  n2p2>L2. This Sturm-Liouville 
 problem would have been obtained had separation of variables been applied to the associated 
homogeneous BVP of (15). In (16), observe that the assumed series v(x, t)  a
q
n1
vn(t)sinnp
L x
already satisfies the boundary conditions in (15). Now substitute this series for v(x, t) into the 
nonhomogeneous PDE in (15), collect terms, and equate the resulting series with the actual 
series expansion found for G(x, t).
In the next example we illustrate this method by solving a special case of (9).

SOLUTION We match this problem with (9) by identifying k  1, L  1, F(x, t)  0, 
u0(t)  cos t, u1 (t)  0, and f(x)  0. We begin with the construction of . From (13) 
we get
 
c(x, t)  cos t  xf0 2 cos tg  (1 2 x)cos t,
and then, as indicated in (14), we use

v(x, 0)  x 2 1,  0 , x , 1.
The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Sturm-Liouville problem
 
X0  lX  0, X(0)  0, X(1)  0
are found to be ln  a2
n  n2p2 and sin nx, n  1, 2, 3, . . . . With G(x, t)  (1  x)sin t we 
assume from (18) that for fixed t, v and G can be written as Fourier sine series:
 
v(x, t)  a

vn(t) sin npx 
(19)
and 
(1 2 x)sin t  a

n1
Gn(t) sin npx. 
(20)
By treating t as a parameter, the coefficients Gn in (20) can be computed:
Gn(t)  2

(1 2 x)sin t sin npx dx  2sin t#

Hence, 
(1 2 x)sin t  a
q
n1
2
np
 sin t sin npx. 
(21)
We can determine the coefficients vn(t) by substituting (20) and (21) back into the PDE in 
(18). To that end, the partial derivatives of v are
 
02v
0x2  a
q
n1
vn(t)(n2p2)sin npx and 0v
0t  a
q
n1
v9n(t)sin npx. 
(22)
Writing the PDE in (18) as vt 2 vxx  (1 2 x)sin t and using (21) and (22) we get
a
q
n1
fv9n(t)  n2p2vn(t)gsin npx  a

We then equate the coefficients of sin nx on each side of the equality to get the linear first-
order ODE
v9n(t)  n2p2vn(t)  2sin t
np .
Proceeding as in Section 2.3, we multiply the last equation by the integrating factor en2p2t and 
rewrite it as
 
d

 fen2p2tvn(t)g  2
np
 en2p2tsin t.
Integrating both sides, we find that the general solution of this equation is
 
vn(t)  2n2p2sin t 2 cos t
np(n4p4  1)
 Cnen2p2t,
where Cn denotes the arbitrary constant. Therefore the assumed form of v(x, t) in (19) can be written
 
v(x, t)  a

np(n4p4  1)

The coefficients Cn can be found by applying the initial condition v(x, 0) to (23).
From the Fourier sine series,

we see that the quantity in the brackets represents the Fourier sine coefficients bn for x  1.

Therefore, 
Cn 

By substituting the last result into (23) we obtain a solution of (18):

c n2p2sin t 2 cos t  en2p2t
n(n4p4  1)

At long last, then, it follows from (17) that the desired solution u(x, t) is

If the boundary-value problem has homogeneous boundary conditions and a time-dependent 
term F(x, t) in the PDE, then there is no actual need to change the dependent variable through 
the substitution u(x, t)  v(x, t)  c(x, t). For example, if both u0 and u1 are 0 in a problem such 
as (9), then it follows from (13) that c(x, t)  0. The method of solution then begins by assuming 
an appropriate orthogonal series expansions for u(x, t) and F(x, t) as in (16), where the symbols 
v and G in (16) are naturally replaced by u and F, respectively.

(25)
 
u(x, 0)  0,  0 , x , 1.
SOLUTION Except for the initial condition, the BVP (25) is basically (18). As pointed out 
in the paragraph preceding this example, because the boundary conditions are both homoge-
neous we have c(x, t)  0. Thus all steps in Example 2 used in the solution of (18) are the

In Problems 13–16 in Exercises 13.6 you are asked to construct c(x, t) as illustrated in 
Example 2. In Problems 17–20 of Exercises 13.6 the given boundary conditions are homogenous 
and so you can start as we did in Example 3 with the assumption that c(x, t)  0.
REMARKS
Don’t put any special emphasis on the fact that we used the heat equation throughout the 
foregoing discussion. The method outlined in Example 1 can be applied to the wave equation 
and Laplace’s equation as well. See Problems 1–12 in Exercises 13.6. The method outlined 
in Example 2 is predicated on time dependence in the problem and so is not applicable to 
BVPs involving Laplace’s equation.

13.7 Orthogonal Series Expansions
INTRODUCTION For certain types of boundary conditions, the method of separation of vari-
ables and the superposition principle lead to an expansion of a function in an infinite series that 
is not a Fourier series. To solve the problems in this section we shall utilize the concept of or-
thogonal series expansions or generalized Fourier series developed in Section 12.1.

CHAPTER 13 Boundary-Value Problems in Rectangular Coordinates
EXAMPLE 1 
Using Orthogonal Series Expansions
The temperature in a rod of unit length in which there is heat transfer from its right boundary 
into a surrounding medium kept at a constant temperature zero is determined from
k 02u
0x
 2 5 0u
0t , 0 , x , 1,  t . 0
 
u(0, t)  0,  0u

 x1
 hu(1, t), h . 0,  t . 0
 
u(x, 0)  1, 0  x  1.
Solve for u(x, t).
SOLUTION Proceeding exactly as we did in Section 13.3, with u(x, t)  X(x)T(t) and l as 
the separation constant, we find the separated ODEs and boundary conditions to be,  respectively, 
 
X   lX  0 
(1)
 
T   klT  0 
(2)
 
X(0)  0  and  X(1)  hX(1). 
(3)
Equation (1) along with the homogeneous boundary conditions (3) comprise the regular 
Sturm–Liouville problem:
 
X0  lX  0, X(0)  0, X9(1)  hX(1)  0. 
(4)
Except for the presence of the symbol h, the BVP in (4) is essentially the problem solved in 
Example 2 of Section 12.5. As in that example, (4) possesses nontrivial solutions only in the 
case l  a2  0, a  0. The general solution of the DE in (4) is X(x)  c1 cos ax  c2 sin ax. 
The first boundary condition in (4) immediately gives c1  0. Applying the second boundary 
condition in (4) to X(x)  c2 sin ax yields
 
a cos a 1 h sin a 5 0   or    tan a 5 2a
h. 
(5)
Because the graphs of y  tan x and y  x/h, h  0, have an infinite number of points of 
intersection for x  0 (Figure 12.5.1 illustrates the case h  1), the last equation in (5) has an 
infinite number of roots. Of course, these roots depend on the value of h. If the consecutive 
positive roots are denoted an, n  1, 2, 3, … , then the eigenvalues of the problem are ln  a2
n, 
and the corresponding eigenfunctions are X(x)  c2 sin an x, n  1, 2, 3, … . The solution of 
the first-order DE (2) is T(t)  c3e2ka2

Now at t  0, u(x, 0)  1, 0  x  1, so that

(6)
The series in (6) is not a Fourier sine series; rather, it is an expansion of u(x, 0)  1 in terms 
of the orthogonal functions arising from the Sturm–Liouville problem (4). It follows that the 
set of eigenfunctions {sinan x}, n  1, 2, 3, … , where the a’s are defined by tan a  a/h is 
orthogonal with respect to the weight function p(x)  1 on the interval [0, 1]. With f (x)  1 and 
fn(x)  sin an x, it follows from (8) of Section 12.1, that the coefficients An in (6) are
 
An  e
1
0  sin an x dx
e
1
0  sin2 an x dx
. 
(7)
To evaluate the square norm of each of the eigenfunctions we use a trigonometric  identity:

 sin 2 an x dx  1

With the aid of the double angle formula sin 2an  2 sin an cos an and the first equation in (5) 
in the form an cos an  h sin an, we can simplify (8) to

SOLUTION Proceeding as in Section 13.4 with u(x, t)  X(x)T(t) and using l once again

Equation (9) together with the homogeneous boundary conditions in (11), 
X0  lX  0, X(0)  0, X9(1)  0,  
(12)
is a regular Sturm–Liouville problem. You are encouraged to verify that for l  0 and for 
l  a2, a  0, the only solution of (12) is X  0. For l  a2  0, a  0, the boundary 
conditions X(0)  0 and X(1)  0 applied to the general solution X(x)  c1 cos ax  c2 sin ax 
give, in turn, c1  0 and c2 cos a  0. Since cos a is zero only when a is an odd integer multiple 
of p/2 we write an  (2n  1)p/2. The eigenvalues of (12) are ln  a2

the corresponding eigenfunctions are X(x)  c2 sin an x  c2 sina2n 2 1

Since the rod is released from rest, the initial condition ut(x, 0)  0 translates into

with respect to the weight function p(x)  1 on the interval [0, 1]. Even though the trigono-
metric series in (14) looks more like a Fourier series than (6), it is not a Fourier sine series 
because the argument of the sine function is not an integer multiple of px/L (here L  1). The 
series is again an orthogonal series expansion or generalized Fourier series. Hence from (8)

13.8 Fourier Series in Two Variables
INTRODUCTION In the preceding sections we solved one-dimensional forms of the heat 
and wave equations. In this section we extend the method of separation of variables to certain 
problems involving the two-dimensional heat and wave equations.
 Heat and Wave Equations in Two Dimensions Suppose the rectangular region 
in FIGURE 13.8.1(a) is a thin plate in which the temperature u is a function of time t and position 
(x, y). Then, under suitable conditions, u(x, y, t) can be shown to satisfy the two-dimensional 
heat equation

On the other hand, suppose Figure 13.8.1(b) represents a rectangular frame over which a thin 
flexible membrane has been stretched (a rectangular drum). If the membrane is set in motion, 
then its displacement u, measured from the xy-plane (transverse vibrations), is also a function of

the two-dimensional wave equation

(2)
As the next example will show, solutions of boundary-value problems involving (1) and (2) 
lead to the concept of a Fourier series in two variables. Because the analysis of problems involv-
ing (1) and (2) are quite similar, we illustrate a solution only of the heat equation (1).
EXAMPLE 1 
Temperatures in a Plate
Find the temperature u(x, y, t) in the plate shown in Figure 13.8.1(a) if the initial temperature 
is f (x, y) throughout and if the boundaries are held at temperature zero for time t  0.
SOLUTION We must solve
 
  
k ¢ 02u
0x2  02u
0y2 ≤ 0u
0t , 0 , x , b,  0 , y , c,  t . 0
subject to 
u(0, y, t)  0,  
u(b, y, t)  0,  0  y  c, t  0
 
u(x, 0, t)  0,  
u(x, c, t)  0,  0  x  b, t  0
 
u(x, y, 0)  f (x, y),  0  x  b, 0  y  c.
To separate variables for the PDE in three independent variables x, y, and t we try to find a 
product solution u(x, y, t)  X(x)Y(  y)T(t). Substituting, we get
 
k(X0YT  XY0T )  XYT9  or  X0
X  Y0
Y  T9
kT
 . 
(3)
Since the left side of the last equation in (3) depends only on x and the right side  depends only 
on y and t, we must have both sides equal to a constant l:
X0
X  Y0
Y  T9
kT  l
and so 
X  lX  0 
(4)
Y0
Y  T9
kT  l. 
(5)
By the same reasoning, if we introduce another separation constant µ in (5), then
Y0
Y  µ and T9
kT  l  µ
 
Y   µY  0 and T  k(l  µ)T  0. 
(6)
Now the homogeneous boundary conditions
u(0, y, t)  0, 
u(b, y, t)  0
u(x, 0, t)  0, 
u(x, c, t)  0 r imply bX(0)  0, 
X(b)  0
Y(0)  0, 
Y(c)  0.
Thus we have two Sturm–Liouville problems, one in the variable x, 
X0  lX  0, X(0)  0,  X(b)  0 
(7)
and the other in the variable y, 
Y0  µY  0, Y(0)  0,  Y(c)  0. 
(8)
The usual consideration of cases (l  0, l  a2  0, l  a2  0, µ  0, l  b2  0, 
and so on) leads to two independent sets of eigenvalues defined by sin lb  0 and 
sin µc  0.

These equations in turn imply
 
lm 5 m2p2
b2 ,  and mn 5 n2p2
c2 . 
(9)
The corresponding eigenfunctions are
 
X(x)  c2 sin mp
b  x,  m  1, 2, 3, p and Y(y)  c4 sin np
c  y,  n  1, 2, 3, p . 
(10)
After substituting the values in (9) into the first-order DE in (6), its general solution is 
T(t)  c5ekf(mp>b)2(np>c)2gt. A product solution of the two-dimensional heat equation that 
satisfies the four homogeneous boundary conditions is then
 
umn(x, y, t)  Amn ekf(mp>b)2(np>c)2gt sin mp
b  x sin np
c  y, 
where Amn is an arbitrary constant. Because we have two sets of eigenvalues, we are prompted 
to try the superposition principle in the form of a double sum
 
u(x, y, t)  a
q
m1
 a
q
n1
Amn ekf(mp>b)2(np>c)2gt sin mp
b  x sin np
c  y. 
(11)
At t  0 we want the temperature f (x, y) to be represented by
 
u(x, y, 0)  f (x, y)  a
q
m1
 a
q
n1
Amn sin mp
b  x sin np
c  y. 
(12)
Finding the coefficients Amn in (12) really does not pose a problem; we simply multiply the 
double sum (12) by the product sin (mpx/b) sin (npy/c) and integrate over the rectangle defined 
by 0  x  b, 0  y  c. It follows that
 
Amn  4
bc#
c
0 #
b
0
f (x, y) sin mp
b  x sin np
c  y dx dy. 
(13)
Thus, the solution of the boundary-value problem consists of (11) with the Amn defined 
by (13).
The series (11) with coefficients (13) is called a sine series in two variables, or a double sine 
series. The cosine series in two variables of a function f (x, y) is a little more complicated. 
If the function f is defined over a rectangular region defined by 0  x  b, 0  y  c, then the 
double cosine series is given by
 
f (x, y)  A00  a
q

See Problem 2 in Exercises 13.8 for a boundary-value problem leading to a double cosine series.

In the previous chapter we 
utilized Fourier series to solve 
boundary-value problems that 
were described in the Cartesian or 
rectangular coordinate system. In 
this chapter we will finally put to 
practical use the theory of 
Fourier–Bessel series (Section 
14.2) and Fourier–Legendre series 
(Section 14.3) in the solution of 
boundary-value problems 
described, respectively in 
cylindrical coordinates and in 
spherical coordinates.

CHAPTER 14 Boundary-Value Problems in Other Coordinate Systems
14.1 
Polar Coordinates
INTRODUCTION 
All the boundary-value problems that have been considered so far have 
been expressed in terms of rectangular coordinates. If, however, we wish to find temperatures in 
a circular disk, a circular cylinder, or in a sphere, we would naturally try to describe the problems 
in polar coordinates, cylindrical coordinates, or spherical coordinates, respectively.
Because we consider only steady-state temperature problems in polar coordinates in this sec-
tion, the first thing that must be done is to convert the familiar Laplace’s equation in rectangular 
coordinates to polar coordinates.
 Laplacian in Polar Coordinates The relationships between polar coordinates in the 
plane and rectangular coordinates are given by
x  r cos u,   y  r sin u   and   r 2  x2  y2,   tan u  y
x.
See FIGURE 14.1.1. The first pair of equations transform polar coordinates (r, u) into rectangular 
coordinates (x, y); the second pair of equations enable us to transform rectangular coordinates 
into polar coordinates. These equations also make it possible to convert the two-dimensional 
Laplacian of the function u,  2u  2u/x 2  2u/y 2, into polar coordinates. You are encour-
aged to work through the details of the Chain Rule and show that

Our first example is the Dirichlet problem for a circular disk. We wish to solve Laplace’s 
equation (3) for the steady-state temperature u (r, u) in a circular disk or plate of radius c when 
the temperature of the circumference is u (c, u)  f (u), 0  u  2p. See FIGURE 14.1.2. It is as-
sumed that the two faces of the plate are insulated. This seemingly simple problem is unlike any 
we have encountered in the previous chapter.
EXAMPLE 1 
Steady Temperatures in a Circular Plate
Solve Laplace’s equation (3) subject to u (c, u)  f (u), 0  u  2p.
SOLUTION Before attempting separation of variables we note that the single boundary con-
dition is nonhomogeneous. In other words, there are no explicit conditions in the statement 
of the problem that enable us to determine either the coefficients in the solutions of the sepa-
rated ODEs or the required eigenvalues. However, there are some implicit conditions.
First, our physical intuition leads us to expect that the temperature u(r, u) should be con-
tinuous and therefore bounded inside the circle r  c. In addition, the temperature u(r, u)

should be single-valued; this means that the value of u should be the same at a specified point 
in the plate regardless of the polar description of that point. Since (r, u  2p) is an equivalent 
description of the point (r, u), we must have u(r, u)  u(r, u  2p). That is, u(r, u) must be 
periodic in u with period 2p. If we seek a product solution u  R(r)(u), then (u) needs to 
be 2p-periodic.
With all this in mind, we choose to write the separation constant in the separation of 
variables as l:
 
r
 2R0  rR9
R
 Q0
Q
 l.
The separated equations are then
 
 r
 2R0  rR9 2 lR  0 
(4)
 
  Q0  l Q  0 
(5)
We are seeking a solution of the problem
 
Q0  l Q  0,   Q(u)  Q( u  2p). 
(6)
Although (6) is not a regular Sturm–Liouville problem, nonetheless the problem generates 
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The latter form an orthogonal set on the interval [0, 2p].
Of the three possible general solutions of (5), 
 
Q(u)  c1  c2 u,  
l 5 0 
(7)
 
Q(u)  c1 cosh a u  c2 sinh a u, 
l 5 2a2 , 0 
(8)
 
Q(u)  c1 cos a u  c2 sin a u,  
l 5 a2 . 0 
(9)
we can dismiss (8) as inherently non-periodic unless c1  c2  0. Similarly, solution (7) is 
non-periodic unless we define c2  0. The remaining constant solution (u)  c1, c1 	 0, can be 
assigned any period and so l  0 is an eigenvalue. Finally, solution (9) will be 2p-periodic 
if we take a  n, where n  1, 2, ….* The eigenvalues of (6) are then l0  0 and ln  n2, 
n  1, 2, …. If we correspond l0  0 with n  0, the eigenfunctions of (6) are
 
Q(u)  c1,  n  0,  and  Q(u)  c1 cos n u  c2 sin n u,  n  1, 2, p .
When ln  n2, n  0, 1, 2, … the solutions of the Cauchy–Euler DE (4) are
 
R(r)  c3  c4 ln r,  n  0,  
(10)
 
   R(r)  c3r
 n  c4rn,  n  1, 2, p . 
(11)
Now observe in (11) that rn  1/r n. In either of the solutions (10) or (11), we must define 
c4  0 in order to guarantee that the solution u is bounded at the center of the plate (which is 
r  0). Thus product solutions un  R(r)(u) for Laplace’s equation in polar coordinates are
 
u0  A0,  n  0,  and  un  r
 n(An cos n u  Bn sin n u),  n  1, 2, p ,
where we have replaced c3c1 by A0 for n  0 and by An for n  1, 2, …; the product c3c2 has 
been replaced by Bn. The superposition principle then gives
 
u(r,  u)  A0  a
q
n1
r
 n(An cos n u  Bn sin n u). 
(12)
By applying the boundary condition at r  c to the result in (12) we recognize
 
f ( u)  A0  a
q
n1
cn(An cos n u  Bn sin n u)
* For example, note that cos n(u  2p)  cos(nu  2np)  cos nu.

(15)
The solution of the problem consists of the series given in (12), where the coefficients A0, An, 
and Bn are defined in (13), (14), and (15), respectively. 
Observe in Example 1 that corresponding to each positive eigenvalue, ln  n2, n  1, 2, …, 
there are two different eigenfunctions—namely, cos n u and sin n u. In this situation the eigenvalues 
are sometimes called double eigenvalues.
EXAMPLE 2 
Steady Temperatures in a Semicircular Plate
Find the steady-state temperature u(r, u) in the semicircular plate shown in FIGURE 14.1.3.

u(c, u)  u0, 0  u  p
 
u(r, 0)  0, u(r, p)  0, 0  r  c.
Defining u  R(r)(u) and separating variables gives

Q  l
and 
r 2R

  l  0. 
(17)
The homogeneous conditions stipulated at the boundaries u  0 and u  p translate into 
(0)  0 and (p)  0. These conditions together with equation (17) constitute a regular 
Sturm–Liouville problem:
 
Q0  l Q  0,   Q(0)  0, Q(p)  0. 
(18)
This familiar problem* possesses eigenvalues ln  n2 and eigenfunctions (u)  c2 sin n u, 
n  1, 2, …. Also, by replacing l by n2 the solution of (16) is R(r)  c3r n  c4rn. The rea-
soning used in Example 1, namely, that we expect a solution u of the problem to be bounded 
at r  0, prompts us to define c4  0. Therefore un  R(r)(u)  Anr n sin n u and

14.2 Cylindrical Coordinates
INTRODUCTION 
In this section we are going to consider boundary-value problems involv-
ing forms of the heat and wave equation in polar coordinates and a form of Laplace’s equation 
in cylindrical coordinates. There is a commonality throughout the examples and most of the 
exercises—the boundary-value problem possesses radial symmetry.

where u  u(r, u, t). To solve a boundary-value problem involving either of these equations by 
separation of variables we must define u  R(r)(u)T(t). As in Section 13.8, this assumption 
leads to multiple infinite series. See Problem 18 in Exercises 14.2. In the discussion that follows 
we shall consider the simpler, but still important, problems that possess radial symmetry—that 
is, problems in which the unknown function u is independent of the angular coordinate u. In this 
case the heat and wave equations in (1) take, in turn, the forms

where u  u(r, t). Vibrations described by the second equation in (2) are said to be radial vibrations.
The first example deals with the free undamped radial vibrations of a thin circular membrane. 
We assume that the displacements are small and that the motion is such that each point on the 
membrane moves in a direction perpendicular to the xy-plane (transverse vibrations)—that is, 
the u-axis is perpendicular to the xy-plane. A physical model to keep in mind while studying this 
example is a vibrating drumhead.

Find the displacement u(r, t) of a circular membrane of radius c clamped along its circumfer-
ence if its initial displacement is f (r) and its initial velocity is g(r). See FIGURE 14.2.1.

Substituting u  R(r)T(t) into the partial differential equation and separating variables gives
 
R0  1
r R9
R
 T0
a2T  l. 
(3)
Note in (3) we have returned to our usual separation constant l. The two equations obtained 
from (3) are
 
rR0  R9  lrR  0 
(4)
and 
T0  a2lT  0. 
(5)
Because of the vibrational nature of the problem, equation (5) suggests that we use only 
l  a 2  0, a  0. Now (4) is not a Cauchy–Euler equation but is the parametric Bessel 
differential equation of order n  0; that is, rR
  R  a2rR  0. From (13) of Section 5.3 
the general solution of the last equation is
 
R(r)  c1J0(ar)  c2Y0(ar). 
(6)
The general solution of the familiar equation (5) is
 
T(t)  c3 cos aat  c4 sin aat.
Now recall, the Bessel function of the second kind of order zero has the property that 
Y0(ar) S q as r S 0, and so the implicit assumption that the displacement u(r, t) should 
be bounded at r  0 forces us to define c2  0 in (6). Thus R(r)  c1J0(ar).
Since the boundary condition u(c, t)  0 is equivalent to R(c)  0, we must have c1J0(ac)  0. 
We rule out c1  0 (this would lead to a trivial solution of the PDE), so consequently
 
J0(ac)  0. 
(7)
If xn  anc are the positive roots of (7), then an  xn /c and so the eigenvalues of the problem 
are ln  a2
n  x2
n/c2 and the eigenfunctions are c1J0(anr). Product solutions that satisfy the 
partial differential equation and the boundary condition are
 
un  R(r)T (t)  (An cos aant  Bn sin aant)J0(anr),  
(8)
where we have done the usual relabeling of the constants. The superposition principle then gives
 
u(r, t)  a
q
n1
(An cos aant  Bn sin aant) J0(anr). 
(9)
The given initial conditions determine the coefficients An and Bn.
Setting t  0 in (9) and using u(r, 0)  f (r) gives
 
f (r)  a
q
n1
An J0(anr). 
(10)
This last result is recognized as the Fourier–Bessel expansion of the function f on the interval 
(0, c). Hence by a direct comparison of (7) and (10) with (8) and (15) of Section 12.6 we can 
identify the coefficients An with those given in (16) of Section 12.6:
 
An 
2
c2J
 2
1(anc)#
c
0
rJ0(anr ) f (r) dr. 
(11)
Next, we differentiate (9) with respect to t, set t  0, and use ut (r, 0)  g(r):
 
g(r)  a
q
n1
aan Bn J0(anr).
This is now a Fourier–Bessel expansion of the function g. By identifying the total coefficient 
aanBn with (16) of Section 12.6 we can write
 
Bn 
2
aanc2J
 2
1(anc)#
c
0
rJ0(anr)g(r) dr. 
(12)
Finally, the solution of the given boundary-value problem is the series (9) with coefficients 
An and Bn defined in (11) and (12), respectively. 

 Standing Waves Analogous to (11) of Section 13.4, the product solutions (8) are called 
standing waves. For n  1, 2, 3, …, the standing waves are basically the graph of J0(anr) with 
the time varying amplitude
 
An cos aant  Bn sin aant.
The standing waves at different values of time are represented by the dashed graphs in FIGURE 14.2.2. 
The zeros of each standing wave in the interval (0, c) are the roots of J0(anr)  0 and correspond 
to the set of points on a standing wave where there is no motion. This set of points is called a nodal 
line. If (as in Example 1) the positive roots of J0(anc)  0 are denoted by xn, then xn  anc implies 
an  xn /c and consequently the zeros of the standing waves are determined from
 
J0(anr)  J0 axn
c  rb  0.
Now from Table 5.3.1, the first three positive zeros of J0 are (approximately) x1  2.4, x2  5.5, 
and x3  8.7. Thus for n  1, the first positive root of
 
J0 ax1
c  rb 5 0  is  2.4
c  r 5 2.4
or r 5 c.
Since we are seeking zeros of the standing waves in the open interval (0, c), the last result means 
that the first standing wave has no nodal line. For n  2, the first two positive roots of
 
J0 ax2
c  rb 5 0  are determined from
5.5
c  r 5 2.4 and 5.5
c  r 5 5.5.
Thus the second standing wave has one nodal line defined by r  x1c/x2  2.4c/5.5. Note that 
r  0.44c  c. For n  3, a similar analysis shows that there are two nodal lines defined by 
r  x1c/x3  2.4c/8.7 and r  x2c/x3  5.5c/8.7. In general, the nth standing wave has n  1 nodal 
lines r  x1c/xn, r  x2c/xn, ..., r  xn1c/xn. Since r  constant is an equation of a circle in polar 
coordinates, we see in Figure 14.2.2 that the nodal lines of a standing wave are concentric circles.
 Use of Computers It is possible to see the effect of a single drumbeat for the model 
solved in Example 1 by means of the animation capabilities of a computer algebra system. In 
Problem 20 in Exercises 14.2 you are asked to find the solution given in (9) when
 
c  1,   f (r)  0,   and   g(r)  ev0 , 
0 # r , b

 Laplacian in Cylindrical Coordinates From FIGURE 14.2.4 we can see that the relation-
ship between the cylindrical coordinates of a point in space and its rectangular coordinates is given by
 
x  r cos u,   y  r sin u,   z  z.
It follows immediately from the derivation of the Laplacian in polar coordinates (see Section 14.1) 
that the Laplacian of a function u in cylindrical coordinates is

EXAMPLE 2 
Steady Temperatures in a Circular Cylinder
Find the steady-state temperature in the circular cylinder shown in FIGURE 14.2.5.
SOLUTION The boundary conditions suggest that the temperature u has radial symmetry. 
Accordingly, u (r, z) is determined from

u(2, z)  0, 0  z  4
 
u(r, 0)  0,  u(r, 4)  u0, 0  r  2.
Using u  R(r)Z(z) and separating variables gives

(13)
and 
 rR
  R  lrR  0 
(14)
 
    Z 
  lZ  0. 
(15)
For the choice l  a2  0, a  0, the general solution of (14) is
 
R(r)  c1J0(ar)  c2Y0(ar), 
and since a solution of (15) is defined on the finite interval [0, 2], we write its general 
solution as
 
Z(z)  c3 cosh az  c4 sinh az.
As in Example 1, the assumption that the temperature u is bounded at r  0 demands that 
c2  0. The condition u(2, z)  0 implies R(2)  0. This equation, 
 
J0(2a)  0,  
(16)
defines the positive eigenvalues ln  a2
n of the problem. Last, Z(0)  0 implies c3  0. Hence 
we have R  c1J0(anr), Z  c4 sinh anz, 
 
un  R(r) Z( z)  An sinh anz J0(anr)
and 
u(r, z)  a
q

An sinh anz J0(anr).
The remaining boundary condition at z  4 then yields the Fourier–Bessel series
 
u0  a

Do not conclude from two examples that every boundary-value problem in cylindrical 
coordinates gives rise to a Fourier–Bessel series.
EXAMPLE 3 
Steady Temperatures in a Circular Cylinder
Find the steady-state temperatures u(r,  z) in the circular cylinder defined by 0 # r # 1, 0 # z # 1
if the boundary conditions are
u(1, z)  1 2 z, 0 , z , 1
 
u(r, 0)  0, u(r, 1)  0, 0 , r , 1.
SOLUTION Because of the nonhomogeneous condition specified at r  1 we do not expect 
the eigenvalues of the problem to be defined in terms of zeros of a Bessel function of the first 
kind. As we did in Section 14.1 it is convenient in this problem to use l as the separation 
constant. Thus from (13) of Example 2 we see that separation of variables now gives the two 
ordinary differential equations
rR0 R9 2 lrR  0  and  Z0 lZ  0.
You should verify that the two cases l 5 0 and l 5 2a2 , 0 lead only to the trivial solution 
u  0. In the case l 5 a2 . 0 the DEs are
 
rR0 R9 2 a2rR  0  and  Z0  a2Z  0.
The first equation is the parametric form of Bessel’s modified DE of order n  0. The 
solution of this equation is R(r)  c1I0(ar)  c2K0(ar). We immediately define c2 5 0
because the modified Bessel function of the second kind K0(ar) is unbounded at r  0. 
Therefore, R(r)  c1I0(ar).
Now the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Sturm–Liouville problem
Z0  a2Z  0,  
Z (0)  0, 
Z (1)  0
are ln 5 n2p2, n 5 1, 2, 3, . . . and Z(z)  c3 sin npz. Thus product solutions that satisfy the 
PDE and the homogeneous boundary conditions are
 
un  R(r)Z(z)  An I0(npr) sin npz.
Next we form
u(r, z)  a
q
n1
An I0 (npr) sin npz.
The remaining condition at r  1 yields the Fourier sine series
u(1, z)  1 2 z  a
q
n1
An I0(np) sin npz.
From (5) of Section 12.3 we can write
An I0(np)  2#
1
0
(1 2 z) sin npz dz  2
np 
and  
An 

npI0(np).
The steady-state temperature is then
u(r, z)  2

q

I0(npr)
nI0(np)

REMARKS

in (9). Write the third partial sum S3(r, t) of the series 
solution.
(b) Use a CAS to plot the graph of S3(r, t) for t  0, 4, 10, 12, 20.
 20. Solve Problem 9 with boundary conditions u(c, t)  200, 
u(r, 0)  0. With these imposed conditions, one would expect 
intuitively that at any interior point of the plate, u(r, t) S 200 
as t S q. Assume that c  10 and that the plate is cast iron 
so that k  0.1 (approximately). Use a CAS as an aid in find-
ing the numerical values of the first five eigenvalues 
l1, l2, l3, l4, l5 of the boundary-value problem and the five 
coefficients A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 in the solution u(r, t). Let the 
corresponding approximate solution be denoted by S5(r, t). 
Plot S5(5, t) and S5(0, t) on a sufficiently large time interval 
[0, T ]. Use the plots of S5(5, t) and S5(0, t) to estimate the times 
(in seconds) for which u(5, t)  100 and u(0, t)  100. Repeat 
for u(5, t)  200 and u(0, t)  200.
 21. Consider an idealized drum consisting of a thin membrane 
stretched over a circular frame of radius 1. When such a drum 
is struck at its center, one hears a sound that is frequently 
described as a dull thud rather than a melodic tone. We can 
model a single drumbeat using the boundary-value problem 
solved in Example 1.
(a) Find the solution u(r, t) given in (9) when c  1, f (r)  0, 
and
g(r)  ev0, 
0 # r , b
0, 
b # r , 1.
(b) Show that the frequency of the standing wave un(r, t) is 
fn  aln /2p, where ln is the nth positive zero of J0(x). 
Unlike the solution of the one- dimensional wave equation 
in Section 13.4, the frequencies are not integer multiples 
of the fundamental frequency f1. Show that f2  2.295f1 
and f3  3.598f1. We say that the drumbeat produces 
anharmonic overtones. As a result the displacement

14.3 Spherical Coordinates
INTRODUCTION 
In this section we continue our examination of boundary-value problems 
in different coordinate systems. This time we are going to consider problems involving the heat, 
wave, and Laplace’s equation in spherical coordinates.
 Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates As shown in FIGURE 14.3.1, a point in 3-space 
is described in terms of rectangular coordinates and in spherical coordinates. The rectangular 
coordinates x, y, and z of the point are related to its spherical coordinates r, u, and f through the 
equations
 
x  r sin u cos f,   y  r sin u sin f,   z  r cos u. 
(1)
By using the equations in (1) it can be shown that the Laplacian 2u in the spherical coordinate 
system is

As you might imagine, problems involving (1) can be quite formidable. Consequently we shall 
consider only a few of the simpler problems that are independent of the azimuthal angle f.
Our first example is the Dirichlet problem for a sphere.

(5)
The latter equation is a form of Legendre’s equation (see Problems 52 and 53 in Exercises 5.3). 
Now the only solutions of (5) that are continuous and have continuous derivatives on the 
closed interval [1, 1] are the Legendre polynomials Pn(x) corresponding to l  n(n  1), 
n  0, 1, 2, …. Thus we take the solutions of (4) to be
 
(u)  Pn(cos u).
Furthermore, when l  n(n  1), the general solution of the Cauchy–Euler equation (3) is
 
R(r)  c1r n  c2r(n1).
Since we again expect u(r,  u ) to be bounded at r  0, we define c2  0. Hence un  Anr nPn(cos u ), 
and

At r  c,

The method of separation of 
variables that we employed in 
Chapters 13 and 14 is a powerful, 
but not universally applicable 
method for solving boundary-
value problems. If the partial 
differential equation in question 
is nonhomogeneous, or if the 
boundary conditions are time 
dependent, or if the domain of 
the spatial variable is infinite: 
(q, q), or semi-infinite: 
(a, q), we may be able to use an 
integral transform to solve the 
problem. In Section 15.2 we will 
solve problems that involve the 
heat and wave equations by 
means of the familiar Laplace 
transform. In Section 15.4 three 
new integral transforms, Fourier 
transforms, will be introduced 
and used.

Error Function
INTRODUCTION 
There are many functions in mathematics that are defined by means of an 
integral. For example, in many traditional calculus texts the natural logarithm is defined in the 
following manner: ln x  ex
1 dt>t, x  0. In earlier chapters we have already seen, albeit briefly, 
the error function erf (x), the complementary error function erfc(x), the sine integral function Si(x), 
the Fresnel sine integral S(x), and the gamma function (a); all of these functions are defined 
in terms of an integral. Before applying the Laplace transform to boundary-value problems, we 
need to know a little more about the error function and the complementary error function. In this 
section we examine the graphs and a few of the more obvious properties of erf (x) and erfc(x).
 Properties and Graphs Recall from (14) of Section 2.3 that the definitions of the error 
function erf (x) and complementary error function erfc(x) are, respectively, 
 
erf (x) 

"p
 #
x

eu2 du  and  erfc(x) 

"p#
q
x
eu2 du.

With the aid of polar coordinates, it can be demonstrated that
 
#
q
0
eu2 du  "p
2   or   2
"p
 #
q
0
eu2 du  1. 
(2)
We have already seen in (15) of Section 2.3 that when the second integral in (2) is written as eq
0  ex
0  eq
x  
we obtain an identity that relates the error function and the complementary error function:
 
erf (x)  erfc(x)  1. 
(3)
For x  0 it is seen in FIGURE 15.1.1 that erf(x) can be interpreted as the area of the blue region 
under the graph of f(t)  (2> !p)et2 on the interval [0, x] and erfc(x) is the area of the red region 
on [x, q). The graph of the function f is often referred to as a bell curve.
Because of the importance of erf(x) and erfc(x) in the solution of partial differential equations 
and in the theory of probability and statistics, these functions are built into computer algebra systems. 
So with the aid of Mathematica we get the graphs of erf(x) (in blue) and erfc(x) (in red) given in 
FIGURE 15.1.2. The y-intercepts of the two graphs give the values

Other numerical values of erf(x) and erfc(x) can be obtained directly from a CAS. Further inspec-
tion of the two graphs shows that:
• the domains of erf(x) and erfc(x) are (q, q),
• erf(x) and erfc(x) are continuous functions,
• lim

It should also be apparent that the graph of the error function is symmetric with respect to the 
origin and so erf(x) is an odd function:
 
erf (x)  erf(x).

REMARKS
The proofs of the results in Table 15.1.1 will not be given because they are long and somewhat 
complicated. For example, the proofs of entries 2 and 3 of the table require several changes of 
variables and the use of the convolution theorem. For those who are curious, see Introduction to 
the Laplace Transform, by Holl, Maple, and Vinograde, Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1959, pages 
142–143. A flavor of these kinds of proofs can be gotten by working Problem 1 in Exercises 15.1.

CHAPTER 15 Integral Transform Method
15.2 Applications of the Laplace Transform
INTRODUCTION 
In Chapter 4 we defined the Laplace transform of a function f (t), t  0, to be
+5 f (t)6  #
q
0
 est f (t) dt,
whenever the improper integral converges. This integral transforms a function f (t) into another 
function F of the transform parameter s, that is, +{ f (t)}  F(s). The main application of the 
Laplace transform in Chapter 4 was to the solution of certain types of initial-value problems 
involving linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Recall, the Laplace 
transform of such an equation reduces the ODE to an algebraic equation. In this section we are 
going to apply the Laplace transform to linear partial differential equations. We will see that this 
transform reduces a PDE to an ODE.
 Transform of Partial Derivatives The boundary-value problems considered in this 
section will involve either the one-dimensional wave and heat equations or slight variations of these 
equations. These PDEs involve an unknown function of two independent variables u(x, t), where 
the variable t represents time t  0. We define the Laplace transform of u(x, t) with respect to t by
 
+5u(x, t)6  #
q
0
estu(x, t) dt  U(x, s), 
where x is treated as a parameter. Throughout this section we shall assume that all the operational 
properties of Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 apply to functions of two variables. For example, by 
Theorem 4.2.2, the transform of the partial derivative 0u/0t is
 
 + e 0u
0t f  s+5u(x, t)6 2 u(x, 0);
that is,  
 + e 0u
0t f  sU(x, s) 2 u(x, 0).
 
(1)
Similarly,  
 + e 02u
0t
 2 f  s2U(x, s) 2 su(x, 0) 2 ut (x, 0). 
(2)
Since we are transforming with respect to t, we further suppose that it is legitimate to interchange 
integration and differentiation in the transform of 02u/0x 2:
 
 + e 02u
0x
 2 f  #
q
0
 est 02u
0x
 2 dt  #
q

  d

 2
dx
 2 +5u(x, t)6;
that is,  
+ e 02u
0x
 2 f  d
 2U
dx
 2 . 
(3)
In view of (1) and (2) we see that the Laplace transform is suited to problems with initial 
conditions—namely, those problems associated with the heat equation or the wave equation. We 
will see in Section 15.4 that boundary-value problems involving Laplace’s equation in which one 
(or both) of the spatial variables is defined on an unbounded interval can often be solved using 
different integral transforms.
EXAMPLE 1 
Laplace Transform of a PDE
Find the Laplace transform of the wave equation a2 02u
0x2  02u

 2,  t . 0.
SOLUTION From (2) and (3), 
 
+ ea2 02u

becomes

or 
a2 d
 2U
dx
 2 2 s2U  su(x, 0) 2 ut (x, 0). 
(4)
The Laplace transform with respect to t of either the wave equation or the heat equation elimi-
nates that variable, and for the one-dimensional equations the transformed equations are then 
ordinary differential equations in the spatial variable x. In solving a transformed equation, we 
treat s as a parameter.

SOLUTION The partial differential equation is recognized as the wave equation with a  1. 
From (4) and the given initial conditions, the transformed equation is
 
d
 2U
dx
 2 2 s2U  sin px,  
(5)
where U(x, s)  +{u(x, t)}. Since the boundary conditions are functions of t, we must also 
find their Laplace transforms:
 
+{u(0, t)}  U(0, s)  0  and  
+{u(1, t)}  U(1, s)  0. 
(6)
The results in (6) are boundary conditions for the ordinary differential equation (5). Since (5) 
is defined over a finite interval, its complementary function is
 
Uc(x, s)  c1 cosh sx  c2 sinh sx.
The method of undetermined coefficients yields a particular solution
 
 Up(x, s) 
1
s2  p2 sin px.
Hence 
U(x, s)  c1 cosh sx  c2 sinh sx  
1
s2  p2 sin px.
But the conditions U(0, s)  0 and U(1, s)  0 yield, in turn, c1  0 and c2  0. We conclude that
 
 U(x, s) 
1
s2  p2 sin px
 
 u(x, t)  +1 e
1
s2  p2 sin pxf  1
p sin px +1 e

Therefore 
u(x, t)  1
p sin px sin pt.
EXAMPLE 3 
Using the Laplace Transform to Solve a BVP
A very long string is initially at rest on the nonnegative x-axis. The string is secured at x  0, 
and its distant right end slides down a frictionless vertical support. The string is set in motion 
by letting it fall under its own weight. Find the displacement u(x, t).
SOLUTION Since the force of gravity is taken into consideration, it can be shown that the 
wave equation has the form
 
a2 02u
0x2 2 g  02u

where g is the acceleration due to gravity. The boundary and initial conditions are, 
respectively, 
u(0, t)  0,  lim

u(x, 0)  0,  0u
0t 2
 t0
 0, x . 0.
The second boundary condition limxS q 0u/0x  0 indicates that the string is horizontal at a 
great distance from the left end. Now from (2) and (3),

With the aid of undetermined coefficients, the general solution of the transformed equation 
is found to be
 
U(x, s)  c1e(x/a)s  c2e(x/a)s  g
s3.
The boundary condition limxS q dU/dx  0 implies c2  0, and U(0, s)  0 gives c1  g/s 3. 
Therefore
 
U(x, s)  g
s3 e(x>a)s 2 g
s3.
Now by the second translation theorem we have

To interpret the solution, let us suppose t  0 is fixed. For 0 	 x 	 at, the string is the shape 
of a parabola passing through the points (0, 0) and (at, 1
2 gt 2). For x  at, the string is 
described by the horizontal line u  1

Observe that the problem in the next example could be solved by the procedure in Section 13.6. 
The Laplace transform provides an alternative solution.

(7)
The transforms of the boundary conditions are
 
U(0, s)  0  and  U(1, s)  u0
s . 
(8)
Since we are concerned with a finite interval on the x-axis, we choose to write the general 
solution of (7) as
 
U(x, s)  c1 cosh (!sx)  c2 sinh (!sx).
Applying the two boundary conditions in (8) yields, respectively, c1  0 and c2  u0 (s sinh !s). 
Thus
 
U(x, s)  u0 
 sinh (!sx)
s sinh !s .
Now the inverse transform of the latter function cannot be found in most tables. However, 
by writing
 
 sinh (!sx)
s sinh !s  e!sx 2 e!sx
s(e!s 2 e!s)
 e(x21)!s 2 e(x1)!s
s(1 2 e2!s)
and using the geometric series

If we assume that the inverse Laplace transform can be done term by term, it follows from 
entry 3 of Table 15.1.1 that

value of x (the curve of intersection of a plane slicing the surface perpendicular to the x-axis) on 
the interval [0, 1], the temperature u(x, t) increases rapidly to a constant value as time increases.

15.3 Fourier Integral
INTRODUCTION 
In preceding chapters, Fourier series were used to represent a function f 
defined on a finite interval (p, p) or (0, L). When f and f  are piecewise continuous on such an 
interval, a Fourier series represents the function on the interval and converges to the periodic 
extension of f outside the interval. In this way we are justified in saying that Fourier series are 
associated only with periodic functions. We shall now derive, in a nonrigorous fashion, a means 
of representing certain kinds of nonperiodic functions that are defined on either an infinite interval 
(q, q) or a semi-infinite interval (0, q).
 From Fourier Series to Fourier Integral Suppose a function f is defined on (p, p). 
If we use the integral definitions of the coefficients (9), (10), and (11) of Section 12.2 in (8) of that 
section, then the Fourier series of f on the interval is
f (x)  1
2p #

 f (t) dt  1
p a
q
n1
c a#

f (t) cos np
p  t dtb cos np
p  x  a#
p
p
f (t) sin np
p  t dtb  sin np
p  xd . (1)
If we let an  np/p, a  an1  an  p/p, then (1) becomes
f (x)  1
2p a#
p
p
f (t) dtb Da  1

n1
c a#
p
p
f (t) cos ant dtb cos an x  a#
p
p
 f (t) sin ant dtb  sin an xd  Da. (2)
We now expand the interval (p, p) by letting p S q. Since p S q implies that a S 0, the 
limit of (2) has the form limaS 0 g
q
n1F(an)a, which is suggestive of the definition of the 
integral eq
0 F(a) da. Thus if eq
q f (t) dt exists, the limit of the first term in (2) is zero and the limit 
of the sum becomes
 
f (x)  1
p #
q
0
c a#
q
q
 f (t) cos at dtb  cos ax  a#
q
q
 f (t) sin at dtb  sin axd  da. 
(3)
The result given in (3) is called the Fourier integral of f on the interval (q, q). As the fol-
lowing summary shows, the basic structure of the Fourier integral is reminiscent of that of a 
Fourier series.

Definition 15.3.1 
Fourier Integral
The Fourier integral of a function f defined on the interval (q, q) is given by
f (x)  1

fA(a) cos ax  B(a) sin axg da,

where

 f (x) sin ax dx. 
(6)
 Convergence of a Fourier Integral Sufficient conditions under which a Fourier integral 
converges to f (x) are similar to, but slightly more restrictive than, the conditions for a Fourier series.
Theorem 15.3.1 
Conditions for Convergence
Let f and f  be piecewise continuous on every finite interval, and let f be absolutely integrable 
on (q, q).* Then the Fourier integral of f on the interval converges to f (x) at a point of 
continuity. At a point of discontinuity, the Fourier integral will converge to the average
f (x1)  f (x)
2
,
where f (x) and f (x) denote the limit of f at x from the right and from the left, respectively.

SOLUTION The function, whose graph is shown in FIGURE 15.3.1, satisfies the hypotheses of 
Theorem 15.3.1. Hence from (5) and (6) we have at once

Substituting these coefficients into (4) then gives

*This means that the integral #

The Fourier integral can be used to evaluate integrals. For example, at x  1 it follows from 
Theorem 15.3.1 that (7) converges to f (1); that is, 
 
#
q
0
 
 sin a
a  da  p
2.
The latter result is worthy of special note since it cannot be obtained in the “usual” manner; the 
integrand (sin x)/x does not possess an antiderivative that is an elementary function.
 Cosine and Sine Integrals When f is an even function on the interval (q, q), then 
the product f (x) cos ax is also an even function, whereas f (x) sin ax is an odd function. As a 
consequence of property (g) of Theorem 12.3.1, B(a)  0, and so (4) becomes
 
f (x)  2
p #
q

a#
q
0
 f (t) cos at dtb  cos ax da.
Here we have also used property (f ) of Theorem 12.3.1 to write
 
#
q
q
 f (t) cos at dt  2#
q
0
 f (t) cos at dt.
Similarly, when f is an odd function on (q, q) the products f (x) cos ax and f (x) sin ax are odd 
and even functions, respectively. Therefore A(a)  0 and
 
f (x)  2
p #
q
0
a#
q

 f (t) sin at dtb  sin ax da.
We summarize in the following definition.
Definition 15.3.2 
Fourier Cosine and Sine Integrals
(i) The Fourier integral of an even function on the interval (q, q) is the cosine integral
f (x)  2

(8)
where 
A(a)  #

(ii) The Fourier integral of an odd function on the interval (q, q) is the sine  integral
f (x)  2

 B(a) sin ax da, 
(10)
where 
B(a)  #

SOLUTION It is apparent from FIGURE 15.3.2 that f is an even function. Hence we represent f 
by the Fourier cosine integral (8). From (9) we obtain

CHAPTER 15 Integral Transform Method
The integrals (8) and (10) can be used when f is neither odd nor even and defined only on the 
half-line (0, q). In this case (8) represents f on the interval (0, q) and its even (but not periodic) 
extension to (q, 0), whereas (10) represents f on (0, q) and its odd extension to the interval 
(q, 0). The next example illustrates this concept.
EXAMPLE 3 
Cosine and Sine Integral Representations
Represent f (x)  ex, x  0 (a) by a cosine integral; (b) by a sine integral.
SOLUTION The graph of the function is given in FIGURE 15.3.3.
(a) Using integration by parts, we find
 
A(a)  #

Therefore from (8) the cosine integral of f is

(13)
(b) Similarly, we have
B(a)  #

From (10) the sine integral of f is then

FIGURE 15.3.4 shows the graphs of the functions and their extensions represented by the two

 Complex Form The Fourier integral (4) also possesses an equivalent complex form, or 
exponential form, that is analogous to the complex form of a Fourier series (see Section 12.4).

(19)
This latter form of the Fourier integral will be put to use in the next section when we return 
to the solution of boundary-value problems.
 Use of Computers The convergence of a Fourier integral can be examined in a manner 
that is similar to graphing partial sums of a Fourier series. To illustrate, let’s use the results in 
parts (a) and (b) of Example 3. By definition of an improper integral, the Fourier cosine integral 
representation of f (x)  ex, x  0 in (13) can be written as f (x)  limb S q Fb(x), where
 
Fb(x)  2
p #
b
0
 
 cos ax
1  a2  da,
and x is treated as a parameter. Similarly, the Fourier sine integral representation of f (x)  ex, 
x  0 in (14) can be written as f (x)  limb S qGb(x), where
 
Gb(x)  2
p #
b
0
 a sin ax
1  a2  da.
Because the Fourier integrals (13) and (14) converge, the graphs of the partial integrals Fb(x) 
and Gb(x) for a specified value of b  0 will be an approximation to the graph of f and its 
even and odd extensions shown in Figure 15.3.4(a) and 15.3.4(b), respectively. The graphs of 
Fb(x) and Gb(x) for b  20 given in FIGURE 15.3.5 were obtained using Mathematica and its 
NIntegrate application. See Problem 21 in Exercises 15.3.

Fourier Transforms
INTRODUCTION 
Up to now we have studied and used only one integral transform: the 
Laplace transform. But in Section 15.3 we saw that the Fourier integral had three alternative 
forms: the cosine integral, the sine integral, and the complex or exponential form. In the present 
section we shall take these three forms of the Fourier integral and develop them into three new 
integral transforms naturally called Fourier transforms. In addition, we shall expand on the 
concept of a transform pair, that is, an integral transform and its inverse. We shall also see that 
the inverse of an integral transform is itself another integral transform.
 Transform Pairs The Laplace transform F(s) of a function f (t) is defined by an integral, 
but up to now we have been using the symbolic representation f (t)  +1{F(s)} to denote the 
inverse Laplace transform of F(s). Actually, the inverse Laplace transform is also an integral 
transform. If
 
 +5 f (t)6  #
q

estf (t) dt  F(s),  
(1)
then the inverse Laplace transform is
 
 +15F(s)6 
1
2pi #
giq
g2iq
estF(s) ds  f (t). 
(2)
The last integral is called a contour integral; its evaluation requires the use of complex variables 
and is beyond the scope of this discussion. The point here is this: Integral transforms appear in 
transform pairs. If f (x) is transformed into F(a) by an integral transform
 
 F(a)  #

f (x) K(a, x) dx, 
(3)
then the function f can be recovered by another integral transform
 
 f (x)  #
b
c
F(a) H(a, x) da, 
(4)
called the inverse transform. The functions K and H in the integrands of (3) and (4) are called 
the kernels of their respective transforms. We identify K(s, t)  est as the kernel of the Laplace 
transform and H(s, t)  est/2pi as the kernel of the inverse Laplace transform.

 Fourier Transform Pairs The Fourier integral is the source of three new integral trans-
forms. From (8) and (9), (10) and (11), and (18) and (19) of the preceding section, we are prompted 
to define the following Fourier transform pairs.

 Existence The conditions under which (5), (7), and (9) exist are more stringent than those 
for the Laplace transform. For example, you should verify that ^{1}, ^s{1}, and ^c{1} do not 
exist. Sufficient conditions for existence are that f be absolutely integrable on the appropriate 
interval and that f and f  be piecewise continuous on every finite  interval.
 Operational Properties Since our immediate goal is to apply these new transforms to 
boundary-value problems, we need to examine the transforms of derivatives.
 Fourier Transform 
Suppose that f is continuous and absolutely integrable on the inter-
val (q, q) and f  is piecewise continuous on every finite interval. If f (x) S 0 as x S q, then 
integration by parts gives
 
 ^5 f 9(x)6  #

  ia#
q
q
 f (x) eiax dx;
that is,  
^{ f (x)}  iaF(a). 
(11)
Similarly, under the added assumptions that f  is continuous on (q, q), f (x) is piecewise 
continuous on every finite interval, and f (x) S 0 as x S q, we have
 
^{ f (x)}  (ia)2  ^{ f (x)}  a2F(a). 
(12)
In general, under conditions analogous to those leading to (12), we have
 
^{ f  (n)(x)}  (ia)n  ^{ f (x)}  (ia)nF(a),
where n  0, 1, 2, … .
It is important to be aware that the sine and cosine transforms are not suitable for transforming 
the first derivative (or, for that matter, any derivative of odd order). It is readily shown that
 
^s{ f (x)}  a^c{ f (x)}  and  
^c{ f (x)}  a^s{ f (x)}  f (0).

CHAPTER 15 Integral Transform Method
The difficulty is apparent; the transform of f (x) is not expressed in terms of the original integral 
transform.
 Fourier Sine Transform 
Suppose that f and f  are continuous, f is absolutely integrable 
on the interval [0, q), and f  is piecewise continuous on every finite interval. If f S 0 and f  S 0 
as x S q, then
 
 ^s5 f 0(x)6  #

  af (0) 2 a2^s5 f (x)6;
that is,  
^s{ f (x)}  a2F(a)  af (0). 
(13)
 Fourier Cosine Transform Under the same assumptions that lead to (9), we find the 
Fourier cosine transform of f (x) to be
 
^c{ f (x)}  a2F(a)  f (0). 
(14)
The nature of the transform properties (12), (13), and (14) indicate, in contrast to the Laplace 
transform, that Fourier transforms are suitable for problems in which the spatial variable x (or y) 
is defined on an infinite or semi-infinite interval. But a natural question then arises:
How do we know which transform to use on a given boundary-value problem?
Clearly, to use the Fourier transform (5), the domain of the variable to eliminate must be 
(q, q). To utilize a sine or cosine transform, the domain of at least one of the spatial variables 
in the problem must be [0, q). However, the determining factor in choosing between the sine 
transform (7) and the cosine transform (9) is the type of boundary condition specified at x  0 
(or y  0), that is, whether u or its first partial derivative is given at this boundary.
In solving boundary-value problems using integral transforms most solutions are formal. 
In the language of mathematics, this means assumptions about the solution u and its partial 
derivatives go unstated. But one assumption should be kept in the back of your mind. In the 
examples that follow, it will be assumed without further mention that u and 0u>0x (or 0u>0y) 
approach 0 as x S q (or y S q). These are not major restrictions since these conditions 
hold in most applications.
EXAMPLE 1 
Using the Fourier Transform
Solve the heat equation k 02u
0x
 2  0u
0t , q  x  q, t  0, subject to
u(x, 0)  f (x)  where  f (x)  eu0, 
ZxZ , 1,
0, 
ZxZ . 1.
SOLUTION The problem can be interpreted as finding the temperature u(x, t) in an infinite 
rod. Because the domain of x is the infinite interval (q, q) we use the Fourier transform 
(5) and define the transform of u(x, t) to be
^5u(x, t)6  #
q
q
u(x, t) eiax dx  U(a, t).
If we write
^ e 02u
0x
 2 f  a2U(a, t)  and  ^ e 0u
0t f  d
dt ^5u(x, t)6  dU
dt ,
These assumptions are 
sometimes used during the 
actual solution process. See 
Problems 13, 14, and 26 in 
Exercises 15.4.

then the Fourier transform of the partial differential equation,
^ ek 02u
0x
 2 f  ^ e 0u
0t f ,
becomes the ordinary differential equation
 
ka2U(a, t)  dU
dt   or  
dU
dt   ka2U(a, t)  0.
Solving the last equation by the method of Section 2.3 gives U(a, t)  ceka2t. The initial 
temperature u(x, 0)  f(x) in the rod is shown in FIGURE 15.4.1 and its Fourier transform is
 
^5u(x, 0)6  U(a, 0)  #
q
q
 f (x) eiax dx  #
1
1
u0  eiax dx  u0 eia 2 eia
ia
 .
By Euler’s formula
 eia  cos a  i sin a
 eia  cos a 2 i sin a.
Subtracting these two results and solving for sin a gives sin a  eia 2 eia
2i
. Hence we can 
rewrite the transform of the initial condition as U(a, 0)  2u0 sin a
a . Applying this condition 
to the solution U(a, t)  ceka2t gives U(a, 0)  c  2u0 sin a
a  and so
 
U(a, t)  2u0 
 sin a
a  eka2t.
It then follows from the inverse Fourier transform (6) that
 
u(x, t)  u0
p#
q
q
 
 sin a
a  eka2t
 eiax da.
This integral can be simplified somewhat by using Euler’s formula again as eiax  
cos ax  sin ax and noting that
 
#
q
q
 
 sin a
a  eka2t sin ax da  0
because the integrand is an odd function of a. Hence we finally have the solution
 
u(x, t)  u0
p#
q
q
 
 sin a cos ax
a
 eka2t da. 
(15)
It is left to the reader to show that the solution (15) in Example 1 can be expressed in terms 
of the error function. See Problem 23 in Exercises 15.4.
EXAMPLE 2 
Two Useful Fourier Transforms
It is a straightforward exercise in integration by parts to show that Fourier sine and cosine 
transforms of f(x)  ebx, x  0, b  0, are, in turn,
 
^s5ebx6  #
q
0
ebx sin ax dx 
a
b2  a2, 
(16)
^c5ebx6  #
q
0
ebx cos ax dx 
b
b2  a2. 
(17)
Another way to quickly obtain (and remember) these two results is to identify the two integrals 
with the more familiar Laplace transform in (2) of Section 4.1. With the symbols x, b, and 
a playing the part of t, s, and k, respectively, it follows that (16) and (17) are identical to (d) 
and (e) in Theorem 4.1.1.

CHAPTER 15 Integral Transform Method
EXAMPLE 3 
Using the Cosine Transform
The steady-state temperature in a semi-infinite plate is determined from
02u
0x
 2  02u
0y2  0, 0 , x , p, y . 0
u(0, y)  0, u(p, y)  ey, y . 0
 
0u
0y
 2
 y0
 0, 0 , x , p.
Solve for u(x, y).
SOLUTION The domain of the variable y and the prescribed condition at y  0 indicate that 
the Fourier cosine transform is suitable for the problem. We define
 
^c{u(x, y)}  #
q
0
u (x, y) cos ay dy  U(x, a).
In view of (14),  
^c e 02u
0x
 2 f   ^c e 02u
0y2 f   ^c{0}
becomes
 
d
 2U
dx
 2 2 a2U(x, a) 2 uy(x, 0)  0  or  d 2U
dx
 2 2 a
 2U  0.
Since the domain of x is a finite interval, we choose to write the solution of the ordinary 
differential equation as
 
U(x, a)  c1 cosh ax  c2 sinh ax. 
(18)
Now ^c{u(0, y)}  ^c{0} and ^c{u(p, y)}  ^c{ey} are in turn equivalent to
 
U(0, a)  0  and  U(p, a)  
1
1  a2.  
(19)
Note that the value U(p, a) in (19) is (17) of Example 2 with b  1. When we apply the two 
conditions in (19) to the solution (18) we obtain c1  0 and c2  1[(1  a   2) sinh a]. Therefore,
 
U(x, a) 
 sinh ax
(1  a2 ) sinh ap,
and so from (10) we arrive at
 
u(x, y)  2
p#
q
0
 
 sinh ax
(1  a2 ) sinh ap cos ay da. 
(20)
Had u(x, 0) been given in Example 3 rather than uy(x, 0), then the sine transform would have 
been appropriate.
In Problems 1–18 and 24–26, use an appropriate Fourier 
 transform to solve the given boundary-value problem. Make 
 assumptions about boundedness where necessary.

15.5 Fast Fourier Transform
INTRODUCTION 
Consider a function f that is defined and continuous on the interval [0, 2p]. 
If x0, x1, x2, … , xn, … are equally spaced points in the interval, then the corresponding function 
values f0, f1, f2, … , fn, … shown in FIGURE 15.5.1 are said to represent a discrete sampling of the 
function f. The notion of discrete samplings of a function is important in the analysis of continu-
ous signals.
In this section, the complex or exponential form of a Fourier series plays an important role in

where the v  2p/2p  p/p is the fundamental angular frequency and 2p is the fundamental 
period. In the discrete case, however, the input is f0, f1, f2, … , which are the values of the function f 
at equally spaced points x  nT, n  0, 1, 2, … . The number T is called the sampling rate or 
the length of the sampling interval.* If f is continuous at T, then the sample of f at T is defined 
to be the product f (x)d(x  T ), where d(x  T ) is the Dirac delta function (see Section 4.5). We 
can then represent this discrete version of f, or discrete signal, as the sum of unit impulses acting 
on the function at x  nT:

(3) is the same as

(4)
The expression F(a) in (4) is called the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the function f. 
We often write the coefficients f (nT ) in (4) as f (n) or fn. It is also worth noting that since eiax is 
periodic in a and eiaT  ei(aT2p)  ei(a2p/T)T, we only need to consider the function for a in 
[0, 2p/T ]. Let N  2p/T. This places x in the interval [0, 2p]. So, because we sample over one 
period, the sum in (4) is actually finite.
Now consider the function values f (x) at N equally spaced points, x  nT, n  0, 1, 2, … , 
N  1, in the interval [0, 2p]; that is, f0, f1, f2, … , fN1. The (finite) discrete Fourier series

Let the N  N matrix in (6) be denoted by the symbol FN. Given the inputs f0, f1, f2, … , fN1, is 
there an easy way to find the Fourier coefficients c0, c1, c2, … , cN1? If FN is the matrix consist-
ing of the complex conjugates of the entries of FN and if I denotes the N  N identity matrix, 
then we have

 Discrete Transform Pair Recall from Section 15.4 that in the Fourier transform pair 
we use a function f (x) as input and compute the coefficients that give the amplitude for each 
frequency k (ck in the case of periodic functions of period 2p) or we compute the coefficients 
that give the amplitude for each frequency a (F(a) in the case of nonperiodic functions).
Also, given these frequencies and coefficients, we could reconstruct the original function f (x). 
In the discrete case, we use a sample of N values of the function f (x) as input and compute the 
coefficients that give the amplitude for each sampled frequency. Given these frequencies and 
coefficients, it is possible to reconstruct the n sampled values of f (x). The transform pair, the 
discrete Fourier transform pair, is given by

given in FIGURE 15.5.2.
Finding the coefficients involves multiplying by matrices Fn and Fn. Because of the nature of 
these matrices, these multiplications can be done in a very computationally  efficient manner, 
using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is discussed later in this section.

can also approximate this solution with a finite sum

The final task is to find the values cj(0). However, recall that u(x, t)  g
n21
k0 ck (t)eikx and 
u(x, 0)  f (x), so cj(0) are the coefficients of the discrete Fourier series of f (x). Compare this 
with Section 13.3. 
 Heat Equation and Discrete Fourier Transform The initial-value problem (8) 
can be interpreted as the mathematical model for the temperature u(x, t) in an infinitely long bar. 
In Section 15.4 we saw that we can solve (8) using the Fourier transform and that the solution 
u(x, t) depends on the Fourier transform F(a) of f (x) (see pages 784–785). We can approximate 
F(a) by taking a different look at the discrete Fourier transform.
First we approximate values of the transform by discretizing the integral ^{ f (x)}  F(a) 

 Aliasing A problem known as aliasing may appear whenever one is sampling data at 
equally spaced intervals. If you have ever seen a motion picture where rotating wheels appear to 
be rotating slowly (or even backwards!), you have experienced aliasing. The wheels may rotate 

at a high rate, but because the frames in a motion picture are “sampled” at equally spaced inter-
vals, we see a low rate of rotation.
Graphing calculators also suffer from aliasing due to the way they sample points to create 
graphs. For example, plot the trigonometric function y  sin 20px with frequency 10 on a Texas 
Instruments TI-92 and you get the nice graph in FIGURE 15.5.4(a). At higher frequencies, say 
y  sin 100px with frequency 50, you get the correct amount of cycles, but the amplitudes of 
the graph in Figure 15.5.4(b) are clearly not 1.
On a calculator such as the Texas Instruments TI-83, the graphs in FIGURE 15.5.5 show aliasing 
much more clearly.
The problem lies in the fact that e2npi  cos 2np  i sin 2np  1 for all integer values of n. 
The discrete Fourier series cannot distinguish einx from 1 as these functions are equal at sampled 
points x  2kp>n. The higher frequency is seen as the lower one. Consider the functions cos (pn>2) 
and cos (7pn>2). If we sample at the points n  0, 1, 2, … , these two functions appear the same, 
the lower frequency is assumed, and the amplitudes (Fourier coefficients) associated with the 
higher frequencies are added in with the amplitude of the low frequency. If these Fourier coef-
ficients at large frequencies are small, however, we do not have a big problem. In the Sampling 
Theorem below, we will see what can take care of this problem.
 Signal Processing Beyond solving PDEs as we have done earlier, the ideas of this sec-
tion are useful in signal processing. Consider the functions we have been dealing with as signals 
from a source. We would like to reconstruct a signal transmitted by sampling it at discrete points. 
The problem of calculating an infinite number of Fourier coefficients and summing an infinite 
series to reconstruct a signal (function) is not practical. A finite sum could be a decent approxi-
mation, but certain signals can be reconstructed by a finite number of samples.
Theorem 15.5.1 
Sampling Theorem
If a signal f (x) is band-limited; that is, if the range of frequencies of the signal lie in a band 
A  k  A, then the signal can be reconstructed by sampling two times for every cycle of 
the highest frequency present; in fact,

To justify Theorem 15.5.1, consider the Fourier transform F(a) of f (x) as a periodic extension 
so that F(a) is defined for all values of a, not just those in A  k  A. Using the Fourier trans-
form, we have

Note that we used, in succession, an interchange of summation and integration (not always 
allowed, but is acceptable here), integration of an exponential function, sin u  eiu 2 eiu
2i
, and
the fact that sin(u)  sin u.
So, from samples at intervals of pA, all values of f can be reconstructed. Note that if we 
allow eiAx (in other words, we allow k  A), then the Sampling Theorem will fail. If, for 
example, f (x)  sin Ax, then all samples will be 0 and f cannot be reconstructed, as aliasing 
appears again.
 Band-Limited Signals A signal that contains many frequencies can be filtered so that 
only frequencies in an interval survive, and it becomes a band-limited signal. Consider the signal 
f (x). Multiply the Fourier transform F(a) of f by a function G(a) that is 1 on the interval contain-
ing the frequencies a you wish to keep, and 0 elsewhere. This multiplication of two Fourier 
transforms in the frequency domain is a convolution of f (x) and g(x) in the time domain. Recall 
that Problem 20 in Exercises 15.4 states that
 
^1{F(a)G(a)}  #
q
q
 f (t) g (x 2 t) dt.
The integral on the right-hand side is called the convolution of  f and g and is written f *g. The 
last statement can be written more compactly as
 
^{ f *g}  F(a)G(a).
The analogous idea for Laplace transforms is in Section 4.4. The function g(x)  
 sin Ax
px  has as 
its Fourier transform the pulse function
 
G(a)  e1, 
A , a , A
0, 
elsewhere.
This implies that the function (   f *g)(x) is band-limited, with frequencies between A 
and A.
 Computing with the Fast Fourier Transform Return to the discrete Fourier trans-
form of f (x), where we have f sampled at n equally spaced points a distance of T apart, namely, 
0, T, 2T, 3T, … , (n  1)T. (We used T  p/n at the beginning of this section.) Substituting this,

Without going into details, a computation of Fn requires n2 computations, while 
using the matrix factorization (the FFT) means the number of computations is reduced 
to one proportional to n ln n. Try a few larger values of n and you will see substantial 
savings.

In Section 6.5, we saw that one 
way of approximating a solution 
of a second-order boundary-value 
problem was to work with a finite 
difference equation replacement 
of the linear ordinary differential 
equation. The difference equation 
was constructed by replacing the 
ordinary derivatives d2y/dx2 and 
dy/dx by difference quotients. 
We will see in this chapter that 
the same idea carries over to 
boundary-value problems involving 
linear partial differential equations.

16.1 
Laplace’s Equation
INTRODUCTION Recall from Section 13.1 that linear second-order PDEs in two independent 
variables are classified as elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. Roughly, elliptic PDEs involve 
partial derivatives with respect to spatial variables only and as a consequence solutions of such 
equations are determined by boundary conditions alone. Parabolic and hyperbolic equations involve 
partial derivatives with respect to both spatial and time variables, and so solutions of such equa-
tions generally are determined from boundary and initial conditions. A solution of an elliptic PDE 
(such as Laplace’s equation) can describe a physical system whose state is in equilibrium (steady 
state), a solution of a parabolic PDE (such as the heat equation) can describe a diffusional state, 
whereas a hyperbolic PDE (such as the wave equation) can describe a vibrational state.
In this section we begin our discussion with approximation methods appropriate for elliptic 
equations. Our focus will be on the simplest but probably the most important PDE of the elliptic 
type: Laplace’s equation.
 Difference Equation Replacement Suppose that we are seeking a solution u(x, y) 
of Laplace’s equation
 
02u
0x
 2  02u
0y2  0
in a planar region R that is bounded by some curve C. See FIGURE 16.1.1. Analogous to (6) of 
Section 6.5, using the central differences 
 
u(x  h, y)  2u(x, y)  u(x  h, y)   and   u(x, y  h)  2u(x, y)  u(x, y  h),
approximations for the second partial derivatives uxx and uyy can be obtained using the difference 
quotients
 
 02u
0x
 2 <  1
h2 fu(x  h, y) 2 2u(x, y)  u(x 2 h, y)g  
(1)
 
 02u
0y2 <  1
h2 fu(x, y  h) 2 2u(x, y)  u(x, y 2 h)g. 
(2)
Now by adding (1) and (2) we obtain a five-point approximation to the Laplacian: 
 
02u
0x
 2  02u
0y2 < 1
h2 [u(x  h, y)  u(x, y  h)  u(x  h, y)  u(x, y  h)  4u(x, y)].
Hence we can replace Laplace’s equation by the difference equation
 
u(x  h, y)  u(x, y  h)  u(x  h, y)  u(x, y  h)  4u(x, y)  0. 
(3)
If we adopt the notation u(x, y)  uij and
 
u(x  h, y)  ui1, j,  u(x, y  h)  ui, j1
 
u(x  h, y)  ui1, j,  u(x, y  h)  ui, j1, 
then (3) becomes
 
ui1, j  ui, j1  ui1, j  ui, j1  4uij  0. 
(4)
To understand (4) a little better, suppose a rectangular grid consisting of horizontal lines spaced 
h units apart and vertical lines spaced h units apart is placed over the region R. The number h is 
called the mesh size. See FIGURE 16.1.2(a). The points Pij  P(ih, jh), i and j integers, of intersec-
tion of the horizontal and vertical lines, are called mesh points or lattice points. A mesh point is 
an interior point if its four nearest neighboring mesh points are points of R. Points in R or on C 
that are not interior points are called boundary points. For example, in Figure 16.1.2(a) we have
 
P20  P(2h, 0), P11  P(h, h), P21  P(2h, h), P22  P(2h, 2h),

and so on. Of the points listed, P21 and P22 are interior points, whereas P20 and P11 are boundary 
points. In Figure 16.1.2(a) interior points are the dots shown in red and the boundary points are 
shown in black. Now from (4) we see that
 
uij  1
4 [ui1, j  ui, j1  ui1, j  ui, j1], 
(5)
and so, as shown in Figure 16.1.2(b), the value of uij at an interior mesh point of R is the average 
of the values of u at four neighboring mesh points. The neighboring points Pi1, j, Pi, j1, Pi1, j, 
and Pi, j1 correspond, respectively, to the four points on a compass: E, N, W, and S.
 Dirichlet Problem Recall that in the Dirichlet problem for Laplace’s equation 2u  0, 
the values of u(x, y) are prescribed on the boundary C of a region R. The basic idea is to find an 
approximate solution to Laplace’s equation at interior mesh points by replacing the partial dif-
ferential equation at these points by the difference equation (4). Hence the approximate values 
of u at the mesh points—namely, the uij —are related to each other and, possibly, to known values 
of u if a mesh point lies on the boundary C. In this manner we obtain a system of linear algebraic 
equations that we solve for the unknown uij. The following example illustrates the method for a 
square region.

utilizing the superposition principle. To apply the present numerical method, let us start with a 
mesh size of h  2
3. As we see in FIGURE 16.1.3, that choice yields four interior points and eight 
boundary points. The numbers listed next to the boundary points are the exact values of u obtained 
from the specified condition along that boundary. For example, at P31  P(3h, h)  P(2, 2
3) we 
have x  2 and y  2
3, and so the condition u(2, y) gives u(2, 2
3)  2
3(2  2
3)  8
9. Similarly, at 
P13  P( 2
3, 2), the condition u(x, 2) gives u( 2
3, 2)  2
3. We now apply (4) at each interior point. 
For example, at P11 we have i  1 and j  1, so (4) becomes
 
u21  u12  u01  u10  4u11  0.
Since u01  u(0, 2
3)  0 and u10  u( 2
3, 0)  0, the foregoing equation becomes 4u11  u21  u12  0. 
Repeating this, in turn, at P21, P12, and P22, we get three additional equations:
 
4u11  u21  u12 
  
 0
 
  u11  4u21 

at the four interior points to be

CHAPTER 16 Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations
As in the discussion of ordinary differential equations, we expect that a smaller value of h
will improve the accuracy of the approximation. However, using a smaller mesh size means, of 
course, that there are more interior mesh points, and correspondingly there is a much larger 
system of equations to be solved. For a square region whose length of side is L, a mesh size of 
h  L /n will yield a total of (n  1) 2 interior mesh points. In Example 1, for n  8, the mesh 
size is a reasonable h  2
8  1
4, but the number of interior points is (8  1) 2  49. Thus we have 
49 equations in 49 unknowns. In the next example we use a mesh size of h  1
2.

As we see in FIGURE 16.1.4, with n  4, a mesh size h  2
4  1
2 for the square in Example 1 gives 
32  9 interior mesh points. Applying (4) at these points and using the indicated boundary 
conditions, we get nine equations in nine unknowns. So that you can verify the results, we 
give the system in an unsimplified form:
 
u21  u12    0   0  4u11  0
 
u31  u22  u11   0  4u21  0

This is an example of a sparse matrix in that a large percentage of the entries are zeros. The 
matrix (8) is also an example of a banded matrix. These kinds of matrices are characterized by 
the properties that the entries on the main diagonal and on diagonals (or bands) parallel to the 
main diagonal are all nonzero. The bands shown in red in (8) are separated by diagonals consist-
ing of all zeros or not.

 Gauss–Seidel Iteration Problems requiring approximations to solutions of partial 
differential equations invariably lead to large systems of linear algebraic equations. It is not 
uncommon to have to solve systems involving hundreds of equations. Although a direct method 
of solution such as Gaussian elimination leaves unchanged the zero entries outside the bands 
in a matrix such as (8), it does fill in the positions between the bands with non zeros. Since 
storing very large matrices uses up a large portion of computer memory, it is usual practice 
to solve a large system in an indirect manner. One popular indirect method is called Gauss–
Seidel iteration.
We shall illustrate this method for the system in (6). For the sake of simplicity we replace the 
double-subscripted variables u11, u21, u12, and u22 by x1, x2, x3, and x4,  respectively.
EXAMPLE 3 
Gauss–Seidel Iteration
Step 1: Solve each equation for the variables on the main diagonal of the system. That is, 
in (6), solve the first equation for x1, the second equation for x2, and so on:
 
x1  0.25x2  0.25x3
 
x2  0.25x1  0.25x4  0.2222
 
x3  0.25x1  0.25x4  0.1667 
(9)
 
x4  0.25x2  0.25x3  0.3889.
These equations can be obtained directly by using (5) rather than (4) at the interior points.
Step 2: Iterations. We start by making an initial guess for the values of x1, x2, x3, and x4. If this 
were simply a system of linear equations and we knew nothing about the solution, we could 
start with x1  0, x2  0, x3  0, x4  0. But since the solution of (9) represents approxima-
tions to a solution of a boundary-value problem, it would seem reasonable to use as the initial 
guess for the values of x1  u11, x2  u21, x3  u12, and x4  u22 the average of all the bound-
ary conditions. In this case the average of the numbers at the eight boundary points shown in 
Figure 16.1.2 is approximately 0.4. Thus our initial guess is x1  0.4, x2  0.4, x3  0.4, and 
x4  0.4. Iterations of the Gauss–Seidel method use the x values as soon as they are computed. 
Note that the first equation in (9) depends only on x2 and x3; thus substituting x2  0.4 and 
x3  0.4 gives x1  0.2. Since the second and third equations depend on x1 and x4, we use the 
newly calculated values x1  0.2 and x4  0.4 to obtain x2  0.3722 and x3  0.3167. The 
fourth equation depends on x2 and x3, so we use the new values x2  0.3722 and x3  0.3167 
to get x4  0.5611. In summary, the first iteration has given the values
 
x1  0.2, x2  0.3722, x3  0.3167, x4  0.5611.
Note how close these numbers are already to the actual values given at the end of Example 1.
The second iteration starts with substituting x2  0.3722 and x3  0.3167 into the first 
equation. This gives x1  0.1722. From x1  0.1722 and the last computed value of x4 (namely, 
x4  0.5611), the second and third equations give, in turn, x2  0.4055 and x3  0.3500. 
Using these two values, we find from the fourth equation that x4  0.5678. At the end of the 
second iteration we have
 
x1  0.1722, x2  0.4055, x3  0.3500, x4  0.5678.
The third through seventh iterations are summarized in Table 16.1.1.

REMARKS
(i) In the examples given in this section, the values of uij were determined using known values 
of u at boundary points. But what do we do if the region is such that boundary points do not 
coincide with the actual boundary C of the region R ? In this case the required values can be 
obtained by interpolation.
(ii) It is sometimes possible to cut down the number of equations to solve by using symmetry. 
Consider the rectangular region defined by 0  x  2, 0  y  1, shown in FIGURE 16.1.5. The 
boundary conditions are u  0 along the boundaries x  0, x  2, y  1, and u  100 along 
y  0. The region is symmetric about the lines x  1 and y  1
2, and the interior points P11 and 
P31 are equidistant from the neighboring boundary points at which the specified values of u are 
the same. Consequently we assume that u11  u31, and so the system of three equations in three 
unknowns reduces to two equations in two unknowns. See Problem 2 in Exercises 16.1.
(iii) In the context of approximating a solution to Laplace’s equation, the iteration technique 
illustrated in Example 3 is often referred to as Liebman’s method.
(iv) It may not be noticeable on a computer, but convergence of Gauss–Seidel iteration (or 
Liebman’s method) may not be particularly fast. Also, in a more general setting, Gauss–Seidel 
iteration may not converge at all. For conditions that are sufficient to guarantee convergence 
of Gauss–Seidel iteration you are encouraged to consult texts on numerical analysis.
In Problems 1–8, use a computer as a computational aid.
In Problems 1–4, use (4) to approximate the solution of 
Laplace’s equation at the interior points of the given region. 
Use symmetry when possible.

16.2 Heat Equation
INTRODUCTION The basic idea in the following discussion is the same as in Section 16.1; 
we approximate a solution of a PDE—this time a parabolic PDE—by replacing the equation 
with a finite difference equation. But unlike the preceding section, we shall consider two finite-
difference approximation methods for parabolic partial differential equations: one called an 
explicit method and the other an implicit method. For the sake of definiteness, we consider only 
the one-dimensional heat equation.

dimensional heat equation

we again replace the derivatives by difference quotients. Using the central difference approxima-

equation (1) becomes

k [u(x, t  k)  u(x, t)]. 
(2)
If we let l  ck/h2 and
 
u(x, t)  uij, u(x  h, t)  ui1, j, u(x  h, t)  ui1, j, u(x, t  k)  ui, j1, 
then, after simplifying, (2) is
 
ui, j1  lui1, j  (1  2l)uij  lui1, j . 
(3)
In the case of the heat equation (1), typical boundary conditions are u(0, t)  u1, u(a, t)  u2, 
t 	 0, and an initial condition is u(x, 0)  f (x), 0  x  a. The function f can be interpreted as 
the initial temperature distribution in a homogeneous rod extending from x  0 to x  a ; u1 and 
u2 can be interpreted as constant temperatures at the endpoints of the rod. Although we shall not

CHAPTER 16 Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations
prove it, the boundary-value problem consisting of (1) and these two boundary conditions 
and one initial condition has a unique solution when f is continuous on the closed interval [0, a]. 
This latter condition will be assumed, and so we replace the initial condition by u(x, 0)  f (x), 
0  x  a. Moreover, instead of working with the semi-infinite region in the xt-plane defined by 
the inequalities 0  x  a, t 
 0, we use a rectangular region defined by 0  x  a, 0  t  T, 
where T is some specified value of time. Over this region we place a rectangular grid consisting 
of vertical lines h units apart and horizontal lines k units apart. See FIGURE 16.2.1. If we choose 
two positive integers n and m and define
h  a
n and k  T
m
 ,
then the vertical and horizontal grid lines are defined by
 
xi  ih, i  0, 1, 2, …, n and tj  jk, j  0, 1, 2, …, m.
As illustrated in FIGURE 16.2.2, the plan here is to use formula (3) to estimate the values of 
the solution u(x, t) at the points on the (  j  1)st time line using only values from the jth time 
line. For example, the values on the first time line (  j  1) depend on the initial condition 
ui, 0  u(xi, 0)  f (xi) given on the zeroth time line (  j  0). This kind of numerical procedure is 
called an explicit finite difference method.

EXAMPLE 1 
Using the Finite Difference Method
Consider the boundary-value problem
02u
0x
 2  0u
0t , 0 , x , 1, 0 , t , 0.5
 
u(0, t)  0, u(1, t)  0, 0  t  0.5
 
u(x, 0)  sin px, 0  x  1.
First we identify c  1, a  1, and T  0.5. If we choose, say, n  5 and m  50, then 
h  1
5  0.2, k  0.5
50   0.01, l  0.25, 
 
xi  i 1
5, i  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and tj  j 1
100, j  0, 1, 2, …, 50.
Thus (3) becomes
 
ui, j1  0.25(ui1, j  2uij  ui1, j).
By setting j  0 in this formula, we get a formula for the approximations to the temperature 
u on the first time line:
 
ui, 1  0.25(ui1, 0  2ui, 0  ui1, 0 ).
If we then let i  1, …,  4 in the last equation, we obtain, in turn, 
 
u11  0.25(u20  2u10  u00)
 
u21  0.25(u30  2u20  u10)
 
u31  0.25(u40  2u30  u20)
 
u41  0.25(u50  2u40  u30).
The first equation in this list is interpreted as
 
u11  0.25(u(x2, 0)  2u(x1, 0)  u(0, 0))
 
    0.25(u(0.4, 0)  2u(0.2, 0)  u(0, 0)).
From the initial condition u(x, 0)  sin px, the last line becomes
 
u11  0.25(0.951056516  2(0.587785252)  0)  0.531656755.
This number represents an approximation to the temperature u(0.2, 0.01).

You should verify, using the methods of Chapter 13, that an exact solution of the boundary-
value problem in Example 1 is given by u(x, t)  ep2t sin px. Using this solution, we compare 
in Table 16.2.2 a sample of exact values with their corresponding approximations.
 Stability These approximations are comparable to the exact values and accurate enough 
for some purposes. But there is a problem with the foregoing method. Recall that a numerical 
method is unstable if round-off errors or any other errors grow too rapidly as the computa-
tions proceed. The numerical procedure in Example 1 can exhibit this kind of behavior. It can 
be proved that the procedure is stable if l is less than or equal to 0.5, but unstable otherwise. 
To obtain l  0.25  0.5 in Example 1, we had to choose the value k  0.01; the necessity 
of using very small step sizes in the time direction is the principal fault of this method. You 
are urged to work Problem 12 in Exercises 16.2 and witness the predictable instability when 
l  1.
 Crank–Nicholson Method There are implicit finite difference methods for solving 
parabolic partial differential equations. These methods require that we solve a system of equa-
tions to determine the approximate values of u on the (   j  1)st time line. However, implicit 
methods do not suffer from instability problems.
The algorithm introduced by J. Crank and P. Nicholson in 1947 is used mostly for solving the 
heat equation. The algorithm consists of replacing the second partial derivative in c 02u

by an average of two central difference quotients, one evaluated at t and the other at t  k:

If we again define l  ck/h2, then after rearranging terms we can write (4) as

For each choice of j, the difference equation (5) for i  1, 2, …,  n  1 gives n  1 equations 
in n  1 unknowns ui, j1. Because of the prescribed boundary con ditions, the values of ui, j1 
are known for i  0 and for i  n. For example, in the case n  4, the system of equations for 
determining the approximate values of u on the ( j  1)st time line is

16.3 Wave Equation
INTRODUCTION In this section we approximate a solution of the one-dimensional wave 
equation using the finite difference method used in the preceding two sections. The one- dimensional 
wave equation is the prototype hyperbolic partial differential equation.
 Difference Equation Replacement Suppose u(x, t) represents a solution of the 
one-dimensional wave equation

we replace equation (1) by 
 
c2
h2 [u(x  h, t)  2u(x, t)  u(x  h, t)]  1
k2 [u(x, t  k)  2u(x, t)  u(x, t  k)]. 
(2)
We solve (2) for u(x, t  k), which is ui, j1. If l  ck/h, then (2) yields
 
 ui, j1  l2ui1, j  2(1  l2)uij  l2ui1, j  ui, j1 
(3)
for i  1, 2, …,  n  1 and j  1, 2, …,  m  1.
In the case when the wave equation (1) is a model for the vertical displacements u(x, t) of a vi-
brating string, typical boundary conditions are u(0, t)  0, u(a, t)  0, t 	 0, and initial conditions 
are u(x, 0)  f (x), u/t |t0  g(x), 0  x  a. The functions f and g can be interpreted as the initial 
position and the initial velocity of the string. The numerical method based on equation (3), like the first 
method considered in Section 16.2, is an explicit finite difference method. As before, we use the 
difference equation (3) to approximate the solution u(x, t) of (1), using the boundary and initial 
conditions, over a rectangular region in the xt-plane defined by the inequalities 0  x  a, 0  t  T, 
where T is some specified value of time. If n and m are positive integers and
 
h  a
n   and   k  T
m, 
the vertical and horizontal grid lines on this region are defined by
 
xi  ih, i  0, 1, 2, …, n and tj  jk, j  0, 1, 2, …, m.
As shown in FIGURE 16.3.1, (3) enables us to obtain the approximation ui,  j1 on the (j  1)st time 
line from the values indicated on the jth and (  j  1)st time lines. Moreover, we use
 
u0, j  u(0, jk)  0, un, j  u(a, jk)  0 
and 
ui, 0  u(xi, 0)  f (xi). 
There is one minor problem in getting started. You can see from (3) that for j  1 we need to 
know the values of ui, 1 (that is, the estimates of u on the first time line) in order to find ui, 2. But 
from Figure 16.3.1, with j  0, we see that the values of ui, 1 on the first time line depend on the 
values of ui, 0 on the zeroth time line and on the values of ui, 1. To compute these latter values 
we make use of the initial-velocity condition ut(x, 0)  g(x). At t  0, it follows from (5) of 
Section 6.5 that
 
g(xi)  ut (xi, 0) < u(xi, k) 2 u(xi, k)

In order to make sense of the term u(xi, k)  ui, 1 in (4), we have to imagine u(x, t) extended 
backward in time. It follows from (4) that
u(xi, k) < u(xi, k) 2 2kg(xi).
This last result suggests that we define
 
ui, 1  ui, 1  2kg(xi) 
(5)
in the iteration of (3). By substituting (5) into (3) when j  0, we get the special case
ui, 1  l2

SOLUTION We make the identifications c  2, a  1, and T  1. With n  5 and m  20 
we get h  1
5  0.2, k  1
20  0.05, and l  0.5. Thus, with g(x)  0, equations (6) and (3) 
become, respectively, 
 
ui, 1  0.125(ui1, 0  ui1, 0)  0.75ui, 0 
(7)
 
ui, j1  0.25ui1, j  1.5uij  0.25ui1, j  ui, j1. 
(8)
For i  1, 2, 3, 4, equation (7) yields the following values for the ui, 1 on the first time line:
 
u11  0.125(u20  u00)  0.75u10  0.55972100
 
u21  0.125(u30  u10)  0.75u20  0.90564761
 
u31  0.125(u40  u20)  0.75u30  0.90564761 
(9)
 
   u41  0.125(u50  u30)  0.75u40  0.55972100.
Note that the results given in (9) were obtained from the initial condition u(x, 0)  sin px. 
For example, u20  sin(0.2p), and so on. Now j  1 in (8) gives
 
ui, 2  0.25ui1, 1  1.5ui, 1  0.25ui1, 1  ui, 0, 
and so for i  1, 2, 3, 4 we get
 
u12  0.25u21  1.5u11  0.25u01  u10
 
u22  0.25u31  1.5u21  0.25u11  u20
 
u32  0.25u41  1.5u31  0.25u21  u30
 
   u42  0.25u51  1.5u41  0.25u31  u40.
Using the boundary conditions, the initial conditions, and the data obtained in (9), we get 
from these equations the approximations for u on the second time line. These last results and 
an abbreviation of the remaining calculations are summarized in Table 16.3.1 on page 814.

TABLE 16.3.1  Explicit Difference Equation Approximation
with h  0.2, k  0.05, l  0.5
It is readily verified that the exact solution of the BVP in Example 1 is u(x, t)  sin px cos 2pt. 
With this function we can compare the exact results with the approximations. For example, 
some selected comparisons are given in Table 16.3.2. As you can see in the table, the approxima-
tions are in the same “ball park” as the exact values, but the accuracy is not particularly impressive. 
We can, however, obtain more accurate results. The accuracy of this algorithm varies with the 
choice of l. Of course, l is determined by the choice of the integers n and m, which in turn de-
termine the values of the step sizes h and k. It can be proved that the best accuracy is always 
obtained from this method when the ratio l  kc/h is equal to one—in other words, when the 
step in the time direction is k  h /c. For example, the choice n  8 and m  16 yields h  1
8, 
k  1
16, and l  1. The sample values listed in Table 16.3.3 clearly show the improved 
accuracy. 
 Stability We note in conclusion that this explicit finite difference method for the wave 
equation is stable when l  1 and unstable when l  1.

In elementary algebra courses 
you learned about the existence 
and some of the properties of 
complex numbers. But in courses 
such as calculus, it is likely that 
you did not even see a complex 
number. Introductory calculus is 
basically the study of functions 
of a real variable. In advanced 
courses, you may have seen 
complex numbers occasionally 
(see Sections 3.3, 8.8, and 10.2). 
However, in the next four 
chapters we are going to 
introduce you to complex 
analysis; that is, the study of 
functions of a complex variable. 
Although there are many 
similarities between complex 
analysis and real analysis, there 
are many interesting differences 
and some surprises.

17.1 
Complex Numbers
INTRODUCTION You have undoubtedly encountered complex numbers in your earlier 
courses in mathematics. When you first learned to solve a quadratic equation ax2  bx  c  0 
by the quadratic formula, you saw that the roots of the equation are not real, that is, complex, 
whenever the discriminant b2  4ac is negative. So, for example, simple equations such as 
x2  5  0 and x2  x  1  0 have no real solutions. For example, the roots of the last equation 
are 1
2  "3
2
 and 1
2  "3
2
. If it is assumed that "3  "3"1, then the roots 
are written 1
2  "3
2 "1 and 1
2 2 "3
2 "1.
 A Definition Two hundred years ago, around the time that complex numbers were gain-
ing some respectability in the mathematical community, the symbol i was originally used as a 
disguise for the embarrassing symbol "1. We now simply say that i is the imaginary unit 
and define it by the property i2  1. Using the imaginary unit, we build a general complex 
number out of two real numbers.
Note: The imaginary part of 
z  4  9i is 9, not 9i.
Definition 17.1.1 
Complex Number
A complex number is any number of the form z  a  ib where a and b are real numbers 
and i is the imaginary unit.
 Terminology The number i in Definition 17.1.1 is called the imaginary unit. The real 
number x in z  x  iy is called the real part of z; the real number y is called the imaginary 
part of z. The real and imaginary parts of a complex number z are abbreviated Re(z) and Im(z), 
respectively. For example, if z  4  9i, then Re(z)  4 and Im(z)  9. A real constant multiple 
of the imaginary unit is called a pure imaginary number. For example, z  6i is a pure imaginary 
number. Two complex numbers are equal if their real and imaginary parts are equal. Since this 
simple concept is sometimes useful, we formalize the last statement in the next definition.
Definition 17.1.2 
Equality
Complex numbers z1  x1  iy1 and z2  x2  iy2 are equal, z1  z2, if 
Re(z1)  Re(z2) and Im(z1)  Im(z2).
A complex number x  iy  0 if x  0 and y  0.
 Arithmetic Operations Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and 
divided. If z1  x1  iy1 and z2  x2  iy2, these operations are defined as follows.
 
Addition: 
z1  z2  (x1  iy1)  (x2  iy2)  (x1  x2)  i( y1  y2)
 
Subtraction: 
z1  z2  (x1  iy1)  (x2  iy2)  (x1  x2)  i( y1  y2)
 
Multiplication: 
z1z2  (x1  iy1)(x2  iy2)
 
 
 x1x2  y1 y2  i( y1x2  x1 y2)

17.1 Complex Numbers

The familiar commutative, associative, and distributive laws hold for complex numbers.
 
Commutative laws: ez1  z2  z2  z1
z1z2  z2z1
 
Associative laws: 
ez1  (z2  z3)  (z1  z2)  z3
z1(z2z3)  (z1z2)z3
 
Distributive law: 
z1(z2  z3)  z1z2  z1z3
In view of these laws, there is no need to memorize the definitions of addition, subtraction, 
and multiplication. To add (subtract) two complex numbers, we simply add (subtract) the cor-
responding real and imaginary parts. To multiply two complex numbers, we use the distributive 
law and the fact that i 2  1.
EXAMPLE 1 
Addition and Multiplication
If z1  2  4i and z2  3  8i, find (a) z1  z2 and (b) z1z2.
SOLUTION (a)   By adding the real and imaginary parts of the two numbers, we get
 
(2  4i)  (3  8i)  (2  3)  (4  8)i  1  12i.
(b) Using the distributive law, we have
 
(2  4i)(3  8i)  (2  4i)(3)  (2  4i)(8i)
 
 6  12i  16i  32i 2
 
 (6  32)  (16  12)i  38  4i.
There is also no need to memorize the definition of division, but before discussing that we 
need to introduce another concept.
 Conjugate If z is a complex number, then the number obtained by changing the sign of 
its imaginary part is called the complex conjugate or, simply, the conjugate of z. If z  x  iy, 
then its conjugate is
 
z  x 2 iy.
For example, if z  6  3i, then z  6  3i; if z  5  i, then z  5  i. If z is a real number, 
say z  7, then z  7. From the definition of addition it can be readily shown that the conjugate 
of a sum of two complex numbers is the sum of the conjugates:
 
z1  z2  z1  z2.
Moreover, we have the additional three properties
 
z1 2 z2  z1 2 z2, 
z1z2  z1z2, 
az1
z2
b  z1
z2
.
The definitions of addition and multiplication show that the sum and product of a complex 
number z and its conjugate z are also real numbers:
 
z  z  (x  iy)  (x  iy)  2x 
(1)
 
zz  (x  iy)(x  iy)  x2  i2y2  x2  y2. 
(2)
The difference between a complex number z and its conjugate z is a pure imaginary number:
 
z  z  (x  iy)  (x  iy)  2iy. 
(3)
Since x  Re(z) and y  Im(z), (1) and (3) yield two useful formulas:
 
Re(z)  z  z
2   and  Im(z)  z 2 z
2i .

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
However, (2) is the important relationship that enables us to approach division in a more practical 
manner: To divide z1 by z2, we multiply both numerator and denominator of z1/z2 by the conjugate 
of z2. This procedure is illustrated in the next example.
EXAMPLE 2 
Division
If z1  2  3i and z2  4  6i, find (a) z1

by the conjugate of the denominator and then use (2).

 Geometric Interpretation A complex number z  x  iy is uniquely determined by an 
ordered pair of real numbers (x, y). The first and second entries of the ordered pairs correspond, 
in turn, with the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. For example, the ordered pair 
(2, 3) corresponds to the complex number z  2  3i. Conversely, z  2  3i determines the 
ordered pair (2, 3). In this manner we are able to associate a complex number z  x  iy with 
a point (x, y) in a coordinate plane. But, as we saw in Section 7.1, an ordered pair of real numbers 
can be interpreted as the components of a vector. Thus, a complex number z  x  iy can also 
be viewed as a vector whose initial point is the origin and whose terminal point is (x, y). The 
coordinate plane illustrated in FIGURE 17.1.1 is called the complex plane or simply the z-plane. The 
horizontal or x-axis is called the real axis and the vertical or y-axis is called the imaginary axis. 
The length of a vector z, or the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), is clearly "x
 2  y2. 
This real number is given a special name.
Definition 17.1.3 
Modulus or Absolute Value
The modulus or absolute value of z  x  iy, denoted by ZzZ, is the real number
ZzZ  "x
 2  y2  "z z. 
(4)
EXAMPLE 3 
Modulus of a Complex Number
If z  2  3i, then ZzZ  "22  (3)2  "13. 
As FIGURE 17.1.2 shows, the sum of the vectors z1 and z2 is the vector z1  z2. For the triangle 
given in the figure, we know that the length of the side of the triangle corresponding to the vector 
z1  z2 cannot be longer than the sum of the remaining two sides. In symbols this is
Zz1  z2Z  Zz1Z  Zz2Z. 
(5)
The result in (5) is known as the triangle inequality and extends to any finite sum:
Zz1  z2  z3  p  znZ  Zz1Z  Zz2Z  Zz3Z  p  ZznZ. 
(6)
Using (5) on z1  z2  (z2), we obtain another important inequality:
Zz1  z2Z  Zz1Z  Zz2Z.

REMARKS
Many of the properties of the real system hold in the complex number system, but there are 
some remarkable differences as well. For example, we cannot compare two complex numbers 
z1  x1  iy1, y1  0, and z2  x2  iy2, y2  0, by means of inequalities. In other words, state-
ments such as z1 	 z2 and z2  z1 have no meaning except in the case when the two numbers 
z1 and z2 are real. We can, however, compare the absolute values of two complex numbers. 
Thus, if z1  3  4i and z2  5  i, then |z1|  5 and |z2|  !26, and consequently |z1| 	 |z2|. 
This last inequality means that the point (3, 4) is closer to the origin than is the point (5, 1).

Powers and Roots
INTRODUCTION Recall from calculus that a point (x, y) in rectangular coordinates can also 
be expressed in terms of polar coordinates (r, u). We shall see in this section that the ability to 
express a complex number z in terms of r and u greatly facilitates finding powers and roots of z.
 Polar Form Rectangular coordinates (x, y) and polar coordinates (r, u) are related by the 
equations x  r cos u and y  r sin u (see Section 14.1). Thus a nonzero complex number 
z  x  iy can be written as z  (r cos u)  i(r sin u) or
 
z  r (cos u  i sin u).

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
We say that (1) is the polar form of the complex number z. We see from FIGURE 17.2.1 that the 
polar coordinate r can be interpreted as the distance from the origin to the point (x, y). In other 
words, we adopt the convention that r is never negative so that we can take r to be the modulus 
of z; that is, r  ZzZ. The angle u of inclination of the vector z measured in radians from the positive 
real axis is positive when measured counterclockwise and negative when measured clockwise. 
The angle u is called an argument of z and is written u  arg z. From Figure 17.2.1 we see that 
an argument of a complex number must satisfy the equation tan u  y/x. The solutions of this 
equation are not unique, since if u0 is an argument of z, then necessarily the angles u0 
 2p, 
u0 
 4p, . . ., are also arguments. The argument of a complex number in the interval p 	 u  p 
is called the principal argument of z and is denoted by Arg z. For example, Arg(i)  p/2.

A Complex Number in Polar Form
Express 1  "3i in polar form.
SOLUTION With x  1 and y  "3, we obtain r  ZzZ  #(1)2  ("3)2  2. Now since 
the point (1, "3) lies in the fourth quadrant, we can take the solution of tan u  "3/1  "3
to be u  arg z  5p/3. It follows from (1) that a polar form of the number is
z  2 acos 5p
3  i sin 5p
3 b.
As we see in FIGURE 17.2.2, the argument of 1  "3i that lies in the interval (p, p], the prin-
cipal argument of z, is Arg z  p/3. Thus, an alternative polar form of the complex number is
 
z  2ccos a p
3 b  i sin a  p
3 b d. 
 Multiplication and Division The polar form of a complex number is especially con-
venient to use when multiplying or dividing two complex numbers. Suppose
 
z1  r1(cos u1  i sin u1)  and  z2  r2(cos u2  i sin u2), 
where u1 and u2 are any arguments of z1 and z2, respectively. Then
 
z1z2  r1r2[(cos u1 cos u2  sin u1 sin u2)  i(sin u1 cos u2  cos u1 sin u2)] 
(2)
and for z2  0, 
 
z1
z2
 r1
r2
 [(cos u1 cos u2  sin u1 sin u2)  i(sin u1 cos u2  cos u1 sin u2)]. 
(3)
From the addition formulas from trigonometry, (2) and (3) can be rewritten, in turn, as
z1z2  r1r2 [cos(u1  u2)  i sin(u1  u2)] 
(4)
and 
z1

 [cos(u1  u2)  i sin(u1  u2)].

We have seen that Arg z1  p/2 for z1  i. In Example 1 we saw that Arg z2  p/3 for 
z2  1  "3i. Thus, for

In Example 2 we used the principal arguments of z1 and z2 and obtained arg(z1z2)  Arg(z1z2) and 
arg(z1/z2)  Arg(z1/z2). It should be observed, however, that this was a coincidence. Although (7) 
is true for any arguments of z1 and z2, it is not true, in general, that Arg(z1z2)  Arg z1  Arg z2 
and Arg(z1/z2)  Arg z1  Arg z2. See Problem 39 in Exercises 17.2.
 Integer Powers of z We can find integer powers of the complex number z from the 
results in (4) and (5). For example, if z  r (cos u  i sin u), then with z1  z and z2  z, (4) gives
 
z 2  r 2[cos (u  u)  i sin (u  u)]  r 2(cos 2u  i sin 2u).
Since z 3  z2z, it follows that
 
z3  r3(cos 3u  i sin 3u).
Moreover, since arg(1)  0, it follows from (5) that

z 2  z2  r2[cos(2u)  i sin(2u)].
Continuing in this manner, we obtain a formula for the nth power of z for any integer n:
 
z n  r n(cos nu  i sin nu).

 DeMoivre’s Formula When z  cos u  i sin u, we have ZzZ  r  1 and so (8) yields
 
(cos u  i sin u)n  cos nu  i sin nu.

This last result is known as DeMoivre’s formula and is useful in deriving certain trigonometric 
identities. See Problems 37 and 38 in Exercises 17.2.
 Roots A number w is said to be an nth root of a nonzero complex number z if w n  z . If 
we let w  r(cos f  i sin f) and z  r (cos u  i sin u) be the polar forms of w and z , then in 
view of (8) , w n  z becomes
 
rn(cos nf  i sin nf)  r (cos u  i sin u).
From this we conclude that rn  r or r  r1/n and
 
cos nf  i sin nf  cos u  i sin u.
By equating the real and imaginary parts, we get from this equation
 
cos nf  cos u    and    sin nf  sin u.

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
These equalities imply that nf  u  2kp, where k is an integer. Thus, 
f  u  2kp
n
.
As k takes on the successive integer values k  0, 1, 2, . . .,  n  1, we obtain n distinct roots with 
the same modulus but different arguments. But for k  n we obtain the same roots because the 
sine and cosine are 2p-periodic. To see this, suppose k  n  m, where m  0, 1, 2, . . . . Then
 
f  u  2(n  m)p

n

and so

We summarize this result. The n nth roots of a nonzero complex number z  r (cos u  i sin u) 
are given by

SOLUTION With r  1, u  arg z  p/2, the polar form of the given number is 
z  cos(p/2)  i sin(p/2). From (10) with n  3 we obtain

The root w of a complex number z obtained by using the principal argument of z with 
k  0 is sometimes called the principal nth root of z. In Example 4, since Arg(i)  p/2, 
w0  "3/2  (1/2)i is the principal third root of i.
Since the roots given by (8) have the same modulus, the n roots of a nonzero complex 
number z lie on a circle of radius r1/n centered at the origin in the complex plane. Moreover, 
since the difference between the arguments of any two successive roots is 2p/n, the nth roots 
of z are equally spaced on this circle. FIGURE 17.2.3 shows the three cube roots of i equally spaced 
on a unit circle; the angle between roots (vectors) wk and wk  1 is 2p/3.
As the next example will show, the roots of a complex number do not have to be “nice” 
numbers as in Example 3.

Sets in the Complex Plane
INTRODUCTION In the preceding sections we examined some rudiments of the algebra and 
geometry of complex numbers. But we have barely scratched the surface of the subject known 
as complex analysis; the main thrust of our study lies ahead. Our goal in the sections and chapters 
that follow is to examine functions of a single complex variable z  x  iy and the calculus of 
these functions.
Before introducing the notion of a function of a complex variable, we need to state some 
essential definitions and terminology about sets in the complex plane.
 Terminology Before discussing the concept of functions of a complex variable, we need 
to introduce some essential terminology about sets in the complex plane.
Suppose z0  x0  iy0. Since Zz  z0Z  "(x 2 x0)2  (
 y 2 y0)2 is the distance between the 
points z  x  iy and z0  x0  iy0, the points z  x  iy that satisfy the equation
Zz  z0Z  r,
r  0, lie on a circle of radius r centered at the point z0. See FIGURE 17.3.1.
EXAMPLE 1 
Circles
(a) ZzZ  1 is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.
(b) Zz  1  2iZ  5 is the equation of a circle of radius 5 centered at 1  2i.
The points z satisfying the inequality Zz  z0Z 	 r, r  0, lie within, but not on, a circle of 
radius r centered at the point z0. This set is called a neighborhood of z0 or an open disk. A 
point z0 is said to be an interior point of a set S of the complex plane if there exists some neigh-
borhood of z0 that lies entirely within S. If every point z of a set S is an interior point, then S is 
said to be an open set. See FIGURE 17.3.2. For example, the inequality Re(z)  1 defines a right 
half-plane, which is an open set. All complex numbers z  x  iy for which x  1 are in this 
set. If we choose, for example, z0  1.1  2i, then a neighborhood of z0 lying entirely in the set 
is defined by Zz  (1.1  2i)Z 	 0.05. See FIGURE 17.3.3. On the other hand, the set S of points in 
the complex plane defined by Re(z)  1 is not open, since every neighborhood of a point on the 
line x  1 must contain points in S and points not in S. See FIGURE 17.3.4.

The set of numbers satisfying the inequality
 
r1 	 Zz  z0Z 	 r2, 
such as illustrated in Figure 17.3.5(d), is called an open annulus.
If every neighborhood of a point z0 contains at least one point that is in a set S and at least 
one point that is not in S, then z0 is said to be a boundary point of S. The boundary of a set S 
is the set of all boundary points of S. For the set of points defined by Re(z)  1, the points on 
the line x  1 are boundary points. The points on the  circle Zz  iZ  2 are boundary points for 
the disk Zz  iZ  2.
If any pair of points z1 and z2 in an open set S can be connected by a polygonal line that lies 
entirely in the set, then the open set S is said to be connected. See FIGURE 17.3.6. An open connected 
set is called a domain. All the open sets in Figure 17.3.5 are connected and so are domains. The 
set of numbers satisfying Re(z)  4 is an open set but is not connected, since it is not possible 
to join points on either side of the vertical line x  4 by a polygonal line without leaving the set 
(bear in mind that the points on x  4 are not in the set).
A region is a domain in the complex plane with all, some, or none of its boundary points. 
Since an open connected set does not contain any boundary points, it is automatically a region. 
A region containing all its boundary points is said to be closed. The disk defined by Zz  iZ  2 
is an example of a closed region and is referred to as a closed disk. A region may be neither open 
nor closed; the annular region defined by 1  Zz  5Z 	 3 contains only some of its boundary 
points and so is neither open nor closed.

REMARKS
Often in mathematics the same word is used in entirely different contexts. Do not confuse the 
concept of “domain” defined in this section with the concept of the “domain of a function.”

Functions of a Complex Variable
INTRODUCTION One of the most important concepts in mathematics is that of a function. You 
may recall from previous courses that a function is a certain kind of correspondence between two 
sets; more specifically: A function f from a set A to a set B is a rule of correspondence that assigns 
to each element in A one and only one element in B. If b is the element in the set B assigned to the 
element a in the set A by f, we say that b is the image of a and write b  f (a). The set A is called 
the domain of the function f (but is not necessarily a domain in the sense defined in Section 17.3). 
The set of all images in B is called the range of the function. For example, suppose the set A is a set 
of real numbers defined by 3  x 	 q and the function is given by f (x)  !x 2 3; then f (3)  0, 
f (4)  1, f (8)  !5, and so on. In other words, the range of f is the set given by 0  y 	 q. Since 
A is a set of real numbers, we say f is a function of a real variable x.
 Functions of a Complex Variable When the domain A in the foregoing definition 
of a function is a set of complex numbers z, we naturally say that f is a function of a complex 
variable z or a complex function for short. The image w of a complex number z will be some 
complex number u  iv; that is, 
 
w  f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y),  
(1)
where u and v are the real and imaginary parts of w and are real-valued functions. Inherent in the 
mathematical statement (1) is the fact that we cannot draw a graph of a complex function w  f (z) 
since a graph would require four axes in a four-dimensional coordinate system.
Some examples of functions of a complex variable are
 
f (z)  z2  4z,  
z any complex number
 
f (z) 
z
z 2  1, 
z 2 i and z 2 i
 
f (z)  z  Re(z),   
z any complex number.
Each of these functions can be expressed in form (1). For example, 
 
f (z)  z2  4z  (x  iy)2  4(x  iy)  (x2  y2  4x)  i(2xy  4y).
Thus, u(x, y)  x2  y2  4x, and v(x, y)  2xy  4y.
Although we cannot draw a graph, a complex function w  f (z) can be interpreted as a mapping 
or transformation from the z-plane to the w-plane. See FIGURE 17.4.1.

EXAMPLE 1 
Image of a Vertical Line
Find the image of the line Re(z)  1 under the mapping f (z)  z2.
SOLUTION For the function f (z)  z2 we have u(x, y)  x 2  y 2 and v(x, y)  2xy. Now, 
Re(z)  x and so by substituting x  1 into the functions u and v, we obtain u  1  y2 and 
v  2y. These are parametric equations of a curve in the w-plane. Substituting y  v/2 into 
the first equation eliminates the parameter y to give u  1  v 2/4. In other words, the image 
of the line in FIGURE 17.4.2(a) is the parabola shown in Figure 17.4.2(b).
We shall pursue the idea of f (z) as a mapping in greater detail in Chapter 20.
It should be noted that a complex function is completely determined by the real-valued 
functions u and v. This means a complex function w  f (z) can be defined by arbitrarily specifying 
u(x, y) and v(x, y), even though u  iv may not be obtainable through the familiar operations on the 
symbol z alone. For example, if u(x, y)  xy2 and v(x, y)  x2  4y3, then f (z)  xy2  i(x2  4y3) 
is a function of a complex variable. To compute, say, f (3  2i), we substitute x  3 and y  2 
into u and v to obtain f (3  2i)  12  23i.
 Complex Functions as Flows We also may interpret a complex function w  f (z) 
as a two-dimensional fluid flow by considering the complex number f (z) as a vector based 
at the point z. The vector f (z) specifies the speed and direction of the flow at a given point z. 
FIGURES 17.4.3 and 17.4.4 show the flows corresponding to the complex functions f1(z)  z and 
f2(z)  z 2, respectively.
If x(t)  iy(t) is a parametric representation for the path of a particle in the flow, the tangent 
vector T  x(t)  iy(t) must coincide with f (x(t)  iy(t)). When f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y), it 
 follows that the path of the particle must satisfy the system of differential equations
 
 dx
dt  u(x, y)
 
 dy
dt  v(x, y).
We call the family of solutions of this system the streamlines of the flow associated 
with f (z).
EXAMPLE 2 
Streamlines
Find the streamlines of the flows associated with the complex functions (a) f1(z)  z and 
(b) f2(z)  z2.
SOLUTION (a)   The streamlines corresponding to f1(z)  x  iy satisfy the system
 
 dx
dt  x
 
 dy
dt  y
and so x(t)  c1et and y(t)  c2et. By multiplying these two parametric equations, we see 
that the point x(t)  iy(t) lies on the hyperbola xy  c1c2.
(b) To find the streamlines corresponding to f2(z)  (x2  y2)  i 2xy, note that dx/dt  x2  y2, 
dy/dt  2xy, and so
 
dy
dx 
2xy
x
 2 2 y2.
This homogeneous differential equation has the solution x2  y2  c2 y, which represents a 
family of circles that have centers on the y-axis and pass through the origin.
 Limits and Continuity The definition of a limit of a complex function f (z) as z S z0 
has the same outward appearance as the limit in real variables.

In words, limzSz0 f (z)  L means that the points f (z) can be made arbitrarily close to the 
point L if we choose the point z sufficiently close to, but not equal to, the point z0. As shown in 
FIGURE 17.4.5, for each e-neighborhood of L (defined by Z f (z)  LZ 	 e) there is a d-neighborhood 
of z0 (defined by Zz  z0Z 	 d) so that the images of all points z  z0 in this neighborhood lie in 
the e-neighborhood of L.
The fundamental difference between this definition and the limit concept in real variables 
lies in the understanding of z S z0. For a function f of a single real variable x, limxSx0 f (x)  L 
means f (x) approaches L as x approaches x0 either from the right of x0 or from the left of 
x0 on the real number line. But since z and z0 are points in the complex plane, when we say 
that limzSz0 f (z) exists, we mean that f (z) approaches L as the point z approaches z0 from 
any direction.
The following theorem summarizes some properties of limits:
Definition 17.4.1 
Limit of a Function
Suppose the function f is defined in some neighborhood of z0, except possibly at z0 itself. Then 
f is said to possess a limit at z0, written
 
lim
zSz0

Definition 17.4.2 
Continuity at a Point
A function f is continuous at a point z0 if 
 
lim
zSz0
 f (z)  f (z0).
As a consequence of Theorem 17.4.1, it follows that if two functions f and g are continuous 
at a point z0, then their sum and product are continuous at z0. The quotient of the two functions 
is continuous at z0 provided g(z0)  0.
A function f defined by

where n is a nonnegative integer and the coefficients ai, i  0, 1, . . ., n, are complex constants, 
is called a polynomial of degree n. Although we shall not prove it, the limit result lim
zSz0
 z  z0 
indicates that the simple polynomial function f (z)  z is continuous everywhere—that is, on 
the entire z-plane. With this result in mind and with repeated applications of Theorem 17.4.1 (i) 
and (ii), it follows that a polynomial function (2) is continuous everywhere. A rational 
function
 
f (z)  g(z)

where g and h are polynomial functions, is continuous except at those points at which h(z) is zero.

17.4 Functions of a Complex Variable

 Derivative The derivative of a complex function is defined in terms of a limit. The symbol z
used in the following definition is the complex number x  iy.
Definition 17.4.3 
Derivative
Suppose the complex function f is defined in a neighborhood of a point z0. The  derivative of 
f at z0 is
f 9(z0)  lim
DzS0  f (z0  Dz) 2 f (z0)
Dz
 
(3)
provided this limit exists.
If the limit in (3) exists, the function f is said to be differentiable at z0. The derivative of a 
function w  f (z) is also written dw/dz.
As in real variables, differentiability implies continuity:
If f is differentiable at z0, then f is continuous at z0.
Moreover, the rules of differentiation are the same as in the calculus of real variables. If f and g
are differentiable at a point z, and c is a complex constant, then
 
Constant Rules: d
dz c  0,  d
dz cf (z)  c f 9(z) 
(4)
 
Sum Rule: 
d

(5)
 
Product Rule:

Chain Rule:

(8)
The usual Power Rule for differentiation of powers of z is also valid:

Using the Rules of Differentiation
Differentiate (a) f (z)  3z4  5z3  2z and (b) f (z) 

4z  1.
SOLUTION (a)   Using the Power Rule (9) along with the Sum Rule (5), we obtain
 
f (z)  3  4z3  5  3z2  2  12z3  15z2  2.

In order for a complex function f to be differentiable at a point z0, lim
DzS0  f (z0  Dz) 2 f (z0)

must approach the same complex number from any direction. Thus in the study of complex 
variables, to require the differentiability of a function is a greater demand than in real variables. 
If a complex function is made up, such as f (z)  x  4iy, there is a good chance that it is not 
differentiable.

A Function That Is Nowhere Differentiable
Show that the function f (z)  x  4iy is nowhere differentiable.

Now, if we let z S 0 along a line parallel to the x-axis, then y  0 and the value of (10) is 1. 
On the other hand, if we let z S 0 along a line parallel to the y-axis, then x  0 and the value 
of (10) is seen to be 4. Therefore, f (z)  x  4iy is not differentiable at any point z.
 Analytic Functions While the requirement of differentiability is a stringent demand, 
there is a class of functions that is of great importance whose members satisfy even more severe 
requirements. These functions are called analytic functions.
Definition 17.4.4 
Analyticity at a Point
A complex function w  f (z) is said to be analytic at a point z0 if f is differentiable at z0 and 
at every point in some neighborhood of z0.
A function f is analytic in a domain D if it is analytic at every point in D.
The student should read Definition 17.4.4 carefully. Analyticity at a point is a neighborhood 
property. Analyticity at a point is, therefore, not the same as differentiability at a point. It is left 
as an exercise to show that the function f (z)  ZzZ2 is differentiable at z  0 but is differentiable 
nowhere else. Hence, f (z)  ZzZ2 is nowhere analytic. In contrast, the simple polynomial f (z)  z 2 
is differentiable at every point z in the complex plane. Hence, f (z)  z 2 is analytic everywhere. 
A function that is analytic at every point z is said to be an entire function. Polynomial functions 
are differentiable at every point z and so are entire functions.
REMARKS
Recall from algebra that a number c is a zero of a polynomial function if and only if x  c 
is a factor of f (x). The same result holds in complex analysis. For example, since 
f (z)  z4  5z2  4  (z2  1)(z2  4), the zeros of f are i, i, 2i, and 2i. Hence, 
f (z)  (z  i)(z  i)(z  2i)(z  2i). Moreover, the quadratic formula is also valid. For 
example, using this formula, we can write
 
f (z)  z2  2z  2  (z  (1  i))(z  (1  i)) 
 
 (z  1  i)(z  1  i).

Cauchy–Riemann Equations
INTRODUCTION In the preceding section we saw that a function f of a complex variable z is 
analytic at a point z when f is differentiable at z and differentiable at every point in some neigh-
borhood of z. This requirement is more stringent than simply differentiability at a point because 
a complex function can be differentiable at a point z but yet be differentiable nowhere else. A 
function f is analytic in a domain D if f is differentiable at all points in D. We shall now develop 
a test for analyticity of a complex function f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y).
 A Necessary Condition for Analyticity In the next theorem we see that if a function 
f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is differentiable at a point z, then the functions u and v must satisfy a pair 
of equations that relate their first-order partial derivatives. This result is a necessary condition 
for analyticity.
Theorem 17.5.1 
Cauchy–Riemann Equations
Suppose f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is differentiable at a point z  x  iy. Then at z the first-order 
partial derivatives of u and v exist and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
PROOF: Since f (z) exists, we know that
f 9(z)  lim
DzS0 f (z  Dz) 2 f (z)
Dz
. 
(2)
By writing f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) and z  x  iy, we get from (2)
f 9(z)  lim
DzS0 u(x  Dx, y  Dy)  iv(x  Dx, y  Dy) 2 u(x, y) 2 iv(x, y)
Dx  iDy
. 
(3)
Since this limit exists, z can approach zero from any convenient direction. In particular, if 
z S 0 horizontally, then z  x and so (3) becomes
 
f 9(z)  lim
DxS0 u(x  Dx, y) 2 u(x, y)
Dx
 i lim
DxS0 v(x  Dx, y) 2 v(x, y)
Dx
. 
(4)
Since f (z) exists, the two limits in (4) exist. But by definition the limits in (4) are the first partial 
derivatives of u and v with respect to x. Thus, we have shown that
 
f 9(z)  0u
0x  i 0v
0x. 
(5)
Now if we let z S 0 vertically, then z  iy and (3) becomes
f 9(z)  lim
DyS0 u(x, y  Dy) 2 u(x, y)
iDy
 i lim
DyS0 v(x, y  Dy) 2 v(x, y)
iDy
 , 
(6)
which is the same as
f 9(z)  i 0u
0y  0v
0y. 
(7)
Equating the real and imaginary parts of (5) and (7) yields the pair of equations in (1).
If a complex function f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is analytic throughout a domain D, then the real 
functions u and v must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations (1) at every point in D.
EXAMPLE 1 
Using the Cauchy–Riemann Equations
The polynomial f (z)  z2  z is analytic for all z and f (z)  x2  y2  x  i(2xy  y). Thus, 
u(x, y)  x2  y2  x and v(x, y)  2xy  y. For any point (x, y), we see that the Cauchy–
Riemann equations are satisfied:
 
0u
0x  2x  1  0v
0y  and  0u
0y  2y   0v
0x.
EXAMPLE 2 
Using the Cauchy–Riemann Equations
Show that the function f (z)  (2x2  y)  i( y2  x) is not analytic at any point.
SOLUTION We identify u(x, y)  2x2  y and v(x, y)  y2  x. Now from
 0u
0x  4x  and  0v
0y  2y
 0u
0y  1x  and  0v
0x  1
we see that 0u/0y  0v/0x but that the equality 0u/0x  0v/0y is satisfied only on the line 
y  2x. However, for any point z on the line, there is no neighborhood or open disk about z in 
which f is differentiable. We conclude that f is nowhere analytic.

17.5 Cauchy–Riemann Equations 
|
837
By themselves, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are not sufficient to ensure analyticity. 
However, when we add the condition of continuity to u and v and the four partial derivatives, 
the Cauchy–Riemann equations can be shown to imply analyticity. The proof is long and com-
plicated and so we state only the result.
Important.
Theorem 17.5.2 
Criterion for Analyticity
Suppose the real-valued functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) are continuous and have continuous 
first-order partial derivatives in a domain D. If u and v satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations 
at all points of D, then the complex function f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is analytic in D.
EXAMPLE 3 
Using Theorem 17.5.2
For the function f (z)  
x
x
 2  y2 2 i 
y
x
 2  y2 we have
0u
0x 
y2 2 x

(x
 2  y2)2  0v
0y  and  0u
0y  
2xy
(x
 2  y2)2  0v
0x.
In other words, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied except at the point where 
x2  y2  0; that is, at z  0. We conclude from Theorem 17.5.2 that f is analytic in any 
domain not containing the point z  0.
The results in (5) and (7) were obtained under the basic assumption that f was differentiable 
at the point z. In other words, (5) and (7) give us a formula for computing f (z):
 
f 9(z)  0u
0x  i 0v
0x  0v
0y 2 i 0u
0y. 
(8)
For example, we know that f (z)  z2 is differentiable for all z. With u(x, y)  x2  y2, 0u/0x  2x,
v(x, y)  2xy, and 0v/0x  2y, we see that
 
f (z)  2x  i2y  2(x  iy)  2z.
Recall that analyticity implies differentiability but not vice versa. Theorem 17.5.2 has an analogue 
that gives sufficient conditions for differentiability:
If the real-valued functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) are continuous and have continuous first-
order partial derivatives in a neighborhood of z, and if u and v satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann 
equations at the point z, then the complex function f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is differentiable 
at z and f (z) is given by (8).
The function f (z)  x2  y2i is nowhere analytic. With the identifications u(x, y)  x2 and 
v(x, y)  y2, we see from
 
0u
0x  2x,  0v
0y  2y  and  0u
0y  0,  0v
0x  0
that the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied only when y  x. But since the functions u, 
0u/0x, 0u/0y, v, 0v/0x, and 0v/0y are continuous at every point, it follows that f is differentiable on 
the line y  x and on that line (8) gives the derivative f (z)  2x  2y.
 Harmonic Functions We saw in Chapter 13 that Laplace’s equation 02u/0x2  02u/0y2  0 
occurs in certain problems involving steady-state temperatures. This partial differential equation 
also plays an important role in many areas of applied mathematics. Indeed, as we now see, the 
real and imaginary parts of an analytic function cannot be  chosen arbitrarily, since both u and v 
must satisfy Laplace’s equation. It is this link between analytic functions and Laplace’s equation 
that makes complex variables so essential in the serious study of applied mathematics.
Definition 17.5.1 
Harmonic Functions
A real-valued function f(x, y) that has continuous second-order partial derivatives in a domain D
and satisfies Laplace’s equation is said to be harmonic in D.

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
PROOF: In this proof we shall assume that u and v have continuous second-order partial 
 derivatives. Since f is analytic, the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied. Differentiating both 
sides of 0u/0x  0v/0y with respect to x and differentiating both sides of 0u/0y  0v/0x with respect 
to y then give
 
02u
0x
 2 
02v
0x 0y   and   02u
0y2   02v
0y 0x.
With the assumption of continuity, the mixed partials are equal. Hence, adding these two equa-
tions gives
 
02u
0x
 2  02u
0y2  0.
This shows that u(x, y) is harmonic.
Now differentiating both sides of 0u/0x  0v/0y with respect to y and differentiating both sides 
of 0u/0y  0v/0x with respect to x and subtracting yield
 
02v
0x
 2  02v
0y2  0.
 Harmonic Conjugate Functions If f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is analytic in a domain D, 
then u and v are harmonic in D. Now suppose u(x, y) is a given function that is harmonic in D. 
It is then sometimes possible to find another function v(x, y) that is harmonic in D so that 
u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is an analytic function in D. The function v is called a harmonic conjugate 
function of u.
Theorem 17.5.3 
A Source of Harmonic Functions
Suppose f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is analytic in a domain D. Then the functions u(x, y) and 
v(x, y) are harmonic functions.
We will see in Chapter 18 that 
an analytic function possesses 
derivatives of all orders.
EXAMPLE 4 
Harmonic Function/Harmonic Conjugate Function
(a) Verify that the function u(x, y)  x3  3xy2  5y is harmonic in the entire complex plane.
(b) Find the harmonic conjugate function of u.
SOLUTION (a)   From the partial derivatives
 
   
0u
0x  3x
 2 2 3y2,  02u
0x
 2  6x, 0u
0y  6xy 2 5,  02u
0y2  6x
we see that u satisfies Laplace’s equation:
 
02u
0x
 2  02u
0y2  6x 2 6x  0.
(b) Since the harmonic conjugate function v must satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations, 
we must have
 
0v
0y  0u
0x  3x
 2 2 3y2  and  0v
0x  0u
0y  6xy  5. 
(9)
Partial integration of the first equation in (9) with respect to y gives v(x, y)  3x2y  y3  h(x). 
From this we get
 
0v
0x  6xy  h9(x).
Substituting this result into the second equation in (9) gives h(x)  5, and so h(x)  5x  C. 
Therefore, the harmonic conjugate function of u is v(x, y)  3x2y  y3  5x  C. The analytic 
function is f (z)  x3  3xy2  5y  i(3x2y  y3  5x  C  ).

REMARKS
Suppose u and v are the harmonic functions that comprise the real and imaginary parts of an 
analytic function f (z). The level curves u(x, y)  c1 and v(x, y)  c2 defined by these functions 
form two orthogonal families of curves. See Problem 32 in Exercises 17.5. For example, the 
level curves generated by the simple analytic function f (z)  z  x  iy are x  c1 and y  c2. 
The family of vertical lines defined by x  c1 is clearly orthogonal to the family of horizontal 
lines defined by y  c2. In electrostatics, if u(x, y)  c1 defines the equipotential curves, then 
the other, and orthogonal, family v (x, y)  c2 defines the lines of force.
In Problems 1 and 2, the given function is analytic for all z.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
INTRODUCTION In this and the next section, we shall examine the exponential, logarithmic, 
trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions of a complex variable z. Although the definitions of 
these complex functions are motivated by their real variable analogues, the properties of these 
complex functions will yield some surprises.
 Exponential Function Recall that in real variables the exponential function f (x)  ex 
has the properties
 
f (x)  f (x) and f (x1  x2)  f (x1)f (x2).

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
We certainly want the definition of the complex function f (z)  ez, where z  x  iy, to reduce 
ex for y  0 and to possess the same properties as in (1).
We have already used an exponential function with a pure imaginary exponent. Euler’s 
formula, 
 
eiy  cos y  i sin y,  y a real number,  
(2)
played an important role in Section 3.3. We can formally establish the result in (2) by using the 
Maclaurin series for ex and replacing x by iy and rearranging terms:
 
 eiy  a

  cos y  i sin y.
For z  x  iy, it is natural to expect that
 
e xiy  e xe iy
and so by (2),  
e xiy  ex(cos y  i sin y).
Inspired by this formal result, we make the following definition.
Maclaurin series for 
cos y and sin y.
Definition 17.6.1 
Exponential Function
ez  e xiy  ex(cos y  i sin y). 
(3)
The exponential function ez is also denoted by the symbol exp z. Note that (3) reduces to ex when 
y  0.
EXAMPLE 1 
Complex Value of the Exponential Function
Evaluate e1.74.2i.
SOLUTION With the identifications x  1.7 and y  4.2 and the aid of a calculator, we have, 
to four rounded decimal places, 
 
e1.7 cos 4.2  2.6837  and  e1.7 sin 4.2  4.7710.
It follows from (3) that e1.74.2i  2.6837  4.7710i.
The real and imaginary parts of e z, u(x, y)  e x cos y and v(x, y)  e x sin y, are continuous 
and have continuous first partial derivatives at every point z of the complex plane. Moreover, the 
Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied at all points of the complex plane:
 
0u
0x  ex cos y  0v
0y  and  0u
0y  ex sin y  0v
0x.
It follows from Theorem 17.5.2 that f (z)  e z is analytic for all z; in other words, f is an entire 
function.
 Properties We shall now demonstrate that e z possesses the two desired properties given 
in (1). First, the derivative of f is given by (5) of Section 17.5:
 
f (z)  e x cos y  i(e x sin y)  e x(cos y  i sin y)  f (z).
As desired, we have established that
d
dz ez  ez.

Second, if z1  x1  iy1 and z2  x2  iy2, then by multiplication of complex numbers and the 
addition formulas of trigonometry, we obtain
 
   f (z1) f (z2)  ex1 (cos y1  i sin y1) ex 2  (cos y2  i sin y2)
 
  ex1x2 f( cos y1 cos y2 2
 sin y1 sin y2)  i ( sin y1 cos y2 
 cos y1 sin y2)g
 
  ex1x2 f( cos( y1  y2)  i sin( y1  y2)g  f (z1  z2).
In other words,  
ez1ez2  ez1z2. 
(4)
It is left as an exercise to prove that
 
ez1
ez2  ez12z2.
 Periodicity Unlike the real function ex, the complex function f (z)  ez is periodic with 
the complex period 2pi. Since e2pi  cos 2p  i sin 2p  1 and, in view of (4), ez2pi  eze2pi  ez 
for all z, it follows that f (z  2pi)  f (z). Because of this complex periodicity, all possible 
functional values of f (z)  ez are assumed in any infinite horizontal strip of width 2p. Thus, 
if we divide the complex plane into horizontal strips defined by (2n  1)p  y  (2n  1)p, 
n  0, 1, 2, . . ., then, as shown in FIGURE 17.6.1, for any point z in the strip p  y  p, the 
values f (z), f (z  2pi), f (z  2pi), f (z  4pi), and so on, are the same. The strip p  y  p 
is called the fundamental region for the exponential function f (z)  ez. The corresponding flow 
over the fundamental region is shown in FIGURE 17.6.2.
 Polar Form of a Complex Number In Section 17.2, we saw that the complex number z 
could be written in polar form as z  r (cos u  i sin u). Since eiu  cos u  i sin u, we can now 
write the polar form of a complex number as
 
z  reiu.
For example, in polar form z  1  i is z  "2epi>4.
 Circuits In applying mathematics, mathematicians and engineers often approach the same 
problem in completely different ways. Consider, for example, the solution of Example 10 in 
Section 3.8. In this example we used strictly real analysis to find the steady-state current ip(t) in 
an LRC-series circuit described by the differential equation
 
L d 2q
dt 2  R dq
dt  1
C
  q  E0 sin gt.
Electrical engineers often solve circuit problems such as this using complex analysis. To 
illustrate, let us first denote the imaginary unit !1 by the symbol j to avoid confusion with 
the current i. Since current i is related to charge q by i  dq/dt, the differential equation is the 
same as
 
L di
dt  Ri  1
C q  E0 sin gt.
Moreover, the impressed voltage E0 sin gt can be replaced by Im(E0e jgt ), where Im means the 
“imaginary part of.” Because of this last form, the method of undetermined coefficients suggests 
that we assume a solution in the form of a constant multiple of complex exponential—that is, 
ip(t)  Im(Ae  jgt ). We substitute this expression into the last differential equation, use the fact that 
q is an antiderivative of i, and equate coefficients of e  jgt:

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
The quantity Z  R  j(Lg  1/Cg) is called the complex impedance of the circuit. Note that the 
modulus of the complex impedance, ZZZ  "R2  (Lg 2 1>Cg)2, was denoted in Example 10 
of Section 3.8 by the letter Z and called the impedance.
Now, in polar form the complex impedance is
 
Z  ZZZe  ju  where  tan u  
Lg 2 1
Cg
R
.
Hence, A  E0  /Z  E0  /(ZZZe  ju), and so the steady-state current can be written as
 
ip(t)  Im E0
ZZZ
 e jue
  jgt.
The reader is encouraged to verify that this last expression is the same as (35) in Section 3.8.
 Logarithmic Function The logarithm of a complex number z  x  iy, z  0, is  defined 
as the inverse of the exponential function—that is, 
 
w  ln z  if  z  ew. 
(5)
In (5) we note that ln z is not defined for z  0, since there is no value of w for which ew  0. To 
find the real and imaginary parts of ln z , we write w  u  iv and use (3) and (5):
 
x  iy  euiv  eu(cos v  i sin v)  eu cos v  ieu sin v.
The last equality implies x  eu cos v and y  eu sin v. We can solve these two equations for u 
and v. First, by squaring and adding the equations, we find
 
e2u  x2  y2  r 2  ZzZ2  and so  u  logeZzZ, 
where logeZzZ denotes the real natural logarithm of the modulus of z. Second, to solve for v, we 
divide the two equations to obtain
 
 tan v  y
x.
This last equation means that v is an argument of z; that is, v  u  arg z. But since there is 
no unique argument of a given complex number z  x  iy, if u is an argument of z, then so is 
u  2np, n  0, 
1, 
2, . . . .
Definition 17.6.2 
Logarithm of a Complex Number
For z  0, and u  arg z, 
ln z  loge|z|  i(u  2np),  n  0, 
1, 
2, . . . .

EXAMPLE 2 
Complex Values of the Logarithmic Function
Find the values of (a) ln(2), (b) ln i, and (c) ln(1  i).
SOLUTION (a)   With u  arg(2)  p and loge|2|  0.6932, we have from (6)
 
ln(2)  0.6932  i(p  2np).
As is clearly indicated in (6), there are infinitely many values of the logarithm of a 
complex number z. This should not be any great surprise since the exponential function 
is periodic.
In real calculus, logarithms of negative numbers are not defined. As the next example will 
show, this is not the case in complex calculus.

(b) With u  arg(i)  p/2 and loge|i|  loge 1  0, we have from (6)
ln i  iap
2  2npb.
In other words, ln i  pi/2, 3pi/2, 5pi/2, 7pi/2, and so on.
(c) With u  arg(1  i)  5p/4 and loge|1  i|  loge"2  0.3466, we have from (6)
 
ln(1  i)  0.3466  ia5p
4  2npb.
EXAMPLE 3 
Solving an Exponential Equation
Find all values of z such that ez  !3  i.
SOLUTION From (5), with the symbol w replaced by z, we have z  ln( !3  i). Now 
| !3  i |  2 and tan u  1/ !3 imply that arg( !3  i)  p/6, and so (6) gives
 
z  loge2  iap
6  2npb or z  0.6931  iap
6  2npb.
 Principal Value It is interesting to note that as a consequence of (6), the logarithm 
of a positive real number has many values. For example, in real calculus, loge5 has only one 
value: loge 5  1.6094, whereas in complex calculus, ln 5  1.6094  2npi. The value of ln 5 
corresponding to n  0 is the same as the real logarithm loge 5 and is called the principal value 
of ln 5. Recall that in Section 17.2 we stipulated that the principal argument of a complex number, 
written Arg z, lies in the interval (p, p]. In general, we define the principal value of ln z as 
that complex logarithm corresponding to n  0 and u  Arg z. To emphasize the principal value 
of the logarithm, we shall adopt the notation Ln z. In other words, 
 
Ln z  loge|z|  i Arg z. 
(7)
Since Arg z is unique, there is only one value of Ln z for each z  0.
EXAMPLE 4 
Principal Values
The principal values of the logarithms in Example 2 are as follows:
(a) Since Arg(2)  p, we need only set n  0 in the result given in part (a) of Example 2:
 
Ln(2)  0.6932  pi.
(b) Similarly, since Arg(i)  p/2, we set n  0 in the result in part (b) of Example 2 to 
obtain
 
Ln i  p
2 i.
(c) In part (c) of Example 2, arg(1  i)  5p/4 is not the principal argument of z  1  i. 
The argument of z that lies in the interval (p, p] is Arg(1  i)  3p/4. Hence, it follows 
from (7) that
 
Ln(1  i)  0.3466  3p
4  i.
Up to this point we have avoided the use of the word function for the obvious reason that 
ln z defined in (6) is not a function in the strictest interpretation of that word. Nonetheless, it is 
customary to write f (z)  ln z and to refer to f (z)  ln z by the seemingly contradictory phrase 
multiple-valued function. Although we shall not pursue the details, (6) can be interpreted as an 
infinite collection of logarithmic functions (standard meaning of the word). Each function in the 
collection is called a branch of ln z. The function f (z)  Ln z is then called the principal branch 
of ln z, or the principal logarithmic function. To minimize the confusion, we shall hereafter 
simply use the words logarithmic function when referring to either f (z)  ln z or f (z)  Ln z .

Some familiar properties of the logarithmic function hold in the complex case:
ln(z1z2)  ln z1  ln z2  and  lnaz1

b  ln z1  ln z2.

Equations (8) and (9) are to be interpreted in the sense that if values are assigned to two of the 
terms, then a correct value is assigned to the third term.

Properties of Logarithms
Suppose z1  1 and z2  1. Then if we take ln z1  2pi and ln z2  pi, we get

b  ln(1)  ln z1  ln z2  2pi  pi  pi.
Just as (7) of Section 17.2 was not valid when arg z was replaced with Arg z , so too (8) is 
not true, in general, when ln z is replaced by Ln z. See Problems 45 and 46 in Exercises 17.6.
 Analyticity The logarithmic function f (z)  Ln z is not continuous at z  0 since f (0) is 
not defined. Moreover, f (z)  Ln z is discontinuous at all points of the negative real axis. This 
is because the imaginary part of the function, v  Arg z, is discontinuous only at these points. 
To see this, suppose x0 is a point on the negative real axis. As z S x0 from the upper half-plane, 
Arg z S p, whereas if z S x0 from the lower half-plane, then Arg z S p. This means that 
f (z)  Ln z is not analytic on the nonpositive real axis. However, f (z)  Ln z is analytic throughout 
the domain D consisting of all the points in the complex plane except those on the nonpositive 
real axis. It is convenient to think of D as the complex plane from which the nonpositive real 
axis has been cut out. Since f (z)  Ln z is the principal branch of ln z, the nonpositive real axis 
is referred to as a branch cut for the function. See FIGURE 17.6.3. It is left as exercises to show 
that the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied throughout this cut plane and that the deriva-
tive of Ln z is given by
 
d
dz Ln z  1
z  
(9)
for all z in D.
FIGURE 17.6.4 shows w  Ln z as a flow. Note that the vector field is not continuous along the 
branch cut.
 Complex Powers Inspired by the identity x a  e a ln x in real variables, we can define com-
plex powers of a complex number. If a is a complex number and z  x  iy, then za is defined by
 
za  ea ln z, z  0. 
(10)
In general, za is multiple-valued since ln z is multiple-valued. However, in the special case when 
a  n, n  0, 1, 2, . . ., (10) is single-valued since there is only one value for z2, z3, z1, and 
so on. To see that this is so, suppose a  2 and z  reiu, where u is any argument of z. Then
 
e2 ln z  e2 (logeriu) e2 loger2iu e2 logere2iu  r 2eiueiu  (reiu  )(reiu  )  z2.
If we use Ln z in place of ln z, then (10) gives the principal value of z a.
EXAMPLE 6 
Complex Power
Find the value of i2i.
SOLUTION With z  i, arg z  p/2, and a  2i , it follows from (10) that
 
i2i  e2i[loge1i(p/22np)]  e(14n)p
where n  0, 1, 2, . . . . Inspection of the equation shows that i2i is real for every value of n. 
Since p/2 is the principal argument of z  i, we obtain the principal value of i2i for n  0. To 
four rounded decimal places, this principal value is i 2i  ep  0.0432.

Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions
INTRODUCTION In this section we define the complex trigonometric and hyperbolic func-
tions. Analogous to the complex functions ez and Ln z defined in the previous section, these 
functions will agree with their real counterparts for real values of z. In addition, we will show 
that the complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions have the same derivatives and satisfy 
many of the same identities as the real trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
 Trigonometric Functions If x is a real variable, then Euler’s formula gives
 
eix  cos x  i sin x and eix  cos x  i sin x.
By subtracting and then adding these equations, we see that the real functions sin x and cos x can 
be expressed as a combination of exponential functions:
 
 sin x  eix 2 eix
2i
,  cos x  eix  eix
2
 .

| CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
Using (1) as a model, we now define the sine and cosine of a complex variable:
Definition 17.7.1 
Trigonometric Sine and Cosine
For any complex number z  x  iy, 
 
sin z  eiz 2 eiz
2i
    and   cos z  eiz  eiz
2
 . 
(2)
As in trigonometry, we define four additional trigonometric functions in terms of sin z 
and cos z:
 
tan z  sin z
cos z, cot z 
1
tan z, sec z 
1
 cos z, csc z 
1
sin z. 
(3)
When y  0, each function in (2) and (3) reduces to its real counterpart.
 Analyticity Since the exponential functions eiz and eiz are entire functions, it follows 
that sin z and cos z are entire functions. Now, as we shall see shortly, sin z  0 only for the real 
numbers z  np, n an integer, and cos z  0 only for the real numbers z  (2n  1)p/2, n an 
integer. Thus, tan z and sec z are analytic except at the points z  (2n  1)p/2, and cot z and 
csc z are analytic except at the points z  np.
 Derivatives Since (d/dz)ez  ez, it follows from the Chain Rule that (d/dz)eiz  ieiz and 
(d /dz)eiz  ieiz. Hence, 
 
d
dz sin z  d
dz  eiz 2 eiz
2i
 eiz  eiz
2

 cos z.
In fact, it is readily shown that the forms of the derivatives of the complex trigonometric func-
tions are the same as the real functions. We summarize the results:
 
d
dz sin z 
 cos z 
d
dz cos z  sin z
 
d
dz tan z  sec2z  
d
dz cot z  csc2z 
(4)
 
d
dz sec z  sec z tan z  
d
dz csc z  csc z cot z.
 Identities The familiar trigonometric identities are also the same in the complex case:
 
sin(z)  sin z  cos(z)  cos z
 
cos2z  sin2z  1
 
sin(z1 
 z2)  sin z1 cos z2 
 cos z1 sin z2
 
cos(z1 
 z2)  cos z1 cos z2  sin z1 sin z2
 
sin 2z  2 sin z cos z   cos 2z  cos2z  sin2z.
 Zeros To find the zeros of sin z and cos z we need to express both functions in the form 
u  iv. Before proceeding, recall from calculus that if y is real, then the hyperbolic sine and 
hyperbolic cosine are defined in terms of the real exponential functions ey and ey:
 
  sinh y  ey 2 ey
2
    and   cosh y  ey  ey
2
. 
(5)
Now from Definition 17.7.1 and Euler’s formula we find, after simplifying, 
 
 sin z  ei(xiy) 2 ei(xiy)
2i
 sin x aey  ey
2
b  i cos x aey 2 ey
2
b.
Thus from (5) we have
 
sin z  sin x cosh y  i cos x sinh y. 
(6)

17.7 Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions

847
It is left as an exercise to show that
cos z  cos x cosh y  i sin x sinh y. 
(7)
From (6), (7), and cosh2y  1  sinh2y, we find
 
|sin z|2  sin2x  sinh2y 
(8)
and 
|cos z|2  cos2x  sinh2y. 
(9)
Now a complex number z is zero if and only if |z|2  0. Thus, if sin z  0, then from (8) we must 
have sin2x  sinh2y  0. This implies that sin x  0 and sinh y  0, and so x  np and y  0. 
Thus the only zeros of sin z are the real numbers z  np  0i  np, n  0, 
1, 
2, . . . . Similarly, 
it follows from (9) that cos z  0 only when z  (2n  1)p/2, n  0, 
1, 
2, . . . .
EXAMPLE 1 
Complex Value of the Sine Function
From (6) we have, with the aid of a calculator, 
 
sin(2  i)  sin 2 cosh 1  i cos 2 sinh 1  1.4031  0.4891i.
In ordinary trigonometry we are accustomed to the fact that |sin x|  1 and |cos x|  1. Inspection 
of (8) and (9) shows that these inequalities do not hold for the complex sine and cosine, since 
sinh y can range from q to q. In other words, it is perfectly feasible to have solutions for 
equations such as cos z  10.
EXAMPLE 2 
Solving a Trigonometric Equation
Solve the equation cos z  10.
SOLUTION From (2), cos z  10 is equivalent to (eiz  eiz)/2  10. Multiplying the last 
equation by eiz then gives the quadratic equation in eiz:
 
e2iz  20e iz  1  0.
From the quadratic formula we find eiz  10 
 3 !11. Thus, for n  0, 
1, 
2, … , we 
have iz  loge(10 
 3 !11)  2npi. Dividing by i and utilizing loge(10  3 !11)  
loge(10  3 "11), we can express the solutions of the given equation as z  2np 
 
i loge(10  3 "11).
 Hyperbolic Functions We define the complex hyperbolic sine and cosine in a manner 
analogous to the real definitions given in (5).
Definition 17.7.2 
Hyperbolic Sine and Cosine
For any complex number z  x  iy, 
sinh z  ez 2 ez
2
    and   cosh z  ez  ez
2
 . 
(10)
The hyperbolic tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions are defined in terms of 
sinh z and cosh z:
tanh z  sinh z
cosh z, coth z 
1
tanh z, sech z 
1
cosh z, csch z 
1
sinh z. 
(11)
The hyperbolic sine and cosine are entire functions, and the functions defined in (11) are ana-
lytic except at points where the denominators are zero. It is also easy to see from (10) that
d
dz sinh z  cosh z   and    d
dz cosh z  sinh z . 
(12)
It is interesting to observe that, in contrast to real calculus, the trigonometric and hyperbolic func-
tions are related in complex calculus. If we replace z by iz everywhere in (10) and compare the results 
with (2), we see that sinh(iz)  i sin z and cosh(iz)  cos z. These equations enable us to express 

848 
| CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
sin z and cos z in terms of sinh(iz) and cosh(iz), respectively. Similarly, by replacing z by iz in (2) we 
can express, in turn, sinh z and cosh z in terms of sin(iz) and cos(iz). We summarize the results:
 
      sin z  i sinh(iz), cos z  cosh(iz) 
(13)
 
sinh z  i sin(iz), cosh z  cos(iz). 
(14)
 Zeros The relationships given in (14) enable us to derive identities for the hyperbolic func-
tions utilizing results for the trigonometric functions. For example, to express sinh z in the form 
u  iv we write sinh z  i sin(iz) in the form sinh z  i sin(y  ix) and use (6):
 
sinh z  i [sin(y) cosh x  i cos(y) sinh x].
Since sin(y)  sin y and cos(y)  cos y, the foregoing expression simplifies to
 
sinh z  sinh x cos y  i cosh x sin y. 
(15)
Similarly,  
cosh z  cosh x cos y  i sinh x sin y. 
(16)
It also follows directly from (14) that the zeros of sinh z and cosh z are pure imaginary and are, 
respectively, 
 
z  npi and z  (2n  1) pi
2 ,  n  0, 
1, 
2, . . . .
 Periodicity Since sin x and cos x are 2p-periodic, we can easily demonstrate that sin z 
and cos z are also periodic with the same real period 2p. For example, from (6), note that
 
 sin(z  2p)  sin(x  2p  iy)
 
      sin(x  2p) cosh y  i cos(x  2p) sinh y
 
      sin x cosh y  i cos x sinh y;
that is, sin(z  2p)  sin z. In exactly the same manner, it follows from (7) that cos(z  2p)  cos z. 
In addition, the hyperbolic functions sinh z and cosh z have the imaginary period 2pi. This last 
result follows from either Definition 17.7.2 and the fact that ez is periodic with period 2pi, or 
from (15) and (16) and replacing z by z  2pi.

17.8 
Inverse Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions
INTRODUCTION As functions of a complex variable z, we have seen that both the trigonomet-
ric and hyperbolic functions are periodic. Consequently, these functions do not possess inverses 
that are functions in the strictest interpretation of that word. The inverses of these analytic functions 
are multiple-valued functions. As we did in Section 17.6, in the examination of the logarithmic 
function, we shall drop the adjective multiple-valued throughout the discussion that follows.
 Inverse Sine The inverse sine function, written as sin1z or arcsin z, is defined by
 
w  sin1z  if  z  sin w. 
(1)
The inverse sine can be expressed in terms of the logarithmic function. To see this we use (1) 
and the definition of the sine function:
eiw 2 eiw
2i
  z  or  e2iw  2izeiw  1  0.
From the last equation and the quadratic formula, we then obtain
 
eiw  iz  (1  z2)1/2. 
(2)
Note in (2) we did not use the customary symbolism 
 "1 2 z 2, since we know from Section 17.2 
that (1  z2)1/2 is two-valued. Solving (2) for w then gives
sin1z  i ln[iz  (1  z2)1/2]. 
(3)
Proceeding in a similar manner, we find the inverses of the cosine and tangent to be
cos1z  i ln[z  i(1  z2)1/2] 
(4)
tan1z  i
2 ln i  z
i 2 z
 . 
(5)
EXAMPLE 1 
Values of an Inverse Sine
Find all values of sin1 "5.
SOLUTION From (3) we have
 sin 1"5  i ln f "5i  (1 2 ("5 )2 )1>2g.
With (1  ( "5)2)1/2  (4)1/2  
2i, the preceding expression becomes
 
 sin1"5  i ln f("5 
 2)ig
  i cloge("5 
 2)  ap
2  2npbid , n  0, 
1, 
 2, . . . .
The foregoing result can be simplified a little by noting that loge("5  2)  loge(1/("5  2))  
loge("5  2). Thus for n  0, 
1, 
2, . . ., 
 
sin1"5  p
2  2np 
 i loge("5  2). 
(6)
To obtain particular values of, say, sin1z, we must choose a specific root of 1  z2 and a 
specific branch of the logarithm. For example, if we choose (1  ( "5)2)1/2  (4)1/2  2i and 
the principal branch of the logarithm, then (6) gives the single value
 
sin1"5  p
2 2 i loge("5  2).

CHAPTER 17 Functions of a Complex Variable
 Derivatives The derivatives of the three inverse trigonometric functions considered above 
can be found by implicit differentiation. To find the derivative of the inverse sine function 
w  sin1z, we begin by differentiating z  sin w:
 
d
dz z  d
dz sin w  gives  dw
dz 
1
cos w.
Using the trigonometric identity cos2w  sin2w  1 (see Problem 28 in Exercises 17.7) in the 
form cos w  (1  sin2w)1/2  (1  z2)1/2, we obtain
 
d
dz sin1z 
1
(1 2 z 2 )1>2. 
(7)
Similarly, we find that
 d
dz cos1z 
1
(1 2 z 2 )1>2 
(8)
 d
dz tan 1z 
1
1  z 2
 .
 
(9)
It should be noted that the square roots used in (7) and (8) must be consistent with the square 
roots used in (3) and (4).
EXAMPLE 2 
Evaluating a Derivative
Find the derivative of w  sin1z at z  "5.
SOLUTION In Example 1, if we use (1  ("5)2)1/2  (4)1/2  2i, then that same root must 
be used in (7). The value of the derivative consistent with this choice is given by
 
dw

 Inverse Hyperbolic Functions The inverse hyperbolic functions can also be expressed 
in terms of the logarithm. We summarize these results for the inverse hyperbolic sine, cosine, 
and tangent along with their derivatives:
 
 sinh1z  ln fz  (z 2  1)1>2g 
(10)
 
 cosh1z  ln fz  (z 2 2 1)1>2g

EXAMPLE 3 
Values of an Inverse Hyperbolic Cosine
Find all values of cosh1(1).
SOLUTION From (11) with z  1, we get
 
cosh1(1)  ln(1)  loge1  (p  2np)i.
Since loge1  0 we have for n  0,

cosh1(1)  (2n  1)pi.

To define an integral of a 
complex function f, we start with 
f defined along some curve C or 
contour in the complex plane. We 
will see in this chapter that the 
definition of a complex integral, 
its properties, and method of 
evaluation are quite similar to 
those of a real line integral in the 
plane (Section 9.8).

Contour Integrals
INTRODUCTION 
In Section 9.8 we saw that the definition of the definite integral e
b
a  f (x) dx 
starts with a real function y  f (x) that is defined on an interval [a, b] on the x-axis. Because a 
planar curve is the two-dimensional analogue of an interval, we then generalized the definition 
of the definite integral to integrals of real functions of two variables defined on a curve C in the 
Cartesian plane. We shall see in this section that a complex integral is defined in a manner that 
is quite similar to that of a line integral in the Cartesian plane. In case you have not studied 
Sections 9.8 and 9.9, a review of those sections is recommended.
 A Definition Integration in the complex plane is defined in a manner similar to that of a 
line integral in the plane. In other words, we shall be dealing with an integral of a complex func-
tion f (z) that is defined along a curve C in the complex plane. These curves are defined in terms 
of parametric equations x  x(t), y  y(t), a  t  b, where t is a real parameter. By using x(t) and 
y(t) as real and imaginary parts, we can also describe a curve C in the complex plane by means of 
a complex-valued function of a real variable t: z(t)  x(t)  iy(t), a  t  b. For example, x  cos t, 
y  sin t, 0  t  2p, describes a unit circle centered at the origin. This circle can also be described 
by z(t)  cos t  i sin t, or even more compactly by z(t)  eit, 0  t  2p. The same definitions 
of smooth curve, piecewise-smooth curve, closed curve, and simple closed curve given in Section 
9.8 carry over to this discussion. As before, we shall assume that the positive direction on C cor-
responds to increasing values of t. In complex variables, a piecewise-smooth curve C is also called 
a contour or path. An integral of f (z) on C is denoted by C f (z) dz or 
 
C f (z) dz if the contour C 
is closed; it is referred to as a contour integral or simply as a complex integral.
 1. Let f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) be defined at all points on a smooth curve C defined by x  x(t),

Definition 18.1.1 
Contour Integral
Let f be defined at points of a smooth curve C defined by x  x(t), y  y(t), a  t  b. The

The limit in (1) exists if f is continuous at all points on C and C is either smooth or piecewise 
smooth. Consequently we shall, hereafter, assume these conditions as a matter of course.
 Method of Evaluation We shall turn now to the question of evaluating a contour 
 integral. To facilitate the discussion, let us suppress the subscripts and write (1) in the 
abbreviated form

18.1 Contour Integrals

In other words, a contour integral C f (z) dz is a combination of two real-line integrals C u dx  v dy
and C v dx  u dy. Now, since x  x(t) and y  y(t), a  t  b, the right side of (2) is the 
same as 
 #
b
a
[u(x(t), y(t))x	(t)  v(x(t), y(t))y	(t)] dt  i #
b
a
[v(x(t), y(t))x	(t)  u(x(t), y(t))y	(t)] dt.
But if we use z(t)  x(t)  iy(t) to describe C, the last result is the same as b
a f (z(t))z	(t) dt 
when separated into two integrals. Thus we arrive at a practical means of evaluating a contour 
integral:
Theorem 18.1.1 
Evaluation of a Contour Integral
If f is continuous on a smooth curve C given by z(t)  x(t)  iy(t), a  t  b, then
 
#
C
   f (z) dz   #
b
a
 f (z(t)) z9(t) dt. 
(3)
If f is expressed in terms of the symbol z, then to evaluate f (z(t)) we simply replace the symbol 
z by z(t). If f is not expressed in terms of z, then to evaluate f (z(t)), we replace x and y wherever 
they appear by x(t) and y(t), respectively.
EXAMPLE 1 
Evaluating a Contour Integral

SOLUTION We write z(t)  3t  it 2 so that z	(t)  3  2it and f (z(t))  3t 1 it2  3t  it 2.

For some curves, the real variable x itself can be used as the parameter. For example, to evalu-
ate C (8x2  iy) dz on y  5x, 0  x  2, we write C (8x2  iy) dz  2
0 (8x2  5ix)(1  5i) dx 
and integrate in the usual manner.
 Properties The following properties of contour integrals are analogous to the properties 
of line integrals.

have special interpretations. The line integral in (6) is called the circulation around C and mea-
sures the tendency of the flow to rotate the curve C. See Section 9.8 for the derivation. The net 
flux across C is the difference between the rate at which fluid enters and the rate at which fluid 
leaves the region bounded by C. The net flux across C is given by the line integral in (7), and a 
nonzero value for 
  
C  f   N ds indicates the presence of sources or sinks for the fluid inside the

18.2 Cauchy–Goursat Theorem
INTRODUCTION 
In this section we shall concentrate on contour integrals where the contour 
C is a simple closed curve with a positive (counterclockwise) orientation. Specifically, we shall 
see that when f is analytic in a special kind of domain D, the value of the contour integral 
 
C f (z) dz 
is the same for any simple closed curve C that lies entirely within D. This theorem, called the 
Cauchy–Goursat theorem, is one of the fundamental results in complex analysis. Preliminary 
to discussing the Cauchy–Goursat theorem and some of its ramifications, we first need to distin-
guish two kinds of domains in the complex plane: simply connected and multiply connected.
 Simply and Multiply Connected Domains In the discussion that follows, we shall 
concentrate on contour integrals where the contour C is a simple closed curve with a positive 
(counterclockwise) orientation. Before doing this, we need to distinguish two kinds of domains. 
A domain D is said to be simply connected if every simple closed contour C lying entirely in D 
can be shrunk to a point without leaving D. In other words, in a simply connected domain, every 
simple closed contour C lying entirely within it encloses only points of the domain D. Expressed 
yet another way, a simply connected domain has no “holes” in it. The entire complex plane is an 
example of a simply connected domain. A domain that is not simply connected is called a multiply 
connected domain; that is, a multiply connected domain has “holes” in it. See FIGURE 18.2.1. As 
in Section 9.9, we call a domain with one “hole” doubly connected, a domain with two “holes” 
triply connected, and so on.
 Cauchy’s Theorem In 1825, the French mathematician Louis-Augustin Cauchy proved 
one of the most important theorems in complex analysis. Cauchy’s theorem says:
Suppose that a function f is analytic in a simply connected domain D and that f 	 is 
continuous in D. Then for every simple closed contour C in D, 
 
C f (z) dz  0. 
The proof of this theorem is an immediate consequence of Green’s theorem and the Cauchy–Riemann 
equations. Since f 	 is continuous throughout D, the real and imaginary parts of f (z)  u  iv and 
their first partial derivatives are continuous throughout D. By (2) of Section 18.1 we write 
 
C f (z) dz 
in terms of real-line integrals and use Green’s theorem on each line integral:

CHAPTER 18 Integration in the Complex Plane
Now since f  is analytic, the Cauchy–Riemann equations, u/x  v/y and u/y  v/x,
imply that the integrands in (1) are identically zero. Hence, we have C  f (z) dz  0.
In 1883, the French mathematician Edouard Goursat (1858–1936) proved Cauchy’s theorem 
without the assumption of continuity of f 	. The resulting modified version of Cauchy’s theorem 
is known as the Cauchy–Goursat theorem.
Theorem 18.2.1 
Cauchy–Goursat Theorem
Suppose a function f is analytic in a simply connected domain D. Then for every simple closed 
contour C in D, C  f (z) dz  0.
Since the interior of a simple closed contour is a simply connected domain, the Cauchy–Goursat 
theorem can be stated in the slightly more practical manner:
If f is analytic at all points within and on a simple closed contour C, then 
C f (z) dz   0. 
(2)
EXAMPLE 1 
Applying the Cauchy–Goursat Theorem
Evaluate  BC
ez dz, where C is the curve shown in FIGURE 18.2.2.
SOLUTION The function f (z)  ez is entire and C is a simple closed contour. It follows from 
the form of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem given in (2) that Cez dz  0.

Applying the Cauchy–Goursat Theorem
Evaluate  BC

  1.
SOLUTION The rational function f (z)  1/z2 is analytic everywhere except at z  0. But z  0 
is not a point interior to or on the contour C. Thus, from (2) we have Cdz/z2  0. 
EXAMPLE 3 
Applying the Cauchy–Goursat Theorem
Given the flow f (z)   cos z, compute the circulation around and net flux across C, where C
is the square with vertices z  1, z  i, z  1, and z  i.
SOLUTION We must compute 
 
C f (z) dz  C cos z dz and then take the real and imaginary 
parts of the integral to find the circulation and net flux, respectively. The function cos z is 
analytic everywhere, and so C f (z) dz  0 from (2). The circulation and net flux are therefore 
both 0. FIGURE 18.2.3 shows the flow f (z)   cos z and the contour C. 
 Cauchy–Goursat Theorem for Multiply Connected Domains If f is analytic in 
a multiply connected domain D, then we cannot conclude that C f (z) dz  0 for every simple 
closed contour C in D. To begin, suppose D is a doubly connected domain and C and C1 
are simple closed contours such that C1 surrounds the “hole” in the domain and is interior to C. 
See FIGURE 18.2.4(a). Suppose, also, that f is analytic on each contour and at each point interior 
to C but exterior to C1. When we introduce the cut AB shown in Figure 18.2.4(b), the region 
bounded by the curves is simply connected. Now the integral from A to B has the opposite value 
of the integral from B to A, and so from (2) we have C  f (z) dz  C1 f (z) dz  0 or
 
 BC
f (z) dz 
BC1
f (z) dz. 
(3)
The last result is sometimes called the principle of deformation of contours, since we can 
think of the contour C1 as a continuous deformation of the contour C. Under this deformation 
of contours, the value of the integral does not change. Thus, on a practical level, (3) allows us 
to evaluate an integral over a complicated simple closed contour by replacing that contour with 
one that is more convenient.

taking the radius of the circle to be r  1, we are guaranteed that C1 lies within C. In other words, 
C1 is the circle |z  i|  1, which can be parameterized by x  cos t, y  1  sin t, 0  t  2p, 
or equivalently by z  i  eit, 0  t  2p. From z  i  eit and dz  ieit dt we obtain

The result in Example 4 can be generalized. Using the principle of deformation of contours (3) 
and proceeding as in the example, we can show that if z0 is any constant complex number interior 
to any simple closed contour C, then

The fact that the integral in (4) is zero when n is an integer  1 follows only partially from 
the Cauchy–Goursat theorem. When n is zero or a negative integer, 1/(z  z0)n is a polynomial 
(for example, n  3, 1/(z  z0)3  (z  z0)3) and therefore entire. Theorem 18.2.1 then implies 
C dz/(z  z0)n  0. It is left as an exercise to show that the integral is still zero when n is a posi-
tive integer different from one. See Problem 22 in Exercises 18.2.

SOLUTION Since the denominator factors as z2  2z  3  (z  1)(z  3), the integrand 
fails to be analytic at z  1 and z  3. Of these two points, only z  1 lies within the contour 
C, which is a circle centered at z  2 of radius r  2. Now by partial fractions,

If C, C1, and C2 are the simple closed contours shown in FIGURE 18.2.6 and if f is analytic on each 
of the three contours as well as at each point interior to C but exterior to both C1 and C2, then by in-
troducing cuts, we get from Theorem 18.2.1 that C f (z) dz   C1 f (z) dz   C2 f (z) dz  0. Hence,

SOLUTION In this case the denominator of the integrand factors as z2  1  (z  i)(z  i). 
Consequently, the integrand 1/(z2  1) is not analytic at z  i and z  i. Both of these points 
lie within the contour C. Using partial fraction decomposition once more, we have

We now surround the points z  i and z  i by circular contours C1 and C2, respectively, 
that lie entirely within C. Specifically, the choice |z  i|  1
2 for C1 and |z  i|  1
2 for C2 will 
suffice. See FIGURE 18.2.7. From Theorem 18.2.2 we can then write

Because 1/(z  i) is analytic on C1 and at each point in its interior and because 1/(z  i) is 
analytic on C2 and at each point in its interior, it follows from (4) that the second and third

REMARKS
Throughout the foregoing discussion we assumed that C was a simple closed contour; in other 
words, C did not intersect itself. Although we shall not give the proof, it can be shown that the 
Cauchy–Goursat theorem is valid for any closed contour C in a simply connected domain D.
As shown in FIGURE 18.2.8, the contour C is closed but not simple. Nevertheless, if f is analytic 
in D, then C f (z) dz  0.

18.3 Independence of the Path
INTRODUCTION 
In real calculus when a function f possesses an elementary antiderivative, 
that is, a function F for which F	(x)  f (x), a definite integral can be evaluated by the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus:
 
#
b
a
f (x) dx  F(b)  F(a). 
(1)
Note that e
b
a f (x) dx depends only on the numbers a and b at the initial and terminal points of the 
interval of integration. In contrast, the value of a real-line integral C P dx  Q dy generally 
depends on the curve C. However, we saw in Section 9.9 that there exist line integrals whose 
value depends only on the initial point A and terminal point B of the curve C, and not on C 
itself. In this case we say that the line integral is independent of the path. These integrals can

CHAPTER 18 Integration in the Complex Plane
be evaluated by the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals (Theorem 9.9.1). It seems natural 
then to ask:
Is there a complex version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?
Can a contour integral eC f (z) dz be independent of the path?
In this section we will see that the answer to both of these questions is “yes.”
 A Definition As the next definition shows, the definition of path independence for a 
contour integral C f (z) dz is essentially the same as for a real-line integral C P dx  Q dy.
Definition 18.3.1 
Independence of the Path
Let z0 and z1 be points in a domain D. A contour integral C f (z) dz is said to be independent of the 
path if its value is the same for all contours C in D with an initial point z0 and a terminal point z1.
At the end of the preceding section we noted that the Cauchy–Goursat theorem also holds for 
closed contours, not just simple closed contours, in a simply connected domain D. Now suppose, 
as shown in FIGURE 18.3.1, that C and C1 are two contours in a simply connected domain D, both 
with initial point z0 and terminal point z1. Note that C and C1 form a closed contour. Thus, if 
f is analytic in D, it follows from the Cauchy–Goursat theorem that
 
#
C
 f (z) dz  #
2C1
 f (z) dz  0. 
(2)
But (2) is equivalent to
 
#
C
 f (z) dz  #
C1
 f (z) dz. 
(3)
The result in (3) is also an example of the principle of deformation of contours introduced in (3) 
of Section 18.2. We summarize the last result as a theorem.
Theorem 18.3.1 
Analyticity Implies Path Independence
If f is an analytic function in a simply connected domain D, then C f (z) dz is independent 
of the path C.
EXAMPLE 1 
Choosing a Different Path
Evaluate C 2z dz, where C is the contour with initial point z  1 and terminal point 
z  1  i shown in FIGURE 18.3.2.
SOLUTION Since the function f (z)  2z is entire, we can replace the path C by any convenient 
contour C1 joining z  1 and z  1  i. In particular, by choosing C1 to be the straight 
line segment x  1, 0  y  1, shown in red in Figure 18.3.2, we have z  1  iy,
dz  i dy. Therefore,

C1
 2z dz 5 22 #

 y dy 2 2i #

 dy 5 21 2 2i. 
A contour integral C f (z) dz that is independent of the path C is usually written 
e
z1
z0 f (z) dz, where z0 and z1 are the initial and terminal points of C. Hence in Example 1 we can 
write e
1i
1
 2z dz.
There is an easier way to evaluate the contour integral in Example 1, but before proceeding 
we need another definition.
Definition 18.3.2 
Antiderivative
Suppose f is continuous in a domain D. If there exists a function F such that F	(z)  f (z) for 
each z in D, then F is called an antiderivative of f.
FIGURE 18.3.1 If f is analytic in D,

For example, the function F(z)  cos z is an antiderivative of f (z)  sin z, since F(z)  sin z.
As in real calculus, the most general antiderivative, or indefinite integral, of a function f (z) is 
written  f (z) dz  F(z)  C, where F(z)  f (z) and C is some complex constant.
Since an antiderivative F of a function f has a derivative at each point in a domain D, it is 
necessarily analytic and hence continuous in D (recall that differentiability implies continuity).
We are now in a position to prove the complex analogue of (1).
Theorem 18.3.2 
 Fundamental Theorem for Contour Integrals
Suppose f is continuous in a domain D and F is an antiderivative of f in D. Then for any contour C
in D with initial point z0 and terminal point z1, 
 #
C
 f (z) dz  F(z1)        F(z0). 
(4)
PROOF: We will prove (4) in the case when C is a smooth curve defined by z  z(t), a  t  b. 
Using (3) of Section 18.1 and the fact that F(z)  f (z) for each z in D, we have
 
 #
C
f (z) dz  #

 f (z(t)) z9(t) dt  #

   F(z(b)) 2 F(z(a))  F(z1) 2 F(z0). 
EXAMPLE 2 
Using an Antiderivative
In Example 1 we saw that the integral C 2z dz, where C is shown in Figure 18.3.2, is independent 
of the path. Now since f (z)  2z is an entire function, it is continuous. Moreover, F(z)  z2 
is an antiderivative of f, since F(z)  2z. Hence by (4) we have

 (1  i)2 2 (1)2  1 2 2i. 
EXAMPLE 3 
Using an Antiderivative
Evaluate C cos z dz, where C is any contour with initial point z  0 and terminal point z  2  i.
SOLUTION F(z)  sin z is an antiderivative of f (z)  cos z, since F(z)  cos z. Therefore 
from (4) we have
 
#
C
 cos z dz  #
2i

cos z dz  sin zd
2i

 sin (2  i) 2 sin 0  sin (2  i).
If we desired a complex number of the form a  ib for an answer, we can use sin(2  i)  
1.4031  0.4891i (see Example 1 in Section 17.7). Hence, 
 
#
C
 cos z dz  1.4031  0.4891i. 
We can draw several immediate conclusions from Theorem 18.3.2. First, observe that if the 
contour C is closed, then z0  z1 and consequently
 
 BC
f (z) dz  0.

| CHAPTER 18 Integration in the Complex Plane
Next, since the value of C f (z) dz depends on only the points z0 and z1, this value is the same for 
any contour C in D connecting these points. In other words:
If a continuous function f has an antiderivative F in D, then eC f (z) dz is 
independent of the path.  
(6)
In addition we have the following sufficient condition for the existence of an antiderivative:
If f is continuous and eC f (z) dz is independent of the path in a domain D,
then f has an antiderivative everywhere in D. 
(7)
The last statement is important and deserves a proof. Assume that f is continuous, C f (z) dz 
is independent of the path in a domain D, and F is a function defined by F(z)  e
z
z0 f (s) ds where s 
denotes a complex variable, z0 is a fixed point in D, and z represents any point in D. We wish to 
show that F(z)  f (z); that is, F is an antiderivative of f in D. Now,

(8)
Because D is a domain we can choose z so that z  z is in D. Moreover, z and z  z can be 
joined by a straight segment lying in D, as shown in FIGURE 18.3.3. This is the contour we use in 
the last integral in (8). With z fixed, we can write*

From (8) and (9) it follows that
 
F(z  Dz) 2 F(z)

f f (s) 2 f (z)g ds.
Now f is continuous at the point z. This means that for any e  0 there exists a d  0 so that 
| f (s)  f (z)|  e whenever |s  z|  d. Consequently, if we choose  z so that | z|  d, we have

Hence, we have shown that

Dz
 f (z)   or   F9(z)  f (z).
If f is an analytic function in a simply connected domain D, it is necessarily continuous 
throughout D. This fact, when put together with the results in Theorem 18.3.1 and (7), leads to 
a theorem that states that an analytic function possesses an analytic antiderivative.
Theorem 18.3.3 
Existence of an Antiderivative
If f is analytic in a simply connected domain D, then f has an antiderivative in D; that is, there 
exists a function F such that F(z)  f (z) for all z in D.
In (9) of Section 17.6 we saw that 1/z is the derivative of Ln z. This means that under some circum-
stances Ln z is an antiderivative of 1/z. Care must be exercised in using this result. For example, suppose 
D is the entire complex plane without the origin. The function 1/z is analytic in this multiply

connected domain. If C is any simple closed contour containing the origin, it does not follow from 
(5) that C dz /z  0. In fact, from (4) of Section 18.2 with the identification z0  0, we see that
 BC
1
z  dz  2pi.
In this case, Ln z is not an antiderivative of 1/z in D, since Ln z is not analytic in D. Recall that Ln z
fails to be analytic on the nonpositive real axis (the branch cut off the principal branch of the logarithm).

18.4 Cauchy’s Integral Formulas
INTRODUCTION 
In the last two sections we saw the importance of the Cauchy–Goursat 
theorem in the evaluation of contour integrals. In this section we are going to examine several 
more consequences of the Cauchy–Goursat theorem. Unquestionably, the most significant of 
these is the following result:
The value of an analytic function f at any point z0 in a simply connected domain can 
be  represented by a contour integral.
After establishing this proposition we shall use it to further show that
An analytic function f in a simply connected domain possesses derivatives of all orders.
The ramifications of these two results alone will keep us busy not only for the remainder of this 
section but in the next chapter as well.
 First Formula We begin with the Cauchy integral formula. The idea in the next theorem 
is this: If f is analytic in a simply connected domain and z0 is any point D, then the quotient 
f (z)/(z  z0) is not analytic in D. As a consequence, the integral of f (z)/(z  z0) around a simple 
closed contour C that contains z0 is not necessarily zero but has, as we shall now see, the value 
2pi  f (z0). This remarkable result indicates that the values of an analytic function f at points inside 
a simple closed contour C are determined by the values of f on the contour C.
Theorem 18.4.1 
Cauchy’s Integral Formula
Let f be analytic in a simply connected domain D, and let C be a simple closed contour lying 
entirely within D. If z0 is any point within C, then
 
f (z0) 
1
2pi BC
f (z)
z 2 z0
 dz. 
(1)
PROOF: Let D be a simply connected domain, C a simple closed contour in D, and z0 an interior 
point of C. In addition, let C1 be a circle centered at z0 with radius small enough that it is interior to C. 
By the principle of deformation of contours, we can write
 
BC
f (z)
z 2 z0
 dz 
BC1
f (z)
z 2 z0
 dz.  
(2)

18.4 Cauchy’s Integral Formulas

We wish to show that the value of the integral on the right is 2pi  f (z0). To this end we add and 
subtract the constant f (z0) in the numerator:
 
 BC1
f (z)
z 2 z0
 dz 
BC1
f (z0) 2 f (z0)  f (z)
z 2 z0
 dz
 
  f (z0) BC1
dz
z 2 z0

BC1
f (z) 2 f (z0)
z 2 z0
 dz. 
(3)
Now from (4) of Section 18.2 we know that
BC1
dz
z 2 z0
 2pi.
Thus, (3) becomes
 
BC1
f(z)
z 2 z0
 dz  2pi f (z0) 
BC1
f (z) 2 f (z0)
z 2 z0
 dz.  
(4)
Since f is continuous at z0 for any arbitrarily small e  0, there exists a d  0 such that 
| f (z)  f (z0)|  e whenever |z  z0|  d. In particular, if we choose the circle C1 to be 
|z  z0|  d/2  d, then by the ML-inequality (Theorem 18.1.3) the absolute value of the inte-
gral on the right side of (4) satisfies
 
2  BC1
f (z) 2 f (z0)
z 2 z0
 dz 2 #
e
d>2 2p ad
2b  2pe.
In other words, the absolute value of the integral can be made arbitrarily small by taking the 
radius of the circle C1 to be sufficiently small. This can happen only if the integral is zero. The 
Cauchy integral formula (1) follows from (4) by dividing both sides by 2pi. 
The Cauchy integral formula (1) can be used to evaluate contour integrals. Since we often 
work problems without a simply connected domain explicitly defined, a more practical restate-
ment of Theorem 18.4.1 is
If f is analytic at all points within and on a simple closed contour C, and z0 is 
any point interior to C, then f (z0) 
1
2pi BC
f (z)
z 2 z0
 dz.

EXAMPLE 1 
Using Cauchy’s Integral Formula
Evaluate  BC
z 2 2 4z  4
z  i
 dz, where C is the circle |z|  2.
SOLUTION First, we identify f (z)  z2  4z  4 and z0  i as a point within the circle C.
Next, we observe that f is analytic at all points within and on the contour C. Thus by the Cauchy 
integral formula we obtain
 
 BC
z 2 2 4z  4
z  i
 dz  2pi f (i)  2pi(3  4i)  2p(4  3i). 
EXAMPLE 2 
Using Cauchy’s Integral Formula
Evaluate  BC

z 2  9  
dz, where C is the circle |z  2i|  4.
SOLUTION By factoring the denominator as z2  9  (z  3i)(z  3i), we see that 3i is the 
only point within the closed contour at which the integrand fails to be analytic. See FIGURE 18.4.1.

Now by writing
z
z2 1 9 5
   
z
z 1 3i
   
z 2 3i ,
we can identify f (z)  z/(z  3i). This function is analytic at all points within and on the 
contour C. From the Cauchy integral formula we then have
 
 BC

EXAMPLE 3 
Flux and Cauchy’s Integral Formula
The complex function f (z)  k/(z 2 z1), where k  a  ib and z1 are complex numbers, gives 
rise to a flow in the domain z  z1. If C is a simple closed contour containing z  z1 in its 
interior, then from the Cauchy integral formula we have
 BC
f (z) dz 
BC
a 2 ib
z 2 z1
 dz  2pi(a 2 ib).
Thus the circulation around C is 2pb and the net flux across C is 2pa. If z1 were in the exterior 
of C, both the circulation and net flux would be zero by Cauchy’s theorem.
Note that when k is real, the circulation around C is zero but the net flux across C
is 2pk. The complex number z1 is called a source for the flow when k  0 and a sink
when k  0. Vector fields corresponding to these two cases are shown in FIGURE 18.4.2(a)
and 18.4.2(b). 
 Second Formula We can now use Theorem 18.4.1 to prove that an analytic function 
possesses derivatives of all orders; that is, if f is analytic at a point z0, then f , f , f 	, and so on, 
are also analytic at z0. Moreover, the values of the derivatives f  (n)(z0), n  1, 2, 3, … , are given 
by a formula similar to (1).
Theorem 18.4.2 
Cauchy’s Integral Formula for Derivatives
Let f be analytic in a simply connected domain D, and let C be a simple closed contour lying 
entirely within D. If z0 is any point interior to C, then
f 
 (n)(z0)  n!
2pi BC
f (z)
(z 2 z0)n1 dz. 
(6)
PARTIAL PROOF: We will prove (6) only for the case n  1. The remainder of the proof can 
be completed using the principle of mathematical induction.
We begin with the definition of the derivative and (1):

(a) Source: k > 0
(b) Sink: k < 0

Before proceeding, let us set up some preliminaries. Since f is continuous on C, it is bounded; 
that is, there exists a real number M such that | f (z)|  M for all points z on C. In addition, 
let L be the length of C and let d denote the shortest distance between points on C and the point 
z0. Thus for all points z on C, we have
 
Zz 2 z0Z $ d   or   
1
Zz 2 z0Z2 # 1
d2.
Furthermore, if we choose |z|  d/2, then
 
Zz 2 z0 2 DzZ $ iz 2 z0Z 2 ZDzi $ d 2 ZDzZ $ d
2 and so 
1
Zz 2 z0 2 DzZ # 2

.
Because the last expression approaches zero as z S 0, we have shown that
f 9(z0)  lim
DzS0 f (z0  Dz) 2 f (z0)
Dz


2pi BC
f (z)
(z 2 z0)2 dz. 
If f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) is analytic at a point, then its derivatives of all orders exist at that 
point and are continuous. Consequently, from
   f 9 (z)  0u
0x  i 0v
0x  0v
0y 2 i 0u

   f 0 (z)  02u
0x
 2  i 02v
0x
 2 
02v
0y 0x 2 i 02u
0y 0x
we can conclude that the real functions u and v have continuous partial derivatives of all orders 
at a point of analyticity.
Like (1), (6) can sometimes be used to evaluate integrals.
EXAMPLE 4 
Using Cauchy’s Integral Formula for Derivatives
Evaluate  BC
z  1
z 4  4z 3  
dz, where C is the circle |z|  1.
SOLUTION Inspection of the integrand shows that it is not analytic at z  0 and z  4, but 
only z  0 lies within the closed contour. By writing the integrand as
 
z  1
z 4  4z 3 
 z  1
z  4
z 3
,
we can identify z0  0, n  2, and f (z)  (z  1)/(z  4). By the Quotient Rule, f (z)  
6/(z  4)3 and so by (6) we have

SOLUTION Although C is not a simple closed contour, we can think of it as the union of two

we are in a position to use both (1) and (6).
To evaluate I1, we identify z0  0 and f (z)  (z3  3)/(z  i)2. By (1) it follows that

To evaluate I2 we identify z0  i, n  1, f (z)  (z3  3)/z, and f 	(z)  (2z3  3)/z2. From (6) 
we obtain

Finally we get

z(z 2 i)2  dz  I1  I2  6pi  2p(2  3i)  4p(1  3i). 
 Liouville’s Theorem If we take the contour C to be the circle |z  z0|  r, it follows 
from (6) and the ML-inequality that

(7)
where M is a real number such that | f (z)|  M for all points z on C. The result in (7), called 
Cauchy’s inequality, is used to prove the next result.
Theorem 18.4.3 
Liouville’s Theorem
The only bounded entire functions are constants.
PROOF: Suppose f is an entire function and is bounded; that is, | f (z)|  M for all z. Then for 
any point z0, (7) gives | f 	(z0)|  M/r. By making r arbitrarily large, we can make | f 	(z0)| as 
small as we wish. This means f 	(z0)  0 for all points z0 in the complex plane. Hence f must 
be a constant. 
 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra Liouville’s theorem enables us to prove, in turn, 
a result that is learned in elementary algebra: 
If P(z) is a nonconstant polynomial, then the equation P(z)  0 has at least one root.

18.4
This result is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. To prove it, let us suppose that 
P(z)  0 for all z. This implies that the reciprocal of P, f (z)  1/P(z), is an entire function. Now 
since | f (z)| S 0 as |z| S q, the function f must be bounded for all finite z. It follows from 
Liouville’s theorem that f is a constant and therefore P is a constant. But this is a contradiction 
to our underlying assumption that P was not a constant polynomial. We conclude that there must 
exist at least one number z for which P(z)  0.

Cauchy’s integral formula for 
derivatives indicates that if a 
function f is analytic at a point 
z0, then it possesses derivatives 
of all orders at that point. As a 
consequence of this result, we 
will see that f can always be 
expanded in a power series at 
that point. On the other hand, if 
f fails to be  analytic at a point z0, 
then we may still be able to 
expand it in a  different kind of 
series known as a Laurent 
series. The notion of Laurent 
series leads to the concept of a 
residue, and this, in turn, leads 
to yet another way of evaluating 
complex integrals.

CHAPTER 19 Series and Residues
19.1 
Sequences and Series
INTRODUCTION Much of the theory of complex sequences and series is analogous to that 
encountered in real calculus. In this section we explore the definitions of convergence and diver-
gence for complex sequences and complex infinite series. In addition, we give some tests for 
convergence of infinite series. You are urged to pay special attention to what is said about 
geometric series since this type of series will be important in the later sections of this chapter.
 Sequences A sequence {zn} is a function whose domain is the set of positive integers; in 
other words, to each integer n  1, 2, 3, . . ., we assign a complex number zn. For example, the 
sequence { 1  in} is
 
1  i,  0,   1  i,  2,  1  i, . . . 
c     c     c   c    c 
(1)
 
n  1, n  2,  n  3, n  4, n  5, . . . .
If limn S  q zn  L we say the sequence {zn} is convergent. In other words, {zn}  converges to the 
number L if, for each positive number e, an N can be found such that |zn  L|  e whenever 
n  N. As shown in FIGURE 19.1.1, when a sequence {zn} converges to L, all but a finite number 
of the terms of the sequence are within every e-neighborhood of L. The sequence { 1  i n} il-
lustrated in (1) is divergent, since the general term zn  1  i n does not approach a fixed complex 
number as n S q. Indeed, the first four terms of this sequence repeat endlessly as n increases.

Theorem 19.1.1

A sequence {zn} converges to a complex number L if and only if Re(zn) converges to Re(L) 
and Im(zn) converges to Im(L).

Sn  z1  z2  z3  …  zn, 
converges. If Sn S L as n S q, we say that the sum of the series is L.

By multiplying Sn by z and subtracting this result from Sn, we obtain Sn  zSn  a  azn. Solving 
for Sn gives
 
Sn  a(1 2 z n)

Since zn S 0 as n S q, whenever |z|  1 we conclude from (4) that (2) converges to

CHAPTER 19 Series and Residues
An equivalent form of Theorem 19.1.2 is the familiar nth term test for divergence of an 
infinite series.
Theorem 19.1.3 
The nth Term Test for Divergence
If limn S   q zn  0, then the series g
q
k51 zk diverges.
Theorem 19.1.4 
Ratio Test
Suppose g
q
k51 zk is a series of nonzero complex terms such that
lim
nSq 2 zn1
zn
2  L. 
(9)
(i) If L  1, then the series converges absolutely.
(ii) If L  1 or L  q, then the series diverges.
(iii) If L  1, the test is inconclusive.
Theorem 19.1.5 
Root Test
Suppose g
q
k51 zk is a series of complex terms such that
lim
nSq"
n ZznZ  L. 
(10)
(i) If L  1, then the series converges absolutely.
(ii) If L  1 or L  q, then the series diverges.
(iii) If L  1, the test is inconclusive.
For example, the series g
q
k51 (k  5i)/k diverges since zn  (n  5i)/n S 1 as n S q. The 
geometric series (2) diverges when |z|  1, since, in this case, limn S   q |zn| does not exist.
Definition 19.1.1 
Absolute Convergence
An infinite series g
q
k51 zk is said be absolutely convergent if g
q
k51 ZzkZ converges.
EXAMPLE 4 
Absolute Convergence
The series g
q
k51 (ik/k2) is absolutely convergent since |i k/k2|  1/k2 and the real series 
g
q
k51 (1/k2) converges. Recall from calculus that a real series of the form g
q
k51 (1/k p) is called 
a p-series, p a real number, and converges for p  1 and diverges for p 	 1.
As in real calculus, 
Absolute convergence implies convergence.
Thus in Example 4, because the series
 
a
q
k51
 i
 k
k2 5 i 2 1
22 2 i

converges absolutely, it is also convergent.
The following two tests are the complex versions of the ratio and root tests that are encountered 
in calculus:
We are interested primarily in applying these tests to power series.

19.1 Sequences and Series

 Power Series The notion of a power series is important in the study of analytic functions. 
An infinite series of the form
a
q
k0
ak(z  z0)k  a0  a1(z  z0)  a2(z  z0)2  … ,  
(11)
where the coefficients ak are complex constants, is called a power series in z  z0. The power 
series (11) is said to be centered at z0, and the complex point z0 is referred to as the center of 
the series. In (11), it is also convenient to define (z  z0)0  1 even when z  z0.
 Circle of Convergence Every complex power series has radius of convergence R, where 
R is a real number. Analogous to the concept of an interval of convergence in real calculus, when 
0  R  q, a complex power series (11) has a circle of convergence defined by |z  z0|  R. 
The power series converges absolutely for all z satisfying |z  z0|  R and diverges for |z  z0|  R. 
See FIGURE 19.1.3. The radius R of convergence can be
 (i) 
zero (in which case (11) converges at only z  z0), 
 (ii) a finite number (in which case (11) converges at all interior points of the circle |z  z0|  R), or
 (iii) q (in which case (11) converges for all z).
A power series may converge at some, all, or none of the points on the actual circle of convergence.

Circle of Convergence
Consider the power series g

lim
nSq 4
 z n2
n  1
 z n1
n
4  lim
nSq 
n
n  1 ZzZ  ZzZ.
Thus the series converges absolutely for |z|  1. The circle of convergence is |z|  1 and the 
radius of convergence is R  1. Note that on the circle of convergence, the series does not 
converge absolutely, since the series of absolute values is the well-known divergent harmonic 
series g
q
k1 (1/k). Bear in mind this does not say, however, that the series diverges on the 
circle of convergence. In fact, at z  1, g
q
k1 ((1)k1/k) is the convergent alternating 
harmonic series. Indeed, it can be shown that the series converges at all points on the circle 
|z|  1 except at z  1.
It should be clear from Theorem 19.1.4 and Example 5 that for a power series g
q
k0 ak(z  z0)k, 
the limit (9) depends on only the coefficients ak. Thus, if
 
(i) 
lim
nSq 2 an1
an
2  L  0, the radius of convergence is R  1/L;
 
(ii) 
lim
nSq 2 an1
an
2  0, the radius of convergence is q;
 
(iii) lim
nSq 2 an1
an
2  q, the radius of convergence is R  0.
Similar remarks can be made for the root test (10) by utilizing limnSq"
n ZanZ.

INTRODUCTION The correspondence between a complex number z within the circle of 
convergence and the number to which the series g
q
k1ak(z 2 z0)k converges is single- valued. 
In this sense, a power series defines or represents a function f ; for a specified z within the 
circle of convergence, the number L to which the power series converges is defined to be the

value of f at z; that is, f (z)  L. In this section we present some important facts about the 
nature of this function f.
In the preceding section we saw that every power series has a radius of convergence R. 
Throughout the discussion in this section, we will assume that a power series g
q
k1ak(z 2 z0)k 
has either a positive or an infinite radius R of convergence. The next three theorems will give 
some important facts about the nature of a power series within its circle of convergence |z  z0|  R, 
R  0.

gence |z  z0|  R, R  0, for every contour C lying entirely within the circle of convergence.
Theorem 19.2.3 
Term-by-Term Differentiation
A power series g

k0 ak(z  z0)k can be differentiated term by term within its circle of 
convergence |z  z0|  R, R  0.

and so on. Each of the differentiated series has the same radius of convergence as the original 
series. Moreover, since the original power series represents a differentiable function f within its 
circle of convergence, we conclude that when R  0:
A power  series represents an analytic function within its circle of convergence.
There is a relationship between the coefficients ak and the derivatives of f. Evaluating 
(1), (2), (3), and (4) at z  z0 gives
 
f (z0)  a0, f

We have just seen that a power series with a nonzero radius of convergence represents an 
analytic function. On the other hand, if we are given a function f that is analytic in some domain D, 
can we represent it by a power series of the form (6) and (7)? Since a power series converges in 
a circular domain, and a domain D is generally not circular, the question becomes: Can we expand 
f in one or more power series that are valid in circular domains that are all contained in D? The 
question will be answered in the affirmative by the next theorem.
Theorem 19.2.4

valid for the largest circle C with center at z0 and radius R that lies entirely within D.
PROOF: Let z be a fixed point within the circle C and let s denote the variable of integration. The 
circle C is then described by |s  z0|  R. See FIGURE 19.2.1. To begin, we use the Cauchy integral 
formula to obtain the value of f at z:

Equation (11) is called Taylor’s formula with remainder Rn. We now wish to show that Rn(z) S 0 
as n S q. Since f is analytic in D, | f (z)| has a maximum value M on the contour C. In addition, 
since z is inside C, we have |z  z0|  R, and, consequently, 
 
|s  z|  |s  z0  (z  z0)|  |s  z0|  |z  z0|  R  d, 
where d  |z  z0| is the distance from z and z0. The ML-inequality then gives

Because d  R, (d/R)n S 0 as n S q, we conclude that |Rn(z)| S 0 as n S q. It follows that the 
infinite series
 
f (z0)  f 9(z0)
1!  (z 2 z0)  f 0(z0)
2!  (z 2 z0)2  p
converges to f (z). In other words, the result in (8) is valid for any point z interior to C.
We can find the radius of convergence of a Taylor series in exactly the same manner illustrated 
in Examples 5–7 of Section 19.1. However, we can simplify matters even further by noting that the 
radius of convergence is the distance from the center z0 of the series to the nearest isolated singularity 
of f. We shall elaborate more on this concept in the next section, but an isolated singularity is a point 
at which f fails to be analytic but is, nonetheless, analytic at all other points throughout some neigh-
borhood of the point. For example, z  5i is an isolated singularity of f (z)  1/(z  5i). If the function 
f is entire, then the radius of convergence of a Taylor series centered at any point z0 is necessarily 
infinite. Using (8) and the last fact, we can say that the Maclaurin series representations

If two power series with center z0:

bk(z 2 z0)k
represent the same function and have the same nonzero radius of convergence, then ak  bk , 
k  0, 1, 2, . . . . Stated in another way, the power series expansion of a function with center z0 is 
unique. On a practical level, this means that a power series expansion of an analytic function f 
centered at z0, irrespective of the method used to obtain it, is the Taylor series expansion of the 
function. For example, we can obtain (14) by simply differentiating (13) term by term. The 
Maclaurin series for ez2 can be obtained by replacing the symbol z in (12) by z2.

SOLUTION We could, of course, begin by computing the coefficients using (8). However, 
we know from (5) of Section 19.1 that for |z|  1, 
 
1
1 2 z  1  z  z2  z3  ….

Differentiating both sides of the last result with respect to z then yields

Since we are using Theorem 19.2.3, the radius of convergence of this last series is the same 
as the original series, R  1.

(1 2 z)2,   f 0(z) 
2 1
(1 2 z)3,   f -(z) 

(1 2 z)4,
we conclude that f  (n)(z)  n!/(1  z)n1 and so f  (n)(2i)  n!/(1  2i)n1. Thus from (8) we 
obtain the Taylor series
 
1
1 2 z  a
q
k0
 
1
(1 2 2i)k1 (z 2 2i)k. 
(16)
Since the distance from the center z0  2i to the nearest singularity z  1 is !5, we conclude 
that the circle of convergence for the power series in (16) is |z  2i|  !5. This can be veri-
fied by the ratio test of the preceding section.
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION In this solution we again use the geometric series (15). By adding 
and subtracting 2i in the denominator of 1/(1  z), we can write
 
1
1 2 z 

1 2 z  2i 2 2i 

1 2 2i 2 (z 2 2i) 

1 2  z 2 2i

We now write 
1
1 2  z 2 2i
1 2 2i
 as a power series by using (15) with the symbol z replaced 
by (z  2i)/(1  2i):

(1 2 2i)4 (z 2 2i)3  p.
The reader should verify that this last series is exactly the same as that in (16).
In (15) and (16) we represented the same function 1/(1  z) by two different power series. 
The first series
 
1
1 2 z  1  z  z2  z3  …
has center zero and radius of convergence one. The second series

lustrated in FIGURE 19.2.2. The interior of the intersection of the two circles (shaded) is the region 
where both series converge; in other words, at a specified point z* in this region, both series 
converge to the same value f (z*)  1/(1  z*). Outside the shaded  region, at least one of the two 
series must diverge.

19.3 Laurent Series
INTRODUCTION If a complex function f fails to be analytic at a point z  z0, then this point 
is said to be a singularity or a singular point of the function. For example, the complex numbers 
z  2i and z  2i are singularities of the function f (z)  z /(z2  4) because f is discontinuous 
at each of these points. Recall from Section 17.6 that the principal value of the logarithm, Ln z, 
is analytic at all points except those points on the branch cut consisting of the nonpositive x-axis; 
that is, the branch point z  0 as well as all negative real numbers are singular points of Ln z. In 
this section we will be concerned with a new kind of “power series” expansion of f about an 
isolated singularity z0. This new series will involve negative as well as nonnegative integer 
powers of z  z0.
 Isolated Singularities Suppose that z  z0 is a singularity of a complex function f. 
The point z  z0 is said to be an isolated singularity of the function f if there exists some deleted 
neighborhood, or punctured open disk, 0  | z  z0 |  R of z0 throughout which f is analytic. For 
example, we have just seen that z  2i and z  2i are singularities of f (z)  z /(z2  4). Both 
2i and 2i are isolated singularities since f is analytic at every point in the neighborhood defined 
by |z  2i|  1 except at z  2i and at every point in the neighborhood defined by | z  (2i)|  1 
except at z  2i. In other words, if f is analytic in the deleted neighborhood, 0  |z  2i|  1 

888

CHAPTER 19 Series and Residues
and 0  | z  2i |  1. On the other hand, the branch point z  0 is not an isolated singularity of 
Ln z since every neighborhood of z  0 must contain points on the negative x-axis. We say that 
a singular point z  z0 of a function f is nonisolated if every neighborhood of z0 contains at least 
one singularity of f other than z0. For example, the branch point z  0 is a nonisolated singular-
ity of Ln z since every neighborhood of z  0 contains points on the negative real axis.
 A New Kind of Series If z  z0 is a singularity of a function f, then certainly f cannot be 
expanded in a power series with z0 as its center. However, about an isolated singularity z  z0 it 
is possible to represent f by a new kind of series involving both negative and nonnegative integer 
powers of z  z0; that is, 
 
f (z)  …  
a2
(z 2 z0)2 
a1
z 2 z0
  a0  a1(z  z0)  a2(z  z0)2  ….
Using summation notation, the last expression can be written as the sum of two series
 
f (z)  a
q
k1
ak(z 2 z0)k  a
q
k0
ak(z 2 z0)k. 
(1)
The two series on the right-hand side in (1) are given special names. The part with negative 
powers of z  z0; that is, 
 
a
q
k1
ak(z 2 z0)k  a
q
k1
 
ak
(z 2 z0)k
is called the principal part of the series (1) and will converge for |1/(z  z0)|  r* or equivalently 
for |z  z0 |  1/r*  r. The part consisting of the nonnegative powers of z  z0, 
 
a
q
k0
ak(z 2 z0)k
is called the analytic part of the series (1) and will converge for |z  z0|  R. Hence, the sum of 
these parts converges when z both |z  z0|  r and |z  z0|  R; that is, when z is a point in an 
annular domain defined by r  |z  z0|  R.
By summing over negative and nonnegative integers, (1) can be written compactly as
 
f (z) 
a
q
kq
ak(z 2 z0)k.
The next example illustrates a series of the form (1) in which the principal part of the series 
consists of a finite number of nonzero terms, but the analytic part consists of an infinite number 
of nonzero terms.
EXAMPLE 1 
A New Kind of Series
The function f (z)  (sin z)/z3 is not analytic at z  0 and hence cannot be expanded in a 
Maclaurin series. However, sin z is an entire function, and from (13) of Section 19.2 we know 
that its Maclaurin series, 
sin z  z 2 z 3
3!  z 5
5! 2 z 7
7!  p,
converges for all z. Dividing this power series by z3 gives the following series with negative 
and nonnegative integer powers of z:
f (z)  sin z
z 3
 1
z 2 2 1
3!  z 2
5! 2 z 4
7!  p. 
(2)
This series converges for all z except z  0; that is, for 0  |z|.
A series representation of a function f that has the form given in (1), and (2) is such an example, 
is called a Laurent series or a Laurent expansion of f.

PROOF: Let C1 and C2 be concentric circles with center z0 and radii r1 and R2, where 
r  r1  R2  R. Let z be a fixed point in D that also satisfies r1  |z  z0|  R2. See FIGURE 19.3.2.

where, in view of (3) of Section 18.2, we have replaced the contours C1 and C2 by any simple 
closed contour C in D with z0 in its interior.
In the case when ak  0 for k  1, 2, 3, . . ., the Laurent series (3) is a Taylor  series. Because 
of this, a Laurent expansion is a generalization of a Taylor series.
The annular domain in Theorem 19.3.1 defined by r  |z  z0|  R need not have the “ring” 
shape illustrated in Figure 19.3.2. Some other possible annular domains are (i) r  0, R finite; 
(ii) r  0, R S q; and (iii) r  0, R S q. In the first case, the  series converges in the annular 
domain defined by 0  |z  z0|  R. This is the interior of the circle |z  z0|  R except the 
point z0. In the second case, the annular domain is defined by r  |z  z0|; in other words, the 
domain consists of all points exterior to the circle |z  z0|  r. In the third case, the domain is 
defined by 0  |z  z0|. This represents the entire complex plane except the point z0. The series 
we obtained in (2) is valid on this last type of domain.
In actual practice, the formula in (4) for the coefficients of a Laurent series is seldom used. As 
a consequence, finding the Laurent series of a function in a specified annular domain is generally 
not an easy task. We often use the geometric series (5) and (6) of Section 19.1 or, as we did in 
Example 1, other known series. But regardless of how a Laurent expansion of a function f is obtained 
in a specified annular domain, it is the Laurent series; that is, the series we obtain is unique.

and (d) 1  |z  1|.
SOLUTION The four specified annular domains are shown in FIGURE 19.3.3. In parts (a) and (b), 
we want to represent f in a series involving only negative and nonnegative integer powers of z, 
whereas in parts (c) and (d) we want to represent f in a series involving negative and nonnegative 
integer powers of z  1.
(a) By writing

the resulting series

(b) To obtain a series that converges for 1  |z| we start by constructing a series that converges 
for |1/z|  1. To this end we write the given function f as
 
f (z)  1
z 2 
1
1 2 1
z
and again use (5) of Section 19.1 with z replaced by 1/z:
f (z)  1
z 2 c1  1
z  1
z 2  1
z 3  pd .
The series in the brackets converges for |1/z|  1 or equivalently for 1  |z|. Thus the required 
Laurent series is
 
f (z)  1
z 2  1
z 3  1
z 4  1
z 5  p.
(c) This is basically the same problem as part (a) except that we want all powers of z  1. To 
that end we add and subtract 1 in the denominator and use (6) of Section 19.1 with z replaced 
by z  1:
 f (z) 
1
(1 2 1  z) (z 2 1)

 
1
z 2 1
 2 1  (z 2 1) 2 (z 2 1)2  p.
The series in brackets converges for |z  1|  1, and so the last series converges for 
0  |z  1|  1.
(d) Proceeding as in part (b), we write
 
 f (z) 

(z 2 1)3 
1
(z 2 1)4 2

(z 2 1)5  p.
Because the series within the brackets converges for |1/(z  1)|  1, the final series converges 
for 1  |z  1|.

SOLUTION (a) As in parts (c) and (d) of Example 2, we want only powers of z  1, and so we  
need to express z  3 in terms of z  1. This can be done by writing

and then using (5) of Section 19.1 with z replaced by (z  1)/2:

At this point we can expand c1  z 2 3

 in a power series using the general binomial

The binomial series is valid for |(z  3)/2|  1 or |z  3|  2. Multiplying this series by 
1/4(z  3) gives a Laurent series that is valid for 0  |z  3|  2:
 
    f (z) 

EXAMPLE 4 
A Laurent Expansion
Expand f (z)  8z  1
z(1 2 z) in a Laurent series valid for 0  |z|  1.

f (z)  8z  1
z(1 2 z)  8z  1
z

1 2 z  a8  1
z b  (1  z  z 2  z 3  p).
We then multiply the series by 8  1/z and collect like terms:
 
f (z)  1
z   9  9z  9z2  ….
The geometric series converges for |z|  1. After multiplying by 8  1/z, the resulting Laurent 
series is valid for 0  |z|  1.
In the preceding examples, the point at the center of the annular domain of validity for each 
Laurent series was an isolated singularity of the function f. A reexamination of Theorem 19.3.1 
shows that this need not be the case.
EXAMPLE 5 
A Laurent Expansion
Expand f (z) 

z(z 2 1) in a Laurent series valid for 1  |z  2|  2.
SOLUTION The specified annular domain is shown in FIGURE 19.3.4. The center of this domain, 
z  2, is a point of analyticity of the function f. Our goal now is to find two series involving 
integer powers of z  2: one converging for 1  |z  2| and the other converging for |z  2|  2. 
To accomplish this, we start with the decomposition of f into partial fractions:
 
f (z)  1

z 2 1  f1(z)  f2(z).

By replacing z in (14) by 3/z, z  0, we obtain the Laurent series

This series is valid for 0  |z|.

In conclusion, we point out a result that will be of particular importance to us in Sections 19.5

is the principal part of the series. In the discussion that follows we will assign different names 
to the isolated singularity z  z0 according to the number of terms in the principal part.
 Classification of Isolated Singular Points An isolated singular point z  z0 of a 
complex function f  is given a classification depending on whether the principal part (2) of its 
Laurent expansion (1) contains zero, a finite number, or an infinite number of terms.
 (i) 
 If the principal part is zero; that is, all the coefficients ak in (2) are zero, then z  z0 is 
called a removable singularity.
 (ii)  If the principal part contains a finite number of nonzero terms, then z  z0 is called a pole. 
If, in this case, the last nonzero coefficient in (2) is an, n  1, then we say that z  z0 is a 
pole of order n. If z  z0 is a pole of order 1, then the principal part (2) contains exactly 
one term with coefficient a1. A pole of order 1 is commonly called a simple pole.

 (iii)  If the principal part (2) contains infinitely many nonzero terms, then z  z0 is called an 
essential singularity.
The following table summarizes the form of the Laurent series for a function f  when z  z0 
is one of the above types of isolated singularities. Of course, R in the table could be q.

(3)
that z  0 is a removable singularity of the function f (z)  (sin z)/z.
If a function f  has a removable singularity at the point z  z0, then we can always supply an 
appropriate definition for the value of f (z0) so that f  becomes analytic at the point. For instance, 
since the right side of (3) is 1 at z  0, it makes sense to define f (0)  1. With this definition, the 
function f (z)  (sin z)/z in Example 1 is now analytic at z  0.

function f (z)  (sin z)/z3 represented by the series in (2) of Section 19.3 has a pole of order 2 
at z  0.
(b) In Example 3 of Section 19.3 we showed that the Laurent expansion of f (z)  1/(z  1)2(z  3)

Since a2  0, we conclude that z  1 is a pole of order 2.
(c) From Example 6 of Section 19.3 we see from the Laurent series that the principal part 
of the function f (z)  e3/z contains an infinite number of terms. Thus z  0 is an essential 
singularity.
In part (b) of Example 2 in Section 19.3, we showed that the Laurent series representation of 
f (z)  1/z(z  1) valid for 1  |z| is

CHAPTER 19 Series and Residues
The point z  0 is an isolated singularity of f  and the Laurent series contains an infinite number 
of terms involving negative integer powers of z. Does this mean that z  0 is an essential singu-
larity of f  ? The answer is “no.” For this particular function, a reexamination of (1) shows that 
the Laurent series we are interested in is the one with the annular domain 0  |z|  1. From 
part (a) of that same example we saw that
 
f (z)  1
z   1  z  z2  …
was valid for 0  |z|  1. Thus we see that z  0 is a simple pole.
 Zeros Recall that z0 is a zero of a function f  if f (z0)  0. An analytic function f   has a zero 
of order n at z  z0 if
 
f (z0)  0,   f 
(z0)  0,   f (z0)  0,  …,   f  (n1)(z0)  0,   but f  (n)(z0)  0. 
(4)
For example, for f (z)  (z  5)3 we see that f (5)  0, f 
(5)  0, f (5)  0, but f (5)  6. Thus 
z  5 is a zero of order 3. If an analytic function f  has a zero of order n at z  z0, it follows 
from (4) that the Taylor series expansion of f  centered at z0 must have the form
 
f (z)  an(z  z0)n  an1(z  z0)n1  an2(z  z0)n2  …
 
 (z  z0)n[an  an1(z  z0)  an2(z  z0)2  …], 
(5)
where an  0.
EXAMPLE 3 
Order of a Zero
The analytic function f (z)  z sin z2 has a zero at z  0. By replacing z by z2 in (13) of 
Section 19.2, we obtain
 
sin z 2  z 2 2 z 6
3!  z 10
5! 2 p
and so 
 
  f (z)  z sin z 2  z 3 c1 2 z 4
3!  z 8
5! 2 pd .
Comparing the last result with (5) we see that z  0 is a zero of order 3.
A zero z0 of a nontrivial analytic function f  is isolated in the sense that there exists some 
neighborhood of z0 for which f (z)  0 at every point z in that neighborhood except at z  z0. As 
a consequence, if z0 is a zero of a nontrivial analytic function f , then the function 1/f (z) has an 
isolated singularity at the point z  z0. The following result enables us, in some circumstances, 
to determine the poles of a function by inspection.
EXAMPLE 4 
Order of Poles
(a) Inspection of the rational function
F(z) 
2z  5
(z 2 1)(z  5)(z 2 2)4
shows that the denominator has zeros of order 1 at z  1 and z  5, and a zero of order 4 at 
z  2. Since the numerator is not zero at these points, it follows from Theorem 19.4.1 that F 
has simple poles at z  1 and z  5, and a pole of order 4 at z  2.
(b) In Example 3 we saw that z  0 is a zero of order 3 of f (z)  z sin z2. From Theorem 19.4.1, 
we conclude that the function F (z)  1/(z sin z2) has a pole of order 3 at z  0.
From the preceding discussion, it should be intuitively clear that if a function has a pole at
z  z0, then |  f (z)| S q as z S z0 from any direction.
Theorem 19.4.1 
Pole of Order n
If the functions f  and g are analytic at z  z0 and f  has a zero of order n at z  z0 and g(z0)  0, 
then the function F (z)  g(z)/f (z) has a pole of order n at z  z0.

which converges for all z near z0. More precisely, the representation is valid in some deleted 
neighborhood of z0, or punctured open disk, 0  |z  z0|  R. In this section our entire focus will 
be on the coefficient a1 and its importance in the evaluation of contour integrals.
 Residue The coefficient a1 of 1/(z  z0) in the Laurent series given above is called the 
residue of the function f  at the isolated singularity z0. We shall use the notation
 
a1  Res ( f (z), z0)
to denote the residue of f  at z0. Recall, if the principal part of the Laurent series valid for 
0  |z  z0|  R contains a finite number of terms with an the last nonzero coefficient, then z0 
is a pole of order n; if the principal part of the series contains an infinite number of terms with 
nonzero coefficients, then z0 is an essential singularity.
EXAMPLE 1 
Residues
(a) In Example 2 of Section 19.4 we saw that z  1 is a pole of order 2 of the function 
f (z)  1/(z  1)2(z  3). From the Laurent series given in that example we see that the coef-
ficient of 1/(z  1) is a1  Res ( f (z), 1)   1
4.
(b) Example 6 of Section 19.3 showed that z  0 is an essential singularity of f (z)  e3/z. 
From the Laurent series given in that example we see that the coefficient of 1/z is 
a1  Res ( f (z), 0)  3.

CHAPTER 19 Series and Residues
Later on in this section we will see why the coefficient a1 is so important. In the meantime 
we are going to examine ways of obtaining this complex number when z0 is a pole of a function 
f  without the necessity of expanding f  in a Laurent series at z0. We begin with the residue at a 
simple pole.
Theorem 19.5.1 
Residue at a Simple Pole
If f  has a simple pole at z  z0, then
Res ( f (z), z0)  lim
zSz0
 (z  z0) f (z). 
(1)
PROOF: Since z  z0 is a simple pole, the Laurent expansion of f  about that point has the
form
f (z)  a1
z 2 z0
  a0  a1(z  z0)  a2(z  z0)2  ….
By multiplying both sides by z  z0 and then taking the limit as z S z0, we obtain 
lim
zSz0
 (z  z0) f (z)   lim
zSz0
 [a1  a0(z  z0)  a1(z  z0)2  …]  a1  Res (  f (z), z0).
Theorem 19.5.2 
Residue at a Pole of Order n
If f  has a pole of order n at z  z0, then
Res (  f (z), z0) 
1
(n 2 1)! lim
zSz0
 d n21
dz n21 (z 2 z0)n f (z). 
(2)
PROOF: Since f  is assumed to have a pole of order n, its Laurent expansion for 0  |z  z0|  R 
must have the form
 
f (z) 
an
(z 2 z0)n  p 
a2
(z 2 z0)2 
a1
z 2 z0
 a0  a1(z 2 z0)  p.
We multiply the last expression by (z  z0)n: 
(z  z0)nf (z)  an  ...  a2(z  z0)n2  a1(z  z0)n1  a0(z  z0)n  a1(z  z0)n1  ...
and then differentiate n  1 times:
 
d n21
dz n21 (z  z0)nf (z)  (n  1)!a1  n!a0(z  z0)  .... 
(3)
Since all the terms on the right side after the first involve positive integer powers of z  z0, the 
limit of (3) as z S z0 is
 
lim
zSz0
 d n21
dz n21 (z 2 z0)nf (z)  (n 2 1)!a1.
Solving the last equation for a1 gives (2).
Note that (2) reduces to (1) when n  1.
EXAMPLE 2 
Residue at a Pole
The function f (z)  
1
(z 2 1)2 (z 2 3) has a simple pole at z  3 and a pole of order 2 at z  1. 
Use Theorems 19.5.1 and 19.5.2 to find the residue at each pole.

19.5 Residues and Residue Theorem

SOLUTION Since z  3 is a simple pole, we use (1):
Res (  f (z), 3)  lim
zS3 (z 2 3) f (z)  lim
zS3 
1
(z 2 1)2  1
4.
Now at the pole of order 2 it follows from (2) that
 Res ( f (z), 1)  1
1! lim

 lim
zS1 d
dz

z 2 3
  lim

1
(z 2 3)2  1
4.
When f  is not a rational function, calculating residues by means of (1) can sometimes be 
tedious. It is possible to devise alternative residue formulas. In particular, suppose a function f 
can be written as a quotient f (z)  g(z)/h(z), where g and h are analytic at z  z0. If g(z0)  0 and 
if the function h has a zero of order 1 at z0, then f  has a simple pole at z  z0 and
 
Res (  f (z), z0)  g(z0)
h9(z0). 
(4)
To see this last result, we use (1) and the facts that h(z0)  0 and that limzSz0(h(z)  h(z0))/(z  z0) 
is a definition of the derivative h
(z0):
 
Res ( f (z), z0)  lim
zSz0
 (z 2 z0) g(z)
h(z)  lim
zSz0
 
g(z)
 h(z) 2 h(z0)
z 2 z0
 g(z0)
h9(z0).
Analogous formulas for residues at poles of order greater than 1 are complicated and will not 
be given.
An alternative method for 
computing a residue at a 
simple pole.
EXAMPLE 3 
Using (4) to Compute a Residue
The polynomial z4  1 can be factored as (z  z1)(z  z2)(z  z3)(z  z4), where z1, z2, z3, 
and z4 are the four distinct roots of the equation z4  1  0. It follows from Theorem 19.4.1 
that the function
 
f (z) 
1
z 4  1
has four simple poles. Now from (10) of Section 17.2 we have z1  epi/4, z2  e3pi/4, z3  e5pi/4, 
z4  e7pi/4. To compute the residues, we use (4) and Euler’s formula:

 Residue Theorem We come now to the reason for the importance of the residue  concept. 
The next theorem states that under some circumstances, we can evaluate complex integrals 
 
C f (z) dz 
by summing the residues at the isolated singularities of f  within the closed contour C.

PROOF: Suppose C1, C2, . . ., Cn are circles centered at z1, z2, . . ., zn, respectively. Suppose further 
that each circle Ck has a radius rk small enough so that C1, C2, . . ., Cn are mutually disjoint and are 
interior to the simple closed curve C. See FIGURE 19.5.1. Recall that (15) of Section 19.3 implies

SOLUTION By writing z2  4  (z  2i)(z  2i), we see that the integrand has simple poles 
at 2i and 2i. Now since only 2i lies within the contour C, it follows from (5) that

But

z  0 and a simple pole at z  5. Since only z  0 lies within the given contour, we have

Evaluation by the Residue Theorem
Evaluate  BC
 tan z dz, where the contour C is the circle |z|  2.
SOLUTION The integrand tan z  sin z/cos z has simple poles at the points where cos z  0. 
We saw in Section 17.7 that the only zeros for cos z are the real numbers z  (2n  1)p/2, 
n  0, 1, 2, . . . . Since only p/2 and p/2 are within the circle |z|  2, we have
 
 BC
tan z dz  2pi cRes af (z), p
2 b  Res af (z),  p

Now from (4) with g(z)  sin z, h(z)  cos z, and h

Therefore,

EXAMPLE 8 
Evaluation by the Residue Theorem
Evaluate  BC
e3>z dz, where the contour C is the circle |z|  1.
SOLUTION As we have seen, z  0 is an essential singularity of the integrand f (z)  e3/z and 
so neither formula (1) nor (2) is applicable to find the residue of f  at that point. Nevertheless, 
we saw in part (b) of Example 1 that the Laurent series of f  at z  0 gives Res(  f (z), 0)  3. 
Hence from (5) we have
 
 BC
e3>z dz  2pi Res ( f (z), 0)  6pi.
REMARKS
In the application of the limit formulas (1) and (2) for computing residues, the indeterminate 
form 0/0 may result. Although we are not going to prove it, it should be pointed out that 
L’Hôpital’s rule is valid in complex analysis. If f (z)  g(z)/h(z), where g and h are analytic 
at z  z0, g(z0)  0, h(z0)  0, and h

CHAPTER 19 Series and Residues
If both limits in (5) exist, the integral is said to be convergent; if one or both of the limits fail to 
exist, the integral is divergent. In the event that we know (a priori) that an integral eq
q f (x) dx
converges, we can evaluate it by means of a single limiting process:
#

It is important to note that the symmetric limit in (6) may exist even though the improper integral is 
divergent. For example, the integral eq
q x dx is divergent since limRS eR

In (7) we have shown that P.V. eq
q x dx  0. To summarize, when an integral of form (2) con-
verges, its Cauchy principal value is the same as the value of the integral. If the integral diverges, 
it may still possess a Cauchy principal value.
To evaluate an integral eq
q f (x) dx, where f (x)  P(x)/Q(x) is continuous on (q, q), by 
residue theory we replace x by the complex variable z and integrate the complex function f  over 
a closed contour C that consists of the interval [R, R] on the real axis and a semicircle CR of 
radius large enough to enclose all the poles of f (z)  P(z)/Q(z) in the upper half-plane Re(z)  0.

We now want to let R S q in (9). Before doing this, we note that on CR, 
|(z2  1)(z2  9)|  |z2  1| |z2  9|  | |z|
2  1| | |z|
2  9|  (R2  1)(R2  9), 
and so from the ML-inequality of Section 18.1 we can write
 
ZI2Z  2#
CR

(z 2  1)(z 2  9) dz 2 #
pR
(R2 2 1)(R2 2 9).
This last result shows that |I2| S 0 as R S q, and so we conclude that limRS  q I2  0. It follows 
from (9) that limRS  q I1  p/12; in other words,

It is often tedious to have to show that the contour integral along CR approaches zero as R S q. 
Sufficient conditions under which this is always true are given in the next theorem.
Theorem 19.6.1 
Behavior of Integral as R S q
Suppose f (z)  P(z)/Q(z), where the degree of P(z) is n and the degree of Q(z) is m  n  2. 
If CR is a semicircular contour z  Reiu, 0 	 u 	 p, then eCR f (z) dz S 0 as R S q.
In other words, the integral along CR approaches zero as R S q when the denominator of f  is 
of a power at least 2 more than its numerator. The proof of this fact follows in the same manner 
as in Example 2. Notice in that example that the conditions stipulated in Theorem 19.6.1 are 
satisfied, since the degree of P(z)  1 is 0 and the degree of Q(z)  (z2  1)(z2  9) is 4.
EXAMPLE 3

 4  1 dx.
SOLUTION By inspection of the integrand, we see that the conditions given in Theorem 
19.6.1 are satisfied. Moreover, we know from Example 3 of Section 19.5 that f  has simple 
poles in the upper half-plane at z1  epi/4 and z2  e3pi/4. We also saw in that example that 
the residues at these poles are

 Integrals of the Forms eq
q f(x) cos ax dx or eq
q f(x) sin ax dx
We encountered integrals of this type in Section 15.4 in the study of Fourier transforms. 
Accordingly, eq
q f (x) cos ax dx and eq
q f (x) sin ax dx, a  0, are referred to as Fourier integrals.
Fourier integrals appear as the real and imaginary parts in the improper integral eq
q f (x)eiax dx. 
Using Euler’s formula eiax  cos ax  i sin ax, we get

whenever both integrals on the right side converge. When f (x)  P(x)/Q(x) is continuous on 
(q, q) we can evaluate both Fourier integrals at the same time by considering the integral 
C f (z)eiaz dz, where a  0 and the contour C again consists of the interval [R, R] on the real 
axis and a semicircular contour CR with radius large enough to enclose the poles of f (z) in the 
upper half-plane.

CHAPTER 19 Series and Residues
Before proceeding we give, without proof, sufficient conditions under which the contour 
integral along CR approaches zero as R S q:
Theorem 19.6.2 
Behavior of Integral as R S q
Suppose f (z)  P(z)/Q(z), where the degree of P(z) is n and the degree of Q(z) is m  n  1. If CR
is a semicircular contour z  Reiu, 0 	 u 	 p, and a  0, then eCR(P(z)/Q(z))eiaz dz S 0 as R S q.
EXAMPLE 4

SOLUTION First note that the limits of integration are not from q to q as required by the 
method. This can be rectified by observing that since the integrand is an even function of x, 
we can write
#

With a  1, we now form the contour integral

where C is the same contour shown in Figure 19.6.2. By Theorem 19.5.3,

Res ( f (z) eiz, 3i)  zeiz
2z 2

Hence, in view of Theorem 19.6.2 we conclude eCR f (z)eiz dz S 0 as R S q and so

 Indented Contours The improper integrals of form (2) and (3) that we have considered 
up to this point were continuous on the interval (q, q). In other words, the complex function 
f (z)  P(z)/Q(z) did not have poles on the real axis. In the event f  has poles on the real axis, 
we must modify the procedure used in Examples 2–  4. For example, to evaluate eq
q f (x) dx by 
residues when f (z) has a pole at z  c, where c is a real number, we use an indented contour
as illustrated in FIGURE 19.6.3. The symbol Cr denotes a semicircular contour centered at z  c 
oriented in the positive direction. The next theorem is important to this discussion.

Theorem 19.6.3 
Behavior of Integral as r S 0
Suppose f  has a simple pole z  c on the real axis. If Cr is the contour defined by z  c  reiu, 
0 	 u 	 p, then
lim
rS0 #
Cr
 f (z) dz  pi Res ( f (z), c).
PROOF: Since f  has a simple pole at z  c, its Laurent series is
f (z) 
a1
z 2 c  g(z), 
where a1  Res(  f (z), c) and g is analytic at c. Using the Laurent series and the parameteriza-
tion of Cr , we have
 
#

p

ireiu
reiu  du  ir #
p

g(c  reiu) eiu du  I1  I2. 
(12)
First, we see that
I1  a1 #
p
0
ireiu
reiu  du  a1 #
p
0
 i du  pia1  pi Res (  f (z), c).
Next, g is analytic at c and so it is continuous at this point and bounded in a neighborhood of the 
point; that is, there exists an M  0 for which |g(c  reiu )| 	 M. Hence, 
 
ZI2Z  2ir #
p
0
g(c  reiu) eiu du 2 # r #
p
0
M du  prM.
It follows from this last inequality that limrS 0|I2|  0 and consequently limrS  0 I2  0. By taking 
the limit of (12) as r S 0, we have proved the theorem.

SOLUTION Since the integral is of form (3), we consider the contour integral C eiz dz /z(z2  2z  2). 
The function f (z)  1/z(z2  2z  2) has simple poles at z  0 and at z  1  i in the upper half-plane. 
The contour C shown in FIGURE 19.6.4 is indented at the origin. Adopting an obvious notation, we have

where eCr  eCr

In this chapter we will study the 
mapping properties of the 
elementary functions introduced 
in Chapter 17 and develop two 
new classes of special mappings 
called the linear fractional 
transformations and the 
Schwarz–Christoffel 
transformations.
In earlier chapters we used 
Fourier series and integral 
transforms to solve boundary-
value problems involving Laplace’s 
equation. Conformal mapping 
methods discussed in this chapter 
can be used to transfer known 
solutions to Laplace’s equation 
from one region to another. In 
addition, fluid flows around 
obstacles and through channels 
can be determined using 
conformal mappings.

CHAPTER 20 Conformal Mappings
20.1 
Complex Functions as Mappings
INTRODUCTION 
In Chapter 17 we emphasized the algebraic definitions and properties of 
complex functions. In order to give a geometric interpretation of a complex function w  f (z), 
we place a z-plane and a w-plane side by side and imagine that a point z  x  iy in the domain of 
the definition of f has mapped (or transformed) to the point w  f (z) in the second plane. Thus the 
complex function w  f (z)  u(x, y)  iv(x, y) may be considered as the planar transformation
 
u  u(x, y), v  v(x, y)
and w  f (z) is called the image of z under f.
FIGURE 20.1.1 indicates the images of a finite number of complex numbers in the region R. More 
useful information is obtained by finding the image of the region R together with the images of 
a family of curves lying inside R. Common choices for the curves are families of lines, families 
of circles, and the system of level curves for the real and imaginary parts of f .

 Images of Curves Note that if z(t)  x(t)  iy(t), a  t  b, describes a curve C in the 
region, then w  f (z(t)), a  t  b, is a parametric representation of the corresponding curve C
in the w-plane. In addition, a point z on the level curve u(x, y)  a will be mapped to a point w 
that lies on the vertical line u  a, and a point z on the level curve v(x, y)  b will be mapped to 
a point w that lies on the horizontal line v  b.
EXAMPLE 1 
The Mapping f (z)  e z
The horizontal strip 0  y  p lies in the fundamental region of the exponential function 
f (z)  ez. A vertical line segment x  a in this region can be described by z(t)  a  it, 0  t  p, 
and so w  f (z(t))  eaeit. Thus the image is a semicircle with center at w  0 and with radius 
r  ea. Similarly, a horizontal line y  b can be parametrized by z(t)  t  ib, q  t  q, 
and so w  f (z(t))  eteib. Since Arg w  b and ZwZ  et, the image is a ray emanating from 
the origin, and since 0  Arg w  p, the image of the entire horizontal strip is the upper half-
plane v  0. Note that the horizontal lines y  0 and y  p are mapped onto the positive and 
negative u-axis, respectively. See FIGURE 20.1.2 for the mapping by f (z)  ez.
From w  exeiy, we can conclude that ZwZ  e x and y  Arg w. Hence, z  x  iy  logeZwZ 
i Arg w  Ln w. The inverse function f 1(w)  Ln w therefore maps the upper half-plane 
v  0 back to the horizontal strip 0  y  p.
EXAMPLE 2 
The Mapping f (z)  1/z
The complex function  f (z)  1/z has domain z 	 0 and real and imaginary parts u(x, y) 
x/(x2  y2) and v(x, y)  y/(x2  y2), respectively. When a 	 0, a level curve u(x, y)  a 
can be written as

The level curve is therefore a circle with its center on the x-axis and passing through the origin. 
A point z on this circle other than zero is mapped to a point w on the line u  a. Likewise, the 
level curve v(x, y)  b, b 	 0, can be written as
 
x

, 
and a point z on this circle is mapped to a point w on the line v  b. FIGURE 20.1.3 shows the 
mapping by f (z)  1/z. Figure 20.1.3(a) shows the two collections of circular level curves, 
and Figure 20.1.3(b) shows their corresponding images in the w-plane.
Since w  1/z, we have z  1/w. Thus f 1(w)  1/w, and so f   f 1. We can therefore 
conclude that f  maps the horizontal line y  b to the circle u2  (v  1
2b)2  (1
2b)2, and f  maps 
the vertical line x  a to the circle (u 2 1
2a)2  v 2  (1
2a)2.
 Translation and Rotation The elementary linear function f (z)  z  z0 may be inter-
preted as a translation in the z-plane. To see this, we let z  x  iy and z0  h  ik. Since 
w  f (z)  (x  h)  i( y  k), the point (x, y) has been translated h units in the horizontal direc-
tion and k units in the vertical direction to the new position at (x  h, y  k). In particular, the 
origin O has been mapped to z0  h  ik.
The elementary function g(z)  eiu0z may be interpreted as a rotation through u0 degrees, for 
if z  reiu, then w  g(z)  rei(uu0). Note that if the complex mapping h(z)  eiu0z  z0 is applied 
to a region R that is centered at the origin, the image region R can be obtained by first rotating 
R through u0 degrees and then translating the center to the new position z0. See FIGURE 20.1.4 for 
the mapping by h(z)  eiu0z  z0.
EXAMPLE 3 
Rotation and Translation
Find a complex function that maps the horizontal strip 1  y  1 onto the vertical strip 
2  x  4.
SOLUTION If the horizontal strip 1  y  1 is rotated through 90
, the vertical strip 1  x  1 
results, and the vertical strip 2  x  4 can be obtained by shifting this vertical strip 3 units to the 
right. See FIGURE 20.1.5. Since eip/2  i, we obtain h(z)  iz  3 as the desired complex mapping.

 Magnification A magnification is a complex function of the form f (z)  az, where a 
is a fixed positive real number. Note that ZwZ  ZazZ  aZzZ, and so f  changes the length (but not 
the direction) of the complex number z by a fixed factor a. If g(z)  az  b and a  r0eiu0, then the 
vector z is rotated through u0 degrees, magnified by a factor of r0, and then translated using b.

its center to the point 1  i. Therefore, w  f (z)  1

CHAPTER 20 Conformal Mappings
 Power Functions A complex function of the form f (z)  za, where a is a fixed positive 
real number, is called a real power function. FIGURE 20.1.6 shows the effect of the complex func-
tion f (z)  za on the angular wedge 0  Arg z  u0. If z  reiu, then w  f (z)  raeiau. Hence, 
0  Arg w  au0 and the opening of the wedge is changed by a factor of a. It is not difficult to 
show that a circular arc with center at the origin is mapped to a similar circular arc, and rays 
emanating from the origin are mapped to similar rays.
EXAMPLE 5 
The Power Function f (z)  z 1/4
Find a complex function that maps the upper half-plane y  0 onto the wedge 0  Arg w  p/4.
SOLUTION The upper half-plane y  0 can also be described by the inequality 0  Arg z  p. 
We must therefore find a complex mapping that reduces the angle u0  p by a factor of a  1
4. 
Hence, f (z)  z1/4.
 Successive Mappings To find a complex mapping between two regions R and R, it is 
often convenient to first map R onto a third region R and then find a complex mapping from R onto R. 
More precisely, if z  f (z) maps R onto R, and w  g(z) maps R onto R, then the composite 
function w  g(  f (z)) maps R onto R. See FIGURE 20.1.7 for a diagram of successive mappings.

EXAMPLE 6 
Successive Mappings
Find a complex function that maps the horizontal strip 0  y  p onto the wedge 
0  Arg w  p/4.
SOLUTION We saw in Example 1 that the complex function f (z)  ez mapped the horizon-
tal strip 0  y  p onto the upper half-plane 0  Arg z  p. From Example 5, the upper 
half-plane 0  Arg z  p is mapped onto the wedge 0  Arg w  p/4 by g(z)  z1/4. It 
therefore follows that the composite function w  g(  f (z))  g(ez)  ez/4 maps the horizontal 
strip 0  y  p onto the wedge 0  Arg w  p/4.
EXAMPLE 7 
Successive Mappings
Find a complex function that maps the wedge p/4  Arg z  3p/4 onto the upper half-plane 
v  0.
SOLUTION We first rotate the wedge p/4  Arg z  3p/4 so that it is in the standard position 
shown in Figure 20.1.6. If z  f (z)  eip/4z, then the image of this wedge is the wedge R 
defined by 0  Arg z  p/2. The real power function w  g(z)  z2 expands the opening of 
R by a factor of two to give the upper half-plane 0  Arg w  p as its image. Therefore, 
w  g(  f (z))  (eip/4z)2  iz2 is the desired mapping.
In Sections 20.2–20.4, we will expand our knowledge of complex mappings and show how 
they can be used to solve Laplace’s equation in the plane.

CHAPTER 20 Conformal Mappings
20.2 Conformal Mappings
INTRODUCTION 
In Section 20.1 we saw that a nonconstant linear mapping f (z)  az  b, 
a and b complex numbers, acts by rotating, magnifying, and translating points in the complex plane. 
As a result, it is easily shown that the angle between any two intersecting curves in the z-plane is 
equal to the angle between the images of the arcs in the w-plane under a linear mapping. Other com-
plex mappings that have this angle-preserving property are the subject of our study in this section.
 Angle-Preserving Mappings A complex mapping w  f (z) defined on a domain D
is called conformal at z  z0 in D when f preserves the angles between any two curves in D that 
intersect at z0. More precisely, if C1 and C2 intersect in D at z0, and C19 and C29 are the corresponding 
images in the w-plane, we require that the angle u between C1 and C2 equal the angle f between 
C19 and C29. See FIGURE 20.2.1.
These angles can be computed in terms of tangent vectors to the curves. If z19 and z29 denote 
tangent vectors to curves C1 and C2, respectively, then, applying the law of cosines to the triangle 
determined by z19 and z29, we have
 
Zz19  z29Z2  Zz19Z2  Zz29Z2  2Zz19Z Zz29Z cos u

The next theorem gives a simple condition that guarantees that u  f.
Theorem 20.2.1* 
Conformal Mapping
If f (z) is analytic in the domain D and f (z0) 	 0, then f is conformal at z  z0.
PROOF: If a curve C in D is parameterized by z  z(t), then w  f (z(t)) describes the image 
curve in the w-plane. Applying the Chain Rule to w  f (z(t)) gives w  f (z(t))z(t). If curves 
C1 and C2 intersect in D at z0, then w19  f (z0)z19 and w29  f (z0)z29. Since f (z0) 	 0, we can 
use (2) to obtain
 
f 
 cos1a
Z f 9(z0)z19Z2  Z f 9(z0)z29Z2 2 Z f 9(z0)z19 2 f 9(z0)z29Z2
2Z f 9(z0)z19ZZ f 9(z0)z29Z
b.
We can apply the laws of absolute value to factor out Z f (z0)Z 2 in the numerator and denominator 
and obtain
 
f 
 cos1a
Zz19Z2  Zz29Z2 2 Zz19 2 z29Z2
2Zz19ZZz29Z
b.
Therefore, from (1), f  u.
EXAMPLE 1 
Conformal Mappings
(a) The analytic function f (z)  ez is conformal at all points in the z-plane, since  f (z)  ez
is never zero.
(b) The analytic function g(z)  z2 is conformal at all points except z  0 since g(z)  2z 	 0 
for z 	 0. From Figure 20.1.6 we see that g(z) doubles the angle formed by the two rays at 
the origin.
* It is also possible to prove that f preserves the sense of direction between the tangent vectors.

If f (z0)  0 but f (z0) 	 0, it is possible to show that f doubles the angle between any two 
curves in D that intersect at z  z0. The next two examples will introduce two important complex 
mappings that are conformal at all but a finite number of points in their domains.
EXAMPLE 2 
f (z)  sin z as a Conformal Mapping
The vertical strip p/2  x  p/2 is called the fundamental region of the trigonometric 
function w  sin z. A vertical line x  a in the interior of this region can be described by 
z(t)  a  it, q  t  q. From (6) in Section 17.7, we have
 
sin z  sin x cosh y  i cos x sinh y
and so 
u  iv  sin(a  it)  sin a cosh t  i cos a sinh t.
From the identity cosh2t  sinh2t  1, it follows that
 
u2
 sin 2a 2
v 2
 cos 2a  1.
The image of the vertical line x  a is therefore a hyperbola with sin a as u-intercepts, and 
since p/2  a  p/2, the hyperbola crosses the u-axis between u  1 and u  1. Note 
that if a  p/2, then w  cosh t, and so the line x  p/2 is mapped onto the interval 
(q, 1] on the negative u-axis. Likewise, the line x  p/2 is mapped onto the interval 
[1, q) on the positive u-axis.
A similar argument establishes that the horizontal line segment described by z(t)  t  ib, 
p/2  t  p/2, is mapped onto either the upper portion or the lower portion of the ellipse
 
u2
  cosh2b 
v 2
  sinh2b  1
according to whether b  0 or b  0. These results are summarized in FIGURE 20.2.2(b), which 
shows the mapping by f (z)  sin z. Note that we have carefully used capital letters to indi-
cate where portions of the boundary are mapped. Thus, for example, boundary segment AB 
is transformed to AB.
Since f (z)  cos z, f is conformal at all points in the region except z  p/2. The hyper-
bolas and ellipses are therefore orthogonal since they are images of the orthogonal families 
of horizontal segments and vertical lines. Note that the 180
 angle at z  p/2 formed by 
segments AB and AC is doubled to form a single line segment at w  1.
EXAMPLE 3 
f (z)  z  1/z as a Conformal Mapping
The complex mapping f (z)  z  1/z is conformal at all values of z except z  1 and z  0. 
In particular, the function is conformal for all values of z in the upper half-plane that satisfy 
ZzZ  1. If z  reiu, then w  reiu  (1/r)eiu, and so
 
u  ar  1
r b  cos u,   v  ar 2 1
r b  sin u. 
(3)
Note that if r  1, then v  0 and u  2 cos u. Therefore, the semicircle z  eit, 0  t  p, 
is mapped to the segment [2, 2] on the u-axis. It follows from (3) that if r  1, then the 
semicircle z  reit, 0  t  p, is mapped onto the upper half of the ellipse u2/a2  v2/b2  1, 
where a  r  1/r and b  r  1/r. See FIGURE 20.2.3 for the mapping by f (z)  z  1/z.
For a fixed value of u, the ray z  teiu, for t  1, is mapped to the portion of the hyperbola 
u2/cos2u  v2/sin2u  4 in the upper half-plane v  0. This follows from (3), since

CHAPTER 20 Conformal Mappings
 Conformal Mappings Using Tables Conformal mappings are given in Appendix IV. 
The mappings have been categorized as elementary mappings (E-1 to E-9), mappings to half-
planes (H-1 to H-6), mappings to circular regions (C-1 to C-5), and miscellaneous mappings 
(M-1 to M-10). Some of these complex mappings will be derived in Sections 20.3 and 20.4.
The entries indicate not only the images of the region R but also the images of various portions 
of the boundary of R. This will be especially useful when we attempt to solve boundary-value 
problems using conformal maps. You should use the appendix much like you use integral tables 
to find antiderivatives. In some cases a single entry can be used to find a conformal mapping 
between two given regions R and R. In other cases, successive transformations may be required 
to map R to R.
EXAMPLE 4 
Using a Table of Conformal Mappings
Use the conformal mappings in Appendix IV to find a conformal mapping between the strip 
0  y  2 and the upper half-plane v  0. What is the image of the negative x-axis?
SOLUTION An appropriate mapping may be obtained directly from entry H-2. Letting a  2 
then f (z)  epz/2 and noting the positions of E, D, E, and D in the figure, we can map the 
negative x-axis onto the interval (0, 1) on the u-axis.
EXAMPLE 5 
Using a Table of Conformal Mappings
Use the conformal mappings in Appendix IV to find a conformal mapping between the strip 
0  y  2 and the disk ZwZ  1. What is the image of the negative x-axis?
SOLUTION Appendix IV does not have an entry that maps the strip 0  y  2 directly onto the 
disk. In Example 4, the strip was mapped by f (z)  epz/2 onto the upper half-plane and, from 
entry C-4, the complex mapping w  i 2 z
i  z maps the upper half-plane to the disk ZwZ  1. 
Therefore, w  g(  f (z))  i 2 epz>2
i  epz>2 maps the strip 0  y  2 onto the disk ZwZ  1.
The negative x-axis is first mapped to the interval (0, 1) in the z-plane, and from the 
position of points C and C in C-4, the interval (0, 1) is mapped to the circular arc w  eiu, 
0  u  p/2, in the w-plane.
 Harmonic Functions and the Dirichlet Problem A bounded harmonic function 
u  u(x, y) that takes on prescribed values on the entire boundary of a region R is called a solu-
tion to a Dirichlet problem on R. In Chapters 13–15 we introduced a number of techniques for 
solving Laplace’s equation in the plane, and we interpreted the solution to a Dirichlet problem 
as the steady-state temperature distribution in the interior of R that results from the fixed tem-
peratures on the boundary.
There are at least two disadvantages to the Fourier series and integral transform methods 
presented in Chapters 13–15. The methods work only for simple regions in the plane and the 
solutions typically take the form of either infinite series or improper integrals. As such, they are 
difficult to evaluate. In Section 17.5 we saw that the real and imaginary parts of an analytic func-
tion are both harmonic. Since we have a large stockpile of analytic functions, we can find closed-
form solutions to many Dirichlet problems and use these solutions to sketch the isotherms and 
lines of flow of the temperature distribution.
We will next show how conformal mappings can be used to solve a Dirichlet problem in a 
region R once the solution to the corresponding Dirichlet problem in the image region R is 
known. The method depends on the following theorem.
Theorem 20.2.2 
 Transformation Theorem for Harmonic Functions
Let f be an analytic function that maps a domain D onto a domain D. If U is  harmonic in D, 
then the real-valued function u(x, y)  U(  f (z)) is harmonic in D.
PROOF: We will give a proof for the special case in which D is simply connected. If U has a 
harmonic conjugate V in D, then H  U  iV is analytic in D, and so the composite function 

H(  f (z))  U(  f (z))  iV(  f (z)) is analytic in D. By Theorem 17.5.3, it follows that the real part 
U(  f (z)) is harmonic in D, and the proof is complete.
To establish that U has a harmonic conjugate, let g(z)  U/x  i U/y. The first Cauchy–
Riemann equation (/x)(U/x)  (/y)(U/y) is equivalent to Laplace’s equation 
2U/x2  2U/y2  0, which is satisfied because U is harmonic in D. The second Cauchy–
Riemann equation (/y)(U/x)  (/x)(U/y) is equivalent to the equality of the second-
order mixed partial derivatives. Therefore, g(z) is analytic in the simply connected domain D and so, by 
Theorem 18.3.3, has an antiderivative G(z). If G(z)  U1  iV1, then g(z)  G(z)  U1/x  i U1/y. 
Since g(z)  U/x  i U/y, it follows that U and U1 have equal first partial derivatives. Therefore, 
H  U  iV1 is analytic in D, and so U has a harmonic conjugate in D.
Theorem 20.2.2 can be used to solve a Dirichlet problem in a region R by transforming the 
problem to a region R in which the solution U either is apparent or has been found by prior 
methods (including the Fourier series and integral transform methods of Chapters 13–15). The 
key steps are summarized next.
 Solving Dirichlet Problems Using Conformal Mapping
1. Find a conformal mapping w  f (z) that transforms the original region R onto the image 
region R. The region R may be a region for which many explicit solutions to Dirichlet 
problems are known.
 
2. Transfer the boundary conditions from the boundary of R to the boundary of R. The value 
of u at a boundary point j of R is assigned as the value of U at the corresponding boundary 
point f (j). See FIGURE 20.2.4 for an illustration of transferring boundary conditions.

3. Solve the corresponding Dirichlet problem in R. The solution U may be apparent from 
the simplicity of the problem in R or may be found using Fourier or integral transform 
methods. (Additional methods will be presented in Sections 20.3 and 20.5.)
 
4. The solution to the original Dirichlet problem is u(x, y)  U(  f (z)).
EXAMPLE 6 
Solving a Dirichlet Problem
The function U(u, v)  (1/p) Arg w is harmonic in the upper half-plane v  0 since it is the 
imaginary part of the analytic function g(w)  (1/p) Ln w. Use this function to solve the 
Dirichlet problem in FIGURE 20.2.5(a).
SOLUTION The analytic function f (z)  sin z maps the original region to the upper half-plane 
v  0 and maps the boundary segments to the segments shown in Figure 20.2.5(b). The har-
monic function U(u, v)  (1/p) Arg w satisfies the transferred boundary conditions U(u, 0)  0 
for u  0 and U(u, 0)  1 for u  0. Therefore, u(x, y)  U(sin z)  (1/p) Arg(sin z) is the 
solution to the original problem. If tan1(v/u) is chosen to lie between 0 and p, the solution 
can also be written as
 
u (x, y)  1

sin x cosh yb.

In Problem 12 in Exercises 14.1, we discovered that U(r, u)  (loger)/(loger0) is the solution 
to the new Dirichlet problem. From Theorem 20.2.2 we can conclude that the solution to the 
original boundary-value problem is
 
u (x, y) 

log e (5 2 2!6) log e 2
z 2 (7  2!6)>5
(7  2!6)z>5 2 1 2 .
A favorite image region R for a simply connected region R is the upper half-plane y  0. For 
any real number a, the complex function Ln(z  a)  logeZz  aZ  i Arg(z  a) is analytic in R. 
Therefore, Arg(z  a) is harmonic in R and is a solution to the Dirichlet problem shown in 
FIGURE 20.2.7.
It follows that the solution in R to the Dirichlet problem with
 
U(x, 0)  ec0, 
a , x , b

otherwise
is the harmonic function U(x, y)  (c0 /p)(Arg(z  b)  Arg(z  a)). A large number of Dirichlet 
problems in the upper half-plane y  0 can be solved by adding together harmonic functions of 
this form.

20.3 Linear Fractional Transformations
INTRODUCTION 
In many applications that involve boundary-value problems associated 
with Laplace’s equation, it is necessary to find a conformal mapping that maps a disk onto the 
half-plane v  0. Such a mapping would have to map the circular boundary of the disk to the 
boundary line of the half-plane. An important class of elementary conformal mappings that map 
circles to lines (and vice versa) are the fractional transformations. In this section we will define 
and study this special class of mappings.

20.3 Linear Fractional Transformations 
|
923
 Linear Fractional Transformation If a, b, c, and d are complex constants with 
ad  bc 	 0, then the complex function defined by
 
T (z)  az  b
cz  d
is called a linear fractional transformation. Since
 
T9(z)  ad 2 bc
(cz  d)2, 
T is conformal at z provided   ad  bc 	 0 and z 	 d/c. (If   0, then T(z)  0 and T(z) 
would be a constant function.) Linear fractional transformations are circle preserving in a sense 
that we will make precise in this section, and, as we saw in Example 7 of Section 20.2, they can 
be useful in solving Dirichlet problems in regions bounded by circles.
Note that when c 	 0, T(z) has a simple pole at z0  d/c and so
 
lim
zSz0
 ZT (z)Z  q.
We will write T(z0)  q as shorthand for this limit. In addition, if c 	 0, then
 
lim
ZzZSq T (z)  lim
ZzZSq  
a  b>z
c  d>z  a
c, 
and we write T(q)  a/c.
EXAMPLE 1 
A Linear Fractional Transformation
If T(z)  (2z  1)/(z  i), compute T(0), T(q), and T(i).
SOLUTION Note that T(0)  1/(i)  i and T(q)  lim|z|S  q T(z)  2. Since z  i is a simple 
pole for T(z), we have limzS iZT(z)Z  q and we write T(i)  q.
 Circle-Preserving Property If c  0, the linear fractional transformation reduces to a 
linear function T(z)  Az  B. We saw in Section 20.1 that such a complex mapping can be 
considered as the composite of a rotation, magnification, and translation. As such, a linear func-
tion will map a circle in the z-plane to a circle in the w-plane. When c 	 0, we can divide cz  d 
into az  b to obtain
 
w  az  b
cz  d  bc 2 ad
c
 
1
cz  d  a
c. 
(1)
If we let A  (bc  ad)/c and B  a/c, T(z) can be written as the composite of transformations:
 
z1  cz  d,  z2  1
z1
,  w  Az2  B. 
(2)
A general linear fractional transformation can therefore be written as the composite of two linear 
functions and the inversion w  1/z. Note that if Zz  z1Z  r and w  1/z, then
 
2 1
w 2 1
w1
2 
Zw 2 w1Z
ZwZZw1Z
 r  or  Zw 2 w1Z  (r Zw1Z)Zw 2 0Z. 
(3)
It is not hard to show that the set of all points w that satisfy
 
Zw  w1Z  lZw  w2Z 
(4)
is a line when l  1 and is a circle when l  0 and l 	 1. It follows from (3) that the image of 
the circle Zz  z1Z  r under the inversion w  1/z is a circle except when r  1/Zw1Z  Zz1Z. In the 

924
|
CHAPTER 20 Conformal Mappings
latter case, the original circle passes through the origin and the image is a line. See Figure 20.1.3. 
From (2), we can deduce the following theorem.
Theorem 20.3.1 
Circle-Preserving Property
A linear fractional transformation maps a circle in the z-plane to either a line or a circle in 
the w-plane. The image is a line if and only if the original circle passes through a pole of 
the linear fractional transformation.
PROOF: We have shown that a linear function maps a circle to a circle, whereas an inver-
sion maps a circle to a circle or a line. It follows from (2) that a circle in the z-plane will be 
mapped to either a circle or a line in the w-plane. If the original circle passes through a pole z0, 
then T(z0)  q, and so the image is unbounded. Therefore, the image of such a circle must be a line. 
If the original circle does not pass through z0, then the image is bounded and must be a circle.
EXAMPLE 2 
Images of Circles
Find the images of the circles ZzZ  1 and ZzZ  2 under T(z)  (z  2)/(z  1). What are the 
images of the interiors of these circles?
SOLUTION The circle ZzZ  1 passes through the pole z0  1 of the linear fractional 
transformation and so the image is a line. Since T(1)  1
2 and T(i)  1
2  3
2i, we can 
conclude that the image is the line u  1
2. The image of the interior ZzZ  1 is either the 
half-plane u  1
2 or the half-plane u  1
2 . Using z  0 as a test point, T(0)  2, and so 
the image is the half-plane u  1
2.
The circle ZzZ  2 does not pass through the pole and so the image is a circle. For ZzZ  2,
ZzZ  2  and  T (z)  z  2
z 2 1  z  2
z 2 1  T ( z ).
Therefore, T(z) is a point on the image circle and so the image circle is symmetric with respect 
to the u-axis. Since T(2)  0 and T(2)  4, the center of the circle is w  2 and the image 
is the circle Zw  2Z  2. See FIGURE 20.3.1. The image of the interior ZzZ  2 is either the 
interior or the exterior of the image circle Zw  2Z  2. Since T(0)  2, we can conclude 
that the image is Zw  2Z  2.

 Constructing Special Mappings In order to use linear fractional transformations to 
solve Dirichlet problems, we must construct special functions that map a given circular region 
R to a target region R in which the corresponding Dirichlet problem is solvable. Since a circular 
boundary is determined by three of its points, we must find a linear fractional transformation 
w  T(z) that maps three given points z1, z2, and z3 on the boundary of R to three points w1, w2, 
and w3 on the boundary of R. In addition, the interior of R must be the image of the interior of R.

 Matrix Methods Matrix methods can be used to simplify many of the computations. We

with T(z)  (az  b)/(cz  d).* If T1(z)  (a1z  b1)/(c1z  d1) and T2(z)  (a2z  b2) /(c2z  d2), 
then the composite function T(z)  T2(T1(z)) is given by T(z)  (az  b)/(cz  d ), where

If w  T(z)  (az  b)/(cz  d ), we can solve for z to obtain z  (dw  b)   /(cw  a). Therefore 
the inverse of the linear fractional transformation T is T 1(w)  (dw  b)  /(cw  a) and we 
associate the adjoint of the matrix A,

has a zero at z  z1, a pole at z  z3, and T(z2)  1. Therefore, T(z) maps three distinct complex 
numbers z1, z2, and z3 to 0, 1, and q, respectively. The term z 2 z1
z 2 z3
 z2 2 z3
z2 2 z1
 is called the cross-ratio 
of the complex numbers z, z1, z2, and z3.
* The matrix A is not unique since the numerator and denominator in T(z) can be multiplied by a nonzero 
constant.

CHAPTER 20 Conformal Mappings
Likewise, the complex mapping S(w)  w 2 w1
w 2 w3
 w2 2 w3
w2 2 w1
 sends w1, w2, and w3 to 0, 1, and q, 
and so S1 maps 0, 1, and q to w1, w2, and w3. It follows that the linear fractional transformation 
w  S1(T(z)) maps the triple z1, z2, and z3 to w1, w2, and w3. From w  S1(T(z)), we have 
S(w)  T(z) and we can conclude that
 
w 2 w1
w 2 w3
 w2 2 w3
w2 2 w1
 z 2 z1
z 2 z3
 z2 2 z3
z2 2 z1
. 
(7)
In constructing a linear fractional transformation that maps the triple z1, z2, and z3 to w1, w2, 
and w3, we can use matrix methods to compute w  S1(T(z)). Alternatively, we can substitute 
into (7) and solve the resulting equation for w.
EXAMPLE 4 
Constructing a Linear Fractional Transformation
Construct a linear fractional transformation that maps the points 1, i, and 1 on the  circle 
ZzZ  1 to the points 1, 0, and 1 on the real axis.
SOLUTION Substituting into (7), we have
 w  1
w 2 1 0 2 1

z  1 i  1
i 2 1
or 
 w  1
w 2 1  i z 2 1
z  1.
Solving for w, we obtain w  i(z  i)/(z  i). Alternatively, we could use the matrix method 
to compute w  S1(T(z)).
When zk  q plays the role of one of the points in a triple, the definition of the cross-ratio is 
changed by replacing each factor that contains zk by 1. For example, if z2  q, both z2  z3 and 
z2  z1 are replaced by 1, giving (z  z1)/(z  z3) as the cross-ratio.
EXAMPLE 5 
Constructing a Linear Fractional Transformation
Construct a linear fractional transformation that maps the points q, 0, and 1 on the real axis 
to the points 1, i, and 1 on the circle ZwZ  1.
SOLUTION Since z1  q, the terms z  z1 and z2  z1 in the cross product are replaced by 1. 
It follows that
 
w 2 1

Solving a Dirichlet Problem

therefore map each boundary circle to a line by selecting a linear fractional transformation 
that has z  1 as a pole. If we further require that T(i)  0 and T(1)  1, then
 
T (z)  z 2 i

Since T(0)  1  i and T( 1

The harmonic function U(u, v)  v is the solution to the simplified Dirichlet problem in the

20.4 Schwarz–Christoffel Transformations
INTRODUCTION 
If D is a simply connected domain with at least one boundary point, then 
the famous Riemann mapping theorem asserts the existence of an analytic function g that 
conformally maps the unit open disk ZzZ  1 onto D. The Riemann mapping theorem is a pure 
existence theorem that does not specify a formula for the conformal mapping. Since the upper 
half-plane y  0 can be conformally mapped onto this disk using a linear fractional transforma-
tion, it follows that there exists a conformal mapping f between the upper half-plane and D. In 
particular, there are analytic functions that map the upper half-plane onto polygonal regions of 
the types shown in FIGURE 20.4.1. Unlike the Riemann mapping theorem, the Schwarz–Christoffel 
formula specifies a form for the derivative f (z) of a conformal mapping from the upper half-plane 
to a bounded or unbounded polygonal region.
 Special Cases To motivate the general Schwarz–Christoffel formula, we first examine 
the effect of the mapping f (z)  (z  x1)a/p, 0  a  2p, on the upper half-plane y  0 shown 
in FIGURE 20.4.2(a). This mapping is the composite of the translation   z  x1 and the real power 
function w  a/p. Since w  a/p changes the angle in a wedge by a factor of a/p, the interior 
angle in the image region is (a/p)p  a. See Figure 20.4.2(b).
Note that f (z)  A(z  x1)(a/p)1 for A  a/p. Next assume that f (z) is a function that is ana-
lytic in the upper half-plane and that has the derivative
 
f (z)  A(z  x1)(a1/p)1(z  x2)(a2/p)1,  
(1)
where x1  x2. In determining the images of line segments on the x-axis, we will use the fact that 
a curve w  w(t) in the w-plane is a line segment when the argument of its tangent vector w(t) 
is constant. From (1), an argument of f (t) is given by
 
arg f (t)  Arg A  aa1
p 2 1b Arg (t  x1)  aa2
p 2 1b Arg (t  x2). 
(2)
Since Arg(t  x)  p for t  x, we can find the variation of arg f (t) along the x-axis. The results 
are shown in the following table.
Interval 
arg f (t) 
Change in Argument 
 (q, x1) 
Arg A  (a1  p)  (a2  p) 
0
 (x1, x2) 
Arg A  (a2  p) 
p  a1
 (x2, q) 
Arg A 
p  a2
Since arg f (t) is constant on the intervals in the table, the images are line segments, and FIGURE 20.4.3 
shows the image of the upper half-plane. Note that the interior angles of the polygonal image region 
are a1 and a2. This discussion generalizes to produce the Schwarz–Christoffel formula.
Theorem 20.4.1 
Schwarz–Christoffel Formula
Let f (z) be a function that is analytic in the upper half-plane y  0 and that has the derivative
 
f (z)  A(z  x1)(a1/p)1(z  x2)(a2/p)1 … (z  xn)(an/p)1,  
(3)
where x1  x2  . . .   xn and each ai satisfies 0  ai  2p. Then f (z) maps the upper 
half-plane y  0 to a polygonal region with interior angles a1, a2, . . . ,  an.

In applying this formula to a particular polygonal target region, the reader should carefully 
note the following comments:
 (i) 
One can select the location of three of the points xk on the x-axis. A judicious choice can 
simplify the computation of f (z). The selection of the remaining points depends on the 
shape of the target polygon.
 (ii) A general formula for f (z) is
f (z)  A¢#(z 2 x1)(a1>p)21(z 2 x2)(a2>p)21 p (z 2 xn)(an>p)21 dz≤ B, 
 
 and therefore f (z) may be considered as the composite of the conformal mapping
g(z)  #(z 2 x1)(a1>p)21(z 2 x2)(a2>p)21 p (z 2 xn)(an>p)21 dz
 
 and the linear function w  Az  B. The linear function w  Az  B allows us to magnify, 
rotate, and translate the image polygon produced by g(z). (See Section 20.1.)
 (iii) If the polygonal region is bounded, only n  1 of the n interior angles should be included 
in the Schwarz–Christoffel formula. As an illustration, the interior angles a1, a2, a3, and 
a4 are sufficient to determine the Schwarz–Christoffel formula for the pentagon shown in 
Figure 20.4.1(a).
EXAMPLE 1 
Constructing a Conformal Mapping
Use the Schwarz–Christoffel formula to construct a conformal mapping from the upper half-
plane to the strip ZvZ  1, u  0.
SOLUTION We may select x1  1 and x2  1 on the x-axis, and we will construct a con-
formal mapping f  with f (1)  i and f (1)  i. See FIGURE 20.4.4. Since a1  a2  p/2, the 
Schwarz–Christoffel formula (3) gives
 
f 9(z)  A(z  1)1>2(z 2 1)1>2  A 
1
(z 2 2 1)1>2  A
i  
1
(1 2 z 2 )1>2.
Therefore, f (z)  Ai sin1z  B. Since f (1)  i and f (1)  i, we obtain, respectively, 
 
i  Ai p
2  B  and  i  Ai p
2  B
and conclude that B  0 and A  2/p. Thus, f (z)  (2/p)i sin1z.
EXAMPLE 2 
Constructing a Conformal Mapping
Use the Schwarz–Christoffel formula to construct a conformal mapping from the upper half-
plane to the region shown in FIGURE 20.4.5(b).
SOLUTION We again select x1  1 and x2  1, and we will require that f (1)  ai
and f (1)  0. Since a1  3p/2 and a2  p/2, the Schwarz–Christoffel formula (3) gives
 
f (z)  A(z  1)1/2(z  1)1/2.
If we write f (z) as A(z/(z2  1)1/2  1/(z2  1)1/2), it follows that
 
f (z)  A[(z2  1)1/2  cosh1z]  B.
Note that cosh1(1)  pi and cosh1 1  0, and so ai  f (1)  A(pi)  B and 0  f (1)  B. 
Therefore, A  a/p and f (z)  (a/p)[(z2  1)1/2  cosh1z].
The next example will show that it may not always be possible to find f (z) in terms of 
elementary functions.

SOLUTION Since the polygonal region is bounded, only two of the three 60
 interior angles 
should be included in the Schwarz–Christoffel formula. If x1  0 and x2  1, we 
obtain f (z)  Az2/3(z  1)2/3. It is not possible to evaluate f (z) in terms of elementary func-
tions; however, we can use Theorem 18.3.3 to construct the antiderivative

The Schwarz–Christoffel formula can sometimes be used to suggest a possible conformal 
mapping from the upper half-plane onto a nonpolygonal region R. A key first step is to approxi-
mate R by polygonal regions. This will be illustrated in the final example.
EXAMPLE 4 
Constructing a Conformal Mapping
Use the Schwarz–Christoffel formula to construct a conformal mapping from the upper half-
plane to the upper half-plane with the horizontal line v  p, u  0, deleted.
SOLUTION The nonpolygonal target region can be approximated by a polygonal region by 
adjoining a line segment from w  pi to a point u0 on the negative u-axis. See FIGURE 20.4.7(b). 
If we require that f (1)  pi and f (0)  u0, the Schwarz–Christoffel transformation satisfies
 
f 9(z)  A(z  1)(a1>p)21z (a2>p)21.
Note that as u0 approaches q, the interior angles a1 and a2 approach 2p and 0, respectively. 
This suggests we examine conformal mappings that satisfy w  A(z  1)1z1  A(1  1/z) 
or w  A(z  Ln z)  B.
We will first determine the image of the upper half-plane under g(z)  z  Ln z and then 
translate the image region if needed. For t real, 
 
g(t)  t  logeZtZ  i Arg t.
If t  0, Arg t  p and u(t)  t  logeZtZ varies from q to 1. It follows that w  g(t) moves 
along the line v  p from q to 1. When t  0, Arg t  0 and u(t) varies from q to q. 
Therefore, g maps the positive x-axis onto the u-axis. We can conclude that g(z)  z  Ln z maps

Therefore, w  z  Ln z  1 maps the upper half-plane onto the original target region.
Many of the conformal mappings in Appendix IV can be derived using the Schwarz–Christoffel 
formula, and we will show in Section 20.6 that these mappings are especially useful in analyzing 
two-dimensional fluid flows.
In Problems 1–4, use (2) to describe the image of the upper 
half-plane y  0 under the conformal mapping w  f (z) that 
satisfies the given conditions. Do not attempt to find f (z).

20.5 Poisson Integral Formulas
INTRODUCTION 
The success of the conformal mapping method depends on the recognition 
of the solution to the new Dirichlet problem in the image region R. It would therefore be helpful 
if a general solution could be found for Dirichlet problems in either the upper half-plane y  0 
or the unit disk ZzZ  1. The Poisson integral formula for the upper half-plane provides such a 
solution by expressing the value of a harmonic function u(x, y) at a point in the interior of the 
upper half-plane in terms of its values on the boundary y  0.
 Formulas for the Upper Half-Plane To develop the formula, we first assume that the 
boundary function is given by u(x, 0)  f (x), where f (x) is the step function indicated in FIGURE 20.5.1. 
The solution of the corresponding Dirichlet problem in the upper half-plane is
 
u(x, y)  ui
p [Arg (z  b)  Arg (z  a)]. 
(1)
Since Arg(z  b) is an exterior angle in the triangle formed by z, a, and b, Arg(z  b)  u(z)  
Arg(z  a), where 0  u(z)  p, and we can write
 
u(x, y)  ui
p u(z)  ui
p Arg az 2 b
z 2 ab. 
(2)
The superposition principle can be used to solve the more general Dirichlet problem in 
FIGURE 20.5.2. If u(x, 0)  ui for xi1  x  xi and u(x, 0)  0 outside the interval [a, b], then

A bounded piecewise-continuous function can be approximated by step functions, and therefore 
our discussion suggests that (4) is the solution to the Dirichlet problem in the upper half-plane. 
This is the content of Theorem 20.5.1.
Theorem 20.5.1 
Poisson Integral Formula for the Upper Half-Plane
Let u(x, 0) be a piecewise-continuous function on every finite interval and bounded on 
q  x  q. Then the function defined by
 
u(x, y)  y

q
 
u(t, 0)

is the solution of the corresponding Dirichlet problem on the upper half-plane y  0.
There are a few functions for which it is possible to evaluate the integral in (4), but in general, 
numerical methods are required to evaluate the integral.
EXAMPLE 1 
Solving a Dirichlet Problem
Find the solution of the Dirichlet problem in the upper half-plane that satisfies the boundary 
condition u(x, 0)  x when ZxZ  1, and u(x, 0)  0 otherwise.

In most of the examples and exercises u(x, 0) is a step function, and we will use the integrated 
solution (3) rather than (4). If the first interval is (q, x1), then the term Arg(z  x1)  Arg(z  a) 
in the sum should be replaced by Arg(z  x1). Likewise, if the last interval is (xn1, q), then 
Arg(z  b)  Arg(z  xn1) should be replaced by p  Arg(z  xn1).
EXAMPLE 2 
Solving a Dirichlet Problem
The conformal mapping f (z)  z  1/z maps the region in the upper half-plane and outside 
the circle ZzZ  1 onto the upper half-plane v  0. Use this mapping and the Poisson integral 
formula to solve the Dirichlet problem shown in FIGURE 20.5.3(a).
SOLUTION Using the results of Example 3 in Section 20.2, we can transfer the boundary 
conditions to the w-plane. See Figure 20.5.3(b). Since U(u, 0) is a step function, we will use the 
integrated solution (3) rather than the Poisson integral. The solution to the new Dirichlet problem is

 Formula for the Unit Disk A Poisson integral formula can also be developed to solve 
the general Dirichlet problem for the unit disk.
Theorem 20.5.2 
 Poisson Integral Formula for the Unit Disk
Let u(eiu ) be bounded and piecewise continuous for p  u  p. Then the solution to the 
corresponding Dirichlet problem on the open unit disk ZzZ  1 is given by
u(x, y)  1

 Geometric Interpretation 
FIGURE 20.5.4 shows a thin membrane (such as a soap film) 
that has been stretched across a frame defined by u  u(eiu ). The displacement u in the direction 
perpendicular to the z-plane satisfies the two-dimensional wave equation

and so at equilibrium, the displacement function u  u(x, y) is harmonic. Formula (5) provides 
an explicit solution for the displacement u and has the advantage that the integral is over the finite 
interval [p, p]. When the integral cannot be evaluated, standard numerical integration proce-
dures can be used to estimate u(x, y) at a fixed point z  x  iy with ZzZ  1.
EXAMPLE 3 
Displacement of a Membrane
A frame for a membrane is defined by u(eiu )  ZuZ for p  u  p. Estimate the equilibrium 
displacement of the membrane at (0.5, 0), (0, 0), and (0.5, 0).

For the other two values of (x, y), the integral is not elementary and must be estimated using 
a numerical integration procedure. Using Simpson’s rule, we obtain (to four decimal places) 
u(0.5, 0)  2.2269 and u(0.5, 0)  0.9147.
 Fourier Series Form The Poisson integral formula for the unit disk is actually a compact 
way of writing the Fourier series solution to Laplace’s equation that we developed in Chapter 
14. To see this, first note that un(r, u)  r n cos nu and vn(r, u)  r n sin nu are each harmonic, 
since these functions are the real and imaginary parts of zn. If a0, an, and bn are chosen to be the 
Fourier coefficients of u(eiu ) for p  u  p, then, by the superposition principle, 
 
u(r, u)  a0

EXAMPLE 4 
Solving a Dirichlet Problem
Find the solution of the Dirichlet problem in the unit disk satisfying the boundary condition 
u(eiu )  sin 4u. Sketch the level curve u  0.
SOLUTION Rather than working with the Poisson integral (5), we will use the Fourier series 
solution (6), which reduces to u(r, u)  r4 sin 4u. Therefore, u  0 if and only if sin 4u  0. 
This implies u  0 on the lines x  0, y  0, and y  x.
If we switch to rectangular coordinates, u(x, y)  4xy(x2  y2). The surface u(x, y)  4xy(x2  y2), 
the frame u(eiu )  sin 4u, and the system of level curves were sketched using graphics software

20.6 Applications
INTRODUCTION 
In Sections 20.2, 20.3, and 20.5 we demonstrated how Laplace’s partial 
differential equation can be solved with conformal mapping methods, and we interpreted a solu-
tion u  u(x, y) of the Dirichlet problem as either the steady-state temperature at the point (x, y) 
or the equilibrium displacement of a membrane at the point (x, y). Laplace’s equation is a 
fundamental partial differential equation that arises in a variety of contexts. In this section we 
will establish a general relationship between vector fields and analytic functions and use 
our conformal mapping techniques to solve problems involving electrostatic force fields and 
two-dimensional fluid flows.
 Vector Fields A vector field F(x, y)  P(x, y)i  Q(x, y)j in a domain D can also be 
expressed in the complex form
 
F(x, y)  P(x, y)  iQ(x, y)
and thought of as a complex function. Recall from Chapter 9 that div F  P/x  Q/y and 
curl F  (Q/x  P/y)k. If we require that both div F  0 and curl F  0, then
 
0P
0x  0Q
0y  and  0P
0y  0Q
0x . 
(1)
This set of equations is reminiscent of the Cauchy–Riemann criterion for analyticity presented 
in Theorem 17.5.2 and suggests that we examine the complex function g(z)  P(x, y)  iQ(x, y).
Theorem 20.6.1 
Vector Fields and Analyticity
(i) Suppose that F(x, y)  P(x, y)  iQ(x, y) is a vector field in a domain D and P(x, y) and 
Q(x, y) are continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in D. If div F  0 and 
curl F  0, then the complex function
 
g(z)  P(x, y)  iQ(x, y)
is analytic in D.
(ii) Conversely, if g(z) is analytic in D, then F(x, y)  g(z) defines a vector field in D for 
which div F  0 and curl F  0.
PROOF: If u(x, y) and v(x, y) denote the real and imaginary parts of g(z), then u  P and v  Q. 
Therefore the equations in (1) are equivalent to the equations
 
0u
0x  0(v)
0y   and  0u
0y  0(v)
0x ;

EXAMPLE 2 
Analytic Function Gives a Vector Field
The complex function g(z)  Az, A  0, is analytic in the first quadrant and therefore gives 
rise to the vector field V(x, y)  g(z)  Ax  iAy, which satisfies div V  0 and curl V  0. 
We will show toward the end of this section that V(x, y) may be interpreted as the velocity of 
a fluid that moves around the corner produced by the boundary of the first quadrant.
The physical interpretation of the conditions div F  0 and curl F  0 depends on the setting. 
If F(x, y) represents the force in an electric field that acts on a unit test charge placed at (x, y), 
then, by Theorem 9.9.2, curl F  0 if and only if the field is conservative. The work done in 
transporting a test charge between two points in D must be independent of the path.
If C is a simple closed contour that lies in D, Gauss’s law asserts that the line integral C (F  n) ds 
is proportional to the total charge enclosed by the curve C. If D is simply connected and all the 
electric charge is distributed on the boundary of D, then C (F  n) ds  0 for any simple closed 
contour in D. By the divergence theorem in the form (1) of Section 9.16, 
 
BC
(F   n) ds  6
 
R
div F dA,  
(3)
where R is the region enclosed by C, and we can conclude that div F  0 in D. Conversely, if 
div F  0 in D, the double integral is zero and therefore the domain D contains no charge.
that is,  
0u
0x  0v
0y   and   0u
0y  0v
0x. 
(2)
The equations in (2) are the Cauchy–Riemann equations for analyticity.
EXAMPLE 1 
Vector Field Gives an Analytic Function
The vector field defined by F(x, y)  (kq/Zz  z0Z 2)(z  z0) may be interpreted as the electric 
field produced by a wire that is perpendicular to the z-plane at z  z0 and carries a charge of 
q coulombs per unit length. The corresponding complex function is
g(z) 
kq
Zz 2 z0Z2 (z 2 z0)  kq
z 2 z0
.
Since g(z) is analytic for z 	 z0, div F  0 and curl F  0.
 Potential Functions Suppose that F(x, y) is a vector field in a simply connected domain 
D with both div F  0 and curl F  0. By Theorem 18.3.3, the analytic function g(z)  P(x, y)  iQ(x, y) 
has an antiderivative
 
G(z)  f(x, y)  ic(x, y) 
(4)
in D, which is called a complex potential for the vector field F. Note that
g(z)  G9(z)  0f
0x  i 0c
0x  0f
0x 2 i 0f
0y
and so 
0f
0x  P  and  0f
0y  Q. 
(5)
Therefore, F  f and, as in Section 9.9, the harmonic function f is called a (real) potential 
function for F.* When the potential f is specified on the boundary of a region R, we can use 
conformal mapping techniques to solve the resulting Dirichlet problem. The equipotential lines 
f(x, y)  c can be sketched and the vector field F can be determined using (5).
*If F is an electric field, the electric potential function  is defined to be f and F  .

EXAMPLE 3 
Complex Potential
The potential f in the half-plane x  0 satisfies the boundary conditions f(0, y)  0 and 
f(x, 0)  1 for x  1. See FIGURE 20.6.1(a). Determine a complex potential, the equipotential 
lines, and the force field F.
SOLUTION We saw in Example 2 of Section 20.2 that the analytic function z  sin w maps 
the strip 0  u  p/2 in the w-plane to the region R in question. Therefore, f (z)  sin1z maps 
R onto the strip, and Figure 20.6.1(b) shows the transferred boundary conditions. The simpli-
fied Dirichlet problem has the solution U(u, v)  (2/p)u, and so f(x, y)  U(sin1z) 
Re ((2/p) sin1z) is the potential function on D, and G(z)  (2/p) u sin1z is a complex potential 
for the force field F.
Note that the equipotential lines f  c are the images of the equipotential lines U  c in 
the w-plane under the inverse mapping z  sin w. In Example 2 of Section 20.2 we showed 
that the vertical line u  a is mapped onto a branch of the hyperbola
 
x
 2
 sin 2a 2

 cos 2a  1.
Since the equipotential line U  c, 0  c  1, is the vertical line u  p/2c, it follows that the 
equipotential line f  c is the right branch of the hyperbola

Since F  G9(z) and d/dz sin1z  1/(1  z2)1/2, the force field is given by
 
F  2

 Steady-State Fluid Flow The vector V(x, y)  P(x, y)  iQ(x, y) may also be interpreted 
as the velocity vector of a two-dimensional steady-state fluid flow at a point (x, y) in a domain D. 
The velocity at all points in the domain is therefore independent of time, and all movement takes 
place in planes that are parallel to a z-plane.
The physical interpretation of the conditions div V  0 and curl V  0 was discussed in 
Section 9.7. Recall that if curl V  0 in D, the flow is called irrotational. If a small circular 
paddle wheel is placed in the fluid, the net angular velocity on the boundary of the wheel is zero, 
and so the wheel will not rotate. If div V  0 in D, the flow is called incompressible. In a simply 
connected domain D, an incompressible flow has the special property that the amount of fluid 
in the interior of any simple closed contour C is independent of time. The rate at which fluid 
enters the interior of C matches the rate at which it leaves, and consequently there can be no fluid 
sources or sinks at points in D.
If div V  0 and curl V  0, V has a complex velocity potential
 
G(z)  f(x, y)  ic(x, y)
that satisfies G9(z)  V. In this setting, special importance is placed on the level curves c(x, y)  c. 
If z(t)  x(t)  iy(t) is the path of a particle (such as a small cork) that has been placed in the 
fluid, then
 
 dx
dt  P(x, y) 
(6)
 
 dy
dt  Q(x, y).
Hence, dy/dx  Q(x, y)/P(x, y) or Q(x, y) dx  P(x, y) dy  0. This differential equation is 
exact, since div V  0 implies (Q)/y  P/x. By the Cauchy–Riemann equations, 
c/x  f/y  Q and c/y  f/x  P, and therefore all solutions of (6) satisfy 
c(x, y)  c. The function c(x, y) is therefore called a stream function and the level curves 
c(x, y)  c are streamlines for the flow.

EXAMPLE 4 
Uniform Flow
The uniform flow in the upper half-plane is defined by V(x, y)  A(1, 0), where A is a fixed 
positive constant. Note that ZVZ  A, and so a particle in the fluid moves at a constant speed. 
A complex potential for the vector field is G(z)  Az  Ax  iAy, and so the streamlines are 
the horizontal lines Ay  c. See FIGURE 20.6.2(a). Note that the boundary y  0 of the region is 
itself a streamline.
EXAMPLE 5 
Flow Around a Corner
The analytic function G(z)  z2 gives rise to the vector field V(x, y)  G9(z)  (2x, 2y) in 
the first quadrant. Since z2  x2  y2  i(2xy), the stream function is c(x, y)  2xy and the 
streamlines are the hyperbolas 2xy  c. This flow, called flow around a corner, is depicted in 
Figure 20.6.2(b). As in Example 4, the boundary lines x  0 and y  0 in the first quadrant 
are themselves streamlines.
 Constructing Special Flows The process of constructing an irrotational and incompress-
ible flow that remains inside a given region R is called streamlining. Since the streamlines are de-
scribed by c(x, y)  c, two distinct streamlines do not intersect. Therefore, if the boundary is itself a 
streamline, a particle that starts inside R cannot leave R. This is the content of the following theorem:
Theorem 20.6.2 
Streamlining
Suppose that G(z)  f(x, y)  ic(x, y) is analytic in a region R and c(x, y) is constant on the 
boundary of R. Then V(x, y)  G9(z) defines an irrotational and incompressible fluid flow in R. 
Moreover, if a particle is placed inside R, its path z  z(t) remains in R.
EXAMPLE 6 
Flow Around a Cylinder
The analytic function G(z)  z  1/z maps the region R in the upper half-plane and outside 
the circle ZzZ  1 onto the upper half-plane v  0. The boundary of R is mapped onto the u-
axis, and so v  c(x, y)  y  y/(x2  y2) is zero on the boundary of R. FIGURE 20.6.3 shows 
the streamlines of the resulting flow. The velocity field is given by G9(z)  1  1/ z 2, and so
 
G9(reiu )  1 2 1
r 2 e2iu.
It follows that V  (1, 0) for large values of r, and so the flow is approximately uniform at large 
distances from the circle ZzZ  1. The resulting flow in the region R is called flow around a cylinder. 
The mirror image of the flow can be adjoined to give a flow around a complete cylinder.
If R is a polygonal region, we can use the Schwarz–Christoffel formula to find a conformal 
mapping z  f (w) from the upper half-plane R onto R. The inverse function G(z)  f 1(z) maps 
the boundary of R onto the u-axis. Therefore, if G(z)  f(x, y)  ic(x, y), then c(x, y)  0 on 
the boundary of R. Note that the streamlines c(x, y)  c in the z-plane are the images of the hori-
zontal lines v  c in the w-plane under z  f (w).
EXAMPLE 7 
Streamlines Defined Parametrically
The analytic function f (w)  w  Ln w  1 maps the upper half-plane v  0 to the upper 
half-plane y  0 with the horizontal line y  p, x  0, deleted. See Example 4 in Section 20.4. 
If G(z)  f 1(z)  f(x, y)  ic (x, y), then G(z) maps R onto the upper half-plane and maps 
the boundary of R onto the u-axis. Therefore, c (x, y)  0 on the boundary of R.
It is not possible to find an explicit formula for the stream function c (x, y). The streamlines, 
however, are the images of the horizontal lines v  c under z  f (w). If we write w  t  ic, 
c  0, then the streamlines can be represented in the parametric form
 
z  f (t  ic)  t  ic  Ln(t  ic)  1; 
that is,  
x  t  1  1
2 loge (t 2  c2), y  c  Arg(t  ic).

CHAPTER 20 Conformal Mappings
A stream function c (x, y) is harmonic but, unlike a solution to a Dirichlet problem, we do not
require c (x, y) to be bounded (see Examples 4–6) or to assume a fixed set of constants on the 
boundary. Therefore, there may be many different stream functions for a given region that satisfy 
Theorem 20.6.2. This will be illustrated in the final example.
EXAMPLE 8 
Streamlines Defined Parametrically
The analytic function f (w)  w  ew  1 maps the horizontal strip 0  v  p onto the 
region R shown in Figure 20.6.4. Therefore, G(z)  f 1(z)  f(x, y)  ic(x, y) maps R back 
to the strip and, from M-1 in the conformal mappings in Appendix IV, maps the boundary 
line y  0 onto the u-axis and maps the boundary line y  p, x  0, onto the horizontal line 
v  p. Therefore, c(x, y) is constant on the boundary of R.
The streamlines are the images of the horizontal lines v  c, 0  c  p, under z  f (w). 
As in Example 7, a parametric representation of the streamlines is
 
z  f (t  ic)  t  ic  etic  1
or 
x  t  1  et cos c,  y  c  et sin c.
The streamlines are shown in FIGURE 20.6.5. Unlike the flow in Example 7, the fluid  appears 
to emerge from the strip 0  y  p, x  0.

(2)
that we saw in Section 5.3 can be obtained from (1) by employing integration by parts. Now 
when x  1, 
 
 G(1)  #
q
0
etdt  1,
and thus (2) gives 
 G(2)  1G(1)  1
 
 G(3)  2G(2)  2 1
 
 G(4)  3G(3)  3 2 1,
and so on. In this manner it is seen that when n is a positive integer, 
 
G(n  1)  n!.
For this reason the gamma function is often called the generalized factorial function.
Although the integral form (1) does not converge for x  0, it can be shown by means of 
 alternative definitions that the gamma function is defined for all real and complex numbers except 
x  n, n  0, 1, 2, … . As a consequence, (2) is actually valid for x  n. Considered as 
a function of a real variable x, the graph of 	(x) is as given in FIGURE A.1. Observe that the 
nonpositive integers correspond to the vertical asymptotes of the graph.
In Problems 31 and 32 in Exercises 5.3, we utilized the fact that 	(1
2)  !p. This result can 
be derived from (1) by setting x  1
2:
 
G(1
2)  #
q

t1>2et dt. 
(3)
By letting t  u2, we can write (3) as
 
G(1

Switching to polar coordinates u  r cos u, v  r sin u enables us to evaluate the double integral:

Hence,  
fG(1

    or        	( 1
2– )  !p. 
(4)
In view of (2) and (4) we can find additional values of the gamma function. For example, when 
x   1
2, it follows from (2) that 	( 1
2 )   1
2 	( 1

 6. Use (1) to derive (2) for x  0.
 7. A definition of the gamma function due to Carl Friedrich Gauss that is valid for all real 
numbers, except x  0, x  1, x  2, p, is given by
 
G(x)   lim

n!  nx
x (x  1)(x  2) p  (x  n).
Use this definition to show that 	(x  1)  x 	(x).

the target at t  0. Then rp  rt when t  x0  /(v0 cos u)  
y0  /(v0 sin u). This implies tan u  y0 /x0. In other words, 
aim directly at the target at t  0.

 1. (a)  If X(0)  X0 lies on the line y  2x, then X(t) ap-
proaches (0, 0) along this line. For all other initial 
conditions, X(t) approaches (0, 0) from the direc-
tion determined by the line y  x/2.
 3. (a)  All solutions are unstable spirals that become un-
bounded as t increases.
 5. (a)  All solutions approach (0, 0) from the direction 
specified by the line y  x.
 7. (a)  If X(0)  X0 lies on the line y  3x, then X(t) ap-
proaches (0, 0) along this line. For all other initial 
conditions, X(t) becomes unbounded and y  x 
serves as the asymptote.
