KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
ASSIGNMENT 10.2
1. Let A = {r ∈Q | r > 0 ∧r2 > 3}. Show that A has a lower bound in Q but no greatest lower bound
in Q. Give all details of the proof along the lines of the proof given in the lecture that the rationals
are not complete.
2. In addition to the completeness property, the Archimedean property is an important fundamental
property of R. It says is that if x, y ∈R and x, y > 0, there is an n ∈N such that nx > y.
Use the Archimedean property to show that if r, s ∈R and r < s, there is a q ∈Q such that r < q < s.
(Hint: pick n ∈N, n > 1/(s −r), and ﬁnd an m ∈N such that r < (m/n) < s.)
3. Formulate both in symbols and in words what it means to say that an ̸→a as n →∞.
4. Prove that (n/(n + 1))2 →1 as n →∞.
5. Prove that 1/n2 →0 as n →∞.
6. Prove that 1/2n →0 as n →∞.
7. We say a sequence {an}∞
n=1 tends to inﬁnity if, as n increases, an increases without bound. For instance,
the sequence {n}∞
n=1 tends to inﬁnity, as does the sequence {2n}∞
n=1. Formulate a precise deﬁnition of
this notion, and prove that both of these examples fulﬁl the deﬁnition.
8. Let {an}∞
n=1 be an increasing sequence (i.e. an < an+1 for each n). Suppose that an →a as n →∞.
Prove that a = lub{an|n ∈N}.
9. Prove that if {an}∞
n=1 is increasing and bounded above, then it tends to a limit.
