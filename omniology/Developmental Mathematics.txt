P R E FA C E
Developmental Mathematics for College Students, Third Edition, is more than a simple
upgrade of the second edition. Substantial changes have been made to the worked
example structure, the Study Sets, and the pedagogy. Throughout the revision process,
our objective has been to ease teaching challenges and meet students’ educational needs.
Mathematics, for many of today’s developmental math students, is like a foreign
language. They have difﬁculty translating the words, their meanings, and how they
apply to problem solving. With these needs in mind (and as educational research
suggests), our fundamental goal is to have students read, write, think, and speak
using the language of mathematics. Instructional approaches that include vocabulary,
practice, and well-deﬁned pedagogy, along with an emphasis on reasoning, modeling,
communication, and technology skills have been blended to address this need.
The most common question that students ask as they watch their instructors solve
problems and as they read the textbook is p Why? The new third edition addresses
this question in a unique way. Experience teaches us that it’s not enough to know how
a problem is solved. Students gain a deeper understanding of algebraic concepts if
they know why a particular approach is taken. This instructional truth was the
motivation for adding a Strategy and Why explanation to the solution of each worked
example.The third edition now provides, on a consistent basis, a concise answer to that
all-important question: Why?
These are just two of several reasons we trust
that this revision will make this course a better
experience for both instructors and students.
NEW TO THIS EDITION
• New Chapter Openers
• New Worked Example Structure
• New Calculation Notes in Examples
• New Five-Step Problem-Solving Strategy
• New Study Skills Workshop Module
• New Language of Mathematics,
Language of Algebra, Success Tip,
and Caution Boxes
• New Chapter Objectives
• New Guided Practice and Try It Yourself
Sections in the Study Sets
• New Chapter Summary and Review
• New Study Skills Checklists
Chapter Openers That Answer the Question:
When Will I Use This?
Instructors are asked this question time and again
by students. In response, we have written chapter
openers called From Campus to Careers. This
feature highlights vocations that require various
algebraic skills. Designed to inspire career
exploration, each includes job outlook,
educational requirements, and annual earnings
information. Careers presented in the openers are
tied to an exercise found later in the Study Sets.

from Campus to Careers
School Guidance Counselor
School guidance counselors plan academic programs and help students choose
the best courses to take to achieve their educational goals.
Counselors often meet with students to discuss the life
skills needed for personal and social growth. To prepare
for this career,guidance counselors take classes in an area
of mathematics called statistics, where they learn how to
collect,analyze,explain,and present data.
In Problem 109 of Study Set 3.4, you will see how a
counselor must be able to add fractions to better understand
a graph that shows students’study habits.
Fractions and Mixed
Numbers
JOB TITLE:
School Guidance Counselor
EDUCATION:A master’s degree is usually
required to be licensed as a counselor.
However,some schools accept a bachelor’s
degree with the appropriate counseling
courses.
JOB OUTLOOK:Excellent.
ANNUAL EARNINGS:The average (median)
salary in 2006 was $53,750.

Examples That Tell Students Not Just How,But WHY
Why? That question is often asked by students as they watch their
instructor solve problems in class and as they are working on
problems at home. It’s not enough to know how a problem is
solved. Students gain a deeper understanding of the algebraic
concepts if they know why a particular approach was taken.This
instructional truth was the motivation for adding a Strategy and
Why explanation to each worked example.
Examples That Offer Immediate Feedback
Each worked example includes a Self Check. These can be
completed by students on their own or as classroom lecture
examples, which is how Alan Tussy uses them.Alan asks selected
students to read aloud the Self Check problems as he writes what
the student says on the board.The other students, with their
books open to that page, can quickly copy the Self Check
problem to their notes.This speeds up the note-taking process
and encourages student participation in his lectures. It also
teaches students how to read mathematical symbols. Each Self
Check answer is printed adjacent to the corresponding problem
in the Annotated Instructor’s Edition for easy reference. Self
Check solutions can be found at the end of each section in the
student edition before each Study Set.
Examples That Ask Students to Work Independently
Each worked example ends with a Now Try problem.These are
the ﬁnal step in the learning process. Each one is linked to a
similar problem found within the Guided Practice section of the
Study Sets.
EXAMPLE 12
Evaluate:
Strategy We will ﬁnd the decimal equivalent of
and then evaluate the 
expression in terms of decimals.
WHY Its easier to perform multiplication and addition with the given decimals
than it would be converting them to fractions.
Solution We use division to ﬁnd the decimal equivalent of
.
Write a decimal point and one additional zero to the right of the 4.
Now we use the order of operation rule to evaluate the expression.
Replace with its decimal equivalent, 0.8.
Evaluate: (0.5)2  0.25.
Do the multiplication: (0.8)(1.35)  1.08.

Examples That Show the Behind-the-Scenes Calculations 
Some steps of the solutions to worked examples in
Developmental Mathematics for College Students involve
arithmetic calculations that are too complicated to be
performed mentally. In these instances, we have shown the
actual computations that must be made to complete the
formal solution.These computations appear directly to the
right of the author notes and are separated from them by a
thin, gray rule.The necessary addition, subtraction,
multiplication, or division (usually done on scratch paper) is
placed at the appropriate stage of the solution where such a
computation is required. Rather than simply list the steps of a
solution horizontally, making no mention of how the
numerical values within the solution are obtained, this unique
feature will help answer the often-heard question from a
struggling student,“How did you get that answer?” It also
serves as a model for the calculations that students must
perform independently to solve the problems in the 
Study Sets.
Emphasis on Problem-Solving
New to Developmental Mathematics for College Students, the
ﬁve-step problem-solving strategy guides students through
applied worked examples using the Analyze, Form, Solve,
State, and Check process.This approach clariﬁes the thought
process and mathematical skills necessary to solve a wide
variety of problems.As a result, students’ conﬁdence is
increased and their problem-solving abilities are
strengthened.

Strategy for Problem Solving
1.
Analyze the problem by reading it carefully.What information is given?
What are you asked to ﬁnd? What vocabulary is given? Often, a diagram
or table will help you visualize the facts of the problem.
2.
Form a plan by translating the words of the problem to numbers and
symbols.
3.
Solve the problem by performing the calculations.
4.
State the conclusion clearly. Be sure to include the units (such as feet,
seconds, or pounds) in your answer.
5.
Check the result. An estimate is often helpful to see whether an answer is
reasonable.

Preface
Emphasis on Study Skills
Developmental Mathematics for College Students begins with a
Study Skills Workshop module. Instead of simple, unrelated
suggestions printed in the margins, this module contains one-page
discussions of study skills topics followed by a Now Try This
section offering students actionable skills, assignments, and
projects that will impact their study habits throughout the course.
Study Skills Workshop
S-2
Now Try This
1. List six ways in which you will beneﬁt from passing this course.
2. List six short-term goals that will help you achieve your larger goal of passing this
course. For example, you could set a goal to read through the entire Study Skills
Workshop within the ﬁrst 2 weeks of class or attend class regularly and on time.
(Success Tip: Revisit this action item once you have read through all seven Study Skills
Workshop learning objectives.)
3. List some simple ways you can reward yourself when you complete one of your short-
term class goals.
4. Plan ahead! List ﬁve possible situations that could cause you to be late for class or miss
a class. (Some examples are parking/trafﬁc delays, lack of a babysitter, oversleeping, or
job responsibilities.) What can you do ahead of time so that these situations won’t cause
you to be late or absent?
Starting a new course is exciting, but it also may be a
little frightening. Like any new opportunity, in order to be
successful, it will require a commitment of both time and
resources.You can decrease the anxiety of this commitment
by having a plan to deal with these added responsibilities.
Set Your Goals for the Course.
Explore the reasons why you are taking this
course.What do you hope to gain upon completion? Is this course a prerequisite for further
study in mathematics? Maybe you need to complete this course in order to begin taking
coursework related to your ﬁeld of study. No matter what your reasons, setting goals for
yourself will increase your chances of success. Establish your ultimate goal and then break it
down into a series of smaller goals; it is easier to achieve a series of short-term goals rather
than focusing on one larger goal.
Keep a Positive Attitude.
Since your level of effort is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by your
attitude, strive to maintain a positive mental outlook throughout the class. From time to
time, remind yourself of the ways in which you will beneﬁt from passing the course.
Overcome feelings of stress or math anxiety with extra preparation, campus support
services, and activities you enjoy.When you accomplish short-term goals such as studying
for a speciﬁc period of time, learning a difﬁcult concept, or completing a homework
assignment, reward yourself by spending time with friends, listening to music, reading a
novel, or playing a sport.
Attend Each Class.
Many students don’t realize that missing even one class can
have a great effect on their grade.Arriving late takes its toll as well. If you are just a few
minutes late, or miss an entire class, you risk getting behind. So, keep these tips in mind.
• Arrive on time, or a little early.
• If you must miss a class, get a set of notes, the homework assignments, and any
handouts that the instructor may have provided for the day that you missed.
• Study the material you missed.Take advantage of the help that comes with this
textbook, such as the video examples and problem-speciﬁc tutorials.

The answers from Example 2 and the Self Check illustrate an
important fact about slope: The same value for the slope of a line will result no
matter which two points on the line are used to determine the rise and the run.

Thoroughly Revised Study Sets
The Study Sets have been thoroughly revised to ensure
that every example type covered in the section is
represented in the Guided Practice problems. Particular
attention was paid to developing a gradual level of
progression within problem types.
Guided Practice Problems
All of the problems in the Guided Practice portion of
the Study Sets are linked to an associated worked
example or objective from that section.This feature
promotes student success by referring them to the
proper worked example(s) or objective(s) if they
encounter difﬁculties solving homework problems.
Try It Yourself
To promote problem recognition, many Study Sets now include a collection of
Try It Yourself problems that do not link to worked examples.These problem
types are thoroughly mixed, giving students an opportunity to practice
decision making and strategy selection as they would when taking a test or
quiz.

Study Skills That Point Out Common Student Mistakes
In Chapter 1, we have included four Study Skills
Checklists designed to actively show students how 
to effectively use the key features in this text.
Subsequent chapters include one checklist just
before the Chapter Summary and Review that
provides another layer of preparation to promote
student success.These Study Skills Checklists warn
students of common errors, giving them time to
consider these pitfalls before taking their exam.
Comprehensive End-of-Chapter Summary
with Integrated Chapter Review
The end-of-chapter material has been
redesigned to function as a complete study
guide for students. New chapter summaries
that include deﬁnitions, concepts, and
examples, by section, have been written.
Review problems for each section
immediately follow the summary for that
section. Students will ﬁnd the detailed
summaries a very valuable study aid when
preparing for exams.

Ratios and Rates
Ratios are often used to describe important
relationships between two quantities.
A ratio is the quotient of two numbers or the
quotient of two quantities that have the same
units.
Ratios are written in three ways: as fractions, in
words separated by the word to, and using a
colon.
DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS 
EXAMPLES
The ratio 4 to 5 can be written as .
The ratio 5 : 12 can be written as

To write a ratio as a fraction, write the ﬁrst
number (or quantity) mentioned as the
numerator and the second number (or
quantity) mentioned as the denominator.Then
simplify the fraction, if possible.
Write the ratio 30 to 36 as a fraction in simplest form.

TRUSTED FEATURES
• Study Sets found in each section offer a multifaceted approach to practicing
and reinforcing the concepts taught in each section.They are designed for
students to methodically build their knowledge of the section concepts, from
basic recall to increasingly complex problem solving, through reading,
writing, and thinking mathematically.
Vocabulary—Each Study Set begins with the important Vocabulary
discussed in that section.The ﬁll-in-the-blank vocabulary problems
emphasize the main concepts taught in the chapter and provide the
foundation for learning and communicating the language of algebra.
Concepts—In Concepts, students are asked about the speciﬁc subskills
and procedures necessary to successfully complete the Guided Practice
and Try It Yourself problems that follow.
Notation—In Notation, the students review the new symbols introduced
in a section. Often, they are asked to ﬁll in steps of a sample solution.
This strengthens their ability to read and write mathematics and
prepares them for the Guided Practice problems by modeling solution
formats.
Guided Practice—The problems in Guided Practice are linked to an
associated worked example or objective from that section.This feature
promotes student success by referring them to the proper examples if
they encounter difﬁculties solving homework problems.
Try It Yourself—To promote problem recognition, the Try It Yourself
problems are thoroughly mixed and are not linked to worked examples,
giving students an opportunity to practice decision-making and strategy
selection as they would when taking a test or quiz.
Applications—The Applications provide students the opportunity to
apply their newly acquired algebraic skills to relevant and interesting
real-life situations.
Writing—The Writing problems help students build mathematical
communication skills.
Review—The Review problems consist of randomly selected problems
from previous chapters.These problems are designed to keep students’
successfully mastered skills up-to-date before they move on to the next
section.
• Detailed Author Notes that guide students along in a step-by-step process
appear in the solutions to every worked example.
• Think It Through features make the connection between mathematics and
student life.These relevant topics often require algebra skills from the
chapter to be applied to a real-life situation.Topics include tuition costs,
student enrollment, job opportunities, credit cards, and many more.
• Chapter Tests, at the end of every chapter, can be used as preparation for the
class exam.
• Cumulative Reviews are available online at www.cengage.com/math/tussy
and keep students’ skills current before moving on to the next chapter. Each
problem is linked to the associated section from which the problem came for
ease of reference.The ﬁnal Cumulative Review is often used by instructors as
a Final Exam Review. Student answers are available in the Answer Section in
the back of the book and instructor answers can be found in the Complete
Solutions Manual.

introduced in Section 9.4 Rate of Change and the Slope of a Line.
• Former Chapter 13 Solving Systems of Equations and Inequalities has been
moved up to Chapter 10, promoting the logical progression from linear equations
and inequalities in two variables in Chapter 9 to systems of equations in two
variables in Chapter 10.The built-in ﬂexibility of the content allows instructors
who prefer to cover this toward the end of the course to continue to do so.
• The Chapter 12 topics have been reorganized:
12.1 The Greatest Common Factor; Factoring by Grouping
12.2 Factoring Trinomials of the Form x2 + bx + c
12.3 Factoring Trinomials of the Form ax2 + bx + c
12.4 Factoring Perfect-Square Trinomials and the Difference of Two Squares
12.5 Factoring the Sum and Difference of Two Cubes
12.6 A Factoring Strategy (Factoring strategy is now covered in its own
section.)

Rena Petrello, Moorpark College
These 10- to 20-minute problem-solving lessons cover nearly every learning
objective from each chapter in the Tussy/Gustafson/Koenig text. Recipient of the
“Mark Dever Award for Excellence in Teaching,” Rena Petrello presents each lesson
using her experience teaching online mathematics courses. It was through this online
teaching experience that Rena discovered the lack of suitable content for online
instructors, which caused her to develop her own video lessons—and ultimately
create this video project. These videos have won four awards: two Telly Awards, one
Communicator Award, and one Aurora Award (an international honor). Students
will love the additional guidance and support when they have missed a class or when
they are preparing for an upcoming quiz or exam.

UCCESS IN YOUR COLLEGE COURSES requires more than just
mastery of the content.The development of strong study skills and
disciplined work habits plays a crucial role as well.Good note-taking,
listening,test-taking,team-building,and time management skills are habits
that can serve you well,not only in this course,but throughout your life and
into your future career.Students often ﬁnd that the approach to learning
that they used for their high school classes no longer works when they
reach college.In this Study Skills Workshop, we will discuss ways of
improving and ﬁne-tuning your study skills,providing you with the best
chance for a successful college experience.

1. List six ways in which you will beneﬁt from passing this course.
2. List six short-term goals that will help you achieve your larger goal of passing this
course. For example, you could set a goal to read through the entire Study Skills
Workshop within the ﬁrst 2 weeks of class or attend class regularly and on time.
(Success Tip: Revisit this action item once you have read through all seven Study Skills
Workshop learning objectives.)
3. List some simple ways you can reward yourself when you complete one of your short-
term class goals.
4. Plan ahead! List ﬁve possible situations that could cause you to be late for class or miss
a class. (Some examples are parking/trafﬁc delays, lack of a babysitter, oversleeping, or
job responsibilities.) What can you do ahead of time so that these situations won’t cause
you to be late or absent?
Starting a new course is exciting, but it also may be a
little frightening. Like any new opportunity, in order to be
successful, it will require a commitment of both time and
resources.You can decrease the anxiety of this commitment
by having a plan to deal with these added responsibilities.
Set Your Goals for the Course.
Explore the reasons why you are taking this
course.What do you hope to gain upon completion? Is this course a prerequisite for further
study in mathematics? Maybe you need to complete this course in order to begin taking
coursework related to your ﬁeld of study. No matter what your reasons, setting goals for
yourself will increase your chances of success. Establish your ultimate goal and then break it
down into a series of smaller goals; it is easier to achieve a series of short-term goals rather
than focusing on one larger goal.
Keep a Positive Attitude.
Since your level of effort is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by your
attitude, strive to maintain a positive mental outlook throughout the class. From time to
time, remind yourself of the ways in which you will beneﬁt from passing the course.
Overcome feelings of stress or math anxiety with extra preparation, campus support
services, and activities you enjoy.When you accomplish short-term goals such as studying
for a speciﬁc period of time, learning a difﬁcult concept, or completing a homework
assignment, reward yourself by spending time with friends, listening to music, reading a
novel, or playing a sport.
Attend Each Class.
Many students don’t realize that missing even one class can
have a great effect on their grade.Arriving late takes its toll as well. If you are just a few
minutes late, or miss an entire class, you risk getting behind. So, keep these tips in mind.
• Arrive on time, or a little early.
• If you must miss a class, get a set of notes, the homework assignments, and any
handouts that the instructor may have provided for the day that you missed.
• Study the material you missed.Take advantage of the help that comes with this
textbook, such as the video examples and problem-speciﬁc tutorials.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Many students believe that
there are two types of people—those who
are good at math and those who are not—
and that this cannot be changed.This is not
true! You can increase your chances for
success in mathematics by taking time to
prepare and taking inventory of your
skills and resources.
Discover Your Learning Style.
Are
you a visual, verbal, or auditory learner? The answer to
this question will help you determine how to study, how to complete your
homework, and even where to sit in class. For example, visual-verbal learners learn best by
reading and writing; a good study strategy for them is to rewrite notes and examples.
However, auditory learners learn best by listening, so listening to the video examples of
important concepts may be their best study strategy.
Get to Know Your Textbook and Its Resources.
You have made a signiﬁcant
investment in your education by purchasing this book and the resources that accompany
it. It has been designed with you in mind. Use as many of the features and resources as
possible in ways that best ﬁt your learning style.
Know What Is Expected.
Your course syllabus maps out your instructor’s
expectations for the course. Read the syllabus completely and make sure you understand
all that is required. If something is not clear, contact your instructor for clariﬁcation.
Organize Your Notebook.
You will deﬁnitely appreciate a well-organized notebook
when it comes time to study for the ﬁnal exam. So let’s start now! Refer to your syllabus
and create a separate section in the notebook for each chapter (or unit of study) that your
class will cover this term. Now, set a standard order within each section. One recommended
order is to begin with your class notes, followed by your completed homework assignments,
then any study sheets or handouts, and, ﬁnally, all graded quizzes and tests.

1. To determine what type of learner you are, take the Learning Style Survey at
http://www.metamath.com/multiple/multiple_choice_questions.html.You may also wish
to take the Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire at http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/
learningstyles/ilsweb.html, which will help you determine your learning type and offer
study suggestions by type. List what you learned from taking these surveys. How will
you use this information to help you succeed in class?
2. Complete the Study Skills Checklists found at the end of sections 1–4 of Chapter 1 in
order to become familiar with the many features that can enhance your learning
experience using this book.
3. Read through the list of Student Resources found in the Preface of this book.Which
ones will you use in this class?
4. Read through your syllabus and write down any questions that you would like to ask
your instructor.
5. Organize your notebook using the guidelines given above. Place your syllabus at the
very front of your notebook so that you can see the dates over which the material will
be covered and for easy reference throughout the course.

1. Keep track of how you spend your time for a week. Rate each activity on a scale from
1 (not important) to 5 (very important).Are there any activities that you need to
reduce or eliminate in order to have enough time to study this term?
2. List three ways that you learn best according to your learning style. How can you use
this information when setting up your study schedule?
3. Download the Weekly Planner Form from www.cengage.com/math/tussy and complete
your schedule. If you prefer, you may set up a schedule in Google Calendar
(calendar.google.com), www.rememberthemilk.com, your cell, or your email system.
Many of these have the ability to set up useful reminders and to-do lists in addition to a
weekly schedule.
4. List three ways in which you are most often distracted.What can you do to avoid these
distractions during your scheduled study times?
Now that you understand the
importance of attending class, how will you
make time to study what you have learned
while attending? Much like learning to play the
piano, math skills are best learned by
practicing a little every day.
Make the Time.
In general, 2 hours of
independent study time is recommended for
every hour in the classroom. If you are in class
3 hours per week, plan on 6 hours per week for reviewing
your notes and completing your homework. It is best to schedule this time over the
length of a week rather than to try to cram everything into one or two marathon study
days.
Prioritize and Make a Calendar.
Because daily practice is so important in learning
math, it is a good idea to set up a calendar that lists all of your time commitments, as well
as the time you will need to set aside for studying and doing your homework. Consider
how you spend your time each week and prioritize your tasks by importance. During the
school term, you may need to reduce or even eliminate certain nonessential tasks in order
to meet your goals for the term.
Maximize Your Study Efforts.
Using the information you learned from determining
your learning style, set up your blocks of study time so that you get the most out of these
sessions. Do you study best in groups or do you need to study alone to get anything done?
Do you learn best when you schedule your study time in 30-minute time blocks or do you
need at least an hour before the information kicks in? Consider your learning style to set
up a schedule that truly suits your needs.
Avoid Distractions.
Between texting and social networking, we have so many
opportunities for distraction and procrastination. On top of these, there are the distractions
of TV, video games, and friends stopping by to hang out. Once you have set your schedule,
honor your study times by turning off any electronic devices and letting your voicemail
take messages for you.After this time, you can reward yourself by returning phone calls
and messages or spending time with friends after the pressure of studying has been lifted.

listening and taking notes. Because your instructor
will be giving explanations and examples that may
not be found in your textbook, as well as other
information about your course (test dates,
homework assignments, and so on), it is important
that you keep a written record of what was said in
class.
Listen Actively.
Listening in class is different
from listening in social situations because it requires that you be
an active listener. Since it is impossible to write down everything that is said in class, you
need to exercise your active listening skills to learn to write down what is important. You
can spot important material by listening for cues from your instructor. For instance, pauses
in lectures or statements from your instructor such as “This is really important” or “This is
a question that shows up frequently on tests” are indications that you should be paying
special attention. Listen with a pencil (or highlighter) in hand, ready to record or highlight
(in your textbook) any examples, deﬁnitions, or concepts that your instructor discusses.
Take Notes You Can Use.
Don’t worry about making your notes really neat.After
class you can rework them into a format that is more useful to you. However, you should
organize your notes as much as possible as you write them. Copy the examples your
instructor uses in class. Circle or star any key concepts or deﬁnitions that your instructor
mentions while explaining the example. Later, your homework problems will look a lot
like the examples given in class, so be sure to copy each of the steps in detail.
Listen with an Open Mind.
Even if there are concepts presented that you feel you
already know, keep tuned in to the presentation of the material and look for a deeper
understanding of the material. If the material being presented is something that has been
difﬁcult for you in the past, listen with an open mind; your new instructor may have a fresh
presentation that works for you.
Avoid Classroom Distractions.
Some of the same things that can distract you from
your study time can distract you, and others, during class. Because of this, be sure to turn
off your cell phone during class. If you take notes on a laptop, log out of your email and
social networking sites during class. In addition to these distractions, avoid getting into
side conversations with other students. Even if you feel you were only distracted for a few
moments, you may have missed important verbal or body language cues about an
upcoming exam or hints that will aid in your understanding of a concept.

1. Refer to your syllabus. Highlight your instructor’s ofﬁce hours and location. Next, pay a
visit to your instructor during ofﬁce hours this week and introduce yourself. (Success
Tip: Program your instructor’s ofﬁce phone number and email address into your cell
phone or email contact list.)
2. Locate your campus tutoring center or math lab.Write down the ofﬁce hours, phone
number, and location on your syllabus. Drop by or give them a call and ﬁnd out how to
go about making an appointment with a tutor.
3. Find two to three classmates who are available to meet at a time that ﬁts your schedule.
Plan to meet 2 days before your next homework assignment is due and follow the
guidelines given above.After your group has met, evaluate how well it worked. Is there
anything that the group can do to make it better next time you meet?
4. Download the Support System Worksheet at www.cengage.com/math/tussy. Complete
the information and keep it at the front of your notebook following your syllabus.
Have you ever had the experience where you
understand everything that your instructor is saying in
class, only to go home and try a homework problem
and be completely stumped? This is a common
complaint among math students.The key to being a
successful math student is to take care of these
problems before you go on to tackle new material.
That is why you should know what resources are
available outside of class.
Make Good Use of Your Instructor’s Ofﬁce Hours.
The
purpose of your instructor’s ofﬁce hours is to be available to help students with questions.
Usually these hours are listed in your syllabus and no appointment is needed.When you
visit your instructor, have a list of questions and try to pinpoint exactly where in the process
you are getting stuck.This will help your instructor answer your questions efﬁciently.
Use Your Campus Tutoring Services.
Many colleges offer tutorial services for free.
Sometimes tutorial assistance is available in a lab setting where you are able to drop in at
your convenience. In some cases, you need to make an appointment to see a tutor in
advance. Make sure to seek help as soon as you recognize the need, and come to see your
tutor with a list of identiﬁed problems.
Form a Study Group.
Study groups are groups of classmates who meet outside of
class to discuss homework problems or study for tests. Get the most out of your study
group by following these guidelines:
• Keep the group small—a maximum of four committed students. Set a regularly
scheduled meeting day, time, and place.
• Find a place to meet where you can talk and spread out your work.
• Members should attempt all homework problems before meeting.
• All members should contribute to the discussion.
• When you meet, practice verbalizing and explaining problems and concepts to
each other.The best way to really learn a topic is by teaching it to someone else.

Attending class and taking notes
are important, but the only way that you
are really going to learn mathematics is by
completing your homework. Sitting in class
and listening to lectures will help you to
place concepts in short-term memory, but
in order to do well on tests and in future
math classes, you want to put these
concepts in long-term memory.When
completed regularly, homework assignments will help
with this.
Give Yourself Enough Time.
In Objective 3, you made a study schedule, setting
aside 2 hours for study and homework for every hour that you spend in class. If you are
not keeping this schedule, make changes to ensure that you can spend enough time
outside of class to learn new material.
Review Your Notes and the Worked Examples from Your Text.
In Objective 4, you
learned how to take useful notes. Before you begin your homework, review or rework your
notes.Then, read the sections in your textbook that relate to your homework problems,
paying special attention to the worked examples.With a pencil in hand, work the Self Check
and Now Try problems that are listed next to the examples in your text. Using the worked
example as a guide, solve these problems and try to understand each step.As you read
through your notes and your text, keep a list of anything that you don’t understand.
Now Try Your Homework Problems.
Once you have reviewed your notes and the
textbook worked examples, you should be able to successfully manage the bulk of your
homework assignment easily.When working on your homework, keep your textbook and
notes close by for reference. If you have trouble with a homework question, look through
your textbook and notes to see if you can identify an example that is similar to the
homework question. See if you can apply the same steps to your homework problem. If
there are places where you get stuck, add these to your list of questions.
Get Answers to Your Questions.
At least one day before your assignment is due,
seek help with the questions you have been listing.You can contact a classmate for
assistance, make an appointment with a tutor, or visit your instructor during ofﬁce hours.

that sheet? Include all the key deﬁnitions, rules, steps, and formulas that were discussed in
class or covered in your reading.Whenever you have the opportunity, pull out your study
sheet and review your test material.
Three days before the test: Create a sample test using the in-class examples from your
notes and reading material.As you review and work these examples, make sure you
understand how each example relates to the rules or deﬁnitions on your study sheet.While
working through these examples, you may ﬁnd that you forgot a concept that should be on
your study sheet. Update your study sheet and continue to review it.
Two days before the test: Use the Chapter Test from your textbook or create one by
matching problems from your text to the example types from your sample test. Now, with
your book closed, take a timed trial test.When you are done, check your answers. Make a
list of the topics that were difﬁcult for you and review or add these to your study sheet.
One day before the test: Review your study sheet once more, paying special attention
to the material that was difﬁcult for you when you took your practice test the day before.
Be sure you have all the materials that you will need for your test laid out ahead of time
(two sharpened pencils, a good eraser, possibly a calculator or protractor, and so on).The
most important thing you can do today is get a good night’s rest.
Test day: Review your study sheet, if you have time. Focus on how well you have
prepared and take a moment to relax.When taking your test, complete the problems that
you are sure of ﬁrst. Skip the problems that you don’t understand right away, and return to
them later. Bring a watch or make sure there will be some kind of time-keeping device in
your test room so that you can keep track of your time.Try not to spend too much time on
any one problem.

Landscape designers make outdoor places more beautiful and useful.They work
on all types of projects.Some focus on yards and parks,others on
land around buildings and highways.The training of a
landscape designer should include botany classes to
learn about plants; art classes to learn about color,line,
and form; and mathematics classes to learn how to take
measurements and keep business records.
In Problem 57 of Study Set 1.6,you will see how a
landscape designer uses addition and multiplication of
whole numbers to calculate the cost of landscaping a yard.

The whole numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and so on. They are used to
answer questions such as How many?, How fast?, and How far?
• The movie Titanic won 11 Academy Awards.
• The average American adult reads at a rate of 250 to 300 words per minute.
• The driving distance from New York City to Los Angeles is 2,786 miles.
The set of whole numbers is written using braces { } , as shown below. The three
dots indicate that the list continues forever—there is no largest whole number. The
smallest whole number is 0.

Identify the place value of a digit in a whole number.
When a whole number is written using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, it is said to be
in standard form (also called standard notation). The position of a digit in a whole
number determines its place value. In the number 325, the 5 is in the ones column, the
2 is in the tens column, and the 3 is in the hundreds column.
Tens column
Hundreds column 
Ones column
To make large whole numbers easier to read, we use commas to separate their
digits into groups of three, called periods. Each period has a name, such as ones,
thousands, millions, billions, and trillions. The following place-value chart shows the
place value of each digit in the number 2,691,537,557,000, which is read as:

As we move to the left in the chart, the place
value of each column is 10 times greater than the column directly to its right.
This is why we call our number system the base-10 number system.

(Source:Airports Council International–North America)
a. What is the place value of the digit 3?
b. Which digit tells the number of millions?
Strategy We will begin in the ones column of 89,379,287.Then, moving to the left,
we will name each column (ones,tens,hundreds,and so on) until we reach the digit 3.
WHY It’s easier to remember the names of the columns if you begin with the
smallest place value and move to the columns that have larger place values.
Solution 
a. 89,379,287
Say, “Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred
thousands” as you move from column to column. 
3 hundred thousands is the place value of the digit 3.
b. 89,379,287
The digit 9 is in the millions column.

Write whole numbers in words and in standard form.
Since we use whole numbers so often in our daily lives, it is important to be able to
read and write them.
Reading and Writing Whole Numbers 
To write a whole number in words, start from the left.Write the number in
each period followed by the name of the period (except for the ones period,
which is not used). Use commas to separate the periods.
To read a whole number out loud, follow the same procedure.The commas
are read as slight pauses.
The Language of Mathematics
The word and should not be said when
reading a whole number. It should only be used when reading a mixed number 
such as 
(ﬁve and one-half) or a decimal such as 3.9 (three and nine-tenths).

WHY To write a whole number in words, we must give the name of each period
(except for the ones period). Finding the largest period helps to start the process.
Solution 
a. 63 is written: sixty-three.
Use a hyphen to write whole numbers from 21 to 99 in

Using a process known as graphing, we can represent a single number or a set of
numbers on a number line. The graph of a number is the point on the number line that
corresponds to that number. To graph a number means to locate its position on the
number line and highlight it with a heavy dot.The graphs of 5 and 8 are shown on the
number line below.

Compare whole numbers using inequality symbols.
Whole numbers can be shown by drawing points on a number line. Like a ruler, a
number line is straight and has uniform markings.To construct a number line,we begin
on the left with a point on the line representing the number 0.This point is called the 
origin. We then move to the right, drawing equally spaced marks and labeling them
with whole numbers that increase in value. The arrowhead at the right indicates that
the number line continues forever.

Read as “8 is greater than 5.”
Since 8

Round whole numbers.
When we don’t need exact results, we often round numbers. For example, when a
teacher with 36 students orders 40 textbooks, he has rounded the actual number to the
nearest ten, because 36 is closer to 40 than it is to 30.We say 36, rounded to the nearest
10, is 40.This process is called rounding up.
Round up
36 is closer to
40 than to 30.

When a geologist says that the height of Alaska’s Mount McKinley is “about
20,300 feet,” she has rounded to the nearest hundred, because its actual height of
20,320 feet is closer to 20,300 than it is to 20,400. We say that 20,320, rounded to the
nearest hundred, is 20,300.This process is called rounding down.
Round down
20,320 is closer to
20,300 than 20,400.

To round a whole number, we follow an established set of rules. To round a
number to the nearest ten, for example, we locate the rounding digit in the tens
column. If the test digit to the right of that column (the digit in the ones column) is 
5 or greater, we round up by increasing the tens digit by 1 and replacing the test digit
with 0. If the test digit is less than 5, we round down by leaving the tens digit
unchanged and replacing the test digit with 0.

When we round a whole number, we are
ﬁnding an approximation of the number. An approximation is close to, but not
the same as, the exact value.

EXAMPLE 6
Round each number to the nearest ten: a. 3,761
b. 12,087
Strategy We will ﬁnd the digit in the tens column and the digit in the ones 
column.
WHY To round to the nearest ten,the digit in the tens column is the rounding digit
and the digit in the ones column is the test digit.
Solution
a. We ﬁnd the rounding digit in the tens column, which is 6. Then we look at the
test digit to the right of 6, which is the 1 in the ones column. Since 1
5, we
round down by leaving the 6 unchanged and replacing the test digit with 0.
Rounding digit: tens column
Keep the rounding digit: Do not add 1.
3,761 
3,761
Test digit: 1 is less than 5.
Replace with 0.
Thus, 3,761 rounded to the nearest ten is 3,760.
b. We ﬁnd the rounding digit in the tens column, which is 8. Then we look at the
test digit to the right of 8, which is the 7 in the ones column. Because 7 is 5 or
greater, we round up by adding 1 to 8 and replacing the test digit with 0.
Rounding digit: tens column

1.
To round a number to a certain place value, locate the rounding digit in that
place.
2.
Look at the test digit, which is directly to the right of the rounding digit.
3.
If the test digit is 5 or greater, round up by adding 1 to the rounding digit
and replacing all of the digits to its right with 0.
If the test digit is less than 5, replace it and all of the digits to its right with 0.

WHY To round to the nearest hundred, the digit in the hundreds column is the
rounding digit and the digit in the tens column is the test digit.
Solution 
a. First, we ﬁnd the rounding digit in the hundreds column, which is 3. Then we 
look at the test digit 4 to the right of 3 in the tens column. Because 4
5, we
round down and leave the 3 in the hundreds column. We then replace the two
rightmost digits with 0’s.
Rounding digit: hundreds column 
Keep the rounding digit: Do not add 1.
18,349
18,349
Test digit: 4 is less than 5.
Replace with 0’s.
Thus, 18,349 rounded to the nearest hundred is 18,300.
b. First,we ﬁnd the rounding digit in the hundreds column,which is 9.Then we look
at the test digit 6 to the right of 9. Because 6 is 5 or greater, we round up and
increase 9 in the hundreds column by 1. Since the 9 in the hundreds column
represents 900, increasing 9 by 1 represents increasing 900 to 1,000. Thus, we
replace the 9 with a 0 and add 1 to the 7 in the thousands column. Finally, we
replace the two rightmost digits with 0’s.
Add 1. Since 9 + 1 = 10, write 0 in this
Rounding digit: hundreds column 
column and carry 1 to the next column.
7,960
Test digit: 6 is 5 or greater.

Horizontal is a form of the word horizon.
Think of the sun setting over the horizon. Vertical means in an upright
position. Pro basketball player LeBron James’ vertical leap measures more
than 49 inches.
Another way to present the information in the table is with a line graph. Instead
of using a bar to represent the number of women members, we use a dot drawn at the
correct height.After drawing data points for 1997,1999,2001,2003,2005,and 2007,the
points are connected to create the line graph in ﬁgure (b).

Addition of whole numbers is used by everyone. For example, to prepare an annual
budget, an accountant adds separate line item costs. To determine the number of
yearbooks to order, a principal adds the number of students in each grade level. A
ﬂight attendant adds the number of people in the ﬁrst-class and economy sections to
ﬁnd the total number of passengers on an airplane.

We can write this addition problem in horizontal or vertical form using an
addition symbol 
, which is read as “plus.” The numbers that are being added are
called addends and the answer is called the sum or total.
Horizontal form
Vertical form
To add whole numbers that are less than 10,we rely on our understanding of basic
addition facts. For example,
2 + 3 = 5,
6 + 4 = 10,
and
9 + 7 = 16 
If you need to review the basic addition facts, they can be found in Appendix 1, at
the back of the book.
To add whole numbers that are greater than 10, we can use vertical form by
stacking them with their corresponding place values lined up.Then we simply add the
digits in each corresponding column.

EXAMPLE 1
Add:
Strategy We will write the addition in vertical form with the ones digits in a
column, the tens digits in a column, and the hundreds digits in a column. Then we
will add the digits, column by column, working from right to left.
WHY Like money,where pennies are only added to pennies,dimes are only added
to dimes,and dollars are only added to dollars,we can only add digits with the same
place value: ones to ones, tens to tens, hundreds to hundreds.
Solution
We start at the right and add the ones digits, then the tens digits, and ﬁnally the
hundreds digits and write each sum below the horizontal bar.
Hundreds column
Tens column
Ones column
Vertical form
The answer (sum)
Sum of the ones digits: Think: 1  3  5  9. 
Sum of the tens digits: Think: 2  2  4  8.

Whole Numbers

To ﬁnd the sum of three whole numbers, we add two of them and then add the
sum to the third number.In the following examples,we add 
in two ways.We
will use the grouping symbols ( ), called parentheses, to show this. It is standard
practice to perform the operations within the parentheses ﬁrst. The steps of the
solutions are written in horizontal form.
3  4  7
The Language of Mathematics
In the following example, read (3  4)  7
as “The quantity of 3 plus 4,” pause slightly, and then say “plus 7.” Read 3 
(4  7) as,“3 plus the quantity of 4 plus 7.”The word quantity alerts the reader
to the parentheses that are used as grouping symbols.
Method 1: Group 3 and 4 
  14
(3  4)  7  7  7 
Because of the
parentheses,
add 3 and 4
ﬁrst to get 7.
Then add 7 and
7 to get 14.
Method 2: Group 4 and 7
  14
3  (4  7)  3  11 
Because of the
parentheses, 
add 4 and 7
ﬁrst to get 11. 
Then add 3 and
11 to get 14.


Either way, the answer is 14.This example illustrates that changing the grouping when
adding numbers doesn’t affect the result. This property is called the associative
property of addition.
Success Tip
In Example 3, the digits in each place value column were added
from top to bottom.To check the answer, we can instead add from bottom to top.
Adding down or adding up should give the same result. If it does not, an error
has been made and you should re-add.You will learn why the two results should
be the same in Objective 2, which follows.
To check,
add
bottom
to top
1 7 , 8 0 2
9 , 8 3 5
6 9 2
  7 , 2 7 5
1 7 , 8 0 2
First add

2
Use properties of addition to add whole numbers.
Have you ever noticed that two whole numbers can be added in either order because
the result is the same? For example,
2  8  10
and
8  2  10
This example illustrates the commutative property of addition.
Commutative Property of Addition
The order in which whole numbers are added does not change their sum.
For example,
6  5  5  6
The Language of Mathematics
Commutative is a form of the word commute,
meaning to go back and forth. Commuter trains take people to and from work.
Same result

Associative Property of Addition
The way in which whole numbers are grouped does not change their sum.
For example,
(2  5)  4  2  (5  4)
The Language of Mathematics
Associative is a form of the word associate,
meaning to join a group.The WNBA (Women’s National Basketball
Association) is a group of 14 professional basketball teams.
EXAMPLE 4
Find the sum:
98  (2  17)
Strategy We will use the associative property to group 2 with 98.
WHY It is helpful to regroup because 98 and 2 are a pair of numbers that are easily
added.
Solution 
We will write the steps of the solution in horizontal form.
Use the associative property of addition to
regroup the addends.
Do the addition within the parentheses ﬁrst.
  117
  100  17
98  (2  17)  (98  2)  17 
Sometimes, an application of the associative property can simplify a calculation.
Whenever we add 0 to a whole number, the number is unchanged. This property
is called the addition property of 0.

We can often use the commutative and associative properties to make addition of
several whole numbers easier.
Addition Property of 0
The sum of any whole number and 0 is that whole number. For example,
,
,

20 or 30, and so on.
WHY This method is easier than adding unrelated numbers, and it reduces the
chances of a mistake.
Solution 
Together, the commutative and associative properties of addition enable us to use
any order or grouping to add whole numbers.
a. We will write the steps of the solution in horizontal form.
3 + 5 + 17 + 2 + 3  20 + 10

EXAMPLE 6
Use front-end rounding to estimate the sum:
3,714  2,489  781  5,500  303
Strategy We will use front-end rounding to approximate each addend. Then we
will ﬁnd the sum of the approximations.
WHY Front-end rounding produces addends containing many 0’s. Such numbers
are easier to add.
Solution  
Each of the addends is rounded to its largest place value so that all but its ﬁrst digit
is zero. Then we add the approximations using vertical form.
The estimate is 13,100.
If we calculate 3,714  2,489  781  5,500  303, the sum is exactly 12,787.
Note that the estimate is close: It’s just 313 more than 12,787. This illustrates the
tradeoff when using estimation: The calculations are easier to perform and they
take less time, but the answers are not exact.

Estimate sums of whole numbers.
Estimation is used to ﬁnd an approximate answer to a problem. Estimates are helpful
in two ways. First, they serve as an accuracy check that can ﬁnd errors. If an answer
does not seem reasonable when compared to the estimate, the original problem
should be reworked. Second, some situations call for only an approximate answer
rather than the exact answer.
There are several ways to estimate, but the objective is the same: Simplify the
numbers in the problem so that the calculations can be made easily and quickly. One
popular method of estimation is called front-end rounding.
b. Each step of the addition is explained separately.Your solution should look

EXAMPLE 7
Sharks
The graph on

of shark attacks worldwide
for the years 2000 through
2007. Find the total number
of shark attacks for those
years.

WHY Key 
words 
and
phrases 
indicate 
which
arithmetic 
operation(s)
should be used to solve the

Solution 
In the second sentence of the problem, the key word total indicates that we should

Strategy We will carefully read the problem looking for key words or phrases.
WHY Key words and phrases indicate which arithmetic operations should be used
to solve the problem.
Solution 
The phrase increased by indicates addition. With that in mind, we translate the
words of the problem to numbers and symbols.

Find the perimeter of a rectangle and a square.
Figure (a) below is an example of a four-sided ﬁgure called a rectangle. Either of the
longer sides of a rectangle is called its length and either of the shorter sides is called
its width. Together, the length and width are called the dimensions of the rectangle.
For any rectangle, opposite sides have the same measure.
When all four of the sides of a rectangle are the same length, we call the rectangle
a square. An example of a square is shown in ﬁgure (b).
The distance around a rectangle or a square is called its perimeter. To ﬁnd the
perimeter of a rectangle, we add the lengths of its four sides.
To ﬁnd the perimeter of a square, we add the lengths of its four sides.

Subtracting Whole Numbers
29
Subtraction of whole numbers is used by everyone. For example, to ﬁnd the sale price
of an item, a store clerk subtracts the discount from the regular price. To measure
climate change, a scientist subtracts the high and low temperatures. A trucker
subtracts odometer readings to calculate the number of miles driven on a trip.

Subtract whole numbers.
To subtract two whole numbers, think of taking away objects from a set. For example,
if we start with a set of 9 stars and take away a set of 4 stars, a set of 5 stars is left.
We can write this subtraction problem in horizontal or vertical form using a
subtraction symbol , which is read as “minus.” We call the number from which
another number is subtracted the minuend. The number being subtracted is called the
subtrahend, and the answer is called the difference.

The Language of Mathematics
The preﬁx sub means below, as in submarine
or subway. Notice that in vertical form, the subtrahend is written below the
minuend.
To subtract two whole numbers that are less than 10,we rely on our understanding
of basic subtraction facts. For example,
and
To subtract two whole numbers that are greater than 10, we can use vertical form
by stacking them with their corresponding place values lined up. Then we simply
subtract the digits in each corresponding column.

59  27 
Strategy We will write the subtraction in vertical form with the ones digits in a
column and the tens digits in a column. Then we will subtract the digits in each
column, working from right to left.
WHY Like money, where pennies are only subtracted from pennies and dimes are
only subtracted from dimes, we can only subtract digits with the same place
value–ones from ones and tens from tens.

Subtract 235 from 6,496.
Strategy We will translate the sentence to mathematical symbols and then
perform the subtraction. We must be careful when translating the instruction to
subtract one number from another number.
WHY The order of the numbers in the sentence must be reversed when we
translate to symbols.
Solution 
Since 235 is the number to be subtracted, it is the subtrahend.
6,496     235 
To ﬁnd the difference, we write the subtraction in vertical form and subtract the
digits in each column, working from right to left.
Bring down the 6 in the thousands column.

Caution!
When subtracting two numbers, it is important that we write them
in the correct order, because subtraction is not commutative. For instance, in
Example 2, if we had incorrectly translated “Subtract 235 from 6,496” as 
235  6,496, we see that the difference is not 6,261. In fact, the difference is not
even a whole number.

Subtracting Whole Numbers

Some subtractions require borrowing from two (or more) place value columns.
EXAMPLE 4
Subtract:
9,927  568
Strategy We will write the subtraction in vertical form and subtract as usual. In
each column, we must watch for a digit in the subtrahend that is greater than the
digit directly above it in the minuend.
WHY If a digit in the subtrahend is greater than the digit above it in the minuend,
we need to borrow (regroup) to subtract in that column.
Solution
We write the subtraction in vertical form, so that the corresponding digits are lined
up. Each step of this subtraction is explained separately.Your solution should look
like the last step.
Since 8 in the ones column of 568 is greater than 7 in the ones column of 9,927, we
cannot immediately subtract. To subtract in that column, we must regroup by
borrowing 1 ten from 2 in the tens column. In this process, we use the fact that 1 ten
 10 ones.
Since 6 in the tens column of 568 is greater than 1 in the tens column directly above
it, we cannot immediately subtract.To subtract in that column, we must regroup by
borrowing 1 hundred from 9 in the hundreds column.In this process,we use the fact
that 1 hundred  10 tens.
Borrow 1 ten from 2 in the tens column and change the 2 to 1. Add the
borrowed 10 to the digit 7 in the ones column of the minuend to get 17. 
Then subtract in the ones column: 17  8  9.

WHY If a digit in the subtrahend is greater than the digit directly above it in the
minuend, we must borrow (regroup) to subtract in that column.
Solution
To help you understand the process, each step of this subtraction is explained
separately.Your solution need only look like the last step.
We write the subtraction in vertical form to line up the tens digits and line up
the ones digits.
Since 5 in the ones column of 15 is greater than 2 in the ones column of 32, we
cannot immediately subtract in that column because 2  5 is not a whole number.
To subtract in the ones column, we must regroup by borrowing 1 ten from 3 in the
tens column. In this regrouping process, we use the fact that 1 ten  10 ones.
Subtract in the tens column: 2  1  1.

Subtract:
42,403  1,675
Strategy We will write the subtraction in vertical form. To subtract in the ones
column, we will borrow from the hundreds column of the minuend 42,403.
WHY Since the digit in the tens column of 42,403 is 0, it is not possible to borrow
from that column.
Solution
We write the subtraction in vertical form so that the corresponding digits are lined
up. Each step of this subtraction is explained separately.Your solution should look
like the last step.
Since 5 in the ones column of 1,675 is greater than 3 in the ones column of 42,403,
we cannot immediately subtract. It is not possible to borrow from the digit 0 in the
tens column of 42,403. We can, however, borrow from the hundreds column to
regroup in the tens column, as shown below. In this process, we use the fact that 1
hundred  10 tens.
Now we can borrow from the 10 in the tens column to subtract in the ones column.

Next, we perform the subtraction in the tens column: 9  7  2.

To subtract in the hundreds column, we borrow from the 2 in the thousands

WHY Front-end rounding produces whole numbers containing many 0’s. Such
numbers are easier to subtract.
Solution  
Both the minuend and the subtrahend are rounded to their largest place value so
that all but their ﬁrst digit is zero. Then we subtract the approximations using
vertical form.

Multiplication of whole numbers is used by everyone. For example, to double a recipe,
a cook multiplies the amount of each ingredient by two.To determine the ﬂoor space
of a dining room, a carpeting salesperson multiplies its length by its width. An
accountant multiplies the number of hours worked by the hourly pay rate to calculate
the weekly earnings of employees.

Multiply whole numbers by one-digit numbers.
In the following display, there are 4 rows, and each of the rows has 5 stars.
We can ﬁnd the total number of stars in the display by adding: 5  5  5  5  20.
This problem can also be solved using a simpler process called multiplication.
Multiplication is repeated addition, and it is written using a multiplication symbol 
,
which is read as “times.” Instead of adding four 5’s to get 20, we can multiply 4 and 5
to get 20.

Multiply whole numbers that end with zeros.
An interesting pattern develops when a whole number is multiplied by 10, 100, 1,000
and so on. Consider the following multiplications involving 8:
There is one zero in 10. The product is 8 with 
one 0 attached. 
There are two zeros in 100. The product is 8 with 
two 0’s attached. 
There are three zeros in 1,000. The product is 8 with 
three 0’s attached. 
There are four zeros in 10,000. The product is 8 with 
four 0’s attached. 
These examples illustrate the following rule.
8  1 0 , 0 0 0  8 0 , 0 0 0
 8  1 , 0 0 0  8 , 0 0 0

any whole numbers that end in zeros. For example, to ﬁnd 
, we have 
Write 2,000 as 2  1,000.
Working left to right, multiply 67 and 2 to get 134. 
Since 1,000 has three zeros, attach three 0’s 
after 134.
This example suggests that to ﬁnd 
we simply multiply 67 and 2 and
attach three zeros to that product. This method can be extended to ﬁnd products of
two factors that both end in zeros.

When a factor in a multiplication contains one or more zeros, we must be careful
to enter the correct number of zeros when writing the partial products.
EXAMPLE 5
Multiply:
a.
b.
Strategy We will think of 406 as 6  400 and 3,009 as 9  3,000.
WHY Thinking of the multipliers (406 and 3,009) in this way is helpful when
determining the correct number of zeros to enter in the partial products.
Solution 
We will use vertical form to perform each multiplication.
a. Since 
, we will multiply 253 by 6 and by 400, and add those
partial products.
The product is 102,718.
b. Since 
, we will multiply 2,007 by 9 and by 3,000, and add
those partial products.
The product is 6,039,063.
d 9  2,007
d 3,000  2,007. Think of 3,000 as 3  1,000 and simply multiply
2,007 by 3 and attach three zeros (shown in blue) to the result.

To multiply three numbers, we ﬁrst multiply two of them and then multiply that
result by the third number.In the following examples,we multiply 
in two ways.
The parentheses show us which multiplication to perform ﬁrst. The steps of the
solutions are written in horizontal form.
3  2  4
The Language of Mathematics
In the following example, read (3  2)  4 as
“The quantity of 3 times 2,” pause slightly, and then say “times 4.”We read 
3  (2  4) as “3 times the quantity of 2 times 4.”The word quantity alerts the
reader to the parentheses that are used as grouping symbols.
Method 1: Group 3  2
Multiply 3 and 2 to
get 6. 
Multiply 6 and 4 to
get 24.
  24
(3  2)  4  6  4
Method 2: Group 2  4
Then multiply 2 and 4

Then multiply 3 and 8
to get 24.
  24

Same result
Either way, the answer is 24.This example illustrates that changing the grouping when
multiplying numbers doesn’t affect the result. This property is called the associative
property of multiplication.
Associative Property of Multiplication
The way in which whole numbers are grouped does not change their product.
For example,
(2  3)  5  2  (3  5)
Sometimes, an application of the associative property can simplify a calculation.

Estimation is used to ﬁnd an approximate answer to a problem.
EXAMPLE 7
Estimate the product:
Strategy We will use front-end rounding to approximate the factors 59 and 334.
Then we will ﬁnd the product of the approximations.
WHY Front-end rounding produces whole numbers containing many 0’s. Such
numbers are easier to multiply.
Solution
Both of the factors are rounded to their largest place value so that all but their ﬁrst
digit is zero.
Round to the nearest ten.
Round to the nearest hundred.
To ﬁnd the product of the approximations,60  300,we simply multiply 6 by 3,to get
18, and attach 3 zeros.Thus, the estimate is 18,000.
If we calculate

Strategy To ﬁnd the amount earned in an 8-hour workday, we will multiply the
hourly rate of $18 by 8.
WHY For each of the 8 hours, the average manufacturing worker earned $18.The
amount earned for the day is the sum of eight 18’s: 18  18  18  18  18  18 

The rectangle in the ﬁgure below has a length of 5 centimeters and a width of 
3 centimeters.Since each small square region covers an area of one square centimeter,
each small square region measures 1 cm2.The small square regions form a rectangular
pattern, with 3 rows of 5 squares.
Because there are 
, or 15, small square regions, the area of the rectangle is 
15 cm2.This suggests that the area of any rectangle is the product of its length and its width.

By using the letter A to represent the area of the rectangle,the letter l to represent

Dividing Whole Numbers
Division of whole numbers is used by everyone. For example, to ﬁnd how many 
6-ounce servings a chef can get from a 48-ounce roast, he divides 48 by 6. To split a
$36,000 inheritance equally, a brother and sister divide the amount by 2. A professor
divides the 35 students in her class into groups of 5 for discussion.

Write the related multiplication statement for a division.
To divide whole numbers, think of separating a quantity into equal-sized groups. For
example, if we start with a set of 12 stars and divide them into groups of 4 stars, we will
obtain 3 groups.
We can write this division problem using a division symbol
,a long division symbol
, or a fraction bar
. We call the number being divided the dividend and the
number that we are dividing by is called the divisor. The answer is called the quotient.

There are 3 groups of 4 stars.
A set of 12 stars.
Recall from Section 1.4 that multiplication is repeated addition. Likewise,
division is repeated subtraction. To divide 12 by 4, we ask, “How many 4’s can be
subtracted from 12?”
Since exactly three 4’s can be subtracted from 12 to get 0, we know that
.
Another way to answer a division problem is to think in terms of multiplication.
For example, the division 
asks the question,“What must I multiply 4 by to get
12?” Since the answer is 3, we know that 
because
We call 
the related multiplication statement for the division 
In general, to write the related multiplication statement for a division, we use:
Quotient  divisor  dividend

Use properties of division to divide whole numbers.

number. We can use that fact to establish two important properties of division.
Consider the following examples where a whole number is divided by 1:

process: estimate, multiply, subtract, and bring down.

To help you understand the process, each step of this division is explained
separately.Your solution need only look like the last step.
We write the problem in the form

long division symbol. Since 6 will not divide 2,

In Example 2, the long division process ended
with a 0. In such cases, we say that the divisor divides the dividend exactly.
We can see how the long division process works if we write the names of the place-
value columns above the quotient.The solution for Example 2 is shown in more detail
on the next page.

Perform long division (with a remainder).
Sometimes, it is not possible to separate a group of objects into a whole number of
equal-sized groups. For example, if we start with a set of 14 stars and divide them
into groups of 4 stars, we will have 3 groups of 4 stars and 2 stars left over. We call
the left over part the remainder.
There are 3 groups of 4 stars.

Use tests for divisibility.
We have seen that some divisions end with a 0 remainder and others do not. The
word divisible is used to describe such situations.
Divisibility
One number is divisible by another if, when dividing them, we get a remainder
of 0.
Since 
with a 0 remainder, we say that 27 is divisible by 3. Since
R 2, we say that 27 is not divisible by 5.
There are tests to help us decide whether one number is divisible by another.

Tests for Divisibility
A number is divisible by
• 2 if its last digit is divisible by 2.
• 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
• 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.
• 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
• 6 if it is divisible by 2 and 3.
• 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
• 10 if its last digit is 0.
There are tests for divisibility by a number other than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 10, but they
are more complicated. See problems 109 and 110 of Study Set 1.5 for some examples.

Divide whole numbers that end with zeros.
There is a shortcut for dividing a dividend by a divisor when both end with zeros.We
simply remove the ending zeros in the divisor and remove the same number of ending
zeros in the dividend.

Estimate quotients of whole numbers.
To estimate quotients, we use a method that approximates both the dividend and the
divisor so that they divide easily. There is one rule of thumb for this method: If
possible, round both numbers up or both numbers down.

1
Apply the steps of a problem-
solving strategy.
2
Solve problems requiring more
than one operation.
3
Recognize unimportant
information in application
problems.
The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are powerful
tools that can be used to solve a wide variety of real-world problems.
Apply the steps of a problem-solving strategy.
To become a good problem solver, you need a plan to follow, such as the following
ﬁve-step strategy.

Strategy for Problem Solving
1.
Analyze the problem by reading it carefully.What information is given?
What are you asked to ﬁnd? What vocabulary is given? Often, a diagram
or table will help you visualize the facts of the problem.
2.
Form a plan by translating the words of the problem to numbers and
symbols.
3.
Solve the problem by performing the calculations.
4.
State the conclusion clearly. Be sure to include the units (such as feet,
seconds, or pounds) in your answer.
5.
Check the result. An estimate is often helpful to see whether an answer is
reasonable.

Solve Use vertical form to perform the multiplication:
State It will cost $10,810 to purchase 115 place settings.
Check We can estimate to check the result. If we use $100 to approximate the cost
of one place setting, then the cost of 115 place settings is about 
or
$11,500. Since the estimate, $11,500, and the result, $10,810, are close, the result
seems reasonable.

Bottled Water
How many 6-ounce servings are there in
a 5-gallon bottle of water? (Hint: There are 128 ﬂuid ounces in 1 gallon.)
Analyze The diagram on the next page is helpful in understanding the problem.
• Since each of the 5 gallons of water is 128 ounces, the total number of
ounces is the sum of ﬁve 128’s.This repeated addition can be calculated
using multiplication.
• Since equal-sized servings of water come from the bottle, this suggests
division.

1
Factor whole numbers.
The statement 
has two parts: the numbers that are being multiplied and the
answer. The numbers that are being multiplied are called factors, and the answer is
the product. We say that 3 and 2 are factors of 6.

Success Tip
In Example 1, once we determine the pair 1 and 12 are factors of
12, any remaining factors must be between 1 and 12. Once we determine that
the pair 2 and 6 are factors of 12, any remaining factors must be between 2 and
6. Once we determine that the pair 3 and 4 are factors of 12, any remaining
factors of 12 must be between 3 and 4. Since there are no whole numbers
between 3 and 4, we know that all the possible factors of 12 have been 
found.
In Example 1, we found that 
and 
are the factors of 12. Notice that
each of the factors divides 12 exactly, leaving a remainder of 0.
In general, if a whole number is a factor of a given number, it also divides the given
number exactly.
When we say that 3 is a factor of 6, we are using the word factor as a noun. The
word factor is also used as a verb.

Even and Odd Whole Numbers
If a whole number is divisible by 2, it is called an even number.
If a whole number is not divisible by 2, it is called an odd number.
The even whole numbers are the numbers
The odd whole numbers are the numbers
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, p

The three dots at the end of each list shown above indicate that there are inﬁnitely
many even and inﬁnitely many odd whole numbers.
The Language of Mathematics
The word inﬁnitely is a form of the word
inﬁnite, meaning unlimited.
In Example 3, we saw that the only factors of 17 are 1 and 17. Numbers that
have only two factors, 1 and the number itself, are called prime numbers.

Prime Numbers
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only 1 and itself as
factors.
The prime numbers are the numbers:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101,
There are inﬁnitely many prime numbers.
p
Note that the only even prime number is 2. Any other even whole number is
divisible by 2, and thus has 2 as a factor, in addition to 1 and itself.Also note that not
all odd whole numbers are prime numbers. For example, since 15 has factors of 1, 3,
5, and 15, it is not a prime number.
The set of whole numbers contains many prime numbers. It also contains many
numbers that are not prime.
Composite Numbers
The composite numbers are whole numbers greater than 1 that are not prime.
The composite numbers are the numbers
There are inﬁnitely many composite numbers.
4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, p
Caution!
The numbers 0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite, because
neither is a whole number greater than 1.
EXAMPLE 4
a.
Is 37 a prime number?
b. Is 45 a prime number?
Strategy We will determine whether the given number has only 1 and itself as
factors.
WHY If that is the case, it is a prime number.
Solution
a. Since 37 is a whole number greater than 1 and its only factors are 1 and 37, it is
prime. Since 37 is not divisible by 2, we say it is an odd prime number.
b. The factors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. Since it has factors other than 1 and
45, 45 is not prime. It is an odd composite number.

Every composite number can be formed by multiplying a speciﬁc combination of
prime numbers. The process of ﬁnding that combination is called prime
factorization.

Find prime factorizations using a division ladder.
We can also ﬁnd the prime factorization of a whole number using an inverted
division process called a division ladder. It is called that because of the vertical
“steps” that it produces.
Success Tip
The divisibility rules found in Section 1.5 are helpful when using
the division ladder method.You may want to review them at this time.
EXAMPLE 6
Use a division ladder to ﬁnd the prime factorization of 280.
Strategy We will perform repeated divisions by prime numbers until the ﬁnal
quotient is itself a prime number.
WHY If a prime number is a factor of 280, it will divide 280 exactly.
Solution
It is helpful to begin with the smallest prime, 2, as the ﬁrst trial divisor. Then, if
necessary, try the primes 
in that order.
Step 1 The prime number 2 divides 280 exactly.
The result is 140, which is not prime. Continue the division 
process.
Step 2 Since 140 is even, divide by 2 again.
The result is 70, which is not prime. Continue the division 
process.
Step 3 Since 70 is even, divide by 2 a third time.The result 
is 35, which is not prime.
Continue the division process.
Step 4 Since neither the prime number 2 nor the next greatest 
Prime
prime number 3 divide 35 exactly, we try 5.The result is 7, which 
is prime.We are done.
The prime factorization of 280 appears in the left column of the
division ladder:

An exponent is used to indicate repeated multiplication. It tells how many
times the base is used as a factor.
The exponent is 3.
Read 
as “2 to the third power” or “2 cubed.”
Repeated factors
The base is 2.
The prime factorization of 280 can be written using exponents:
In the exponential expression
the number 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent.

The Least Common Multiple and the Greatest Common Factor
91
The Least Common Multiple (LCM)
The least common multiple (LCM) of two whole numbers is the smallest
whole number that is divisible by both of those numbers.
When ﬁnding the LCM of two numbers, writing both lists of multiples can be
tiresome. From the previous deﬁnition of LCM, it follows that we need only list the
multiples of the larger number. The LCM is simply the ﬁrst multiple of the larger
number that is divisible by the smaller number. For example, to ﬁnd the LCM of 3
and 4, we observe that
The multiples of 4 are:
4,
8,
12,
16,
20,
24,
4 is not
8 is not
12 is
divisible by 3. divisible by 3. divisible by 3.
Since 12 is the ﬁrst multiple of 4 that is divisible by 3, the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.
As expected, this is the same result that we obtained using the two-list method.

Finding the LCM by Listing the Multiples of the Largest Number
To ﬁnd the least common multiple of two (or more) whole numbers:
1.
Write multiples of the largest number by multiplying it by 
and
so on.
2.
Continue this process until you ﬁnd the ﬁrst multiple of the larger number
that is divisible by each of the smaller numbers.That multiple is their
LCM.

EXAMPLE 2
Find the LCM of 6 and 8.
Strategy We will write the multiples of the larger number, 8, until we ﬁnd one
that is divisible by the smaller number, 6.
WHY The LCM of 6 and 8 is the smallest multiple of 8 that is divisible by 6.
Solution
The 1st multiple of 8:
8 is not divisible by 6. (When we divide, we get
a remainder of 2.) Since 8 is not divisible by
6, ﬁnd the next multiple.
The 2nd multiple of 8:
16 is not divisible by 6. Find the next 
multiple.
The 3rd multiple of 8:
24 is divisible by 6. This is the LCM.
The ﬁrst multiple of 8 that is divisible by 6 is 24.Thus,

Find the LCM using prime factorization.
Another method for ﬁnding the LCM of two (or more) whole numbers uses prime
factorization. This method is especially helpful when working with larger numbers.
As an example, we will ﬁnd the LCM of 36 and 54. First, we ﬁnd their prime
factorizations:
Factor trees (or division 
ladders) can be used to 
ﬁnd the prime factorizations.
54  2  3  3  3
36  2  2  3  3
Caution!
The LCM 
is not the product of the prime factorization of
36 and the prime factorization of 54.That gives an incorrect answer of 2,052.
The LCM should contain all the prime factors of 36 and all the prime factors
of 54, but the prime factors that 36 and 54 have in common are not repeated.
LCM (36, 54)  2  2  3  3  2  3  3  3  1,944

The LCM of 36 and 54 must be divisible by 36 and 54. If the LCM is divisible by
36, it must have the prime factors of 36, which are 
If the LCM is divisible
by 54, it must have the prime factors of 54, which are 
The smallest
number that meets both requirements is
These are the prime factors of 36.
These are the prime factors of 54.
To ﬁnd the LCM, we perform the indicated multiplication:
LCM (36, 54)  2  2  3  3  3  108




2  2  3  3  3




2  3  3  3.
2  2  3  3.
The prime factorizations of 36 and 54 contain the numbers 2 and 3.
We see that
• The greatest number of times the factor 2 appears in any one of the prime
factorizations is twice and the LCM of 36 and 54 has 2 as a factor twice.
• The greatest number of times that 3 appears in any one of the prime
factorizations is three times and the LCM of 36 and 54 has 3 as a factor three
times.
These observations suggest a procedure to use to ﬁnd the LCM of two (or more)
numbers using prime factorization.

To ﬁnd the least common multiple of two (or more) whole numbers:
1.
Prime factor each number.
2.
The LCM is a product of prime factors, where each factor is used the
greatest number of times it appears in any one factorization.
EXAMPLE 4
Find the LCM of 24 and 60.
Strategy We will begin by ﬁnding the prime factorizations of 24 and 60.
WHY To ﬁnd the LCM, we need to determine the greatest number of times each
prime factor appears in any one factorization.
Solution
Step 1 Prime factor 24 and 60.
Division ladders (or factor trees) can be 
used to ﬁnd the prime factorizations.
Step 2 The prime factorizations of 24 and 60 contain the prime factors 
and 5.
To ﬁnd the LCM, we use each of these factors the greatest number of times it
appears in any one factorization.
• We will use the factor 2 three times, because 2 appears three times in the
factorization of 24. Circle 
as shown below.
• We will use the factor 3 once, because it appears one time in the
factorization of 24 and one time in the factorization of 60.When the
number of times a factor appears are equal, circle either one, but not both,
as shown below.
• We will use the factor 5 once, because it appears one time in the
factorization of 60. Circle the 5, as shown below.
Since there are no other prime factors in either prime factorization, we have
Use 2 three times.
Use 3 one time.
Use 5 one time.
Note that 120 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 24 and 60:

Find the GCF by listing factors.
We have seen that two whole numbers can have common multiples. They can also
have common factors. To explore this concept, let’s ﬁnd the factors of 26 and 39 and
see what factors they have in common.
To ﬁnd the factors of 26, we ﬁnd all the pairs of whole numbers whose product is
26.There are two possibilities:
Each of the numbers in the pairs is a factor of 26. From least to greatest, the factors
of 26 are 
and 26.
To ﬁnd the factors of 39, we ﬁnd all the pairs of whole numbers whose product is
39.There are two possibilities:
Each of the numbers in the pairs is a factor of 39. From least to greatest, the factors of
39 are 
and 39.As shown below, the common factors of 26 and 39 are 1 and 13.
These are the factors of 26.
These are the factors of 39.
Because 13 is the largest number that is a factor of both 26 and 39, it is called the
greatest common factor (GCF) of 26 and 39.We can write this in compact form as:
Read as “The greatest common factor of 26 and 39 is 13.”

Now Try Problem 87
Strategy We will ﬁnd the LCM of 4 and 6.
WHY Since one patient reaches the starting point of the workout every 4
minutes, and the other is there every 6 minutes, we want to ﬁnd the least common
multiple of those numbers. At that time, they will both be at the starting point of
the workout.
Solution
To ﬁnd the LCM, we prime factor 4 and 6, and circle each prime factor the
greatest number of times it appears in any one factorization.
Use the factor 2 two times, because 2 appears 
two times in the factorization of 4.
Use the factor 3 once, because it appears one 
time in the factorization of 6.
Since there are no other prime factors in either prime factorization, we have

In Example 7, we found that the GCF of 18 and 45 is 9. Note that 9 is the
greatest number that divides 18 and 45.
In general, the greatest common factor of two (or more) numbers is the largest
number that divides them exactly. For this reason, the greatest common factor is also

are natural rhythms of the body, called biorhythms,
that affect our physical, emotional, and mental cycles.
Our physical biorhythm cycle lasts 23 days, the
emotional biorhythm cycle lasts 28 days, and our
mental biorhythm cycle lasts 33 days. Each biorhythm
cycle has a high, low, and critical zone. If your three
cycles are together one day, all at their lowest point,
in how many more days will they be together again,
all at their lowest point?

Recall that numbers are combined with the operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division to create expressions. We often have to evaluate (ﬁnd
the value of) expressions that involve more than one operation. In this section, we
introduce an order-of-operations rule to follow in such cases.

Something is wrong. The ﬁrst part of the response (No price too high!) says to
buy the watch at any price. The second part (No! Price too high.) says not to buy it,
because it’s too expensive. The placement of the exclamation point makes us read
the two parts of the response differently, resulting in different meanings. When
reading a mathematical statement, the same kind of confusion is possible. For
example, consider the expression
We can evaluate this expression in two ways.We can add ﬁrst, and then multiply.

Different results 
If we don’t establish a uniform order of operations, the expression has two
different values. To avoid this possibility, we will always use the following order of
operations rule.


Order of Operations
1.
Perform all calculations within parentheses and other grouping symbols
following the order listed in Steps 2–4 below, working from the innermost
pair of grouping symbols to the outermost pair.
2.
Evaluate all exponential expressions.
3.
Perform all multiplications and divisions as they occur from left to right.
4.
Perform all additions and subtractions as they occur from left to right.
When grouping symbols have been removed, repeat Steps 2–4 to complete the
calculation.
If a fraction bar is present, evaluate the expression above the bar (called
the numerator) and the expression below the bar (called the denominator)
separately.Then perform the division indicated by the fraction bar, if possible.
It isn’t necessary to apply all of these steps in every problem. For example, the
expression 
does not contain any parentheses, and there are no exponential
expressions. So we look for multiplications and divisions to perform and proceed as
follows:
Do the multiplication ﬁrst.
Do the addition.

Strategy We will scan the expression to determine what operations need to be
performed. Then we will perform those operations, one at a time, following the
order of operations rule.
WHY If we don’t follow the correct order of operations, the expression can have
more than one value.
Solution
Since the expression does not contain any parentheses, we begin with Step 2 of
the order of operations rule: Evaluate all exponential expressions. We will write
the steps of the solution in horizontal form.

Find the mean (average) of a set of values.
The mean (sometimes called the arithmetic mean or average) of a set of numbers is
a value around which the values of the numbers are grouped. It gives you an
indication of the “center” of the set of numbers. To ﬁnd the mean of a set of
numbers, we must apply the order of operations rule.
Finding the Mean
To ﬁnd the mean (average) of a set of values, divide the sum of the values by
the number of values.

P E R I O D S
The position of a digit in a whole number
determines its place value. A place-value chart
shows the place value of each digit in the
number.
To make large whole numbers easier to read,
we use commas to separate their digits into
groups of three, called periods.
The place value of the digit 7 is 7 ten millions.
The digit 4 tells the number of thousands.

When we don’t need exact results, we often
round numbers.
Rounding a Whole Number
1.
To round a number to a certain place
value, locate the rounding digit in that
place.
2.
Look at the test digit, which is directly to
the right of the rounding digit.
3.
If the test digit is 5 or greater, round up by
adding 1 to the rounding digit and
replacing all of the digits to its right with 0.
If the test digit is less than 5, replace it and all
of the digits to its right with 0.
Round 9,842 to the nearest ten.
Rounding digit: tens column
9,842
Test digit: Since 2 is less than 5, leave the rounding digit
unchanged and replace the test digit with 0.
Thus, 9,842 rounded to the nearest ten is 9,840.
Round 63,179 to the nearest hundred.
Rounding digit: hundreds column
63,179
Test digit: Since 7 is 5 or greater, add 1 to the rounding digit and
replace all the digits to its right with 0.
Thus, 63,179 rounded to the nearest hundred is 63,200.

Problem Solving
To become a good problem solver, you need a
plan to follow, such as the following ﬁve-step
strategy for problem solving:
1.
Analyze the problem by reading it
carefully.What information is given?
What are you asked to ﬁnd? What
vocabulary is given? Often, a diagram or
table will help you visualize the facts of
the problem.
2.
Form a plan by translating the words of
the problem into numbers and symbols.
3.
Solve the problem by performing the
calculations.
4.
State the conclusion clearly. Be sure to
include the units in your answer.
5.
Check the result. An estimate is often
helpful to see whether an answer is
reasonable.

Prime Factors and Exponents
Numbers that are multiplied together are
called factors.
To factor a whole number means to express it
as the product of other whole numbers.
If a whole number is a factor of a given
number, it also divides the given number
exactly.

Personal Financial Advisor
Personal ﬁnancial advisors help people manage their money and teach them
how to make their money grow.They offer advice on how to budget
for monthly expenses,as well as how to save for
retirement.A bachelor’s degree in business,accounting,
ﬁnance,economics,or statistics provides good
preparation for the occupation.Strong communication
and problem-solving skills are equally important to achieve
success in this ﬁeld.
In Problem 90 of Study Set 2.2, you will see how a personal
ﬁnancial planner uses integers to determine whether a
duplex rental unit would be a money-making investment for a
client.

An Introduction to the Integers
We have seen that whole numbers can be used to describe many situations that arise
in everyday life. However, we cannot use whole numbers to express temperatures
below zero, the balance in a checking account that is overdrawn, or how far an object
is below sea level. In this section, we will see how negative numbers can be used to
describe these three situations as well as many others.

To describe a temperature of 2 degrees above zero, a balance of $50, or 600 feet above
sea level, we can use numbers called positive numbers. All positive numbers are
greater than 0, and we can write them with or without a positive sign
.

Graph integers on a number line.
In Section 1.1, we introduced the number line.We can use an extension of the number
line to learn about negative numbers.
Negative numbers can be represented on a number line by extending the line to
the left and drawing an arrowhead. Beginning at the origin (the 0 point), we move to
the left,marking equally spaced points as shown below.As we move to the right on the
number line, the values of the numbers increase.As we move to the left, the values of
the numbers decrease.

The absolute value of a number gives the distance between the number and 0 on
the number line. To indicate absolute value, the number is inserted between two
vertical bars, called the absolute value symbol. For example, we can write 
.
This is read as “The absolute value of negative 3 is 3,” and it tells us that the distance
between 
and 0 on the number line is 3 units. From the ﬁgure, we also see that

Because the symbol

to be strictly less than another number and the symbol

Add two integers that have the same sign.
We can use the number line to explain addition of integers. For example, to ﬁnd
, we begin at 0 and draw an arrow 4 units long that points to the right. It
represents positive 4. From the tip of that arrow, we draw a second arrow, 3 units
long, that points to the right. It represents positive 3. Since we end up at 7, it follows

Here are some observations about the process of adding two numbers that have
the same sign on a number line.
• The arrows representing the integers point in the same direction and they
build upon each other.
• The answer has the same sign as the integers that we added.
These observations illustrate the following rules.

Here are some observations about the process of adding two integers that have
different signs on a number line.
• The arrows representing the integers point in opposite directions.
• The longer of the two arrows determines the sign of the answer. If the longer
arrow represents a positive integer, the sum is positive. If it represents a
negative integer, the sum is negative.
These observations suggest the following rules.

Adding Two Integers That Have Different (Unlike) Signs
To add a positive integer and a negative integer, subtract the smaller absolute
value from the larger.
1.
If the positive integer has the larger absolute value, the ﬁnal answer 
is positive.
2.
If the negative integer has the larger absolute value, make the ﬁnal 
answer negative.
EXAMPLE 2
Add:
Strategy We will use the rule for adding two integers that have different signs.
WHY The addend 5 is positive and the addend 
is negative.
Solution
Step 1 To add two integers with different signs, we ﬁrst subtract the smaller
absolute value from the larger absolute value. Since
, which is 5, is smaller than
, which is 7, we begin by subtracting 5 from 7.
Step 2 Since the negative number,
, has the
larger absolute value,we attach a negative sign
to the result from step 1.Therefore,
Make the ﬁnal answer negative.

To evaluate expressions that contain several additions, we make repeated use of the
rules for adding two integers.
EXAMPLE 4
Evaluate:
Strategy Since there are no calculations within parentheses, no exponential
expressions, and no multiplication or division, we will perform the additions,
working from the left to the right.
WHY This is step 4 of the order of operations rule that was introduced in

so that we can add the positives and add the negatives separately.Then we will add
those results to obtain the ﬁnal answer.
WHY It is easier to add integers that have the same sign than integers that have
different signs. This approach lessens the possibility of an error, because we only
have to add integers that have different signs once.
Solution
Use the commutative property of addition 
to reorder the integers.

remains the same. This is also true for integers. For example,

Solve application problems by adding integers.
Since application problems are almost always written in words,the ability to understand
what you read is very important. Recall from Chapter 1 that words and phrases such as
gained, increased by, and rise indicate addition.

Dakota, the temperature was 
. The temperature then rose 49 degrees in just 
2 minutes.What was the temperature at 7:32 A.M.?
Strategy We will carefully read the problem looking for a key word or phrase.
WHY Key words and phrases indicate what arithmetic operations should be used
to solve the problem.
Solution The phrase rose 49 degrees indicates addition. With that in mind, we
translate the words of the problem to numbers and symbols.

Canada is the largest U.S. trading partner.To calculate the 
2007 U.S. trade balance with Canada, we add the $249 
billion worth of U.S. exports to Canada (considered positive)
to the $317 billion worth of U.S. imports from Canada (considered negative).
We can use a calculator to perform the addition:
We do not have to do anything special to enter a positive number. Negative
numbers are entered using either direct or reverse entry, depending on the
type of calculator you have.
To enter 317 using reverse entry, press the change-of-sign key 
after

Solve application problems 
by subtracting integers.
In this section, we will discuss a rule that is helpful when subtracting signed numbers.
1
Use the subtraction rule.
The subtraction problem 
can be thought of as taking away 4 from 6.We can use
a number line to illustrate this. Beginning at 0, we draw an arrow of length 6 units long
that points to the right. It represents positive 6. From the tip of that arrow, we draw a
second arrow, 4 units long, that points to the left. It represents taking away 4. Since we
end up at 2, it follows that 
.
6  4  2
6  4
Note that the illustration above also represents the addition
. We
see that
Subtracting 4 from 6 . . .
is the same as . . .
adding the opposite of 4 to 6.
The results are the same.
This observation suggests the following rule.

Put more simply, this rule says that subtraction is the same as adding the opposite.
After rewriting a subtraction as addition of the opposite, we then use one of the
rules for the addition of signed numbers discussed in Section 2.2 to ﬁnd the result.
You won’t need to use this rule for every subtraction problem.For example,
is obviously 2; it does not need to be rewritten as adding the opposite. But for more
complicated problems such as 
or
, where the result is not obvious,
the subtraction rule will be quite helpful.

Rule for Subtraction
To subtract two integers, add the ﬁrst integer to the opposite (additive inverse)
of the integer to be subtracted.
EXAMPLE 1
Subtract and check the result:
a.
b.
c.
Strategy To ﬁnd each difference, we will apply the rule for subtraction: Add the
ﬁrst integer to the opposite of the integer to be subtracted.
WHY It is easy to make an error when subtracting signed numbers. We will
probably be more accurate if we write each subtraction as addition of the opposite.
Solution
a. We read 
as “negative six minus four.”Thus, the number to be
subtracted is 4. Subtracting 4 is the same as adding its opposite,
.
Change the subtraction to addition.
Use the rule for adding two
integers with the same sign.
Change the number being 
subtracted to its opposite.
To check, we add the difference,
, and the subtrahend, 4.We should get the
minuend,
.

Evaluate expressions involving subtraction and addition.
Expressions can involve repeated subtraction or combinations of subtraction and
addition.To evaluate them,we use the order of operations rule discussed in Section 1.9.
EXAMPLE 3
Evaluate:
Strategy This expression involves two subtractions. We will write each
subtraction as addition of the opposite and then evaluate the expression using the
order of operations rule.
WHY It is easy to make an error when subtracting signed numbers. We will
probably be more accurate if we write each subtraction as addition of the opposite.
Solution We apply the rule for subtraction twice and then perform the additions,
working from left to right. (We could also add the positives and the negatives
separately, and then add those results.)
Add the opposite of 2, which is 2. Add
the opposite of 10, which is 10.

within parentheses, we write 
2  (24) within brackets.
Within the brackets, add 2 and 24. Since
only one set of grouping symbols is

Subtraction ﬁnds the difference between two numbers. When we ﬁnd the difference
between the maximum value and the minimum value of a collection of measurements,
we are ﬁnding the range of the values.

Things are constantly changing in our daily lives. The amount of money we have
in the bank, the price of gasoline, and our ages are examples. In mathematics, the
operation of subtraction is used to measure change. To ﬁnd the change in a quantity,
we subtract the earlier value from the later value.
Change  later value  earlier value
The ﬁve-step problem-solving strategy introduced in Section 1.6 can be used to
solve more complicated application problems.
WHY It is easy to make an error when subtracting signed numbers. We will
probably be more accurate if we write each subtraction as addition of the opposite.
Solution We apply the rule for subtraction twice. Then we will add the positives
and the negatives separately, and add those results. (By the commutative and
associative properties of addition, we can add the integers in any order.)
Simplify: (6)  6. Add the opposite of 4,
which is 4, and add the opposite of 51,
which is 51.
Reorder the integers. Then group the positives
together and group the negatives together.

(or 
inverse) of 8.
2. When we change a number to its opposite, we say we
have changed (or reversed) its 
.
3. To evaluate an expression means to ﬁnd its 
.
4. The difference between the maximum and the
minimum value of a collection of measurements is
called the 
of the values.
CONCEPTS
Fill in the blanks.
5. To subtract two integers, add the ﬁrst integer to the
(additive inverse) of the integer to be
subtracted.

Multiplying Integers
Multiplication of integers is very much like multiplication of whole numbers.The only
difference is that we must determine whether the answer is positive or negative.
When we multiply two nonzero integers, they either have different signs or they
have the same sign.This means that there are two possibilities to consider.
Objectives
1
Multiply two integers that have
different signs.
2
Multiply two integers that have
the same sign.
3
Perform several multiplications to
evaluate expressions.
4
Evaluate exponential expressions
that have negative bases.
5
Solve application problems by
multiplying integers.

Multiply two integers that have different signs.
To develop a rule for multiplying two integers that have different signs, we will ﬁnd
, which is the product of a positive integer and negative integer.We say that the
signs of the factors are unlike. By the deﬁnition of multiplication,
means that we
are to add 
four times.
Write 3 as an addend four times.
Use the rule for adding two integers that have the same sign.
The result is negative.As a check,think in terms of money.If you lose $3 four times,you
have lost a total of $12,which is written 
.This example illustrates the following rule.

Multiply two integers that have the same sign.
To develop a rule for multiplying two integers that have the same sign, we will ﬁrst
consider 
,which is the product of two positive integers.We say that the signs of the
factors are like. By the deﬁnition of multiplication,
means that we are to add 3

Write 3 as an addend four times.
The result is 12, which is a positive number.
As expected, the result is positive.
To develop a rule for multiplying two negative integers, consider the following
list, where we multiply 
by factors that decrease by 1.We know how to ﬁnd the ﬁrst
four products. Graphing those results on a number line is helpful in determining the
last three products.

Using Your CALCULATOR
Multiplication with Negative Numbers
At Thanksgiving time, a large supermarket chain offered customers a free
turkey with every grocery purchase of $200 or more. Each turkey cost the
store $8, and 10,976 people took advantage of the offer. Since each of the
10,976 turkeys given away represented a loss of $8 (which can be expressed 
as $8), the company lost a total of 10,976($8).To perform this
multiplication using a calculator, we enter the following:
Reverse entry: 10976
8
Direct entry: 10976

The negative result indicates that with the turkey giveaway promotion, the
supermarket chain lost $87,808.

Properties of Multiplication
Commutative property of multiplication:
The order in which integers are
multiplied does not change their product.
Associative property of multiplication:
The way in which integers are
grouped does not change their product.
Multiplication property of 0:
The product of any integer and 0 is 0.
Multiplication property of 1:
The product of any integer and 1 is that integer.
Another approach to evaluate expressions like those in Example 3 is to use the
properties of multiplication to reorder and regroup the factors in a helpful way.

When a negative integer is raised to an even power, the result is positive.
When a negative integer is raised to an odd power, the result is negative.
Although the exponential expressions 
and 
look similar, they are not
the same. We read 
as “negative 3 squared” and 
as “the opposite of the
square of three.” When we evaluate them, it becomes clear that they are not
equivalent.

Oceanography
Scientists lowered an underwater vessel called
a submersible into the Paciﬁc Ocean to record
the water temperature. The ﬁrst measurement
was made 75 feet below sea level, and more
were made every 75 feet until it reached the
ocean ﬂoor. Find the depth of the submersible
when the 25th measurement was made.
Analyze
• The ﬁrst measurement was made 75 feet below sea level.
Given
• More measurements were made every 75 feet.
Given
• Find the depth of the submersible when it made the 25th 
measurement.
Find
Form If we use negative numbers to represent the depths at which the
measurements were made, then the ﬁrst was at 
feet.The depth (in feet) of the
submersible when the 25th measurement was made can be found by adding 
twenty-ﬁve times. This repeated addition can be calculated more simply by
multiplication.

We can use the relationship between multiplication and division to help develop
rules for dividing integers.There are four cases to consider.
Case 1: A positive integer divided by a positive integer
From years of experience, we already know that the result is positive. Therefore, the
quotient of two positive integers is positive.
Case 2: A negative integer divided by a negative integer
As an example, consider the division

SELLING BOATS The owner of a sail

By how much was the price of the

Solve application problems by dividing integers.
Problems that involve forming equal-sized groups can be solved by division.
EXAMPLE 4
Real Estate
Over the
course of a year, a homeowner reduced the
price of his house by an equal amount each
month, because it was not selling. By the end
of the year, the price was $11,400 less than at
the beginning of the year. By how much was
the price of the house reduced each month?
Analyze
• The homeowner dropped the price $11,400 in 1 year.
Given
• The price was reduced by an equal amount each month.
Given
• By how much was the price of the house reduced each month?

Solve To ﬁnd the quotient, we use the rule for dividing two integers that have
different signs. First, we ﬁnd the absolute values:
and
.
Divide the absolute values, 11,400 and 12,
to get 950. Then make the ﬁnal answer
negative.
State The negative result indicates that the price of the house was reduced by $950
each month.
Check We can use estimation to check the result. A reduction of $1,000 each
month would cause the price to drop $12,000 in 1 year. It seems reasonable that a
reduction of $950 each month would cause the price to drop $11,400 in a year.

Order of Operations and Estimation
In this chapter, we have discussed the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying,
and dividing integers. Now we will use those rules in combination with the order of
operations rule from Section 1.9 to evaluate expressions involving more than one
operation.
Objectives
1
Use the order of operations rule.
2
Evaluate expressions containing
grouping symbols.
3
Evaluate expressions containing
absolute values.
4
Estimate the value of an
expression.
1
Use the order of operations rule.
Recall that if we don’t establish a uniform order of operations, an expression such as
can have more than one value. To avoid this possibility, always use the
following rule for the order of operations.
2  3  6
Order of Operations
1.
Perform all calculations within parentheses and other grouping symbols in
the following order listed in Steps 2–4 below, working from the innermost
pair of grouping symbols to the outermost pair.
2.
Evaluate all the exponential expressions.
3.
Perform all multiplications and divisions as they occur from left to right.
4.
Perform all additions and subtractions as they occur from left to right.
When grouping symbols have been removed, repeat Steps 2–4 to complete the
calculation.
If a fraction bar is present, evaluate the expression above the bar (called the
numerator) and the expression below the bar (the denominator) separately.
Then perform the division indicated by the fraction bar, if possible.
We can use this rule to evaluate expressions involving integers.
EXAMPLE 1
Evaluate:
Strategy We will scan the expression to determine what operations need to be
performed. Then we will perform those operations, one at a time, following the
order of operations rule.
WHY If we don’t follow the correct order of operations, the expression can have
more than one value.
Solution Although the expression contains parentheses, there are no calculations
to perform within them. We begin with step 2 of the order of operations rule:
Evaluate all exponential expressions.
Evaluate the exponential expression: 
(3)2  9.
Do the multiplication: 4(9)  36.
If it is helpful, use the subtraction rule: 
Add the opposite of 2, which is 2.
Do the addition.

and 
are not the
same.
Evaluate the exponential expressions: 
22  (2  2)  4 and (2)2  2(2)  4.

Evaluate expressions containing grouping symbols.
Recall that parentheses (
), brackets [
], absolute value symbols @

fraction bar — are called grouping symbols. When evaluating expressions, we must
perform all calculations within parentheses and other grouping symbols ﬁrst.

WHY By the order of operations rule, we must perform all calculations within
parentheses and other grouping symbols (such as absolute value bars) ﬁrst.
Solution
If it is helpful, use the subtraction rule
within the absolute value symbol: Add the
opposite of 2, which is 2.
Do the addition within the absolute value symbol:
6  (2)  8.
Find the absolute value: @8@  8.
Do the multiplication: 4(8)  32.
If it is helpful, use the subtraction rule:

Estimate the value of an expression.
Recall that the idea behind estimation is to simplify calculations by using rounded
numbers that are close to the actual values in the problem. When an exact answer is
not necessary and a quick approximation will do, we can use estimation.
EXAMPLE 11
The Stock Market
The change in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average is announced at the end of
each trading day to give a general
picture of how the stock market is
performing. A positive change means a
good performance, while a negative
change indicates a poor performance.
The week of October 13–17, 2008, had
some record changes, as shown below.
Round each number to the nearest ten
and estimate the net gain or loss of
points in the Dow that week.
Strategy To estimate the net gain or loss, we will round each number to the

Subtracting Integers
The rule for subtraction is helpful when
subtracting signed numbers.
To subtract two integers, add the ﬁrst integer
to the opposite of the integer to be subtracted.
Subtracting is the same as adding the opposite.
After rewriting a subtraction as addition of the
opposite, use one of the rules for the addition
of signed numbers discussed in Section 2.2 to
ﬁnd the result.
Subtract:
Add the opposite of 5, which is 5.
Add the opposite of 7, which is 7.

To evaluate expressions that contain several
multiplications,we make repeated use of the rules
for multiplying two integers.
Another approach to evaluate expressions is to use

Dividing two integers
To divide two integers, divide their absolute values.
1. The quotient of two integers that have the same
(like) signs is positive.
2. The quotient of two integers that have different
(unlike) signs is negative.
To check division of integers, multiply the quotient
and the divisor. You should get the dividend.

School Guidance Counselor
School guidance counselors plan academic programs and help students choose
the best courses to take to achieve their educational goals.
Counselors often meet with students to discuss the life
skills needed for personal and social growth. To prepare
for this career,guidance counselors take classes in an area
of mathematics called statistics, where they learn how to
collect,analyze,explain,and present data.
In Problem 109 of Study Set 3.4, you will see how a
counselor must be able to add fractions to better understand
a graph that shows students’study habits.

The Language of Mathematics
The phrase improper fraction is somewhat
misleading. In algebra and other mathematics courses, we often use such
fractions “properly” to solve many types of problems.
There are times when a negative fraction is needed to describe a quantity. For
example, if an earthquake causes a road to sink seven-eighths of an inch, the amount
of downward movement can be represented by 
Negative fractions can be written
in three ways. The negative sign can appear in the numerator, in the denominator, or
in front of the fraction.
Notice that the examples above agree with the rule from Chapter 2 for dividing
integers with different (unlike) signs: the quotient of a negative integer and a positive
integer is negative.

EXAMPLE 2
Write fractions that represent the shaded and unshaded
portions of the ﬁgure below.
Strategy We will determine the number of equal parts into which the ﬁgure is
divided.Then we will determine how many of those parts are shaded.
WHY The denominator of a fraction shows the number of equal parts in the
whole.The numerator shows how many of those parts are being considered.
Solution
Since the ﬁgure is divided into 3 equal parts, the denominator of the fraction is 3.
Since 2 of those parts are shaded, the numerator is 2, and we say that
of the ﬁgure is shaded.
Write: 
Since 1 of the 3 equal parts of the ﬁgure is not shaded, the numerator is 1, and we
say that

Simplify special fraction forms.
Recall from Section 1.5 that a fraction bar indicates division.This fact helps us simplify
four special fraction forms.
• Fractions that have the same numerator and denominator: In this case, we
have a number divided by itself.The result is 1 (provided the numerator and
denominator are not 0).We call each of the following fractions a form of 1.
. . .
• Fractions that have a denominator of 1: In this case, we have a number
divided by 1.The result is simply the numerator.
• Fractions that have a numerator of 0: In this case, we have division of 0.
The result is 0 (provided the denominator is not 0).
• Fractions that have a denominator of 0: In this case, we have division by 0.
The division is undeﬁned.

Deﬁne equivalent fractions.
Fractions can look different but still represent the same part of a whole. To illustrate
this,consider the identical rectangular regions on the right.The ﬁrst one is divided into
10 equal parts. Since 6 of those parts are red,
of the ﬁgure is shaded.
The second ﬁgure is divided into 5 equal parts. Since 3 of those parts are red,
of
the ﬁgure is shaded. We can conclude that 
because 
and represent the same
shaded portion of the ﬁgure.We say that 
and are equivalent fractions.
Equivalent Fractions
Two fractions are equivalent if they represent the same number. Equivalent
fractions represent the same portion of a whole.
Build equivalent fractions.
Writing a fraction as an equivalent fraction with a larger denominator is called
building the fraction. To build a fraction, we use a familiar property from Chapter 1
that is also true for fractions:
Multiplication Property of 1
The product of any fraction and 1 is that fraction.
We also use the following rule for multiplying fractions. (It will be discussed in
greater detail in the next section.) 
Multiplying Fractions
To multiply two fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the
denominators.
To build an equivalent fraction for with a denominator of 8, we ﬁrst ask,“What
number times 2 equals 8?” To answer that question we divide 8 by 2 to get 4. Since we
need to multiply the denominator of
by 4 to obtain a denominator of 8,it follows that
should be the form of 1 that is used to build an equivalent fraction for

EXAMPLE 9
Simplify:
Strategy We will prime factor the numerator and denominator.Then we will look
for any factors common to the numerator and denominator and remove them.
WHY We need to make sure that the numerator and denominator have no
common factors other than 1. If that is the case, then the fraction is in simplest form.
Solution
To prepare to simplify, write 63 and 36 in 
prime-factored form.
Simplify by removing the common factors 
of 3 from the numerator and denominator.
Multiply the remaining factors in the numerator: 1  1  7  7. 
Multiply the remaining factors in the denominator: 2  2  1  1  4.
Success Tip
If you recognized that 63 and 36 have a common factor of 9, you
may remove that common factor from the numerator and denominator without
writing the prime factorizations. However, make sure that the numerator and
denominator of the resulting fraction do not have any common factors. If they
do, continue to simplify.
Factor 63 as 7  9 and 36 as 4  9, and then remove the
common factor of 9 from the numerator and denominator.

Use the following steps to simplify a fraction.
Simplifying Fractions
To simplify a fraction, remove factors equal to 1 of the form 
and so
on, using the following procedure:
1.
Factor (or prime factor) the numerator and denominator to determine their
common factors.
2.
Remove factors equal to 1 by replacing each pair of factors common to the
numerator and denominator with the equivalent fraction 
3.
Multiply the remaining factors in the numerator and in the denominator.
Negative fractions are simpliﬁed in the same way as positive fractions. Just
remember to write a negative sign  in front of each step of the solution.For example,
to simplify 
we proceed as follows:

3.2
Multiplying Fractions
217
In the next three sections, we discuss how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
fractions.We begin with the operation of multiplication.
Multiply fractions.
To develop a rule for multiplying fractions, let’s consider a real-life application.
Suppose 
of the last page of a school
newspaper is devoted to campus sports
coverage.To show this, we can divide the page
into ﬁfths, and shade 3 of them red.
Furthermore, suppose that of the sports
coverage is about women’s teams. We can
show that portion of the page by dividing the
already colored region into two halves, and
shading one of them in purple.
To ﬁnd the fraction represented by the
purple shaded region, the page needs to be
divided into equal-size parts. If we extend the
dashed line downward, we see there are 10
equal-sized parts. The purple shaded parts are 
3 out of 10, or 
of the page. Thus,
of the
last page of the school newspaper is devoted to
women’s sports.
In this example, we have found that
of
is
Since 
the 
key 
word 
of
indicates
multiplication, and the key word is
means equals, we can translate this
statement to symbols.

Two observations can be made from this result.
• The numerator of the answer is the product of the numerators of the original
fractions.
1  3  3
Answer
2  5  10
• The denominator of the answer is the product of the denominators of the
original fractions.
These observations illustrate the following rule for multiplying two fractions.
Multiplying Fractions
To multiply two fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the
denominators. Simplify the result, if possible.
Success Tip
In the newspaper example, we found a part of a part of a page.
Multiplying proper fractions can be thought of in this way.When taking a part
of a part of something, the result is always smaller than the original part that
you began with.

we multiply two fractions with like signs,the product is positive.When we multiply two
fractions with unlike signs, the product is negative.

Simplify answers when multiplying fractions.
After multiplying two fractions, we need to simplify the result, if possible.To do that,
we can use the procedure discussed in Section 3.1 by removing pairs of common
factors of the numerator and denominator.

Success Tip
If you recognized that 4 and 8 have a common factor of 4, you
may remove that common factor from the numerator and denominator of the
product without writing the prime factorizations. However, make sure that the
numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction do not have any common
factors. If they do, continue to simplify.

common factors of 4 and 5 in the numerator
and denominator.

Caution!
In Example 5, it was very helpful to prime factor and simplify when
we did (the third step of the solution). If, instead, you ﬁnd the product of the
numerators and the product of the denominators, the resulting fraction is difﬁcult
to simplify because the numerator, 126, and the denominator, 420, are large.

Evaluate exponential expressions that have fractional bases.
We have evaluated exponential expressions that have whole-number bases and

us how many times to write that fraction as a factor. For example,

Strategy We will write each exponential expression as a product of repeated
factors, and then perform the multiplication.This requires that we identify the base
and the exponent.
WHY The exponent tells the number of times the base is to be written as a factor.
Solution 
Recall that exponents are used to represent repeated multiplication.
a. We read 
as “one-fourth raised to the third power,” or as “one-fourth,
cubed.”
Since the exponent is 3, write the base, 
as a factor 3 times.
b. We read 
as “negative two-thirds raised to the second power,” or as
“negative two-thirds, squared.”
Since the exponent is 2, write the base, 
as a factor 2 times.
c. We read 
as  “the opposite of two-thirds squared.” Recall that if the 
 symbol is not within the parantheses, it is not part of the base.
Since the exponent is 2, write the base, 
as 
a factor 2 times.

Find the area of a triangle.
As the ﬁgures below show, a triangle has three sides. The length of the base of the 
triangle can be represented by the letter b and the height by the letter h.The height of
a triangle is always perpendicular (makes a square corner) to the base. This is shown
by using the symbol .
Recall that the area of a ﬁgure is the amount of surface that it encloses.The area

ﬂowered plants with white-ﬂowered plants and found
that of the offspring plants had purple ﬂowers and 
of them had white ﬂowers. Refer to the illustration

Dividing Fractions
229
We will now discuss how to divide fractions.The fraction multiplication skills that you
learned in Section 3.2 will also be useful in this section.
Find the reciprocal of a fraction.
Division with fractions involves working with reciprocals. To present the concept of
reciprocal, we consider the problem 
Any whole number divided by 1 is equal to that number.
The product of
and is 1.
Whenever the product of two numbers is 1, we say that those numbers are 
reciprocals. Therefore,
and are reciprocals. To ﬁnd the reciprocal of a fraction, we
invert the numerator and the denominator.
Reciprocals
Two numbers are called reciprocals if their product is 1.
Caution!
Zero does not have a reciprocal, because the product of 0 and a
number can never be 1.

Divide fractions.
To develop a rule for dividing fractions, let’s consider a real-life application.
Suppose that the manager of a candy store buys large bars of chocolate and
divides each one into four equal parts to sell. How many fourths can be obtained from
5 bars?
We are asking,“How many ’s are there in 5?”To answer the question, we need to
use the operation of division.We can represent this division as 5 
There are 20 fourths in the 5 bars of chocolate. Two observations can be made
from this result.
• This division problem involves a fraction: 5 
• Although we were asked to ﬁnd 5 
we solved the problem using
multiplication instead of division: 5  4  20.That is, division by (a fraction)
is the same as multiplication by 4 (its reciprocal).

Solve application problems 
by adding and subtracting
fractions.
In mathematics and everyday life, we can only add (or subtract) objects that are
similar. For example, we can add dollars to dollars, but we cannot add dollars to
oranges.This concept is important when adding or subtracting fractions.
Add and subtract fractions that have the same denominator.
Consider the problem 

When we write it in words, it is apparent that we are
adding similar objects.
Similar objects
Because the denominators of
and are the same, we say that they have a common
denominator. Since the fractions have a common denominator, we can add them.
The following ﬁgure explains the addition process.
three-ﬁfths
one-ﬁfth
four-ﬁfths
We can make some observations about the addition shown in the ﬁgure.
The sum of the numerators is the numerator of the answer.
The answer is a fraction that has the same denominator 
as the two fractions that were added.
These observations illustrate the following rule.
Adding and Subtracting Fractions That Have the Same Denominator
To add (or subtract) fractions that have the same denominator, add (or
subtract) their numerators and write the sum (or difference) over the common
denominator. Simplify the result, if possible.
Caution! We do not add fractions by adding the numerators and adding the
denominators!
The same caution applies when subtracting fractions.

Not similar objects
To add (or subtract) fractions with different denominators, we express them as
equivalent fractions that have a common denominator. The smallest common
denominator, called the least or lowest common denominator, is usually the easiest
common denominator to use.
Least Common Denominator
The least common denominator (LCD) for a set of fractions is the smallest
number each denominator will divide exactly (divide with no remainder).
The denominators of
and 
are 5 and 3. The numbers 5 and 3 divide many
numbers exactly (30, 45, and 60, to name a few), but the smallest number that they
divide exactly is 15.Thus, 15 is the LCD for and 
To ﬁnd 
we build equivalent fractions that have denominators of 15. (This
procedure was introduced in Section 3.1.) Then we use the rule for adding fractions
that have the same denominator.

We need to multiply this denominator by 5 to obtain 15.

Success Tip
In Example 6, did you notice that the denominator 5 is a factor of
the denominator 15, and that the LCD is 15. In general, when adding (or
subtracting) two fractions with different denominators, if the smaller denominator
is a factor of the larger denominator, the larger denominator is the LCD.

Find the LCD to add and subtract fractions.
When we add or subtract fractions that have different denominators, the least
common denominator is not always obvious. We can use a concept studied earlier to
determine the LCD for more difﬁcult problems that involve larger denominators. To
illustrate this, let’s ﬁnd the least common denominator of
and 
(Note, the LCD is
not 80.)
We have learned that both 8 and 10 must divide the LCD exactly.This divisibility
requirement should sound familiar. Recall the following fact from Section 1.8.
The Least Common  Multiple (LCM)
The least common multiple (LCM) of two whole numbers is the smallest
whole number that is divisible by both of those numbers.
Thus, the least common denominator of
and 
is simply the least common multiple
of 8 and 10.
We can ﬁnd the LCM of 8 and 10 by listing multiples of the larger number, 10,
until we ﬁnd one that is divisible by the smaller number, 8. (This method is explained
in Example 2 of Section 1.8.)
Multiples of 10:
10,
20,
30,
40,
50,
60, . . .
This is the ﬁrst multiple of 10 that 
is divisible by 8 (no remainder).
Since the LCM of 8 and 10 is 40, it follows that the LCD of
and 
is 40.
We can also ﬁnd the LCM of 8 and 10 using prime factorization. We begin by
prime factoring 8 and 10. (This method is explained in Example 4 of Section 1.8.)

The LCM of 8 and 10 is a product of prime factors, where each factor is used the
greatest number of times it appears in any one factorization.
• We will use the factor 2 three times, because 2 appears three times in the
factorization of 8. Circle 2  2  2, as shown on the previous page.

of 10. Circle 5 as shown on the previous page.
Since there are no other prime factors in either prime factorization, we have
Use 2 three times.
Use 5 one time.
Finding the LCD
The least common denominator (LCD) of a set of fractions is the least
common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the fractions.Two ways to
ﬁnd the LCM of the denominators are as follows:
• Write the multiples of the largest denominator in increasing order, until
one is found that is divisible by the other denominators.
• Prime factor each denominator.The LCM is a product of prime factors,
where each factor is used the greatest number of times it appears in any
one factorization.

WHY To write an improper fraction, we need to ﬁnd its numerator and its
denominator.To write a mixed number, we need to ﬁnd its whole number part and
its fractional part.
Solution 
Since each disk is divided into 5 equal parts, the denominator of the improper
fraction is 5. Since a total of 11 of those parts are shaded, the numerator is 11, and
we say that
is shaded.
Write: 
Since 2 whole disks are shaded, the whole number part of the mixed number
is 2. Since 1 out of 5 of the parts of the last disk is shaded, the fractional part of the
mixed number is , and we say that
is shaded.

We can obtain the same result with far less work. To change 
to an improper
fraction, we simply multiply 5 by 2 and add 1 to get the numerator, and keep the
denominator of 5.
This example illustrates the following procedure.
Writing a Mixed Number as an Improper Fraction
To write a mixed number as an improper fraction:
1.
Multiply the denominator of the fraction by the whole-number part.
2.
Add the numerator of the fraction to the result from Step 1.
3.
Write the sum from Step 2 over the original denominator.

method shown in Example 2 on the positive mixed number. Once that procedure is
completed, write a  sign in front of the result. For example,
Write improper fractions as mixed numbers.
To write an improper fraction as a mixed number, we must ﬁnd two things: the whole-
number part and the fractional part of the mixed number. To develop a procedure to
do this, let’s consider the improper fraction . To ﬁnd the number of groups of 3 in 7,
we can divide 7 by 3. This will ﬁnd the whole-number part of the mixed number. The
remainder is the numerator of the fractional part of the mixed number.

Multiply and divide mixed numbers.
We will use the same procedures for multiplying and dividing mixed numbers as those
that were used in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 to multiply and divide fractions. However, we
must write the mixed numbers as improper fractions before we actually multiply or
divide.
Multiplying and Dividing Mixed Numbers
To multiply or divide mixed numbers, ﬁrst change the mixed numbers to
improper fractions.Then perform the multiplication or division of the fractions.
Write the result as a mixed number or a whole number in simplest form.

Success Tip
We can use rounding to check the results when multiplying
mixed numbers. If the fractional part of the mixed number is or greater,
round up by adding 1 to the whole-number part and dropping the fraction.
If the fractional part of the mixed number is less than , round down by
dropping the fraction and using only the whole-number part.To check the
answer 
from Example 5, part a, we proceed as follows:
Since 
is greater than , round 
up to 2.
Since 
is less than , round 
down to 2.
Since 
is close to 4, it is a reasonable answer.

Adding and Subtracting Mixed Numbers
267
In this section, we discuss several methods for adding and subtracting mixed numbers.
Add mixed numbers.
We can add mixed numbers by writing them as improper fractions. To do so, we 
follow these steps.
Adding Mixed Numbers: Method 1
1.
Write each mixed number as an improper fraction.
2.
Write each improper fraction as an equivalent fraction with a denominator
that is the LCD.
3.
Add the fractions.
4.
Write the result as a mixed number, if desired.
Method 1 works well when the whole-number parts of the mixed numbers are small.

Add mixed numbers.
2
Add mixed numbers in vertical
form.
3
Subtract mixed numbers.

Solve application problems by
adding and subtracting mixed
numbers.
EXAMPLE 1
Add:
Strategy We will write each mixed number as an improper fraction, and then use
the rule for adding two fractions that have different denominators.
WHY We cannot add the mixed numbers as they are; their fractional parts are not
similar objects.
Four and one-sixth
Two and three-fourths
Solution
Write
as improper fractions.
By inspection, we see that the lowest common denominator is 12.
To build 
and so that their denominators 
are 12, multiply each by a form of 1.
Write the improper fraction 
as a mixed number.

Success Tip
We can use rounding to check the results when adding (or
subtracting) mixed numbers.To check the answer 
from Example 1, we
proceed as follows:
Since is less than , round 
down to 4.
Since is greater than , round 
up to 3.
Since 
is close to 7, it is a reasonable answer.

Solution
Write

as improper fractions.
Since the smallest number the denominators 8 and 2 divide exactly is 8, the LCD is 8.
We will only need to build an equivalent fraction for .
To build so that its denominator is 8, 
multiply it by a form of 1.

We can also add mixed numbers by adding their whole-number parts and their
fractional parts.To do so, we follow these steps.
Adding Mixed Numbers: Method 2
1.
Write each mixed number as the sum of a whole number and a fraction.
2.
Use the commutative property of addition to write the whole numbers
together and the fractions together.
3.
Add the whole numbers and the fractions separately.
4.
Write the result as a mixed number, if necessary.
Method 2 works well when the whole number parts of the mixed numbers are
large.

Caution!
If we use method 1 to add the mixed numbers in Example 3, the
numbers we encounter are very large.As expected, the result is the same:
Write 
and 
as improper fractions.
The LCD is 63.
Note how large the numerators are.
Generally speaking,the larger the whole-number parts of the mixed numbers,the
more difﬁcult it becomes to add those mixed numbers using method 1.
Add mixed numbers in vertical form.
We can add mixed numbers quickly when they are written in vertical form by working
in columns. The strategy is the same as in Example 2: Add whole numbers to whole
numbers and fractions to fractions.

involves borrowing. When the fraction we are subtracting is greater than the fraction
we are subtracting it from, it is necessary to borrow.

EXAMPLE 8
Subtract:
Strategy We will perform the subtraction in vertical form with the fractions in a
column and the whole numbers lined up in columns. Then we will subtract the
fractional parts and the whole-number parts separately.
WHY It is often easier to subtract the fractional parts and the whole-number parts
of mixed numbers vertically.
Solution 
The LCD for 
and 
is 24.
Write the mixed number in vertical form.
Build 
and 
so that their denominators are 24.
Note that 
is greater than 
.
Since 
is greater than 
, borrow 1 
(in the form of 
) from 34 and add it to

We can use rounding to check the results when subtracting
mixed numbers.To check the answer 
from Example 8, we proceed as
follows:
Since 
is less than , round 
down to 34.
Since is greater than , round 
up to 12.
Since 
is close to 22, it is a reasonable answer.

Fractions and Mixed Numbers

We have seen that the order of operations rule is used to evaluate expressions that
contain more than one operation. In Chapter 1, we used it to evaluate expressions
involving whole numbers, and in Chapter 2, we used it to evaluate expressions
involving integers. We will now use it to evaluate expressions involving fractions and
mixed numbers.
Use the order of operations rule.
Recall from Section 1.9 that if we don’t establish a uniform order of operations, an
expression can have more than one value.To avoid this possibility, we must always use
the following rule.
Order of Operations
1.
Perform all calculations within parentheses and other grouping symbols
following the order listed in Steps 2–4 below, working from the innermost
pair of grouping symbols to the outermost pair.
2.
Evaluate all exponential expressions.
3.
Perform all multiplications and divisions as they occur from left to right.
4.
Perform all additions and subtractions as they occur from left to right.
When grouping symbols have been removed, repeat Steps 2–4 to complete the
calculation.
If a fraction bar is present, evaluate the expression above the bar (called the
numerator) and the expression below the bar (called the denominator)
separately.Then perform the division indicated by the fraction bar, if possible.

Strategy We will scan the expression to determine what operations need to be
performed. Then we will perform those operations, one-at-a-time, following the
order of operations rule.
WHY If we don’t follow the correct order of operations, the expression can have
more than one value.
Solution
Although the expression contains parentheses,there are no calculations to perform
within them. We will begin with step 2 of the rule: Evaluate all exponential
expressions.We will write the steps of the solution in horizontal form.

Simplify:
Strategy Recall that a fraction bar is a type of grouping symbol. We will work
above and below the main fraction bar separately to write 
as a single fraction
and 
as an improper fraction.
WHY The numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction must be
written as single fractions before dividing.
Solution
In the numerator, write 7 as .  The LCD for the numerator is 3.
Build  
so that it has a denominator of 3. 
In the denominator, write 
as the improper fraction 
.
Multiply in the numerator.
In the numerator of the complex fraction, subtract the
numerators: 21  2  19. Then write the difference over the
common denominator 3.
Multiply the ﬁrst fraction by the reciprocal of 
, which is 
.
Multiply the remaining factors in the numerator.
Multiply the remaining factors in the denominator.

A fraction is in simplest form, or lowest terms,
when the numerator and denominator have no
common factors other than 1.
Is 
in simplest form?
The factors of the numerator, 6, are: 1, 2, 3, 6.
The factors of the denominator, 14, are: 1, 2, 7, 14.
Since the numerator and denominator have a common factor of 2, the
fraction 
is not in simplest form.

To simplify a fraction, we write it in simplest
form by removing a factor equal to 1:
1. Factor (or prime factor) the numerator
and denominator to determine their
common factors.
2. Remove factors equal to 1 by replacing
each pair of factors common to the
numerator and denominator with the
equivalent fraction .
3. Multiply the remaining factors in the
numerator and in the denominator.

The least common denominator (LCD) of a set
of fractions is the least common multiple
(LCM) of the denominators of the fractions.
Two ways to ﬁnd the LCM of the denominators
are as follows:
• Write the multiples of the largest
denominator in increasing order, until
one is found that is divisible by the
other denominators.
• Prime factor each denominator.The
LCM is a product of prime factors,
where each factor is used the greatest
number of times it appears in any one
factorization.
Add and simplify:

Summary and Review
To add (or subtract) mixed numbers, we can
also write them in vertical form and add (or
subtract) the whole-number parts and the
fractional parts separately.
When we add mixed numbers, sometimes the
sum of the fractions is an improper fraction. If
that is the case, write the improper fraction as a
mixed number and carry its whole-number part
to the whole-number column.
Add:
Build to get the LCD, 21.
Add the fractions.
Add the whole numbers.
We don’t want an improper fraction in the answer.
Write 
as 
, carry the 1 to the whole-number column, and add it to
131 to get 132:

Subtraction of mixed numbers in vertical form
sometimes involves borrowing. When the
fraction we are subtracting is greater than the
fraction we are subtracting it from, borrowing
is necessary.
Subtract:

Since

Home Health Aide
Home health aides provide personalized care to the elderly and the disabled in
the patient’s own home. They help their patients take medicine,
eat,dress,and bathe.Home health aides need to have a
good number sense. They must accurately take the
patient’s temperature,pulse,and blood pressure,and
monitor the patient’s calorie intake and sleeping schedule.
In Problem 101 of Study Set 4.2, you will see how a home
health aide uses decimal addition and subtraction to chart a
patient’s temperature.

An Introduction to Decimals
The place value system for whole numbers that was introduced in Section 1.1 can be
extended to create the decimal numeration system. Numbers written using decimal
notation are often simply called decimals. They are used in measurement, because it
is easy to put them in order and compare them.And as you probably know,our money
system is based on decimals.
1
Identify the place value of a digit in a decimal number.
Like fraction notation,decimal notation is used to represent part of a whole.However,
when writing a number in decimal notation, we don’t use a fraction bar, nor is a
denominator shown. For example, consider the rectangular region below that has 1 of
10 equal parts colored red.We can use the fraction 
or the decimal 0.1 to describe the
amount of the ﬁgure that is shaded. Both are read as “one-tenth,” and we can write:
The square region on the right has 1 of 100 equal parts colored red. We can use
the fraction 
or the decimal 0.01 to describe the amount of the ﬁgure that is shaded.
Both are read as “one one-hundredth,” and we can write:
Decimals are written by entering the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 into place-
value columns that are separated by a decimal point. The following place-value chart
shows the names of the place-value columns. Those to the left of the decimal point
form the whole-number part of the decimal number, and they have the familiar names
ones, tens, hundreds, and so on.The columns to the right of the decimal point form the
fractional part. Their place value names are similar to those in the whole-number part,
but they end in “ths.” Notice that there is no oneths place in the chart.

The decimal 365.24219, entered in the place-value chart above, represents the
number of days it takes Earth to make one full orbit around the sun. We say that the
decimal is written in standard form (also called standard notation). Each of the 2’s in
365.24219 has a different place value because of its position.The place value of the red
2 is two tenths.The place value of the blue 2 is two thousandths.

EXAMPLE 1
Consider the decimal number:
2,864.709531
a. What is the place value of the digit 5?
b. Which digit tells the number of millionths?
Strategy We will locate the decimal point in 2,864.709531. Then, moving to the
right, we will name each column (tenths, hundredths, and so on) until we reach 5.
WHY It’s easier to remember the names of the columns if you begin at the 
decimal point and move to the right.
Solution
a. 2,864.709531
Say “Tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths” as you 
move from column to column.
5 ten-thousandths is the place value of the digit 5.
b. 2,864.709531
Say “Tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, hundred 
thousandths, millionths” as you move from column to column.
The digit 1 is in the millionths column.

Self Check 1
Consider the decimal number:
56,081.639724
a. What is the place value of the
digit 9?
b. Which digit tells the number
of hundred-thousandths?
Now Try Problem 17
We can write a whole number in decimal notation by placing a decimal point
immediately to its right and then entering a zero, or zeros, to the right of the decimal
point. For example,
Because 
A whole number
Place a decimal point here and enter 
a zero, or zeros, to the right of it.
When there is no whole-number part of a decimal, we can show that by entering
a zero directly to the left of the decimal point. For example,
Because
No whole-number part
Enter a zero here, if desired.
Negative decimals are used to describe many situations that arise in everyday life,
such as temperatures below zero and the balance in a checking account that is
overdrawn. For example, the coldest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was
at the Russian Vostok Station in Antarctica on July 21, 1983.

The decimal 4.458, entered in the place-value chart below, represents the time (in
seconds) that it took women’s record holder Melanie Troxel to cover a quarter mile in
her top-fuel dragster. Notice that the place values of the columns for the whole-
number part are 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and so on. We learned in Section 1.1 that the value
of each of those columns is 10 times greater than the column directly to its right.
The Language of Mathematics
The word decimal comes from the Latin
word decima, meaning a tenth part.
EXAMPLE 2
Write the decimal number 592.8674 in expanded form.

Reading a Decimal
To read a decimal:
1.
Look to the left of the decimal point and say the name of the whole 
number.
2.
The decimal point is read as “and.”
3.
Say the fractional part of the decimal as a whole number followed by the
name of the last place-value column of the digit that is the farthest to the
right.
We can use the steps for reading a decimal to write it in words.
EXAMPLE 3
Write each decimal in words and then as a fraction or mixed
number. You do not have to simplify the fraction.
a. Sputnik, the ﬁrst satellite launched into space, weighed 184.3 pounds.
b. Usain Bolt of Jamaica holds the men’s world record in the 100-meter dash:
9.69 seconds.
c. A one-dollar bill is 0.0043 inch thick.
d. Liquid mercury freezes solid at 
.
Strategy We will identify the whole number to the left of the decimal point, the
fractional part to its right, and the name of the place-value column of the digit the
farthest to the right.

write it in words.

The Language of Mathematics
Decimals are often read in an informal way.
For example, we can read 184.3 as “one hundred eighty-four point three” and
9.69 as “nine point six nine.”
The procedure for reading a decimal can be applied in reverse to convert from
written-word form to standard form.
Solution
a.
.
The whole-number part is 184. The fractional part is 3.
The digit the farthest to the right, 3, is in the tenths place.
One hundred eighty-four and three tenths
Written as a mixed number, 184.3 is 
b.
.
The whole-number part is 9. The fractional part is 69.
The digit the farthest to the right, 9, is in the hundredths place.
Nine and sixty-nine hundredths
Written as a mixed number, 9.69 is 
c.
.
The whole-number part is 0. The fractional part is 43.
The digit the farthest to the right, 4, is in the ten-thousandths place.
Forty-three ten-thousandths
Since the whole-number part is 0, we need not write it
nor the word and.
Written as a fraction, 0.0043 is

b. Eleven and ﬁfty-one thousandths
Strategy We will locate the word and in the written-word form and translate the
phrase that appears before it and the phrase that appears after it separately.
WHY The whole-number part of the decimal is described by the phrase that
appears before the word and. The fractional part of the decimal is described by the
phrase that follows the word and.
Solution
a.
172.43
This is the hundredths place-value column.
b. Sometimes, when changing from written-word form to standard form, we must
insert placeholder 0’s in the fractional part of a decimal so that that the last
digit appears in the proper place-value column.

Compare decimals using inequality symbols.
To develop a way to compare decimals, let’s consider 0.3 and 0.271. Since 0.271
contains more digits, it may appear that 0.271 is greater than 0.3. However, the
opposite is true.To show this, we write 0.3 and 0.271 in fraction form:
Now we build 
into an equivalent fraction so that it has a denominator of 1,000, like

0.271  271

0.3  3

Since 
it follows that

method for comparing decimals.

Comparing Decimals
To compare two decimals:
1.
Make sure both numbers have the same number of decimal places to the right
of the decimal point.Write any additional zeros necessary to achieve this.
2.
Compare the digits of each decimal, column by column, working from left
to right.
3.
If the decimals are positive: When two digits differ, the decimal with the
greater digit is the greater number. If the decimals are negative: When two
digits differ, the decimal with the smaller digit is the greater number.
EXAMPLE 5
Place an 
or 
symbol in the box to make a true statement:
a. 1.2679 
1.2658
b. 54.9 
54.929
c.
Strategy We will stack the decimals and then, working from left to right, we will
scan their place-value columns looking for a difference in their digits.
WHY We need only look in that column to determine which digit is the greater.
Solution
a. Since both decimals have the same number of places to the right of the
decimal point, we can immediately compare the digits, column by column.
1.26
9
1.26
8
Same digit
Same digit
Same digit
These digits are different: Since 7 is greater than 5, it 
follows that the ﬁrst decimal is greater than the second.
Thus, 1.2679 is greater than 1.2658 and we can write 
b. We can write two zeros after the 9 in 54.9 so that the decimals have the same
number of digits to the right of the decimal point.This makes the comparison
easier.
54.9
0
54.9
9
As we work from left to right, this is the ﬁrst column in which the digits differ.
Since 
it follows that 54.929 is greater than 54.9 (or 54.9 is less than
54.929) and we can write 54.9  54.929.

Success Tip
Writing additional zeros after the last digit to the right of the
decimal point does not change the value of the decimal. Also, deleting
additional zeros after the last digit to the right of the decimal point does not
change the value of the decimal. For example,
Because 
and

54 900

These additional zeros do not 
change the value of the decimal.

Round decimals.
When we don’t need exact results, we can approximate decimal numbers by rounding.
To round the decimal part of a decimal number, we use a method similar to that used
to round whole numbers.
Rounding a Decimal
1.
To round a decimal to a certain decimal place value, locate the rounding
digit in that place.
2.
Look at the test digit directly to the right of the rounding digit.
3.
If the test digit is 5 or greater, round up by adding 1 to the rounding 
digit and dropping all the digits to its right. If the test digit is less than 5,
round down by keeping the rounding digit and dropping all the digits to
its right.

weigh a compound in grams.Round the reading
shown on the balance to the nearest thousandth
of a gram.
Strategy We will identify the digit in the 
thousandths column and the digit in the ten-
thousandths column.
WHY To round to the nearest thousandth, the digit in the thousandths column is
the rounding digit and the digit in the ten-thousandths column is the test digit.
Solution The rounding digit in the thousandths column is 8. Since the test digit 7
is 5 or greater, we round up.
Rounding digit: thousandths column
Add 1 to 8.

WHY If the test digit is less than 5, we round down; if it is greater than or equal

Solution
a. Negative decimals are rounded in the same ways as positive decimals.The
rounding digit in the tenths column is 1. Since the test digit 3 is less than 5,
we round down.

There are many situations in our daily lives that call for rounding amounts of
money. For example, a grocery shopper might round the unit cost of an item to the
nearest cent or a taxpayer might round his or her income to the nearest dollar when
ﬁlling out an income tax return.
Chapter 4

EXAMPLE 9
a. Utility Bills
A utility company calculates a homeowner’s monthly electric
bill by multiplying the unit cost of $0.06421 by the number of kilowatt hours
used that month. Round the unit cost to the nearest cent.
b. Annual Income
A secretary earned $36,500.91 dollars in one year. Round
her income to the nearest dollar.
Strategy In part a, we will round the decimal to the nearest hundredth. In part b,
we will round the decimal to the ones column.
WHY Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, each cent is
of a dollar.To round to
the nearest cent is the same as rounding to the nearest hundredth of a dollar. To
round to the nearest dollar is the same as rounding to the ones place.
Solution
a. The rounding digit in the hundredths column is 6. Since the test digit 4 is less
than 5, we round down.
Rounding digit:
Keep the rounding digit:

Do not add 1.
$0.06421
$0.06421
Test digit: 4 is less than 5.
Drop the test digit and
all digits to the right.
Thus, $0.06421 rounded to the nearest cent is $0.06.
b. The rounding digit in the ones column is 0. Since the test digit 9 is 5 or greater,
we round up.
Rounding digit: ones column
Add 1 to 0.
$36,500.91
$36,500.91
Test digit: 9 is 5 or greater.
Drop the test digit and

hundredths are added to hundredths, tenths are added to tenths, ones are added to
ones, and so on. We write the decimal point in the sum so that it lines up with the
decimal points in the addends. For example, to ﬁnd 
we proceed
as follows:
Ones column

Sum of the hundredths digits: Think 1  3  5  9
Sum of the tenths digits: Think 2  2  4  8

The sum is 7.89.
In this example, each addend had two decimal places, tenths and hundredths. If
the number of decimal places in the addends are different, we can insert additional
zeros so that the number of decimal places match.

Adding Decimals
To add decimal numbers:
1.
Write the numbers in vertical form with the decimal points lined up.
2.
Add the numbers as you would add whole numbers, from right to left.
3.
Write the decimal point in the result from Step 2 directly below the
decimal points in the addends.
EXAMPLE 1
Add:
Strategy We will write the addition in vertical form so that the corresponding
place values and decimal points of the addends are lined up. Then we will add the
digits, column by column, working from right to left.
WHY We can only add digits with the same place value.
Solution To make the column additions easier, we will write two zeros after the 6
in the addend 5.6 and one zero after the 8 in the addend 16.78.Since whole numbers
have an “understood” decimal point immediately to the right of their ones digit, we
can write the addend 68 as 68.000 to help line up the columns.
Line up the decimal points.
Now we add, right to left, as we would whole numbers, writing the sum from each
column below the horizontal bar.
Insert two zeros after the 6.
Insert a decimal point and three zeros: 68  68.000.
Insert a zero after the 8.

Subtracting Decimals
To subtract decimal numbers:
1.
Write the numbers in vertical form with the decimal points lined up.
2.
Subtract the numbers as you would subtract whole numbers from right to left.
3.
Write the decimal point in the result from Step 2 directly below the 
decimal points in the minued and the subtrahend.
As with whole numbers, if the subtraction of the digits in any place-value
column requires that we subtract a larger digit from a smaller digit, we must
borrow or regroup.
EXAMPLE 2
Subtract:
Strategy As we prepare to subtract in each column, we will compare the digit in
the subtrahend (bottom number) to the digit directly above it in the minuend (top
number).
WHY If a digit in the subtrahend is greater than the digit directly above it in the
minuend, we must borrow (regroup) to subtract in that column.
Solution Since 7 in the tenths column of 138.7 is greater than 6 in the tenths
column of 279.6, we cannot immediately subtract in that column because 
is
not a whole number. To subtract in the tenths column, we must regroup by
borrowing as shown below.
Recall from Section 1.3 that subtraction can be checked by addition. If a
subtraction is done correctly, the sum of the difference and the subtrahend will
equal the minuend: Difference  subtrahend  minuend.
Check:
Since the sum of the difference and the subtrahend is the minuend, the subtraction
is correct.

EXAMPLE 3
Subtract 13.059 from 15.4.
Strategy We will translate the sentence to mathematical symbols and then
perform the subtraction. As we prepare to subtract in each column, we will
compare the digit in the subtrahend (bottom number) to the digit directly above it
in the minuend (top number).
WHY If a digit in the subtrahend is greater than the digit directly above it in the
minuend, we must borrow (regroup) to subtract in that column.
Solution Since 13.059 is the number to be subtracted, it is the subtrahend.
To ﬁnd the difference, we write the subtraction in vertical form. To help with the
column subtractions, we write two zeros to the right of 15.4 so that both numbers
have three decimal places.
Insert two zeros after the 4 so that the decimal places match.
Line up the decimal points.
Since 9 in the thousandths column of 13.059 is greater than 0 in the
thousandths column of 15.400, we cannot immediately subtract. It is not possible to
borrow from the digit 0 in the hundredths column of 15.400. We can, however,
borrow from the digit 4 in the tenths column of 15.400.
Now we complete the two-column borrowing process by borrowing from the 10 in
the hundredths column.Then we subtract, column-by-column, from the right to the
left to ﬁnd the difference.
9
When 13.059 is subtracted from 15.4, the difference is 2.341.
Check:
Since the sum of the difference and the subtrahend
is the minuend, the subtraction is correct.

Add and subtract signed decimals.
To add signed decimals, we use the same rules that we used for adding integers.
Adding Two Decimals That Have the Same (Like) Signs
1.
To add two positive decimals, add them as usual.The ﬁnal answer is 
positive.
2.
To add two negative decimals, add their absolute values and make the
ﬁnal answer negative.
Adding Two Decimals That Have Different (Unlike) Signs
To add a positive decimal and a negative decimal, subtract the smaller absolute
value from the larger.

If the positive decimal has the larger absolute value, the ﬁnal answer is
positive.
2.
If the negative decimal has the larger absolute value, make the ﬁnal

Estimate sums and differences of decimals.
Estimation can be used to check the reasonableness of an answer to a decimal addition
or subtraction.There are several ways to estimate, but the objective is the same: Simplify
the numbers in the problem so that the calculations can be made easily and quickly.
EXAMPLE 9
a. Estimate by rounding the addends to the nearest ten:
b. Estimate using front-end rounding:
Strategy We will use rounding to approximate each addend, minuend, and
subtrahend.Then we will ﬁnd the sum or difference of the approximations.

Multiplying Decimals
Since decimal numbers are base-ten numbers, multiplication of decimals is similar to
multiplication of whole numbers. However, when multiplying decimals, there is one
additional step—we must determine where to write the decimal point in the product.
1
Multiply decimals.
To develop a rule for multiplying decimals, we will consider the multiplication
and ﬁnd the product in a roundabout way. First, we write 0.3 and 0.17 as 
fractions and multiply them in that form. Then we express the resulting fraction as a
decimal.
Express the decimals 0.3 and 0.17 as fractions.
Write the resulting fraction 
as a decimal.
From this example, we can make observations about multiplying decimals.
• The digits in the answer are found by multiplying 3 and 17.
3  17  51
• The answer has 3 decimal places.The sum of the number of decimal places in
the factors 0.3 and 0.17 is also 3.

Multiplying Decimals
To multiply two decimals:
1.
Multiply the decimals as if they were whole numbers.
2.
Find the total number of decimal places in both factors.
3.
Insert a decimal point in the result from step 1 so that the answer has the
same number of decimal places as the total found in step 2.
EXAMPLE 1
Multiply:
Strategy We will ignore the decimal points and multiply 5.9 and 3.4 as if they

WHY Since the factor 5.9 has 1 decimal place, and the factor 3.4 has 1 decimal
place, the product should have

Success Tip
When multiplying decimals, we do not need to line up the
decimal points, as the next example illustrates.
EXAMPLE 2
Multiply:
1.3(0.005)
Strategy We will ignore the decimal points and multiply 1.3 and 0.005 as if they
were whole numbers. Then we will write a decimal point in that result so that the
ﬁnal answer has four decimal places.
WHY Since the factor 1.3 has 1 decimal place, and the factor 0.005 has 3 decimal
places, the product should have 
decimal places.
Solution Since many students ﬁnd vertical form multiplication of decimals easier
if the decimal with the smaller number of nonzero digits is written on the bottom,
we will write 0.005 under 1.3.
Write 2 placeholder zeros in front of 6. Then move 4 places from
the right to the left and insert a decimal point in the answer.
Thus,
.
1.3(0.005)  0.0065

Multiplying a Decimal by 10, 100, 1,000, and So On
To ﬁnd the product of a decimal and 10, 100, 1,000, and so on, move the decimal
point to the right the same number of places as there are zeros in the power of 10.

Multiply decimals by powers of 10.
The numbers 10,100,and 1,000 are called powers of 10, because they are the results when
we evaluate 101, 102, and 103. To develop a rule to ﬁnd the product when multiplying a
decimal by a power of 10, we multiply 8.675 by three different powers of 10.
Multiply: 8.675  10
Multiply: 8.675  100
Multiply: 8.675  1,000
When we inspect the answers, the decimal point in the ﬁrst factor 8.675 appears
to be moved to the right by the multiplication process.The number of decimal places
it moves depends on the power of 10 by which 8.675 is multiplied.

Estimate products of decimals.
Estimation can be used to check the reasonableness of an answer to a decimal
multiplication.There are several ways to estimate,but the objective is the same:Simplify
the numbers in the problem so that the calculations can be made easily and quickly.
EXAMPLE 11
a. Estimate using front-end rounding:
b. Estimate by rounding each factor to the nearest tenth:
c. Estimate by rounding:
Strategy We will use rounding to approximate the factors. Then we will ﬁnd the
product of the approximations.
WHY Rounding produces factors that contain fewer digits. Such numbers are 
easier to multiply.
Solution
a. To estimate 
by front-end rounding, we begin by rounding both factors
to their largest place value.
The estimate is 180. If we calculate 
, the product is exactly 173.07.The
estimate is close: It’s about 7 more than 173.07.
b. To estimate 
, we will round both decimals to the nearest tenth.
The estimate is 73.67. If we calculate 
, the product is exactly
73.3057.The estimate is close: It’s just slightly more than 73.3057.
c. Since 101.4 is approximately 100, we can estimate 
using
.
Since 100 has two zeros, move the decimal point in 
0.1245 two places to the right.

Divide a decimal by a whole number.
To develop a rule for decimal division, let’s consider the problem

changing an improper fraction to a mixed number to ﬁnd the answer:
Here the result is written in quotient 
form.
To perform this same division using decimals, we write 47 as 47.0 and divide as we
would divide whole numbers.
Since

WHY Writing additional zeros to the right of the 2 allows us to continue the

We can write a zero to the right of 2 in the dividend and continue the division

Divide a decimal by a decimal.

fraction form.

0.2592
0.36
0.360.2592
0.360.2592
Divisor
To be able to use the rule for dividing decimals by a whole number discussed earlier,
we need to move the decimal point in the divisor 0.36 two places to the right.This can
be accomplished by multiplying it by 100. However, if the denominator of the fraction
is multiplied by 100, the numerator must also be multiplied by 100 so that the fraction
maintains the same value.It follows that 
is the form of 1 that we should use to build

Division with a Decimal Divisor
To divide with a decimal divisor:
1.
Write the problem in long division form.
2.
Move the decimal point of the divisor so that it becomes a whole number.
3.
Move the decimal point of the dividend the same number of places to the

4.
Write the decimal point in the quotient (answer) directly above the
decimal point in the dividend. Divide as if working with whole numbers.
5.
If necessary, additional zeros can be written to the right of the last digit of
the dividend to continue the division.

Divide:
Strategy We will move the decimal point of the divisor, 0.36, two places to the

WHY We can then use the rule for dividing a decimal by a whole number.
Solution We begin by writing the problem in long division form.
Since the divisor is now a whole number, we can use the rule for dividing a decimal
by a whole number to ﬁnd the quotient.
Now divide as with whole numbers.

Success Tip
When dividing decimals, moving the decimal points the same
number of places to the right in both the divisor and the dividend does not
change the answer.

Round a decimal quotient.
In Example 4, the division process stopped after we obtained a 0 from the second
subtraction. Sometimes when we divide, the subtractions never give a zero remainder,
and the division process continues forever. In such cases, we can round the result.
EXAMPLE 5
Divide:
. Round the quotient to the nearest hundredth.
Strategy We will use the methods of this section to divide to the thousandths
column.
WHY To round to the hundredths column, we need to continue the division
process for one more decimal place, which is the thousandths column.
Solution We begin by writing the problem in long division form.
We need to write two zeros to the right of the last digit of the dividend so that we
can divide to the thousandths column.
After dividing to the thousandths column, we round to the hundredths column.
The rounding digit in the hundredths column is 5.
The test digit in the thousandths column is 7.
The division process can stop. We have divided to the thousandths column.
Since the test digit 7 is 5 or greater, we will round 13.357 up to approximate the
quotient to the nearest hundredth.
Read  as “is approximately equal to.”

decimal point to the left the same number of places as there are zeros in the
power of 10.
Dividing a Decimal by  0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and So On
To ﬁnd the quotient of a decimal and 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and so on, move the
decimal point to the right the same number of decimal places as there are in
the power of 10.

Strategy We will identify the divisor in each division. If it is a power of 10 greater
than 1, we will count the number of zeros that it has. If it is a power of 10 less than
1, we will count the number of decimal places that it has.
WHY Then we will know how many places to the right or left to move the decimal
point in the dividend to ﬁnd the quotient.
Solution
a.
Since the divisor 10 has one zero, move the decimal point one
place to the left.
b.
Since the divisor 10,000 has four zeros, move the decimal
point four places to the left. Write three placeholder zeros

WHY In part a, the divisor is positive and the dividend is negative. In part b, both
the dividend and divisor are negative.
Solution
a. First, we ﬁnd the absolute values:
and
.
Then we divide the absolute values, 104.483 by 16.3, using the methods of 
this section.
Since the signs of the original dividend and divisor are unlike, we make the
ﬁnal answer negative.Thus,
Check the result using multiplication.
b. We can use the rule for dividing a decimal by a power of 10 to ﬁnd the 
quotient.
Since the divisor 0.1 has one decimal place, move the decimal
point in 38.677 one place to the right. Since the dividend and
divisor have like signs, the quotient is positive.

“In considering all of the factors that are important to employers as they recruit
students in colleges and universities nationwide,college major,grade point
average,and work-related experience usually rise to the top of the list.”
Mary D.Feduccia,Ph.D.,Career Services Director,Louisiana State University
A grade point average (GPA) is a weighted average based on the grades
received and the number of units (credit hours) taken.A GPA for one
semester (or term) is deﬁned as
the quotient of the sum of the grade points earned for each class and
the sum of the number of units taken.The number of grade points
earned for a class is the product of the number of units assigned to the
class and the value of the grade received in the class.

In this section, we continue to explore the relationship between fractions and decimals.
1
Write fractions as equivalent terminating decimals.
A fraction and a decimal are said to be equivalent if they name the same number.
Every fraction can be written in an equivalent decimal form by dividing the numerator
by the denominator, as indicated by the fraction bar.
Writing a Fraction as a Decimal
To write a fraction as a decimal, divide the numerator of the fraction by its
denominator.
EXAMPLE 1
Write each fraction as a decimal.
a.
b.
c.
Strategy We will divide the numerator of each fraction by its denominator. We
will continue the division process until we obtain a zero remainder.
WHY We divide the numerator by the denominator because a fraction bar
indicates division.
Solution
a.
means 
.To ﬁnd 
, we begin by writing it in long division form as 
.To proceed with the division, we must write the dividend 3 with a decimal
point and some additional zeros.Then we use the procedure from Section 4.4
for dividing a decimal by a whole number.
Thus,
.We say that the decimal equivalent of
is 0.75.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

In parts a, b, and c of Example 1, the division process ended because a remainder
of 0 was obtained. When such a division terminates with a remainder of 0, we call the
resulting decimal a terminating decimal. Thus, 0.75, 0.625, and 3.5 are three examples
of terminating decimals.

The Language of Mathematics
To terminate means to bring to an end. In the
movie The Terminator, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a heartless
machine sent to Earth to bring an end to his enemies.
2
Write fractions as equivalent repeating decimals.
Sometimes, when we are ﬁnding a decimal equivalent of a fraction, the division
process never gives a remainder of 0. In this case, the result is a repeating decimal.
Examples of repeating decimals are 0.4444 . . . and 1.373737 . . . .The three dots tell us
Caution!
A common error when ﬁnding a decimal equivalent
for a fraction is to incorrectly divide the denominator by the
numerator. An example of this is shown on the right, where the
decimal equivalent of
(a number less than 1) is incorrectly
found to be 1.6 (a number greater than 1).

Some fractions can be written as decimals using an alternate approach. If the
denominator of a fraction in simpliﬁed form has factors of only 2’s or 5’s, or a
combination of both, it can be written as a decimal by multiplying it by a form of 1.
The objective is to write the fraction in an equivalent form with a denominator that is
a power of 10, such as 10, 100, 1,000, and so on.

The repeating part of the decimal equivalent of some fractions is quite long. Here are
some examples:
A block of three digits repeats.
A block of four digits repeats.
A block of six digits repeats.
Every fraction can be written as either a terminating decimal or a repeating 
decimal. For this reason, the set of fractions (rational numbers) form a subset of the
set of decimals called the set of real numbers. The set of real numbers corresponds to
all points on a number line.
Not all decimals are terminating or repeating decimals. For example,
does not terminate, and it has no repeating block of digits. This decimal cannot be
written as a fraction with an integer numerator and a nonzero integer denominator.
Thus, it is not a rational number. It is an example from the set of irrational numbers.

First, we set the calculator to round to the third decimal place (thousandths)
by pressing

Thus,
.To round to the nearest tenth, we would ﬁx 1; to round to the
nearest hundredth, we would ﬁx 2; and so on.After using the FIX feature,
don’t forget to remove it and return the calculator to the normal mode.
Graphing calculators can also round to a given decimal place. See the owner’s

Evaluate expressions containing fractions and decimals.
Expressions can contain both fractions and decimals. In the following examples, we
show two methods that can be used to evaluate expressions of this type.With the ﬁrst
method we ﬁnd the answer by working in terms of fractions.
EXAMPLE 10
Evaluate 
by working in terms of fractions.
Strategy We will begin by writing 0.27 as a fraction.
WHY Then we can use the methods of Chapter 3 for adding fractions with unlike
denominators to ﬁnd the sum.
Solution To write 0.27 as a fraction, it is helpful to read it aloud as “twenty-seven
hundredths.”
Replace 0.27 with 
.
The LCD for and 
is 300. To build each 
fraction so that its denominator is 300, 
multiply by a form of 1.
Multiply the numerators. 
Multiply the denominators.
Add the numerators and write the sum over 
the common denominator 300.

We have discussed the relationships between addition and subtraction and between
multiplication and division. In this section, we explore the relationship between
raising a number to a power and ﬁnding a root.Decimals play an important role in this
discussion.
1
Find the square root of a perfect square.
When we raise a number to the second power, we are squaring it, or ﬁnding its square.
The square of 6 is 36, because 
.
The square of 
is 36, because 
.
The square root of a given number is a number whose square is the given number. For
example, the square roots of 36 are 6 and 
, because either number, when squared,
is 36.
Every positive number has two square roots. The number 0 has only one square
root. In fact, it is its own square root, because 
.

Find the two square roots 
of 64.
Now Try Problem 21
In Example 1, we saw that 49 has two square roots—one positive and one
negative.The symbol 
is called a radical symbol and is used to indicate a positive
square root of a nonnegative number.When reading this symbol, we usually drop the
word positive and simply say square root. Since 7 is the positive square root of 49, we
can write
represents the positive number whose square is 49. 
Read as “the square root of 49 is 7.”
When a number, called the radicand, is written under a radical symbol, we have a
radical expression.

The symbol 
is used to indicate the negative square root of a positive
number. It is the opposite of the positive square root. Since –6 is the negative square
root of 36, we can write
Read as “the negative square root of 36 is 6” or “the opposite of the
square root of 36 is 6.”

Numbers, such as 36 and 49, that are squares of whole numbers, are called perfect
squares. To evaluate square root radical expressions, it is helpful to be able to identify
perfect square radicands. You need to memorize the following list of perfect squares,

We have found that 
. To check this result, we need to square 27.
This can be done by entering 27 and pressing the 
key. We obtain 729.Thus,
27 is the square root of 729.
Some calculator models require keystrokes of

Evaluate expressions that contain square roots.
In Chapters 1, 2, and 3, we used the order of operations rule to evaluate expressions
that involve more than one operation. If an expression contains any square roots, they
are to be evaluated at the same stage in your solution as exponential expressions. (See
step 2 in the familiar order of operations rule on the next page.)

Approximate square roots.
In Examples 2–7, we have found square roots of perfect squares. If a number is not a
perfect square, we can use the  
key on a calculator or a table of square roots to
ﬁnd its approximate square root. For example, to ﬁnd 
using a scientiﬁc calculator,
we enter 17 and press the square root key:
The display reads
4.123105626
This result is an approximation, because the exact value of 
is a nonterminating
decimal that never repeats. If we round to the nearest thousandth, we have
Read  as “is approximately equal to.”
To check this approximation, we square 4.123.

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
S E C T I O N  4.1
An Introduction to Decimals
The place-value system for whole numbers can 
be extended to create the decimal numeration 
system.
The place-value columns to the left of the decimal
point form the whole-number part of the decimal
number. The value of each of those columns is 10
times greater than the column directly to its right.
The columns to the right of the decimal point form
the fractional part. Each of those columns has a
value that is 
of the value of the place directly to
its left.

To write a decimal number in expanded form
(expanded notation) means to write it as an
addition of the place values of each of its digits.
Write 28. 9341 in expanded notation:

DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS
EXAMPLES
The place value of the digit 3 is 3 hundredths.
The digit that tells the number of ten-thousandths is 1.
To read a decimal:
1. Look to the left of the decimal point and say
the name of the whole number.
2. The decimal point is read as “and.”
3. Say the fractional part of the decimal as a
whole number followed by the name of the last
place-value column of the digit that is the
farthest to the right.
We can use the steps for reading a decimal to write
it in words.
Write the decimal in words and then as a fraction or mixed number:
28.9341
The whole-number part is 28. The fractional part is 9341.
The digit the farthest to the right, 1, is in the ten-
thousandths place.
Twenty-eight and nine thousand three hundred forty-one 
ten-thousandths
Written as a mixed number, 28.9341 is 
.
Write the decimal in words and then as a fraction or mixed number:
0.079
The whole-number part is 0. The fractional part is 79. The
digit the farthest to the right, 9, is in the thousandths place.
Seventy-nine thousandths
Written as a fraction, 0.079 is 
.
79

The procedure for reading a decimal can be applied
in reverse to convert from written-word form to
standard form.
Write the decimal number in standard form:
Negative twelve  and  sixty-ﬁve ten-thousandths
This is the ten-thousandths place-value column.
Two place holder 0’s must be inserted here so
that the last digit in 65 is in the ten-
thousandths column.

Decimals
To compare two decimals:
1. Make sure both numbers have the same
number of decimal places to the right of the
decimal point. Write any additional zeros
necessary to achieve this.
2. Compare the digits of each decimal, column by
column, working from left to right.
3. If the decimals are positive: When two digits
differ, the decimal with the greater digit is the
greater number.
If the decimals are negative: When two digits
differ, the decimal with the smaller digit is the
greater number.
Compare 47.31572 and 47.31569.
47.315 7 2
47.315 6 9
As we work from left to right, this is the ﬁrst column in
which the digits differ. Since 7  6, it follows that
47.31572 is greater than 47.31569.
Thus,

Compare 
and

6.41 8
These decimals are negative.
6.41 0
Write a zero after 1 to help in the comparison.
As we work from left to right, this is the ﬁrst column in
which the digits differ. Since 0  8, it follows that 6.410
is greater than 6.418.

1. To round a decimal to a certain decimal place
value, locate the rounding digit in that place.
2. Look at the test digit directly to the right of the
rounding digit.
3. If the test digit is 5 or greater, round up by
adding 1 to the rounding digit and dropping all
the digits to its right. If the test digit is less than
5, round down by keeping the rounding digit
and dropping all the digits to its right.

are used for adding integers.
With like signs: Add their absolute values and
attach their common sign to the sum.
With unlike signs: Subtract their absolute values
(the smaller from the larger). If the positive
decimal has the larger absolute value, the ﬁnal
answer is positive. If the negative decimal has the
larger absolute value, make the ﬁnal answer
negative.

To multiply two decimals:
1. Multiply the decimals as if they were whole
numbers.
2. Find the total number of decimal places in both
factors.
3. Insert a decimal point in the result from step 1
so that the answer has the same number of

To estimate quotients, we use a method that
approximates both the dividend and the divisor so
that they divide easily. There is one rule of thumb
for this method: If possible, round both numbers
up or both numbers down.
Estimate the quotient:
To divide, drop one zero from
320 and one zero from 20,
and then ﬁnd 32 2.

Fractions and Decimals
A fraction and a decimal are said to be equivalent
if they name the same number.
To write a fraction as a decimal, divide the
numerator of the fraction by its denominator.
Sometimes, when ﬁnding the decimal equivalent
of a fraction, the division process ends because a
remainder of 0 is obtained. We call the resulting
decimal a terminating decimal.

If the denominator of a fraction in simpliﬁed form
has factors of only 2’s or 5’s, or a combination of
both, it can be written as a decimal by multiplying
it by a form of 1. The objective is to write the
fraction in an equivalent form with a denominator
that is a power of 10, such as 10, 100, 1,000, and so
on.

Ratios are often used to describe important relationships between two quantities.
Here are three examples:
Write ratios as fractions.
Ratios give us a way to compare two numbers or two quantities measured in the same
units.
Ratios
A ratio is the quotient of two numbers or the quotient of two quantities that
have the same units.
There are three ways to write a ratio.The most comon way is as a fraction. Ratios
can also be written as two numbers separated by the word to, or as two numbers
separated by a colon. For example, the ratios described in the illustrations above can
be expressed as:
• The fraction 
is read as “the ratio of 50 to 1.”
• 14 to 10 is read as “the ratio of 14 to 10.”
• 23 is read as “the ratio of 2 to 3.”
Writing a Ratio as a Fraction
To write a ratio as a fraction, write the ﬁrst number (or quantity) mentioned as
the numerator and the second number (or quantity) mentioned as the
denominator.Then simplify the fraction, if possible.
A colon separates the numbers
being compared.
The word “to” separates the
numbers being compared.
A fraction bar separates the
numbers being compared.

Caution!
When a ratio is written as a fraction, the fraction should be in
simplest form. (Recall from Chapter 3 that a fraction is in simplest form, or
lowest terms, when the numerator and denominator have no common factors
other than 1.)

EXAMPLE 2
Write the ratio 35 to 10 as a fraction in simplest form.
Strategy We will translate the ratio from its given form in words to fractional
form.Then we will look for any factors common to the numerator and denominator
and remove them.
WHY We need to make sure that the numerator and denominator have no
common factors other than 1. If that is the case, the ratio will be in simplest form.
Solution
The ratio 35 to 10 can be written as 
.
The fraction 
is not in simplest form.
Now, we simplify the fraction using the method discussed in Section 3.1.
The ratio 35 to 10 can be written as the fraction 
, which simpliﬁes to (read as 
“7 to 2”). Because the fractions 
and represent equal numbers, they are called
equal ratios.

Caution!
Since ratios are comparisons of two numbers, it would be incorrect
in Example 2 to write the ratio as the mixed number 
. Ratios written as
improper fractions are perfectly acceptable—just make sure the numerator
and denominator have no common factors other than 1.
To write a ratio in simplest form, we remove any common factors of the
numerator and denominator as well as any common units.

Write the ratio 0.3 to 1.2 as a fraction in simplest form.
Strategy After writing the ratio as a fraction, we will multiply it by a form of 1 to
obtain an equivalent ratio of whole numbers.
WHY A ratio of whole numbers is easier to understand than a ratio of decimals.
Solution
The ratio 0.3 to 1.2 can be written as 
.
To write this as a ratio of whole numbers, we need to move the decimal points in
the numerator and denominator one place to the right. Recall that to ﬁnd the
product of a decimal and 10, we simply move the decimal point one place to the
right.Therefore,it follows that 
is the form of 1 that we should use to build 
into
an equivalent ratio.

Convert units to write ratios.
When a ratio compares two quantities, both quantities must be measured in the same
units. For example, inches must be compared to inches, pounds to pounds, and seconds
to seconds.

EXAMPLE 6
Write the ratio 12 ounces to 2 pounds as a fraction in simplest
form.
Strategy We will convert 2 pounds to ounces and write a ratio that compares
ounces to ounces.Then we will simplify the ratio.
WHY A ratio compares two quantities that have the same units. When the units
are different, it’s usually easier to write the ratio using the smaller unit of
measurement. Since ounces are smaller than pounds, we will compare in ounces.

Write rates as fractions.
When we compare two quantities that have different
units (and neither unit can be converted to the other),we
call the comparison a rate, and we can write it as a
fraction. For example, on the label of the can of paint
shown on the right,we see that 1 quart of paint is needed
for every 200 square feet to be painted.Writing this as a
rate in fractional form, we have
The Language of Mathematics
The word per is associated with the
operation of division, and it means “for each” or “for every.” For example,
when we say 1 quart of paint per 200 square feet, we mean 1 quart of paint for
every 200 square feet.
Rates
A rate is a quotient of two quantities that have different units.
When writing a rate, always include the units. Some other examples of rates are:
• 16 computers for 75 students
• 1,550 feet in 4.5 seconds
• 88 tomatoes from 3 plants
• 250 miles on 2 gallons of gasoline
The Language of Mathematics
As seen above, words such as per, for, in,
from, and on are used to separate the two quantities that are compared in a
rate.
Read as “1 quart per 
200 square feet.”

Find the best buy based on unit price.
If a grocery store sells a 5-pound package of hamburger for $18.75, a consumer might
want to know what the hamburger costs per pound.When we ﬁnd the cost of 1 pound
of the hamburger,we are ﬁnding a unit price.To ﬁnd the unit price of an item,we begin

Then we divide the price by the number of units.
The unit price of the hamburger is $3.75 per pound.

Olives come packaged in a 10-ounce jar, which
sells for $2.49, or in a 6-ounce jar, which sells for
$1.53.Which is the better buy?
Strategy We will ﬁnd the unit price for each jar
of olives. Then we will identify which jar has the
lower unit price.
WHY The better buy is the jar of olives that has the lower unit price.
Solution
To ﬁnd the unit price of each jar of olives, we write the quotient of its price and its
weight, and then perform the indicated division. Before dividing, we convert each
price from dollars to cents so that the unit price can be expressed in cents per
ounce.
The 10-ounce jar:

One of the most useful concepts in mathematics is the equation. An equation is a
statement indicating that two expressions are equal. All equations contain an =
symbol. Some examples of equations are:
4  4  8,
15.6  4.3  11.3,
,
and
Each of the equations shown above is true. Equations can also be false. For example,

In this section, we will work with equations that state that two ratios (or rates) are
equal.
Write proportions.
Like any tool, a ladder can be dangerous if used improperly. When setting up an
extension ladder, users should follow the 4-to-1 rule: For every 4 feet of ladder 
height, position the legs of the ladder 1 foot away from the base of the wall. The 
4-to-1 rule for ladders can be expressed using a ratio.
Remove the common units of feet.
The ﬁgure on the right shows how the 4-to-1 rule
was used to properly position the legs of a ladder 3 feet
from the base of a 12-foot-high wall. We can write a
ratio comparing the ladder’s height to its distance from
the wall.
Since this ratio satisﬁes the 4-to-1 rule, the two ratios 
and 
must be equal.
Therefore, we have
Equations like this, which show that two ratios are equal, are called proportions.

Determine whether proportions are true or false.
Since a proportion is an equation, a proportion can be true or false. A proportion is
true if its ratios (or rates) are equal and false if it its ratios (or rates) are not equal.
One way to determine whether a proportion is true is to use the fraction simplifying
skills of Chapter 3.

Write each statement as a proportion.
a. 22 is to 6 as 11 is to 3.
b. 1,000 administrators is to 8,000 teachers as 1 administrator is to 8 teachers.
Strategy We will locate the word as in each statement and identify the ratios (or
rates) before and after it.
WHY The word as translates to the = symbol that is needed to write the statement
as a proportion (equation).
Solution
a. This proportion states that two ratios are equal.

b. This proportion states that two rates are equal.
1,000 administrators is to 8,000 teachers as 1 administrator is to 8 teachers

There is another way to determine whether a proportion is true or false. Before
we can discuss it, we need to introduce some more vocabulary of proportions.
Each of the four numbers in a proportion is called a term. The ﬁrst and fourth
terms are called the extremes, and the second and third terms are called the means.
In the proportion shown above, the product of the extremes is equal to the product
of the means.
These products can be found by multiplying diagonally in the proportion.We call
and 
cross products.
Cross products
Note that the cross products are equal. This example illustrates the following
property of proportions.
Cross-Products Property (Means-Extremes Property)
To determine whether a proportion is true or false, ﬁrst multiply along one
diagonal, and then multiply along the other diagonal.
• If the cross products are equal, the proportion is true.
• If the cross products are not equal, the proportion is false.
(If the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means, the
proportion is true. If the product of the extremes is not equal to the product of
the means, the proportion is false.)

Solve a proportion to ﬁnd an unknown term.
Suppose that we know three of the four terms in the following proportion.
In mathematics, we often let a letter represent an unknown number. We call such a
letter a variable. To ﬁnd the unknown term, we let the variable x represent it in the
proportion and we can write:
If the proportion is to be true, the cross products must be equal.
Find the cross products for 
and set them equal.
To simplify the right side of the equation, do the 
multiplication: 
.
On the left side of the equation, the unknown number x is multiplied by 20. To
undo the multiplication by 20 and isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20.
We can simplify the fraction on the left side of the equation by removing the
common factor of 20 from the numerator and denominator. On the right side, we
perform the division indicated by the fraction bar.
Since the product of any number and 1 is that number, it follows that the
numerator 
on the left side can be replaced by x.
Since the quotient of any number and 1 is that number, it follows that on the left

Since the cross products are equal, the result, 6, checks.
In the previous example, when we ﬁnd the value of the variable x that makes the
given proportion true, we say that we have solved the proportion to ﬁnd the unknown
term.
The Language of Mathematics
We solve proportions by writing a series of
steps that result in an equation of the form x  a number or a number  x.We
say that the variable x is isolated on one side of the equation. Isolated means
alone or by itself.
Solving a Proportion to Find an Unknown Term
1.
Set the cross products equal to each other to form an equation.
2.
Isolate the variable on one side of the equation by dividing both sides by the
number that is multiplied by that variable.
3.
Check by substituting the result into the original proportion and ﬁnding the
cross products.

Write proportions to solve application problems.
Proportions can be used to solve application problems from a wide variety of ﬁelds
such as medicine, accounting, construction, and business. It is easy to spot problems
that can be solved using a proportion.You will be given a ratio (or rate) and asked to
ﬁnd the missing part of another ratio (or rate). It is helpful to follow the ﬁve-step
problem-solving strategy seen earlier in the text to solve proportion problems.

If 5 apples cost $1.15, ﬁnd the cost of 16 apples.
Analyze
• We can express the fact that 5 apples cost $1.15 using the rate:
.
• What is the cost of 16 apples?
Form We will let the variable c represent the unknown cost of 16 apples. If we
compare the number of apples to their cost, we know that the two rates must be
equal and we can write a proportion.
5 apples is to $1.15 
16 apples is to $c.
Solve To ﬁnd the cost of 16 apples, we solve the proportion for c.
Set the cross products equal to 
each other to form an equation.
To simplify the right side of the equation, 
multiply: 1.15(16)  18.4.
To simplify the left side, remove the common factor of 5. 
On the right side, do the division: 18.4  5  3.68.

tower in the model is 9 inches
high. How tall is the actual

Now Try Problem 83
In Example 9, we could have compared the cost of the apples to the number of
apples:
$1.15 is to 5 apples as $c is to 16 apples.This would have led to the proportion
If we solve this proportion for c, we obtain the same result: 3.68.
Caution! When solving problems using proportions, make sure that the units

Scale Drawings
A scale is a ratio (or rate) that compares
the size of a model, drawing, or map to the size of an actual object. The airplane
shown below is drawn using a scale of 1 inch: 6 feet. This means that 1 inch on the
drawing is actually 6 feet on the plane. The distance from wing tip to wing tip (the
wingspan) on the drawing is 4.5 inches. What is the actual wingspan of the plane?
Analyze
• The airplane is drawn using a scale of 1 inch: 6 feet, which can be written
as a rate in fraction form as:
.
• The wingspan of the airplane on the drawing is 4.5 inches.
• What is the actual wingspan of the plane?
Form We will let w represent the unknown actual wingspan of the plane. If we
compare the measurements on the drawing to their actual measurement of the plane,
we know that those two rates must be equal and we can write a proportion.

Explain the meaning of percent.
A percent tells us the number of parts per one hundred.You can think of a percent as
the numerator of a fraction (or ratio) that has a denominator of 100.
Percent
Percent means parts per one hundred.
The Language of Mathematics
The word percent is formed from the preﬁx
per, which means ratio, and the sufﬁx cent, which comes from the Latin word
centum, meaning 100.

ﬁgure is not shaded by subtracting the percent of the ﬁgure that is shaded from 100%.
So 7% of the ﬁgure is not shaded.
To illustrate a percent greater than 100%, say 121%, we would shade one entire
ﬁgure and 21 of the 100 square regions in a second, equal-sized grid.

Tossing a Coin
A coin was tossed 100 times and it landed
heads up 51 times.
a. What percent of the time did the coin land heads up?
b. What percent of the time did it land tails up?
Strategy We will write a fraction that compares the number of times that the coin
landed heads up (or tails up) to the total number of tosses.
WHY Since the denominator in each case will be 100, the numerator of the
fraction will give the percent.
Solution
a. If a coin landed heads up 51 times after being tossed 100 times, then
of the time it landed heads up.
b. The number of times the coin landed tails up is 
times. If a coin
landed tails up 49 times after being tossed 100 times, then
of the time it landed tails up.

Unions
In 2007, 12.1% of the U.S. labor force belonged to
a union.Write this percent as a fraction in simplest form. (Source: Bureau of Labor
Statistics)
Strategy We will drop the % symbol and write the given number over 100.Then
we will multiply the resulting fraction by a form of 1 and simplify, if possible.
WHY When writing a percent as a fraction,the numerator and denominator of the
fraction should be whole numbers that have no common factors (other than 1).
Solution
Drop the % symbol and write 12.1 over 100.
To write this as an equivalent fraction of whole numbers, we need to move the
decimal point in the numerator one place to the right.(Recall that to ﬁnd the product
of a decimal and 10, we simply move the decimal point one place to the right.)
Therefore, it follows that 
is the form of 1 that we should use to build 
.
Multiply the fraction by a form of 1.

Write percents as decimals.
To write a percent as a decimal, recall that a percent can be written as a fraction with
denominator 100 and that a denominator of 100 indicates division by 100.
For example, consider 14%, which means 14 parts per 100.
Use the deﬁnition of percent: write 14 over 100.
The fraction bar indicates division.
Write the whole number 14 in decimal notation by placing a decimal
point immediately to its right and entering a zero to the right of
the decimal point.
Since the divisor 100 has two zeros, move the decimal point 2
places to the left.
Write a zero to the left of the decimal point.

places to the left. To write a decimal as a percent, we do the opposite: we move the
decimal point 2 places to the right and insert a % symbol.
Writing Decimals as Percents
To write a decimal as a percent, multiply the decimal by 100 by moving the
decimal point 2 places to the right, and then insert a % symbol.

Geography
Land areas make up 0.291 of Earth’s surface.
Write this decimal as a percent.
Strategy We will multiply the decimal by 100 by moving the decimal point 2
places to the right, and then insert a % symbol.
WHY To write a decimal as a percent, we reverse the steps used to write a percent
as a decimal.
Solution
Multiply 0.291 by 100 by moving the decimal point 2 
places to the right, and then insert a % symbol.
0.291, written as a percent, is 29.1%

The highest-rated television show of all time
was a special episode of M*A*S*H that aired February 28, 1983. Surveys found 
that three out of every ﬁve American households watched this show. Express the
rating as a percent.
Strategy First, we will translate the phrase three out of every ﬁve to fraction 
form and write that fraction as a decimal. Then we will write that decimal as a
percent.

WHY A fraction-to-decimal-to-percent approach must be used to write a fraction
as a percent.
Solution
Step 1 The phrase three out of every ﬁve can be expressed as . To write this
fraction as a decimal, we divide the numerator, 3, by the denominator, 5.
The result is a terminating decimal.
Step 2 To write 0.6 as a percent, we proceed as follows.
Write a placeholder 0 to the right of the 6 (shown in blue). Multiply
0.60 by 100 by moving the decimal point 2 places to the right, and
then insert a % symbol.

WHY A fraction-to-decimal-to-percent approach must be used to write a fraction
as a percent.
Solution
Step 1 To write

We must now decide whether we want an exact answer or an approximation. For an
exact answer, we can represent the repeating part of the decimal using an equivalent
fraction. For an approximation, we can round 83.333 . . .% to a speciﬁc place value.

Type 2 In the article on drinking water, if we
want to know what percent of the wells are
safe, we would ask:
Type 3 In the article on new appointees, if we
want to know how many members are on the
State Board of Examiners, we would ask:
This section introduces two methods that can be used to solve the percent
problems shown above. The ﬁrst method involves writing and solving percent

Translate percent sentences to percent equations.
The percent sentences highlighted in blue in the introduction above have three things
in common.
• Each contains the word is. Here, is can be translated as an  symbol.
• Each contains the word of. In this case, of means multiply.
• Each contains a phrase such as what number or what percent. In other words,
there is an unknown number that can be represented by a variable.
These observations suggest that each percent sentence contains key words that
can be translated to form an equation. The equation, called a percent equation, will
contain three numbers (two known and one unknown represented by a variable), the
operation of multiplication, and, of course, an  symbol.
The Language of Mathematics
The key words in a percent sentence
translate as follows:
• is translates to an equal symbol  .
• of translates to multiplication that is shown with a raised dot 
• what number or what percent translates to an unknown number that is
represented by a variable.

Percent sentences involve a comparison of numbers. In the statement “420 is 84%
of 500,” the number 420 is called the amount, 84% is the percent, and 500 is called the
base. Think of the base as the standard of comparison—it represents the whole of
some quantity. The amount is a part of the base, but it can exceed the base when the
percent is more than 100%.The percent, of course, has the % symbol.

Caution!
When solving percent equations, always write the percent as a
decimal (or a fraction) before performing any calculations. In Example 2, we
wrote 84% as 0.84 before multiplying by 500.
Percent Equation (Formula)
Any percent sentence can be translated to a percent equation that has the
form:

We solve percent equations by writing 
a series of steps that result in an equation of the form x  a number or 
a number  x. We say that the variable x is isolated on one side of the
equation. Isolated means alone or by itself.

38 is the amount, x is the percent, and
40 is the base.
This is the equation to solve.
On the right side of the equation, the unknown number x is multiplied by 40. To
undo the multiplication by 40 and isolate x, we divide both sides by 40.
We can simplify the fraction on the right side of the equation by removing the
common factor of 40 from the numerator and denominator. On the left side, we
perform the division indicated by the fraction bar.
To simplify the left side, divide 38 by 40.
Since we want to ﬁnd the percent, we need to write the decimal 0.95 as a percent.
To write 0.95 as a percent, multiply it by 100 by moving the decimal point
two places to the right, and then insert a % symbol.
We have found that 38 is 95% of 40. That is, 95% of the wells mentioned in the

Strategy A percent proportion has the form 
. Since one of the
terms of the percent proportion is always 100, we only need to identify three terms
to write the proportion.We will begin by identifying the percent and the base in the
given sentence.
WHY The remaining number (or unknown) must be the amount.

Read circle graphs.
Percents are used with circle graphs, or pie charts, as a way of presenting data for
comparison. In the ﬁgure below, the entire circle represents the total amount of
electricity generated in the United States in 2008.The pie-shaped pieces of the graph
show the relative sizes of the energy sources
used to generate the electricity.For example,
we see that the greatest amount of electricity
(50%) was generated from coal. Note that if
we add the percents from all categories
(50%  3%  7%  18%  20%  2%),the
sum is 100%.
The 100 tick marks equally spaced
around the circle serve as a visual aid when
constructing a circle graph. For example, to
represent hydropower as 7%, a line was
drawn from the center of the circle to a tick
mark. Then we counted off 7 ticks and drew
a second line from the center to that tick to
complete the pie-shaped wedge.

Applications of Percent
In this section, we discuss applications of percent.Three of them (taxes, commissions,
and discounts) are directly related to purchasing. A solid understanding of these
concepts will make you a better shopper and consumer. The fourth uses percent to
describe increases or decreases of such things as population and unemployment.
Objectives
1
Calculate sales taxes,total cost,
and tax rates.
2
Calculate commissions and
commission rates.
3
Find the percent of increase or
decrease.
4
Calculate the amount of
discount,the sale price and the
discount rate.
1
Calculate sales taxes,total cost,and tax rates.
The department store sales receipt shown below gives a detailed account of what
items were purchased, how many of each were purchased, and the price of each
item.
The receipt shows that the $56.35 purchase price (labeled subtotal) was taxed at
a rate of 5%. Sales tax of $2.82 was charged.
This example illustrates the following sales tax formula. Notice that the formula
is based on the percent equation discussed in Section 5.4.

the sales tax rate is 7.2%.
Strategy First, we will ﬁnd the sales tax on the
child’s car seat.
WHY Then we can add the purchase price and
the sales tax to ﬁnd the total of the car seat.
Solution The sales tax rate is 7.2% and the
purchase price is $249.50.
This is the sales tax formula.
Substitute 7.2% for the sales tax rate
and $249.50 for the purchase price.

From the table, we see that the number of television channels received increased
considerably from 2000 to 2007. To describe this increase using a percent, we ﬁrst
subtract to ﬁnd the amount of increase.
Subtract the number of TV channels received in 2000 
from the number received in 2007.
Thus, the number of channels received increased by 58 from 2000 to 2007.
Next, we ﬁnd what percent of the original 61 channels received in 2000 that the 58
channel increase represents. To do this, we translate the problem into a percent
equation (or percent proportion) and solve it.

If we know the original price and the sale price of an item, we can use the
following formula to ﬁnd the amount of discount.

Calculate the amount of discount,
the sale price,and the discount rate.
While shopping, you have probably noticed that many stores display signs advertising
sales. Store managers have found that offering discounts attracts more customers. To
be a smart shopper, it is important to know the vocabulary of discount sales.
The difference between the original price and the sale price of an item is called
the amount of discount, or simply the discount. If the discount is expressed as a
percent of the selling price, it is called the discount rate.

EXAMPLE 8
Shoe Sales
Use the information in the advertisement
shown on the previous page to ﬁnd the amount of the discount on the pair of men’s
basketball shoes.Then ﬁnd the sale price.
Strategy We will identify the discount rate and the original price of the shoes and
use a formula to ﬁnd the amount of the discount.
WHY Then we can subtract the discount from the original price to ﬁnd the sale
price of the shoes.
Solution From the advertisement, we see that the discount rate on the men’s
shoes is 25% and the original price is $89.80.
This is the amount of
discount formula.
Substitute 25% for the
discount rate and $89.80 for
the original price.
Write 25% as a decimal: 
25%  0.25.
Do the multiplication.
The discount on the men’s shoes is $22.45.To ﬁnd the sale price,we use subtraction.
This is the sale price formula.
Substitute $89.80 for the 
original price and $22.45 for 
the discount.
Do the subtraction.
The sale price of the men’s basketball shoes is $67.35.

Discounts
Find the discount rate on the ladies’ cross trainer
shoes shown in the advertisement on the previous page. Round to the nearest one
percent.
Strategy We will think of this as a percent-of-decrease problem.
WHY We want to ﬁnd what percent of the $59.99 original price the amount of
discount represents.
Solution From the advertisement, we see that the original price of the women’s
shoes is $59.99 and the sale price is $33.99.The discount (decrease in price) is found
using subtraction.
Use the formula: 
Amount of discount  original price  sale price.
The shoes are discounted $26. Now we ﬁnd what percent of the original price the
$26 discount represents.
This is the amount of
discount formula.
Substitute 26 for the amount
of discount and $59.99 for the
original price. Let x represent
the unkown discount rate.
We can drop the dollar signs. To undo the multiplication by 59.99
and isolate x on the right side of the equation, divide both sides
by 59.99.

Use estimation to solve percent

Estimation can be used to ﬁnd approximations when exact answers aren’t necessary.
For example,when dining at a restaurant,it’s helpful to be able to estimate the amount
of the tip.When shopping,the ability to estimate a discount or the sale price of an item
also comes in handy. In this section, we will discuss some estimation methods that can
be used to make quick calculations involving percents.
1
Estimate answers to percent problems involving 1% and 10%.
There is an easy way to ﬁnd 1% of a number that does not require any calculations.
First, recall that 
.Thus, to ﬁnd 1% of a number, we multiply it by 0.01,
and a quick way to multiply the number by 0.01 is to move its decimal point two places
to the left.
1% 

Finding 1% of a Number
To ﬁnd 1% of a number, move the decimal point in the number two places to
the left.
EXAMPLE 1
What is 1% of 423.1? Find the exact answer and an estimate
using front-end rounding.
Strategy To ﬁnd the exact answer, we will move the decimal point in 423.1 two
places to the left. To ﬁnd an estimate, we will move the decimal point in an
approximation of 423.1 two places to the left.
WHY We move the decimal point two places to the left because 1% of a number
means 0.01 of (times) the number.
Solution
Exact answer:
Move the decimal point in 423.1 two places to the left.
Estimate: Recall from Chapter 1 that with front-end rounding, a number is
rounded to its largest place value so that all but its ﬁrst digit is zero.To estimate 1%
of 423.1, we can front-end round 423.1 to 400 and ﬁnd 1% of 400. If we move the
understood decimal point in 400 two places to the left, we get 4.Thus,
Because 1% of 400  4.
1% of 423.1  4
1% of 423.1  4.231

Success Tip
To quickly ﬁnd 2% of a number, ﬁnd 1% of the number by
moving the decimal point two places to the left, and then double (multiply by
2) the result. In Example 1, we found that 1% of 423.1 is 4.231.Thus, 2% of
423.1 is 
.A similar approach can be used to ﬁnd 3% of a
number, 4% of a number, and so on.
2  4.231  8.462
There is also an easy way to ﬁnd 10% of a number that doesn’t require any
calculations. First, recall that 
. Thus, to ﬁnd 10% of a number, we
multiply the number by 0.1, and a quick way to multiply the number by 0.1 is to move
its decimal point one place to the left.

The rule for ﬁnding 10% of a number can be extended to help us quickly ﬁnd
multiples of 10% of a number.
Finding 10% of a Number
To ﬁnd 10% of a number, move the decimal point in the number one place to
the left.
EXAMPLE 2
What is 10% of 6,872 feet? Find the exact answer and an
estimate using front-end rounding.
Strategy To ﬁnd the exact answer, we will move the decimal point in 6,872 one
place to the left. To ﬁnd an estimate, we will move the decimal point in an
approximation of 6,872 one place to the left.
WHY We move the decimal point one place to the left because 10% of a number
means 0.10 of (times) the number.
Solution
Exact answer:
Move the understood decimal point 
in 6,872 one place to the left.
Estimate: To estimate 10% of 6,872 feet,we can front-end round 6,872 to 7,000 and
ﬁnd 10% of 7,000 feet . If we move the understood decimal point in 7,000 one place
to the left, we get 700.Thus,
Because 10% of 7,000  700.
10% of 6,872 feet  700 feet
10% of 6,872 feet  687.2 feet

Caution!
In Examples 1 and 2, front-end rounding was used to ﬁnd estimates
of answers to percent problems. Since there are other ways to approximate
(round) the numbers involved in a percent problem, the answers to estimation
problems may vary.
Finding 20%,30%,40%,...of a Number
To ﬁnd 20% of a number, ﬁnd 10% of the number by moving the decimal
point one place to the left, and then double (multiply by 2) the result.A 
similar approach can be used to ﬁnd 30% of a number, 40% of a number,
and so on.
EXAMPLE 3
Estimate the answer:
What is 20% of 416?
Strategy We will estimate 10% of 416, and double (multiply by 2) the result.
WHY 20% of a number is twice as much as 10% of a number.
Solution Since 10% of 416 is 41.6 (or about 42),it follows that 20% of 416 is about
, which is 84.Thus,
Because 10% of 416  41.6  42 and 2  42  84.

WHY To ﬁnd 50% of a number, we divide the number by 2.
Solution To estimate 50% of 2,595,603, we will ﬁnd 50% of 2,600,000. We use
2,600,000 as an approximation because it is close to 2,595,603, because it is even,
and, therefore, divisible by 2, and because it ends with many zeros.
Because 50% of 2,600,000  2,600,000

Electricity Usage
The average
U.S. household uses 10,656 kilowatt-hours of electricity
each year. Several energy conservation groups would
like each household to take steps to reduce its electricity
usage by 5%. Estimate 5% of 10,656 kilowatt-hours.
(Source: U.S. Department of Energy)
Strategy We will ﬁnd 10% of 10,656. Then, we will
divide an approximation of that result by 2.
WHY 5% of a number is one-half of 10% of a number.
Solution First, we ﬁnd 10% of 10,656.
Move the understood decimal 
point in 10,656 one place to the left.
We will use 1,066 as an approximation of this result because it is close to 1,065.6 and
because it is even, and, therefore, divisible by 2. Next, we divide the approximation
by 2 to estimate 5% of 10,656.
Divide the approximation of 10% of 10,656 by 2.
Thus, 5% of

Interest
When money is borrowed, the lender expects to be paid back the amount of the loan
plus an additional charge for the use of the money. The additional charge is called
interest. When money is deposited in a bank, the depositor is paid for the use of the
money.The money the deposit earns is also called interest.In general,interest is money
that is paid for the use of money.

Calculate simple interest.
Interest is calculated in one of two ways: either as simple interest or as compound
interest. We begin by discussing simple interest. First, we need to introduce some key
terms associated with borrowing or lending money.
• Principal: the amount of money that is invested, deposited, loaned, or
borrowed.
• Interest rate: a percent that is used to calculate the amount of interest to be
paid.The interest rate is assumed to be per year (annual interest) unless
otherwise stated.
• Time: the length of time that the money is invested, deposited, or borrowed.
The amount of interest to be paid depends on the principal, the rate, and the time.
That is why all three are usually mentioned in advertisements for bank accounts,
investments, and loans, as shown below.

If no money is withdrawn from an investment, the investor receives the principal
and the interest at the end of the time period. Similarly, a borrower must repay the
principal and the interest when taking out a loan. In each case, the total amount of
money involved is given by the following formula.
Finding the Total Amount
The total amount in an investment account or the total amount to be repaid on
a loan is the sum of the principal and the interest.
Total amount  principal  interest

Calculate compound interest.
Most savings accounts and investments pay compound interest rather than simple
interest. We have seen that simple interest is paid only on the original principal.
Compound interest is paid on the principal and previously earned interest.To illustrate
this concept, suppose that $2,000 is deposited in a savings account at a rate of 5% for
1 year. We can use the formula 
to calculate the interest earned at the end of 
1 year.
This is the simple interest formula.
Substitute for P, r, and t.
Do the multiplication.
Interest of $100 was earned. At the end of the ﬁrst year, the account contains the
interest ($100) plus the original principal ($2,000), for a balance of $2,100.
Suppose that the money remains in the savings account for another year at the
same interest rate. For the second year, interest will be paid on a principal of $2,100.

That is,during the second year,we earn interest on the interest as well as on the original
$2,000 principal. Using 
, we can ﬁnd the interest earned in the second year.
This is the simple interest formula.
Substitute for P, r, and t.
Do the multiplication.
In the second year, $105 of interest is earned. The account now contains that interest
plus the $2,100 principal, for a total of $2,205.
As the ﬁgure below shows, we calculated the simple interest two times to ﬁnd the
compound interest.

If we compute only the simple interest on $2,000, at 5% for 2 years, the interest

Comparing the balances, we ﬁnd that the account earning compound interest will
contain $5 more than the account earning simple interest.
In the previous example, the interest was calculated at the end of each year, or
annually. When compounding, we can compute the interest in other time spans, such
as semiannually (twice a year), quarterly (four times a year), or even daily.

Strategy We will use the simple interest formula 
four times in a series of

t is .
WHY The interest is compounded quarterly.
Solution If the interest is compounded quarterly, the interest will be computed
four times in one year. To ﬁnd the amount of interest $1,000 will earn in the ﬁrst
quarter of the year, we use the simple interest formula, where t is 
of a year.
This is the simple interest formula.

Calculating compound interest by hand can take a long time. The compound
interest formula can be used to ﬁnd the total amount of money that an account will
contain at the end of the term quickly.
Compound Interest Formula
The total amount A in an account can be found using the formula
where P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate expressed as a decimal, t is
the length of time in years, and n is the number of compoundings in one year.

A calculator is very helpful in performing the operations on the right side of the
compound interest formula.
the 
key is pressed instead of the 
key for the result to be
displayed.
Rounded to the nearest cent, the amount in the account after 3 years will be
$11,610.44.
If your calculator does not have parenthesis keys, calculate the sum within the
parentheses ﬁrst.Then ﬁnd the power. Finally, multiply by 9,250.

Using Your CALCULATOR
Compound Interest
A businessperson invests $9,250 at 7.6% interest, to be compounded monthly.
To ﬁnd what the investment will be worth in 3 years, we use the compound
interest formula with the following values.
P  $9,250
r  7.6%  0.076
t  3 years
n  12 times a year (monthly)
This is the compound interest formula.
Substitute the values of P, r, t, and n.
In the exponent, nt means n t.
Evaluate the exponent: 12(3)  36.
To evaluate the expression on the right-hand side of the equation using a
calculator, we enter these numbers and press these keys.

EXAMPLE 6
Compounding Daily
An investor deposited $50,000 in a
long-term account at 6.8% interest, compounded daily. How much money will he
be able to withdraw in 7 years if the principal is to remain in the bank?
Strategy We will use the compound interest formula to ﬁnd the total amount in
the account after 7 years. Then we will subtract the original principal from that
result.
WHY When the investor withdraws money, he does not want to touch the original
$50,000 principal in the account.

Solution “Compounded daily” means that compounding will be done 365 times
in a year for 7 years.
This is the compound interest formula.
Substitute the values of P, r, t, and n.
In the exponent, nt means n t.
Evaluate the exponent: 365  7  2,555.
Use a calculator. Round to the nearest cent.
The account will contain $80,477.58 at the end of 7 years.To ﬁnd how much money
the man can withdraw, we must subtract the original principal of $50,000 from the
total amount in the account.
The man can withdraw $30,477.58 without having to touch the $50,000 principal.

Ratios and Rates
Ratios are often used to describe important
relationships between two quantities.
A ratio is the quotient of two numbers or the
quotient of two quantities that have the same
units.
Ratios are written in three ways: as fractions, in
words separated by the word to, and using a
colon.

When a ratio compares two quantities, both
quantities must be measured in the same units.
When the units are different, it’s usually easier
to write the ratio using the smaller unit of
measurement.
Write the ratio 5 inches to 2 feet as a fraction in simplest form.
Since inches are smaller than feet, compare in inches:
5 inches to 24 inches
Because 2 feet  24 inches. 
Next, write the ratio in fraction form and simplify.
Remove the common units of inches.

Summary and Review
When we compare two quantities that have
different units (and neither unit can be
converted to the other), we call the comparison
a rate.
To write a rate as a fraction, write the ﬁrst
quantity mentioned as the numerator and the
second 
quantity 
mentioned 
as 
the
denominator, and then simplify, if possible.
Write the units as part of the fraction.
Words such as per, for, in, from, and on are used
to separate the two quantities that are
compared in a rate.
Write the rate 33 miles in 6 hours as a fraction in simplest form.
33 miles in 6 hours can be written as 
Write the units as part of the rate.
The rate can be written as 11 miles per 2 hours.
 11 miles

To simplify, factor 33 and 6. Then
remove the common factor of 3 from
the numerator and denominator.

A unit rate is a rate in which the denominator
is 1.
To write a rate as a unit rate, divide the
numerator of the rate by the denominator.
A slash mark / is often used to write a unit rate.
Write as a unit rate: 2,490 apples from 6 trees.
To ﬁnd the unit rate, divide 2,490 by 6.
The unit rate is 
. This rate can also be expressed as:
,
415 apples per tree, or 415 apples/tree.

A unit price is a rate that tells how much is paid
for one unit (or one item). It is the quotient of
price to the number of units.

Comparison shopping can be made easier by
ﬁnding unit prices. The best buy is the item that
has the lowest unit price.
price

Which is the better buy for shampoo?
12 ounces for $3.84
or
16 ounces for $4.64
To ﬁnd the unit price of a bottle of shampoo, write the quotient of its
price and its weight, and then perform the indicated division. Before
dividing, convert each price from dollars to cents so that the unit price
can be expressed in cents per ounce.
One ounce of shampoo for 29¢ is better than one ounce for 32¢. Thus,
the 16-ounce bottle is the better buy.

Since a proportion is an equation, a proportion
can be true or false. A proportion is true if
its ratios (or rates) are equivalent and false if its
ratios (or rates) are not equivalent.
One way to determine whether a proportion is
true or false is to use the fraction simplifying
skills of Chapter 3.
The two products found by multiplying
diagonally in a proportion are called cross
products.
Another 
way 
to 
determine 
whether 
a
proportion is true or false involves the cross
products. If the cross products are equal, the
proportion is true. If the cross products are not
equal, the proportion is false.
Determine whether the proportion 
is true or false.
Method 1 Simplify any ratios in the proportion that are not in simplest
form.Then compare them to determine whether they are equal.
Simplify the ratio on the right side. 
Since the ratios on the left and right sides of the proportion are not
equal, the proportion is false.
Method 2 Check to see whether the cross products are equal.

Summary and Review
When two pairs of numbers form a proportion,
we say that they are proportional.
Determine whether 0.7, 0.3 and 2.1, 0.9 are proportional.
Write two ratios and form a proportion. Then ﬁnd the cross products.

Since the cross products are equal, the numbers are proportional.

Solving a proportion to ﬁnd an unknown term:
1. Set the cross products equal to each other
to form an equation.
2. Isolate the variable on one side of the
equation by dividing both sides by the
number that is multiplied by that variable.
3. Check by substituting the result into the
original proportion and ﬁnding the cross
products.
Solve the proportion:
This is the proportion to solve.
Thus, x is 15. Check this result in the original proportion by ﬁnding the
cross products.
To simplify the left side, remove the
common factor of 5. To simplify the
right side, do the division: 75  5  15.

To undo the multiplication by 5 and
isolate x, divide both sides by 5.

Analyze
• We can express the fact that it takes 360 peanuts to make 
8 ounces of peanut butter as a rate:
.
• How many peanuts does it take to make 12 ounces?
Form We will let the variable p represent the unknown number of
peanuts.
360 peanuts is to 8 ounces as p peanuts is to 12 ounces.
Solve To ﬁnd the number of peanuts needed, solve the proportion
for p.
State It takes 540 peanuts to make 12 ounces of peanut butter.
Check 16 ounces of peanut butter would require twice as many
peanuts as 8 ounces:
.
It seems
reasonable that 12 ounces would require 540 peanuts.

FURNITURE SALES Find the discount rate on a living room set
regularly priced at $2,500 that is on sale for $1,870. Round to the
nearest one percent.
We will think of this as a percent-of-decrease problem. The discount
(decrease in price) is found using subtraction.
Discount  original price  sale price
The living room set is discounted $630. Now we ﬁnd what percent of
the original price the $630 discount represents.
Drop the dollar signs. To isolate x
on the right side of the equation,
divide both sides by 2,500.
On the right side of the equation,
remove the common factor of
2,500 from the numerator and
denominator. On the left side,
divide 630 by 2,500.

Compound interest is interest earned on the
original principal and previously earned interest.
When compounding, we can calculate interest:
• annually: once a year
• semiannually: twice a year
• quarterly: four times a year
• daily: 365 times a year
COMPOUND INTEREST Suppose $10,000 is deposited in an
account that earns 6.5% compounded semiannually. Find the amount
of money in an account at the end of the ﬁrst year.
The word semiannually means that the interest will be compounded
two times in one year.To ﬁnd the amount of interest $10,000 will earn
in the ﬁrst half of the year, use the simple interest formula, where t is
of a year.
Interest earned in the ﬁrst half of the year:

businesses.They must have the ability to quickly and accurately
compare similarities and differences among sets of letters,
numbers,objects,pictures,and patterns.They also need
to have strong problem-solving skills to redirect
mislabeled letters and packages.Mail carriers weigh items
on postal scales and make calculations with money as they
read postage rate tables.
In Problem 19 of Study Set 6.1,you will see how a mail
carrier must be able to read a postal rate table and know
American units of weight to determine the cost to send a
package using priority mail.
JOB TITLE:

We live in an information age. Never before have so many facts and ﬁgures been right
at our ﬁngertips. Since information is often presented in the form of tables or graphs,
we need to be able to read and make sense of data displayed in that way.
The following table, bar graph, and circle graph (or pie chart) show the results of
a shopper survey. A large sample of adults were asked how far in advance they
typically shop for a gift. In the bar graph, the length of a bar represents the percent of
responses for a given shopping method.In the circle graph,the size of a colored region
represents the percent of responses for a given shopping method.
Shopper Survey
How far in advance gift givers typically shop
(Source: Harris interactive online study via QuickQuery for Gifts.com)
It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words.That is the case here,where
the graphs display the results of the survey more clearly than the table. It’s easy to see
from the graphs that most people shop within a week of when they need to purchase a
gift.It is also apparent that same-day shopping for a gift was the least popular response.
That information also appears in the table, but it is just not as obvious.

Postal Rates
Refer to the table of priority mail postal
rates (from 2009) below. Find the cost of mailing an 
-pound package by priority
mail to postal zone 4.
Strategy We will read the number at the intersection of the 9th row and the
column labeled Zone 4.
WHY Since 
pounds is more than 8 pounds, we cannot use the 8th row. Since 
pounds does not exceed 9 pounds, we use the 9th row of the table.
Solution
The number at the intersection of the 9th row (in red) and the column labeled
Zone 4 (in blue) is 13.95 (in purple). This means it would cost $13.95 to mail the 
-pound package by priority mail.

Read tables.
Data are often presented in tables, with information organized in rows and columns.
To read a table, we must ﬁnd the intersection of the row and column that contains the
desired information.

Read bar graphs.
Another popular way to display data is to use a bar graph with bars drawn vertically
or horizontally. The relative heights (or lengths) of the bars make for easy
comparisons of values. A horizontal or vertical line used for reference in a bar graph
is called an axis. The horizontal axis and the vertical axis of a bar graph serve to frame
the graph, and they are scaled in units such as years, dollars, minutes, pounds, and
percent.

Speed of Animals
The following bar graph shows the
maximum speeds for several animals over a given distance.
a. What animal in the graph has the fastest maximum speed?
b. What animal in the graph has the slowest maximum speed?
c. How much greater is the maximum speed of a lion compared to that of a
coyote?
Strategy We will locate the name of each desired animal on the vertical axis and
move right to the end of its corresponding bar.
WHY Then we can extend downward and read the animal’s maximum speed on
the horizontal axis scale.
Solution
a. The longest bar in the graph has a length of 70 units and corresponds to a
cheetah. Of all the animals listed in the graph, the cheetah has the fastest
maximum speed at 70 mph.
b. The shortest bar in the graph has a length of approximately 9 units and
corresponds to a chicken. Of all the animals listed in the graph, the chicken
has the slowest maximum speed at 9 mph.
c. The length of the bar that represents a lion’s maximum speed is 50 units long
and the length of the bar that represents a coyote’s maximum speed appears
to be 43 units long.To ﬁnd how much greater is the maximum speed of a lion
compared to that of a coyote, we subtract
50 mph – 43 mph = 7 mph
The maximum speed of a lion is about 7 mph faster than the maximum speed
of a coyote.
Subtract the coyote’s maximum speed
from the lion’s maximum speed.

Strategy To answer questions about years, we will locate the correct colored bar
and look at the horizontal axis of the graph.To answer questions about the income,
we will locate the correct colored bar and extend to the left to look at the vertical
axis of the graph.
WHY The years appear on the horizontal axis.The height of each bar,representing
income in billions of dollars, is measured on the scale on the vertical axis.
Solution
a. The second group of bars indicates income in the year 2000.According to the
color key, the blue bar of that group shows the retail sales. Since the vertical
axis is scaled in units of $250 billion, the height of that bar is approximately 
500 plus one-half of 250, or 125.Thus, the height of the blue bar is approximately
500  125  625, which represents $625 billion in retail sales in 2000.
b. In each group, the green bar is the tallest.That bar, according to the color key,
represents the income from the services sector of the economy.Thus, services
consistently generated the most income.
c. According to the color key, the orange bar in each group shows income from
the wholesale sector.That sector generated about $260 billion of income in
1990 and $700 billion in income in 2007.The amount of increase is the
difference of these two quantities.
$700 billion  $260 billion  $440 billion
Wholesale income increased by about $440 billion between 1990 and 2007.

Caution!
One drawback of a pictograph is that it can be
difﬁcult to determine what fractional amount is represented
by a portion of a symbol. For example, if the CD shown to
the right represents 1,000 units sold, we can only estimate
that the partial CD symbol represents about 600 units sold.
Read circle graphs.
In a circle graph, regions called sectors are used to show what part of the whole each
quantity represents.
The Language of Mathematics
A sector has the shape of a slice of pizza or a
slice of pie.Thus, circle graphs are also called pie charts.

Solution
The top row contains 3 complete pizza symbols and what appears to be

Strategy We will look for the key words in each problem.
WHY Key words tell us what operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or

Another type of graph, called a line graph, is used to show how quantities change with
time. From such a graph, we can determine when a quantity is increasing and when it
is decreasing.

contributions of all the listed sources and subtract that total from 100%.
100% (10%  12%  7%  10%  4%  10% )  100%  53%  47%
Countries that are not listed in the graph produced 47% of the world’s total
production of gold in 2008.
c. From the graph we see that China produced 12% of the world’s gold in 2008.
To ﬁnd the number of ounces produced by China (the amount), we use the
method for solving percent problems from Section 5.4.

Strategy We will determine whether the graph is rising, falling, or is horizontal.
WHY When the graph rises as we read from left to right, the number of ATMs is
increasing.When the graph falls as we read from left to right, the number of ATMs
is decreasing. If the graph is horizontal, there is no change in the number of ATMs.
Solution
a. To ﬁnd the number of ATMs in 2001, we follow the dashed blue line from the
label 2001 on the horizontal axis straight up to the line graph.Then we extend
directly over to the scale on the vertical axis, where the arrowhead points to
approximately 325. Since the vertical scale is in thousands of ATMs, there were
about 325,000 ATMs in 2001 in the United States.
b. This line graph is composed of seven line segments that connect pairs of
consecutive years.The steepest of those seven segments represents the
greatest increase in the number of ATMs. Since that segment is between 
the 2000 and 2001, the greatest increase in the number of ATMs occurred
between 2000 and 2001.
c. The only line segment of the graph that falls as we read from left to right is the
segment connecting the data points for the years 2006 and 2007.Thus, the
number of ATMs decreased from 2006 to 2007.
d. The line segment connecting the data points for the years 2005 and 2006 appears
to be horizontal. Since there is little or no change in the number of ATMS for
those years, the number of ATMs remained about the same from 2005 to 2006.
EXAMPLE 7
Trains
The line graph below shows the movements of two
trains. The horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents the
distance that the trains have traveled.
a. How are the trains moving at time A?
b. At what time (A, B, C, D, or E) are both
trains stopped?
c. At what times have both trains traveled
the same distance?
Strategy We will determine whether the
graphs are rising or are horizontal.We will
also consider the relative positions of the
graphs for a given time.
WHY A rising graph indicates the train is moving and a horizontal graph means it
is stopped.For any given time,the higher graph indicates that the train it represents
has traveled the greater distance.
Solution
The movement of train 1 is represented by the red line, and that of train 2 is
represented by the blue line.
a. At time A, the blue line is rising.This shows that the distance traveled by train
2 is increasing.Thus, at time A, train 2 is moving.At time A, the red line is
horizontal.This indicates that the distance traveled by train 1 is not changing:
At time A, train 1 is stopped.
b. To ﬁnd the time at which both trains are stopped, we ﬁnd the time at which both
the red and the blue lines are horizontal.At time B, both trains are stopped.

Read histograms and frequency polygons.
A company that makes vitamins is sponsoring a program on a cable TV channel.The
marketing department must choose from three advertisements to show during the
program.
1. Children talking about a chewable vitamin that the company makes.
2. A college student talking about an active-life vitamin that the company makes.
3. A grandmother talking about a multivitamin that the company makes.
A survey of the viewing audience records the age of each viewer,
counting the number in the 6-to-15-year-old age group, the 16-to-
25-year-old age group, and so on.The graph of the data is displayed in
a special type of bar graph called a histogram, as shown on the right.
The vertical axis, labeled Frequency, indicates the number of viewers
in each age group. For example, the histogram shows that 105 viewers
are in the 36-to-45-year-old age group.
A histogram is a bar graph with three important features.
1. The bars of a histogram touch.
2. Data values never fall at the edge of a bar.
3. The widths of each bar are equal and represent a range of values.
The width of each bar of a histogram represents a range of numbers called a class
interval. The histogram above has 7 class intervals, each representing an age span of
10 years. Since most viewers are in the 16-to-25-year-old age group, the marketing
department decides to advertise the active-life vitamins in commercials that appeal to
young adults.

Carry-on Luggage
An airline weighed the carry-on
luggage of 2,260 passengers.The data is displayed in the histogram below.
a. How many passengers carried
luggage in the 8-to-11-pound
range?
b. How many carried luggage in
the 12-to-19-pound range?
Strategy We will examine the
scale on the horizontal axis of the
histogram and identify the interval
that contains the given range of
weight for the carry-on luggage.
WHY Then we can read the height
of the corresponding bar to answer
the question.
Solution
a. The second bar, with edges at 7.5 and 11.5 pounds, corresponds to the 8-to-11-
pound range. Use the height of the bar (or the number written there) to
determine that 430 passengers carried such luggage.
b. The 12-to-19-pound range is covered by two bars. The total number of
passengers with luggage in this range is 970  540, or 1,510.

Objectives
1
Find the mean (average) of a set
of values.
2
Find the weighted mean of a
set of values.
3
Find the median of a set of
values.
4
Find the mode of a set of
values.
5
Use the mean,median,and
mode to describe a set of
values.
Graphs are not the only way of describing sets of numbers in a compact form.Another
way to describe a set of numbers is to ﬁnd one value around which the numbers in the
set are grouped.We call such a value a measure of central tendency. In Section 7.8, we
studied the most popular measure of central tendency, the mean or average. In this
section we will examine two other measures of central tendency,called the median and
the mode.
Find the mean (average) of a set of values.
Recall that the mean or average of a set of values gives an indication of the “center”
of the set of values.To review this concept, let’s consider the case of a student who has
taken ﬁve tests this semester in a history class scoring  87, 73, 89, 92, and 84.To ﬁnd out
how well she is doing, she calculates the mean, or the average, of these scores, by
ﬁnding their sum and then dividing it by 5.
In the numerator, do the addition.
Do the division.
The mean is 85. Some scores were better and some were worse, but 85 is a good
indication of her performance in the class.
Success Tip
The mean (average) is a single value that is “typical” of a set of
values. It can be, but is not necessarily, one of the values in the set. In the
previous example, note that the student’s mean score was 85; however, she did
not score 85 on any of the tests.
Finding the Mean (Arithmetic Average)
The mean, or the average, of a set of values is given by the formula:
The Language of Mathematics
The mean (average) of a set of values is
more formally called the arithmetic mean (pronounced air-rith-MET-tick).

WHY To ﬁnd the mean (average) of a set of values,we divide the sum of the values
by the number of values. In this case, there are 6 days of sales (Monday through
Saturday).
Solution
Since there are 6 days of sales, divide the sum by 6.
In the numerator, do the addition.
Do the division.
The mean of the week’s daily sales in the women’s department is $2,406.
Using Your CALCULATOR
Finding the Mean
Most scientiﬁc calculators do statistical calculations and can easily ﬁnd the
mean of a set of numbers.To use a scientiﬁc calculator in statistical mode to
ﬁnd the mean in Example 1, try these keystrokes:
• Set the calculator to statistical mode.
• Reset the calculator to clear the statistical registers.
• Enter each number, followed by the 
key instead of the 
key.
That is, enter 3,135, press 
, enter 2,310, press 
, and so on.
• When all data are entered, ﬁnd the mean by pressing the 
key.You
may need to press 
ﬁrst.The mean is 2,406.
Because keystrokes vary among calculator brands, you might have to check
the owner’s manual if these instructions don’t work.

Find the weighted mean of a set of values.
When a value in a set appears more than once, that value has a greater “inﬂuence” on
the mean than another value that only occurs a single time.To simplify the process of
ﬁnding a mean, any value that appears more than once can be “weighted” by
multiplying it by the number of times it occurs. A mean that is found in this way is
called a weighted mean.

Hotel Reservations
A hotel electronically recorded the number of
times the reservation desk telephone rang
before it was answered by a receptionist. The
results of the week-long survey are shown in
the table on the right. Find the average
number of times the phone rang before a
receptionist answered.
Strategy First, we will determine the total
number of times the reservation desk telephone
rang during the week before it was answered.
Then we will divide that result by the total number of calls received.
WHY To ﬁnd the average of a set of values, we divide the sum of the values by the
number of values.
Solution
To ﬁnd the total number of times the reservation desk telephone rang during the
week before it was answered, we multiply each number of rings (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) by
the number of times it occurred and add those results to get 450. The calculations

Another example of a weighted mean is a grade point average (GPA). To ﬁnd a
GPA, we divide:

Finding GPAs
Find the semester grade point average for a
student that received the following grades. Round to the nearest hundredth.
Strategy First, we will determine the total number of grade points earned by the
student.Then we will divide that result by the total number of credits.
WHY To ﬁnd the mean of a set of values, we divide the sum of the values by the

Solution
The point values of grades that are used at most colleges and universities are:
A: 4 pts
B: 3 pts
C: 2 pts
D: 1 pt
F: 0 pt
To ﬁnd the total number of grade points that the student earned, we multiply the
number of credits for each course by the point value of the grade received.Then we
add those results to ﬁnd that the total number of grade points is 39.The calculations

Find the median of a set of values.
The mean is not always the best measure of central tendency. It can be affected by
very high or very low values. For example, suppose the weekly earnings of four
workers in a small company are $280,$300,$380,and $240,and the owner pays himself
$5,000 a week.At that company, the mean salary per week is
In the numerator, do the addition.
Do the division.
The owner could say, “Our employees earn an average of $1,240 per week.” Clearly,
the mean does not fairly represent the typical worker’s salary there.
A better measure of the company’s typical salary is the median: the salary in the
middle when all of them are arranged by size.

scores of 59, four scores of 77, and scores of 43, 47, 53, 60, 68, 82, and 97. Find the
median score.
Strategy We will arrange the fourteen exam scores in increasing order.
WHY It is easier to ﬁnd the two middle scores when they are written in that way.
Solution
Since there is an even number of exam scores, we need to identify the two middle
scores.

Since there is an even number of scores, the median is the average (mean) of the
two scores closest to the middle: the 60 and the 68.

Success Tip
The median is a single value that is “typical” of a set of values.
It can be, but is not necessarily, one of the values in the set. In Example 5, the
median, 7.5, was one of the given values. In Example 6, the median exam
score, 64, was not in the given set of exam scores.
Find the mode of a set of values.
The mean and the median are not always the best measure of central tendency. For
example, suppose a hardware store displays 20 outdoor thermometers. Ten of them
read 80, and the other ten all have different readings.
To choose an accurate thermometer, should we choose one with a reading that is
closest to the mean of all 20, or to their median? Neither. Instead, we should choose

correct.
By choosing that temperature that appears most often, we have chosen the mode
of the 20 values.
The Mode
The mode of a set of values is the single value that occurs most often.The
mode of several values is also called the modal value.

The Language of Mathematics
In Example 7, the given set of values has one
mode. If a set of values has two modes (exactly two values that occur an equal
number of times and more often than any other value) it is said to be bimodal.
If no value in a set occurs more often than another, then there is no mode.
Use the mean,median,and mode to describe a set of values.

Graphs and Statistics
A bar graph presents data using vertical or
horizontal bars. A horizontal axis and vertical
axis serve to frame the graph and they are
scaled in units such as years, dollars, minutes,
pounds, and percent.
CANCER DEATHS Refer to the bar graph below. How many more
deaths were caused by lung cancer than by colon cancer in the United
States in 2007?
From the graph, we see that there were about 160,000 deaths caused by
lung cancer and about 50,000 deaths from colon cancer. To ﬁnd the
difference, we subtract:
160,000 – 50,000 = 110,000
There were about 110,000 more deaths caused by lung cancer than
deaths caused by colon cancer in the United States in 2007.

To compare sets of related data, groups of two
(or three) bars can be shown.For double-bar or
triple-bar graphs, a key is used to explain the
meaning of each type of bar in a group.
SEAT BELTS Refer to the double-bar graph below. How did the
percent of male high school students that rarely or never wore seat
belts change from 2001 to 2007?
From the graph, we see that in 2001 about 18% of male high school
students rarely or never wore seat belts. By 2007, the percent was about
14%, a decrease of 18%  14%, or 4%.

In a circle graph, regions called sectors (they
look like slices of pizza) are used to show what
part of the whole each quantity represents.
CHECKING E-MAIL The circle
graph to the right shows the results of
a survey of adults who were asked
how many personal e-mail addresses
they regularly check.What percent of
the adults surveyed check 4 or more
e-mail addresses regularly?
We add the percent of the responses for 4 or 5 e-mail addresses and the
percent of the responses for 6 or more e-mail addresses:
5% + 5% = 10%
Thus,10% of the adults surveyed check 4 or more e-mail addresses
regularly.
Use the survey results to predict the number of adults in a group of
5,000 that would check only one e-mail address regularly.
In the survey, 42% said they check only one e-mail address.We need to

Graphs and Statistics
When did the popularity of snowboarding seem to peak?
The years with the highest participation were 2003 and 2004.
Between which two years was there the greatest decrease in the
number of snowboarding participants?
The line segment with the greatest “fall” as we read left to right is
the segment connecting the data points for the years 2005 and
2006. Thus, the greatest decrease in the number of snowboarding
participants occurred between 2005 and 2006.
Two quantities that are changing with time can
be compared by drawing both lines on the same
graph.
SKATEBOARDING Refer to the line graphs below that show the
results of a skateboarding race.
Observations:
• Since the red graph is well above the blue graph at time A,
skateboarder 1 was well ahead of skateboarder 2 at that stage
of the race.
• Since the red graph is horizontal from time A to time B,
skateboarder 1 had stopped.
• Since the blue graph crosses the red graph at time B, at that
instant, the skateboarders are tied for the lead.
• Since the blue graph crosses the dashed ﬁnish line at time C,
which is sooner than time D, skateboarder 2 won the race.

A histogram is a bar graph with these features:
1.
The bars of the histogram touch.
2.
Data values never fall at the edge of a
bar.
3.
The widths of the bars are equal and
represent a range of values.
SLEEP A group of parents of
junior 
high 
students 
were
surveyed and asked to estimate
the number of hours that their
children slept each night. The
results are displayed in the
histogram to the right. How
many children sleep 6 to 9 hours
a night?
The bar with edges 5.5 and 7.5 corresponds to the 6 to 7 hour range.The
height of that bar indicates that 42 children sleep 6 to 7 hours.The bar
with edges 7.5 and 9.5 corresponds to the 8 to 9 hour range.The height
of that bar indicates that 93 children sleep 8 to 9 hours. The total
number of children sleeping 6 to 9 hours is found using addition:
42 + 93 = 135
135 of the junior high children sleep 6 to 9 hours a night.

Mean,Median,and Mode
It is often beneﬁcial to use one number to
represent the “center” of all the numbers in a
set of data.There are three measures of central
tendency: mean, median, mode.
The mean of a set of values is given by the
formula
Mean  sum of the values

When a value in a set appears more than once,
that value has a greater “inﬂuence” on the
mean than another value that only occurs a
single time. To simplify the process of ﬁnding
the mean, any value that appears more than
once can be “weighted” by multiplying it by the
number of times it occurs.
To ﬁnd the weighted mean of a set of values:
1.
Multiply each value by the number of
times it occurs.
2.
Find the sum of the products from step 1.
3.
Divide the sum from step 2 by the total
number of individual values.
A student’s grade point average (GPA) can be
found using a weighted mean.
Some schools assign a certain number of credit
hours to a course while others assign a certain
number of units.
GPAs Find the semester grade point average for a student that
received the following grades. (The point values are A = 4, B = 3, C = 2,
D = 1, and F = 0.)

Objectives
1
Read tables and graphs.
2
Use the basic vocabulary and
notation of algebra.
3
Identify algebraic expressions
and equations.
4
Use equations to construct tables
of data.
Algebra is the result of contributions from many cultures over thousands of years.The
word algebra comes from the title of the book Ihm Al-jabr wa’l muqa¯balah, written by
the Arabian mathematician al-Khwarizmi around A.D. 800. Using the vocabulary and
notation of algebra, we can mathematically model many situations in the real world.
In this section, we begin to explore the language of algebra by introducing some of its
basic components.
1
Read tables and graphs.
Two-column tables are often used to describe numerical relationships. For example,
the table below lists the number of bicycle tires a production planner must order when
a given number of bicycles are to be manufactured. For a production run of, say,
300 bikes, we locate 300 in the left-hand column and then scan across the table to see
that the company must order 600 tires.
The information in the table can be presented in a bar graph as shown below.The
horizontal axis labeled “Number of bicycles to be manufactured” has been scaled in
units of 100 bicycles. The vertical axis, labeled “Number of tires to order,” is scaled
in units of 100 tires. The bars directly over each of the production amounts extend
to a height indicating the corresponding number of tires to order. For example, if
200 bikes are to be manufactured, the height of the bar indicates that 400 tires should
be ordered.

The Language of Algebra
Horizontal is a form of the word horizon. Think
of the sun setting over the horizon. For vertical, think of vertical blinds.They
are usually used as window coverings for large window areas and run up and
down.
Another way to present the information is with a line graph. Instead of using a
bar to denote the number of tires to order for a production run of a given size, we use
a dot drawn at the correct height.After drawing the four data points for 100, 200, 300,
and 400 bicycles, we connect them with line segments to create the following line
graph.

EXAMPLE 1
Use the line graph to ﬁnd the number of tires needed when
250 bicycles are to be manufactured.
Strategy We will start on the horizontal axis at 250.Then we will scan up to the line,
and over, to read the number of tires to order on the vertical axis.
WHY We start on the horizontal axis because that scale gives the number of bicycles
to be manufactured.We scan up and over to the vertical axis because that scale gives
the number of tires to order.
Solution
First, locate 250 (between 200 and 300) on the horizontal axis. Then draw a line
straight up to intersect the graph. (See the ﬁgure below.) From the point of
intersection, draw a horizontal line to the left that intersects the vertical axis. We
see that the number of tires to order is 500.

The line graph not only presents all the information contained in the table and the
bar graph, it also provides additional information that they do not.We can use the line
graph to ﬁnd the number of tires to order for a production run of a size not shown in
the table or the bar graph.

Use the basic vocabulary and notation of algebra.
From the table, the bar graph, and the line graph, we see that there is a relationship
between the number of tires to order and the number of bicycles to be manufactured.
Using words, we can express this relationship as follows:
“The number of tires to order is two times the number of bicycles to be
manufactured.”
Since the word product is used to indicate the answer to a multiplication, we can
restate the relationship this way:
“The number of tires to order is the product of 2 and the number of bicycles to
be manufactured.”
To indicate other arithmetic operations, we will use the following words.
• A sum is the result of an addition:The sum of 5 and 6 is equal to 11.
• A difference is the result of a subtraction:The difference of 3 and 2 is equal
to 1.
• A quotient is the result of a division:The quotient of 6 and 3 is equal to 2.
Many symbols used in arithmetic are also used in algebra. For example, a 
symbol is
used to indicate addition, and a 
symbol is used to indicate subtraction, and an 
symbol means is equal to. Because the letter 
is often used in algebra and could be
confused with the multiplication symbol 
, we usually write multiplication using a
raised dot or parentheses.

x



There are a few ways to indicate division. In algebra, the symbol most often used
to indicate division is the fraction bar.

Identify algebraic expressions and equations.
Another way to describe the tires–to–bicycles relationship uses variables. Variables
are letters (or symbols) that stand for numbers. If we let the letter 
represent the
number of bicycles to be manufactured, then the number of tires to order is two 
times , written 
. In the notation, the number 2 is an example of a constant because
it does not change value.

The Language of Algebra
Since the number of bicycles to be manufactured
can vary, or change, it is represented using a variable.
When multiplying a variable by a number, or a variable by another variable, we
can omit the symbol for multiplication. For example,

Algebraic Expressions
Variables and/or numbers can be combined with the operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division to create algebraic expressions.
Here are some other examples of algebraic expressions.
This expression is a combination of the numbers 4 and 7, the variable a, and
the operations of multiplication and addition.
This expression is a combination of the numbers 10 and 3, the variable y, and
the operations of subtraction and division.

In the bicycle-manufacturing example, using the equation 
to describe
the relationship has one major advantage over the other methods we have dis-
cussed. It can be used to determine the number of tires needed for a production run
of any size.

Use equations to construct tables of data.
Equations such as 
,which express a relationship between two or more variables,
are called formulas. Formulas are used in many ﬁelds, such as economics, biology,
nursing, and construction. In the next example, we will see that the results found using
the formula

Strategy In the formula 
, we will replace 
with 233 and then with 852.
WHY We need to ﬁnd the number of tires to order for two different-sized
production runs.
Solution
Step 1 We begin by constructing a two-column
table with the appropriate column headings. The
size of each production run (233 and 852) is
entered in the left-hand column of the table.
Step 2 We use the formula 
to ﬁnd the
number of tires needed if 233 and 852 bicycles are
to be manufactured.
Replace b with 233.
Replace b with 852.
Step 3 We enter these results in the right-hand col-
umn of the table: 466 tires for 233 bicycles to be
manufactured and 1,704 tires for 852 bicycles to be
manufactured.

The Real Numbers

We have discussed the set of whole numbers, natural numbers, integers, and the set of
prime numbers.In this section,we review these sets of numbers and show that they are
part of a larger collection of numbers called real numbers.

Review the set of integers.
In the table, we see the low temperatures for
Rockford during the ﬁrst week of January. In the
left column, we have used the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, and 7 to denote the calendar days of the
month. This collection of numbers is called a set,
and the members (or elements) of the set can be
listed within braces
.
Each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is a
member of a basic set of numbers called the natural
numbers, the numbers that we use for counting.

The symbol

Caution!
Since every natural number is a whole number, we say that the set
of natural numbers is a subset of the set of whole numbers. However, not all
whole numbers are natural numbers. Note that 0 is a whole number but not a
natural number.
The table above contains positive and negative temperatures.For example,on the
second day of the month,the low temperature was 
(read as “negative 5 degrees”),
and it means 
below zero. On the ﬁfth day, the low temperature was 
(
above
zero).The numbers used to represent the temperatures listed in the table are members
of a set of numbers called the integers.

Caution!
Since every whole number is an integer, we say that the set of
whole numbers is a subset of the set of integers.The natural numbers are also a
subset of the integers. However, not all integers are whole numbers, nor are
they all natural numbers. For example, the integer 
is neither a whole
number nor a natural number.

Graph sets of numbers on the number line.
We can illustrate sets of numbers with the number line. Like a ruler, the number line
is straight and has uniform markings, as in the number line below. The arrowheads
indicate that the number line continues forever to the left and to the right. Numbers
to the right of 0 have values that are greater than 0; they are called positive numbers.
Numbers to the left of 0 have values that are less than 0; they are called negative
numbers. The number 0 is neither positive nor negative.

Positive numbers can be written with or without a 
sign. For example,
.
Negative numbers are always written with a 
sign. They can be used to describe
amounts that are less than 0, such as a checking account that is $75 overdrawn 
an elevation of 200 feet below sea level (
ft), and a loss of 8 points 
.
Using a process known as graphing, a single number or a set of numbers can be
represented on a number line.The graph of a number is the point on the number line
that corresponds to that number. To graph a number means to locate its position on
the number line and then to highlight it by using a heavy dot.

Deﬁne the set of rational numbers.
In this course, we will work with positive and negative fractions. For example, the time 
it takes a motorist to complete the commute home might be of an hour,or a surveyor 
might indicate that a building’s foundation has fallen below ﬁnished grade by 
expressing its elevation as 
of an inch.
We will also work with positive and negative mixed numbers.For example,a piece 
of fabric might be 
yards long, or the time before a rocket launch might be 
expressed as “
minutes and counting.”
Fractions and mixed numbers belong to the set of rational numbers, so named
because rational numbers can be written as the ratio (or quotient) of two integers.This
means that rational numbers can be written in the fractional form:
The numerator can be any integer.
The denominator can be any integer except 0.

Fractions such as 
and 
are rational numbers, because they have an integer 
numerator and a nonzero integer denominator.We can use the fact that
to show that negative fractions are rational numbers. For example,

number because it can be written as 
or as 
Positive and negative mixed numbers 
such as 
and 
are also rational numbers because they can be written as the 
ratios of two integers.
Many numerical quantities are expressed in decimal notation. For example, a candy
bar might cost $0.89, or a dragster might travel at 203.156 mph, or the ﬁrst-quarter loss
of a business might be 
million. Since these terminating decimals can be written
as ratios of two integers, they are rational numbers.
To ﬁnd the decimal equivalent for a fraction, we divide its numerator by its 
denominator. For example, to write as an equivalent decimal, we proceed as follows:
Decimals such as 0.33333 
and 2.161616 
are repeating decimals and can also
be represented using overbar notation.
and

In fact,
any repeating decimal can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. For this reason,

Find the sum of two real numbers with the same sign.
We can use a number line to explain the addition of signed numbers. For example, the
number line on the next page shows the steps that are used to compute 
. We
begin at the origin (the zero point) and draw an arrow 5 units long, pointing to the
right; this represents 5. From that point, we draw an arrow 2 units long, also pointing
to the right; this represents 2.We end up at 7; therefore,

As a check, think of this problem in terms of money. If you had a debt of $5,
and
then had another debt of $2,
, you would have a debt of $7,
.
From these two examples, we observe that when we add two numbers with the
same sign, the arrows point in the same direction and they build upon each other.
Furthermore, the answer that they point to has the same sign as the numbers that are
being added. If both numbers are positive, their sum is positive. If both numbers are
negative, their sum is negative.

The sum of two positive numbers is always positive.The sum of
two negative numbers is always negative.

The Language of Algebra
A positive number and a negative number are
said to have unlike or different signs.
From these two examples, we observe that when we add two numbers with
different signs, the arrows point in opposite directions. Furthermore, the longer arrow
determines the sign of the answer. If the longer arrow represents a positive number,
the sum is positive. If the longer arrow represents a negative number, the sum is
negative.

Find the 2008 net income of the Barnes & Noble Corporation
from the data given in the graph on page 595.
Strategy We will add the signed numbers that represent the quarterly proﬁts and
losses.
WHY The 2008 net income is the sum of the quarterly proﬁts/losses that year.
Solution
To ﬁnd the annual net income, we add the 2008 quarterly proﬁts and losses,
performing the additions as they occur from left to right.
In 2008, Barnes & Noble’s net income was $110 million.

The Language of Algebra
Commutative is a form of the word commute,
meaning to go back and forth. Commuter trains take people to and from 
work.
To ﬁnd the sum of three numbers, we ﬁrst add two of them and then add the third
to that result. In the following example, we add 
in two ways.To show this,
we will use grouping symbols 
, called parentheses. Standard practice requires that
we perform the operations within parentheses ﬁrst.
Method 1: Group 
and 7
Because of the parentheses, add 
and 7 ﬁrst to get 4.
Then add 4 and 5.
Method 2: Group 7 and 5
Because of the parentheses, add 7 and 5 ﬁrst to get 12.
Then add 
and 12.

A contestant on “Jeopardy!” answered the
ﬁrst question correctly to win $100, missed the second question to lose $200,
answered the third question correctly to win $300, and answered the fourth
question incorrectly to lose $400. Find her net gain or loss after four questions.
Strategy We will add the amounts won and lost after the four questions she had
answered.
WHY The net gain or loss after four questions is the sum of the signed amounts from
each question.
Solution
“To win $100” can be represented by 100. “To lose $200” can be represented by
“To win $300” can be represented by 300, and “to lose $400” can be
represented by 
. Her net gain or loss is the sum of these four numbers. We
can ﬁnd the sum by performing the additions from left to right. An alternate
method, which uses the commutative and associative properties of addition, is to
add the positives, then add the negatives, and add those results.
Reorder the numbers.
Group the positives together. Group
the negatives together using
brackets [
].
Add the positives. Add the negatives.

“College students sleep an average of six to seven hours a night,down from seven
to seven and a half in the 1980s.”
National Sleep Foundation Alert,April 21,2004
Because of our demanding schedules, many of us don’t get enough sleep.
According to the National Sleep Foundation, sleep deprivation is a common
problem among college students.As a result, we build up a sleep debt. For
example, if you require 8 hours of sleep a night, but only get 7, your sleep debt
is 
hour. It is possible to make up sleep if your sleep debt is not too great. It
takes about two hours of weekend sleep to make up for every lost hour of
sleep during the week.
How many hours of sleep do you need each night to feel refreshed in the
morning? To see whether you get the necessary sleep during the week,
complete the following log. On Friday, determine whether you have a sleep
debt.Then calculate how many extra hours you need to sleep on the weekend
to make up for the sleep debt.

Use the deﬁnition of subtraction.
The minus symbol 
is used to indicate subtraction. However, this symbol is also used
in many other ways, depending on where it appears in an expression.
This is read “4 minus 9.”
This is usually read “negative three.” It can also be read as “the additive inverse
of three” or “the opposite of three.”
This is usually read as “the opposite of negative two” or “the additive inverse
of negative 2.”
In the expression 
,parentheses help us write the opposite of a negative number.
To simplify this expression we ﬁnd the opposite of the number in the parentheses.
Read this equation as “the opposite of negative two is two.”
The above equation suggests the following rule.

can be thought of as taking 2 away from 5. We can use the
number line below to illustrate this. Beginning at the origin, we draw an arrow of
length 5 units pointing to the right. From that point, we move back 2 units to the left.
The result, 3, is called the difference.

The ﬁgure above looks like the illustration for the addition problem 
. In
the problem 
, we subtracted 2 from 5. In the problem 
, we added 
(which is the opposite of 2) to 5. In each case, the result is 3.
Subtracting 2 from 5
is the same as
adding the opposite of 2 to 5.
The results are the same.

This rule indicates that subtraction is the same as adding the opposite of the
number to be subtracted. We won’t need this rule for every subtraction. For example,
is obviously 3. However, for more complicated subtractions such as 
the subtraction rule will be helpful.
To subtract

EXAMPLE 3
a. Subtract 0.5 from 4.6
b. Subtract 4.6 from 0.5
Strategy We will translate each phrase to mathematical symbols and then perform
the subtraction. We must be careful when translating the instruction to subtract one
number from another number.
WHY The order of the numbers in each word phrase must be reversed when we

Bank Promotions
To attract business, a bank gave a clock radio to each customer who opened a
checking account.The radios cost the bank $12.75 each, and 230 new accounts
were opened. Each of the 230 radios was given away at a cost of $12.75, which
can be expressed as 
.To ﬁnd how much money the promotion cost the
bank, we need to ﬁnd the product of 230 and 
.
We can multiply positive and negative numbers with a reverse-entry scientiﬁc

To ﬁnd the product of three numbers, we ﬁrst multiply two of them, and then we
multiply the third by that result. In the following example, we multiply 
in
two ways. We will use parentheses 
to show this. Recall that we perform the
operations within parentheses ﬁrst.
Method 1: Group 
and 7
Because of the parentheses, multiply 
and 7 ﬁrst.
Then multiply 
and 5.
Method 2: Group 7 and 5
Because of the parentheses, multiply 7 and 5 ﬁrst.
Then multiply 
and 35.
Either way, the product is 
, which suggests that it doesn’t matter how we group
or associate numbers in multiplication.This property is called the associative property
of multiplication.

We can now make some observations about raising a negative number to an even
power (2, 4, 6, 8, and so on) and raising a negative number to an odd power (1, 3, 5, 7,

to an even power, and the result was
positive. In part d, we raised 
to an odd power, and the result was negative. These

Use the order of operations rules.
Suppose you have been asked to contact a friend if you see a Rolex watch for sale
when you are traveling in Europe. While in Switzerland, you ﬁnd the watch and send
the text message shown on the left. The next day, you get the response shown on the
right.
Something is wrong.The ﬁrst part of the response (No price too high!) says to buy
the watch at any price.The second part (No! Price too high.) says not to buy it,because
it’s too expensive. The placement of the exclamation point makes us read the two
parts of the response differently, resulting in different meanings. When reading a
mathematical statement, the same kind of confusion is possible. For example, consider
the expression
which contains two operations:addition and multiplication.We can consider doing the
calculations in two ways. We can add ﬁrst and then multiply. Or we can multiply ﬁrst
and then add. However, we get different results.

Order of Operations
1.
Perform all calculations within parentheses and other grouping symbols
following the order listed in steps 2–4 below, working from the innermost
pair to the outermost pair.
2.
Evaluate all exponential expressions.
3.
Perform all multiplications and divisions as they occur from left to right.
4.
Perform all additions and subtractions as they occur from left to right.
When grouping symbols have been removed, repeat steps 2–4 to complete the
calculation.
If a fraction is present, evaluate the expression above and the expression
below the bar separately.Then do the division indicated by the fraction bar, if
possible.
It isn’t necessary to apply all of these steps in every problem. For example, the
expression 
does not contain any parentheses, and there are no exponential
expressions. So we look for multiplications and divisions to perform. To evaluate
correctly, we proceed as follows:
Multiply ﬁrst: 
Add.
Therefore, the correct result when evaluating 
is 20.

Find the mean (average).
The arithmetic mean (or average) of a set of numbers is a value around which the
values of the numbers are grouped.
Finding an Arithmetic Mean
To ﬁnd the mean of a set of values, divide the sum of the values by the number
of values.
EXAMPLE 13
Hotel Reservations
In an
effort 
to 
improve 
customer 
service,
a 
hotel
electronically recorded the number of times the
reservation desk telephone rang before it was answered
by a receptionist. The results of the week-long survey
are shown in the table. Find the average number of
times the phone rang before a receptionist answered.
Strategy First, we will determine the total number of
times the reservation desk telephone rang during the
week.Then we will divide that result by the total number
of calls received.
WHY To ﬁnd the average value of a set of values, we divide the sum of the values by
the number of values.
Solution
To ﬁnd the total number of rings, we multiply each number of rings (1, 2, 3, 4, and
5 rings) by the respective number of occurrences and add those subtotals.
The total number of calls received was 
To ﬁnd the
average, we divide the total number of rings by the total number of calls.

Objectives
1
Identify terms and coefﬁcients of
terms.
2
Write word phrases as algebraic
expressions.
3
Analyze problems to determine
hidden operations.
4
Evaluate algebraic expressions.
Since problems in algebra are often presented in words, the ability to interpret what
you read is important.In this section,we will introduce several strategies that will help
you translate English words into mathematical symbols.
1
Identify terms and coefﬁcients of terms.
Recall that variables and/or numbers can be combined with the operations of
arithmetic to create algebraic expressions. Addition symbols separate expressions
into parts called terms. For example, the expression 
has two terms.
8
First term
Second term
Since subtraction can be written as addition of the opposite, the expression
has three terms.

In general, a term is a product or quotient of numbers and/or variables. A single
number or variable is also a term. Examples of terms are:

Disney Theme Parks
Disneyland, located in Anaheim,
California, was in operation 16 years before the opening of Walt Disney World, in
Orlando, Florida. Euro Disney, in Paris, France, was constructed 21 years after
Disney World. Use algebraic expressions to express the ages (in years) of each of
these Disney attractions.
Strategy We start by letting represent the age of Disney World.
WHY The ages of Disneyland and Euro Disney are related to the age of Disney
World.
Solution
The ages of Disneyland and Euro Disney are both related to the age of Walt
Disney World.Therefore, we will let

In carefully reading the problem, we ﬁnd that Disneyland was built 16 years
before Disney World, so its age is more than that of Disney World.
Key phrase: more than

cylinder.To ﬁnd the capacity of the dryer,
we can ﬁnd its volume by evaluating the
algebraic expression 
, where 
represents the radius and 
represents the
height of the drum. (Here, the cylinder is
lying on its side.) If we substitute 13.5 for 
and 20 for , we obtain

EXAMPLE 14
Rocketry
If a toy rocket
is shot into the air with an initial velocity of 80 feet
per second, its height (in feet) after 
seconds in
ﬂight is given by the algebraic expression
How many seconds after the launch will it hit the
ground?
Strategy We will substitute positive values for ,
the time in ﬂight, until we ﬁnd the one that gives a
height of 0.
WHY When the toy rocket is on the ground, its height above the ground is 0.
Solution
We can substitute positive values for , the time in ﬂight, until we ﬁnd the one that
gives a height of 0.At that time, the rocket will be on the ground.We will begin by
ﬁnding the height after the rocket has been in ﬂight for 1 second 
and record
the result in a table.
Substitute 1 for 
After 1 second in ﬂight,the height of the rocket is 64 feet.We continue to pick more
values of until we ﬁnd out when the height is 0.
As we evaluate 
for various values of , we can show the results in a
table of values. In the column headed “ ,” we list each value of the variable to be
used in the evaluations. In the column headed “
,” we write the result of
each evaluation.

Simplify products.

Combine like terms.
In algebra, we often simplify algebraic expressions. To simplify an algebraic
expression, we use properties of algebra to write the expression in an equivalent, less
complicated form.
1
Simplify products.
Two properties that are often used to simplify algebraic expressions are the
associative and commutative properties of multiplication. Recall that the associative
property of multiplication enables us to change the grouping of factors involved in a
multiplication. The commutative property of multiplication enables us to change the
order of the factors.
As an example, let’s consider the expression 
and simplify it as follows:
Use the associative property of multiplication to group 4 with 8
instead of with 
Perform the multiplication within the parentheses: 
Since 
we say that 
simpliﬁes to 
To verify that

equivalent expressions (represent the same number),we can evaluate each expression

Use the distributive property.
To introduce the distributive property, we will consider the expression 
which
can be evaluated in two ways.
Method 1. Rules for the order of operations: We compute the sum within the
parentheses ﬁrst.
Perform the addition within the parentheses ﬁrst.
Perform the multiplication.
Method 2. The distributive property: We multiply both 5 and 3 by 4, and then we add
the results.
Distribute the multiplication by 4.
Perform the multiplications.
Perform the addition.
Notice that each method gives a result of 32.
We can interpret the distributive property geometrically. The ﬁgure on the next
page shows three rectangles that are divided into squares. Since the area of the
rectangle on the left-hand side of the equals sign can be found by multiplying its width
by its length, its area is 
square units. We can evaluate this expression, or we
can count squares; either way, we see that the area is 32 square units.

Automotive Service Technician
Anyone whose car has ever broken down appreciates the talents of automotive
service technicians.To work on today’s high-tech cars and trucks,a
person needs strong diagnostic and problem-solving
skills.Courses in automotive repair,electronics,physics,
chemistry,English,computers,and mathematics provide a
good educational background for a career as a service
technician.
Service technicians must be knowledgeable about the
repair and maintenance of automobiles and the fuels that
power them.In Problem 75 of Study Set 8.3, you will see
how the octane ratings of three familiar grades of gasoline,
unleaded,unleaded plus,and premium,are calculated using a
formula.

Solving Equations Using Properties of Equality
Objectives
1
Determine whether a number 
is a solution.
2
Use the addition property of
equality.
3
Use the subtraction property 
of equality.
4
Use the multiplication property
of equality.
5
Use the division property 
of equality.
In this section, we introduce four fundamental properties of equality that are used to
solve equations.
1
Determine whether a number is a solution.
An equation is a statement indicating that two expressions are equal. An example is
The equal symbol 
separates the equation into two parts: The
expression 
is the left side and 15 is the right side. The letter 
is the variable
(or the unknown). The sides of an equation can be reversed, so we can write
or 
.
• An equation can be true:
• An equation can be false:
• An equation can be neither true nor false. For example,
is neither
true nor false because we don’t know what number represents.
An equation that contains a variable is made true or false by substituting a
number for the variable. If we substitute 10 for in 
the resulting equation
is true:
If we substitute 1 for 
the resulting equation is false:
A number that makes an equation true when substituted for the variable is called a
solution and it is said to satisfy the equation.Therefore, 10 is a solution of 
and 1 is not. The solution set of an equation is the set of all numbers that make the
equation true.

It is important to know the difference between an
equation and an expression.An equation contains an 
symbol and an
expression does not.

EXAMPLE 1
Is 9 a solution of 
?
Strategy We will substitute 9 for each in the equation and evaluate the expression
on the left side and the expression on the right side separately.
WHY If a true statement results, 9 is a solution of the equation. If we obtain a false
statement, 9 is not a solution.

is false, 9 is not a solution of 3y  1  2y  7.

Use the addition property of equality.
To solve an equation means to ﬁnd all values of the variable that make the equation
true. We can develop an understanding of how to solve equations by referring to the
scales shown on the next page.

The ﬁrst scale represents the equation
The scale is in balance because the
weights on the left side and right side are equal.To
ﬁnd 
we must add 2 to the left side. To keep the
scale in balance, we must also add 2 to the right
side. After doing this, we see that 
grams is
balanced by 5 grams. Therefore,
must be 5. We
say that we have solved the equation 
and that the solution is 5.
In this example, we solved 
by
transforming it to a simpler equivalent equation,

Equivalent Equations
Equations with the same solutions are called equivalent equations.
The procedure that we used suggests the following property of equality.
Addition Property of Equality
Adding the same number to both sides of an equation does not change its
solution.
For any real numbers 
and 
if 
then a  c  b  c

When we use this property, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original one.
We will now show how it is used to solve 
algebraically.

EXAMPLE 2
Solve:
Strategy We will use a property of equality to isolate the variable on one side of the
equation.
WHY To solve the original equation, we want to ﬁnd a simpler equivalent equation
of the form 
, whose solution is obvious.
Solution
We will use the addition property of equality to isolate 
on the left side of the
equation.We can undo the subtraction of 2 by adding 2 to both sides.
This is the equation to solve.
Add 2 to both sides.
The sum of a number and its opposite is zero: 
When 0 is added to a number, the result is the same number.
Since 5 is obviously the solution of the equivalent equation 
the solution of
the original equation,
is also 5. To check this result, we substitute 5 for
in the original equation and simplify.

Use the multiplication property of equality.
The ﬁrst scale shown below represents the 
equation 
The scale is in balance because 
the weights on the left side and right side are
equal.To ﬁnd 
we must triple (multiply by 3) the
weight on the left side. To keep the scale in
balance, we must also triple the weight on the
right side. After doing this, we see that

Use more than one property of equality to solve equations.
Sometimes we must use several properties of equality to solve an equation. For
example, on the left side of 
the variable 
is multiplied by 2, and then 6
is added to that product.To isolate 
we use the order of operations rules in reverse.
First, we undo the addition of 6, and then we undo the multiplication by 2.
This is the equation to solve.
To undo the addition of 6, subtract 6 from both sides.
Do the subtractions.
To undo the multiplication by 2, divide both sides by 2.
Do the divisions.

The previous examples suggest the following strategy for solving equations. It is
important to note that not every step is needed to solve every equation.
Strategy for Solving Linear Equations in One Variable
1.
Clear the equation of fractions or decimals: Multiply both sides by the
LCD to clear fractions or multiply both sides by a power of 10 to clear
decimals.
2.
Simplify each side of the equation: Use the distributive property to
remove parentheses, and then combine like terms on each side.
3.
Isolate the variable term on one side: Add (or subtract) to get the variable
term on one side of the equation and a number on the other using the
addition (or subtraction) property of equality.
4.
Isolate the variable: Multiply (or divide) to isolate the variable using the
multiplication (or division) property of equality.

Identify identities and contradictions.
Each of the equations in Examples 1 through 8 had exactly one solution. However,
some equations have no solutions while others have inﬁnitely many solutions.

Strategy We will follow the steps of the equation-solving strategy to solve the
equation.
WHY This is the most efﬁcient way to solve a linear equation in one variable.
Solution
This is the equation to solve.
Distribute the multiplication by 3 and by 2.
Combine like terms: 
To eliminate the term 
on the right side,
subtract 
from both sides.
Combine like terms on both sides: 
In this case, the terms involving 
drop out and the result is false. This means that
any number that is substituted for 
in the original equation will give a false
statement. Since this equation has no solution, it is a contradiction.

A formula is an equation that states a relationship between two or more variables.
Formulas are used in ﬁelds such as business, science, and geometry.
1
Use formulas from business.
A formula for retail price:
To make a proﬁt, a merchant must sell an item for more
than he or she paid for it.The price at which the merchant sells the product, called the
retail price, is the sum of what the item cost the merchant plus the markup. Using to
represent the retail price,
the cost, and 
the markup, we can write this formula as
Retail price 
cost 
markup
A formula for proﬁt:
The proﬁt a business makes is the difference between
the revenue (the money it takes in) and the cost. Using 
to represent the proﬁt,
the revenue, and the cost, we can write this formula as
Proﬁt 
revenue 
cost
If we are given the values of all but one of the variables in a formula, we can use
our equation-solving skills to ﬁnd the value of the remaining variable.

Estimates 
are
that 20th Century Fox made a $309 million
proﬁt on the movie Star Wars: Revenge of the
Sith. If the studio received $424 million in
worldwide box ofﬁce revenue, ﬁnd the cost to
make and distribute the ﬁlm.(Source:www.the-
numbers.com,August 2006)
Strategy To ﬁnd the cost to make and
distribute the ﬁlm, we will substitute the given
values in the formula 
and solve for 
WHY The variable 
represents the unknown
cost.
Solution
The movie made $309 million (the proﬁt ) and
the studio took in $424 million (the revenue ).
To ﬁnd the cost 
we proceed as follows.
This is the formula for proﬁt.
Substitute 309 for and 424 for 
To eliminate 424 on the right side, subtract
424 from both sides.

A formula for simple interest:
When money is borrowed, the lender expects to be
paid back the amount of the loan plus an additional charge for the use of the money,
called interest. When money is deposited in a bank, the depositor is paid for the use of
the money.The money the deposit earns is also called interest.
Interest is computed in two ways: either as simple interest or as compound
interest. Simple interest is the product of the principal (the amount of money that is
invested, deposited, or borrowed), the annual interest rate, and the length of time in
years. Using 
to represent the simple interest,
the principal,
the annual interest
rate, and the time in years, we can write this formula as

annual interest rate is the interest rate paid per year.
EXAMPLE 2
Retirement Income
One year after investing $15,000, a
retired couple received a check for $1,125 in interest. Find the interest rate their
money earned that year.
Strategy To ﬁnd the interest rate, we will substitute the given values in the formula
and solve for 
WHY The variable represents the unknown interest rate.
Solution
The couple invested $15,000 (the principal 
) for 1 year (the time ) and made
$1,125 (the interest ).To ﬁnd the annual interest rate 
we proceed as follows.
This is the formula for simple interest.
Substitute 1,125 for 15,000 for 
and 1 for 
Simplify the right side.
To solve for 
undo the multiplication by 15,000 by dividing
both sides by 15,000.
Do the divisions.
To write 0.075 as a percent, multiply 0.075 by 100 by moving
the decimal point two places to the right and inserting a %
symbol.
The couple received an annual rate of 7.5% that year on their investment. We can

Use formulas from geometry.
To ﬁnd the perimeter of a plane (two-dimensional, ﬂat) geometric ﬁgure, such as a
rectangle or triangle, we ﬁnd the distance around the ﬁgure by computing the sum of
the lengths of its sides. Perimeter is measured in American units, such as inches, feet,
yards, and in metric units such as millimeters, meters, and kilometers.
The Language of Algebra
When you hear the word perimeter, think of the
distance around the “rim” of a ﬂat ﬁgure.

In this section, you will see that algebra is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a
wide variety of real-world problems.
Objectives
1
Apply the steps of a problem-
solving strategy.
2
Solve consecutive integer
problems.
3
Solve geometry problems.
1
Apply the steps of a problem-solving strategy.
To become a good problem solver,you need a plan to follow,such as the following ﬁve-
step strategy.
The Language of Algebra
A strategy is a careful plan or method. For
example, a businessman might develop a new advertising strategy to increase
sales or a long distance runner might have a strategy to win a marathon.
Strategy for Problem Solving
1.
Analyze the problem by reading it carefully.What information is given?
What are you asked to ﬁnd? What vocabulary is given? Often, a diagram
or table will help you visualize the facts of the problem.
2.
Form an equation by picking a variable to represent the numerical value
to be found.Then express all other unknown quantities as expressions
involving that variable. Key words or phrases can be helpful. Finally,
translate the words of the problem into an equation.
3.
Solve the equation.
4.
State the conclusion using a complete sentence. Be sure to include the
units (such as feet, seconds, or pounds) in your answer.
5.
Check the result using the original wording of the problem, not the
equation that was formed in step 2.
EXAMPLE 1
California Coastline
The ﬁrst part of California’s magniﬁcent
17-Mile Drive begins at the Paciﬁc Grove
entrance and continues to Seal Rock. It is
1 mile longer than the second part of the
drive, which extends from Seal Rock to the
Lone Cypress. The ﬁnal part of the tour
winds through the Monterey Peninsula,
eventually returning to the entrance. This
part of the drive is 1 mile longer than four
times the length of the second part. How
long is each part of 17-Mile Drive?
Analyze The drive is composed of three parts.We need to ﬁnd the length of each
part. We can straighten out the winding 17-Mile Drive and model it with a line
segment.

Paying Tuition
A college student invested the $12,000
inheritance he received and decided to use the annual interest earned to pay his
tuition cost of $945.The highest rate offered by a bank at that time was 6% annual
simple interest.At this rate,he could not earn the needed $945,so he invested some
of the money in a riskier, but more proﬁtable, investment offering a 9% return.
How much did he invest at each rate?
Analyze We know that $12,000 was invested for 1 year at two rates: 6% and 9%.
We are asked to ﬁnd the amount invested at each rate so that the total return would
be $945.

are also called nautical miles.)

In our daily lives, we often speak of one value being greater than or less than another.
For example, a sick child might have a temperature greater than
F or a granola
bar might contain less than 2 grams of fat.
In mathematics, we use inequalities to show that one expression is greater than or
is less than another expression.

An inequality can be true, false, or neither true nor false. For example,
•
is true because 
•
is false.
•
is neither true nor false because we don’t know what number 
represents.
An inequality that contains a variable can be made true or false depending on
the number that is substituted for the variable. If we substitute 10 for in 
the resulting inequality is true:
If we substitute 1 for 
the resulting
inequality is false:
A number that makes an inequality true is called a
solution of the inequality, and we say that the number satisﬁes the inequality. Thus,
10 is a solution of

to an inﬁnity symbol.

Solve linear inequalities.
To solve an inequality means to ﬁnd all values of the variable that make the
inequality true. As with equations, there are properties that we can use to solve
inequalities.
Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality
Adding the same number to, or subtracting the same number from, both sides
of an inequality does not change its solutions.

The solution set appears to be correct.
As with equations, there are properties for multiplying and dividing both sides
of an inequality by the same number. To develop what is called the multiplication
property of inequality, we consider the true statement 
If both sides are
multiplied by a positive number, such as 3, another true inequality results.
This inequality is true.
Multiply both sides by 3.
This inequality is true.
However, if we multiply both sides of 
by a negative number, such as 
the
direction of the inequality symbol is reversed to produce another true inequality.
This inequality is true.
Multiply both sides by 
and reverse the direction of the inequality.
This inequality is true.
The inequality 
is true because 
is to the right of 
on the number line.
Dividing both sides of an inequality by the same negative number also requires
that the direction of the inequality symbol be reversed.
This inequality is true.
Divide both sides by 
and change 
to 
This inequality is true.

EXAMPLE 7
Solve 
Write the solution set in
interval notation and graph it.
Strategy We will follow the steps of the equation-solving strategy (adapted to
inequalities) to solve the inequality.
WHY This is the most efﬁcient way to solve a linear inequality in one variable.
Solution
This is the inequality to solve.
Distribute the multiplication by 8 and by 2.
Combine like terms: 
To eliminate 
from the right side, subtract 
from both sides.
Combine like terms on both sides.
To isolate 
undo the addition of 8 by subtracting
8 from both sides.
Do the subtractions.
To isolate 
undo the multiplication by 5 by dividing
both sides by 5. Do not reverse the direction of the
symbol.

Solve compound inequalities.
Two inequalities can be combined into a compound inequality to show that an
expression lies between two ﬁxed values. For example,

and
It indicates that 
is greater than 
and that 
is also less than 3. The solution set of

Solution
If we replace the variable in 
with a number between 
and 0,
including 
the resulting compound inequality will be true. Therefore, the
solution set is the interval 
To graph the interval, we draw a bracket at 
a parenthesis at 0, and shade in between.

Success Tip
Note that the two inequality symbols in

To solve compound inequalities, we isolate the variable in the middle part of the
inequality. To do this, we apply the properties of inequality to all three parts of the
inequality.
EXAMPLE 9
Solve 
Write the solution set in interval
notation and graph it.
Strategy We will use properties of inequality to isolate the variable by itself as the
middle part of the inequality.
WHY To solve the original inequality, we want to ﬁnd a simpler equivalent
inequality of the form 
whose solution is obvious.
Solution
This is the compound inequality to solve.
Distribute the multiplication by 2.

Grades
A student has scores of 72%, 74%, and 78% on
three exams. What percent score does he need on the last exam to earn a grade of
no less than B (80%)?
Analyze We know three scores.We are to ﬁnd what the student must score on the
last exam to earn a grade of B or higher.
Form an Inequality We can let 
the score on the fourth (and last) exam. To
ﬁnd the average grade, we add the four scores and divide by 4. To earn a grade of
no less than B, the student’s average must be greater than or equal to 80%.
must be no less than
80
Solve
Combine like terms in the numerator: 
To clear the inequality of the fraction, multiply both sides by 4.
Simplify each side.
To isolate 
undo the addition of 224 by subtracting 224
from both sides.
State To earn a B, the student must score 96% or better on the last exam.

To solve an equation isolate the variable on one
side of the equation by undoing the operations
performed on it using properties of equality.
Addition (Subtraction) property of equality: If
the same number is added to (or subtracted
from) both sides of an equation, the result is an
equivalent equation.
Multiplication (Division) property of equality:
If both sides of an equation are multiplied (or
divided) by the same nonzero number, the
result is an equivalent equation.

Physical Therapist
Physical therapists create treatment plans that improve a patient’s ability to
move,relieve pain,and prevent or lessen physical disabilities.
Physical therapists use specialized equipment,
wheelchairs and crutches and use their own strength to
help patients work through sometimes painful exercises.
Strong communication skills and a desire to help people in
need are also important.
In Problem 50 of Study Set 9.1, you will see how physical
therapists can detect scoliosis of the human spine.
JOB TITLE:

It is often said,“A picture is worth a thousand words.”In this section,we will show how
numerical relationships can be described using mathematical pictures called graphs.
We will also show how graphs are constructed and how we can obtain information
from them.
1
Construct a rectangular coordinate system.
When designing the Gateway Arch in St.Louis,architects created a mathematical model
called a rectangular coordinate graph.This graph,shown below,is drawn on a grid called
a rectangular coordinate system. This coordinate system is also called a Cartesian
coordinate system, after the 17th-century French mathematician René Descartes.

A rectangular coordinate system is formed by two perpendicular number lines.
The horizontal number line is called the -axis, and the vertical number line is called
the -axis. On the 
, the positive direction is to the right. On the 
, the
positive direction is upward. The scale on each axis should ﬁt the data. For example,
the axes of the graph of the arch are scaled in units of 100 feet.

Success Tip
If no scale is indicated on the axes, we assume that the axes are
scaled in units of 1.
The point where the axes
intersect is called the origin. This
is the zero point on each axis.
The axes form a coordinate
plane, and they divide it into four
regions called quadrants, which
are numbered counterclockwise
using Roman numerals as shown
to the right. The axes are not
considered to be in any quadrant.
Each point in a coordinate
plane can be identiﬁed by an
ordered pair of real numbers 
and 
written in the form (x, y).

The process of locating a point in the coordinate
plane is called graphing or plotting the point. In

Strategy We will start at the origin and count to the right or left on the -axis, and
then up or down to reach each point.
WHY The right or left movement gives the -coordinate and the up or down
movement gives the -coordinate of the point.

To ﬁnd the coordinates of point 
we start at the origin, move 3 units to the right
on the -axis, and then 4 units up. The coordinates of point

Strategy We will start at the origin and move the corresponding number of units

Solution
a. Since the -coordinate,

start at the origin and move 2 units to the 
left along the -axis. Since the -coordinate,
3, is positive, we then move up 3 units and
draw a dot.The point lies in quadrant II.
b. To plot 
we begin at the origin 
and move 1 unit to the left and 
or 
units down. The point lies in quadrant III.
c. To graph 
we begin at the origin
and do not move right or left, because the
x-coordinate is 0. Since the y-coordinate is
positive, we move 2.5 units up. The point
lies on the -axis.
d. To graph 
we begin at the origin and move 4 units to the right and 2 units
up. The point lies in quadrant I.

Graph paired data.
Every day, we deal with quantities that are related:
• The time it takes to cook a turkey depends on the weight of the turkey.
• Our weight depends on how much we eat.
• The amount of water in a tub depends on how long the water has been
running.
We can use graphs to visualize such relationships. For example, suppose we know
the number of gallons of water that are in a tub at several time intervals after the water
has been turned on.We can list that information in a table.
The information in the table can be used to construct a graph that shows the
relationship between the amount of water in the tub and the time the water has been
running. Since the amount of water in the tub depends on the time, we will associate
time with the -axis and amount of water with the -axis.
y
x
At various times, the
amount of water in the tub
was measured and recorded
in the table.
Gallons
To construct the graph below we plot the four ordered pairs and draw a straight
line through the resulting data points. The -axis is scaled in larger units (4 gallons)
because the data range from 0 to 32 gallons.
From the graph, we can see that the amount of water in the tub steadily increases
as the water is allowed to run.We can also use the graph to make observations about
the amount of water in the tub at other times. For example, the dashed line on the
graph shows that in 5 minutes, the tub will contain 40 gallons of water.

Strategy We will use an ordered pair of the form (days,rental cost) to describe each

WHY The coordinates of speciﬁc points on the graph can be used to answer each of
these questions.
Solution
a. The solid dot at the end of each step indicates the rental cost for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
or 7 days. Each open circle indicates that that point is not on the graph.We
locate 2 days on the -axis and move up to locate the point on the graph
directly above the 2. Since the point has coordinates 
a 2-day rental
would cost $40.We enter this result in the table below.
b. We locate 
days on the -axis and move straight up to locate the point with 
coordinates 
which indicates that a 
rental would cost $80.
We then enter this result in the table.
c. We draw a horizontal line through the point
labeled 50 on the -axis. Since this line
intersects one step in the graph, we can look
down to the -axis to ﬁnd the -values that
correspond to a -value of 50. From the graph,
we see that the trailer can be rented for more
than 2 and up to 3 days for $50.The point has
coordinates 
. Enter the results in the

Determine whether an ordered
pair is a solution of an equation.

Complete ordered-pair solutions
of equations.

Construct a table of solutions.
4

In this section, we will discuss equations that contain two variables. These equations
are often used to describe relationships between two quantities.To see a mathematical
picture of these relationships, we will construct graphs of their equations.
1
Determine whether an ordered pair is a solution
of an equation.
We have previously solved equations in one variable. For example,
is an
equation in 
If we add 4 to both sides, we see that 
is the solution.To check this,
we replace with 7 and note that the result is a true statement:
In this chapter, we extend our equation-solving skills to ﬁnd solutions of
equations in two variables. To begin, let’s consider 
an equation in and 
A solution of 
is a pair of values, one for and one for 
that make the
equation true. For example, suppose is 5 and is 4.Then we have:
This is the original equation.
Substitute 5 for and 4 for 
True
Since 
is a true statement, the ordered pair 
is a solution, and we say that
satisﬁes the equation. In general, a solution of an equation in two variables is an
ordered pair of numbers that makes the equation a true statement.

Graph equations by plotting points.
To graph the equation 
we plot the ordered pairs listed in the table of
solutions on a rectangular coordinate system, as shown in ﬁgure (a). We can see that
the ﬁve points lie on a line.
We then draw a line through the points, because the graph of any solution of
will lie on this line.The arrowheads show that the line continues forever in
both directions.The line is a picture of all the solutions of the equation 
This
line is called the graph of the equation. See ﬁgure (b).

Using Your CALCULATOR
Using a
Graphing Calculator to Graph an Equation
We have graphed equations by making tables
of solutions and plotting points.The task of
graphing is much easier when we use a
graphing calculator.The instructions in this
discussion will be general in nature. For
speciﬁc details about your calculator, please
consult your owner’s manual.

All graphing calculators have a viewing
window, used to display graphs.The standard
window has settings of
which indicate that the minimum - and -coordinates used in the graph will
be 
and that the maximum - and -coordinates will be 10.
Graphing an equation
To graph the equation 
using a graphing calculator, we press the 
key and enter the right-hand side of the equation after the symbol 
The display will show the equation
Then we press the 
key to produce the graph in ﬁgure (a) shown on
the next page.
Next, we will graph the equation 
Since absolute values are always
nonnegative, the minimum -value is zero.To obtain a reasonable viewing 
window, we press the 
key and set the Ymin value slightly lower,
at 
We set Ymax to be 10 units greater than Ymin, at 
The minimum value of occurs when 
To center the graph in the
viewing window, we set the Xmin and Xmax values 5 units to the left and right
of 4.Therefore,
and 
After entering the right-hand side of the equation, we obtain the graph in

Changing the viewing window:
The choice of viewing windows is extremely important when graphing
equations.To show this, let’s graph 
with -values from 
to 6 and
-values from 
to 5.
To graph this equation, we set the and window values and enter the right-
hand side of the equation.The display will show
Then we press the 
key to produce the graph shown in ﬁgure (c).
Although the graph appears to be a straight line, it is not.Actually, we are
seeing only part of a parabola. If we pick a viewing window with -values of
to 6 and -values of 
to 2, as in ﬁgure (d), we can see that the graph is a
parabola.

Graph equations that use different variables.
We will often encounter equations with variables other than and 
When we make
tables of solutions and graph these equations, we must know which is the
independent variable (the input values) and which is the dependent variable (the
output values). The independent variable is usually associated with the horizontal
axis of the coordinate system, and the dependent variable is usually associated with
the vertical axis.

Speed Limits
In some states, the maximum speed limit on
a U.S. interstate highway is 75 mph. The distance covered by a vehicle traveling at
75 mph depends on the time the vehicle travels at that speed. This relationship is
described by the equation 
where 
represents the distance (in miles) and
represents the time (in hours). Graph the equation.
Strategy We will ﬁnd several solutions of the equation, plot them on a rectangular
coordinate system, and then draw a graph passing through the points.
WHY We can use the graph to estimate the distance traveled
(in miles) after traveling an amount of time at 75 mph.
Solution
Since 
depends on 
in the equation 
t is the
independent variable (the input) and 
is the dependent
variable (the output). Therefore, we choose values for

satisfy the equation are listed in the table of solutions shown below. If we plot the

Graph linear equations by plotting points.
It is impossible to list the inﬁnitely many solutions of a linear equation. However, to
show all of its solutions, we can draw a mathematical “picture” of them. We call this
picture the graph of the equation.

Find three pairs 
that satisfy the equation by picking arbitrary
numbers for and ﬁnding the corresponding values of 
2.
Plot each resulting pair 
on a rectangular coordinate system. If the
three points do not lie on a straight line, check your computations.

Success Tip
Since two points determine a line, only two points are needed to
graph a linear equation. However, we will often plot a third point as a check. If
the three points do not lie on a straight line, then at least one of them is in
error.
EXAMPLE 4
Graph:
Strategy We will use properties of equality to solve the given equation for 
Then
we will use the point-plotting method of this section to graph the resulting equivalent
equation.
WHY The calculations to ﬁnd several solutions of a linear equation in two variables
are usually easier when the equation is solved for 
Solution
To solve for 
we undo the multiplication of 2 by dividing both sides by 2.
On the right-hand side, dividing each term by 2 is equivalent to dividing
the entire side by 2:

Use graphs of linear equations to solve applied problems.
EXAMPLE 8
Birthday Parties
A restaurant offers a party package
that includes food, drinks, cake, and party favors for a cost of $25 plus $3 per child.
Write a linear equation that will give the cost for a party of any size, and then graph
the equation.
Strategy We will form an equation and use the plotting points method to graph the
equation.
WHY The graph is a picture of all the solutions of the equation.
Solution
We can let 
represent the cost of the party. The cost 
is the sum of the basic
charge of $25 and the cost per child times the number of children attending. If
the number of children attending is 
at $3 per child, the total cost for the children
is 
is
plus
times
25
3
For the equation 
the independent variable (input) is 
the
number of children.The dependent variable (output) is 
the cost of the party.We
will ﬁnd three points on the graph of the equation by choosing -values of 0, 5, and
10 and ﬁnding the corresponding -values.The results are shown in the table.
If
If
If
Next, we graph the points and
draw a line through them. We don’t
draw an arrowhead on the left,
because it doesn’t make sense to have
a negative number of children attend a
party. Note that the -axis is scaled in
units of $5 to accommodate costs
ranging from $0 to $65.We can use the
graph to determine the cost of a party
of any size. For example, to ﬁnd the
cost of a party with 8 children, we
locate 8 on the horizontal axis and
then move up to ﬁnd a point on the
graph directly above the 8. Since the
coordinates of that point are 
the cost for 8 children would be $49.

Rate of Change and the Slope of a Line
787
Since our world is one of constant change, we must be able to describe change so that
we can plan for the future. In this section, we will show how to describe the amount of
change of one quantity in relation to the amount of change of another quantity by
ﬁnding a rate of change.

Find rates of change.
The line graph in ﬁgure (a) below shows the number of business permits issued each
month by a city over a 12-month period. From the shape of the graph, we can see that
the number of permits issued increased each month.
For situations such as the one graphed in (a), it is often useful to calculate a rate
of increase (called a rate of change).We do so by ﬁnding the ratio of the change in the
number of business permits issued each month to the number of months over which
that change took place.

Rate of Change and the Slope of a Line
789
2
Find the slope of a line from its graph.
The slope of a nonvertical line is a number that measures the line’s steepness.We can
calculate the slope by picking two points on the line and writing the ratio of the
vertical change (called the rise) to the corresponding horizontal change (called the
run) as we move from one point to the other.As an example, we will ﬁnd the slope of
the line that was used to describe the number of building permits issued and show that
it gives the rate of change.
In the following ﬁgure, the line passes through points 
and 
Moving along the line from point 
to point 
causes the value of 
to change from
to 
an increase of 
units.We say that the rise is 36.

This is the same value we obtained when we found the rate of change of the
number of business permits issued over the 12-month period.Therefore,by ﬁnding the

Strategy We will pick two points on the line, construct a slope triangle, and ﬁnd the
rise and the run.Then we will write the ratio of the rise to the run.
WHY The slope of a line is the ratio of the rise to the run.
Solution
We begin by choosing two points on the line—call them 
and 
—as shown in
ﬁgure (b).One way to move from point 
to point 
is to start at point 
and count
downward 3 grid squares. Because this movement is downward, the rise is 
Then, moving right, we count 6 grid squares to reach .This indicates a run of 6.To
ﬁnd the slope of the line, we write a ratio of rise to run in simpliﬁed form. Usually
the letter 
is used to denote slope, so we have
The slope of a line is the ratio of the rise to the run.
From the slope triangle, the rise is 
and the run is 6.
Simplify the fraction.

Success Tip
The answers from Example 2 and the Self Check illustrate an
important fact about slope: The same value for the slope of a line will result no
matter which two points on the line are used to determine the rise and the run.

Find the slope of a line given two points.
We can generalize the graphic method for ﬁnding slope to develop a slope formula.To
begin, we select points 
and 
on the line shown in the ﬁgure below. To distinguish
between the coordinates of these points, we use subscript notation. Point 
has
coordinates 
, which are read as “ sub 1 and 
sub 1.” Point 
has coordinates
, which are read as “ sub 2 and sub 2.”

Use slope to graph a line.
We can graph a line whenever we know the
coordinates of one point on the line and the slope
of the line. For example, to graph the line that
passes through 
and has a slope of 3, we ﬁrst
plot 
as in the ﬁgure. We can express the 
slope of 3 as a fraction:
Therefore, the line 
rises 3 units for every 1 unit it runs to the right.We
can ﬁnd a second point on the line by starting at
and moving 3 units up (rise) and 1 unit to the
right (run).This brings us to a point that we will call
with coordinates

Graph the line that passes through the point 
with 
slope 
Strategy We will plot the given point and identify the rise and the run of the slope.
Then we will start at the plotted point and ﬁnd a second point on the line by forming
a slope triangle.
WHY Once we locate two points on the line, we can draw the graph of the line.
Solution
We plot the point 
as shown in the
ﬁgure to the right. Then, after writing the 
slope 
as 
we see that the rise is 
and 
the run is 5. From the point 
we can
ﬁnd a second point on the line by moving
2 units down (rise) and then 5 units right
(run). (A rise of 
means to move down
2 units.) This brings us to the point with

We then draw a line
that passes through the two points.

EXAMPLE 5
Limo Service
On weekends, a limousine service charges a
fee of $100,plus 
per mile,for the rental of a stretch limo.Write a linear equation
that describes the relationship between the rental cost and the number of miles
driven. Graph the result.
Strategy We will determine the slope and the -intercept of the graph of the
equation from the given facts about the limo service.
WHY If we know the slope and -intercept, we can use the slope–intercept form,
to write the equation to model the situation.
Solution
To write an equation describing this relationship, we will let 
represent the
number of miles driven and 
represent the cost (in dollars). We can make two
observations:
• The cost increases by 
or $0.50 for each mile driven.This is the rate of
change of the rental cost to miles driven, and it will be the slope of the
graph of the equation.Thus,
• The basic fee is $100. Before driving any miles (that is, when 
), the
cost is 100.The ordered pair 
will be the -intercept of the graph
of the equation. So we know that b  100.

Write an equation of the line passing through 
and
Strategy We will use the point–slope form,
to write an
equation of the line.
WHY We can calculate the slope of the line using the coordinates of the two points
given and the slope formula. We also know the coordinates of a point that the line
passes through (we can choose either point).
Solution
First we ﬁnd the slope of the line that passes through 
and 
This is the slope formula.
Substitute

describes the relationship between the time the cooler has been running and the
temperature in the car.
Graph the equation and use it to ﬁnd the temperature in the car before the
cooler was turned on and the temperature in the car after the cooler had run for
25 minutes.
Strategy We will determine the slope and a point of the graph from the given facts
about the refrigeration unit.
WHY If we know the slope and a point, we can use the point–slope form,
to write the equation to model the situation.

• With the cooler on, the temperature in the railroad car drops 
every 
5 minutes.The rate of change of 
degrees per minute is the slope of the 
graph of the linear equation that we want to ﬁnd.Thus,
• We know that after the cooler had been running for 10 minutes 
the temperature in the car was 
We can express these facts
with the ordered pair 
This is a point on the graph of the linear
equation.
To write the linear equation, we substitute 
for 
10 for 
and 76 for 
into the point–slope form of the equation of a line.
This is the point–slope form.
Substitute:

This
is given by the -intercept of the graph,
If we locate 25 on the

WHY The graph of a linear inequality in two variables is a region of the coordinate
plane on one side of the boundary line.
Solution
To graph the inequality 
we graph the boundary line whose equation is
Since the graph of 
includes the line 
we draw the
boundary with a solid line. See ﬁgure (a) below. Note that it divides the coordinate
plane into two half-planes.
To decide which half-plane to shade, we substitute the coordinates of some
point that lies on one side of the boundary line into the inequality. If we use the
origin 
for the test point, we have
Substitute 0 for and 0 for 
This is false.
Since 
is a false statement, the origin is not in the graph. In fact, the
coordinates of every point on the origin’s side of the boundary line will not satisfy
the inequality. However, every point on the other side of the boundary line
will satisfy the inequality. We shade that half-plane. The graph of

half-plane that appears in color in ﬁgure (b).

The following is a summary of the procedure for graphing linear inequalities.
Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables
1.
Replace the inequality symbol with an equal symbol 
and graph the
boundary line of the region. If the inequality allows the possibility of
equality (the symbol is either 
or 
), draw the boundary line as a solid
line. If equality is not allowed (
or 
), draw the boundary line as a
dashed line.
2.
Pick a test point that is on one side of the boundary line. (Use the origin if
possible.) Replace and in the inequality with the coordinates of that
point. If the inequality is satisﬁed, shade the side that contains that point.
If the inequality is not satisﬁed, shade the other side of the boundary.

A set of ordered pairs, such as this, is called a relation. The set of all ﬁrst
components is called the domain of the relation and the set of all second components
is called the range of a relation.

In everyday life, we see a wide variety of situations where one quantity depends on
another:
• The distance traveled by a car depends on its speed.
• The cost of renting a video depends on the number of days it is rented.
• A state’s number of representatives in Congress depends on the state’s
population.
We will discuss many situations where one quantity depends on another
according to a speciﬁc rule, called a function. For example, the equation 
sets up a rule where each value of depends on the choice of some number 
The rule
is:To ﬁnd 
double the value of and subtract 3.In this case,

Notice that for each year, there corresponds exactly one medal count.That is, this
relation assigns to each member of the domain exactly one member of the range.
Two observations can be made about these examples:
• Each one establishes a relationship between two sets of values. For example,
the number of bicycle tires that must be ordered depends on the number of
bicycles to be manufactured.
• In these relationships, each value in one set is assigned a single value of a
second set. For example, for each number of bicycles to be manufactured,
there is exactly one number of tires to order.
Relationships between two quantities that exhibit both of these characteristics are
called functions.
Functions
A function is a set of ordered pairs (a relation) in which to each ﬁrst
component there corresponds exactly one second component.
Using the variables and 
we can restate the previous deﬁnition as follows:
y,

y Is a Function of x
For to be a function of 
each value of must determine exactly one value
of y.

WHY If this is true, the equation, table, or arrow diagram deﬁnes to be a function
of 
Solution
a. For each value of the independent variable 
we apply the rule: Multiply by
4 and add 1. Since this arithmetic gives a single value of the dependent
variable 
the equation deﬁnes a function.
b. Since the table assigns two different values of 
3 and 7, to the -value of 5, it
does not deﬁne as a function of 
c. Each value of is assigned to one value of :

We have seen that functions can be represented by equations in two variables. Some
examples of functions are
For a function, the set of all possible values of the independent variable (the inputs) is
called the domain of the function. The set of all possible values of the dependent
variable (the outputs) is called the range of the function.

EXAMPLE 3
Find the domain and range of 
Strategy We will determine which real numbers are allowable inputs for 
for the
domain.Then we will determine which real numbers are possible outputs of for the
range.
WHY The domain is the set of all possible values of the input variable,and the range
is the set of all possible values of the output variable.
Solution
To ﬁnd the domain of 
we determine which real numbers are allowable
inputs for 
Since we can ﬁnd the absolute value of any real number, the domain is
the set of all real numbers. Since the absolute value of any real number is greater
than or equal to zero, the range of 
is the set of all real numbers greater than
or equal to zero.

A function is a set of ordered pairs in which to
each ﬁrst component there corresponds exactly
one second component.
For a function, the set of all possible values of
the independent variable 
(the inputs) is
called the domain.
The set of all possible values of the dependent
variable (the outputs) is called the range.

Since can be any real number in the function 
the domain is
the set of real numbers.
Because of the absolute value in the function 
must be either

Air Trafﬁc Controller
The air trafﬁc control system is a vast network of people and equipment that
ensures the safe operation of commercial and private aircraft.Air
trafﬁc controllers coordinate the movement of air trafﬁc
to make certain that planes stay a safe distance apart.
Their immediate concern is safety,but controllers also
must direct planes efﬁciently to minimize delays.Some
regulate airport trafﬁc and others regulate airport arrivals
and departures.
In Problem 73 of Study Set 10.1, you will see one way that
air trafﬁc controllers can guard against an air collision.
JOB TITLE:
Air Trafﬁc Controller
EDUCATION: Completion of an FAA-approved
program,a passing score on an FAA-
authorized pre-employment test,and a
thorough medical exam are required.
JOB OUTLOOK: Employment is expected to
grow 10% through the year 2016.
ANNUAL EARNINGS: In 2006,salaries ranged
from $86,860 to $142,210.

The following illustration shows the average amounts of chicken and beef eaten per
person each year in the United States from 1985 to 2005. Plotting both graphs on the
same coordinate system makes it easy to compare recent trends. The point of inter-
section of the graphs indicates that Americans ate equal amounts of chicken and beef
in 1992—about 66 pounds of each, per person.
In this section, we will use a similar graphical approach to solve systems of
equations.

We have previously discussed equations in two variables, such as 
Because
there are inﬁnitely many pairs of numbers whose sum is 3, there are inﬁnitely many
pairs 
that satisfy this equation. Some of these pairs are listed in table (a).
Now consider the equation 
Because there are inﬁnitely many pairs of
numbers whose difference is 1, there are inﬁnitely many pairs

When two equations with the same variables are considered simultaneously (at
the same time), we say that they form a system of equations. Using a left brace 
we
can write the equations from the previous example as a system:
Read as “the system of equations 
and 
”
Because the ordered pair 
satisﬁes both of these equations, it is called a solu-
tion of the system. In general, a system of linear equations can have exactly one solu-
tion, no solution, or inﬁnitely many solutions.

When the graphs of two equations in a system are different lines, the equations
are called independent equations. When a system of equations has a solution, the sys-
tem is called a consistent system.
To solve a system of equations in two variables by graphing,we follow these steps.
The Graphing Method
1.
Carefully graph each equation on the same rectangular coordinate 
system.
2.
If the lines intersect, determine the coordinates of the point of intersec-
tion of the graphs.The ordered pair is the solution of the system.
3.
Check the proposed solution in the equations of the original system.

WHY Recall that the graph of a linear equation is a “picture” of its solutions. It is
easier to graph equations that have integer coefﬁcients. If both equations are
graphed on the same coordinate system, we can see whether they have any
common solutions.
Solution
We can multiply both sides of the ﬁrst equation by 2 to clear it of fractions.
(1)
We will call this Equation 1.
We then multiply both sides of the second equation by 6 to clear it of fractions.
(2)
We will call this Equation 2.
Equations 1 and 2 form the following equivalent system, which has the same
solutions as the original system:
We graph 
by plotting the -intercept 
and then drawing a slope
of 
We graph 
using the intercept method. It appears that the

A check will show that when the coordinates of

independent and the system is consistent.

Identify the number of solutions of a linear system
without graphing.
We can determine the number of solutions that a system of two linear equations has
by writing each equation in slope–intercept form.
• If the lines have different slopes, they intersect, and the system has one
solution. (See Example 2.)
• If the lines have the same slope and different -intercepts, they are parallel,
and the system has no solution. (See Example 4.)
• If the lines have the same slope and same -intercept, they are the same line,
and the system has inﬁnitely many solutions. (See Example 5.)

VOCABULARY
Fill in the blanks.
1. The pair of equations 
is called a 
of equations.
2. Because the ordered pair 
satisﬁes both
equations in Problem 1, it is called a 
of the
system of equations.
3. When the graphs of two equations in a system are
different lines, the equations are called 
equations.
4. When a system of equations has a solution, the
system is called a 
system.
5. Systems of equations that have no solution are called
systems.
6. Equations that have the same graph are called
equations.

When solving a system of equations by graphing, it is often difﬁcult to determine the 
exact coordinates of the point of intersection. For example, a solution of 
would be almost impossible to identify. In this section, we will introduce an algebraic
method that ﬁnds exact solutions. It is called the substitution method.

Solve systems of linear equations by substitution.
One algebraic method for solving a system of equations is the substitution method. It
is introduced in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve the system:
Strategy Note that the ﬁrst equation is solved for 
Because 
and 
are
equal (represent the same value), we will substitute 
for 
in the second
equation.
WHY The objective is to obtain one equation containing only one unknown.When
is substituted for 
in the second equation, the result will be just that—an
equation in one variable,
Solution
Since the right side of 
is used to make a substitution,
is
called the substitution equation.
To ﬁnd the solution of the system, we proceed as follows:
This is the second equation of the system.
Substitute 
for 
The resulting equation has only one variable and can be solved for 
Combine like terms: 
Add 2 to both sides.
Divide both sides by 5. This is the -value of the solution.
We can ﬁnd the -value by substituting 2 for in either equation of the original sys-
tem. Because 
is already solved for 
it is easier to substitute into this
equation.
This is the ﬁrst equation of the system.
Substitute 2 for 
This is the -value of the solution. We would have obtained the same
result if we had substituted 2 for in 
and solved for 
The solution to the given system is 
To check, we substitute 2 for 
and 4 for
in each equation.

Caution!
When using the substitution method, a common error is to ﬁnd the
value of one of the variables, say 
and forget to ﬁnd the value of the other.
Remember that a solution of a linear system of two equations is an ordered
pair (x, y).

Solve systems of linear equations that contain 
fractions.
It is usually helpful to clear any equations of fractions and combine any like terms
before performing a substitution.
EXAMPLE 5
Solve the system:
μ
Strategy We will use properties of algebra to write each equation of the system
in simpler form. Then we will use the substitution method to solve the resulting
equivalent system.
WHY The ﬁrst equation will be easier to work with if we clear it of fractions. The
second equation will be easier to work with if we eliminate the variable terms on
the right side.
Solution
We begin by clearing the ﬁrst equation of fractions by multiplying both sides by the
LCD.
Multiply both sides by the LCD, which is 4.
We can write the second equation in general form 
by adding and
subtracting from both sides.
Combine like terms.
The two results form the following equivalent system, which has the same solution
as the original one.
Step 1 To solve this system, we solve Equation 1 for 
Subtract 
from both sides.

Strategy We will use properties of algebra to write the ﬁrst equation of the system

57. Explain how to use substitution to solve a system of
equations.
In step 1 of the substitution method for solving a system of equations, we solve one
equation for one of the variables. At times, this can be difﬁcult—especially if neither
variable has a coefﬁcient of 1 or 
In cases such as these, we can use another alge-
braic method called the addition or elimination method to ﬁnd the exact solution of
the system. This method is based on the addition property of equality: When equal
quantities are added to both sides of an equation, the results are equal.

Determine the most efﬁcient method to use to solve
a linear system.
If no method is speciﬁed for solving a particular linear system,the following guidelines
can be helpful in determining whether to use graphing, substitution, or addition.
1.
If you want to show trends and see the point that the two graphs have in
common, then use the graphing method. However, this method is not exact and
can be lengthy.
2.
If one of the equations is solved for one of the variables, or easily solved for one
of the variables, use the substitution method.
3.
If both equations are in general (standard) 
form, and no variable
has a coefﬁcient of 1 or 
use the addition method.
4.
If the coefﬁcient of one of the variables is 1 or 
you have a choice.You can
write each equation in general (standard) 
form and use addition,
or you can solve for the variable with coefﬁcient 1 or 
and use substitution.
Here are some examples of suggested approaches:
Substitution

Each method that we use to solve systems of equations has advantages and disadvantages.

What are you asked to ﬁnd? What vocabulary is given? Often a diagram
or table will help you visualize the facts of the problem.
2.
Form two equations by picking two different variables to represent two
unknown quantities.This will give a system of two equations in two
variables.
3.
Solve the system of equations using the most convenient method:
graphing, substitution, or addition.
4.
State the conclusion using a complete sentence. Be sure to include the
units (such as feet, seconds, or pounds) in your answer.
5.
Check the result in the words of the problem.

The setup cost of a machine that mills
brass plates is $750. After setup, it costs $0.25 to mill each plate. Management is
considering the purchase of a larger machine that can produce the same plate at a
cost of $0.20 per plate. If the setup cost of the larger machine is $1,200, how many
plates would the company have to produce to make the purchase worthwhile?
Analyze We need to ﬁnd the number of plates (called the break point) that will
cost equal amounts to produce on either machine.

Divide both sides by 0.05.
State If 9,000 plates are milled,the cost will be the same on either machine.If more
than 9,000 plates are milled, the cost will be cheaper on the larger machine, because
it mills the plates less expensively than the smaller machine.

Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities
Objectives
1
Solve a system of linear
inequalities by graphing.
2
Use graphing to identify systems
of inequalities with no solutions.
3
Solve application problems
involving systems of linear
inequalities.
In Section 10.1, we solved systems of linear equations by the graphing method. The
solution of such a system is the point of intersection of the straight lines. We now
consider how to solve systems of linear inequalities graphically. When the solution of
a linear inequality is graphed, the result is a half-plane.Therefore, we would expect to
ﬁnd the graphical solution of a system of inequalities by looking for the intersection,
or overlap, of shaded half-planes.

Solve a system of linear inequalities by graphing.
EXAMPLE 1
Graph the solutions of the system:
Strategy We will graph the solutions of 
in one color and the solutions
of 
in another color on the same coordinate system.
WHY We need to see where the graphs of the two inequalities intersect (overlap).
Solution
We ﬁrst graph each inequality. For this ﬁrst example, we will graph each inequality
on a separate set of axes, although in practice we will draw them on the same axes.
To graph 
we begin by graphing the boundary line 
Since
the inequality contains an
symbol,the boundary is a solid line.Because the coor-
dinates of the test point 
do not satisfy 
we shade (in red) the side
of the boundary that does not contain

The Language of Algebra
To solve a system of linear inequalities we
superimpose the graphs of the inequalities.That is, we place one graph on top
of the other. Most cameras superimpose the date and time over the picture.

least one of the inequalities.

Solving Systems of Inequalities
1.
Graph each inequality on the same rectangular coordinate system.
2.
Use shading to highlight the intersection of the graphs (the region where the
graphs overlap).The points in this region are the solutions of the system.
3.
As an informal check, pick a test point from the region where the graphs
intersect, and verify that its coordinates satisfy each inequality of the
original system.

A solution of a system of equations in two
variables is an ordered pair that satisﬁes both
equations of the system.
To solve a system graphically:
1.
Graph each equation on the same
rectangular coordinate system.
2.
If the lines intersect, determine the
coordinates of the point of intersection of
the graphs.This ordered pair is the solution.
3.
Check the proposed solution in each
equation of the original system.
Use graphing to solve the system:
Step 1 Graph each equation as shown below.
e y  2x  3
x  2y  4
A system of equations that has at least one
solution is called a consistent system. If the
graphs of the equations of the system are
parallel lines, the system has no solution and is
called an inconsistent system.
Equations with different graphs are called
independent equations. If the graphs of the
equations in a system are the same line, the
system has inﬁnitely many solutions. The
equations are called dependent equations.
We can determine the number of solutions
that a system of two linear equations has by
writing each equation in slope-intercept form,
and comparing the slopes and 
-intercepts.

If an exponent is a natural number, it tells how many times its base is to be used
as a factor.An exponent of 1 indicates that its base is to be used one time as a factor,
an exponent of 2 indicates that its base is to be used two times as a factor, and so on.
The base of an exponential expression can be a number, a variable, or a combination
of numbers and variables.

one exponent.
Use the product rule for exponents: Keep the common base, which
is 9, and add the exponents.

“According to a Student Monitor LLC survey,ATM debit card ownership among
college students has almost doubled from 30 percent to 57 percent in the past four
years.”
BYU Newsletter,Oct 2002
In 2002, there were 13.9 billion ATM transactions in the United States. On
average, that’s more than 38 million a day! Before each transaction, the card
owner is required to enter his or her PIN (personal identiﬁcation number).
When an ATM card is issued, many ﬁnancial institutions have the applicant
select a four-digit PIN.There are 10 possible choices for the ﬁrst digit of the
PIN, 10 possible choices for the second digit, and so on.Write the total number
of possible choices of a PIN as an exponential expression.Then evaluate the
expression.

Success Tip
Sometimes more than one rule for exponents is needed to
simplify an expression.
It is important to pay close attention to the operation between the exponential
expressions and then use the appropriate rules. To add or subtract exponential
expressions, they must be like terms. To multiply or divide exponential expressions,
only the bases need to be the same.
The operation is addition and these are not like terms because the
exponents are different. We cannot simplify the expression any further.
The operation is addition and these are like terms. We can simplify the
expression by adding the numerical coefﬁcients and keeping the variable
expression.
The operation is multiplication and the bases are the same. We keep the
base and add the exponents.
The operation is division and the bases are the same. We keep the base
and subtract the exponents. An exponent of 1 need not be written.

Objectives
1
Use the zero exponent rule.
2
Use the negative integer
exponent rule.
3
Use exponent rules to write
equivalent expressions with
positive exponents.
4
Use all exponent rules to simplify
expressions.
5
Use exponent rules with variable

1
Use the zero exponent rule.
When we discussed the quotient rule for exponents in the previous section, the
exponent in the numerator was always greater than the exponent in the denominator.
We now consider what happens when the exponents are equal. To develop the 
deﬁnition of a zero exponent, we will simplify the expression 
in two ways and 
compare the results. If we use the quotient rule for exponents, where the exponents in
the numerator and denominator are equal, we obtain 
However, by removing the
common factors of 5, we obtain 1.
These must be equal.

Using Your CALCULATOR
Finding Present Value
As a gift for their newborn grandson, the grandparents want to deposit enough
money in the bank now so that when he turns 18, the young man will have a
college fund of $20,000 waiting for him. How much should they deposit now if
the money will earn 6% annually?
To ﬁnd how much money 
must be invested at an annual rate (expressed as
a decimal) to have 
in 
years, we use the formula

150,000,000
Strategy We will write the number as a product of a number between 1 and 10

WHY Numbers written in scientiﬁc notation have the form 
Solution
We note that 1.5 lies between 1 and 10.To obtain 150,000,000, the decimal point in
1.5 must be moved eight places to the right.
1 . 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 places to the right
Because multiplying a number by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the
right, we can accomplish this by multiplying 1.5 by 10 eight times.We can show the
multiplication of 1.5 by 10 eight times using the notation 
Thus, 150,000,000
written in scientiﬁc notation is 1.5  108.

WHY Numbers written in scientiﬁc notation have the form 
Solution
We note that 2.56 is between 1 and 10. To obtain 0.00000256, the decimal point in
2.56 must be moved six places to the left.
0 0 0 0 0 2 . 56
6 places to the left

“The number of U.S.college students earning degrees in science,technology,
engineering,and math has fallen over the last 15 years.What a better way to hook
our children than with a new space exploration plan?”
Patricia Arnold,Space Foundation,2004
It has been almost 40 years since a U.S. astronaut last walked on the moon.
Many educators feel that manned ﬂights to the moon and Mars would ignite a
passion for space and science studies among young people. However, the
minimum distance Mars is from Earth is 135 times further than the moon is
from Earth.Traveling such a long way poses many problems. If the average
distance from Earth to the moon is about 
miles, what is the distance
between Earth and Mars? Express the result in scientiﬁc notation.

one variable,
A single number is called a constant, and so its last term, 2, is called
the constant term.
Since

Because each term of a polynomial is a monomial, we deﬁne the degree of a poly-
nomial by considering the degrees of each of its terms.
Degree of a Polynomial
The degree of a polynomial is determined by the term with the largest degree.
Here are some examples:
•
is a binomial of degree 2, because the degree of its ﬁrst term is 2 and
the degree of its second term is less than 2.
•
is a trinomial of degree 3, because the degree of its second
term is 3 and the degree of each of its other terms is less than 3.
•
is a polynomial of degree 18, because its
second and third terms are of degree 18. Its other terms have degree less
than 18.

Caution!
When combining like terms, the exponents on the variables stay the
same. Don’t incorrectly add the exponents.
Success Tip
When performing operations on polynomials, we usually write
the terms of the solution in decreasing (or descending) powers of one variable.

Subtract polynomials.
Because of the distributive property, we can remove parentheses enclosing several
terms when the sign preceding the parentheses is a 
sign.We simply drop the minus
sign and the parentheses, and change the sign of every term within the parentheses.
This suggests that the way to subtract polynomials is to remove parentheses, change
the sign of each term of the second polynomial, and combine like terms.

Dimensions of a Painting
A square painting is
surrounded by a border 2 inches wide. If the area of the border is 96 square inches,
ﬁnd the dimensions of the painting.
Analyze Refer to the ﬁgure, which shows a square painting surrounded by a
border 2 inches wide.We know that the area of this border is 96 square inches, and
we are to ﬁnd the dimensions of the painting.
Form Let 
the length of a side of the square
painting. Since the border is 2 inches wide, the
length and the width of the outer rectangle
are both 
inches. Then the outer
rectangle is also a square, and its dimensions are
by 
inches. Since the area of a
square is the product of its length and width, the
area of the larger square is 
and
the area of the painting is 
If we subtract the
area of the painting from the area of the larger
square, the difference is 96.

Divide a polynomial by a monomial.
In Section 3.4, we used the following rules to add and subtract fractions that have the
same denominator.
Adding and Subtracting Fractions That Have the Same Denominator
To add (or subtract) fractions that have the same denominator, we add (or
subtract) their numerators and keep the common denominator. In symbols, if 
and 
represent numbers, and 
is not 0,

written in descending powers of the variable. This means that the term involving the
highest power of 
appears ﬁrst, the term involving the second-highest power of 
appears second, and so on. For example, the terms in
have their exponents written in descending order.
If the powers in the dividend or divisor are not in descending order, we use the
commutative property of addition to write them that way.

Divide polynomials that are missing terms.
When we write the terms of a dividend in descending powers of

whether some powers of the variable are missing.When this happens, we should write
such terms with a coefﬁcient of 0 or leave a blank space for them.

While preparing for the Chapter 11 exam, it is important to keep the following checklist in mind.
Put a checkmark in the box if you can answer “yes” to the statement.
 I know that to divide a polynomial by a monomial,
I do not use long division. I divide each term of the
polynomial by the monomial in the denominator.
I then simplify each fraction.

power is 1.
 I know that to multiply a monomial to a
polynomial, I use the distributive property.
 I know that the square of a binomial is a trinomial.
A common error when squaring a binomial is to
forget the middle term of the product.

Elementary School Teacher
It has been said that a teacher takes a hand,opens a mind,and touches a heart.
That is certainly true for the thousands of dedicated elementary
school teachers across the country.Elementary school
teachers use their training in mathematics in many ways.
Besides teaching math on a daily basis,they calculate
student grades,analyze test results,and order instructional
materials and supplies.They use measurement and
geometry for designing bulletin board displays and they
construct detailed schedules so that the classroom time is
used wisely.
In Problem 28 of Study Set 12.8, you will determine the
maximum dimensions of a bulletin board so that it meets the
ﬁre code requirements of an elementary school classroom.

Factor by grouping.
Recall that in Chapter 11 we used the distributive property to multiply a monomial
and a binomial. For example,
In this section, we will reverse the operation of multiplication. Given a polynomial
such as 
we will ask,“What factors were multiplied to obtain 
?”
The process of ﬁnding the factors of a known product is called factoring.
Multiplication: Given the factors, we ﬁnd the polynomial. 
Factoring: Given a polynomial, we ﬁnd the factors.
To factor a polynomial means to express it as a product of two (or more)
polynomials. The ﬁrst step when factoring a polynomial is to determine whether its
terms have any common factors.

Find the greatest common factor of a list of terms.
To determine whether two or more integers have common factors, it is helpful to
write them as a product of prime numbers. For example, the prime factorizations of
90 and 42 are given below.
The color highlighting indicates that 90 and 42 have one prime factor of 2 and one
prime factor of 3 in common. We can conclude that 
is the largest natural
number that divides 90 and 42 exactly, and we say that 6 is their greatest common
factor (GCF).

The Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
The greatest common factor (GCF) of a list of integers is the largest common
factor of those integers.

a. 24, 60, and 96
b. 6, 35, and 50
Strategy We will prime factor each number in the list. Then we will identify the
common prime factors and ﬁnd their product.

Success Tip
The exponent on any factor in a GCF is the smallest exponent
that appears on that factor in all of the numbers under consideration.
Strategy for Finding the GCF
1.
Write each coefﬁcient as a product of prime factors.
2.
Identify the numerical and variable factors common to each term.
3.
Multiply the common numerical and variable factors identiﬁed in Step 2
to obtain the GCF. If there are no common factors, the GCF is 1.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the GCF of each list of terms:
a.
and 
b.
and 
Strategy We will prime factor each coefﬁcient of each term in the list. Then we
will identify the numerical and variable factors common to each term and ﬁnd
their product.
WHY The product of the common factors is the GCF of the terms in the list.
Solution
a. Step 1 We write each coefﬁcient, 12 and 20, as a product of prime factors.
Recall that an exponent, as in 
indicates repeated multiplication.
This can be written as 
This can be written as 
Step 2 There are two common factors of 2 and one common factor of 
Step 3 We multiply the common factors, 2, 2, and 
to obtain the GCF.
b. Step 1 We write the coefﬁcients, 9, 15, and 90, as products of primes.The
exponents on the variables represent repeated multiplication.

Factoring by grouping.
When a polynomial has 4 or more terms, we see if we can factor it by arranging the
terms in groups that have common factors.This method is called factoring by grouping.
Factoring by Grouping
1.
Group the terms of the polynomial so that the ﬁrst two terms have a
common factor and the last two terms have a common factor.
2.
Factor out the common factor from each group.
3.
Factor out the resulting common binomial factor. If there is no common
binomial factor, regroup the terms of the polynomial and repeat steps 2
and 3.
EXAMPLE 9
Factor:
Strategy We note that there is no common factor of all four terms. Then we will
factor out a common factor from the ﬁrst two terms and a common factor from
the last two terms.
WHY Often this will produce a common binomial factor that can be factored out.
Solution
Since 2 is a common factor of the ﬁrst two terms and 
is a common factor of the
last two terms, we have

1
Factor trinomials of the form

2
Factor trinomials of the form 
x2  bx  c after factoring out
the GCF.
3
Factor trinomials of the form 
x2  bx  c using the grouping
method.
In Chapter 11, we learned how to multiply binomials. For example, to multiply 
and 
we proceed as follows:
To factor the trinomial
we will reverse the multiplication process and
determine what factors were multiplied to obtain 
Since the product of
two binomials is often a trinomial, many trinomials factor into the product of two
binomials.
Multiplication: Given the binomial factors, we ﬁnd the trinomial. 
Factoring: Given the trinomial, we ﬁnd the binomial factors.
We will now consider how to factor trinomials of the form 
where
(called the leading coefﬁcient) is 1.

Factor trinomials using the trial-and-check method.
In the work below, we ﬁnd the products 
and 
There
are several observations that can be made when we compare the results.
In each case, the result is a trinomial, and
• the ﬁrst terms are the same 
• the last terms are the same (3), and
• the middle terms are different (
and 
).
These observations indicate that when the last terms in 
are
interchanged to form 
only the middle terms of the products are
different. This fact is helpful when factoring trinomials using the trial-and-check
method.

WHY Since the terms of

Solution
Since the ﬁrst term is

Because each term of the trinomial is positive, we need only consider positive
factors of the last term. Since the positive factors of 3 are 1 and 3, there are two
possible factorizations.

Success Tip
If a trinomial does not have a common factor, the terms of each
of its binomial factors will not have a common factor.
EXAMPLE 4
Factor:
Strategy We will assume that 
is the product of two binomials
and we will use a systematic method to ﬁnd their terms.
WHY Since the terms of 
do not have a common factor (other
than 1), the only option available is to try to factor it as the product of two binomials.
Solution
Since the ﬁrst term is 
the ﬁrst terms of the factors must be 
and 
or 
and 
or
Because 
or 
give
To ﬁll in the blanks, we must ﬁnd two factors of 
that will give a middle
term of 
Since 
has many factors, there are many possible combinations for the
last terms of the binomial factors. The signs of the factors must be different,
because the last term of the trinomial is negative.
If we pick factors of 
and 
for the ﬁrst terms, and 
and 
for the last
terms, the multiplication gives an incorrect middle term of 
So the
factorization is incorrect.

Because some guesswork is often necessary, it is difﬁcult to give speciﬁc rules
for factoring trinomials with a lead coefﬁcient other than 1. However, the following
hints are helpful.
Factoring 
1.
Write the trinomial in descending powers of the variable and factor out
any GCF (including 
if that is necessary to make the leading coefﬁcient
positive).
2.
Attempt to write the trinomial as the product of two binomials. The
coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst terms of each binomial factor must be factors of 
and the last terms must be factors of 
Factors
of 
Factors
of 
3.
If the sign of the last term of the trinomial is positive, the signs between
the terms of the binomial factors are the same as the sign of the middle
term. If the sign of the last term is negative, the signs between the terms of
the binomial factors are opposite.
4.
Try combinations of coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst terms and last terms until you
ﬁnd one that gives the middle term of the trinomial. If no combination
works, the trinomial is prime.
5.
Check the factorization by multiplying.

Factor perfect-square trinomials.
We can factor perfect-square trinomials using the methods previously discussed in
Sections 12.2 and 12.3. However, in many cases, we can factor them more quickly by
inspecting their terms and applying the special-product rules in reverse.
Factoring Perfect-Square Trinomials
Each of these trinomials factors as the square
of a binomial.

These results justify the rules for factoring the sum and difference of two cubes.
They are easier to remember if we think of a sum (or a difference) of two cubes as
the cube of a First quantity plus (or minus) the cube of the Last quantity.

Factoring the Sum and Difference of Two Cubes
To factor the cube of a First quantity plus the cube of a Last quantity, multiply
the First plus the Last by the First squared, minus the First times the Last, plus
the Last squared.
To factor the cube of a First quantity minus the cube of a Last quantity,
multiply the First minus the Last by the First squared, plus the First times the
Last, plus the Last squared.

Steps for Factoring a Polynomial
1.
Is there a common factor? If so, factor out the GCF, or the opposite of the
GCF, so that the leading coefﬁcient is positive.
2.
How many terms does the polynomial have?
If it has two terms, look for the following problem types:
a. The difference of two squares
b. The sum of two cubes
c. The difference of two cubes
If it has three terms, look for the following problem types:
a. A perfect-square trinomial
b. If the trinomial is not a perfect square, use the trial-and-check method
or the grouping method.
If it has four or more terms, try to factor by grouping.
3.
Can any factors be factored further? If so, factor them completely.
4.
Does the factorization check? Check by multiplying.
EXAMPLE 1
Factor:
Strategy We will answer the four questions listed in the Steps for Factoring a
Polynomial.
WHY The answers to these questions help us determine which factoring
techniques to use.
Solution
Is there a common factor?
Yes. Factor out the GCF, which is 2.

Solve quadratic equations using the zero-factor property.
To solve a quadratic equation, we ﬁnd all the values of the variable that make the
equation true.
The method that we have used to solve linear equations cannot be used to solve
a quadratic equation, because those techniques cannot isolate the variable on one
side of the equation. However, we can often solve quadratic equations using
factoring and the following property of real numbers.
The Zero-Factor Property
If and

if 
then 
or b  0.

In words, the zero-factor property states that when the product of two numbers
is zero, at least one of them must be zero.

“Fraternity and sorority membership

Chronicle of Higher Education, 2003
The ﬁrst college social fraternity, Phi Beta
Kappa, was founded in 1776 on the
campus of The College of William and
Mary. However, secret societies have
existed since ancient times, and from
these roots the essence of today’s
fraternities and sororities have their
foundation. Pythagoras, the Greek
mathematician of the 6th century B.C., was
the leader of a secret fraternity/sorority
called the Pythagoreans.They were a
community of men and women that
studied mathematics, and in particular, the
“magic 3-4-5 triangle.”This right triangle
is special because the sum of the squares of the lengths of its legs is equal to
the square of the length of its hypotenuse:

Right Triangles
The
longer leg of a right triangle is 3 units longer
than the shorter leg. If the hypotenuse is 6
units longer than the shorter leg, ﬁnd the
lengths of the sides of the triangle.
Analyze We begin by drawing a right triangle
and labeling the legs and the hypotenuse.
Form We let 
the length of the shorter leg.Then the length of the hypotenuse
is 
and the length of the longer leg is 
By the Pythagorean theorem, we
have

Combine like terms on the left-hand side.
Subtract 
and 36 from both sides to
make the right-hand side 0.
Now solve the quadratic equation for 
Factor.
Set each factor to zero.
Solve each equation.
State Since a side cannot have a negative length,we discard the solution 
Thus,
the shorter leg is 9 units long, the hypotenuse is 
units long, and the
longer leg is 
units long.
Check The longer leg, with length 12, is
3 units longer than the shorter leg, with
length 9.The hypotenuse, with length 15, is
6 units longer than the shorter leg. Since
these lengths satisfy the Pythagorean the-
orem, the results check.

Write each monomial as a product of
prime factors.
2.
Identify the numerical and variable
factors common to each term.
3.
Multiply the common numerical and
variable factors identiﬁed in Step 2 to
obtain the GCF. If there are no common
factors, the GCF is 1.

A Factoring Strategy
To factor a random polynomial, use the
factoring strategy discussed in the section.
Remember that the instruction to factor
means to factor completely. A polynomial is
factored completely when no factor can be
factored further.
DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS
EXAMPLES
Factor:
Is there a common factor other than 1?
No.
How many terms does it have?
Since the polynomial has four terms,
try factoring by grouping.
Is it factored completely?
No. We can factor 
as the sum of
two cubes.
Does it check?
Check by multiplication.

WHY A denominator of 0 makes a rational expression undeﬁned, because a
denominator of 0 indicates division by 0. We don’t need to examine the
numerator of the rational expression; it can be any value, including 0.
Solution
a. The expression 
will be undeﬁned if the denominator is zero.To ﬁnd the 
value, we solve
Set the denominator equal to zero.
Add 5 to both sides to solve for

Simplify rational expressions.
To simplify a fraction we remove a factor equal to 1. This can be accomplished in
two ways. For example, to simplify 
we proceed as follows:
Method 1
Factor the numerator 
and the denominator.
From Section 3.2, we 
know that 
A number divided by 
itself is equal to 1: 
Any number multiplied 
by 1 remains the same.

When all pairs of factors common to the numerator and denominator of a
fraction have been removed, the fraction is expressed in simpliﬁed form. Since it
usually requires fewer steps, we will use method 2 in the following examples. The
generalization of method 2 is called the fundamental property of fractions and can
be applied to rational expressions as well.

Caution!
When simplifying a fraction, remember that only factors that are
common to the entire numerator and the entire denominator can be removed.
For example, consider the correct simpliﬁcation
It would be incorrect to remove the common term of 5 in this simpliﬁcation.
Doing so gives an incorrect answer of 9.
When simplifying rational expressions, it is incorrect to remove terms
common to both the numerator and denominator.

Divide rational expressions.
Division by a nonzero number is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Thus, to
divide two fractions, we can invert the divisor (the fraction following the 
sign) and
multiply. For example,
Invert and change the division to a multiplication.
Multiply the numerators and denominators.
We use the same procedures to divide rational expressions.

Convert units of measurement.
We can use the concepts discussed in this section to make conversions from one unit
of measure to another. Unit conversion factors play an important role in this process.
A unit conversion factor is a fraction that has a value of 1. For example, we can use
the fact that 1 square yard 
9 square feet to form two unit conversion factors:
Read as “1 square yard 
per 9 square feet.”
1 yd2
9 ft2  1

Read as “9 square feet
per 1 square yard.”
9 ft2
1 yd2  1
Success Tip
Remember that unit conversion factors are equal to 1. Some
examples are:
12 in.
1 ft
 1   60 min
1 hr
 1
Since a unit conversion factor is equal to 1, multiplying a measurement by a unit
conversion factor does not change the measurement, it only changes the units of
measure.

WHY A properly chosen unit conversion factor can convert the number of
square feet of carpeting on the roll to the number of square yards on the roll.
Solution
When unrolled, the carpeting forms a rectangular shape with an area of
square feet. We will multiply 
by a unit conversion factor
such that the units of 
are removed and the units of 
are introduced. Since 
we will use 
Multiply by a unit conversion factor that relates yd2
to ft2.
Remove the units of ft2 that are common to the
numerator and denominator.
Divide 1,800 by 9 to get 200.

The Speed of Light
The speed with which light moves
through space is about 186,000 miles per second. Express this speed in miles per
minute.
Strategy The speed of light can be expressed as 
We will multiply that
fraction by a unit conversion factor.
WHY A properly chosen unit conversion factor can convert the number of miles
traveled per second to the number of miles traveled per minute.
Solution
We will multiply 
by a unit conversion factor such that the units of 
seconds are removed and the units of minutes are introduced. Since 60 seconds 
1 minute, we will use 
Multiply by a unit conversion factor that
relates seconds to minutes.
Remove the units of seconds that are common
to the numerator and denominator.
Multiply 186,000 and 60 to get 11,160,000.

To add these fractions, we need to express them as equivalent expressions with a
common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) is usually the easiest
one to use. The least common denominator of several rational expressions can be
found as follows:
Chapter 13
Rational Expressions and Equations
1092
Finding the LCD
1.
Factor each denominator completely.
2.
The LCD is a product that uses each different factor obtained in step 1 the
greatest number of times it appears in any one factorization.
EXAMPLE 5
Find the LCD of each pair of rational expressions:
a.
and
b.
and
Strategy We will begin by factoring completely the denominator of each
rational expression. Then we will form a product using each factor the greatest
number of times it appears in any one factorization.
WHY Since the LCD must contain the factors of each denominator, we need to
write each denominator in factored form.
Solution
a.
Prime factor 8.
Prime factor 18. Factor 
The factorizations of

contain the factors 2, 3, and 
The LCD of

the greatest number of times 
it appears in any one factorization.
The greatest number of times the factor 2 appears is three times.
The greatest number of times the factor 3 appears is twice.
The greatest number of times the factor appears is twice.

Build rational expressions into equivalent expressions.
Recall from Chapter 7 that writing a fraction as an equivalent fraction with a larger 
denominator is called building the fraction. For example, to write as an equivalent 
fraction with a denominator of 35, we multiply it by 1 in the form of 
Multiply the numerators.
Multiply the denominators.
To add and subtract rational expressions with different denominators, we must
write them as equivalent expressions having a common denominator. To do so, we
build rational expressions.

We have discussed a method for ﬁnding the least common denominator (LCD) of
two rational expressions. We have also built rational expressions into equivalent
expressions having a given denominator. We will now use these skills to add and
subtract rational expressions with unlike denominators.

1
Add and subtract rational expressions that have unlike
denominators.
The following steps summarize how to add (or subtract) rational expressions that
have different denominators.
Adding or Subtracting Rational Expressions That Have Unlike
Denominators
1.
Find the LCD.
2.
Rewrite each rational expression as an equivalent expression with the
LCD as the denominator.To do this, build each fraction using a form of 1
that involves any factor(s) needed to obtain the LCD.
3.
Add (or subtract) the numerators and write the sum or difference over
the LCD.
4.
Simplify the result, if possible.
EXAMPLE 1
Add:
Strategy We will use the procedure for adding rational expressions that have
unlike denominators.The ﬁrst step is to determine the LCD.
WHY If we are to add (or subtract) fractions, their denominators must be the
same. Since the denominators of these rational expressions are different, we
cannot add them in their present form.
Solution
Step 1 The denominators are 7 and 5.The LCD is 
Step 2 We need to multiply the denominator of 
by 5 and the denominator of 
by 7 to obtain the LCD, 35. It follows that and are the forms of 1 that should 
be used to write the equivalent rational expressions.
Build the rational expressions so that each has a 
denominator of 35.
Perform the multiplications.
Step 3
Add the numerators and keep the common
denominator.
Add the numerators and keep the common
denominator.
Step 4 Since 41 and 35 have no common factors, the result cannot be simpliﬁed.

WHY If we are to add (or subtract) fractions, their denominators must be the
same. Since the denominators of these rational expressions are different, we
cannot add them in their present form.
Solution
Step 1 To ﬁnd the LCD, we form a product that uses each different factor of 
and 
the greatest number of times it appears in any one factorization.
Step 2 We need to multiply the denominator of 
by 3 and the denominator 
of 
by 4 to obtain the LCD,
It follows that and are the forms of 1 that 
should be used to write the equivalent rational expressions.
Build each fraction to get the common denominator.
Perform the multiplications.
Step 3
Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.
Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.

A rational expression whose numerator and/or denominator contain fractions is
called a complex rational expression or a complex fraction. The expression above the
main fraction bar of a complex fraction is the numerator, and the expression below
the main fraction bar is the denominator.Two examples of complex fractions are:

1
Simplify complex fractions using division.
One method for simplifying complex fractions uses the fact that the main fraction
bar indicates division.
Simplifying Complex Fractions Method 1: Using Division
1.
Add or subtract in the numerator and/or denominator so that the
numerator is a single fraction and the denominator is a single fraction.
2.
Perform the indicated division by multiplying the numerator of the
complex fraction by the reciprocal of the denominator.
3.
Simplify the result, if possible.
EXAMPLE 1
Simplify:
Strategy We will perform the division indicated by the main fraction bar using
the procedure for dividing rational expressions from Section 13.2.
WHY We can skip the ﬁrst step of method 1 and immediately divide because the
numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction are already single
fractions.
Solution
Write the division indicated by the main fraction bar using a
symbol.
To divide rational expressions, multiply the ﬁrst by the
reciprocal of the second.
Multiply the numerators.
Multiply the denominators.
Factor 9 as 
Then simplify by removing factors equal to 1.
Multiply the remaining factors in the numerator.
Multiply the remaining factors in the denominator.

WHY The numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction must be
written as single fractions before dividing.
Solution
To write the numerator as a single fraction, we build 
and 
to have an LCD of 
and then subtract. To write the denominator as a single fraction, we build 
and to have an LCD of 15, and then add.
The LCD for the numerator is 
Build each fraction so
that each has a denominator of 
The LCD for the denominator is 15. Build each fraction so
that each has a denominator of 15.
Multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
Subtract in the numerator and add in the denominator
of the complex fraction.
Now that the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction are
single fractions, we perform the indicated division.
Write the division indicated by the main fraction bar
using a 
symbol.
Multiply by the reciprocal of 
Multiply the numerators.
Multiply the denominators.
Since the numerator and denominator have no common factor, the result does
not simplify.

Simplify complex fractions using the LCD.
A second method for simplifying complex fractions uses the concepts of LCD and
multiplication by a form of 1. The multiplication by 1 produces a simpler, equivalent
expression, which will not contain fractions in its numerator or denominator.

1.
Find the LCD of all fractions within the complex fraction.
2.
Multiply the complex fraction by 1 in the form 
3.
Perform the operations in the numerator and denominator. No fractional
expressions should remain within the complex fraction.
4.

Solve rational equations.
2
Solve for a speciﬁed variable in a
formula.
In Chapter 8, we solved equations such as 
by multiplying both sides by 
the LCD. With this approach, the equation that results is equivalent to the original
equation, but easier to solve because it is cleared of fractions.
In this section, we will extend the fraction-clearing strategy to solve another
type of equation, called a rational equation.

Rational Equations
A rational equation is an equation that contains one or more rational
expressions.
Rational equations often have a variable in a denominator. Some examples are:

Solve rational equations.
To solve a rational equation, we ﬁnd all the values of the variable that make the
equation true. Any value of the variable that makes a denominator in a rational
equation equal to 0 cannot be a solution of the equation. Such a number must be
rejected, because division by 0 is undeﬁned.
The following steps can be used to solve rational equations.
Strategy for Solving Rational Equations
1.
Determine which numbers cannot be solutions of the equation.
2.
Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of all rational expressions
in the equation.This clears the equation of fractions.
3.
Solve the resulting equation.
4.
Check all possible solutions in the original equation.

Strategy We will use the multiplication property of equality to clear this
rational equation of fractions by multiplying both sides by the LCD.
WHY Equations that contain only integers are usually easier to solve than
equations that contain fractions.
Solution
There are no restrictions on 
because no value of ever makes a denominator 0.
Since the denominators are 
and 2, we multiply both sides of the equation by
the LCD, 6.
Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of 
and
which is 6.

This method can be used to solve rational equations. It is important to note that if
we multiply both sides of an equation by an expression that involves a variable, we
must check the apparent solutions.

Solving Rational Equations

We have determined that 1 makes both denominators in the original equation 0.
Therefore, 1 is not a solution. Since 1 is the only possible solution, and it must be 
rejected, it follows that
has no solution.
When solving an equation, a possible solution that does not satisfy the
original equation is called an extraneous solution. In this example, 1 is an
extraneous solution.

Filling an Oil Tank
An inlet pipe can ﬁll an oil tank in
7 days, and a second inlet pipe can ﬁll the same tank in 9 days. If both pipes are
used, how long will it take to ﬁll the tank?
Analyze The key is to determine what each pipe can do in 1 day. If we add what
the ﬁrst pipe can do in 1 day to what the second pipe can do in 1 day,the sum is what
they can do in 1 day, working together.

• To prepare fuel for a lawnmower, gasoline must be mixed with oil in the ratio
of 50 to 1.
• To make 14-karat jewelry, gold is mixed with other metals in the ratio of 14
to 10.
• In the stock market, winning stocks might outnumber losing stocks in the
ratio of 7 to 4.

Translate each phrase into a ratio written in fractional form:
a. The ratio of 5 to 9
b. 12 ounces to 2 pounds
Strategy To translate, we need to identify the number (or quantity) before the
word to and the number (or quantity) after it.
WHY The number before the word to is the numerator of the ratio and the
number after it is the denominator.
Solution
a. The ratio of 5 to 9 is written 
b. To write a ratio of two quantities with the same units, we must express 2
pounds in terms of ounces. Since 1 pound 
16 ounces, 2 pounds 
32 ounces.

The Language of Algebra
A ratio that is the quotient of two quantities
having the same units should be simpliﬁed so that no units appear in the ﬁnal
answer.
When quotients are used to compare quantities with different units, they are
called rates. For example, if the 495-mile drive from New Orleans to Dallas takes 9
hours, the average rate of speed is the quotient of the miles driven to the length of
time the trip takes.

“A consistent majority of students who borrow to pay for their higher education
believe they could not have gone to college without student loans.Over 70% agree
that student loans were very or extremely important in allowing them access to
education after high school.”
National Student Loan Survey,2002
Many student loan programs calculate a debt-to-income ratio to assist them in
determining whether the borrower has sufﬁcient income to repay the loan.A
debt-to-income ratio compares an applicant’s monthly debt payments
(mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, etc.) to their gross monthly income.
Most education lenders require borrower debt-to-income ratios of or less,
according to the Nellie Mae Debt Management Edvisor. Calculate the debt-to-
income ratio for each loan applicant shown below.Then determine whether it
makes them eligible for a student loan.

Use proportions to solve problems.
We can use proportions to solve many real-world problems. If we are given a ratio
(or rate) comparing two quantities, the words of the problem can be translated to a
proportion, and we can solve it to ﬁnd the unknown.
EXAMPLE 6

If 6 apples cost $1.38, how much will
16 apples cost?
Analyze We know the cost of 6 apples; we are to ﬁnd the cost of 16 apples.
Form Let 
the cost of 16 apples. If we compare the number of apples to their
cost, we know that the two rates are equal.
6 apples is to $1.38 as 16 apples is to $c.
Solve
In a proportion, the product of the extremes equals the product
of the means.
Perform the multiplication: 
To undo the multiplication by 6, divide both sides by 6.
Divide:
State Sixteen apples will cost $3.68.
Check If 16 apples are bought,this is about 3 times as many as 6 apples,which cost
$1.38. If we multiply $1.38 by 3, we get an estimate of the cost of 16 apples:
The result, $3.68, seems reasonable.

Scale 
Models
A scale is a ratio (or rate) that compares
the size of a model, drawing, or map to
the size of an actual object. The scale
shown in the ﬁgure indicates that 1 inch
on the model carousel is equivalent to
160 inches on the actual carousel. How
wide should the model be if the actual
carousel is 35 feet wide?
Analyze We are asked to determine the width of the miniature carousel, if a ratio
of 1 inch to 160 inches is used.We would like the width of the model to be given in
inches, not feet, so we will express the 35-foot width of the actual carousel as
inches.
Form Let 
the width of the model. The ratios of the dimensions of the model
to the corresponding dimensions of the actual carousel are equal.
1 inch is to 160 inches as w inches is to 420 inches.
Solve
In a proportion, the product of the extremes is equal to the product
of the means.
To undo the multiplication by 160, divide both sides by 160.
Do the division: 
State The width of the miniature carousel should be 2.625 in., or

Check A width of

1
Solve direct variation

Solve inverse variation 
problems.
If the value of one quantity depends on the value of another quantity, we can often
describe that relationship using the language of variation:
• The sales tax on an item varies with the price.
• The intensity of light varies with the distance from its source.
• The pressure exerted by water on an object varies with the depth of the
object beneath the surface.
In this section, we will discuss two types of variation, and we will see how to
represent them algebraically using equations.
1
Solve direct variation problems.
One type of variation, called direct variation, is represented by an equation of the
form 
where 
is a constant (a number). Two variables are said to vary
directly if one is a constant multiple of the other.

Scientists have found that the distance a spring will stretch varies directly with
the force applied to it. The more force applied to the spring, the more it will stretch.
If 
represents the distance stretched and 
represents the force applied, this
relationship can be expressed by the equation
where is the constant of variation
Suppose that a 150-pound weight
stretches a spring 18 inches. (See the
ﬁgure to the right.) We can ﬁnd the
constant of variation for the spring by
substituting 150 for and 18 for 
in the
equation 
and solving for :
Divide both sides by 150 to

Therefore, the equation describing the relationship between the distance the spring

To ﬁnd the distance that 
the same spring will stretch when a 50-pound weight is attached, we proceed as
follows:
This is the equation describing the direct variation.
Substitute 50 for f.
Perform the multiplication.
The spring will stretch 6 inches when a 50-pound weight is attached.
The table shows some other possible values for

equation 
When these ordered pairs are graphed and a straight line is drawn 
through them, it is apparent that as the force 
applied to a spring increases, the 
distance 
it stretches increases. Furthermore, the slope of the graph is 
the
constant of variation.

Suppose that the time (in hours) it takes to paint a house varies inversely with
the size of the painting crew. As the number of painters increases, the time that it
takes to paint the house decreases. If 
represents the number of painters and 
represents the time it takes to paint the house, this relationship can be expressed by
the equation
where 
is the constant of variation
If we know that a crew of 8 can paint the house in 12 hours, we can ﬁnd the constant 
of variation by substituting 8 for 
and 12 for 
in the equation 
and solving
for :
Multiply both sides by 8 to isolate 
The equation describing the relationship between the size of the painting crew 
and the time it takes to paint the house is 
We can use this equation to ﬁnd the 
time it will take a crew of any size to paint the house. For example, to ﬁnd the time it 
would take a 4-person crew, we substitute 4 for 
in the equation 
This is the equation describing the inverse variation.
Substitute 4 for 
It would take a 4-person crew 24 hours to paint the house.
The table shows some possible values for

When these ordered pairs are graphed and a smooth curve is drawn through

Gas Laws
The volume occupied by a gas varies inversely
with the pressure placed on it. That is, the volume decreases as the pressure
increases. If a gas occupies a volume of 15 cubic inches when placed under 4
pounds per square inch (psi) of pressure, how much pressure is needed to
compress the gas into a volume of 10 cubic inches?
Strategy We will follow the strategy for solving an inverse variation problem.
WHY In the words of the problem, the phrase varies inversely indicates that an

Solve each direct variation problem.See Example 2.
45. DRIVING The distance that a car can travel without
refueling varies directly with the number of gallons of
gasoline in the tank. If a car can go 360 miles on a full
tank of gas (15 gallons), how far can it go on
7 gallons?
46. GRAVITY The force of gravity acting on an object
varies directly with the mass of the object.The force
on a mass of 5 kilograms is 49 newtons.What is the
force acting on a mass of 12 kilograms?
47. DOSAGES The recommended dose (in milligrams)
of Demerol, a preoperative medication given to
children, varies directly with the child’s weight (in
pounds). If the proper dosage for a child weighing
30 pounds is 18 milligrams, ﬁnd the proper dosage for
a child weighing 45 pounds.
48. MEDICATIONS To ﬁght ear infections in children,
doctors often prescribe Ceclor.The recommended
dose in milligrams varies directly with the child’s
body weight in pounds. If the proper dosage for a
20-pound child is 124 milligrams, ﬁnd the proper
dosage for a 28-pound child.
Solve each direct variation problem.See Example 4.
49. TRAVELING The time it takes a car to travel a
certain distance varies inversely with its rate of speed.

STUDY SKILLS CHECKLIST
Working with Algebraic Fractions
There are several common mistakes that students make when working with the topics of
Chapter 13.To make sure you are prepared for your test, study this checklist of common
mistakes below. Put a checkmark in the box if you can answer “yes” to the statement.
 I know that when simplifying fractions that have
more than one term in the numerator and/or the
denominator, I must factor the numerator and
denominator using the factoring strategies from
Chapter 12.When I have completely factored the
numerator and denominator, I remove all common
factors.
 I know that to multiply fractions, I do not need a
common denominator. I simply factor across the
numerators and factor across the denominators
and remove common factors.
 I know that to divide fractions, I must make sure to
multiply the ﬁrst fraction by the reciprocal of the
second fraction.

 I know that when adding or subtracting fractions,
I must have a common denominator.Then I add or
subtract across the numerator and keep the
common denominator.
 I know that when subtracting a fraction with more
than one term in the numerator, I must make sure
I distribute the negative through the entire
numerator being subtracted.
 I know that when solving equations that involve
rational expressions, I can remove the fractions by
multiplying both sides by the LCD of the entire
equation.When working with rational expressions,
I must work with the fractions that are in the
expression.

Archaeologists
Archaeologists examine and recover material evidence including the ruins of
buildings,tools,pottery,and other objects remaining from past
human cultures.They use these items to determine the
history,customs,and living habits of earlier civilizations.
Many archaeologists specialize in a particular region of
the world.They may work under rugged conditions,and
their work may involve strenuous physical exertion.
In Problem 81 of Study Set 14.1, you will see how
archaeologists can use the Pythagorean theorem to help
them determine how far they are from base camp.
JOB TITLE:
Archaeologist
EDUCATION: Graduates with a master’s
degree in archaeology usually are qualiﬁed
for positions outside of colleges and
universities.A Ph.D.degree may be required
for higher-level positions.Training in
statistics and mathematics is essential for
many archaeologists.
JOB OUTLOOK: Excellent.Jobs are expected
to grow 15% from 2006–2016,which is
about as fast as average.
ANNUAL EARNINGS: In 2006,the median
annual earnings for archaeologists working
in various capacities were $49,930.

To ﬁnd the area 
of the square shown in the ﬁgure, we
multiply its length by its width.
The area is 25 square inches.
We have seen that the product 
can be denoted by
the exponential expression 
where 5 is raised to the second power. Whenever we
raise a number to the second power, we are squaring it, or ﬁnding its square. This
example illustrates that the formula for the area of a square with sides of length is

Find square roots of perfect squares.
Suppose we know that the area of the square shown in the

substitute 36 for

and solve for 
To solve for 
we must ﬁnd a positive number whose
square is 36. Since 6 is such a number, the sides of the
square are 6 inches long. The number 6 is called a square root of 36, because 6 is the
positive number that we square to get 36.

All positive numbers have two square roots, one positive and one negative. The
two square roots of 9 are 3 and 
and the two square roots of 144 are 12 and 
The number 0 is the only number that has one square root, which is 0.
The principal square root of a positive number is its positive square root.
Although 3 and 
are both square roots of 9, only 3 is the principal square root.The 
symbol 
called a radical symbol, is used to represent the principal square root 
of a number, and

Approximate irrational cube
roots.
3
Graph the cube root function.
4
Find higher-order roots.
5
Simplify radicands that contain
variables.
To ﬁnd the volume 
of the cube shown in the ﬁgure, we
multiply its length, width, and height.
The volume is 125 cubic inches.
We have seen that 
can be denoted by the
exponential expression 
where 5 is raised to the third power. Whenever we raise a
number to the third power, we are cubing it, or ﬁnding its cube. This example illustrates
that the formula for the volume of a cube with each side of length is

because 
• The cube of is 
because 
• The cube of

• The cube of 0 is 0, because 
In this section, we will reverse the cubing process and ﬁnd cube roots of numbers.
We will also consider fourth roots, ﬁfth roots, and so on. After graphing the cube root
function, we will work with radical expressions having radicands containing variables.

If the square shown in the ﬁgure has

side is

formula for the area of a square and the
concept of square root to show that this
is so.
is the length of a side
of the square.
Substitute 12 for 
the area of the square.
Take the positive square root of both sides.
The length of a side of the square is 
yards.
The form in which we express the length of a side of the square depends on the
situation. If an approximation is acceptable, we can use a calculator to ﬁnd that 
and we can then round to a speciﬁed degree of accuracy. For
example, to the nearest tenth, each side is 3.5 yards long.
If the situation calls for the exact length, we must use a radical expression. As
you will see in this section, it is common practice to write a radical expression such 
as 
in simpliﬁed form. To simplify radicals, we will use the multiplication and
division properties of radicals.

A square root radical is in simpliﬁed form when each of the following statements is true.
Simpliﬁed Form of a Square Root
1.
Except for 1, the radicand has no perfect-square factors.
2.
No fraction appears in a radicand.
3.
No radical appears in the denominator.
We can use the multiplication property of radicals to simplify square roots whose 
radicands have perfect-square factors. For example, we can simplify 
as follows:

is equal to the square root of 4 times the
square root of 3.
Write 
as 2. Read as “2 times the square root of 3” or as 
“2 radical 3.”
The square in the ﬁgure, which we considered in the introduction to this section,
has a side length of 
yards. We now see that the exact length of a side can be 
expressed in simpliﬁed form as 
yards.
To simplify more difﬁcult square roots, it is helpful to know the natural-
number perfect squares. For example, 81 is a perfect square, because it is the
square of 9:

Simplify:
Strategy We will factor 27 as 
and then use the product rule for square
roots to simplify the radical expression.
WHY Factoring the radicand in this way leads to a square root of a perfect
square that we can easily evaluate.
Solution
The square root of a product is equal to the product of their
square roots.
Find the square root of the perfect-square factor: 
As a check, recall that 
is the number that, when squared, gives 27. If 
then 
should be equal to 27.
Use the power of a product rule for exponents: Raise each
factor of the product 
to the second power.

Use prime factorization to simplify radicals.
When simplifying square roots, prime factorization can be useful in ﬁnding the
greatest perfect-square factor of the radicand.
EXAMPLE 3
Simplify, if possible:
a.

Strategy In each case, the greatest perfect-square factor of the radicand (if there
is one) is not obvious. Another approach is to ﬁnd the prime factorization of the
radicand and look for pairs of like factors.
WHY Identifying a pair of like factors of the radicand leads to a square root of a
perfect square that we can easily evaluate.
Solution
a.
Write 150 in prime-factored form.
Group the pair of like factors together and use the product
rule for square roots.
Evaluate the square root of the perfect square:
Write the factor 5 ﬁrst. This way, no misunderstanding can
occur about exactly what is under the radical symbol.
b. We prime factor 95 to get 
Since the factorization does not contain
a pair of like factors, 95 does not have a perfect-square factor. It follows that

Strategy First, we will see if the radicands of the square roots are the same. If
they are, we can use the distributive property in reverse to add (or subtract) like
radicals.
WHY We must check the radicands ﬁrst because only square roots with the same
radicand can be added or subtracted.
Solution
a. The expression contains three terms:
and 
The ﬁrst and third
terms have like radicals, and they can be combined.
Group the expressions with like
radicals. Write 
as

Simplify square roots in a sum or difference.
If a sum or difference involves radicals that are unlike, make sure each one is written
in simpliﬁed form.After doing so, like radicals may result that can be combined.
EXAMPLE 2
Simplify:
Strategy We will simplify the radicals in each term of the expression. Then we
will see if there are like radicals that can be combined.
WHY Only like radicals can be combined.
Solution
The radical 
is not in simpliﬁed form, because 18 has a perfect-square factor 
of 9. The radical 
is not in simpliﬁed form either, because 8 has a perfect-
square factor of 4. To simplify the radicals and add the expressions, we proceed as
follows.
Factor 18 and 8 using perfect-square
factors.

the product of their square roots.

Use the squaring property of equality.
The equation 
is called a radical equation, because it contains a radical
expression with a variable radicand. To solve this equation, we isolate 
by undoing 
the operation performed on it. Recall that 
represents the number that, when 
squared, gives 
Therefore, if we square
we will obtain 
Using this observation, we can eliminate the radical on the left-hand side of

Check possible solutions.
If we square both sides of an equation, the resulting equation may not have the same
solutions as the original one. For example, consider the equation
The only solution of this equation is 2. However, if we square both sides, we obtain
which simpliﬁes to
This new equation has solutions 2 and 
because 
and 
The equations 
and 
are not equivalent equations because they do
not have the same solutions. The solution

but it does not satisfy
We see that squaring both sides of an equation can produce an equation with
solutions that don’t satisfy the original one. We call such numbers extraneous
solutions.Therefore, we must check each possible solution in the original equation.

Solve equations containing one square root.
To solve an equation containing square root radicals, we follow these steps.
Solving Radical Equations
1.
Isolate a radical term on one side of the equation.
2.
Square both sides of the equation and solve the resulting equation.
3.
Check the possible solutions in the original equation. Discard any
extraneous solutions.This step is required.

WHY The radical is already on a side by itself. Squaring both sides will clear the
equation of the square root.
Solution
Since this might produce an equation with more solutions than the original one,
we must check each solution.
Square both sides.

WHY This will put the equation in a form where we can square both sides to
clear the radical.
Solution
We isolate the radical on one side and proceed as follows:
Subtract 7 from both sides.
Square both sides to eliminate the radical.
and 
Subtract 1 from both sides.
Divide both sides by 5.
We check by substituting 3 for in the original equation.
Substitute 3 for 
Evaluate the expression within the radical symbol.

Working with Radicals
There are several common mistakes that students make when working with the topics of Chapter 14.
To make sure you are prepared for the test over this material, read the list below to help you avoid
these mistakes. Put a checkmark in the box if you can answer “yes” to the statement.
 When adding or subtracting radicals expressions, I know that I must have like radicals. Like radicals are radical
expressions in which the index and the radicand are the same.
Both have the same index and radicand. Add the coefﬁcients of the
terms and keep the same radical.
cannot be combined.
The operation is addition but the radicals are not like radicals. The
expression is in simplest form.

The square root of a product is equal to the product of the square
roots.

Multiply 
and 
Both radicals have the same index and the same radicand. To
combine them, add the coefﬁcients and keep the radical.
 To multiply the radicals, I know that only the index has to be the same. I will use the product rule for radicals to
carry out the multiplication, being sure to simplify all answers.
Multiply the integer factors, 3 and 2, and multiply the radicals.
Use the product rule for radicals.
 To multiply radical expressions with more than one term, I know to use the distributive property.
 I know that when solving radical equations, I must isolate the radical on one side of the equation before raising
both sides to the power that matches the index.
 Even if I am certain that no algebraic mistakes were made when solving a radical equation, I must still check
my solutions. Raising both sides to a power can introduce extraneous solutions that must be discarded.

movie,
a
stuntwoman falls from the top of a
95-foot-tall building into a 10-foot-tall
airbag directly below her on the ground.
The formula 
gives the distance
in feet that she falls in 
seconds. For
how many seconds will she fall before
making contact with the airbag?
Solution
The woman will fall a distance of
feet before making contact
with the airbag. To ﬁnd the number of seconds that the fall will last, we substitute
85 for 
in the formula and solve for the time.
This is the formula that models the situation.
Substitute 85 for 
the distance in feet, that the stuntwoman falls.
The resulting quadratic equation is easily solved by the square root property.

Solving Quadratic Equations:Completing the Square
1251
In Section 15.1, we used the square root property to solve equations such as
and 
whose left side is a binomial squared and right side
is a constant. We also solved equations such as 
in a similar way
by ﬁrst factoring the perfect-square trinomial on the left side.
In this section, we will discuss a procedure that enables us to solve quadratic
equations such as 
whose left side is not a perfect-square trinomial. To
make the left side a perfect-square trinomial we will use a procedure called
completing the square.

Consider the following perfect-square trinomials and their factored forms.

If we ﬁnd 
which is 
and
square it, we get the third term,
• In 
the coefﬁcient of is 
If we ﬁnd 
which is 
and square it, we get the third term:
We can use these observations to change certain binomials into perfect-square
trinomials. For example, to change 
into a perfect-square trinomial, we ﬁnd
one-half of the coefﬁcient of 
square the result, and add the square to 
First, ﬁnd one-half of
Finally, add the square to the binomial
the coefﬁcient of 
to create a trinomial.
Then square the result.
We obtain the perfect-square trinomial 
that factors as

This is the equation to solve.
Add 13 to both sides so that the constant term is on the
right-hand side.
We then ﬁnd one-half of the coefﬁcient of 
square it, and add the result to both
sides to make the left-hand side a perfect-square trinomial.
Since the coefﬁcient of is 4, add the
square of one-half of 4 to both sides.
Then square 2 to get 4.

EXAMPLE 5
Solve:
Strategy We will use the addition and subtraction properties of equality to get
the variable terms on one side of the equation and the constant term on the
other. Then we will use the division property of equality and divide both sides by
2 so that the coefﬁcient of 
is 1.
WHY This will create a leading coefﬁcient of 1 so that we can complete the
square to solve the equation.
Solution
This is the equation to solve.
Subtract 
from both sides to get 0 on the right-hand side.

*The quadratic formula is just a condensed version of completing the square and is usually easier to use.
However, you need to know how to complete the square because it is used in more advanced mathematics
courses.
To determine the most efﬁcient method for a given equation, we can use the
following strategy.
Strategy for Solving Quadratic Equations
1.
See whether the equation is in a form such that the square root method is
easily applied.
2.
See whether the equation is in a form such that the completing the square
method is easily applied.
3.
If neither Step 1 nor Step 2 is reasonable, write the equation in
form.
4.
See whether the equation can be solved using the factoring method.
5.
If you can’t factor, solve the equation by the quadratic formula.

In Section 9.2, we graphed

we constructed a table of solutions, plotted points, and joined them with a smooth
curve, called a parabola. The parabola opens upward, and the lowest point on the
graph, called the vertex, is the point

Determine the vertex of a parabola.
It is usually easier to graph a quadratic equation
when we know the coordinates of the vertex of
its graph. Because of symmetry, if a parabola has
two -intercepts, the -coordinate of the vertex is
exactly midway between them. We can use this
fact to derive a formula to ﬁnd the vertex of a
parabola.
In general,
if a parabola has two 
-
intercepts,
they can be found by solving
for 
We can use the
quadratic formula to ﬁnd the solutions.They are

Since the 
-value of the vertex of a parabola is halfway between the two 
-intercepts, we can ﬁnd this value by ﬁnding the average, or 
of the sum of the 
-coordinates of the -intercepts.
Add the numerators and
keep the common
denominator.

the -intercept of the parabola is 
The point
which is 2 units to the left of the axis of symmetry, must also be on the
graph. See ﬁgure (a).
To ﬁnd the 
-intercepts, we let 
and solve the resulting quadratic
equation.
This is the equation to graph.
Substitute 0 for 
Divide both sides by 
:
Factor the trinomial.
Set each factor equal to 0.
Since the solutions are the same, the graph has only one -intercept:
This
point is the vertex of the parabola and has already been plotted.
Plotting points/using symmetry: It would be helpful to
know two more points on the graph. To ﬁnd a solution
of 
we select a convenient value
for

Solution
Upward/downward: The equation is in the form 
with 
and 
Since 
the parabola opens upward.
Vertex/axis of symmetry: To ﬁnd the -coordinate of the vertex, we substitute 1 
for and 2 for 
into the formula 
The -coordinate of the vertex is 
To ﬁnd the -coordinate, we substitute 
for in the original equation and ﬁnd 
This is the equation to graph.
Substitute 
for 
Evaluate the right side.
The vertex of the parabola is the point 
The axis of symmetry is the
vertical line passing through 
See ﬁgure (a) on the next page.
Intercepts: Since 
the -intercept of the parabola is 
The point
which is one unit to the left of the axis of symmetry, must also be on
the graph. See ﬁgure (a) on the next page.
To ﬁnd the -intercepts, we let 
and solve the resulting quadratic equation.
This is the equation to graph.
Substitute 0 for 
Since 
does not factor, we will use the quadratic formula to solve
for 
In the quadratic formula, substitute 1 for 
2 for 
and 
for 
Evaluate the right side.
Simplify the radical: 
Factor out the GCF, 2, from the terms in the
numerator. Then simplify by removing the common
factor of 2 in the numerator and denominator.
The -intercepts of the graph are 
and 
To help to 
locate their position on the graph, we can use a calculator to approximate the two
irrational numbers. See ﬁgure (a) on the next page.
Plotting points/using symmetry: To ﬁnd two more
points on the graph, we let 
substitute 2 for 
in
and ﬁnd that 
is 6. We plot 
and
then use symmetry to determine that 
is also on
the graph. See ﬁgure (a) on the next page.

STUDY SKILLS CHECKLIST
Solving Quadratic Equations
The material in Chapter 15 focused on quadratic equations, graphing quadratic equations, and complex
numbers. Be sure to review the following checklist in addition to your other studying as you prepare for
the exam over this material. Put a checkmark in the box if you can answer “yes” to the statement.
 When solving a quadratic equation using the
factoring method, I know that one side of the
equation must be 0. Example:
Solve:
This is the equation to solve.
Subtract 
from both sides to get 
0 on the right side.
Factor the right side.
Set each factor equal to 0.
Solve each linear equation.
 When using the square root property to solve a
quadratic equation, I know that I must always
write the 
sign. Example:
Solve:
This is the equation to solve.
Add 7 from both sides to 
isolate the x 2 term.
Use the square root property 
and remember the 
.
Simplify the left side of the equation.
 I know that I can ﬁnd the vertex of the graph of a
quadratic equation in two variables by completing
the square or by using the fact that the -coordinate
of the vertex is 
To ﬁnd the -coordinate of 
the vertex, I substitute 
for into the
equation and ﬁnd y.

 When solving a quadratic equation using the
completing the square method, I know to make
sure the coefﬁcient of the 
term is 1 before 
I complete the square. If it is not 1, I must divide
both sides of the equation by the coefﬁcient of the
to make it 1. Example:
Solve by completing the square.
This is the equation to
solve.
Divide both sides by 2 to
make the coefﬁcient of the
x 2 term 1.
Complete the square on
the right side by
add 9 to both sides.
Factor the left side and
simplify the right  side of
the equation.
Use the square root
property and remember
the 
.
Simplify the left and right
sides of the equation.
Isolate x by adding 3 to
both sides of the
equation.
 I know that adding, subtracting, and multiplying
complex numbers is similar to these operations
with polynomials. I also must remember to replace
with 
when simplifying the expression.

The -intercepts of the graph are 
and 
Plotting points/using symmetry: To locate two more points on the
graph, we let 
and ﬁnd the corresponding value of 
Thus, the point 
lies on the parabola. We use symmetry to
determine that 
is also on the graph.

Inductive and Deductive Reasoning
Objectives
1
Use inductive reasoning to
solve problems.
2
Use deductive reasoning to
solve problems.
To reason means to think logically. The objective of this appendix is to develop your
problem-solving ability by improving your reasoning skills. We will introduce two 
fundamental types of reasoning that can be applied in a wide variety of settings.They
are known as inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.
Use inductive reasoning to solve problems.
In a laboratory, scientists conduct experiments and observe outcomes. After several
repetitions with similar outcomes, the scientist will generalize the results into a
statement that appears to be true:
• If I heat water to 212°F, it will boil.
• If I drop a weight, it will fall.
• If I combine an acid with a base, a chemical reaction occurs.
When we draw general conclusions from speciﬁc observations, we are using
inductive reasoning. The next examples show how inductive reasoning can be used in
mathematical thinking. Given a list of numbers or symbols, called a sequence, we can
often ﬁnd a missing term of the sequence by looking for patterns and applying
inductive reasoning.

Self Check 1
Find the next number in the 
sequence 3, 1, 1, 3, . . . .
Now Try Problem 11
EXAMPLE 1
Find the next number in the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, . . . .
Strategy We will ﬁnd the difference between pairs of numbers in the sequence.
WHY This process will help us discover a pattern that we can use to ﬁnd the next
number in the sequence.
Solution
The numbers in the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, . . . are increasing. We can ﬁnd the
difference between each pair of successive numbers as follows:
8  5  3
Subtract the ﬁrst number, 5, from the second number, 8.
11  8  3
Subtract the second number, 8, from the third number, 11.
14  11  3
Subtract the third number, 11 from the fourth number, 14.
The difference between each pair of numbers is 3.This means that each number in 
the sequence is 3 greater than the previous one. Thus, the next number in the
sequence is 14  3, or 17.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the next number in the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, . . . .
Strategy The terms of the sequence are decreasing.We will determine how each
number differs from the previous number.
WHY This type of examination helps us discover a pattern that we can use to ﬁnd
the next number in the sequence.

Now Try Problem 15
EXAMPLE 3
Find the next letter in the sequence A, D, B, E, C, F, D, . . . .
Strategy We will create a letter–number correspondence and rewrite the
sequence in an equivalent numerical form.
WHY Many times, it is easier to determine the pattern if we examine a sequence
of numbers instead of letters.
Solution
The letter A is the 1st letter of the alphabet, D is the 4th letter, B is the 2nd letter,
and so on.We can create the following letter–number correspondence:
Letter
Number
A
1
D
4

B
2
Subtract 2.
E
5
Add 3.
C
3
Subtract 2.
F
6
Add 3.
D
4
Subtract 2.
The numbers in the sequence 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4, . . . alternate in size.They change
from smaller to larger, to smaller, to larger, and so on.
We see that 3 is added to the ﬁrst number to get the second number.Then 2 is
subtracted from the second number to get the third number. To get successive
numbers in the sequence, we alternately add 3 to one number and then subtract 2
from that result to get the next number.
Applying this pattern, the next number in the given numerical sequence would
be 4  3, or 7.The next letter in the original sequence would be G, because it is the
7th letter of the alphabet.

EXAMPLE 4
Find the next shape in the sequence below.
Strategy To ﬁnd the next shape in the sequence, we will focus on the changing
positions of the dots.
WHY The star does not change in any way from term to term.
Solution
We see that each of the three dots moves from one point of the star
to the next, in a counterclockwise direction. This is a circular
pattern.The next shape in the sequence will be the one shown here.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Use deductive reasoning to solve problems.
As opposed to inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning moves from the general case
to the speciﬁc. For example, if we know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is
180°, we know that the sum of the angles of ^ABC shown in the right margin is 180°.
Whenever we apply a general principle to a particular instance, we are using deductive
reasoning.
A deductive reasoning system is built on four elements:
1.
Undeﬁned terms: terms that we accept without giving them formal meaning
2.
Deﬁned terms: terms that we deﬁne in a formal way
3.
Axioms or postulates: statements that we accept without proof
4.
Theorems: statements that we can prove with formal reasoning
Many problems can be solved by deductive reasoning. For example, suppose a
student knows that his college offers algebra classes in the morning, afternoon, and
evening and that Professors Anderson, Medrano, and Ling are the only algebra
instructors at the school. Furthermore, suppose that the student plans to enroll in a
morning algebra class. After some investigating, he ﬁnds out that Professor Anderson
teaches only in the afternoon and Professor Ling teaches only in the evening.Without
knowing anything about Professor Medrano, he can conclude that she will be his
algebra teacher, since she is the only remaining possibility.
The following examples show how to use deductive reasoning to solve problems.

EXAMPLE 5
Find the next shape in the sequence below.
Strategy To ﬁnd the next shape in the sequence, we must consider two changing
patterns at the same time.
WHY The shapes are changing and the number of dots within them are changing.
Solution
The ﬁrst ﬁgure has three sides and one dot,the second ﬁgure has four
sides and two dots, and the third ﬁgure has ﬁve sides and three dots.
Thus, we would expect the next ﬁgure to have six sides and four dots,
as shown to the right.

Scheduling Classes
An online college offers only one
calculus course, one algebra course, one statistics course, and one trigonometry
course.Each course is to be taught by a different professor.The four professors who
will teach these courses have the following course preferences:
1.
Professors A and B don’t want to teach calculus.
2.
Professor C wants to teach statistics.
3.
Professor B wants to teach algebra.
Who will teach trigonometry?
Strategy We will construct a table showing all the possible teaching assignments.
Then we will cross off those classes that the professors do not want to teach.

WHY The best way to examine this much information is to describe the situation
using a table.
Solution
The following table shows each course, with each possible instructor.
Since Professors A and B don’t want to teach calculus, we can cross them off
the calculus list. Since Professor C wants to teach statistics, we can cross her off
every other list.This leaves Professor D as the only person to teach calculus, so we
can cross her off every other list. Since Professor B wants to teach algebra, we can
cross him off every other list. Thus, the only remaining person left to teach
trigonometry is Professor A.

State Flags
The graph
below gives the number of state ﬂags that
feature an eagle, a star, or both. How many
state ﬂags have neither an eagle nor a star?
Strategy We will use two intersecting circles to model this situation.
WHY The intersection is a way to represent the number of state ﬂags that have
both an eagle and a star.
Solution
In ﬁgure (a) on the following page, the intersection (overlap) of the circles shows
that there are 5 state ﬂags that have both an eagle and a star. If an eagle appears on
a total of 10 ﬂags, then the red circle must contain 5 more ﬂags outside of the

intersection, as shown in ﬁgure (b). If a total of 27 ﬂags have a star, the blue circle
must contain 22 more ﬂags outside the intersection, as shown.
From ﬁgure (a),we see that 5  5  22,or 32 ﬂags have an eagle,a star,or both.
To ﬁnd how many ﬂags have neither an eagle nor a star, we subtract this total from
the number of state ﬂags, which is 50.

There are 18 state ﬂags that have neither an eagle nor a star.
