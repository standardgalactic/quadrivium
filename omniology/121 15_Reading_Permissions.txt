Understanding
Permissions

Unix and unix-like systems are multiuser operating
systems.  More than one person can be using the same
computer at the same time (though this is tough
logistically with only one display and keyboard!)
Way back when, computers were crazy expensive,
massive machines.  A university might only have one
computer, but dozens of terminals sprinkled across
campus.
Multiple Users

As regular users, we do not have permission to write or
even read every file on the machine.
For example, if I try to read the  file /etc/sudoers using
cat /etc/sudoers I get a "permission denied" message.
Permission Denied?!
cat /etc/sudoers
❯
Permission denied

On unix systems, a single user may be the owner of files
and directories, meaning that they have control over
their access.
Additionally, users can belong to groups which are
given access to particular files and folders by their
owners.
Groups

When a new user account is made, it is
assigned a user ID.  The user is also assigned
a group ID.  
We can use the id command to view user and
group ids.
These user ids are stored in /etc/passwd,
and the group ids are in /etc/group

File Attributes
-rw-rw-r--
The weird looking 10 characters we see
printed out first are the file attributes. 
These characters tell us the type of the file,
the read, write, and execute permissions for
the file's owner, the file's group owner, and
everyone else.

File Type
-rw-rw-r--
The very first character indicates the type of
the file.  Some of the more common types and
their corresponding attributes are:
-   regular file
d  directory
c  character special file
l   symbolic link
drwxr-xr-x

Permissions
Character
Effect On Files
file can be read
file can be modified
file can be treated as a
program to be executed
file cannot be read, modified,
or executed depending on the
location of the - character
Effect On Directories
directory's contents can be listed
directory's contents can be modified (create new
files, rename files/folders) but only if the
executable attribute is also set
allows a directory to be entered or "cd"ed into
directory contents cannot be shown, modified, or
cd'ed into depending on the location of the -
character
r
w
x
-

-rw-------
Owner
In the above example, we see that the file's
owner has read and write permissions but NOT
execute permissions
No one else has any access

-rwx------
Owner
In the above example, we see that the file's
owner has read, write, AND execute permissions.
No one else has any access

-rw-r--r--
Owner
In the above example, we see that the file's owner has
read, and write BUT NOT execute permissions.
Members of the file's owner group can only read the file
Everyone else can read the file too.
Group World

drwxrwx---
Owner
In the above example, we see that the directory's owner
AND member's of the owner group can enter the directory,
rename, and remove files from within the directory
Group World

drwx--x---
Owner
In the above example, we see that the directory's owner
can enter the directory, rename, and remove files from
within the directory.
Members of the owner group can enter the directory but
cannot create, delete, or rename files.
Group World
