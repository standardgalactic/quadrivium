About the Author
A graduate of Brown University and the University of Wisconsin Law School, Mark Ryan
has been teaching math since 1989. He runs the Math Center in Winnetka, Illinois (www.the
mathcenter.com), where he teaches high school math courses including an introduction to
calculus and a workshop for parents based on a program he developed, The 10 Habits of
Highly Successful Math Students. In high school, he twice scored a perfect 800 on the math
portion of the SAT, and he not only knows mathematics, he has a gift for explaining it in plain
English. He practiced law for four years before deciding he should do something he enjoys
and use his natural talent for mathematics. Ryan is a member of the Authors Guild and the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
Calculus Workbook For Dummies is Ryan’s third book. Everyday Math for Everyday Life was

Author’s Acknowledgments
My agent Sheree Bykofsky of Sheree Bykofsky Associates, Inc., has represented me now on
three successful books. Her ability to make connections in the publishing world and to close
deals — and to see the forest when I might be looking at the trees — has made her invaluable. 
Many thanks to my bright, professional, and computer-savvy assistants, Benjamin Mumford,
Randy Claussen, and Caroline DeVane. And a special thanks to the multi-talented Amanda
Wasielewski who did everything from typing the book’s technical equations to creating 
diagrams to keeping the project organized to checking the calculus content.
Gene Schwartz, President of Consortium House, publishing consultants, and an expert in 
all aspects of publishing, gave me valuable advice for my contract negotiations. My friend,
Beverly Wright, psychoacoustician and writer extraordinaire, was also a big help with 
the contract negotiations. She gave me astute and much needed advice and was generous
with her time. I’m grateful to my consultant, Josh Lowitz, Adjunct Associate Professor of
Entrepreneurship at the University of Chicago School of Business. He advised me on every
phase of the book’s production. His insights into my writing career and other aspects of my
business, and his accessibility, might make you think I was his only client instead of one of 
a couple dozen.
This book is a testament to the high standards of everyone at Wiley Publishing. Special
thanks to Joyce Pepple, Acquisitions Director, who handled our contract negotiations with
intelligence, honesty, and fairness, and to Acquisitions Editor Kathy Cox, who deftly com-
bined praise with a touch of gentle prodding to keep me on schedule. Technical Editor Dale
Johnson did an excellent and thorough job spotting and correcting the errors that appeared
in the book’s first draft — some of which would be very hard or impossible to find without an
expert’s knowledge of calculus. The layout and graphics team did a fantastic job with the
book’s thousands of complex equations and mathematical figures.
Finally, the book would not be what it is without the contributions of Project Editor Laura
Peterson-Nussbaum. She’s an intelligent and skilled editor with a great sense of language
and balance. And she has the ability to tactfully suggest creative changes — most of which I
adopted — without interfering with my idiosyncratic style. It was a pleasure to work with her.

Calculus Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
I
f you’ve already bought this book or are thinking about buying it, it’s probably too late —
too late, that is, to change your mind and get the heck out of calculus. (If you’ve still got
a chance to break free, get out and run for the hills!) Okay, so you’re stuck with calculus;
you’re past the point of no return. Is there any hope? Of course! For starters, buy this gem
of a book and my other classic, Calculus For Dummies. In both books, you find calculus
explained in plain English with a minimum of technical jargon. Calculus For Dummies covers
topics in greater depth. Calculus Workbook For Dummies gives you the opportunity to
master the calculus topics you study in class or in Calculus For Dummies through a couple
hundred practice problems that will leave you giddy with the joy of learning . . . or pulling
your hair out.
In all seriousness, calculus is not nearly as difficult as you’d guess from its reputation. It’s a
logical extension of algebra and geometry, and many calculus topics can be easily under-
stood when you see the algebra and geometry that underlie them.
It should go without saying that regardless of how well you think you understand calculus,
you won’t fully understand it until you get your hands dirty by actually doing problems. On
that score, you’ve come to the right place.
About This Book
Calculus Workbook For Dummies, like Calculus For Dummies, is intended for three groups of
readers: high school seniors or college students in their first calculus course, students who’ve
taken calculus but who need a refresher to get ready for other pursuits, and adults of all ages
who want to practice the concepts they learned in Calculus For Dummies or elsewhere.
Whenever possible, I bring the calculus here down to earth by showing its connections to basic
algebra and geometry. Many calculus problems look harder than they actually are because
they contain so many fancy, foreign-looking symbols. When you see that the problems aren’t
that different from related algebra and geometry problems, they become far less intimidating.
I supplement the problem explanations with tips, shortcuts, and mnemonic devices. Often, a
simple tip or memory trick can make it much easier to learn and retain a new, difficult concept.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book uses certain conventions:
 Variables are in italics.
 Important math terms are often in italics and defined when necessary.
 In the solution section, I’ve given your eyes a rest and not bolded all the numbered
steps as is typical in For Dummies books.
 Extra hard problems are marked with an asterisk. You may want to skip these if you’re
prone to cerebral hemorrhaging.

How to Use This Book
Like all For Dummies books, you can use this book as a reference. You don’t need to
read it cover to cover or work through all problems in order. You may need more prac-
tice in some areas than others, so you may choose to do only half of the practice prob-
lems in some sections, or none at all.
However, as you’d expect, the order of the topics in Calculus Workbook For Dummies
follows the order of the traditional curriculum of a first-year calculus course. You can,
therefore, go through the book in order, using it to supplement your coursework. If I do
say so myself, I expect you’ll find that many of the explanations, methods, strategies,
and tips in this book will make problems you found difficult or confusing in class seem
much easier.
Foolish Assumptions
Now that you know a bit about how I see calculus, here’s what I’m assuming about you:
 You haven’t forgotten all the algebra, geometry, and trigonometry you learned 
in high school. If you have, calculus will be really tough. Just about every single
calculus problem involves algebra, a great many use trig, and quite a few use
geometry. If you’re really rusty, go back to these basics and do some brushing
up. This book contains some practice problems to give you a little pre-calc
refresher, and Calculus For Dummies has an excellent pre-calc review.
 You’re willing to invest some time and effort in doing these practice problems.
Like with anything, practice makes perfect, and, also like anything, practice
sometimes involves struggle. But that’s a good thing. Ideally, you should give
these problems your best shot before you turn to the solutions. Reading through
the solutions can be a good way to learn, but you’ll usually learn more if you
push yourself to solve the problems on your own — even if that means going
down a few dead ends.
How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies books, this one is divided into parts, the parts into chapters, and
the chapters into topics. Remarkable!
Part I: Pre-Calculus Review
Part I is a brief review of the algebra, geometry, functions, and trigonometry that you’ll
need for calculus. You simply can’t do calculus without a working knowledge of alge-
bra and functions because virtually every single calculus problem involves both of
these pre-calc topics in some way or another. You might say that algebra is the lan-
guage calculus is written in and that functions are the objects that calculus analyzes.
Geometry and trig are not quite as critical because you could do some calculus with-
out them, but a great number of calculus problems and topics involve geometry and
trig. If your pre-calc is rusty, get out the Rust-Oleum.

Calculus Workbook For Dummies 

Part II: Limits and Continuity
You can actually do most practical calculus problems without knowing much about
limits and continuity. The calculus done by scientists, engineers, and economists
involves differential and integral calculus (see Parts III and IV), not limits and continu-
ity. But because mathematicians do care about limits and continuity and because
they’re the ones who write calculus texts and design calculus curricula, you have to
learn these topics.
Obviously, I’m being a bit cynical here. Limits and continuity are sort of the logical
scaffolding that holds calculus up, and, as such, they’re topics worthy of your time
and effort.
Part III: Differentiation
Differentiation and integration (Part IV) are the two big ideas in calculus. Differentiation
is the study of the derivative, or slope, of functions: where the slope is positive, nega-
tive, or zero; where the slope has a minimum or maximum value; whether the slope 
is increasing or decreasing; how the slope of one function is related to the slope of
another; and so on. In Part III, you get differentiation basics, differentiation rules, and
techniques for analyzing the shape of curves, and solving problems with the derivative. 
Part IV: Integration and Infinite Series
Like differentiation, “integration” is a fancy word for a simple idea: addition. Every 
integration problem involves addition in one way or another. What makes integration
such a big deal is that it enables you to add up an infinite number of infinitely small
amounts. Using the magic of limits, integration cuts up something (an area, a volume,
the pressure on the wall of a tank, and so on) into infinitely small chunks and then
adds up the chunks to arrive at the total. In Part IV, you work through integration
basics, techniques for finding integrals, and problem solving with integration.
Infinite series is a fascinating topic full of bizarre, counter-intuitive results, like the infi-
nitely long trumpet shape that has an infinite surface area but a finite volume! — hard
to believe but true. Your task with infinite series problems is to decide whether the sum
of an infinitely long list of numbers adds up to infinity (something that’s easy to imag-
ine) or to some ordinary, finite number (something many people find hard to imagine).
Part V: The Part of Tens
Here you get ten things you should know about limits and infinite series, ten things
you should know about differentiation, and ten things you should know about integra-
tion. If you find yourself knowing no calculus with your calc final coming up in 24
hours (perhaps because you were listening to Marilyn Manson on your iPod during
class and did all your assignments in a “study” group), turn to the Part of Tens and the
Cheat Sheet. If you learn only this material — not an approach I’d recommend — you
may actually be able to barely survive your exam.

Icons Used in This Book
The icons help you to quickly find some of the most critical ideas in the book.
Next to this icon are important pre-calc or calculus definitions, theorems, and so on.
This icon is next to — are you sitting down? — example problems.
The tip icon gives you shortcuts, memory devices, strategies, and so on.
Ignore these icons and you’ll be doing lots of extra work and probably getting the
wrong answer.
Where to Go from Here
You can go
 To Chapter 1 — or to whatever chapter you need to practice.
 To Calculus For Dummies for more in-depth explanations. Then, because after fin-
ishing it and this workbook your newly acquired calculus expertise will at least
double or triple your sex appeal, pick up French For Dummies and Wine For
Dummies to impress Nanette or Jéan Paul.
 With the flow.
 To the head of the class, of course.
 Nowhere. There’s nowhere to go. After mastering calculus, your life is complete.

Calculus Workbook For Dummies 

Part I
Pre-Calculus Review

In this part . . .
M
ost of mathematics is cumulative — you can’t do
calculus without a solid knowledge of pre-calc.
Obviously, there’s much more to pre-calc than what’s cov-
ered in the two short chapters of Part I, but if you’re up to
speed with the concepts covered here, you’re in pretty
good shape to begin the study of calculus. You really
should be very comfortable with all this material, so work
through the practice problems in Chapters 1 and 2, and if
you find yourself on shaky ground, go back to your old
textbooks (assuming you didn’t burn them) or to the thor-
ough pre-calc review in Calculus For Dummies to fill in any
gaps in your knowledge of algebra, geometry, functions,
and trig. Now you finally have an answer to the question
you asked during high school math classes: “When am I
ever going to need this?” Unfortunately, now there’s the
new question: “When am I ever going to need calculus?”

Chapter 1
Getting Down the Basics: 
Algebra and Geometry
In This Chapter
 Fussing with fractions
 Brushing up on basic algebra
 Getting square with geometry
I
know, I know. This is a calculus workbook, so what’s with the algebra and geometry? Don’t
worry, I’m not going to waste too many precious pages with algebra and geometry, but
these topics are essential for calculus. You can no more do calculus without algebra than you
can write French poetry without French. And basic geometry (but not geometry proofs —
hooray!) is critically important because much of calculus involves real-world problems that
include angles, slopes, shapes, and so on. So in this chapter — and in Chapter 2 on functions
and trigonometry — I give you some quick problems to help you brush up on your skills. If
you’ve already got these topics down pat, skip on over to Chapter 3.
If you miss some questions and don’t quite understand why, go back to your old textbooks
or check out the great pre-calc review in Calculus For Dummies. Getting these basics down
pat is really important.
Fraction Frustration
Many, many math students hate fractions. Maybe the concepts didn’t completely click when
they first learned them and so fractions then became a nagging frustration in every subse-
quent math course.
But you can’t do calculus without a good grasp of fractions. For example, the very definition
of the derivative is based on a fraction called the difference quotient. And, on top of that, the 
symbol for the derivative, dx
dy , is a fraction. So, if you’re a bit rusty with fractions, get up to 
speed with the following problems ASAP — or else!

Geometry: When Am I Ever Going to Need It?
You can use calculus to solve many real-world problems that involve surfaces, volumes,
and shapes, such as maximizing the volume of a cylindrical soup can or determining
the stress along a cable hanging in a parabolic shape. So you’ve got to know the basic
geometry formulas for length, area, and volume. You also need to know basic stuff like
the Pythagorean Theorem, proportional shapes, and basic coordinate geometry like the
distance formula.

0
5 = . 0
5 is undefined! Don’t mix this up with something like 8
0 , which equals zero. Note 
that if you think about these two fractions as examples of slope ( run
rise), 0
5 has a rise of 5 and a 
run of 0 which gives you a vertical line that has sort of an infinite steepness or slope (that’s why
it’s undefined). Or just remember that it’s impossible to drive up a vertical road and so it’s 
impossible to come up with a slope for a vertical line. The fraction 8
0 , on the other hand, has a 
rise of 0 and a run of 8, which gives you a horizontal line that has no steepness at all and thus
has the perfectly ordinary slope of zero. Of course, it’s also perfectly ordinary to drive on a 
horizontal road.

When you’re working a problem and can’t remember the algebra rule, try the problem with
numbers instead of variables. Just replace the variables with simple, round numbers and work
out the numerical problem. (Don’t use 0, 1, or 2 because they have special properties that can
mess up your example.) Whatever works for the numbers will work with variables, and what-
ever doesn’t work with numbers won’t work with variables. Watch what happens if you try this
problem with numbers:

n Chapter 2, you continue your pre-calc warm-up that you began in Chapter 1. If algebra is
the language calculus is written in, you might think of functions as the “sentences” of cal-
culus. And they’re as important to calculus as sentences are to writing. You can’t do calculus
without functions. Trig is important not because it’s an essential element of calculus — you
could do most of calculus without trig — but because many calculus problems happen to
involve trigonometry.
Figuring Out Your Functions
To make a long story short, a function is basically anything you can graph on your graphing
calculator in “ y =” or graphing mode. The line y
x
3
2
=
-
is a function, as is the parabola
y
x
x

6
2
=
-
+
. On the other hand, the sideways parabola x
y
y
3
4
6
2
=
-
+
isn’t a function
because there’s no way to write it as y = something. Try it.
You can determine whether or not the graph of a curve is a function with the vertical line test.
If there’s no place on the graph where you could draw a vertical line that touches the curve
more than once, then it is a function. And if you can draw a vertical line anywhere on the
graph that touches the curve more than once, then it is not a function.
As you know, you can rewrite the above functions using “f
x
^ h” or “g x
^ h” instead of “y.” This
changes nothing; using something like f
x
^ h is just a convenient notation. Here’s a sampling
of calculus functions:

Trigonometric Calisthenics
Believe it or not, trig is a very practical, real-world branch of mathematics, because it
involves the measurement of lengths and angles. Surveyors use it when surveying prop-
erty, making topographical maps, and so on. The ancient Greeks and Alexandrians,
among others, knew not only simple SohCahToa stuff, but a lot of sophisticated trig as
well. They used it for building, navigation, and astronomy. It’s all over the place in the
study of calculus, so if you snoozed through high school trig, WAKE UP! and review the
following problems. (If you want to delve further into trig (and functions), check out
Calculus For Dummies.)

Solutions to Functions and Trigonometry
a
Which of the four relations in the figure represent functions and why? A and D.
The circle and the S-shaped curve are not functions because they fail the vertical line test: You
can draw a vertical line somewhere on their graphs that touches the curve more than once.
These two curves also fail the algebraic test: A curve is a function if for each input value (x)
there is at most one output value (y). The circle and the S-shaped curve have some xs that cor-
respond to more than one y so they are not functions. Note that the reverse is not true: You can
have a function where there are two or more input values (xs) for a single output value (y).

what you’d expect. The “ + 5” in q(x) tells you to go up 5. 
Horizontal transformations always work opposite the way you’d expect. Vertical

Limits and Continuity

In this part . . .
I
saac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, co-inventors of cal-
culus in the late 17th century, did calculus without the
solid foundation provided by limits and continuity. Now,
since Newton and Leibniz were merely two of the greatest
geniuses who ever lived, you don’t want to do math at their
lowly level, do you? Of course not! You want your calculus
to be mathematically rigorous, and for that you need to
master limits and continuity — despite their almost com-
plete lack of practical importance. Now, don’t blame me for
this — heck, if practical relevance is your standard, you
might as well drop out of school all together. Actually, the
study of limits (and to a much lesser extent continuity) can
be fascinating. And in the event that you hail from the
show-me state, limits will allow you to prove that in a race
against a tortoise where you give the tortoise a head start,
you actually will catch up to and then pass the tortoise.
The things that mathematics allows you to accomplish!

A Graph Is Worth a Thousand Words:
Limits and Continuity
In This Chapter
 The mathematical mumbo jumbo of limits and continuity
 When limits exist and don’t exist
 Discontinuity. . . or graphus interruptus
You can use ordinary algebra and geometry when the things in a math problem aren’t
changing (sort of) and when lines are straight. But you need calculus when things are
changing (these changing things are often represented as curves). For example, you need
calculus to analyze something like the motion of the space shuttle during the beginning of
its flight because its acceleration is changing every split second.
Ordinary algebra and geometry fall short for such things because the algebra or geometry
formula that works one moment no longer works a millionth of a second later. Calculus, on
the other hand, chops up these constantly changing things — like the motion of the space
shuttle — into such tiny bits (actually infinitely small bits) that within each bit, things don’t
change. Then you can use ordinary algebra and geometry.
Limits are the “magical” trick or tool that does this chopping up of something into infinitely
small bits. It’s the mathematics of limits that makes calculus work. Limits are so essential
that the formal definitions of the derivative and the definite integral both involve limits.
If — when your parents or other adults asked you, “What do you want to be when you grow
up?” — you responded, “Why, a mathematician, of course,” then you may ultimately spend a
great deal of time thoroughly studying the deep and rich subtleties of continuity. For the rest
of you, the concept of continuity is a total no-brainer. If you can draw a graph without lifting
your pen or pencil from the page, the graph is continuous. If you can’t — because there’s a
break in the graph — then the graph is not continuous. That’s all there is to it. By the way,
there are some subtle and technical connections between limits and continuity (which I
don’t want to get into), and that’s why they’re in the same chapter. But, be honest now,
did you buy this book because you were dying to learn about mathematical subtleties and
technicalities? 
Digesting the Definitions: Limit and Continuity
This short section covers a couple formal definitions and a couple other things you need to
know about limits and continuity. Here’s the formal, three-part definition of a limit:

For a function f
x
^ h and a real number a, lim f
x
x
a
"
^ h exists if and only if

h The limit from the left must equal the limit from the right.
(Note that this definition does not apply to limits as x approaches infinity or negative
infinity.)
And here’s the definition of continuity: A function f
x

a
=
if
three conditions are satisfied:
1. f a

Solutions for Limits and Continuity
a
At which of the following x-values are all three requirements for the existence of a limit satis-
fied, and what is the limit at those x-values? x = –2, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11.
At 0, the limit is 2.
At 4, the limit is 5.
At 8, the limit is 3.
At 10, the limit is 5.
To make a long story short, a limit exists at a particular x-value of a curve when the curve is
heading toward an exact y-value and keeps heading toward that y-value as you continue to zoom
in on the curve at the x-value. The curve must head toward that y-value from the right and from
the left (unless the limit is one where x approaches infinity). I emphasize “heading toward”
because what happens precisely at the given x-value isn’t relevant to this limit inquiry. That’s
why there is a limit at a hole like the ones at x = 8 and 10.
b
For the rest of the x-values, state which of the three limit requirements are not satisfied. If one
or both one-sided limits exist at any of these x-values, give the value of the one-sided limit.
At –2 and 5, all three conditions fail.
At 2, 6, and 11, only the third requirement is not satisfied.
At 2, the limit from the left equals 5 and the limit from the right equals 3.
At 6, the limit from the left is 2 and the limit from the right is 3.

c
At which of the x-values are all three requirements for continuity satisfied? 
The function in Figure 3-1 is continuous at 0 and 4. The common-sense way of thinking about
continuity is that a curve is continuous wherever you can draw the curve without taking your
pen off the paper. It should be obvious that that’s true at 0 and 4, but not at any of the other
listed x-values.
d
For the rest of the x-values, state which of the three continuity requirements are not satisfied.
All listed x-values other than 0 and 4 are points of discontinuity. A discontinuity is just a high-
falutin’ calculus way of saying a gap. If you’d have to take your pen off the paper at some point
when drawing a curve, then the curve has a discontinuity there.
At 5 and 11, all three conditions fail.
At –2, 2, and 6, continuity requirements 2 and 3 are not satisfied.
At 10, requirements 1 and 3 are not satisfied.
At 8, requirement 3 is not satisfied.

like with question 7 where the hole was irrelevant.
j
List the x-coordinates of all points of discontinuity of f and state whether the points of disconti-
nuity are removable or non-removable, and state the type of discontinuity — removable, jump,
or infinite.
At x = –7, the vertical asymptote, there is a non-removable, infinite discontinuity.
At x = 5 there’s a non-removable, jump discontinuity.
At x = 13 and x = 18 there are holes which are removable discontinuities. Though infinitely
small, these are nevertheless discontinuities. They’re “removable” discontinuities because you
can “fix” the function by plugging the holes. 
k
lim sinx

it never settles down to one exact y-value. (The three-part definition of a limit does not apply to
limits at infinity.)

. In contrast to sinx, this function does hone in on a single value; as you go out 
further and further to the right, the function gets closer and closer to zero, so that’s the limit.

I
n this chapter, you practice two very different methods for solving limit problems: using
algebra and using your calculator. Learning the algebraic techniques are valuable for two
reasons. The first, incredibly important reason is that the mathematics involved in the alge-
braic methods is beautiful, pure, and rigorous; and, second — something so trivial that per-
haps I shouldn’t mention it — you’ll be tested on it. Do I have my priorities straight or what?
The calculator techniques are useful for several reasons: 1) You can solve some limit prob-
lems on your calculator that are either impossible or just very difficult to do with algebra,
2) You can check your algebraic answers with your calculator, and 3) Limit problems can 
be solved with a calculator when you’re not required to show your work — like maybe on a
multiple choice test.
But before we get to these two major techniques, how about a little rote learning. A few limits
are a bit tricky to justify or prove, so to make life easier, simply commit them to memory.
Here they are:
 limc
c

(y = c is a horizontal 
line, so the limit equals 
c regardless of the 
arrow-number — the 
constant after the arrow.)

Solving Limits with Algebra
You can solve limit problems with several algebraic techniques. But your first step should
always be plugging the arrow-number into the limit expression. If you get a number, that’s
the answer. You’re done. You’re also done if plugging in the arrow-number gives you
 A number or infinity or negative infinity over zero, like 0
3 , or 0
!3 ; in these cases
the limit does not exist (DNE).
 Zero over infinity; the answer is zero.

When plugging in fails because it gives you 0
0 , you’ve got a real limit problem, and you 
have to convert the fraction into some expression where plugging in does work. Here
are some algebraic methods you can try:
 FOILing
 Factoring
 Finding the least common denominator
 Canceling
 Simplification
 Conjugate multiplication
The following examples each use a different method to solve the limit.

Pulling Out Your Calculator: 
Useful “Cheating”
Your calculator is a great tool for understanding limits. It can often give you a better
feel for how a limit works than the algebraic techniques can. A limit problem asks you
to determine what the y-value of a function is zeroing in on as the x-value approaches a
particular number. With your calculator, you can actually witness the process and the
result. You can solve a limit problem with you calculator in three different ways. 
Method I. First, store a number into x that’s extremely close to the arrow-number,
enter the limit expression in the home screen, and hit enter. If you get a result really
close to a round number, that’s your answer — you’re done. If you have any doubt
about the answer, just store another number into x that’s even closer to the arrow-
number and hit enter again. This will likely give you a result even closer to the same
round number — that’s it, you’ve got it. This method can be the quickest, but it often
doesn’t give you a good feel for how the y-values zero in on the result. To get a better
picture of this process, you can store three or four numbers into x (one after another),
each a bit closer to the arrow-number, and look at the sequence of results.
Method II. Enter the limit expression in graphing or “y =” mode, go to Table Setup, set
Tblstart to the arrow-number, and set ∆Tbl to something small like 0.01 or 0.001. When
you look at the table, you’ll often see the y-values getting closer and closer to the limit
answer as x hones in on the arrow-number. If it’s not clear what the y-values are
approaching, try a smaller increment for the ∆Tbl number. This method often gives
you a good feel for what’s happening in a limit problem.
Method III. This method gives you the best visual understanding of how a limit works.
Enter the limit expression in graphing or “y =” mode. (If you’re using the second
method, you may want to try this third method at the same time.) Next, graph the
function, and then go into the window and tweak the xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax set-
tings, if necessary, so that the part of the function corresponding to the arrow-number
is within the viewing window. Use the trace feature to trace along the function until you
get close to the arrow-number. You can’t trace exactly onto the arrow-number because
there’s a little hole in the function there, the height of which, by the way, is your
answer. When you trace close to the arrow-number, the y-value will get close to the
limit answer. Use the ZoomBox feature to draw a little box around the part of the graph
containing the arrow-number and zoom in until you see that the y-values are getting
very close to a round number — that’s your answer.

3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 6.001
stored into x.
This gives you a result of ~7.001.
4. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 with 6.0001
stored into x.
This gives you a result of ~7.0001.
Because the results are obviously
honing in on the round number of 7,
that’s your answer.

viewing, ZoomStd, ZoomFit, and
ZoomTrig (for expressions contain-
ing trig functions) are good win-
dows to try.
For this funny function, none of
these three window options works
very well, but ZoomStd is the best.
3. Trace close to x = 6 and you’ll see
that y is near 7. Use ZoomBox to
draw a little box around the point
,
6 7
_
i then hit enter.
4. Trace near x = 6 on this zoomed-in
graph until you get very near to 
x = 6.
5. Repeat the Zoombox process
maybe two more times and you
should be able to trace extremely
close to x = 6.
(When I did this, I could trace to 
x = 6.0000022, y = 7.0000023.)
The answer is 7.

Making Yourself a Limit Sandwich
The sandwich or squeeze method is something you can try when you can’t solve a limit
problem with algebra. The basic idea is to find one function that’s always greater than
the limit function (at least near the arrow-number) and another function that’s always
less than the limit function. Both of your new functions must have the same limit as x
approaches the arrow-number. Then, because the limit function is “sandwiched”
between the other two, like salami between slices of bread, it must have that same
limit as well. See Figure 4-1.

A.
The limit is 0.
1. Try plugging in 0. No good, you get
0 over 0.
You should be able to solve this
limit problem with algebra. But let’s
say you tried and failed so now
you’re going to try the sandwich
method.
2. Graph the function.
Looks like the limit as x approaches
0 is 0. 
3. To prove it, try to find two bread
functions that both have a limit of
0 as x approaches 0.
It’s easy to show that the function is
always positive (except perhaps at
x = 0) so you can use the simple
function y = 0 as the bottom slice of
bread. Of course, it’s obvious that
lim0
0
x
0
=

. Finding a function for the 
top slice is harder. But let’s just say
that for some mysterious reason,
you know that y
x
=
is greater 
than 
x
x
3
near the arrow-number — 
the only place that matters for
the sandwich method. Because 
lim
x

x

, y
x
=
makes a good 
top slice.
You’re done. Because 
x
x

is 
squeezed between y = 0 and 
y
x

, both of which have limits of 
0 as x approaches 0, 
x
x

must also
have a limit of 0.

l, you can use the same techniques from the 
bulleted list in the “Solving Limits with Algebra” section of this chapter in order to
change the limit expression so that you can plug in and solve.

), the limit will be the same as the y-value 
of the function’s horizontal asymptote, which is an imaginary line that a curve gets closer
and closer to as it goes right, left, up, or down toward infinity or negative infinity. Here
are the two cases where this works:
 Case 1: If the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is less than the degree of
the polynomial in the denominator, there’s a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 and
the limit as x approaches 3 or 3
-
is 0 as well. 
 Case 2: If the degrees of the two polynomials are equal, there’s a horizontal
asymptote at the number you get when you divide the coefficient of the highest
power term in the numerator by the coefficient of the highest power term in the
denominator. This number is the answer to the limit as x approaches infinity or
negative infinity. By the way, if the degree of the numerator is greater than the
degree of the denominator, there’s no horizontal asymptote and no limit.

Consider the following four types of expressions: x
10, 5
x, 
!
x , and x
x. If a limit at infinity
involves a fraction with one of them over another, you can apply a handy little tip.
These four expressions are listed from “smallest” to “biggest.” (This isn’t a true order-
ing; it’s only for problems of this type; and note that the actual numbers don’t matter;
they could just as easily be x
8, 3
x, 
!
x , and x
x.) The limit will equal 0 if you have a
“smaller” expression over a “bigger” one, and the limit will equal infinity if you have a
“bigger” expression over a “smaller” one. And this rule is not affected by coefficients. 
For example, 
!
lim

and lim

like (2x)! can change the ordering.

A.
The limit is 0.
This is an example of a “small” expression
over a “big” one, so the answer is 0. Perhaps
this result surprises you. You may think
that this fraction will keep getting bigger
and bigger because it seems that no matter
what power 1.01 is raised to, it will never
grow very large. And, in fact, if you plug
1000 into x, the quotient is big — over 
47,000. But if you enter .

resembles the one in problem 10. Still stuck? Okay, here you go:
1. Multiply numerator and denominator by 3.
You’ve got a 3x in the denominator, so you need 3x in the numerator as well (to make the frac-
tion look more like the one in problem 10).

n is “bounded” (bounded by –1 and 1). Then, because zero × bounded = zero,
the limit is 0. Don’t try this logic with you calc teacher — he won’t like it.
Second, you can use your calculator: Store something small like .1 into x and then input sin
x
x

into your home screen and hit enter. You should get a result of 
.05

and use the entry button to get back to sin

.003

. Now 
try .001, then .0001 (giving you

.00009

) and so on. It’s pretty clear — though
probably not to the satisfaction of your professor — that the limit is 0.
The third way will definitely satisfy those typically persnickety professors. You’ve got to 
sandwich (or squeeze) your salami function, sin

identical limits as x approaches the same arrow-number it approaches in the salami function.

x
x

2 will never get bigger than 
x or smaller than

According to the “big” over “small” tip, this answer must be infinity. Or you can get this result with
your calculator. If you set the table (don’t forget: fork on the left, spoon on the right) the same as 
in problem 19, you’ll see “undef” for all y values. You’ve got to be careful when trying to interpret
what “undef” (for “undefined”) means on your calculator, but in this case — because a 0 denomina-
tor is impossible and thus can’t be the reason the fraction is undefined — it looks like “undef”
means infinity. To confirm this, make tblStart and ∆tbl smaller, say, 10. Sure enough, the y values
grow huge very fast, and you can safely conclude that the limit is infinity.

Part III
Differentiation

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you begin calculus in earnest. Differentiation
is the first of the two big ideas in calculus (integration
is the second). With all the mystique surrounding calculus,
you may think that differentiation is as difficult a subject
as string theory or ancient Sanskrit. But differentiation is
simply the fancy calculus term for slope, which, as you
remember from algebra I, is just the steepness of a line.
Whenever possible, remind yourself that every problem
involving differentiation is really just a slope problem. In
Part III, you get differentiation basics, differentiation rules,
techniques for using the derivative to analyze the shape of
curves, and methods for solving practical problems with
the derivative.

D
ifferentiation is the process of finding derivatives. The derivative is one of the most
important inventions in the history of mathematics and one of mathematics’ most
powerful tools. I’m sure you will feel both a deep privilege as you do the practice problems
below — and a keen sense of indebtedness to the great mathematicians of the past. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.
The Derivative: A Fancy Calculus 
Word for Slope and Rate
A derivative of a function tells you how fast the output variable (like y) is changing compared
to the input variable (like x). For example, if y is increasing 3 times as fast as x — like with the
line y
x
3
5
=
+
— then you say that the derivative of y with respect to x equals 3, and you 
write dx
dy
3
=
. This, of course, is the same as dx
dy
1
3
=
, and that means nothing more than 
saying that the rate of change of y compared to x is 3-to-1, or that the line has a slope of 1
3 . 
The following problems emphasize the fact that a derivative is basically just a rate or a slope.
So to solve these problems, all you have to do is answer the questions as if they had asked
you to determine a rate or a slope instead of a derivative.
Q.
What’s the derivative of y = 4x – 5?
A.
The answer is 4. You know, of course, that
the slope of y = 4x – 5 is 4, right? No? Egad!
Any line of the form y = mx + b has a slope
equal to m. I hope that rings a bell. The
derivative of a line or curve is the same
thing as its slope, so the derivative of this
line is 4.
You can think of the derivative dx
dy
as basically run
rise.

The Handy-Dandy Difference Quotient 
The difference quotient is the almost magical tool that gives us the slope of a curve at a
single point. To make a long story short, here’s what happens when you use the differ-
ence quotient. (If you want an excellent version of the long story, check out Calculus
For Dummies.) Look again at the figure in problem 3. You can’t get the slope of the 
parabola at (7,9) with the algebra slope formula, m
x
x
y

d
n, because no matter 
what other point on the parabola you use with (7,9) in the formula, you’ll get a slope
that’s steeper or less steep than the precise slope at (7,9).
But if your second point on the parabola is extremely close to (7,9) — like 
.
, .
7 001 9 0029996
`
j — your line would be almost exactly as steep as the tangent line. 
The difference quotient gives the precise slope of the tangent line by sliding the
second point closer and closer to (7,9) until its distance from (7,9) is infinitely small.
Enough of this mumbo jumbo; now for the math. Here’s the definition of the derivative
based on the difference quotient:

little algebraic mojo so that you can cancel the h and then plug in. (The techniques
from Chapter 4 also work here.)

If you leave your home at time = 0, and go

in your car, what’s dt
dp, the derivative of 
your position with respect to time? The answer is dt
dp
60
=
. A derivative is always a rate, and  
a rate is always a derivative (assuming we’re talking about instantaneous rates). So, if your 
speed, or rate, is 
hour
miles
60
, the derivative, dt
dp, is also 60. One way to think about a derivative 
like dt
dp is that it tells you (in this case) how much your position (p) changes when the time (t) 
increases by one hour. A rate of 
hour
miles
60
means that your position changes 60 miles each time 
the number of hours of your trip goes up by 1.

(where b = 0). So the slope is 60 and the derivative is thus 60. And again
you see that a derivative is a slope and a rate.

that the slope of y

is 3. At the point (7, 9),
the parabola is exactly as steep as the line, so the derivative (that’s the slope) of the parabola
at (7, 9) is also 3.
Although the slope of the line stays constant, the slope of the parabola changes as you climb
up from (7, 9), getting less and less steep. Even if you go to the right just 0.001 to x = 7.001, the
slope will no longer be exactly 3. 
d
What’s the derivative of the parabola y
x
5
2
= -
+
at the point (0, 5)? The answer is 0.
The point (0, 5) is the very top of the parabola, y
x
5
2
= -
+
. At the top, the parabola is neither
going up nor down — just like you’re neither going up nor down when you’re walking on top
of a hill. The top of the parabola is flat or level in this sense, and thus the slope and derivative
both equal zero.
The fact that the derivative is zero at the top of a hill — and at the bottom of a valley — is a
critically important point which we’ll return to time and time again.
e
With your graphing calculator, graph both the line y
x
4
9
= -
+
and the parabola y
x
5
2
=
-
.
You’ll see that they’re tangent at the point (2, 1). 
a. What is the derivative of y
x
5
2
=
-
when x = 2? The answer is –4. The derivative of a curve
tells you its slope or steepness. Because the line and the parabola are equally steep at (2, 1),
and because you know the slope of the line is –4, the slope of the parabola at (2, 1) is also –4
and so is its derivative. 
b. On the parabola, how fast is y changing compared to x when x = 2? It’s decreasing 4 times as
fast as x increases. A derivative is a rate as well as a slope. Because the derivative of the
parabola is –4 at (2, 1), that tells you that y is changing 4 times as fast as x, but because the 4
is negative, y decreases 4 times as fast as x increases. This is the rate of y compared to x only
for the one instant at (2, 1) — and thus it’s called an instantaneous rate. A split second later —
say at x = 2.000001 — y will be decreasing a bit faster.

Chapter 5: Getting the Big Picture: Differentiation Basics
f
Draw a function containing three points where — for three different reasons — you would not
be able to determine the slope and thus where you would not be able to find a derivative.
Your sketch should contain (1) Any type of gap or discontinuity. There’s no slope and thus no
derivative at a gap because you can’t draw a tangent line at a gap (try it). (2) A sharp point or
cusp. It’s impossible to draw a tangent line at a cusp because a line touching the function at
such a sharp point could rock back and forth. So there’s no slope and no derivative at a cusp.
(3) A vertical inflection point. Although you can draw a tangent line at a vertical inflection
point, since it’s vertical, its slope — and therefore its derivative — is undefined.

Part III: Differentiation 
In problem 4, you see that the top of this parabola ( y
x
5
2
= -
+
) is at the point (0,5) and that
the derivative is zero there because the parabola is neither going up nor down at its peak. That
explanation was based on common sense. But now, with the result given by the difference quo-
tient, namely y
x
2
= -
l
, you have a rigorous confirmation of the derivative’s value at (0,5). Just
plug 0 in for x in y
x

, and you get y

For the position function in problem 11, what’s the instantaneous velocity at t = 4? The answer
is 24 miles/hour. Problem 8 gives you the derivative of this parabola, f
x
x
6
=
l^ h
. The position
function in this problem is the same except for different variables, so its derivative is s
t
t6
=
l^ h
. 
Plug in 4, and you get s

miles
4
24
=
l^ h
. Notice how the average velocities get closer and closer 
to 
hour

as the total travel time gets less and less and the ending time hones in on t = 4. 
That’s precisely how the difference quotient works as h shrinks to zero.

hapter 5 gives you the meaning of the derivative. In this chapter, you practice rules for
finding derivatives. But before you practice the following rules, you may want to go
back to the Cheat Sheet in Calculus For Dummies or to your calc text to review the basic
derivatives. For example, you need to know that the derivative of sine is cosine.
Rules for Beginners
Okay, now that you’ve got the memorization stuff taken care, you now begin some rules that
involve more than just memorizing the answer.
First there’s the derivative of a constant rule: The derivative of a constant is zero. Alright —
this one’s also just memorization.
And then there’s the power rule: To find the derivative of a variable raised to a power, bring
the power in front — multiplying it by the coefficient, if there is one — then reduce the
power by one.
Q.
What’s the derivative of 5x3?
A.
15x2
1. Bring the power in front, multiplying it
by the coefficient.
So far you’ve got 15x3. Note that this
does not equal 5x3 and so you should
not put an equal sign in front of it. 
In fact, there’s no reason to write this
interim step down at all. I do it simply to
make the process clear.
2. Reduce the power by one.
This gives you the final answer of 15x2.

Giving It Up for the Product 
and Quotient Rules
Now that you’ve got the easy stuff down, I’m sure you’re dying to get some practice
with advanced differentiation rules. The product rule and the quotient rule give you the
derivatives for the product of two functions and the quotient of two functions, respec-
tively and obviously.
The product rule is a snap. The derivative of a product of two functions, (first)(second),
equals first

Here’s a good way to remember the quotient rule. Notice that the numerator of the
quotient rule looks exactly like the product rule, except that there’s a minus sign
instead of a plus sign. And note that when you read a product, you read from left to
right, and when you read a quotient, you read from top to bottom. So just remember
that the quotient rule, like the product rule, works in the natural order in which you
read, beginning with the derivative of the first thing you read.
For some mysterious reason, many textbooks give the quotient rule in a different form
that’s harder to remember. Learn it the way I’ve written it above, beginning with first l
^
h .
That’s the easiest way to remember it.

Linking Up with the Chain Rule
The chain rule is probably the trickiest among the advanced rules, but it’s really not
that bad at all if you focus clearly on what’s going on — I promise! Most of the basic
derivative rules have a plain old x as the argument (or input variable) of the function.
For example, f
x
x
=
^ h
, sin x, and y
e
x
=
all have just x as the argument. 
When the argument of a function is anything other than a plain old x, such as 
sin
y
x
2
=
or ln10
x, you’ve got a chain rule problem.
Here’s what you do. You simply apply the derivative rule that’s appropriate to the
outer function, temporarily ignoring the not-a-plain-old-x argument. Then multiply that
result by the derivative of the argument. That’s all there is to it.

Can you remember when you’ve had so
much fun?
With chain rule problems, never use
more than one derivative rule per step. In
other words, when you do the derivative
rule for the outermost function, don’t
touch the inside stuff! Only in the next
step do you multiply the outside deriva-
tive by the derivative of the inside stuff.

What to Do with Ys: Implicit Differentiation
You use implicit differentiation when your equation isn’t in “y =” form, such as
siny
x
y
5
2
3
3
=
+
, and it’s impossible to solve for y. If you can solve for y, implicit differ-
entiation will still work, but it’s not necessary.
Implicit differentiation problems are chain rule problems in disguise. Here’s what I
mean. You know that the derivative of sinx is cosx, and that according to the chain
rule, the derivative of sinx
3 is cos x
x
3
3
$
l
_
_
i
i . You would finish that problem by doing
the derivative of x3, but I have a reason for leaving the problem unfinished.
To do implicit differentiation, all you do (sort of) is every time you see a “y” in a prob-
lem, you treat it as if it were x 3. Thus, because the derivative of sinx
3 is cos x
x
3
3
$
l
_
_
i
i ,
the derivative of siny is cosy y$ l. Then, after doing the differentiation, you just
rearrange terms so that you get yl = something.
By the way, I used “y” in the explanation above, but that’s not the whole story. 
Consider that y
x
20
3
=l
is the same as dx
dy
x
20
3
=
. It’s the variable on the top that you 
apply implicit differentiation to. This is typically y, but it could be any other variable.
And it’s the variable on the bottom that you treat the ordinary way. This is typically x,
but it could also be any other variable.

Getting High on Calculus: 
Higher Order Derivatives
You often need to take the derivative of a derivative, or the derivative of a derivative 
of a derivative, and so on. In the next two chapters, you see a few applications. For
example, a second derivative will tell you the acceleration of a moving body. To find a
higher order derivative, you just treat the first derivative as a new function and take its
derivative in the ordinary way. You can keep doing this indefinitely.

Note that the derivative of plain old t or plain old x (or any other variable) is simply 1. In a
sense, this is the simplest of all derivative rules, not counting the derivative of a constant. Yet
for some reason, many people get it wrong. This is simply an example of the power rule: x is the
same as x1, so you bring the 1 in front and reduce the power by 1, from 1 to 0. That gives you
1x0. But because anything to the 0 power equals 1, you’ve got 1 times 1, which of course is 1.

ignore it temporarily (because coefficients have no effect on differentiation), and put it back
when you’re done differentiating. If you do it this way, don’t forget that the “5” multiplies the
entire derivative, not just the first term. The second way is probably easier and better: just
make the “5” part of the first function. To wit:

To remember the derivatives of the inverse trig functions, notice that the derivative of each co-
function (arccosine, arccotangent, and arccosecant) is the negative of its corresponding function.
So, you really only need to memorize the derivatives of arcsin, arctan, and arcsec. These three
have a 1 in the numerator. The two that contain the letter “s,” arcsin and arcsec, contain a
square root in the denominator. Arctan has no “s” and no square root.

This problem involves both the product rule and the chain rule. Which do you do first? Note
that the chain rule part of this problem, sin3 x, is one of the two things being multiplied, so it is
part of — or sort of inside — the product. And, like with pure chain rule problems, with prob-
lems involving more than one rule, you work from outside, in. So here you begin with the prod-
uct rule. Here’s another way to look at it:
If you’re not sure about the order of the rules in a complicated derivative problem, imagine that
you plugged a number into x in the original function and had to compute the answer. Your last
computation tells you where to start. If, for example, you plugged 2 into 
sin
x
x
4
3
, you would
compute 24, then sin 2, then you’d cube that to get sin3 2, and, finally, you’d multiply 24 by sin3 2.
Because your final step was multiplication, you begin with the product rule.

curve at this point is zero. A tangent line with a zero slope is horizontal, and because this 
tangent line touches the curve where y = 0, the tangent line is the x-axis.

Chapter 7
Analyzing Those Shapely Curves 
with the Derivative
In This Chapter
 Mum’s the word: Minimum, maximum, extremum
 Concavity and inflection points
 The nasty mean value theorem
T
his chapter gives you lots of practice using the derivative to analyze the shape of
curves and their significant features and points. Don’t forget: The derivative tells you
the slope of a curve, so any problem involving anything about the slope or steepness of a
curve is a derivative problem.
The First Derivative Test and Local Extrema
One of the most common applications of the derivative employs the simple idea that at the
top of a hill or at the bottom of a valley, you’re neither going up nor down; in other words,
there’s no steepness and the slope — and thus the derivative — equals zero. You can there-
fore use the derivative to locate the top of “hills” and the bottom of “valleys,” called local
extrema, on just about any function by setting the derivative of the function equal to zero
and solving.

of f.

5. Draw a “sign graph.” Take your number
line and label each region — based on
your results from Step 4 — positive
(increasing) or negative (decreasing).
See the following figure. 
This sign graph tells you where the func-
tion is rising or increasing and where it is
falling or decreasing.
6. Use the sign graph to determine
whether there’s a local minimum, local
maximum, or neither at each critical
number.
Because g goes down on its way to x = –3
and up after x = –3, it must bottom out
at x = –3, so there’s a local min there.
Conversely, g peaks at x = 3 because it
rises until x = 3, then falls. There is thus a
local max at x = 3. And because g climbs
on its way to x = 0 and then climbs fur-
ther, there is neither a min nor a max at
x = 0. 
7. Determine the y-values of the local
extrema by plugging the x-values into
the original function.

The Second Derivative Test and Local Extrema
With the second derivative test, you use — can you guess? — the second derivative to
test for local extrema. The second derivative test is based on the absolutely brilliant
idea that the crest of a hill has a hump shape (+) and the bottom of a valley has a
trough shape (,). 
After you find a function’s critical numbers, you’ve got to decide whether to use the
first or the second derivative test to find the extrema. For some functions, the second
derivative test is the easier of the two because 1) The second derivative is usually 
easy to get, 2) You can often plug the critical numbers into the second derivative and
do a quick computation, and 3) you will often get non-zero results and thus get your
answers without having to do a sign graph and test regions. On the other hand, testing
regions on a sign graph (the first derivative test) is also fairly quick and easy, and if the
second derivative test fails (see the warning), you’ll have to do that anyway. As you do
practice problems, you’ll get a feel for when to use each test.
When the second derivative equals zero, the second derivative test fails and you learn
nothing about local extrema. You’ve then got to use the first derivative test to deter-
mine whether there’s a local extremum (the singular of extrema) there.

previous section, g x

, but this
time find its local extrema using the second
derivative test. 
A.
The local min is at x = –3 and the local
max is at x = 3.
You’ve probably figured out that to use
the second derivative test you need the
second derivative:

The fact that g
3
-
m ^
h is positive tells you
that g is concave up (,) there, and thus
that there’s a local min. And the fact that
g
3
m ^ h is negative tells you that g is con-
cave down (+) at x = 3, and, therefore,
that there’s a local max there. And, while
it may seem that g
0
0
=
m ^ h
confirms what
you figured out previously (that there’s
neither a min nor a max there), you actu-
ally learn nothing when the second deriv-
ative is zero; you have to use the first
derivative test.
Tip: If you only have one critical point between
a local min and a local max (and no discon-
tinuities), it has to be an inflection point,
and if you have a single critical number
between two known maxes (see problem
7), the only possibility for the middle criti-
cal number is a local min (and vice-versa).
So in these cases, it really doesn’t matter 
if the second derivative test fails with the
middle critical number. If this not-by-the-
book reasoning doesn’t work for your calc
teacher, you might say (with just a touch 
of sarcasm in your voice), “Oh, so in other
words, you’ve got something against logic
and common sense.”

Finding Mount Everest: Absolute Extrema
The basic idea in this section is quite simple. Instead of finding all local extrema like in
the previous sections (all the peaks and all the valleys), you just want to determine the
single highest point and single lowest point along a continuous function in some closed
interval. These absolute extrema can occur at a peak or valley or at an edge(s) of the
interval. (Note: You could have, say, two peaks at the same height so there’d be a tie
for the absolute max; but there would still be exactly one y-value that’s the absolute
maximum value on the interval.) 
Before you practice with some problems, look at Figure 7-1 to see two standard
absolute extrema problems (continuous functions on a closed interval) and at Figure 7-2
for four strange functions that don’t have the standard single absolute max and single
absolute min.

A.
The absolute max is 2 and the absolute
min is 0.

First, set the derivative equal to zero
(note, first split this function in two to
get rid of the absolute value bars):

Now, determine whether the derivative is
undefined anywhere:
The derivative is undefined at x = 0
because the denominator of the deriva-
tive can’t equal zero. (If you graph this
function (always a good idea) you’ll also
see the cusp at x = 0 and thus know
immediately that there’s no derivative
there.)
The critical numbers are therefore 0
and 1⁄4.
2. Compute the function values (the
heights) at all the critical numbers.

4. The highest of all the function values
from Steps 2 and 3 is the absolute max;
the lowest of all the values from Steps 2
and 3 is the absolute min.
Thus, 2 is the absolute max and 0 is the
absolute min.
Note that finding absolute extrema
involves less work than finding local
extrema because you don’t have to use
the first or second derivative tests — do
you see why?

Smiles and Frowns: Concavity 
and Inflection Points
Another purpose of the second derivative is to analyze concavity and points of inflec-
tion. (For a refresher, look at Figure 7-3: The area between A and B is concave down —
like an upside-down spoon or a frown; the areas on the outsides of A and B are con-
cave up — right-side up spoon or a smile; and A and B are inflection points.) A positive
second derivative means concave up; a negative second derivative means concave
down. Where the concavity switches from up to down or down to up, you’ve got an
inflection point, and the second derivative there will be zero (or sometimes undefined).
All inflection points have a second derivative of zero (if the second derivative exists),
but not all points with a second derivative of zero are inflection points. This is no dif-
ferent from “all ships are boats but not all boats are ships.” 
However, you can have an inflection point where the second derivative is undefined.
This occurs when the inflection point has a vertical tangent and in some bizarre
curves that you shouldn’t worry about that have a weird discontinuity in the second
derivative.

, 0, and 2
2 are 
the three second derivative “critical
numbers.” (Technically these aren’t
called critical numbers, but they could
be because they work just like first 
derivative critical numbers.) 
4. Plot these “critical numbers” on a
number line and test the regions.
You can use –1, –.5, .5, and 1 as test 
numbers. The following figure shows
the second derivative sign graph.

Because the concavity switches at all
these “critical numbers” and because 
the second derivative exists at those
numbers (from Steps 2 and 3), there are
inflection points at those three x-values.
(If the concavity switches at a point
where the second derivative is unde-
fined, you have to check one more thing
before concluding that you’ve got an
inflection point: whether you can draw a
tangent line there. This is the case when
the first derivative is defined or if there’s
a vertical tangent.) In a nutshell, if the
concavity switches at a point where the
curve is smooth, you’ve got an inflection
point.
5. Determine the location of the three
inflection points.

The Mean Value Theorem: 
Go Ahead, Make My Day
The Mean Value Theorem is based on an incredibly simple idea. Say you go for a one
hour drive and travel 50 miles. Your average speed, of course, would be 50 mph. The
Mean Value Theorem says that there must be at least one point during your trip when
your speed was exactly 50 mph. But you don’t need a fancy-pants calculus theorem to
tell you that. It’s just common sense. If you went slower than 50 mph the whole way,
you couldn’t average 50. And if you went faster than 50 the whole way (this assumes
you’re going faster than 50 at your starting point), your average speed would be
greater than 50. The only way to average 50 is to go exactly 50 the whole way or to
go slower than 50 some times and faster than 50 at other times. And when you speed
up or slow down, you have to pass exactly 50 at some point.
With the Mean Value Theorem, you figure an average rate or slope over an interval and
then use the first derivative to find one or more points in the interval where the instan-
taneous rate or slope equals the average rate or slope. Here’s an example:

Note, again, how the numbers I picked for the first and third computations made the math easy.
With the second computation, you can save a little time and skip the final calculation because
all you care about is whether the result is positive or negative — this assumes that you know
that the cube root of 2 is more than 1 (you better!).
5. Draw your sign graph (see the following figure).
6. Determine whether there’s a local min or max or neither at each critical number.
f goes down to x = 0 and then up, so there’s a local min at x = 0, and f goes up to x = 1 and then
down, so there’s a local max at x = 1.
7. Figure the y-value of the two local extrema.

So 
2
-
and 2 are two critical numbers of s.
t = 0 is a third important number because t = 0 makes the derivative’s denominator equal zero,
and so you need to include zero on your sign graph in order to define test regions. Note, how-
ever, that t = 0 is not a critical number of s because s is undefined at t = 0. And because there is
no point on s at t = 0, there cannot be a local extremum at t = 0. 
3. Test values: You’re on your own.

(which you already knew). Therefore, there’s no local extremum 
at t = 0. Remember that if a problem asks you to identify only the x-values and not the 
y-values of the local extrema, and you only consider the sign graph, you would incorrectly
conclude — using the current problem as an example — that there’s a local min at t = 0.
So you should always check where your function is undefined.

The second derivative test fails at x = 0, so you’ve got to use the first derivative test for that
critical number. And this means, basically, that the second derivative test was a waste of time
for this function.
If — as in the function for this problem — one of the critical numbers is x = 0, and you can see
that the second derivative will equal zero at x = 0 (because, for example, all the terms of the
second derivative will be simple powers of x), then the second derivative test will fail for x = 0
and thus, will likely be a waste of time. Use the first derivative test instead.
However, because this is a continuous function and because there’s only one critical number
between the two maxes you found, the only possibility is that there’s a min at x = 0. Try this
streetwise logic out on your teacher and let me know if it works.

Do you see the trouble you’re going to run into with y(x)? The first derivative is undefined at
x
2

. And the second derivative will also be undefined at those x-values, because when
you take the second derivative with the quotient rule, squaring the bottom, the denominator
will contain that same factor, x

The derivative is never undefined, so these are the only critical numbers.

Part III: Differentiation 

If you divide both sides of an equation by something that can equal zero at one or more x-values
(like you do above when dividing both sides by cosx), you may miss one or more solutions. You 
have to check whether any of those x-values is a solution. In this problem, cosx
0
=
at π
2 and π
2
3 , 
and it’s easy to check (in line 4 above) that sinx does not equal cosx at either of those values. If
it did, you’d have one or two more solutions and one or two more critical numbers. Note that you
have to check these values before dividing out the “dividing thing” (cosx here).

to the inflection point at (1, –1), then concave down from there
to 3. As always, you should check your result on your graphing calculator. Hint: To get a good

Thus the concavity goes: down, up, down, up. Because the second derivative is zero at –0.085
and 0.085 and because the concavity switches there, you can conclude that there are inflection
points at those two x-values. But because both the first and second derivatives are undefined 
at x = 0, you have to check whether there’s a vertical tangent there. You can see that there is 
by just looking at the graph, but if want to be rigorous about it, you figure the limit of the first
derivative as x approaches zero. Since that equals infinity, you’ve got a vertical tangent at x = 0,
and thus there’s an inflection point there. 
Now plug in –0.085, 0, and 0.085 into q to get the y-values and you’re done.

ow that you’re an expert at finding derivatives, I’m sure you can’t wait to put your
expertise to use solving some practical problems. In this section, you find problems
that actually come up in the real world — problems like how should a cat rancher use 200
feet of fencing to build a three-sided corral next to a river (he only needs three sides
because the river makes the fourth side and cats hate water) to maximize the grazing area
for his cats? 
Optimization Problems: From Soup to Nuts
Optimization problems are one of the most practical types of calculus problems. You use
the techniques shown below whenever you want to maximize or minimize something: like
maximizing profit or area or volume or minimizing cost or energy consumption, and so on.

124
Part III: Differentiation 
Q.
A rancher has 400 feet of fencing and wants
to build a corral that’s divided into three
equal rectangles. See the following figure.
What length and width will maximize the
area?
A.

square feet.

Problematic Relationships: Related Rates
Related rates problems are the Waterloo for many a calculus student. But they’re not
that bad after you get the basic technique down. The best way to learn them is by
working through examples, so get started!
After working each problem, ask yourself whether the answer makes sense. Asking this
question is one of the best things you can do to increase your success in mathematics
and science. And while it’s not always possible to decide whether a math answer is
reasonable, when it’s possible, this inquiry should be a quick, extra step of every prob-
lem you do.

Q.
A homeowner decides to paint his home. He
picks up a home improvement book, which
recommends that a ladder should be placed
against a wall such that the distance from
the foot of the ladder to the bottom of the
wall is one third the length of the ladder. Not
being the sharpest tool in the shed, the
homeowner gets mixed up and thinks that
it’s the distance from the top of the ladder to
the base of the wall that should be a third of
the ladder’s length. He sets up his 18 foot
ladder accordingly, and — despite this
unstable ladder placement — he manages to
climb the ladder and start painting.
(Perhaps the foot of the ladder is caught on
a tree root or something.) His luck doesn’t
last long, and the ladder begins to slide rap-
idly down the wall. One foot before the top
of the ladder hits the ground, it’s falling at a
rate of 20 feet/second. At this moment, how
fast is the foot of the ladder moving away
from the wall?
A.
Roughly 1.11 feet/second.
1. Draw a diagram, labeling it with any
unchanging measurements and assign-
ing variables to any changing things.
See the following figure.
You don’t have to draw the house — the
basic triangle is enough. But I’ve sketched
a fuller picture of this scenario to make
clear what a bonehead this guy is.
2. List all given rates and the rate you’re
asked to figure out. Write these rates as
derivates with respect to time.
You’re told that the ladder is falling at a
rate of 20 ft / sec. Going down is negative,

6. Ask yourself whether your answer is
reasonable.
Yes, it does make sense. Lean a yardstick
against a wall so the bottom of it is about
4 or 5 inches from the wall. Then push
the bottom of the yardstick the 4 or 5
inches to the wall. You’ll see that the top
would barely move up. Right triangles
with a fixed hypotenuse like this one
always work like that. If one leg is much
shorter than the other, the short leg can
change a lot while the long leg barely
changes. It’s a by-product of the
Pythagorean Theorem.

A farmer’s hog trough is 10 feet long, and
its cross-section is an isosceles triangle
with a base of 2 feet and a height of 2 feet 6
inches (with the vertex at the bottom, nat-
urally). The farmer is pouring swill into the
trough at a rate of 1 cubic foot per minute.
Just as the swill reaches the brim, her
three hogs start violently sucking down the
swill at a rate of 1⁄2 cubic foot per minute for
each hog. They’re going at it so vigorously
that another 1⁄2 cubic foot of swill is being
splashed out of the trough each minute.
The farmer keeps pouring in swill, but
she’s no match for his hogs. When the
depth of the swill falls to 1 foot 8 inches,
how fast is the swill level falling?

A six-foot tall man looking over his

15-foot tall lamp post in front of him. The
shadow frightens him so he starts running
away from it — toward the lamp post.
Unfortunately, this only makes matters
worse, as it causes the frightening head of
the shadow to gain on him. He starts to
panic and runs even faster. Five feet before
he crashes into the lamp post, he’s running
at a speed of 15 miles/hour. At this point,
how fast is the tip of the shadow moving?

A Day at the Races: Position, 
Velocity, and Acceleration
The most important thing to know about this type of problem is that velocity is the
derivative of position and acceleration is the derivative of velocity. The following
points about position, velocity, and acceleration with regard to the chariot race in
Figure 8-1 provide some keys to approaching these problems.
 The finish is 100 palameters from the start as the crow flies, so 100 palameters is
the total displacement. (A palameter is a little-known unit of distance used in
ancient Rome equal to the length of Julius Caesar’s palace — roughly 380 feet.)
Say the start is at (0, 0) on a coordinate system and the finish is at (100, 0). It’s
100 from 0 to 100, of course, so 100 is the total displacement.
 Distance is different. You can see that the charioteers backtrack 50 palameters in
the middle of the race. Because there are two extra 50-palameter legs, the total
length of the race is 200 palameters — that’s the distance. Distance is always
positive or zero.
 Displacement to the left is negative (in other problems, down would be negative).
When, say, Maximus passes Atlas, his position is 75 palameters from the start.
At Aphrodite, he’s back to only 25 palameters from the start as the crow flies.
Displacement equals final position minus initial position, so from Atlas to
Aphrodite is a displacement of 25
75
-
, or –50 palameters.
 Velocity is related to displacement, not distance traveled. Velocity has a special
meaning in calculus and physics so forget the everyday meaning of it. Like dis-
placement, if you’re going left (or down), that’s a negative velocity. And here’s a
critical point: When you switch directions, your velocity is zero. Think of a ball
thrown straight up. At its peak, for an infinitesimal moment, it is motionless, so
its velocity is zero.

For problems 9, 10, and 11, a duck-billed
platypus is swimming back and forth along
the side of your boat, blithely unaware that
he’s the subject for calculus problems in
rectilinear motion. The back of your boat is
at the zero position, and the front of your
boat is in the positive direction (see the fol-
lowing figure). s(t) gives his position (in
feet) as a function of time (seconds). Find
his a) position, b) velocity, c) speed, and d)

 Average velocity is defined as total displacement divided by total time. Say Glutius
completes the race in 1 hour. Because he traveled 200 palameters, his average
speed would be 200 palameters per hour. But because the total displacement is
only 100, his average velocity would be a mere 100 palameters per hour (roughly
7 miles per hour). 
 Speed is regular old speed, and, unlike velocity, it’s always positive (or zero). If
Maximus picks up speed to make the jump over the lion pit, his speed, naturally,
would be increasing. Note: His velocity would be decreasing — even though we
would see him speeding up — because his velocity would be negative and would
be becoming a larger and larger negative.
 The meaning of acceleration, like velocity, (in calculus and physics) agrees with
the way we use it in everyday life only for movement to the right (or up). But,
going left (or down), it’s strange. When Glutius speeds up to jump over the lion
pit, we would say that he’s accelerating. But because his velocity is becoming a
larger and larger negative and is thus decreasing, he is technically decelerating.

Make Sure You Know Your Lines: 
Tangents and Normals
In everyday life, it’s perfectly normal to go off on a tangent now and then. In calculus,
on the other hand, there is nothing at all normal about a tangent. You need only note a
couple points before you’re ready to try some problems:
 At its point of tangency, a tangent line has the same slope as the curve it’s tan-
gent to. In calculus, whenever a problem involves slope, you should immediately
think derivative. The derivative is the key to all tangent line problems.
 At its point of intersection to a curve, a normal line is perpendicular to the tangent
line drawn at that same point. When any problem involves perpendicular lines,
you use the rule that perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite recipro-
cals. So all you do is use the derivative to get the slope of the tangent line, and
then the opposite reciprocal of that gives you the slope of the normal line.
Ready to try a few problems? Say, that reminds me. I once had this problem with my
carburetor. I took my car into the shop, and the mechanic told me the problem would
be easy to fix, but when I went back to pick up my car . . . Wait a minute. Where was I?

one from 64. For example, the cube root
of 65 is 41⁄48 and the cube root of 66 is 42⁄48,

So, the least expensive frame for a 20-square-foot window will cost about $373 and will be

. . . Given that a right triangle’s hypotenuse must pass through the point (2, 5), what are the
dimensions and area of the smallest such triangle? The hypotenuse meets the y-axis at (0, 10)

This is a bit tricky — Hint: consider similar triangles. If you draw a horizontal line from (0, 5)
to (2, 5), you create a little triangle in the upper-left corner that’s similar to the whole triangle.
(You can prove their similarity with AA — remember your geometry? — both triangles have a
right angle and both share the top angle.)

Part III: Differentiation

. . . When the depth of the swill falls to 1 foot 8 inches, how fast is the swill level falling? It’s
falling at a rate of 9⁄10 inches per minute.
1. Draw a diagram, labeling the diagram with any unchanging measurements and assigning 
variables to any changing things. See the following figure.
Note that the figure shows the unchanging dimensions of the trough, 2 feet by 2 feet 6 inches
by 10 feet, and these dimensions are not labeled with variable names like l (for length), w (for
width), or h (for height). Also note that the changing things — the height (or depth) of the
swill and the width of the surface of the swill (which gets narrower as the swill level falls) —
do have variable names, h for height and b for base (I realize it’s at the top, but it’s the base
of the upside-down triangle shape made by the swill). Finally note that the height of 1’8” —
which is the height only at one particular point in time — is in parentheses to distinguish it
from the other unchanging dimensions.
2. List all given rates and the rate you’re asked to figure out. Express these rates as derivatives
with respect to time. Give yourself a high-five if you realized that the thing that matters about
the changing volume of swill is the net rate of change of volume.
Swill is coming in at 1 cubic foot per minute and is going out at 3 2
1
$
cubic feet per minute (for 
the three hogs) plus another 1⁄2 cubic feet per minute (the splashing). So the net is 1 cubic foot
per minute going out — that’s a negative rate of change. In calculus language, you write:
dt
dv
1
= - cubic foot per minute. 
You’re asked to determine how fast the height is changing, so write:
?
dt
dh =
3. a. Write down a formula that involves the variables in the problem — V, h, and b.
The technical name for the shape of the trough is a right prism. And the shape of the swill in
the trough — what you care about here — has the same shape. Imagine tipping this up so it
stands vertically. Any shape that has a flat base and a flat top and that goes straight up
from base to top has the same volume formula: Volume
area
height
base
=
$
Note that this “base” is the entire swill triangle and totally different from b in the figure;
also this “height” is totally different from the swill height, h.
The area of the triangular base equals 
bh

and the height of the prism is 10 feet, so here’s 
your formula: V

b. Find an equation that relates your unwanted variable, b, to some other variable in the prob-
lem so you can make a substitution and be left with an equation involving only V and h. 
The triangular face of the swill is the same shape of the triangular side of the trough. If you
remember geometry, you know that such similar shapes have proportional sides. So,

In all related rates problems, make sure you differentiate (like you do here in Step 4) before you
substitute the values of the variables into the equation (like you do below when you plug 1’8”
into h in Step 5).
5. Substitute all known quantities into this equation and solve for dt
dh.
You were given that h = 1’8’’ (you must convert this to feet) and you figured out in Step 2 
that dt

$
Thus, when the swill level drops to a depth of 1’8’’, it’s falling at a rate of 9⁄10 inches per minute.
Mmm, mmm, good!
6. Ask whether this answer makes sense.
Unlike the example problem, it’s not easy to come up with a common-sense explanation of
why this answer is or is not reasonable. But there’s another type of check that works here and
in many other related rates problems. 
Take a very small increment of time — something much less than the time unit of the rates
used in the problem. This problem involves rates per minute, so use 1 second for your time
increment. Now ask yourself what happens in this problem in 1 second. The swill is leaving
the trough at 1 cubic foot / minute; so in 1 second, 1⁄60 cubic foot will leave the trough. What
does that do to the swill height? Because of the similar triangles mentioned in Step 3b, when
the swill falls to a depth of 1’8’’, which is 2⁄3 of the height of the trough, the width of the surface
of the swill must be 2⁄3 of the width of the trough — and that comes to 11⁄3 feet. So the surface 
area of the swill is 
feet
1 3

#
. 
Assuming the trough walls are straight (this type of simplification always works in this type of
checking process), the swill that leaves the trough would form the shape of a very, very short
box (“box” sounds funny because this shape is so thin; maybe “thin piece of plywood” is a
better image).

This tells you that in 1 second, the height should fall .00125 feet or something very close to it.
(This process sometimes produces an exact answer and sometimes an answer with a very
small error.) Now, finally, see whether this number agrees with the answer. Your answer was
–9⁄10 inches/minute. Convert this to feet/second:

g
. . . Five feet before the man crashes into the lamp post, he’s running at a speed of

5 ft. This is because the speed of the shadow is independent of the man’s position.

b. There are two legs of the sloth’s trip. He goes left from t = 0 till t = .385, then right from t = .385

Reject the negative solution because it’s outside the interval of interest: t = 0 to t = 5. So, the

from (0, 1). The points of normalcy are
(–.915, .702), (–.519, .073), (0, 0), (.519, .073), and (.915, .702).
I find this result interesting. First, because there are so many normal lines, and second,
because the normal lines from (0, 1) to (–.915, .702), (0, 0), and (.915, .702) are all shortest
paths (compared to other points in their respective vicinities). The other two normals are
longest paths. This is curious because y
x
4

is everywhere concave toward (0, 1). When a
curve is concave away from a point, a normal to the curve can only be a local shortest path.
But when a curve is concave toward a point, you can get either a local shortest or a local
longest path.

It’s a bit tricky to find the x-intercepts for this hairy function. You have to play around with the
window settings a bit. And don’t forget that your calculator will draw vertical asymptotes that
look like zeros of the function, but are not. To see the first zero, set xmin = –1, xmax = 10,
xscl = 1, ymin = –5, ymax = 25, and yscl = 5. To see the other two zeros, set xmin = 10, xmax = 30,
xscl = 1, ymin = –2, ymax = 10, and yscl = 1. The zeros are at roughly 6.11, 13.75, and 20.58.
4. Plug the zeros into the original function to obtain the y-coordinates. You get the following
points of normalcy: (6.11, 15.26), (13.75, 14.32), (20.58, 23.80).

Part III: Differentiation 

Part IV
Integration and Infinite
Series

In this part . . .
I
ntegration, like differentiation, is a highfalutin calculus
word for a simple idea: addition. Every integration
problem involves addition in one way or another. What
makes integration such a powerful tool is that it sort of
cuts up something (the weight of a large dome, the length
of a power cable, the pressure on the walls of a pipe, and
so on) into infinitely small chunks and then adds up the
infinite number of chunks to arrive at a precise total.
Without integration, many such problems can only be
approximated. Part IV gives you practice with integration
basics, techniques for finding integrals, and problem solv-
ing with integration.
Infinite series is a topic full of bizarre, counter-intuitive
results that have fascinated thinkers for over 2,000 years.
Zeno of Elea (5th century B.C.) gave us his famous para-
dox about the race between Achilles and the tortoise (the
resolution of the paradox involves limits — see Calculus
For Dummies). Your task with infinite series problems is 
to decide whether the sum of an infinitely long list of num-
bers diverges (adds up to infinity — usually) or converges
(adds up to an ordinary, finite number).

Chapter 9
Getting into Integration
In This Chapter

n this chapter, you begin the second major topic in calculus: integration. With integration
you can find the total area or volume of weird shapes that, unlike triangles, spheres,
cones, and other basic shapes, don’t have simple area or volume formulas. You can use inte-
gration to total up other things as well. The basic idea is that — with the magic of limits —
the thing you want the total of is cut up into infinitesimal pieces and then the infinite
number of pieces are added up. But before moving on to integration, you warm up with
some easy stuff: pre-pre-pre-calc — the area of rectangles.
By the way, despite the “kid stuff” quip, much of the material in this chapter and the first sec-
tion of Chapter 10 is both more difficult and less useful than what follows it. If ever there was
a time for the perennial complaint — “What is the point of learning this stuff?” — this is it.
Now, some calculus teachers would give you all sorts of fancy arguments and pedagogical
justifications for why this material is taught, but, let’s be honest, the sole purpose of teaching
these topics is to inflict maximum pain on calculus students. Well, you’re stuck with it, so
deal with it. The good news is that this material will make everything that comes later seem

The material in this section — using rectangles to approximate the area of strange shapes —
is part of every calculus course because integration rests on this foundation. But, in a sense,
this material doesn’t involve calculus at all. You could do everything in this section without
calculus, and if calculus had never been invented, you could still approximate area with the
methods described here.

Part IV: Integration and Infinite Series 
Q.
Using 10 right rectangles, estimate the area
under 
ln
f
x
x
=
^ h
from 1 to 6. 
A.
The approximate area is 6.181.
1. Sketch 
ln
f
x
x
=
^ h
and divide the inter-
val from 1 to 6 into ten equal incre-
ments. Each increment will have a
length of 1⁄2, of course. See the figure in
Step 2. 
2. Draw a right rectangle for each of the
ten increments.
You’re doing right rectangles, so put your
pen on the right end of the base of the
first rectangle (that’s at x = 1.5), draw
straight up till you hit the curve, and
then straight left till you’re directly
above the left end of the base (x = 1).
Finally, going straight down, draw the left
side of the first rectangle. See the follow-
ing figure. I’ve indicated with arrows how
you draw the first rectangle. Draw the
rest the same way.
3. Use your calculator to calculate the
heights of each rectangle. 
The heights are given by 
.
f 1 5
^
h, f 2
^ h,
.
f 2 5
^
h, and so on, which are ln1.5, ln2,
and so on again. 
4. Because you multiply each height by
the same base of 1⁄2, you can save some
time by doing the computation like this:

Sigma Notation and Reimann 
Sums: Geek Stuff
Now that you’re warmed up, let’s segue into summing some sophisticated sigma sums.
Sigma notation may look difficult, but it’s really just a shorthand way of writing a
long sum.
In a sigma sum problem, you can pull anything through the sigma symbol to the out-
side except for a function of the index of summation (the i in the following example).
Note that you can use any letter you like for the index of summation, though i and k
are customary.

1. Create the argument of the sigma 
function.
The jump amount between terms in a long
sum will become the coefficient of the
index of summation in a sigma sum, so
you know that 10i is the basic term of your
argument. You want to cube each term, so
that gives you the following argument.
i
10
3
!^
h
2. Set the range of the sum.
Ask yourself what i must be to make the
first term equal 50
3 — that’s 5, of course.
And ask the same question about the last
term of 150
3 — that gives you i = 15:

It’s often desirable to have i begin at 0

4. Then subtract 4 from the 15 as well.
To compensate for this subtraction, you
add 4 to the i in the argument:

Look back at Step 5. The 4

the two

inside come from the width 
of the rectangles that you got by dividing
5 (the span) by 20. So the width of each 
rectangle could have been written as 20

To add n rectangles instead of 20, just 
replace the 20 with an n — that’s n5 . So 
the three 
s

become n5 . At the same 
time, replace the 20 on top of the !

Close Isn’t Good Enough: The Definite
Integral and Exact Area
Now, finally, the first calculus in this chapter. Why settle for approximate areas when
you can use the definite integral to get exact areas?
The exact area under a curve between a and b is given by the definite integral, which is
defined as follows:

In plain English, this simply means that you can calculate the exact area under a curve
between two points by using the kind of formula you got in Step 10 of the previous
example and then taking the limit of that formula as n approaches infinity. (Okay, so
maybe that wasn’t plain, but at least it was English.)
The function inside the definite integral is called the integrand.

Finding Area with the Trapezoid 
Rule and Simpson’s Rule
To close this chapter, I give you two more ways to approximate an area. You can use
these methods when finding the exact area is impossible. (Just take my word for it that
there are functions that can’t be handled with ordinary integration.) With the trape-
zoid rule, you draw trapezoids under the curve instead of rectangles. See Figure 9-1,
which is the same function I used for the first example in this chapter. 
Note: You can’t actually see the trapezoids, because their tops mesh with the curve, 
y = ln x. But between each pair of points, such as A and B, there’s a straight trapezoid
top in addition to the curved piece of y = ln x. 
The Trapezoid Rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between a and 
b, 
f
x dx
a
b
# ^ h
, with a sum of trapezoids given by the following formula. In general, the 
more trapezoids, the better the estimate.

where n is the number of trapezoids, x 0 equals a, and x 1 through x n are the equally-
spaced x-coordinates of the right edges of trapezoids 1 through n. 
Simpson’s Rule also uses trapezoid-like shapes, except that the top of each
“trapezoid” — instead of being a straight-slanting segment, as “shown” in Figure 9-1 —
is a curve (actually a small piece of a parabola) that very closely hugs the function.
Because these little parabola pieces are so close to the function, Simpson’s rule gives
the best area approximation of any of the methods. If you’re wondering why you
should learn the trapezoid rule when you can just as easily use Simpson’s rule and get
a more accurate estimate, chalk it up to just one more instance of the sadism of calcu-
lus teachers.

4. Compute the percent error.
My TI-89 tells me that the exact area is
5.7505568153635 . . . For this problem,
round that off to 5.751. The percent error
is given by the error divided by the exact
area. So that gives you:

Compare this to the 10-midpoint-rectangle
error we compute in the solution to
problem 2: 0.14%. In general, the error
with a trapezoid estimate is roughly
twice the corresponding midpoint-
rectangle error.

The approximate area is 5.751. The error
is a mere 0.00069%.
1. List the values for a, b, and n, and

from 1 to 6, but this time with 10 left rectangles. The area
is 5.285.
1. Sketch a graph and divide the intervals into 10 subintervals.
2. a. Draw the first left rectangle by putting your pen at the left end of the first base (that’s at
x = 1) and going straight up till you hit the function. 
Whoops. You’re already on the function at x = 1, right? So, guess what? There is no first 
rectangle — or you could say it’s a rectangle with a height of zero and an area of zero. 
b. Draw the “second” rectangle by putting your pen at x = 1.5, going straight up till you hit
ln
f
x
x
=
^ h
, then go right till you’re directly above x = 2, then down to the x-axis. See the

b. How is this approximation related to the area obtained with 10 right rectangles? Look at the
second line in the computation in Step 4. Note that the sum of the 10 numbers inside the
parentheses includes the first 9 numbers in the same line in the computation for right rectan-
gles (see the example). The only difference is that the sum for left rectangles has a 0 at the
left end and the sum for right rectangles has a 1.792 at the right end.

If you look at the figure in Step 2 of the example and at the figure in Step 3 of the solution to
1(a), you’ll see why this works out this way. The first rectangle in the example figure is identical
to the second rectangle in the solution 1(a) figure. The second rectangle in the example figure
is identical to the third rectangle in the solution 1(a) figure, and so on. The only difference is
that the solution 1(a) figure contains the left-most “rectangle” (the invisible one) and the exam-
ple figure contains the tall, right-most rectangle. 
A left-rectangle sum and a right-rectangle sum will always differ by an amount equal to the dif-
ference in area of the left-most left rectangle and the right-most right rectangle. (Memorize this
paragraph and recite it in class — with your right index finger pointed upward for effect. You’ll
instantly become a babe (dude) magnet.)

Approximate the same area again with 10 midpoint rectangles. The approximate area is 5.759.
1. Sketch your curve and the 10 subintervals again. 
2. Compute the midpoints of the bases of all rectangles. This should be a no-brainer: 1.25, 1.75,
2.25 . . . 5.75.
3. Draw the first rectangle. Start on the point on 
ln
f
x
x
=
^ h
directly above x = 1.25, then go left
till you’re above x = 1 and right till you’re above x = 1.5, then down from both these points to
make the two sides.
4. Draw the other nine rectangles. See the following figure.

Rank the approximations from the example and problems 1 and 2 from best to worst and
defend your ranking. The midpoint rectangles give the best estimate because each rectangle
goes above the curve (in this sense, it’s too big) and also leaves an uncounted gap below the
curve (in this sense, it’s too small). These two errors cancel each other out to some extent.
By the way, the exact area is about 5.751. The approximate area with 10 midpoint rectangles
of 5.759 is only about 0.14% off.
It’s harder to rank the left versus the right rectangle estimates. Kudos if you noticed that
because of the shape of 
ln
f
x
x
=
^ h
(technically because it’s concave down and increasing),
right rectangles will give a slightly better estimate. It turns out that the right-rectangle
approximation is off by 7.48% and the left-rectangle estimate is off by 8.10%. If you missed this
question, don’t sweat it. It’s basically an extra-credit type question.

The exact area under sinx from 
to π
0
has the wonderfully simple answer of 2. The error of
the midpoint rectangle estimate is 0.65%, and the other two have an error of 1.3%. The left
and right rectangle estimates are the same, by the way, because of the symmetry of the sine
wave.

n this chapter, you really get into integration in full swing. First you look at the annoying
area function, then the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and then two beginner integra-
tion methods. 
The Absolutely Atrocious and 
Annoying Area Function
The area function is both more difficult and less useful than the material that follows it. With
any luck, your calc teacher will skip it or just give you a cursory introduction to it. Once 
you get to the following section on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, you’ll have no
more use for the area function. It’s taught because it’s the foundation for the all-important
Fundamental Theorem.
The area function is an odd duck and doesn’t look like any function you’ve ever seen before. 
A
x
f t dt
f
s
x
= #
^
^
h
h
The input of the function (its argument) is the x on top of the integral symbol. Note that f t^ h
is not the argument. The output, A
x
f^ h, tells you how much area has been swept out under
the curve, f t^ h, between some starting point, x = s, and the input value. For example, con-
sider the simple horizontal line g t
10
=
^ h
and the area function based on it, A
x
dt
10
g
x
3
= #
^ h
. 
This area function tells you how much area is under the horizontal line between 3 and the
input value. When x = 4, the area is 10 because you’ve got a rectangle with a base of one —
from 3 to 4 — and a height of 10. When x = 5, the output of the function is 20; when x = 6, the
output is 30, and so on. (For an excellent and thorough explanation of the area function and
how it relates to the Fundamental Theorem, check out Calculus For Dummies.) The best way
to get a handle on this weird function is to see it in action, so here goes.
Don’t forget that when using an area function (or a definite integral — stay tuned), area
below the x-axis counts as negative area.

f^ h is the area under f t

is about 6. (See the shaded area in the
figure.)

f^ h adds a bit to A
4
f^ h — roughly a
trapezoid with “height” of 1 and “bases” 2
and 3 (along the dotted lines at x = 4 and
x = 5) that thus has an area of 2.5, so A 5
f^ h
is roughly 6 plus 2.5, or 8.5. 
A 2
f^ h is the area between 2 and 2, which is
zero.
A 0
f^ h is another area roughly in the shape of
a trapezoid. Its height is 2 and its bases are 2
and 3, so its area is 5. But because you go
backwards from 2 to zero, A 0
f^ h equals –5. 
Between x = 5 and x = 6, A f is increasing. Be
careful here: f t^ h is decreasing between 5
and 6, but as you go from 5 to 6, A f sweeps
out more and more area so it’s increasing. 
Between x = 8 and x = 9, while f t^ h is
increasing A f is decreasing. Area below the
x-axis counts as negative area, so in moving
from 8 to 9, A f sweeps out more and more
negative area, thus growing more and more
negative, and thus A f is decreasing.

Sound the Trumpets: The Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus
The absolutely incredibly fantastic Fundamental Theorem of Calculus — some say one
of or perhaps the greatest theorem in the history of mathematics — gives you a neat
shortcut for finding area so you don’t have to deal with the annoying area function or
that rectangle mumbo jumbo from Chapter 9. The basic idea is that you use the anti-
derivative of a function to find the area under it.
Let me jog your memory on antiderivatives: Because x
3
2 is the derivative of x
3, x
3 is an
antiderivative of x
3
2. But so is x
5
3 +
because its derivative is also x
3
2. So anything of the
form x
C
3 +
(C is a constant) is an antiderivative of x
3
2. Technically, you say that x
C
3 +
is the indefinite integral of x
3
2 and that x
C
3 +
is the family of antiderivatives of x
3
2.
The Fundamental Theorem comes in two versions: useless and useful. You learn the
useless version for basically the same reason you studied geometry proofs in high
school, namely, “just because.”

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (the difficult, mostly useless version): Given an 
area function A f that sweeps out area under f t^ h, A
x
f t dt
f
s
x
= #
^
^
h
h
, the rate at 
which area is being swept out is equal to the height of the original function. So, because
the rate is the derivative, the derivative of the area function equals the original function: 
dx
d A
x
f
x
f
=
^
^
h
h. Because A
x

as follows: dx

Finding Antiderivatives: The 
Guess and Check Method
Your textbook, as well as the Cheat Sheet in Calculus For Dummies, lists a set of 
antiderivatives that you should memorize, such as sinx, x1 , or 
x
1
1
2
+
. (Most of them 
are simply the basic derivative rules you know written in reverse.) When you face
a problem that’s similar to one of these — like finding the antiderivative of sin x
5
or
x
8
1 — you can use the guess and check method: just guess your answer, check it by 
differentiating, then if it’s wrong, tweak it till it works.
Q.
What’s 
sin x dx
3
#
?
A.
cos x
3
1
3
-
You’ve memorized that cosx
-
is the anti-
derivative of sinx — because, of course,
sinx is the derivative of cosx
-
. So a good
guess for this antiderivative would be
cos x
3
-
. When you check that guess by
taking its derivative with the chain rule,
you get sin x
3
3 , which is what you want
except for that first 3. To compensate
for that, simply divide your guess by 3: 
cos x
3
3
-
. That’s it. If you have any doubts 
about this second guess, take its derivate
and you’ll see that it gives you the desired
integrand, sin x
3 .

The Substitution Method: 
Pulling the Switcheroo
The group of guess-and-check problems in the last section involve integrands that differ
from the standard integrand of a memorized antiderivative rule by a numerical amount.
The next set of problems involves integrands where the extra thing they contain
includes a variable expression. For these problems, you can still use the guess-and-check
method, but the traditional way of doing such problems is with the substitution method.

1. This is the same as the previous Step 1
except that at the same time as setting u
equal to x
3, you take the two x-indices
of integration and turn them into 
u-indices of integration.

So 0 and π are the two u-indices of 
integration.
2.–3. Steps 2-3 are identical to 2-3 in the pre-
vious example except that you happen
to be dealing with a definite integral in
this problem.
4. Pull the switcheroo. This time in addi-
tion to replacing the x
3 and the x dx
3

with their u-equivalents, you also
replace the x-indices with the u-indices:

If you prefer, you can skip determining

and then evaluate the definite integral
with the original indices of integration.

Solutions to Reverse Differentiation Problems
a
Where (from 0 to 8) does A g equal zero? At about x = 2 or 21⁄2 and about x = 6.
A g equals zero twice between 0 and 8. First at about x = 2 or 21⁄2 where the negative area begin-
ning at x = 1 cancels out the positive area between x = 1⁄2 and x = 1. The second zero of A g is
roughly at 6 (see the dotted line in the figure). After the first zero at about 2, negative area is
added between 2 and 4. The positive area from 4 to 6 roughly cancels that out, so A g returns
to zero at about 6.
b
Where (from x
0
=
to x
8
=
) does A g reach 
a. its maximum value? A g reaches its max at x = 8. After the zero at x = 6, A g grows by about
4 or 41⁄2 square units by the time it gets to 8.
b. its minimum value? The minimum value of A g is at x = 4 where it equals something like –2.
c
In what intervals between 0 and 8 is A g
a. increasing? A g is increasing from 0 to 1 and from 4 to 8.
b. decreasing? A g is decreasing from 1 to 4.

i. So that area is about 1 or 11⁄4.
There’s a zero at about x = 2 or 21⁄2. Between there and x = 3 there’s very roughly an area of –1,
so A
3
g^ h is about –1.
In problem 2b, you estimate A
4
g^ h to be about –2. Between 4 and 5, there’s sort of a triangular
shape with a rough area of 1⁄2. Thus A
5
g^ h equals about –2 + 1⁄2 or –11⁄2.

You’ll get a math ticket if you put an equal sign in front of the last line because it is not equal to
the line before it. When you don’t change the limits of integration, you get this mixed-up inte-
gral with an integrand in terms of u, but with limits of integration in terms of x (s in this prob-
lem). This may be one reason why the preferred, book method includes switching the limits of
integration — it’s mathematically cleaner. 
Now just antidifferentiate, switch back, and evaluate:

n this chapter, you work on some  complex and challenging integration techniques. The
methods may seem quite difficult at first, but, like with anything, they’re not that bad at
all after some practice.
Integration by Parts: Here’s How u du It
Integration by parts is the counterpart of the product rule for differentiation (see Chapter 6)
because the integrand in question is the product of two functions (usually). Here’s the
method in a nutshell. You split up the two functions in the integrand, differentiate one, inte-
grate the other, then apply the integration-by-parts formula. This process converts the origi-
nal integrand — which you can’t integrate — into an integrand you can integrate. Clear as
mud, right? You’ll catch on to the technique real quick if you use the following LIATE
acronym and the box method in the example. First, here’s the formula:
For integration by parts, here’s what u du: 
udv
uv
vdu
=
- #
#
.
Don’t try to understand that until you work through an example problem. Your first chal-
lenge in an integration by parts problem is to decide what function in your original integrand
will play the role of the u in the formula. Here’s how you do it.
To select your u function, just go down this list; the first function type from this list that’s in
your integrand is your u. Here’s a great acronym to help you pick your u function: LIATE, for 
 Logarithmic
(like lnx)
 Inverse trigonometric
(like arcsin x)
 Algebraic
(like x
4
10
3 -
)
 Trigonometric
(like sinx)
 Exponential
(like 5
x)
I wish I could take credit for this acronym, but credit goes to Herbert Kasube (see his article in
American Mathematical Monthly 90, 1983). I can, however, take credit for the following brilliant
mnemonic devise to help you remember the acronym: Lilliputians In Africa Tackle Elephants.

1. Pick your u function.
The integrand contains a logarithmic
function (first on the LIATE list), so 
ln x is your u. Everything else in the 
integrand — namely x dx
2
— is 
automatically your dv.
2. Use a box like the one in the following
figure to organize the four elements of
the problem. 
Put your u and your dv in the appropri-
ate cells, as the following figure shows.
3. Differentiate u and integrate dv, as the
arrows in the figure show.

Transfiguring Trigonometric Integrals
Don’t you just love trig? I’ll bet you didn’t realize that studying calculus was going to
give you the opportunity to do so much more trig. Remember this next Thanksgiving
when everyone around the dinner table is invited to mention something that they’re
thankful for. 
This section lets you practice integrating expressions containing trigonometric func-
tions. The basic idea is to fiddle with the integrand until you’re able to finish with a 
u-substitution (see Chapter 10). In the next section, you use some fancy trigonometric
substitutions to solve integrals that don’t contain trig functions.

trigonometric substitutions. I’m sure you’ll have no trouble with this technique — it’s
even easier than string theory.

Partaking of Partial Fractions
The basic idea behind the partial fractions technique is what I call “unaddition” of 
fractions. Because 2
1
6
1
3
2
+
=
, had you started with 3
2 , you could have taken it apart — 
or “unadded” it — and arrived at 2
1
6
1
+
. You do the same thing in this section except 
that you do the unadding with rational functions instead of simple fractions.

5. Equate coefficients of like terms.
Because Step 4 only gave you one term,
take a different tack. If you multiply (FOIL)
everything out in the Step 3 equation,
the right side of the equation will
contain a constant term and terms in
,
,
,
,
,
x x
x
x
x
x
and
2
3

6. This equation is
an identity, so the coefficient of, say, the
x
5 term on the right has to equal the co-
efficient of the x
5 term on the left (which
is 0 in this problem). So set the coefficient
of each term on the right equal to the
coefficient of its corresponding term on
the left. Here’s your final result:
1) Constant term:
1 = C
2) x term:
2 = B
3) x
2 term:
0 = A + 2C
4) x
3 term: 
0 = 2B + E + G
5) x
4 term:
0 = 2A + C + D + F
6) x
5 term: 
0 = B + E
7) x
6 term: 
0= A + D
You can quickly obtain the values of all
seven unknowns from these seven equa-
tions, and thus you could have skipped
Step 4. But plugging in roots is so easy,
and the values you get may help you
finish the problem faster, so it’s always a
good thing to do.
And there’s a third way to solve for the
unknowns. You can obtain a system of
equations like the one in this step by
plugging non-root values into x. (Use
small numbers that are easy to calculate
with.) After doing several partial fraction
problems, you’ll get a feel for what com-
bination of the three techniques works
best for each problem. 
From this system of equations, you get
the following values: 
A = –2, B = 2, C = 1, D = 2, E = –2, F = 1, G = –2

ow that you’re an expert at integrating, it’s time to put that awesome power to use to
solve some . . . ahem . . . real-world problems. All right, I admit it — the problems you
see in this chapter won’t seem to bear much connection to reality. But, in fact, integration is
a powerful and practical mathematical tool. Engineers, scientists, and economists, among
others, do important, practical work with integration that they couldn’t do without it. 
Finding a Function’s Average Value
With differentiation, you can determine the maximum and minimum heights of a function, its
steepest points, its inflection points, its concavity, and so on. But there’s a simple question
about a function that differentiation cannot answer: What’s the function’s average height?
To answer that, you need integration. 
Q.
What’s the average value of sinx between
0 and π?

Finding the Area between Curves

of shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles, parallelograms, kites, and so on. Big deal.
With integration, you can determine things like the area between f

Volumes of Weird Solids: No, You’re 
Never Going to Need This
Integration works by cutting something up into an infinite number of infinitesimal
pieces and then adding the pieces up to compute the total. In this way, integration is
able to determine the volume of bizarre shapes: It cuts the shapes up into thin pieces
that have ordinary shapes which can then be handled by ordinary geometry. This sec-
tion shows you three different methods:
 The meat slicer method: This works just like a deli meat slicer — you cut a
shape into flat, thin slices. You then add up the volume of the slices. This
method is used for odd, sometimes asymmetrical shapes.
 The disk/washer method: With this method, you cut up the given shape into
thin, flat disks or washers (you know — like pancakes or squashed donuts). Used
for shapes with circular cross-sections.
 The cylindrical shell method: Here, you cut your volume up into thin nested
shells. Each one fits snugly inside the next widest one, like telescoping tubes or
nested Russian dolls. Also used for shapes with circular cross-sections.
222

Q.
What’s the volume of the shape shown in
the following figure? Its base is formed by
the functions f
x
x
=
^ h
and g x
x
= -

.
Its cross-sections are isosceles triangles
whose heights grow linearly from zero at
the origin to 1 when x = 1.
(1, –1)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
h=1
g(x) = –√x
y
x
f(x) = √x
A.
The volume is 2⁄5 cubic units.
1. Always try to sketch the figure first (of
course, I’ve done it for you here).
2. Indicate on your sketch a representative
thin slice of the volume in question. 
This slice should always be perpendicu-
lar to the axis or direction along which
you are integrating. In other words, if
your integrand contains, say, a dx, your
slice should be perpendicular to the 
x-axis. Also, the slice should not be at
either end of the 3-dimensional figure
or at any other special place. Rather, it
should be “in the middle of nowhere.”
3. Express the volume of this slice.
It’s easy to show — trust me — that the
height of each triangle is the same as its
x-coordinate. Its base goes from 
x
-
up
to 
x and is thus 
x
2
. And its thickness
is dx.
Therefore,

Q.
Using the disk/washer method, what’s the
volume of the glass that makes up the vase
shown in the following figure?
A.
The volume is 
π
2
45 .
First, here’s how the vase is “created.”
The light gray shaded area shown in the
figure lies between 
x and .
x
75
1
-
from x = 0 to x = 9. The three-dimensional
vase shape is generated by revolving the
shaded area about the x-axis. 
1. Sketch the 3-D shape (already done for
you).
2. Indicate a representative slice (see the
dark gray shaded area in the figure).
3. Express the volume of the representa-
tive slice.
A representative slice in a washer prob-
lem looks like — can you guess? — a
washer. See the following figure.

the hole an area of r

cross-sectional area is R

4. Add up the washers by integrating from
0 to 9. 
But wait; did you notice the slight snag in
this problem? The “washers” from x = 0
to x = 1 have no holes so there’s no little-
r circle to subtract from the big-R circle.
A washer without a hole is called a disk,
but you treat it the same as a washer
except you don’t subtract a hole.
5. Add up the disks from 0 to 1 and
the washers from 1 to 9 for the total
volume.

Part IV: Integration and Infinite Series 
Q.
Now tip the same glass vase up vertically.
This time find the volume of its glass with
the cylindrical shells method. See the 
following figure. (Did you notice that the
shape of the vase is now somewhat differ-
ent? Sorry about that.)
A.
The volume is 
π
2
45 .
Again, this is the same vase as in the
disk/washer example, but this time
it’s represented by different functions.
In a random act of kindness, I figured
the new functions for you. 
1. Express the volume of your representa-
tive shell.
To figure the volume of a representative
shell, imagine taking the label off a can of
soup — it’s a rectangle, right? The area is
base height
$
and the base is the circum-
ference of the can. So the area is 
rh
π
2
.
(r equals x and h depends on the given
functions.) The thickness of the shell is
dx, so its volume is 
rhdx
π
2
. 
3√2, 9

(0, 0)

f(x) = x2
g(x) =     x2 + 1

Wait! Another snag — similar to but unre-
lated to the one in the last example. The
smaller shells, with right edges at x = 0 
up to x
2
3
2
=
, have heights that meas-
ure from f
x
^ h up to g x
^ h. But the larger 
shells, with right edges at x
2
3
2
=
to 
x = 3, have heights that measure from
f
x
^ h up to 9. So you’ve got to integrate
the two batches of shells separately.

Amazing! This actually agrees (which, of

the washer method. By the way, I got a

problems. Your practice problems won’t

Integrate from 0 to h along the positive side

Arc Length and Surfaces of Revolution
Integration determines the length of a curve by cutting it up into an infinite number of
infinitesimal segments, each of which is sort of the hypotenuse of a tiny right triangle.
Then your pedestrian Pythagorean Theorem does the rest. The same basic idea applies

Getting Your Hopes Up with L’Hôpital’s Rule
This powerful little rule enables you to easily compute limits that are either difficult or
impossible without it. 
L’Hôpital’s Rule: When plugging the arrow-number into a limit expression gives you 0/0
or 
/
3 3, you replace the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives
and do the limit problem again — repeating this process if necessary — until you
arrive at a limit you can solve.
If you’re wondering why this limit rule is in the middle of this chapter about integra-
tion, it’s because you need L’Hôpital’s Rule for the next section and the next chapter.

Disciplining Those Improper Integrals
In this section, you bring some discipline to integrals that misbehave by going up,
down, left, or right to infinity. You handle infinity, as usual, with limits. Here’s an inte-
gral that goes up to infinity:
Q.
Evaluate 
x dx

-#
.
A.
The area is infinite.
1. Check whether the function is defined
everywhere between and at the limits
of integration. 
You note that when x = 0, the function
shoots up to infinity. So you’ve got an
improper integral. In a minute, you’ll see
what happens if you fail to note this.
2. Break the integral in two at the critical
x-value.

Therefore, this limit does not exist (DNE).
Warning: If you split up an integral in
two and one piece equals 3 and the
other equals 3
-
, you cannot add the two
to obtain an answer of zero. When this
happens, the limit DNE. 
Now, watch what happens if you fail to
notice that this function is undefined at

The lines y = x, y = 2x – 5, and y = –2x + 3 form a triangle in the first and second quadrants.
What’s the area of this triangle? The area is 6.
1. Graph the three lines.
2. Find the three points of intersection.
a. y = x intersects 
b. y = x intersects 
c. y = 2x – 5 intersects
y = 2x – 5 at x = 2x – 5
y = –2x + 3 at x = –2x + 3
y = –2x + 3 at 2x – 5 = –2x + 3
x = 5 and, thus, y = 5
x = 1 and, thus, y = 1
x = 2 and, thus, y = –1
3. Integrate to find the area from x = 1 to x = 2; y = x is on the top and y = –2x + 3 is on the

Grand total from Steps 3 and 4 equals 6.
Granted, using calculus for this problem is loads of fun, but it’s totally unnecessary. If you cut
the triangle into two triangles — corresponding to Steps 3 and 4 above — you can get the total
area with simple coordinate geometry.

You want to express the side of your representative slice as a function of y (and the constants,

The volume of your representative square slice equals its cross-sectional area times its thick-

In This Chapter

 Tests, tests, and more tests
I
n this chapter, you look at something that’s really quite amazing if you stop to think about
it: sums of numbers that never end. Seriously, the sums of numbers in this chapter — if
written out completely — would not fit in our universe. But despite the never-ending nature
of these sums, some of them add up to a finite number! These are called convergent series.
The rest are called divergent. Your task in this chapter is to decide which are which.
The Nifty nth Term Test 
Because the mere beginning terms of any given sequence would completely fill the universe,
and because the nth term is way beyond that, where is it? Does it really exist or is it only a
figment of your imagination? If a tree falls in a forest and no one’s there to hear it, does it
make a sound?
First, a couple definitions. A sequence is a finite or infinite list of numbers (we will be dealing
only with infinite sequences). When you add up the terms of a sequence, the sequence
becomes a series. For example, 
1,  2,  4,  8,  16,  32,  64, . . . is a sequence, and
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + . . . is the related series.
If lim a
0
n
n !
" 3
, then 
a n
!
diverges. In English, this says that if a series’ underlying sequence 
does not converge to zero, then the series must diverge. 
It does not follow that if a series’ underlying sequence converges to zero then the series will
definitely converge. It may converge, but there’s no guarantee.

A.
It diverges.
You can answer this question with
common sense if your calc teacher
allows such a thing. As n gets larger and 
larger, 
n
1

-
increases and gets closer 
and closer to one. And when you take
any root of a number like 0.9, it gets
bigger — and the higher the root index, 
the bigger the answer is. So

n

has 
to get larger as n increases and thus 
lim

n

" 3
cannot possibly equal zero. 
The series, therefore, diverges by the nth
term test.
If your teacher is a stickler for rigor, you
can do the following: Plugging in 3
produces 1

Testing Three Basic Series

series are convergent or divergent.

If r

the wall, then halfway again, then half the remaining distance, and so on? Those
steps make up a geometric series.
 p-series: The p-series

rare, so I won’t make you practice any problems. 
When analyzing the series in this section and the rest of the chapter, remember that
multiplying a series by a constant never affects whether it converges or diverges. For 
example, if 
u n
n

3

converges, then so will 
u

Three Comparison Tests 
With the three comparison tests, you compare the series in question to a benchmark
series. If the benchmark converges, so does the given series; if the benchmark
diverges, the given series does as well.
 The direct comparison test: Given that 
a
b
0
n
n
#
#
for all n, if 
b n
!
converges, so 
does 
a n
!
, and if 
a n
!
diverges, so does 
b n
!
.
This could be called the well, duhh test. All it says is that a series with terms
equal to or greater than the terms of a divergent series must also diverge, and
that a series with terms equal to or less than the terms of a convergent series
must also converge.
 The limit comparison test: For two series 
a n
!
and 
b n
!
, if 
>
a
0
n
, 
>
b
0
n
and 
lim b
a
L
n
n
n =
" 3
, where L is finite and positive, then either both series converge or 
both diverge.
 The integral comparison test: If f
x
^ h is positive, continuous, and decreasing for 
all x
1
$
and if a
f n
n=
^ h, then 
a n
n
1
3
=!
and 
f
x dx
1
3
# ^ h
either both converge or both 
diverge. Note that for some strange reason, other books don’t refer to this as a
comparison test, despite the fact that the logic of the three tests in this section is
the same.
Use one or more of the three comparison tests to determine the convergence or diver-
gence of the series in the practice problems. Note that you can often solve these 
problems in more than one way.

whether you can use the integral com-
parison test.

integrate this expression.
Sure. It’s an easy u-substitution.

Ratiocinating the Two “R” Tests
Here you practice the ratio test and the root test. With both tests, a result less than 1
means that the series in question converges; a result greater than 1 means that the
series diverges; and a result of 1 tells you nothing.
 The ratio test: Given a series 
u n
!
, consider the limit of the ratio of a term to the 
previous term, lim u
u
n
n
n
1
" 3
+ . If this limit is less than 1, the series converges. If it’s 
greater than 1 (this includes 3), the series diverges. And if it equals 1, the ratio
test tells you nothing.
 The root test: Note its similarity to the ratio test. Given a series 
u n
!
, consider 
the limit of the nth root of the nth term, lim
u
n
n
n
" 3
. If this limit is less than 1, the 
series converges. If it’s greater (including 3), the series diverges. And if it equals
1, the root test says nothing.
The ratio test is a good test to try if the series involves factorials like !
n or where n is
in the power like 2
n. The root test also works well when the series contains nth
powers. If you’re not sure which test to try first, start with the ratio test — it’s often
the easier to use.
Sometimes it’s useful to have an idea about the convergence or divergence of a series
before using one of the tests to prove convergence or divergence.

Alternating Series
Alternating series look just like any other series except that they contain an extra 
1
n
-
^
h
or 
1
n
1
-
+
^
h
. This extra term causes the terms of the series to alternate between positive
and negative.
An alternating series converges if two conditions are met:
1. Its nth term converges to zero.
2. Its terms are non-increasing — in other words, each term is either smaller than
or the same as its predecessor (ignoring the minus sign). 
For the problems in this section, determine whether the series converges or diverges.
If it converges, determine whether the convergence is absolute or conditional.
If you take a convergent alternating series and make all the terms positive and it still
converges, then the alternating series is said to converge absolutely. If, on the other
hand, the series of positive terms diverges, then the alternating series converges 
conditionally.

The series is conditionally convergent.
If you make this a series of positive
terms, it becomes a p-series with p
2
1
=
,
which you know diverges. Thus, the
above alternating series is not absolutely
convergent. It is, however, conditionally
convergent because it obviously satisfies
the two conditions of the alternating
series test: 
1. The nth term converges to zero.
lim

2. The terms are non-increasing.
The series is thus conditionally 
convergent.

good news for you. The bad news is that you’re wrong — you have to use the p-series test to
find out whether this converges or not (check out the solution to problem 5). The good news is
that you made this mistake here instead of on a test. 
Don’t forget that the nth term test is no help in determining the convergence or divergence of a
series when the underlying sequence converges to zero.

Thus, this is not a geometric series, and the geometric series rule does not apply. Can you
guess whether this series converges or not (assuming the pattern 8, 12, 16, 20 continues)? You
can prove that this series diverges by using the limit comparison test (see problem 10) with the
harmonic series (see problem 5).

Ten Things about Limits, Continuity,
and Infinite Series 
In This Chapter
 When limits, continuity, and derivatives don’t exist
 Ten tests for convergence
I
n this very short chapter, I give you two great mnemonics for memorizing a great deal
about limits, continuity, derivatives, and infinite series. If I do say so myself, you’re get-
ting a lot of bang for your buck here. 
The 33333 Mnemonic
This mnemonic is a memory aid for limits, continuity, and derivatives. First, note that I’ve put
the word “limil” under the five threes. That’s “limit” with the t changed to an l. Also note the
nice parallel between “limil” and the second mnemonic in this chapter, the 13231 mnemonic —
in both cases, you’ve got two pairs surrounding a single letter or number in the center. 
3 3 3 3 3
l i m i l
First 3 over the “l”: 3 parts to the definition 
of a limit
You can find the formal definition of a limit in Chapter 3. This mnemonic helps you remember
that it’s got three parts. And — take my word for it — just that is usually enough to help you
remember what the three parts are. Try it.

Fifth 3 over the “l”: 3 cases 
where a limit fails to exist
The three cases are 
 At a vertical asymptote. This is an infinite discontinuity.
 At a jump discontinuity.
 With the limit at infinity or negative infinity of an oscillating function like lim
x " 3 cos x
where the function keeps oscillating up and down forever, never honing in on a
single y-value.
Second 3 over the “i”: 3 parts to 
the definition of continuity
First notice the oh-so-clever fact that the letter i can’t be drawn without taking your
pen off the paper and thus that it’s not continuous. This will help you remember that
the second and fourth 3s concern continuity.
The three-part, formal definition of continuity is in Chapter 3. The mnemonic will help
you remember that it’s got three parts. And — just like with the definition of a limit —
that’s enough to help you remember what the three parts are.
Fourth 3 over the “i”: 3 cases where 
continuity fails to exist
The three cases are
 A removable discontinuity — the highfalutin calculus term for a hole.
 An infinite discontinuity.
 A jump discontinuity.
Third 3 over the “m”: 3 cases where 
a derivative fails to exist
Note that m often stands for slope, right? And the slope is the same thing as the 
derivative. The three cases where it fails are
 At any type of discontinuity.
 At a cusp: a sharp point or corner along a function (this only occurs in weird
functions).
 At a vertical tangent. (A vertical line has an undefined slope and thus an undefined
derivative.)
266
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The 13231 Mnemonic
This mnemonic helps you remember the ten tests for the convergence or divergence
of an infinite series covered in Chapter 13. 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 10. Got it?
First 1: The nth term test of divergence
For any series, if the nth term doesn’t converge to zero, the series diverges.
Second 1: The nth term test of convergence
for alternating series
The real name of this test is the alternating series test. But I’m referring to it as the nth
term test of convergence because that’s a pretty good way to think about it, because it
has a lot in common with the nth term test of divergence, because these two tests make
nice bookends for the other eight tests, and, last but not least, because it’s my book.
An alternating series will converge if 1) its nth term converges to 0, and 2) each term is
less than or equal to the preceding term (ignoring the negative signs).
Note the following very nice parallel between the two nth term tests: with the nth term
test of divergence, if the nth term fails to converge to zero, then the series fails to con-
verge, but it is not true that if the nth term succeeds in converging to zero, then the
series must succeed in converging.
With the alternating series nth term test, it’s the other way around (sort of). If the test
succeeds, then the series succeeds in converging, but it is not true that if the test fails,
then the series must fail to converge.
First 3: The three tests with names
This “3” helps you remember the three types of series that have names: geometric series
(which converge if 
<
r
1), p-series (which converge if p > 1), and telescoping series.
Second 3: The three comparison tests
The direct comparison test, the limit comparison test, and the integral comparison test
all work the same way. You compare a given series to a known benchmark series. If the
benchmark converges, so does the given series, and ditto for divergence.
The 2 in the middle: The two R tests
The ratio test and the root test make a coherent pair because for both tests, if the limit
is less than 1, the series converges; if the limit is greater than 1, the series diverges;
and if the limit equals 1, the test tells you nothing.

Ten Things You Better Remember
about Differentiation
In This Chapter
 Psst, over here
 The difference quotient
 Extrema, concavity, and inflection points
 The product and quotient rules
I
n this chapter, I give you ten important things you should know about differentiation.
Refer to these pages often. When you get these ten things down cold, you’ll have taken a
not-insignificant step toward becoming a differentiation expert.
The Difference Quotient
The formal definition of a derivative is based on the difference quotient:
lim
f
x
h
f
x
h
f
x
h
o
=
+
-
"
l^
^
^
h
h
h; this says basically the same thing as slope
run
rise
=
.
The First Derivative Is a Rate
A first derivative tells you how much y changes per unit change in x. For example, if y is in
miles and x is in hours, and if at some point along the function, y goes up 3 when x goes over 1,
you’ve got 3 mph. That’s the rate and that’s the derivative.
The First Derivative Is a Slope
In the previous example, when y goes up 3 (the rise) as x goes over 1 (the run), the slope
(rise/run) at that point of the function would be 3 of course. That’s the slope and that’s the
derivative.

Extrema, Sign Changes, 
and the First Derivative
When the sign of the first derivative changes from positive to negative or vice-versa,
that means that you went up then down (and thus passed over the top of a hill, a local
max), or you went down then up (and thus passed through the bottom of a valley, a
local min). In both of these cases of local extrema, the first derivative usually will equal
zero, though it may be undefined (if the local extremum is at a cusp). Also, note that if
the first derivative equals zero, you may have a horizontal inflection point rather than a
local extremum.
The Second Derivative and Concavity
A positive second derivative tells you that a function is concave up (like a spoon holding
water or like a smile). A negative second derivative means concave down (like a spoon
spilling water or like a frown).
Inflection Points and Sign Changes in 
the Second Derivative
Note the very nice parallels between second derivative sign changes and first derivative
sign changes described in the section above.
When the sign of the second derivative changes from positive to negative or vice-versa,
that means that the concavity of the function changed from up to down or down to up.
In either case, you’re likely at an inflection point (though you could be at a cusp). At an
inflection point, the second derivative will usually equal zero, though it may be unde-
fined if there’s a vertical tangent at the inflection point. Also, if the second derivative
equals zero, that does not guarantee that you’re at an inflection point. The second
derivative can equal zero at a point where the function is concave up or down (like, for
example, at x = 0 on the curve y = x4).
The Product Rule
The derivative of a product of two functions equals the derivative of the first times the 
second plus the first times the derivative of the second. In symbols, dx

The Quotient Rule
The derivative of a quotient of two functions equals the derivative of the top times the
bottom minus the top times the derivative of the bottom, all over the bottom squared.

Note that the numerator of the quotient rule is identical to the product rule except for
the subtraction. For both rules, you begin by taking the derivative of the first thing you
read: the left function in a product and the top function in a quotient.

“PSST,” Here’s a Good Way to Remember
the Derivatives of Trig Functions
Take the last three letters in PSST and write down the trig functions that begin with
those letters: secant, secant, tangent. Below these write their co-functions, cosecant,
cosecant, cotangent (add a negative sign). Then add arrows. The arrows point to the
derivatives, for example, the arrow after secant points to its derivative, sec tan
$
; and
the arrow next to tangent points backwards to its derivative, sec

sec →sec ←tan

gration rules and make them an integral part of your being.
The Trapezoid Rule
The trapezoid rule will give you a fairly good approximation of the area under a curve in the
event that you’re unable to — or you choose not to — obtain the exact area with integration.

The Indefinite Integral

# ^ h
, is the family of all antiderivatives of f
x
^ h. That’s 
why your answer has to end with “+ C.” For example, 
xdx

parabolas of the form x

Given an area function A f that sweeps out area under f t^ h, 
A

f t dt

^

,
the rate at which area is being swept out is equal to the height of the original function.
So, because the rate is the derivative, the derivative of the area function equals the
original function:
.

The Definite Integral
In essence, what all definite integrals, 
f
x dx
a
b
# ^ h
, do is to add up an infinite number of 
infinitesimally small pieces of something to get the total amount of the thing between
a and b. The expression after the integral symbol, f
x dx
^ h
(the integrand), is always a
mathematical expression of a representative piece of the stuff you’re adding up.
A Rectangle’s Height Equals
Top Minus Bottom
If you’re adding up rectangles with a definite integral to get the total area between two
curves, you need an expression for the height of a representative rectangle. This should
be a no-brainer: it’s just the rectangle’s top y-coordinate minus its bottom y-coordinate.
274
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Area Below the x-Axis Is Negative
If you want, say, the area below the x-axis and above y = sin x between π
-
and 0, the top
of a representative rectangle is on the x-axis (the function y = 0) and its bottom is on
sin x. Thus, the height of the rectangle is 0 – sin x, and you use the following definite 
integral to get the area: 
sinx dx
0
π
0
-
-#^
h
, which equals, of course, 
sinx dx
π
0
-
-#
. So this 
negative integral gives you the ordinary positive area. And that’s why an ordinary posi-
tive integral gives you a negative area for the parts of a curve that are below the x-axis.
Integrate in Chunks
When you want the total area between two curves and the “top” function changes
because the curves cross each other, you have to use more than one definite integral.
Each place the curves cross defines the edge of an area you must integrate separately.
(If a function crosses the x-axis, you have to consider y = 0 as the second function and
the x-intercepts as the crossing points.)
