FIBRED CATEGORIES
`a la Jean B´enabou
Thomas Streicher
April 1999 – July 2008
The notion of ﬁbred category was introduced by A. Grothendieck for
purely geometric reasons. The “logical” aspect of ﬁbred categories and, in
particular, their relevance for category theory over an arbitrary base cate-
gory with pullbacks has been investigated and worked out in detail by Jean
B´enabou. The aim of these notes is to explain B´enabou’s approach to ﬁ-
bred categories which is mostly unpublished but intrinsic to most ﬁelds of
category theory, in particular to topos theory and categorical logic.
There is no claim for originality by the author of these notes. On the
contrary I want to express my gratitude to Jean B´enabou for his lectures
and many personal tutorials where he explained to me various aspects of his
work on ﬁbred categories. I also want to thank J.-R. Roisin for making me
available his handwritten notes [Ben2] of Des Cat´egories Fibr´ees, a course
by Jean B´enabou given at the University of Louvain-la-Neuve back in 1980.
The current notes are based essentially on [Ben2] and a few other insights
of J. B´enabou that I learnt from him personally. The last four sections are
based on results of J.-L. Moens’ Th´ese [Moe] from 1982 which itself was
strongly inﬂuenced by [Ben2].

Motivation and Examples
If C is a category then a functor
F : Cop →Set
also called a “presheaf over C” is most naturally considered as a “set varying
over C”.
Of course, one may consider also contravariant functors on C
taking their values not in Set but in some big category of structures like
Grp, Ab, Rng, Sp etc. Typically, a presheaf G : Cop →Grp of groups
appears as a group object in bC = SetCop which is a topos if the category C
is small.
More generally, one may consider “presheaves of categories”
H : Cop →Cat
which notion will soon be axiomatised and generalised to our central notion
of ﬁbred category. But before we consider some examples that (hopefully)
will provide some intuition and motivation.
Example 1.1 Let C be the category of monoids and monoid homomor-
phisms. With every monoid M one may associate the category
H(M) = SetMop
of right actions of M on some set and with every monoid homomorphism
h : N →M one may associate the functor
H(h) = h∗= Sethop : SetMop →SetNop
where h∗(X, α) : X×N →X : (x, b) 7→α(x, h(b)).
♦
Example 1.2 Of course, Example 1.1 can be generalised by taking for C
some subcategory of the category of (small) categories and instead of Set
some other big category K (e.g. K = Ab and C = Cat).
♦
Example 1.3 Let E be an elementary topos (see e.g. [Joh]). Then
E( , Ω) : Eop →Ha
is a contravariant functor from E to the category Ha of Heyting algebras
and their morphisms.
♦
3

Example 1.4 Let C be the category CRng of commutative rings with 1.
Then we may consider the functor
H : CRngop →Cat
where H(R) is the category of R–modules and for a homomorphism h : R′ →
R the functor H(h) performs “restriction of scalars”, i.e. H(h)(M) is the
R′–module with the same addition as M and scalar multiplication given by
r · x = h(r) ·M x.
♦
Example 1.5 Consider the following instance of Example 1.2. Let C = Set
(where sets are considered as small discrete categories) and K = X be some
(typically not small) category. Then we have
Fam(X) : Setop →Cat
where Fam(X)(I) = XI and
Fam(X)(u) = Xu : XI →XJ
for u : J →I in Set.
This example is paradigmatic for Fibred Category Theory `a la B´enabou as it
allows categories over Set to be considered as ﬁbrations over Set. Replacing
Set by more general categories B as e.g. toposes or even just categories with
pullbacks one may develop a fair amount of category theory over base B !
Example 1.6 For a category B with pullbacks we may consider H : Bop →
Cat sending I ∈B to H(I) = B/I and u : J →I in B to the pullback
functor H(u) = u−1 : B/I →B/J which is right adjoint to Σu ≡u ◦(−)
(postcomposition with u).
Notice that this is an example only cum grano salis as u−1 : B/I →B/J
involves some choice of pullbacks and, accordingly, in general we do not have
H(uv) = H(v)◦H(u) but only H(uv) ∼= H(v)◦H(u) where the components of
the natural isomorphism are given by the respective mediating arrows. Such
“functors” preserving composition (and identity) only up to isomorphism
are usuallly called pseudo–functors.
♦
We deﬁnitely do not want to exclude the situation of Example 1.6 as it
allows one to consider the base category B as “ﬁbred over itself”. There-
fore, one might feel forced to accept pseudo–functors and the ensuing bu-
reaucratic handling of “canonical isomorphisms”. However, as we will show
4

immediately one may replace pseudo–functors H : Bop →Cat by ﬁbrations
P : X →B where this bureaucracy will turn out as luckily hidden from us.
To motivate the deﬁnition of a ﬁbration let us consider a functor H :
Bop →Cat from which we will construct the “ﬁbration” P =
R
H : X →
B.
The objects of X are pairs (I, X) where I ∈B and X ∈H(I).
A
morphism in X from (J, Y ) to (I, X) is a pair (u, α) where u : J →I
in B and α : Y →H(u)(X) in H(J).
Composition in X is deﬁned as
follows: for maps (v, β) : (K, Z) →(J, Y ) and (u, α) : (J, Y ) →(I, X) in
R
H their composition (u, α) ◦(v, β) is given by (u ◦v, H(u)(α) ◦β). It is
readily checked that this composition is associative and identities are given
by id(I,X) = (idI, idX). Let P =
R
H : X →B be the functor sending an
object (I, X) in X to I in B and a morphism (u, α) in X to u in B.
Similarly, the pseudo–functor from Example 1.6 may be replaced by the
functor PB ≡∂1 ≡cod : B2 →B where 2 is the partial order 0 →1, i.e.
the ordinal 2. Obviously, PB sends a commuting square
B
f - A
J
b
?
u
- I
a
?
to u. Just as we have written ∂1 for the “codomain” functor cod we will write
∂0 for the “domain” functor dom : B2 →B. As PB allows one to consider B
as ﬁbred over itself and this is fundamental for developing category theory
over B we call PB the fundamental ﬁbration of B.
Let P : X →B be a functor as described above. A morphism ϕ in X
is called vertical iﬀP(ϕ) = id. We write P(I) or XI for the subcategory
of X which appears as “inverse image of I under P”, i.e. which consists of
objects X with P(X) = I and morphisms ϕ with P(ϕ) = idI. If P =
R
H
then (u, α) will be called cartesian iﬀα is an isomorphism and if P = PB
then a morphism in B2 will be called cartesian iﬀthe corresponding square
is a pullback in B.

Basic Deﬁnitions
From the examples in the previous section we destill the following deﬁnition
of ﬁbred category.
Deﬁnition 2.1 Let P : X →B be a functor. A morphism ϕ : Y →X in X
over u := P(ϕ) is called cartesian iﬀfor all v : K →J in B and θ : Z →X
with P(θ) = u ◦v there is a unique morphism ψ : Z →Y with P(ψ) = v
and θ = ϕ ◦ψ.
Z

A morphism α : Y →X is called vertical iﬀP(α) is an identity morphism
in B. For I ∈B we write XI or P(I) for the subcategory of X consisting
of those morphism α with P(α) = idI. It is called the ﬁbre of P over I.
♦
It is straightforward to check that cartesian arrows are closed under
composition and that α is an isomorphism in X iﬀα is a cartesian morphism
over an isomorphism.
Deﬁnition 2.2 P : X →B is a ﬁbration or category ﬁbred over B iﬀfor
all u : J →I in B and X ∈P(I) there is a cartesian arrow ϕ : Y →X over
u called a cartesian lifting of X along u.
♦
Obviously, the functors
R
H and PB of the previous section are examples
of ﬁbrations and the ad hoc notions of “cartesian” as given there coincide
with the oﬃcial one of Deﬁnition 2.2.
Notice that cartesian liftings of X ∈P(I) along u : J →I are unique
up to vertical isomorphism: suppose that ϕ : Y →X and ψ : Z →X are
6

cartesian over u then there exist vertical arrows α : Z →Y and β : Y →Z
with ϕ ◦α = ψ and ψ ◦β = ϕ, respectively, from which it follows by
cartesianness of ϕ and ψ that β ◦α = idZ and α ◦β = idY as ψ ◦β ◦α =
ϕ ◦α = ϕ = ϕ ◦idY and ϕ ◦β ◦α = ψ ◦α = ϕ = ϕ ◦idY .
Deﬁnition 2.3 Let P : X →B and Q : Y →B be ﬁbrations over B.
A cartesian or ﬁbred functor from P to Q is an ordinary functor F : X →Y
such that
(1) Q ◦F = P and
(2) F(ϕ) is cartesian w.r.t. Q whenever ϕ is cartesian w.r.t. P.
If F and G are cartesian functors from P to Q then a cartesian natural
transformation from F to G is an ordinary natural transformation τ : F ⇒
G with τX vertical for every X ∈X.
The ensuing 2-category will be called Fib(B).
♦
Of course, if B is the terminal category then Fib(B) is isomorphic to
the 2-category Cat.
Remark.
What we have called “cartesian” in Deﬁnition 2.1 is usually
called hypercartesian whereas “cartesian” morphisms are deﬁned as follows:
a morphism ϕ : Y →X is called cartesian iﬀfor all ψ : Z →X with
P(ϕ) = P(ψ) there is a unique vertical arrow α : Z →Y with ϕ ◦α = ψ.
Employing this more liberal notion of “cartesian” one has to strengthen
the deﬁnition of ﬁbred category by adding the requirement that cartesian
arrows are closed under composition. It is a simple exercise to show that this
addendum ensures that every cartesian arrow (in the liberal sense) is actually
hypercartesian (i.e. cartesian in the more restrictive sense of our deﬁnition)
and, accordingly, both deﬁnitions of ﬁbred category are equivalent.
As the current notes consider only ﬁbrations for which “cartesian” and
“hypercartesian” are equivalent anyway we have adopted the somewhat non–
canonical Deﬁnition 2.1 as in our context it will not lead to any confusion.
Notice, however, that in more recent (unpublished) work by J. B´enabou
on generalised ﬁbrations the distinction between cartesian arrows (in the
liberal sense) and hypercartesian arrows turns out as crucial.

Split Fibrations and Fibred Yoneda Lemma
If P : X →B is a ﬁbration then using axiom of choice for classes we
may select for every u : J →I in B and X ∈P(I) a cartesian arrow
Cart(u, X) : u∗X →X over u. Such a choice of cartesian liftings is called
a cleavage for or splitting of P.
Such a cleavage induces for every map
u : J →I in B a so-called reindexing functor u∗: P(I) →P(J) in the
following way
u∗X Cart(u, X)
- X
u∗Y
u∗α
?
Cart(u, Y )
- Y
α
?
where u∗α is the unique vertical arrow making the diagram commute. Alas,
in general for composable maps u : J →I and v : K →J in B it does not
hold that
v∗◦u∗= (u ◦v)∗
although the functors are canonically isomorphic via cu,v as shown in the
following diagram

cart.
Cart(u ◦v, X)

where (cu,v)X is the unique vertical arrow making the diagram commute.
Typically, for PB = ∂1 : B2 →B, the fundamental ﬁbration for a
category B with pullbacks, we do not know how to choose pullbacks in a
functorial way. Of course, condition (1) is always easy to achieve but the
8

problem is condition (2) as how should one choose canonical pullbacks in a
way that they are closed under composition?
But, nevertheless, often such a functorial choice of cartesian liftings is
possible in particular situations.
Deﬁnition 3.1 A cleavage Cart of a ﬁbration P : X →B is called split or
a splitting of P iﬀthe following two conditions are satiﬁed
(1) Cart(id, X) = idX
(2) Cart(u◦v, X) = Cart(u, X) ◦Cart(v, u∗X).
A split ﬁbration is a ﬁbration endowed with a split cleavage.
A split cartesian functor between split ﬁbrations is a cartesian functor F
between split ﬁbrations which, moreover, preserves chosen cartesian liftings,
i.e. satisﬁes
F(Cart(u, X)) = Cart(u, F(X))
for all u : J →I in the base and all X over I.
We write Sp(B) for
the ensuing category of split ﬁbrations over B and split cartesian functors
between them.
♦
Warning.
(1) There are ﬁbrations which are not splitable. Consider for example the
groups B = (Z2, +2) and X = (Z, +) (considered as categories) and the
ﬁbration P : X →B : a 7→P(a) := a mod 2. A splitting of P would give
rise to a functor F : B →X with P ◦F = IdB but that cannot exist as there
is no group homomorphism h : (Z2, +2) →(Z, +) with h(1) an odd number
of Z.
(2) Notice that diﬀerent splittings of the same ﬁbration may give rise to
the same presheaf of categories. Consider for example H : 2op →Ab with
H(1) = O, the zero group, and H(0) some non–trivial abelian group A.
Then every g ∈A induces a splitting Cartg of P ≡
R
H by putting
Cartg(u, ⋆) = (u, g)
for u : 0 →1 in 2
but all these Cartg induce the same functor 2op →Cat, namely H !
In the light of (2) it might appear as more appropriate to deﬁne split
ﬁbrations over B as functors from Bop to Cat. The latter may be considered
as categories internal to bB = SetBop and organise into the (2-)category
cat(B) of categories and functors internal to bB. However, as Sp(B) and
9

cat(B) are strongly equivalent as 2-categories we will not distiguish them
any further in the rest of these notes.
Next we will presented the Fibred Yoneda Lemma making precise the
relation between ﬁbred categories and split ﬁbrations (over the same base).
Fibred Yoneda Lemma
Though, as we have seen, not every ﬁbration P ∈Fib(B) is isomorphic to
a splitable ﬁbration there is always a distinguished equivalent split ﬁbration
as ensured by the so-called Fibred Yoneda Lemma. Before giving the full
formulation of the Fibred Yoneda Lemma we motivate the construction of a
canonical split ﬁbration Sp(P) equivalent to a given ﬁbration P ∈Fib(B).
For an object I ∈B let I = PI = ∂0 : B/I →B be the discrete
ﬁbration corresponding to the representable presheaf YB(I) = B(−, I) and
for u : J →I in B let u = Pu = Σu be the cartesian functor from J to
I as given by postcomposition with u and corresponding to the presheaf
morphism YB(u) = B(−, u) : YB(J) →YB(I). Then cartesian functors from
I to P : X →B in Fib(B) correspond to choices of cartesian liftings for an
object X ∈P(I). There is an obvious functor EP,I : Fib(B)(I, P) →P(I)
sending F to F(idI) and τ : F →G to τidI : F(idI) →G(idI). It is a
straightforward exercise to show that EP,I is full and faithful and using the
axiom of choice for classes we also get that EP,I is surjective on objects, i.e.
that EP,I : Fib(B)(I, P) →P(I) is an equivalence of categories. Now we
can deﬁne Sp(P) : Bop →Cat as
Sp(P)(I) = Fib(B)(I, P)
for objects I in B and
Sp(P)(u) = Fib(B)(u, P) : Sp(P)(I)→Sp(P)(J)
for morphisms u : J →I in B. Let us write U(Sp(P)) for
R
Sp(P), the
ﬁbration obtained from Sp(P) via the Grothendieck construction. Then the
EP,I as described above arise as the components of a cartesian functor EP :
U(Sp(P)) →P sending objects (I, X) in U(Sp(P)) =
R
Sp(P) to EP,I(X)
and morphism (u, α) : G →F in U(Sp(P)) =
R
Sp(P) over u : J →I to
the morphism F(u:u→idI) ◦αidJ : G(idJ) →F(idI) in X. As all ﬁbres of
EP are equivalences it follows1 that EP is an equivalence in the 2-category
Fib(B).
1We leave it as an exercise to show that under assumption of axiom of choice for classes
a cartesian functor is an equivalence in Fib(B) iﬀall its ﬁbres are equivalence of categories.
10

Actually, the construction of Sp(P) from P is just the object part of a 2-
functor Sp : Fib(B) →Sp(B) right adjoint to the forgetful 2-functor from
Sp(B) to Fib(B) as described in the following theorem (which, however,
will not be used any further in the rest of these notes).
Theorem 3.1 (Fibred Yoneda Lemma)
For every category B the forgetful 2-functor U : Sp(B) →Fib(B) has a right
2-adjoint Sp : Fib(B) →Sp(B), i.e. there is an equivalence of categories
Fib(B)(U(S), P) ≃Sp(B)(S, Sp(P))
naturally in S ∈Sp(B) and P ∈Fib(B), whose counit EP : U(Sp(P)) →P
at P is an equivalence in Fib(B) for all P ∈Fib(B).
However, in general the unit HS : S →Sp(U(S)) at S ∈Sp(B) is not an
equivalence in Sp(B) although U(HS) is always an equivalence in Fib(B).
Proof.
The functor U : Sp(B) →Fib(B) just forgets cleavages.
The
object part of its right adjoint Sp is as described above, namely
Sp(P)(I) = Fib(B)(I, P)
Sp(P)(u) = Fib(B)(u, P)
for P ∈Fib(B). For cartesian functors F : P →Q in Fib(B) we deﬁne
Sp(F) : Sp(P) →Sp(Q) as
Sp(F)I = Fib(B)(I, F)
for objects I in B. Under assumption of axiom of choice for classes the
counit for U ⊣Sp at P is given by the equivalence EP : U(Sp(P)) →P as
described above. The unit HS : S →Sp(U(S)) for U ⊣Sp at S ∈Sp(B)
sends X ∈P(I) to the cartesian functor from I to P which chooses cartesian
liftings as prescribed by the underlying cleavage of S and arrows α : X →Y
in P(I) to the cartesian natural transformation HS(α) : HS(X) →HS(Y )
with HS(α)idI = α. We leave it as a tedious, but straightforward exercise
to show that these data give rise to an equivalence
Fib(B)(U(S), P) ≃Sp(B)(S, Sp(P))
naturally in S and P.
As all components of HS are equivalences of categories it follows that
U(HS) is an equivalence in Fib(B). However, it cannot be the case that
all HS are equivalences as otherwise a split cartesian functor F were an
11

equivalence in Sp(B) already if U(F) is an equivalence in Fib(B) and this
is impossible as not every epi in bB is a split epi.
□
As EP : U(Sp(P)) →P is always an equivalence it follows that for
ﬁbrations P and Q
SpP,Q : Fib(B)(P, Q) →Sp(B)(Sp(P), Sp(Q))
is an equivalence of categories.
However, in general SpP,Q is not an isomorphism of categories. An ar-
bitrary split cartesian functor G : Sp(P) →Sp(Q) corresponds via the
2-adjunction U ⊣Sp to a cartesian functor EQ ◦U(G) : U(Sp(P)) →Q
which, however, need not factor as EQ ◦U(G) = F ◦EP for some carte-
sian F : P →Q.2 One may characterise the split cartesian functors of the
form Sp(F) for some cartesian F : P →Q as those split cartesian functors
G : Sp(P) →Sp(Q) satisfying Sp(EQ)◦Sp(U(G)) = G◦Sp(EP ). One easily
sees that this condition is necessary and if it holds then an F with G = Sp(F)
can be obtained as EQ◦U(G)◦E′
P for some E′
P with EP ◦E′
P = IdP because
we have Sp(F) = Sp(EQ ◦U(G) ◦E′
P ) = Sp(EQ) ◦Sp(U(G)) ◦Sp(E′
P ) =
G ◦Sp(EP ) ◦Sp(E′
P ) = G ◦Sp(EP ◦E′
P ) = G.
Although Sp is not full and faithful the adjunction U ⊣Sp neverthe-
less is of the type “full reﬂective subcategory” albeit in the appropriate
2-categorical sense. This suggests that Fib(B) is obtained from Sp(B) by
“freely quasi-inverting weak equivalences in Fib(B)” which can be made
precise as follows.
A split cartesian functor F is called a weak equivalence iﬀall its ﬁbres are
equivalences of categories, i.e. iﬀU(F) is an equivalence in Fib(B). Let us
write Σ for the class of weak equivalences in Sp(B). For a 2-category X and
a 2-functor Φ : Sp(B) →X we say that Φ quasi-inverts a morphism F in
Sp(B) iﬀΦ(F) is an equivalence in X. Obviously, the 2-functor U : Sp(B) →
Fib(B) quasi-inverts all weak equivalences. That U freely inverts the maps
in Σ can be seen as follows. Suppose that a 2-functor Φ : Sp(B) →X quasi-
inverts all weak equivalences. Then there exists a 2-functor Ψ : Fib(B) →
X unique up to equivalence with the property that Ψ ◦U ≃Φ.
As by
assumption Φ quasi-inverts weak equivalences we have Φ ◦Sp ◦U ≃Φ
because all HS are weak equivalences. On the other hand if Ψ ◦U ≃Φ then
we have Ψ ≃Ψ ◦U ◦Sp ≃Φ ◦Sp (because all EP are equivalences) showing
that Ψ is unique up to equivalence.
2For example, if Q = U(Sp(P)) and EQ ◦U(G) = Id U(Sp(P )) and EP is not one-to-one
on objects which happens to be the case whenever cartesian liftings are not unique in P.

Closure Properties of Fibrations
In this section we will give some examples of ﬁbrations and constructions of
new ﬁbrations from already given ones. Keeping in mind that we think of
ﬁbrations over B as generalisations of ﬁbrations of the form Fam(C) over
Set it will appear that most of these constructions are generalisations of
well-known constructions in Cat.
Fundamental Fibrations
For a category B the codomain functor
PB ≡∂1 : B2 →B
is a ﬁbration if and only if B has pullbacks. In this case PB is called the
fundamental ﬁbration of B.
Externalisations of Internal Categories
Let C be a category internal to B as given by domain and codomain maps
d0, d1 : C1 →C0, the identity map i : C0 →C1 and a composition map
m : C1 ×C0 C1 →C1. Then one may construct the ﬁbration PC : C →B
called externalisation of C. The objects of C over I are pairs (I, a : I →C0)
and a morphism in C from (J, b) to (I, a) over u : J →I is given by a
morphism f : J →C1 with d0 ◦f = b and d1 ◦f = a ◦u. Composition in C
is deﬁned using m analogous to Fam(C). The ﬁbration PC itself is deﬁned
as
PC(I, a) = I
PC(u, f) = u
and the cartesian lifting of (I, a) along u : J →I is given by i ◦a ◦u.
In particular, every object I ∈B can be considered as a discrete internal
category of B. Its externalisation is given by PI = ∂0 : B/I →B.
Change of Base and Glueing
If P ∈Fib(B) and F : C →B is an ordinary functor then F ∗P ∈Fib(C)
where

is a pullback in Cat. One says that ﬁbration F ∗P is obtained from P by
change of base along F. Notice that (u, ϕ) in Y is cartesian w.r.t. F ∗P iﬀ
ϕ is cartesian w.r.t. P. Accordingly, K preserves cartesianness of arrows as
K(u, ϕ) = ϕ.
When instantiating P by the fundamental ﬁbration PB we get the fol-
lowing important particular case of change of base

usually called glueing construction or (Artin) glueing. Typically, in applica-
tions the functor F will be the inverse image part of a geometric morphism
F ⊣U : E →S between toposes. In this case Gl(F) = E↓F is again a topos
and the functor gl(F) : E↓F →S is logical, i.e. preserves all topos structure.
Actually, for this to hold it suﬃces already that F is a pullback preserving
functor between toposes. The glueing construction will be intrinsic later
on when we discuss the Fibrational Theory of Geometric Morphisms `a la
J.-L. Moens.
We write Fib for the (non–full) subcategory of Cat2 whose objects are
ﬁbrations and whose morphisms are commuting squares

with K cartesian over F, i.e. where K(ϕ) is cartesian over F(u) whenever
ϕ is cartesian over u. Obviously, Fib is ﬁbred over Cat via the restriction
of ∂1 : Cat2 →Cat to Fib for which we write Fib/Cat : Fib →Cat. A
morphism of Fib is cartesian iﬀit is a pullback square in Cat.
We write Fib(B)/B for the ﬁbration obtained from Fib/Cat by change
of base along the functor Σ : B →Cat sending I to B/I and u : J →I to
Σu : B/J →B/I : v 7→u ◦v.

We leave it as an exercise to show that P : X →B/I is a ﬁbration iﬀPI ◦P is
a ﬁbration over B and P ∈Fib(B)(PI◦P, PI). Accordingly, ﬁbrations over
B/I are understood as I-indexed families of ﬁbrations over B in analogy with
ordinary functors to a discrete category I which are understood I-indexed
families of categories.
Composition and Product of Fibrations
First notice that ﬁbrations are closed under composition. Even more we
have the following
Theorem 4.1 Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration and F : Y →X be an arbitrary

The second condition means that the commuting diagram

is a morphism in Fib. (Notice that due to condition (1) of Theorem 4.1 one
can choose the reindexing functor u∗: YI →YJ in such a way that the
diagram actually commutes. For arbitrary cartesian functors this need not
be possible although for all choices of the u∗the diagram always commutes
up to isomorphism.)
The relevance of Theorem 4.1 is that it characterises “ﬁbred ﬁbrations”
as those ﬁbred functors which are themselves ordinary ﬁbrations.
This
handy characterisation cannot even be formulated in the framework of in-
dexed categories and, therefore, is considered as a typical example of the
superiority of the ﬁbrational point of view.
For ﬁbrations P and Q over B their product P×BQ in Fib(B) is given
by P ◦P ∗Q = Q ◦Q∗P as in

and it follows from Theorem 4.1 that P×BQ is a ﬁbration and that the
projections P ∗Q and Q∗P are cartesian functors.

Exponentiation of Fibrations
For ﬁbrations P and Q over B we want to construct a ﬁbration [P→Q] such
that there is an equivalence
Fib(B)(R, [P→Q]) ≃Fib(B)(R×BP, Q)
naturally in R ∈Fib(B).
Analogous to the construction of exponentials in bB = SetBop the ﬁbred
Yoneda lemma (Theorem 3.1) suggest us to put
[P→Q](I) = Fib(B)(I×BP, Q)
[P→Q](u) = Fib(B)(u×BP, Q)
where u is given by
B/J
Σu

for u : J →I in B. We leave it as a tedious, but straightforward exercise to
verify that
Fib(B)(R, [P→Q]) ≃Fib(B)(R×BP, Q)
holds naturally in R ∈Fib(B).
Notice that we have
Fib(B)(PI×BP, Q) ≃Fib(B/I)(P/I, Q/I)
naturally in I ∈B where P/I = PI∗P and Q/I = PI∗Q are obtained by
change of base along PI. Usually P/I is referred to as “localisation of P to I”.
The desired equivalence follows from the fact that change of base along PI
is right adjoint to postcomposition with PI and the precise correspondence
between F ∈Fib(B)(I×BP, Q) and G ∈Fib(B/I)(P/I, Q/I) is indicated
by the following diagram

The Opposite of a Fibration
If P : X →B is a ﬁbration thought of “as of the form Fam(C)” then one
may want to construct the ﬁbration P op thought of “of the form Fam(Cop)”.
It might be tempting at ﬁrst sight to apply (−)op to the functor P giving
rise to the functor Xop →Bop which, however, has the wrong base even if
it were a ﬁbration (which in general will not be the case). If P =
R
H for
some H : Bop →Cat then one may consider Hop = (−)op ◦H : Bop →Cat,
i.e. the assignment
I 7→H(I)op
u : J →I 7→H(u)op : H(I)op →H(I)op
where (−)op is applied to the ﬁbres of H and to the reindexing functors.
Now we express P op =
R
Hop in terms of P =
R
H directly.
The ﬁbration P op : Y →B is constructed from the ﬁbration P : X →B
in the following way. The objects of Y and X are the same but for X ∈P(I),
Y ∈P(J) and u : J →I the collection of morphisms in Y from Y to X over
u is constructed as follows. It consists of all spans (α, ϕ) with α : Z →Y
vertical and ϕ : Z →X is cartesian over u modulo the equivalence relation
∼Y,u,X (also denoted simply as ∼) where (α, ϕ) ∼Y,u,X (α′, ϕ′) iﬀ
Z
Y

α

ϕ
cart
-
Z′
ι ∼=

cart



for some (necessarily unique) vertical isomorphism ι : Z′ →Z. Composition
of arrows in Y is deﬁned as follows: if [(α, ϕ)]∼: Y →X over u : J →I and
[(β, ψ)]∼: Z →Y over v : K →J then [(α, ϕ)]∼◦[(β, ψ)]∼:= [(β◦eα, ϕ◦eψ)]∼

with eα vertical.
Actually, this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of eψ as mor-
phisms in Y are equivalence classes modulo ∼which forgets about all dis-
tinctions made by choice of cleavages. On objects P op behaves like P and
P op([(α, ϕ)]∼) is deﬁned as P(ϕ). The P op-cartesian arrows are the equiv-
alence classes [(α, ϕ)]∼where α is a vertical isomorphism.
Though most constructions appear more elegant from the ﬁbrational
point of view the construction of P op from P may appear as somewhat less
immediate though (hopefully!) not too unelegant. Notice, however, that for
small ﬁbrations, i.e. externalisations of internal categories, the construction
can be performed as in the case of presheaves of categories as we have
PCop ≃P op
C for internal categories C.
Anyway, we have generalised now enough constructions from ordinary
category theory to the ﬁbrational level so that we can perform (analogues of)
the various constructions of (covariant and contravariant) functor categories
on the level of ﬁbrations. In particular, for a category C internal to a cate-
gory B with pullbacks we may construct the ﬁbration [P op
C →PB] which may
be considered as the ﬁbration of (families of) B-valued presheaves over the
internal category C. Moreover, for categories C and D internal to B the ﬁ-
bration of (families of) distributors from C to D is given by [P op
D ×PC→PB].3
3For an equivalent, but non-ﬁbrational treatment of internal presheaves and distribu-
tors see [Joh].

Internal Sums
Suppose that C is a category. We will identify a purely ﬁbrational prop-
erty of the ﬁbration Fam(C) →Set equivalent to the requirement that the
category C has small sums. This will provide a basis for generalising the
property of “having small sums” to ﬁbrations over arbitrary base categories
with pullbacks.
Suppose that category C has small sums. Consider a family of objects
A = (Ai)i∈I and a map u : I →J in Set. Then one may construct the family
B := (`
i∈u−1(j) Ai)j∈J together with the morphism (u, ϕ) : (I, A) →(J, B)
in Fam(C) where ϕi = ini : Ai →Bu(i) = `
k∈u−1(u(i)) Ak, i.e. the restriction
of ϕ to u−1(j) is the cocone for the sum of the family (Ai)i∈u−1(j).
One readily observes that (u, ϕ) : A →B satisﬁes the following universal
property: whenever v : J →K and (v ◦u, ψ) : A →C then there exists a
unique (v, θ) : B →C such that (v, θ)◦(u, ϕ) = (v ◦u, ψ), i.e. θu(i) ◦ini = ψi
for all i ∈I.
Arrows (u, ϕ) satisfying this universal property are called
cocartesian and are determined uniquely up to vertical isomorphism.
Moreover, the cocartesian arrows of Fam(C) satisfy the following so-
called4 Beck–Chevalley Condition (BCC) which says that for every pullback
K

in Set and cocartesian arrow ϕ : A →B over u it holds that for every
commuting square
C
eϕ- D
A

?
ϕ
- B
ψ
?
over the pullback square (1) in B with ψ and eψ cartesian the arrow eϕ is
cocartesian, too.
Now it is a simple exercise to formulate the obvious generalisation to
ﬁbrations over an arbitrary base category with pullbacks.
4Chevalley had this condition long before Beck who later independently found it again.
20

Deﬁnition 6.1 Let B be a category with pullbacks and P : X →B a ﬁbra-
tion over B. An arrow ϕ : X →Y over u : I →J is called cocartesian iﬀ
for every v : J →K in B and ψ : X →Z over v ◦u there is a unique arrow
θ : Y →Z over v with θ ◦ϕ = ψ.
The ﬁbration P has internal sums iﬀthe following two conditions are satis-
ﬁed.
(1) For every X ∈P(I) and u : I →J in B there exists a cocartesian
arrow ϕ : X →Y over u.
(2) The Beck–Chevalley Condition (BCC) holds, i.e. for every commuting
square in X
C

over a pullback in the base it holds that eϕ is cocartesian whenever ϕ is
cocartesian and ψ and eψ are cartesian.
♦
Remark.
(1) One easily sees that for a ﬁbration P : X →B an arrow ϕ : X →Y is
cocartesian iﬀfor all ψ : X →Z over P(ϕ) there exists a unique vertical
arrow α : Y →Z with α ◦ϕ = ψ.
(2) It is easy to see that BCC of Deﬁnition 6.1 is equivalent to the require-
ment that for every commuting square in X

over a pullback in the base it holds that ψ is cartesian whenever eψ is cartesian

Next we give a less phenomenological explanation of the concept of in-
ternal sums where, in particular, the Beck–Chevalley Condition arises in a
less ad hoc way. For this purpose we ﬁrst generalise the Fam construction
from ordinary categories to ﬁbrations.
21

Deﬁnition 6.2 Let B be a category with pullbacks and P : X →B be a
ﬁbration. Then the family ﬁbration Fam(P) for P is deﬁned as PB◦Fam(P)

The cartesian functor Fam(P) : Fam(P) →PB is called the ﬁbred family

in P↓B. Obviously, the functor ηP preserves cartesianness of arrows, i.e.
ηP is cartesian.
♦
22

Remark.
(1) If Fam(P)(ϕ) is cocartesian w.r.t. PB then ϕ is cartesian w.r.t. Fam(P)
iﬀϕ is cocartesian w.r.t. Fam(P). Moreover, for every morphism

in B2 we have

where ϕa and ϕb are cocartesian w.r.t. PB. Using these two observations
one can show that for ﬁbrations P and Q over B a cartesian functor F :
Fam(P) →Fam(Q) is determined uniquely up to isomorphism by its re-
striction along the inclusion ∆B : B →B2 from which it follows that F is
isomorphic to Fam(∆∗
BF). Thus, up to isomorphism all cartesian functors
from Fam(P) to Fam(Q) are of the form Fam(F) for some cartesian functor
F : P →Q.
(2) Notice, however, that not every cartesian functor Fam(P) →Fam(Q)
over B is isomorphic to one of the form Fam(F) for some cartesian functor
F : P →Q.
An example for this failure is the cartesian functor µP :
Fam2(P) →Fam(P) sending ((X, v), u) to (X, uv) for nontrivial B.5
(3) If X is a category we write Fam(X) for the category of families in X and
Fam(X) : Fam(X) →Set for the family ﬁbration.
The analogon of (1) in ordinary category theory is that for categories X
and Y a cartesian functor F : Fam(X) →Fam(Y) is isomorphic to Fam(F1)
(the ﬁbre of F at 1 ∈Set).
The analogon of (2) in ordinary category theory is that not every or-
dinary functor F : Fam(X) →Fam(Y) is isomorphic to one of the form
Fam(G) for some G : X →Y.
Next we characterise the property of having internal sums in terms of
the family monad Fam.
5One can show that η and µ are natural transformations giving rise to a monad
(Fam, η, µ) on Fib(B).
23

Theorem 6.1 Let B be a category with pullbacks and P : X →B be a
ﬁbration. Then P has internal sums iﬀηP : P →Fam(P) has a ﬁbred left
adjoint `
P : Fam(P) →P , i.e. `
P ⊣ηP where `
P is cartesian and unit
and counit of the adjunction are cartesian natural transformations.
Proof.
The universal property of the unit of the adjunction `
P ⊣ηP at
(u, X) is explicitated in the following diagram

whose left column is the unit at (u, X). From this it follows that η(u,X) :
X →Y is cocartesian over u.
Cartesianness of `
P says that the cartesian arrow f as given by
X

in P↓B is sent by `

`
P f

η(v,Y )

where η(p,X) and η(v,Y ) are the cocartesian units of the adjunction above
p and v, respectively.
Thus, according to the second remark after Def-
inition 6.1 cartesianness of `
P is just the Beck–Chevalley Condition for
internal sums.
24

On the other hand if P has internal sums then the functor `
P left adjoint
to P is given by sending a morphism f in P↓B as given by
X
ψ- Y
K
q - L

to the morphism `
P f over u satisfying

`

ϕ2
?
where ϕ1 and ϕ2 are cocartesian over p and v, respectively. It is easy to check
that `
P is actually left adjoint to ηP using for the units of the adjunction
the cocartesian liftings guaranteed for P. Cartesianness of `
P is easily seen
to be equivalent to the Beck–Chevalley condition.

Internal Products
Of course, by duality a ﬁbration P : X →B has internal products iﬀthe
dual ﬁbration P op has internal sums. After some explicitation (left to the
reader) one can see that the property of having internal products can be
characterised more elementarily as follows.
Theorem 7.1 Let B be a category with pullbacks. Then a ﬁbration P :
X →B has internal products iﬀthe following two conditions are satisﬁed.
(i) For every u : I →J in B and X ∈P(I) there is a span ϕ : u∗E →E,
ε : u∗E →X with ϕ cartesian over u and ε vertical such that for every
span θ : u∗Z →Z, α : u∗Z →X with θ cartesian over u and α vertical
there is a unique vertical arrow β : Z →E such that α = ε◦u∗β where
u∗β is the vertical arrow with ϕ ◦u∗β = β ◦θ as illustrated in the
diagram
u∗Z

Notice that the span (ϕ, ε) is determined uniquely up to vertical iso-
morphism by this universal property and is called an evaluation span
for X along u.
(ii) Whenever

where the lower square is above pullback (1) in B and eε is vertical it
holds that (eϕ, eε) is an evaluation span for ev∗X along eu.
Proof.
Tedious, but straightforward explicitation of the requirement that
P op has internal sums.
□
Condition (ii) is called Beck–Chevally Condition (BCC) for internal
products and essentially says that evaluation spans are stable under rein-
dexing.
Examples.
(1) Mon(E) ﬁbred over topos E has both internal sums and internal products.
(2) For every category B with pullbacks the fundamental ﬁbration PB = ∂1 :
B2 →B has internal sums which look as follows
A ===== A

The fundamental ﬁbration PB has internal products iﬀfor every u : I →J
in B the pullback functor u−1 : B/J →B/I has a right adjoint Q
u. For
B = Set this right adjoint gives dependent products (as known from Martin-
L¨of Type Theory).
Models of Martin–L¨of Type Theory
A category B with ﬁnite limits such that its fundamental ﬁbration PB has
internal products—usually called a locally cartesian closed category—allows
27

one to interpret Σ, Π and Identity Types of Martin–L¨of Type Theory. De-
pendent sum Σ and dependent product Π are interpreted as internal sums
and internal products.The ﬁbrewise diagonal δa

is used for interpreting identity types: the sequent i:I, x, y:A ⊢IdA(x, y) is
interpreted as δa when i:I ⊢A is interpreted as a.
One may interpret W-types in B iﬀfor b : B →A and a : A →I there is
a “least” w : W →I such that W ∼= `

level the requirement that W is the “least” solution of the recursive type

Fibrations of Finite Limit Categories
and Complete Fibrations
Let B be a category with pullbacks remaining ﬁxed for this section.
Lemma 8.1 For a ﬁbration P : X →B we have that
(1) a commuting square of cartesian arrows in X over a pullback in B is
always a pullback in X
(2) a commuting square

in X is a pullback in X whenever the ϕi are cartesian and α and β

Proof.

□
Deﬁnition 8.1 P : X →B is a ﬁbration of categories with pullbacks iﬀ
every ﬁbre P(I) has pullbacks and these are stable under reindexing along
arbitrary morphisms in the base.
♦
Lemma 8.2 If P : X →B is a ﬁbration of categories with pullbacks then
every pullback in some ﬁbre P(I) is also a pullback in X.
Proof.
Suppose
Z

is a pullback in P(I) and θ1, θ2 is a cone over α1, α2 in X, i.e. α1◦θ1 = α2◦θ2.
Obviously, θ1 and θ2 are above the same arrow u in B. For i = 1, 2 let
ϕi : u∗Xi →Xi be a cartesian arrow over u and γi : V →u∗Xi be a vertical
29

arrow with ϕi ◦γi = θi. As the image of (†) under u∗is a pullback in its
ﬁbre there is a vertical arrow γ with γi = u∗βi ◦γ for i = 1, 2. The situation
is illustrated in the following diagram

where ϕ and ψ are cartesian over u. From this diagram it is obvious that
θ := ψ ◦γ is a mediating arrow as desired. If θ′ were another such mediating
arrow then for θ′ = ψ ◦γ′ with γ′ vertical it holds that γ′ = γ as both are
mediating arrows to u∗(†) for the cone given by γ1 and γ2 and, therefore, it
follows that θ = θ′. Thus θ is the unique mediating arrow.
□
Now we can give a simple characterisation of ﬁbrations of categories with
pullbacks in terms of a preservation property.
Theorem 8.3 P : X →B is a ﬁbration of categories with pullbacks iﬀX
has and P preserves pullbacks.
Proof.
Suppose that P : X →B is a ﬁbration of categories with pullbacks.
For i = 1, 2 let fi : Yi →X be arrows in X and fi = ϕi ◦αi be some
30

vertical/cartesian factorisations. Consider the diagram

where the ϕ’s are cartesian and the α’s and β’s are vertical. Square (1) is
a pullback in X over a pullback in B by Lemma 8.1(1). Squares (2) and
(3) are pullbacks in X by Lemma 8.1(2). Square (4) is a pullback in X by
Lemma 8.2. Accordingly, the big square is a pullback in X over a pullback
in B. Thus, X has and P preserves pullbacks.
For the reverse direction assume that X has and P preserves pullbacks.
Then every ﬁbre of P has pullbacks and they are preserved under reindexing
for the following reason. For every pullback
Z

and, therefore, the image of pullback (†) under u∗is isomorphic to the
pullback of (†) along ϕ in X. As pullback functors preserve pullbacks it
follows that the reindexing of (†) along u is a pullback, too.

Deﬁnition 8.2 A ﬁbration P : X →B is a ﬁbration of categories with
terminal objects iﬀevery ﬁbre P(I) has a terminal object and these are
stable under reindexing.
♦
One easily sees that P is a ﬁbration of categories with terminal objects
iﬀfor every I ∈B there is an object 1I ∈P(I) such that for every u : J →I
in B and X ∈P(J) there is a unique arrow f : X →1I in X over u. Such a
1I is called an“I–indexed family of terminal objects”. It is easy to see that
this property is stable under reindexing.
Lemma 8.4 Let B have a terminal object (besides having pullbacks). Then
P : X →B is a ﬁbration of categories with terminal objects iﬀX has a
terminal object 1X with P(1X) terminal in B.
Proof.
Simple exercise.
□
Theorem 8.5 For a category B with ﬁnite limits a ﬁbration P : X →B
is a ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits, i.e. all ﬁbres of P have ﬁnite
limits preserved by reindexing along arbitrary arrows in the base, iﬀX has
ﬁnite limits and P preserves them.
Proof.
Immediate from Theorem 8.3 and Lemma 8.4.
□
From ordinary category theory one knows that C has small limits iﬀC
has ﬁnite limits and small products. Accordingly, one may deﬁne “com-
pleteness” of a ﬁbration over a base category B with ﬁnite limits by the
requirements that
(1) P is a ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits and
(2) P has internal products (satisfying BCC).
In [Bor] vol.2, Ch.8 it has been shown that for a ﬁbration P complete in
the sense above it holds for all C ∈cat(B) that the ﬁbred “diagonal”
functor ∆C : P →[PC→P] has a ﬁbred right adjoint Q
C sending diagrams
of shape C to their limiting cone (in the appropriate ﬁbred sense). Thus,
requirement (2) above is necessary and suﬃcient for internal completeness
under the assumption of requirement (1).

Elementary Fibrations and Representability
A ﬁbration P : X →B is called discrete iﬀall its ﬁbres are discrete cate-
gories, i.e. iﬀP reﬂects identity morphisms. However, already in ordinary
category theory discreteness of categories is not stable under equivalence
(though, of course, it is stable under isomorphism of categories). Notice
that a category C is equivalent to a discrete one iﬀit is a posetal groupoid,
i.e. Hom–sets contain at most one element and all morphisms are isomor-
phisms. Such categories will be called elementary.
This looks even nicer from a ﬁbrational point of view.
Theorem 9.1 Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration. Then we have
(1) P is a ﬁbration of groupoids iﬀP is conservative, i.e. P reﬂects iso-
morphism.
(2) P is a ﬁbration of posetal categories iﬀP is faithful.
(3) P is a ﬁbration of elementary categories iﬀP is faithful and reﬂects
isomorphisms.
Fibrations P : X →B are called elementary iﬀP is faithful and reﬂects
isomorphisms.
Proof.
Straightforward exercise.

It is well known that a presheaf A : Bop →Set is representable iﬀ
R
A : Elts(A) →B has a terminal object. This motivates the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 9.1 An elementary ﬁbration P : X →B is representable iﬀX
has a terminal object, i.e. there is an object R ∈P(I) such that for every
X ∈X there is a unique classifying morphism u : P(X) →I in B with
X ∼= u∗R, i.e. ﬁbration P is equivalent to PI = ∂0 : B/I →B for some
I ∈B, i.e. P is equivalent to some small discrete ﬁbration over B.

Notice that θ is necessarily cartesian and fully determined by P(θ). The
category HomI(X, Y ) is ﬁbred over B/I by sending (ϕ, f) to P(ϕ) and θ to
P(θ). The ﬁbration P is called locally small iﬀfor all X, Y ∈P(I) the ele-
mentary ﬁbration HomI(X, Y ) over B/I is representable, i.e. HomI(X, Y )
has a terminal object.
♦
The intuition behind this deﬁnition can be seen as follows. Let (ϕ0, f0)
be terminal in HomI(X, Y ).
Let d := P(ϕ0) : homI(X, Y ) →I.
Let
f0 = ψ0◦µX,Y with ψ0 cartesian and µX,Y vertical. Then for every u : J →I

Theorem 10.1 Let P : X →B be a locally small ﬁbration and B have
binary products.
Then for all objects X, Y in X there exist morphisms
ϕ0 : Z0 →X and f0 : Z0 →Y with ϕ0 cartesian such that for morphisms
ϕ : Z →X and f : Z →Y with ϕ cartesian there exists a unique θ : Z →Z0

Proof.
Let p : K →I, q : K →J be a product cone in B. Then the
desired span (ϕ0, f0) is obtained by putting
ϕ0 := ϕX ◦eϕ
f0 := ϕY ◦ef
where (eϕ, ef) is terminal in HomK(p∗X, q∗Y ) and ϕX : p∗X →X and
ϕY : p∗Y →Y are cartesian over p and q, respectively. We leave it as a
straightforward exercise to verify that (ϕ0, f0) satisﬁes the desired universal
property.
□
Locally small categories are closed under a lot of constructions as e.g.
ﬁnite products and functor categories. All these arguments go through for
locally small ﬁbrations (see e.g. [Bor] vol. 2, Ch. 8.6).
There arises the
question what it means that B ﬁbred over itself is locally small. The answer
given by the following Theorem is quite satisfactory.
Theorem 10.2 Let B be a category with pullbacks. Then the fundamental
ﬁbration PB = ∂0 : B2 →B is locally small if and only if for every u : J →I
in B the pullback functor u−1 : B/I →B/J has a right adjoint Πu or,
equivalently, iﬀevery slice of B is cartesian closed.
Such categories are
usually called locally cartesian closed.
Proof.
Lengthy but straightforward exercise.
□
Some further uses of local smallness are the following.
35

Observation 10.3 Let B be a category with an initial object 0 and P :
X →B be a locally small ﬁbration. Then for X, Y ∈P(0) there is precisely
one vertical morphism from X to Y .
Proof.
Let (ϕ0, f0) be terminal in Hom0(X, Y ). Then there is a 1–1–
correspondence between vertical arrows α : X →Y Y and sections θ of ϕ0

As there is precisely one map from 0 to P(Z0) there is precisely one section
θ of ϕ0. Accordingly, there is precisely one vertical arrow α : X →Y .
□
Observation 10.4 Let P : X →B be a locally small ﬁbration. Then every
cartesian arrow over an epimorphism in B is itself an epimorphism in X.
Proof.
Let ϕ : Y →X be cartesian with P(ϕ) epic in B. For ϕ being
epic in X it suﬃces to check that ϕ is epic w.r.t. vertical arrows. Suppose
that α1 ◦ϕ = α2 ◦ϕ for vertical α1, α2 : X →Z. Due to local smallness of
P there is a terminal object (ϕ0, f0) in HomP(X)(X, Z). Thus, for i=1, 2
there are unique cartesian arrows ψi with ϕ0 ◦ψi = idX and f0 ◦ψi = αi.
We have
ϕ0 ◦ψ1 ◦ϕ = ϕ = ϕ0 ◦ψ2 ◦ϕ
and
f0 ◦ψ1 ◦ϕ = α1 ◦ϕ = α2 ◦ϕ = f0 ◦ψ2 ◦ϕ
from which it follows that ψ1◦ϕ = ψ2◦ϕ. Thus, P(ψ1)◦P(ϕ) = P(ψ2)◦P(ϕ)
and, therefore, as P(ϕ) is epic by assumption it follows that P(ψ1) = P(ψ2).
As ϕ0 ◦ψ1 = ϕ0 ◦ψ2 and P(ψ1) = P(ψ2) it follows that ψ1 = ψ2 as ϕ0 is
cartesian. Thus, we ﬁnally get
α1 = f0 ◦ψ1 = f0 ◦ψ2 = α2
as desired.
□
Next we introduce the notion of generating family.
36

Deﬁnition 10.2 Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration. A generating family for P
is an object G ∈P(I) such that for every parallel pair of distinct vertical
arrows α1, α2 : X →Y there exist morphisms ϕ : Z →G and ψ : Z →X
with ϕ cartesian and α1 ◦ψ ̸= α2 ◦ψ.
For locally small ﬁbrations we have the following useful characterisation
of generating families provided the base has binary products.
Theorem 10.5 Let B have binary products and P : X →B be a locally
small ﬁbration. Then G ∈P(I) is a generating family for P iﬀfor every
X ∈X there are morphisms ϕX : ZX →G and ψX : ZX →X such that
ϕX is cartesian and ψX is collectively epic in the sense that vertical arrows
α1, α2 : X →Y are equal iﬀα1 ◦ψX = α2 ◦ψX.
Proof.
The implication from right to left is trivial.
For the reverse direction suppose that G ∈P(I) is a generating family.
Let X ∈P(J). As B is assumed to have binary products by Theorem 10.1
there exist ϕ0 : Z0 →G and ψ0 : Z0 →X with ϕ0 cartesian such that for
morphisms ϕ : Z →G and ψ : Z →X with ϕ cartesian there exists a unique
θ : Z →Z0 with
G
Z
θ
-
ϕ
-
Z0

-
Now assume that α1, α2 : X →Y are distinct vertical arrows.
As G is
a generating family for P there exist ϕ : Z →G and ψ : Z →X with ϕ
cartesian and α1◦ψ ̸= α2◦ψ. But there is a θ : Z →Z0 with ψ = ψ0◦θ. Then
we have α1◦ψ0 ̸= α2◦ψ0 (as otherwise α1◦ψ = α1◦ψ0◦θ = α2◦ψ0◦θ = α2◦ψ).
Thus, we have shown that ψ0 is collectively epic and we may take ϕ0 and
ψ0 as ϕX and ψX, respectively.
□
Intuitively, this means that “every object can be covered by a sum of
Gi’s” in case the ﬁbration has internal sums.
37

11
Well-Poweredness
For ordinary categories well-poweredness means that for every object the
collection of its subobjects can be indexed by a set. Employing again the
notion of representability (of elementary ﬁbrations) we can deﬁne a notion
of well–poweredness for (a wide class of) ﬁbrations.
Deﬁnition 11.1 Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration where vertical monos are
stable under reindexing. For X ∈P(I) let SubI(X) be the following category.
Its objects are pairs (ϕ, m) where ϕ : Y →X is cartesian and m : S →Y is
a vertical mono. A morphism from (ψ, n) to (ϕ, m) is a morphism θ such
that ϕ ◦θ = ψ and θ ◦n = m ◦eθ

for a (necessarily unique) cartesian arrow eθ. The category SubI(X) is ﬁbred
over B/I by sending objects (ϕ, m) to P(ϕ) and morphisms θ to P(θ).
The ﬁbration P is called well–powered iﬀfor every I ∈B and X ∈P(I)
the elementary ﬁbration SubI(X) over B/I is representable, i.e. SubI(X)
has a terminal object.
♦
If (ϕX, mX) is terminal in SubI(X) then, roughly speaking, for every
u : J →I and m ∈SubP(J)(u∗X) there is a unique map v : u →P(ϕX) in
B/I with v∗(mX) ∼= m. We write σX : SI(X) →I for P(ϕX).
Categories with ﬁnite limits whose fundamental ﬁbration is well-powered
have the following pleasant characterisation.
Theorem 11.1 A category B with ﬁnite limits is a topos if and only if its
fundamental ﬁbration PB = ∂1 : B2 →B is well–powered.
Thus, in this particular case well–poweredness entails local smallness as ev-
ery topos is locally cartesian closed.
38

Proof.
Lengthy, but straightforward exercise.
□
One may ﬁnd it amusing, reassuring or whatever that for categories B
with ﬁnite limits we have
PB is locally small iﬀB is locally cartesian closed
PB is wellpowered iﬀB is a topos
i.e. that important properties of B can be expressed by simple conceptual
properties of the corresponding fundamental ﬁbration.

Deﬁnability
If C is a category and (Ai)i∈I is a family of objects in C then for every
subcategory P of C one may want to form the subset
{i ∈I | Ai ∈P}
of I consisting of all those indices i ∈I such that object Ai belongs to the
subcategory P. Though intuitively “clear” it is somewhat disputable from
the point of view of formal axiomatic set theory (e.g. ZFC or GBN) whether
the set {i ∈I | Ai ∈P} actually exists. The reason is that the usual separa-
tion axiom guarantees the existence of (sub)sets of the form { i ∈I | P(i) }
only for predicates P(i) that can be expressed6 in the formal language of
set theory. Now this may appear as a purely “foundationalist” argument
to the working mathematician. However, we don’t take any deﬁnite posi-
tion w.r.t. this delicate foundational question but, instead, investigate the
mathematically clean concept of deﬁnability for ﬁbrations.
Deﬁnition 12.1 Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration. A class C ⊆Ob(X) is called
P–stable or simply stable iﬀfor P–cartesian arrows ϕ : Y →X it holds
that Y ∈C whenever X ∈C, i.e. iﬀthe class C is stable under reindexing
(w.r.t. P).
♦
Deﬁnition 12.2 Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration. A stable class C ⊆Ob(X)
is called deﬁnable iﬀfor every X ∈P(I) there is a subobject m0 : I0 ↣I
such that
(1) m∗
0X ∈C and
(2) u : J →I factors through m0 whenever u∗X ∈C.
♦
Notice that u∗X ∈C makes sense as stable classes C ⊆Ob(X) are
necessarily closed under (vertical) isomorphisms.
Remark. If C ⊆Ob(X) is stable then C is deﬁnable iﬀfor every X ∈P(I)
the elementary ﬁbration PC,X : CX →B/I is representable where CX is the
full subcategory of X/X on cartesian arrows and PC,X = P/X sends

-
in B/I. Representability of the elementary ﬁbration PC,X then means that
there is a cartesian arrow ϕ0 : X0 →X with X0 ∈C such that for every
cartesian arrow ψ : Z →X with Z ∈C there exists a unique arrow θ :
Z →X0 with ϕ0 ◦θ = ψ. This θ is necessarily cartesian and, therefore,
already determined by P(θ). From uniqueness of θ it follows immediately
that P(ϕ0) is monic.
One also could describe the situation as follows. Every X ∈P(I) gives
rise to a subpresheaf CX of YB(P(X)) consisting of the arrows u : J →I
with u∗X ∈C. Then C is deﬁnable iﬀfor every X ∈X the presheaf CX is
representable, i.e.
CX-
- YB(P(X))
YB(IX)

-
YB(mX)

where mX is monic as YB reﬂects monos.
♦
Next we give an example demonstrating that deﬁnability is not vacuously
true. Let C = FinSet and X = Fam(C) ﬁbred over Set. Let C ⊆Fam(C)
consist of those families (Ai)i∈I such that ∃n ∈N. ∀i ∈I. |Ai| ≤n. Obvi-
ously, the class C is stable but it is not deﬁnable as for the family
Kn = {i ∈N | i < n}
(n ∈N)
there is no greatest subset P ⊆N with ∃n ∈N. ∀i ∈P. i < n. Thus, the
requirement of deﬁnability is non–trivial already when the base is Set.
For a ﬁbration P : X →B one may consider the ﬁbration P (2) : X(2) →
B of (vertical) arrows in X. Thus, it is clear what it means that a class
M ⊆Ob(X(2)) is (P (2)-)stable. Recall that Ob(X(2)) is the class of P–
vertical arrows of X. Then M is stable iﬀfor all α : X →Y in M and
cartesian arrows ϕ : X′ →X and ψ : Y ′ →Y over the same arrow u in B
the unique vertical arrow α′ : X′ →Y ′ with ψ ◦α′ = α ◦ϕ is in M, too. In
other words u∗α ∈M whenever α ∈M.
41

Deﬁnition 12.3 Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration and M a stable class of
vertical arrows in X. Then M is called deﬁnable iﬀfor every α ∈P(I)
there is a subobject m0 : I0 ↣I such that m∗
0α ∈M and u : J →I factors
through m0 whenever u∗α ∈M.
♦
Next we discuss what is an appropriate notion of subﬁbration for a ﬁ-
bration P : X →B. Keeping in mind the analogy with Fam(C) over Set we
have to generalise the situation Fam(S) ⊆Fam(C) where S is a subcategory
of C which is replete in the sense that Mor(S) is stable under composition
with isomorphisms in C. In this case the objects of Fam(S) are stable under
reindexing and so are the vertical arrows of Fam(S). This motivates the
following
Deﬁnition 12.4 Let P : X →B. A subﬁbration of P is given by a subcat-
egory Z of X such that
(1) cartesian arrows of X are in Z whenever their codomain is in Z (i.e.
a cartesian arrow ϕ : Y →X is in Z whenever X ∈Z) and
(2) for every commuting square in X

the morphism f′ ∈Z whenever f ∈Z and ϕ and ψ are cartesian.
♦
Notice that a subﬁbration Z of P : X →B is determined uniquely by
V ∩Z where V is the class of vertical arrows of X w.r.t. P. Thus, Z gives
rise to replete subcategories
S(I) = Z ∩P(I)
(I ∈B)
which are stable under reindexing in the sense that for u : J →I in B
(Sobj)
u∗X ∈S(J) whenever X ∈S(I)
and
(Smor)
u∗α ∈S(J) whenever α ∈S(I).
On the other hand for every such such system S = (S(I) | I ∈B) of replete
subcategories of the ﬁbres of P which is stable under reindexing in the sense
42

that the above conditions (Sobj) and (Smor) are satisﬁed we can deﬁne a
subﬁbration Z of P : X →B as follows: f : Y →X in Z iﬀX ∈S(P(X))
and α ∈S(P(Y )) where the diagram
Y
Z

commutes and α is vertical and ϕ is cartesian. Obviously, this subcategory
Z satisﬁes condition (1) of Deﬁnition 12.4. For condition (2) consider the
diagram

where α′ and α are vertical, θ′ and θ are cartesian and f′ = θ′ ◦α′ and
f = θ ◦α from which it is clear that α′ ∈S(P(X′)) whenever α ∈S(P(X))
and, therefore, f′ ∈Z whenever f ∈Z.
Now we are ready to deﬁne the notion of deﬁnability for subﬁbrations.
Deﬁnition 12.5 A subﬁbration Z of a ﬁbration P : X →B is deﬁnable iﬀ
C = Ob(Z) and M = V ∩Z are deﬁnable classes of objects and morphisms,
respectively.
♦
Without proof we mention a couple of results illustrating the strength
of deﬁnability. Proofs can be found in [Bor] vol.2, Ch.8.
(1) Locally small ﬁbrations are closed under deﬁnable subﬁbrations.
(2) Let P : X →B be a locally small ﬁbration over B with ﬁnite limits.
Then the class of vertical isomorphisms of X is a deﬁnable subclass of
objects of X(2) w.r.t. P (2).
(3) If, moreover, X has ﬁnite limits and P preserves them then vertical
monos (w.r.t. their ﬁbres) form a deﬁnable subclass of objects of X(2)
w.r.t. P (2) and ﬁbrewise terminal objects form a deﬁnable subclass of
objects of X w.r.t. P.
43

(4) Under the assumptions of (3) for every ﬁnite category D the ﬁbrewise
limiting cones of ﬁbrewise D–diagrams from a deﬁnable class.
A pleasant consequence of (3) is that under the assumptions of (3) the
class of pairs of the form (α, α) for some vertical arrow α form a deﬁnable
subclass of the objects of X(G) w.r.t. P (G) where G is the category with two
objects 0 and 1 and two nontrivial arrows from 0 to 1. In other words under
the assumptions of (3) equality of morphisms is deﬁnable.
On the negative side we have to remark that for most ﬁbrations the
class {(X, X) | X ∈Ob(X)} is not deﬁnable as a subclass of X(2) (where
2 = 1+1 is the discrete category with 2 objects) simply because this class is
not even stable (under reindexing). Actually, stability fails already if some
of the ﬁbres contains diﬀerent isomorphic objects! This observation may
be interpreted as conﬁrming the old suspicion that equality of objects is
somewhat “ﬁshy” at least for non–split ﬁbrations. Notice, however, that
even for discrete split ﬁbrations equality need not be deﬁnable which can
be seen as follows. Consider a presheaf A ∈bG (where G is deﬁned as in the
previous paragraph) which may most naturally be considered as a directed
graph. Then for A considered as a discrete split ﬁbration equality of objects
is deﬁnable if and only if A is subterminal, i.e. both A(1) and A(0) contain
at most one element. Thus, for interesting graphs equality of objects is not
deﬁnable!
We conclude this section with the following positive result.
Theorem 12.1 Let B be a topos and P : X →B a ﬁbration.
If C is
a deﬁnable class of objects of X (w.r.t. P) then for every cartesian arrow
ϕ : Y →X over an epimorphism in B we have that X ∈C iﬀY ∈C (often
refered to as “descent property”).
Proof.
The implication from left to right follows from stability of C.
For the reverse direction suppose that ϕ : Y →X is cartesian over an
epi e in B. Then by deﬁnability of C we have e = m ◦f where m is a mono
in B with m∗X ∈C. But as e is epic and m is monic and we are in a topos
it follows that m is an isomorphism and, therefore, Y ∼= m∗X ∈C.
□
Notice that this Theorem can be generalised to regular categories B
where, however, one has to require that P(ϕ) is a regular epi (as a monomor-
phism m in a regular category is an isomorphism if m ◦f is a regular epi-
morphism for some morphism f in B).

Preservation Properties of Change of Base
We know already that for an arbitrary functor F : A →B we have that
F ∗P ∈Fib(A) whenever P ∈Fib(B). The (2-)functor F ∗: Fib(B) →
Fib(A) is known as change of base along F. In this section we will give
necessary and suﬃcient conditions on F guaranteeing that change of base
along F preserves “all good properties of ﬁbrations”.
Lemma 13.1 Let F : A →B be a functor. Then F ∗: Fib(B) →Fib(A)
preserves smallness of ﬁbrations if and only if F has a right adjoint U.
Proof.
Suppose that F has a right adjoint U. If C ∈cat(B) then F ∗PC is
isomorphic to PU(C) where U(C) is the image of C under U which preserves
all existing limits as it is a right adjoint.
Suppose that F ∗preserves smallness of ﬁbrations. Consider for I ∈B
the small ﬁbration PI = I = ∂0 : B/I →B. Then F ∗PI is isomorphic to ∂0 :
F↓I →B which is small iﬀthere exists U(I) ∈A such that F ∗PI ∼= PU(I),
i.e. B(F(−), I) ∼= A(−, U(I)). Thus, if F ∗preserves smallness of ﬁbrations
then for all I ∈B we have B(F(−), I) ∼= A(−, U(I)) for some U(I) ∈A,
i.e. F has a right adjoint U.
□
As a consequence of Lemma 13.1 we get that for u : I →J in B change
of base along Σu : B/I →B/J preserves smallness of ﬁbrations iﬀΣu has
a right adjoint u−1 : B/J →B/I, i.e. pullbacks in B along u do exist.
Analogously, change of base along ΣI : B/I →B preserves smallness of
ﬁbrations iﬀΣI has a right adjoint I∗, i.e. for all K ∈B the cartesian
product of I and K exists. One can show that change of base along u−1 and
I∗is right adjoint to change of base along Σu and ΣI, respectively. Thus,
again by Lemma 13.1 change of base along u−1 and I∗preserves smallness
of ﬁbrations iﬀu−1 and I∗have right adjoints Πu and ΠI, respectively.
From now on we make the reasonable assumption that all base categories
have pullbacks as otherwise their fundamental ﬁbrations would not exist.
Lemma 13.2 Let A and B be categories with pullbacks and F : A →B an
arbitrary functor. Then the following conditions are equivalent
(1) F preserves pullbacks
(2) F ∗: Fib(B) →Fib(A) preserves the property of having internal sums
(3) ∂1 : B↓F →A has internal sums.
45

Proof.
The implications (1) ⇒(2) and (2) ⇒(3) are easy. The implication
(3) ⇒(1) can be seen as follows. Suppose that the biﬁbration ∂1 : B↓F →A
satisﬁes BCC then for pullbacks

As back and front face of the cube are cartesian arrows and the right face is a
cocartesian arrow it follows from the postulated BCC for ∂1 : B↓F →A that
the left face is a cocartesian arrow, too. Thus, the map α is an isomorphism
from which it follows that
F(L) F(q)

is a pullback as required.
□
Thus, by the previous two lemmas a functor F : A →B between cate-
gories with pullbacks necessarily has to preserve pullbacks and have a right
adjoint U whenever F ∗preserves “all good properties of ﬁbrations” as being
small and having internal sums certainly are such “good properties”.
46

Actually, as pointed out by B´enabou in his 1980 Louvain-la-Neuve lec-
tures [Ben2] these requirements for F are also suﬃcient for F ∗preserving
the following good properties of ﬁbrations
• (co)completeness
• smallness
• local smallness
• deﬁnability
• well–poweredness.
We will not prove all these claims but instead discuss en detail preservation
of local smallness. Already in this case the proof is paradigmatic and the
other cases can be proved analogously.
Lemma 13.3 If F : A →B is a functor with right adjoint U and A and
B have pullbacks then change of base along F preserves local smallness of
ﬁbrations.
Proof.
Suppose P ∈Fib(B) is locally small. Let X, Y ∈P(FI) and
X
d∗X
ϕ0

-
Y

with d = P(ϕ0) = P(ψ0) : homFI(X, Y ) →FI be the terminal such span.
Then consider the pullback (where we write H for homFI(X, Y ))
eH

in A where ηI is the unit of F ⊣U at I. Then there is a natural bijection
between v : u →ed in A/I and bv : F(u) →d in B/FI by sending v to
bv = εH ◦F(h) ◦F(v) where εH is the counit of F ⊣U at H.
47

Let θ1 be a P-cartesian arrow over εH ◦F(h) : F eH →H to d∗X. Let
ϕ1 := ϕ0 ◦θ1 and ψ1 := ψ0 ◦θ1 which are both mapped by P to
d ◦εH ◦F(h) = εFI ◦F(Ud) ◦F(h) = εFI ◦FηI ◦F ed = F ed
We show now that the span
 (ed, ϕ1), ((ed, ψ1)

is a terminal object in the
category HomI(X, Y ) for F ∗P. For that purpose suppose that u : J →I in
A and ϕ : Z →X, ψ : Z →Y are arrows over u w.r.t. F ∗P with ϕ cartesian
w.r.t. F ∗P.
There exists a unique P-cartesian arrow θ2 with ϕ = ϕ0 ◦θ2 and ψ =
ψ0 ◦θ2. For bv := P(θ2) we have d ◦bv = F(u) as P(ϕ) = F(u) = P(ψ).
Then there exists a unique map v : u →ed with εH ◦F(h) ◦F(v) = bv. Now
let θ be the unique P-cartesian arrow over F(v) with θ2 = θ1 ◦θ which
exists as P(θ1) = εH ◦F(h) and P(θ2) = bv = εH ◦F(h) ◦F(v). Thus, we
have v : u →ed and a cartesian arrow θ with P(θ) = F(v), ϕ1 ◦θ = ϕ and
ψ1 ◦θ = ψ as desired.
For uniqueness of (v, θ) with this property suppose that v′ : u →ed and
θ′ is a cartesian arrow with P(θ′) = F(v′), ϕ1 ◦θ′ = ϕ and ψ1 ◦θ′ = ψ. From
the universal property of (ϕ0, ψ0) it follows that θ2 = θ1 ◦θ′. Thus, we have
bv = P(θ2) = P(θ1) ◦P(θ′) = εH ◦F(h) ◦P(θ′) = εH ◦F(h) ◦F(v′)
from which it follows that v = v′ as by assumption we also have ed ◦v′ = u.
From θ2 = θ1 ◦θ′ and P(θ′) = F(v′) = F(v) it follows that θ′ = θ because θ1
is cartesian and we have θ2 = θ1◦θ and P(θ′) = F(v) due to the construction
of θ.
□
Analogously one shows that under the same premisses as in Lemma 13.3
the functor F ∗preserves well–poweredness of ﬁbrations and that, for ﬁbra-
tions P : X →B and deﬁnable classes C ⊆X, the class
F ∗(C) := {(I, X) | X ∈P(FI) ∧X ∈C}
is deﬁnable w.r.t. F ∗P.
Warning. If F ⊣U : E →S is an unbounded geometric morphism then
PE = ∂1 : E2 →E has a generic family though F ∗PE ∼= gl(F) does not
have a generic family as otherwise by Theorem 17.3 (proved later on) the
geometric morphism F ⊣U were bounded! Thus, the property of having
a generating family is not preserved by change of base along functors that
preserve ﬁnite limits and have a right adjoint. In this respect the property
of having a small generating family is not as “good” as the other properties
48

of ﬁbrations mentioned before which are stable under change of base along
functors that preserve pullbacks and have a right adjoint.
♦
The moral of this section is that functors F between categories with pull-
backs preserve “all good” (actually “most good”) properties of ﬁbrations by
change of base along F if and only if F preserves pullbacks and has a right
adjoint. In particular, this holds for inverse image parts of geometric mor-
phisms, i.e. ﬁnite limit preserving functors having a right adjoint. But there
are many more examples which are also important. Let B be a category
with pullbacks and u : I →J a morphism in B then Σu : B/I →B/J
preserves pullbacks and has a right adjoint, namely the pullback functor
u−1 : B/J →B/I, but Σu preserves terminal objects if and only if u is an
isomorphism. Notice that for I ∈B the functor ΣI = ∂0 : B/I →B always
preserves pullbacks but has a right adjoint I∗if and only if for all K ∈B the
cartesian product of I and K exists. Thus, for a category B with pullbacks
the functors ΣI : B/I →B preserve “all good properties” of ﬁbrations by
change of base if and only if B has all binary products (but not necessarily
a terminal object!).
A typical such example is the full subcategory F of SetN on those N-
indexed families of sets which are empty for almost all indices.
Notice,
however, that every slice of F actually is a (Grothendieck) topos. This F
is a typical example for B´enabou’s notion of partial topos, i.e. a category
with binary products where every slice is a topos. The above example can
be generalised easily. Let E be some topos and F be a (downward closed)
subset of SubE(1E) then E/F , the full subcategory of E on those objects
A whose terminal projection factors through some subterminal in F, is a
partial topos whose subterminal objects form a full reﬂective subcategory of
E/F and have binary inﬁma.
Exercise. Let B be an arbitrary category. Let st(B) be the full subcategory
of B on subterminal objects, i.e. objects U such that for every I ∈B there
is at most one arrow I →U (possibly none!). We say that B has supports
iﬀst(B) is a (full) reﬂective subcategory of B.
Show that for a category B having pullbacks and supports it holds that
B has binary products iﬀst(B) has binary meets!

Adjoints to Change of Base
We ﬁrst show that for a functor F : A →B there is a left (2-)adjoint `
F
and a right (2-)adjoint Q
F to F ∗: Fib(B) →Fib(A), i.e. change of base
along F.
The right (2-)adjoint Q
F is easier to describe as its behaviour is pre-
scribed by the ﬁbred Yoneda Lemma as
(
Y
F
(P))(I) ≃Fib(B)(I, P) ≃Fib(A)(F ∗I, P)
for I ∈B. Accordingly, one veriﬁes easily that the right adjoint Q
F to F ∗
is given by
Y
F
(P)(I) = Fib(A)(F ∗I, P)
Y
F
(P)(u) = Fib(A)(F ∗u, P)
for objects I and morphisms u in B. Obviously, as expected if B is terminal
then Q P = Q
F P is the category of all cartesian sections of P.
Notice further that in case F has a right adjoint U then F ∗I ∼= UI and,
accordingly, we have Q
F ≃U∗.
We now turn to the description of `
F . We consider ﬁrst the simpler case
where B is terminal. Then one easily checks that for a ﬁbration P : X →A
the sum ` P = `
F P is given by X[Cart(P)−1], i.e. the category obtained
from X be freely inverting all cartesian arrows. This we can extend to the
case of arbitrary functors F as follows. For I ∈B consider the pullback P(I)
of P along ∂1 : I/F →A
X(I)
- X
I/F
P(I) ?
∂1
- A
P
?
and for u : J →I in B let Gu the mediating cartesian functor from P(I) to
P(J) over u/F (precomposition by u) in the diagram
X(I)
Gu- X(J)
- X
I/F
P(I) ?
u/F
- J/F
P(J) ?
∂1
- A
P
?
50

bearing in mind that ∂1 ◦u/F = ∂1. Now the reindexing functor `
F (u) :
`
F (I) →`
F (J) is the unique functor Hu with
X(I)[Cart(P(I))−1] Hu
- X(J)[Cart(P(I))−1]
X(I)
QI
6
Gu
- X(J)
QJ
6
which exists as QJ ◦Gu inverts the cartesian arrows of X(I).
Notice, however, that due to the non–local character7 of the construction
of `
F and Q
F in general the Beck–Chevalley Condition does not hold for
` and Q.
As for adjoint functors F ⊣U we have Q
F ≃U∗it follows that F ∗≃`
U.
Now we will consider change of base along distributors. Recall that a
distributor φ from A to B (notation φ : A ↛B) is a functor from Bop×A
to Set, or equivalently, a functor from A to bB = SetBop. Of course, up
to isomorphism distributors from A to B are in 1–1–correspondence with
cocontinuous functors from bA to bB (by left Kan extension along YA). Com-
position of distributors is deﬁned in terms of composition of the associated
cocontinuous functors.8 For a functor F : A →B one may deﬁne a distribu-
tor φF : A ↛B as φF (B, A) = B(B, FA) and a distributor φF : B ↛A in
the reverse direction as φF (A, B) = B(FA, B). Notice that φF corresponds
to YB ◦F and φF is right adjoint to φF .
For a distributor φ : A →bB change of base along φ is deﬁned as follows
(identifying presheaves over B with their corresponding discrete ﬁbrations)
φ∗(P)(I) = Fib(B)(φ(I), P)
φ∗(P)(u) = Fib(B)(φ(u), P)
for objects I and morphisms u in A. From this deﬁnition one easily sees
that for a functor F : A →B change of base along φF coincides with Q
F ,
i.e. we have
(φF )∗P ∼=
Y
F
P
7Here we mean that X(I)[Cart(P(I))] and Cart(F ∗I, P) do not depend only on P(I),
the ﬁbre of P over I. This phenomenon already turns up when considering reindexing of
presheaves which in general for does not preserve exponentials for example.
8As the correspondence between distributors and cocontinuous functors is only up to
isomorphism composition of distributors is deﬁned also only up to isomorphism. That is
the reason why distributors do form only a bicategory and not an ordinary category!
51

for all ﬁbrations P over A.
This observation allows us to reduce change of base along distributors
to change of base along functors and their right adjoints. The reason is that
every distributor φ : A ↛B can be factorised as a composition of the form
φGφF .9 Thus, we obtain
φ∗= (φGφF )∗≃(φF )∗(φG)∗≃F ∗Y
G
as (φF )∗≃F ∗and (φG)∗≃Q
G and change of base along distributors is
functorial in a contravariant way (i.e. (φ2φ1)∗≃φ∗
1φ∗
2). Thus φ∗has a left
adjoint `
φ = G∗`
F .
One might ask whether for all distributors φ : A ↛B there also exists
a right adjoint Q
φ to φ∗. Of course, if Q
φ exists then by the ﬁbred Yoneda
Lemma it must look as follows
(
Y
φ
P)(I) ≃Fib(B)(I,
Y
φ
P) ≃Fib(A)(φ∗I, P)
from which it is obvious that it restricts to an adjunction between bA and
bB as Fib(A)(φ∗I, P) is discrete whenever P is discrete. Thus, a necessary
condition for the existence of Q
φ is that the functor φ∗: bB →bA is cocontin-
uous. As φ∗: bB →bA is right adjoint to bφ : bA →bB, the left Kan extension
of φ : A →bB along YB, the distributor φ has a right adjoint if and only if φ∗
is cocontinuous. Thus, a necessary condition for the existence of Q
φ is the
existence of a right adjoint distributor to φ. This, however, is known to be
equivalent (see e.g. [Bor] vol.1) to the requirement that φ(A) is a retract of a
representable presheaf for all objects A in A. In case B is Cauchy complete,
i.e. all idempotents in B split, this means that up to isomorphism φ is of
the form φF for some functor F : A →B and then Q
F provides a right
adjoint to φ∗. As Fib(B) is equivalent to Fib(IdSp(B)), where IdSp(B) is
obtained from B by splitting all idempotents, one can show that φ∗has a
right adjoint Q
φ whenever φ has a right adjoint distributor. Thus, for a
distributor φ the change of base functor φ∗has a right adjoint Q
φ if and
only if φ has a right adjoint distributor, i.e. if and only if φ is essentially
a functor. An example of a distributor φ where φ∗does not have a right
adjoint can be obtained as follows. Let A be a terminal category and B
9Let F and G be the inclusions of A and B, respectively, into the display category
Dφ of φ which is obtained by adjoining to the disjoint union of A and B the elements
of φ(B, A) as morphisms from B to A and deﬁning u◦x◦v as φ(v, u)(x) for u : A →A′,
x∈φ(B, A) and v : B′ →B.
52

a small category whose splitting of idempotents does not have a terminal
object. Let φ : A →bB select a terminal presheaf from bB. Then φ∗amounts
to the global sections functor on bB which, however, does not have a right
adjoint as otherwise IdSp(B) would have a terminal object.

Finite Limit Preserving Functors as Fibrations
If F : B →C is a ﬁnite limit preserving functor between categories with
ﬁnite limits then the ﬁbration
gl(F) ≡F ∗PB = ∂1 : C↓F →B
satisﬁes the following conditions which later will turn out as suﬃcient for
reconstructing the functor F : B →C up to equivalence.
(1) Gl(F) ≡C↓F has ﬁnite limits and gl(F) preserves them.
(2) gl(F) has internal sums which are stable in the sense that cocartesian
arrows are stable under pullbacks along arbitrary morphisms.
(3) The internal sums of gl(F) are disjoint in the sense that for every
cocartesian arrow ϕ : X →Y the ﬁbrewise diagonal δϕ is cocartesian,
too.

where the top square is a pullback and the bottom square is the image of a
pullback under F. From this is is clear that ∂0, ∂1 : C↓F →B both preserve
pullbacks. Condition (3) follows from preservation of pullbacks by ∂0 and
the above characterisation of cocartesian arrows.
Now based on work by J.-L. Moens from his Th´ese [Moe] we will char-
acterise those ﬁbrations over a category B with ﬁnite limits which up to
equivalence are of the form gl(F) for some ﬁnite limit preserving functor
F from B to a category C with ﬁnite limits.
It will turn out that the
three conditions above are necessary and suﬃcient. In particular, we will
show that the functor F can be recovered from P = gl(F) in the follow-
ing way. First observe that ∂0 : C↓F →C is isomorphic to the functor
∆: C↓F →C↓F1 ∼= C given by

with ∆(f) is vertical over the terminal object in B. Now the functor F itself
can be obtained up to isomorphism as ∆= ∆◦1 (where 1 is the cartesian
functor choosing ﬁbrewise terminal objects).
Notice that this construction makes sense for arbitrary ﬁbrations P over
B with internal sums. Our goal now is to show that every ﬁbration P of
categories with ﬁnite limits over B with stable disjoint (internal) sums is
equivalent to gl(∆) where ∆is deﬁned as above and preserves ﬁnite limits.
But for this purpose we need a sequence of auxiliary lemmas.
55

ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits and stable disjoint internal sums.

□
Lemma 15.2 Let B be category with ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be a
ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits and stable internal sums, i.e. where
cocartesian arrows are stable under pullbacks along arbitrary maps in X.
Then the following conditions are equivalent
(1) The internal sums of P are disjoint.
(2) If ϕ and ϕ ◦ψ are cocartesian then ψ is cocartesian, too.
(3) If α is vertical and both ϕ and ϕ ◦α are cocartesian then α is an
isomorphism.

we have that ψ = θ ◦γ is cocartesian as γ is cocartesian by Lemma 15.1
and θ is cocartesian by stability of sums as it appears as pullback of the
cocartesian arrow ϕ ◦ψ.
(2) ⇒(1) : As πi and πi ◦δϕ = id are both cocartesian it follows from
assumption (2) that δϕ is cocartesian, too.
(2) ⇔(3) : Obviously, (3) is an instance of (2). For the reverse direction
assume (3) and suppose that both ϕ and ϕ ◦ψ are cocartesian. Consider
the diagram

where α and β are vertical and ϕ′ and ψ′ are cocartesian. Then α is an
isomorphism and, therefore, by assumption (3) β is an isomorphism, too, as
α ◦ϕ′ is cocartesian. Thus, ψ is cocartesian as ψ′ is cocartesian and β is an
isomorphism.
57

(3) ⇔(4) : Obviously, (4) entails (3) instantiating β by identity as isos are
stable under pullbacks. For the reverse direction consider the diagram

Thus, by assumption (3) it
follows from ϕ = θ ◦ι that ι is cocartesian over an iso and, therefore, ι is an
isomorphism. Thus, the outer square is a pullback square as it is isomorphic
to a pullback square via ι.
□
Remark. Alternatively, we could have proved Lemma 15.2 by showing (1)
⇒(4) ⇒(3) ⇒(2) ⇒(1) where the last three implications have already
been established. The implication (1) ⇒(4) was proved in [Moe] as follows.

cocartesian over an isomorphism and, therefore, an isomorphism itself.

Notice that condition (3) of Lemma 15.2 is equivalent to the requirement
that for every map u : I →J in B the coproduct functor `
u : XI →XJ
reﬂects isomorphisms.
As a consequence of Lemma 15.2 we get the following characterisation
of disjoint stable sums in terms of extensivity.
Lemma 15.3 Let B be category with ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be a ﬁ-
bration of categories with ﬁnite limits and internal sums. Then the following

where ϕI is cocartesian over !I : I →1 in B, 1I is terminal in its ﬁbre

a pullback.
Proof.
(1)⇔(2) : The implication from right to left in (2) is just stability
of internal sums. The implication from left to right in (2) is just condition (4)
of Lemma 15.2 which under assumption of stability of sums by Lemma 15.2
is equivalent to the disjointness of sums.
Obviously, condition (3) is an instance of condition (2). Thus it remains
to show that (3) entails (2).

where β, β0, γ and γ0 are vertical, ϕI is cocartesian over !I and 1I is terminal

upper square is a pullback then the outer rectangle is a pullback and thus
ψ0 is cocartesian by (3). If ψ0 is cocartesian then the outer rectangle is a
pullback by (3) and thus the upper square is a pullback, too.
Thus we have shown that

Now consider a commuting diagram

isomorphism (as isomorphisms are pullback stable) and thus ψ is cocartesian
as desired.

Notice that condition (3) of Lemma 15.3 is equivalent to the require-
ments that for all I ∈B the coproduct functor `
I : XI →X1 reﬂects
isomorphisms and β∗ϕI is cocartesian for all vertical maps β : U →`
I 1I.
An immediate consequence of Lemma 15.3 is the following
Corollary 15.4 Let B have ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be a ﬁbration of
categories with ﬁnite limits and stable disjoint internal sums. Then for every
61

u : I →J in B and X ∈P(I) the functor `
u /X : XI/X →XJ/ `
u X
is an equivalence. In particular, we get that XI ∼= XI/1I is equivalent to
XJ/ `
u 1I via `
u /1I and that XI ∼= XI/1I is equivalent to X1/∆(I) via
`
I /1I where ∆(I) = `
I 1I.
Corollary 15.5 Let B have ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be ﬁbration of
categories with ﬁnite limits and stable disjoint internal sums. Then for every
u : I →J in B the functor `
u : XI →XJ preserves pullbacks.
Proof.
Notice that `
u = ΣXJ/ ‘
u 1I ◦`
u /1I where we identify XI and
XI/1I via their canonical isomorphism. The functor `
u /1I preserves pull-
backs as it is an equivalence by Corollary 15.4. The functor ΣXJ/ ‘
u 1I = ∂0
is known to preserve pullbacks anyway.
Thus, the functor `
u preserves
pullbacks as it arises as the composite of pullback preserving functors.

where by stability of sums the ψi and θi are cocartesian as they arise as
pullbacks of ϕ1 or ϕ2, respectively. As the big outer square is a pullback we
may assume that φi = γi ◦ψi (by appropriate choice of the ψi).
Thus, θ = θ1 ◦ψ1 = θ2 ◦ψ2 is cocartesian as it arises as composition of
cocartesian arrows.

to show that it preserves also pullbacks. Let
U

be a pullback in X. Then by Lemma 15.6 the arrow θ is cocartesian in

where fi = αi ◦ϕi with αi vertical and ϕi cocartesian. From this we get
that the square

which is a pullback in the ﬁbre over P(Y ).
□
Now we are ready to prove Moens’ Theorem.
Theorem 15.8 Let B have ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be ﬁbration of
categories with ﬁnite limits and stable disjoint internal sums. Then P is
equivalent to gl(∆) where ∆is the ﬁnite limit preserving functor ∆◦1.
More explicitely, the ﬁbred equivalence E : P →gl(∆) is given by sending
f : X →Y in X over u : I →J to
∆(X) ∆(f)- ∆(Y )
E(f)
∆(1I)
∆(α)
?
∆(u)
- ∆(1J)
∆(β)

where α and β are terminal projections in their ﬁbres.
Proof.
As ∆(u) = ∆(1u) we have that E(f) is the image under ∆of the
square

which is a pullback if f is cartesian.
As by Lemma 15.7 the functor ∆
preserves pullbacks it follows that E is cartesian. Thus, the ﬁbred functor
E is a ﬁbred equivalence as by Corollary 15.4 all ﬁbres of E are (ordinary)
equivalences.
□
Thus, for categories B with ﬁnite limits we have established a 1–1–
corresponcence up to equivalence between ﬁnite limit preserving functors
with source B and ﬁbrations over B of categories with ﬁnite limits and
stable disjoint internal sums.
The World’s Simplest Proof of Moens’ Theorem
The 1–1–correspondence up to equivalence between ﬁbrations of the form
∂1 : C↓F →B for some ﬁnite limit preserving F : B →C where C has
ﬁnite limits and ﬁbrations over B of categories with ﬁnite limits and Lawvere
extensive small sums can be shown most easily as follows. Suppose P : X →
B is a ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits and Lawvere extensive small
sums. Then pullback along the cocartesian arrow ϕI : 1I →`
I 1I induces
and equivalence between XI and X1/ `
I 1I. This extends to an equivalence
between P and gl(∆: B →X1) since
XJ ϕ∗
J
≃X1/∆(J)
XI
u∗6
≃
ϕ∗

X1/∆(I)
∆(u)∗

commutes up to isomorphism for all u : J →I in B. Thus, the ﬁbration
gl(∆) has also small sums from which it follows by Lemma 13.2 that ∆
preserves pullbacks. As obviously ∆preserves terminal objects the functor
∆preserves ﬁnite limits.
This may explain why Lawvere’s notion of extensive sums is so impor-
tant.
Notice, however, that Lawvere’s original deﬁnition only applied to
ordinary categories C with small coproducts in the ordinary sense. That
our notion of Lawvere extensivity is slightly more general can be seen from
the discussion at the end of section 17 where we give an example (due to
Peter Johnstone) of a ﬁbration over Set of categories with ﬁnite limits and
Lawvere extensive small sums which, however, is not of the form Fam(C)
for some ordinary category C.
Finally we discuss how the fact that ﬁnite limit preserving functors are
closed under composition is reﬂected on the level of their ﬁbrations asso-
65

ciated via glueing.
Suppose that F : B →C and G : C →D are ﬁ-
nite limit preserving functors between categories with ﬁnite limits. Then
gl(G◦F) ∼= gl(F) ◦F ∗Fam(gl(F)) as indicated in

because ∂0 ◦∂∗
1F = F ◦∂0. From this consideration it is obvious that a
ﬁbration Q : Y →Gl(F) is isomorphic to one of the form F ∗Fam(gl(G)) iﬀ
Q is a ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits and stable disjoint internal
sums such that ∆: Y →Y1 is isomorphic to one of the form G ◦∂0, i.e. iﬀ
∆inverts cocartesian arrows of Gl(F). This latter condition is equivalent
to the requirement that 1ϕ is cocartesian w.r.t. Q whenever ϕ is cocartesian
w.r.t. gl(F).12 This fails e.g. for Q ≡gl(IdGl(F)) if not all cocartesian arrows
of Gl(F) are isomorphisms, i.e. B is not equivalent to the trivial category 1.
12As ∆(ϕ) is an isomorphism iﬀ1ϕ is cocartesian. This can be seen from the diagram
1X
ϕX

- ∆(X)
1Y
1ϕ
? cocart
ϕY
- ∆(Y )
∆(ϕ)
?
where ϕX and ϕY are cocartesian over the terminal projections of X and Y , respectively,
and ∆(ϕ) is vertical. If 1ϕ is cocartesian then ∆(ϕ) is an isomorphism as it is vertical and
cocartesian. On the other hand if ∆(ϕ) is an isomorphism then ∆(ϕ) ◦ϕX is cocartesian,
too, and thus by Lemma 15.2(2) it follows that 1ϕ is cocartesian.

Geometric Morphisms as Fibrations
Geometric morphism are adjunctions F ⊣U : C →B where F preserves ﬁ-
nite limits. Though introduced originally for toposes the notion of geometric
morphism makes sense already if B and C have ﬁnite limits.
First we will characterise for functors F between categories with ﬁnite
limits the property that F has a right adjoint in terms of a purely ﬁbrational
property of its associated ﬁbration gl(F) = F ∗PC, namely that of having
small global sections.
First we observe that the requirement P ⊣1 ⊣G is equivalent to P
having small global sections since 1 ⊣G says that for every X ∈P(I) there
is an εX : 1GX →X such that for every σ : 1J →X over u : J →I there is
a unique v : J →GX with
1I
1J

1u

σ
-
i.e. that HomI(1I, X) is representable. If P is a ﬁbration of cartesian closed
categories (or even a ﬁbred topos) then P has small global sections iﬀP is
locally small.
Theorem 16.1 Let F : B →C be a functor between categories with ﬁnite
limits. Then F has a right adjoint U iﬀthe ﬁbration gl(F) has small global
sections, i.e. gl(F) ⊣1 ⊣G.
Proof.
Suppose that F has a right adjoint U. We show that 1 ⊣G by
exhibiting its counit eεa for an arbitrary object a : A →FI in Gl(F) = C↓F.
For this purpose consider the pullback
C
q- UA

where ηI is the unit of F ⊣U at I ∈B. Then for the transpose bq = εA ◦Fq :
FC →A of q we have
FC
ˆq- A



Fp

We show that (p, bq) : 1C →a is the desired counit eεa of 1 ⊣G at a. Suppose
that (u, s) : 1J →a in Gl(F), i.e. u : J →I and s : FJ →A with a ◦s = Fu
as shown in the diagram

But bq ◦Fv = s iﬀq ◦v = Us ◦ηJ due to F ⊣U. Thus v satisﬁes the above
requirements iﬀp◦v = u and q ◦v = Us◦ηJ, i.e. iﬀv is the mediating arrow
in the diagram

68

from which there follows uniqueness and existence of v with the desired
properties. Thus eεa actually is the counit for 1 ⊣G at a.
For the reverse direction assume that gl(F) ⊣1 ⊣G.
Thus, for all
X over 1 we have B(−, GX) ∼= C↓F(1(−), X) ∼= C/F1(F/1(−), X), i.e.
F/1 : B ∼= B/1 →C/F1 has a right adjoint (given by the restriction of G to
C/F1). Since ΣF1 ⊣(F1)∗: C →C/F1 and F = ΣF1◦F/1 : B ∼= B/1 →C
the functor F has a right adjoint.
A slightly more abstract proof of the backwards direction goes by ob-
serving that the inclusion I : C↓F1 ,→C↓F has a left adjoint R sending
a : A →FI to F!I ◦a : A →F1 and a morphism (u, f) from b : B →FJ to
a : A →FI to f : R(b) →R(a) since (u, f) from a : A →FI to c : C →F1
is in 1-1-correspondence with f : R(a) →c (because necessarily u = !I).
Obviously, we have that F/1 = R ◦1 and thus F/1 has right adjoint G ◦I.
Since F = ΣF1 ◦F/1 and ΣF1 ⊣(F1)∗it follows that F has right adjoint
G ◦I ◦(F1)∗.
□
Notice that the above proof goes through if C has just pullbacks and
ΣF1 has a right adjoint (F1)∗, i.e. F1 × X exists for all objects X in C.
Thus, we have the following lemma which has a structure analogous to
the one of Lemma 13.2.
Lemma 16.2 Suppose B has ﬁnite limits and C has pullbacks and all prod-
ucts of the form F1 × X. Then for a functor F : B →C the following
conditions are equivalent
(1) F has a right adjoint
(2) F ∗: Fib(C) →Fib(B) preserves the property of having small global
sections
(3) F ∗PC = ∂1 : C↓F →B has small global sections.
Proof.
The proof of (1) ⇒(2) is a special case of the proof of Lemma 13.3.
Since PC has small global sections (3) follows from (2). Finally, claim (1)
follows from (3) by Theorem 16.1 and the subsequent remark on its strength-
ening.
□
From Lemma 13.2 and Theorem 16.1 it follows that for a functor F :
B →C between categories with ﬁnite limits the ﬁbration gl(F) = F ∗PC has
internal sums and small global sections iﬀF preserves pullbacks and has a
right adjoint.13
13This was already observed by J. B´enabou in [Ben1].
69

Thus, for categories B with ﬁnite limits we get a 1–1–correspondence (up
to equivalence) between geometric morphisms to B (i.e. adjunctions F ⊣U :
C →B where C has ﬁnite limits and F preserves them) and ﬁbrations
over B of categories with ﬁnite limits, stable disjoint sums and small global
sections. Such ﬁbrations are called geometric.
Since for ﬁbred toposes (sums and) internal sums are automatically sta-
ble and disjoint geometric morphisms from toposes to a topos S are (up
to equivalence) in 1–1–correspondence with toposes ﬁbred over S that are
cocomplete and locally small.
In the rest of this section we show that in a ﬁbred sense every geometric
morphism is of the form ∆⊣Γ.
First we observe that there is a ﬁbred version of the functor ∆= ∆◦1
considered in the previous section
Deﬁnition 16.1 Let B be a category with ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be
a ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits and stable disjoint internal sums.
Then there is a ﬁbred functor ∆P : PB →P sending the morphism
I1
v- I2
J1

in PB to the arrow ∆P (w, v) in X over w making the following diagram
commute
1I1
1v

∆P (u1)
ϕu1 ?
∆P (w, v)
- ∆P (u2)
ϕu2
?
where ϕui is cocartesian over ui for i = 1, 2.
Notice that ∆P actually is cartesian as if the ﬁrst square is a pullback
then ∆P (w, v) is cartesian by BCC for internal sums as 1w is cartesian and
the ϕi are cocartesian.
Now P having small global sections turns out as equivalent to ∆P having
a ﬁbred right adjoint ΓP .
70

Theorem 16.3 Let B be a category with ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be
a ﬁbration of categories with ﬁnite limits and stable disjoint internal sums.
Then P has small global sections iﬀ∆P has a ﬁbred right adjoint ΓP .
Proof.
For the implication from left to right assume that P ⊣1 ⊣G. For
X ∈X let eεX be the unique vertical arrow making the diagram
1GX
ϕ
cocart
- ∆P (P(εX))
X

εX
-
commute where εX is the counit of 1 ⊣G at X.
Then for u : I →J
and f : ∆P (u) →X there is a unique morphism (w, v) : u →P(εX) with
eεX ◦∆P (w, v) = f as can be seen from the following diagram
1I

using the universal property of εX. It follows that necessarily w = P(f).
Thus, for f : ∆P (u) →X its lower transpose ˇf is given by (P(f), v) : u →
P(εX) where v : I →G(X) is the unique arrow with εX ◦1v = f ◦ϕu.
The induced right adjoint ΓP sends a morphism h : Y →X in X to the
morphism
G(Y )
G(h)- G(X)
ΓP (h)

P(h)

71

in B2 because G(h) is the unique morphism v with εX ◦1v = h ◦εY =
h ◦eεY ◦ϕP(εY ) and, therefore, (P(h), G(h)) is the lower transpose of h ◦eεY
as required. The unit eηu : u →ΓP (∆P (u)) = P(ε∆P (u)) of ∆P ⊣ΓP at
u : I →J is given by eηu making the following diagram commute

eηu

1G∆P (u)
1eηu

ε∆P (u)
- ∆P (u)
ϕu

-
because (idP(∆P (u)), eηu) is the lower transpose of id∆P (u). As PB ◦ΓP = P
and the components of eη and eε are vertical it follows14 that ΓP is cartesian
and thus ∆P ⊣ΓP is a ﬁbred adjunction.
For the implication from right to left suppose that ∆P has a ﬁbred right
adjoint ΓP . We write eε for the counit of this adjunction. For X ∈X we
deﬁne εX as eεX ◦ϕ

where ϕ is cocartesian over P(ΓP (X)) : G(X) →P(X).
To verify the
desired universal property of εX assume that σ : 1I →X is a morphism
over u : I →P(X). Let σ = f ◦ϕu with f vertical and ϕu cocartesian.
Then the existence of a unique arrow v : I →G(X) with εX ◦1v = σ follows
from considering the diagram

using the universal property of eεX. Thus, P has small global sections.
□
The following explicitation of ∆gl(F) ⊣Γgl(F) for ﬁnite limit preserving
F will be helpful later on.
Theorem 16.4 For the geometric ﬁbration P = gl(F) induced by a geo-
metric morphism F ⊣U : C →B the ﬁbred adjunction ∆P ⊣ΓP can be
described more concretely as follows.
The left adjoint ∆P acts by application of F to arrows and squares in B.
The ﬁbre of ΓP over I ∈B is given by η∗

Fibrational Characterisation of Boundedness
Recall (e.g. from [Joh]) that a geometric morphism F ⊣U : E →S between
elementary toposes is called bounded iﬀthere is an object S ∈E such that for
every X ∈E there is an object I ∈S such that X appears as a subquotient
of S×FI
C- - S×FI
X
?
?
i.e. X appears as quotient of some subobject C of S×FI. Such an S is called
a bound for the geometric morphism F ⊣U. The importance of bounded
geometric morphisms lies in the fact that they correspond to Grothendieck
toposes over S (as shown e.g. in [Joh]).
In this section we will show that a geometric morphism F ⊣U : E →S
is bounded iﬀfor its corresponding geometric ﬁbration gl(F) there exists a
generating family.
Lemma 17.1 Let B have ﬁnite limits and P : X →B be a ﬁbration of
categories with ﬁnite limits with stable disjoint internal sums. Then a co-
cartesian arrow ϕ : X →Y is monic w.r.t. to vertical arrows, i.e. vertical
arrows α1, α2 : Z →X are equal whenever ϕ ◦α1 = ϕ ◦α2.
Proof.
Let α1, α2 : Z →X be vertical arrows with ϕ ◦α1 = ϕ ◦α2. Then
there is a unique morphism α with πi ◦α = αi for i = 1, 2. Consider the
pullback
·
β- X
Z
ι
?
α
- ·
δϕ
?
where δϕ is the ﬁbrewise diagonal. Notice that both α and δϕ are above the
same mono in B. Thus, the map ι lies above an isomorphism in the base
(as P preserves pullbacks) and, moreover, it is cocartesian as it appears as
pullback of the cocartesian arrow δϕ. Thus, the arrow ι is an isomorphism
and we have α = δϕ ◦β ◦ι−1 from which it follows that αi = β ◦ι−1 for
i=1, 2. Thus, we have α1 = α2 as desired.
□
74

For formulating the next lemma we have to recall the notion of collec-
tively epic morphism as introduced in Theorem 10.5. If P : X →B is a
ﬁbration then a morphism f : X →Y in X is called collectively epic iﬀ
for all vertical arrows α1, α2 : Y →Z from α1 ◦f = α2 ◦f it follows that
α1 = α2. Notice that for a collectively epic morphism f : X →Y for maps
g1, g2 : Y →Z with P(g1) = P(g2) from g1f = g2f it follows that g1 = g2
because if gi = ϕαi with ϕ cartesian and αi vertical then α1f = α2f and
thus α1 = α2 from which it follows that g1 = ϕα1 = ϕα2 = g2.
If P is Fam(C) for an ordinary category C then an arrow f : X →Y
in the total category of Fam(C) over u : I →J is collectively epic iﬀfor all
j ∈J the family (fi : Xi →Yj)i∈u−1(j) is collectively epic in the usual sense
of ordinary category theory. Thus, it would be more precise to say “family
of collectively epic families” but as this formulation is too lengthy we prefer
the somewhat inaccurate formulation “collectively epic”.
Notice that for a biﬁbration P : X →B a morphism f : X →Y in X
is collectively epic iﬀfor a cocartesian/vertical factorisation f = α ◦ϕ the
vertical arrow α is epic in its ﬁbre.
Lemma 17.2 Let B be a category with ﬁnite limits and P : X →B a geo-
metric ﬁbration which is locally small and well–powered. Moreover, suppose
that collectively epic arrows in X are stable under pullbacks.
Then for P there exists a generating family iﬀfor P there exists a sep-
arator, i.e. an object S ∈P(1B) such that for every object X ∈P(1B) there
exist morphisms ϕ : Y →S, m : Z →Y and ψ : Z →X with ϕ cartesian,
m a vertical mono and ψ collectively epic.
Proof.
Let P : X →B be a ﬁbration satisfying the conditions above.
Suppose that G ∈P(I) is a generating family for P. Let ψ0 : G →S
be a cocartesian arrow over !I : I →1. Let ψ0 = ϕ0 ◦η with ϕ0 cartesian
and η vertical. Notice that η is monic as by Lemma 17.1 the cocartesian ψ0
is monic w.r.t. vertical arrows. We show that S is a separator for P. Let
X ∈P(1B). As G is a generating family for P and B has binary products
by Theorem 10.5 there are morphisms θ : Z →G and ψ : Z →X with θ
cartesian and ψ collectively epic. Then consider the diagram
X ψ

where θ′ is cartesian over P(θ) and m is vertical. Thus, the middle square is
a pullback and m is a vertical mono. Furthermore, ϕ := ϕ0 ◦θ′ is cartesian.
Thus, we have constructed morphisms ϕ : Y →S, m : Z →Y and ψ : Z →
X with ϕ cartesian, m a vertical mono and ψ collectively epic as required.
Suppose that S ∈P(1B) is a separator for P. By well–poweredness of P
there exists a vertical mono mS : G ↣σ∗
SS classifying families of subobjects
of S. We show that G is a generating family for P.
Suppose X ∈P(I).
Let θ : X →X0 be a cocartesian arrow over
!I : I →1 . As S is a bound there exist morphisms ϕ0 : Y0 →S, m : Z0 →Y0
and ψ0 : Z0 →X0 with ϕ0 cartesian, m a vertical mono and ψ0 collectively
epic. Consider the pullback
Z

where ϕ1 and ϕ′ are cartesian over P(θ′) and m′ and η are vertical. The
inner square is a pullback. Thus m′ is monic as it appears as pullback of
the monic arrow m. The arrow η is a vertical mono as by Lemma 17.1 θ′
is monic w.r.t. vertical arrows. Thus n = m′ ◦η is a vertical mono, too.
Moreover, ϕ0 ◦ϕ1 : Y →S is cartesian. Thus, the mono n : Z →Y is a
family of subobjects of S and, therefore, we have

for some cartesian arrows ϕ and eϕ. Thus, we have morphisms ϕ : Z →G
and ψ : Z →X with ϕ cartesian and ψ collectively epic.
Thus, by Theorem 10.5 it follows that G is a generating family for P. □
Suppose F : B →C is a ﬁnite limit preserving functor between categories
with ﬁnite limits. One easily checks that an arrow

in Gl(F) = C↓F is collectively epic (w.r.t. the ﬁbration gl(F) = ∂1 : C↓F →

the other hand if f is collectively epic then e is epic in C which can be seen
as follows: suppose g1, g2 : A →C with g1e = g2e then the maps

Thus, if in C epimorphisms are stable under pullbacks along arbitrary
morphisms then in Gl(F) collectively epic maps are stable under pullbacks
along arbitrary morphisms.
Theorem 17.3 A geometric morphism F ⊣U : E →S between toposes
is bounded iﬀfor the corresponding geometric ﬁbration gl(F) there exists a
generating family.
Proof.
Let F ⊣U : E →S be a geometric morphism between toposes.
Then the corresponding geometric ﬁbration gl(F) is locally small and well-
powered.
77

As for gl(F) reindexing preserves the topos structure and in toposes epis
are stable under pullbacks vertical epis are stable under pullbacks. Thus,
collectively epic arrows are stable under pullbacks as both vertical epis and
cocartesian arrows are stable under pullbacks. Alternatively, this follows
from the observations immediately preceding the current theorem and pull-
back stability of epimorphisms in toposes.
Thus, since the assumptions of Lemma 17.2 are satisﬁed for gl(F) there
exists a generating family for gl(F) iﬀthere exists a separator for gl(F)
which, obviously, is equivalent to the geometric morphism F ⊣U being
bounded.
□

Suppose a : A →F(I) is a map in E. As S is a bound there exists J ∈S and e : C ↠A

(where F(π) and F(π′) form a product cone because F preserves ﬁnite limits and π and
π′ form a product cone) and notice that π ◦m appears as pullback of gS along F(ρ) where

is a generating family for gl(F). This condition, however, also implies that
S is a bound for F ⊣U since if gS = π ◦mS is a generating family for
gl(F) then for every A ∈E there is a map u : I →UP(S) in S and an epi

from which it follows that A appears as quotient of a subobject of some
FI×S.
Thus S is a bound for a geometric morphism F ⊣U : E →S between
toposes iﬀgS = π ◦mS : GS →FUP(S) is a generating family for gl(F).
In case S is Set this amounts to the usual requirement that the family of
subobjects of S is generating for the topos E.
Suppose that F ⊣U : E →S is a geometric morphism that is not
bounded. Then for PE = gl(IdE) : E2 →E there exists a generating family
whereas for F ∗PE = gl(F) there does not exist a generating family due to
Theorem 17.3 because F ⊣U is not bounded. This example shows that
existence of generating families is not preserved by change of base along
inverse image parts of geometric morphism.
Recall from [Joh] the following example of an unbounded geometric mor-
phism. Let E be the full subcategory of bZ = SetZop on those objects A such
that ∀a∈A.A(n)(a) = a for some n ∈N, i.e. there is a ﬁnite bound on the
size of all orbits of the action A. One easily sees that E is a topos and
∆⊣Γ : E →Set is a geometric morphism which, however, is not bounded
(as otherwise there were an a priori bound on the size of all orbits of objects
of bZ). Notice, however, that E admits a (countable) generating family in the
sense of ordinary category theory, namely the family (Zn)n∈N (of all ﬁnite
orbits up to isomorphism), whose sum, however, does not exist in E.
Johnstone’s example also demonstrates that toposes E over Set need
not be cocomplete in the sense of ordinary category theory, i.e. do not have
79

all small sums, although the associated ﬁbration gl(∆) certainly has inter-
nal sums.16 Apparently there is a diﬀerence between internal and external
families of objects in E where a family (Xi)i∈I in E is internal if there is
a map f : Y →∆(I) in E with Xi ∼= in∗
i f for all i ∈I. Of course, every
internal family gives rise to an external one whereas e.g. (Zn)n∈N is an ex-
ternal family in the topos E which is not internal. It is an easy exercise to
show that a family (Xi)i∈I in a topos E over Set is internal if and only if
the family (Xi)i∈I is bounded in the sense that there exists an object X ∈E
such that all Xi appear as subobjects of X.17
Notice that due to Giraud’s Theorem (see [Joh]) toposes bounded over
Set are precisely the Grothendieck toposes and, therefore, do have all small
sums. Actually, one may see this more directly as follows. Suppose S is
a bound for the geometric morphism ∆⊣Γ : E →Set. Then E has all
small copowers `
i∈I X ∼= ∆(I) × X.
Suppose (Xi)i∈I is a family in E.
Then for every i ∈I there is a set Ji such that Xi is a subquotient of
∆(Ji) × S. Thus, all Xi are subobjects of P(∆(J)×S) via some mono mi
where J = S
i∈I Ji (since ∆(Ji) × S is a subobject of ∆(J) × S). Let χi
classify the subobject mi for i ∈I and χ : `
i∈I P(∆(J)×S) →Ωbe the
source tupling of the χi. Then the sum `
i∈I Xi appears as the subobject of
the copower `
i∈I P(∆(J)×S) ∼= ∆(I)×P(∆(J)×S) classiﬁed by χ in E.
16Thus, the ﬁbrations gl(∆) = ∆∗PE and Fam(E) over S are not equivalent because
gl(∆) has internal sums whereas Fam(E) doesn’t!
Consider also the following somewhat weaker counterexample. Let A be a partial com-
binatory algebra, RT[A] the realizability topos over A (see e.g. [vOo]) and Γ ⊣∇: Set →
RT[A] the geometric morphism where Γ = RT[A](1, −) is the global elements functor.
Then gl(∇) = ∇∗PRT[A] is a ﬁbration with stable and disjoint internal sums over Set
although for nontrivial A the realizability topos RT[A] does not have even only all
countable sums in the sense of ordinary category theory (already ‘
N 1 does not exist in
RT[A]). Moreover, for nontrivial A internal sums w.r.t. the ﬁbration gl(∇) in general do
not coincide with the corresponding external sums (if they exists): consider e.g. ‘
2 1 w.r.t.
gl(∇), i.e. ∇(2), which is not isomorphic to 1+1 in RT(A). Thus ∇(1+1) ̸∼= ∇(1)+∇(1)
from which it follows that ∇does not have a right adjoint. Accordingly, the ﬁbration
gl(∇) over Set does not have small global elements.
17In the example gl(∇) = ∂1 : RT[A]↓∇→Set every X →∇(I) in RT[A] may be
understood as a family of I-indexed subobjects of X but the ensuing cartesian functor
(over Set) from gl(∇) to Fam(RT[A]) is far from being an equivalence.
Firstly, it does not reﬂect isos (in each ﬁbre) since id ∇(2) and η2 : 2 →∇Γ(2) ∼= ∇(2)
are not isomorphic in the slice over ∇(2) but both give rise to (1)i∈2 in Fam(RT[A])(2).
Thus, diﬀerent internal families (over 2 already) may give rise to the same external family.
Secondly, there are external N-indexed families (Xn)n∈N in RT[A] which do not arise
from a morphism X →∇(N) because any such family would have to be isomorphic
to a family (X′
n)n∈N for which symmetry and transitivity are realized by e1, e2 ∈A
independently from n ∈N.
It is left as an exercise to the reader to give a concrete
counterexample.
80

But there exist toposes over Set which, in the sense of ordinary category
theory, are cocomplete but do not admit a small generating family. A typical
such example (due to Peter Freyd) is the topos G whose objects are pairs
(A, f) where A is a set and f is a family of bijections of A indexed over
the class of all sets such that the class supp(A, f) = {s | fs ̸= idA} is a set
and whose morphisms from (A, f) to (B, g) are the maps h : A →B with
h(fs(a)) = gs(h(a)) for all a ∈A and all sets s. The construction of this
category can be rephrased as follows. Let G be the free group generated by
the class of all sets. Then G is isomorphic to the full subcategory of bG on
those objects A where {s | A(s) ̸= idA(∗)} is a set. The proof that G is a topos
is analogous to the proof that for every group G the presheaf category SetGop
is a boolean topos. Moreover G has all small limits and colimits (which are
constructed pointwise). Suppose (Gi, g(i))i∈I were a small generating family
for G. Let J = S
i∈I supp(Gi, g(i)) and s0 be a set with s0 ̸∈J. Now let
(A, f) be the object of G where A = {0, 1} and fs ̸= idA only for s = s0.
There cannot exist a morphism h : (Gi, g(i)) →(A, f) unless Gi is empty as
otherwise there is a z ∈Gi for which we have h(z) = h(g(i)
s0 )(z)) = fs0(h(z))
Obviously (A, f) has two diﬀerent endomorphisms which, however, cannot
be distinguished by morphisms of the form h : (Gi, g(i)) →(A, f). Thus,
there cannot exist a small generating family for the cocomplete boolean
topos G.
One easily shows that for a cocomplete topos E the functor ∆: E →Set
preserves ﬁnite limits. Thus, for a topos E over Set it holds that
E bounded over Set =⇒E cocomplete =⇒E over Set
and the above counterexamples show that none of these implications can be
reversed in general. Freyd’s counterexample shows that the ﬁrst implication
cannot be reversed in general. Johnstone’s counterexample shows that the
second implication cannot be reversed in general.
If E is a topos bounded over Set then for E there exists a generating
family in the sense of ordinary category theory. However, as Johnstone’s
counterexample shows the reverse implication does not hold in general for
toposes over Set. Freyd’s counterexample shows there are toposes E over
Set such that there does not even exist a generating family for E in the sense
of ordinary category theory and that such toposes may even be cocomplete.
Notice that toposes E cocomplete in the sense of ordinary category
theory are bounded over Set iﬀthere exists a generating family for E in
the sense of ordinary category theory.
The reason is that if (Gi)i∈I is
a generating family for E in the sense of ordinary category theory then
81

`
i∈I!Gi : `
i∈I Gi →`
i∈I 1E = ∆(I) is a generating family for the ﬁbration
∆∗PE = gl(∆). Thus, a topos E is bounded over Set iﬀE is cocomplete
and there exists a generating family for E in the sense of ordinary category
theory. However, this characterisation does not generalise to arbitrary base
toposes S.
Formally, the ﬁbrational characterisation of bounded toposes
over S as cocomplete locally small ﬁbred toposes over S with a generating
family looks similar but as we have seen above cocomplete in the sense of ﬁ-
bred categories is weaker than cocomplete in the sense of ordinary category
theory and generating family in the sense of ﬁbred categories is stronger
than in the sense of ordinary category theory.
Finally we observe that a topos over Set which in the sense of ordinary
category theory is neither cocomplete nor has a small generating family can
be obtained by combining the ideas of Freyd’s and Johnstone’s counterex-
amples, namely the full subcategory of Freyd’s counterexample G on those
objects (A, f) for which there exists an n ∈N such that (fs)n = idA for all
sets s.

Properties of Geometric Morphisms
In this section we will characterise some of the most common properties of
geometric morphisms F ⊣U in terms of simple ﬁbrational properties of the
corresponding geometric ﬁbration gl(F). In the following we simply write
∆⊣Γ for the ﬁbred adjunction ∆P ⊣ΓP and the according unit and counit
are denoted by eη and eε, respectively.
Theorem 18.1 Let F ⊣U : C →B be a geometric morphism and P be
the induced geometric ﬁbration gl(F).
Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(1) The geometric morphism F ⊣U is injective, i.e. U is full and faithful.
(2) The counit eε of ∆⊣Γ is a natural isomorphism.
(3) For the counit ε of 1 ⊣G : Gl(F) →B it holds that εX is cocartesian
for all objects X ∈Gl(F).
Proof.
Conditions (2) and (3) are equivalent as by Theorem 16.3 we have
εX = eεX ◦ϕ with ϕ : 1GX →∆ΓX cocartesian over P(εX).
Condition (2) says that all ΓI are full and faithful. In particular, we
have that U ∼= Γ1 is full and faithful. Thus (2) implies (1).
It remains to show that (1) entails (2).
Condition (1) says that the
counit ε of F ⊣U is a natural isomorphism. But then for every a : A →FI
in Gl(F) we have
FK Fq- FUA
εA
∼=
- A
FI
Fp
?
FηI

from which it follows by Theorem 16.4 that the map eεa = εA ◦Fq is an
isomorphism as it appears as pullback of the identity idFI = εFI ◦F(ηI). □
Theorem 18.2 Let F ⊣U : C →B be a geometric morphism and P
be its induced geometric ﬁbration gl(F). Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(1) The geometric morphism F ⊣U is surjective, i.e. F reﬂects isomor-
phisms.
(2) A morphisms u in B is an isomorphism whenever 1u is cocartesian.
83

Proof.
Obviously, the functor F reﬂects isomorphisms iﬀall ∆I reﬂect
isomorphisms.
For a morphism u : w →v in B/I (i.e. w = v ◦u) we have
1K
ϕw- ∆I(w)
1J
1u

ϕv
- ∆I(v)
∆I(u)
?
where ϕw and ϕv are cocartesian over w : K →I and v : J →I, respec-
tively, and ∆(u) is vertical over I.
As internal sums in gl(F) are stable
and disjoint it follows from Lemma 15.2 that ∆I(u) is an isomorphism iﬀ
1u is cocartesian. Thus, the functor ∆I reﬂects isomorphisms iﬀu is an
isomorphism whenver 1u is cocartesian.
Thus, the functor F reﬂects isomorphisms iﬀit holds for all maps u in
B that u is an isomorphism whenever 1u is cocartesian.
□
Theorem 18.3 Let F ⊣U : C →B be a geometric morphism and P
be its induced geometric ﬁbration gl(F). Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(1) The geometric morphism F ⊣U is connected, i.e. F is full and faith-
ful.
(2) The right adjoint G of 1 : B →Gl(F) sends cocartesian arrows to
isomorphisms.
(3) The ﬁbred functor Γ is cocartesian, i.e. preserves cocartesian arrows.
Proof.
Obviously, the functor F is full and faithful iﬀall ∆I are full and
faithful, i.e. all eηu are isomorphisms. Let u : I →J be a morphism in B.
Then we have

ϕu

where ϕu : 1I →∆(u) is cocartesian over u and, therefore, we have eηu =
G(ϕu). Thus, the functor F is full and faithful iﬀG(ϕ) is an isomorphism
84

for cocartesian ϕ whose source is terminal in its ﬁbre. But then G sends all
cocartesian arrows to isomorphisms which can be seen as follows. Suppose
ϕ : X →Y is cocartesian over u : I →J. Let ϕu : 1I →∆(u) be cocartesian
over u. Then by Lemma 15.2 the commuting square
X

ϕu

with α and β vertical over I and J, respectively, is a pullback. As G is a
right adjoint it preserves pullbacks and, therefore,
G(X) G(ϕ)- G(Y )

G(ϕu)

G(β)

is a pullback, too, from which it follows that G(ϕ) is an isomorphism as
G(ϕu) is an isomorphism by assumption. Thus, we have shown the equiva-
lence of conditions (1) and (2).
The equivalence of conditions (2) and (3) can be seen as follows. From
(inspection of) the proof of Theorem 16.1 we know that for ϕ : X →Y its
image under Γ is given by
G(X)
G(ϕ)- G(Y )
Γ(ϕ)
P(X)
P(εX)
?
P(ϕ)
- P(Y )
P(εY )
?
Thus Γ(ϕ) is cocartesian iﬀG(ϕ) is an isomorphism. Accordingly, the func-
tor G sends all cocartesian arrows to isomorphisms iﬀΓ preserves cocarte-
sianness of arrows.
□
Notice that condition (2) of Theorem 18.3 is equivalent to the require-
ment that G inverts just cocartesian arrows over terminal projections which
85

can be seen as follows. Suppose ϕ : X →Y is cocartesian over u : I →J.
Let ψ : Y →`
J Y be a cocartesian arrows over !J : J →1. Then ψ ◦ϕ is
cocartesian over !I : I →1. As G(ψ ◦ϕ) = G(ψ) ◦G(ϕ) and by assumption
G(ψ ◦ϕ) and G(ψ) are isomorphisms it follows immediately that G(ϕ) is
an isomorphism, too. Moreover, one easily sees that G inverts cocartesian
arrows over terminal projections if and only if G inverts cocartesian arrows
above terminal projections whose source is terminal in its ﬁbre. Of course,
this condition is necessary. For the reverse direction suppose that ϕ : X →Y
is cocartesian over !I : I →1. Then as P is a geometric ﬁbration we have
X
ϕ
cocart
- Y
1I
α
? cocart
ϕI
- ∆(I)
β

where ϕI is cocartesian over I →1 and α and β are the unique vertical
arrows making the diagram commute. As G is a right adjoint it preserves
pullbacks and, therefore, we have
G(X) G(ϕ)- G(Y )
G(1I)
G(α)
?
G(ϕI)
- G(∆(I))
G(β)
?
from which it follows that G(ϕ) is an isomorphism as G(ϕI) is an isomor-
phism by assumption. Thus, a geometric ﬁbration P is connected if and only
if G inverts all cocartesian arrows over terminal projections which start from
a ﬁbrewise terminal object, i.e. if for all σ : 1J →∆(I) there exists a unique
u : J →I with σ = ϕI ◦1u as gets immediate from the following diagram

with ϕ : 1I →∆(I) cocartesian over I →1. Analogously, faithfulness of F is
equivalent to the requirement that u = v whenever ϕI ◦1u = ϕI ◦1v provid-
ing an alternative characterisation of surjectivity for geometric morphisms
between toposes (as F ⊣U is surjective iﬀF is faithful).
Obviously, condition (1) of Theorem 18.3 is equivalent to the requirement
that η : IdB →UF is a natural isomorphism. For the particular case of a
geometric morphism ∆⊣Γ : E →Set where E is a topos one easily sees
that ηI : I →Γ∆I (sending i ∈I to the injection ini : 1 →`
i∈I 1) is a
bijection for all sets I iﬀthe terminal object of E is indecomposable in the
sense that for all subterminals U and V with U+V ∼= 1E either U or V is
isomorphic to 0E.
Theorem 18.4 Let F ⊣U : C →B be a geometric morphism and P be
the induced geometric ﬁbration gl((F). Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(1) The geometric morphism F ⊣U is local, i.e. F is full and faithful and
U has a right adjoint.
(2) The ﬁbred functor Γ has a ﬁbred right adjoint ∇.
Proof.
First we show that (2) implies (1). If Γ has a ﬁbred right adjoint
∇then Γ preserves cocartesian arrows as it is a ﬁbred left adjoint. Thus, by
the previous Theorem 18.3 it follows that F is full and faithful. As Γ1 ⊣∇1
and U ∼= Γ1 it follows that U has a right adjoint.
Now we show that (1) implies (2).
If F is full and faithful then the
unit η : IdB →UF is an isomorphism.
Therefore, the ﬁbred functor Γ
acts on objects and morphisms simply by applying the functor U and then
postcomposing with the inverse of η, i.e. Γ(a) = η−1
I
◦U(a) for a : A →FI
in C↓F.
Then Γ has a ﬁbred right adjoint ∇with ∇(v) = ζ∗
JR(v) for
v : K →J in C↓C where ζJ : FJ →RJ is the transpose (w.r.t. U ⊣R) of

□
87

Theorem 18.5 Let F ⊣U : C →B be a geometric morphism and P be
the induced geometric ﬁbration gl(F).
Then the following conditions are
equivalent.
(1) The geometric morphism F ⊣U is locally connected, i.e. F has a left
adjoint L such that
A

implies
FI

where ˆa and ˆb are the upper transposes of a and b, respectively.
(2) The ﬁbred functor ∆has a ﬁbred left adjoint Π.
Proof.
If L ⊣F then ∆has an ordinary left adjoint ΠL sending
A
f- B

and satisfying PB ◦ΠL = gl(F). Obviously, this functor ΠL is cartesian
iﬀL satisﬁes the requirement of condition (1). Thus, condition (1) entails
condition (2).
On the other hand if ∆has a ﬁbred left adjoint Π then F ∼= ∆1 has
an ordinary left adjoint L ∼= Π1 and as Π ∼= ΠL (because both functors are
ﬁbred left adjoints to ∆) it follows that ΠL is also cartesian and, therefore,
the functor L satisﬁes the requirement of condition (1). Thus, condition (2)
entails condition (1).
□
Moreover, it follows from the ﬁbred version of the Special Adjoint Func-
tor Theorem18 that a geometric morphism F ⊣U : E →S between toposes
is locally connected if and only if F preserves the locally cartesian closed
structure as ∆: PS →gl(F) preserves internal limits iﬀF preserves ﬁnite
limits and dependent products.
18which applies as PS has a small generating family and, therefore, also a small cogen-
erating family (as shown by R. Par´e and D. Schumacher)
88

Recall that a geometric morphism F ⊣U : E →S between toposes
is called atomic iﬀF : S →E is logical. Thus, by the previous remark
atomic geometric morphisms between toposes are locally connected. Atomic
geometric morphisms can be characterised as those locally connected geo-
metric morphisms F ⊣U : E →S where all monomorphisms m in E are
S–deﬁnable, i.e. satisfy
X
ηX- FLX
Y
m
?
?
ηY
- FLY
FLm
?
where η is the unit of L ⊣F. This can be seen as follows. Recall that
for a locally connected geometric morphism F ⊣U : E →S the monomor-
phism F(⊤S) classiﬁes S–deﬁnable monomorphisms.
Now if F is logical
then F(⊤S) is a subobject classiﬁer in E and, therefore, all monomorphisms
in E are S–deﬁnable. On the other hand, if all monomorphisms in E are S–
deﬁnable then F(⊤S) is a subobject classiﬁer (as it classiﬁes all S–deﬁnable
monomorphisms) and thus F is logical.
