 
 
 
 
 

First, let me explain what Etsy is. If you already know what it is, just 
zone out for a second. 
Etsy is an online marketplace (kind of like Ebay without the auctions) 
for people who are into crafts (i.e. women). It’s just pure listing and 
selling. If someone wants it, they buy it. It’s like Ebay if Ebay was all 
about handmade products and vintage products and supplies 
(which Etsy is).  
The thing is, you wouldn’t believe it, but there are hundreds of 
thousands of people who have set up shop on Etsy. And there are 
hundreds more doing it every day.  
What does this mean for you? It means there’s a huge market of 
people out there who are trying to make money online and don’t 
know anything about it.  
It’s as if the Warrior Forum was filled with newbies and you were the 
only expert. Do you see what I’m saying? Ka-ching! 
When I say a huge market, I’m talking about a huuuge market. 
Below is a screenshot of the current amount of shops on Etsy that 
have at least one item in them. That means ACTIVE shops.  
Why? Because if an item doesn’t sell in a shop after 90 days, it gets 
deleted. The only way to get it back up is to go back to Etsy, pay 20 
cents and re-list it. 
So this is just the amount of shops that have active sellers who have 
been on in at least the last few months and are currently trying to sell 
items online: 
 

  
 
If you don’t see the enormous potential here, then you haven’t been 
doing internet marketing very long. 
And let me tell you something else: This isn’t based on theory. This is 
based on my real-life experience selling services to these people 
and cashing in big time.  
Who likes proof? 

 
 
Did you catch what I said earlier about “selling services”? Yep, 
you’re going to sell services to people who are willing to pay good 
money for your expertise. 
Does that mean you’re going to actually perform the services? Um 
no, that’s too much work.  
Seriously though, if you can pay someone else money to perform a 
service, and get paid twice or three times or more that amount of 
money from someone who wants that service, isn’t it smarter to just 
pay someone else to do it and pocket the profit? 
I’m going to let you in on the kinds of services you can sell for a big 
chunk of change. I’m also going to show you where to hire someone 
to do the work for you and how to pick who to hire. 
 

If you’re not already signed up, head over to Fiverr.com and sign up.  
If you don’t know what Fiverr is, where have you been? It’s a website 
that lets you buy and sell services for $5.  
A lot of Warriors spend a lot of time trying to make money off Fiverr 
by doing services for $5 (which turns out to be $4 after fees). That 
cracks me up. You’ve got hundreds of people willing to work for you 
for the cheapest rates imaginable, some of them with genuine skills 
and talent, and your idea is to compete with them for a measly $4?  
Wake up! Find a way to make some money off of this insanely cheap 
labor. Don’t BECOME the cheap labor.  
 

When you’re done signing up, have a look around at all the services 
that are offered here. 
Services like: 
Backlink Generation 
Banner Design 
Blog Design 
Video Creation 
Background Removal 
Blog Comments 
Social Network Page Design 
Blog Search Engine Submission 
Blog Social Network Submission 
Article Writing 
Product Description Writing 
Press Release Writing 
Press Release Submission 
Flyer Posting 
Logo Design 
Radio Show Advertisements 
Podcast Advertisements 
Banner Advertisements 
Blog Writing 

And there are a LOT more. These are just some of the services you 
can sell to Etsy users who know NOTHING about internet marketing.  
Of course, you’re going to charge them 3, 4, or 5 times more for the 
service than you’re paying for it.  
For example, I have sold many backlink packages for $50. I buy 
services from 2 different backlink providers on Fiverr and pocket the 
profit. $10 spent. $40 profit. 
But the real money is in selling big packages. 
They look something like this: 
· 
· 
· 
· 
· 
· 
· 

· 
· 
This package is my very best seller, and it costs me $50 to produce. 
What do I sell it for? $125. That’s a $75 profit, for veeery little work. It 
sells like crazy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Head on over to ProjectWonderful.com and sign up. 
Project Wonderful is a site that allows you to place ads on websites 
by paying for a full day of showing your ad on the site. That means 
you don’t pay for clicks – just a day’s worth of ads. 
 
 

Here’s the thing: Project Wonderful turned out to be bucketloads 
cheaper for me than Google Adwords.  
Here’s why: Lots of Etsy bloggers use Project Wonderful. That means 
a lot of craft blogs and blogs read by Etsy shop owners and buyers 
are available to have your ads displayed on. 
You can pay as little as 1 cent to be seen by hundreds or thousands 
of Etsy lovers. That can’t be beat. 
And yes, lots of people do click on those ads.  
 
Once you sign up and click on “Find Publishers” you’ll be taken to a 
page like this: 
 
 
This is just a somewhat list of publishers on Project Wonderful sorted 
by traffic. Just scroll all the way down to the bottom of this page to 
get to here: 

 
 
Check off the “Handmade” category. That’s the ONLY one you 
want to concern yourself with. Almost every blog in this category is 
Etsy related. Super targeted CHEAP as hell traffic, here we come! 
 

Note the amount of traffic these blogs receive compared to the cost 
per day to advertise there. Not bad, huh? 
And notice that there are 514 blogs or websites in this category. Most 
of these blogs and websites have several spaces for ads available, 
so there are actually thousands of ad spaces here. 
Later on you’re going to make ads for Project Wonderful to get some 
traffic to your site/blog, but first you have to set up a site/blog, so 
let’s get to that first. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Now it’s time to set up shop. You have 3 options: 
1. Create a website. 
2. Create a blog. 
3. Create an Etsy shop. 
 
If you’re looking for the option with the most flexibility, then build your 
own site. 
If you’re looking for something with more flexibility, but less work, 
build a blog. 
If you’re looking for something cheap and can’t-screw-it-up easy, 
then create an Etsy shop. 
 
I recommend that you set up a site or a blog PLUS an Etsy shop. 
Why? Because a site gives you control, and that should be your main 
selling platform, but an Etsy shop gives you a feedback system that 
people can trust. 
When Etsy users see that you have plenty of positive feedback and 
no negative feedback, that builds a whole lot of trust. Would you 
send $100 - $200 to some guy with a blog who you didn’t know 
anything about? Probably not.  
Feedback changes that. It reassures people. It gets them to trust 
you.  

So go over to Etsy.com and sign up. 
 
 
By the way, it definitely is allowed to sell services on Etsy. There are 
hundreds of people who do it, and they are even occasionally 
featured on the home page. 
Here’s the thing, though: 
You must list these items as “Supplies,” not as “Handmade.”  
 
Once you’re signed up, you’ll still need to sign up for a seller 
account. So click on the “Sell” link in the top left corner of the 
navigation bar. 
 

Once you’re signed up as a seller, click on “Your Account” in the top 
right corner of the navigation bar and your account page will come 
up with a sidebar that looks like this: 
 
 
You can access everything you need for your shop from here, 
including your profile, your banner and avatar, item listings, 
feedback, etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Now you need to put up some product listings. Remember my list of 
just some of the services you can sell from Step 1? 
I’m going to give you an example of how you can write descriptions 
for these services in your Etsy and website listings. 
 
Fiverr Service: Blog Creation 
Your Title: 1 Cool Blog for Your Etsy Items 
Description:  
Want to drive more traffic to your Etsy shop? 
Want a way to talk with your fans and customers and give them a 
chance to talk with each other? 
I’ll create 1 totally awesome blog for you to display your Etsy items in 
and get tons more visitors to your shop! 
Price: $25 
 
See how easy it is? 
Want to make it even easier? Just hire a Fiverr user to write your 
product descriptions. $5 for 5+ descriptions is easy to come by. 
The best part is, with almost all these services, you have the 
opportunity to up-sell.  

When someone buys your blog creation service, you can also sell 
them blog content writing, blog comment backlinks, banner ad 
design, theme customization, etc. 
So go back to Fiverr, pick out some services, and then list them on 
Etsy with your own spin. 
 
Here are some tips for picking Fiverr users: 
1. Only choose users who have plenty of feedback. You don’t 
want to be stuck scrambling to find someone else to complete 
the job because the Fiverr user you picked didn’t deliver. 
 
2. Only choose users who have fast delivery times. You don’t want 
to be stuck trying to explain to your customers why it’s taken 
you 14 days to complete a simple task. 
 
3. Find 2 or 3 back-up providers for each service you want to sell. 
That way, if one is out of town and the other has gone AWOL, 
you’re still safe. 
 
4. Try to find Fiverr users who are in the same time zone as you. If 
there’s a problem, you don’t want to have to wait 2-3 days for 
it to be fixed because they’re sleeping when you need 
something changed and you’re sleeping when they email you 
for more details. 
 
 

Once you have your Etsy shop up (and blog/website if you choose), 
you’re going to need to drive traffic to it. Yes, listing items on Etsy 
alone will drive traffic, but we want to pump more into it than that. 
Traffic Source #1 
Remember Project Wonderful?  
Go back there to set up your ads, because that’s my number 1 
source of traffic for this method. 
Click on the link that reads, “templates to help you out.”  

I advise you to download all the templates and make an ad for 
each one. You don’t want to miss a good, cheap ad spot because 
you don’t have the right kind of ad. 
This is the perfect project to give to a Fiverr user, but if you want to 
do it yourself, it does NOT have to be fancy. 
 
TIP: I’ve found that just putting plain text in a brightly colored box 
works wonders. It grabs attention because it doesn’t look like the 
graphic-heavy ads around it. Doesn’t get simpler than that.  
 
Once you’ve created your ads, you’re going to upload them by 
going to https://www.projectwonderful.com/createad.php  
Now you can get some clicks on them! 
Hover over “Advertising” and click on “Find new advertising”. 

Scroll down and click on “Sizes and Categories” and check off 
“Handmade” only. 

Now click on “Current Bid” so you can sort by minimum bid. Guess 
what? Many of these listings have NO MINIMUM BID and the current 
bid is at $0.00! 
Yes, that means you can place ads on these sites for 0.01 a day! 
That’s practically free. 
There’s not much to this. Just try to get the cheapest ads with the 
most traffic. They’re all targeted, so you don’t have to worry about 
that. 
Keep an eye on your ads, and if some aren’t performing great, you 
can just cancel your bids on them.  
 
 
 
 

Traffic Source #2 
This isn’t the only way to drive traffic, though. Here’s another 
AWESOME and cheap way to drive traffic to your Etsy shop that’s 
extremely targeted. 
Go to CraftCult.com. They offer free tools for Etsy users and it’s an 
extremely popular site.  
It gets over 110,000 page views a day and attracts over 77,500 
visitors a month. And those are ALL Etsy users. 
They have a great advertising program that’s super cheap and 
drives tons of traffic. 
 
$15 a week for an ad that targets THAT many Etsy shop owners? Yes, 
please. 
I’ve spent hundreds on these ads alone, and YES, it is worth it.
 

Traffic Source #3 
This traffic source gets me more paying customers faster than either 
of the two above. But it’s shorter lived. If you’re looking for a BIG 
surge of traffic and don’t mind that it dies out quickly, this is just that. 
The great thing about Etsy shop owners is that they are really into 
community. They like to talk to each other and they all seem to have 
hundreds of friends who are also Etsy shop owners. 
This is great news for us marketers, because if we can impress one of 
them, they’ll get the word out to hundreds of others. 
This is what I do: I find Etsy shop owner’s blogs. It’s really easy. Just go 
to the Etsy forums (etsy.com/forums) and search for the word “Blog”. 
They’re always on the forums promoting their blogs. 
I click on the blog link, find their email address, and send them a 
simple email like this: 
 
Hi _________, 
I’m a big follower of your blog and am also an Etsy shop owner. 
I sell marketing services to Etsy users (I can’t sew a button for the life 
of me, but marketing comes naturally J) and I was wondering if 
you’d be interested in trying out one of my services (on me, of 
course!) and writing about it in your blog. 
I’m just trying to make all these great Etsy shop owners aware that 
they can get a lot more sales with someone like me working for 
them.  
Here’s my Etsy shop link if you’re interested: _______.etsy.com 
Just pick out any service you’d like! 

All the best, 
_______________ 
 
Warning: Make sure the people you’re emailing this offer to have a 
decent amount of traffic to their blog. $5 to get your link in front of 
1,000+ eyeballs is worth it. $5 to get it in front of 50 eyeballs is 
probably not. 
This simple email works 3 times out of 4 and I get glowing reviews and 
a link back to my shop, plus plenty of sales. And all for $5.
