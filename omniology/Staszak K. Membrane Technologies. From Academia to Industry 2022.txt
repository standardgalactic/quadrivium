Preface
The groundbreaking discovery that transformed membrane technology from a labo-
ratory to an industrial process was the development of defect-free, high-flux, aniso-
tropic membranes invented by Sidney Loeb and Srinivasa Sourirajan and disclosed in
the United Stat Patent 3133132A filled by the University of California on November 29th
1960 and granted on May 12th 1964. With 60 years of fast advancement, today, mem-
brane-based technologies are essential parts of numerous industrial processes which
have brought significant benefits to improve human life.
This book aims to review the state of the art and to provide the readers with a
comprehensive and in-depth understanding of recent developments and innovation
analysis of the selected membrane applications. Chapter 1 emphasizes recent ad-
vancements in the design of membrane systems used either for separation or creation
of mixtures from the perspective of industry 4.0 and data management. Chapter 2
focuses on the description of membrane processes, characterization of protein prod-
ucts, biological issues related to bacteriophages contamination, and modeling of the
processes. Membrane applications in the food industry and in the production of bev-
erages are detailed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, respectively. Chapter 5 discusses
various applications of polymeric membranes in three significant areas of biomedicine,
including tissue engineering, drug delivery systems, and diagnostics. Liquid mem-
branes for separation of metal ions from wastewaters are the subject of Chapter 6.
Essential oils are compounds extracted from plants which are usually utilized to
produce perfumes, soaps, lotions, and flavorings as well as other well-being or
aromatherapy products with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Membrane
processes which have been proposed as a method for purification of essential oils
extract is discussed in Chapter 7. We believe that the large number of references, to all
significant topics mentioned, should make this book useful not only to undergraduates
but also to graduate students and academic and industrial researchers.
Having an idea is one thing, turning it into a book is tough, however much
satisfying!
We wish to acknowledge all contributing authors for making this book project a
success.

1 Design of membrane systems
Abstract: Membrane separation systems have been used in process industry since
decades; however, their designs are based mainly on experienced-based and use of
trial-and-error approach, especially in case of membrane selection. This chapter re-
views recent advancements in the design of membrane systems used either for sepa-
ration or creation of mixtures from the perspective of industry 4.0 and data
management. Additionally, computer-aided design tools have been reviewed with aim
of possible use in the design of membrane separation systems.
Keywords: digital twins; membrane database; membrane selection; process design;
process modelling; process simulation.
1.1 Introduction and definitions
The design of any matter, whether it is a table, pen, computer or chemical plant, is an
art. Design of membrane systems is similar to the design of any other process unit and it
involves the use of membrane science along with mathematics, engineering methods
and tools such as models, simulations, drawings and spreadsheets [1]. These data and
tools can only support the professional judgement and will never eliminate the pro-
fessionals, since people are probably smarter than computers (and hopefully always
will be). Professionals use imagination, analogies, knowledge of practise and knowl-
edge of past disasters and experience which in some circumstances is like the hand of
God while sometimes is like the sword of Damocles for ground-breaking endeavours.
In general, the goal of process design can be defined as the selection of the best
opportunities among seemingly countless options to achieve the production goal within
the foreseen operational and economical window with fulfilment of legal issues. Such
definitions highlight the multi-objective nature of process design which in practise leads

to various designs of the same design problem delivered by different professionals.
Moran [2] noticed that the aim of process design is normally focused on determination of
certain key dimensions, areas and volumes based on a number of parameters. Therefore,
for non-novel processes, there may be set of rough rules of thumb, design guides,
standards or codes of practise. Nevertheless, the process design has to include consid-
erations and calculations (if possible) related to material selection (i.e. construction
materials, active materials such as catalysts, solvents, membranes, etc.), operating
conditions (i.e. normal operating conditions, start-up, shutdown, emergency situations,
etc.), energy carriers and usage, environmental considerations, plausible disasters, in-
vestment and operational costs, variations in feed stock characteristics and inﬂuence on
normal operations (more extreme conditions must be also carefully considered). The
above range is not limited and can be expanded by professionals, but provides the range
of typical considerations in process design practise.
In research and educational university practise, the process design of separation
technologies is mainly related either to the experimental confirmation of separation
concept in the laboratory scale, calculations of mass and energy balance or to fluid
dynamics. Typical engineering considerations of process design pointed above are
mainly outside the mainstream. In this chapter, the authors focus on the review of
aspects which can be supportive for process design professionals while designing the
membrane systems. Although at some points the Readers might have a feeling that the
process design calculations require proficiency in mathematics, chemistry or IT skills,
we keep in mind that the results should provide a minimum specification for an item, so
that the purchase of commercially available unit with a reasonable confidence of its
robustness would be possible [2]. Opaque outputs from modelling and simulation
programs are not a substitute for transparent process design calculations, therefore in
cases when it is possible, the short-cut methods would be also presented.
Regardless of which field would be considered, a membrane will be defined as the
object which allows some components to pass while others will not. Membrane, as an
object, can be solid or liquid in nature. Membranes can be biological, organic, inor-
ganic or hybrid in nature. Aside from which definition would be considered, the uti-
lisation of a membrane by humans requires the understanding of their nature, which is
reflected in the ability to design its usage.
For the purpose of this chapter, a membrane is defined as the semi-permeable
barrier for components, either chemical substances or biological compounds, syn-
thesised or made by humans for separation purposes. The separation goal is usually
achieved with only physical-based interactions (sorption, dissolution, solution,
diffusion, desorption, sieving, electrochemical rejection etc.). However, it has to be
kept in mind that when chemical substances are meeting and the membrane is one of
them, reactions between the chemicals and biochemicals can occur. Therefore, the
separation goal can be also achieved with accompanying chemical reactions, which is
not the scope for this chapter.
It is important to point out that membranes are also used to create mixtures with
tailored properties. The inorganic and even metallic membranes with narrow pore-
size distribution are effectively used for preparation of monodisperse emulsions.

1 Design of membrane systems

Additionally, membranes with precisely created holes are used as gas dispersers in
wastewater treatment plants.
The membrane system is defined here as the closed process equipment with a
membrane which actively separates two process streams (liquid, vapour, gas, sus-
pension or any of their mixtures). Such systems can be operated in batch, semi-batch,
semi-continuous or continuous mode. If continuous mode is considered, there will be
at least one inlet (feed) and two outlet streams (permeate and retentate). However, in
most of continuous processes, especially with no phase change, there will be one
addition inlet stream for permeate side which is called the carrier or sweep.
Despite the fact that the design of a process is made either as a wild guess (i.e. ad-
hoc solution) or experience-based, there is a need for a mathematical base. It is
especially needed in the contemporary engineering world, because only that which can
be measured can be used and reused. Designing is about reusing knowledge with the
aim to achieve the deﬁned goal. Moreover, designing with sufﬁcient mathematical
understanding is a key point in building the digital twins, which are essential for the
on-going revolution of Industry 4.0. With this broadly drawn introduction, the
following chapters are constructed as follows: (1) need for digital twins and modelling,
(2) membrane-based separation systems, (3) mixture creation with membrane-based
systems and (4) process modelling and simulation tools.
1.2 Requirements for digital twins and modelling
To facilitate the management, either from operational, economic or safety point of
view, it is beneficial to measure, validate and store data which can be used to control
and operate the plant in the best possible way. All that implies a need for virtual and
digital twins. The virtual twin reflects the object with use of idealised models [3] which
are based on well-deﬁned physical and chemical relations. On other hand, the digital
twins are data-based [3] and can be used to generate surrogate models describing the
dependence of a quality metric on process parameters and other measurements [3]. The
digital twins force the so-called Industry 4.0 revolution [4] which involves the use of
different digital technologies to collect data from various internal (e.g. various
equipment and departments within the same process facility) and/or external sources
(e.g. consumers, producers, manufacturers, security services or other tiers using the
product) consisting of the Internet of Things (IoT), centralisation, uniﬁcation and
harmonisation of various data in digital form (i.e. process and assets data). Both
concepts of virtual and digital twins are merged in a concept of hybrid twins [3] to
provide the holistic data and model environment of the whole plant. The trend of
building the digital and virtual twins is undoubtedly a part of the building information
modelling (BIM) methodology, which allows uniﬁcation design documentation as well
as managing and sharing information [4].
1.2 Requirements for digital twins and modelling

Life cycle of process plants by various authors and institutions is split in different
stages but nevertheless, the baseline is that the life cycle of the plant starts with
research and design, proceeds with construction and operation, and is finished with its
decommissioning [5]. Here, for purpose of deﬁning the life cycle of any process-
oriented plant, the division based on [6] has been adopted, consisting of seven steps: (1)
research and development, (2) process plant design (consisting of process design and
plant design as distinguished sub-steps), (3) procurement, commissioning and con-
struction, (4) start-up, (5) operation, maintenance and down-times, (6) modiﬁcations
and updates and (7) decommissioning. All the steps of process-plant life cycle are
presented graphically in Figure 1.1, in which the list of generated documentation and
types of various computer-aided tools is also presented.
Main stages of the life cycle of a process plant require and generate various sets of
data, which are bases for making decisions shortly or in an extended time. In general,
two sets of data can be defined. The first are these which define principal knowledge
generated through experiments, experience and already gathered data (e.g. literature,
standards, codes of practise, etc.) which are used for process modelling, simulation
and design. The second set of data takes its origin form process operations and in the
framework of this chapter is called operational data. The growth of these sets of data
changes over the life cycle with extreme growth of data for principal knowledge at the
beginning which decreases substantially over the life cycle, while operational data

substantially grows since the start-up up to the decommissioning (see Figure 1.1). Both
sets of data create the big data issue and a substantial need of data management.
Research and development build-up enormous amounts of experimental data usually
gathered in various reports and patents. These data are utilised in the following step of
process design which is accomplished along with approved economic analysis and
feasibility study. The process plant design is about transforming the selected process
ﬂow sheet into hardware by means of detailed engineering of equipment, piping,
utilities, constructions, locations, etc. with the use of speciﬁcation sets based on
speciﬁc industrial standards or codes. After the process plant design is completed, the
procurement, construction and commissioning (stage 3) of the facility can progress
which is concluded with start-up (stage 4). The life cycle of a plant usually consists of
long-term operation stages interrupted by maintenance and related planned down-
times (stage 5) which can be related to modiﬁcation and updates (stage 6). The cycle is
ﬁnished with decommissioning and ﬁnal close-off of the plant (stage 7). Additionally, it
is important to highlight that each of the stages generates various sets of data and
documentation, require adequate hazard and risk assessment, and the use of appro-
priate computer-aided tools and methods.
Plant design requires the cooperation of many groups of designers which may
range from chemists and physics, biochemical, chemical, safety, mechanical, electrical
and automation engineers up to civil engineers and architects. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to ensure an adequate exchange of data between them in a multi-discipline
environment, in order to organise the data generated by all disciplines and allow
synthesis of knowledge and distribution of information required by certain disciplines
at certain time. In that area, a plant design software (PDS) is a necessity and a tool
which provides an environment for multi-disciplinary and multi-user collaboration
within one computer-aided system with utilisation of material and equipment speci-
fications. The short review of PDS delivered, for example, by AVEVA, Bentley,
CADSchrorer, Haxagon, Autodesk, Alignex, Cadmatic IT and Factory is given in [4]. It is
important to notice that PDS gives the possibility to build the digital twin which might
involve data used in whole process design but also provides the possibility to collect
process and use data for the asset management during the operational period of a
process plant.
Adequate data management is needed at any step of the process-plant life cycle
which consists of collection of data from various origins (e.g. literature, experiments,
operational process, etc.) and first principles or grey-box models (i.e. models which
have physical meaning or insides). Use of data and models creates a cycle of deductive
and inductive processes around the collected data, as is presented in Figure 1.2.
Usually, the design of any process requires the use of a ﬁrst principles model or at least
a grey-box model which provide the essential physical relations between incoming and
outgoing streams. On this basis, the design can be deducted, leading to either an
experimental or fully operational process. Operating the process will deliver mea-
surements which can be analysed and provides a possibility for performance

prediction and improvements. Inductive approaches through monitoring and diag-
nosis of processes can lead to their better understanding, ultimately improving the
grey-box models. Actually, the cycle can be carried on inﬁnitely. The presented
deductive-inductive cycle can be considered at any single stage of the process-plant
lifecycle or as on the whole.
1.3 Membrane-based separation systems
In membrane-based separation systems the membrane is an active barrier that sepa-
rates the molecules based on either the sieving, diffusion, solution-diffusion mecha-
nism or their combination. Principles of modelling of membrane-based separation
systems have been widely discussed in the literature [7–15]. The driving force which
describes any membrane separation between feed and retentate (see Figure 1.3) can be
expressed as the difference of component chemical potential Δµi between the feed and
permeate. Although it should be noted that from a physicochemical point of view the
difference in chemical potentials between feed and permeate, and membrane surfaces
can play signiﬁcant role in establishing the actual driving force.
The membrane-based separation is characterised by component flux Ji and
membrane area A. In the view of Figure 1.3, the component ﬂux Ji depends on
component concentration ci and the coefﬁcient of proportionality Pi, which is not
necessarily constant, however it is linking the difference of chemical potential µi over
the membrane thickness x (Eq. (1.1)).

From an experimental and operational point of view, three parameters namely selec-
tivity (αi,j), rejection (Ri) and fraction of permeated (θ) feed need to be deﬁned. The
selectivity of membrane process αi,j towards component i is deﬁned by Eq. (1.2).
Component rejection deﬁnes the ratio of difference in component concentration on the
feed side ci,F and the permeate side ci,P (Eq. (1.3)). Fraction of permeated feed θ is
deﬁned as the ratio between the product of membrane area and sum of permeate
component ﬂuxes, and inlet ﬂowrate as it is expressed by Eq. (1.4).

The most challenging part of modelling membrane-based separation is the mathe-
matical description of physical interactions between separated component(s) and
membrane material, and definition of driving forces from a practical point of view.
Since there is a substantial amount of literature dealing with modelling of membrane-
based separations, the authors decided to list the recommended literature in that
matter.
The comprehensive review of nanofiltration and solvent resistant nanofiltration is
available in [16, 17]. Inﬂuence of all components present in the feed, even those orig-
inating from solutions used to adjust the pH, on the separation in nanoﬁltration pro-
cess have been recently discussed through the Donnan–Steric partitioning model
Figure 1.3: Concept of membrane-based separation (based on ref. [15]).

[18, 19]. Recently Ravichand and co-authors [14] reviewed works dealing with model-
ling of pressure-driven membrane-based liquid separations, membrane-based gas
separations and membrane distillation. Van der Bruggen and Luis [20] discussed
modelling strategies of mass transfer in pervaporation with use of solution-diffusion,
sorption, diffusion models as well as with pore-ﬂow model for binary, ternary and
multicomponent mixtures.
The literature examples shortly presented above deal with modelling of
membrane-based separation with models which are deeply linked to physical bases of
the processes. Nevertheless, when facing a challenging problem with significant
amount of experimental data but with limited physical inside which makes it impos-
sible to use the first principal or grey-box models, the artificial intelligence (AI) is
coming to the scene and plays the main role. The AI based on artificial neural networks
(ANN) is an approach in which a system mimics how the human mind processes
information and makes decisions [21]. ANNs have been applied to various membrane-
based separations [22], for example to model microﬁltration [23], ultraﬁltration [23–26],
nanoﬁltration [27], reverse osmosis [28–30], membrane distillation [30], pervaporation
[31] and even membrane-based reactors [30].
All models for membrane-based separations are carried out under idealised flow
patterns. In general, there can be differentiated six flow patterns in a membrane unit
which differ due to inlet and outlet flow configurations, and flow conditions in the
feed’s and permeate’s chambers (see Figure 1.4). The idealised membrane unit with well-
mixed chambers on both sides of a membrane is presented in Figure 1.4a. That conﬁg-
uration will justify the assumption of constant ﬂux and constant concentrations along
the length of the membrane, which is schematically presented on the right in Figure 1.4a.
More realistic patterns are shown in Figure 1.4b and c. Actually, countercurrent is more
frequently found than cocurrent since it offers better usage of driving force and yields
better separation at the lowest membrane area for the same operating conditions as in
the cocurrent conﬁguration. The majority of laboratory tests of membranes are con-
ducted in conﬁguration presented in Figure 1.4d, in case of which typical cross ﬂow is
assumed. From a practical point of view, in most laboratory tests it is assumed that ﬂuid
in the feed chamber is well-mixed. In some industrial processes, especially in mem-
brane distillation, the sweeping agent (also called carrier) is used in order to ensure
sufﬁcient removal of permeating component(s). The carrier is usually inert and does
not permeate through the membrane to the feed side. The use of a sweeping agent is
usually performed in two conﬁgurations, i.e. cocurrent (Figure 1.4e) and countercurrent
(Figure 1.4f). It has to be remembered that all of the idealised ﬂow patterns in membrane
separations presented in Figure 1.4 are rather more unique than frequently found in
industrial cases. But they are useful for modelling purposes. In industrial units, it is
possible to ﬁnd a mixture of the conﬁgurations presented above. The two most common
arrangements are spiral wound and hollow ﬁbber modules. In the spiral wound, a ﬂat
membrane sheet is separated by spacers and inserted in a pressure vessel. Spacers play
a signiﬁcant role not only for giving the space between membrane but also inﬂuence

the polarisation and fouling phenomena [32]. Hollow ﬁbre arrangement consists of
cylindrical membranes arranged in series in a pressure vessel. The selective layer is on
the outside of the ﬁbres. Usually, the feed enters the shell-side and the permeate passes
through the membrane to the centre of the hollow ﬁbres [33, 34].
When membrane-based separation is modelled, even with short-cut models, the
question which might arise will be related to the increase of overall process efficiency
and how to build the process based on available sizes of membrane units. If the
designer is interested in the scale-up of the membrane process, the simplest option to
consider is the sequential cascade as it is presented in Figure 1.5a. When not only scale-
up is of interest, but also separation efﬁciency and purity, the sequential counter
current cascade (Figure 1.5b) should be considered. If a single module ensures a high
enough concentration of the compound in need but scale-up is required, then the
designer should consider a parallel cascade conﬁguration (Figure 1.5c). The following
stripping and enrichment cascades networks (Figure 1.5d–F) present conﬁgurations
focused on obtaining high purity with a relatively high efﬁciency.

cascade; c) parallel cascade; d) two-stage stripping cascade; e) two-stage enriching cascade.

1 Design of membrane systems

Integration of membrane-based separation with and within other unit operations
was applied since the first membrane processes were proposed. However, Lipnizki
et al. [35] presented a feasible conﬁguration and interrelations between membrane
separations and other process units. Since then, hybrid process got signiﬁcant atten-
tion in research [12, 36–41] but there is little information about their application in-
dustry except integration in dehydration of alcohols [42]. Figure 1.6 illustrates some
common integration of membrane-based separation with reactor (Figure 1.6a and b) and

with other separation technique (i.e. distillation, Figure 1.6c–h). Not all here presented
conﬁguration can be called as hybrid processes but nevertheless they show possible
conﬁguration of membrane-based separation with other separation and reaction pro-
cesses. Integration of membrane with other unit operations is looked for when removal
of single component, rather than set of components, which differ in size or permeability
through membrane is enhancing the overall processes efﬁciency. This is especially
looked for in distillation of azeotropic mixture [43] or dehydration of reactive mixture in
order to move the reaction equilibrium towards required product [40].
1.4 Mixture creation with membrane-based systems
Unique application of membrane-based systems is related to the creation of multiphase
mixtures of either immiscible liquids leading to emulsions, or dispersion of gas in
liquids. Illustrative examples of the membrane emulsification process configurations
are presented in Figure 1.7.
Porous membranes have found application in emulsification processes, especially
in the pharmaceutical sector [44] and drug delivery [45]. The dispersed phase is pressed
through the pores of a microporous membrane while the continuous phase ﬂows along
the membrane surface. Droplets grow at pore outlet until they reach a certain size or
they are cut-off the membrane surface by the ﬂowing liquid of the continuous phase.
The detachment of a droplet is determined by the balance between the drag force on the
droplet from the continuous phase ﬂowing through the porous medium, the buoyancy
of the droplet, the interfacial tension forces and the driving pressure [45, 46].

The stability and size of droplets are particularly important in terms of the appli-
cability of emulsions. The stability of an emulsion is based on physical interactions
between the components forming and acting on the interfacial surface [47]. Stability is
also inﬂuenced by the droplet size distribution [48, 49], which is characterised by the
span value [(D90–D10)/D50]. For example, narrow distribution of droplet sizes is char-
acteristic for monodisperse emulsions which are more stable in comparison to multi-
disperse emulations [50]. From an operational point of view, it is possible to assess the
droplet size based on empirical (i.e. grey-box) models.
Suárez et al. [44] reviewed and proposed a set of model expressions for estimation
of the droplet size Dd in the stirred tank equipped with a ﬂat membrane and for oil-in-
water emulsions. The key parameter for droplet detachment is the shear stress τ on the
membrane surface. When balance between drag force and interfacial tension force is
considered, then droplet diameter D[4,3] (diameter of the sphere with volume equivalent
to the droplet) can be estimated with Eqs. (1.5) or (1.6). Additionally, rough estimation
of the minimum droplet size produced with use of membranes with round pores were
proposed in the form of Eq. (1.7).

In some cases, especially in wastewater treatment and aerobic fermentation,
membrane diffusers are utilised in order to create gas-liquid(s) systems [51–53]. The
membrane diffusers gained attention due to their large aeration area with evenly
distributed gas bubbles, easy operation and maintenance. The use of membrane dif-
fusers allows to deliver ﬁne gas bubbles, therefore signiﬁcantly increases the ratio of
gas interfacial area to its volumetric ﬂowrate. This leads to an improvement of mass
transfer coefﬁcient from gas phase into the liquid phase and has signiﬁcant impact on
decreasing the energy requirement [54]. Although there are reported studies regarding
aeration or gas-delivering into the liquid phase with use of membrane diffusors, there
is little information about the design equation for correlating the size of gas bubbles,
liquid phase properties and volumetric gas ﬂowrate, although there are some works
which correlated the mass transfer and bubble size [51] as well as gas ﬂowrate and
hydrodynamics in a vessel with the gas hold-up [53].

1.5 Database for membrane selection
Specific membrane-based separation is selected by designers, engineers and/or re-
searchers mainly based on their experience. The available information regarding
prediction of component fluxes through membranes is rather limited, especially in
multicomponent mixtures which are typical for industrial applications. Therefore,
widespread literature surveys and queries to producers are required, causing diffi-
culties in the identification of the promising membrane-based separation techniques
along with appropriate membrane and process conditions for a given separation task.
The need of extensive survey and lack of information result in challenges during the
implementation of membrane-based separation techniques in the development of
chemical and biochemical processes. Therefore, a need to search through some
membrane-based separation processes databases seems to be a good choice and is
looked for.
Authors have been monitoring the availability of the membrane and separation-
oriented databases over the last decades. There were several attempts in the devel-
opment of membrane databases such as the: database developed by Günther and
Hapke [55], MBR database provided by MBR Network, Catalogue Membrane Technol-
ogy provided by Dechema, and MemData [15, 56], which unfortunately were suspended
and are no longer available.
The specialised membrane separation database was developed by Günther and
Hapke [55]. That database aimed to assist the specialist, i.e. engineers and researchers,
in selecting modules for the pilot scale and engineering analysis. The database con-
tained two essential parts which presented the organised data with respect to: (1) basic
information about the membrane module and the data delivered by the manufacturer
and (2) extended data related to the application and separation performance of the
membrane module (including experimental separation characteristic of the mem-
brane). Within the database it was possible to carry on the separation efﬁciency
calculation but only for the reverse osmosis modules. Nevertheless, the database
collected information about four types of membrane-based separation processes: ul-
traﬁltration, microﬁltration, nanoﬁltration and reverse osmosis.
The MBR database was developed by the MBR Network and contained data related
to the membrane bioreactors (MBRs) utilised only in the wastewater applications. The
MBR database contained data about producers of MBR and possible application scale
(e.g. household, municipal, etc.) but without membrane characteristic data. That on-
line database was suspended a few years ago and appropriate reference is missing.
The Catalogue Membrane Technology aimed at providing a wide-ranging survey
on the developers, manufacturers and suppliers of membranes and modules of
any membrane-based separation process, which were in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland. The collected data could have been searched with respect to separation
technique and application ﬁeld, institution and research topic, also with regard of
14

researcher. The catalogue did not make available information about the separation
efﬁciency or process operation.
The data in the MemData was classified into different categories related to process
module description, membrane information, experimental set-up, flux experimental
data, modelling and permeability of pure compound. The structure of the database
allowed gathering information about polymer-based membrane used in pervapora-
tion, vapour permeation and gas separation. It was reported [56] that the MemData
included information regarding 277 membranes, 112 experimental points of ﬂux mea-
surements of multicomponent mixtures and 1123 data points of pure component
permeability through polymer membranes. Moreover, four models and correlations
were also included. Further development of the MemData was suspended in 2016.
Recently, the open membrane database (OMD) which focuses on reverse osmosis
membranes was reported [57]. That database is available online under the address
www.openmembranedatabase.org and represents data of over 600 water puriﬁcation
and desalination membranes that have been gathered from peer-reviewed journals,
reports and commercial product data. It is important that the authors provided clear
information regarding the transport theory underlying the membrane performance
calculations and best practises for membrane performance testing and reporting.
With respect to gas separation membrane systems, it is important to point out that
the Polymer Handbook [58] also provides information about permeability, diffusivity
and solubility of pure components (mainly gases) through polymeric membranes.
These data are usually sufﬁcient in order to ﬁnd a promising membrane for gas sep-
aration applications.
A summary of all existing databases related to the membrane-based separation
processes is given in Table 1.1. It is clear that the module database (Günther and Hapke
[55]) would be most valuable from the point of view of the design engineer, as it could

processes. The other two databases provide only a list of producers that design engi-
neers can contact with respect to their speciﬁc applications. Currently, only the OMD is
available for the design engineers for use at an early stage of membrane system design.
1.6 Process modelling and simulation tools – a brief
review
Process simulation and modelling tools can be divided into three groups: (1) process
simulation software (PSS), (2) modelling-simulation software (MSS) and (3) modelling
and process simulation software (M&PSS) (M&PSS). PSS use predeﬁned unit opera-
tions within the software but without the possibility to view the used equations. In
contradiction to general process simulation tools, the modelling simulation software
provides complete deﬁnition of modelling equations for which appropriate mathe-
matical solvers are provided. The most modern and quite recently developed attempt
involves software which is based on creating ﬂowsheets that consist of predeﬁned unit
operations with the possibility of deﬁning custom models. Within the last group, some
of software incorporated the unique possibility to dig into the governing equations for
all models, i.e. models of predeﬁned unit operations and custom models.
To fulfil the requirement of a brief review and its general purpose in the volatile
business environment, it should be remembered that software developers usually
provide an environment which might include a set of various software and programs.
Therefore, the authors of this chapter limited to name a set of environments rather than
the specific software. The general overview of the reviewed software suits is presented
in Table 1.2. One of the vast computer-aided modelling environments is delivered by
Aspen® [59] which can be used for modelling, design, simulation and optimisation of
batch and continuous processes, troubleshooting and monitoring the plant perfor-
mance through online and real-time optimisation. Aspen offers interfaces for pro-
prieties models and its parameter estimation. CHEMCAD® [60] software is an integrated
suite of Chemstations, designed to improve the productivity and solve the process
ﬂowsheets with limited use of build-in custom models. Similarly, the CAD tool is a
steady state and dynamic process simulator PRO/II [61] delivered by AVEVA, which has
an in-built membrane unit with the permeate pressure, component permeability
constants and membrane area as inputs. SuperPro Designer [62] is an interesting
ﬂowsheet simulator for batch or continuous processes as well as their combination
with the possibility of process scheduling, equipment sizing and costing. Within
SuperPro Designer there is a possibility to use microﬁltration, ultraﬁltration and
reverse osmosis units. Another approach to simulation of membrane systems is
presented in the WAVE [63] design software which focuses only on ultraﬁltration,
reverse osmosis and ion-exchange processes.

1 Design of membrane systems

The group of MSS contains software which allows the user to define almost any
mathematical model and solve it with possibility of selecting various and dedicated
solvers. Matlab [64] and MatCAD [65] are the ﬁrst choices for that group. Although
MathCAD does not provide of any ﬂow sheeting experience, its beneﬁts include user-
friendly symbolic-like input of model equations which can be easily organised with
notes experience. In contradiction, Matlab offers more programmer-like experience
with a combination of ﬂowsheet-like experience with use of Simulink.
Here, the gPROMS [66] is opening the basket M&PSS software with an advanced
equation-oriented process modelling environment, which can be used to model,
analyse and optimise any equation-based model in a user-friendly ﬂow sheeting
environment. An interesting upcoming star of M&PSS is the AVEVA™Process Simu-
lation [67] software. Process Simulation offers novel approach to the equation-based
environment for process simulation which includes possibility to track every equation
used in the simulation and easy-to-use switching between process, ﬂuid ﬂow and
dynamic modes. It is important to point out that the process simulator delivered by
AVEVA allows the unique possibility to transfer the model and the data to the process
plant design and operational environment developed and delivered by AVEVA for
more than four decades. Even though gPROMS® and AVEVA™Process Simulation
include speciﬁc models of membrane units, it is recommended to adopt these models to
the speciﬁc requirements of modeller.
From a practical point of view, the use of the included membrane models in any
commercial software should be carried out carefully with outstanding verification of
used parameters and included assumptions with the models. Therefore, many re-
searchers and process designers develop their own models directly in the MSS or
M&PSS software, or develop models in external environments (e.g. MS Excel, VBA, etc.)
which can be used within simulators directly or with use of COM or CAPE-Open
standards.
1.7 Summary
The main question in design of membrane systems is how to select the appropriate
membrane process and membrane itself with respect to the separation efficiency and
operational performance. Selection of a membrane process is a matter of defining the
purpose i.e. separation or creation. The membrane-based separation processes are
selected mainly due to the difference in size (sieve mechanisms) or in diffusivity (so-
lution-diffusion mechanism) of separated components. Designers must make their
choices based on their experience, literature review or external expertise’s. In recent
years, a significant increase in experimental research on membrane-base separations
is observed while process modelling works are rather limited.
In this chapter, the design of membrane systems has been reviewed and placed
within a wide perspective of challenges encountered within industry 4.0, big data

perspective and data management. The possible membrane configuration with other
separation processes as well as with reactive processes has been presented.
For process designers, the important part of the work is related to process
modelling and simulation tools. The available computer-aided tools have been divided
into three groups and their main futures have been presented. It is important to note,
that almost all software environments include the possibility to communicate with
other CAD tools, allowing some model or process simulation capabilities along with
other company-specific analysis. In this area, the usability of AI is observed, which is
also reflected by the possibilities offered by three out of 10 modelling and simulation
environments.
To summarise, the main drawbacks for designers of membrane systems are related
to the lack or extremely limited predictive mathematical modelling, membrane phys-
ical properties and membrane process separation databases, making the design of the
membrane separation system challenging and highly dependent on specific expert
knowledge. These issues are even more noticable for membrane systems used for
mixture creation.

2 Membrane technologies for sports
supplementation
Abstract: The important developments in membrane techniques used in the dairy
industrial processes to whey manufacturing are discussed. Particular emphasis is
placed on the description of membrane processes, characterization of protein prod-
ucts, biological issues related to bacteriophages contamination, and modeling of the
processes. This choice was dictated by the observed research works and consumer
trends, who increasingly appreciate healthy food and its taste qualities.
Keywords: bacteriophages; dairy; membrane process; ultrafiltration; whey.
2.1 Introduction
The human body has evolved on the basis of survival needs, developing features pre-
destining it to lead a life requiring high motor activity with relatively low food supply.
Overthe last two hundred years, there has been a rapid civilizational change inthe way of
life, which has become much less demanding in terms of physical activity and mobility
while increasing the availability of food. In addition, the industrialization of food pro-
duction has resulted in a significant decrease in its nutritional quality while increasing its
caloric content. This has led to consequences in the form of civilization diseases related to
or caused by the growing problem of obesity. At the same time, it has been noted that one
of the factors that have a positive impact on health is appropriately balanced physical
activity. Human physical activity is therefore one of the key elements of a healthy society.
Many sports disciplines use supplementation with the use of preparations with an
increased concentration of protein, branched-chain essential amino acids such as BCAA,
or minerals from the group of magnesium, zinc, or copper. The World Health Organiza-
tion WHO has included relevant recommendations [1] concerning the necessary amount
of exercise in the life of modern people, which is supposed to provide a possibly healthy
lifestyle. It is considered that adults should undertake weekly 150–300 min of moderate-
intensity physical activity or 75–150 min of high-intensity physical activity, or a corre-
sponding combination of moderate-intensity and high-intensity aerobic activity. Rec-
ommendations for children and adolescents recommend an average of 60 min per day of
moderate- to high-intensity aerobicphysical activity throughout the week. Theguidelines

recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity in all age groups. In addition, a
reduction in sedentary lifestyles is recommended in all age groups and ability types.
Popularization of the use of sports supplements is particularly widespread in
bodybuilding, strength and, to a lesser extent, endurance sports. The T-Nation [2]
website, which is run by experienced professionals in the ﬁeld of sports and popular in
the strength sports community, devotes a lot of attention to the issue of proper nutrition
and supplementation, also raising difﬁcult issues related to doping with anabolic
substances, which are not approved for sports or recreational use in many countries.
The articles appearing in the area of this website are in many cases formulated on the
basis of reports from the scientiﬁc community and classic publications in professional
journals. A number of other websites also contribute to the popularization of active
lifestyles and devote much attention to the correct use of this type of supplementation.
In this work, the main focus is on problems that accompany the manufacturing
processes for sports supplements using membrane techniques. Membrane techniques
are a well-known and popular method of concentrating a variety of substances, from
metal ions to large organic structures like proteins. Proteins are the main component in
most nutritional supplements for athletes or people who are undergoing rehabilitation.
The worldwide nutritional supplements market volume was estimated to be $10.7
billion in 2020 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10.9%
from 2021 to 2028. The number of consumers centered on personal wellness and fitness
self-care and prevention is increasing. In addition, there is growing realization about
the elevated threat of serious health conditions in COVID-19 patients affected by
obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, the amount of consumptive con-
sumers suffering from lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes and obesity is quickly
increasing. Based on the International Diabetes Federation, 463 million adults aged 20
to 79 had diabetes in 2019, and it is expected that this number will rise to 700 million by
2045. It is estimated that all these elements will boost fitness activities participation
and drive usage of various supplements especially athletic nutrition supplements
products over the predicted forecast period [3].
Increasing attention to the accessibility of athletic nutritional supplements is
quickly increasing, therefore in turn propelling the market. In addition, health en-
thusiasts are increasingly learning about the advantages of various components and
nutritional supplements from a variety of sources. Based on a survey released by
Friesland Campina Ingredients [4], by 2020, in addition to healthcare professionals,
45% of adults look to ﬁtness gyms and personal trainers for dietary guidance, and 53%
look to friends and family for nutritional information. Furthermore, there is a surge in
consumer need for plant-derived and immune-boosting nutritional foods. Major mar-
ket leaders are releasing new products to cater to consumer demand. As an example, in
May 2020, Orgain [5] launched several types of plant-based organic protein powders,
including Organic Sport Protein Powder, Organic Sports Recovery Powder, and Organic
Sport Energy Powder targeted at different customer groups, e.g. adults, children, or
diabetics.

2 Membrane technologies for sports supplementation

The increasing population of individuals with active lifestyles is pushing the sports
supplements market. As reported by International Health, Racquet, and Sportsclub
Association (IHRSA) [6], the amount of health club consumers in 2010 was 58 million,
which has increased to 73.6 million in 2019. Furthermore, sportsmen are concentrating
on satisfying nutritional demands together with athletic activities to improve their
physical performance.
Many major and local market contributors are launching new tastes, compounds,
and technologies. Ostrovit [7] introduced a number of new tastes of several whey and
casein protein supplements, ranging from white chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and
cocoa to other coffee-based and inspired by desserts. Lonza [8] launched TWK10 [9, 10],
a probiotic for use in athletic nutrition, in September 2020. TWK10 is an extract of
Lactobacillus plantarum, derived from the Kimchi plant from Taiwan, that aids in
improving athletic performance by increasing energy gathering and muscle
endurance.
Therefore, the increase in demand for dietary supplements including protein nu-
trients in particular is expected to generate and will continue to drive strong growth in
the dietary supplements market (Figure 2.1).
2.2 Types and classification of dietary supplements
A simple correlation between nutritional intake and physical performance does not
exist, but there is a relationship between proper supplementation and physical per-
formance [11–15]. Many researchers [16–18] point out that the physical performance of
the individuals is a resultant of many factors, including aptitude, training and diet
quality, and the mental predisposition of the person. They also emphasize that many
supplements exhibit a “placebo effect” in sportspersons at best. The increased physical
activity that accompanies sports results in an increased demand for energy and many
nutrients. However, scientiﬁc studies show [19–22] that a properly composed diet,
Figure 2.1: Expected market size for sports supplements [3].
2.2 Types and classification of dietary supplements
27

based on natural products alone is able to provide increased amounts of energy and all
necessary nutrients. Yet the supplementation for professional athletes is advisable,
especially under high training loads. When using nutritional supplements, the primary
goal is to take care of the health of the individuals, therefore the supplements used
should be safe, effective, and allowed for use in sports. Nutritional supplements for the
sporting population are a group of products with poorly researched side effects, which
is why great care and moderation are required when using them. Currently, on the
market, there are many products aimed at physically active people, whose effects have
not been conﬁrmed by reliable scientiﬁc studies. The effectiveness of many of them is
therefore problematic. In addition, nutritional supplements may contain substances
prohibited in sport and their use carries a risk of disqualiﬁcation [23–25].
2.3 Proteins in the view of food functional
classification
Functional properties of proteins are classified according to their respective physico-
chemical properties, the most important of which are hydrophilicity, phase boundary
behavior, intermolecular interactions, and organoleptic properties that impart desir-
able characteristics to food products [26]. Therefore, the functional properties of pro-
teins are deﬁned as the properties that have the greatest inﬂuence on the texture,
appearance, viscosity, mouthfeel, or taste of a product. In addition to their nutritional
value, proteins should also have certain functional properties that enhance processing
and provide the foundation for an efﬁcient product. Dietary functional properties of
proteins refer to the physicochemical properties that control the behavior of proteins in
products [27]. To further understand these functional contexts, it is necessary to
comprehend more than just the physicochemical properties of proteins, as well as their
structural architecture (beginning with primary chains and ending with quaternary
structures) and the diverse set of interactions that help stabilize higher-order protein
structures [28].
Most of the major functional properties of proteins can be divided into two main
groups: surface and hydration related. Functional properties that are associated with
hydration involve dispersibility, solubility, swelling, viscosity, and gelation. The
properties associated with surface activity include emulsification, foaming, and air–
water and oil–water interface adsorption. Additional functional properties that do not
fall into either of these two classes include diffusion and denaturation processes, and
proteins intermolecular interactions that comprise protein–protein, protein–ion, and
protein–ligand bonds forming.
Whey proteins are the proteins remaining in milk serum after the coagulation of
caseins in an environment of pH 4.6 and a temperature of 20 °C. In industrial practice,
28
2 Membrane technologies for sports supplementation

acid whey is a by-product of caseinate or cottage cheese production. It is made by
adapting the pH of skim milk to a value of 4.6 by adding glucono delta lactone acid or a
culture of lactic acid bacteria, then cutting and cooking the curds and draining the
resulting whey. Sweet whey is produced by inoculating milk with lactic acid bacterial
cultures to acidify it to a pH in the range of 6.2–6.4 and adding a coagulating enzyme,
rennet for rennet cheese production.
Whey proteins are characterized by a compact globular structure, with a molecular
weight in the range of 14–1000 kDa. One of the primary properties of whey proteins is
their high content of sulfhydryl amino acid residues. During high-temperature pro-
cessing of whey and whey protein concentrate (WPC) solutions, it is this property that
allows whey proteins to form intermolecular covalent bonds. Disulﬁde intermolecular
bonds play a key role during the heat-induced formation of whey protein gels and act to
stabilize foam structures. However, the formation of these bonds during the manu-
facture and storage of WPC is highly undesirable as it leads to a product with low
solubility and usability.
When planning and designing appropriate installations for the production of whey
protein, there are two main issues to consider, namely the source of the protein [29] and
the target form of the protein [30]. The primary sources are milk, eggs, beans, soy, rice,
and in some rare cases beef. Figure 2.2 shows the typical protein forms which are
ranked in the direction of increasing processing. The resultant protein concentrate can
be regarded as the primary form of a protein supplement containing up to 80% protein.
Isolate is the next step in increasing protein concentration and hydrolysate is the ﬁnal
form in which protein molecules are pre-hydrolyzed into shorter and more nutritionally
absorbable chains.

2.3 Proteins in the view of food functional classification
29

2.4 Membranes in food industry
A typical classification of membranes is ordered by average pore size. Membranes
belong to the so-called dense membranes, when the transport of components has two
steps: dissolution and diffusion through the membrane material. Membranes used in
microfiltration usually have a pore size in the range of 0.1–10 µm. Membranes used in
ultraﬁltration have pore sizes in the range of 0.001–0.1 µm and are capable of retaining
substances with molecular weights in the range of 300–106 Da. Membranes used in
reverse osmosis are capable of retaining solvents with a molar mass below 1000 Da,
while nanoﬁltration membranes are suitable for retaining solvents in the molar mass
range between 1000 and 3000 Da.
Two typical membrane systems used are dead-end and cross-flow [31–35]. In the
dead-end type of operation, the liquid to be ﬁltered is forced through the pores of the
membrane usually by exerting pressure on the feed side of the membrane. In the cross-
ﬂow type of operation, the feed ﬂuid ﬂows in a parallel direction to the surface of the
membrane and penetrates the membrane by means of a pressure difference. Cross-ﬂow
minimizes the build-up of ﬁlter cake, thus keeping it at a low size. In cross-ﬂow mode,
the most widely utilized membrane units incorporate hollow ﬁbers, tubular ﬁbers, ﬂat
plates, and spiral wound devices. Hollow ﬁber and spiral wound types of modules offer
the densest membrane packing because they have the channels of the smallest
diameter. Though, this makes them more sensitive to fouling and may impede the
cleanup process. Either of these cross-ﬂow conﬁgurations of devices can also be used in
dead-end operations. However, such setups are subject to high fouling rates.
At present, traditional chromatography is still considered as the most efficient way
to separate and purify whey proteins on an industry scale [36]. Various chromato-
graphic techniques such as afﬁnity, ion exchange, and hydrophobic exchange have
been used to perform protein separation, but they have drawbacks such as fouling,
long cycle times, and complex control systems for the process [37, 38]. To address these
shortcomings, macroporous membrane based monoliths have recently been used to
improve the separation rate and decrease the backpressure, thus preventing nonspe-
ciﬁc product binding and degradation. The beneﬁts of using such monoliths are
comparable to those of conventional chromatography [39]. The pressure processes
using membrane technology are extremely important for the removal of mineral salts
from whey. Whey is condensed by vaporization or reverse osmosis and subjected to
demineralization by electrodialysis or using ion-exchange resins at present [40–42].
Nanoﬁltration membranes have the potential to be applied to perform demineraliza-
tion due to their permeability to single-valent salts and organic species, enabling at the
same time to reduce energy expense and wastewater output [43–46]; reverse osmosis
ensures the retention of approximately 99.8% of lactose and its overall recovery of
74%, thus making water evaporation or crystallization easier [47]; microﬁltration is
most commonly used to eliminate microorganisms and remaining lipids, reducing to a
30
2 Membrane technologies for sports supplementation

minimum the fouling phenomenon and its impact on downstream processes [48, 49].
Figure 2.3 presents area of each usability of membrane techniques to the separation of
mixtures that contain contaminants of various sizes.
Membrane processes that use the pressure difference between the feed and
permeate sides to drive solvent transport across the membrane involve microfiltration,
ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis [50]. Table 2.1 illustrates the cate-
gorization of membrane processes based on particle kind and size [51]. Membrane
processes based on the pressure principle are the most essential membrane processes,
which are typical unit operations in the ﬁeld of dairy industry. Microﬁltration is pri-
marily used for clariﬁcation and skimming of cheese whey. Several studies [52–56]
presented in detail the application of ceramic and polymeric membranes for micro-
ﬂushing of skimmed milk; reverse osmosis is used for partially demineralizing or pre-
concentrating whey, and nanoﬁltration is adequately capable of providing concurrent
demineralization and concentration of whey [57].

2.4 Membranes in food industry
31

The application of membrane filtration process technologies provides a broad
spectrum of benefits to both the consumer and the producer. Membrane filtration
technique is an innovative, nonthermal, environmentally safe, sustainable technology
with many opportunities for the future that mitigates the negative effects of rising
temperatures such as phase change, proteins denaturation and alteration of the sen-
sory attributes of the resultant good. Membranes eliminate undesirable contaminants
such as bacteria, medicines, or residues that adversely affect the quality of the product,
resulting in a more attractive consistency and longer product lifespan. The membranes
are highly selective because of their specific mechanisms of functioning such as ion
exchange, diffusion of the solution, etc. The membranes are well suited for various
kinds of installations and development because of their space-saving construction and
require very little servicing. The functioning of membranes is quite straightforward,
competitive, and does not need any specialist expertise to maintain or work with them.
To achieve the expected results, it is occasionally required to employ a battery of
membranes instead of an individual membrane [58–61] and to re-engineer the entire
production of an industrial plant by incorporating different membrane operations
already invented [62–64].
Several other membrane techniques are used to obtain whey in higher concen-
trations. Membrane chromatography is employed for the retrieval and purification of
proteins. Nevertheless, membrane adsorption technology allows the recovery of high-
value minority proteins from whey along with the optimization of process expenses.
Consequently, membrane chromatography is a promising and innovative protein
separation technique that combines filtration and liquid chromatography in a one-step
approach [65].
Ion-exchange membrane chromatography is another technique that allows the
concentration of proteins. Protein separation by ion exchange membranes is based on
the electrostatic effect between charged proteins and the surface of adsorption. Ion
exchange membranes find widespread use for the isolation of amino acids and pro-
teins. The target molecule is found to repel the counter ion bound to the active surface
region, and this counter ion is subsequently removed with a complimentary buffer salt.
To achieve high separation efficiency, it is essential to select a suitable buffer to protect
the target native protein [66]. The dynamic binding capacity of a given membrane
system relies on both the size of the target protein molecule and the conditions such as
protein concentration, pH, and ionic strength.
Membrane Affinity Chromatography is commonly used for protein recovery. This
technology is based on the strong interactions occurring between ligands and target
proteins due to their biological features. The entire process consists of three steps:
loading, washing, and elution. The main assets of membrane based chromatography
over conventional chromatography are short diffusion time (because of the intermo-
lecular effects inside the pores), small pressure drop, high flux rate and high efficiency.
This method is preferable for bigger proteins as they seldom penetrate inside the pore
as they are blocked at the outer surface. Some researchers also indicate that membrane
32
2 Membrane technologies for sports supplementation

chromatography is adequate for treating high volumes of liquids with low concen-
trations of the desired proteins [39].
2.5 Phages issues
Bacteriophages refer to viruses that affect microbial cultures and have a high repro-
duction rate. For this reason, they are commonly the cause of serious fermentation
difficulties, particularly in the industrial dairy sector. The problem is well known for
several years and the constant risk of serious bacteriophage infections in the dairy
industry demands thorough phage detection as the primary means of bacteriophage
control [67]. Temperature-induced phage inactivation is overall feasible, but the
required temperatures impact the whey product functionality because of denaturation
of whey proteins. It is proposed to introduce a “phage ﬁltration” process stage before
further processing of dairy whey into whey products to minimize the possibility of
fermentation due to phage contamination [68]. Furthermore, the extremely high sta-
bility of phage in whey powder samples during long-term storage for four years has
been documented [69]. Lactococcal phages remained detectable after pasteurization of
milk followed by spray drying. There was no decrease in phage titer detected during the
nine-month storage of milk powder [70], indicating that phage populations were highly
stable in the dry powder matrix. A publication of Samtlebe et al. [71], showed the
applicability of organic membranes with 100–500 kDa cutoff to isolate Lactococcus
lactis phage from main whey proteins in native whey. This yielded a reduction of phage
by 3.7 log units using a 300 kDa membrane. On the other hand, polymeric membranes
exhibit a low protein permeability of 50% with a ﬁltrate ﬂux of 120 L/(h m−2).
Figure 2.4 presents a simpliﬁed schematic of a process for dairy processing to
produce whey powder. The indicated stage presents the phase when phages are pro-
cessed to be removed.
The “phage-free” whey is an important issue during the manufacturing of several
whey products. In Michel et al. work [72], this problem is addressed. Bacteriophages are
typically present in raw milk in levels up to 104 plaque-forming units (pfu) mL−1. To
obtain better bacteriophage removal (≥9 log units), an orthogonal process approach
that is a combined version of various techniques that support each other was used.
In recent years, there have been a number of different studies on combining sep-
aration and purification techniques for bacteriophages in whey. One approach is to
merge them in an orthogonal way, well known as hurdle concept or hurdle technology
[73, 74]. An orthogonal process is characterized by the use of at least two different,
independent techniques in such a way as to make the best possible use of the syner-
gistic phenomenon. For whey proteins, UV light is used in combination with membrane
ﬁltration. To obtain satisfactory bacteriophage removal and the mildest possible
treatment of whey, a process is proposed [72] that integrates two techniques: cross-ﬂow
membrane ﬁltration followed by UV-C treatment or heat treatment. Consequently,
2.5 Phages issues
33

three common viral contaminants in dairy, i.e. L. lactis bacteriophages (P001, P008,
and P680), which infect acidogenic starter bacterial cultures, were investigated in
detail for their behavior during inactivation in ﬁltered whey by UV-C treatment and
heat treatment. Heat processing was found to be merely partially successful because

involved application rates of up to 2.25 J cm−2 for effective inactivation, thus providing a
viable route to investigate the possibility of establishing a new “phage-free” whey
production process.
Although there have been extensive research studies in the struggle to control
phages over the years following their discovery, they remain a serious economic
problem for dairy manufacturers. Effective approaches have been suggested e.g.
phage-resistant strains, starter culture management, enhanced industrial design, and
proper sanitizing measures, to maintain phages under general control. Yet, these
remedies have not fully overcome the challenge, in part because of the continued
evolution of phages and the conglomeration of the milk industry with growing dairy
facilities operating huge amounts of milk each year [75].
2.6 Simulations and modeling concerned on
membrane whey production
2.6.1 Fluid dynamics
One of the techniques that is used to perform an analysis based on calculations and
simulations for the whey proteins ultrafiltration is computational fluid dynamics. CFD
is a method applied to solve equations representing fluid flow through numerical
methods. The use of this sort of approach gives the remarkable potential for studying
flow phenomena, facilitates their better understanding, and at the same time provides
an opportunity to optimize available solutions. For many years it has been imple-
mented at the stage of developing new solutions as a tool reducing the development
time of a product, enabling to outperform the competition not only in terms of time but
at the same time on the degree of quality of the offered results. In most cases, so-
phisticated software is necessary to take benefit of the available potential. It enables to
provide detailed results in a relatively short span of time even taking into account that
quite high computational power is required.

Although a number of components of membrane process are well-understood, the
development of more productive membrane modules and the selection of optimal
operational parameters is impeded by the absence of a well-validated and reliable
model to depict this process: In other words, there is at present essentially no existing
model that can forecast the whey sample filtration efficiency of a particular filtration

unit, based on quantifiable sample volumes and under different operating environ-
ments. Bottlenecks to address involve relying on single-dimensional or averaged
models in forecasting a spatially inhomogeneous process, and the uncertainties con-
cerning the nature and significance of filtration resistances, particularly mashing
mechanisms. There are several reduced-dimensional (for example one dimension or
surface-averaged) models that are widely used to characterize filtration processes.
Among them are the film model, the gel polarization model, the shear-induced diffu-
sion model, and the osmotic pressure model [76–78]. Although each is derived from a
mechanistic process model, all of them depict process properties using space inde-
pendent quantities (for example single whey concentration or surface area or amount
of protein impurities). Two interpretations of this mathematical structure exist, the
process is either one-dimensional (1D), implying that all characteristics in solution and
on the membrane do not vary with the tangential position in the ﬁltration channel or
the values utilized in the study constitute variables averaged over the membrane
region. For dead-end ﬁltration, in which there is no tangential ﬂow pattern over the
length of the membrane, such reduced dimensionality models precisely reﬂect reality
because there are no substantial mechanisms for the formation of uneven regions at
the membrane area. In more industrially signiﬁcant cross-ﬂow ﬁltration, however, the
pressure drop over the length of the channel is driving the tangential ﬂow to the
membrane, resulting in changing conditions in the mixture and on the membrane
surface at different locations. A previous study presented a comparison of permeate
ﬂux predicted using an area-averaged model for UF crossﬂow of bovine serum albumin
with a comparative CFD calculation that accounted for spatial variations along the
membrane interface [79]. Previous experiments and studies by Schausberger et al. [80,
81] showed that for all except the smallest transmembrane pressures, nonlinearities in
the properties of the ﬂuid suspension, such as osmotic pressure, viscosity, and diffu-
sivity, resulted that area-averaged and 1D models considerably understated permeate
ﬂux relative to corresponding CFD calculations, and none of the mass transfer corre-
lations needed by reduced-dimensional models seemed to be able to capture the
resistance to ﬁltration in the mixture (known as concentration polarization, or CP)
computed by CFD models. Remarkably, all accessible mass transfer correlations ignore
the effect of permeate ﬂow into the membrane, rather they are strictly applied to the
mass transfer of dissolved substances adjacent to the wall.
To study the UF process of whey proteins, mixture models are similarly used [82] to
predict the concentration and velocity distribution of the solid in the vicinity of the
membrane, in both dead-ﬂow and cross-ﬂow regimes. Because whey proteins have a
reasonably dense globular structure, hard-sphere theory is employed to model solid
suspension permeability and osmotic pressure: these features rely only on parameters
that can be tested on an independent basis, like size and concentration of the protein.
The model predictions appear to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results
for both ﬂow regimes, importantly in the lack of any complementary resistance models
accounting for (for example) blockage of pores, superﬁcial adsorption, or gel/cake
36

buildup. The authors concluded that when dead-end ﬁltration is performed, the degree
of ﬂux drop is reasonably related to the thickness of the concentration layer and the
peak concentration of solids reached the surface of the membrane. During cross-ﬂow
regime, advection of suspension from the bulk space in the direction of the membrane
raises the ﬂux of the permeate, especially along the membrane boundary. Modeling the
system using simple two-dimensional geometry yields qualitative versus quantitative
correspondence with the experiment, emphasizing the requirement to precisely grasp
the system geometry to model concentration polarization (CP) phenomena effects. It is
shown that ﬁltration of whey proteins of industrial importance can be predicted and
described by multiphase suspension modeling of a hard-sphere paradigm with the
experimentally measured size of particles and provides the opportunity for improved
optimization and UF system design for whey separation. Independent continuity and
momentum balance equations for each component present (i.e., the ﬂuid forming a
continuous medium and the protein) are solved. Multiﬂuid mixture models are the
multiphase approach in the way that they incorporate explicitly the forces between and
upon each of the components, i.e., for the case of ultraﬁltration, the ﬂuid-protein
resistance and the osmotic pressure induced by the proteins. Authors summarize that
the hard-sphere theory for the mixture model is shown to be predictive of experi-
mentally measured permeate ﬂuxes for whey ultraﬁltration for either dead-end or
cross-ﬂow regimes, under conditions suitable for industrial applications. According to
the authors applying the particle size measured in the modeling gives transient
permeate ﬂuxes that agree with the experimental data with an accuracy of 10% for
dead-end ﬁltration and agree with the reported published results for steady-state cross-
ﬂow ﬁltration with an accuracy of 20%. These two discrepancies are close to the
equivalent reproducibility of the experimental results. Importantly, the model ac-
complishes the aforementioned match with experimental results without considering
any fouling-related resistances or using any variables that are not independently
measured from the separation experiment.
2.6.2 Neural networks
The approach of assembling a model from two separate parts is presented in the work of
Krippl et al. [79]. The authors present a model that uses a neural network in the ﬁrst
stage and a classical balance model in the second stage. The hybrid modeling was
related to the classical mechanistic modeling method using stagnant ﬁlm theory. The
hybrid models were able to precisely predict ﬂux and concentration within a broad
range of both process parameters and product-purity relationships for a small number
of training experiments. Considering these two elements in the approach to modeling
was necessary to obtain accurate predictions. The stagnant ﬁlm model was charac-
terized by bigger errors and did not allow for the prediction of contaminant content
because the basis of its calculations was only the main product. In addition, the hybrid
2.6 Simulations and modeling concerned on membrane whey production
37

models created have very good interpolation capabilities and can be used for both
prediction of multi-stage ahead ﬂux and prediction of pollutants over time, which is
seen as an important quality factor in many bioprocesses.
The submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) neural network model was pre-
sented by Yusof et al. [83] and modeled for cheese whey wastewater treatment by Çinar
et al. [84]. The authors state that a typical neural network model cannot successfully be
used to perform control actions predictions and control strategies creation. Accord-
ingly, this work concentrates on formulating the SMBR ﬁltration system process using
the ANN-ARX (nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input) time series simulation
modeling technics, generally referred to as the nonlinear NARX model [85]. Such
models are subsequently contrasted with linear ARX ﬁltration modeling [86], an
approach that is then used in the development of a control strategy for the membrane
ﬁltration process system. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller was tuned
for ﬂux control to provide that process operating is as straightforward as possible for an
industrial membrane bioreactor. There are two single-input single-output PID con-
trollers designed for addressing two different strategies of control. The primary strategy
is to control the permeate stream at the same time observing the behavior of the
transmembrane pressure (TMP). The latter strategy is to control the TMP and observe
the permeate ﬂux. Finally, the simulation as well as actual experimental runs have
been carried out for both these control strategies.
The potential use of artificial neural networks for whey desalination is presented in
Kovács et al. work [87]. A neural network is considered to be part of mathematical
modeling for whey ﬁltration and is referred to as data-driven model. A numerical
workﬂow for the simulation of whey diaﬁltration processes is presented. Both transport
models and actual experimental datasets can be used without modifying the governing
equations. The suggested routine can be used for various batch diaﬁltration ap-
proaches and for multicomponent solute systems. The authors recommended an
empirical design that reduces the possibility of prior experiments to a minimum and
allows us to obtain high-value information from the observed experimental data.
Authors applied statistical models, such as response surface methodology, partial
least-squares regression, and artiﬁcial neural networks tools to transform the raw data
into information that is exploitable. The simulation strategy was veriﬁed on a series of
experimental runs of the process under different diluent usage scenarios. It was found
that there was quite good correspondence among the simulated and measured ﬁltra-
tion datasets.
The newer researches [88] aim to develop a new LSTM-based fouling model to
evaluate ﬁltration efﬁciency and fouling growth. Experiments of ﬁltration were per-
formed to acquire training data of the model under variable water feed and working
conditions. At the same time, the parameters and variables to quantify water quality
variables and real-time optical coherence tomography images need to be prepared as
input data to the LSTM model. While the suggested LSTM model demonstrated
reasonable results under a variety of experimental settings, the proposed model
38
2 Membrane technologies for sports supplementation

continued to exhibit small problems that still remain to be resolved. However, in order
to be used as a general model for realistic real-world scenarios, the deep learning
modeling technique for pollution prediction still needs considerable effort and
continued development. Hence, it is proposed to consider additional operational
scenarios and case studies to construct a more workable model in further research.
2.6.3 Balance approach
A balance approach refers to the mathematical description based on the equations
formulated based on the mass and/or energy balances. Such a typical approach is used
mainly to calculate fluxes and pressure drops and allows estimations of efficiency of
membrane processes.
An equation oriented balance membrane ultrafiltration mathematical model for
the whey filtration process was formulated in [89], and its associated parameters were
quantiﬁed, and the model was statistically veriﬁed. The membrane blocking effect is
included in the model as an auxiliary term, the phenomenon called membrane resis-
tance, in addition to the mass balance equations. Finally, the impact of experimental
conditions is represented by the variables of membrane ﬂux and retention factor. A
parameter ﬁtting estimation task is addressed for the designed model by regressing the
collected experimental results to the equations of the mathematical model. The sta-
tistical properties demonstrate that the proposed model has the potential to be applied
for both control and estimation objectives. A comparison across three separate func-
tions of static membrane resistance reveals that either the simple (polynomial)
approach or the complex (logarithmic-exponential) approach do not achieve statistical
trustworthiness when matched against the exponential static membrane resistance.
Using the model built, a number of simulation tests were conducted to examine the
model under stressed conditions. The initial simulation investigation checks the pre-
dictive performance of the developed model for rapid variations in feedstream con-
centration, whereas the latter shows that the timing approach strategy needs to be
determined based on the operating proﬁle of the pressure. The third simulation run
indicates that given a sequential schedule strategy, the membrane (model) in question
is able to be controlled with high performance, even for varying characteristics. While
the fourth and ﬁfth tests illustrate steady feed and pressure actions, the last test
demonstrates that the model has the ability to be easily applied with varying perfor-
mance characteristics. The simulation research demonstrates the prospective appli-
cation of the membrane model to both optimum performance and scheduling
scenarios.
A standardized model is presented [90] to characterize the time-dependent ﬂux
reduction during extended duration operation of whey UF processes. The model sug-
gested is composed of three exponential decay patterns that account for the three
phases of fouling: concentration polarization, protein deposition, and sediment
2.6 Simulations and modeling concerned on membrane whey production
39

consolidation. Pilot-scale experiments have provided evidence to conﬁrm the occur-
rence of these three phases. The empirical constant model values were estimated from
the experimental data achieved in the whey ultraﬁltration process on the pilot-scale
system. The comparison of the values of the constants in the models evaluated for
different process operating parameters, for example, TMP and feed concentration, can
be used to identify their inﬂuence on the rate of permeate ﬂux decline. Pilot-scale test
setup based experimental data indicate that when proteinaceous sediment aggregation
is prevalent, i.e., after several hours, the impact of TMP and feed concentration on the
permeate ﬂux decline rate is statistically negligible.
The authors conclude that a subsequent advantage of the designed unified model
is the analogous character of the equation representing the fouling dynamics within
the three phases. Besides the permeate flux absolute magnitude, the fouling dynamics
are also able to influence the dynamic response behavior of the whey UF process.
Because the unified model constants are essential functions of process operating pa-
rameters for example TMP, the unified model has the potential to be applied to identify
the attainable efficiency of a regulator’s automatic controls before designing the
regulator. The impact of a long time fouling dynamics upon the attainable efficiency of
automatic regulators is important, considering the operating duration of commercial
membrane processes.
In view of the fact that TMPs and feed concentrations are independent of long-term
fouling dynamics, to express the process dynamics by a time-varying model approach
the convenient approach is to represent model coefficients as time-varying functions of
time. In such a way the transient process model is represented as a transfer function, for
example, the polynomial coefficients in both the numerator and denominator are
defined as time-varying variables. According to and based on this time-dependent
model of process dynamics, variations in attainable controller parameters at different
fouling phases of the process can be examined. The model evaluated could be used to
analyze the effectiveness of automatic regulators when developing and designing the
control systems for the optimized whey ultrafiltration scenario.
2.7 Conclusions
The above examples demonstrate the widespread use of membrane techniques in the
production of sports supplements. Both research work and the already applied tech-
nologies in the industry show that nowadays these processes are mature but there is
still research to be done to improve the efficiency of these processes, mainly by elim-
inating the problem of membrane fouling and the need to remove bacteriophages.
Hence the importance of research and development to improve the filtration perfor-
mance of the membranes, to continuously improve the product quality and the envi-
ronmental sustainability of the processes.

3 Membrane applications in the food industry
Abstract: Current trends in the food industry for the application of membrane tech-
niques are presented. Industrial solutions as well as laboratory research, which can
contribute to the improvement of membrane efficiency and performance in this field,
are widely discussed. Special attention is given to the main food industries related to
dairy, sugar and biotechnology. In addition, the potential of membrane techniques to
assist in the treatment of waste sources arising from food production is highlighted.
Keywords: dairy; fermentation broths; membranes; sugar.
3.1 Introduction
Membrane technology is well established in many areas of industry and everyday life.
The materials presented here as well as numerous reports in the literature, including
those from professional specialist journals, confirm the still dynamic development of
membranes in many areas of industry, also in the food processing. It is assumed that
about 30% of the membranes produced are used in the food industry [1]. As shown in
Figure 3.1, both the purpose of membrane techniques and their application to speciﬁc
food industries are very diverse. It should be noted that the examples given are not
exhaustive of all membrane applications in this area.
It should be noted here that the food industry is a brunch of business with a high
financial turnover which is extremely resistant to both economic and, for example,
pandemic turbulence [2, 3]. Whatever the situation, to provide food is to provide for
people’s basic needs. Hence, food production and processing is a branch of the
economy with high growth potential. On the other hand, more and more attention is
being paid to the quality of food products produced. The society with a growing
awareness of leading a healthy lifestyle expects from food producers products with
preserved taste and nutritional values. It should be emphasized that this trend related
to the rational use of food and its consumption is reﬂected, among others, in the 17 UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [4]. In this plan, which aims at sustainable
global development for present and future generations, point 2 (SDG-2) focuses on food

security and nutrition. It mentions aspects such as aiming for zero hunger, realizing
food security, removing malnutrition in all its forms and promoting sustainable agri-
culture. In addition, paragraph 12 (SDG-12) points to the need for responsible pro-
duction and consumption. Thus, both producers and consumers should focus on
achieving these goals through changes in food production, global nutrition and health
[5]. On the other hand, producers expect the technologies used to be efﬁcient and low-
cost. If the need to adapt to increasingly stringent environmental requirements is taken
into account [6], membrane techniques can be also and are an interesting alternative to
many conventional methods of food production and waste water treatment [7–9].
Especially in food production it is important to maintain sterile production con-
ditions [10], hence the food industry has been a driving force for the development of
non-polymeric membranes such as ceramic ones. These membranes ensure that they
can be sterilized at high temperatures and with a range of chemical reagents [11]. The
introduction of ceramic membranes has, in many cases, allowed a signiﬁcant expan-
sion of the use of these membranes in the food industry.
The aim of this work is to present research directions and applications of mem-
brane techniques in such agro-food industries as sugar production, dairy products and
recovery of valuable components from fermentation broths. Furthermore, the issue of
post-production waste water treatment will be discussed.

3.2 Sugar industry
Despite the existing trend to reduce sugar consumption, this product is widely used by
food manufacturers and consumers (Figure 3.2). The current level of sugar production
worldwide is estimated at 166.2 m t per year, with total annual consumptions world-
wide on the level about 177.8 m t [12]. Of course, depending on the region, the source of
the product may be different, but mainly sugarcane or sugar beet.
In general, the sugar production stage consists of cleaning the harvested crop and
extracting the sugar from the cells to obtain the raw juice. Here, depending on the
source of origin, the sugar is washed out with hot water or pressed out of the cells for
beet and cane, respectively. The next stage is purification and clarification (to about
17–21 °Brix) of the raw juice to the thin juice and its concentration and ﬁnally crys-
tallization. Schematically these processes, depending on the origin of the sugar (cane
or beets), can be illustrated as in Figure 3.3 [13]. Sugar production is one of the most
energy-intensive processes in the food industries, of which water evaporation accounts
for the largest share of energy consumption, approximately 50% [14]. Therefore, novel
solutions with reduced energy requirements are constantly being sought. Membrane
techniques, known for their energy saving advantages, as well as for their ability to
concentrate, are an excellent option. Work in this area appeared as early as the 1980s
and 1990s, mainly on the application of membrane ﬁltration to the puriﬁcation of raw
juice [15, 16].
Figure 3.2: Consumption of sugar in 2020 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/887349/india-
sugar-consumption-volume/).

Membrane processes are especially recommended, as is presented in Figure 3.4, for
sugar juice clariﬁcation as well concentration where the expensive evaporation step
(the conventional technology) is omitted. However, a major limiting factor for the use of
membranes in sugar production is the high osmotic pressure and high viscosity of the
raw juices. In this case, a very interesting alternative to evaporation is membrane
distillation (MD) due to the lower operating temperatures in comparison to the con-
ventional distillation and consequently a reduction in energy consumption. This
makes the method particularly suitable for heat-sensitive foods. As was presented by
Nene and co-workers [17] it is possible to use MD concentration of raw cane-sugar
syrup obtained from the sugar mill directly after Dorr ﬁltration (clariﬁed solution with
20°Brix) using polypropylene membrane. Despite obtaining satisfactory performance
of sugar juice concentration at laboratory and semi-technical scale, there are still some

serious drawbacks limiting the use of membrane distillation technique in industrial
practice [18]. These are mainly temperature polarization and membrane fouling. Both
phenomena signiﬁcantly limit the efﬁciency of the process by decreasing the ﬂux due
to a decrease of the driving force of the process (differences in temperature at the
membrane surface and in bulk phase in case of polarization) and mechanical fouling of
the membrane (decrease in permeability). Therefore it is important to ﬁnd membranes
with long-lasting wetting resistance, hence the proposals for membranes made not
only of polymers. Additionally a pre-treatment is possible in order to remove e.g.
suspended solids. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary to invest in further treatment
processes, such as micro- and ultra-ﬁltration. To solve the problem of membrane
durability, especially of polymeric membranes, besides ceramic membranes, metal
membranes e.g. made of alumina are proposed for sucrose concentration. Base on
vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) process hydrophobic alumina hollow ﬁbre
membranes allow to sucrose concentrate from 10 to 50°Brix.
For the purification of raw sugar juice, membrane filtration processes, including
micro- and ultra-filtration using ceramic membranes, are the most modern solution
both in the laboratory and in pilot plants. As was shown by Hinkova and co-workers
juice treated in MF and NF processes achieved such quality that directs crystallisation
was possible [14]. To avoid the fouling process many authors proposed modiﬁcation of
membrane materials. For example functionalization of ceramic ultraﬁltration mem-
branes by lanthanum phosphate coating allow to sugarcane juice clariﬁcation [19].
Such membrane has got hydrothermal stability, as well as chemical resistance. Also the
combination of UF and NF achieves the desired clariﬁcation, decolouration, and pre-
concentration of raw sugarcane juice targets. Proposition of Leo and co-workers based
on integrated membrane process consisting of a tubular loose UF, a spiral-wound tight
UF and a spiral-wound NF at pilot-plant scale [20]. As was presented by the Authors
such solution allow to obtain about 96.5% reduction of colour and 99.99% of turbidity
with 45 days of stable installation work.
A relatively new proposal for membrane techniques used in practice is forward
osmosis (FO). Some examples are presented in Table 3.1. There are several factors

supporting the use of FO for the concentration of sugar juices or other juices (fruit,
vegetable). First, FO can be an alternative to pressure-based processes including
reverse osmosis (RO). This is particularly important when the osmotic pressure of the
solution is very high (e.g. >80 bar). In this case, the use of classical RO, in which the
operating pressure must be higher than the osmotic pressure, would be very expensive.
The use of lower pressure also results in signiﬁcantly lower energy consumption [21].
On the other hand, it should be noted that the cost of an FO-based plant currently
exceeds the capital expenditure compared to conventional thermal processes. This is
mainly due to the cost of the furnaces themselves. Additionally, studies have also
shown that the fouling problem due to organic contamination in FO is comparable to
NF/RO [22]. However, it should be kept in mind that this is a relatively new technique
and the currently high costs should be signiﬁcantly reduced with the development of
commercial FO membrane production [23]. Such a trend is observed for each of the
membrane techniques used in industrial applications. For example, the now
commonly used RO for desalination water was considered a very expensive technique
in the 1980s.
Numerous patents also point to the possibility of recovering sugar from molasses
using membrane filtration. In US Patent [27] inventors from Tate & Lyle, Inc.

demonstrated the usefulness of nanoﬁltration in process for puriﬁcation of low grade
sugar syrups, such as molasses (composition sucrose and no less than 2% w/w invert
sugars or no less than about 3% w/w embodiments). In this solution NF with
150–300 Da membrane shall be preceded by preliminary puriﬁcation using micro-
ﬁltration or ultraﬁltration. The permeate form these processes could be directly ﬁltrated
in NF, while retentate contains about 50% of colloids, polysaccharides and colour-
forming materials. Optionally, diaﬁltration process can be also used. In NF through
membrane invert sugars permeated, whereas retentate contains sucrose which can be
crystalized. Similar solutions with combination of UN and NF process for production
sucrose from sugar beets and sugarcane are presented in patents [28] and [29],
respectively.
In addition to supporting membrane technology for the direct production of sugar
from raw sugarcane solutions, the extraction of sugars from other sources is an
interesting proposition. An excellent example of this is the recovery of sugars from the
conversion process of lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals and fuels by nano-
filtration [30]. By using NF process to remove sugar and possible hydrolysis degra-
dation products (i.e. acetic acid, furfural, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural), it is possible to
run the biomass hydrolysis process continuously. From the lignocellulosic materials
fermentable sugars for ethanol production can be obtained in acid-hydrolysation
process [31]. In this process, it is necessary to separate these inhibitors from sugars or to
reduce their concentration before the fermentation process. The removal of acetic acid
while thickening the sugar is proposed in this process in contrast to the process above.
The authors compared NF and RO membranes showing a much higher potential of RO
membranes. For this process, a combination of NF modules with three RO modules was
also proposed [32]. After remove the lignin by adsorption using activated carbon,
multistage NF and RO allowed obtaining increase in total sugar concentration from 48
to 227 g/L in NF process (volume reduction factor 5, pH 4.3 and 500 psi) and acid
concentration from 10 to 50 g/L in RO process (pH 4.3 and 500 psi). As presented in
Ghazali and Razak review [33], membrane techniques, especially nanoﬁltration, are a
promising alternative for the detoxiﬁcation and puriﬁcation of lignocellulosic hydro-
lysate from undesirable inhibitors. In conclusion, the authors pointed out that the
efﬁciency and selectivity of the NF process depends mainly on the membrane material
as well as on the process conditions (pressure, temperature, feed concentration and
pH). The problem of membrane fouling was also pointed out.
It is worth emphasising that the use of membranes in the purification and con-
centration of sugarance juice is no longer just laboratory or semi-technical research.
Ready-made solutions are already available on the market. This shows that the labo-
ratory work, which started in the 1980s, was an excellent basis for the industrial
solutions that have already been developed and are still being modified. For example, a
Chinese company Jiangsu Jiuwu Hitech CO., LTD [34] offers a set of ceramic ultraﬁl-
tration and nanoﬁltration membranes (total length: 500–1200 mm, pore size: 500/200/
100/50 nm) for puriﬁcation, concentration and decolouration.

3.3 Dairy industry
Because the dairy industry, like all food industries, requires sterility, membrane
techniques are a perfect fit in these needs. It is assumed that most membranes in the
food industry are used in the dairy industry, mainly for separating components such as
lactose, proteins, fat and salts from milk and its intermediate products [1]. Today
membrane techniques in the food industry are already well-stablished supporting
methods. For example, as early as the 1970s, ultraﬁltration was used in New Zealand to
concentrate whey proteins and produce whey protein concentrates (WPC) [35].
Particular attention should be paid to membrane ﬁltration techniques, including
microﬁltration, MF. These techniques are textbook methods for the membrane sepa-
ration of microorganisms and bacteria. Moreover, the membrane techniques are an
alternative to the classical methods of preserving dairy products, such as pasteuriza-
tion. Very detailed data on the experimental milk ﬁltration results, including process
parameters and properties of the obtained milk fractions, are presented in the paper
[36] and stored in the INRAE public repository (https://www6.inrae.fr/cati-icat-atweb/
Ontologies/Microﬁltration) [37].
MF allows to reduction of bacteria and spore in fresh milk and to production
extended shelf life milk, known as ELS milk [38]. This milk is characterized on the one
hand by the taste of fresh milk, but has a longer shelf life of around 20–25 days. This
is considerably longer than the shelf life of ordinary pasteurized milk, which is around
4–8 days. The use of the microﬁltration process makes it possible to effectively reduce
the number of bacteria as well as ensures stable operating conditions. As was pre-
sented in work [39] using ceramic membranes it is possible to minimalize the amount of
microorganism per millilitre from 160,000 to less than 10, with 20 h working time
without any intermediate cleaning procedure. Authors of citied work also concluded
that the cost of MF process is lower in comparison to the UHT unit in production of ELS
milk. Investment costs: 600,000–1,000,000 EUR for the same capacity 25,000 L/h;
running costs (emerging, cleaning, etc.) 0.1–0.7 ct/L with similar maintenance costs
(25,000 EUR/year). In summary, the total cost of ESL milk production is 0.15–0.4 ct/L
for MF process and 0.9–1.5 ct/L for UHT process. Microﬁltration support in ELS milk
production is already a ﬁrmly established practice in dairy processing companies.
Ready-made ﬁlter sets have been available on the market for several years, for example
SYNELCO LTD Technical and Commercial Company [40], REDA Food Processing Plants
[41], ELIQUO protect [42]. Moreover, in industrial practice microﬁltration is commonly
used to fractionate of milk proteins: casein micelles (as retentate) and serum proteins
(as permeate) [36]. After the MF process retentate is applied to enrich vat milk for cheese
production, while permeate (with the composition serum proteins, lactose and min-
erals) could be used for the production of protein-rich concentrate for infants and
seniors (mainly using ultraﬁltration).
54
3 Membrane applications in the food industry

Bacteria and spore reduction is necessary also in cheese production. Thus cheese
production today cannot do without membrane techniques. An excellent example is
Iranian cheese, which even in the aisle has reference to membrane techniques – Ira-
nian ultraﬁltration Feta cheese. It is the most widely consumed cheese in Iran, made
from bovine milk with 3.8% fat [43, 44]. The milk is retarded to 35% total solids and
then rennet is supplemented. The end product is a soft cheese with a content of 60%
moisture, 16–22% fat, and 1–3% salt. As was presented by Jalilzadeh et al. [45] typical
ultraﬁltration conditions were: membrane with nominal molecular weight cut-off of
20 kg/mol, temperature 50 °C, inlet and outlet pressures of 530 and 170 kPa, respec-
tively. It should be noted that UF is commonly used in the production of other cheeses
as well. Ultraﬁltration, thanks to its ability to remove water, lactose and certain min-
erals from milk, allows concentrated retentate to be obtained. It has thus become
possible to standardise cheese production by uniformity the composition of the milk,
creating a ﬁrmer gel structure. Moreover, by supporting ultraﬁltration, it is possible to
reduce the loss of casein to whey and, overall, to increase the efﬁciency of the process
of cheese production [46]. This method has a long dairy tradition. It was ﬁrst investi-
gated by Maubois, Mocquot and Vassal in the 1960s and was named after its inventors
“MMV process” [47].
In summary, depending on the membrane filtration technique used, other dairy
products can be obtained. A summary of the most important ones is shown in Figures 3.5
and 3.6. As is presentenced in schemas, both UF and MF reserve the possibility to
obtain a widely range of dairy products and their derivatives. Very detailed data on
microﬁltration of milk are available at website [37] a described at the work [36].

In the dairy industry, however, the most common solution is to use different
membrane techniques as a process sequence, as shown in Figure 3.7. Such combinations
allow to obtain several product, for example milk for drink (i.e. ELS milk), concentrated
and powder milk, as well as whey, whey protein concentrate and isolate, lactose. This
shows how technologically important membrane techniques are in the dairy industry.

3 Membrane applications in the food industry

The most important problem when using membranes in lactic acid applications is
their fouling due to the presence of large quantities of both organic and inorganic
foulants. Because skim milk contains high amount of protein, during ultrafiltration
(see Figure 3.5) the concentration polarization layer forms within seconds [48]. More-
over biofouling due to the aggregation of microorganisms is observed [49]. Therefore,
in industrial practice it is necessary to interrupt the ﬁltration process in order to
implement the clean-in-place (CIP) procedure. Numerous sources indicate that the
cleaning process is usually carried out after 2–8 h of operation [1, 50–52]. Conse-
quently, the main focus in improving performance of dairy production is to develop
membranes with antifouling properties. Barclay et al. [1] successfully proposed poly-
zwitterionic antifouling coating of polyethersulfone membranes. However, the authors
pointed out that the stability of the membrane should be improved. Moreover, because
fouling problem is so important, a great deal of research is being conducted into
cleaning methods, including the selection of suitable cleaning agents and process
conditions [51–53]. Additionally, as Rabiller-Baudry et al. work shows [51], the degree
of fouling depends to a large extent on the age of the marina as well as the way it is
used. Here the use of chlorine deserves special attention as it can contribute signiﬁ-
cantly to a faster ageing of membranes. As was noted in work [52] the problem of
fouling could be solved by adjusting appropriate ﬁltration conditions. For example the
ﬁltrate ﬂux of skim milk strongly depends on the temperature, and it is higher at 42 °C in
comparison to 12 °C (probably due to lower ﬁltrate viscosity).
It should be noted that in addition to classical filtration methods, membrane
distillation is also proposed for the dairy industry [54]. Such solution allows obtaining
good separation between protein and lactose, with a relatively high protein content
and low lactose retention. Membrane distillation could be also applied in milk powder
production [55]. In this case, the use of MD is supported by the well-known lower
energy consumption compared to conventional pre-concentration methods before
powder production (reverse osmosis and evaporation). It should be noted here that the
production of milk powder is highly energy intensive and accounts for about 15% of the
total energy consumption in the dairy industry [56]. The same MD method is proposed
also for skim milk and whey processing [57]. Moreover, with the recent development of
forward osmosis, the literature also proposes the use of this technique in dairy pro-
cessing, mainly as a concentration process [58–61] or for treatment of efﬂuents from the
process [62, 63]. For comparison purposes, the paper [59] discusses the differences
between forward osmosis (FO), reverse osmosis (RO) and pressure-assisted forward
osmosis (PAFO) in the concentration of skim milk in the lab scale. The results presented
indicated that intensity of protein fouling increased in the order FO<PAFO<RO, while
critical ﬂuxes for FO and RO were similar (regardless of the nature of pressure – hy-
draulic or osmotic). As the results obtained and described in the literature indicate the
high potential of FO, in addition to laboratory studies, work on a much larger scale can
also be found. Pilot forward osmosis ﬁltration system (maximum volume capacity
250 L, spiral-wound cellulose triacetate membrane with 24 m2 total active surface area

of ﬁltration) was successfully tested in concentration of cheese whey: concentration
factor 2.7, change the total solids content of whey from 6.5 to 18% [61]. In lab scale it is
possible to obtain much higher concentration factor, up to four for sweet whey samples
[60]. As the results of FO application in diary industry are encouraging, a response is
expected from dairy companies. As described, a Fonterra company from New Zealand
is considering replacing UF with FO in milk concentration [64]. This aspect is very
important due to the peculiarities of New Zealand. Due to the relatively low population
density, dairies are usually located at a considerable distance from milk producers.
Thus, increasing the concentration of milk at source signiﬁcantly reduces transport
costs.
3.4 Recovery of valuable components from
fermentation broths
Conversion of organic molecules by fermentation is now a desirable method, and its
implementation particularly relates to the production of antibiotics, enzymes, bio-
ethanol and organic acids. Production sector in which biotechnological processes are
strongly developed is distillery. In the chapter “Membrane techniques in the produc-
tion of beverages”, membrane solutions for dealcoholisation were presented, while
fermentation broths can also be a source of other important components. The bio-
ethanol can be produced from renewable materials such as corn, sorghum, cellulose,
and algae biomass. However, for starch and lignocellulose biomass pre-treatment is a
necessary step to make the carbohydrates in the biomass accessible for conversion. The
production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass requires an additional step to
separate the cellulosic component from hemicelluloses and lignin (e.g. treatment with
water at high temperature and pressure, hydrolysis with ammonia, organosolv pro-
cess). In such form, the biomass can be subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. In the
lignocellulosic biomass, the pre-treatment biomass is hydrolysed into glucose by cel-
lulases, and after that the remaining lignin is separated from the mash and transported
to the high gravity fermentation [65–68]. In this process, accumulated glucose reduces
the activity of β-glucosidases and, consequently, causes the accumulation of cello-
biosis. Moreover, the bioethanol production by cellulose, lignocellulose or starch
fermentation is a process in which various inhibitors create during the pre-treatment
stage, especially at high temperature hydrolysis or after contact with reactive chem-
icals. The amount and the type of inhibitor depends on the used biomass e.g. organic
acids are products of hemicellulose degradation, while glycolaldehyde, furfural, and
hydroxymethylfurfural are formed, when pentose and hexose sugars degrade. The
aromatic compounds (i.e. vanillin, vanillic acid, syringaldehyde and ferulic acid) and
aliphatic carboxylic acids (i.e. acetic, formic and levulinic acids) mainly occur when
lignin degrades. Also, the low concentration of sugars in the pre-hydrolysates and
58
3 Membrane applications in the food industry

hydrolysates may not only reduce the ethanol concentration, but also increase the
operating costs in the subsequent puriﬁcation process. Interestingly, although high
concentrations of furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural strongly inhibit the fermentation
process and limit ethanol production, their low concentrations can improve sugar
bioconversion. In the case of the ethanol fermentation from starch-based biomass,
after liquefaction, the mash is cooled and, if necessary, supplemented with glucoa-
mylases to hydrolyse the dextrin to fermentable sugars. If sufﬁcient sugars are released
during liquefaction, the process does not require pre-sacchariﬁcation. In this conver-
sion, the ethanol inhibitory effect is mainly observed [69, 70]. The use of a preparatory
stage enabling the fermentation process to be carried out makes the bioconversion
following two process paths: separate or simultaneous pre-treatment and fermentation
[65–68, 71–74]. The sequential production system has a greater potential for membrane
systems. This process ﬂow has also the great advantage that both hydrolysis and
fermentation can be optimized independently, while the inhibitory effect of the by-
products is easily eliminated when the processes work together.
Microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are the most
often tested membrane systems for detoxification of hydrolysates and concentration of
sugar due to their unique ability to separate and purify process streams. The nano-
filtration technique was tested for their ability to separate monosaccharides from
furfural [75]. Earlier studies also indicated that nanoﬁltration technology can effec-
tively concentrate sugars in the hydrolysates. Liu et al. [76] applied membrane with a
molecular weight cut-off of 100 g/mol. In addition, to the concentration of sugars and
polysaccharides, the removal of inhibitory compounds such as furfural, acetic acid,
methanol, and formic acid from the sugar stream was carried out. Sjöman et al. [77]
tested membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 150–300 g/mol for xylose sepa-
ration from glucose in different hemicellulose hydrolysates. Moreover, the results
indicated that using the membranes glucose and other hexoses were retained more
than the pentose and xylose. Weng et al. also tested the Desal-5 DK NF membrane and
they showed that at the optimum temperature the membrane could effective concen-
trate sugars in the hydrolysate [78]. Nguyen et al. [79] also showed that nanoﬁltration
membranes are more suitable for detoxiﬁcation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates than
reverse osmosis membranes. The semi-aromatic piperazine amide type membranes
produced by Dow FilmTec and DK were particularly effective in detoxiﬁcation,
exhibited high sugar rejection and inhibitors carryover up to 80%. For example using
NF270-2540 module the rejection of glucose, xylose and arabinose was 97, 87 and 92%,
respectively. This module gave also high transmission of formic acid (90%), acetic acid
(88%), furfural 98%, hydroxymethylfurfural (96%) and vanillin in 89%. The research
has also shown that the hydrophilicity of sugars is partly responsible for their rejection,
and the hydrophobicity for the aromatics transmission. Nguyen et al. also tested RO
membrane (SUL-G10), which revealed higher sugar rejection of 99% but inhibitor
removal was lower than expected (formic acid in 55%, acetic acid in 50%, furfural in
55%, hydroxymethylfurfural in 26% and vanillin in 16%) [79]. Further works aimed at
3.4 Recovery of valuable components from fermentation broths
59

pre-industrial tests [80]. The tests have shown that the NF270-2540 membrane allowed
satisfactory glucose rejection but less detoxiﬁcation, e.g. vanillin passed up to 15%
more than in preliminary tests. Diaﬁltration, regardless of the type of the tested
membrane, allowed reducing the concentration of inhibitors below the critical level.
The fermentation products conﬁrmed that the overall glucose and xylose consumption
rate in the diaﬁltered retentate was consistent with the process assumptions.
Conversely, the conversion of glucose to ethanol was much more efﬁcient than indi-
cated by preliminary experiments. The tests have shown that the NF270-2540 mem-
brane allowed satisfactory glucose rejection but less detoxiﬁcation, e.g. vanillin passed
up to 15% more than in preliminary tests. These studies were carried out using the pilot
plant which scheme is illustrated on Figure 3.8. In another tests commercial NF (Desal-5

DK and Alfa Laval-NF) and RO (RO98pHt and RO99) membranes were considered for
the separation furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural from hydrolysate solutions con-
taining also glucose and xylose during sugar concentration process [81]. These results
indicated that for removal of furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural signiﬁcantly better
nanoﬁltration compared to reverse osmosis was found. However, sugar loss was much
higher during NF, which is unacceptable due to the low sugar concentration in the
hydroxylates. The comparable results Lyu et al. obtained using the two-stage nano-
ﬁltration process to fractionate hydrolysates into glucose concentrate, monophenols
and cyclopentenones concentrate, and acetic acid permeate [82]. Microﬁltration is not a
recommended technique for such system; however it can be used as pre-treatments
before nanoﬁltration process to increase the separation performance of sugars from
inhibitors [83]. Another option is forward osmosis, however, this type membrane was
more adequate for concentration of the sugars than the NF membrane but less efﬁcient
for inhibitors [84]. Qi et al. [85] demonstrated the feasibility of recycling cellulase and
concentrating glucose from lignocellulosic hydrolysate by a two-stage membrane
process with combination of UF and NF. It was indicated that recycling of cellulase by
ultraﬁltration could reduce the costs of enzymatic hydrolysis of biomass, while the use
of nanoﬁltration immediately after this stage to concentrate sugars could effectively
improve the fermentation efﬁciency.
Membrane distillation has also been used to concentrate sugar solutions and
remove inhibitors. The rejection of sugar can almost achieve 100%, also the furfural
can be removed completely [86]. However the most interesting results obtained using
vacuum membrane distillation (VMD). This technique has higher rejection for non-
volatile components and can be carried out at low temperature; therefore it was tested
for the glucose rejection [87]. In the case of acetic acid and furfural as temperature
increased to 70 °C, the removal with VMD increased to 76 and 96%, respectively [88]. A
more environmentally friendly membrane technique is pervaporation. Energy con-
sumption for pervaporation was at least 70% lower than for classical distillation. This
technique is characterized by high detoxiﬁcation property. For example, the poly-
dimethylsiloxane membrane with ﬂux of 3223 g/m2h allowed to achieve permeate with
concentration of furfural 62.4 wt% [89]. In another study Cai et al. [90] implemented
polydimethylsiloxane membrane for furfural removal from sweet sorghum hydrolysate
pre-treated with dilute acetic acid. The process was quite effective, at 65 °C furfural is
removed with ﬂux of 1057 g/m2h and with selectivity of 66, while at 37 °C, the selectivity
was 39 and the furfural ﬂux reached value of 116 g/m2h. Finally, the 6.5 h pervaporation
led to the decrease in the furfural concentration from 10.4 to 0.6 g/L, and the permeate
concentration reached 138 g/L. The separation of toxic components such as phenols
and furfural from biomass hydrolysates via pervaporation was also studied by Ghosh
et al. [91]. However, in the case of furfural the modiﬁed polyurethaneurea membrane
was found as a selective but with average efﬁciency material (selectivity 284 with ﬂux of
41.5
g/m2h).
In
another
study
the
ultraﬁltration
with
vinyl-modiﬁed
poly-
dimethylsiloxane membrane at 65 °C exhibited a furfural ﬂux of 738 g/m2h and
3.4 Recovery of valuable components from fermentation broths
61

separation factor of 49 [92]. In order to improve the separation efﬁciency, another
technique was proposed which was a compilation of gas stripping and vapour
permeation (GSVP). In this the polydimethylsiloxane membrane was found to achieve
not only very high permeate concentration (71 wt%) and furfural ﬂux of 4.1 × 103 g/m2h,
but also separation index 2 × 105. Moreover, GSVP is less energy-consuming than
PV [93].
After fermentation, bioethanol can be separated from the fermentation broth by
various methods. Among the membrane technologies, pervaporation was most often
studied for the separation, purification and dehydration of ethanol [94, 95]. Moreover,
it has been shown that pervaporation with high selectivity in the water–ethanol system
and effective solvent dewatering can signiﬁcantly reduce the costs of bioethanol pro-
duction. The selectivity and production cost of the membrane depend on its type. In the
separation of ethanol–water azeotrope, a low cost hydrophobic membrane (polymeric)
leads to obtain ethanol permeate, while hydrophilic membrane (e.g. ceramic) allows
for selective water penetration [96]. Kang et al. [97] compared the pervaporation pro-
cesses with molecular sieves and with hydrophilic PV membrane (e.g. BW30XLE, Dow
Filmtec). The results showed that molecular sieves with a high potential for the pro-
duction of anhydrous ethanol (>99.5%), can be successfully replaced by the membrane
system saving 0.5 kg steam/kg ethanol. The expected puriﬁcation was achieved at a
feed temperature of 65 °C, permeate ﬂow of 3002 kg/h and a membrane unit of 100 m2.
The example of the bioconversion process in which the concentrated ethanol was
purified by pervaporation is illustrated on Figure 3.9 [98]. The analysis of the energy

consumption of the process and its environmental impact showed that the use of
pervaporation meets the expectations in both aspects. It can be seen that in this process
the corn stover feed is ﬁrst treated at 158 °C with diluted sulphuric acid to convert
hemicellulose to the fermentable sugars. After separation of insoluble solids, the feed
is then transported to the detoxiﬁcation stage. Here the inhibitors such as furfural and
5-hydroxymethyl furfural are removed in 92–97% using activated carbon. The com-
pound feed is then treated with an enzyme to convert the cellulose into fermentable
sugars. The obtained hydrolysates with the fermentable sugars are then subjected to
fermentation tank. After this step, the fermentation broth is ﬁltered through a bed of
activated carbon to remove suspended solids. Then, ﬂash operation is applied to
remove CO2 from the ethanol-CO2 phase (mixture having a speciﬁc boiling point and
vapour pressure). Then the liquid product is sent to the distillation column to
concentrate the ethanol to the azeotrope level, and dehydration is achieved by per-
vaporation [98].
Figure 3.10 shows an example of a bioethanol production using starch-base biomass
with membrane modules [99]. Microﬁltration and ultra- or nano-ﬁltration modules,
also in combination with a decanter, effectively clean the raw material after enzymatic
hydrolysis and before fermentation. The combination of nanoﬁltration and reverse

osmosis system can be used to concentrate sugars prior to fermentation. As mentioned
above, it is very important to eliminate the inhibitory effect of ethanol, and here the
membrane processes ﬁnd an effective solution. The appropriate module enables the
continuous removal of ethanol from the fermenter, thus reducing the inhibition of the
yeast product by ethanol.
The membrane unit can either be immersed directly in the fermenter or operated in
a side stream (bleed stream). The efficiency of the membrane process can also be
further improved by using a so-called membrane cascade, for example by using
microfiltration as a pre-treatment step upstream of the hydrophobic pervaporation
unit. Wangpor et al. [100] showed cascade module systems for separating ethanol from
fermentation
broth.
The
ﬁrst
module
was
microﬁltration
(membrane
model
M-M1812PS20), from which the permeate solution with a transmembrane pressure of
2 bar was transported to the nanoﬁltration module with transmembrane M-N1812A9,
where ethanol was recovered at a pressure of 6 bar. A total reducing sugar rejection was
also achieved; however, puriﬁcation on level 92% required pressure of 5 bar. Another
approach to reduce the inhibition of ethanol is performing the conversion process in a
very high gravity fermenter (fermentation at concentration of sugars >250 g/L) are
loaded into the fermenter when compared to classical fermentation. In this type of
fermenter, pervaporation effectively lowers the ethanol concentration to a safe level
(below the inhibition threshold limit of about 12 vol%). After exiting the fermenter by
the ethanol rich stream and pre-concentration and pre-puriﬁcation, the ethanol con-
centration is further increased by distillation of membrane technique such as perva-
poration. After exiting the fermenter, the ethanol-rich stream is pre-treated (partially
concentrated and puriﬁed), and next its concentration is increased by classical
distillation and the ﬁnal dehydration is achieved pervaporation.
Pervaporation coupled with laccase treatment to get well detoxification efficiency
was also proposed as a promising way to industrial production of bio-butanol and
furfural from sweet sorghum bagasse hydrolysate [101]. In the proposed fermentation
and puriﬁcation system furfural in 138 g/L and butanol in 202 g/L were separated.
Generally, the production of biobutanol by acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermenta-
tion using Clostridium species (e.g. Clostridium acetobutylicum), is one of the least
developed bioconversion methods [102–104]. However, several drawbacks still detract
from the economic feasibility of this process, e.g. the high cost of feedstock, low butanol
efﬁciency, and toxicity of the product [105, 106]. The ABE fermentation is a complex
metabolic process with a large network of metabolic reactions; therefore the newest
separation solutions are developed at each stage of the process. Furthermore, previous
analysis of bioethanol production indicates that the use of membrane techniques has the
greatest justiﬁcation. Considering pervaporation and butanol recovery a ceramic hol-
low ﬁbre supported polydimethylsiloxane composite membrane was found as efﬁcient
material with ﬂux of 1.3 × 103 g/m2h and separation factor of 43 [107]. Other membranes
were applied to recover solvents from dilute aqueous solution. Moreover the further
studies indicated that the optimized module consisting of seven bundles of HF
64
3 Membrane applications in the food industry

membranes (560 m2/m3) revealed ideal ﬁltration properties and stability in 2 h continues
test at fermentation conditions (separation factor for butanol, acetone and ethanol was
22, 29 and 6, respectively, F = 1000 g/m2h) [108]. In another process poly-
dimethylsiloxane membrane was used, revealing its butanol productivity (0.21 g/Lh)
with butanol concentration in permeate of 71 g/L and selectivity of 10.3 [109]. Coupling
pervaporation using silicalite-1 ﬁlled poly(dimethylsiloxane)-polyacrylonitrile with real
fermentationprocessresulted inareassimilationoftheproducedacid, aswellasahigher
total yield (0.37 g/g), which ultimately led to condensate containing mixture of solvents
(89–160 g/L ABE) [110]. Researchers also tested a two-stage gas stripping-pervaporation
process integral element in the ABE process. It was shown that using the highly hy-
drophobic carbon nanotubes ﬁlled polydimethylsiloxane membrane the fermentation
process resulted in the high selectivity towards butanol and simultaneously with low
selectivity towards other solvents [111]. It was also indicated that the butanol and total
ﬂuxes, as well as selectivity of the pervaporation step strictly dependent on the butanol
and acetone concentrations in the retentate. As ethanol had a low diffusivity through the
membrane, its ﬂux was stable throughout the PV process (∼15 g/m2h). In the case of
butanol and acetone, the reduction of ﬂuxes caused the water ﬂux to increase to a level
signiﬁcantly deteriorating the selectivity. Knozowska et al. presented both micro-
ﬁltration and vacuum pervaporation as support for the fermentation process. The results
showed that dehydration using polymeric or ceramic membranes (Pervap®4060, Per-
vap®4100, PEBAX, POMS) gave 80 wt% of butanol. While in the dehydrating step the
permeate contains more than 90 wt% water and 10 wt% of the mixture of all solvents
produced in the process. Higher puriﬁcation of butanol was possible due to hydrophobic
pervaporation [112].
Biorefineries not only convert biomass into biofuels but also into starting chem-
icals such as organic acids (e.g. fumaric, succinic, and malic acids can replace the
synthetic maleic anhydride). Multi-stage separation and purification processes are
often necessary to obtain a marketable product. Therefore the selection of the most
appropriate techniques depends mainly on various parameters such as the concen-
tration of the desired product, its form and the composition of the fermented stream. In
the form of salt, organic acids can be recovered using a narrow group of methods, in
which membrane processes are effective in reducing the number of recovery steps, e.g.
by eliminating the neutralization stage. The organic acid salt produced in the
fermentation broth usually is in concentration of 1–15%, so conventional electrodial-
ysis (ED) is often used to make mixture more concentrated [113]. Compared to con-
ventional processes, ED is a more economical technique as it consumes less energy and
does not require the use of a diluent. However, this method is not proposed as a single
method due to the low purity of the isolated product [114]. To improve the puriﬁcation
efﬁciency of ED, several investigators either compiled the ED with another method or
used a new method that was a modiﬁcation of ED (e.g. electrometathesis [EMT], electro-
ions substitution [EIS], electro-electrodialysis [EED], bipolar membrane electrodialysis
[BMED]). Using ED large molecules and solutes with opposite charge or no charge at all
3.4 Recovery of valuable components from fermentation broths
65

are retained, but using a bipolar membrane, calcium salts, magnesium and unreacted
glucose can be recycled to the fermentation process. The bipolar membrane electro-
dialysis method was tested to recover citric [115, 116], galacturonic [117], gluconic [118],
lactic [119], malic [120], succinic [121], xylonic [122], and salicylic acids [123, 124] from
fermented broth. An example is recovery of L-malic acid from the real waste solution
prepared from the ﬁnal concentrate of various fermentation batches. In this separation
process a two-stage electrodialysis consisting modules ED and BMED was tested [120].
It was shown that the two-step process increased the purity of malic acid almost
eightfold. The ED module allows increasing the concentration of organic acids and
reduces the amount of mineral salts, while the MBED module can increase the con-
centration of malic acid even to the expected concentration of 300 g/L. The results also
showed that the speciﬁc energy consumption was closely related to the presence of
anionic impurities in the feed. This conﬁrmed the legitimacy of using the ED module as
the ﬁrst puriﬁcation step. Unfortunately, experiments on real fermentation wastes
showed much higher energy consumption than obtained for model solutions (1.9 kWh/
kg instead of 1.3 kWh/kg), which conﬁrmed that the presence of organic and mineral
anionic impurities of feed solutions has a decisive inﬂuence on the energy consump-
tion of the process. Module BMED was also tested as two-electrode compartment with
cationic or anionic ED membrane, as well as the three-module system arranged bipolar,
cation exchange, and anion exchange membranes. As expected, the use of the three-
modular system resulted in the production of both NaOH and organic acid with a high
degree of puriﬁcation. For instance, the results obtained for lactate recovery from
fermentation broth using the three-electrode module indicated the 69.5% efﬁciency of
the process (current density – 40 mA/cm2) and production NaOH and lactic acid
streams with net end concentration 1.3 and 1.5 mol/L, respectively [125–127]. Electro-
dialysis with bipolar membrane has been also tested for protein, amino-acids and
phospholipids [128–136]. Especially important is high protein recovery yield and
possibility of fractionation of soybean proteins [129, 133, 137, 138]. In the case of amino-
acids, the electrodialysis with alternating cation-exchange and bipolar membranes
were suggested to a ﬁnal stage in the industrial synthesis e.g. in the production of high-
purity methionine through the hydantoin pathway (efﬁciency 75% at a current density
of 150 A/m2) [129–132]. BMED was ale proposed for simultaneous methionine recovery
and capturing CO2 [128]. On industrial scale, conventional electrodialysis is used in the
γ-aminobutyric acid production. In this process the used membrane enabled for
removal of electrolyte in 99% and the amino acid loss below 3%, while the cumulative
energy consumption for dry γ-aminobutyric was less than 500 kWh/t of the product
[139]. Electro-electrodialysis (EED) is another method that, thanks to the ion exchange
membrane and water splitting into H2 and O2, enables the conversion of carboxylates
into the appropriate acid forms. This method was applied for the production of formic
acid with a current efﬁciency of more than 100% [140]. In this process the formate ions
pass through the anion exchange membrane to the electrolyte sphere where they
contact the anodic H+. EED was also proposed to remove tartaric [141], lactic [142], citric
66

[143], and acetic acids [144]. In order to improve the efﬁciency of the electric current at a
higher concentration, consider the much larger difference between acid content in the
feed, and in the concentrated product. Then this method is economically proﬁtable.
The latest reports also indicated the EDI technique, which takes full advantage of the
ion exchange and classical electrodialysis processes. The EDI module in its design
includes diluted compartments, concentrated compartments and electrodes. The
diluted space is an ion exchange resin which supports the transport of ionic compo-
nents towards the ion exchange membranes under the inﬂuence of direct current force.
EDI module can be treated as an ion exchange column with continuous regeneration,
which enables complete deionization of the feed solution (effect commonly used in
water puriﬁcation) [145]. EDI was tested for the recovery of citric acid, lactic acid and
amino acids [139, 146–150]. However, only for citric acid the EDI was tested on pilot
scale (see Table 3.2) [148].

3.4 Recovery of valuable components from fermentation broths
67

A thermo-driven membrane process such as pervaporation is another technique
that can separate organic compounds from fermentation broth [151]. This technique
competes with azeotropic distillation, which, as a result of the addition of an acid
dehydration component, generates operational and environmental problems. The
separation of azeotropic mixture such as acetic acid-water with pervaporation is also
very energy-intensive. Unfortunately only a narrow group of membranes have been
proposed for the dewatering of pre-treated feed solution, and much less for the sepa-
ration of anhydrous acid from the fermentation broth. However, those, that were
proposed showed low selectivity and can be used in the ﬁnal puriﬁcation step [151, 152].
Simulations showed that in a hybrid system consisting of a pervaporation module

3 Membrane applications in the food industry

the results of the water–acetic acid separation are the most promising [152]. Other
membrane methods such as microﬁltration (MF), ultraﬁltration (UF) and nanoﬁltration
(NF) are often used as a pretreatment process e.g. UF is used for the separation of cell-
debris and proteins as a ﬁrst step, while NF is used to concentrate the permeates
generated in UF module.
3.5 Conclusions
The presented above considerations indicate the high application potential of mem-
brane techniques in the food industry. In addition to the already widely used com-
mercial solutions, new solutions are still being sought to improve process efficiency
and effectiveness. Modifications of already used membrane techniques are proposed,
mainly by modification of membrane material, as well as the application of well-known
lab-scale membrane techniques. Alternative solutions, although so far mainly tested
on a small scale, are an interesting proposal and can support the development of the
food industry.

4 Membrane techniques in the production of
beverages
Abstract: The most important developments in membrane techniques used in the
beverage industry are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on the production of
fruit and vegetable juices and nonalcoholic drinks, including beer and wine. This
choice was dictated by the observed consumer trends, who increasingly appreciate
healthy food and its taste qualities.
Keywords: beverage; brewing process; clarification; dealcoholization; juice;

4.1 Introduction
For years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been highlighting lifestyle as a
determinant of human health, including diet, alcohol consumption, lack of physical
activity, or smoking [1–3]. This began in 2004 with the issuance of “Global Strategy on
Diet, Physical Activity, and Health” [4]. The strategy developed involved, among other
things, increased awareness as well as a better understanding of the impact of diet and
physical activity on human health. Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between
quality of diet and number of deaths [5]. This objective appears to have been partially
achieved. For example, according to research from 1999 to 2016, the diet quality of US
youth had been improving slightly, although more than half were still eating low-
quality food [6]. In work of Orr et al. [7] indicated, based on data from 1999 to 2014, that
diet quality of US adults also has increased over the years. At the same time, the results
also indicate an increasing disparity in the quality of food consumed between people
with high and low socioeconomic status. Moreover, observing global trends based on a
Google search in the years 2004–2019, one can see the great popularity of various types
of diets, in the order veganism, vegetarianism, gluten-free, low-carbohydrate, keto-
genic, Atkins, Paleolithic, low-fat, South Beach, high-protein diets [8]. Interestingly,
interest in most diets falls in December but rises markedly in January, probably as part
of New Year’s resolutions. Current trends in nutritional consumption have emphasized
reducing meat intake and increasing consumption of plant-based foods as a dietary

strategy, with both health and environmental proﬁts [9, 10]. Thus, in addition to health
issues [11, 12], this trend also results from concern for the environment (so-called
sustainable consumption) [13, 14].
In today’s increasingly diet-conscious society, fruit and vegetable drinks, as well
as those that do not contain alcohol, are becoming increasingly popular. This is no
longer an isolated trend, but a general tendency, that helps improve dietary habits and
lifestyle. Just take a look at the supermarket shelves. The range actually includes fruit
and vegetable juices, but also smoothies, fruit cocktails etc. [15, 16]. On the other hand,
low-alcoholic or nonalcoholic wine and especially beer is becoming an interesting
alternative for many consumers [17]. Moreover, market analysis indicates that the
global fruit and vegetable processing market is on the rise. According to the valuation,
it was at USD 230.96 Billion in 2016 with a projection of USD 346.05 Billion by 2022 [18].
This trend would not have been possible without the use of membrane techniques
[19]. In fact, it can be said that membranes have accompanied beverage production
since the time of the Egyptians. This is the ﬁrst documented example of the use of
simple ceramic membranes for wine clariﬁcation [20]. And although the real devel-
opment of membrane techniques was deﬁnitely in the second half of the twentieth
century, it is worth keeping in mind their thousand year old tradition. Of course, for
industrial applications, various parameters should be taken into account, such as
technological, economic, and environmental ones. Thus such parameters as permeate
ﬂux, yields, and rejections have to be considered and evaluated.
The aim of this study is to introduce the reader to the latest trends in the beverage
production with the membrane support, both in terms of innovative developments on
the laboratory scale and also in the industrial one.
4.2 Juice
A typical procedure for obtaining fruit and vegetable juices is illustrated in Figure 4.1.
Membrane techniques are increasingly being used in several stages, such as clariﬁcation,
concentration, and pasteurization. They are displacing classical methods such as, for
example clariﬁcation using membrane ﬁltration instead of long time sedimentation. In
addition, membranes can support beverage production by extracting valuable com-
pounds,regulatingsugarlevels,andstabilizingpH.Signiﬁcantly,theproductionofjuices
using membrane technology produces high-quality, additive-free juice with a natural,
fresh taste. The main progress and achievements in this ﬁeld will be discussed below.
4.2.1 Clarification
Generally, after grinding and crushing, the removal of suspended particles from
juices (i.e., pectin, starch, and cells from the juice) is essential, especially for the
80
4 Membrane techniques in the production of beverages

production of clear beverages (cold teas, natural aromatic waters, and alcoholic
beverages), pastries (translucent fruit sauce and natural essences), and candies
(melting products) [16]. In this situation, proposing membrane ﬁltration, including
ultraﬁltration (UF) and microﬁltration (MF), are among the ﬁrst choices (from the late
1970s in the industry applications). Depending on the membrane type, in particular
the pore size and the associated molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) parameter, it is
possible to retain particles of a deﬁned size. Membrane ﬁltration processes allow the
separation of juice components without the support of additional substances or heat
application. The juice is separated into the desired permeate stream, which contains
the components that have permeated the membrane, i.e., low molecular compounds
such as sucrose, acids, salts, aroma, and ﬂavor compounds, and the concentrated
pulp (retentate). In addition, there are no spoilage microorganisms in the permeate,
which makes it stable and therefore the juice is sterilized at the same time as
being clariﬁed. In this process, mainly UF and MF techniques are applied with
different types of membranes. Industrial solutions use both polymeric membranes
(i.e., cellulose acetate [21, 22], polyethersulfone [23], polypropylene, polysulfone [23,
24], polytetraﬂuoroethylene, polyacrylonitryle [25, 26] and poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride)
[27, 28], and the more robust ceramic membranes [29–31]). However, in the case of
ceramic membranes, it should be noted that the durability of these membranes
translates into a much higher cost of their production, which is about 4.5 times more
expensive (per square meter) compared to polymeric membranes [32]. In terms of

solutions,tubular[29,33,34],capillarymembranes,mainlyHollowﬁber[25,35,36],aswell
as ﬂat conﬁgurations [21, 23, 27] are offered. A detailed analysis of the conditions under
which the clariﬁcation process with membrane is carried out is given in paper [37]. The
authors have demonstrated, on the basis of about 50 process data, that the UF and MF are
carried out over a range of transmembrane pressures TMP: 0.2–10.4 MPa, temperature:
20–55 °C (mainly 20–25 °C), feed ﬂowrate: 1–800 L/h.
Membrane processes are an alternative to traditional juice clarification methods,
such as enzymatic treatment, cooling, flocculation (gelatin, silica sol, bentonite, and
diatomaceous), decanting, and filtration. The disadvantages of these methods are that
they often require the use of additives and, in many cases; they are labor- and time-
consuming processes. On the other hand, one of the main problems with using
membranes for juice clarification is the low permeate flux achieved resulting mainly
from fouling. Here it should be noted that the fouling depends intensely on the age and
varieties of the fruit used. The more flocculent the juice components, the higher the
fouling is observed. Therefore, finding the optimal process conditions is crucial.
Of course, the simplest solution would be to increase the membrane pore size (MWCO,
cut-off) but of course the consequence of this would be to reduce the retention of
undesirable components. On the other hand, an obvious solution is also to clean the
membrane surface during the process, e.g., by backward flushing and forcing a
turbulent stream e.g., by pulsing (physical cleaning) or by using chemicals (chemical
cleaning) [38]. Commercially available membranes are also in the form of dynamic ﬁlter
modules, which have the ability to produce high shear rates on the membrane by using
special rotating discs, or by rotating or vibrating the membranes [39]. Since this is only
a temporary solution and requires stopping the plant or shutting down part of
the membrane modules, many solutions propose to be supported by additional tech-
niques. Different solutions are proposed, for example enzymatic pretreatment
(as degradation of pectic substances by pectinases) [40–42] and adsorption [43] or
superior ﬁlter-aid using bentonite [44], increase of temperature [21]. It should be noted
that pretreatment procedures combined with ﬁltration may result in a reduction of
important juice components such as anthocyanins. Moreover, the removal of pectin
and protein, which are natural components of juice, avoids the growth of bacteria and
consequent spoilage of the juice [45]. For example, the work [42] showed a reduction of
about 50% anthocyanin concertation in the case of depectinization by pectinolytic
enzymes. On the other hand, the process signiﬁcantly shortened the duration of UF, by
about 20 min. From a practical point of view, in industrial solutions, this can be an
excellent compromise between production time and nutrient loss in juices. Therefore
lot of coupled depectinization of juices and subsequent membrane separation pro-
cesses are proposed. Some examples are presented in Table 4.1. What is important
in combining membrane ﬁltration with enzyme applications besides the obvious
advantages of improving juice clariﬁcation and increasing the permeate ﬂux obtained
is that the amount of enzymes for pretreatment can be reduced and can be recycled and
reused. It has been observed that even after pretreatment with enzymes, pectin
82
4 Membrane techniques in the production of beverages

residues are the main factor that limits permeate ﬂux during juice clariﬁcation [46]. An
interesting comparison of the pretreatment steps is summarized in the paper [47].
Domingues et al. indicated that of the three methods (centrifugation, enzymatic
liquefaction, and chitosan coagulation), the last method was the best, providing the
highest permeate ﬂux. It should be noted, however, that the pretreatment method had
no effect on the characteristics of the permeate obtained in the NF process.
Since the issue of fouling, although important, is already mastered in industrial
practice (e.g., backwashing, appropriate selection of membrane material, etc.) it can be
assumed that membrane filtration is a continuous and automated process. As a result,
considerable labor savings are possible. According to literature reports [32], a plant for
processing 20 t of fruit concentrate could save up to 6.3% of raw material, 93.5% of
support material, 4.2% of energy, and 16.6% of labor input. This is due to several
aspects. The use of membrane ﬁltration does not require additives such as clariﬁcation
or ﬁltration media (e.g., diatomaceous earth and bentonite). In addition, the absence of
these supplementary means that no associated waste is generated.
Among the commercial juice clarification solutions the PVDF UF membranes with
a cut-off of 200,000 Da (FPA20 or FPS20) and MF membranes with a nominal

separation of 0.2 μm (LM02) for dark juice and wine clariﬁcation could be mentioned,
from PCI membranes. Based on this solution among others, there is a plant for the
production of black currant juice [50]. Also Alfa Laval proposed UF membrane for
industrial juice clariﬁcation [51].
4.2.2 Concentration
As transport and storage costs are one of the components that determine the final cost
of a product, it is common industrial practice to concentrate juices. This concentration
can be done for example by vacuum evaporation or with the support of membrane
techniques. The biggest disadvantage of thermal evaporation is often the problem of
maintaining juice quality in terms of flavor and color due to the Maillard reaction. In
addition, because the process requires a high temperature of around 90 °C it involves a
large amount of energy. Membrane processes that normally require mild low-
temperature conditions should therefore consume less energy retain ﬂavor and color,
nutrients, and bioactive compounds. It would seem that reverse osmosis (RO) would be
the best solution here. Unfortunately, in this case, the issue of fouling and lack of
durability practically rules out this technique in industrial practice. Therefore, among
the membrane techniques (RO), nanoﬁltration (NF),UF, MF and membrane distillation
(MD), and osmotic distillation (OD) are used to concentrate beverages. The most
popular one, which has been used in industry for about 40 years, is RO [52]. Industrial
RO membranes for juice concentration offer i.e., Alfa Laval Company [51]. Due to its
frequent use for desalinating water, it is a mature technique and manufacturers offer
many interesting solutions. On the other hand, a serious limitation is that the ﬁnal
concentration in RO is limited to about 30°Brix. Hence, RO is often used as pre-
concentration step and support for other methods [53, 54]. NF, on the other hand,
thanks to the process being carried out at a much lower pressure, allows energy
consumption to be reduced by around 21%, while at the same time the taste qualities,
that are sometimes impaired by high pressures, are often better [37]. Among membrane
processes, forward osmosis (FO) is also mentioned. Its use is supported by low energy
consumption, low hydraulic pressure, high water recovery, and low tendency to
fouling. These gentle operating conditions make it possible to maintain the taste and
nutritional qualities of the juice during concentration [55, 56]. A process similar to
traditional evaporation, MD can also be used for juice concentration. The advantage
is that the process can be carried out at atmospheric pressure and a much lower
temperature than the boiling point, resulting in lower energy consumption and pres-
ervation of valuable juice components during the process. This method, as well as RO,
has been known and proposed in the food industry for more than 30 years [57]. Another
solution, prosed in literature is OD. In this case, despite the many advantages of the
process in terms of low-temperature and low pressure, and the consequent mainte-
nance of the initial organoleptic and sensory characteristics and the high level of
84
4 Membrane techniques in the production of beverages

soluble solids, it often requires preliminary treatment (clariﬁcation). Thus, OD process
is usually preceded by MF or UF processes [58]. It is worth quoting here a very inter-
esting overview of the costs of the OD process in comparison to the costs of evaporation
provided by Roozitalab and co-workers [59]. The analysis indicates that both processes
are economically viable, but due to the much higher equipment costs for OD (74,446$–
34,499$.) the overall proﬁt would be lower compared to evaporation (internal rate of
return on investment (IRR): OD – 66.47%, Ev – 68.09%). In addition, a combination of
OD and MD [60], so-called osmotic membrane distillation (OMD), is proposed as more
effective [61] (see Table 4.2).
4.2.3 Sterilization
Sterilization of beverages is a key element when preparing products for sale. The
removal of microorganisms maintains product safety and increases shelf life. While
thermal sterilization techniques can be used, as typical in the home, industry is
increasingly turning to nonthermal methods. This is because thermal sterilization
can lead to chemical changes. Therefore, in line with its basic application, MF is
proposed in this case. What is more, this method can and is used in the food industry
in many stages, including clarification and sterilization at the same time without
changing the juice components as was presented for apple juice [74] or mulberry juice
[75] using UF ceramic membranes. An excellent example is also the use of membranes
in the removal of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris (thermophilic and acidophilic bacilli
species) from apple juice [76]. This microorganism causes a decline in quality of apple
juice and show a high resistance to classical sterilization procedures. The antibac-
terial capacity of the membrane was achieved by grafting nisin as a natural food
preservative onto the PVDF MF membrane via a multistage surface modiﬁcation.
4.2.4 Supporting
The support of membrane techniques in beverage production, in addition to the pro-
cesses mentioned above, is associated with a number of juice enrichment and stabi-
lization methods. For example, the use of pervaporation allows the recovery of aromas
[77–81]. It is often the case that aroma compounds can be lost during production, and
since they inﬂuence the taste of the juice, their addition (after recovery) to the ﬁnal
product greatly improves the taste of the juices. It should be noted here that ﬂavors are

model and real solutions were also carried out in subsequent years to assess the
suitability of the membranes and to establish appropriate process conditions. In
conclusion, the authors have always pointed out the promising nature of these studies
and the high application potential. However, in the case of model solutions, the
selectivity of the process was found to decrease with increasing amounts of compo-
nents in the model solution [78]. The interesting comparison was done by Pereira and
coworkers [77]. In their work pervaporation tests were carried out with binary or
quaternary synthetic aqueous solutions of typical aroma components (oct-1-en-3-ol
and esters: ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate) and single strength and
clariﬁed pineapple juices. The authors showed that, whether a synthetic solution or
juice is analyzed, pervaporation allows for the enrichment of the most volatile com-
ponents and that the lower the miscibility of organic solvents in water, the higher the
overall mass transfer coefﬁcient was obtained. Unfortunately the paper did not
compare the performance of the process for the systems considered (model and real).
Another proposition is to recover valuable ingredients from juice or byproducts
(peals) such as carotenoids [86–90], phenolic compounds [91–94] (see Table 4.3). It
is worth noting that the proposed solutions make it possible to use many of the valu-
able ingredients present in fruit and vegetables. Additional researchers are proposing
solutions that can signiﬁcantly improve the health beneﬁts of plant-based products. In
addition, the proposals to reduce sugar levels make them suitable for diabetics [88].
Presented examples show that there is still problem with precise separation of phenolic
compound, mainly caused by the complicated components of feed liquids and the
limited selection membranes. One of the supporting solutions may be to integrate
additional separation techniques to increase the purity of polyphenols (Table 4.3).
It should also be noted that vegetable or fruit juices can only be a byproduct. One
such example is potato juice, which is produced during the manufacture of potato
starch. It is assumed that the processing of one tone of potatoes yields up to 500 kg of
such juice, which contains both mineral compounds and organic substances (mainly
proteins), such as vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, C, and E), antinutritional (phytates), as
well as toxic substances (glycoalkaloids) [100]. Kowalczewski et al. [101] showed the
possibility of utilizing this juice by membrane ﬁltration-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis.
Both enzymatic hydrolysis of potato juice in a membrane reactor, as well as membrane
ﬁltration systems (UF (polyethersulfone spiral-wound membrane, cut-off 1 kDa) and
then NF (polyamide thin ﬁlm composite NF membrane, cut-off 300–500 Da) to proteins
concentration) allow to obtain product with higher antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity of
the product against cancer cells and concentration of polyphenolic compounds in
comparison to the raw materials. This research, although still at the lab stage, shows a
very interesting direction for juice management. Also UF membranes are proposed for
bioactive compound recovery (polyphenols and a nutrient-rich stream) from potato
peels with sequential hydrothermal extraction [102]. The recovery of mentioned above
compounds from beverage industrial products and byproducts not only could add
economic value but also reduce the environmental burden.

4.3 Beer and wine production
4.3.1 Beer
Both in the case of beer as well as wine the consumption depends on consumers’
demographic, their socioeconomic characteristics and cultural convergences. For
example in 2019 the largest world beer consumer is Chine, the US is in second place,
Brazil was ranked third, next Mexico, Russia, and Germany. This relationship was also
characteristic of production. The data per capita are slightly different, first location was
taken by Czech Republic, second Austria, next Romania, Germany, and Poland. Most of
listed countries have very long history in beer production, however, cultural differ-
ences influence on the diversity of processes, and kinds of beer produced. Demand for
free-alcohol beverages is increasing due to newer consumption practices that limit
alcohol consumption for a variety of reasons: healthier lifestyle, driving restrictions, or
religious considerations. Tradition of brewing and significant sensitivity of quality and
taste of the final product has resulted so far in an unwillingness to introduce changes in
the production process. Technological innovations are unfortunately necessary and
concern on saving energy, increasing quality of known product and in creation new
catalog products. The traditional beer brewing process has a series of stages, which
lead to conversion the starch source into the wort, and in the next into alcohol through
the alcoholic fermentation. These stages are mashing, boiling, cooling, fermentation,
maturation, separation, and clarification (Figure 4.2) [103, 104].

4 Membrane techniques in the production of beverages

Most of these steps require the use of filtration methods, including membrane
processes. The first stage that requires the participation of this type of method is brew
water treatment. Water quality has a significant influence on almost every stage of beer
production. Especially the chemical composition of the water is of great importance for
the quality and nature of the end product. For example ions such as iron, chlorides, and
sulfates can affect the taste of beer, a pH value above seven can inhibit enzymes,
fermentation disturbances can be caused by too high concentration of nitrate ions,
while too low pH, and chloride ions can cause corrosion. The expected water demin-
eralization is ensured by RO (water is transported through semi-permeable membrane
and contaminant is removed as concentrate with desalination rate of 90–99%) or
combination RO with saturation system e.g., EUWA LIQUICK® and processes (Figure 4.3).
The pretreatment of water in RO system guarantees that the plant will be work trouble-
free. The use of polishing ﬁlters, sand ﬁlters or activated carbon ﬁlters should eliminate
any factors that can cause an irreversible damage of the membrane. Preventing, it is
also applied anti-scalants or scale inhibitors. The supporting of RO by other technique
positively inﬂuences on the desalination rate of particles larger than 5 μm, reduction
pressure to 10 bar, and energy consumption. The RO system also prevents secondary
contamination of water. The potential of poly(ether)sulphone or cellulose triacetate HF
membranes (HF-Hollow Fiber) were also tested in dead-end or cross-ﬂow technology.
But despite the fact that the materials showed signiﬁcant ﬁltration properties, the
solution was cost-intensive. Less costly method is NF, which requires much lower
pressure than 15 bar. However, this system is not effective as expected for monovalent
ions (Na+, Cl−). Therefore, NF has not been used in brewing process so far [106, 107].
This type of ﬁltration can be used successfully for wastewater recycling.
Figure 4.2: General scheme of brewing process [105].
4.3 Beer and wine production
91

Filtration is also conducted after mashing process, after which the barley husks are
removed from wort. On this stage two solution are used: mash filter or a lauter tun. The
lauter tun is a two-unit operation, which eliminates the suspension from the wort and
enables removal of soluble compounds from the extract. Wort separators mainly rely
on the solid components in the mash as filter material. Mash filtering results in higher
filtration efficiency in terms of wort clarity and filtration efficiency. The alternatives are
a system with flexible membranes, between which the distance is regulated. Unfor-
tunately this is a yield-limiting stage in the brewery, because the removed suspension
must be disposed each time. Commercially available filter membranes can provide
uninterrupted one unit filtration, however, this system was recommended for small
brewing system. Another alternative is a system with flexible membranes, between
which the distance is regulated by inflating with compressed air to squeeze the mash
against a permeable polypropylene cloth [108, 109]. Schneider et al. [110] compared
lauter tun and membrane ﬁltration efﬁciencies in wort ﬁltration. The research indicated
that the ﬁnal quality of beer produced was not depended on type of ﬁltration tech-
nology. Using lauter tun and membrane ﬁltration, the beer characteristics were com-
parable, but in some aspects such as the foam collapse time, were worse in the case of
the membrane ﬁltration process. The effectiveness of the membrane ﬁltration of the
wort was indicated as dependent on the hydrophobicity of the materials. The hydro-
phobic PTFE membrane showed higher permeability than the hydrophilic polyamide
membrane. Moreover, the selectivity of the membrane ﬁltration towards high

4 Membrane techniques in the production of beverages

molecular weight substances did not depend on the pore size, but on the formation of
the sediment layer. It is worth mentioning that high molecular weight polysaccharides
lead to fouling in contrast to low molecular weight sugars [111–114]. In another works
the mash separation were conducted using cross-ﬂow MF. Dauﬁn et al. [115] indicated
that using MF more than 90% of the spent grains can be removed from the wort.
Unfortunately to high amount of suspended particles required conducting ﬁltration
minimum in two-stages. The optimum ﬂuxes is possible to applied using membrane
with a pore size of 70–80 µm and after that using membrane with pore size 10 µm and
higher. Cross-ﬂow MF can also be assisted by centrifugal decanting to separate parti-
cles larger than 15 µm. This solution allows the use of milling malt and other milled
grains in brewing [116]. Blanpain–Avet et al. [117] tested polycarbonate membranes
and alumina with a pore size of 0.2 µm. As expected, using a cross-ﬂow MF system,
the sludge layer leaded to the protein separation through internal contamination of the
pores in the initial stages of ﬁltration, followed by external contamination of the
surface. This problem could be solved operating at lower and constant pressures.
However, even when a constant pressure condition will be applied, a decrease in the jet
velocity will be observed [118].
Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) is a major by-product of the brewing process, which can
be used as a source of protein. Here, the membrane process has also found an appli-
cation, e. g. for the purification of proteins by UF [119]. However, alkaline extraction
and protein precipitation with ethanol and ammonium sulfate [120] or by acidiﬁcation
to pH 3 [121] are commonly employed for proteins separation. BSG can also be enzy-
matically treated using proteolytic enzymes or can be pretreated with carbohydrases
followed by direct hydrolysis with enzymes Alcalase and Flavourzyme [120, 122, 123].
Tang et al. [119] studied the application of UF for recovery of proteins from BSG pre-
prepared by ultrasound assisted extraction using the carbonate–bicarbonate buffer. In
this system, more than 92% proteins were retained by the UF membrane with MWCO of
5 kDa.
The presence of components of potential in nutritional value enables BGS to be
considered not only as animal feed but also as an attractive adjunct for human food
[124]. The most attractive perspective is production of dietary ﬁber-rich and protein-rich
ﬂours but for this purpose BGS must be properly dried. In the technology proposed
by Carvalho and coworkers, drying of BSG to moisture of 20% can be obtained after
fresh BSG being mixed with water, ﬁltered, water-washed, membrane-squeezed, and
vacuum-dried. The developed conditions were also conﬁrmed by the pilot plant
testing. The obtained cake, after ﬁltration at feed pressure of 3–5 bar, was dewatered by
membrane squeezing using water of 65 °C to moisture of 51%. The followed vacuum hot
cake drying enabled to the moisture decrease to ∼20% [125]. Much better results the
same team obtained using modiﬁed technology considering mainly construction
changes [126]. In this study the PP membrane was circulated by water of 85–95 °C at the
squeezing pressure of 2–3 bar, while vacuum drying was carried out over the hot cakes
at 50–110 mbar. Further, modiﬁcation concerned on applying stainless steel Rollﬁt®

plates were heated with hot water 85–95 °C. The carried out experiments indicated that
regardless used membrane plates the BSG can be dewatered to moisture of 15%.
4.3.1.1 Clarification
The clarification of rough beer must comply with the haze specification of the beer to
produce a clear, bright beer according to the European Brewery Convention (EBC)
norms. Filtration through kieselguhr or a diatomaceous earth rock, has been suc-
cessfully used for many years to meet this specification. However, clarifiers and other
agents used in this filtration can be considered as hazardous materials such that further
use may conflict with the handling/disposal regulations in many countries. Filtration is
generally used to clarify of the green beer and to remove turbidity formers, which could
lead to visible changes, occur in the long storage of the final product.
4.3.1.2 Sterilization
Membrane techniques are recommended for the so-called cold sterilization. Then, the
selection of the appropriate filters will allow even the complete removal of bacteria,
yeasts, and molds, which results in a microbiologically stable beer with an extended
shelf life [127]. These are general assumptions, while research in this area indicates that
ﬁltration efﬁciency depends on various factors. For example, ﬁltration is inﬂuenced by
the viscosity of beer, which is closely related to its composition, e.g., the presence of
arabinoxylan, β-glucanβ-glucan, polyphenols. The interaction of the components with
the membrane is also important, which results in fouling of internal pores at the initial
stage of ﬁltration or ﬁnally surface fouling. The fouling can also be limited by the
appropriate selection of the membrane construction material [128]. For example,
membranes with greater porosity, e.g., cellulose acetate membranes, are more sensible
to fouling than polycarbonate membranes.
4.3.1.3 Dealcoholization
The low-alcohol beer (alcoholic residue less than 1.2% vol) can be effectively produced
by fermentation limited by an appropriate low consisting of carbohydrates, or by a
limited yeast metabolism (Figure 4.4). Unfortunately, using this procedure produced
beer is devoid of expected by consumers ﬂavors and sensory attributes such as
bitterness [129]. Until quite recently beer has been dealcoholized by distillation. This
method was effective but the heat treatment adversely changed the beer ﬂavor. Even
the using of much softer thermal methods such as vacuum rectiﬁcation and evapora-
tion did not eliminate losses of high volatile compounds.
Vacuum techniques, whose conditions are much milder, are seen with hope in
limiting thermal damage to components, such as loss of smell and taste. The thermal
94
4 Membrane techniques in the production of beverages

constituents degradation can be easily limited by using membrane-based methods.
Membrane filtration is also less energy-intensive. The main membrane techniques used
in the production of low-alcohol and nonalcoholic beer are dialysis, RO, and perva-
poration. Less are osmotic evaporation, MD, and NF [130]. Selection of technique used
and the effectiveness of the separation of ethanol or ﬂavors depends on the compo-
sition of the material to be treated, e.g., molecular size, volatility, solubility, threshold,
and taste value, which vary depending on the production method used.
4.3.1.3.1 Dialysis
Dialysis is based on the use of semipermeable membrane, in which, in the counter-
currently system flow, low molecular weight ethanol passes through a membrane to a
dialyzate at a pressure differential of less than 0.5 bar. Dealcoholization consists of
passing the permeable alcohols molecules through the membrane into the aqueous
phase (dialyzate ﬂuid) in order to achieve an equilibrium concentration (Figure 4.5).
The alcohol-enriched dialyzate is then sent to a stripper column to remove ethanol by
evaporation. Next regenerated dialyzate is send back to the dialysis unit to remove
remaining portion ethanol [131]. Due to the risk of CO2 loss, the process requires
pressure to the beer side even 0.1 bar, or as dialyzate a carbon dioxide-containing ﬂuid
is used. Using this technology, the beer in the dealcoholization process is processed
at low-temperatures; therefore there are no thermal degradation products [132].
Figure 4.4: Methods used to reduce alcohol in beer and wine.
4.3 Beer and wine production
95

Moreover, this technique lowers the bitter units and the pH, but the level is positively
identiﬁed by the consumer. Other parameters, such as color, total nitrogen, and
polyphenol content are as identiﬁed at the predealcoholization level. The evaporation
stage, supporting the dialysis process, also does not cause changes the taste values
e.g., by the formation of caramel or bread notes. However, the sensitivity of the ﬁnal
beer composition depends on the used procedures [133–135].
4.3.1.3.2 Reverse osmosis
Another membrane technique is RO, which also works with semi-permeable mem-
branes of asymmetric structure (from cellulose acetate, polyimide, or polyamide
composite) at a pressure of up to 60 bar. In the dealcoholization process, ethanol
together with water is transported through a membrane into a region of higher solute
concentration – in the opposite direction to the osmotic pressure. It was why using RO
dealcoholization below 0.45 vol% is economically not feasible, but it allow to obtain
beer with a more complete but slightly acidic taste, with a greater loss of bitter sub-
stances and an increase in turbidity [137, 138] (Table 4.4). Higher pressures results in
higher permeate ﬂux but this condition can also increase aroma rejection causing
loss of ﬂavor. Ethanol and aroma components rejection also increases with elevated
temperature. The membranes used for beer dealcoholization are usually of asymmetric

structure, with the active layer made of cellulose acetate, polyamide, polysulfone. The
life of acetate membranes depends on pH and temperature. Because both factors can
affect the hydrolysis of the acetate group optimal pH at 0 °C is 4.5–5.0. Due to the large
water losses, redilution of the alcohol-reduced retentate or continuous procedure in the
diaﬁltration mode are necessary. In the case of diaﬁltration, the required alcohol
concentration is adjusted by replenishing the removed water, but not exceeding the
original beer volume. This type of operation also requires a carbonation step.
4.3.1.3.3 Membrane distillation
MD is a thermally controlled separation process in which only vapor molecules are
transported through the micropores of the membrane. The driving force behind the
process is the difference in partial vapor pressure caused by the temperature gradient
across the membrane. According to the mechanism, the liquid compounds evaporate
on the hot side of the membrane feed, then diffuse through the pores of the membrane

and eventually condense on the permeate side. The same mechanism controls the
dealcoholization process. Ethanol has a higher vapor pressure than water; therefore
the rate of penetration of ethanol is also higher. Unfortunately, although the water–
ethanol separation process takes place without change in a flavor profile, this tech-
nique has not found industrial application. It has been proposed also modifications to
this solution, e.g., vacuum MD, however the increase of feed and vacuum pressure
not only improves the membrane flux, but also reduces the membrane selectivity
[139, 140]. Ultimately, the changes in the membrane ﬂux do not affect the effectiveness
of the dealcoholization. The conduction of vacuum MD for 6 h reduced the alcohol
content of the beer from ﬁve to just 2.25 vol%.
4.3.1.3.4 Osmotic distillation
OD is another membrane process in which the dealcoholization is carried out by using
the difference in ethanol vapor pressure between the two sides of the hydrophobic
microporous membrane. Even though in this process temperature gradient is not
applied, membranes of high thermal conductivity such as polypropylene, polytetra-
fluoroethylene, and polyvinylidene fluoride are common used. In OD the evaporated
alcohol is transferred through the membrane pores and condenses in the stripper. The
stripper side states a concentrated solution of an electrolyte of high osmotic activity
e.g., calcium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium acetate, however in the deal-
coholization process water is the most recommended stripper. This recommendation
was based on the low back transport of water with the simultaneously high ethanol
flow [141]. The disadvantage of using water as a stripper is signiﬁcant reduction of CO2
and oxygenation of the dealcoholized beer. Here the solution is to use an intermediate
cycle permeate as was conﬁrmed by Russo et al. [142]. Moreover, the use of permeate
maintains pH, polyphenols content, and antioxidant activity on the level before
dealcoholization. However, the changes in bitterness, foam stability, turbidity, and
aroma are also indicated and they have a negative impact on the ﬁnal beer taste.
4.3.1.3.5 Pervaporation
Pervaporation is another membrane technology which enables to the production of
nonalcoholic or low-alcoholic beer maintaining its characteristic flavors and aromas.
The transport of alcohol molecules through the semipermeable hydrophobic mem-
brane is due to the difference in chemical potential of alcohol/water in the feed and
permeate side, which can be highlighted by vacuum. The permeate is condensed and
transferred into the low concentrated alcoholic fluid and the retentate keeps rest of
compounds determining the aroma profile of the original beer [130, 143]. This mem-
brane technology enables to alcohol content reduction to ∼1% (longue time duration),
therefore it has been proposed as technique for partial dealcoholization of beverages
[144] (Table 4.4). Another applicability is aroma extraction from beer, e.g., iso-amyl
and isobutyl and alcohol, ethyl and iso-amyl acetate, as well as aldehydes [145–147].
And in most industrial solutions, this applicability complements more efﬁcient

dealcoholization techniques such as centrifugal distillation [143] or by using two
different PV systems, thanks to which the dealcoholized beer is enriched with the
extracted in another unit aroma compounds (see Table 4.5).

4.3 Beer and wine production

4.4 Wine
As in the case of beer, wine is also dealcoholized. Also, the process may include
activities in the fermentation stage of winemaking [153] as well as post-production
physical activities [132]. However, it should be remembered that the wine brand itself
imposes a speciﬁc composition and the reduction of alcohol to a level below 8.5%
means that the beverage cannot be called “wine [154]. Comparable to the beer deal-
coholization the removal of ethanol from wine can be conducted by using conventional
heat techniques as well membrane systems. However, only membrane systems can be
selective enough to ensure that the taste and bouquet of the wine meet consumer
expectations [155].
Slight changes in the sensory qualities of wines are ensured by processes that
remove up to 2% of ethanol or by using multi-stage processes based on membrane
processes such as RO, pervaporation, OD. For example using RO phenolic substances
and polysaccharides are almost completely preserved. Changes in aroma composition
depend on membrane construction. The 70% loss occurs with a polyamide membrane,

while a 10% removal occurs with a cellulose acetate membrane [156]. Double RO
process enable to produce not only wines composes less than 11–13% of alcohol but
also nonalcoholic wines (alcohol content below 0.01%) with the unchanged poly-
saccharide composition [157]. In another solution the using two-stage membrane
pervaporation enables to produce simultaneously grape spirit, such as brandy, and
alcohol-free wine [158]. Moreover, the obtained brandy exhibited better smell and taste
than traditional distilled liquor. In the case of rice wine, both the bentonite and RO
treatment could be appropriate to prepare nonalcoholic takju [158] (see Table 4.6).
4.5 Conclusions
An analysis of recent literature reports clearly shows the continuous development of
membrane techniques, which are used in the production of a wide range of food
beverages. It has been shown that membranes can not only support production, but in
many elements can effectively replace traditional processing methods.

5 Polymeric membranes for biomedical
applications
Abstract: The rapid development of nanotechnology paved the way for further
expansionof polymer chemistry andthefabricationof advanced polymeric membranes.
Such modifications allowed enhancing or adding some unique properties, including
mechanical strength, excellent biocompatibility, easily controlled degradability, and
biological activity. This chapter discusses various applications of polymeric membranes
in three significant areas of biomedicine, including tissue engineering, drug delivery
systems, and diagnostics. It is intended to highlight here possible ways of improvement
the properties of polymeric membranes, by modifying with other polymers, functional
groups, compounds, drugs, bioactive components, and nanomaterials.
Keywords: biomedicine; membrane technology; nanomaterials; nanoparticles; polymer
membranes.
5.1 Introduction
Polymeric materials have been studied and developed for multiple biomedical appli-
cations to enhance the quality of human life [1–3], ranging from polymer membranes
that improve the functionality of organs, such as bio-artiﬁcial kidney, pancreas, and
lungs, to applications as implants, drug delivery systems, or diagnostic assays [4–12].
The physicochemical, mechanical, and surface properties of membranes vary in terms
of speciﬁc applications or their placement within the body. For instance, membrane
material applied as an implant can be exposed to high mechanical stress or aggressive
chemical conditions [13–15]. Thus, the requirements in the selection of polymer ma-
terial depend on the intended use of designed membranes. The examples of biomedical
applications of membranes are presented in Figure 5.1.
Generally, the polymeric membranes can be applied in three main areas including,
but not limited to: (i) tissue engineering, with puriﬁcation procedure to restore func-
tions of organs (e.g. removal of toxins from the blood, its oxygenation), as well as
fabrication of artiﬁcial organs or scaffolds to stimulate cell growth and differentiation,
(ii) drug delivery system allowing to transport various drugs, biologically active sub-
stances or even genes, and ﬁnally (iii) diagnosis allowing to detect several diseases

based on sensitive and selective membrane sensors or pre analytical processes on
blood samples analysis.
There are three main concerns associated with the medical application of mem-
branes: biofouling, uncontrollable degradation of the membrane, and immune reac-
tion caused by the membrane. The contact of the membrane with biological fluids is the
main cause of all of these problems. Various approaches come together to deal with
these limitations, such as (i) modiﬁcation of membrane surface properties, (ii)
improvement their physicochemical, mechanical, and biological properties by
attachment of bioactive molecules, targeting agents, or nanomaterials, (iii) modiﬁca-
tion of membranes production technology to easily control their morphology and ﬁnal
properties, and (iv) modiﬁcation of polymer materials intended to impute new prop-
erties, such as biocompatibility, degradability, and biological resistance. Nanotech-
nology takes a special place in overcoming all of these limits [16–18]. This chapter
discusses various applications of polymeric membranes in the ﬁeld of biomedicine,
pointing the weakness of membrane materials and possible ways of improvement their
properties.
5.1.1 Restoration of organs function
Dialysis is one of the oldest examples of using membrane technology in the medical
field [19]. The ﬁrst dialysis treatment involving humans was reported in 1925 by Georg
Haas [20]. However, the ﬁrst scientiﬁc description of dialysis procedures dates back to
1856 and comes from Thomas Graham (Scottish chemist) [21]. The Haas dialyzer
module was made of collodion tubes (materials based on cellulose nitrate) [22]. Over
the next 50 years, most studies focused on the modiﬁcation of membrane modules to

improve the diffusive mass transfer efﬁciency and reduce high blood compartment
volumes. A turning point was the fabrication of the ﬁrst hollow-ﬁber module in 1960
[19]. This module consisted of an array of narrow ﬁbers enclosed in a pressure vessel
(Figure 5.2). The hollow-ﬁber module geometry provided the highest membrane sur-
face area (volume ratio in the blood compartment), as well as improved blood rheology
and mass transfer.
There are three different types of dialysis applied for people with renal diseases:
hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and continuous renal replacement ther-
apy (CRRT) [23–27]. Hemodialysis uses an “artiﬁcial kidney” to remove waste and extra
ﬂuid from the blood. Additionally, it helps to control the blood pressure and miner
balance (including the level of potassium, sodium, and calcium). The blood is taken
out of the body, ﬁltered through the special dialysis module, and returned to the body
(Figure 5.3a). Peritoneal dialysis involves pumping special sterile ﬂuids into the
abdomen through a permanent tube (catheter) placed in the peritoneal cavity, to
remove waste products from surroundings blood vessels (Figure 5.3b). CRRT is applied
for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, whose bodies cannot tolerate regular
dialysis. It mimics the kidney functions such as regulating electrolytes, acid/base,
water, drugs, and toxins by a continuous and slow removal of ﬂuids (24 h a day). The
blood passes through a double-lumen venovenous catheter, an extracorporeal circuit,
and a semipermeable membrane (hemoﬁlter) that removes the ﬂuids and impurities. At
the same time, the replacement ﬂuid replenishes the volume and electrolytes removed
(Figure 5.3c) [28].
Dialysis membranes can be divided into cellulosic and synthetic groups, as well as
a low or high flux (depending on pore sizes), according to the oldest classification
based on material composition and water permeability, respectively. However, the
development of polymer chemistry opened new frontiers in the production of advanced

polymeric membranes with unique features. Thus, traditional classification requires a
reconsideration to include other properties, such as the surface potential of mem-
branes, their adsorption capacity, and their hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature. An early
generation of cellulose-based membranes, such as Cuprophan®, Cuprammonium
Rayon, Saponiﬁed Cellulose Ester (SCE®), or FIN-type, was extremely polar and

hydrophilic [29]. Additionally, cellulosic membrane exhibited a thin-walled structure,
with favorable diffusive transport properties for low-weight molecules (500–1000 Da),
which classiﬁed them to the low ﬂux groups [30]. However, due to low biocompati-
bility, they contributed to the inﬂammatory response induced by the production of
cytokine (e.g. interleukin IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [31]. Furthermore, the
interaction between blood proteins and membrane surface may initiate a blood
coagulation cascade, infections, and various allergic reactions [32]. In recent 30 years,
cellulosic membranes were modiﬁed by partial substitution of hydroxyl groups by
acetylation to improve hemocompatibility and make large molecule and water removal
more efﬁcient [33]. Such membranes are commonly called modiﬁed cellulose,
substituted cellulose, or semisynthetic membranes. Depending on the degree of sub-
stitution, modiﬁed membranes can contain various amounts of cellulose acetate (CA),
diacetate, or triacetate [34]. These modiﬁcations resulted in increased membrane pore
size, yielding a higher water and high-weight molecules (>5000 Da) permeability. The
esteriﬁcation of cellulose reduced the inﬂammatory response; nevertheless, the
biocompatibility issue remained. However, extensive research performed over the past
few decades indicated that immune response is also associated with material hydro-
phobicity, their charge, number of hydroxyl groups, as well as the roughness of
membrane surface [35–37]. Moreover, the hydrophobicity and surface roughness are
involved in the activation of platelets, which may initiate the blood coagulation
cascade [36].
Takouli and coworkers fabricated vitamin E-coated dialysis cellulose membrane to
improve its biocompatibility [38]. The use of vitamin E-modiﬁed CA membrane
signiﬁcantly suppressed oxidative stress and inﬂammation. The authors concluded
that liposoluble vitamin E on the blood surface allowed to direct free radical scav-
enging at the membrane site. The latest research improved also that polyethylene
glycol (PEG) additives in CA inﬂuenced the pore size, permeate ﬂux, and hydrophilic
properties of membranes [39, 40]. Idris and Yet investigated the effect of different
molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives and on the performance and
morphology of CA membrane [40]. It was shown that different molecular weight PEG
inﬂuenced the formation of the various asymmetric layers as a result of different
diffusion rates. For instance, high molecular weight PEG (e.g. PEG 600) revealed a low
diffusion rate and promoted the formation of the thick dense asymmetric membrane
[40]. Das et al. modiﬁed CA membrane with titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs).
This CA-TiO2 hybrid membrane was fabricated using the electrospinning technique,
commonly applied for the production of polymer ﬁbers. The presence of TiO2 NPs
distributed within the CA matrix improved the roughness, affected its surface charge,
and caused a uniform decline in average CA ﬁber diameter [41]. Nanoparticles might be
also incorporated into the cellulose-based matrix to enhance antimicrobial properties.
De Faria and coworkers presented fabrication of antimicrobial membranes made of CA
modiﬁed with graphene oxide–silver nanocomposite. The authors improved that NPs-
functionalized membrane exhibited larger surface pores and increased water ﬂux.
5.1 Introduction

Moreover, it revealed excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and
Escherichia coli [42].
Synthetic membranes offer better biocompatibility in comparison with cellulose
membranes [43]. They are made of polyamide (PA), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA),
polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polysulfone (PS) [34]. Generally, synthetic membranes
consist of a thin inner layer and a thicker outer layer. The outer layer provides me-
chanical support for a selective active inner layer. They can be classiﬁed as high-ﬂux or
low-ﬂux, depending on the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) [44–46]. The synthetic
membranes are strongly hydrophobic and thick-walled (due to the presence of a thick
support layer). The hydrophobicity of membranes is responsible for some side effects
associated with the fouling of membranes caused by the adhesion of plasma proteins
(mainly albumin, globulin, and hemoglobin) on the membrane surface. It can lead to
platelet aggregation, adhesion, and coagulation [47, 48]. However, to minimize the
membrane fouling, a hydrophobic matrix can be modiﬁed by the addition of hydro-
philic polymers, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), or PEG. This modiﬁcation can be
made through the blending method, plasma treatment, or surface modiﬁcation, such
as chemical reaction and grafting, or coating through adsorption or electrostatic in-
teractions [49]. For example, Kim et al. improved hydrophilicity and stability of poly-
sulfone membrane by entrapping of sulfonated poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate deblock
copolymer into PS matrix [50]. Wang and coworkers enhanced hydrophilicity and
hemocompatibility of polyethersulfone membrane by blending with a pore-forming
agent, i.e. PVP. The authors demonstrated that PVP-modiﬁed polyethersulfone (PES)
membranes exhibited higher water ﬂux and lower water contact angle in comparison
with pristine PES. Additionally, the PVP additive caused a reduction in plasma protein
adsorption and prolonged blood coagulation time [51]. Improvement of anti-
coagulation performance of PES-based membranes can be achieved by immobilization
of biologically active compounds or drugs. Ren et al. demonstrated immobilization of
heparin onto PES surface by using low-temperature plasma treatment (LPT) and
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide
(EDC/NHS)
activation mechanism. It was shown that LPT immobilization methods retained the
activity of heparin and improved the hydrophilic properties of PES membrane [52].
Another interesting report presented Zhao and coworkers. The authors improved hy-
drophilicity by immobilisation of single-strand DNA onto PES surface. Therefore, the
adsorption of protein onto DNA-modiﬁed membranes signiﬁcantly decreased, as a
result of interactions between proteins and DNA [53].
To reduce the fouling phenomena, pristine polymeric membranes can be modified
with nanoparticles. Said et al. improved the hydrophilicity of polysulfone (PS) hollow
ﬁber membranes by incorporation of hydrophilic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP). It
was shown that the surface of IONP-modiﬁed membranes displayed less roughness, in
comparison with pure PS membranes. Smother surface provided a smaller attractive
area to proteins adsorption, thus reduced the fouling of the PS–IONP hollow ﬁber
membranes [54]. The effect of PEG/Al2O3 nanoparticles on PES membrane structure
116
5 Polymeric membranes for biomedical applications

and its antifouling properties was investigated by Garcia–Ivars et al. The PES mem-
brane was modiﬁed by UV irradiation (UV photographing technique) in the presence of
PEG and Al2O3 nanoparticles. Both components had a high afﬁnity to the polar envi-
ronment, causing high permeability for pure water and thus, high rejection of hydro-
phobic proteins or macromolecules [55]. Chemical functionalization of aminated PES
membranes with silver nanoparticles was demonstrated by Heider et al. The presence
of silver nanoparticles attached to the surface of PES provided antibacterial properties
against E. coli. In addition, the prolonged silver ions release extended the lifetime of the
membrane [56].
Polymer materials are commonly applied in blood oxygenators to remove carbon
dioxide and add oxygen during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (Figure 5.4). The ﬁrst
experimental description of membrane oxygenator was published in 1956. The main
component of this oxygenator device was a nonporous ﬂat sheet gas permeable
membrane made of ethylcellulose, which was highly hydrophilic, exhibited poor
mechanical properties, and its sterilization was complicated [57]. Furthermore, the
damage and breakdown of erythrocytes and platelets, due to the direct contact of blood
with the membrane, substantially shortened its lifetime.
To enhance the mechanical properties of gas permeable membranes, the hydro-
philic polymers were replaced by hydrophobic ones, such as polyethylene (PE) or pol-
ytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon®). However, these polymers are characterized by the
low velocity of oxygen and carbon dioxide transport [58]. The introduction of hydro-
phobic membranes based on polyorganosiloxanes, especially polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) membranes, partially solved the low permeability problem (the permeability of
O2 and CO2 for PDMS is around sixfold higher than other hydrophobic polymers) [59].
Polymeric membranes can be also used to oxygenate blood in longer-term life to perform
Figure 5.4: Membrane oxygenator.
5.1 Introduction

extracorporeal blood oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with acute respiratory failure. The
cylindrical Kolobow oxygenator equipped with spirally wound silicone rubber mem-
brane was used for the ﬁrst neonatal ECMO case in 1979 [60]. However, as with the
dialysisprocess, an importantﬁndingwas oxygenator basedonhollow-ﬁbermembranes
[57]. This oxygenator was introduced in 1972 and quickly achieved more than 50% of the
oxygenator market share. Moreover, hollow-ﬁber oxygenators become a standard of
cardiopulmonary care from the 1970s to the present. The ﬁrst hollow-ﬁber oxygenators
consisted of a large number of microporous membranes made of polypropylene (PP) or
silicone ﬁber [61, 62]. The main drawback of these devices was the tendency to leak blood
plasma through the micropores of membranes, thus degrading gas transfer capability
and markedly decreasing their service life. To prevent the blood plasma component’s
leakage, the outer surface of the hollow-ﬁber membrane was coated by hydrophilic
polymers, such as hydrophilic silicones and siloxanes, alkoxyalkyl (meth)acrylate, or
block copolymer of silicone and polyarylate [63–65]. This problem led also to the
development of polymethylpentene (PMP) microporous hollow-ﬁber membranes, which
provided almost complete physical separation between gases and circulated blood [66].
And, importantly, the oxygenator equipped with PMP hollow-ﬁber membranes can be
applied for ECMO for periods beyond 60 days. However, due to some areas allowing
limited blood plasma leakage, as well as gas emboli formation, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA or USFDA) approved the usage of PMP-based oxygenators for a
maximum of 4–6 h [67].
Another way to enhance oxygenation efficiency is the application of nanoporous
polymer materials in blood oxygenators. Nanoporous membranes may serve as a more
efficient barrier to water influx, thus improving long term pulmonary support in ECMO
procedures. Ambravaneswaran and coauthors fabricated a silicon nitride membrane
via a combination of bulk micromachining and ion-beam drilling. The designed
membranes exhibited mechanical properties enough to withstand pressures typically
experienced for blood oxygenators. The initial studies showed that dimensions of the
blood channels permitted the red cell shape changes, thereby enhanced the exchange
of gas in the pulmonary capillary [68]. The PP and PMP membranes commonly applied
in commercial ECMO systems suffer from low biocompatibility, which usually led to
blood coagulation or hemolysis. Park et al. presented a new generation of blood
oxygenation membranes based on amphipathic ﬂuoropolymers [69]. The authors
fabricated polyvinylideneﬂuoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene (PVDF-co-HFP) using non-
solvent induced phase separation method (NIPS). To reduce the interaction with blood
components and pore wetting, the ﬂat sheet nanoporous hexaﬂuoropropylene (HPF)
membrane was coated with Hyﬂon AD60X (amorphous perﬂuorinated copolymer of
tetraﬂuoroethylene (TFE) and 2,2,4-triﬂuoro-5-triﬂuorometoxy-1,3-dioxole (TTD)). The ex
vivo studies carried out using sheep blood indicated that the PVDF-co-HFP membrane
was more effective in blood oxygenation than commercial PMP membranes [69].
Membrane technology can be applied in the artificial extracorporeal liver assist
devices to temporarily support the failing organ before transplantation or until it will be
118
5 Polymeric membranes for biomedical applications

able to regenerate [70]. These extracorporeal devices use various membrane operations
(e.g. hemodialysis, hemoﬁltration, and hemoperfusion) integrated with other separa-
tion techniques, including column puriﬁcation, sorbents (such as cation-/anion-ex-
change resins, charcoal) or bioreactors containing immobilized enzymes [71–73]. For
instance, hemoperfusion can be integrated with charcoal sorbent to adsorb water-
soluble toxins in the low and middle molecular weight [74]. Single-pass albumin
dialysis (SPAD) is another membrane-based support system to treat liver failure. The
albumin is added to dialysate to improve the capturing of protein-bound toxins, such
as nonceruloplasmin-bound copper, which is involved in Wilsonian liver disease. The
blood ﬂows across the high-lux dialysis membrane, while the albumin solution is
transported in opposite direction to the dialysis membrane, to detoxicate the blood
plasma [75]. However, the high cost associated with albumin concentration caused that
this therapy was not often used in clinical practice.
Nowadays, there are only two artificial extracorporeal liver support system, based
on the concept of albumin dialysis, applied in the clinic (Figure 5.5): Molecular
Figure 5.5: Artificial extracorporeal liver support systems: molecular adsorbents recirculating system
(MARS) and Prometheus [78].
5.1 Introduction
119

adsorbents recirculating system (called MARS®) and fractionated plasma separation
and adsorption system (FPSA, commercialised as Prometheus®) [76]. MARS is con-
sisting of three main components: (i) a conventional dialysis system equipped with PS
membranes (50 kDa) to guide the extracorporeal blood circuit, and albumin containing
dialysate to induce the dissociation of protein-bounded toxins, (ii) adsorption column
ﬁlled with charcoal to retain high weight molecules (such as bilirubin, creatinine, and
urea), and anion-exchange resin cholestyramine to retain negative-charged molecules,
and (iii) single-pass dialyzer. Moreover, the dialysate albumin is restored passing to the
adsorption columns and can be applied for the new cycle [77].
The Prometheus combines fractionated plasma separation with high-flux he-
modialysis to remove albumin-bounded and water-soluble toxins. The clearance of
toxins is achieved in several steps: (i) in the FPSA circuit, the albumin is separated
from blood by a capillary dialyzer made of PS hollow-ﬁbers (250 kDa), which allows
free toxins and plasma albumin-bounded toxins to pass through the membrane,
reaching the neutral resin’s column and anion-exchange adsorber, (ii) in the high-
ﬂux dialyzer, the water-soluble toxins are removed from the albumin-free blood
using hollow-ﬁber membranes [79].
Both MARS and Prometheus support devices can eliminate the water-soluble and
albumin-bounded hepatic toxins. However, Prometheus exhibits higher clearances for
the most bounded-proteins and water-soluble markers in comparison with MARS [80].
The main goal of the application of these systems is to grant patients a substantial
survival beneﬁt. Unfortunately, the use of artiﬁcial extracorporeal systems still faces
several technical problems and high production costs. Moreover, clinical data
regarding MARS and FPSA systems are conﬂicting [81].
5.1.2 Scaffolds fabrication
The development of membrane technology along with the evolution of regenerative
medicine contributed to the application of polymer materials as scaffolds and/or im-
plants to substitute or integrate the function of impaired tissues and organs. Scaffolds
can be defined as three-dimension porous biomaterials fabricated to perform the
following functions: (i) promote cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and cell-
biomaterials interactions, (ii) allow transporting of nutrients and regulatory factors
required for cell survival, and (iii) biodegradable at a controllable rate with minimal
cytotoxicity [82]. The criteria for selecting scaffold materials are based on their
chemistry, molecular weight, shape/form and structure, porosity, surface properties
(hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity), mechanical properties, wettability, biocompati-
bility, and degradation rate [83]. Polymer-based materials due to their unique prop-
erties, such as high porosity with pores in varying sizes, the mechanical characteristic
or degradation time, can be adapted for use in tissue engineering or fabrication of
artiﬁcial organs. Both, synthetic and natural polymers (or combination of both) can be
120
5 Polymeric membranes for biomedical applications

considered as membrane materials to mimic the function of damaged tissues. How-
ever, synthetic polymers exhibit physiochemical and mechanical properties that are
more predictable and reproducible than natural ones [84]. Among synthetic polymers
used for the production of membranes, PDMS, polycaprolactone (PCL), polyglycolic
acid (PGA), poly (L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), PTFE, PS, polyethersulfone, PEG, or
PVP are the most relevant. Some of the examples of natural polymers are collagen,
elastin, chitin, chitosan, silk, ﬁbronectin, or cellulose [85].
For instance, the ultrathin, porous PCL membrane can be applied as prosthetic
Bruch’s membrane in the treatment of retinal degeneration [86]. Bruch’s membrane is a
thin, ﬁve-layered extracellular matrix located between metabolically active retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris. It serves as a molecular sieve, to
maintain the metabolic exchange between the vasculature and outer retina, as well as
tissue scaffold for the cells, providing sufﬁcient mechanical strength [87]. Tan et al.
demonstrated that the PCL membrane can mimic the Bruch’s membrane functions. The
fabricated scaffold improved the proliferation of adult retinal pigment epithelial
(ARPE-19) cells (human retinal pigmented epithelial cells) and enhanced the formation
of the monolayer by ARPE-19 cells, which is essential for ﬂuid transport and creation of
the blood–retinal barrier [86]. In turn, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanoﬁbrous membrane
modiﬁed with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and cellulose nanoﬁbrils (CNF) may
prompt the treatment of eye infections. The modiﬁed PLA scaffold showed excellent
biocompatibility to ocular epithelial cells and antimicrobial properties against E. coli,
S. aureus, and Fusarium spp. The ocular cells formed a multilayered structure and
retained the undifferentiated stem cells on the surface of the PLA scaffold, making it
suitable for ocular bandages in controlling corneal and conjunctival infections [88].
Quiros–Solano et al. investigated the application of porous PDMS membranes for
organs-on-chips, i.e. multichannel 3D microﬂuidic cell culture chip (a type of artiﬁcial
organ) that simulates activities and physiological response of organs. The authors
emphasized that the porous membrane characteristic inﬂuences the cell mechanisms
(e.g. transmigrations of cells and their ability to form a monolayer), which might help to
better understand or regulate the cellular responses in human physiology and pa-
thology studies using organs-on-chips [89]. PTFE-based membranes can serve as
mechanical support and osteoconductivity to the growing cells in bone and cartilage
regeneration. Park et al. designed the PTFE/PEO porous membranes by a combination
of electrospinning and sintering techniques (Figure 5.6). It was proven that the
chemical composition of PTFE/PEO membranes affected the proliferation of mouse
calvaria preosteoblast cell (MC3T3-E1), their osteoblastic differentiation and bone
mineralization (in vitro studies) [90].
PCL nanofiber membranes are one of the ideal candidates for mimicking the
extracellular matrix in bones. Pristine PCL nanofibers enhance the attachment and
proliferation of osteoblast, osteoclast, osteocytes and chondrocytes, which are crucial
for the regeneration of hard tissues [91]. Baylan et al. designed an injectable 3D cell
encapsulated scaffold consisting of PCL nanoﬁbers interspersed with collagen type I
5.1 Introduction
121

microﬁbers for augmentation of bones. Based on in vitro studies, it was shown that
PCL-collagen scaffold promoted the osteoblast cells proliferation, differentiation and
formation of mineralized bone matrix [92]. The effect of plasma-treated PCL nanoﬁbers
modiﬁed with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAP) on cell proliferation was also re-
ported by Stastna et al. The plasma treatment of HAP-modiﬁed PCL scaffold resulted in
a completely wettable surface. Both, the hydrophilicity of ﬁbrous scaffold, and
modiﬁcation with HAP nanoparticles, improved cell proliferation by 30% compared to
control [93].
Hollow-fiber membranes can also serve as bio-hybrid constructs to replace the
damaged organs and tissues, especially for tissues that required a tubular shape, such
as blood vessel, nerves, intestine, urethra or cartilage. They can be fabricated using
various materials, either synthetic or natural, however, polyesters, such as PCL, PLA
and PLGA are prefered [94]. For instance, the PLLA hollow-ﬁber membrane can mimic
artiﬁcial vasculature. Based on in vitro static and dynamic mouse premyoblast cell
(C2C12) culturing, it was shown that PLLA hollow-ﬁber membrane can improve the
delivery of nutrients to the cells when integrated with tissue-engineered scaffold [95].
The examples of PLLA hollow-ﬁber membranes are presented in Figure 5.7.

5 Polymeric membranes for biomedical applications

Mohammadzadeh and coworkers modified synthetic PCL with natural bio-
polymers to fabricate biomimetic scaffolds for cutaneous regeneration. This scaffold
was composed of blend PCL, silk fibroin, aloe vera, and eggshell membrane and
applied as a support for differentiation of human cutaneous basal cells toward
keratinocyte-like cells. The authors observed an increased basal cell proliferation after
14 days in differentiation medium and formation of integrated cell-to-cell connection
after cell seeding on the hybrid scaffold [96]. Wei et al. investigated the application of a
3D-printed PCL scaffold modiﬁed with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-loaded PLGA
nanoparticles coated by polydopamine (PDA) for cartilage tissue engineering. It was
shown that PCL-based scaffold enhanced the synthesis of collagen type II and provided
a suitable environment for the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes, which
are essential in stimulating cartilage regeneration [97].
Polymer materials exhibit sufficient biocompatibility to make them an available
candidate for application as implants in tissue engineering. Ficek et al. demonstrated a
novel strategy for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using a tube-shaped
perforated PLA stent with a porosity of 45% to improve the healing process. The
implantation of PLA stent facilitated the osteointegration of the tendon graft after
reconstruction (in vivo studies). This effect was likely associated with osteogenic and
osteoconductive properties of PLA polymers [98]. Song and co-authors reported the
bioartiﬁcial pancreas devices (BAP) based on silicon nanopore membrane (SNM) [99]
(Figure 5.8). Commonly applied BAP devices exhibit poor islet viability and function-
ality, due to the low mass transfer. Based on the in vivo studies (porcine model) it was

shown that intravascular SNM BAP revealed signiﬁcant higher islet viability (>85%)
than polymer-based BAP. However, a full-scale SNM BAP system must be developed to
investigate the long-term hemocompatibility, and cell functionality in large diabetic
animals before clinical trials involve diabetes patients [99].
Microporous polymer membranes can be used for the reconstruction of three-
dimensional functional liver tissue [100]. Kasuya and Tanishita constructed 3D liver
tissue by stacking two-dimensional (2D) tissues (composed of hepatic plate-like tissue,
microvascular networks and intrahepatic bile ducts) on biodegradable microporous
PLGA membranes. The 3D liver tissue was formed by controllable degradation of PLGA
scaffolds afterimplantation (in vitro and invivo) [101].Anotherinteresting approachisthe
recovery of nerve functions with the use of polymer membranes. PLGA membrane coated
with PLL (poly(L-lysine)), PGA (poly(D-glutamic acid)) and nerve growth factor (NGF) was
tested to investigate the nerve regeneration after a crush injury in rats. The NGF-loaded
membrane was entirely biocompatible and enhanced the regeneration process
throughout the ﬁrst month after the lesion. However, the rate and dose of NGF released
from the membranes were unknown [102]. Modiﬁed polymer membranes can promote
guided bone and muscle regeneration. Liu et al. coated PCL ﬁbrous membranes by
mussel-inspired poly norepinephrine (pNE) to improve the regeneration of impaired rat
skeletal muscle (rectus abdominal muscle, in vivo) [103]. The pNE-functionalized PCL
membrane provided a better environment for cell adhesion and proliferation. It was
well-integrated with regenerated muscle and achieved mechanical properties similar to
native tissue. Polymer materials play a crucial role in guided bone regeneration (GBR). In
the GBR procedure, the membrane prevents the in-growth of soft tissue to the bone
defects and provides the defect space during tissue regeneration. Thus, membrane
material should prevent epithelial cells migration, and ensure a proper mechanical
property and resorption time after regeneration [104]. Among synthetic and natural
materials, crosslinked collagen-based polymers, silk, ePTFE, or aliphatic polyesters (e.g.
PLA, PGA, poly(ε-caprolactone), polydioxanone) are representative GBR membrane.
However, due to the high production cost and limited mechanical properties, the
development of new advanced polymers is vital for public health care [104]. Modiﬁcation
of polymeric membranes with bioactive compounds and/or stem cells can be useful for
the regeneration of tissues in periodontal therapy [105]. Goncalves and coworkers
designed a novel pol(isosorbide-succinate-co-L-lactide) (PisPLLA) membranes com-
bined with collagen, hydroxyapatite and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) growth
factor to promote the periodontal regeneration, as well as bone formation in fenestration
defects in rat jaws. The authors indicated that functionalized PisPLLA membranes
exhibited osteoconductive capacity and increased extracellular mineralization (in vivo
and in vitro studies). Therefore, this advanced membrane is a promising material for
guided tissue regeneration. Da Cunha et al. fabricated chitosan/carbon nanotube
membranes and chitosan/nanotube membrane mineralized with hydroxyapatite as
alternative implants for the regeneration of cranial defects in rats. The carbon nanotubes
signiﬁcantly improved the mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds. The in vivo
124
5 Polymeric membranes for biomedical applications

studies showed that designed implants were biocompatible, but did not indicate a
considerable osteoregenerative capacity for the stimulation of bone repair [106].
5.1.3 Controlled drug delivery
Polymer membranes can serve as a vehicle for the delivery of drugs, proteins, or nucleic
acids [107–110]. The main concept of all drug delivery systems is the controlled and
sustained release of bioactive compound to enhance the absorption of hydrophilic or
hydrophobic drugs at a speciﬁc site of the human body [107]. Among various routes,
oral drug delivery is recognized as the most preferred for drug administration. How-
ever, when administrated orally, the therapeutic substances should be protected from
degradation into physiological ﬂuids, induced mainly by the gastrointestinal tract and
ﬁrst-pass liver effects [109, 110]. In this context, polymeric membrane-based delivery
systems play an integral role in the advancement of drug delivery technology. A
therapeutic substance can be coupled to polymers or encapsulated in the membrane
structure to allow passive or active targeting and improve drug release kinetics.
Various polymers are commonly used for drug encapsulation, but only biodegradable
and non toxic ones are suitable for application as carriers. The most commonly applied
are polyesters, acrylic polymers and polyamides. In the form of microcapsules,
nanoparticles or thin ﬁlms, they can act as a vehicle in cancer therapy (including
targeted therapy), antibiotic therapy, analgesic therapies, etc. [111, 112]. The examples
of various polymers used for the encapsulation of therapeutic agents were presented in
Table 5.1.

5.1 Introduction

Current cancer therapies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy (or the combi-
nation of chemotherapy with radiation), immunotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted
therapy, or surgical intervention [124]. However, most chemotherapeutics leading to
elevated toxicity in normal cells, thereby increasing adverse side effects. To enhance the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of cancer therapy, chemotherapeutics can be targeted to the tumor
cell using various vehicles, including polymer microcapsules, scaffolds, hydrogels, or
polymer nanoparticles. Polymer nanoparticles can be made form (i) synthetic polymers,
such as PCL, PLA, or poly(styrene-maleic anhydride) copolymer, and (ii) natural poly-
mers, e.g. gelatin, starch, and collagen [125]. For instance, Han and co-worker fabricated
a drug delivery system based on amphiphilic copolymer nanoparticles consisting of
gelatin, PLA and 1,2- dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine (DPPE) to
encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX) [113]. The DOX-loaded gelatin-co-PLA-DPPE delivery
system exhibited anticancer efﬁcacy against human lung carcinoma cells (in vitro
studies) [113]. The release of drug from polymeric systems can be controlled by hydrolytic
or enzymatic biodegradation. Kumar et al. reported the release of dexamethasone from
the PLA composite ﬁlms (i.e. PLA-calcium carbonate and PLA-ferric chloride) in the
presenceandabsence of an enzyme. The inorganic salts wereembedded inPLA matrix to
provide a particular pH of media and regulate the biodegradation process. The
biodegradation of PLA composite ﬁlms in the presence of enzyme reached 20% and the
release ofdexamethasoneachievedaround80%(afterthreedaysoftheexperiment).The
authors showed that inorganic salts signiﬁcant inﬂuenced the enzymatic biodegradation
of PLA. Metal salts alterthe pH of the medium, thus regulate the rate of biodegradation of
polyesters [126].
Polymer nanocapsules may help to reduce the side effect associated with the
administration of drugs. Campos et al. encapsulated the articaine into PCL nano-
capsules to reduce unwanted symptoms during dental procedures, e.g. paresthesia or
nerve injury [118]. The articaine-loaded PCL nanoparticles showed high encapsulation
efﬁciency and colloidal characteristics optimal for the intrathecal administration of
local anesthetic drugs. These ﬁndings open the way for future clinical studies using
encapsulated drug formulations [118].
Microspheres made of natural polymers, such as starch, chitin or gelatin may protect
the active substance from the harsh environment of physiological fluids. The rate of drug
release depends on the size of the capsules. Larger microspheres release encapsulated
drug more slowly and over a longer period than smaller ones [121, 127, 128]. Bajpai et al.
presented studies dealing with the delivery of heparin encapsulated in swellable
crosslinked starch microspheres to reduce its degradation when administrated orally. It
was shown that the highest release of heparin was achieved in intestinal ﬂuid (pH 7.5). At
pH close to neutral starch microspheres showed enhanced swelling properties, thus
increased the heparin release. Under acidic conditions, i.e. in gastric juice (pH 1.0), the
microspheres did not swell sufﬁciently and the release of heparin was reduced accord-
ingly [121]. The results indicated that encapsulation of drugs into starch microspheres
may help to protect them from degradation into biological ﬂuids.

5 Polymeric membranes for biomedical applications

Polymer-based membranes can provide optimal conditions for wound healing [129].
The moist environment promotes cell regrowth and can result in a reduction of scar
formation[130]. Additionally,due to its occlusive properties, polymerdressing(called an
occlusive dressing), can act as a barrier to harmful contaminants, such as bacteria and
viruses [131]. Lopez-Calderon et al. designed bilayer membranes consisting of
PVP-gelatin (hydrophilic layer), and CA (hydrophobic layer), loaded with gentamicin to
improve the healing of infected wounds. The authors highlighted that those excellent
antibacterial properties are associated with the bilayer composition of the fabricated
wound dressing (in vitro studies). The hydrophilic layer in direct contact with injured
tissue reduced bacterial bioﬁlm formation and inhibited bacterial proliferation. On the
other hand, the hydrophobic layer served as a physical barrier to reduce bacterial
colonisation until solubilization [132]. Tong et al. fabricated a wound dressing made of
cellulose nanocrystals ﬁlm loaded with curcumin. Nanocellulose-based wound dressing
caused a signiﬁcant reduction of wound area from day 7 with the topical treatment of
curcumin-loaded ﬁlm (in vivo studies, diabetic rat models). The examination of skin
sample excised from the animal model also showed a reduction in bacteria growth of
99.99%, and regeneration of hair follicles and sebaceous glands n the dermis layer of the
skin [133]. Vimala et al. loaded curcumin into chitosan–PVA–silver nanoparticles ﬁlm to
enhance its antibacterial properties. The prepared nanocomposite ﬁlms revealed well
mechanical properties and superior antimicrobial activity against common bacteria and
fungi found on burn wounds, i.e. E. coli, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Candida albicus,
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (in vitro) [134].
Polymer materials can also act as carriers or recognition systems to facilitate
cytoplasmic delivery of therapeutics, based on nucleic acids [108]. Various natural and
synthetic polymers can be employed for the delivery of DNA, e.g. poly(D,L-lactide-co-
glycolide) (PLG), polyanhydrides, PEG, collagen, or hyaluronic acid (HA). The release
of DNA occurs usually through desorption, diffusion, polymer degradation, or a
combination of these variants [135]. Yun and coauthors reported the incorporation of
plasmid DNA (pDNA) into hyaluronan microspheres (5–20 µm) crosslinked by adipic
dihydrazine as a novel gene delivery system (Figure 5.9). Around 60% of DNA released
from HA microspheres after two months, due to degradation of crosslinked HA.
Moreover, the released DNA was able to transfect the cell and skeletal muscle of rat
(in vitro and in vivo studies) [136].
Plasmid DNA can be also encapsulated into biodegradable porous PLG micro-
spheres. The incorporated DNA retained its integrity and released from PLG spheres
within 24 h. The authors highlighted that pDNA-loaded PLG microspheres can be used
in tissue regeneration to allow cell seeding and facilitate the transport of nutrients
[137]. Polymer-based drug delivery systems are an interesting and promising option for
DNA vaccination. Denis–Mize et al. fabricated DNA vaccine formulation consisting of
pDNA attached to the microparticles made of PLG and cetyltrimethylammonium bro-
mide (CTAB, cationic surfactant) to study the transfection of dendritic cell in vitro and in
vivo [138]. Dendritic cells play a crucial role in the generation of the immune response

and demonstrate clinical efﬁciency in several types of cancer, e.g. melanoma, lung,
prostate, etc. [139]. It was reported that the presence of cationic surfactant (CTAB)
improved the transfection of dendritic cells, due to its interaction with DNA molecules.
The results indicate that modiﬁcation of polymers may imply a cellular response,
which is essential for the efﬁcacy of the vaccine [138].
One of the promising methods of gene delivery is adenoviral vectors [140]. However,
adenovirus may lead to the infection of various cells, limiting the targeting to the speciﬁc
tissues and organs. In order to reduce the possible interaction of the virus with healthy
cells and provide its high uptake in a speciﬁc site, the adenovirus can be encapsulated
into polymer microcapsules [141]. Sailaja et al. demonstrated encapsulation of human
adenovirus type 5 (HAd5) into alginate microspheres with a size ranging from 5 to 10 µm.
The sizeofmicrospheresallows themtobe easilytakenupby macrophages anddendritic
cells. Based on in vivo studies (mice model) it was shown that mice immunization
resulted in the development of virus-speciﬁc antibodies. However, encapsulation of
adenovirus caused effectively circumvented the vector-speciﬁc immune response [142].
Modiﬁcation of adenoviruses with polymers permits the incorporation of various tar-
geting molecules, such as tumors antigen, enzymes, and proteins. Fisher and coworkers
modiﬁed the surface of adenovirus by poly-[N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide]
(pHPMA)-based copolymer to protect it from antibodies action and incorporate of tar-
geting ligands, i.e. ﬁbroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. This
simple and cost-effective modiﬁcation effectively changed the cell tropism and inter-
action with the immune system (in vitro and in vivo studies) [143].

5.1.4 Sensors and diagnostic assays
Detecting analytes with high selectivity, sensitivity, and low detection limits is of
great interest in clinical diagnostics. Currently, two classes of polymer materials
are the topic of intensive studies for the construction of sensors: artificial polymer
vesicles (polymersomes, Figure 5.10), and planar polymer membranes (Figure 5.11)
[144].
Polymersomes can be defined as 3D nanosized compartments surrounded by a
stable synthetic membrane made of amphiphilic block copolymers. Hydrophilic
biomolecules can be encapsulated into the inner cavity of polymersomes, hydro-
phobic biomolecules can be entrapped into membrane matrix and both of these
bioactive compounds can be attached to the external surface of polymersomes
(usually by chemical modification of their surface) [145]. The planar membranes are
commonly made of copolymers, polymer composite or organic–inorganic hybrid
materials. The active components are usually immobilized into a polymer porous
membrane structure to improve the sensitivity of the sensor through improved signal
transduction [146].

5.1 Introduction
129

Polymer based-nanosensor allow sensing of various biological and chemical
analytes, from simple ions or inorganic particles to more complex ones, such as nucleic
acid, proteins, oligonucleotides, enzyme or even cells [147–150].
An important class of advanced materials in the development of sensors is con-
ducting polymers (CPs). CPs are polyconjugated polymers that possess mechanical
properties of synthetic polymers (i.e. strength, plasticity, or flexibility) with excellent
electrical conductivity. The most commonly applied conducting polymers include
polypyrrole, polythiophene, or polyaniline [151]. CPs are suitable for application in
electrochemical sensors, especially nucleic acids sensors because they can convert the
hybridization event into an electrical signal. A typical scheme of DNA electrochemical
sensor was presented in Figure 5.12. A DNA probe (e.g. speciﬁc oligonucleotides) was
attached to the conducting polymer surface connected with the transducer (e.g. plat-
inum or gold electrode). When the targeted DNA was captured by a speciﬁc probe, a
recognition signal was generated at the CP/electrolyte interface and passed to the
transducer through the CP layer [152].
A pivotal role in sensor application plays a special type of membranes known as
ion-exchange, ion-selective, or sometimes conductive membranes. They are key
components of potentiometric and chemical nanosensors. Ion-exchange membranes
consist of highly swollen polymers carrying fixed positive or negative charges. There
are three types of ion-exchange membranes: (i) cation-exchange membranes, which
contain negatively charged groups (e.g. –SO3
−, –COO−, –PO3
2−) ﬁxed to the polymer
matrix, (ii) anion-exchange membranes, which contain positively charged groups,

from [152].
130

such as –+NH2R, –+NR3, –+PR3, –+SR2, and (iii) bipolar membranes composed of cation-
and anion-exchange layers [153]. The ion-selectivity of these membranes is associated
with the presence of ion-exchange salts. The salts contain lipophilic ion enabling the
exchange of only its hydrophilic counter ion with ions of the same charge. Senapati and
coworkers designed an ion-exchange nanosensor made of divinylbenzene/polystyrene
particles embedded into a polyethylene-polyamide/polyester matrix for nucleic acid
detection using the charge inversion phenomenon. The negatively charged DNA oli-
goprobes were covalently attached to the positively charged surface of membranes.
The hybridization of targets with speciﬁc oligoprobes caused signiﬁcant changes in
current–voltage characteristics, allowing identifying and quantifying nucleic acid
molecules. This ion-exchange membrane-based nanosensor was able to speciﬁcally
detect RNA associated with oral cancer, as well as RNA of dengue virus, Brucella and
E. coli bacteria strains [154]. Jiang et al. designed a polymeric ion-selective electrode
(ISE) for the detection of Ca2+ ions. The surface of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-based
polymeric membrane ISE was modiﬁed with polydopamine to improve its hydrophilic
properties. The proposed modiﬁcation of the sensor surface signiﬁcantly reduced the
adhesion of blood components from blood samples, and thus enhanced its biocom-
patibility [155]. The class of conducting polymers can be also used for the production of
nanometer scale ﬁeld effect transistor (FET) [156]. In order to prepare FET, a thin ﬁlm of
conducting polymer is deposited on the nanoelectrodes to comprise the channel of the
transistor. Then, to create a FET biosensor, speciﬁc receptor molecules are attached to
the sensing transistor channel. Zhang and coauthors demonstrated FET nanobiosensor
for detection of single cells. The designed sensor consisted of polypyrrole thin ﬁlm
deposited on dual carbon nanoelectrodes. The sensing properties was achieved by
modiﬁcation of polypyrrole with hexokinase (adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-detecting
enzyme). It is well-known that various cells release ATP as a result of hypoxia or
osmotic stress, and its detection at a single cell may help to understand cancer cell
metabolism. The resulting FET-sensor was capable to monitor the real-time changes of
ATP concentration to cancer cells and cardiomyocytes (in vitro) down to 10 mM [157].
Polymer membranes can be also employed for the production of in vitro diagnostic
test, such as lateral ﬂow test strip assay (Figure 5.13) [159]. These assays are made for
the detection of various analytes, i.e. hormones, enzymes, drugs, but also bacteria and
viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 [160–163]. The main role of polymer membranes in
these lateral ﬂow tests is to provide support for the immobilization of labeled bioactive
molecules. Test most of the test strips are made of modiﬁed porous nitrocellulose-
based membranes. The sensitivity and selectivity of these assays can be improved by
modiﬁcation with targeting agents, as well as ﬂuorescent and/or metallic nano-
particles [158]. The analytes migrate on the test strip (polymer membrane) by capillary
force and are captured by immobilized molecules. These interactions result in colored
spots or line, pointing to the targeted analyte. Additionally, these assays are fast,
sensitive, and require no special equipment [164].

5.2 Conclusions
Future progress in polymer membrane technology has a significant impact on the
clinical success of tissue engineering strategies. Polymeric membranes have a huge
potential for biomedical application, however, there are still many studies necessary
to improve their final properties and many questions remaining to be answered. The
major limitations lie in the time and cost spent in the production of 3D biocompatible
constructs while maintaining their mechanical strength and surface properties.
Another barrier is associated with advanced fabrication techniques, which may hider
for a cost-effective upscaling of the membrane technology. In addition, the regulatory
safety aspects and membrane life cycle should be intensively investigated before any
of these membrane systems may be used in the clinic. In this context, the aspects
related to interactions of polymeric materials with body fluids are particularly rele-
vant. Important issues to consider are the influence of polymer-based systems on cell
adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as their degradation in the hu-
man body. The modification of polymer membranes with nanomaterials to improve
their physicochemical properties and biological activity may cause various adverse
effects on the immune system or oxidative stress-related disorders. Accumulations of
nanomaterials/nanoparticles in tissues and organs may induce mutagenesis and
carcinogenesis. Furthermore, advanced preclinical studies in large animals will be
indispensable in translating in vivo studies into medical applications within human
care diagnostics and treatments.

6 Liquid membranes for separation of metal
ions from wastewaters
Abstract: The paper reviews application of various liquid membranes (LM), particu-
larly of emulsion and supported liquid membranes, for metal separation from model
and industrial wastewaters. A variety of carriers and separation systems is shown. Not
only model solutions on a laboratory scale are presented but also some examples of
real wastewater separation with LM are reported.
Keywords: emulsion liquid membranes; liquid membranes; metal ion carriers; metal
separation; supported liquid membranes; wastewaters.
6.1 Introduction
In recent years, membrane techniques have become widely investigated and applied
for many separation processes due to the possibility of using this technology to remove
contaminants (especially metal ions) from waste solutions. The observed increase in
the use of membrane techniques is related to their continuous development, increased
environmental awareness and the fact that they can be used in processes where
commonly known methods are not efficient or selective.
The chapter focuses on a review of the composition of various liquid membranes
(LM) and their use (particularly of emulsion and supported liquid membranes) for
metal separation from model and industrial wastewaters. A variety of carriers and
separation systems is shown. Not only model solutions on a laboratory scale are pre-
sented but also some examples of real wastewater separation with LM are reported.
6.2 Classification of liquid membranes
Membrane operations are considered environmentally friendly and are recommended
as best available techniques by the European Union because they are simple in concept

and operation, modular, easy to scale-up and low-energy consuming with a remark-
able potential for an environmental impact, and energetic aspects [1, 2]. A membrane is
a barrier between two phases that enables a solute to be transported across the barrier.
Among various membranes, LM involve liquid immiscible with the feed (donor phase)
and receiving (acceptor) phases that serves as a semipermeable barrier between these
two liquid or gas phases. LMs are classiﬁed according to a module conﬁguration,
transport mechanism, application, type of carrier, and type of membrane support, as it
is shown in Figure 6.1. Module design conﬁguration, transport mechanism, and
membrane support type are considered in detail in the further part of the chapter.
Many carriers typically applied in LM are used as commercial extractants, and
some examples of the compounds used in a membrane phase are given in Table 6.1.
There are three main types of carriers [1, 5, 75–78]:
–
Acidic (chelating and nonchelating): The transport is based on the reaction of a
metal cation with an acidic extractant; a neutral complex is formed, here mainly
hydroxyoximes and alkylphosphoric acids are used,
–
Basic: The transport is mainly based on the addition or ion exchange reaction; an
ion pair is formed, basic carriers include quaternary ammonium or phosphonium
salts (many of them are classiﬁed as ionic liquids, ILs), tertiary amines, pyridine,
and its derivatives,
–
Solvating (neutral): The transport is based on solvation; a solvate or adduct is
formed; they include trialkylphosphine oxides or phosphoric acid esters.
An important specific group of carriers includes macrocyclic and macromolecular
compounds – calixarenes, resorcinarenes, crown and lariat ethers [79, 80]. Transport

with macrocyclic carriers is based on the size-selective complexation of a speciﬁc metal
ion, especially the alkali and alkaline ones. For examples, these carriers have been
reported to be applied for the selective removal of Sr-90 from nuclear waste solutions
with little cotransport of other ions [73]. Although LMs need smaller amounts of carriers
than the conventional extraction, the application of macrocyclic and macromolecular
extractants is strongly limited by high cost of the macrocycle carriers and their difﬁcult
use in a membrane module. Another approach to affect the extraction in LM is a
synthesis of various derivatives of common extractants which improves the selectivity
of transport of selected metal species. As an example multiple diglycolamide

6 Liquid membranes for metal ion separation

DGA-based extractants can be given, i.e. tripodal DGA (three DGA units pivoted on a
C-atom) or TREN-DGA/TRPN-DGA (three DGA units pivoted on a N-atom) [69, 70]. The
application of ionic liquids (ILs) as metal ion carriers in LM is also a part of the search
for improvement in the stability and effectiveness of the membranes [55–60].
These various carriers are applied in LM to separate diverse metal ions, including
alkali and alkaline metals (Cs+, Sr2+) [73], heavy metals (Pb(II), Zn(II), Co(II), Ni(II),
Cr(III), Cd(II), Cu(II), Hg(II)) [7, 13, 15, 16, 21, 30, 53, 78], rare Earth elements (Dy(III),
Nd(III), Eu(III), Y(III)) [18–20, 38], noble metals (Ag(I), Au(III), Pd(II), Pt(IV), Ru(III))
[35–37, 46, 59], Ge(IV), Ga(III), or actinides (U(VI), Am(III), Np(IV), Pu(IV)) [34, 43,
61–64, 69, 70] from model solutions and wastewaters.
A good carrier should be selective for the desirable solute, nonflammable,
nontoxic, biodegradable, cheap, stable, soluble in the organic phase and poorly sol-
uble in water, and easy to regenerate [81].
Metal species are transported from the feed phase (F) across the liquid membrane
(M or LM) to the receiving (stripping) phase (R) according to various mechanisms
(Figure 6.2). A solute (S) can be transported passively or the transport can be facilitated
by other compounds called carriers [1, 82]. An efﬁcient transfer of the solute is achieved
in the following steps: (i) Transfer of S from the feed phase to the LM as a result of
partitioning (passive transport) or chemical reaction (facilitated transport), (ii)
diffusion-driven transport across the membrane of S or its hydrophobic complex/ion
pair with the carrier (driven by concentration gradient of S at both sides of the
Figure 6.2: Schematic mechanisms of solute (S) transport in liquid membranes [1, 82, 83].
(F, M, R – stand for feed, membrane and receiving phases, respectively).

membrane), and (iii) transfer of S from the LM phase to the receiving phase and
regeneration of the carrier (if present). Maintaining high driving force in LM systems is
one of the main problems therefore various methods are applied to minimize solute
concentration in the receiving phase [82], e.g. (i) converting S transferred to the
receiving phase into another chemical species (complexation reactions or metal ion
reduction by electrolysis), (ii) inducing convective mass transfer (mechanical stirring
or ﬂow), and (iii) combining the mentioned approaches. Some methods to intensify the
transfer of S are shown in Section 3.2 (Table 6.5).
The passive transport (Figure 6.2a and b) corresponds to typical partition in solvent
extraction, while the facilitated transport (Figure 6.2c), like in reactive extraction, is
more selective and effective due to the carrier presence in the organic phase which is
responsible for the transfer of some speciﬁc solutes. Because of higher selectivity, the
facilitated transport mechanism is more common in the LM systems and is based on a
reversible chemical reaction between the solute and the carrier. As a result of the
reaction, only species forming a complex with the carrier are transferred from the feed
to the receiving phase, while other species (not reacting with the carrier) do not enter
the LM phase and stay in the feed [1, 84].
The facilitated transport can be realized by the mobile carrier according to carrier-
mediated systems: the mobile carrier (MC) or the fixed site carrier (FSC). The mobile
carrier freely diffuses across the liquid membrane (e.g. SLM, some of PIM), while in FSC
the carrier is bound with the polymeric matrix and its ability to move (to diffuse) is
limited. Some researchers report that the transport of the solute, for example in PIM, is
realized by “fixed-site jumping” [85, 86]. The complex formed by S and the carrier after
diffusion across the LM decays at the LM-R interface resulting in the release of S to the
receiving phase. Facilitated transport accelerates and positively inﬂuences the selec-
tivity of the transport.
Coupled counter-transport mechanism (Figure 6.2d) means the transport of metal
ions (e.g. Co(II), Zn(II) [17, 87]) accompanied by the transport of other chemical species
(e.g. protons as counterions) from the receiving to the feed phase (in the opposite
direction to the metal ion transport), which offers the possibility of transporting a
component against its concentration gradient. For example, lariat ethers transport
metal ions simultaneously with back transport of H+ ions and thus a pH gradient
provides the potential for metal ion permeation across the LM [79]. Fakhari et al. [87]
proposed 5,6,14,15-dibenzo-1,4-dioxa-8,12-diazacyclopentadeca-5,14-diene azacrown
ether (DBDA15C4) with two ionizable protons as a carrier for Zn(II) in BLM. It was
observed that pH of the feed decreased (from pH 7 to 3.5) during Zn(II) transport and the
receiving phase (containing histidine donating H+ to the carrier) pH increased to pH
above 7. This proton counter-transport mechanism is based on a protonation–depro-
tonation cycle of azacrown ether at the membrane interfaces of the receiving phase and
the feed, respectively. This cooperative effect enhances the proton driven selective
Zn(II) transport.

6 Liquid membranes for metal ion separation

In the co-transport (Figure 6.2e), for example for high feed acidity, anions can be
transported together with metal cations in the same direction. In both cases, ﬂuxes of
metal ions, protons, and anions are stoichiometrically coupled [1].
Active transport (Figure 6.2f) is driven mostly by irreversible reactions, e.g. oxida-
tion–reduction, catalytic reactions, and biochemical conversions on the membrane in-
terfaces [1]. Thanks to speciﬁc reactions this type of transport is highly selective.
6.2.1 Bulk liquid membranes (BLM)
Bulk liquid membranes (BLM) consist of a bulk aqueous feed and receiving phase
separated by a bulk organic, water-immiscible liquid phase. The phases may be
separated by microporous support or the phases may contact directly without micro-
poroussupport (then such a configuration iscalleda layered BLM – see Figure6.3). BLMs
are most often conﬁgured in U-shaped vessels or vessels with cylindrical partitions
(Figure 6.3). Such geometry of the vessels used requires that the organic phase has a
higher density than the aqueous phases. Due to the large thickness of the membrane
phase, the amount of a transported substance is small. For this reason, BLMs are of no
practical (industrial) importance and are used mainly to study transport mechanisms
and the inﬂuence of a carrier structure on the efﬁciency and selectivity of transport [50].
6.2.2 Emulsion liquid membranes (ELM)
6.2.2.1 First industrial plants
Emulsion liquid membrane was invented by Li [89] in 1968 for separating hydrocarbons
(a mixture of heptane and toluene, octane and isooctane, or octane and octene). Since
ELMs were invented, they have begun to be used in many separation processes (re-
covery and/or separation of metal ions and organic compounds, dyes, and drugs).

6.2 Classification of liquid membranes

The first liquid membrane industrial plant for Zn(II) removal from wastewater in
the viscous fiber industry was opened in 1986 at Lenzing, AG (Austria). The capacity
was 75 m3/h. The concentration of zinc ions in the wastewater was reduced from 500 to
3 ppm. Plants of much higher capacity (200–700 m3/h) using ELM to remove Zn(II) from
industrial wastewater were opened at Glanzstoff AG in Austria, CFK Schwarz in
Germany and AKZO Ede in the Netherlands [1, 90].
In 1986 for the first time on an industrial scale phenol was removed from waste-
water using ELM plant at the Nachung Plastic Factory in Guangzhou in China. Phenol
was reduced from 1000 to 0.5 ppm (extraction efﬁciency >99.95%). ELM on an
industrial scale was used also for cyanide removal from wastewater in gold processing
(Huang-Hua Mountain Gold plant, China) and extraction efﬁciency of 99.6% [1].
6.2.2.2 The composition of ELM
ELMs, also called surfactant liquid membranes, are generally multiple emulsions
formed by emulsifying two immiscible phases, i.e. oil-in-water-in-oil (O/W/O) system
or vice versa water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W). Two main types of multiple emulsions are
presented in Figure 6.4. As in the case of other liquid membranes, the difference of the
chemical potentials between the external feed phase and the internal receiving
(acceptor) phase is the main driving force of the solute transport through the
membrane.
ELM consists of three phases [1]:
–
Feed phase (external, aqueous phase),
–
Organic membrane phase,
–
Receiving phase (internal, aqueous phase).
The ELM stability depends on the stability of interfacial film whose stability depends on
the various factors such as the emulsion droplet size, method of emulsion preparation,
surfactant adsorption–desorption kinetics, intensity of mixing, concentration of ELM

components, concentration of the receiving phase, pH of the feed phase, phase
volumes, type of the used surfactant, carrier, and diluent [92, 93]. The size of the
droplets dispersed in the oil or water phase is an important parameter inﬂuencing the
ELM stability. It is reported that small droplets result in better breakage resistance and
enhance rapid extraction while large droplets reduce membrane stability and extrac-
tion efﬁciency. Generally, the average droplet sizes favorable in ELM are in the range of
1–10 μm. However, also nanoemulsion liquid membranes (NELM) with the droplet size
range of 20–200 nm, in some research up to 600 nm, have been reported for Ag(I)
extraction [94] or Pd(II) transport followed by formation of palladium nanoparticles
[95]. Droplets smaller than 0.98 μm are produced by ultrasounds and provide mem-
branes with high stability, large surface area, uniform droplet distribution, low-energy,
and low-surfactant consuming. However, too small droplets cause that it is very
difﬁcult to break the emulsion mechanically. In addition, too many of small droplets
packed into each organic globule result in too thin membrane and is easily broken.
Liquid membrane usually consists of three components: extractant (or carrier)
which transfers e.g. the valuable metal ions from external to internal phase, organic
solvent, and stabilizer (mainly surfactant) [4]. In the case of ELMs, emulsion W/O/W is
most common. Three steps for the ELM process are presented in Figure 6.5. In the ﬁrst
step (preparation of ELM), the receiving aqueous phase is emulsiﬁed in the organic
phase (liquid membrane). This emulsion is dispersed in the aqueous feed phase. As a
result, the two aqueous phases are separated by the liquid membrane and there is no
direct contact between those two aqueous phases. The organic phase contains a
hydrophobic surfactant which stabilizes the emulsion [4, 96].
In the second step, the solute is transported from a feed phase through the
membrane to a receiving phase. In comparison to liquid–liquid extraction, where
extraction and stripping are two different steps, in ELMs the extraction and stripping
occur simultaneously. As a result, the number of intermediate steps in the separation
process is reduced. The last step is separation of the external feed from emulsion 1 and
de-emulsification to recover the organic membrane phase [1, 96].

6.2.2.3 Advantages and disadvantages of ELM
The main advantages and disadvantages of ELM are presented in Figure 6.6. The most
important advantage of ELM is a large interfacial surface which guarantees a high rate
of mass transport. ELM can be used not only for separation and removal but also for a
concentration of solutes in the receiving solutions (when the volume of a receiving
phase is smaller than the volume of the feed). Also, the use of ELM is recommended
when the solute concentration is quite low, and other methods (e.g. extraction) cannot
be applied. As mentioned before, in ELM extraction and stripping are carried out in one
stage which is favorable from an economic and ecological point of view. Moreover, the
transport efﬁciency is high and the obtained products are of good purity and quality. In
comparison to other membrane techniques (e.g. pressure-driven membrane tech-
niques), ELMs are characterized by low-energy consumption [1, 51].
The main disadvantage of ELM process is maintaining stability of the emulsion. For
this reason, it is necessary to use emulsion stabilizers, e.g. surfactants. When the size of
a drop of the receiving phase is too large, the membrane can break during agitation.
Moreover, the membrane can swell due to the osmotic transport of water from the
continuous phase to the receiving phase and as a result the receiving phase becomes
diluted. In some cases, a slight loss of the carrier is possible due to its transport from the
organic to the aqueous phase [1, 51].
6.2.2.4 Surfactants
The desirable features from a good surfactant are the following: (i) membrane stabi-
lization during mixing of the emulsion in the reactor, (ii) reduction of the osmotic
transport of water between the phases, (iii) supporting the extraction of a component

from the feed phase to the receiving phase, and (iv) chemical stability [1]. Surfactants
are mainly organic compounds that consist of two elements:
–
A hydrophobic group (a tail),
–
A hydrophilic group (a head).
A hydrophilic group is soluble in the water phase, while a hydrophobic group is soluble
in the organic phase. Surfactants reduce the interfacial tension between the organic
and aqueous phases by adsorbing at the interface of both phases [1]. The classiﬁcation
and some examples of surfactants are presented in Table 6.2.
6.2.2.5 Carriers/extractants used in ELM
As mentioned before, an extractant (or carrier) is mainly responsible for the selective
diffusion transport of the solute from one phase, through the membrane, to the other
phase [97]. The types of extractants and examples of the transported metal species are
presented in Table 6.1. Two types of ELM are identiﬁed as type I – without a carrier and
type II – with a carrier. The separation mechanisms responsible for the solute transport
are as follows [1]:
a)
Simple permeation mechanism – based on the transport of a solute from one
aqueous phase to another aqueous phase through a liquid organic membrane
which separates these two phases (Figure 6.2a). The driving force of the process is
the concentration gradient of solute on both sides of the membrane. In the case of
type I, a component is soluble in all three phases: External feed phase, organic
membrane phase, and internal stripping phase. Solute diffuses from the feed
through the membrane into the stripping phase where it reacts and forms the
insoluble in the organic phase product (Figure 6.2b). This system is used for the
extraction of weak acids or bases from wastewater e.g. removal of phenol by NaOH
and removal of ammonia by H2SO4 [1].
b)
Facilitated transport mechanism – ELM type II is based on the transport of the
solute through the membrane by a selective carrier (Figure 6.2c). The carrier is

soluble only in the organic phase (membrane phase). The carrier reacts with the
solute at the membrane-external phase interface and forms a membrane-
soluble product. The product is transported through the membrane to the
membrane-internal phase interface and dissociates. This type of transport is
especially applicable to the separation or recovery of metal ions from waste-
water [1, 24, 32, 33, 40].
6.2.2.6 Diluents
The diluent (or solvent) is a liquid or homogeneous mixture of liquids in which
extractant and possible modifier (e.g. a surfactant) may be dissolved [97]. The most
common diluents used in the ELM are n-hexane, kerosene, cyclohexane, benzene,
toluene, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. A good diluent should dissolve the
extractant well, has low volatility, high ﬂash point, low surface tension, be insoluble in
the aqueous phase, cheap and readily available, and cannot form a third phase with
extracted compounds [1, 98].
6.2.3 Supported liquid membranes
Supported liquid membrane (SLM) consists of the polymeric porous support and liquid
membrane (an organic phase containing a carrier) placed in micropores of the support
fixed between two aqueous phases (F and R). SLM transport is limited by the con-
centration gradient between the feed and the receiving phase.
Typical configurations of SLM, a) sandwich module with flat sheet membrane and
b) tubular module with hollow fiber (HF) capillary membranes, are shown in Figure 6.7.
The stability of a long term operation of LM is an important issue considered when
these membranes are to be applied for metal ion transport. The long term performance
is affected by the chemical nature and textural characteristics of the polymeric support,
Figure 6.7: Scheme of supported liquid membranes [1, 82, 83, 88, 99].
152
6 Liquid membranes for metal ion separation

nature of the organic membrane phase, and method of the preparation of the mem-
branes [74]. Flat sheet membranes (used in sandwich-type modules) are impregnated
by immersing for some time (e.g. 12 or 24 h [21]) a membrane in an organic phase
containing a carrier, sometimes under pressure or vacuum. The drawback of this
impregnation method is lack of control of the carrier penetration into pores of the
polymeric support. It can be enhanced by ultrasounds which cause mechanical
vibrations and acoustic streaming. Acoustic cavitation generated by ultrasounds helps
to release dissolved in the organic phase gaseous nuclei and thus increase the amount
of the carrier present in pores of the membrane support [13]. Although in some systems
ion permeability values change marginally with time even in three weeks showing very
good stability [73], in most reported systems after a long time of working or several
cycles of transport experiments, a decrease in ﬂuxes of the transported species is
observed [13, 55, 70]. The loss of the organic phase from the membrane pores is indi-
cated as a drawback of the impregnated ﬂat sheet membranes and appears to be due to
weak interactions (capillary forces) between a carrier and the support material [2, 55].
The poor stability limits the long term use of SLM, especially in a ﬂat sheet conﬁgu-
ration [70]. To overcome the instability of the impregnated SLMs, polymer inclusion
membranes (PIM) – considered a special type of SLM – have been developed.
In PIM a carrier itself is built into the structure of the membrane and included in a
polymer matrix (mainly cellulose triacetate (CTA), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), or
poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)) with the addition of a
plasticizer or a modifier (Figure 6.8) [55, 57–60]. Good stability of PIM, limited loss of
carriers [44], high selectivity, and transport efﬁciency [71] compared to other types of
liquid membranes are the most important advantages which result in great interest
among various research groups investigating metal ion transport through LM. Also, a
small amount of a carrier is required which opens the possibility to use also expensive
extractants as ion carriers such as macromolecules or macrocyclic carriers (Table 6.1).
However, it must be emphasized that small values of ﬂuxes and low diffusion
coefﬁcients cause the transport long lasting what disqualiﬁes PIM from being used on a
large industrial scale for metal ion transport. At the same time, some researchers report
new and prospective use of PIMs on a laboratory scale for analytical applications
[102–104].
Figure 6.8: Composition of polymer inclusion membranes [1, 76, 77, 100, 101].
6.2 Classification of liquid membranes
153

Generally, loss of the organic phase from the membrane pores is indicated as a
drawback of not only impregnated flat sheet membranes but also of hollow fiber
membranes. Various causes are reported to affect the leakage of the organic phase out
of the membrane material [2]: (i) improper pressure difference between the organic and
aqueous phases, (ii) solubility of an organic phase in a feed and/or receiving phases,
(iii) wetting of membrane pores by the aqueous phases (F or R), (iv) blocking of the
membrane pores by precipitation of a carrier or by water, and (v) emulsion formation
by the organic phase in the aqueous phases by lateral sheer forces.
Nondispersive solvent extraction (NDSX) – contrary to a classical liquid–liquid
extraction called also dispersive solvent extraction, is realized in membrane modules/
contactors, preferentially hollow ﬁber (HF) ones, and the mass transfer occurs without
dispersion of one phase in another [105]. HF modules offer a large mass transfer area
due to their construction including a number (∼10,000) of very thin (capillary) ﬁbers
gathered around a central tube. HF modules are considered a good technical solution
because of the large area of mass exchange in a unit volume which means a small
footprint. Generally, the organic phase containing an extractant reacting with the
transported species ﬂows in the shell (outer) side, while the aqueous feed in the lumen
(tube) side. As the membrane is hydrophobic, the organic phase wets the pores of the
ﬁbers very well, however, a transmembrane pressure of 0.15–0.3 atm (0.015–0.03 MPa)
in the lumen side must be applied to avoid leakage of the organic phase to the aqueous
feed [67, 106]. In such a conﬁguration (with circulated organic phase) one HF contactor
is used for extraction, while the other one is necessary to strip extracted species to a
receiving phase and regenerate the organic phase. Some authors have proposed the
recycling of the organic phase after NDSX as a batch stripping operation. For example,
after Nd(III) extraction the loaded 0.3 M DNPPA and 0.13 M TOPO was contacted with
5.5 M H2SO4 in separating funnels to receive Nd(III) [106]. The stripping was effective
and the organic phase could be recycled to NDSX and showed excellent reproducibility
of extraction. Another operating mode of NDSX is impregnating the membrane pores
with the organic phase (LM) and circulating of the feed and receiving phases at both
sides of the porous support in the lumen and shell side of one HF module [39, 107].
Another technical solution of the extraction-stripping process is pseudo emulsion
based hollow ﬁber strip dispersion (PEHFSD), called also emulsion pertraction tech-
nology (EPT), which combines in one HF module extraction of the solute to an organic
phase and stripping to a receiving phase dispersed in the organic phase forming
pseudo emulsion [108, 109]. Similarly to PEHFSD, works supported dispersion liquid
membrane (SDLM) with ﬂat sheet poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF) diaphragm [18]. A
schematic representation of the transport applying pseudo emulsion is shown in

The stripping phase dispersed in the organic phase enables surface renewal and
thus, such a membrane system has increased stability compared to a classical SLM,
simplicity of operation, and very efficient stripping of the target species from the
organic phase which leads to high flux and high concentration of the recovered

species. In the case when the stirred mixture of the organic and stripping phases flows
at a high aqueous/organic volume ratio through the lumen side of the HF module, the
technique is called hollow ﬁber renewal liquid membrane (HFRLM) [110–112]. While
ﬂowing through the lumen side of HF, the dispersion of the organic droplets in the
stripping phase forms a thin organic ﬁlm in the internal (lumen) side of ﬁbers. The sheer
force causes the ﬁlm liquid to form microdroplets on the surface of the liquid mem-
brane layer, which enter into the lumen side ﬂuid after peeling off from the surface of
the LM layer. Simultaneously, the organic droplets ﬁll the surface of the liquid ﬁlm and
thus the renewal of the LM is continuously proceeding. HFRLM is reported to enhance
the mass transfer rate and reduce the diffusion resistance across the aqueous boundary
layer within the HF lumen side [110, 112].
The transport of metal ions through EPT (with strip dispersion) involves various
steps [18, 109]: a) diffusion of metal species from the feed phase to the membrane
interface embedded in the pores of the hydrophobic support, b) reaction with a carrier
and extraction of metal species on the feed-membrane interface, c) metal-carrier
complex diffusion through the membrane to the interface between the organic and the
droplets of the receiving phase, d) stripping (back-extraction) reaction of the extracted
metal ions from the liquid membrane phase to the dispersed receiving solution, and

membranes (HFRLM) [18, 75, 108–110].

e) back diffusion of the carrier to the feed-membrane interface. The transported metal
ions are recovered from the aqueous receiving phase after pseudo emulsion settling.
It was proven that EPT conﬁguration overcomes NDSX in terms of zinc and iron
separation kinetics [67], although separation selectivity was higher for NDSX conﬁg-
uration, αZn/Fe = 22, compared to EPT process αZn/Fe = 15.
The choice of polymeric support type influences the permeability, stability, and
lifetime of the SLM. Some commonly used supports are characterized in Table 6.3.

6 Liquid membranes for metal ion separation

6.3 Application of liquid membranes for separation
of metal ions from model or real wastewaters
In this section, several examples of metal ion separation from the model or real
wastewaters with ELM or SLM are presented in Tables 6.4 and 5. Applications of BLM
are not shown here because these systems have only cognitive goal realized on a
laboratory scale and the results from BLM are then transferred to a large scale into SLM
systems. Extraction-stripping of metal ions in membrane modules is indicated as a very
promising technique for waste treatment within urban mining [2]. PIM applications are
not discussed in the chapter because, in spite of a large number of publications in this
ﬁeld, PIMs seem not to have perspectives for an industrial application for wastewater
treatment, except analytical uses. Applications of the LM techniques are presented in
Figure 6.10.
6.3.1 ELM applications
ELMs have great potential especially for the recovery and removal of various metal
ions, dyes, or organic compounds, such as citric acid transport [135], lactic acid re-
covery [136], and removal of acetic acid [137] from wastewater when the other tech-
niques cannot be applied. The use of ELM in biomedical and biochemical industries
(recovery of fermentation products, puriﬁcation of antibiotics, e.g. penicillin [138]) has
the great potential [90]. ELM can be also used to neutralize wastewater from industries
e.g. for phenol removal (an industrial installation built in China in the late 80s) [88, 90].
Various examples of ELM application for the separation of metal ions are presented
in Table 6.4. The most commonly used surfactant, stabilizing the emulsion, is Span 80,
and kerosene is the most commonly used solvent. The main focus of various researches
is on the selection of various extractants depending on the metal ions that were to be
separated. ELMs were successfully used in the removal of numerous types of metal
ions: Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), Cr(III) and Cr(IV), Ce(IV), Hg(II), U(VI),
Ag(I), Pd(II), Ga(III) both from model solutions and wastewater (Table 6.4).
Not only a carrier and a surfactant but also a diluent play a very important role in
the transport with ELM. Kerosene is the most commonly used as an organic diluent but
with harmful to humans and not environmentally friendly. Therefore some vegetable
oils (such as palm oil, sunflower oil, soyabean oil, sesame oil, and corn oil [51, 91]) have
been investigated and shown to have great potential for use in chemical processes and
could be an alternative to the commonly used kerosene. Palm oil was used for the
extraction of heavy metals [51, 139], dyes [140], and phenol [141].

6 Liquid membranes for metal ion separation

6.3.2 SLM applications
Examples of the variety of SLM systems applied for metal ion transport either from the
model or real waste solutions are presented in Table 6.5. Typically kerosene or VOCs
(volatile organic compounds) are applied as solvents to prepare the liquid (organic)
phase for LM; however, novel solvents are also investigated to make the LM more
environmentally friendly, more stable and/or more efﬁcient. Among the novel systems
are supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS) characterized by high water-immiscibility, low
vapor pressure and high tendency to dissolve the carrier, and its metal ion complex and
high wettability of the polymeric support. SUPRAS composed of vesicles of decanoic
acid in the presence of tetrabutylammonium ion (Bu4N+) was applied as a solvent for
dibenzyl-diaza-18-crown-6 (DBzDA18C6) for Ag(I) transport across ﬂat sheet SLM [74].
SURPAS is considered easily tunable due to a variety of hydrophobic or polar groups of
the surfactant components. Also, SUPRAS contain high concentrations of amphiphiles
with many binding sites and ensures high extraction efﬁciencies at low extractant
volumes.
Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are considered a new generation of green and sus-
tainable solvents. They possess the advantages of ionic liquids (low vapor pressure,
tunability, high chemical and thermal stability), and overcome some limitations of ILs.
They are reported to be less toxic, more biodegradable, cheaper, and have a lower
environmental impact than ILs. Thanks to the mentioned properties SUPRAS and DES
stabilize LM in PP support and ensure SLM operation for a couple of cycles [74, 127].
Sunflower oil has been selected among other tested vegetable oils (i.e. coconut oil,
mustard oil, sesame oil, and soybean oil) as a green solvent for organic phase prepa-
ration. This oil is a low cost, immiscible with the aqueous phase, has low volatility, and
low viscosity, these properties ensure environmental and physiological benignity of
the LM separation with vegetable oil-based organic phases. Sunflower and coconut oils
were proven to be good solvents in LM containing basic carriers (Aliquat 336, TOA) for
the transport of Ni(II), Zn(II), Cr(VI) in SLM or Pb(II), and Cd(II) in BLM [21, 50, 142].
EPT (PEHFSD) has been proven to be an efficient technology to remove and recover
selectively zinc from wastewaters produced by the surface treatment industry,

e.g. spent pickling solution generated in the hot-dip galvanizing process or spent
chromium-based passivation baths [109].
An integration of EPT to the passivation step of the Zn electroplating process on an
industrial scale has been implemented in a company and reported to be an efficient
operation to purify the real Cr(III) including baths from the Zn(II) and Fe ions
(Figure 6.11). The process is ﬂexible and is applicable for passivation baths of various
compositions [131].
Different mathematical models for metal ion transport have been developed [61,
62, 84, 137]. They are not considered in this chapter, however, it is noteworthy that
many of them assume that the complexation reaction between metal ions and ligands
at the aqueous-membrane interface is instantaneous and diffusion of the metal–ligand
complex through the pores of the membrane (membrane thickness) into the bulk of the
organic phase or across the LM to the receiving phase is the rate-determining step
[106, 107].
Additional operations are employed or follow the membrane process to overcome
diffusion limitations and increase the driving force, and thus the effectiveness, of the
separation processes. Strip dispersion in the liquid membrane phase forming pseudo
emulsion (PEHFSD, described in Section 2.3) can be considered as such an approach.
Another proposal to improve the solute transfer is further processing of the receiving
phase. For example, electrodialysis (ED) prevents the increase in metal ion concen-
tration in the receiving solution, thus preventing the decrease in the membrane sep-
aration driving force [48]. Also, an electrodeposition (electrowinning, EW) of metal
ions (e.g. nickel and zinc) stripped to the receiving phase makes it possible to keep
constant driving force and, additionally, both to separate toxic heavy metals from
wastewater and to obtain valuable metallic products [21]. The idea of the integrated LM
and EW is shown in Figure 6.12.
NDSX with ED configuration provides recovery of all the possible valuable prod-
ucts present in wastewaters, e.g. from model spent pickling wastewater: coagulant

6 Liquid membranes for metal ion separation

FeCl3 diluted electrolyte for zinc electrowinning and recyclable HCl solution [65]. The
role of ED lies in selective separation of Zn(II) from concentrated HCl solution.
Another approach to improve LM performance on a large scale and overcome low
stability, leakage of the organic phase in the aqueous phases, as well as a small contact
area, is called a multimembrane hybrid system (MHS) or hybrid liquid membrane
(HLM). The MHS combines some properties of the ion-exchange and liquid membranes
and consists of a liquid membrane containing a selective carrier, two cation-exchange
membranes placed at the interfaces of the LM, aqueous feed and receiving phases. MHS
is a beneficial membrane system due to mechanical stability in a long-time continuous
operation and protection LM from direct contact between the aqueous and organic
solutions. Placing LM between two CEMs makes it possible to use carriers with sig-
nificant solubility in water [133]. In such a system an increase in the removal efﬁciency
of metal ions and mass transfer ﬂux results from the enhancement in overall mass
transfer rate, which is considered as an effect of positive ﬁxed charges in the pores of
the charged supporting membranes [134].
Hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane (HFRLM, mentioned in Section 2.3) has
been considered as a scale-up for an industrial process instead of a ﬂat sheet SLM [111].
SLM has been proposed as an additional step preventing loss of REE in the leaching of
YOX ﬂuorescent lamp wastes and improving recovery of the valuable metals, especially
Eu(III) and Y(III) [129]. A scheme of the process is shown in Figure 6.13. After the ﬁrst
Figure 6.12: Integrated liquid membrane – electrowinning (LM-EW) system for metal ion transport [21].

step of metal leaching from waste ﬂuorescent lamps, the leach solution contained a
large amount of Ca(II) and a small quantity of REE. To avoid loss of REE, a recovery by
ﬂat sheet SLM (Cyanex 923 as REE carrier) from the leach solution was incorporated
into the ﬂowsheet of the waste treatment. The scale-up from laboratory SLM to in-
dustrial process with HFRLM assumed 95% REE recovery from 1 m3 of a solution after
leaching 100 kg of the ﬂuorescent lamp waste with 33 m2 membrane area at perme-
ability coefﬁcient near 4·10−6 m/s [129].
6.4 Summary
Low operating and investment costs, minimum product contamination, no phase
separation requirement, selectivity; flexibility; and easy modularization, and low
energy consumption are the reported advantages of SLM [74]. Extraction and stripping
are carried out in one stage which is favorable from an economic and ecological point
of view. They are characterized by no back mixing/ﬂooding and theoretically no loss of
organic carriers if a support membrane is used [2, 18], high mass transport ﬂuxes
resulting from high diffusion coefﬁcients in LM, possibility to use expensive and
selective carriers because small volumes of organic phase as a membrane phase. SLMs
show high separation coefﬁcients and opportunity to concentrate the transported
solute. Although LMs (ELM, SLM) are perceived as more environmentally friendly than
traditional separation techniques (liquid–liquid extraction) due to many advantages,

they are not still widely applied on an industrial scale. Despite the LMs are considered a
promising technique for the recovery of metal ions or organic compounds, they still
have not been adopted on large scale in industrial processes due to their drawbacks
such as problems with long-term stability, difﬁculty in operation of emulsiﬁcation and
de-emulsiﬁcation in ELM and strip dispersion (pseudo emulsion) techniques, and large
membrane resistance in HFSLM [18].
New carriers and solvents (e.g. vegetable oils as natural diluents) are proposed to
improve selectivity of the solute transport and environmental friendliness of the sep-
aration systems. To improve stability and performance of the LM, especially of SLM,
new membrane materials, new configurations of membrane operations and/or inte-
gration of LM with other operations to increase or keep constant the driving force, are
investigated which might be interesting both for researchers and industry. Some ex-
amples of ELM on a large scale for removal of organic compounds indicate that these
liquid membranes have the greatest potential of industrial application also for metal
ion removal from wastewaters.

7 Membrane-based processes in essential oils
production
Abstract: Essentialoilsarecompoundsextractedfromplantswhichareusuallyutilizedto
produce perfumes, soaps, lotions, and flavorings as well as other well-being or aroma-
therapy products with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Membrane technology
has been proposed as a method for purification of essential oils extract from waxes fats,
lipids, or chlorophyll to avoid the formation of precipitate in finished essential oil-based
products.Furthermore,nanofiltrationprocesseshavebeenrecommendedforfractionation
and concentration of essential oils raw materials to enhance their valuable properties.
Keywords: aromatic materials; essential oils; membranes.
7.1 Essential oils
Essential oils are aromatic materials of vegetable origin. They are complex mixtures of
over 100 components synthesized through secondary metabolic pathways of plants as
communication and defence molecules. Commonly, essential oils play crucial roles in
direct and indirect plant defences against herbivores and pathogens, in plant reproduction
processes through attraction of pollinators and seed disseminators, and in plant ther-
motolerance. They occur in various parts of plants [1]. For example, vetiver oil has been
extracted from roots, cinnamon oil was detected in bark, sandalwood oil has been ob-
tained from heartwood, bay oil has been found from leaves, peppermint oil has been
achieved from herbs, nutmeg oil has been obtained from seeds, while lavender oil has
been produced from ﬂowers. Following the ISO standards 4720:2018 and 9235:2013 rules

they are classiﬁed as the product gained by steam distillation of plant parts (leaves,
ﬂowers, branches), by mechanical cold-pressing of the peels of citrus fruits, or by dry
distillation, after separation of the aqueous phase (when exists) by physical means. The
global essential oils market size is expected to reach a value of 16.0 billion USD by 2026
comparing, while in terms of volume, the market is expected to reach at 345.4 kT by 2026.
Essential oils are typically used to create perfumes, soaps, lotions, and ﬂavorings.
Essential oils have also been used as antimicrobial additives in food due to their antiox-
idant and antimicrobial properties, which attract interest as preservative in the nutrition
sector. Moreover, due to their antiseptic properties, they have been wildly applied in
traditional and folklore remedies. Besides, their proved capacity as nematocidal, anti-
bacterial, antifungal, insecticidal or, even, herbicidal as well as insect repellent have
attracted high interest from agriculture industry, especially from organic farming. Indeed,
Tylkowski and co-inventor in the patent application WO/2022/029238A1 disclosed
encapsulation of essential oils in hybrid organic–inorganic capsules shells for consumer
good products and agriculture applications. Currently the knowledge and know-how on
essential oils encapsulation, protected in the WO/2022/029238A1 patent application has
been applied in BioHortiTech – “Improved bio-inocula and living mulching technologies
for integrated management of horticultural crops” project. According to European regu-
lations,inorganicagriculture,farmersareonlyallowedtousenaturallyderivedpesticides,
made from plants, animals, microorganisms, or minerals. It is important to underline that
the most essential oils are reasonably nontoxic to mammals and aquatic life, and they can
be categorized as low-risk pesticides. It means that they could present low toxicity against
non-target organisms. This aspect is important to remark for environmental-friendly
agricultural production following the Horizon Europe strategy launched under Chal-
lenges: “Food Security, Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry, Marine and Maritime and
Inland Water Research, and the Bioeconomy”. Therefore, various essential oils can be
considered for the development of innovated plant protection products. Moreover, addi-
tional factors such as improvements in the standard of living along with increase in
demand for aromatherapy are some of the driving points to the growth of the market for
essential oils. Indeed, aromatherapy is a form of complementary and alternative therapy.
In order to improve the essential oil delivery in consumer good products, development of
biodegradable andnon-toxiccapsulesisrequired.Encapsulationofessentialoilsinamain
aim of GreenCap project, ﬁnanced by Spanish Government, which the pursue is to improve
the leadership and excellence of the Spanish company in the development of detergents
and cleaning products that do not generate microplastics.
7.2 Purification of essential oils
Essential oils are complex substances which contain multiple high value chemical
species, most of them with organoleptic properties useful in the food and beverage
industry, and the flavor and fragrance industry, for example.

7 Membrane-based processes

These oils are isolated from plant materials through two main procedures:
hydrodistillation or extraction with an appropriate hydrophobic solvent depending on
the oil properties and where they are located in the plant (petals, bud/leaf, stem or
root). In all cases the technique used generates a multicomponent solution. Valuable
chemicals of the oil must often be further isolated to obtain the product of interest.
Many applications require the removal of these natural and synthetic impurities [2].
Patents EP3677328A1, US10934501B2, EP1003537B1 describes that the impurities
present in the crude solution may be natural or synthetic ones, such as: environmental
pollutants, agrochemical residues, extractable compounds from packaging additives,
plant sterols, lipophilic hormones, waxes, colored components, oxidation products, vi-
tamins, and components that create undesired odor and taste in the oil, such as aldehydes
and/or ketones. In at least one embodiment, while the removal of colored substances
result in enhances the color of the oil, the removal of components responsible for unde-
sired odor and taste enhance the organoleptic profile of the oil. Regarding the environ-
mental pollutants they could include: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), non-ortho-
PCBs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dioxins,
furans, or heavy metals. Finally, agrochemical residues are mainly composed by pesti-
cides, mostly organochloride-based compounds used widely in intensive agriculture for
decades. Among them, there are: aldrin, cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane oxy-chlordane,
dieldrin, endosulfan-1, endrin, heptachlor, heptachlor-endo-epoxide, heptachlor-exo-
epoxide, isodrin, lindane, or mirex. When processing the crudes the first step is focused on
the elimination of waxes, fats, lipids, or chlorophyll to avoid the formation of any pre-
cipitateinfinalessentialoil-basedproducts.Forexample,theprocesstoeliminatewaxesis
known as dewaxing or winterization and it is described in patent applications EP0278693
and EP0278693A2 and in [3]. It is expected that dewaxed material can stand stable at 4 °C
for a prolonged period. During dewaxing the crude essential oil is refrigerated to tem-
peratures between −10 °C. and −40 °C, letting waxes to crystallize. Then wax crystals are
settled under gravity. Because of the slow velocity of crystallization and the low-density
difference between the solid wax and crude oil, this process may require several weeks.
Additionally,obtainedsemi-productofthewinterizationprocesscanalsobecentrifugedto
remove any remaining wax. Despite of fact that high energy consumption for refrigerating
andtimeconsumingmakesexpensivedewaxing process,thishavebeenwidelystudiedfor
vegetable oil applications and in biodiesel production for its excellent results as a puriﬁ-

disclosed a method of dewaxing a citrus oil by a filtration process. This technology
consists in flowing the citrus oil parallelly to a porous membrane surface at a tem-
perature of less than 11 °C. According to the inventors, a suitable membrane should be
composed by ceramic, metal, graphite, or a combination of polymer on ceramic, zir-
conia on graphite, titanium dioxide on stainless, or polymer on a different polymer
support. Those inventors recommend using membranes for the ultraﬁltration (with a

molecular weight cut-off in the range 2000 Da to 2,000,000 Da) or microﬁltration (with
a pore diameter of 0.2 μm and larger). Well-known commercial products suitable for
this process include the FICL ﬁlter of Doulton USA and the Membralox™membranes of
Pall Corp., USA. Moreover, all such membranes and any associated supporting
apparatus are generally available in modular form for easy installation and
replacement.
As mentioned before, processing many essential oils for reducing the content of
impurities present in the crude may require several separation methods. Due to the
heterogeneity of impurities, they cannot be reduced with just one unit operation. The
current state-of-the-art for removing the synthetic ones is employing different unit
operations that may include use of adsorbents or washing the oil with aqueous solu-
tions. As a matter of example, contaminant residues frequently identified in essential
oils extracted from Sicilian citrus are generally: imazalil, ortophenylphenol, thiaben-
dazole, parathion, or malathion, which could be classified as antifungal or phospho-
rated pesticides products, respectively. These pesticides are characterized by a very
low water solubility and high solubility in citrus essential oils; thus, these active
compounds are not removed from the peel with the process water and remain in the
essential oil owing to their low polarity and physicochemical properties. Consequently,
conventional purification techniques, although capable to remove pesticides from
citrus essential oils, could determine significant modification of their composition
making them unsuitable for commercial purposes. Therefore, research efforts are
required to decrease the pesticide content of essential oils without modifying their
chemical and organoleptic characteristics. Cassano and co-workers [6] reported that
the use of polyacrylonitrile hollow ﬁber membranes loaded with triacetyl-β-cyclo-
dextrin can be proposed as a viable method to reduce the content of some pesticides
from mandarin, orange and lemon essential oils. The authors demonstrated that the
used membrane did not modify the organoleptic and physicochemical characteristics
of the tested essential oil. They also reported that on the contrary, the treatment of
orange essential oil with ceramic membranes having a molecular weight cut-off be-
tween 750 and 1000 Da produced a removal of 5–10% of the volatile fraction, a removal
of the non-volatile fraction in the range of 10–50% (especially in terms of cumarines)
and a removal of carotenoids higher than 90%.
United States Patent 10202562 describes the process based on membrane tech-
nology for (i) reducing the content of impurities, i.e., undesirable natural components
or other from synthetic origin; or (ii) fractionation of natural components present in an
essential oil using at least one selective membrane. The inventors of this patent showed
that removal of pesticides can be achieved by applying the lower molecular weight cut-
off membrane DuraMem™S XP2. They demonstrated the potential of the process
disclosed to remove agrochemical residues from essential oil. Additionally, they put
into evidence the potential beneﬁts of applying sequentially selectively permeable
membranes. According to the United States Patent 5234579, the dewaxed oils can be
additionally puriﬁed by separating elastomer membrane with a non-porous separating

membrane layer. Peev et al. [7] disclosed the use of organic solvent nanoﬁltration
membranes for the concentration of a rosmarinic acid extract from lemon balm. The
authors reported that no membrane fouling has been observed and satisfying ﬂux has
been realized at pressure of 30 bar up to retentate concentration near to rosmarinic acid
solubility. During these studies the authors carried out the dead-end nanoﬁltrations
experiments using a nanoﬁltration equipment provided by Evonik Membrane Extrac-
tion Technology, UK, shown in Figure 7.1.
This setup is based on a 270 mL stirred cell with a pressure regulator and an
effective membrane area of 54 cm2. During the experiments the stirrer revolutions were
kept constant at 350 rpm, in order to minimize the concentration polarization.
By employing the same setup, Tylkowski and co-workers [8] reported the appli-
cation of organic solvent nanoﬁltration membranes for concentrating an aqueous
ethanolic extract of propolis or Sideritis ssp. L [9, 10]. These disclosures pertain the fact
that free fatty acids are easier dissolved in ethanol than triglycerides to produce an
ethanol extract enriched in free fatty acids. Afterward, the membrane is used for sep-
aration of free fatty acids from the ethanolic extract. Both, Peev and co-workers as well
as Tylkowski et al. during the experiments used DuraMem® membranes. They are
solvent-resistant polymeric membranes designed to be used in Organic Solvent
Nanoﬁltration (OSN) applications. These membranes perform best ﬁltrations in polar

and polar aprotic solvents and have a wide cutoff range, from 150 to 900+ Da. Dura-
Mem® membranes are typically used in ﬂat sheet format for lab-scale membrane
screening tests and in spiral wound format for pilot and commercial processes. The
OSN technology has been designed to recovery of some aroma raw materials from plant
extracts instead of the whole essential oil. It means that such plant extracts cannot be
compared to feedstocks consist of the whole essential oil, i.e., all components of the
essential oil. It is well known that some of these components may be vulnerable to
thermal degradation. Processes involving the membrane technologies may be carried
out at near-ambient or sub-ambient temperature conditions while many of the other
known methods of puriﬁcation involve higher temperatures, which could be damaging
to the thermally sensitive compounds, i.e., the thermally-sensitive compounds are
converted to different chemical molecules which decreases their yield and may also
modify the organoleptic or physicochemical properties of the essential oil.
The use of reverse osmosis membrane combined supercritical carbon dioxide
seems to be an excellent alternative to traditional methods of separation and purifi-
cation. Indeed, Araus and Temelli [11] demonstrated that by using this system tri-
acylglycerol and α-tocopherol/β-sitosterol can be separated from oleic acid. The
authors reported that the use of cross-ﬂow regime can reduce effectively the accu-
mulation of solutes on the membrane surface and competently help to mitigate the
reduction on the ﬂux. Sarmento et al. [12] also showed that the reverse osmosis
membranes can be used to concentrate essential oils from supercritical carbon dioxide.
The authors used commercial reverse osmosis membranes supplied by Osmonics USA
for the separation of lemongrass, orange, and nutmeg essential oils from supercritical
mixtures with CO2. The extraction and separation pilot plant employed by the authors
is schematically represented in Figure 7.2.
Carlson and co-workers [13, 14] as well used this process to separate supercritical
carbon dioxide from limonene. The authors demonstrated the membrane application
for recovery and concentration of essential oils from a solvent matrix. Dupuy and co-
workers [15, 16] also disclosed the application of membrane technologies to deliver
emulsion-free extraction of essential oil raw materials from lemon oil by using aqueous
ethanolic solutions. It is important to highlight that in this protocol the quality of
separation was regulated by the aqueous ethanolic extraction solvent and not by the
ﬁlm properties. The ﬁlm was utilized to stabilize the interface between the aqueous
ethanolic solution and the lemon oil. Recovery of raw material compounds from
essential oil from solid/liquid matrices by employing membrane-based processes is
also well-known. Pervaporation can be applied to recuperate aroma raw materials
under mild conditions. The pervaporation can be considered as a separation process
due to its signiﬁcant potential to purify thermolabile compounds (that degrade/
decompose in high temperatures) or mixtures that form azeotropes. The process is
based on application of dense (non-porous) hydrophobic ﬁlm, which possesses a
higher afﬁnity to the volatile compounds, capable to separate e from a liquid mixture
selected aromatic raw materials such as: ketones or aldehydes. The separation process
192
7 Membrane-based processes

occurs due to the differentiation of individual components in the membrane (sorption)
and the differences depending on their diffusion through the membrane. Indeed, it is
an alternative technology to reverse osmosis. It does not require pressure reduction on
the permeate side; however, it is often reduced to improve the process. Though the
pervaporation is already applied in some segments of essential oil industry, the growth
of pervaporation membranes to fractionate or/and separate organic compounds still
requires a technological improvement that permits the direct pervaporation of raw
essential oil (without the necessity of aqueous or hydroalcoholic mixtures) to replace
the vacuum fractional distillation. The two main challenges of pervaporation mem-
brane technology are:
–
the development & commercialization of improved ﬁlms which are durable,
chemically resistant, and with appropriated selectivity to the compounds of
interest.
–
the employment of the pervaporation in hybrid technologies in order to, improve
the overall efﬁciency of various ‘traditional’ separation and puriﬁcation technol-
ogies [17].

7.2 Purification of essential oils
193

Du et al. [18] applied pervaporation technology by using poly(ether-block-amide)
(PEBA) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes for separation limonene,
linalool, and perillaldehyde from perilla essential oil. Yi and Wan [19] investigated
recovery of volatile organic compounds from aqueous solutions via pervaporation with
vinyltriethoxysilane-grafted-silicalite-1/polydimethylsiloxane mixed matrix mem-
brane. Actually, more than 70 various types of aromatic raw materials which include
esters, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and hydrocarbons have already been fractionated
or concentrated from different sources by means of pervaporation membranes [20].
Since pervaporation does not involve any chemical solvents and operates at
moderate temperatures, it provides a green process for extracting valuable volatile
compounds. According to inventors of US Patent Application 20090191309 on “Process
for recovering aroma from tea”, pervaporation or reverse osmosis can be used for
concentration of aroma. However, the processes can be appreciated when the aroma
condensate comprising less than 0.1% by weight of solids allows concentration of
aroma while substantially reducing the fouling of membranes.
Silvestre and co-workers [21] have proposed a use of chitosan membranes in
pervaporation technologies for aroma compounds separation/concentration.
However, following the current state of art, it is challenging to ﬁnd some scientiﬁc
papers which describe the use of chitosan-based membranes in the separation/
fractionation of essential oil components in a feed stream composed by pure
essential oil, a method that, if effective, could lead to novel and outstanding
products, covering different brands focused on innovation in food, pharmaceuti-
cals cosmetics, and chemical sectors. Up to now, chitosan and its derivatives have
been applied to protect the essential oils from degradation in contact oxygen or
light by means of encapsulation technology. Applications of chitosan-based carrier
as an encapsulating agent in food industry was investigated by Maleki et al. [22]
while Zhang and co-workers [23] reported anti-bacterial activity of chitosan-loaded
plant essential oil against multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.
Figoli and co-workers [24] highlighted that pervaporation is one of the most
investigated and implemented membrane technology for the fractionation, sepa-
ration of recovery of aroma raw materials from fruit juices, as well as from industrial
mixtures or from alcoholic beverages. The authors studied application of poly-
sulfone,
poly(vinylidene
ﬂuoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene),
polystyrene-block-
polybutadiene-block-polystyrenecellulose and polyamide membranes for the
concentration and isolation of bergamot essential oil volatile compounds having
potential applicability in aromatherapy. The authors demonstrated that the pres-
ence in the polysulfone and cellulose structure of functional groups which contain
oxygen atoms, make them more polar and in the case of cellulose membrane highly
hydrophilic. According to the authors, these 2 polymeric membranes are able to
reject yclic and acyclic oxygenated monoterpenes (linalool, linalyl acetate,
4-terpineol, α-terpineol).

7.3 Conclusions
The global essential oils market size is expected to reach a value of 16.0 billion USD by
2026 comparing, while in terms of volume, the market is expected to reach at 345.4 kT
by 2026. Numerous techniques have been recommended for the extraction, fraction-
ation. Separation or concentration aroma raw materials from natural sources. Tradi-
tional processes involve distillation, solvent extraction, gas stripping and supercritical
ﬂuids. Different membranes based on polymers, inorganic or ceramic composed ma-
terials have been applied; however, further development of new materials is manda-
tory for the process improvement. Comparing to the traditional processes, membrane
ones show numerous advantages which permit concentration and isolation/fraction-
ation of aroma raw materials at mild temperature conditions which do not involve
additional extracting agents. Thus, membrane technology can be considered as a very
competitive one from the energetic point of view.
