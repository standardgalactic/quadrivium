AWS Shield is a managed threat protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS against 
exploitation of application vulnerabilities, bad bots, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This 
Threat Landscape Report provides a summary of threats detected and mitigated by AWS Shield. You can 
use this information to expand your knowledge of external threats and improve the security of your 
applications. The data in this report is derived from systems that AWS Shield uses to protect the availability 
of AWS, protect applications running on AWS, and alert AWS engineers to changes in the threat landscape. 
For example:  
• 
Network volumetric events are detected by a system that monitors AWS network traffic and 
places mitigations as needed to protect the availability of AWS services and applications running 
on AWS. 
• 
Web application-layer events are detected by systems that monitors traffic patterns on AWS 
WAF and alerts application owners of statistically significant anomalies.  
• 
Malware is detected by a threat intelligence platform that monitors traffic on AWS and alerts 
AWS engineers to new threats and changes in botnet behavior.   
At the end of this report, you can find additional references with steps you can take to help you protect 
your application against external threats, with emphasis on addressing recent trends in the threat 
landscape.  
Volumetric Threat Analysis  
Volumetric events, including network volumetric events and web application-layer events, are anomalies 
that are potential indicators of an external threat. Network volumetric events can include traffic that is 
not normally expected or is not expected at significant volume. This is informed by regular observations 
of traffic on AWS, knowledge of application use cases, and protocol specifications. DDoS attacks are one 
of the most common network volumetric events detected on AWS. Web application-layer events are 
statistically significant changes in both the volume and the composition of web requests. These events are 
detected when an Amazon CloudFront distribution or Application Load Balancer (ALB) is protected by AWS 
Shield Advanced.  
The following tables summarize events detected by AWS Shield in Q1 2020, with comparisons against Q4 
2019 and Q1 2019 to illustrate quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes in the volumetric threat 
landscape. For any network volumetric event that AWS Shield detected as a DDoS attack, a mitigation was 
automatically placed. Metrics are captured per vector, per resource. For example, a multi-vector DDoS 
attack against one resource may be detected as multiple events.

Table 2. Comparison of event frequency and volume since the same quarter last year (Q1 2019 vs. Q1 
2020).  
*“Days of elevated threat” in Tables 1 and 2 indicates the number of days in a given quarter that AWS 
determined the global threat level based on attack frequency, volume, or other attributes was “High” or 
“Critical”. Under most circumstances, the threat level is “Normal.” A threat level of “High” indicates that 
there is an ongoing, sustained, atypical increase in event activity. The threat level can also be set to 
“Critical” by an AWS Shield engineer, under exigent circumstances.  
The number of volumetric events detected by AWS Shield is influenced by growth in the number of 
applications hosted on AWS, improvements to AWS Shield detection, and the frequency at which 
applications are targeted by external threats. The number of detected events has increased by 23% since 
the same quarter in 2019. This was driven by an increase in the number of web application-layer events. 
Network volumetric events decreased by 20%.  
Figure 1 shows a weekly profile of the number of volumetric events observed by AWS in Q1 2020.

Network Volumetric Events  
DDoS attacks are the primary driver of larger network volumetric events. The most commonly observed 
network volumetric DDoS vectors are UDP reflection attacks. This includes attacks like DNS reflection, NTP 
reflection, SSDP reflection, and many others. Each of these vectors is similar in that an attacker spoofs the 
source IP of the victim application and floods legitimate UDP services on the Internet. Many of these 
services will unwittingly respond with one or more larger packets, resulting in a larger flood of traffic to 
the victim application. The largest known DDoS attacks are UDP reflection attacks. It is common to see the 
largest UDP reflection attacks shortly after a new vector is discovered. For example, in Q1 2018, a new 
memcached reflection vector was discovered and attacks greater than 1 Tbps in volume became common 
in the following days. From Q2 2018 to Q4 2019, the largest attacks observed on AWS were less than 1 
Tbps.   
In Q1 2020, a known UDP reflection vector, CLDAP reflection, was observed with a previously unseen 
volume of 2.3 Tbps. This is approximately 44% larger than any network volumetric event previously 
detected on AWS. CLDAP reflection attacks of this magnitude caused 3 days of elevated threat during a 
single week in February 2020 before subsiding. Despite this observation, smaller network volumetric 
events are far more common. The 99th percentile event in Q1 2020 was 43 Gbps.

on AWS during Q1 2020.   
The second most common DDoS vector observed on AWS is a SYN flood. This vector allows an attacker to 
generate a large flood of traffic while also targeting the state tracking capability of devices like servers, 
load balancers, and firewalls. SYN floods are commonly spoofed, meaning that it is not usually helpful to 
block the attack by source IP address. SYN flood packets are often very small, which can make the attack 
more difficult to absorb. Additionally, each SYN packet may be interpreted by the application as a new 
connection attempt. This can prevent valid end users from connecting to the application if its resources 
are exhausted. These attacks are typically smaller than UDP reflection attacks when evaluated in bits, but 
larger when evaluated in packets. In Q1 2020, the SYN floods observed on AWS were consistent with those 
observed in prior quarters.

TCP reflection is another known, less common vector that was observed during Q1 2020. It is similar to a  
SYN flood, except that it uses a flood of spoofed SYN packets sent to legitimate Internet services, which 
can elicit a larger flood of SYN/ACK packets toward the victim application. In a TCP reflection attack, one 
spoofed SYN packet can result in many SYN/ACK packets. This occurs when the legitimate service does not 
receive an ACK packet from the attack and retransmits the SYN/ACK packet many times.  
Web Application-Layer Events  
Applications protected by AWS Shield Advanced and AWS WAF are also monitored for web application-
layer events, like web request floods and HTTP reflection attacks. These events can be DDoS attacks that 
target the ability of a web application to serve regular users by generating a flood of traffic that is difficult 
to identify with network-based detection systems. In other cases, they are floods of traffic that are 
incidental to web content scraping, account takeover bots, or other unauthorized, non-human traffic. Each 
event in this report is a statistically significant deviation from the baseline of web request traffic for an 
application running on AWS, where the composition of traffic, based on attributes like user agent, URI, or 
referrer, also changed.  
The peak volume of the largest web application-layer events has declined, relative to the comparison 
quarters (Q4 2019 and Q1 2019). However, these events are unique in that a very large volume of requests 
is not necessarily required to threaten an application. In the case of bad bots, it is possible to scrape 
content or verify stolen user credentials without creating a large flood of traffic. Application-layer DDoS 
attacks may have a smaller request rate in an attempt to evade detection, while targeting more expensive 
resources on the application. For example, a request that invokes an API or results in a database query is 
more expensive than a request for a static object.  
Web request floods, a common application-layer DDoS vector, can be mitigated by scaling your application 
to absorb the additional traffic or by using a web application firewall (WAF). Network-layer devices are 
generally unable to inspect encrypted requests. This allows an attacker to leverage expensive web 
requests or large volumes of web requests to generate a flood that is challenging to fingerprint, 
challenging to block or absorb, or both. The majority of these events are relatively small. In Q1 2020, the 
90th percentile of web application-layer events was 1,608 requests per second. It is also possible for these 
events to reach much larger peak request volumes. In Q4 2018, a web request flood peaked at 20.6 million 
requests per second. Because the application targeted by this flood was well-architected, using Amazon 
CloudFront, AWS Shield Advanced, and AWS WAF, the application’s availability was not affected. This 
architecture distributes request handling across many AWS Edge Locations and temporarily blocks source 
IP addresses that exceed a pre-defined limit.  
Figure 4 shows the request volume of the largest web application-layer events observed by AWS in Q1 
2020.

Malware Threat Analysis  
Malware is software that is used by an attacker in an attempt to compromise a targeted application. Many 
attackers use botnets to scan the Internet for applications that may be vulnerable to exploitation. This can 
occur through vectors like remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability, privilege escalation, or server 
side request forgery (SSRF). AWS operates a threat intelligence platform that monitors Internet traffic and 
evaluates potentially suspicious interactions. This information is used by AWS engineers to stay current 
on the malware threat environment and to advise application owners on best practices to mitigate the 
most significant threats.    
The following table summarize events detected by AWS in Q1 2020, with comparisons against Q4 2019 to 
illustrate quarter-over-quarter changes in the malware threat landscape. The events in these tables are a 
subset of the total, for which AWS has higher confidence in the intent of the attacker. Unique suspects 
are individual sources, for which one or more events can be attributed.

The growth in both events and suspects can imply a larger number of exploitation attempts from either a 
larger number of suspected attackers, or from suspected attackers who are employing more dynamic 
evasion techniques. For example, an attacker can use many different sources or change their interaction 
patterns in an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the number of events per suspect has increased 23%.

The interaction types that were most prevalent in Q1 2020 data accounted for 36% of events and 19% of 
suspects. These include:  
• 
Docker unauthenticated RCE, where the suspect attempts to exploit a Docker engine API to build 
a container, without authorization.  
• 
SSH intrusion attempts, where the suspect looks for ways to gain unauthorized access to the 
application using commonly used credentials or other exploits.  
• 
Redis unauthenticated RCE, where the suspect attempts to exploit the API of a Redis database to 
gain remote access to the application, gain access to the contents of the database, or make it 
unavailable to end users.  
• 
Apache Hadoop YARN RCE, where the suspect attempts to exploit the API of a Hadoop cluster’s 
resource management system and execute code, without authorization. In March 2020, these 
interactions accounted for 31% of all events. During this time there were 134 million events, up 
from 88 million in each of the two prior months.  
The motivation of an attacker can vary. Individual interactions may result from an attacker with a specific 
goal that related to the targeted application. The higher volume interactions are motivated by control of 
compute and network resources at scale for purposes like cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks, or data 
exfiltration. The frequency of interaction with an application depends on factors like its prevalence on the 
Internet, availability of unpatched RCE vulnerabilities, and the likelihood that application owners have 
effectively restricted access to those applications.    
Key Takeaways and Recommendations  
There are steps that you can take to protect the availability of your applications and protect them against 
exploitation. The volumetric events described in this report can be mitigated by building resilient 
architecture, as described in the AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency whitepaper. This whitepaper 
provides an overview of DDoS attacks and choices that you can make when building on AWS to provide 
your application the greatest ability to absorb or mitigate volumetric attacks. Larger attacks, like the 2.3 
Tbps CLDAP reflection attack or the 20.6 million requests per second request flood described in this report, 
are lower frequency, high severity threats that are best mitigated when you are closely adhering to the 
best practices. This can also help protect applications against complex or multi-vector attacks that are 
often lower volume, but are more challenging to identify or mitigate. These best practices include:  
• 
Protect Internet-facing resources with AWS Shield Advanced. You can use AWS Shield Advanced 
to better protect your applications running on AWS against vulnerabilities, bad bots, and 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. When you add protected resources in AWS Shield 
Advanced, network volumetric attacks against those resources are detected and mitigated more 
quickly. You also receive attack visibility using the AWS Shield console, API, or Amazon 
CloudWatch metrics. If you require assistance during an attack, you can engage with AWS Shield 
experts or escalate to the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT).   
• 
Use AWS Firewall Manager to centrally manage protection policies across multiple accounts. 
With AWS Firewall Manager, you can define AWS Shield Advanced, AWS WAF, and Security 
Group policies spanning multiple accounts in an AWS Organization. AWS Firewall Manager 

  
  
8  
continuously monitors for resources not in compliance and can automatically apply protections, 
ensuring consistent adoption of organization-wide best practices for security.  
• 
Access greater capacity with Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53. You can use these 
services to serve static and dynamic web content as well as DNS answers using the global 
network of AWS Edge Locations. This provides you with greater capacity to help mitigate large 
volumetric attacks. Applications fronted by Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53 also 
benefit from inline mitigation that continually inspects all traffic and mitigates most attacks in 
less than one second. SYN cookies are used by CloudFront and the AWS Shield DDoS mitigation 
systems to verify new connections, protecting against SYN floods and other traffic floods that are 
not valid for the application.  
• 
Use AWS WAF and Rate-Based Rules to mitigate application-layer attacks. AWS Shield 
Advanced provides you with protection against volumetric attacks that can be mitigated with 
network-based DDoS mitigation systems. When you add AWS Shield Advanced protection to 
Amazon CloudFront or Application Load Balancer (ALB) for serving web content, you receive 
AWS WAF at no additional cost. AWS Managed Rules for AWS WAF makes it easy to select and 
apply pre-configured rules, depending on your specific requirements. You also receive web 
request flood detection and can mitigate attacks by configuring Rate-Based Rules to match and 
temporarily block IP addresses that are sending traffic above a rate that you define. For larger 
applications, or applications than span multiple AWS accounts, you can use AWS Firewall 
Manager to deploy rules across all of your resources.  
It is also important to protect your application against external threats that may attempt to install malware 
or run other commands, without authorization. Steps you can take include:  
• 
Reduce the attack surface. You can reduce the application’s attack surface by preventing access 
to the application, except as required to serve authorized end users. You can use Security Groups 
and Network ACLs in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to limit access to the application, or 
application components, by destination port, protocol, or IP address. For web applications, you 
can use AWS WAF to build a whitelist of rules that provides a wider range of attributes on which 
you can match, including header, method, query string, URI, body, source IP address or CIDR, 
and source country.   
• 
Keep software current and follow vendor best practices. Work with your software vendors to 
ensure that you are running the latest recommended version of any third-party software and 
that the application is patched any known vulnerabilities. Some RCE vulnerabilities may use a 
ServerSide Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability to interact with application components that 
were not directly exposed to the Internet. For example, a web application with a SSRF 
vulnerability may allow an attacker to craft a request that is executed by the application itself, 
bypassing access controls intended to prevent interaction with the backend. Software vendors 
may offer configuration options that prevent authenticated access.   
• 
Manage remote access. If possible, do not allow remote access to your hosts. If remote access is 
required, do not expose services like SSH or RDP to the Internet. Instead, you can use bastion 
hosts to act as the primary access point for administration of your application. Privileged users 

  
  
9  
must first access the bastion, which is protected by security groups to only allow access from a 
trusted network, like your VPN. Other security groups will only allow access from the bastion.     
• 
Monitor your application with Amazon GuardDuty. You can use Amazon GuardDuty to 
continuously monitor your application for malicious or unauthorized behavior. This can help you 
to identify malware behavior, including reconnaissance, cryptocurrency mining, and outbound 
DDoS attacks.
