The __set_name__ Method
à New in Python 3.6
This is a very handy method that gets called (once) when the descriptor is first instantiated
à that opens up some new possibilities
à better error messages
à include name of attribute that raised the exception
à useful application in descriptors used for validation

Application
Here's a pretty typical application of using custom descriptors
à again, key here is re-usability
Suppose we have some attributes in a non-slotted class that need to be validated each time they 
are set
à get property name from __set_name__
à __set__
à validate data
à if OK, store data in instance dictionary, under the same name
à wait a minute! does instance dictionary not shadow class attribute?
à not always with descriptors!
