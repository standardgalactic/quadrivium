Preface to the Second Edition
This second edition of Engineering Management: Meeting the Global Challenges is written for 
senior and first-year graduate engineering students majoring in disciplines such as aero-
space, biomedical, chemical, computer, electrical, mechanical, industrial, and system engi-
neering, as well as other technical domains (i.e., science, technology, and mathematics). It 
may also be used as a self-study guide by engineering professionals who aspire to become 
managers. It should be of value as well to first-line engineering supervisors/managers in 
further advancing their careers along the managerial career path. This target group of 
students and young professionals form the group the author defines “science, technology, 
engineering, and math (STEM) professionals and managers.”
The rapidly changing environment of today’s global economy calls for workers who are 
capable of holistic thinking, balancing analysis and intuition, living with ambiguity, and 
practicing strategic flexibility. Changes noted in the marketplace include (1) Internet-based 
communication, delivery, and business transactions; (2) customer references and buying 
habits; (3) new technologies related to data processing; (4) business alliances on a global 
basis; and (5) heightened competition in industry. These changes will require that STEM 
professionals and managers be more appropriately prepared than otherwise. This second 
edition is designed to address these needs.
The first edition of Engineering Management: Challenges in the New Millennium was well 
received in the marketplace. It was translated into Korean and awarded the Best Book of 
the Year Award in 2007 by the International Association for Management of Technology. 
At one point, it was adopted by about 20 U.S. and international educational institutions.
This second edition refocuses on the new strategy for STEM professionals and managers 
to meet the global challenges through the creation of strategic differentiation and opera-
tional excellence. Thus, major revisions contained in this second edition include: (1) a new 
chapter on creativity and innovation, (2) a new chapter on operational excellence, and (3) a 
combination of the chapters on financial accounting and financial management.
Strategic differentiation is essential for any enterprise to introduce and maintain market 
competitiveness in the form of differentiable product/service packages. STEM profession-
als and managers need to become well versed in creating product/service innovations that 
are both desired and required by customers. Specific thinking strategy, such as DeepThink 
discussed in Chapter 12, could be beneficially practiced. The chapter on creativity and 
innovation is to encourage STEM professionals and managers to actively pursue the devel-
opment of novel products/services in order to add significant value in creating strategic 
differentiation in their enterprises.
STEM professionals and managers need also to focus on creating operational excellence, 
which addresses issues related to process efficiency, cost reduction, time to market, and 
doing all things well in order to improve the short-term profitability of their enterprise. 
New Internet-based enablers such as big data, analytics, and cloud computing are becom-
ing available for STEM professionals and managers to apply. The new chapter on opera-
tional excellence illustrates the effective use of many such productivity-enhancing tools.
STEM professionals and managers need to acquire background knowledge in financial 
accounting and management, as such knowledge promotes better decision-making related 
to the enterprise and fosters the development of companywide initiatives.

xviii
Preface to the Second Edition
The key book design strategy for this second edition covers three distinctive sections: (1) 
engineering management fundamentals, (2) business management skills, and (3) leader-
ship essentials, to ready STEM professionals and managers for meeting the global chal-
lenges. Such a broad-based background is viewed as essential for STEM professionals and 
managers to exert a strong leadership role in the dynamic and challenging marketplace.
The following “three-decker leadership architecture” forms the design basis of this book.
Strategic
diﬀerentiation
Operational
excellence
Globalization
Financial
management
Controlling
Leading
Ethics

A large number of engineering and business cases are contained in the text-end 
appendix. These cases cover various management and business issues in diversified 
sectors. They represent a useful extension of the exercise problems listed at the end of 
each chapter.
All STEM professionals and managers face global challenges that have six dimensions. 
These are (1) inside, (2) outside, (3) present, (4) future, (5) local, and (6) global.
Manage/Lead/Act/Think
Focuses
Inside
Core competencies, cost and quality control, production and process excellence
Outside

Preface to the First Edition
Engineers with excellent managerial skills and superior business acumen are needed 
to lead the Corporate America in the new century. As the economy grows increasingly 
global, technologies advance at faster pace, and marketplace becomes more dynamic in the 
decades ahead, many industrial companies will need technically trained engineers to turn 
technological innovations into profitability.
The need for engineering management training is obvious from another point of view. 
National Science Foundation estimated in 2000 that about 46% of U.S. engineers and 
scientists were actively working in managerial/administrative capacities. This managerial 
percentage remained more or less constant across the age groups from below 35 to more 
than 55. As this trend continues, almost one out of every two engineers/scientists will 
be engaged in managing people, projects, teams, and technology and other resources to 
create value for their employers.
This book prepares engineers to fulfill their managerial responsibilities, acquire useful 
business perspectives, and take on the much-needed leadership roles to meet the chal-
lenges in the new millennium.
A number of themes permeate the book. Value addition, customer focus and business 
perspectives are emphasized throughout. Also underlined are discussions of leadership 
attributes, steps to acquire these attributes, the areas engineering managers are expected 
to add value, the web-based tools which can be aggressively applied to develop and sus-
tain competitive advantages, the vital tasks of e-transformation, the opportunities offered 
by market expansion into global regions, and the preparations required for engineering 
manager to become global leaders.
The book is intended for senior and first-year graduate engineering students majoring 
in disciplines such as aerospace, biomedical, chemical, computer, electrical, mechanical, 
industrial and systems engineering. It may also be used as a self-study guide by engi-
neering professionals who aspire to become managers. It should be of value to first-time 
engineering supervisors/managers interested in further advancing their careers along the 
managerial career path as well.
The book is organized to contain three major sections: I. Functions of Engineering 
Management, II. Business Fundamentals for Engineering Managers, and III. Engineering 
Management in the New Millennium.
Section I discusses the basic functions of engineering management such as planning, 
organizing, leading and controlling. These functions provide engineers and engineering 
managers with foundation skills to manage themselves, staff, teams, projects, technologies 
and global issues of importance.
Best practices are emphasized as pertinent standards for goal setting and performance 
measurement. Engineering managers solve problems and minimize conflicts to achieve 
the company’s objectives. They make rational decisions and take lawful and ethical 
actions. They apply Monte Carlo methods to assess projects involving risks and uncertain-
ties. They engage emerging technologies, motivate a professional workforce of diversified 
backgrounds, develop new generations of products/services in a timely manner, and con-
stantly surpass the best practices in industry.

Preface to the First Edition
The roles of engineering managers in strategic planning, employee selection, team 
building, delegating, decision-making and in the management of creativity and innova-
tions are explained. The development of managerial competencies is emphasized.
Section II covers the fundamentals of engineering management including cost account-
ing, financial accounting/analysis, managerial finance, and marketing management. This 
section is to enable engineers and engineering managers to acquire a broadened perspec-
tive with respect to the business and stakeholders of the company and to facilitate their 
interaction with peer groups/units.
It also prepares engineering managers to make decisions related to cost, finance, 
products, services and capital budgets. Discount cash flow and internal rate of return anal-
yses are reviewed. These discussions are of critical importance as decisions made during 
the product design phase typically determine up to 85% of the final costs of products. 
Additional deliberations are presented regarding activity-based costing (ABC) to define 
indirect costs related to products/ services and Economic Value added (EVA) to determine 
the real profitability of an enterprise above and beyond the cost of capital deployed.
Also introduced is capital formation through equity and debt financing along with 
resource allocation concepts based on adjusted present value (APV) for assets in place and 
option pricing for capital investment opportunities. By appreciating the project evaluation 
criteria and the tools of financial analyses, engineers and engineering managers will be in 
a better position to win project approvals. A critical step to developing technological proj-
ects is the acquisition and incorporation of customer feedback. For them to lead, a major 
challenge is indeed the initiation, development and implementation of major technological 
projects, which contribute to the long-term profitability of the company.
The important roles and responsibilities of marketing in any profit-seeking enterprise 
are then clarified along with the supporting contributions expected of engineering manag-
ers. Many progressive enterprises are increasingly concentrating on customer relationship 
management to grow their business. Such a customer orientation is expected to continue 
to serve as a key driving force for product design, project management, plant operation, 
manufacturing, customer service and many other engineering-centered activities.
Section III addresses five major topics that are namely engineers as managers/leaders, 
ethics in engineering/business management, web-based enablers for engineering and 
management, globalization, and engineering management in the new millennium. These 
discussions provide additional building blocks to enhance the preparation for engineers 
and engineering managers to assume technology leadership positions and to meet the 
challenges in the new millennium.
Engineers are known to possess a strong set of skills, which enable them to do extraordi-
narily well in certain types of managerial work. However, some of them may also exhibit 
weaknesses that prevent them from becoming effective leaders in engineering organiza-
tions or even from being able to survive as engineers in the industry. The expected norms 
of effective leaders are described. Steps enabling engineering managers to enhance their 
leadership qualities and attune themselves to the value-centered business acumen are dis-
cussed. Certain outlined steps should be of great value to those engineering managers who 
want to become better prepared to create new products/ services based on technology, 
integrate technology into organizations, and lead technology-based organizations.
Many “tried and true” rules are included which serve as suitable guidelines for engi-
neering managers to becoming excellent leaders. Above all, engineering managers are 
expected to lead with a vision of how to apply company core competencies to create 
value, insights into how to capture opportunities offered by emerging technologies, and 

xxi
Preface to the First Edition
innovations in making products/services better, faster and cheaper, so that they constantly 
improve customer satisfaction. The concepts of value addition, customer focus, time to 
market, mass customization, supply chains, enterprise resources integration, and others 
are also discussed.
Although engineers are known to be ranked quite high in trustworthiness and integ-
rity (ahead of businessmen, bankers, certified public accountants, physicians, lawyers and 
others), it is important for all engineers and engineering managers to remain vigilant in 
observing a code of ethics, upholding a high standard of honesty and integrity and become 
sensitive with other topics related to ethics.
The changes wrought by the Internet are transforming most aspects of company business, 
including information dissemination, product distribution and customer service. As pro-
cessor design, software development and transmission hardware technologies continue to 
advance, their roles in business will surely grow and affect many functions of engineering 
management in the future. Progressive engineering managers need to know what web-
based enablers of engineering and management are currently available and which ones 
can be applied effectively to promote product customization, expedite new products to 
market, align supply chains, optimize inventory, foster team creativity and innovation, 
and improve customer service. Presented in considerate length is a comprehensive set of 
web-based tools related to product design, manufacturing, project management, procure-
ment, plant operations, knowledge management and supply chain management.
Globalization expands the perspectives of engineers and engineering managers further 
with respect to divergence in culture, business practices and value. Globalization is a major 
business trend that will affect many enterprises in the next decades. Engineers and engi-
neering managers must become sensitized to the issues involved and prepare themselves 
(using the 4-T strategy) to contribute to those enterprises wishing to capture new business 
opportunities offered in the global emerging markets. They need to be aware of the poten-
tial effects of job migration due to globalization and take steps to prepare themselves to 
meet such challenges. A useful contribution for engineers and engineering managers to 
make is to create global technical alliances for taking advantage of new technological and 
business opportunities.
Engineering management will face external challenges in the new millennium. What 
these specific challenges are, how engineering managers need to prepare to meet these 
challenges, and how to optimally make use of location-specific opportunities to create 
competitive advantages will be examined. Progressive companies will also change organi-
zational structures, set up supply chains, expedite e-transformation, and apply advanced 
tools to serve customers better, cheaper and faster. Globalization is also expected to con-
stantly evolve as the United Nations has predicted that by the year 2020 three of the five 
biggest national economies will be located in Asia. There will certainly be winners and 
losers as businesses become more and more global. It is important for future engineer-
ing managers to explore prudent corporate strategies for engineering enterprises in the 
pursuit of globalization while minimizing any detrimental impact on the environment, 
respecting human rights, and maintaining acceptable work conditions.
How should engineering managers prepare themselves to add value in the new 
millennium? What are the success factors for engineering managers in the new century? 
What might be the social responsibilities of engineering managers in the decades ahead? 
These questions are addressed in the final chapter of the book. Globalization will create 
ample opportunities for those who know how to properly prepare and equip themselves 
with the required global mind-set, knowledge, and savvy.

xxii
Preface to the First Edition
To foster the leadership roles of engineering managers, a six-dimensional model is pro-
posed to emphasize the inside, outside, present, future, local and global dimensions. The 
management challenges for engineers in these dimensions are discussed.
During two regular academic semesters, the book could be supplemented by in-class 
discussions of a number of business cases, which focus on engineering and technology 
management. Examples and answers are incorporated throughout the book. Questions 
are also included at the end of each chapter to promote in-class exchange among students. 
Besides a final exam, which could be a take-home comprehensive analysis of a specific 
business/engineering case, students may also be required to prepare term papers on engi-
neering management topics of their preference in order for them to keep abreast with new 
developments in the marketplace.
In preparation for this book, the author surveyed engineering management texts 
published in the last 5–10 years. None of the textbooks surveyed cover “Web-based 
Enablers for Engineering and Management” (Chapter 12) and “Engineering Management 
in the New Millennium (Chapter 14). Only a small number of texts addressed some of 
the issues raised in “Engineers as Managers/Leaders, (Chapter 10) and “Globalization” 
(Chapter 13). Further, most of these engineering management texts do not cover “Marketing 
Management for Engineering Managers (Chapter 9). The author believes that engineering 
managers will be able to play key leadership roles in their organizations if they optimally 
apply their combined strengths in engineering and management.

Introduction to Management 
Challenges for Engineers
1.1  Introduction
In our modern-day economy, customers’ needs are changing rapidly, the marketplace is 
becoming global, and technology is advancing at an ever-increasing speed. To maintain 
competitiveness in such a challenging environment, companies need effective leaders who 
understand both technology and business. Engineers with proper management training 
have great opportunities to make valuable and lasting contributions (Chang 2005; Merino 
and Farr 2010).
In industry, managers are select employees entrusted with the responsibilities of putting 
communications means to use, making critical decisions, taking decisive actions, applying 
resources, and guiding the behavior of internal teams and external business partners to 
achieve company objectives (Shah 2012; Gomez 2014).
The communications means applied by managers may be verbal or written, with or with-
out body language. The decisions made take into account technical feasibility, resources 
conservation, and economic viability. The actions taken include planning, organizing, 
leading, and controlling. The resources utilized involve people, time, capital, equipment, 
facilities, technology, know-how, and business relationships. The teams guided by man-
agers are individual employees (teams of one), projects, task forces, quality circles, and 
others. The external business partners may include customers, suppliers, networked part-
ners, and joint ventures or otherwise aligned companies. For individual science, technol-
ogy, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals to succeed in such an environment, they 
need to heed the advice of Henry Ford, who said, “The only real security that a man can 
have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience and ability.”
This chapter starts with a brief review of the major sectors of a national economy. Then, 
it discusses the work of engineering managers and practicing engineers, and delineates 
the differences between these two types of work. Finally, the chapter addresses the chal-
lenges faced by engineering managers in the global environment.
1.2  Definitions
It is proper to begin with the language of management. The following are a sample of man-
agement terms that will be used frequently throughout this book (Weske 2012).

2
Engineering Management
1.2.1  Management Responsibilities
The management group of a company has the overall responsibility of achieving the com-
pany’s objectives and meeting the diverse expectations of its stakeholders. The manage-
ment group is composed of managers at various levels, from chief executive officer (CEO) 
down to first-line managers (e.g., supervisor, group leader, section head, and manager).
The stakeholders are groups of people who have a stake in the company’s performance. 
These include shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, and the community in which 
the company operates. Typical expectations of these stakeholders include:
	
1.	Shareholders: Return on investment, dividends, earnings per share, and apprecia-
tion in stock price over time
	
2.	Customers: Quality of products, acceptable services, flexibility of company to 
accommodate changing customer needs, efficient delivery, and competitive prices
	
3.	Suppliers: Financial stability, market share position, quality production, collabora-
tion efficiency, and on-time payment
	
4.	Employees: Innovative company policy and culture, good working conditions, sta-
ble employment, and competitive salary and benefits
	
5.	Community: Environmentally clean, tax contribution, socially responsible, ethi-
cally acceptable practices, and good corporate citizenship
Over time, company management is responsible for satisfying this diverse set of expec-
tation of all stakeholders.
1.2.2  Type of Work
Work is the task performed to add value to the company. Performing the work involves the 
use of resources (e.g., time, money, energy, tools, human efforts, technologies, and facili-
ties) and applicable procedures. There are three types of work:
	
1.	Management work: Plan, organize, lead, and control the efforts of self and others; 
this requires thinking.
	
2.	Technical work: Specialized, nonmanagement work done by engineering managers 
if others cannot do it for them; this requires doing.
	
3.	Operating work: Management and technical work that has been delegated to others; 
this requires monitoring and controlling.
1.2.3  Chain of Command
The chain of command refers to the chain of direct authority relationships between supe-
riors and subordinates. This is derived from the traditional military systems.
1.2.4  Principle of Unity of Command
According to this principle, an individual worker reports to a single superior.
1.2.5  Efficiency
Efficiency refers to the accomplishment of a given task with the least amount of effort. 
Being efficient means not wasting resources (e.g., time, money, equipment, facilities, skills, 
talents, and management attention).

1.2.6  Effectiveness
Effectiveness refers to the accomplishment of tasks with efforts that are commensurate 
with the value created by these tasks.
The paradigm “All things worth doing are worth doing well” should be replaced by “All 
things worth doing are worth doing well only to the extent of their contributed value to 
the company.” Engineers and managers need to be value conscious. Perfectionists have no 
place in a progressive industrial environment.
1.2.7  Strategic and Operational (Tactical) Decisions
Strategic decisions are those that set the direction for the unit, department, and company. 
These decisions determine what are the right things to do. Examples include which new 
markets to pursue, what new products to develop, who should be engaged as supply chain 
partners, and when the right time is to acquire which new technologies to enhance com-
petitive advantages. Operational decisions are those that specify ways to implement a spe-
cific task, project, or program. They define how things are to be done correctly.
STEM professionals with managerial responsibilities are involved in making strategic 
decisions. Others working as technical contributors are typically involved with decisions 
that are operational in nature.
1.3  Employment Trend in Industries
Graduates of STEM disciplines are typically employed in for-profit industrial companies, 
which design, produce, market, and service products or services or both to their busi-
ness clients or individual consumers in the marketplace. In this section, discussions are 
offered regarding the differences between products and services, the major trend regard-
ing employment into the future, and the special skills needed for STEM graduates to be 
successful in the years ahead.
1.3.1  Products versus Services
Products differ from services in a number of ways. According to Tidd and Bessant (2013), 
there are six characteristics that could be used to differentiate them:
	
1.	Tangibility: Products are more tangible than services.
	
2.	Perceptions: Product quality is assessed based on criteria such as functionality, 
reliability, durability, and maintainability. Service quality is, on the other hand, 
perceived based on physical evidence (the physical setting where the service is 
offered), responsiveness (speed of service and willingness of staff to help), compe-
tence (ability to perform the service dependably), assurance (knowledge and cour-
tesy of staff and ability to convey trust and confidence), and empathy (provision of 
caring and individual attention).
	
3.	Simultaneity: Products are typically made in advance of consumption, whereas ser-
vices are consumed mostly at the time of production. Simultaneity brings about 
the potential for quality management problems related to the identification and 

4
Engineering Management
correction of service errors as well as capacity-planning problems to match supply 
with demand.
	
4.	Storage: Capacity-management problems may arise due to an imbalance between 
supply and demand. Such problems may be mitigated by pricing (e.g., discounts 
at off-peak time to induce demand), adding temporary workers or outsourcing or 
both.
	
5.	Customer contact: Services demand a high level of customer contact, some 
more (medical, business consulting) and some less (financial service, informa-
tion), whereas products are typically sold in the absence of much customer 
interaction.
	
6.	Location: The proximity factor is more important for services than for products, 
making services more local and less competitive. Only about 10% of services in the 
developed economies are traded internationally.
Osterwalder and Pineur (2014) added a few more comparisons between the key features 
of products and services. Intellectual property rights are very important to products, but 
not so to services. Products are important as complementarities to other offerings of the 
same companies, whereas services are not so. For producing products, there is a fixed cost 
structure, which allows realizable gross margin to increase with production scale, whereas 
services are predominantly produced on a variable cost structure, which can hardly scale 
to raise gross margin. In general, products can be used in a variety of contexts because of 
the inherent generic design knowledge. Services, on the other hand, may require exten-
sive customization to clients’ specific needs. It is important for companies to maintain 
good long-term relationships with clients for products, who are generally knowledgeable. 
Service clients are typically not technically sophisticated and they are to be served with 
good project-driven relationships.
It is useful for STEM professionals to recognize the differences between products and 
services, as the skills needed to successfully work for these employers are different. In the 
next section, the different growth rates for the products sector versus the service sector 
will be discussed.
1.3.2  Major Sectors in Industry
The economies of many countries consist of three major sectors: agriculture, manufactur-
ing, and services. In general, the agriculture and manufacturing sectors generate products 
for sales, whereas the service sector offers services to business clients or individual con-
sumers or both. Over the years, significant changes have occurred in each of these sectors 
due to technological advancement, market expansion, rapid change in customer needs, 
and globalization. In countries, such as the United States, the service-providing indus-
try could make up as high as 80% of the total employment in the year of 2014, whereas 
the roles of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are steadily declining over time. 
Figure 1.1 illustrates this remarkable trend.
Other countries are expected to experience a similar path of service expansion in the 
years ahead, due to the continuous improvement in standards of living, the expansion of 
the middle-class populations, as well as a change in demographics. As the percentage of 
elderly people in all countries increases, it will result in demands for services related to 
health care, hospitality, leisure, financial consultation, investment, and others. Table 1.1 
indicates that from 2011 to 2050, the percentage of elderly people in all continents will 

5
Introduction to Management Challenges for Engineers
drastically increase and the ratio of working-age persons to older people is expected to 
decrease accordingly.
The service-providing industry is typically divided into a large number of sectors, as 
follows:
 
1.	Professional and business services
	
2.	Health care and social assistance

In Figure 1.2, the projected percentage changes in U.S. employment by sector (2010–2020) 
are forecast. Table 1.2 lists the projected job growth in the United States.
Companies providing services need talented people who are in a position to innovate 
new ways to make present-day services cheaper, faster, better, and more convenient for 
users. Opportunities are also available due to generally perceived needs to invigorate 
productivity in the service sectors, which typically lag behind that of the manufactur-
ing sector. Tools such as Lean Six Sigma, total quality management, automation, value 
stream mapping, and other are now increasingly applied to the service industry. More 
recently, advanced tools, such as big data, analytics, service-oriented architecture (SOA), 
cloud computing, and web services are being readily applied to discover insights from 
internal as well as external customer databases to create competitive advantages in the 
marketplace.
As the need for highly skilled professionals in the service sectors becomes evident, it 
is advisable for STEM professionals to prepare themselves well to capitalize on such new 
opportunities offered in the future, and not to limit themselves to only pursuing product-
related job opportunities.

Introduction to Management Challenges for Engineers
1.4  STEM Professionals as Effective Technical Contributors
1.4.1  Types of Work Done by Technical Contributors
Practicing engineers (technical contributors) are empowered to do things correctly 
(mostly operational) and to upgrade the ways that things are done. When assigned to 
perform specific work, a practicing engineer is typically told of the specific work objec-
tives as well as any time line, budgetary, technological, and other constraints that may 
apply. The engineer is then expected to develop a project plan, jointly define standards 
with his or her superior, select methods of performing the work, carry out the tasks, and 
deliver results. A document is prepared to summarize the project; this includes conclu-
sions; the impact of the outcome on the objectives of the group, unit, or company; and pos-
sibly suggestions related to potential improvements in methodology and future technical 
applications of the results.
The performance of practicing engineers is evaluated according to how well they carry 
out their technical assignments within the time and budgetary constraints, as well as the 
value of the project outcome to the company. Young engineers entering an organization 
are typically assigned tasks of a highly technical content for which their academic training 
is best utilized.
To perform well as technical contributors, engineers are advised to pay attention to the 
following five steps:
	
1.	Demonstrate technical competence and innovative capabilities: In their early years, engi-
neers need to demonstrate excellent technical skills in performing tasks and proj-
ects. They practice fundamental engineering principles correctly, deliver work that

Engineering Management
is technically free of errors, and are sensitive to time and budget constraints. It is 
also critically important for engineers to demonstrate their innovative capabilities in 
product design, problem solving, conflict resolution, and other technological areas.
	
2.	Practice people skills: Engineers should ensure that they communicate effectively 
with others in both verbal and written forms. They need to interact with peers 
and management in an acceptable manner. Their interactions with management 
will be strongly enhanced if the engineers become familiar, through self-study or 
academic courses, with the mind-sets and perspectives of the company managers 
and with managerial issues and problems. They also need to demonstrate that 
they are easy to work with and get along well with most people. Ravi Zacharias 
said, “There is never a good reason to be unkind.”
	
3.	Show an unfailing reliability: Engineers need to show that they are reliable in taking 
on assignments that add value to their management and are capable of discharg-
ing responsibilities delegated to them.
	
4.	Be proactive: Engineers should proactively seek team assignments, project coordi-
nation, and other roles to practice their managerial skills, foster teamwork, and 
showcase leadership qualities. If opportunities do not knock, build a door.
	
5.	Work skills: STEM professionals should equip themselves well with various work 
skills that are expected in industry. These include (1) communications, (2) inter-
personal skills, (3) negotiation, (4) conflict resolution, (5) problem solving—root 
cause analysis, (6) self-motivation, (7) project management, (7) team building, (8) 
leadership and vision, (9) creativity and innovation, (10) entrepreneurship, (11) 
stress management, (12) decision-making, (13) critical thinking, (14) time man-
agement, (15) study habits—learning to learn, (16) networking, (17) value-based 
choice-making, (18) literature search and data analysis, (19) work ethics and integ-
rity, (20) use of social media, (21) relationship management, (22) budget and eco-
nomics, (23) engineering fundamentals, (24) application of system thinking, (25) 
use of advance technological tools (Skype, NetMeeting, video conference, mobile 
devices, etc.), and (26) keep knowledge and ability current.
	
6.	Exhibit a readiness for advancement: Engineers need to ready themselves for assum-
ing a higher level of technical responsibility so that their employers are able to 
entrust more challenging responsibilities to them. Engineers should strive to con-
stantly enrich themselves by acquiring new knowledge and creating increasingly 
more value for their employers.
1.4.2  Interaction and Collaboration with Others
A typical modern-day engineering organization may have many departments, each focus-
ing on a group of specific functions. These groups may include (1) production and manu-
facturing, (2) construction, (3) design engineering, (3) systems engineering, (4) systems and 
equipment maintenance, (5) project engineering, (6) program management, (7) process 
development, (8) product development, (9) technology development, (10) customer service, 
(11) applied research and development (R&D), and (12) others. Engineers may work in any 
of these departments. Some engineers may elect to stay in specific functional areas for a 
long period. Others may prefer to move from one functional area to another to attain a 
well-rounded base of experience.
Figure 1.3 displays the typical interactions between various engineering and nonengi-
neering groups. Engineers are focused on creating value for their employers through their 

9
Introduction to Management Challenges for Engineers
technical work, although they may get involved with various nonengineering functions 
from time to time.
Different types of professional work require skills at different quality levels. Table 1.3 
illustrates the 10 commonly defined quality levels. New and innovative services are typi-
cally realized by people at service quality level 10.
Companies in industry need to pursue strategic differentiation and operational excel-
lence in the products/services that they offer in order to sustain and extend market 
competitiveness and achieve long-term profitability (Chang 2014). In so far as strategic 
differentiation is concerned, market competitiveness must be built on product/service 
innovations such that these value packages offered to customers are constantly renewed

and uniquely differentiable from the competition. Marketing management, financial 
analysis, and cost accounting are important tools to employ, when choices need to be 
made to achieve long-term strategic advantages. These topics are covered in the second 
part of this book. Operational excellence is also important, as companies need to mini-
mize wastes, streamline operations, and enhance productivity to maximize profitability. 
Engineering management principles related to planning, organizing, leading, and con-
trolling will be needed to guide these operations. These subjects are covered in the first 
part of this book.
To be successful in such an environment, professionals need to exhibit capabilities related 
to communications, teamwork, collaborations, and results-orientation (Chang 2010). It is 
also important for them to possess:
	
1.	Customer-focused mind-set: A service mind-set consists of practicing a customer-
focus paradigm in the creation, delivery, and servicing of value packages to meet 
customers’ important needs with a keen understanding that achieving customer 
satisfaction is the driving force for long-term corporate profitability. Apply mar-
keting tools to understand customers’ needs, foster customer collaboration, and 
create customer expectations.
	
2.	Vision and leadership: Create vision, set direction, and make decisions that deter-
mine values in relation to new product/service offerings, business models, supply 
chain partnerships, market segments, and emerging technologies.
	
3.	Creativity and innovation: Invent new product/service offerings, and pursue inno-
vative programs to achieve market success.
	
4.	Productivity and value creation: Utilize management tools to monitor business 
activities, create value through customer interactions, and improve all operational 
processes.
	
5.	Design and development: Engage emerging technologies (e.g., big data, analytics, 
SOA, and Internet-based enablers), to invent new products/services and improve 
existing ones.
	
6.	Ethics and professionalism: Set high standards and implement corporate codes of 
ethics.
	
7.	Global orientation: Ensure methods of supply through tiered partnerships, and 
exploit global networks of resources to capitalize new opportunities.
1.4.3  Value-Adding Opportunities
As a technical contributor, every STEM professional would report to a superior who is 
typically a supervisor or manager. The superior makes decisions that will have a profound 
impact on the engineer’s contributions to the company and hence on his or her profes-
sional career. Exposure to the functions, concepts, skills, and best practices of engineering 
management allows the engineer to better align his or her own work with the needs of his 
or her superior and hence that of the company. The engineer is then in a better position 
to accept the fact that his or her superior will typically decide whether or not to adopt a 
new technology, program, or project primarily based on the value it can add to the com-
pany. The decision is likely to take into account the resources (e.g., money, people, time, 
technologies, and business relationships) required for implementation. The decision will 
not likely be made based on inherent technological sophistication, innovative strength, 
rational elegance, or theoretical robustness.

11
Introduction to Management Challenges for Engineers
Value is said to have been added if the company’s profitability is derived from
Increased sales revenues: For example, due to new product features, better customer 
service, novel logistics in the delivery of products/services, shorter time to mar-
ket, and so on, when the company devotes a considerable amount of effort to the 
creation of strategic differentiation.
Reduced cost to do business: For example, due to improved engineering and manu-
facturing productivity, raised operational efficiency, new synergy among aligned 
business partners, simplified product design, better quality control, and so on, as 
pursued by progressive companies in achieving operational excellence.
The superior sets project priorities. Priorities are usually set based on whether the antici-
pated value of a project is large or small, short term or long term, direct or indirect, and certain 
or uncertain. Exposure to Engineering Management: Meeting the Global Challenges makes engi-
neers more effective in increasing their cumulative value contributions to their employers.
Table 1.4 summarizes the contrasting difference between work done by technical con-
tributors and engineering managers.
1.5  Management and Leadership
Engineers interested in moving into leadership positions need to know what it takes to be 
selected as managers by their employers. In order to lead their enterprises to greater pros-
perity, they need to prepare themselves to accept leadership roles and responsibilities by

honing their people skills and interacting effectively with peer managers in other corporate 
functions, and become versed in the use of Internet-based management and technology 
tools. They also must nurture a clear vision for the companies they work for, be innovative 
and creative in product development and other ways of utilizing emerging technologies, 
and possess the required business savvy with a customer focus and a global orientation. 
This book assists engineers in acquiring the skills and attributes deemed essential for 
assuming leadership roles in the new millennium.
Not all engineers are interested in becoming managers. This book, Engineering 
Management: Meeting the Global Challenges, is useful to both engineers who want to remain 
technical contributors and those who elect to become managers.
STEM professionals who aspire to become managers are advised to fully understand 
these differences and the requirement associated with management work. An individual 
should assess the compatibility of these implied requirements with his or her personal-
ity, aptitude, value system, personal goals, preparation, and other factors so that he or 
she is convinced that taking on managerial responsibilities will indeed lead to long-term 
happiness.
1.5.1  Readying Engineers to Accept Managerial Responsibilities
For those engineers who aspire to become managers, a comprehensive exposure to the top-
ics reviewed in this book enhances their readiness for being selected when such manage-
rial opportunities arise. Knowledge is power. The new knowledge gained from this book 
can motivate engineers to experiment and to excel. They accumulate experience as they 
systematically correct their own deficiencies and practice interpersonal skills, decision-
making, problem solving, delegating, cost accounting, strategic planning, project man-
agement, and team coordination. Both the new knowledge gained and the experiences 
accumulated provide them with a decisive advantage over other management candidates.
Engineering managers must be able to lead. This is particularly true in the dynamic 
marketplace of the new millennium, which is affected by sophisticated communications 
tools, operational excellence enablers, flexible supply chains, and business operations of 
global proportions. Operational excellence enablers are tools that are Internet based (see 
examples discussed in Chapter 12). These tools enhance the efficiency of product design, 
project management, plant operations, facility maintenance, innovations, knowledge man-
agement, marketing and sales, enterprise resources planning and integration, and pro-
curements. Since programs and projects will become increasingly interdisciplinary and 
complex in the future, decision-making is likely to involve the use of web-based tools 
and the participation of team members who have divergent cultural backgrounds, value 
systems, business priorities, and work experience. Also much needed is the push for tech-
nological innovations, which many engineers are particularly qualified to provide. Those 
engineering managers who are innovative and have both technological insights and busi-
ness savvy will have opportunities to create significant value for and be richly rewarded 
by their employers in the new millennium (Cooper 2011).
This book is written to prepare STEM professionals to become better technical contribu-
tors or engineering managers to become better leaders in technical organizations, so that 
all of them will add substantial value to their employers in the new millennium. This book 
shows that certain management principles do not change over time (Griffin 2012). However, 
management practices do change in response to changes in customers’ needs, employees’ 
attitudes, business models, technologies, organizational structures, resources, and external 
business relations. Managers must be able to lead and manage these changes.

13
Introduction to Management Challenges for Engineers
A good strategy for young STEM graduates is to learn the fundamentals of management 
(principles, skills, functions, roles and responsibilities, success factors, etc.), and then seek 
opportunities to actively practice these skills, functions, principles, and management roles. 
Opportunities to do so may exist in professional societies and volunteer organizations 
(e.g., the United Way, churches, boy scouts, and girl scouts). As more management experi-
ence is accumulated, proficiency will result and allow the engineer to naturally stand out 
when management openings become available in the future.
Example 1.1
Several U.S. universities offer the academic degree program that is concentrated on 
engineering management. Others have developed the degree program for management 
of technology. Are they fundamentally different from one another?
Answer 1.1
These two types of degree programs are essentially similar, with minor differences in 
the course work involved. Both programs are aimed at training managers to become 
managerial leaders in technology.
The management of technology degree program was envisaged to correct a deficiency 
noted in the U.S. educational system (National Research Council 1987). This degree 
program is designed to address important management issues, such as those enumer-
ated here, which were neglected in the master of business administration program that 
existed at the time:
	
1.	 Integrating technology into the overall strategic objectives of the firm
	
2.	 Getting into and out of technologies more efficiently
	
3.	 Assessing and evaluating technology more effectively
	
4.	 Developing better methods for transferring and assimilating new technology
	
5.	 Reducing new product development time
	
6.	 Managing large, complex, and interdisciplinary or interorganizational proj-
ects, programs, and systems
	
7.	 Leveraging the effectiveness of technical professionals
Currently, the degree programs in engineering management offered by many U.S. 
universities address these topics as well.
1.5.2  Characteristics of an Effective Engineering Manager
Engineering managers have engineering training and specific technical knowledge and 
experience, and are accountable for the results of the unit, section, or department they 
head up. Generally speaking, an engineering manager needs to be motivated to acquire 
knowledge (e.g., roles, functions, and vocabulary) and skills; prepare mentally (job out-
look, management orientation, personality traits, and flexibility); and be determined to 
diligently practice the principles of engineering management. Many skills of engineering 
management are learnable.
The effective engineering manager is someone who has a clear vision to lead his or her 
unit, is a rational and organized individual, devotes attention to focus on what custom-
ers are looking for (e.g., quality, convenience, flexibility, speed of service, and friendliness 
in interactions), and practices a high standard with respect to ethics, fairness, and honor. 
As a rule, managers decide what should be done (strategic), and technical contributors 
determine how things are to be done (tactical). As an engineering manager rises in an 

14
Engineering Management
organization, his or her daily decisions will become more strategic. The CEO of a company 
makes strategic decisions only.
1.5.3  Resources Controlled by an Engineering Manager
In general, the engineering manager has a number of resources at his or her disposal, 
which are to be optimally applied: (1) managerial time for planning, directing, monitoring, 
and controlling; (2) staff with proper expertise available; (3) budget authorized to use; (4) 
access to corporate hardware and know-how; (5) access to external capabilities (e.g., busi-
ness partners, independent inventors, and university experts); and (6) access to company-
internal management information. These resources are effectively utilized to (1) define 
the priority of all tasks to be done; (2) determine the specific objectives of each task to be 
accomplished; (3) specify the constraints for each task (such as time, budget, outcome); (4) 
invite the assignee to suggest specific ways to accomplish the task; (5) monitor progress; 
(6) document the task results; (7) glean important learning from this case; and (7) offer 
individual feedback and evaluation.
1.5.4  Nature of Work by Engineering Managers
The work of engineering managers is four dimensional. Engineering managers need to 
interface with and manage the interactions with subordinates, as well as coordinate their 
own management actions with those of other managers and peer groups. They manage 
their own time and efforts. They also attempt to anticipate the requirements of their supe-
riors by making recommendations for future courses of action. Figure 1.4 illustrates this 
four-dimensional nature of work.
Engineering managers plan, organize, lead, and control people, teams, money, tech-
nology, facilities, and other resources to achieve the business objectives of the company. 
To ensure company operations for the short term, they pay attention to problem solving 
and conflict resolution. As a rule, engineering managers do not perform the technical 
work themselves. Instead, they work through people. Their job is to decide what the unit, 
department, or company should be doing to advance the objectives of the company and 
then assign resources to implement their decisions.
An illustration of managerial concern is an issue related to product development. Some 
companies initiate new product development on a market-driven basis. First, they use 
market surveys and customer feedback to define product concepts of potential interest to 
customers. Then they secure resources to develop the product concepts, manufacture the

prototypes, conduct tests of a prototype to further improve design details, and offer cus-
tomer services to market the products involved. Doing so allows them a high probability 
of achieving commercial success. Other companies adopt a technology-driven approach. 
They first invent and develop new technology, and then they incorporate the resulting 
inventions and innovations in products that they hope to sell to the marketplace. Each of 
these approaches has advantages and disadvantages. Surveys show that both approaches 
have yielded successes and failures.
Another example is the potential difference in opinion between departments when 
deciding on “buy versus build” options and on setting task priorities. Still another area of 
potential disagreement is the choice about the level of standardization in product design 
that reduces cost while allowing a sufficient level of innovation to enhance competitive-
ness. In general, enforcing a high level of standardization with strict rules and guide-
lines tends to impede creativity and innovation, as illustrated by Figure 1.5. Managers 
are expected to constantly interact and work closely with other managers to resolve such 
differences.
For those engineers who elect to become managers, there are skills that can be readily 
learned to make them more efficient and effective. These include time management, work 
habits, people-related skills (such as team building, communications, and motivation), and 
use of decision support tools (e.g., multicriteria decision-making [Triantaphyllou 2010], 
what-if analysis by modeling, risk analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, forecasting, statistics, 
regression, linear programming, optimization, and office technologies).
Example 1.2
The company wants to develop a new product to preemptively enter the marketplace. 
Current information from marketing is sketchy, and the market size cannot be pre-
dicted accurately. Indications are that foreign imports are about to foray the market, 
causing the company to lose the precious opportunity of a preemptive entry.
Should the company initiate a product development program now or wait for more 
marketing information? Are there other options available to the company?
Answer 1.2
Yes, there is a third option: The company can act as a distributor and import the foreign 
product itself, but with its own brand name. This will allow the company to gauge 
the market acceptance of a low-quality and low-price product. If the results show that

customers like the product and the market size is large, then the company can continue 
importing or develop a low-cost alternative to compete.
Selling a foreign product under the company name requires that the company enter 
into a private-label production contract with the foreign producer. Typically, such an 
arrangement includes some of the following elements:
•	 The contract is good for a predetermined period (e.g., two years) and renew-
able with mutual consent. The company agrees to pay a unit product cost of 
x dollars for at least y units per year. The foreign producer agrees to hold the 
product defect rate at or below z per thousand. The foreign producer remains 
an exclusive subcontractor to the company for the product types in question 
during the contract period.
•	 The company respects all proprietary design and other know-how of the for-
eign producer. The company is obliged not to use any proprietary design of the 
foreign producer for the development of its own product or for use by its new 
production partners.
•	 The company is responsible for marketing, distributing, selling, and serv-
ing the product in the target market (e.g., the United States). The foreign pro-
ducer agrees to upgrade product design, based on the marketing inputs of the 
company.
•	 The company strives to invest in the foreign producer for creating the next gen-
eration of products. The foreign producer has the first-refusal rights to accept 
such investment (i.e., funds and technology).
•	 Each party can cancel the arrangement after an initial period of collaboration. 
The foreign producer can go to someone else for marketing the product in the 
target market. The company may develop its own products or engage another 
foreign producer as a subcontractor. Thus, selling the foreign product does 
not preclude the company from selling a similar product after the contract has 
expired. Companies change subcontractors all the time.
Such a private-label production arrangement is typically a win–win arrangement. 
The company can preemptively explore the market—that is, test the market and get 
valuable feedback from customers regarding useful product features—without spend-
ing a lot of resources. The foreign producer achieves instant profitability that is assured 
for the contract period, plus the potential of additional future investment from the com-
pany for the next-generation product design and production.
1.6  Becoming Effective Managers in the New Millennium
Future STEM professionals interested in assuming leadership roles in industry need to 
acquire the useful T-personality by having a broad set of skills for managing relationships, 
communicating and collaborating with others in multiple disciplines, and envisioning the 
future to define what are the best courses of action to take in moving forward. They also 
need to possess in-depth skills in specific domains to enable them to actually implement 
some of the required work.
The basic functions of engineering management provide engineers and engineer-
ing managers with foundational skills to manage themselves, staff, teams, projects, 
technologies, suppliers, and global issues of importance. Engineers innovate to solve 

17
Introduction to Management Challenges for Engineers
problems and minimize conflicts to achieve the company’s objectives. They follow the 
best practices in industry to monitor and control internal operations. They use proper 
methods to make rational decisions and take lawful and ethical actions (Eisenfuehr 
2010).
To facilitate the interaction with peer groups and units, it would be advisable for engi-
neering managers to acquire a broadened background in cost accounting, financial 
analysis, managerial finance, and marketing management. Thus, the special cases of activ-
ity-based costing, ratio analysis, risk analysis by the Monte Carlo method, economic value-
added accounting, and marketing strategies are elucidated in Chapters 6 through 8. It is 
believed that these new building blocks of added knowledge would enable engineers and 
engineering managers to gain a better appreciation of the business of the company and its 
stakeholders.
A critical step to developing technological projects is the acquisition and incorpora-
tion of customer feedback. By understanding the project evaluation criteria and the tools 
of financial analysis, engineers and engineering managers will be in a better position to 
secure project approvals. For them to lead, a major challenge is indeed the initiation, devel-
opment, and implementation of major technological projects that contribute to the long-
term profitability of the company.
The discussions on ethics, engineers as leaders, and Internet-based enablers for foster-
ing operational excellence provide additional building blocks to enhance the prepara-
tion of engineers and engineering managers to assume technology leadership positions. 
Operational excellence encompasses all activities that enhance productivity and improve 
effectiveness (such as applying enterprise resources planning tools, making procure-
ment more efficient via e-markets, enhancing customer services through Internet portals, 
improving logistics using global positioning systems, etc.). Many tried-and-true rules are 
included that serve as good guidelines for engineers and engineering managers to become 
excellent leaders. Above all, so that they constantly augment the satisfaction of customers, 
engineering managers are expected to lead by their vision of how to utilize company core 
competencies to add value; by their insights into how to capture opportunities offered by 
emerging technologies; and by their innovating ability in making products and services 
better, faster, and cheaper. The concepts of value addition, customer focus, time-to-market 
speed, mass customization, supply chains, enterprise resources integration, and others are 
also reviewed.
Globalization is a major business trend that will affect many enterprises in the next 
decades (Ritzer 2015). Knowledge of globalization expands the perspectives of engineers 
and engineering managers with respect to divergences in culture, business practices, 
and value. Engineers and engineering managers must become sensitive to the issues 
involved and prepare themselves to contribute to enterprises that wish to capture new 
business opportunities offered by the high-growth global markets in emerging coun-
tries. Engineers and engineering managers need to be aware of the potential effects of 
job migration due to globalization and take steps to prepare themselves to meet such 
challenges.
STEM professionals aspiring to leadership roles in the future should strive to practice the 
engineering management functions (such as planning, organizing, leading, and control-
ling) as applied to teams, projects, and programs, while making use of their understand-
ing of business fundamentals (cost accounting, financial analysis and management, and 
marketing management), to exert their leadership roles in creating strategic differentiation 
and operational excellence for their employers.

18
Engineering Management
Example 1.3
John Snyder, an engineering manager, presented to the board of directors a project based 
on the results generated by Steve Hill, one of his staff members. The board approved 
the project and praised John for the excellent work done. At that moment, John failed to 
mention to the board that the work was actually done by Steve. Afterward, John felt bad 
about it and recommended to give Steve a bonus.
How would you assess John’s handling of this situation?
Answer 1.3
It would have been more correct for John to initially point out to the board that Steve 
was the one who did the actual work. However, John’s way of handling this situation is 
acceptable in industry, since he did eventually recognize Steve’s contribution by offer-
ing a bonus. John should follow through by including Steve in his subsequent monthly 
progress reports to his boss, the vice president of engineering, to set the records straight 
and by formally recognizing Steve’s work in a staff meeting.
1.7  Conclusions
Products and services are typically offered by for-profit enterprises in industry, which in 
turn engage highly skilled STEM professionals to perform various value-adding tasks. 
These professionals interact with their in-house counterparts, as well as with stakehold-
ers external to their organizations (such as customers and suppliers) for work related to 
the design, testing, marketing, and production of their specific products and services. 
The skills required for STEM professionals to succeed in industry are thus complex and 
demanding, as illustrated in this chapter.
For STEM professionals to become ready to assume leadership roles in industry, they 
need to prepare themselves properly, by acquiring a customer-oriented mind-set, display-
ing the T-personality to contribute to both strategic differentiations (creating novel prod-
ucts/services) and operational excellence (improving process efficiency and enhancing the 
cost-effectiveness of all operations) of their enterprises.
It is suggested that STEM leadership be built by adding value through the creation of 
strategic differentiation (in new products and services) and operational excellence (process 
efficiency and productivity) for employers, while focusing on actively pursuing creativ-
ity and innovation in an ethical manner in a globalized environment, and utilizing basic 
skills in managerial fundamentals (planning, organizing, leading, and controlling) and 
business fundamentals (accounting, finance, and marketing management). This book con-
tains three sections, which include:
 
1.	Engineering management fundamentals (planning, organizing, leading, and 
controlling)
	
2.	Business fundamentals (accounting, finance, and marketing management)
	
3.	Leadership in the new millennium (leadership preparation, ethics, globalization, 
and operational excellence)
These three sections are specifically designed to address these domain skills and knowl-
edge to foster the building of STEM leaders in the globalized environment.

Introduction to Management Challenges for Engineers
A large number of themes permeate this book. The principal objective of this book is 
to offer comprehensive discussions on engineering management functions, business fun-
damentals, and STEM leadership, which are designed to provide a broad foundation for 
preparing STEM professionals to meet their future challenges in the new millennium.
QUESTIONS
	
1.	Tom Taylor, the sales manager, was told by his superior, Carl Bauer, to take an 
order from a new customer for a batch of products. Both Tom and Carl knew that 
the products ordered would only partially meet the customer’s requirements. But 
Carl insisted that the order was too valuable to lose. What should Tom do?
	
2.	Nancy Bush, the plant manager, needs to decide whether to make or buy a compo-
nent for the company’s core product. She would like the advice of her production 
supervisors, since they must implement her decision. However, she fears that the 
supervisors will be biased toward making the component in-house, as they tend 
to favor retaining more work for their people. What should Nancy do?
	
3.	Student A, in order to graduate on February 4, works hard to finish her master of 
engineering report by the due date of January 8. She is planning to return to her 
home country immediately thereafter and get married. If she graduates on June 
10, the next available graduation date, she will have to pay a tuition fee to keep her 
student status active for one more semester. That would be a substantial financial 
burden for her.
	
	
Her advisor, Professor B, is hesitant to accept the report as presented. The 
report includes a major marketing activity designed by Student A to promote the 
new service package of a local company. Because of logistics, this major market-
ing activity is scheduled to take place on January 20. No customer feedback data, 
which are required to demonstrate the value brought about by the report, are 
available before January 8. Professor B cannot bend the rules to pass the report 
without these data.
	
	
Put your innovation hat on and recommend a way to resolve this conflict.
	
4.	The engineering manager of Company A proposes to install an automated bar-
code scanner costing $4000. He estimates that he can save about 100 hours of labor 
time per month, as products can now be scanned much faster. He reasons that at 
the wage rate of $15 per hour, the benefit for using the automated bar-code scanner 
is $1500 per month, and the scanner can be paid back in 2.67 months.
	
	
As the president of Company A, do you agree or disagree with the way he com-
putes the cost–benefit ratio? Why or why not?
	
5.	The new millennium imposes a number of challenges on business managers, who 
are different from engineering managers and technology managers. Name a few 
such challenges.
	
6.	In the literature, it is generally said that innovations in the service sectors are lag-
ging behind those in the manufacturing sectors. Explain why this might indeed 
be so.
	
7.	There have been a number of articles in the business literature proclaiming the 
potentially large contributions that data mining could make to the service sectors. 
Show an example in which the application of data mining had actually made a 
difference to a service company.

Section I
The Functions of 
Engineering Management
Section I of this book addresses the basic functions of engineering management, such 
as planning (Chapter  2), organizing (Chapter  3), leading (Chapter  4), and controlling 
(Chapter 5). These functions provide science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) 
professionals and managers with foundation skills to manage themselves, staff, teams, 
projects, technologies, and global issues of importance.
Best practices are emphasized as pertinent standards for goal setting and performance 
measurement. STEM professionals and managers solve problems and minimize conflicts 
to achieve the company’s objectives. They use the Rational Decision method, among oth-
ers, to make decisions and take lawful and ethical action. They apply Monte Carlo methods 
to assess projects involving risks and uncertainties. They engage emerging technologies, 
motivate a professional workforce of diverse backgrounds, develop new generations of 
products and services in a timely manner, and constantly surpass the best practices in 
industry.
The roles of STEM professionals and managers in strategic planning, employee selection, 
team building, delegating, decision-making, and managing creativity and innovations are 
explained. The development of managerial competencies is emphasized.

Planning
2.1  Introduction
Planning, a major function of engineering management, is the work done by an engi-
neering manager to predetermine a course of action. Planning defines who will do 
what, how, where, when, with which resources, and for what objectives. The purpose 
of planning is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the company by providing 
focus and direction (Daft 2015; Institute of Leadership & Management 2007; Zucker 2007; 
Axson 2010).
Planning is made necessary by rapid changes in technology (such as Internet-based man-
agement tools, enterprise resource planning software, big data analytics, broadband com-
munications options, and mobile access), the environment (customers, global resources, 
competition, and marketplace), and organizations (such as mergers, acquisitions, supply 
chain networks, alliances, and joint ventures). Louis Pasteur said, “Chance favors the pre-
pared mind.”
In this chapter, we will discuss the differences between strategic and operational plan-
ning, the planning roles of engineering managers, and the four specific planning activities 
(i.e., forecasting, action planning, issuing policy, and establishing procedure) that every 
engineering manager needs to master.
2.2  Types of Planning
Managers at various levels in a company engage in two types of planning: strategic plan-
ning and operational planning. Both types of planning add value to the company.
2.2.1  Strategic Planning
Strategic planning sets the goals, purpose, and direction of a company. The top-level 
engineering managers (i.e., chief executive officer [CEO], chief technology officer, and 
vice president of engineering) are usually involved in strategic planning for the company 
(Johnson 2015; Fogg 2010).
Strategic planning focuses on identifying worthwhile future activities. Specifically, 
strategic planning ensures that the company applies its resources—core competencies, 
corporate know-how, proprietary technologies, skilled manpower resources, business rela-
tionships, and so on—effectively to achieve the short- and long-term goals of the company 

24
Engineering Management
(Akdeniz 2015). The company’s future is painted on a wide canvas. The plan must have 
much foresight. It deals with questions such as
	
1.	What are the company’s mission, vision, and value system? The mission statement 
of a company defines why the company exists in the first place, which market seg-
ments it serves, and what it will do to serve them. The vision statement spells out 
the aspirations of the company with respect to its asset size, market position, busi-
ness standing, ranking in industrial sectors, and other such metrics. The value 
system is the externalization of five or six specific corporate values emphasized by 
the company. Some typical values favored by U.S. industrial companies include 
quality, innovation, social responsibility, stability, honesty, quality of life, and 
empowerment.
	
2.	What business should the company be in?
	
3.	Does the company need to change its product portfolio, market coverage, pro-
duction system, or service capabilities? If so, why? Strategies of constant change 
develop a chameleon culture in which the organization seeks to reinvent itself to 
become leaner, flatter, more flexible, and more profitable.
	
4.	What specific goals (such as profitability, market share, sales revenue, technology 
leadership position, global penetration, etc.) should the company accomplish, by 
when, with what investment, and by which core competencies?
	
5.	What business networks should the company establish via supplier alliances, 
co-marketing partnerships, production joint ventures, and other forms of 
collaboration?
	
6.	Which new products should the company offer?
	
7.	What core technologies should the company maintain, develop, acquire, or 
utilize?
	
8.	Which performance metrics are to be used for monitoring the company’s 
progress?
	
9.	How should the company tackle the daunting challenge of making innovation 
central to the company’s products, processes, or relationships?
Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals who participate in 
such planning activities know that they need to set aside their parochial technology mind-
set and look at the broader picture. They also know that they need to keep lots of iron in 
the fire and it is whichever ones are coming to fruition that they go with. The horizon of 
strategic planning is usually spread over 5–10 years, although it may be reviewed at more 
frequent intervals to adjust to potential changes in the marketplace.
2.2.2  Operational Planning
Managers at both middle level (managers and directors) and lower level (supervisors and 
group leaders) perform operational planning to define the specific tactics and action steps 
needed to accomplish the goals specified by top management (Duggan 2011). Managers 
and directors break down the company goals into short-term objectives. Supervisors and 
group leaders specify events and tasks that can be implemented with the least amount 
of resources within the shortest period of time. Operational planning ensures that the 

25
Planning
company applies its resources efficiently to achieve its stated goals. Questions considered 
in operational planning include the following:
	
1.	What is the most efficient way of accomplishing a project with known objectives?
	
2.	What is the best way to link up with three top suppliers in the marketplace for 
needed parts?
	
3.	What are the operational guidelines for performing specific work?
Operational planning involves a process of analysis by which a corporate goal or a set 
of corporate intentions is to be accomplished by performing a group of action steps. These 
steps are then formalized for easy implementation. Furthermore, the consequences for 
the business are articulated at each step. Operational planning focuses on the preserva-
tion and rearrangement of established categories (e.g., major strategies defined by upper 
management, existing products, and organizational structures). Operational planning is 
essentially a programming task that is aimed at making the attainment of various strate-
gic goals possible. Operational planning is also called platform-based planning because it 
extrapolates future results from a well-understood, predictable platform of past experi-
ence. The results of such planning are predictable because they are based on solid knowl-
edge rather than assumptions.
Compared with strategic planning, operational planning is easier for engineers to 
accomplish because past experience and examples are usually available as references.
2.3  Who Should Do the Planning?
Planning is best accomplished by those who have direct knowledge of the specific sub-
ject matter involved. In the past, strategic planning was accorded emphasis and atten-
tion by the top management of an enterprise. Company after company set up high-level 
corporate planning departments made up of full-time planners to devise business strate-
gies. This approach failed to generate the expected business results. As documented in 
the literature, one of the key weaknesses of this approach was that the strategic planners, 
while being superior analysts of hard business data, were outsiders insofar as the various 
specific business functions (marketing, production, engineering, and procurements) were 
concerned. What was not apparent at the time was the fact that planning new strategies 
for the future required both hard data and intuitive assumptions. The success of the deci-
sion to introduce assumptions, and the extent to which these assumptions could be vali-
dated, depended very much on the planner’s hands-on management experience, intuitive 
know-how, and in-depth insight of the specific business activities involved. As such, many 
plans devised by these strategists were poor. Furthermore, business managers in operat-
ing departments did not wholeheartedly embrace the plans envisaged by these outsiders. 
Since then, many companies have abolished their corporate strategic planning depart-
ments altogether and have reassigned this important planning function to the leaders of 
the business units themselves.
The moral of the story is that the most effective way of creating strategic plans for 
specific businesses or activities is to entrust such planning to those who are intimately 
involved with the particular businesses and activities. This paradigm is consistent with 

26
Engineering Management
the empowerment doctrine, being the current industrial best practice, whereby decisions 
are delegated downward to lower-level persons who have direct knowledge and in-depth 
understanding of the subject matter at hand.
2.4  Inexact Nature of Strategic Planning
Strategic planning requires an immense amount of critical thinking (Spender 2014). It also 
involves synthesis that likewise requires intuition and creativity. Performing strategic 
thinking will bring about an integrated perspective of the enterprise, a foresight—albeit 
not too precisely articulated—of the company’s direction that is built on insights from 
experience as well as hard data from market research, as it is based on learning by people 
at various levels involved in conducting specific business activities. Strategic planning 
invents new categories rather than rearranging existing ones, and synthesizes experience 
to move the company in a new direction. Managers should encourage others to join in the 
journey and to shape the company’s course, thus creating enthusiasm along the way. Broad 
participation is therefore strongly advisable.
Strategic planners use various kinds of inputs. Study after study has shown that, in addi-
tion to hard data, the most effective managers rely on soft information—gossip, hearsay, 
and various other intangible scraps of information—to develop plans. A key part of stra-
tegic planning is to create a vision for the company of what the company aspires to be. To 
formulate such a vision, the planners must be able to “see.” This is only likely when they 
are willing to get their hands dirty digging for ideas and extracting the strategic messages 
from them. Collecting these ideas as building blocks is instrumental to the development 
of useful strategic plans. Sanford Weill said insightfully, “Details create the big picture.”
Once information becomes available, strategic thinkers comprehend it, synthesize it, and 
learn from it. They test ideas and verify the convergence of ideas before they define new 
strategies. Sometimes, strategies must be left in flexible forms, such as broad visions, in 
order to adapt to a changing business environment.
Strategic planning may be undertaken following a “discovery-driven approach” 
(McGrath 2010). In situations involving the definition of the company’s future direction, 
most planning inputs are based on assumptions about the future. Because the ratio of 
assumptions to facts is usually high, the success rate of the resulting plans is typically 
low. Therefore, strategic planning should be a continuous process and not a single task 
or event to be taken care of at well-defined milestone dates. It involves constant learning, 
acquisition, and interpretation of hard data and soft information, as well as staff discus-
sions related to operational feasibility, resource allocation, and performance management. 
Strategic planning requires the discipline of systematically identifying and validating key 
assumptions introduced in the planning. As more data and knowledge are discovered, 
more assumptions are validated to form an increasingly solid knowledge base for updat-
ing the planning. Strategic planners should engage many participants at various levels to 
benefit from the relevant corporate expertise and broad-based perspectives available.
The major difficulties of strategic planning can be traced back to three inherent charac-
teristics of such planning:
	
1.	Prediction of the future: Certain future events are more predictable than others; for 
example, seasonal variations of weather and election-year cycles. Other predic-
tions, such as the forecast of discontinuities—technological innovations, price 

27
Planning
increases, changes in governmental regulations affecting marketplace competi-
tion, geopolitical turbulences, and so on—are virtually impossible to predict 
accurately.
	
2.	Applicable experience and insight: Strategies cannot be detached from the subject 
involved. Planners must have in-depth knowledge and relevant hands-on experi-
ence of the subject at hand in order to set forth useful strategies.
	
3.	Random process of strategy making: The strategy-making process cannot be formal-
ized, as it is not a deductive, but a synthesis process.
Studies have shown that strategic plans often fail due to one or more of the following 
seven reasons:
	
1.	Not thinking strategically; for example, by limiting the strategy only to the short-
term needs and processes of the company.
	
2.	Failure to identify critical success factors for the company.
	
3.	Not having both an internal and an external focus.
	
4.	Lack of long-term commitment from company management.
	
5.	Reluctance of senior management to accept responsibility for tough decisions.
	
6.	Not leaving enough flexibility in the plans, thus causing difficulties in adjusting to 
the changing environment.
	
7.	Failure to properly communicate the plan and thus not securing support and 
management buy-in.
It is advisable for those STEM professionals, who are involved in strategic planning, to 
avoid being affected by these failure factors.
2.4.1  Methods Used to Plan Strategically
In adopting strategies, companies choose what to do and what not to do. Strategizing is 
about making choices. In general, managers use three methods to make choices (Gavetti 
and Rivkin 2005):
	
1.	Deduction: Based on data, managers invoke general administrative and economic 
principles to a specific situation, weigh alternatives, and make rational choices. 
This method needs a lot of data, and is useful for mature and stable industries.
	
2.	Trial and error: Experiment with several options and select one. This is good for 
ambiguous, novel, or complex situations in order to experiment and learn from the 
experience.
	
3.	Analogies: Various strategies are made by analogies. Decision-makers often need 
to think back to a familiar situation, draw lessons from it, and apply those les-
sons to the current situation. However, making decision by analogy must be done 
carefully.
Using analogies, managers pay attention to selected features of a situation, as opposed 
to every aspect. The case study method works toward building students’ analytical 
thinking based on past experience in order to enable the transfer of lessons from one 

28
Engineering Management
industry to another. To maximize the effectiveness of the analogy method in strategic 
thinking, managers must be able to recognize similarities along dimensions that truly 
drive business performance, and not be fooled by superficial similarities between 
sources and targets. There are four ways to avoid superficial similarity when practicing 
analogies:
	
1.	Recognize the analogy and identify its purpose: Is there an analogy between the source 
and the target to allow the target to contribute to a desired purpose?
	
2.	Understand the source (old case): Define the environment, the solutions that worked 
well in that environment, and the link between the environment and the winning 
strategy. Then, check if the relationships discovered here applied to the target 
environment.
	
3.	Assess the similarities and differences between the sources and the target: Are the simi-
larities only superficial? Do the similarities exist along critical dimensions (e.g., 
dimensions that drive economic performance)?
	
4.	Translate, decide, and adapt: Decide whether the original strategy, properly trans-
lated, will work in the target situation.
Other uncertainties that impede analytical reasoning are emotional attachment to an 
early choice and the halo effect—decision-makers seek out supporting evidence and 
ignore conflicting data (e.g., confirmation biases). The best approach of strategy planning 
involves using all three methods (deduction, experimenting, and analogy).
Example 2.1
The method of analogy is important for developing strategic thinking. How can this 
method be applied systematically and in a rational manner to minimize its potential 
misuse?
Answer 2.1
The following rational method may be useful when applying the analogy methodology 
in strategic planning:
	
1.	 List dimensions that characterize the source case, and which represent the past 
known case. The solution to the past case is to potentially apply the present 
case, the “target case.” One such dimension is “linkage between solution and 
the achieved success in the past case.” It is important that such linkages exist 
between cases in order to justify the use of the past case solution.
	
2.	 In describing the past case, classify the dimensions as “major” or “minor.”
	
3.	 List some key attributes of the past case in each dimension.
	
4.	 Evaluate the present case in each of the listed dimensions in terms of relevant 
attributes.
	
5.	 Compare the attributes of the present case with those of the past case.
	
6.	 Assess the degree of similarity and difference between the two.
	
7.	 Enter the result in the last column, “similar,” “somewhat,” or “no.” Of course, it 
is crucial that the major dimensions are assessed correctly. If they are deemed 
similar, then the present case can be determined as possessing a “deep similar-
ity” with the past case.
	
8.	 Apply the solution to the past case as the strategic solution to the present case, 
only if a similarity is sufficiently established (see Table 2.1).

2.4.2  Technique to Gain Strategic Insights
Companies must consider the external environment, such as customers and competition, 
when they plan strategically. Ubany and Davis (2007) offer a special “Three Circles” tech-
nique to deepen strategic insights (see Figure 2.1).
Let us draw three circles, one for a customer’s needs, one for a company’s offerings, and 
one for a competitor’s offerings. When a company’s or a competitor’s offerings match with 
a customer’s needs, these circles overlap. Specifically:
A: Area representing our advantages. How big and sustainable are our advantages? 
Are they based on distinctive capabilities?
B: Area designating points at parity. This area indicates that we are on par with our 
competitors. Are we delivering effectively in the area of parity?
C: Areas depicting our competitor’s strength. How can we counter our competitor’s 
advantages?
E: White space. This is the area for growth. Ask customers how our strengths can be 
made useful to them?
D, F, and G: Areas denoting values produced by the company and the competitors 
that the customers do not need.

Engineering Management
A key planning question to ask is: How can we devise strategies that would increase 
area A, while reducing D and F.
2.5  Planning Roles of Engineering Managers
Engineering managers at the middle and low levels will predominantly devise operational 
plans to achieve the short-term goals of the unit or department. As engineering managers 
move up the corporate ladder, they are expected to participate increasingly in strategic 
planning, with emphasis placed on technology, product, and production planning. They 
may find it useful to follow the planning guidelines listed next, in order to add value to 
the company.
It is important that engineering managers spend time and effort to actively assist their 
direct superiors in planning. These tasks may include (1) analyzing hard data (industry, 
competition, and marketing); (2) offering alternative interpretations of the data available; 
(3) raising insightful questions to challenge conventional assumptions; and (4) commu-
nicating the resulting outputs of planning—programs, schedules, and budgets—to help 
effectuate buy-in from others.
To optimally benefit from the knowledge, expertise, and insights of staff, engineer-
ing managers are encouraged to engage their staff and other employees in the planning 
activities.
It is quite self-evident that engineering managers need to perform a number of planning 
tasks:
2.5.1  Time Management
All managers need to plan and prioritize their personal daily tasks (such as problem solv-
ing, staff meetings, task specification, progress monitoring, and performance evaluation), 
according to the value each task may add, so that high-value tasks are completed before 
others. This is to maximize the value contributed by their daily activities (Feddox 2014). 
Also to be included in the daily to-do list are tasks such as networking, continuing educa-
tion, and scanning emerging technologies, which are deemed important for advancing 
one’s own career.
2.5.2  Projects and Programs
Engineering managers need to plan projects and programs assigned to them by upper 
management. In doing so, they need to fully understand the applicable project objec-
tives, the relevant performance metrics used to measure outcome, and the significance 
of this outcome to the company. They should carefully select staff members with the 
relevant skills, expertise, and personality to participate in the project and seek their 
inputs regarding tasks, resource requirements, preferred methodologies, and task 
duration. They should then integrate all inputs to draft a project plan and distribute 
the plan among all participants to iteratively finalize the relevant details. These details 
include budgets, deliverables, and dates of completion. Managers must also secure 
authorization from upper management before initiating work related to the projects 
and programs.

31
Planning
2.5.3  Corporate Know-How
The preservation of corporate know-how is of critical importance to the company for 
maintaining and enhancing its competitiveness in the marketplace. Corporate know-
how comes in many types and forms. Certain documentable knowledge, such as patents, 
published memoranda, operational manuals, and troubleshooting guides, is easy to save. 
Others, such as insights related to procedures or perfected ways of designing the specific 
products and services of the company, may require extra efforts to preserve. Managers 
should plan to systematically capture, retain, and widely disseminate such know-how 
to maximize its use within the company. Certain other cognitive knowledge is typically 
retained mentally by the experts. Managers need to find effective ways to induce such 
experts to willingly externalize this tacit knowledge for use by others in the company.
Problem-solving expertise is yet another type of corporate know-how worth preserv-
ing. Typically, engineering managers are busy resolving conflicts that may arise from dis-
agreements in task priorities, personality conflicts, customer complaints, interpretation of 
data, and other conflicts. Managers need to solve these problems promptly. They should be 
mentally prepared to jump from one task to another to handle such time-sensitive issues. 
What should be planned under these circumstances is the preservation of the learning 
experience garnered from each incident so that the company will become more efficient in 
solving similar problems in the future.
2.5.4  Proactive Tasks
Engineering managers should plan to devote their efforts to proactively pursue certain 
other tasks. These tasks include
•	 Utilizing new technologies to simplify and enhance the products and services of 
the company.
•	 Creating business networks and searching for partners to form mutually benefi-
cial alliances.
•	 Offering new or enhanced services to customers (e.g., self-service, an information-
on-demand system, and an Internet-based inquiry center).
•	 Initiating new programs to promote healthy customer relationships.
•	 Developing novel products/services with distinguishable attributes (e.g., product 
customization to serve customers better, cheaper, and faster).
•	 Reengineering and simplifying specific operational processes to increase 
efficiency.
•	 Outsourcing specific tasks to augment cost-effectiveness and to reduce time to 
market.
2.6  Tools for Planning
Engineering managers utilize a number of tools to prepare strategic plans. Some of these 
tools produce hard data, whereas others offer qualitative insights into specific subject 
areas (ASQ Quality Press 2011). The following are examples of some useful planning tools:

32
Engineering Management
2.6.1  Market Research
Market research applies a number of tools to discover the preference of customers with 
respect to the company’s products, services, marketing strategy, product prices, competi-
tive strengths, and brand reputation in the marketplace. Examples of such tools include 
polling by questionnaires, product concept testing, focus groups, and pilot testing. The 
outputs of market research help assess the company’s current marketing position and 
future growth opportunities in the marketplace (Burns and Bush 2013; Malhotra 2014).
2.6.2  SWOT Analysis
SWOT is the abbreviation for strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats. Each com-
pany has strengths and weaknesses in comparison to its competitors (Mcguire 2014). 
Because of the company’s strengths or core competencies, there may be opportunities 
offered in the marketplace that the company ought to exploit aggressively. On the other 
hand, because of the strengths of its competitors and the conditions in the marketplace, 
the company may be subjected to certain future threats. Such potential threats could be the 
result of technology advancement, business alliances, marketing partnerships, and other 
such step changes accomplished by the competition. New governmental regulations and 
policies may also affect the company’s business in the future.
A systematic monitoring of publications—patents, technical articles, news releases, and 
financial reports—represents an initial step in conducting a competitive analysis. A well-
performed SWOT analysis will bring to the fore an assessment of the company’s current 
position. As such, the SWOT analysis procreates a road map by which a company can 
make informed decisions about improving its core competencies to meet its current and 
future business and operational needs. The analysis answers questions such as (a) What 
does the company have in place today? (b) In which direction is the company headed in 
the next three to five years, and (c) What is the company’s process of managing changes?
2.6.3  Financial What-If Analysis and Modeling
Spreadsheets are useful in modeling the financial performance of an operation. Financial 
statements (such as an income statement, balance sheet, and funds flow statement—see 
Section 7.3) are usually modeled in a spreadsheet program. What-if analyses are readily 
performed to discover the sensitivity of the company’s financial performance relative to 
the changes of specific input variables. In addition, such analyses permit the verification of 
various assumptions incorporated into the financial models (Ragsdale 2014).
Most businesses have inherent risks due to the unpredictable nature of the business 
climate, the liquidity of financial markets, certain governmental regulations and interna-
tional trade policies, currency stability, customer preferences, competition in the market-
place, disruptions induced by new technologies, and other factors. What-if analyses and 
Monte Carlo simulations (see Section 6.4) may be applied to assess the impact of some of 
these risk factors on a company’s business.
2.6.4  Scenario Planning
Scenario planning defines the major forces that may move a company in different direc-
tions, maps out a small number of alternatives futures (scenarios), defines narratives to 
describe these scenarios, and develops options for managing within these future worlds 

33
Planning
(Garvin and Levesque 2006). Figure 2.2 shows the scenario planning process involving a 
number of components.
The key focal issue represents a significant upcoming decision or a strategic uncertainty. 
The driving forces are themes and trends that are most likely to influence the key focal 
issue in fundamental ways. Examples include social dynamics, economics, political affairs, 
and technology. Some of these driving forces are more important than others. The top two 
and most influential of these driving forces represent critical uncertainties. Using critical 
uncertainties as axes, a 2 × 2 map, the scenario framework, is created. This 2 × 2 map defines 
four quadrants, the four futures, which will influence a company’s future directions. Each 
of these four scenarios is then written up as a story. Planning participants then deliberate 
on the implications of these four stories with respect to the key focal issue at hand. This 
group’s deliberations will likely result in the identification of the company’s strengths and 
weaknesses, as well as define strategic options for future directions. Early warning signals 
are leading indicators that highlight the likely emergence of one scenario or another. These 
signals must be constantly monitored in order to initiate a strategic reevaluation.
Why do we limit ourselves to only two critical uncertainties in the scenario planning 
process? This is possibly because business people will typically use two-dimensional dia-
grams (2 × 2 maps), which are easily transposed onto paper to describe product positioning, 
product classification, and business-related issues. Engineers are capable of envisioning 
three-dimensional diagrams. Thus, the aforementioned concept could be easily extended 
to three key uncertainties, providing a total of 8 (=2^3) scenarios for possible consideration 
when each future is affected by three uncertain driving forces. Three uncertainties are 
more realistic than two in evaluating the future of businesses. Molecular physicists are 
trained to define the “state” of molecules by seven variables, namely, three spatial coor-
dinates, three velocity components, and one time variable. They typically think in seven-
dimensional space and use a seven-dimensional distribution function to define the state of 
a molecule. Thus, one can easily envision a scenario defined by seven (not two) uncertain-
ties, offering many more scenarios for consideration. Engineering managers should try

Engineering Management
to use at least three key uncertainties for scenario planning. Table 2.2 shows eight futures 
influenced by three uncertainties.
As pointed out by Schoemaker (1995), scenario planning can capture a whole range 
of possibilities in rich detail. It is a disciplined method for imagining possible futures. 
Scenario planning reduces a lot of data into a limited number of possible states. Each sce-
nario tells a story about how various factors interact. Scenario planning is different from 
the following:
	
1.	Contingency planning examines only one uncertainty: What if we don’t get the pat-
ent? Contingency planning starts with a base case and considers an exception 
to it (what-if analysis). Scenario planning, on the other hand, explores the joint 
impact of various uncertainties that take place concurrently. It tries to determine 
the new state, as a result of the concurrent changing of several independent 
variables.
	
2.	Sensitivity analysis examines the effect of a change of one variable: While keeping all 
other variables constant. This approach is effective for monitoring small magni-
tude changes in order to determine new states.
	
3.	Not the same as complex computer simulations: Scenarios can include elements that 
cannot be modeled, such as subjective judgments.
Whenever the future needs to be assessed, scenario planning is applicable. It applies 
generally to decision-making under uncertainty. The methods of developing scenario 
planning include the following:
	
1.	Define the scope
	
2.	Identify the major stakeholders
	
3.	Identify basic trends
	
4.	Identify key uncertainties
	
5.	Construct initial scenario themes
	
6.	Check for consistency and plausibility
	
7.	Develop learning scenarios
	
8.	Identify research needs

9.	Develop qualitative models
	 10.	Evolve toward decision scenarios
Scenarios should describe generically different futures rather than variations on one 
theme. Schoemaker’s (1995) article contains an example of scenario planning for an adver-
tising agency.
Garvin and Schoemaker (2006) pointed out that “there is no right or wrong scenario.” 
Scenario planning has a number of advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are
	
1.	Prepares managers for multiple, alternative futures.
	
2.	Creates a common vocabulary.
	
3.	Encourages strategic conversations.
	
4.	Forces managers to articulate critical uncertainties.
	
5.	Considers the interactions between these uncertainties and the likely implications.
	
6.	Legitimizes divergent ways of thinking that are essential for success.
What are some of the disadvantages of scenario planning? These could include:
	
1.	Is scenario planning no more than “pipe dreams and happy talk?”
	
2.	Does it encourage wishful thinking and lead to a desire for one particular future 
and outcome?
	
3.	Is the absence of a tight link between scenario planning and formal goal setting 
and action planning a cause for concern?
2.6.5  Performance Benchmarks
Performance benchmarks are those that have been successfully applied by successful firms 
in the same or a related industry. When undertaking planning activities, it is important to 
define these benchmarks for the purpose of measuring corporate progress. Hubbard (2014) 
offers an excellent set of broad-based benchmarks, which include:
	
1.	Customer-related measures: Product defects, just-in-time delivery, life-cycle product 
cost, customer satisfaction score, order processing efficiency, percentage sales from 
new customers, service quality, time taken between orders and product delivery, 
and so on
	
2.	Process-related measures: Time to market (i.e., the lapse of time from the initiation of 
product design and development to product delivery to the marketplace), quality 
standards, unit product cost, core competence development, labor hours per prod-
uct, and so on
	
3.	Financial measures: Gross margin, net income-to-sales ratio, current ratio, sales per 
employees, return on equity, sales growth rate, market share percentage, inven-
tory turn ratio, and so on
	
4.	Employee-related measures: Turnover ratio, employee satisfaction score, skill build-
ing and development expenses per employee, and so on
	
5.	Competition-related measures: Market share, cost of innovation, acquisition cost per 
new customer, number of new products commercialized per year, and so on

36
Engineering Management
A large number of these quantitative metrics are available either from the financial state-
ments of the companies in the same industry or from public sources such as (1) banks that 
offer loans to companies in a specific industry, (2) financial institutions that analyze and 
compare companies’ performance on behalf of investors, and (3) service organizations that 
offer the credit ratings of firms seeking debt financing.
These metrics serve well as industrial benchmarks against which to assess the current 
status of a specific company and to define its new strategic direction.
Example 2.2
Quality is usually defined differently by different people in a company. Explain why. 
Which quality definition is the correct one for the company to adopt?
Answer 2.2
Different people in a company may have different interests and perspectives in defining 
quality. Examples are shown here:
	
1.	 Production: Quality is the reject rate and deviation from specifications (view of 
a production engineer).
	
2.	 Value based: Quality is defined in terms of price and costs (view of a marketing 
person).
	
3.	 User based: Quality is the degree to which a product satisfies the customer’s 
needs. Customers do not appreciate less or more quality than they need (view 
of a customer).
	
4.	 Product based: Quality is related to the number of attributes offered by a prod-
uct (view of a product designer).
For the company to succeed in the marketplace, quality is in the eyes of the beholder. 
The user-based definition is preferred.
2.6.6  Technology Forecasting
Technology forecasting is of critical importance to those companies whose products are 
composed of high-technology components. Companies must constantly examine, monitor, 
and apply emerging technologies to enhance business performance. (Porter et al. 2011). 
Engineering managers need to understand the value that any of these emerging technolo-
gies (e.g., big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, mobile communications, and 
social media practices), may have on the products and services offered by their employers 
and plan accordingly.
Another technological example is the speed of computing. It is almost a certainty that 
the computing speed will continue to increase over time. The question for engineering 
managers is as follows: How can business benefit from such advancements? Computing 
speed may be used advantageously in computationally intensive problems, whose solu-
tions of finer granularity provide value to the business. Here are several examples that 
illustrate how a refined granularity can help:
	
1.	Data mining applications related to customer relations management may be of 
direct benefit to business. Assuming that customer data (e.g., prices paid, items 
bought, purchasing habits, and payment methods) are collected and available, a 
detailed analysis could lead to an in-depth understanding of customer behavior, 
not available heretofore, thus allowing companies to structure customized selling 

37
Planning
and marketing programs to achieve better customer satisfaction, enhanced brand 
loyalty, and improved company profitability.
	
2.	Refined modeling of key components in turbomachinery (e.g., compressors, blow-
ers, and pumps) by using computational fluids dynamics programs could raise 
aerodynamic performance and reduce energy consumption.
	
3.	Plant operations groups typically have accumulated a significant amount of data, 
observations, and experience in maintaining and troubleshooting equipment and 
facilities. Such information is dispersed widely, difficult to redeploy, and remains 
useless. A data mining application could help in getting the information orga-
nized and ferreting out valuable knowledge from the wasteful piles of raw data. 
The application of such knowledge could lead to productivity enhancement in 
plant operations.
	
4.	Sophisticated computer models could be devised to impact-test automobiles, 
instead of crash-testing expensive vehicles at speeds of up to only 40 miles/hour, 
in order to design better, safer, faster, and cheaper cars.
It is quite certain that engineering managers will be able to envisage many other compu-
tationally intensive problems that can be processed to reap business benefits.
2.6.7  Product Life-Cycle Analysis
Every product has a life cycle that moves typically through the stages of initiation, growth, 
market saturation, and decline (Kloepffer and Grahl 2014). Engineering managers need to 
examine the life cycles of all products marketed by their enterprises. Doing so will guide 
them in introducing new products or product enhancements in a timely manner in order 
to sustain company profitability.
Tools for operational planning include the following: Microsoft Project 2013, Enterprise 
Project Management Timeline, critical path method (CPM), program evaluation review 
technique (PERT), and others listed in Section 12.2.2.
2.7  Planning Activities
The activities of planning involve strategic and operational planning. Strategic planning 
requires forecasting, action planning, and issuing policies. Operational planning necessi-
tates action planning, issuing policies, and establishing procedures. Some planning activi-
ties are proactive, others are reactive in nature.
2.7.1  Forecasting
The objective of forecasting is to estimate and predict future conditions and events. 
All forecasting activities center on assessing future conditions in technology, products, 
marketplace, and other factors affecting the business success of the company (Ray 2015; 
Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013). The marketplace revolves around customers, com-
petition, economy, global supply chains, human resources, capital, and facilities.

38
Engineering Management
Forecasting helps to define potential obstacles and opportunities. It sets boundaries 
for possibilities to help focus on specific future conditions, define worthwhile objectives, 
promote intergroup coordination, provide the basis for resources allocation (manpower, 
budget, facilities, and business relations), and induce innovation through forecasted needs 
(Zhu and Fung 2010).
Forecasting may be implemented by using the following steps:
	
1.	Identify: Critical factors that have the most profound effects on the company’s 
profitability.
	
2.	Determine: The forecasting horizon as short term (1  year), intermediate term 
(2–5 years), or long term (5–10 years).
	
3.	Select: Forecasting methods such as
	
a.	 Mechanical projection. The future is projected assuming essentially the same 
characteristics as in the past.
	
b.	 Analytical projection. The future is estimated based on an extrapolation of 
the past (trend analysis). Statistical tools such as linear or nonlinear regres-
sion, moving averages, exponential smoothing, time series, and others may be 
applied.
	
4.	Forecast: Future eventualities and their likelihood of occurrence.
	
5.	Prepare: The forecast, as well as the pertinent database.
	
6.	Adjust: Forecasts regularly to incorporate pertinent changes related to assump-
tions and desirable results.
	
7.	Ensure: Understanding and acceptance by all parties affected by the forecast.
Several observations are worth noting. Major economic events such as prices, wages, 
raw materials, and so on tend to change gradually. The farther an event is projected into 
the future, the greater the probability of significant deviations between the forecast and 
reality. Certain future events tend to result from current and past occurrences, as long as 
there are no disruptive changes in technology or society, such as wars, natural disasters, 
or major incidents. The future may be planned with detailed, factual knowledge of the 
present and the past under those conditions. It is important to screen ideas by using proper 
criteria that are consistent with the company’s objectives, technical capabilities, financial 
viability, and marketplace compatibility. Useful inputs may be offered by customers, sales-
people, production employees, service clerks, and others who possess intimate knowledge 
of specific subjects.
Engineering managers are likely to get involved primarily in technology forecasting. As 
discussed before, forecasting the impact of new technologies on future businesses is par-
ticularly difficult. For example, in the past, few companies understood the significance of 
the Internet to company operations and the marketplace. Questions like those enumerated 
next did not have clear answers:
	
1.	What will be the impact of broadband technology (cables, optical networks) to 
communications?
	
2.	How will nanotechnology affect engineering activities such as product design 
and equipment operation in the future?
	
3.	Will the next wave of new products be smart appliances and intelligent devices?

39
Planning
	
4.	What happens if processors get more powerful and intelligent devices get smaller 
and more mobile?
	
5.	What about the molecular switching devices that Hewlett-Packard is said to be 
working on that could lead to computational devices about one million times 
smaller than those we have today?
	
6.	What will be the impact of “pervasive computing,” “big data analytics,” “cloud 
computing,” “mobile computing,” and “open innovations” on consumer markets?
	
7.	How quickly will personal computers (PCs) lose their market value, once alterna-
tive devices that allow customers to access the Internet, get and send messages, 
purchase goods and services, activate entertainment programs online, and control 
home appliances remotely become widely available?
	
8.	How will the new technologies related to intrinsic and extrinsic smart materi-
als, which exhibit sensing and other capabilities, impact on the industrial product 
design in the future?
To forecast the impact of new technologies, engineering managers must be properly 
prepared. Some business researchers portend that people with broad perspectives and 
variable professional experience and exposure may have a better chance of accurately fore-
casting the impact of emerging technologies, market trends, and other future conditions 
that require “foresight.” Teams whose members have diversified backgrounds in engineer-
ing, product design, manufacturing, marketing, service, and sales are said to be better 
equipped in handling technology forecasting that could benefit from the divergent experi-
ence and insights of composite teams.
Engineering managers whose backgrounds are broad-based are likely to be more suc-
cessful in technology forecasting if they are supported by teams that also have diverse 
experience.
Example 2.3
The U.S. economy is shaped by a number of factors. The ongoing conflicts in the Middle 
East and associated global anxiety rankle the business environment and influence 
employment and consumer spending. Correctly reading trends in the economy can 
make or break a business. Where can an engineering manager find data that could help 
predict the direction of the economy?
Answer 2.3
There are leading and trailing indicators for the economy. The 2008–2009 U.S. recession 
differed from others in its cause, severity, and scope. According to a recent assessment 
published in the literature, many of the commonly used indicators did not forecast well. 
These indicators include stock prices, unemployment claims, housing starts, orders for 
new capital equipment, and consumer sentiment.
Gene Sperling, who served as director of President Clinton’s Council of Economic 
Advisors, offers some advice for business leaders to get ahead of the competition by 
becoming their own economists (Sperling 2003). Specifically, he suggests that the follow-
ing set of indicators be used: (1) CEO opinions, (2) temporary jobs, (3) consumer spending, 
(4) bank loans, (5) semiconductors, (6) commercial structures, and (7) housing markets.
2.7.2  Action Planning
Another important activity related to planning is action planning, which is the process 
of establishing specific objectives, action steps, and a schedule and budget related to a 

40
Engineering Management
predetermined program, task, or project (Kerzner 2013). Action planning helps to focus 
on critical projects that need attention and action. The identification of critical projects 
enables the company management to pay attention primarily to planning for deviations 
that may arise—the principle of management by exception. Furthermore, action planning 
states specific results to be accomplished. Defining results to be accomplished requires 
the planner to make judicial selection and exercise judgment. In addition, action plan-
ning provides standards as milestones that facilitate control and clarify accountability for 
results. It also permits an effective delegation of responsibilities (who is responsible for 
what results), encourages teamwork, and ensures an evaluation of the overall performance 
of the program, task, or project on a continuous basis.
Action planning mandates engineering managers to take the following specific steps:
	
1.	Analyze critical needs: Critical needs are those associated with staff development, 
staff maintenance, and staff deficiency, as well as those related to special assign-
ments. Managers define these needs by reviewing standards related to position 
charters, duties, management expectations, and company goals. Short-term needs 
must be in balance with long-term needs.
	
2.	Define specific objectives: Specific objectives need to be defined to satisfy the 
critical needs. The results statement (who will attain what desirable results by 
when) must be specific. Establishing objectives predetermines the results to be 
accomplished.
	
3.	Define standards: Standards measure the attainment of the objectives. The stan-
dards should preferably be quantitative in terms of performance ratios, percent-
ages, cost figures, resource parameters, and other factors in order to be measurable 
(Kaplan and Norton 1996).
	
4.	Define key action steps: The definition of key action steps establishes the sequence 
and priority of steps required to attain objectives. Specifically, major steps are 
lined up in the order in which they are to be performed; this list includes the eval-
uation of risks for the steps planned, the definition of contingency steps to ensure 
the expected results, and the specification of who is responsible for each step and 
who is accountable for achieving the target value associated with each step.
	
	
Action steps must be reasonably implementable. After the expected results are 
defined, engineering managers should plan these steps with the active participa-
tion of the workers involved to benefit from their creativity and expertise in the 
subject matter.
	
5.	Create a schedule: Scheduling establishes both a time sequence for action steps and 
the interrelationship among the steps, as some might be prerequisites for others. 
It is advisable to estimate the optimistic (earliest), the pessimistic (latest), and the 
most likely (most probable) dates of possible completion of each step. Doing so will 
permit a more realistic modeling of the project schedule.
	
	
Sufficient scheduling flexibility should be included to account for contin-
gency—more for projects related to new development and less for routine design 
and analysis work. Contingency refers to the slag and cost buffers introduced to 
account for undefinable, yet generally anticipated, deviations from the plan.
	
	
The most important outcome of the scheduling effort is the definition of the 
project or program completion date. The engineering manager, as the leader, is 
accountable for completing the project or program on time.

41
Planning
	
6.	Develop a budget: Budgeting allocates resources necessary to accomplish project 
objectives. The planner determines the basic units (man-hours, man-weeks) to 
accomplish each task, estimates the total resources needed for the project, and 
adds a contingency to the total amount for potential deviation (e.g., 7%–10% of the 
total budget, dependent on the customary percentages used in each industry) to 
arrive at a total budget.
The budget estimate is typically the basis for seeking management approval for the proj-
ect or program. The project leader is accountable for completing the project or program 
within the approved budget.
For complex projects that involve many participants (e.g., peer departments, external 
suppliers, and outsourcing service organizations), project management tools such as PERT 
or CPM may be applied. These tools produce time lines, graphically diagram the tasks 
network to facilitate monitoring and control, and determine the tasks linked along the 
critical path. Consequently, the shortest time in which the project can be completed can be 
determined. Managers are then reminded to monitor these critical path tasks carefully in 
order to avoid project delays.
A well-developed project plan serves the purpose of promoting communication, moni-
toring progress, evaluating performance, and managing knowledge.
2.7.3  Issuing Policies
For companies to operate smoothly and consistently, corporate rules and regulations are 
used to prescribe acceptable practices. Company policies address important issues such as 
employee hiring and termination, equal employment opportunity (EEO) policies, annual 
performance appraisals, savings plans, benefits, medical insurance, pension plans, sick 
leave, safety, contact with representatives of competitors, and other issues. At the depart-
mental level, specific rules may be defined to regulate tasks that are repetitive in nature, 
such as filing reports after each completed business trip, submitting monthly or quarterly 
progress reports to summarize achievements and preserve new lessons learned, and out-
lining future work (i.e., attending scheduled staff meetings, publishing engineering or 
scientific articles, participating in professional and technical conferences), and other tasks.
Managers may write policies to offer uniform answers to questions of common concern. 
In general, policies are continuing directives promulgated to address repetitive issues, 
tasks, and problems in an organization. Policies are useful for predeciding answers to 
basic repetitive questions, capturing the distilled experience of the organization, saving 
management time, and facilitating delegation. Issuing policies is a part of the manager’s 
planning responsibilities.
To be effective, a policy must have certain common characteristics, such as: (1) applies 
uniformly to the organization (or specific engineering unit) at large; (2) remains relatively 
permanent, unless and until repealed; (3) fosters the objectives of the company; (4) frees 
managers and employees to focus on important matters; (5) encourages effective teamwork 
by reducing disagreements, conflicts, and differences in interpretation; and (6) is issued by 
top management or authorized managers with perspective, balance, and objectivity.
2.7.4  Establishing Procedures
Companies perform many important tasks such as product design, plant operation, proj-
ect management, equipment installation, facility maintenance, manufacturing, system 

42
Engineering Management
engineering, parts procurement, product delivery, customer service, and others. The spe-
cific methods by which these tasks are performed represent the valuable corporate know-
how employees have learned to perfect. Over time, companies want to preserve these 
“tried-and-true” procedures in manuals.
Developing procedures is of critical importance to a company, not only because doing 
so will preserve the best way to perform repetitive work (to achieve high productivity), 
but also because doing so will accomplish the following: (1) provide the basis for method 
improvements; (2) ensure standardized action (such as quality control, resource saving, 
and work reproducibility); (3) simplify training; and (4) retain corporate memory, such 
as know-how, insights, knowledge, heuristics, proven safety practices, problem-solving 
techniques, and so on.
Establishing and preserving procedures is part of the planning responsibility of manag-
ers. If generated in suitable formats, such procedures could be widely applied within the 
company and among its business partners to garner competitive advantages in the mar-
ketplace. Techniques for developing procedures include
	
1.	Concentrating on procedures for critical work that is in high demand, repetitive, 
and time-consuming.
	
2.	Charting graphically the work required—inputs, workflow, outputs, skills, and 
resources.
	
3.	Reviewing work characteristics carefully in order to decipher (a) why (is the work 
really necessary?), (b) what (results are to be obtained?), (c) when (is the best time 
to do it?), (d) where (is the best place—group, station, facility, or equipment—to do 
it?), (e) who (is the person with the relevant training to do it?), and (f) how (signifi-
cant might be the impact of its outcome?).
	
4.	Proposing procedures in the context of existing objectives, policies, and programs 
by keeping the procedures to a minimum; this will avoid restricting employee 
imagination and incentive, as well as ensure consistent applications to minimize 
deviations.
	
5.	Defining improvements to procedures and updating them regularly.
	
6.	Formulating the procedures in writing.
	
7.	Communicating with all affected parties to ensure understanding and acceptance.
2.8  Some Specific Advice on Planning
Good up-front planning is essential for any company to achieve its desired corporate objec-
tives. Managers need to pay sufficient attention to planning activities in order to make 
sure that certain pivotal factors are sufficiently addressed in the strategic or operational 
plans they formulate.
2.8.1  Assumptions
Plans are typically built on both hard data and assumptions. Assumptions are usually 
based on extrapolations of past experience and intuitive projections into the future. It is 
important for managers to constantly seek and interpret additional resources and insights 

43
Planning
to verify their assumptions. This is to ascertain that the plans they introduce are built on 
an increasingly solid foundation.
2.8.2  Resistance to Change
Any plan is worthless unless its objectives are achieved through successful implementation. 
Implementation requires dedicated people who are supportive of and ardent about the sub-
ject matter involved. Managers need to take into account the suitability of people, including 
their background, personality, training, mental flexibility, interpersonal skills, collaborative 
attitudes, adaptability, and emotional attachments to specific ways things are done.
Most plans contain activities related to a change of the current status. Unfortunately, 
most people resist change, particularly sudden changes. Change may induce business 
instability, technology obsolescence, organizational restructuring, and other unwanted 
disruptions. People may be more amenable to gradual changes if such changes occur at a 
rate that they can understand and accept.
Managing change is a challenging task for managers. Managers need to recognize early 
that change is coming. They may want to delineate the change in detail and analyze the 
implications of the change as a way of preparing the staff and allowing them to become 
gradually accustomed to such a change.
By paying close attention to how changes are being communicated to the staff, managers 
may be able to minimize the resistance to change and gain support for the implementa-
tion of new plans. It is helpful for the managers to isolate and identify areas of threats 
and opportunity. If needed, they should apply contingency plans for handling threats, but 
focus on opportunities that will advance the company business.
2.8.3  Benefit versus Cost
When planning, managers need to be guided by the expected value that a given project 
or program may produce. Low-value projects justify the commitment of low-level efforts, 
whereas high-value projects justify the allocation of high-level efforts. Efforts applied 
should be commensurate with the value added by the expected results. Otherwise, cor-
porate resources may be wasted. The saying “things worth doing are worth doing well” is 
valid only to the extent justifiable by the expected value.
2.8.4  Small but Sure Steps
To be effective in planning, managers should (1) identify clearly the desired end results 
and the series of small steps required to reach them; (2) allow a timely control and mid-
course correction, if needed; and (3) aim at attaining a series of small progressions (or 
continuous improvements) that are more acceptable in many old-style companies than one 
large achievement (or a step change) after a long period of time. On the other hand, some 
start-up companies with an entrepreneurial spirit may be able to exercise patience, take 
risks, and go for “blow-the-roof-off” breakthrough technologies and step-change products 
or services. Managers need to adjust accordingly.
2.8.5  Contingency Planning
Contingency planning represents the definition of predetermined back-up steps to take, 
if and when a specific action step, as originally planned, fails to deliver its anticipated 
outcome.

44
Engineering Management
As discussed before, strategic planning for the future entails considerable risks and 
uncertainties. Some of the changes in future conditions are unpredictable. Yet, strategic 
planning for the future must be done today. Besides striving for acquiring hard data and 
soft information to continuously validate the assumptions introduced in the planning, 
managers should take an additional risk-modulating step: study exhaustively the sensitiv-
ity of various assumptions to the company business and incorporate contingency steps, 
including fallback positions, in order to minimize the adverse impact of questionable 
assumptions (Nokes 2014).
2.8.6  Commitment
Managers need to secure company commitment before any plan can be implemented 
successfully. Company management must declare their intentions and their readiness to 
allocate resources needed to achieve the planned objectives. Without a firm company com-
mitment, nothing of value will emerge from the planning efforts.
Example 2.4
Joe Engineer took a graduate school course at SUNY-Buffalo where he learned the 
importance of planning. Joe knows that luck plays a big role in one’s life. But he is con-
vinced that proper planning will help him to have an orderly progression in his career. 
He thinks that it would be cool to become a CEO of a publicly owned, multinational 
company at the age of 60 and retire at 65 with a net worth of $5 million. He wants some 
guidance with career planning. How can you help him?
Answer 2.4
It is advisable for Joe Engineer to follow a number of planning steps, enumerated 
here:
	
1.	 Set objectives and specify subgoals: Before starting the planning process, we need 
to introduce an important assumption. In order for Joe Engineer to be entrusted 
with a given management position in a publicly held major company, he needs 
to have acquired and successfully demonstrated certain business management 
capabilities beforehand. Obviously, this assumption may not be valid for small 
and medium-sized companies that are privately held.
	
	
The CEO of a major company must be familiar with many functional areas, 
such as (1) strategic management, (2) business management, (3) operational 
management, (4) project or program management, (5) engineering manage-
ment, (6) production and manufacturing, (7) marketing management, (8) finan-
cial control, and (9) globalization. The future CEO must be able to demonstrate 
sufficiency in various skills, such as
	
a.	 Public speaking and writing
	
b.	 Business analysis and planning
	
c.	 Public relations
	
d.	 Problem solving and conflict resolution
	
e.	 Interpersonal skills
	
f.	 Negotiations
	
g.	 Business relations development
	
h.	 Other skills
	
	
Therefore, for Joe Engineer to qualify for the CEO job, he must have gar-
nered useful management experience, possibly as a company president a few 
years back. Future capabilities are, by and large, based on past experience. 

45
Planning
Applying such a logic in a backward-chaining manner, Joe Engineer could 
readily establish a set of milestones in his plans:
	
a.	 Corporate president at 55
	
b.	 Division president at 50
	
c.	 Vice president at 45
	
d.	 Director at 40
	
e.	 Manager at 35
	
f.	 Supervisor at 30
	
g.	 Group leader at 25
	
2.	 Develop action plans: A forward chaining plan, which moves from the present to 
the future, should be considered by Joe Engineer. As examples, the following 
plan illustrates the qualifications that should be built up when advancing from 
one stage to another:
	
a.	 Preparation (by a certain date)
	
i.	 Take steps to collect pertinent career development references and 
acquire perspectives.
	
ii.	 Talk with experienced engineers to obtain insights related to the costs 
and benefits of the targeted objectives. The advantages and disadvan-
tages of being a manager are well known: power, prestige, and money 
versus travel, 50–60 hour workweeks, job pressure, office politics, bal-
ance between work and home, and related factors.
	
iii.	 Understand one’s own career objectives and the requirements to suc-
ceed. What are the “success factors” involved?
	
iv.	 Be aware of one’s own strengths and weaknesses, personality type, 
value system, personal requirements for happiness.
	
v.	 Confirm desirable objectives of moving into the managerial career 
path.
	
b.	 Group leader
	
i.	 Get a master of engineering degree to demonstrate technical compe-
tence (by a certain date).
	
ii.	 Become well versed in engineering management concepts and prac-
tices (e.g., take courses or training).
	
iii.	 Practice good interpersonal skills by doing volunteer work.
	
iv.	 Network inside and outside the company (join technical societies, 
attend technical conferences, publish technical papers, etc.) and know 
some professional people well.
	
c.	 Supervisor
	
i.	 Seek training on supervision and practice teamwork with dedication.
	
ii.	 Take advanced technical courses, if needed, to help become estab-
lished as a technical leader.
	
iii.	 Broaden into marketing, production, and sales through business 
interactions.
	
iv.	 Function as a gatekeeper for technology.
	
v.	 Demonstrate innovative capabilities.
	
vi.	 Continue networking and become known to many others inside and 
outside the company.
	
vii.	 Attain recognizable technical achievements.
	
viii.	 Demonstrate managerial potential.
	
ix.	 Become known as a good problem solver.
	
d.	 Manager
	
i.	 Demonstrate prowess in strategic planning, operation, and all other 
engineering management skills.
	
ii.	 Demonstrate capabilities in interacting with sales, marketing, produc-
tion, service, and customers.

46
Engineering Management
	
iii.	 Show success in initiating and implementing new technology projects 
that affect the business success of the company.
	
iv.	 Achieve organization-wide recognition.
	
v.	 Form networks with decision-makers at various levels.
	
e.	 Director
	
i.	 Become widely known in one’s own industry.
	
ii.	 Participate actively in industrial trade and technical conferences.
	
iii.	 Demonstrate leadership in strategic planning affecting the company.
	
iv.	 Be recognized for operational efficiency.
	
v.	 Make major contributions to direct the company’s businesses.
	
vi.	 Master the technology–marketing interface.
	
vii.	 Lead the company in applying emerging technology to constantly 
strengthen competitiveness.
	
viii.	 Represent the company well to the press.
	
ix.	 Have real friends in high places.
	
f.	 Vice president
	
	
Joe Engineer is encouraged to fill in the remainder of this plan as an exercise.
	
3.	 Budget and commitment
	
a.	 Invest the proper amount of resources (time, money, and effort) to ready 
oneself for the next stages.
	
b.	 Make a firm commitment to carry out the action steps specified in the plan.
	
4.	 Review and update: Review the plan and make adjustments regularly to 
exercise proper control of this career path. Knowing what it takes to move to 
the next stage, and preparing oneself in time for that big opportunity ahead, 
represent a good mantra for Joe Engineer to follow. Benjamin Disraeli said, 
“One secret of success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity 
when it comes.”
Example 2.5
Describe the top-five key lessons/insights you have learned/gained from this chapter, 
including justifications.
Answer 2.5
The most important capability for future leaders to nurture and cultivate is strate-
gic planning, which requires the creation of a vision for defining future directions. 
Forecasting technologies, business conditions, marketplace developments, and custom-
ers’ needs is critical but difficult to determine, as choices may have to be made based 
on intuition, judgment, and hunches, rather than hard data. Future leaders need to nur-
ture strategic planning skills through keen observations, deep reflections, and trial and 
error. Operational planning is more or less straightforward; it is essential for imple-
mentation, which includes 85% of efforts required in order to achieve success in any 
endeavor. Planning activities are essential to both corporate and personal life. Policies 
and procedures are mostly administrative in nature; however, they need to be taken 
care of even though they are not particularly exciting or rewarding.
2.9  Conclusion
Both strategic and operational planning are important, because the success of a company 
depends on creating new paths to the future as well as on implementing short-term opera-
tional plans to secure profitability at the present time.

47
Planning
Engineering managers are expected to involve themselves in both strategic planning 
and operational planning. Both types of planning require forecasting and action plan-
ning. To regulate work, managers may also participate in issuing policies and establishing 
procedures. Among these planning activities, forecasting and strategic planning are dif-
ficult, as they involve making estimations of the future. The remaining planning activi-
ties related to policies and procedures are administrative or operational in nature. These 
activities are rather straightforward and should appear to be relatively easy to understand 
and implement. Doing extremely well in these administrative tasks will not necessarily 
make a manager outstanding, but not doing well in them will project a negative image of 
the engineering manager.
To demonstrate managerial leadership, engineering managers need also to be proficient 
in technology forecasting. Technology forecasting involves the critical evaluation and 
adaptation of emerging technologies so that the company’s products and services offered 
to the marketplace become better, cheaper, and faster to deliver. A primary opportunity 
for engineering managers to add value is to participate actively in creating technology 
projects affecting the company’s future in major ways.
QUESTIONS
 
1.	On the eve of leaving her alma mater, Stacy Engineer remembers the encouraging 
words of the commencement speaker: “Graduation is the happy beginning of an 
exciting life ahead.” She is, of course, excited about her new master of engineering 
degree that she received with honor. But she is also a bit concerned about what to 
do now to make her new life exciting and filled with happiness. Apparently, what 
she needs is a road map into the future. How can you help her?
	
2.	The company has always been focused on the high-quality and high-price end of 
the market. Now, market intelligence indicates that some competitors are plan-
ning to enter the low-price and low-quality end of the market. What should the 
company do?
	
3.	Mission and value statements are indicative of the direction in which a company 
is headed. What are typically included in the statements of mission and values of 
well-known companies in the United States? Please comment.
	
4.	What are included in the typical operational guidelines some industrial compa-
nies have developed? Please comment.
	
5.	There are always risks (risks of failure) associated with the experimentation of a 
new manufacturing process or with entry into a new global market. How should 
one decide to proceed or not to proceed with a risky venture? What is the proper 
level of risk for a company to take?
	
6.	The marketing director needs to submit a strategic plan for entering a new mar-
ket. She knows she needs long periods of uninterrupted time. She considers two 
options: (1) staying at home to do the plan or (2) delegating some parts of the plan 
to her subordinates. What are the factors the director needs to consider when she 
chooses the best way to come up with this plan?
	
7.	XYZ Company has been a one-product company focused on developing and 
marketing a package of innovative enterprise resource planning (ERP) software 
specialized for law firms and operated in computers running on a proprietary 
operating system software developed by the company. Customers must purchase 
both the hardware and software as a bundled package from XYZ Company. 

48
Engineering Management
The company also provides around-the-clock services to ensure that the combined 
hardware and software system performs reliably, as lawyers are known to be typi-
cally disinterested in troubleshooting computer systems. This product-bundling 
strategy works out well for the company, and the sales revenue of XYZ increases 
dramatically during its first three years in business.
	
	
However, market intelligence shows that new ERP software products are now 
being introduced by competitors. These new ERP software products are quite 
capable of performing all of the data processing functions typically required by 
law firms. Furthermore, these new ERP software products can run on any com-
puter using its existing operating system, thus eliminating the need for customers 
to purchase dedicated computers.
	
	
The president of XYZ Company recognizes the potential threat imposed by 
these new ERP software products. He wants to know the best counterstrategy he 
should plan and implement. Design and explain this counterstrategy.
	
8.	Sandy Smith is about to graduate from the University at Buffalo with a master’s 
degree in engineering and a GPA of about 3.8. She wants to find a good job that 
allows her to best utilize her strengths and capabilities. Her short-term goal is 
to become an operations manager in a manufacturing enterprise in 10 years. 
Modeled after Example 2.4, how should she plan to achieve this specific goal?

Organizing
3.1  Introduction
Organizing is another important function of engineering management. Organizing means 
arranging and relating work so that it can be done efficiently by the appropriate people 
(Glushko 2013; Lewis 2014). Corporate efficiency is usually achieved by a proper partition 
and distribution of work, as well as by a suitable coordination between the interrelated 
groups of people participating in the work that is subject to time constraints, resource 
limitations, and business priority.
Managers are empowered to design the organizational structure—the team, group, 
department, and so on—and to define the working relationships conducive for attaining 
the company’s objectives. Doing so will
•	 Ensure that important work gets done in priority order
•	 Provide continuity
•	 Form the basis for wage and salary administration
•	 Aid delegation
•	 Facilitate communication
•	 Promote growth and diversification
•	 Encourage teamwork by minimizing personality conflicts and other problems
•	 Stimulate creativity
It is generally true that dedicated people can make any organization work. However, 
dedicated people in well-organized units can get outstanding work done. Bernard Russell 
said, “Too little liberty brings stagnation and too much brings chaos.”
This chapter compares several basic forms of organizational structures commonly 
employed in industry. Special emphasis is placed on teams composed of cross-functional 
members. Illustrative examples are included for specific organizational structures, which 
are used to enhance innovation, resolve conflicts at the interface between design and 
manufacturing, promote collaboration at the interface between research and development 
(R&D) and marketing, and foster employee motivation. The critical managerial tasks of 
assigning responsibilities while maintaining control and establishing work relationships 
are also discussed.

Engineering Management
3.2  Definitions
Before reviewing the managerial function of organizing, it is useful to introduce a few 
definitions.
	
1.	Span of control: The span of control refers to the number of people supervised by 
a manager or supervisor. It may be small (a few people) or large (20 or 30 people). 
The choice of a small or large span of control depends on workforce diversity, task 
volume, and complexity of work, as well as on the geographic dispersion of work-
ers. Large span leads to lower costs and greater organizational efficiency, but it 
also leads to a lower intensity of supervision. The current trend is moving toward 
larger span of control, increasing from 7 to 20 or more, due to
	
a.	 Reduction of middle management levels
	
b.	 Enhanced communication tools
	
c.	 Empowered knowledge workers, allowing decision-making at lower levels by 
people with more applicable knowledge
	
d.	 Improved morale, productivity, and profitability, made possible by less detailed 
supervision, particularly over professional workers
	
2.	Organization types: The line organization (e.g., a profit center) performs activities 
directly related to the company’s main goals. Examples include business manage-
ment, product management, sales and marketing, product design, and engineer-
ing, production, and customer services.
	
	
On the other hand, the staff organization (e.g., a cost center) provides advice and 
comments in support of the line organization’s work. Examples include research 
and development, financial and accounting, information services, procurement, 
legal affairs, public relations, and facility engineering.
	
3.	Overlap and duplication of responsibility: This refers to a situation where two or more 
people do the same work and make the same decisions. Such undesirable situa-
tions are to be avoided in any organization, as they represent sources of conflicts 
and wastes.
	
4.	Specialization: Specialization refers to the increased degree of skill concentration 
in narrow technical domains. Specialization of work leads to improved efficiency. 
However, overspecialization may cause monotony, fatigue, disinterest, and inef-
ficiency on the part of the worker.
	
5.	Work arrangement: Work needs to be arranged in a rational and logical manner. 
The logical arrangement of work promotes task accomplishments and enhances 
personal satisfaction for more workers over a longer period of time.
	
6.	Additional selected management terms: Authority refers to the legal or rightful power 
of a person, by assignment or by being associated with a position, to command, 
act, or make decisions—this is the binding force of an organization. Responsibility 
is the duty to perform work assumed by a position holder in an efficient and 
professional manner. Accountability represents an upward-directed obligation to 
secure the desired results of the assigned work.
Other terminologies related to organizing may be found in Fineman et al. (2005).

Organizing
3.3  Activities of Organizing
As a function of engineering management, organizing consists of several specific activities 
described next:
	
1.	Organizing one’s own workplace for productivity: The organization of one’s own 
office, file systems, and daily routine, so that work can be done efficiently (Online 
Business Buddy 2013).
	
2.	Developing organizational structure: The identification and assortment of work so 
that it can be done efficiently by qualified people in teams, task forces, committees, 
departments, and other suitable arrangements (Galbraith 2014, Burton et al. 2011).
	
3.	Delegating: The entrustment of responsibility and authority to others and the cre-
ation of accountability for results. Managers must learn to delegate effectively in 
order to achieve results by working through people; to distribute the workload 
while maintaining control to make the best use of available talent in the organiza-
tion (Harvard Business Review 2014).
	
4.	Establishing working relationships: The creation of conditions necessary for the 
mutually cooperative efforts of people. Managers must make commitments, set 
priorities, and provide needed resources (money, time, physical facilities, skills, 
and know-how) to foster teamwork and collaboration among people (Goold 2014; 
Harvard Business Review 2013).
All of these organizing activities exist for the purpose of achieving improved efficiency 
in performing work.
3.4  Organizing One’s Own Workplace for Productivity
How well is the office of a typical engineering manager organized? A simple test is to ask 
how much time it would take for the engineering manager to find a phone number, a piece 
of paper, or a file when his or her superior calls. Surveys indicate that an average executive 
spends about five weeks per year looking for lost items (Zeigler 2010).
Engineering managers need to be organized with respect to time, paper, and space. 
A basic guideline recommended by efficiency experts is as follows: “The less you have, 
the less you have to sort through.” A few rules of thumb that are recommended for the 
engineering managers to become more efficient are as follows:
	
1.	Use an online calendar that indicates time slots blocked out for important tasks. 
Such a calendar allows others—one’s own secretary and peer managers—to 
schedule meetings conveniently. One should also prepare agendas before holding 
or attending meetings.
	
2.	Maintain a “to-do” list. Set priority to tasks and separate urgent tasks from others 
by assigning most urgent tasks to list A, moderately urgent tasks to list B, and least 
urgent tasks to list C. Consult the lists regularly. If one is computer literate, then 
use electronic systems.

54
Engineering Management
	
3.	File papers based on “access,” or use a logical keyword system under which to find 
the document later. The file system may be based on categories such as projects, 
persons, or deadlines. Keep a master copy of the file index nearby and update it 
often. This master index helps locate a file and safeguards against creating dupli-
cate files. A document should be kept if
 
a.	 The information it contains cannot be easily found elsewhere. (How difficult 
would it be to obtain or reproduce it again?)
	
b.	 The information it contains helps the engineering manager to reach a goal. 
(Does this piece of paper require action?)
	
c.	 It has been consolidated as much as possible.
	
d.	 It is up to date. (Is it recent enough to be useful?)
	
e.	 It is really necessary to keep this document. (What is the worst thing that could 
happen if this document is unavailable?)
	
	
Most professional workers are said to use only about 20% of the paperwork 
they keep. The challenge is, of course, to decide which 80% can be thrown away. 
Question every piece of paper that crosses the desk. Use the wastebaskets fre-
quently. Reserve a time slot during each day (e.g., after work, but before departing 
for home) to sort, file, and toss unneeded files. Make use of travel time (at the air-
port, on the plane, and in the hotel) to organize one’s own files.
	
4.	Implement a system for keeping track of names and phone numbers (e.g., Rolodex 
for business cards, address book, Palm Pilots, and smartphones).
	
5.	Cultivate the use of the phone. Prepare notes before placing calls and make the 
calls brief (e.g., by standing up).
With practice, every engineering manager can get his or her workspace and daily rou-
tine organized for productivity.
Example 3.1
David Pope, engineering director, started out the day uptight. His young child had 
the flu the night before, and he had been up all night to help. Upon arrival at his office, 
David had to make urgent phone calls to approve a two-week overtime work plan due 
to a plant fire the night before and to plan for a product committee meeting the next day 
to counter environmental concerns about a wastewater treatment plant.
Then he spent 30  minutes reviewing the qualifications of new candidates and 
decided on one. He asked for salary information and wanted to examine the offer 
before it was sent. He asked for further justification for the budget requested by indus-
trial engineering for a minicomputer. Without reading it, he approved the research 
proposal from material engineering. He rejected an invitation to speak at a regional 
meeting of the American Society of Plant Engineering by giving an untrue reason.
David made a note for a United Way board meeting coming up soon. At 10:00 a.m., he 
met with two consultants for 1 hour and 45 minutes on a formal wage and salary plan 
and then directed his administrative assistant to work out the details. He promised to 
inform all department heads and asked for cooperation.
As he walked back to his office after lunch, David noticed several engineers were still 
playing bridge after 1:30 p.m., and he planned to remind their department heads of this 
truancy from work.

55
Organizing
As soon as he walked into his office after lunch, George Wallace, the general sales 
manager, called to complain about inadequate responses from engineering to field 
sales requests. David promised to look into it after receiving specific details. In 
return, he asked for Wallace’s support at the product committee meeting the next 
day.
David gave a retirement plaque to Glen Sanford in his own office in the presence of 
the personnel director at 1:45 p.m. Furthermore, he approved the request of two engi-
neers for a week of overtime to design a new, final quality control station.
At 2:00 p.m., he was asked to attend a three-hour budget meeting at 3:00 p.m. called by 
the president. In the meeting, guidelines and a timetable for next year’s budget requests 
were discussed. For engineering, he was told there would be an increase of only 10%. 
He then arranged for a meeting with the president and the controller at 2:00 p.m. the 
next day to request more money.
As he was about to leave for the day around 6:30 p.m., his wife called to say that his 
child is doing all right, but he has to go to the party of the executive vice president 
alone.
What do you see are David Pope’s problems? How do you suggest improving his day?
Answer 3.1 (Adopted and modified from Shannon 2009.)
David Pope had four major problems: (1) poor time management, resulting in the day 
being spent responding mostly to others; (2) lack of delegation; (3) inadequate utiliza-
tion of administrative assistant; and (4) deficient guidelines for handling minor projects. 
David Pope could improve his day as follows
	
1.	 Review the day’s schedule in the morning and call in the administrative assis-
tant to
	
a.	 Get background information on wage and salary plan for the 10:00 a.m. 
meeting with the two consultants. Prevent this initial meeting from drag-
ging out to 1 hour and 45 minutes.
	
b.	 Request the personnel director to invite peers of Glen Sanford to attend the 
plaque-awarding ceremony in his own office.
	
c.	 Collect information on the budget request for the minicomputer from 
industrial engineering.
	
2.	 Return all phone calls.
	
a.	 Authorize the two-week overtime work plan due to plant fires.
	
b.	 Send Jamieson (who wrote the report) to the product committee meeting 
to defend the wastewater treatment plant.
	
c.	 Approve Oscar Ford to use two engineers for one week to design a new, 
final quality control station. Ask the administrative assistant to draft new 
guidelines for manpower allocation in minor projects.
	
3.	 Upon receiving notice for the 3:00 p.m. meeting called by the president, get 
the administrative assistant to start preparing the engineering positions on 
budget. Review these positions at 2:00 p.m. Call an urgent meeting for 2:15 p.m. 
with department heads to finalize the engineering position.
	
4.	 Present a plaque to Glen Sanford before many of his peers, express apprecia-
tion for his services, and wish him well.
	
5.	 Become well prepared to attend the 3:00 p.m. meeting. If more discussions are 
needed, request a follow-up meeting with the president. If additional budget 
preparations are required the next morning, leave a note to the administrative 
assistant.
	
6.	 Go to the party alone, and be happy.

3.5  Developing Organizational Structure
The purpose of developing organizational structure is to help ensure that important 
work related to the key objectives of the unit or department is performed. By develop-
ing the right organizational structure for pursuing specific work, managers hope to 
eliminate or minimize the overlap and the duplication of responsibilities. Also, by 
logically grouping work according to positions in the organizational structure, manag-
ers will be in a better position to utilize available talents, encourage mutual support 
among workers, provide technological foci, and facilitate problem solving. Doing so 
will ensure that management, technical, and operating work are distinguishable so 
that people can be most efficient in performing such work (Kumar 2012; Burke 2013; 
Daft 2012).
Many industrial organizations adopt one or more of the following structures.
3.5.1  Functional Organization
The functional structure is a very widely used organizational form in industry. Companies 
that favor this organizational design include (1) manufacturing operations, process indus-
tries and other organizations with limited product diversity or high relative stability of 
workflow; (2) start-up companies; (3) companies with narrow product range, simple mar-
keting pattern, and few production sites; and (4) companies following the lead of their 
competitors.
Companies that prefer the functional structure establish specific departments responsi-
ble for manufacturing, finance, marketing, sales, engineering, design, operation, procure-
ment, and other such functions (see Figure 3.1).
The functional structure has certain advantages, as it (1) permits a hierarchy of skills to 
be developed and maintained, (2) facilitates specialization in order to achieve high levels 
of excellence, (3) simplifies coordination as experts in various functional areas are logi-
cally grouped together, and (4) allows the use of current technologies and state-of-the-art 
equipment.
On the other hand, it also has some disadvantages, such as (1) encouraging excessive 
centralization, (2) delaying decision-making due to barriers created by the departmental 
boundaries, (3) compounding communication line loss, (4) restricting the development of 
managerial skills of employees, and (5) limiting employee growth because of constrained 
exposure to professional experience outside of the departments.

3.5.2  Discipline-Based Organization
Universities, governmental laboratories, and some contract research firms are organized 
according to disciplines. These organizations contain departments for mechanical engi-
neering, physics, business administration, and other specific disciplines so that specialists 
may focus on these disciplines in order to excel in research and other activities they pur-
sue (see Figure 3.2).
3.5.3  Product/Region-Based Organization
Large companies may produce and market products/services of various types to different 
customers in geographically dispersed locations. More often than not, each of these prod-
ucts/services may require different production, sales, and business strategies to achieve 
success in the marketplace. Thus, some companies elect to organize themselves into a 
product-based structure (see Figure 3.3). If the company is marketing products/services 
in various geographical regions, each demanding location-specific strategies to penetrate 
the local markets, and each applying different customer customization strategies accord-
ing to local needs, a region-based structure may be preferred (see Figure 3.4). In either of 
these cases, a product/service or regional manager could head up the activities with the 
overall profit and loss (P/L) responsibility for the product/service or region involved. This

manager is further supported by the relevant experts in production, marketing, and other 
required functional areas.
This type of product- or region-based organization enjoys the following advantages: it 
(1) focuses on end products/service or geographical regions for improved local adapta-
tion, (2) facilitates companywide coordination, (3) encourages management development 
of employees, (4) provides for decentralization, and (5) opens ways for unlimited growth.
The disadvantages for such organizational structure are the following: (1) costs may 
be high due to layers and autonomous or duplicated facilities, (2) it may require added 
management talents, (3) specialists may easily become obsolete due to a lack of focus and 
dedication, and (4) changes are slow to implement because of the complex organizational 
bureaucracy.
The organizational structure types just described have one thing in common: they all 
have a hierarchical structure with a clearly defined chain of command, a structure origi-
nated from the military.
3.5.4  Matrix Organization
Some companies utilize the matrix organizational structure as a short-term arrangement 
for specific projects and tasks involving both functional group employees and project 
managers (Metcalfe 2014; Hall 2013; Finerty and Kraemer 2012).
Managers of functional groups supervise technical contributors who have valuable 
skills and know-how. Project managers are those entrusted by upper management with 
the responsibilities of managing specific projects, such as capital projects, the design 
of new products to specifications, and the creation of business entry strategies. Project 
managers have resources—money, time, facilities, and management support—and they 
“borrow” employees from the functional groups to accomplish the work (see Figure 3.5). 
When functional group employees complete their work for a given project, they usually 
return to their respective home groups to continue their original home-based assignments.
The advantages of matrix organizations are that project managers focus on schedule 
and cost, whereas functional managers concentrate on work quality and expertise. This 
arrangement offers a balance of workload, and it is excellent for participating employees 
to achieve wide exposure within the company by interacting with those outside of their 
special domains of expertise.
The main disadvantage is that this structure requires participating employees to report 
to two bosses (dual reporting), thus violating the “unity command” principle. When 
employees are assigned to work on several projects, they may be subjected to marching

orders issued by several superiors. In practice, conflicts between the functional and project 
managers are frequent and severe, mostly with respect to task priority, manpower assign-
ment, interests, quality versus urgency, performance appraisal, employee promotion, and 
other issues.
Matrix organization demands a delicate balance of power between functional and proj-
ect managers. Functional managers control manpower, particularly who works on what 
projects, when, and for how long, in addition to controlling knowledge and facilities. On 
the other hand, project managers have an approved spending budget and the support of 
upper management. A lack of a balance of power will occur when the functional manag-
ers have their own funds to support their own people, thus making them less dependent 
on project managers. An unbalance of power will also occur when project managers out-
source some of the needed work that is not delivered by the functional managers. Under 
these circumstances, the matrix organization might break down.
Because of the aforementioned built-in conflicts, many companies in industry are mov-
ing away from the matrix organizations in favor of teams.
Example 3.2
Once the functional manager and project manager agree on a project schedule, who is 
responsible for getting the work performed? Who is accountable for getting the work 
performed? Why the difference, if any?
Answer 3.2
Responsibility and accountability are two different management concepts.
In a matrix organization, the project manager delegates tasks to the functional man-
ager, who in turn assigns specific tasks to individual employees in his or her functional 
group. The functional manager remains responsible for getting the work performed, 
whereas the project manager is accountable for the results of the work that has been 
delegated to and done by the functional manager (or his or her people).

Engineering Management
The project manager is accountable for achieving specific project objectives. He or she 
defines the pertinent tasks to be accomplished. If the tasks are defined improperly, caus-
ing the project objectives to be impossible to attain, the project managers are account-
able for such mistakes. The functional manager, on the other hand, is responsible only 
for supplying the right people with the proper skills and dedication to accomplish the 
stated tasks. The functional manager is responsible for accomplishing the agreed-upon 
tasks in an efficient and professional manner.
3.5.5  Team Organization
A team is composed of members who are “on loan” from their respective functional 
departments and are thus assigned to work full time for the team leader in tackling 
high-priority, short-duration tasks or projects (McCloud 2014; Nir 2013; Harvard Business 
Review 2011). Since all team members report to the team leaders only, conflicts aris-
ing from dual reporting are eliminated (see Figure 3.6). Examples of team organization 
include product development teams and special task forces.
3.5.6  Network Organization
In response to rapid changes in customers’ needs, advancements in technology, market-
place competition, and globalization, some companies have started pursuing certain new 
business paradigms that are based on thinking globally and acting locally (Chen and

Wang 2015; Easley and Kleinberg 2010). One such paradigm is the inclusion of local suppli-
ers’ inherent technical skills and capabilities as a part of corporate strength.
Companies form alliances, create business networks, and establish supply chains with 
regional companies to manufacture, assemble, market, deliver, and service products for 
specific regional markets (see Figure 3.7). At the nodes of such networks are knowledge 
workers who manage relationships with others (e.g., suppliers, customers, functional 
groups within an organization, and other such partners) (Hoffman et al. 2014).
The number of such business network arrangements is expected to grow with time. 
Once formed, these networks must be properly maintained. Specific parts of these net-
works may be activated from time to time for business strategy development, product 
development, system design, quality control, logistics, customer service, and other such 
important projects (Ramos 2011).
Partners linked by these networks may be of different cultural and business back-
grounds with divergent value systems and perspectives, and may be dispersed in differ-
ent geographical regions. Engineering managers serving on such intercompany network 
organizations may also be challenged by the expected resistance to change, difference in 
working habits, absence of motivation and control means, and slowness in consensus-
building and decision-making.
Network organizations behave a step closer to organizations in chaos. According to 
complexity theory (sometimes also called chaos theory), these organizations exhibit several 
unique features (Holland 2014; Pflaeging 2014).
	
1.	All members are independent, flexible, and empowered. They behave responsibly, 
free of the traditional top-down command-and-control structures.
	
2.	Members tend to self-organize themselves by ways of intensive interactions 
between the members and to form self-directed network organizations.
	
3.	The flexible organizational form fosters creativity and innovation of empowered 
members.
The complexity theory claims that organizations composed of members with personal 
autonomy will be better able to operate in economical, political, and social-cultural envi-
ronments that are turbulent and rapidly varying (Alvira 2014). Rigid objectives and instruc-
tions will no longer be effective in managing such enterprises in the emerging global 
FIGURE 3.7
Network organization.

62
Engineering Management
economy. The following three underlying principles have been proposed to describe such 
organizations:
	
1.	Connectivity: Members in the network organizations recognize themselves as an 
integral part of the whole organization and believe that their best interests are 
served when the interests of the greater whole are served. Members are closely 
connected with one another.
	
2.	Indeterminacy: The turbulent future cannot be readily predicted or planned. 
Members of the organization need to empower themselves to act with confidence, 
courage, and integrity.
	
3.	Consciousness: Organizations are products of the collective thinking comprising 
them. The collective consciousness of the organization is defined by all of its mem-
bers. Everyone is a vital contributor.
Members exercise self-control and are guided by shared essential values, such as honesty, 
loyalty, integrity, independence, and responsibility. Teamwork is a hallmark of such organi-
zations, wherein individuals are increasingly autonomous, flexible, and dedicated. Product 
customization is a likely means for such organizations to achieve success in the marketplace.
Network organizations involving independent supply partners could be difficult to 
manage. It is not likely that much can be accomplished by leaving them alone to direct 
themselves, as suggested by the complexity theory. Engineering managers need to prepare 
themselves to effectively lead such network organizations.
Example 3.3
Company X manufactures automobile jacks, hubcaps, and a variety of fittings. These 
products are sold as replacement parts through auto supply chain stores. The busi-
ness of the company is growing, with production facilities located in rented buildings 
over various parts of the city. The production staff is expanding constantly. Now the 
president of the company wants to expand into the brass-fittings business. However, 
the president realizes that, after this newest expansion is accomplished, the company 
should consolidate to make its production operations more efficient.
Which organizational structure should the company adopt now, so that it can best 
accommodate its current needs of business expansion and also lay the foundation for 
anticipated consolidation thereafter? What information is needed to set forth such an 
organizational structure? What are the crucial variables that should be considered in 
the design of such an organization?
Answer 3.3
To expand the brass-fittings business, Company X should set up a multidisciplinary 
team initially. This team will be empowered to come up with a business plan to enter 
the brass-fittings business on the basis of market research and competitive analysis. The 
plan should include market share position, time-to-market goals, marketing strategies, 
capital investment, and production or sourcing requirements. It may be useful to retain 
competent external business consultants for advisement.
The business plan defines the needs of personnel (capabilities, experience, and num-
ber), facilities, and other resources required for implementation. A product-centered 
department is set up to be responsible for the profit and loss of the brass-fittings busi-
ness. While the distribution of brass fittings may be readily handled by the existing 
organization in the company, special attention needs to be paid to production, market-
ing, engineering, and service of brass fittings.

63
Organizing
Once the brass-fittings business is fully established, the production facilities of brass 
fittings could be integrated into the production organization of other company products 
in order to realize scale of economies advantages.
The organizational design must be flexible to effectively serve the purpose at hand. 
Crucial variables to be considered in the organizational design include the significance 
of the brass-fittings business to the company’s overall performance (e.g., market size, 
competition, and profitability), extent of the resources required of the company to enter 
the brass-fittings business, and the management and technical talents available inside 
and outside of the company.
3.6  Enhancing Corporate Performance by Organizing: Examples
Organizing is an efficacious method to achieve the critically important objective of doing 
things right (or performing tasks in the most efficient ways). Management can put the 
right people together and keep the wrong people separated so that work efficiency and 
goal attainment can be greatly enhanced (Lawler 2001). The following are several best-
practice examples of how company productivity was raised by employing organizing 
strategies.
3.6.1  Organizing for Profitability: Service Profit Chain Model
For every service company there are five stakeholders, namely, customers, employees, sup-
pliers, investors, and the community in which the company operates. Not all of them are 
equally important from the company’s standpoint. In the new economy of services, front-
line workers and customers need to be the center of management’s concern. Customers are 
value oriented, emphasizing results in relation to costs. As profits come from customers, 
the key concept of the service profit chain model is to treat employees well so that they 
make customers happy, who in turn buy more, which leads to improved corporate profit-
ability, and allows suppliers and investors to be paid properly, as well as avoiding upset-
ting the communities in which they operate (Heskett et al. 2008). Figure 3.8 illustrates this 
model.
In Figure 3.8, organizational strategies refer to preparatory activities and tasks related to 
workplace design, job design, employee selection and development, employee rewards and 
recognition, and the introduction of applicable tools for serving customers. Specifically, 
companies strive to take the following steps:
	
1.	Hire employees with the right attitude toward jobs, coworkers and companies, as 
people are the heart of service businesses.
	
2.	Promote capabilities (tools, technology, and infrastructure) and empower service 
workers to achieve results for customers.
	
3.	Communicate with customers and employees to get feedback and recognize good 
performance.
	
4.	Achieve employee satisfaction as related to jobs, training, pay, advancement fair-
ness, treat people with dignity, teamwork, company’s interest in employees’ well-
being. Set up an 800 phone number to help solve employees’ problems.
	
5.	Link manager’s compensation (say 20%) to customer satisfaction.

64
Engineering Management
Customer satisfaction is the ultimate goal that all service companies want to achieve. 
Customer satisfaction can be measured by a set of metrics using third-party interviews. 
These metrics include: (1) percentage of loyal customers with repeat businesses; (2) per-
centage of sales due to repeat customers; (3) funds spent to promote customer retention; 
and (4) company’s understanding of the reasons for customer defect, and actions taken 
to mitigate. Service quality is a function of the gap between perceptions of active ser-
vice received and customer’s expectations beforehand (as related to reliability, timeliness, 
empathy and authority of service delivery, extent of evidence for service rendered). It is 
of critical importance to the company that service errors be quickly corrected. External 
service value refers to the value received by customers based on the extent in which the 
service designed and delivered satisfies their needs.
Customer loyalty results in retention, repeat business, and referrals. For service com-
panies, the service profit chain model represents a useful organizational design concept 
because it emphasizes, among other stakeholders, the two most important ones: employ-
ees and customers.
3.6.2  Organizing for High Performance by Using Flexible Structure
Organizational structures are known to have an impact on corporate performance. Some 
companies allow the structure to continuously evolve in order to adapt to changing oppor-
tunities in the marketplace.
According to Morgan (2014) new-style companies achieved great business success by 
being relentlessly committed and by exercising discipline from the top, as well as practic-
ing three organizational principles:
	
1.	Make it everyone’s job to identify new opportunities. Company culture must sup-
port such practices by way of feedback loop and financial incentives.
	
2.	Decide quickly on project priority. Speed and coordination are critically important 
in implementation. Use technology to support decision-making wherever possi-
ble, and fill the gaps with fast, centralized, senior-level decision-making.

3.	Hire people for specific roles such as marketing and technology support. This is 
needed for implementing ideas to quickly capitalize on new opportunities in the 
marketplace.
3.6.3  Organizing for Innovation
Some companies are more focused than others on developing and sustaining corpo-
rate competitiveness by nurturing innovation. Innovation can be fostered by company 
structure.
Judging from the degree of innovative novelty, Chesbrough and Teece (2002) suggest 
that there are two types of innovations: autonomous and systemic inventions. Autonomous 
inventions are those which can be pursued independently of other innovations. For exam-
ple, inventions related to turbochargers could be pursued independently of inventions 
related to automobiles, to which turbochargers are applied for boosting power output. 
Similar relationships exist between filters and air conditioners, motors and compressors, 
and color-print films and analog cameras. Systemic inventions, on the other hand, are those 
that must be developed in close coordination with others. Examples include the develop-
ment of product design, supplier management and information technology for lean manu-
facturing, and films and cameras for instant photography. Because autonomous inventions 
may be pursued independently of other inventions, they are better suited for virtual orga-
nizations. Vertical organizations, on the other hand, are more likely to succeed in pursuing 
systemic inventions that require close coordination and intensive information sharing.
Organizing a company’s structure to be virtual means that all noncore functions are 
typically outsourced. These virtual companies form supply chain partnerships and busi-
ness alliances to develop, manufacture, market, distribute, and support their offerings. 
They use incentives—sign-up bonuses, stock options—to attract highly trained indepen-
dent inventors to generate breakthrough inventions. Because of the self-interests of all par-
ticipants, the coordination between these partners can be difficult, rendering the resulting 
inventions of value only to some, but not to others.
Vertically organized companies are those that have rigid hierarchical organizational 
structures. They maintain control of all functions and typically have well-established 
procedures for settling conflicts and for planning all activities that promote innovations. 
Systemic inventions require information sharing and adjustments, which these vertically 
integrated companies can readily promote and safeguard. However, they cannot offer the 
high incentives that virtual companies use to attract independent inventors. As a conse-
quence, they may not be able to access top-level talent for creating innovations.
Therefore, when organizing for innovations, one must choose between talents and con-
trol. The key is to select the right kind of organizational form to match the type of inno-
vation (autonomous, systemic, or a mix of the two) the company needs. At one extreme, 
virtual companies are suitable for pursuing autonomous innovations. At the other extreme, 
vertical companies are excellent for pursuing systemic inventions. As the invention type 
changes gradually from purely autonomous to purely systemic, the company should con-
sider intermediate forms of organizations such as alliances, joint ventures, and collabora-
tions with autonomous divisions.
Looking from the perspective of value-added applications, Keeley et al. (2013) suggest 
that there are in fact 10 types of innovation related to the following categories
	
1.	Business model (the strategy to generate profitability via pricing, marketing 
and/or customer service initiatives)

66
Engineering Management
	
2.	Network (including supply chain partners and open innovation collaborators)
	
3.	Structure (organizational design, virtual teams, and joint ventures)
	
4.	Process (work processes related to design, production, and customer support)
	
5.	Products/services design (novel features, unique functionalities, and emerging 
technologies)
	
6.	Products/service systems (value-added capabilities to form ecosystems)
	
7.	Customer support services (web design, information access, and problem solving)
	
8.	Channel (advertising to reach customers, delivery of products/services)
	
9.	Brand (creation and maintenance of brand reputation)
	 10.	Customer engagement (customer interactions and relationship management)
Innovations in all the above-cited categories are valuable, as some will create strategic 
differentiation (e.g., categories 1, 5, 6, and 9) and others enhance operational excellence of 
the enterprise. Thus, innovations in categories 5 and 6 are more likely to be of the break-
through types, whereas the rest are of the incremental types.
Gibson (2016) described the following four lenses as a new powerful tool for promoting 
critical thinking:
	
1.	Identify unmet needs overlooked by others. Thomas Edison said, “None of my 
invention came as accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial 
after trial until it comes.”
	
2.	Apply resources synergistically to define solutions.
	
3.	Ask what-if questions in order to remove constraints imposed by conventional 
thinking pattern. Albert Einstein said: “To raise new questions, new possibilities, 
to regard old questions from a new angle, requires creative new imagination and 
marks real advance.”
	
4.	Gather energy to create breakthrough.
For creating innovations in these application categories, teams that are composed of 
qualified professionals with knowledge and work experience are the preferred organi-
zational type. Enterprises will be best served by pursuing combination innovations in a 
number of the aforementioned application categories in order to prevent their innovations 
from being readily copied by their competitors.
Nowadays, few companies can afford to develop all needed technologies internally. A 
mix of approaches is usually adopted. Some technologies are developed in-house to serve 
as the core part of the value chain. Other less critical ones are typically purchased outright 
or acquired through license, partnership, and alliance. Over the long run, however, key 
value-added advances will need to come from within.
3.6.4  Organizing for Performance at Design–Manufacturing Interface
Conflicts are known to exist at the interface between product design and manufacturing. 
These conflicts cause frequent cost overruns and product introduction delays. In many 
traditional companies, the product design group signs off on the design, and then they 
“throw it over the wall.” The group responsible for manufacturability takes over and reex-
amines the design for cost-effective mass production. While product design may have 

67
Organizing
focused on performance and aesthetics, manufacturing looks after production efficiency. 
Also contributing to these conflicts are other factors such as (1) funding periods for design 
and manufacturing that do not overlap, (2) differences in education between design and 
manufacturing staff, and (3) offices that are not at the same location.
Some of these difficulties may be removed by way of organizing (Anderson 2014). 
Organizational options for improving the design–manufacturing interface include the fol-
lowing (Dean and Susman 1989):
	
1.	Institute a manufacturing sign-off. Manufacturing has veto power over the final 
product design. Selected software programs are available to calculate a produc-
ibility score for checking on manufacturability.
	
2.	Appoint an integrator who performs liaison work between design and manufac-
turing and offers a balanced view.
	
3.	Form a cross-functional team composed of members of design and manufactur-
ing, with the final authority resting with the engineering department. The use of 
such cross-functional teams is known to have significant benefits such as ensur-
ing compatibility between the design and manufacturing processes, saving time, 
simplifying the design process, and reducing design changes.
	
4.	Combine the manufacturing process and product design into one department.
In general, if the company’s culture is conducive to absorbing organizational changes, 
then the organizational options of the team or combined department are to be preferred. 
On the other hand, if the products and manufacturing processes are fixed, then the orga-
nizational options of the sign-off or integrator tend to make more sense.
3.6.5  Organizing for Heightened Employee Motivation
As a rule, teams are temporary in nature because they are built for specific objectives and 
will be disbanded after their specific projects have been completed (Wheelan 2014). Only 
in exceptional cases will teams be exhaustively utilized on a permanent basis to achieve 
business success. This is the case of AES Corporation.
Located in Arlington, Virginia, AES Corporation is the largest global power company, 
with sales at $17.146 billion (2014), it operated 90 plants in 18 countries. Seventy-five percent 
of its business was in contract generation. Table 3.1 shows its income statements for the 
period 2012–2014.
The company has very few organizational layers and, except for a corporate accounting 
department, keeps no staff for functional specialties. It is organized into 11 regions, each

headed up by a manager. Each region is further organized into 5–20 teams, and each team 
has 5–20 members. Teams are created primarily for the combined functions of plant opera-
tion and maintenance.
Each team has no more than one of each kind of expert or specialist. As a result, everyone 
on the team becomes a well-rounded generalist. In-house qualification exams are held to 
ensure minimum expertise before job rotation requests of employees are approved. Each 
team owns what it does and is empowered to make decisions with commensurate authority 
to implement their decisions. The roles for company leaders are limited to advisors, guard-
ians of the company principles, encouragers, and officers accountable to the outside world.
Employees are compensated according to the following formula: (1) 50% on financial 
performance and safety and environmental impact and (2) 50% on how well employees 
follow the four company values—fairness, integrity, social responsibility, and fun. The 
hiring practice of the company focuses on cultural fit first and technical skills second.
Company representatives attribute their business success for organizing the company in 
teams to the heightened level of employee motivation made possible by the team empow-
erment practice.
It should be noted that the AES Corporation example may indeed apply well to other 
low-tech operations such as warehouses, distribution centers, supermarkets, hardware 
stores, and service centers wherein repeat common practices are the norm. Everything 
you would ever want to know about operating and maintaining a conventional power 
plant has already been sufficiently preserved in manuals; in-depth technical expertise and 
innovation are not required.
3.6.6  Organizing for Research & Development and Marketing Interface
Some companies in industry are high tech, and others are not. “High tech” refers to prod-
ucts and services characterized by (1) their strong scientific–technical bases, (2) the pos-
sibility of being quickly obsolete because of new technologies, and (3) the capability to 
develop or revolutionize markets and demands when built on new emerging technologies. 
Examples of high-tech products include semiconductors, microcomputers, and robotics.
High-tech companies need to pay special attention to the interface between R&D and 
marketing. To achieve business success, a linkage between R&D and marketing must be 
established. When marketing high-tech products or services, companies typically follow 
two basic approaches:
	
1.	Market driven: When pursuing the market-driven strategy, companies use market-
ing to define the needs of customers and ask R&D to provide the required innova-
tions to satisfy such needs. Customer suggestions are typically good sources of 
new needs. In this case, marketing uses tools such as concept testing, product pro-
totyping, and pilot testing to define the specific product or service features needed 
by customers. Marketing efforts precede the R&D efforts. The consequence of 
practicing a market-driven strategy is that there may be a possible delay in break-
through innovations, preventing the company from a timely use of the opportuni-
ties offered in the marketplace.
	
2.	Innovation driven: R&D employees take the lead in the innovation-driven approach 
by first making breakthrough inventions based on preemptive needs as perceived 
by researchers. Then, the researchers consider pursuing the inventions to satisfy 
the real needs and wants of the customers. In such situations, marketing applies 

69
Organizing
techniques such as focus groups to verify new product concepts and applications. 
There are risks associated with this approach, as identified customers’ needs and 
wants may not be sufficiently satisfied by the breakthrough inventions at hand.
A lack of coordination between R&D and marketing is known to be the cause of busi-
ness failures in many companies. Furthermore, any new technology advancement by com-
petition can change the company’s market position instantly.
Organizing a workable interface between R&D and marketing is a way of avoiding the 
potential loss of market opportunities due to invention delay and the lack of compatibility 
of inventions to the actual market needs. Setting up a team of representatives of R&D and 
marketing to constantly monitor relevant activities and foster communications should be 
a good organizing strategy (Ellis 2010).
3.7  Concurrent Engineering Teams
Cross-functional teams have become crucial to business success (Ngayo 2014; Blank 2012). 
In general, teams are set up to (1) generate recommendations, such as a strategy to enter 
a specific regional market or solve a specific customer-related problem; (2) make or do 
things—design products, develop new processes, install new assembly lines; and (3) run 
things—operate plants. The performance of a team is the sum of the performance by indi-
vidual members plus the work outputs brought about by the members working together. 
It is the work output delivered by the members working together (the team synergism) 
that is responsible for the superiority of the overall team performance over the sum of the 
performances of the individuals. Teams may fail if they are not led properly (Danner and 
Coopersmith 2015).
Organizing multifunctional teams is often the preferred choice to address complex coor-
dination issues at interfaces. For example, in a typical functional organization, the devel-
opment of new products follows a sequential process enumerated here:
	
1.	Marketing conducts research to identify the customers’ needs and defines product 
features, such as functionality, reliability, ease of repair, resale value, warranty, 
and so on.
	
2.	Design engineering releases specifications, performs functional design, selects 
material, obtains vendor and supplier inputs, and conducts engineering analyses 
to incorporate these features into a product.
	
3.	Manufacturing engineering reviews and simplifies the product design for manufac-
turability and reliability considerations.
	
4.	Service organization further changes the design to enhance serviceability.
	
5.	Production is finally set up to define manufacturing techniques and to mass-
produce the product.
Such sequential processes are known to be inherently ineffective with respect to coordi-
nation, information sharing, and decision-making. In a concurrent engineering team, rep-
resentatives of all of the functional groups just mentioned, plus those from procurement, 
finance, vendors and suppliers, product testing, and logistics, are included as members. 

70
Engineering Management
All aspects related to product development are considered early on and concurrently. The 
goal is to bring forth an optimum product for the company within the shortest period 
of time and at the lowest possible cost, while satisfying all constraints and meeting all 
requirements.
All team members have the full support of their respective departments, functional 
units, and home bases, so that the specific inputs they make on the team at various stages 
of product development are always the best possible inputs (Lencioni 2002). The keys to the 
success of concurrent engineering teams are the following:
	
1.	Management commitment
	
2.	Ongoing communications that use advanced communication tools such as the 
intranet, e-mails, and electronic data interchange (EDI)
	
3.	Teamwork training for all members
The value of the concurrent engineering team concept is evident from the following 
statistics:
•	 Mercury Computer Systems, Inc., Lowell, Massachusetts—concurrent engineer-
ing team reduced the time to market of its add-on process boards for VME (Versa 
Module Eurocard) bus from 125 to 90 days.
•	 Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, California—cut the time to market its 54600 
Oscilloscope by two-thirds.
•	 Toyota Motor Corporation, Tokyo, Japan—concurrent engineering decreased its 
product cost by 61%.
In general, concurrent engineering delivered impressive benefits in the order of magni-
tude shown in Table 3.2 (Parsaei and Sullivan 2012; Stiepandic et al. 2015).
Engineering managers need to become proficient in leading and participating in concur-
rent engineering teams. Teams may be formed to address any important corporate task. 
For teams to add value, team leaders need to pay attention to team discipline, team learn-
ing, and factors affecting team effectiveness.
3.7.1  Mutual Trust and Accountability
For a “blow-the-roof-off” performance, a team is often the vehicle of choice. But to excel, the 
team needs to possess the right characteristics, such as the ability to listen well, respond 
constructively, support one another, share team values, and have discipline (Scott 2014; 
Struck 2013).

71
Organizing
A team is a small number of people (usually between 2 and 25) who are committed to a 
common purpose, develop mutual trust, possess technical skills that are complementary, 
and adopt an approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.
Team members are said to have developed mutual accountability if and when they have 
reached the emotional state of “being in the boat together.” Without mutual accountability, 
there can be no team of real value.
3.7.2  Team Learning
One decisive factor that affects a team’s responsiveness is its learning capability (Sibley 
and Ostafichuk 2014; Chantal and Peter 2012). In corporate settings, teams need to learn 
new technologies (such as three-dimensional computer-aided design [CAD], visualization 
software, project management tools, videoconferencing, web-based net-meeting tools, and 
others) or new processes (such as new ways of working and new relationships for col-
laborative work). How fast a team can learn will affect its overall timely performance in 
attaining the specific objectives at hand.
A learning team is one that is skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge 
and at modifying its own behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights. The team needs 
to have systems and procedures in place to do the following:
	
1.	Solve problems systematically
	
2.	Experiment with new approaches
	
3.	Learn from its own experience and past history
	
4.	Learn from other’s experience and best practices
	
5.	Disseminate knowledge effectively throughout the team and organization
Edmondson (2012) studied a large number of cardiovascular surgical teams. They 
believe that team learning may be speeded up if the team leaders possess both technical 
and managerial skills. Because learning has both technical and organizational aspects—
status, communications—the organizational skills of the team leader affect the team learn-
ing. Factors affecting team learning include the following:
	
1.	Team composition: When selecting team members, team leaders should give preference 
to members’ technical competence—retention of a mix of skills and expertise, ability 
to work with others, willingness to deal with ambiguous situations (risk takers), and 
self-confidence in making suggestions and proposing ideas while not inhibited by 
other members’ ranking and corporate status. The most effective learning takes place 
during the process. Teams with a mix of expertise and experience tend to be able to 
draw on members’ relevant past experience, thus promoting learning.
	
2.	Team cultures: Team leaders should build a team culture in which some experimen-
tation is encouraged and failure is acceptable.
	
3.	Leader’s style: Teams will learn better and faster if, as motivation, the team leaders 
frame the learning as a challenge for all team members.
Factors that do not affect team learning are said to include (1) educational background, 
(2)  prior experience in applying old technologies, (3) top management commitment, 
(4) status of the team leader, and (5) reporting and auditing processes.

72
Engineering Management
Example 3.4
Some people feel that working as a team, instead of allowing experts to produce more 
creative outcomes, actually result in watered-down compromises and bland solutions. 
They view teamwork as a series of exercises in “sharing ignorance.” Do you agree or 
disagree, and why? What can be done to advance the technical qualities of the team 
outcomes?
Answer 3.4
The concern about the watered-downed outputs of teams is real. Team members from 
different backgrounds and expertise may indeed have different opinions, which often 
force the team members to compromise. It is quite true that sometimes the views of the 
domain experts on the team are not shared and accepted by others on the team, who do 
not and will not want to understand. However, a Japanese proverb says, “None of us are 
as smart as all of us.”
One obvious way to ensure the technical quality of the team results is to select people 
to lead who are technically qualified and able to render technical judgment. Another 
way is to bring in an impartial outside consultant to comment and advise on the relative 
technical merits of the options under consideration.
Team consensus is good to have, because it allows the team members to jointly own 
the team outcome. This ownership represents a strong motivation factor to team mem-
bers who are then inspired to actively implement the team outcome. A technically supe-
rior team outcome adds little value if it is not implemented properly.
3.8  Delegating
After a specific form of organization is established—unit, department, team, division, 
or regional group—the next step is for the engineering manager to delegate the proper 
responsibility and authority to the selected leaders and workers, and to establish the 
upward-directed accountability needed to achieve the defined organizational objectives. 
Therefore, delegating is for the purpose of improving the engineering manager’s over-
all efficiency by assigning responsibility and authority and by creating accountability 
(Hollingsworth 2013).
The benefits of delegating are many (Thomas 2015; Syversen 2014). For engineering man-
agers, these benefits include: (1) improving the quality and quantity of work performed, 
(2) relieving the engineering manager to pursue more important duties or gain more time 
for management work, (3) making the engineering manager knowledgeable of the employ-
ee’s capabilities, (4) preparing the employee to step in for the engineering manager when 
needed and hence enabling the engineering manager to be absent from the job occasion-
ally, (5) distributing the workload effectively, (6) developing leadership qualities, (7) eas-
ing the engineering manager’s job pressure, and (8) reducing costs through more efficient 
operating decisions.
Delegating is also beneficial to engineers as technical contributors because it (1) makes 
the job more satisfying; (2) provides encouragement, incentives, and recognition; (3) devel-
ops new skills and knowledge; (4) promotes self-confidence; (5) facilitates teamwork; 
(6) encourages growth and development; and (7) fosters initiative and competence.
It is important for engineering managers to keep in mind what should and should not 
be delegated. Problems and activities of the following kinds are to be delegated: (1) those 

73
Organizing
that require exploration and recommendation for a decision; (2) those that are within the 
scope and capabilities of employees involved; (3) those that are needed to achieve company 
objectives; (4) those that promote the employee’s development in technologies, business 
perspectives, and leadership skills; and (5) those that save the engineering manager’s time 
if done properly by the employees.
For delegating, the following guidelines, which are also illustrated in Figure 3.9, may be 
helpful:
	
1.	What the engineering manager cannot do and the employee can do, the employee 
does it.
	
2.	What both the engineering manager and employee cannot do, the engineering 
manager does it.
	
3.	What both the engineering manager and the employee can do, the employee 
does it.
	
4.	What the engineering manager can do and the employee cannot, the engineering 
manager does it.
Which problems or activities should the engineering manager not delegate? Such prob-
lems or activities include (1) planning/creating plans within larger plans and objectives, 
(2) resolving morale problems in the group or department, (3) reconciling differences and 
conflicts, (4) coaching and developing employees, (5) reviewing performance of employ-
ees, (6) completing assignments given to engineering managers by their superiors, and 
(7) completing other assignments only engineering managers themselves should handle 
(such as confidential committee assignments, “pet” projects, and tasks without proper tal-
ented employees to delegate to).
Delegating requires skill and practice. The following are guidelines for efficacious 
delegation:
	
1.	Explain the importance of the assignment.
	
2.	Check on understanding and confidence.
	
3.	Give the employee leeway in his or her choice of method, unless the procedure has 
been specified and developed before.
	
4.	Set a goal, timetable, or deadline. A short-term goal is better than a long-term goal.

5.	Be reasonable. Keep the goal within the employee’s capabilities.
	
6.	Assign responsibilities that go with the job. Allow commensurate authority of 
decision-making, and let employees accept responsibility for poor as well as good 
work. (The engineering managers remain accountable for the delegated assign-
ment with respect to their own superiors.)
	
7.	Trust the employee.
	
8.	Give recognition for good work.
	
9.	Share the engineering manager’s own worries. Let the employees know your wor-
ries about the assignment; explain them openly and fully. Recognize difficulties in 
the assignment and ask for suggestions on how best to handle the assignment.
	 10.	Make it a project; let the assignment be a challenge.
	 11.	Do not rush in and take over. The employee could use more training if a lack of 
progress is shown.
	 12.	Do not expect or want perfection.
Certain barriers to delegation do exist. Engineering managers need to beware of these 
barriers: (1) Psychological—engineering managers have fears and worries. If engineering 
managers let the employee do the work, they may fear their own technological obsoles-
cence, while their employees shine. This fear may be particularly relevant to engineering 
managers who themselves are technically very strong. (2) Organizational—unclear respon-
sibility and relationships, and confused understanding of line versus staff positions may 
hinder effectual delegation.
There are several more noteworthy observations:
•	 Delegation tends to be limited by the availability of effective controls. If there is 
no control, there should be no delegation. Engineering managers should delegate 
safely only to the extent that one can determine if the work can be correctly carried 
out and decisions can be made in the manner that they should be. Furthermore, 
engineering managers should make sure that the plans are sound and that con-
trols are in effect.
•	 Authority must be commensurate with responsibility. Engineering managers 
should delegate enough authority to allow decision-making by the employees 
related to the work.
•	 Accountability is demanded of employees who are obligated to their superiors for 
achieving the expected results. Accountability is achieved by properly discharg-
ing responsibility and using authority delegated. Effectiveness of and success in 
delegation depends on the willingness and ability of the employee to perform the 
work, make decisions, and achieve results.
•	 Control must be in place. Engineering managers need to introduce midcourse cor-
rections, if needed. Otherwise, delegation will lead to disaster. Setting up perfor-
mance metrics and constantly monitoring performance will help.
Many engineers fail to achieve success in managerial ranks, partly because they do 
not know how to delegate properly. Good delegation is a prerequisite for being a good 
manager.

75
Organizing
3.9  Establishing Working Relationships
Another organizing activity to be performed by engineering managers is the establish-
ment of proper working relationships between employees and between units (Parker 2010). 
This is to ensure that people are working together well enough to achieve the company 
objectives. Specifically, the activity calls for role clarification and conflict resolution.
3.9.1  Role Clarification
In complex organizational settings, clarifying roles addresses the issues of authority and 
accountability. For a specific project involving personnel of multiple departments or busi-
ness units, the need for defining roles of all participants is self-evident. Figure 3.10 illus-
trates an example of role clarification.

Engineering Management
Companies issue organizational charts that describe the roles and responsibilities of 
major business units. Employees may assume line roles, coordinating roles, and advisory 
roles.
	
1.	Line roles: Employees with line roles are those in profit centers with monopoly 
rights within the company to provide products and services to clients and cus-
tomers. Examples of profit centers include business management, production, and 
sales. Profit centers are business units empowered to generate profits for the com-
pany. Managers of profit centers are accountable for offering quality products and 
services at competitive prices to ensure that the company makes profits. Profit 
centers define the services they might need. Managers of profit centers approve 
the annual budgets of cost centers which provide such needed services.
	
2.	Coordinating roles: Employees in some cost centers have monopoly rights for 
developing and recommending constraints on the position duties of others. 
These constraints can take the form of approvals, policies, procedures, or plan-
ning objectives—legal, financial control, human resources, and so on. They are 
accountable for achieving higher-level organizational objectives such as consis-
tency in work method, integration regarding external contacts, or cost efficiencies.
	
3.	Advisory roles: Employees in other cost centers provide services in support of the 
profit centers. Examples of such cost centers include R&D, maintenance, investors’ 
relations, financial accounting, and procurement.
3.9.2  Conflict Resolution
In the real-world environment, there are conflicts of many types. Examples of such conflicts 
may include: (1) technical, including design, analysis, and interpretation of test results; (2) oper-
ational, including procedures to perform specific tasks and assign responsibility; (3) emotional, 
such as treating bruised egos and hurt personal feelings; and (4) political, such as knowing 
whom to consult and who has a say on specific projects or issues (Coleman et al. 2014).
Engineering managers need to learn how to effectively resolve conflicts (Caspersen 2015; 
Cloke and Goldsmith 2011). Conflicts may be resolved by (1) dominance—dictating a solu-
tion, (2) compromise—negotiation based on a relative power base, and (3) collaboration that 
leads to finding a win–win solution. The key requirement for conflict resolution is open-
ness. By fostering mutual respect and trust, nurturing common interest to achieve project 
success, and focusing on commitment to task, most conflicts can be successfully resolved.
3.10  Informal Organizations
Beside the formal organizations, which is set up to achieve work efficiency, there are infor-
mal organizations in every business enterprise (Farris 2012). Typical informal organiza-
tions are of the following types:
	
1.	Social: People form groups to pursue specific common interests, shared values, and 
beliefs; for example, beer clubs, bowling clubs, company outings, golf leagues, and 
tennis groups.

77
Organizing
	
2.	Status: People tend to be drawn toward persons well known for their technical 
skills, abilities, special accomplishments, experience, tenure, charisma, interests, 
peer recognition, and acceptance, and to want to associate with such achievers for 
their status.
	
3.	Group: Coalitions form to advance shared interests. Fitness centers on site, day-care 
centers, toastmasters groups, foreign-language study groups, and bridge clubs are 
such examples.
	
4.	Location: Depending on the flow of vital information, people tend to migrate 
toward critical locations, such as the offices of executive assistants, the desks of 
secretaries, and water coolers.
Engineering managers should be aware that informal organizations encourage addi-
tional bonding between employees. Because they contribute toward the smooth operation 
of an organization and members’ job satisfaction, employee participation in informal orga-
nizations are generally encouraged.
3.11  Conclusion
Organizing is an important function of engineering management with a direct impact on 
the manager’s ability to get work done efficiently. This function empowers a manager to 
choose the right organizational forms, be they teams, committees, task forces, functional 
or matrix arrangements, or other specific organizational structures. Managers assign 
appropriately skilled and compatible people to work together, each one having clearly 
defined roles and responsibilities, along with commensurate authority. Managers assign 
responsibilities to employees so that work gets done and employees can receive broadened 
experience. Managers allocate the right resources (such as skills, money, equipment, time, 
and technology) to accomplish the work efficiently.
Organizing is also important for enhancing the quality of work output. Flexible organi-
zational structures allow companies to better respond to the changes of a dynamic mar-
ketplace. Certain organizational forms are superior to others in fostering creativity and 
inducing innovations. Multifunctional teams are known to be superior in handling con-
flicts at the interface between design and manufacturing or between R&D and marketing. 
Teams empowered by management to pursue specific assignments tend to be strongly 
motivating to the team members.
Engineering managers need to understand the power of organizing and use the func-
tion intelligently.
QUESTIONS
	
1.	What type of organizational structure is best suited for developing a new product 
that requires a high level of specialization in several functions and for which the 
time to market represents a critical factor?
	
2.	A materials manager suspects that the quality of work within her department has 
been deteriorating. She wants to introduce a program of change to advance qual-
ity. What steps should she take?

78
Engineering Management
	
3.	The company has recently concluded a multimillion-dollar contract to supply 
products to a Third World country. The first elite group of engineers from that 
country has just completed a two-month training course on maintenance and 
operations. The company’s training manager reports that the level of skill and 
knowledge of that country’s engineers was so low that no amount of training 
would ever enable them to properly operate and maintain the products in ques-
tion. “It might be better for that country to buy a less sophisticated product 
from our competitor,” the training manager suggests. What should the com-
pany do?
	
4.	Six months ago, the company hired an engineer for his expertise in hydraulic 
drives. The decision to hire him was based on a product development plan that 
projected a need for such expertise. Market conditions have suddenly changed in 
favor of more sophisticated electric drives. The new engineer turns out to be very 
good in his area of specialization, but it is difficult to retrain him for other assign-
ments in the company. Should the company discharge this engineer?
	
5.	The company has been making most of its sales to a few large customers. The 
company president wishes to broaden its customer base. To do so may require 
changes in the company culture, the product line strategy, marketing and sales 
programs, and the service organization. How should the president go about mak-
ing the required changes?
	
6.	The company is considering a plan to upgrade its current product line. The cost 
of upgrading is high. There is a small company that has developed the technol-
ogy required for this product upgrade. What strategy should the company follow 
if it wants to continue selling into its current market with the new, upgraded 
product?
	
7.	As the company’s sales are falling unexpectedly, the president asks you to chair 
a task force with the objective of developing solutions to correct the situation. 
Who do you want to be on this task force? How should the task force resolve this 
problem?
	
8.	A loyal and high-volume customer has warned the company’s marketing depart-
ment that project X is extremely critical to their needs and that if this project is late, 
they may be forced to buy elsewhere. The project manager knows that the best 
estimates available to date from various in-house groups indicate that, at the cur-
rent rate of progress, project X will be late by about six months. What should the 
project manager do?
	
9.	Sally Lee, the engineering manager, delegates tasks as a good manager should. 
However, Mark Hayes, the engineering director, has the bad habit of calling 
up Sally unexpectedly to get detailed reports on various ongoing activities in 
Sally’s department. Sally does not want to hold daily staff meetings in order to 
satisfy Mark’s information needs because Sally is quite certain that asking her 
professional staff to stand by and make daily reports will definitely be counter-
productive, as all of them are known to prefer their independence. What should 
Sally do?
	 10.	In an organization offering a dual-ladder career progression system, technically 
trained people may opt to progress along a technical ladder instead of the tradi-
tional managerial ladder. How does this work? (Figure 3.11)

Leading
4.1  Introduction
Leading in engineering management refers to the function of an engineering manager that 
causes people to take effective action. After deciding what is worth doing, the engineer-
ing manager relies on communication and motivation to get employees to act. By select-
ing workers who are inclined to collaborate, the engineering manager motivates them to 
steadily add value to the company. In addition, skills training and attitude development 
may also enable employees to take action. In this chapter, five specific leading activities will 
be discussed, namely, deciding, communicating, motivating, selecting, and developing.
The true measure of the quality of an engineering manager’s leadership is his or her 
demonstrated ability to guide and direct the efforts of employees to attain organizational 
objectives (Northouse 2015). A leader has vision, sets a good personal example, is able to 
attract and retain productive employers, motivates employees to use their abilities, and 
induces them to willingly do their best. Managers derive their authority from occupying 
higher positions within the organization. Leaders, on the other hand, have the power of 
influence over people. Their power is attained by earning employees’ respect and admira-
tion (Maxwell 2015). However, some leadership skills can be learned. Engineering manag-
ers with good leadership qualities are particularly valuable to their employers.
In this chapter, specific methods for making decisions are also illustrated. These include 
the rational method, decision-making by gut instinct, and decision-making in teams. 
Furthermore, a few special topics on leadership are to be addressed, including (a) leading 
changes, (b) advice for new leaders, and (c) guidelines for superior leadership.
4.2  Styles of Leadership
There are five major styles of leadership that are classified according to the attributes of 
either a concern for people or an emphasis on tasks. These are defined as follows:
	
1.	The nice guy: Places too much value on social acceptance while neglecting techni-
cal tasks.
	
2.	The loser: Neither obtains acceptance from others nor gets the job done.
	
3.	The compromiser: Balances both the needs of people and task factors.

84
Engineering Management
	
4.	The task master: Is interested in getting the job done right without concern for 
human feelings.
	
5.	The ideal manager: Gets the job done and at the same time makes everyone happy.
Figure 4.1 illustrates these styles. The principal style of leadership exhibited by a leader 
is largely determined by his or her personal characteristics derived from traits such as 
childhood experiences, parental impact, work habits, value systems, and others (Olson 
2014).
Leadership style can also be identified as effective or ineffective, flexible or inflexible. 
Most leaders practice more than one leadership style in their daily work. Different styles 
are applicable to different people at different times (Lukiv 2015). Engineering managers 
are advised to vary their leadership styles in accordance with the needs of their employees 
(depending on whether the employees are experienced or novices) and the work situation 
at hand.
4.3  Leading Activities
The managerial function of leading includes performing specific tasks related to leading 
the engineering unit or department to achieve organizational objectives. The activities 
involved are outlined as follows (Kotter 1990):
	
1.	Deciding: Arriving at conclusions and judgments with respect to priority, per-
sonnel, resources, policies, organizational structures, and strategic directions. 
Decision-making with incomplete data is the norm, not the exception.
	
2.	Communicating: Creating understanding and resolving conflicts by talking, meet-
ing, or writing to others.
	
3.	Motivating: Inspiring, encouraging, or impelling others to take required action 
and creating workplace conditions to ensure work satisfaction. As leaders, sci-
ence, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals’ dedication toward 
the project inculcates a sense of responsibility and urgency among the rest of the 
team.

4.	Selecting people: Choosing the right employees for positions in the organization or 
for specific team activities.
	
5.	Developing people: Helping employees improve their knowledge, attitudes, and 
skills.
Some of these tasks are relatively easy, and others are more difficult. Engineering man-
agers need to practice them in order to become proficient over time in carrying out these 
activities. They also need to demonstrate the ability to conceptualize the future, iden-
tify unstoppable trends, and develop new ways to grow. Each of these activities will be 
reviewed in detail in the following sections.
4.4  Deciding
Making decisions is a key responsibility of engineering managers. Making high-quality 
decisions is the hallmark of excellent managers. The purpose of making decisions is to 
align the choices of project priorities, people, financial resources, technology, and rela-
tionships for the attainment of corporate objectives. As the engineering manager gains 
experience, the overall quality of his or her decisions is expected to increase (Health 2013; 
Krogerus and Taschaeppeler 2012).
Oftentimes, there is insufficient information available for guidance, or the future busi-
ness or market conditions are very fluid and fuzzy. Under these circumstances, man-
agers need to make spontaneous decisions based on intuition, gut instinct, and hunch. 
Obviously, if data are available, they make reasonable decisions based on systematic stud-
ies and logical analyses of them. Engineering managers are typically quite proficient in 
handling this latter type of decision-making, which follows the typical steps enumerated 
as follows:
	
1.	Assessment of facts and evaluation of alternatives
	
2.	Use of full mental resources
	
3.	Emphasis on creative aspects of problem solving
	
4.	Consistency in thinking
	
5.	Minimize the probability of errors
Management decisions are usually difficult to make for a number of reasons. They 
involve problems and issues that are ill-defined, as they are wider in scope and affect 
more people than typical technical problems and issues. The required data and infor-
mation may be insufficient or excessive, and there may be no time available to collect or 
interpret the data. The available information may be of poor quality, because it is based 
on guesswork, rumors, opinions, hunches, or hearsay. Decision-making involves human 
behavior, which is not always predictable. The nature of problems and issues changes con-
tinuously. The consequences of management decisions depend on opinions available, and 
as such, the consequences are also changing. Rarely does a perfect solution exist for man-
agement problems, since all options involve compromise, whose validity changes over 
time. Decision-making must also consider implementation, which in turn depends on the 
consensus and commitment of the affected people. Oftentimes, political considerations 

86
Engineering Management
come into play as well. A critical decision may involve multiple layers of management or 
peer departments, and thus it requires coordination.
The following is a list of several decision-making guidelines useful to engineering 
managers:
	
1.	Acquire decision-making experience, for example, by recognizing patterns and 
rules and by studying management cases.
	
2.	Prioritize problems for which decisions must be made. Do nothing with prob-
lems that are perceived to have minor significance and impact on the organiza-
tion. Avoid making decisions about issues that are not pertinent at the time. Delay 
decisions that cannot be practically implemented. Also, do not make decisions 
that ought to be made by others.
	
3.	Follow a rational process to resolve a given problem and establish options to 
remove its root causes (see Section 4.4.1). Asking good questions is also the hall-
mark of excellent leadership.
	
4.	Involve those who will be affected by the pending decisions in the decision-
making process. Group decisions (see Section 4.4.5) are superior to those made by 
individuals from the standpoint of implementation. Such decisions, however, may 
take longer time to reach, and they usually represent compromises for all involved.
	
5.	Make decisions based on available information and those assumptions that have 
been introduced. Check the validity of all assumptions and adjust the decisions 
accordingly. Take necessary risks and avoid becoming paralyzed by stress or 
uncertainty.
	
6.	Delay making decisions until the last allowable moment, as the problems and 
available options may continue to change. Above all, meeting all deadlines with a 
decision is better than having no decision.
How can we judge the quality of a given decision? A simple way to find out is to raise 
the following three questions:
	
1.	Has the decision achieved the stated purpose; has it corrected or changed the situ-
ation that caused the problem to exist in the first place?
	
2.	Is it feasible to implement the decision; is it meaningful with respect to the required 
resources and the created value?
	
3.	Does the decision generate noticeable adverse consequences or risks to the group 
or the company?
The decision at hand is regarded as good if the first two questions are answered with a 
“yes” and the last one with a “no.”
As a rule, managers are expected to make decisions. However, there are circumstances 
in which managers should delegate the decision-making authority to the staff or work 
alongside them to come to a decision.
The following are problems or issues that should be handled by the managers only: 
(1) prioritizing tasks and projects, assigning office spaces, and defining group composi-
tion; (2) handling personnel assignments, evaluating performance, and taking job action; 
(3) dispensing budget allocation; (4) applying administrative policies, procedures, and 
regulations; and (5) dealing with highly confidential business matters that are specifically 

87
Leading
designated by the top management (e.g., compensation, promotion, corporate strategies, 
and new marketing initiatives).
Managers should include their employees when making decisions on the following 
problems or issues: (1) considering staff needs for development (e.g., attending professional 
meetings, technical conferences, seminars, and training courses, as well as committing 
to study programs at universities); (2) discussing policies and procedures, involving staff 
interactions with other departments; and (3) determining team membership (e.g., consid-
ering personality fit, skills compatibility, working relationships, and balancing workload). 
Decision-making authority should be delegated to staff members for the following mat-
ters: (1) techniques to accomplish assigned tasks or projects; (2) options to continuously 
improve current operations and work processes; and (3) social events involving staff par-
ticipation, such as group picnics, golf outings, and Christmas parties.
As the saying goes, “practice makes perfect.” Engineering managers should seek oppor-
tunities to constantly acquire experience regarding when, where, and what decisions are 
to be made. How decisions can be made is deliberated in the next section.
4.4.1  Rational Decision-Making Processes
A rational decision-making process is generally useful in facilitating decision-making for 
numerous problems or issues in engineering when an adequate amount of information is 
available (Eisenfuehr et al. 2010). It consists of the following set of logical steps:
	
1.	Assess the apparent problem based on observed symptoms.
	
2.	Collect the relevant facts. Usually, not all facts are available due to resource, cost, 
or time constraints. Facts must be related to five decision-making factors:
	
a.	 Situation (what, how). The sequence of events leading to the problem and its 
conditions.
	
b.	 People (who). Personalities, preferences, personal needs, and egos.
	
c.	 Place (where). Significance of location.
	
d.	 Time (when). Pressure to bring forth an immediate solution.
	
e.	 Cause (why). Why the problem originally occurred, and why it occurred in one 
situation, but not in another.
	
Past experience indicates that there are several good sources for identifying the 
relevant facts related to the problems at hand (see Table 4.1).

3.	Define the real problem at hand and its inherent root causes by raising the 
following three questions:
	
a.	 What is the deviation between actual performance and the expected norm?
	
b.	 What are the desired measurable results in a problem-solving situation?
	
c.	 What represents success based on well-defined metrics and the proper method 
of measurements?
	
4.	Develop alternatives to address the root causes of the stated problems. Decision-
makers ought to freely invite creative suggestions from people who have direct 
knowledge of the problem at hand, brainstorm in group settings (without criti-
cisms or comments so as not to deter imaginative suggestions), and take into 
account both short-term and long-term impacts.
	
5.	Select the optimal alternative. Decision-makers need to choose among the 
options to address the root causes, such as by applying the rational method (see 
Section 4.4.2). It is important for decision-makers to ensure that the chosen alterna-
tive will produce minimum adverse consequences to the company or unit. They 
also need to plan for contingencies and make midcourse corrections, if required, 
to secure the greatest probability of achieving the desired outcome. They should 
also avoid committing to a final choice prematurely before its implementation 
becomes feasible.
	
	
A decision is nothing but the choice among several available options to solve a 
problem or address an issue. If there is only one option available, then no decision 
is needed.
	
6.	Set a course of action to implement the decision. Once a decision is made, engineer-
ing managers should devise an applicable action plan to implement the decision. The 
manager must consider such details as policies that limit possible action, programs 
(the sequence of action steps), schedules (dates and milestones), procedures (the 
action steps carried out in an orderly manner), and budgets and expenses for equip-
ment and manpower. Decisions that are not effectively implemented are useless.
4.4.2  Specific Rational Decision Analysis Tool
The Rational Decision Method is a renowned analysis tool available to support decision-
making. It prescribes the following steps (see Table 4.2) to arrive at a rational decision:
	
1.	Define a set of decision criteria needed for making the decision. The necessary 
criteria are those that must be met. For example, all entry-level engineering 
applicants must have undergraduate degrees in engineering to be considered for

employment. Some hiring companies may define a grade point average (GPA; e.g., 
3.5 out of 4.0 maximum) as the cutoff academic performance level below which an 
applicant would not be considered. The sufficiency criteria are those that are not 
necessary, but are good to have. For hiring entry-level engineers, companies may 
specify these to be summer work experience, internship activities, project work, 
leadership positions held in student organizations, and others.
	
2.	Rank order the sufficiency criteria by assigning weight factors ranging from 10 (as 
the most preferable) to 1 (as the least preferable).
	
3.	Evaluate all options against each of the options identified as necessary decision 
criteria. For example, the options that meet the necessary criteria may be desig-
nated with the word “go.”
	
4.	Remove from further consideration those options that fail the necessary criteria.
	
5.	Rank all remaining options relatively, with respect to specific sufficiency criteria. 
Assign a relative score of 10 to the most satisfactory and 1 to the least satisfactory 
option.
	
6.	Repeat this scoring process for each of the remaining sufficiency criteria.
	
7.	Compute a weighted score for each option by multiplying its relative score for 
a specific sufficiency criterion with its corresponding weight factor. Add up the 
weighted scores for all sufficiency criteria to obtain the overall weighted score for 
this option. Repeat the computation for each of the remaining options.
	
8.	Compare the overall weighted scores and choose the option with the highest over-
all weighted score.
This method forces decision-makers to externalize all necessary and sufficiency cri-
teria and to assign weight factors to all sufficiency criteria before making decisions. 
The chosen criteria must represent a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of 
criteria for the decision at hand. By ranking options against each of the defined criteria, 
all available options are properly evaluated in a rational, equitable, and comprehensive 
manner.
This method is particularly useful in a team environment where members may need-
lessly argue for specific options without externalizing their decision criteria and the rela-
tive ranking they have assigned to the criteria. Oftentimes, the advocates for a specific 
option make implicit assumptions that remain hidden and unknown to others on the 
team. In addition, personal biases may influence the relative scores assigned to the options 
when these options are evaluated against a given decision criteria. Experience has shown 
that the personal biases tend to become minimized when the relative scores are polled 
from all teammates during a meeting.
This method is also effective for decision-making on an individual basis. Some engineer-
ing managers tend to emotionally overemphasize certain decision criteria and downplay 
the importance of others. Again, having all decision criteria and their respective weight 
factors explicitly delineated will facilitate a rational decision.
Example 4.1
Bill Pickens, manager of the test division, called John Riley, the group head of 
mechanical testing, into his office and told him that there was a new opening for a 
manager of product development in the company. For John, it would be a promotion 
to a higher managerial rank with an appropriate increase in salary. However, the 

90
Engineering Management
new position is temporary, in that it may be eliminated in a year. Although Bill hates 
to lose a very valuable worker like John, he wants to let John himself make the deci-
sion. The product development division has specifically requested that this opening 
be recommended to John. After having given it some thought, John decided to take 
the new position.
The next day, Bill Pickens and John Riley sit down together again to name a group 
head successor. Among the three section heads in the group, Dodd is the most experi-
enced. However, Dodd is quiet and does not communicate well. He may have difficulty 
in selling testing services to others. Yeager is competent, but has made hasty decisions 
that have been very costly to the group. Bennett is ambitious and aggressive, but has 
poor interpersonal skills. They concluded that none could be immediately promoted to 
take over. Finally, they agreed to rotate the acting head job among the three, to test out 
each of them, since there is an outside chance that John may come back to his old posi-
tion after one year.
Shortly thereafter, Bill Pickens was promoted out. John decided not to return to take 
Bill’s position. Terry Smith was brought in to take over Bill Pickens’s job as test division 
manager. However, before Bill Pickens left, he indicated to Yeager that Yeager would 
likely get the job, based on the results of the trial periods.
Terry found significant rivalry and ill-feeling between the three section heads. The 
group had low morale and poor productivity. Under such circumstances, Terry decided 
to appoint a new employee, Dennis Brown, to the mechanical testing head position 
instead of one of the three.
Did Terry make the right decision? Apparently, the job rotation idea failed. What 
would have been the right way for Bill Pickens to handle this problem?
Answer 4.1
The decision made by Terry was not the right one. The reasons are as follows:
	
1.	 The personnel situation was created by both Bill Pickens and John Riley’s 
inability to make a staffing decision by choosing the best one among the 
three candidates and minimizing the impact of the new head’s shortcomings. 
Rotating the acting head job created chaos due to infighting. Potential infight-
ing should have been anticipated by experienced managers.
	
2.	 Terry’s decision negated an implied management promise that one of the three 
would be promoted after a one-year trial period. This broken promise could be 
the basis of a future lawsuit.
	
3.	 The appointment of a new employee, without consultation with and concur-
rence of the three section chiefs, reflects a lack of sophistication on the part of 
Terry. It raises the issue of fairness and creates an employee loyalty problem. 
The three section chiefs are not likely to be motivated to work with the new 
person.
	
4.	 It is not known if Dennis Brown has the necessary technical and managerial 
skills to be more successful than any one of the three tried candidates.
	
5.	 The likely results are as follows:
	
a.	 Lost management credibility due to broken promises and a lack of person-
nel staffing capabilities. (Riley neglected to groom a successor by correct-
ing the perceived shortcomings of his chosen successor during the last five 
years.)
	
b.	 Management is perceived to be lacking fairness in decision-making. 
(This will result in lower group morale and decreased employee loyalty. 
Employee turnover may increase as a consequence.)
The job rotation idea is a poor one. It was selected only because Pickens and Riley 
were not able to make good staffing decisions. They were looking for a perfect person, 

91
Leading
and overlooked the possibility that most of the identified shortcomings could be easily 
compensated for or corrected.
What Pickens and Riley should have done was to make a hard choice in the beginning, 
either bringing someone in from the outside or promoting one of the three employees. 
Assuming that no suitable outside candidates were available, then rational decision 
analysis should have been used to come up with a choice, as shown in Table 4.3.
At first glance, Dodd appears to be the winner. However, as the candidates’ weighted 
scores are rather close, the refinement step shown in Table 4.4 may be taken.
Adjustments are made based on the expected values of improving the relative score of 
the identified weakness from 5 to 10. The adjusted total score represents the final rank-
ing of these three individuals, after each is allowed to minimize his weaknesses. Dodd 
remains the winner in this case.
Example 4.2
Due to global competition, the company faces a tough time in the marketplace, and so 
it must scale down its workforce. The board has offered the following options for the 
employees:
	
1.	 Quit voluntarily. This could be attractive to several bright young engineers 
whom the company does not want to lose.
	
2.	 Last in and first out. This could result in the loss of young and more versatile 
operators.
	
3.	 Early retirement of those within 10 years of their normal retirement age. This could 
cause a loss of engineers with valuable product knowledge.
	
4.	 Reverse ranking in performance records. This could lead to unfair selection, as the 
uniform performance appraisal system has been operating in the company 
only for the last few years. 
What methods, or combination of methods, should the company use to reduce 
employment?

Answer 4.2
The company should use the rational decision-making method and assign weight fac-
tors to all the criteria. The relative score as displayed in Table 4.5 should be assigned to 
evaluate all options.
Based on the results obtained from Table 4.5, the method of last in and first out (Option 
2) should be chosen to reduce employment.
4.4.3  Additional Support Tools for Decision-Making
A number of spreadsheet-based tools are commercially available to engineering managers 
to support their decision-making process. Examples of such tools include
•	 Forecasting (exponential smoothing, time series, and neural network computing) 
(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013)
•	 Regression analysis (single variable and multivariable) (Chatterjee (2012)
•	 Risk analysis and project management (Fenton and Neil 2012; Yoe 2011)
•	 What-if solver (Slager 2014)
•	 Simulation modeling (Brandimarte 2014; Ross 2012)
•	 Decision trees (Rokach and Maimon 2014; DeVille and Neville 013), see the TreeAge 
2015 software by httpe://www.treeage.com
•	 Optimization (linear programming and integer and dynamic programming) 
(Belegundu 2011)
•	 Artificial intelligence and pattern recognition tools (Marwala 2014; Frankish 2014)
•	 Expert or knowledge-based systems (Giarratano and Riley 2004; Tweedale et al. 
2015)
Engineering managers should familiarize themselves with all of these decision support 
tools so that they can employ the right tools under the right circumstances (Ragsdale 2014).
Example 4.3
A certain company makes two products: P1 and P2. Each P1 requires 5 kg of material 
M and 3 kg of material N. Each P2 requires 3 kg of M and 3 kg of N. In the warehouse, 
there are 350 kg of M and 270 kg of N available. The profit is $50 for each P1 and $40 for

Constraints
Graphically, the solution method can be displayed as shown in Figure 4.2. Because of 
the four constraints, the solution space is bound by the area OABCO: O (0,0), A (90,0), 
B (40,50), and C (70,0).
As the profit line (50 × x1 + 40 × x2 = profit) moves to the right, the profit is maximized 
when it passes through the point B (40,50), the rightmost location it can take, while still 
satisfying the stated constraints. Thus, the maximum profit is $4000(=50 × 40 + 40 × 50), 
and numbers of products P1 and P2 to make and sell are 40 and 50, respectively.
The simplex method is programmed to handle linear optimization programs with n 
independent variables.
Suppose we want to know more about the impact of material constraints on the com-
pany’s profit. Let us assume that material N can be increased by 30 units, subject to the

optimum solution is then D, producing a new total profit of $4250(=50 × 25 + 40 × 75). 
This new profit is $250 over the previous total, because of added material N, which has 
a shadow price of $8.33(=$250/30).

Engineering Management
4.4.4  Decision-Making by Gut Instinct
Since, up to middle-managerial levels, decision-making is mostly quantitative, the tools 
indicated in the preceding section are useful. However, at upper- and senior-managerial 
levels, problems and issues get much more complex and ambiguous. When such circum-
stances defy systematic analyses, decision-making is typically based on intuition and gut 
instinct (Cholle 2011).
Bob Lutz, president of the Chrysler Corporation, was reported to have made the decision 
in 1988, by pure instinct while driving alone along a country road, to develop and market 
a new sports car, the Dodge Viper. This car later turned out to be a great success. Using 
interviews with several other managers as source material, Hayashi (2001) studied the 
general intuitive decision-making processes.
What is gut instinct? According to Hayashi (2001), our minds process information all the 
time. Our left brain processes conscious, rational, and logical thoughts, whereas our right 
brain takes care of subconscious, intuitive, and emotional thoughts. Some people claim 
that they can tap into right-brain thinking by jogging, daydreaming, listening to music, 
or using other meditative techniques. Others have reported that they get innovative ideas 
while taking long showers or placing themselves in unfamiliar situations.
The theory of intuitive thinking claims that accumulated past experience enables some 
people to bundle information so that they can easily store and retrieve it. Experts fur-
ther claim that such information is retrieved from memory by the observation of patterns. 
Professional judgment can often be reduced to patterns and rules. Accordingly, all other 
things being equal, people with varied and diverse backgrounds tend to be more capable 
of thinking intuitively and learning faster because they recognize more patterns. When 
using gut instinct, people essentially draw on rules and patterns that reside in their memo-
ries. Diverse backgrounds facilitate cross-indexing, allowing one to see similar patterns in 
disparate fields.
However, instincts can at times be wrong. People who make decisions intuitively are 
advised to secure constant feedback in order to minimize the impact of incorrect decisions 
and to learn from these decisions. Over time, the process of learning on the basis of feed-
back has the potential of improving the patterns and rules stored in the peoples’ memory, 
thus enabling them to make better intuitive decisions in the future (Root-Bernstein and 
Root-Bernstein 2001).
Engineering managers at low- or middle-managerial levels should keenly observe how 
top-level leaders make important decisions and reflect on such decision-making processes, 
in order to update and modify their own decision-making patterns and rules.
4.4.5  Decision-Making in Teams
Typically, individual engineering managers make decisions by using one or more of the 
methods just described (analytical, rational, or intuitive). However, engineering manag-
ers may also elect to make decisions by using the inputs generated by teams. Under such 
circumstances, additional factors come into play, such as personality clashes, conflicts of 
interest, and coalitions or alliances among the team members, which affect the resulting 
decisions. Team leaders need to pay special attention to a set of additional guidelines that 
foster better decision-making in group settings.
Silver (2013) advanced the idea that the group decision-making process must be man-
aged properly to consider social and organizational aspects. Doing so will secure the 
needed support for implementation, which ultimately determines the final impact 

95
Leading
of any decision. Three factors are important for the team leader to take into account 
when managing a group decision-making process, namely, conflict, consideration, and 
closure.
Group decision-making requires a set of leadership talents that are somewhat different 
from those demanded in other situations. These include (a) active solicitation of divergent 
viewpoints, (b) acceptance of ambiguity, (c) the wisdom to end a debate, (d) the ability to 
convince people of the merits of the decision made, and (e) the ability to maintain bal-
ance to embrace divergence and unity—divergence in opinion during the debate and the 
required unity of participants needed to implement the decision.
Engineering managers are encouraged to follow the preceding guidelines when manag-
ing team decision-making processes.
4.5  Communicating
The purpose of communicating is to create understanding and acceptance of the facts, 
impressions, and feelings being communicated. When communicating, engineering man-
agers must have a clear purpose in mind and ensure that the message is understood and 
retained. A proper form of communication needs to be selected, such as a one-on-one 
meeting, phone conversation, written memo, staff meeting, e-mail, videoconference, web 
posting, or net meeting. It is advisable for the engineering managers to keep the commu-
nications channels open. They should be straightforward and honest, respect confidential 
information, welcome suggestions, anticipate resistance to changes, and dispel fears by 
disclosing full information (Adler et al. 2012).
There are five key actions to take to achieve efficacious communication: asking, telling, 
listening, writing, and understanding. These actions will be discussed next.
4.5.1  Asking
Engineering managers should proactively request information and not wait to be told. A 
lack of information can prevent understanding. Open-ended questions—those that cannot 
be answered with “yes” or “no”—should be raised to gain new knowledge. Voltaire said, 
“Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.” Good insights come from asking 
good questions. Great creative thinkers ask more questions. One needs to dig deeper and 
deeper until magic insights reveal themselves. Asking questions is to unpeel the layers 
of packaging to get to the real heart of the matter by repeating why, how, where, when, 
who, what, what if, and what else. The quality of the questions represents a gauge of the 
questioner’s background, education, and depth of understanding of the issues involved 
(Palmer 2014; Sobel and Panas 2012; Marquardt 2014).
4.5.2  Telling
Telling means transmitting information (verbally or in written form, or both) for managers 
to keep employees informed about matters of concern to them, for employees to inform 
managers about problems and pertinent development (e.g., to avoid surprises that would 
trigger spontaneous and low-quality decisions), and for workers to pass information to 
their peers.

96
Engineering Management
Engineering managers need to exercise judgment as to what to tell and what not to tell, 
as too much information could lead to overload and confusion and too little information 
could cause employee mistrust and poor productivity. A typical rule of thumb used in 
industry is that information is dispersed based on the need to know. Managers will share 
information freely if it is needed for performing specific work or has an impact on the 
individual’s work environment (Walsh 2014).
4.5.3  Listening
Engineering managers need to work on their listening skills to enhance their understand-
ing of both the words (spoken and written) and any possible subtext. Woodrow Wilson 
said, “The ears of the leader ring with the voices of the people.” They should maintain their 
concentration by exercising self-discipline and rigorous control of their own urge to talk 
and interrupt (Alstine 2014; Ferrari 2012; Hartley 2014).
4.5.4  Writing
Written communications need to be concise (using the least number of words to express 
the maximum number of concepts), logical (allowing easy comprehension), and pertinent 
(focusing on the impact on the business purpose at hand). Check the writing advice 
offered by Felden (1964) with respect to readability, correctness, appropriateness, and 
thought. HBS Press (2003) offers seven principles of good writing: (1) having a clear pur-
pose, (2) being audience-focused, (3) stating key message clearly, (4) staying on topic, (5) 
observing economy of words, (6) using simple sentences, and (7) considering the right 
delivery strategy. Consult the books by Strunk (2015) and Hacker and Sommers (2014) 
with respect to style.
4.5.5  Understanding
The ultimate goal of communication is to promote understanding—to hear with the head 
and to feel with the heart. Engineering managers need to recognize shared meaning (emo-
tional and logical) and to assess the degree of sincerity by observing body language, into-
nation, and facial expression (Adler et al. 2013).
Several communication barriers exist and these barriers should be taken into account by 
engineering managers:
	
1.	Interpretations of words and terms: Words are symbols or semantic labels applied 
to things or concepts. The same words may have different meanings to different 
people.
	
2.	Selective seeing: Some people have the tendency to see only what they want to 
see and remain blind to other information unfavorable to the position they 
take.
	
3.	Selective listening: Some people hear only what they want to hear by screening 
out information that may seem threatening to them, thus limiting their abil-
ity to appreciate different perspectives and points of view. Others in conflicts 
may want to understand only that which allows them to pursue their own 
self-interest.

97
Leading
	
4.	Emotional barriers: All people have emotions. Engineering managers need to appre-
ciate the fact that people’s feelings are as important as their intellectual knowl-
edge. Sometimes, people’s attitudes and feelings may be so strong that they impair 
their understanding of what is being conveyed. Generally, personal biases will 
distort the understanding of what is being communicated.
The barriers just cited may cause the communications process to fail in creating the 
desired degree of understanding. Experience has shown that appeals to emotion tend to 
be understood and accepted much more readily than appeals to reason, analysis, or cold 
logic.
To communicate efficaciously, engineering managers are advised to pay attention to the 
following guidelines:
	
1.	Know what to say and say what is meant: Engineering managers should focus on 
key messages when communicating. Avoid noise or meaningless sounds, point-
less statements, and inconclusive remarks often used by people to impress others, 
but not to express themselves. Examples of such noise include “The answer is 
definitely a maybe” and “It is not probable, but still possible.”
	
2.	Understand the audience: Engineering managers should tailor their communication 
to the receiver’s frame of reference—their beliefs, concerns from the job, back-
ground and training, attitudes, experience, and vocabulary.
	
3.	Secure attention: Engineering managers should try to appeal to the receiver’s inter-
ests; anticipate and overcome emotional objections (fear, distrust, and suspicion); 
talk in the receiver’s terms; and lead from the present to the future, the familiar to 
the unknown, and the agreeable to the disagreeable.
	
4.	Obtain understanding: An effective communication technique is to start with 
agreements and the statement of facts (not conclusions), use simple words (not 
ponderous, confusing, or abstract terms), and communicate in bursts (avoiding 
information overflow and knowledge digestion problems).
	
5.	Ensure retention: The rule of four states the following: (1) Before trying to get 
an idea across, tell your receivers what you are going to say. (2) Say what you 
have to say. (3) Tell them what you said. (4) Get them to tell you what they have 
understood.
	
	
Obviously, engineering managers must practice such a rule tactfully when the 
receiver happens to be a senior manager of the company, instead of a young intern 
engineer who may have just recently started to work.
	
6.	Receive feedback: Engineering managers need to proactively pose questions and 
learn to listen in order to get feedback from what was communicated.
	
7.	Get action to enhance communications: Engineering managers should have the 
receivers take action on the just-completed communication as a way of securing its 
impact. This could be in the form of a commitment by the receivers to take specific 
steps by agreed-on dates.
	
	
Creating understanding is what communication is all about. Engineering man-
agers need to practice asking insightful questions, conveying messages clearly, 
and listening attentively so that understanding is created at each and every com-
munication endeavor.

Engineering Management
Example 4.4
The company decided to move its engineering center to another location, since it was 
running out of space. The new location was to be modern and had been planned as a 
showpiece for the company. Management felt certain that the employees would wel-
come the move. Negotiations were started with several local governmental authorities 
for suitable accommodation.
To keep the workforce fully informed, it was agreed that the employees would be told 
that a move was to be made, but that as yet no site had been chosen.
This communication led to wide speculation among the engineering professionals as 
to the location of the new site, and various rumors circulated. Some engineers with fam-
ilies decided to look for alternative employment elsewhere, fearing that the new loca-
tion would not be within commuting distance. Morale fell and productivity suffered.
Negotiations took longer than anticipated, and no suitable location had been found 
after six months. By then, morale was so low that the company decided to abandon its 
relocation plan altogether. To overcome the space problem, the company split the engi-
neering group by putting a smaller team into another factory site nearby.
What went wrong? How would you have handled this case differently?
Answer 4.4
To communicate or not to communicate—that was the question. A well-intended, but 
premature relocation announcement induced anxiety in the minds of affected engi-
neers. A lack of progress in site negotiations compounded these anxieties, causing low 
morale and decreased productivity, leading to an eventual abandonment of the plan.
It would have been better for the company management to keep the plan secret initially, 
negotiate for and decide on a specific site, and then have the company president announce 
the relocation plan in a town meeting. The announcement should have included:
	
1.	 The location of the new site, with emphasis on the advantages in transporta-
tion, health care, weather, and historical, cultural, and recreational attractions.
	
2.	 A request for the support of all engineers in making the relocation as smooth 
as possible. The purpose of the relocation is to provide a better facility for 
everyone. The company is investing x million dollars to support this move, 
which will allow for possible expansion in the near future.
	
3.	 The date by which relocation is to be completed.
	
4.	 A delineation of the company’s plans to fund all relocation costs and offer assis-
tance in selling and buying homes, if the relocation is more than 100 miles away. 
The company will also assist the affected spouses to find jobs at the new site.
	
5.	 The description of a human resources desk that will be set up to answer spe-
cific questions.
Example 4.5
Your department is going to institute a major change. Some members have indicated 
that they believe the change may be needed. However, in the past, members of the 
department have tended to resist changes that they did not initiate. The department 
as a whole has a good performance record. Discuss the advantages of the following 
alternatives:
	
1.	 Permit the members of the department to determine if the change is needed.
	
2.	 Let the group make recommendations, but see that your objectives are 
adhered to.

99

3.	 After the group discussion, adjust the goals, if possible, and monitor perfor-

Which do you think is most appropriate? Are there other strategies that are more 
appropriate?
Answer 4.5
People resist changes unless they are convinced that the contemplated changes are nec-
essary. They tolerate changes better if the changes are introduced gradually and they 
have had some say in making the changes.
Out of the three alternatives given, (2) is the most appropriate. Management must 
state clearly the objectives of the planned changes and how the attainment of objectives 
is to be measured. The members of the department should be allowed to participate in 
deciding how to achieve the stated objectives.
Company management must set the goals, which are not negotiable. Members of the 
department are not to be empowered to decide if changes are needed or not. Although 
the department has a good performance record, change may still be needed for achiev-
ing significantly better performance in view of the competition in the marketplace. 
Thus, alternative (1) is not appropriate.
The goals of the department should not be adjusted on the basis of what members of 
the department would like to do. Performance monitoring is a valid approach to ensure 
that the stated objectives are met. Thus, alternative (3) is also not appropriate.
In general, staff participation is useful to ensure active implementation of the decision 
made. Thus, a combination of alternatives (2) and (3) may be proper. Management speci-
fies the objectives of the changes and the ways the attainment of these objectives are to 
be measured. Members of the department are encouraged to make recommendations 
regarding the best ways to implement the changes. The actions taken by the department 
are to be monitored constantly to make sure that the stated objectives are met, even if 
only gradually.
4.6  Motivating
The engineering manager secures results by motivating people. Examples of motivators 
include opportunities to do challenging, interesting, and important work; exercising lead-
ership and position power; and gaining prestige and recognition. To motivate is to apply a 
force that excites and drives an individual to act in preferred ways. In general, emphasis is 
given to motivational forces that cause the individuals to willingly apply their best efforts 
(Bruce 2011: Stratheford 2012). As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Nothing great was ever 
accomplished without enthusiasm.”
It is advisable for engineering managers to accept differences in personal preferences, 
values, and standards, and not try to change people. According to one theory, personality 
traits are usually firmed up at the early ages of four or five by environmental conditions. 
Managers should also recognize that every employee has inherent drives to fulfill their 
own needs, such as self-actualization, recognition, ego, self-esteem, group association, and 
financial goals (Tracy 2013).

Engineering Management
4.6.1  Methods of Motivation
In general, engineering managers have several methods of motivation at their disposal 
(Mauer 2015):
	
1.	Inspire: Infuse a spirit of willingness into people to perform most effectually by 
way of their own personality and leadership qualities, personal examples, and 
work completed.
	
2.	Encourage: Stimulate people to do what has to be done through praise, approval, 
and help.
	
3.	Impel: Force and incite action by any necessary means, including compulsion, 
coercion, fear, and, if required, punishments (such as demotion, job suspension, or 
termination).
The first two methods are well suited to motivate professionals, and the last one is not. 
Being assigned challenging work is a useful motivator for professionals.
4.6.2  Specific Techniques to Enhance Motivation
Engineering managers may implement the techniques outlined here to inspire and encour-
age professionals to act (Newman 2015).
	
1.	Participation: Invite employees to take part in setting objectives and making deci-
sions. Doing so will ensure emotional ownership and the utilization of specialized 
knowledge. Participative management is known to have a positive motivational 
impact on employees.
	
2.	Communication: Set clear standards, relate the importance of the work, keep expec-
tations reasonable, and respond to suggestions offered by employees.
	
3.	Recognition: Give credit where it is due, as sincere praise tends to promote further 
commitment. Fair appraisals induce employee loyalty and trust.
	
4.	Delegate authority: Trust the employees and do not overcontrol them. Achievers 
will seek additional responsibilities, and security seekers will not. Delegate what 
to do and leave how to do it to the individuals. Delegate technically doable work 
only to those who want it.
	
5.	Reciprocate interest: Show interest in the desired results to motivate employees to 
achieve these results.
4.6.3  Innovative Strategies of Worker Motivation
Confucius says, “Reciprocity is the foundation of human relations.” One very forceful 
method of employee motivation is indeed to offer help needed by the employees, who will 
surely be inclined to reciprocate. The key is to define such needs.
The innovative strategies advanced by Green (2013) are built on the known assumptions 
that a person’s needs may be grouped into hierarchical levels, as follows:
	
1.	Physiological needs: Hunger, thirst, and the need for clothing and shelter.
	
2.	Safety: Protection from threats and danger.

101
Leading
	
3.	Social: Giving and receiving affection, group membership, and acceptance by 
peers.
	
4.	Esteem: Ego and self-confidence to achieve recognition.
	
5.	Self-actualization: Continued self-development and realization of one’s own 
potential.
A satisfied need no longer dominates the individual’s behavior, and the next higher-
level need takes over. But a higher-level need only arises when lower ones are already 
satisfied. The central premise of the model is that an unsatisfied need acts as a motiva-
tor. Accordingly, a need-based motivation strategy suggests that engineering managers 
should learn to understand the specific needs of their professionals at any given time and 
find ways to help satisfy these needs.
Experience has shown that the motivation strategies presented here can be helpful in 
motivating professionals who typically have high-level needs related to self-actualization 
and esteem.
	
1.	Present a variety of work assignments perceived to be desirable and that offer the 
opportunity for personal growth.
	
2.	Offer work that has a scope broad enough for the employee to develop self-expres-
sion and individual creativity.
	
3.	Manage with minimum supervision and control, as professionals favor indepen-
dence and individuality. Professionals tend to prefer having the freedom to make 
their own decisions and choose their own work methods for achieving the stated 
objectives.
	
4.	Provide work that fully utilizes the individual’s professional experience, skills, 
and knowledge.
	
5.	Assign work that enables the employee to receive credit and peers’ recognition. 
Examples include teamwork, publication of technical articles, patents, company 
awards, and activities in professional and technical societies.
On the other hand, pay and benefits have only a minor impact, as physiological needs do 
not represent a motivator for most professionals. Because the higher-level needs are never 
completely satisfied, engineering managers have ample opportunities to motivate profes-
sionals to act with their best abilities in achieving the corporate objectives.
Example 4.6
Company X recently installed an incentive system in the production department. Each 
person receives incentive payments (in addition to hourly wages) for any work done 
beyond the work standards established for each job. After one month, the production 
manager noted that there was only a meager increase of 4.5% in production. In your 
opinion, what might be the reasons for such a poor outcome?
Answer 4.6
The incentive program appears to have failed in realizing the projected benefit. This 
could be due to several reasons:
	
1.	 The incentive offered may be too small relative to the base hourly wage that 
these workers have been earning all along.

102
Engineering Management
	
2.	 Management may have made the mistake of not having consulted with work-
ers to understand their specific hierarchy of needs. Additional pay may not 
be a strong motivator to them in comparison with other nonmonetary factors, 
such as peer recognition, self-expression, social acceptance among peers, and 
others. It is known that team participation (such as a quality circle) has been a 
strong motivating factor for many production workers in the automobile and 
other industries.
	
3.	 If the production workers are unionized, the union leadership may have played 
a role in discouraging workers to compete against each other for pennies.
It would be worthwhile for the production manager to set the target for desirable 
productivity improvement at, for example, 10%, over the next 12–18 months. Then, the 
production managers should form a team that is empowered to develop recommen-
dations regarding the specific ways to achieve the stated improvement goals in pro-
ductivity. The team should be made up of workers on the plant floor, union leaders, 
production engineers, and others who have direct knowledge of the production process 
involved. By having participated in such teamwork, workers on the plant floor become 
part-owners of the resulting action plan. The resulting plan is more likely to be success-
fully implemented. 
4.7  Selecting Engineering Employees
The long-term success of an engineering enterprise depends on the availability and 
effective utilization of employees’ abilities, skills, and talents. It is equally important 
to note that job satisfaction is known to have a profound impact on employees’ will-
ingness to apply their skills to the best of their abilities (Arthur 2012; Farr and Tippins 
2010).
Through employee selection, company managers have some control over employees’ 
abilities, their willingness to apply their best efforts, and the extent of their job satisfac-
tion. All companies would favor hiring employees who are productive and happy workers 
in corporate settings, firmly dedicated to their tasks, have excellent interpersonal skills, 
possess the team player mentality, receive sound basic training, and exhibit the capability 
to learn new things quickly.
4.7.1  Selection Process
Typically, the employee selection process includes the following steps:
	
1.	Define needs: Specify the needs of the new positions by taking into account the 
immediate requirements and long-term growth demands of the organization.
	
2.	Specify jobs: Compose a job description for each of the open positions to define the 
roles and responsibilities of the position holders, the position grade levels, and the 
minimum qualifications of the ideal candidates (i.e., levels of basic training and 
work experience).
	
3.	Acquire applicants: Publicize job openings in newspapers, professional publications, 
company websites, employment agencies, social media, and Internet job sites to 
solicit candidates.

103
Leading
	
4.	Review and prescreen: Select applicants by matching personal objectives with com-
pany goals and check documents and references carefully.
	
	
For entry-level candidates who are recent college graduates with no profes-
sional experience, many industrial employers place a significant amount of weight 
on their GPA. Some companies have even specified a minimum GPA level as a 
prescreen criterion. This overemphasis on the GPA is probably due partially to an 
ignorance of better, more objective criteria than the GPA in assessing the mastery 
of basic course subjects. This overemphasis is also due to the notion that the GPA 
is a composite reflection of the level of personal responsibility and dedication, as 
demonstrated by an individual in doing his or her principal job of learning during 
college years.
	
5.	Conduct interviews: Each applicant may be interviewed by several hiring manag-
ers. The basis of assessment is typically studying the past to predict the future. The 
quality of past work is a very good predictor for the future, as people are known 
not to change significantly for the better overnight. A few useful guidelines are 
enumerated here.
	
a.	 Ask about the candidate’s capabilities pertaining to the new position.
	
b.	 Listen carefully to what the candidate says during the interview. Avoid spend-
ing too much time selling the job opportunity to the candidate.
	
c.	 Prompt the candidate to describe his or her last job. Be cautious of candidates 
who speak negatively about their past employers.
	
	
For example, a recent college graduate may complain loudly about his or her 
research-centered alma mater’s negligence in undergraduate teaching and use it 
as a reason for the individual’s poor GPA records. This individual may be likely 
to behave as a blame-shifting, finger-pointing, and irresponsible individual in a 
professional environment.
	
d.	 Suggest that candidates tell you something negative that you should know 
about them. Look for honesty. Determine if the candidate is aware of his or her 
personal flaws, and what active steps have been taken to correct them.
	
e.	 Urge the candidates to explain what they would do if they got in over their 
heads at work. An employee who turns to a colleague is a team player. An 
employee who turns to a supervisor behaves like a child. An employee who 
isolates himself or herself when in trouble can be extremely damaging to the 
business.
	
f.	 Ask for specific examples that demonstrate the candidate’s capabilities in cre-
ativity, innovation, and general leadership.
	
g.	 Encourage candidates to describe their aspirations. Ask, “Where do you see 
yourself in five years?” or “What are your future goals?” Companies need 
employees who can grow and evolve over time. A candidate who does not 
have goals or ambitions may resist learning new skills or taking on additional 
responsibilities.
	
6.	Decide on job candidates: Match the candidate’s personality, technical capabilities, 
work ethics, values, and other qualities with those of the company. 
Generally speaking, the selection process just described, which is widely practiced in 
industry, has not always yielded desirable results for employers (Murphy 2011). Typically, 

104
Engineering Management
four to five hiring managers may interview an engineering applicant during a one-day 
site visit. For employers, the easy part is to assess the candidate’s technical capabilities, as 
such capabilities are readily supported by documents (e.g., academic records, internship 
reports, thesis, publications, and reference letters from professors and company execu-
tives). The more difficult part is the assessment of the individual’s soft skills, as discussed 
in the next subsection.
4.7.2  Soft Skills
Any employee’s future success in an industrial enterprise is known to be strongly affected 
by their soft skills in teamwork, interpersonal relationships, leadership quality, collabora-
tive attitude, mental flexibility, and adaptability. These soft skills are linked to the engi-
neers’ personality traits, psychological profiles, value systems, and deep-rooted beliefs. 
However, companies generally do not require candidates to undergo specific psychologi-
cal tests, and most interviewers are not trained to assess candidates for soft skills (Gillins 
2015; Wentz 2012).
Part of the difficulty in assessing the soft skills of engineers is brought about by the engi-
neers themselves. Nowadays, most engineers, armed with the knowledge of interviewing 
guides, know quite well how to “talk the talk and walk the walk” in interviews. They have 
polished responses to almost any type of questions in interviews and are thus proficient in 
displaying the characteristics they believe many employers are looking for.
Results in the literature have indicated over and over again that most professionals who 
failed in industry—those who have been laid off or voluntarily quit due to personal dis-
satisfaction—were deficient in soft skills, not in technical capabilities. Future hiring man-
agers need to learn more about how to assess the soft skills of candidates.
Some companies have devoted significant efforts to address this issue. Shown here 
are industrial practices that describe what two progressive companies (Mazda Motor 
Manufacturing Corporation (USA), Flat Rock, Michigan, and Diamond Star Motors 
Corporation, Normal, Illinois) have done to assess the soft skills of their candidates and 
the selection criteria they used when selecting these blue-collar workers (Hampton 1988).
	
1.	Interpersonal skills: Ability to get along with people.
	
2.	Aptitude for teamwork: Team dedication and participation, focus on the impact on 
the team and company instead of individual performance.
	
3.	Flexibility: Learn several jobs, change shifts, and work overtime.
	
4.	Drive to improve continuously: Make and take constructive criticism.
The basic strategy followed by these companies is to pick the best employees and train them 
well. It is noteworthy that “best” is defined by the soft skills of the candidates, not by their 
hard (technical) skills. These companies are known to have selected 1,300 candidates out 
of 10,000 applicants at a cost of $13,000 per person, using a multiphase process involving 
tests, exercises, and role-playing in group activities.
4.7.3  Character
In the last few years, the general public has found a renewed interest in business ethics, 
mainly sparked by reported questionable practices by companies such as Enron, Global 
Crossing, Adelphia Cable, Arthur Andersen, and others. Chapter  11 provides detailed 

105
Leading
discussions of various ethical issues. However, it is proper to note here that it serves com-
panies better in the long run to hire employees with character and then train them to 
acquire the requisite technical skills to become productive (London 2013; Brooks 2015).
4.8  Developing People
Developing employees is another important activity of the managerial leader (Noe 2012). 
The objective of developing employees is to shape their knowledge, attitudes, and skills in 
order to enhance their contributions to the company and to foster their personal growth. 
Knowledge is the cognizance of facts, truths, and other information. Attitudes are habitual 
personal dispositions toward people, things, situations, and information. Skills are the 
abilities to perform specialized work with recognized competence.
In well-organized companies, managers are evaluated on the basis of several perfor-
mance metrics, including how they have taken care of the development needs of their 
employees. To be successful, employees must demonstrate initiative in seeking to continu-
ously improve their own knowledge, attitudes, and skills.
4.8.1  Employees
There are several ways in which managers may help develop employees. Employees 
may be prompted to follow the managers’ personal examples of continuous improve-
ment in knowledge, attitude, and skills. Managers may coach inexperienced employees 
on the job by demonstrating preferred ways of performing specific tasks. In addition, 
managers could enrich employees’ work experience by institutionalizing a job rota-
tion. If the company’s budget and policy so allow, the specific employees may be sent 
to attend professional meetings, technical conferences, training seminars, and study 
programs at universities. Furthermore, team assignments may be used to permit a bet-
ter utilization of the employees’ talents and expertise to other critical projects, while 
offering them an opportunity to become known to a larger circle of peers within the 
company (Yukl 2012).
In training employees, managers need to emphasize employee participation, as the goal 
is to satisfy the employee’s needs while simultaneously attaining the company’s objec-
tives. Employees should be appraised with respect to their present performance in deter-
mining what steps might be needed to qualify them to make greater contributions in the 
future. If the employee’s current performance is deemed to be inadequate, managers need 
to be positive and forward looking in helping the individual recognize the need for self-
improvement. By setting a personal example of continuous improvement, the manager is 
likely to positively motivate the individual to seek further development.
4.8.2  Successors
Besides training employees, managers are also expected, as a part of their managerial 
duties, to find suitable candidates within their organizations to succeed themselves some-
time in the future (Ward and Aronoff 2010). This is consistent with career planning pro-
grams that some industrial companies are actively implementing to promote leaders from 
within, discourage turnover, and maintain corporate continuity.

Engineering Management
4.9  Special Topics on Leading
Corporate change needs strong leadership. Leaders promoted into new positions will need 
to apply special strategies to succeed. Successful leaders share certain common attributes. 
The next subsection discusses the special topics related to the managerial function of 
leading.
4.9.1  Leading Changes
In twenty-first-century global economies, company-internal changes occur frequently and 
often in reaction to changes in the external environment. Changes are typically forced on 
companies by the market entry of new competitors, the declining market share position of 
the company, the emergence of new technologies threatening the company’s products or 
services, declining company performance in different regional markets, (e.g., sales, gross 
margin, earnings, and net profits), shifting in customers’ preferences, and other factors 
(Laurence 2014; Anderson 2013; Shea 2013).
Changes will usually require the company to modify its ways of conducting business. 
In general, changes are difficult to introduce because people like to stay in their comfort 
zones. After changes are introduced, they need to be sustained beyond a transformational 
period. Corporate changes demand strong leadership. According to Kotter (2012), there are 
two reasons why many transformation efforts fail:
	
1.	Large-scale corporate transformation takes time. In one specific example, the 
maximum number of changes in a corporation was reached in the fifth year of 
transformation (Shannon 1980). Leaders must be patient in marshaling corporate 
resources to push forward (Figure 4.3).
	
2.	Corporate transformation must follow a process of eight consecutive steps to suc-
ceed. Every one of these eight steps is critical, as failure in any one will affect the 
overall transformation performance.

107
Leading
The process of eight consecutive steps delineates essentially the success factors for trans-
formational change. These eight steps are
	
1.	Establish a sense of urgency: Leaders must examine the market and competitive 
realities and identify and talk about crises, potential crises, or major opportunities 
available in the global market. The goal is to convince at least 75% of the manage-
ment that remaining in the status quo is more dangerous to the health of the cor-
poration than launching in a new corporate direction.
	
2.	Form a powerful guiding coalition: Major renewal programs often start with one or 
two people. But a leadership coalition must grow over time. In addition to the top 
leaders, there should be another 5 to 50 people committed to renewal. The group 
must be powerful in terms of titles, reputations, and relationships. Only when 
there are enough leaders in the senior ranks will the renewal process move for-
ward. Leaders should inspire the group to work together as a team. The specific 
goal is to secure shared commitment to change by the top management and by the 
most influential people. A line position holder must lead the coalition.
	
3.	Create a vision: A coherent and sensible vision is needed to help direct the effort 
to change. Leaders need to develop strategies to achieve that vision. The vision 
should be easy to communicate to stockholders, employees, and customers. 
Ideally, it should be explainable to an audience within five minutes and achieve 
their understanding and acceptance.
	
4.	Communicate the vision: Transformation needs a lot of people to make it happen. 
Employees need to be persuaded and motivated to help make the changes. The 
vision needs to be repeated whenever there are opportunities—through news-
letters, review meetings, training seminars, company picnics, and other means. 
Leaders should use every channel possible to communicate the new visions and 
strategies, teach new behavior by the example of the guiding coalition, and “walk 
the talk,” as communication occurs in both words and deeds.
	
5.	Empower others to act on the vision: Leaders need to do away with obstacles to 
change, modify systems or structures that seriously undermine the vision, and 
promote risk-taking and nontraditional ideas, activities, and actions. Examples of 
obstacles to remove include structure (narrow job categories), compensation and 
appraisal systems, and managers who refuse to change.
	
6.	Plan for producing short-term wins: Leaders need to plan for visible performance 
improvements, create these improvements, recognize and reward employees 
involved in the improvements, and achieve at least some success within the first 
one to two years. Otherwise, the renewal effort may lose momentum.
	
7.	Consolidate improvements and procreate still more change: Leaders need to use 
increased credibility to change systems, structures, and policies that do not fit the 
vision; hire, promote, or develop employees who can implement the vision; and 
reinvigorate the process with new projects, themes, and change agents.
	
	
Leaders should resist declaring victory too early to avoid killing the momentum.
	
8.	Institutionalize new approaches: Leaders should articulate the connections between 
new behaviors and corporate success, establish the means to ensure leadership 
development and succession, and anchor the changes in company culture (values, 
behaviors, and social norms) so that the changes continue into the next generation 
of top management.

108
Engineering Management
The eight-step process just described is recommended for top-level engineering 
leaders who are planning to initiate and implement major corporate transformational 
changes. With minor modifications, this process applies also to midlevel engineer-
ing managers who may be called on to change the performance of a division or a 
department.
4.9.2  Advice for Newly Promoted Leaders
If a new engineering manager is hired from outside to take over a department or division, 
he or she might need to follow a special strategy during the transition period (e.g., the first 
six months on the job) in order to be productive. This is because going into an unfamiliar 
situation is akin to sailing in dense fog and only having forward visibility for a short dis-
tance (Bradt and Davis 2014).
New leaders often make a number of common mistakes. These mistakes include being 
isolated, having “the answer,” not strengthening the team, attempting too much, trusting 
the wrong people, and setting unrealistic expectations (Belker et al. 2012). In order for an 
engineering manager to become effective in a new organization, Watkins (2003) offers spe-
cific advice consisting of seven rules, namely, leverage time before entry, organize to learn, 
secure early wins, lay a foundation for major improvements, create a personal vision, build 
winning coalitions, and manage oneself.
For newly promoted engineering managers, the leadership strategy just outlined serves 
as a useful guiding light during the initial six-month period of sailing through dense fog. 
Although the aforementioned recommended steps cover all important aspects of a new 
leadership job—technical, cultural, political, and personal—individual engineering man-
agers may need to further customize these steps to fit their personal style, organizational 
needs, and the people involved in a given situation.
4.9.3  Guidelines for Superior Leadership
To become superior leaders, engineering managers are advised to focus on the following 
eight attributes, according to Cohen (2002):
	
1.	Maintain absolute integrity: Any doubt about the leader’s integrity will be reflected 
in the trust that others place in the leader.
	
2.	Be knowledgeable: The leader should be technically excellent at what it takes to get 
the job done.
	
3.	Declare expectations: The leader should let people know which work to perform and 
what results are expected.
	
4.	Display unwavering commitment: The leader must demonstrate his or her clear 
commitment.
	
5.	Get out in front: The leader needs to build, establish, and maintain a strong posi-
tive image. The leader should get out of the office to see what is going on (e.g., at 
the plant floor, marketplace, customer service center, and technology laboratories). 
The leader should also get out in front of the group to be seen, so that others know 
their manager is committed.
	
	
General MacArthur gave this advice to a young battalion commander during 
World War II: “Major, when the signal comes to go over the top, if you go first, 

109
Leading
before your men, your battalion will follow you. Moreover, they will never doubt 
your leadership or courage in the future.”
	
6.	Expect positive results: Show self-confidence and work to get favorable results.
	
7.	Take care of people: This is the basic reciprocity doctrine of Confucius: “If you take 
care of people, people will take care of you.” Starbucks is said to practice this 
doctrine by taking care of their employees first (e.g., financially supporting their 
college education), then customers, and finally shareholders.
	
8.	Put duty before self-interests: The mission and the employees must be more impor-
tant than one’s own self-interests. 
The preceding list of attributes neglects to include the all-important quality of strategic 
thinking and the leader’s capability to create vision. Without vision, a person with the 
aforementioned attributes is merely a hardworking taskmaster who is responsible, goal 
oriented, and socially assertive.
4.10  Conclusion
Leading is another key function of engineering management. It encompasses the specific 
managerial activities of making decisions and selecting, developing, motivating, and com-
municating with people. Carrying out these specific activities well will make an engineer 
into a strong engineering manager.
Decision-making plays an important role in the career of an engineering manager. In the 
engineering community, the rational decision-making method is regarded as a standard. 
Engineering managers need to become familiar with a number of other decision support 
tools so that the right tool can be fittingly applied to specific circumstances.
This chapter offered guidelines for engineering managers to become better prepared for 
the special cases of (1) introducing major corporate changes, (2) working as a new leader in 
an engineering management environment, and (3) achieving superior leadership.
Engineering managers are encouraged to practice various guidelines associated with 
leadership whenever they find opportunities to do so.
QUESTIONS
	
1.	Preparation of the company product that was promised to a major customer is 
running late, and there is intense pressure on the production team to deliver the 
product. The director of production is eventually told by the company president to 
deliver, “or else.” The director therefore decides to ship the product, even though 
it had not gone through all of its testing procedures. Members of the production 
team become upset due to their uncertainty about the functionality and reliability 
of the shipped product. The director, however, insists that “We will just have to 
take that chance.”
	
	
As the director of production, how would you have acted differently?
	
2.	As advised by the company president, the sales department received a set of spe-
cific recommendations provided by an outside management firm to reorganize for 
maximum effectiveness. The sales manager believes that a few of the sales staff 

110
Engineering Management
may disagree with the recommended changes. The sales manager herself is also 
not fully convinced of the merits of all of the recommendations, but she wants to 
implement them, at least in part.
	
	
How should she proceed?
	
3.	The engineering director of the company is called on to send one engineer abroad 
to assist in the installation of equipment. There are three qualified candidates, 
each working for a different manager under the director. The director knows that 
all three engineers will want to go, but their superiors will oppose any of them 
going for fear of losing time in completing their own critical projects. How should 
the director make the choice?
	
4.	The marketing department needed to submit a proposal to a global customer, and 
it called a review meeting the next morning. By the time Bill Taylor, the design 
manager, was informed in the late afternoon, all of his design staff had left for 
the day and there was no one available. Bill Taylor decided to work on the pro-
posal himself through the night so that he could talk with his design staff the next 
morning, one hour before the marketing review meeting.
	
	
All of the staff agreed with the proposed design except Henry King, a senior 
staff member who is recognized as the most experienced and best designer in 
the group. His objections were that the current design was too complex and 
that it would take another week to modify the design to ensure its functional 
performance.
	
	
In order to pacify him, Bill Taylor invited Henry King to come along to the mar-
keting review meeting so that Henry King would feel the pressure that market-
ing was exerting on design. Unexpectedly, Henry King stood up at the marketing 
review meeting and reiterated all of his design objections, causing tremendous 
embarrassment to Bill Taylor and his superior, Stanley Clark, the design director. 
Bill Taylor became furious.
	
	
What should Bill Taylor and Stanley Clark do?
	
5.	Jerry Lucas is the division director. As branch chief, Bob Sanford reports to Jerry 
Lucas. Bob Sanford has four section chiefs reporting to him.
	
	
Bob Sanford is technically competent, with extensive experience in solid rocket 
propulsion; he is also regarded as the best expert in this field. He is highly dedi-
cated to his work, but inexperienced in managing technical people, as he has been 
on the job for only two years. Bob Sanford handles his subordinates quite roughly. 
He reverses his section chiefs’ decisions without prior consultation with them. He 
demands that no information or data be transmitted to persons outside the group 
without his knowledge and concurrence. He also bypasses his section chiefs to go 
to people and encourages them to come to him directly with problems. Rumors 
have it that he places spies or informants within the group. As expected, he del-
egates no decision-making authority to his section chiefs and regards all of his 
section chiefs as technically incompetent. He creates an atmosphere of fear and 
suspicion, with low group morale.
	
	
Bob Sanford does not report to Jerry Lucas candidly on project progress and 
on difficulties he encounters. He does not understand his own responsibility of 
building teamwork, enhancing group morale, and creating employee satisfaction 
while achieving the goals of his group. He is lacking the skills and willingness to 
resolve conflicts within the group.

Finally, the section chiefs as a group go in to see Jerry Lucas and complain 
about the lack of authority and the oppressive atmosphere in the section.
	
	
What should Jerry Lucas do? I should note that this problem was condensed 
and adopted from Shannon (1980).
	
6.	The board of directors receives a proposal from a business partner to jointly set 
up an assembly plant in a Third World country. This new plant will assemble 
final products with key components made by the company. Financial terms are 
attractive and the future marketing outlook is bright. There is just one problem. 
The Third World country is not a democracy, has a poor human rights record, 
neglects to protect its own environment, and does not safeguard workers’ rights. 
An investment placed by the company would boost this country’s economy and 
thus the political position of its current dictator. Should the company accept the 
proposal? Explain why.
	
7.	What are some important characteristics of effective leaders? Which of these char-
acteristics are more difficult for engineers to acquire?
	
8.	The plant manager noticed a need to lessen the amount of waste materials, which 
occur in the production process. A task force was set up, composed of the plant 
manager and two of her supervisors, to examine the problem. They met for three 
months and regularly published the task force objectives and findings on the plant 
bulletin board.
	
	
The plant manager found, to her surprise, that the workers on the shop floor 
exhibited limited interest in the task force and ignored the bulletin board entirely. 
At the end of the three-month period, the task force came up with several excel-
lent recommendations, which required changes in work practices. Most of the 
workers implemented the recommended changes very reluctantly, and some even 
secretly worked to sabotage the new practices. Eventually, all recommendations 
were withdrawn.
	
	
What went wrong? How should the plant manager have handled this case?
	
9.	The project was running late and the section manager thought that it was time for 
a pep talk with his staff. He realized that he was considered to be somewhat auto-
cratic by his staff, but this time he thought that he would impress on them that he 
was really one of the members of the team and that they would work together as 
one in order to succeed.
	
	
The section manager thought he made quite a good speech. He pointed out that 
the project was running late and that, if they failed, the customer could cancel the 
contract. He explained further that, as manager, he was responsible for the success 
of the project, and so everyone would be equally to blame for the failure of the 
project.
	
	
Unexpectedly, a group of staff came in to see him a few days later to clarify 
whether they were all under threat of unemployment, should it turn out in the 
future that they were indeed late and the contract was canceled by the customer.
	
	
What went wrong? What would you have done differently?
	 10.	A regional sales manager suspected that one of her customers was having financial 
troubles. However, she was reluctant to mention it to her superior because she felt 
that she could be wrong. She kept quiet for several months, continuing to take large 
orders from this customer and hoping that the customer could recover from their 

112

troubles. Eventually, the customer went bankrupt and defaulted on the payment of 
several large bills. What went wrong? What would you have done differently?
	 11.	Company X selects someone who is weak technically, but very strong in group-
process skills, to lead a team in developing a new engineering product. Would 
such a person be successful as a team leader? What can be done to ensure that the 
engineering product developed by the team will be satisfactory from the technical 
standpoint?
	 12.	Conflicts between technologists and managers may arise when the technical pro-
fessionals with the skills to make a decision have to deal with a manager, who has 
the right to decide. Why do such conflicts often exist in organizations wherein 
everyone works toward the same common goal?
	 13.	Company X makes the decision to substitute aluminum for steel in a component 
of its product. What factors probably have contributed to this decision? At what 
managerial level would this decision most likely have been made?
	 14.	As the department head, you urgently need to find an experienced person to fill a 
vacancy. The work involves close cooperation and coordination with others inside 
and outside of the department. Candidate A has exactly the experience required, 
but appears to be very unsociable. Candidate B has experience in a related job and 
seems to have a pleasant personality, though is not an extrovert. Candidate C has 
business experience in a different industry and is extremely sociable. All three 
candidates have scored sufficiently high on intelligence tests to qualify for the job 
in terms of general ability. Which candidate would you choose, and why?
	 15.	Joe Engineer has just graduated from the University at Buffalo. He earned a 3.8 GPA 
for his master of engineering degree. Before he finished all academic work, he sent 
out numerous job applications and received three specific job offers, A, B, and C. 
All of them require him to make a decision for acceptance or rejection within one 
week.
	
	
Company A has an annual sales revenue of $5 billion dollars and is located in 
New York City. The job of “engineer” pays $95,000 a year, plus full benefits (e.g., 
401(k), health insurance, four weeks vacations per year, education assistance, 
and relocation assistance). The city living is, of course, exciting and fun, but very 
expensive. The company has a structured training program for new employees 
to become familiar with its operations. His future boss is friendly and acts pro-
fessionally. Joe believes that he can get along well with him. The work is in line 
with his basic technical training. As it is typically the case with big companies, 
other employees in the department are all quite smart and the internal competi-
tion among coworkers is relatively strong. He envisions that he may be able to get 
a promotion to the next level in five years’ time. New York City is huge and there 
are at least five competitors to Company A offering similar products/services in 
the city. Another potential benefit of working in New York City is that Joe may be 
able to meet a lot of interesting young people and find a future spouse.
	
	
Company B is a $500 million midsize company located in Rochester, New York. 
The job of “engineer” pays $80,000 a year plus full benefits, which are similar to 
that of Company A. Rochester is a midsize city with some cultural and entertain-
ment activities. Its cost of living is reasonable. Rochester is close to the Finger 
Lakes region, a well-known recreational area. The next large city is Toronto, which 
is about two hours away by car. The future boss is quite enthusiastic about Joe’s 

113
Leading
employment at the company and is eager to welcome him. The work is of a techni-
cal nature, but offers some managerial development opportunities that Joe likes. 
Joe believes that he could be promoted in the next three years and allowed to 
assume a higher level of responsibilities thereafter. The city has only a few large 
companies, such as Xerox and Kodak, but no company that competes directly 
against Company B. Joe thinks that it may be a bit more difficult, if not absolutely 
impossible, to meet a lot of interesting young people in Rochester.
	
	
Company C is a $50 million small company located in Buffalo, New York, where Joe 
did some summer work during his school years. The job of “engineer” pays $70,000 
a year and offers some benefits. The benefits are not as good as in either Company 
A or B. Buffalo is slightly larger than Rochester, but is still way behind New York 
City in terms of culture and entertainment activities. Like Rochester, Buffalo suffers 
from a declining industrial base. There have been no new companies relocating into 
the Buffalo or the Rochester areas in recent years. Company C has no competitors 
operating in Buffalo or nearby regions. Joe knows his future boss because of his 
earlier summer work at the site. The work is quite exciting, as the future boss views 
Joe as one of the bright new stars and shows a significant willingness to personally 
train Joe for higher-level roles and responsibilities. Being in a small company, Joe 
understands that he needs to face up to the challenges of getting involved quickly 
in many disciplines beyond the principal one that forms the basis of his master’s 
degree. Because Buffalo is also a regional city, Joe believes that it could be hard for 
him to meet a lot of interesting young people and subsequently find a mate.

methodologies and reasons that you used to arrive at your decision.
	 16.	Preparation of the company product that was promised to a major customer is 
running late, and there is intense pressure on the production team to deliver the 
product. The director of production is eventually told by the company president to 
deliver, “or else.” The director therefore decides to ship the product, even though it 
had not gone through all of its testing procedures. Members on the production team 
become upset due to their uncertainty about the functionality and reliability of the 
shipped product. The director, however, insists that “We will just have to take that 
chance.” As the director of production, how would you have acted differently?
Appendices
Appendix 4.A:  Factors Affecting One’s Influence on Others
This section discusses the various factors known to affect a person’s influence on people. It 
is advisable that the engineering manager pay attention to them (Cialdini 2006).
	
1.	Credibility
	
A person’s credibility is based on the following six attributes:
 
a.	 Composure (ways to handle oneself)
	
A degree of poise, stability, and patience; skills to handle a crisis situation effec-
tively; humor under stress; self-confidence; and ability for public speaking are 

114
Engineering Management
important attributes. Composure is the most important factor affecting cred-
ibility in the short term.
	
b.	 Character
	
Integrity and honesty (not lying, not cheating, attempting to do things above 
board, and maintaining high-moral standards); cooperative spirit, and pro-
fessional behavior—return all phones calls and respond to all mail; keep 
promises, have an open and forthright attitude, and be fair in all situations. 
Character is the most important factor affecting credibility in the long run 
(integrity and honesty in professional versus private matters).
	
c.	 Competence
	
Technical (job-specific skills, experience, and training), managerial (planning, 
organizing, leading, and controlling), and visionary (capability to envision the 
future with strategic thinking). Table 4.A1 displays the competence factors that 
exert an influence on superiors.
	
d.	 Courage
	
Commitment to principles; the willingness to stand up for beliefs, challenge 
others, and admit mistakes; and the ability to make tough decisions under 
uncertain conditions and accept responsibility for the consequences.
	
e.	 Conviction (beliefs)
	
Commit to the vision, demonstrate passion, and show confidence in the direc-
tion being pursued.
	
f.	 Care for people
	
Know people (family, aspirations, current and future needs, favored learning 
modes, upward mobility, etc.), treat people with respect and dignity (listening 
to understand), comment only on issues and situations and not on the person, 
and be a team player.
	
2.	Personal power (independent of position power)
	
Personal power is affected by the following three factors:
 
a.	 Personal attributes
	
Physical appearance and size, drive, dedication, and personal values.
	
b.	 Knowledge
	
Common sense, historical perspective, political knowledge needed by oth-
ers (how to get things done through which doors, by what means, and with 
whom—otherwise known as tricks of the trade).
	
c.	 Relationships
	
Business connections and power by association.

3.	Variable leadership style
	
Leadership style needs to be varied in accordance with the circumstances involved. 
In general, there are four situations that each requires a different style of leader-
ship. (See discussion in Section 4.2.)
	
	
The influence exerted on people by an engineering manager is affected by his 
or her credibility, personal power and leadership style. Engineering managers 
need to do the right thing at the right time and place, to the right people, for the 
right people, or with the right people.
Appendix 4.B:  Motivation of Mission-Critical People
In the competitive world today, all companies struggle to attract and retain innovative 
knowledge workers who are critical to the mission of their operations. To be successful, 
companies in general, and engineering managers in particular, need to tailor specific moti-
vation strategies to the needs of individuals. In general, most knowledge workers have the 
following types of needs:
	
1.	Need for power (40%): Setting goals and offering positive recognition to allow one 
to stand out and be unique
	
2.	Need for affiliation (40%): Focusing on mission, vision, and the difference the indi-
vidual can make in teams
	
3.	Need for self-achievement (20%): Offering task variety, learning, development, and 
growth opportunities
Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems Inc. experienced high turnover (about 40%) in their 
information technology sector. Surveys indicate that people with mission-critical jobs left 
because of three specific deficiencies:
	
1.	The work itself: Meaningfulness, relevancy, learning opportunity, enjoyability, vari-
ability, etc.
	
2.	Appreciation: Thanks, recognition; they were never told that their jobs were mis-
sion critical.
	
3.	Money: Many left for more money.
The preceding list of needs and the types of deficiencies causing knowledge work-
ers to want to leave are consistent with the Maslow need hierarchy model discussed in 
Section  4.6.3. It is obvious that unsatisfied needs will strip employees of motivation if 
they stay unsatisfied for long. Under such circumstances, knowledge workers are likely to 
migrate to places where they can satisfy these unmet needs.

Controlling
5.1  Introduction
The function of controlling in engineering management refers to activities carried out by 
an engineering manager to assess and regulate work in progress, evaluate results for the 
purpose of securing and maintaining maximum productivity, and reduce and prevent 
unacceptable performance (Reichmann 2011). Although the bulk of the controlling activi-
ties appear to be of an administrative and operational nature, controlling has strategic 
importance. To efficiently implement any assignment project, program, or plan, manage-
rial control is crucial. Any forward-looking strategic plan becomes of questionable value if 
its implementation is poor. Furthermore, without adequate control, managerial delegation 
is ineffective, rendering the managerial leadership less effective. The function of control-
ling also contributes to corporate renewal by pruning the dead wood, if needed.
Skills to recruit the best employees and keep them motivated and productive are criti-
cally important to managers. There are eight recommended ways to develop a productive 
workforce, including (1) assessing performance, (2) coaching, (3) dismissing an employee, 
(4) giving and receiving feedback, (5) hiring, (6) managing difficult interactions, (7) man-
aging workplace stress, and (8) retaining valued employees.
Engineering managers exercise control by carrying out the specific tasks of setting stan-
dards, measuring performance, evaluating performance, and controlling performance. In 
addition, this chapter addresses the manager’s control of time, personnel, business rela-
tionships, projects, and company knowledge.
5.2  Setting Performance Standards
To set standards is to specify criteria by which work and results are to be measured and 
evaluated. Setting performance standards defines the expected outcome explicitly. It is 
important for both the company and its employees to distinguish between performance 
grades of “outstanding,” “better than average,” “average,” “below average,” and “unac-
ceptable,” and to understand how performance is measured. Here, “average” is defined 
as the generally expected performance level for the job at hand by persons with adequate 
training and dedication (Cizek 2012).
Setting standards provides specific guidelines for exercising authority and making deci-
sions. Standards represent a yardstick for measuring the performance of employees and 

120
Engineering Management
units (such as cost centers and profit centers). Proper standards facilitate employee self-
evaluation, self-control, and self-advancement.
Standards are typically established in the form of how many (number of units), how 
good (quality, acceptance), how well (user acceptance), and how soon (timing), as imposed 
by the company management, the customers, or the marketplace. It is worth noting that 
current trends of setting standards emphasize the inclusion of customers’ perspectives.
There are standards of technical, historical, market, planning, safety, and equal employment 
opportunity (EEO) types. Technical standards specify metrics related to quality, quantity, 
mean time between failures (MTBF), maintenance requirements, and so on. Historical stan-
dards are based primarily on past records. Market standards are those related to competition, 
sales, return on investment (ROI), earning expectation by securities analysts, and other factors. 
Planning standards mostly relate to the strategic and operational needs of the company. They 
address topics such as objectives, programs, schedules, budgets, and policies. Safety standards 
refer to the metrics related to the safe operation of the company’s facilities. Government pro-
grams such as the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgate 
some of these safety standards. EEO standards are specific practices related to affirmative 
action for the purpose of achieving fairness among a diversified workforce.
Effective standards are characterized as being company sponsored, measurable, compa-
rable, reasonable, and indicative of the expected work performance on an objective basis in 
order to promote employee growth, while considering workers’ human factor inputs and 
securing their understanding and acceptance.
Example 5.1
The engineering director asks her managers whether they have any nominations for 
promotions from within their respective departments. The maximum number of pro-
motions allowed for the entire division is two. The nominations must be selective and 
only for people whose performance has been outstanding. One manager thought his 
whole team had been outstanding, so he recommended all 10 for promotion. He rea-
soned, “It is better for the morale of the team that they know that I support all of them 
fully. If the director now promotes 1 of the 10 or none at all, then they will not feel so bad 
knowing that at least I have thought them all worthy of being promoted.”
What should the director do?
Answer 5.1
The director should call the manager in and reprimand him for not following the instruc-
tions given, for being selective in nominating candidates for promotion, neglecting the 
delegated responsibility of evaluating the performance of his staff fairly and objectively, 
and wanting to pass on his own responsibility to his director so as to be the “good guy.”
She should order the manager to repeat the nomination process and come up with a 
rank-ordered list of outstanding performers for possible promotion within two days. If 
he refuses to do so, this will be registered as one incidence of disobedience. Repeated 
offenses of this type can lead to immediate discharge.
There are quite a few barriers that prevent good standards from being readily devel-
oped. Standards may be too subjective, as technically strong engineers tend to set unreal-
istically high standards for themselves and others. If standards are set too high, workers 
may become demoralized and fearful of not measuring up. On the other hand, if stan-
dards are set too low—not challenging enough for the workers—management will lose 
the respect of employees. Standards may be confusing and may not clearly indicate the cri-
teria for excellence. Standards may be qualitative and vague and thus subject to divergent 

121
Controlling
interpretations by different people. Standards may also be set without proper consider-
ation of the constraints related to resources and implementation.
A useful way for companies to set proper standards is the practice of benchmarking, 
discussed in the next section.
5.3  Benchmarking
Benchmarking is a method of defining performance standards in relation to a set of inter-
nal and external references (Bogan and English 2014; Bogetoft 2013). There are two types 
of benchmarking:
	
1.	Internal benchmarking uses references internal to a company to set performance 
standards, as illustrated by the following example. Company X has achieved 
a productivity of $150,000 per employee in 2014 and is determined to continue 
improving performance on a yearly basis. The company president sets a new per-
formance standard for the year 2015 at $165,000 per employee, a performance level 
of 10% higher than the previous year.
	
	
Internal benchmarking is convenient to apply, as it offers a reasonable, short-
term performance assessment. However, it may create a false sense of corporate 
well-being, as the resulting performance standards, in the absence of an external 
reference, may be deficient in the long run. That is, for Company X, the 10% pro-
ductivity increment may be inadequate, or even outright dangerous to the long-
term health of the company, if the industrial average productivity gain has been 
12% per year in the past, and some competitors of Company X are aiming at 15% 
for the coming year.
	
2.	External benchmarking uses references external to the company to set performance 
standards. The following examples illustrate its applications:
	
a.	 Financial ratios: Assuming that the gross margins of many service-oriented 
public companies are in the range of 35%–40% for the last several years, as 
published regularly by Wall Street securities firms, then setting the gross 
margin target for a specific company at the 40% level for the immediate future 
year is a performance standard defined by external benchmarking. Setting 
the gross margin at 40%, if subsequently met, will ensure that the company 
will be among the best performers in its industry (Rist and Pizzia 2014).
	
b.	 Performance metrics: Many metrics are published in business literature to eval-
uate performance related to production, product delivery, quality control, time 
to market, customer service, reliability, customer problem solving, and others. 
Using these known metrics as references to set performance standards makes 
explicit the relative competitive position of a company (Okes 2013).
	
c.	 Best practices: Another set of important external benchmarks is called best prac-
tices. Table 5.1 lists a number of subject domains for which best practices have 
been published in business and industry.
	
	
These are work processes or procedures perfected and upgraded by various 
companies over the years to address specific problems and issues in engineer-
ing, production, marketing, strategic management, business development, 

122
Engineering Management
and other areas of corporate governance. These are extremely valuable “tried-
and-true” methods to achieve useful results and add value to the companies. 
Those companies that are too undisciplined to consistently apply best prac-
tices in carrying out their corporate activities will soon discover that they have 
become less and less competitive over time.
	
d.	 Critical success factors: Serving well as external benchmarks are critical success 
factors, the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving success in spe-
cific business management, engineering, production, and marketing domains. 
These factors are derived from the successes and failures experienced by 
companies in various industries. Having a clear understanding of these fac-
tors allows the company management to make strategic choices regarding 
pursuing business in new directions, initiating new products/services to 
gain advantages, and capturing opportunities in new markets by optimally 
applying corporate strengths while minimizing any exposure of weaknesses 
(Mihaescu 2013).
	
e.	 Target pricing: In recent years, some companies have successfully applied 
the technique of target pricing, another external benchmarking method, to 
achieve success in the marketplace (Nizam 2014). First, the company conducts 
a survey to determine the current prices of products that are in direct compe-
tition with the new products that the company is planning to develop. Using 
these prices as references, the company sets a target selling price (such as 20% 
below the prices of the competitive products) for its new product. Then, the 
company deducts the required gross margin for the company to sustain itself 
while meeting the shareholders’ expectations. The resulting figure is the cost 
of goods sold target (the cost target) for the company’s new yet-to-be-developed 
product. The cost target is then imposed on the company’s production and 
engineering departments as a performance standard for developing the new 
product. Funds are available for developing the new product only if the cost 
target can be met. This is tantamount to an innovation under duress model of

management control. The resulting new product is then more or less ensured 
a cost-competitive edge in the marketplace.
	
	
Traditionally, bringing a new product to the marketplace follows a sequen-
tial process. First, the product is designed by engineers on the basis of inputs 
from marketing. Then, it is redesigned by service engineers for serviceabil-
ity to customers. Afterward, it is redesigned again by production engineers 
for manufacturability. Finally, it is mass produced, and its final product cost 
is then accurately estimated. The company management adds the gross mar-
gin to set the product price. At each step, engineers tend to introduce contin-
gencies, or “cushions,” to ensure that the work is done properly within their 
respective units. However, often this sequential process leads to products that 
are not cost-competitive in the marketplace.
	
	
In fact, the basic concept of target pricing can be applied to many other 
corporate activities for the purpose of ensuring that the company remains 
competitive. This is particularly pertinent to the current business environment, 
which is changing rapidly due to new technologies and becoming increasingly 
globalized.
	
f.	 Balanced scorecard: Many companies are known to have monitored corporate 
performance by using, primarily, financial metrics on activities related to the 
past (see Section 7.6). Progressive companies have started to devise a balanced 
set of performance metrics to properly monitor additional company activities 
that also have a profound impact on its future success (Niven 2014).
	
	
Balanced scorecards are attempts to accomplish this objective. Examples of such 
forward-looking performance metrics include the establishment of the percent-
age of company business generated by products introduced in the last five years; 
the percentage or amount of corporate funds spent on projects initiated in the 
last five years; the number of patent disclosures, patent applications, and patent 
awards in a given year; the number of new supply chain partners engaged in the 
last five years; the percentage of sales realized from new customers acquired dur-
ing the past year; and the fraction of product cost arising from new technologies 
adopted in the last five  years. It is self-evident that setting adequate, forward-
looking standards based on both present and future performance measures helps 
guide the company to success over the long run.
5.3.1  Sample Benchmarking Metrics
Many sets of performance metrics are available from business literature. Table 5.2 contains 
selected samples of metrics used in various business domains (Ray et al. 2015).
5.3.2  Limitations of Benchmarking
Benchmarking is useful, but it has certain limitations. For example, some reference data 
may not be available, and in such cases, estimates must be made. This may cause the value 
of such benchmarks to be less robust. Benchmarking metrics are mostly based on past 
performance, and they can hardly predict the future. Nor can they be used to predict 
new competition. However, even with these limitations, past-oriented benchmarks are still 
valuable to some extent; as Confucius says, “Studying the past may lead to a better under-
standing of the future.”

5.4  Measuring Performance
After the performance standards are set, the next step of management control is to mea-
sure performance. Performance measurement refers to the recording and reporting of 
work done and the outcome attained. Managers take the following steps to measure per-
formance: collect, store, analyze, and report information systematically; compare the per-
formance with established standards; and issue reports such as data summary, collection 
of results, and forecasts to document findings.
Performance measurement may be carried out by time study, work sampling, and per-
formance rating, among others (Falcone 2013; Aquinis 2012) for routine work, such as that 
on factory floors. The performance of professional workers needs to be measured with 
respect to the contributions made toward the attainment of the company’s short- and long-
term objectives. All measurements must be factual and accurate in order for them to serve 
as a valid basis for performance evaluation.
5.5  Evaluating Performance
To evaluate performance is to appraise work in progress, assess the completed job, and 
provide feedback. The following steps are usually taken to evaluate employee perfor-
mance: establish limits of tolerance, note variations (deviation within the tolerance limits) 
and exceptions (deviation outside of the tolerance limits), provide recognition for good 
performance, and give timely, proper credit, if justifiable. Voltaire said, “Appreciation is a 
wonderful thing. It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.” Paying atten-
tion to deviations encourages employee self-appraisal, fosters initiative, and enhances 
managerial efficiency.
A rating method often used in industry is to rank an employee in one of five catego-
ries: (1) outstanding, (2) above average, (3) average, (4) poor, and (5) failure. Category rank-
ing is based on performance metrics that are specific to the individual. More often than 

126
Engineering Management
not, in order to indicate the importance of these performance metrics to the company, top 
management will assign and publicize the weight factors associated with all performance 
metrics. A weighted score, similar to that calculated by the Rational Decision Method dis-
cussed in Section 4.4.2, is then determined for each employee. The weighted score and a 
written statement are then submitted by the manager to his or her superiors at the next 
higher management level for review. Once the approval of higher management is secured, 
these evaluation results become the official basis for salary administration and promo-
tional considerations in the future.
It is quite obvious that this type of rating system has basic weaknesses. Some man-
agers may suffer from a “halo effect” and assign an employee the same rating for all 
performance metrics. Others may be handicapped by a “recent effect” in that they are 
predominately influenced by recent events. By nature, some managers are more lenient 
than others, resulting in different interpretations of the grade “outstanding performance.” 
Furthermore, the competitive nature of getting one’s own employees promoted sooner 
tends to cause inflated ratings. To exert some control over this potentially chaotic situation, 
a few industrial companies are known to have advised department managers to steer the 
overall evaluation results toward a Gaussian-type distribution, which places the majority 
of employees in the “average” group and only about 5% and 15%, respectively, in the excel-
lent and above-average groups (Gray 2015).
At the annual appraisal time, the individual employees will be notified of the approved 
evaluation results. In general, feedback from the individual employees is customarily 
solicited and documented. If the individual employee disagrees with some or all parts of 
the evaluation, his or her written comments are incorporated into the official evaluation 
files, which will be reviewed again by superiors at the next higher management level. If 
deemed proper, the approved evaluation results may be modified. The needs for the indi-
vidual’s future development are also discussed and noted. Specific goals of development 
are then agreed on as a gauge for monitoring the individual employees’ progress at the 
next annual appraisal time.
The “average” level of performance is defined as the level of performance that can be 
generally expected of a person with adequate training and dedication in a given posi-
tion. To be rated as excellent or above average, one must perform extraordinarily well and 
produce an unexpected positive outcome, which has a recognizable impact on the com-
pany’s objectives. Poor performance is usually associated with work that is not meeting 
the acceptable quality standards, exceeding the approved budget, not completing the work 
on time, and/or suffering from problems related to communication, personality conflicts, 
devotion to work, interpersonal skills, or other deficiencies.
Should the performance of an employee be rated as poor or failure, his or her manager 
must initiate action to correct such performance in a timely manner.
5.6  Correcting Performance
To correct performance is to rectify and improve the work done and the results obtained. 
The performance evaluation may show that the quality of the employee’s work is below 
expectation. Reasons for performance deficiencies may include a lack of known perfor-
mance standards or feedback, not possessing the required technical capabilities to perform 
the tasks at hand, or not having a good work ethic and personal initiative (Fournies 1999).

127
Controlling
Employees’ mistakes should be corrected by focusing on future progress and growth. 
Employers should take short-term action to overcome deficiencies, such as getting assistance 
from outside consultants or hiring temporary workers. To avoid repeating the noted devia-
tions, long-term-oriented actions may be considered, such as improving training, modify-
ing work procedures and policies, transferring employees, or recommending dismissals.
When correcting performance, a manager should offer negative feedback without attack-
ing the employee’s self-esteem. Feedback must be focused on results and outcome—not 
the person—and directed toward the future, without upsetting employees or harboring 
punitive motives. Managers should demonstrate a helpful and sincere attitude and pose 
no threat to their workers (Harvard Business Review 2014).
Generally speaking, it is not good for employees to make mistakes in the fundamentals 
of engineering. It is acceptable to fail in new and risky development projects, but making 
the same mistakes again and again is viewed negatively by all management.
5.7  Means of Control
There are a number of tools available for managers to exercise control, such as performing 
personal inspections, reviewing current progress, and defining any deviation from plans. 
This is the strategy of control by way of focusing on exceptions. Managers may also set 
priorities with respect to job assignment, resource deployment, and technology applica-
tion. This is exercising control by managing resources (Storey 2014).
5.8  General Comments
Managers must constantly define which tasks should be performed and have employees 
perform these tasks correctly. The principle of the critical few (the Pareto principle) states 
that, as a rule, 20% of factors may affect 80% of outcome (see Figure 5.1). The key is, of 
course, for managers to properly define these critical few, allocate resources to pursue 
them, and achieve the desirable outcome.

128
Engineering Management
Control should be focused on where action takes place. In general, self-control imposed 
by the workers involved is the most effective type. However, by and large, people also 
resent control, and extensive control may lead to loss of motivation. Therefore, manag-
ers must manage both positive and negative exceptions. With information available and 
mechanisms in place, the preferred type of control is flexible and coordinated.
5.9  Control of Management Time
Time is a valuable and limited resource for everyone, including managers. Management 
tasks have several common characteristics: important tasks often arrive at unpredictable 
times, trivial tasks often take up a disproportionately large amount of time, and interrup-
tions are common to a manager’s schedule.
Some managers may waste a lot of time if the roles and responsibilities of their employ-
ees are not clearly defined. Often, a lack of self-discipline—procrastination, confused pri-
orities, lack of personal drive, or lack of planning—wastes time. Other managers suffer 
from a lack of effective delegation; for example, there may be a delegation of responsibili-
ties without the commensurate authority, or the application of too little or too much con-
trol. Still other managers waste time because of poor communication related to policies, 
procedures, meetings, and other subjects (Cockerell 2015). The following techniques may 
help managers avoid wasting time:
	
1.	Set goals for the day, the week, the month, and the year.
	
2.	Prioritize tasks to be done, beginning with the most important tasks (A tasks), 
then doing the less important ones (B tasks), and leaving the least important ones 
(C tasks) untouched if time is insufficient. Make sure that the tasks are relevant 
and add value. Reserve blocks of time to pursue A tasks.
	
3.	Plan each task beforehand and group some of them together.
	
4.	Minimize interruptions by keeping the office door closed for a specific time period 
and asking the secretary to hold all phone calls.
	
5.	Make use of waiting time at the airport, on the train, in the doctor’s office, and 
so on.
	
6.	Keep reports and memoranda short and to the point. Some managers in industry 
have the habit of browsing over only the first page of any report and stopping if 
the information is uninteresting, of secondary importance, or irrelevant to their 
current needs.
Enumerated in Table 5.3 are some time-saving tips that are adopted from several pub-
lished sources (Glei 2013; Reese 2014; Smith 2014; Goldman 2014). Engineering managers 
may find them useful.
Example 5.3
The customer service manager is a busy person. He rushes from one problem to another 
without actually taking time to complete any job or solve any problem properly.
What control problem does the customer service manager have? What can he do to 
enhance his job effectiveness?

129
Controlling
Answer 5.3
The customer service manager has a time-control problem. He reacts to problems and 
does not discharge his job responsibilities effectively. He can do several things to rectify 
the situation:
	
1.	 Organize the customer service department into groups (e.g., repairs, parts 
supply, warranty, problem solving by phone) and know the capabilities of his 
support staff for these groups of services.
	
2.	 Set up the call center operation to automatically channel customer calls to the 
respective service groups.
	
3.	 Delegate the responsibilities of providing customer services to the leaders of 
these groups, requiring them to follow through on each and every one of the 
customer problems and keeping good records of all services rendered.
	
4.	 Refer specific problems (e.g., nasty customers) that the group leaders cannot 
resolve for the customer service manager to handle personally.
	
5.	 Assign the analysis of service records to someone who can apply statistics 
and define trends suggested by these data (e.g., parts with highest failure rate, 
nature of frequent complaints, average time spent on problem solving, number 
of calls from customers unhappy with company’s services).
	
6.	 Establish a system to solicit customer feedback on service and suggestions for 
improvement.
	
7.	 Set up metrics to measure service quality (e.g., number of complaints per week, 
average service time spent per customer, cost per service call), making use of 
best practices available in the industry.
	
8.	 Monitor progress and seek ways to constantly improve the service operation.
TABLE 5.3
Time-Saving Tips for Managers
	 1.	Set goals
Write specific, measurable outcomes that you want to achieve in the next 
week, month, year, and five years. Consider your work, relationships, play, 
and well-being. Progress from goals to plan to work.
	 2.	Use a master “to-do” list
Categorize all “to-do” ideas according to which goal each serves. Estimate all 
others.
	 3.	Get the big picture
Plan your priorities so that you work foremost on whatever gives the biggest 
payoff and potential.
	 4.	Cluster common tasks
Do similar tasks in the same time block (e.g., a batch of letters, several phone 
calls).
	 5.	Create systems
Keep tools, forms, checklists, and information handy and organized for 
repetitive tasks.
	 6.	Establish place habit
Keep everything in its predetermined place.
	 7.	Delineate time blocks
Schedule blocks of uninterruptible time (two to four hours) to work on 
projects requiring concentration. Assure colleagues of availability otherwise.
	 8.	Design your environment
Make your setting conducive to concentration (e.g., sit with your back to 
traffic passing your office and screen calls).
	 9.	Cut meeting time
Use proven meeting time savers (e.g., go to others’ offices for meetings, do 
stand-up meetings, set an agenda and follow through rigorously).
	10.	Lessen panic
Handle what worries you the most. Ask yourself, “Will this matter seem 
urgent 10 years from now?”
	11.	Take the one-minute test
Periodically take a minute to ponder, “Am I doing this in the best way to meet 
my goals, serve others, and take care of myself?”

Engineering Management
5.10  Control of Personnel
Managerial control is exercised primarily for the purposes of maximizing company pro-
ductivity and minimizing potential damages arising from an ineffective use of company 
resources, as well as problems related to ethics, laws, safety, and health issues. For highly 
skilled personnel, such as science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) profession-
als, less control is usually more effective and acceptable. Excess control induces undesir-
able reactions and produces adverse effects. This is best illustrated by the supervision 
curve displayed in Figure 5.2.
To manage creative people, or those who are able to produce new and useful results, 
managers need to set targets, monitor the employees periodically, apply a low level of 
supervision, and maintain a collaborative and creativity-inducing work environment 
(Mathis et al. 2013).
Example 5.4
Mary Stevenson, the shop manager, works well with all of her staff members. She relies 
on Mike Denver, who has the longest tenure and most extensive experience in the 
group, as the second in command for day-to-day operations. The shop is modernizing 
its operation with the use of computers. Mary Stevenson and her boss, Craig Martin, 
decide to bring in a young computer specialist, Janet Carter, from the outside.
To make sure that the shop modernization process moves forward, Mary Stevenson 
spends a lot of time with Janet Carter. Mike Denver sees less and less of Mary Stevenson, 
although Mary still depends on Mike for day-to-day operations. Mike resents being 
shut out from the work done by Mary and Janet. Mike does not complain, but after 
six months, he tenders his resignation and goes to work for a competitor. Mary Stevenson 
is shattered. She deeply regrets this major loss to the shop.
What went wrong? What was not controlled? What would you do differently?
Answer 5.4
The key issue at hand is that Mike perceived a loss of trust and respect from Mary. Mike 
also incorrectly perceived his own approaching obsolescence resulting from the shop’s 
computer technology. Both of these misperceptions caused Mike to have serious doubts 
about his future personal standing in the shop. Mary did not anticipate these percep-
tions and misunderstandings and did nothing to correct them in a timely manner.

Mary Stevenson should have done the following:
	
1.	 Bring Mike Carter into the loop of hiring a computer specialist to broaden the 
skill sets of the shop. Allow Mike to participate in the selection and interview 
process.
	
2.	 Announce in a staff meeting that Mary needs to spend time to bring Janet 
along initially and that Mike will actively assist in taking care of day-to-day 
operations in the shop.
	
3.	 Get Mike involved in the work done by Janet, so that Mike, as the second in 
command, is kept up to date with this new type of computer work planned for 
the shop. Should Mike need to take over the management of the shop at some 
future time, he would have been given time to familiarize himself with the 
new computer-related operation. Grooming a candidate in the shop for pos-
sible succession in the future should have been Mary’s responsibility anyway.
	
4.	 Maintain a balance of management attention to both computer-related and 
other tasks in the shop.
5.11  Control of Business Relationships
As industrial markets become increasingly global, business relationships (defined by 
whom the company knows and how well) represent an increasingly important competi-
tive force in the marketplace (Hoffman et al. 2014).
It is highly advisable that managers acquire the habit of proactively forming, maintain-
ing, and controlling new business relationships for the benefit of their employers and 
themselves.
Contacts may be established with noncompetitors. At proper occasions, such as pro-
fessional meetings, technical conferences, seminars, and industrial exhibitions, managers 
should be accustomed to introduce themselves to others with a five-second “commercial”—
a brief self-description of their key areas of expertise. They should take note of others’ 
professional specialty areas and follow up with periodical exchanges to nurture the rela-
tionships. Over time, such a network of professional contacts may become a very powerful 
business asset to managers and their employers (Menken 2011).
5.12  Control of Projects
Managers exercise control over projects when serving as project leaders (Kerzner 2014). 
Tools for project control include program evaluation review technique (PERT), critical path 
method (CPM) charts, or suitable computer or Internet-based project management software 
(see Section 12.3.2). Project control focuses on several key issues, as indicated in Table 5.4.
To manage and control projects, STEM professionals need skills related to organizing 
and planning, people management, problem solving, communication, change manage-
ment, and checking on technical and financial feasibility. They also need to have drive and 
energy, broad technical knowledge, and an optimistic outlook, and to be goal-oriented and 
customer focused.

132
Engineering Management
5.13  Control of Quality
To achieve success in the marketplace, companies must focus on the quality of products/
services they offer. Thus, the planning and implementation of quality control programs 
represents a major corporate undertaking for all progressive companies (Adams 2012).
In the automotive industries, product quality is a well-recognized competitive factor. 
A recent study by J. D. Power Associates in 2014 indicates that Porsche, Jaguar, Lexus, 
Hyundai, and Toyota are the top-five carmakers, with fewer problems per 100 vehicles 
than the industrial average of 116 problems, ahead of Chevrolet, BMW, Lincoln, Chrysler, 
Cadillac, and Ford. The metric of the industrial average number of problems per 100 vehi-
cles has been decreasing steadily for some years now.
Many years ago, Deming (2000) promoted the concept of product quality in the United 
States but attracted few followers. He went to Japan and was enthusiastically welcomed 
there. Since then, a number of quality control practices have been created by the Japanese, 
such as quality circles, Kaizen, Kanban, just in time (JIT), Lean production, Taguchi, 
Ishikawa, and the 5S campaign. Kanban means looking up to the board in order to 
adjust to a constantly varying production schedule. The 5S campaign includes (1) seiri—
arrangement, (2) seiton—tidying up, (3) seisou—cleaning, (4) seiketsu—cleanliness, and 
(5) shukan—customizing (Taylor 2013).
Kaizen means “change for the better.” It includes a number of quality practices, such 
as customer orientation, total quality control, robotics, quality circles, suggestion system, 
quality betterment, JIT, zero defects, small group activities, productivity furtherance, 
and corporate labor–management relationships. Kaizen begins and ends with people. 
An involved leadership guides workers to strive for lower cost, higher quality, and faster 
delivery of goods and services to customers (Kelly 2015; Miller et al. 2013). The elimina-
tion of all non-value-adding activities is a key emphasis in the Kaizen approach. Table 5.5 
presents numerous sample Kaizen steps taken by various manufacturers. Many of these 
steps are based on common sense.
These quality concepts are logical, reasonable, practical, and, above all, obvious. In 
fact, there is really nothing new or novel in them. Many of these quality concepts were

Monitor the actual versus projected percentage of cost expenditures and take 
proper actions to minimize deviations.
	 2.	Schedule control
Monitor the actual versus projected percentage of completion time and take 
the proper actions to minimize deviations.
	 3.	Critical path activities
These are activities without time slacks, which must be managed with extra 
care to avoid schedule delay.

Delays arise from slow equipment delivery or installation; equipment 
damage in transportation; construction delay due to labor action, weather, 
utilities, and other causes; and changes of personnel.
	 5.	Collaboration
Securing collaboration among team members is a key success factor for any 
project.
	 6.	Technical and financial 
feasibility
Make sure that the project can be technically implemented and that the 
expected financial value justifies the expected cost of the project.

subsequently “reimported” to the United States with Japanese labels. Thereafter, American 
managers started paying attention to quality.
Knowing what to do is useful, but it is not enough. Pronouncing a few quality terms 
in Japanese will impress no one. Practicing the quality concept meticulously is the only 
key to success in quality enhancement and control. To achieve useful results in quality, 
management commitment is essential. Management commitment is reflected in company 
value, vision, resources assignment, customer focus, long-term strategic orientation, and 
rewards systems in place. In addition, worker dedication—drive to excellence, attention to 
details, and continuous betterment—must be assured.
It is interesting to note that, during the last 20-plus years, foreign automakers opened a 
total of 17 factories in the United States to produce cars, using American workers. Their 
superior product quality output can only be attributed to superior management prac-
tices, as there is no difference in culture, language, or value systems between American 
workers employed by General Motors or Ford and those working in U.S. factories for 
Toyota, Nissan, or other foreign carmakers. Maynard (2004) pointed out that General 
Motors had 60% of the American car market in 1960 and has only about half of that 
today. The share of the light-vehicle market owned by foreigners is now already 40%. 
Toyota is predicted to overtake General Motors and become the largest car company in 
the world in the near future. Maynard further pointed out that there is a difference in the 
backgrounds of the lead managers involved. General Motors and Ford have been headed 
by financial professionals, whereas Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes are led by 
engineers who are “passionately interested in everything to do with cars.” This could 
be a factor affecting the varying extent of management commitment devoted to product 
quality.
Another case in point is the implementation of the quality program. Ford Motors 
Company is credited for having spearheaded the well-known failure mode and effect 
analysis (FMEA) method in the U.S. automotive industry around 1977 (Carlson 2012).

Engineering Management
FMEA may be applied to design, process, service, and other engineering or business activ-
ities that may go wrong. Murphy’s law says, “If something can go wrong, it will.” FMEA 
is a proactive program intended to catch all possible failure modes before they actually 
occur. It is solidly based on the understanding that the correction of potential failures 
before they actually occur will be much less costly than the required remedial actions after 
the fact.
The FMEA concept is rather straightforward. Table  5.6 includes the headings of an 
FMEA worksheet. For a given step number, the process description, potential failure 
mode, and potential effects of the failure in question are to be entered. Then, the severity 
factor (Row E) is assessed, using a number between 1 and 10 (10 being the most severe), 
regarding the impact on customers. Row F registers the potential root cause for the failure. 
Row G defines the probability of its occurrence, again using a number between 1 and 10, 
with 10 being the most likely to occur. Row H specifies the current control and detection 
practices. The detection factor (Row I) is assigned a value between 1 and 10, with 10 being 
the most difficult to detect (Stamatis 2014).
The factor RPN (risk response number, Row J) is the product of three numbers: sever-
ity (Row E), occurrence (Row G), and detection (Row I). Remedial or preventive actions 
(Row K) are to be taken according to the priority order based on the RPN. Row L tabu-
lates the person responsible for taking the recommended actions. Row M documents what 
actions were in fact taken.
Rows N, O, and P contain the results of reevaluation of the failure mode in question 
after remedial and preventive actions have been undertaken. The new post-action RPN 
number is expected to be significantly lower than its corresponding preaction number, 
and it documents the corrective impact on the failure mode. Such documents may be 
used to satisfy the customer’s requirements and serve as guidelines to drive continuous 
improvement.
Applying FMEA systematically should lead to a continuous reduction of the effects of 
failure modes in product design, product manufacturing, service, and other engineering

or business applications. Many U.S. automotive companies and their tiered suppliers have 
applied FMEA with varying degrees of success. Although Ford initiated the use of FMEA 
back in 1977, it still lags behind other industrial leaders today in terms of problems per 
100 vehicles (Ford was identified as having 116 problems versus Porsche’s 74 problems by 
the J. D. Power Associates 2014 study). This drives home the point that having knowledge 
about quality is useful, but implementing quality control steps represents the key step 
in achieving quality performance. Successful implementation requires management com-
mitment and worker dedication. Technically, FMEA can be successfully implemented. The 
management challenge is how to achieve better quality performance consistently for all 
nameplates or products, and over a long period of time.
Like Kaizen and FMEA, TQM is also a very powerful program addressing the 
issues related to product quality and organizational productivity (ASQ Quality Press 
2013). In a typical academic course at the graduate level, TQM covers the concepts 
of customer satisfaction, empowerment of employees in problem solving, continuous 
improvement, and management excellence by creating and implementing corporate 
visions. To achieve TQM success, management commitment and worker dedication are 
also required.
Quality control is an important function, in which managers play a key role. They need 
to be actively and persistently involved with workers to apply common sense in eliminat-
ing wastes, speeding delivery, simplifying processes, paying attention to the gritty details 
of practice, and continuously improving the way work gets done.
Example 5.5
What is the generic problem-solving approach applicable to solve most engineering and 
management problems?
Answer 5.5
The generic problem-solving approach may look like the following (Fogler et al. 2013):
	
1.	 Perform a situation analysis (e.g., assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 
and threats).
	
2.	 Formulate a statement of the problem.
	
3.	 Define performance standards that are observable, measurable, and relevant to 
the goal.
	
4.	 Generate alternative solutions to the problem.
	
5.	 Evaluate these alternatives in terms of their consequences to the organization.
	
6.	 Select the best alternative solution with the highest value and the lowest 
adverse effect on the organization.
	
7.	 Implement a pilot test of the proposed solution and revise as indicated by prac-
tical experience.
	
8.	 Implement the solution.
	
9.	 Evaluate the outcome.
	
10.	 Revise the process as necessary.
Note that there is no one universal solution to all management problems, but that the cor-
rect solution will depend on the unique needs of the situation.
The problem-solving process practiced by Xerox Corporation is a good example of the 
approaches taken by many companies in industry (Garvin 1993). The Xerox problem-
solving process contains the details shown in Table 5.7.

Engineering Management
5.14  Control of Knowledge
Knowledge refers to the sum total of corporate intellectual property, which is composed 
of patents, proprietary know-how, technical expertise, design procedures, empirical 
problem-solving heuristics, process operational insights, and others (North and Kumta 
2014; Leonard et al. 2014). Some of these knowledge chunks are documentable, while others 
typically reside in the employees’ heads.
Managers are generally responsible for developing, preserving, safeguarding, and 
applying corporate engineering and technology knowledge. They also need to develop 
policies to facilitate the control of such knowledge. Some examples of knowledge manage-
ment strategies are listed in Table 5.8.
One of the major difficulties in knowledge management is that many knowledge chunks 
are dispersed throughout various documents within the company. Data mining software 
products represent new tools to help extract and group together related information from

Controlling
diverse sources for wide dissemination and effective use by others. Another major diffi-
culty in managing knowledge is that most domain experts do not like to share their knowl-
edge with others, rendering the use of knowledge acquisition tools somewhat ineffective.
Knowledge control is particularly important from the viewpoint of countering indus-
trial espionage. Special policies regulating employee contact with competitors at neutral 
sites (such as professional meetings, university environments, and industrial seminars) 
need to be defined to safeguard company knowledge.
Preserved or acquired knowledge adds little value to the company if there is no resulting 
refinement or improvement in the way work gets done. Managers also need to focus on 
effectively transferring the knowledge gained to achieve a modification of the company’s 
behavior that uses the new knowledge and insights. Doing so will make the company a 
true learning organization that steadily enriches itself.
5.15  Conclusion
Control is another important function of engineering management, which focuses mostly 
on the administrative and operational aspects of the work. Control is essential to the 
implementation of any project or program activities by specifying performance metrics, 
motoring progress for initiating corrective steps, and ensuring the attainment of useful 
outcomes.
Particular attention should be paid to external benchmarking when setting standards in 
order to avoid causing a company to lose its long-term competitive strengths. Delegation 
without proper control will likely result in wasting the company’s resources (e.g., time, 
manpower, know-how, and management attention).
Control is routinely applied to team members, knowledge, business relationships, and 
the allocation of resources, as they all contribute directly to the specific project objectives 
at hand. Care must be taken in dealing with professionals, who generally prefer to be 
guided by specific objectives and then empowered to select the right course of action to 
achieve the project objective within the given time and budget constraints. On the one 
hand, tight and rigid control discourages employee initiative. On the other hand, too loose 
a control could lead to the project objectives being missed. Exercising the right level of con-
trol is of critical importance, dependent on the people, the nature of the project, its urgency 
and impact, and the risks entailed.

As a general rule, setting clear and understandable standards and performance goals 
and insisting on good planning efforts will encourage employees to exercise self-directed 
control while promoting participation, involvement, and employee motivation.
QUESTIONS
	
1.	A number of years ago, ISO Standards 9000 series were developed to promote 
work quality by standardizing engineering design, testing, production, and other 
procedures. How many ISO standards are there, and how well have these stan-
dards been accepted in the United States?
	
2.	A company decides to offer an average annual raise of 8%, although the current 
inflation rate is 10%. Each engineering manager decides on the best way to distrib-
ute the salary increases to his or her staff. However, if everyone gets an increase of 
8%, there will be no differentiation between strong and weak performers for the 
previous year. What should you do as an engineering manager?
	
3.	A key engineer in the department hands in her resignation notice; her reason for 
leaving is that she has been offered a much higher salary by a competitor. The 
manager recommends to the director that the company match the competitor’s 
offer, even though this would allow the engineer to earn above the maximum for 
her grade. “We can always give her smaller increases in subsequent years to bring 
her salary back into line,” says the manager. What should the director do?
	
4.	Motivation in the assembly shop is high. However, the shop manager notices that, 
although the daily production is above average for the shop, it drops down to a 
low during the first hour after the lunch break. It is further diagnosed that the 
operators tend to continue socializing till well after the lunch break.
	
	
The shop manager changes the lunch break and staggers it over a two hour 
period so that the operators cannot go to lunch together. To his surprise, motiva-
tion begins to fall, and productivity drops dramatically.
	
	
What do you think is the problem? How do you advise the shop manager to fix 
this problem?
	
5.	Bill Carter is an excellent hardware designer, but he wants to move into man-
agement to broaden his experience. His manager is supportive and encourages 
Bill to go to evening classes on management. Bill works hard for two years and 
graduates first in his class. Soon, there is a management opening in the procure-
ment department. Bill applies for it, but an outside applicant eventually fills the 
position. Bill is turned down because he does not have sufficient experience in the 
procurement functions, a stated key requirement for the job.
	
	
Bill protests, “But I have better technical knowledge of components than 
all the procurement engineers put together, and I learned about procurement 
in my management courses. The only way I will get experience is to work on 
the job.”
	
	
Do you think Bill should have been given the job? How would you have han-
dled this situation differently?
	
6.	The company president has noted a constant increase in the number of reports 
passed on to her, many of them coming through the mail, some through the com-
pany’s intranet. Most of these reports remain unread, although, when traveling 
for business, the company president does find time to browse through some of the 

139
Controlling
reports while on the airplane. It has clearly become difficult for her to keep track 
of all projects due to information overload. However, she does not want to aban-
don her personal objective of being constantly informed, and she does not want to 
query her vice presidents for summaries of major developments.
	
	
What are the alternatives available to the company president?
	
7.	The production department is undergoing an upgrade of its automation program. 
It has a conflict that needs to be controlled and managed. The line supervisor 
wants to standardize on machines supplied by an American vendor, as his people 
will eventually use them. The automation team leader believes, on the other hand, 
that Swiss-made machines will result in greater productivity. Being a specialist 
in automation, she was brought into the department to find ways of significantly 
improving productivity.
	
	
The department head does not know what to do, as these two experts frequently 
fight in staff meetings. He regrets that he has not kept up with the automation 
technology to enable him to arbitrate and decide on the best way.
	
	
What should the department head do now?
	
8.	Two junior members of the production department unexpectedly come in to see 
you, the production director, to complain that their manager, who reports to you, 
commits discrimination, practices favoritism, and misuses company facilities for 
possible personal gain.
	
	
How would you handle this complaint?
	
9.	At present, the company is running at full capacity in developing a new product 
for a major customer. The sales director has unexpectedly secured a small, but 
highly profitable, order, which requires some low-level development work and a 
minor change to the current production process.
	
	
Should the company accept the small order? If so, how should the company 
satisfy the small order?
	 10.	Some foreign countries, particularly those in the early stages of industrial devel-
opment, are known to illegally copy product designs and technologies that origi-
nated from developed countries.
	
	
What are the best ways for small businesses to protect their technical know-
how in foreign countries?
	 11.	John Elrod founded the Elrod Manufacturing Company 50 years ago. Vernon Scott 
is the vice president of plant engineering, reporting to George Elrod, who took 
over as the company president from his father, John, five years ago. Vernon Scott 
and John Elrod have been good friends for many years. The company’s products 
include automotive parts (such as gears, axles, and transmissions), metal stamp-
ings, and sheet metal subassemblies.
	
	
Also reporting to George Elrod are six plant managers. Each plant has its sales, 
engineering, manufacturing, warehouse, and other functions. The plant manag-
ers are responsible for the profitability of the individual plants. The total employ-
ment of the company is 12,000 people.
	
	
The company has a standing policy on capital expenditure: expenditures below 
$5,000 are to be approved by plant managers, those between $5,000 and $50,000 by 
Vernon Scott, and those above $50,000 by the executive committee.

140
Engineering Management
	
	
Vernon Scott favors expenditures for machinery and equipment directly related 
to manufacturing, but not for maintenance, facility expansion, or improvements 
that are not related to manufacturing. Over the years, plant managers have become 
unhappy with Scott’s refusal of expenditures for nonmanufacturing equipment, 
such as computers. Forced to keep their plants profitable, they cannot help but 
bypass him by breaking down the nonmanufacturing projects into many small 
components, each below $5000.
	
	
Eventually, Vernon Scott finds out about the piecemeal purchase of a $27,000 
computer by Paul Nelson, a very capable plant manager whose plant has become 
the most profitable in the company. Scott demands that George Elrod fire Nelson, 
citing insubordination, cheating, and dishonesty.
	
	
What would you do if you were George Elrod?
	 12.	The manufacturing manager of Company X had installed a wage incentive pro-
gram. She happily reported six months later that the system was a success because 
production was up and unit costs were down. A quality control manager said, 
however, that the percentage of rejects had increased markedly and that this was 
creating a backlog of rework requirements. An industrial engineering manager 
reported that the expenditures for industrial engineering studies in the depart-
ment were up by 50%. An industrial relations manager said that arbitration fees 
resulting from incentive grievances had tripled.
	
	
Discuss your observations in this case. What should be done to correct the situ-
ation in this production department?

Section II
Business Essentials for 
Engineering Managers
Section  II covers the fundamentals of business, including cost accounting (Chapter  6), 
financial accounting and management (Chapter 7), and marketing management (Chapter 8). 
This section is to enable science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals 
and managers to facilitate their interactions within peer groups and units and to acquire a 
broadened perspective of the company business and its stakeholders.
Section II also prepares STEM professionals and managers to make decisions related 
to cost, finance, product, service, and capital budgets—discounted cash flow and internal 
rate of return analyses are reviewed. These discussions are of critical importance, as deci-
sions made during the product design phase typically determine up to 85% of the final 
costs of products. Activity-based costing (ABC) is presented to define indirect costs related 
to products and services. Economic value added (EVA) is addressed, which determines the 
real profitability of an enterprise above and beyond the cost of capital deployed.
Also discussed are capital formation through equity and debt financing, resource alloca-
tion concepts for assets in place, and option pricing for capital investment opportunities. 
By understanding the project evaluation criteria and the tools of financial analyses, STEM 
professionals and managers will be in a better position to secure project approvals. A 
critical step to developing technological projects is the acquisition and incorporation of 
customer feedback. For STEM professionals and managers to lead, a major challenge is the 
initiation, development, and implementation of major technological projects that contrib-
ute to the long-term profitability of the company.
The important roles and responsibilities of marketing in any profit-seeking enterprise 
are then introduced, along with the contributions expected of STEM professionals and 
managers to support the marketing effort. Many progressive enterprises are increasingly 
concentrating on customer relationship management to grow their businesses. Such a cus-
tomer orientation is expected to continue to serve as a key driving force for product design, 
project management, plant operation, manufacturing, customer service, and many other 
engineering-centered activities.

Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
6.1  Introduction
Cost control is a very important management function in both profit-seeking and non-
profit organizations.
A profit-seeking organization strives to maximize its financial gains (e.g., sales revenue 
minus costs) for its owners. These gains can be sustained over time only if all stakeholders 
of the firm (e.g., stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, and the 
community in which the firm operates) are reasonably satisfied. A nonprofit organization 
(e.g., the United Way, the Ford Foundation, government agencies, educational institutions, 
and church organizations) seeks to maximize its service value to its respective target recip-
ients while minimizing operations costs.
This chapter covers the basics of cost accounting. The discussions focus on the costing 
of products, although all cost accounting concepts are equally applicable to the costing of 
services (Vanderbeck and Mitchell 2015; Horngren et al. 2014; Bragg 2014). First, some com-
monly utilized accounting terms are introduced. Then, the cost analysis of a single period 
versus multiple periods is explained, leading to topics such as the time value of money and 
compound interest formulas. The costing of products follows, including the estimation 
of direct costs absorbed into the company’s inventory. The complex problem of assigning 
indirect costs to product/services is illustrated by the conventional method of using over-
head rates, as well as by the more sophisticated method of activity-based costing.
Estimation of costs with uncertainties is then presented. The Monte Carlo simulation is 
introduced as an effective method to account for cost uncertainties. Its superiority over the 
conventional estimation method, which uses deterministic data, is clearly demonstrated 
through examples of the output distribution functions of the Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, 
inventory accounting is addressed to arrive at the all-important cost of goods sold (CGS).
It is important for all engineering managers to become well versed in cost accounting. 
Cost control is a basic management task actively performed by all technology-based orga-
nizations, such as manufacturing, engineering, construction, product development, prod-
uct design, technology applications, and services.
6.2  Product or Service Costing
Product or service costing is one of the key responsibilities of managers, as the accurate 
computation of the CGS is of paramount importance to a product- or service-centered 
company (Ryan and Starmanns 2015).

146
Engineering Management
6.2.1  Cost of Goods Sold
Product costing in a product-centered company requires the computation of costs related 
to direct material (DM), direct labor (DL), and factory overhead (FO) for the following 
three operations:
•	 Raw materials (Stores)
•	 Work in progress (WIP)
•	 Finished goods (FG)
The following additional definitions are helpful:
Prime cost = DM + DL
Conversion cost = DL + FO
Indirect manufacturing cost = FO, also called factory burden. FO includes all costs 
other than DM and DL.
Typically, T-accounts are set up for the Stores, WIP, and FG operations.
A T-account is a tool used commonly by accountants to record transactions. As a conven-
tion, an increase in assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivables, inventories, land, and machines) 
is debited to the left side of the T-account. A decrease in assets is credited to the right side 
of the T-account. The opposite is true for liabilities and owners’ equities. For additional 
discussions on the use of T-accounts, see Section 7.10.1.

Explanations:
	
1.	Purchasing raw materials (an increase in assets).
	
2.	Putting materials into a production process (a reduction in stores assets).
	
3.	Production is initiated, adding value to raw materials, while consuming labor, 
materials, utilities, and other resources (assets are increased).
	
4.	Production is complete and units shipped out to FG operations (a reduction of 
WIP assets).
	
5.	Receiving of FG in storage (an increase of FG assets).
	
6.	FG are shipped out for sale (a reduction of FG assets).
Note that in the product costing schematic diagram, materials flow from left to right, 
whereas cash (financial resource) flows from right to left. The following illustrates a spe-
cific example of product costing:

g

h Te sum of ending balances in Stores, WIP, and FG represents inventory at the end 
of the accounting period.
In computing the CGS, the inclusion of materials and labor costs is rather straightfor-
ward, as these are direct costs, which are quite easy to track. The difficulty in product cost-
ing is the inclusion of indirect costs, namely the FO, as in the specific example illustrated. 
For manufacturing operations in which the FO represents a small fraction of the total 
product cost, the precision with which to allocate the indirect costs is practically irrel-
evant. However, in other circumstances, the allocation of indirect costs must be precise, 
especially when the FO becomes a major portion of the product cost and the plant facility 
generates multiple products.
6.2.2  Traditional Method of Allocating Indirect Costs
The traditional practice of general ledger costing involves estimating all overhead costs 
for the upcoming year in a single cost pool (e.g., FO, utilities, safety program, training, 
and salaries of foremen and factory managers). This total is then divided by the esti-
mated number of labor hours to be worked. The result is an hourly overhead rate. For 
each product, the required labor hours are estimated. The total overhead cost for the 
product is then equal to the required labor hours multiplied by the hourly overhead 
rate.
For example, let us assume that a factory has $800,000 in overhead (e.g., salary of 
manager, benefits, and other general charges), 2,000 direct hours per employee per 
year, and 20 employees. The hourly overhead rate is then $20 per hour (=  800,000/
(2,000 × 20)).
The major deficiency of this method of allocating indirect costs is that it does not reflect 
the true relationship between the indirect costs and the applicable cost object (such as 
products, services, and customers). Therefore, the allocation is often improper, as diverse 
types of overhead costs are lumped together, making an in-depth analysis impossible 
(Cooper and Kaplan 1988).
A better method of allocating indirect costs is activity-based costing (ABC), which is intro-
duced next.

148
Engineering Management
6.2.3  Activity-Based Costing
ABC is a cost accounting technique by which indirect and administrative support costs are 
traced to activities and processes and then to the cost objects (e.g., products, services, and 
customers) (Hicks 2002).
ABC is built on the notion that an organization has to perform certain activities in order 
to generate products and services. These activities cost money. The cost of each of these 
activities is only measured by and assigned to those products or services requiring iden-
tifiable activities and using appropriate assignment bases (called cost drivers). The results 
of ABC analyses offer a relatively more accurate picture of the real cost of each product 
or service, including the cost of serving customers. Nonactivity costs (such as DM, DL, or 
direct outside services) do not need to be included because these costs are readily attribut-
able to the specific product or service under consideration.
ABC is most useful for companies with diverse products, service centers, channels, and 
customers, and for those companies whose overhead costs represent a large percentage of 
their overall product and service costs (Maingi 2013; Moore 2012).
All managers should learn to practice ABC, because the traditional method of allocat-
ing overhead uses only high-level information about costs, and the general ledger system 
does not provide information related to time and resources spent on assignments and 
activities. In contrast, a well-practiced ABC method offers specific insights that include 
(a) a clearer picture for management of what generates profits and losses for the com-
pany; (b) the ability to track operating profits for specific cost objects (such as customers, 
orders, and products); (c) the ability to determine whether a service center is efficient or 
deficient; and (d) the possibility of identifying the relative profitability among µproducts 
and customers.
A company may lose money on some products, orders, and customers even with an 
overall documentable profitability, when the financial data are hidden in the absence 
of ABC. According to the published best practices of some industrial pioneers (such as 
Honeywell Inc. and Coca-Cola®) on the use of ABC, simpler ABC models deliver better 
results.
ABC has become increasingly popular with industrial companies, partly because it 
is useful for organizations of any size and does not require a massive effort to imple-
ment, and partly because of increased processing capabilities of personal computers (PCs), 
reduced prices for ABC software products, and increased competition forcing companies 
to achieve a better understanding of their own product costs. ABC software for Microsoft 
Excel is marketed by MrDashboard.com. There are also comprehensive ABC management 
tools on the market. Examples include: (1) Profitability and Cost Management (PCM) by 
SAP, (2) Hyperion Profitability and Cost Management (HPCM) by Oracle, and (3) SAP 
Activity-Based Cost Management by SAP.
6.2.4  Sequential Steps to Implementation of ABC
It is advisable to form a cross-functional team when implementing the ABC method of 
allocating indirect costs. The team should determine the cost objects. Examples of cost 
objects include costs to serve customer; costs to purchase, carry, and process products; 
costs to order, receive, sell, and deliver products; and costs to perform other activities. 
(Cokins 2001).
The team then needs to define activities that represent homogeneous groups of work 
(such as accounting, machining, forging, and design), which add value to the cost objects.

149
Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
Next to be determined are cost drivers. These are the agents that cause costs to be 
incurred in the activities, which in turn exert a direct impact on the cost of a given cost 
object. Examples of cost drivers are shown in Table 6.1.
The next step is to attribute activity costs to cost objects. The use of a flowchart for mod-
eling the process is recommended. The resulting information generated by ABC is useful 
as a basis for new management decisions.
6.2.5  Practical Tips for Performing ABC
When management initiates the process of creating an ABC system, it is practically useful 
to start with a small group (pilot group) of well-informed and cross-functional workers. 
The team should interview other workers about what they do in their jobs. The team mem-
bers should be cognizant of the potential fears of job restructuring that some employees 
may have as a result of the ABC studies.
The team should start with the “worst” department so that immediate success may be 
used to get faster “buy-in” from top management. The key for achieving ABC success is to 
use “close-enough” data, and keep the level of information manageable by avoiding being 
bogged down with minute details. On the other hand, an ABC system that is too broad 
and general will yield no useful results. The team may have to try out ABC cost models of 
different granularities on small scales. When applying ABC cost models for the very first 
time, useful outputs can be expected in 6–12 months. Illustrative examples for creating an 
ABC cost model are shown in the next section.
6.3  Application of ABC in Industry
6.3.1  Application: Manufacturing Operations
XYZ is a small manufacturing company with $10 million in annual sales. It makes compo-
nents for the automotive industry, involving the key production processes of forging and 
machining. Its product-related operating activities are as follows:
	
1.	Buying steel bars from outside vendors.
	
2.	Testing steel bars on receipt and moving them to storage.
	
3.	Sending the bars to the forging area when needed for a customer order, at which 
point they are sandblasted and cut to desired lengths. Since most of the bars are 
large, they are then moved in bins that hold 20–25 pieces.

4.	Sizing the bars and moving them to a forging station where they are shaped. The 
bars are then moved to the in-process storage. In some cases, a steel bar may need 
to be forged up to three times.
	
5.	Transferring the bars for each forging procedure from in-process storage to the 
forging station and then back to the in-process storage.
	
6.	Moving the steel bars after the final forging from the in-process storage to the 
machining station where they are finished. The bars are then sent to the finished-
goods storage.
	
7.	Sorting, packing, and loading the bars is done in the shipping area and onto trucks 
for delivery to customers.
Before using ABC, the company applied the traditional costing method that included 
the following steps: (1) Assign manufacturing costs to products by using a plantwide cost-
ing rate on the basis of DL. The setup costs are included in the manufacturing overhead. 
(2) Assign the nonmanufacturing costs to products via a general and administrative (G&A) 
rate that is calculated as a percentage of the total cost. (3) Define the DL rate and the G&A 
rate on the basis of the actual results obtained for the preceding year. The deficiencies of 
the traditional method are obvious. The traditional method is used because management 
does not see a need for change.
When implementing ABC, the company did not buy any ABC-specific software. Instead, 
they used a standard Excel spreadsheet program. Typically, the company considered the 
following factors:
	
1.	Setup costs: Management assigned equipment setup costs only to the steel bars in 
a given equipment process.
	
2.	Forging costs: Depending on the weight of the steel bar involved, one or two opera-
tors may operate the forging press. Prior to forging, each steel bar must be induc-
tion heated, with the heating cost being dependent on the mass of the bar involved. 
Thus, the forging cost consists of three parts:
	
a.	 Press-operating costs on the basis of forging press usage (in hours).
	
b.	 Production labor cost on the basis of labor hours spend.
	
c.	 Induction-heating costs on the basis of the steel bar’s weight
	
3.	Machining costs: The machining centers do not require full-time operators. Once 
the machines are set up, workers load and unload parts for multiple centers. On 
average, one machine-worker hour is required for every two and a half machine 
hours. Thus, the costs of machine-shop workers are treated as the indirect costs 
assigned to products on the basis of machine hours.
	
4.	Material movement costs: Depending on the size of the bar, the bin size, and the 
required forging and machining steps, the material movement cost could vary sig-
nificantly from one bar to another. Thus, the material movement cost is assigned to 
each bar on the cost-per-move basis.
	
5.	Raw material procurement and order processing costs: These are readily traceable on 
the basis of records on hand.
The ABC cost model for the XYZ manufacturing company is illustrated in Table 6.2.

151

It produced cost data of an increasingly detailed nature regarding the production cost 
for various customer contracts. These insights allowed management to define a more 
profitable mix of contracts generated by a pricing and quoting process that more closely 
reflects the actual cost structure of the company. Particularly useful are the isolation and 
measurement of material movement costs that result in operational changes for increased 
efficiency. The final results of ABC implementation are impressive. The company’s sales 
tripled and its profit increased fivefold after having implemented new operational strate-
gies based on new outcomes of the ABC study.
6.3.2  Application: Banking and Financial Services
Buckeye National Bank (Bamber and Hughes 2001) services both retail and business 
customers. The services include paying checks, providing teller services, and respond-
ing to customers’ service calls. All of these services consume labor-intensive activities. 
The resources involved are employees (salary and benefits), part-time workers, and those 
related to the operation of service call centers. The bank’s traditional costing system 
suggests that it is more profitable for the bank to pursue more retail customers and that 
business customers bring losses. As a result, the bank’s retail customers grow, while the

business customers remain stable. Yet, the bank’s profit is trending downward. Bank man-
agement becomes puzzled as to the reasons why.
A large number of cost data were made available from the banks’ traditional accounting 
system. Tables 6.3 and 6.4 display these data.
The solution obtained based on the traditional costing system is shown in Table 6.5. It 
indicates that the annual profit of the retail account is $8.10 whereas that of the business 
account shows a loss of $11.30. The logic of pursuing more retail customers appear to be 
correct.
An ABC pilot study was initiated to define (1) the percentage of time each employee 
spends on the aforementioned three activities; and (2) costs associated with toll-free phone 
lines, depreciation of equipment used for paying checks, and providing teller services. The 
cost drivers were identified to be (1) the number of checks processed for the paying check 
activity, (2) the number of teller transactions for the activity related to providing teller 
service, and (3) the number of calls received for activity related to responding to customer 
inquiries.

Table 6.6 summarizes the unit cost of the three activities. Table 6.7 shows the cost assign-
ments and the per account cost. In fact, the retail accounts are shown to lose money, indi-
cating that the bank policy of pursuing retail customers was based on an incorrect costing 
data.
6.4  Risk Analysis and Cost Estimation under Uncertainty
When estimating costs for products and services, some part of these costs are well defined 
and firm, while others are not. Similarly, some projects in engineering based on past expe-
rience are risk free, while others are not. Risks are defined as a measure of the potential 
variability of an outcome (e.g., cost or schedule) from its expected value. Risks must be 
properly accounted for in projects (Ayyub 2014; Cox 2015).
6.4.1  Representation of Risks
Risks can be graphically represented by a probability distribution function. Three cases 
are examined next.
Figure 6.1 shows that the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury bills has varied in the range of 8% 
(1990) to below 4% (2002). But once an investor purchases the Treasury bills from the U.S. 
government, the yield is locked in until maturity. Such an investment is guaranteed by 
the assets of the U.S. government. This return is graphically represented by a vertical line 
at a fixed return rate (6% assumed in this example) with 100% probability (see Figure 6.2, 
Case 1).
Case 2 is an investment in a blue-chip corporate stock with a most likely return of 
8%. Due to market conditions being usually unpredictable, the return of such an invest-
ment has some measure of risk, as represented by the bell-shaped curve centered on 8%

in Figure 6.2. The return may vary from 4% (minimum) to 12% (maximum). Risks are 
measured by the standard deviation of this probability distribution curve (e.g., σ2) (see

Case 3 is the return of an investment in real estate, centered, for example, around 15%. 
Because this investment requires tax payment, maintenance costs, and other expenditures, 
its minimum return may be negative. Its upside potential may be very large, however, 
if commercial developments and property-zoning results become favorable. This case is 
represented by a bell-shaped probability curve having a large standard deviation (σ3 being 
larger than σ2) and with its most likely return centered around 15%. Furthermore, the 
probability of achieving its most likely return of 15% is now only 50% (see Figure 6.2.).
Risky events may be represented mathematically by the Normal probability density 
function, which is defined by two parameters, standard deviation and mean. Besides the 
Normal, several other probability density functions (such as Triangular, Poisson, and Beta) 
may also be used to represent risky costs (see Section 6.4.3).
6.4.2  Project Cost Estimation by Simulation
Recent literature outlines the advancements of PC-based techniques that estimate project 
costs under uncertainty (Zio 2012; Gupta 2013). The key elements of these PC-based tech-
niques consist of the following steps:
	
1.	Construct a cost model for the projects at hand with a spreadsheet program (e.g., 
Excel) (Bodnar and Hopwood 2012). The spreadsheet program takes care of the 
required computation of the cost model, such as addition, subtraction, multipli-
cation, and division. The numerical values entered in the spreadsheet cells are 
typically deterministic, each having a well-defined and fixed magnitude. The cost 
model encompasses all cost components and computes the total project cost.
	
2.	Make a three-point estimate for each of the component costs, composed of the mini-
mum, the most likely, and the maximum values. This is to account for the per-
ceived-cost uncertainty. Past experience may serve as a guide in the selection of 
these values.
	
	
Select a probability distribution function (e.g., Triangular, Normal, Beta, or 
other distribution functions) to represent the three-point estimate of the compo-
nent cost. Repeat this step for all other cost components of the project.
	
3.	Activate risk analysis software to replace the deterministic values contained in the 
spreadsheet cells by the probability distribution functions chosen to represent the 
corresponding three-point estimates.
	
	
Currently, commercial PC-based software products are readily available. Some 
examples are
	
a.	 CrystalBall® for Excel (Charnes 2012), see Crystal Ball software at www.oracle.
com
	
b.	 @Risk (Version 6) and BestFit programs (Palisade Corp.) for Excel spreadsheet 
(Nersesian 2011)
	
	
The BestFit program marketed by Palisade Corporation may be used to define 
a suitable probability distribution function on the basis of numerical three-point 
estimates or other user-specified input data.
	
	
The activated risk analysis software automatically converts all input prob-
ability density functions to their corresponding cumulative distribution func-
tions. The technical fundamentals related to this conversion are illustrated in 
Appendix 6.I.

4.	Conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to compute the total project cost. Upon activa-
tion of risk analysis software, a random number is first generated between 0 and 
1. This random number represents a trial probability value (e.g., P1). Using this 
random number, the specific cost value is read from the cumulative distribution 
of the cost component C1, which represents a random input variable (e.g., C11, 
see Figure 6.3). A second random number is generated (P2), which is then used to 
define the cost of the cost component C2 (e.g., C21). A third random number is gen-
erated to define the cost C31 of a third cost component. This process is continued 
until the costs of all cost components are defined. The total project cost (e.g., TPC1) 
is then calculated with the spreadsheet program that contains the cost model. This 
is one outcome of the random output variable TPC.
	
	
This sampling process is repeated thousands of times to create a distribution 
of the total project costs (e.g., TPC1, TPC2). These output results are then statisti-
cally grouped into bins (with zero to maximum value) to come up with a cumu-
lative distribution. The resulting cumulative distribution for the total project 
cost TPC may then be converted back to its corresponding probability density 
function.
	
	
The total project cost so generated has a set of minimum, most likely, and maxi-
mum values.

5.	Interpret the total project cost represented in a cumulative distribution to arrive at 
the following typical results:
	
a.	 There is an 80% probability that the total project cost will not exceed $D.
	
b.	 The minimum, most likely, and maximum total project costs are $A, $B, and 
$C.
	
c.	 The standard deviation of the total project cost is x, or the overall measure of 
the project risk.
Information of this type is extremely useful for decision-making. It is particularly true in 
situations where multiple projects are being evaluated for investment purposes.
There is an additional benefit realized by using the just-described cost estimation by 
simulation. Because of the “risk pooling” effect, due to risk sharing among all input cost 
components, the total project cost is expected to have a lower overall risk than the risk lev-
els of its individual components. Various studies (e.g., Canada et al. 2004), have confirmed 
that the total project cost computed by simulations requires a smaller contingency cost for 
a given risk level than that computed by the traditional method by using deterministic 
values.
Other important applications involving risk analyses include (1) project schedule and 
(2) portfolio optimization.
Risk analyses are capable of making explicit the uncertainties of input variables, promot-
ing more reasoned estimating procedures, allowing more comprehensive analyses—or 
the simultaneous variation of all input variables involved—and measuring the variability 
of output variables. Having a fuller understanding of the risk-based implications of the 
decision will enable a decision-maker to make better decisions.
The use of risk analysis in the business and engineering environments is expected to 
become increasingly widespread in the years to come. Managers are advised to become 
familiar with such advanced tools for risk analyses.
6.4.3  Examples of Input Distribution Functions
In engineering cost estimation, several distribution functions are often used as inputs. 
Figure 6.4 shows the Triangular probability density function. This is the easiest function 
to apply, as the three-point estimates may be directly incorporated into this representation.
Figure 6.5 illustrates the Normal probability function. Figure 6.6 displays the Beta prob-
ability density function. Figure 6.7 depicts the Poisson probability function.

6.4.4  Application: Cost Estimation of a Risky Capital Project
Capital projects are those encompassing the design, procurement, installation, and testing 
of major equipment, including the proper preparation of foundation and the activation of 
the required instrumentation system. Capital projects may be found in many industries. 
This section shows the cost estimation for a turnkey capital project (Table 6.8).
Typically, project managers define the base (e.g., the most likely) estimates, as well as 
the lower and upper bounds for each cost item in the estimate. Doing so will force them to 
externalize the reasons for any variance that may be expected and require them to think 
hard in preparing the contingency plans for each.
The output total cost is represented by the probability density and cumulative distribu-
tion functions (see Figures 6.8 and 6.9).
From the output cumulative distribution, the following results are readily obtained:
	
1.	The most likely total project cost is $5,136,000, which, of course, only echoes the 
input data.
	
2.	There is an 80% probability that the project cost will exceed $5,100,000.
	
3.	There is a 20% probability that the project cost will exceed $5,170,000.
	
4.	The maximum project cost is $5,250,000.
	
5.	The minimum project cost is $4,989.71.
Note that the information offered by items B, C, D, and E is new. In a traditional, deter-
ministic project cost estimate, the cost figures for items A, D, and E would be the same,

and there would be no information of the kind offered by items B and C. When choosing 
among various projects that may have similar outcomes in the most likely project costs, 
information offered by items B and C is especially useful in differentiating projects by 
their inherent risks.
For construction managers, the estimation of contingency is of critical importance. 
Instead of assigning specific contingencies as a percentage to each cost category items, the 
simulation described in this section calculates the contingency cost of the entire construc-
tion project. Probabilistic models have been used in the past to define construction project 
contingency (Cook 2012).
In addition, project control and tracking of coefficient of variation can be readily con-
ducted (see Figures 6.10 and 6.11). The coefficient of variation is defined as CV = 100 (σ/µ), 
wherein σ is the standard deviation and µ is the mean of the total project cost distribution 
function.

6.4.5  Other Techniques to Account for Risks
Several other techniques are also routinely applied in industry to assess and manage the 
risks associated with projects:
	
1.	Sensitivity analysis: Because of possible variation of specific input parameters, 
“what-if” analyses are typically performed to assess the sensitivity of the project 
cost and time to completion (Saltelli et al. 2009).
	
2.	Contingency cost estimation: The cost of a risky project may be estimated by adding 
a contingency cost to each task (typically 5%–7% of the task cost) to cover the risk 
involved (Downs 2013). These specific percentage numbers are selected based on 
industrial best practices.
	
3.	Decision trees: Decision trees are used to evaluate sequential decisions and decide 
on alternatives on the basis of the expected values of probabilistic outcomes 
(Stevens 2014).
	
4.	Diversification: With this risk management technique, several risky projects 
can be engaged in at the same time to spread the risks by means of 
diversification—combining high-risk, high-return projects with low-risk, low-
return projects—to achieve a reasonable overall return on investment (Hull 2014; 
Badea and Grigorescu 2014).

5.	Fuzzy logic systems: These systems of reasoning are based on fuzzy sets (Ross 2010; 
Nguyen and Walker 2005). A fuzzy set defines the range of values for a given con-
cept as well as the degree of membership. A membership of 1 indicates full mem-
bership, whereas 0 defines exclusion. The change of membership from 0 to 1 is 
gradual. For example, a fuzzy expert system employs rules such as the following:
If the temperature T is high (Ai) and the difference in temperature is small (Bi), then close 
the valve V slightly (Si), wherein Ai, Bi, and Si are fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic systems have been 
applied to assess project risks (Trilla 2015).
Example 6.1
The company needs to decide either to develop a new product with an investment of 
$400,000 or to upgrade an existing product by spending $200,000, as illustrated by the 
decision point 1 in Figure 6.12.
	
1.	 If the new product strategy is pursued, then there is a 60% probability that 
the product will be in high demand, in which case the company will make 
$200,000 next year. Concurrently, there is a 40% chance for low demand, which 
will result in a loss of $100,000 for the company next year (see Node A in the 
decision tree diagram in Figure 6.12).
	
	
If the new product enjoys a high demand, then there is an 80% chance that 
the product will earn $1,000,000 and a 20% chance it will earn only $50,000 in 
the year after the next (see Node a in Figure 6.12). If the new product meets a 
low demand, then there is a 30% chance for a revenue of $500,000 and a 70%

chance of suffering a loss of $500,000 in the year after next (see Node b in 
Figure 6.12).
	
2.	 If the company follows the strategy of improving the existing product, then 
there is a 60% chance of high demand, leading to a revenue of $100,000; and a 
40% chance of low demand, to yield zero revenue in the first year (see Node B 
in Figure 6.12).
If the demand is high at the end of the first year, the company needs to make a second 
decision (Decision Point 2) whether or not to expand the product line. The expansion 
option will require a new investment of $100,000, whereas the option of no expansion 
costs nothing. If the company expands the improved product line, then there is an 80% 
chance that it will reap a revenue of $800,000 and a 20% chance of $100,000 revenue in 
the year after the next (see Node c in Figure 6.12). If the company elects not to expand at 
the end of the first year, then there is an 80% chance it will realize a revenue of $400,000 
and a 20% chance of $200,000 revenue (see Node d in Figure 6.12).
Should the improved product of the company see a low demand (at a probability of 
40%) and get zero revenue in the first year, then there is a 30% chance that the prod-
uct can generate revenue of $300,000 and a 70% chance of zero revenue (see Node e in 
Figure 6.12).
The interest rate is 10%. This problem is fully diagrammed in Figure 6.12. Determine 
which decisions at Decision Points 1 (product strategy) and 2 (expansion strategy) the 
company should make.
Answer 6.1
This problem can be solved by using the decision tree method, which works from right 
to left, from future (the year after next) to present.

Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
6.5  Miscellaneous Topics
This section discusses several miscellaneous topics, including economic quantity of order-
ing, simple cost-based decision models, and project evaluation criteria.
6.5.1  Economic Quantity of Ordering
The procurement costs of parts, materials, and other supply items directly affects total 
product costs. The ordering process must take into account the quantity needed, purchase 
price, order processing fees, shipping costs, and the time value of money. Managers may 
need to know how to arrive at the economic quantity of ordering in order to minimize the 
total cost of procurement. The next example illustrates this concept.
Example 6.2
A manufacturing company buys 6000 steel bars a year at a fixed price of $18 each. It 
costs the company $85 to process and place each order. Assuming 10% interest com-
pounded annually, what is the most economic quantity to order at one time?

6.5.2  Simple Cost-Based Decision Models
Engineering managers need to make regular choices among alternatives. In some cases, 
such choices may be made based on costs, as illustrated by the following two examples 
(Mehta 2015).
	
1.	Comparison of alternatives: When faced with the option of purchasing one of sev-
eral sets of capital equipment with similar functional characteristics, engineering 
managers can use the following annual cost formula to identify which has the 
lowest total annual cost.
	
	
The annual cost for a long-lived asset is defined as the sum of its depreciation 
charge, interest charge for the capital tied down by the purchase, and its annual 
operational expenses; that is,

where:
	 P =	Initial investment (dollars)
	 N =	Useful life of a long-lived asset (years)
	 L =	Salvage value (dollars)
	
i =	Interest rate (percent)
	AE =	Annual expenses (dollars)—taxes, supplies, insurance repairs, utilities, etc.
	AC =	Annual cost (dollars)
	
	
The capital equipment with the lowest AC is preferable. (The derivation of both 
the approximate and exact methods is shown in Appendix 6.H)
Example 6.3
Your company has averaged 15% growth per year for the past seven years, and now 
you need additional warehouse space for purchased material as well as FG. Two types 
of construction have been under consideration: conventional and air-supported fabric. 
(The data are available in Table 6.9.)

Example 6.4
A semiautomatic machine is quoted at $15,000, while an advanced machine is quoted at 
$25,000. The salvage value of these machines is assumed to be zero. A four-man party 
can produce 500 parts a day with the semiautomatic machine, by using a machinist at 
$200 per day, a maintenance worker at $150 per day, a parts laborer at $100 per day, and 
a warehouse clerk at $80 per day.
A six-man party can produce 770 parts a day with the advanced machine, using a 
machinist at $200 per day, an assistant machinist at $180 per day, a maintenance worker 
at $150 per day, two parts laborers at $100 per day each, and a warehouse clerk at $80 
per day.
Material cost is $10 per part. The FO is 50% of the DL cost, only when parts are being 
produced. Maintenance expense for the semiautomatic machine is $250 per year, and 
for the advanced machine is $500 per day. The estimated life of the semiautomatic 
machine is 20 years, and 15 for the advanced machine. The cost of money is 8% per 
year.
How many parts must be made per year to justify the procurement of the advanced 
machine?
Answer 6.4
Define x = number of parts produced per year
y = number of working days to produce parts
For the semiautomatic machine: y = x/500
For the advanced machine, y = x/770 (see Table 6.10).

2.	Replacement evaluation: Engineering managers are sometimes faced with the deci-
sion of whether to replace an existing facility with a brand-new one. Again, this 
replacement decision may be made by identifying the option with the lowest 
annual cost.
In this analysis, the existing facility is treated as if it is new, in that its residual equip-
ment life and its residual book value (initial capital investment minus accumulated 
depreciation) are equivalent, respectively, to the useful product life and the capital 
investment cost of new equipment. Thus,

If ACo is larger than AC, it is recommended to use the replacement equipment to 
save costs.
Example 6.5
A compressor air-supply station was built 18 years ago at the main shaft entrance to a 
coalmine at a cost of $2.6 million. The station was equipped with steam-driven air com-
pressors that have an annual operating expense of $360,000. The salvage value at the 
estimated 25-year life of the station is $130,000. It can be sold now for $800,000.
A proposal has been made to replace the station with electrically driven compressors 
that would be installed underground near the working face of the mine for a cost of $2.8 
million. The new compressor station would have a life of 30 years and a salvage value of 
10%. Its annual operating cost would be two-thirds of the steam-driven station. Annual 
taxes and insurance are 2.5% of the first cost of either station. The interest rate is 8% per 
year. Is there a financial justification to replace the steam station?
Answer 6.5

6.5.3  Project Evaluation Criteria
Managers are often required to make choices among capital projects that may deliver 
benefits and may also consume resources on an annual basis over a number of periods. 
Several standard methods are used in industry to evaluate such projects (Eriona and 
Nguyen 2013). These include net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback 
(PB), and profitability index (PI).

= 1 to
	
where:
	
NPV =	Net present value (dollars)
	
P =	Present investment made to initiate a project activity (dollars)
	NCIF(m) =	Net cash inflow (dollars) in the period m, which represents revenues 
earned minus costs incurred = (R(m) – C(m)) (dollars)
	
i =	Cost of capital (interest) rate (fraction)
	
n =	Number of interest period (year)
	
CR =	Capital recovery (dollars), which is the amount regained at the end of the 
project through resale or other methods of disposition
	
	
Note that the first term on the right-hand side is the capital outlay for the proj-
ect, or an outflow of value (cash). The second term on the right-hand side is the 

171
Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
sum of discounted net cash inflow earned over the years. The third term on the 
right-hand side is the discounted capital recovery of the project.
	
	
One major weakness of the NPV equation is that all benefits derived from a 
project must be expressed in dollar equivalents—within NCIF(m)—in order to be 
included. Nonmonetary benefits, such as enhanced corporate image, expanded 
market share, and others, cannot be represented.

Projects with the largest NPV values are preferable, as NPV represents the net 
total value added (before tax) to the firm by the project at hand. Note that NPV 
may be determined only if the project’s net cash inflow NCIF(m) is known.
	
2.	Internal rate of return. Rate of return is generally defined as the earnings realized 
by a project in a percentage of its principal capital.
	
	
The IRR is the average rate of return (usually annual) realized by a project in 
which the total net cash inflow is exactly balanced with its total net cash outflow, 
resulting in zero NPV value at the end of its project life cycle. In other words, this 
is the rate realizable when reinvestment of the project earnings is made at the 
same rate until maturity.
	
	
IRR is determined by the following equations:

The IRR values (before tax) of acceptable projects must be much greater than 
the firm’s cost of capital. Projects with high IRR are preferable.
	
3.	Payback period. The PB is defined as the number of years that the original capital 
investment for the project will take to be paid back by its annual earnings, or

(6.9)
	
where:

Example 6.6
Your company is currently pursuing three cost reduction projects at the same time.
•	 Project A requires an investment of $10 million. It is expected to yield a cost 
savings of $30 million in the first year and another $10 million in the second 
year.
•	 Project B demands an investment of $5 million. It is expected to produce a cost 
savings of $5 million in the first year and another $20 million in the second 
year.
•	 Project C needs an investment of $5 million. It is expected to bring about a cost 
savings of $5 million in the first year and another $15 million in the second 
year.
After the second year, there will be no receivable benefit or capital recovery from any 
of these projects. The cost of capital (interest rate) is 10% per year.
Determine the ranking of these projects on the basis of the evaluation criteria of NPV, 
IRR, PB, and PI.

6.6  Conclusions
This chapter reviews basic cost accounting issues related to product and service costing. 
Product/service costs have direct and indirect cost components. While direct costs are 
relatively easy to assess, the indirect costs that account for overhead charges related to 
facility, management, utilities, and others may need to be properly assessed by using tools 
such as ABC. This is especially true for the cases in which multiple products/services are 
produced and marketed to different customer groups each demanding special customiza-
tion efforts, and the resulting overhead charge represents a significant percentage of the 
overall product/service costs. For enterprises with a single product/service and a minor 
amount of overhead charge relative to its total product/service cost, the traditional method 
of estimating the overhead charge is usually sufficient.
All production activities add value but create cost. ABC is a cost accounting method that 
redistributes indirect cost (incurred in producing product/service) in accordance with the 
specific production activities involved. Conducting an ABC cost study will not increase or 
decrease company profitability. However, when applied properly, the ABC method will 
generate cost-based insights, which could form a new basis for companies to take manage-
ment action, such as changing the product/service mix, simplifying a specific production 
process, and/or revising pricing policies in order to more directly account for the activities 
needed to respond to customer demands. Company profits are expected to improve after 
such new management actions are effectively implemented.
Cost data may apply for a single period or for multiple periods. In the case of multiple 
periods, the time dependency of cost data must be considered, and the concept of the 

174
Engineering Management
time value of money and the compound interest formulas are to be applied. Depreciation 
accounting affects the facility costs that are part of the indirect costs of products/services. 
Different depreciation methods will lead to more or less indirect costs for the products/
services. Finally, the inventory costs are affected by the sequence in which products are 
introduced or withdrawn. As engineering economy foundation topics, all these concepts 
have been reviewed in the appendices.
Cost data may be uncertain because of factors related to the economy, market condition, 
political stability, labor movement, and others. For uncertain cost data, risk analysis may 
be needed. The Monte Carlo simulation is an efficacious method to conduct risk analyses. 
Several other methods are also available to account for cost uncertainties.
David Rockefeller said, “Success in business requires training, discipline and hard 
work. But, if you’re not frightened by these things, the opportunities are just as great today 
as they ever were.” ABC is an example of such value-adding opportunities, which were 
developed due to discipline and hard work.
Managers need to become well versed in cost accounting.
Questions
	
1.	The company is evaluating two specific proposals to market a new product. The 
current interest rate is 10%.
	
	
Proposal A calls for setting up an in-house manufacturing shop to make 
the product, requiring an investment of $500,000. The expected profits for 
the first to fifth years are $150,000, $200,000, $250,000, $150,000, and $100,000, 
respectively.
	
	
Proposal B suggests that the manufacturing operation be outsourced by con-
tracting an outside shop, requiring a front-end payment of $300,000. The expected 
profits for the first to fifth years are $50,000, $150,000, $200,000, $300,000, and 
$200,000, respectively. The expected profits would be lower in earlier years due to 
third-party markup.
	
	
Which proposal should the company accept?
	
2.	The company’s warehouse has been busy taking in and shipping out vendor-
supplied automotive parts. Table 6.13 shows the warehouse’s activities in eight con-
secutive periods, during which time the price of the parts has steadily increased.

a.	 Determine the total LIFO prices for each stock withdrawal in periods 3, 4, 6, 
and 8.
	
b.	 Repeat the same price computation using the FIFO technique.
	
3.	A dam is being considered on a river that periodically overflows. Each time 
the river overflows, it causes about $600,000 in damages. The project horizon is 
40 years. A 10% interest rate is being used.
	
	
Three different designs are available, each with different costs and storage 
capacities (see Table 6.14).
	
	
The U.S. weather service has provided a statistical analysis of annual rainfall in 
the area draining into the river (see Table 6.15).
	
	
Assume that the dam requires no annual maintenance, has zero salvage value 
at the end of its 40-year life, and is essentially empty at the start of each annual 
rainfall season. Which design alternative would you choose?

6.	A company makes and sells three technology products: A, B, and C. It has a pro-
duction plant with 17,000 square feet of floor area, consisting of machine setup 
(2000 square feet), machining operation (9000 square feet), assembly (4000 square 
feet), and inspection, packaging, and shipping activities (2000 square feet).
	
	
The total annual expenditure for the plant is $200,000 for depreciation, $700,000 
for utilities, $20,000 for phone and travel services, $150,000 for manufacturing sup-
ports, $200,000 for procurement, and $150,000 for supervision.
	
	
The labor hours and material costs required to manufacture the products are 
shown in Table 6.17.
	
	
The labor charges are $25 per hour for machine setup, $35 per hour for machin-
ing operation, $30 per hour for assembly, and $20 per hour for inspection, packing, 
and shipping.
	
	
The company plans to sell Product A at $5000 per unit, Product B at $4,500 per 
unit, and Product C at $4,100 per unit. All products manufactured during the year

7.	You are considering a good-looking Toyota hybrid car priced at $28,000 or an ele-
gant GM luxury car at $24,000. The fuel efficiency is rated at 50 miles per gallon for 
the Toyota and 25 miles per gallon for the GM. The annual maintenance cost for 
both cars is about 0.5% of the car price. The gasoline in the local market is selling 
at $2.00 per gallon. The cars are to be driven about 10,000 miles per year. You plan 
to keep your car for five years only. At the end of the fifth year, the resale values 
of the Toyota and the GM are about 40% and 30%, respectively, of their original 
prices. The interest rate is 6%.
	
	
Which car is the better choice from the standpoint of costs?
	
8.	Company X manufactures automotive door panels that may be made of either 
sheet metal or plastic sheet molding (glass fiber-reinforced polymer). Sheet metal 
bends well to the high-volume stamping process and has a low material cost. 
Plastic sheet molding meets the required strength and corrosion resistance and 
has a lower weight. The plastic-forming process involves a chemical reaction and 
has a slower cycle time. Table 6.18 summarizes the cost components for each.
	
	
Assuming that the machinery and tooling have no salvage value at the end 
of their respective equipment lives, what is the annual production volume that 
would make the plastic panel more economical?
	
	
For production volume up to 536,156 panels per year, the plastic panels are more 
economical.
	
9.	Company X produces two products, A and B. Table  6.19 summarizes the cost 
structures of these two products over a three-month period.

	 12.	Employee A is about to retire. Based on his long tenure with the company, he is 
entitled to use his unused sick leave to pay for health insurance upon retirement. 
His current sick leave benefit is estimated to be worth $3156 annually. The health 
insurance premium is estimated to be $2532 per year for family coverage and $588 
for single coverage, and these rates are projected to increase by 3% per year into 
the future. He has two options.
	
	
Option one is to take the full amount of $3156 now, which will continue during his 
lifetime. Afterwards, his spouse will need to pay for the single coverage premium 
out of her own pocket. He will receive no refund from the company, even though his 
sick leave benefit ($3156) exceeds the family coverage premium ($2532) initially.
	
	
Option two is to take only 70% of the full amount ($2,209) during his lifetime, 
and this benefit is guaranteed to continue beyond his death to cover the health 
insurance premium for the spouse, should the spouse survive him.
	
	
Currently, Employee A is 73 years old and has a life expectancy of 11 more 
years. His spouse is 70 and her life expectancy is 18 years. Assume the cost of 
money is 4%, which option is better for Employee A and his spouse?

profitability analysis, and managerial decision-making. While the cost accounting systems 
used by various firms do not need to strictly follow the generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAPP) adopted by the financial accounting profession, company managers are 
still advised to understand the meaning of various accounting terms in order to ensure 
that their cost-based decisions are made properly. The following is a general set of account-
ing terms used by many firms (Smith 2014; Ryder Management Inc. 2014):
	
1.	Cost center: An organizational unit that accomplishes well-defined functional 
objectives in support of others (e.g., R&D, procurement, finance, operations, legal 
services, and public relations). The operating budgets of cost centers are autho-
rized by profit centers.
	
2.	Profit center: An organizational unit whose functional objectives are related to the 
profitability generation in a company (e.g., business management, product design 
and development, engineering, marketing/sales, and customer services).
	
3.	Inventory costs: The total sum of product costs, which are composed of the direct 
costs and indirect costs related to the manufacturing of the products/services 
involved.
	
4.	Direct costs: Materials and labor costs associated with the manufacturing of a 
product/service.
	
5.	Indirect costs: All overhead costs (e.g., rent, procurement, depreciation, supervision, 
supplies, and power) indirectly associated with the production of products/ser-
vices involved.
	
6.	Fixed costs: Costs that do not strictly vary with the volume of products/services 
involved, such as the general manager’s salary, rent for the facility, machine depre-
ciation charges, and local taxes.
	
7.	Variable costs: Costs that vary in proportion to the volume of products/services 
involved, including, for example, material, labor, and utilities.
	
8.	Step function costs: Costs that would experience a step change when a specific 
production volume is exceeded; for example, the factory rent that may change 
stepwise if new floor space must be added because of the increased production 
volume.
	
9.	Contribution margin: The product price minus unit variable cost; the economic 
value contributed by selling one unit of product/service to defray the fixed cost 
already committed for the current production facility.
	 10.	Cost pool: An organizational unit where costs incurred by its activities performed 
for specific products/services (or other cost targets) are accumulated for subse-
quent assignments.
	 11.	Cost drivers: Bases used to allocate indirect costs to products/services. The produc-
tion of products/services drives the consumption of resources, and the utilization 
of resources incurs costs. Examples include floor space, head counts, number of 
transactions, number of employees, labor hours, machine hours, number of set-
ups, and material weight.
	 12.	Cost objects: Targets (such as product, service, customers, etc.), to which indirect 
costs are to be allocated.
	 13.	Budget: A quantitative expression in dollar value of a project or a plan of action. 
Examples include production budget, product design budget, engineering budget, 

181
Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
R&D budget, sales budget, marketing budget, and advertising budget. Typically, 
budgets are specified for a specific period of time (e.g., a month, a quarter, or a year).
	 14.	Standard costs: Direct and indirect costs budgeted for products. The standard costs 
are defined by using estimations or historical costs.
	 15.	Variance: The difference between standard costs and actual costs. Such variance 
could be the result of price variation, quantity change, technology advancement, 
and other factors. Conventionally, actual quantities are used when computing 
price variation to easily assess the procurement performance. On the other hand, 
the quantity-based variance is computed by using standard costs for an easy 
assessment of the production performance.
	 16.	Current costs: Costs for the total efforts (e.g., physical efforts, raw materials, and 
service fees) that must be spent in order to carry out an activity or implement a 
plan. Current costs form a key basis for managerial decision-making.
	 17.	Opportunity costs: The benefit of the second-best alternative that must be forgone 
because of a commitment made to the first alternative. For example, a STEM pro-
fessional who quits a job paying $100,000 a year to pursue a three-semester MBA 
degree at a university incurs an opportunity cost at graduation of $150,000 plus 
an out-of-pocket cost of $90,000 for tuition fees. Opportunity costs are included in 
managerial decision-making, but are not included in any cost accounting system.
	 18.	Sunk costs: Costs that have already been spent or incurred. Such costs are typically 
included in all cost accounting systems, but they are not considered in any man-
agement decision-making for the future.
Appendix 6.B:  Cost Analysis
Managers perform variance analyses and study the reasons for the deviation of actual 
costs from standard costs. They issue periodic and systematic reports of their findings and 
take proper actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organizational units 
as related to cost control (Kemp 2015; McGuire 2015).
There are two major factors affecting cost analysis, namely, time and accuracy. For man-
agement decisions, cost analyses may be performed for a single time period or for multiple 
periods. Cost data may vary or may be uncertain.
	
1.	Single-period analysis
	
Single-period analysis applies primarily to a short period of time during which 
the costs involved remain essentially constant. The gross profit equation for a 
given product line is given by the following equation:
	
Gross profit

Costs
GP
FC

where:
	 P =	Product price (dollars/unit)
	 N =	Number of products sold during the period
	FC =	Fixed costs (dollars)
	VC =	Variable costs (dollars/unit)
	GP =	Gross profit (dollars)

182

N
P
*
(
)
=
−
FC/
VC 	
 (6.12)
	
The value (P  −  VC) is defined as the contribution margin of the product. 
Selling each additional unit of a product/service generates a contribution in the 
amount of (P − VC) to defray the FC that has been committed to the production 
process.
	
	
Organizational performance can be readily assessed, as the number of cost 
items involved is limited. One needs to make sure that the values of these cost 
items are valid, although from time to time the validity of such values may be 
tough to verify precisely, if joint production activities and other cost-sharing busi-
ness arrangements are involved.
	
2.	Multiple-period analyses
	
The cost analyses over a longer period of time (e.g., multiple periods) are much 
more difficult to calculate for two reasons. First, costs may change predictably 
over time due to inflation, investment return, cost of capital, and other reasons. 
Second, future events are unpredictable (e.g., natural disasters, labor unrest, polit-
ical instability, war against terrorism, spread of disease, or investment climate) 
(Kinney and Raiborn 2012).
	
	
The change of costs over time needs to be addressed by using concepts such as 
NPV and IRR. These concepts are built on the fundamentals of the time value of 
money, compound interest, and the cost of capital. These topics are introduced in 
Appendix 6.C. Depreciation accounting, an important part of the indirect costs of 
products, is included in Appendix 6.D.
	
	
In dealing with the uncertainties of future costs, risks must be included in 
product cost analysis. Risk analysis is elucidated in detail in Section 6.4.
Appendix 6.C:  Time Value of Money and Compound Interest Equations
The concept of time value of money refers to the notion that the value of money changes 
with time (Sullivan et al. 2014; Park 2012). This is because money at hand may lose value 
(purchasing power) if not invested properly. Money at hand may earn income through 
investment. A dollar that is to be received at a future date is not worth as much as a dollar 
that is on hand at the present. Thus, two equal dollar amounts at different points in time 
do not have equal value (purchasing power).
Before introducing basic compound interest equations useful for multiperiod cost analy-
ses, a few definitions are reviewed next.
	
1.	Interest: This represents a fraction of the principal designated as a reward (interest 
income) to its owner for having given up the right to use the principal. It may also 
be a charge (interest payment) to be paid by the borrower for having received the 
right to use the principal during a given interest period.
	
2.	Compound interest: When the interest income earned in one interest period is added 
to the principal, the principal becomes larger for the next period. The enlarged 
principal earns additional interest income under such circumstances. The interest 
is said to have been compounding.

183
Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
	
3.	Nominal interest rate: The interest rate quoted by banks or other lenders on an 
annual basis, also called the annual percentage rate (APR).
	
4.	Effective interest rate: The interest rate in effect for a given interest period (e.g., one 
month). For example, if the nominal interest rate for a bank loan is 12%, then its 
effective interest rate for each month is 1%.
	
5.	Nominal dollar: The actual dollar value at a given point in time.
	
6.	Constant dollar: The dollar value that has a constant purchasing power with 
respect to a given base year (e.g., the reference year 1995); the value is adjusted 
for inflation.
	
7.	Consumer price index: The index tracked by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
to indicate the price change for a basket of consumer products (see Figure 6.A1). 
Since 1993, the inflation rate in the United State has been relatively low.
To introduce the compound interest formulas for multiple-period cost analyses, the fol-
lowing notations are used:
P = Present value (dollars), the value of a project, loan, or financial activity at the 
present time.
F = Future value (dollars), the value of a project, loan or financial activity at a future 
point in time.
i = Effective interest rate for a given period during which the interest is to be com-
pounded (e.g., 1% per month).
A = Annuity (dollars), a series of payments paid out or received at the end of each 
interest period.
n = Number of interest period under consideration.

Equation 6.18 determines the total present value of an account to which an 
annuity A is deposited at the end of each period. For example, if A is the peri-
odical maintenance costs for capital equipment, then this equation calculates 
the present value of all maintenance costs over its product life of n periods.
Example 6.9
The annual maintenance on the parking lot is $5000. What expenditure would be justi-
fied for resurfacing if no maintenance is required for the first five years, $2000 per year 
for the next 10 years, and $5000 a year thereafter? Assume the cost of money is 6%.
Answer 6.9
Since the annual maintenance cost is the same after 15 years, the effect of resurfacing 
applies to the first 15 years only. The total present value of the “doing nothing” option is

Answer: Monthly rate = 2.965% and the nominal annual rate is 35.58%.
For all multiple-period problems, the time line convention is regarded as standard 
(see Figure 6.A2).
When applying these compound interest formulas, the following guidelines should 
be kept in mind:
	
a.	 P is at present, F is at a future point in time, and A occurs at the end of each 
period.
	
b.	 The periods must be consecutively and sequentially linked with the end of one 
and the beginning of the next.
	
c.	 Complex problems may be broken down into time segments so that the equa-
tions may be correctly applied to each of the segments.
Appendix 6.D:  Depreciation Accounting
In calculating indirect costs associated with production facility, equipment, and other tan-
gible assets related to production, depreciation charges must be included. Depreciation 
is a cost-allocation procedure whereby the cost of a long-lived asset is recognized in each 
accounting period over the asset’s useful life in proportion to its benefit brought forth 
over the same period. This procedure is undertaken in a reasonable and orderly fashion. 
Specifically, the acquisition cost of an asset can be considered as the price paid for a series 
of future benefits. As the asset is partially used up in each accounting period, a corre-
sponding portion of the original investment in the asset is treated as the cost incurred for 
the partial benefit delivered.
Three specific depreciation accounting methods are generally accepted in industry. 
They are discussed next, using the following notations:

	 P	
= Initial investment (dollars) at the present time.
	 N	
= Useful life of a long-lived asset measured in years (e.g., N = 25 for buildings, 
N = 15 for equipment, N = 5 for automobiles, and N = 3 for computers).
	D(m)		
= Depreciation charge (dollars) in the asset’s m(th) year.
	 L	
	
= Salvage value (dollars) recoverable at the end of the equipment’s useful life.
	AD(m)	 = Accumulated depreciation (dollars), which is the total amount of depreciation 
charges accumulated at the end of the m(th) year.
	BV(m)	
= Book value (dollars) of an asset in its m(th) year. BV(m) = P − AD(m)
	P − L	
= Depreciation base (dollars).
	r(m)	
= Depreciation rate, a fraction of the depreciable base to be depreciated per 
year. 
	
1.	Straight line
	
By this depreciation method, an equal portion of depreciation base (P − L) is desig-
nated as the depreciation charge for each period of the assets’ estimated useful life:

More than 91% of publicly traded companies in the United States use this 
straight-line depreciation method.
	
2.	Declining balance
	
By this depreciation method, the depreciation charge is set to equal to the net book 
value (e.g., acquisition cost minus accumulated depreciation) at the beginning of 
each period (e.g., year) multiplied by a fixed percentage. If this percentage is two 
times the straight-line depreciation percentage, then it is called a double-declining 
balance method:

Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
	
	
Note that the salvage value is not subtracted from the acquisition cost. To make 
sure that the total accumulated depreciation does not exceed the depreciation 
base, the depreciation charge of the very last period (e.g., year) must be manually 
adjusted.
	
3.	Units of production method
	
This method prescribes that the depreciation charge is assumed to be proportional 
to the service performed (e.g., units produced or hours consumed). Companies 
that are involved with natural resources (e.g., oil and gas exploration) use the units 
of production method to depreciate their production assets. Software companies 
also use this method to depreciate their capitalized software development costs.
Example 6.11
The company plans to change its depreciation accounting from the straight-line method 
to the double-declining method on a class of assets that have a first cost (acquisition 
cost) of $80,000, an expected life of six years, and no salvage value. If the company’s 
tax rate is 50%, what is the present value of this change, assuming 10% interest com-
pounded annually?

uniformly by $3,000 each year thereafter, at the end of which year will the costs per year 
of ownership and maintenance be at a minimum?
Answer 6.12
The average annual ownership cost is calculated as shown in Table 6.A2.
The numbers in the sixth column are produced by dividing the numbers in the fifth 
column by the ownership duration in years. Answer: Fifth year. 
Example 6.13
Ceramic hot-gas filters provide 2400 hour of service life. Three of the processes in a 
refinery are each equipped with one of these filter sets. Each filter set has an initial cost 
of $1200. When production is scheduled, each process runs 24 hours per day.
In the first quarter of the year, Process A did not start operating until the beginning 
of the fourth week. Process B terminated at the end of the 10th week. Process C was on 
stream for the entire period. What depreciation charge should be allocated for ceramic 
filters during the first quarter?
Answer 6.13
The proper method of calculating the depreciation charge is on the basis of usage, as 
shown in Table 6.A3.

Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
Appendix 6.E:  Inventory Accounting
After the direct and indirect costs are estimated, the product costs can be defined. When 
products are transferred from WIP operations to an FG warehouse, they become inven-
tory. Inventory may be managed by one of two methods: first in and first out (FIFO) and 
last in and first out (LIFO). The FIFO method specifies that inventory that enters the ware-
house first will leave the warehouse first. By the LIFO method, the inventory that enters 
the warehouse last is shipped out first (Bragg 2013).
According to the time value of money concept, these two inventory operational meth-
ods may yield different CGS. The inventory accounting takes into account such a possible 
change of product cost over time, due, possibly, to inflation. In general, companies utilize 
one of the following three inventory accounting methods:
	
1.	FIFO (first in and first out)
	
2.	LIFO (last in and first out)
	
3.	Weighted average
LIFO is most useful during periods of high inflation, as it results in less reportable 
earnings with lower payable taxes to report; LIFO is not useful, however, when prices for 
raw materials decrease. LIFO also provides lower inventory value, thus understating the 
value of the inventory in the company’s balance sheet. Finally, LIFO is a more conservative 
accounting technique than FIFO. Note that LIFO is prohibited by law in some countries, 
such as the United Kingdom, France, and Australia.
As a product of creative accounting, FIFO defines an inventory value more closely 
matched with its market value (Table 6.A4). It tends to make the income statement look 
better than it really is. In periods when the business climate experiences stagnation or 
recession, innumerable companies frequently switch from LIFO to FIFO. The weighted 
average method represents a compromise between the two (Table 6.A5).
Table 6.A6 is an illustration of the use of FIFO and LIFO accounting techniques. Assume 
that a manufacturing company has five units of products in inventory and each has a 
product cost of $100. Furthermore, the company produces five more units at $200 each in 
one period and then another five units at $300 each in a later period. During these periods, 
the company sells 10 units to customers. Determine the average CGS on the basis of both 
FIFO and LIFO and assess its impact on the company’s net income.

The impact of inventory accounting on net income is quite direct, as illustrated in 
Table 6.A7. Table 6.A7 is an abbreviated income statement (see Section 7.4.1) wherein CGS 
is the costs of goods sold, GS&A is general, sales and administration expenses, and EBIT 
is earnings before interests and taxes. On switching from FIFO to LIFO inventory account-
ing, the tax liabilities are shown to have been reduced from $2.4 million to $2.0 million 
(Tables 6.A8 through 6.12).

	(4)	Sum of all cost is $4,444,400
ABS is to redistribute the overhead costs to various products. After redistribution, the total cost should be exactly equal to $4,444,400, no more and 
no less.
The product costs for A, B, and C are $2679, $1787, and $1747, respectively. The individual gross margins for A, B, and C are $2321, $2713, and

Appendix 6.I:  Conversion of a Probability Density Function to 
its Cumulative Distribution Function
The process of converting a probability density function to its cumulative distribu-
tion function is straightforward and unique. Figure  6.A3 shows a Triangular prob-
ability density function for the cost of the component C1. The vertical axis represents 
probability, and the horizontal axis represents cost. The Triangular probability density 
function is the easiest one to apply when a three-point estimate for a risky input vari-
able is known.
The component C1 is assumed to have a minimum cost of $30 (Point A), a maximum cost 
of $80 (Point Z), and a most likely cost of $50 (Point M). The area underneath the Triangular 
probability density function is normalized to 1; this condition prescribes that the y coordi-
nate for the point N is 0.04 based on the calculation of 1 = 0.04 × 0.5 ×(80 – 30).

201
Cost Accounting for Engineering Managers
Let us insert a vertical cost line through x. With this cost line in place, we define the 
shaded area PNZXP as Ax, which is under the probability density function, but bound by 
the vertical cost line that passes through x on the left. We form a ratio of Ax to the total area 
APNZXA underneath the same probability density function. This ratio is designated as 
Px. The value of Px varies from 0 to 1, as x moves from Z to M and then to A. Px is the prob-
ability for the cost of this component to be equal to or in excess of x. The pair of Px and x 
represents a point in a cumulative distribution chart.
For another cost value, y, this process is repeated. A new pair of Py and y defines another 
point in the descending cumulative distribution chart. After many repetitions, a descend-
ing cumulative curve is generated that resembles the one shown in Figure 6.A4. The verti-
cal axis is the probability for the component cost to equal or exceed the value shown on 
the x axis. The x axis spans the minimum value of A on the left to the maximum value of 
Z on the right.

Financial Accounting and Management 
for Engineering Managers
7.1  Introduction
Financial accounting and management serve the important corporate functions of 
reporting and evaluating the financial health of a firm (Williams et al. 2014; Libby et al. 
2013; Weygandt et al. 2013).
Financial statements are prepared by certified management accountants (CMAs) and 
certified public accountants (CPAs), according to the Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (GAAP) in a conservative, material, and consistent manner. These financial 
documents provide (a) internal reporting to corporate insiders for planning and control-
ling routine operations and for decisions on capital investments and (b) external reporting 
to shareholders and potential investors in financial markets (Phillips 2012).
All financial statements are designed to be relevant, reliable, comparable, and consistent. 
Financial accounting treats owners (shareholders) and corporations as separate entities. 
Owners of corporations are liable only to the extent of their committed investments. 
Owners enjoy a flexible tenure and participation. As investors, they may buy or sell stocks 
of the company at any time. On the other hand, corporations are legal entities, fully respon-
sible for their liabilities up to the limits of their total assets. Corporations are assumed to 
be going concerns and in operation forever, unless they cease to exist by declaring bank-
ruptcy or being acquired by others.
This chapter discusses (a) language and concepts, (b) financial statements, (c) perfor-
mance ratios and analysis, and (d) balanced scorecards or tools to monitor and promote 
corporate productivity. In Appendix 7.A, T-accounts are presented.
To be effective, science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals must 
know how to read financial statements; monitor the firm’s activity, performance, profitability, 
and market position; and assess the financial health of a firm. Doing so will allow them to 
initiate proper projects (e.g., plant expansion, new product and technology development, new 
technology acquisition, strategic alliances) at the right time to add value to their employers.
7.2  Financial Accounting Principles
As practiced in many countries, all financial statements are formulated for a specific 
accounting period. A typical accounting period is three  months. Specifically, the U.S. 

206
Engineering Management
Securities and Exchange Commission prescribes that all publicly traded companies file 
Form 10-Q reports every quarter. All companies also need to publish their Form 10-K 
reports annually. The financial statements must adhere to the basic principles of account-
ing, discussed in the following subsections (Weygandt 2013; Needles and Powers 2013).
7.2.1  Accrual Principle
Accounting statements include both cash and credit transactions. Revenue is recognized 
when it is earned. For example, a manufacturing enterprise will recognize revenues as soon 
as products are shipped to the customer and an invoice is sent, irrespective of any credit pay-
ment already received or yet to be collected. Sports teams are known to sell season tickets 
ahead of the games for cash and then recognize the applicable revenue only after each game 
is played. According to the accrual principle of accounting, companies recognize revenues 
when earned, with the assumption that the collection of this revenue from approved credit 
accounts and the delivery of the promised products or services are both reasonably ensured.
Similarly, the accrual principle specifies that costs and expenses are established when 
incurred, even before actual payments are made.
7.2.2  Matching
Expenses are recognized by matching them with the revenue generated in a given account-
ing period. For example, the cost of goods sold (CGS) is recognized as an expense only 
after products are sold and revenue is recognized. Before the products are sold, the CGS 
stays as inventory—a part of the corporate current assets (CA)—even though costs for 
materials, labor, and factory overhead have already been spent for these unsold products.
7.2.3  Dual Aspects
The assets of a company are always equal to the claims against it (i.e., assets equal to claims). 
The claims originate from both creditors and owners. Each transaction has a dual effect in 
that it induces two entries in order to maintain a balance between assets and claims.
7.2.4  Full Disclosure Principle
All relevant information is disclosed to the users of the company’s financial reports. 
Extensive footnotes contained in the annual reports of numerous publicly traded compa-
nies are testimonials for such disclosure practices.
7.2.5  Conservatism
Assets are to be recorded at the lowest value consistent with objectivity (e.g., book values 
of certain corporate fixed assets are often lower than market values). While profits are not 
recorded till recognized, losses are recorded as soon as they become known. Inventories 
are valued at the recorded cost or market value, whichever is lower.
7.2.6  Going Concern
As stated in Section 7.1, it is assumed that the company’s business will go on forever. 
This assumption justifies the current practice of using historical data (e.g., the original 

207
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
acquisition costs) and a reasonable method of depreciation (e.g., straight line) by which the 
book value of corporate tangible assets is defined. Otherwise, liquidation accounting must 
be applied to define the corporate asset value by using current market prices.
7.3  Key Financial Statements
Typically, companies use three financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, and funds 
flow statement (Fraser and Ormiston 2015; Tracy and Tracy 2014). They are described next.
7.3.1  Income Statement
The income statement is an accounting report that matches sales revenue with pertinent 
expenses that have been incurred (CGS, tax, interest, depreciation charges, salaries and 
wages, administrative expenses, R&D, etc.). Sometimes it is also called the profit or loss 
statement, earnings statement, or operating and revenue statement. The income statement 
contains the following key entries (Tracy 2014):
	
1.	Sales revenue is the total revenue realized by the firm during an accounting period. 
Sales revenue is recognized when earned, for example, by having goods shipped 
and invoices issued.
	
2.	CGS is the cost of goods that have been actually sold during an accounting period. 
In a manufacturing company, CGS is calculated as the opening inventory at the 
beginning of an accounting period, plus labor costs, material costs, and manufac-
turing overhead incurred during the period, and minus the closing inventory at 
the end of the period.
	
3.	Gross margin is the sales revenue minus the CGS. The gross margin percentage is 
the ratio of gross margin divided by sales revenue.
	
4.	Expenses are those expenditures chargeable against sales revenue during an 
accounting period. Examples include general, selling, and administrative expenses 
(GS&A); depreciation charges; R&D; advertising; interest payments for bonds; 
employee retirement benefit payments; and local taxes.
	
5.	Depreciation is a process by which the cost of a fixed, long-lived asset is converted 
into expenses over its useful life. This is in proportion to the value it has produced 
during an accounting period (see Appendix 6.D).
	
6.	EBIT is the earnings before interests and taxes.
	
7.	Net income is the excess of sales revenue over all expenses (e.g., CGS, all items 
under (4), and corporate tax) in an accounting period. Sometimes it is also called 
profit, earnings, or net operating profit after tax (NOPAT).
	
8.	Dividend is the amount per share paid out to stockholders in an accounting period.
	
9.	Earnings per share are the net income of a firm during an accounting period (e.g., 
three months or a year), minus dividends on preferred stock, divided by the num-
ber of common shares outstanding.
	 10.	Costs can be defined as follows: while all costs are also expenditures, not all costs 
are expenses. Only expenses are chargeable against revenues in a given accounting 

208
Engineering Management
period. For example, direct and indirect costs contained in the products preserved 
as inventory are not recognized immediately as expenses. When products in 
inventory are sold, the respective CGS is then recognized as expenses in the 
income statement, along with other expenses.
	 11.	Cash flow is defined as net income plus noncash charges (such as depreciation). It 
represents the net inflow of cash to a company at the end of an accounting period.
	
	
An income statement shows the firm’s activity. An example is given in Table 7.1 
for the XYZ Company. In general, sales revenue is referred to as the top line and 
net income as the bottom line figures. These line items are examined closely by 
financial analysts, as are the line items of gross margin and EBIT. (For a detailed 
analysis and interpretation of income statement entries, see Section 7.4.2 on ratio 
analysis.)
Engineering managers deploy company resources to foster the financial success of their 
employers. The impacts of engineering activities are registered in several line items con-
tained in the income statement:
	
1.	Sales revenue: Engineering managers increase sales revenue through well-designed 
products/services that satisfy the needs of customers. They introduce innovative 
products/services that address the needs of new customers in new markets. They 
refine products/services that are easy to serve and maintain, thus promoting mar-
ket acceptance of the company’s products/services. They also bring into being 
supply chains to increase the speed of product/service introduction and the extent 
of customization in the marketplace.
	
2.	Cost of goods sold: Engineering managers cut down product/service costs by inno-
vative design, engineering, manufacturing, and quality control.
	
3.	R&D: Engineering managers advance and apply new technologies to enhance 
product/service features and to foster the rapid development of new global 
offerings.

Example 7.1
Advanced Technologies has had quite a successful year. Its assets, liabilities, revenues, 
and expenses at the end of the current fiscal year are shown in Table 7.2.
Determine the net income of the company for the current year.
Answer 7.1
To determine the company’s net income, we need to create the income statement for the 
company. As presented in Table 7.3, only selected items of Table 7.2 are to be included in 
the company’s income statement.
7.3.2  Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is an accounting report that lists the assets owned by a company and the 
ways in which these assets are financed through liabilities and owners’ equity. Liabilities 
are claims of creditors (such as banks, bondholders, and suppliers) against the company. 
Owners’ equity represents the claims of owners (shareholders) against the company 
(Subramanyam 2013). The following key entries are included in a balance sheet:
	
1.	Assets are items of value with a measurable worth. They are resources of economic 
value possessed by the company. There are three classes of assets: current, fixed, 
and all others.

2.	Current assets are convertible to cash within 12  months. Examples include, in 
descending order of liquidity, cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, 
inventory, and prepaid expenses.
	
3.	Cash is money on hand or in bank checks and is the most liquid form of assets.
	
4.	Accounts receivable is the category of revenue recognized prior to payment collec-
tion. It is money owed to the company, usually by its customers or debtors, as the 
result of a credit transaction.
	
5.	Inventory designates stock of goods yet to be sold that is valued at cost, includ-
ing direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. It may consist 
of stores, work in progress, and finished goods inventories (see Appendix 6.8.5). 
Inventory is included in the balance sheet as a CA.
	
	
When finished goods are shipped and invoiced to customers in an accounting 
period. The CGS is then recognized in the income statement as an expense.
	
6.	Prepaid expenses are paid before receiving the expected benefit (e.g., rent, journal 
subscription fee, or season’s tickets). They are a CA.
	
7.	Fixed assets are tangible assets of long, useful life (more than 12 months), such 
as land, buildings, machines, and equipment. Note that costs spent to improve 
these assets are to be added to the fixed asset value. However, repair and main-
tenance costs incurred in a given accounting period are expensed in the income 
statement.
	
8.	Other assets are valuable assets that are neither current nor fixed. Examples include 
patents, leases, franchises, copyrights, and goodwill. Amortization accounting 
applies to these assets in a similar manner as depreciation is applied to fixed 
assets (see Appendix 6.D).

Goodwill—a company’s reputation and brand-name recognition—is recognized 
as an asset only if it has been purchased for a measurable monetary value, such as 
in conjunction with a merger or acquisition transaction.
	
9.	Accumulated depreciation is the sum of all annual depreciation charges taken 
from the date at which the fixed asset is first deployed up to the present (see 
Appendix 6.D).
	 10.	Net fixed assets are the net value of the firm’s tangible assets: original acquisition 
cost minus accumulated depreciation. It is possible that this net fixed asset value 
may deviate considerably from its market value or replacement cost in a given 
accounting period. The conservatism principle prescribes that the net fixed asset 
is carried on the balance sheet even if it is lower than its current market value—the 
case of underreporting the company’s assets. Otherwise, an expense entry must 
be added to the balance sheet to correct the fixed asset value downward, should it 
become higher than its current market value.
	 11.	Liabilities are obligations that need to be discharged by the company in the future. 
They represent claims of creditors (e.g., banks, bondholders, and suppliers) against 
the firm’s assets. Sometimes, they are also called debt.
	 12.	Current liability (CL) describes amounts due for payment within 12  months. 
Examples include accounts payable, short-term bank loans, interest payments, pay-
able tax, insurance premiums, deferred income, and accrued expenses. Accounts 
payable is always listed first within the category of CLs, with others to follow in 
no specific order.
	 13.	Accounts payable is an expense recognized before payment. It is an obligation to 
pay a creditor or supplier as a result of a credit transaction, usually within a period 
of one to three months.
	 14.	Deferred income is income received in advance of being earned and recognized (i.e., 
payment received before shipment and invoicing of goods). In the balance sheet, it 
is included as a CL.
	 15.	Deferred income tax is the amount of tax due to be paid in the future, usually within 
12 months.
	 16.	Long-term liability is defined as the amounts due to be paid in more than 12 months. 
Examples include corporate bonds, mortgage loans, long-term loans, lines of 
credit, long-term leases, and contracts.
	 17.	Bonds are long-term debt certificates secured by the assets of the issuing entity 
(e.g., a company or a government). Bonds issued by a publicly held company are 
corporate bonds, and those issued by the U.S. federal government are treasury 
bonds. In case of defaults, bondholders have the legal right to seize the issuer’s 
assets for recovery.
	 18.	Debentures are unsecured bonds issued by the firm.
	 19.	Convertible bonds are those debt certificates issued by a company that are allowed to 
be converted into common stocks according to a set of specifications (e.g., timing, 
conversion ratio).
	 20.	Owners’ equity is the shareholders’ original investment plus accumulated retained 
earnings. It represents the residual value of the corporation owned by the share-
holders after having deducted all liabilities from company assets. Sometimes it is 
also called net worth.

212
Engineering Management
	 21.	Stock is a certificate of ownership of a company. Preferred stocks have a fixed rate 
of dividend that must be paid before dividends are distributed to holders of com-
mon stocks.
	 22.	Capital surplus is the premium price per share above the par value of the stock. 
It includes the increase in the owner’s equity above and beyond the difference 
between assets and liabilities reported in the company’s balance sheet.
	 23.	Retained earnings are the accumulated earnings retained by the company, not to be 
paid out as dividends, for the purpose of reinvestment.
	 24.	Book value is defined as the tangible assets (such as fixed assets) minus liabilities 
and the equity of preferred stocks. It is the share value of common stocks carried 
in the books.
	 25.	Stock price is the market value of a firm’s stock. It is influenced by the book value, 
earning per share, anticipated future earnings, perceived management quality, 
and environmental factors present in the marketplace.
	
	
The organization of entries in a balance sheet follows this specific convention:
a.	 Assets are listed before liabilities, which are then followed by owners’ 
equity.
b.	 CAs and CLs are enumerated ahead of non-CAs and CLs, respectively.
c.	 Liquid assets are listed before all other assets with less liquidity.
d.	 The listing of CLs follows no specific order, except that accounts payable must 
always be listed first in this category.
The contributions of engineering managers affect only one line item in the balance sheet, 
namely, inventories. Inventories may be reduced by applying superior production tech-
nologies, product design, and best practices of supply chain management. Table 7.4 shows 
a sample balance sheet of XYZ Company.
Example 7.2
Using the data given in Table 7.2, construct the balance sheet of Advanced Technologies 
and determine the owners’ equities at the end of the current fiscal year.
Answer 7.2
The owners’ equities are $29,120 at year end (see Table 7.5).
7.3.3  Funds Flow Statement
The funds flow statement compares the firm’s activities in two consecutive accounting 
periods and elucidates the major sources and uses of funds of the firm. It is sometimes 
also called the statement of changes in financial position or the statement of sources and uses of 
funds.
The principle behind the funds flow analysis is rather simple. An increase in assets 
signifies a use of funds, such as buying a plant facility by paying cash or using credit. 
A  decrease in assets indicates a source of funds, such as selling used equipment to 
receive cash. An increase in liabilities produces a source of funds, such as borrowing 
money from a bank so that more cash is available for other purposes. A decrease of 
liabilities yields a use of funds, such as paying down a bank loan by using money from 

213
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
the company’s cash reservoir. Table 7.6 presents an example of the funds flow statement 
of XYZ Company.
The funds flow statement shown in Table 7.6 is generated by using the data in Tables 7.1 
and 7.4:
	
1.	Increase in long-term debt
	
a.	 Increase in long-term debt (1959.9 − 1542.5) = 417.4
	
b.	 Increase of long-term debt due within one year (50.8 − 30.4) = 20.4
	
c.	 Total (417.4 + 20.4) = 437.8
	
2.	Increase in plants and equipment
	
a.	 Increase in fixed assets (11,897.7 − 11,070.4) = 827.3
	
b.	 Increase in long-term receivable and other investments (735.2 − 574.8) = 160.4

c.	 As details are missing, we introduce the following reasonable assumption:
	
i.	 Long-term receivables = 59.6
	
ii.	 Increase in other investment (160.4 − 59.6) = 100.8
	
d.	 Total increase in fixed asset investment (827.3 + 100.8) = 928.1
	
3.	Increase in common stock and capital
	
a.	 Increase in common stocks (82.2 − 81.4) = 0.8
	
b.	 Increase in capital surplus (1589.6 – 1549.1) = 40.5
	
c.	 Total (0.8 + 40.5) = 41.3
Most other line items in this funds flow statement are directly verifiable using data in 
Table 7.4. By reviewing the percentages contained in the rightmost column of Table 7.6, 
managers will have a clear picture regarding how funds are created (e.g., 25.5% from rais-
ing debt and 24.86% from net income earned) and how they have been spent (e.g., 56.23% 
for fixed assets and another 13.11% for building up inventories). These numbers suggest 
that XYZ Company is borrowing heavily to build plants and inventories to pursue a busi-
ness expansion strategy.
7.3.4  Linkage between Statements
The three financial statements described in Sections 7.3.1 through 7.3.3 are linked to one 
another. The net profit in the income statement is linked with the retained earnings in 
the balance sheet. The inventory account in the balance sheet is linked with the sales 
revenue in the income statement. The accumulated depreciation in the balance sheet is 
linked with the annual depreciation charge included in the income statement. Because 
the depreciation charge taken in a given period affects the net profit of the company dur-
ing the same period, it is thus indirectly linked to the retained earning account in the 
balance sheet as well.

The linkage between the funds flow statement and the other two financial statements is 
self-evident, as all data in the funds flow statement are derived from changes in various 
line items in the other two statements.
7.3.5  Recognition of Key Accounting Entries
This section offers additional notes on the recognition of several key accounting entries—
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses—according to GAAP practiced in many countries. 
Some countries may have slightly different rules governing the report of these items.
	
1.	Assets are the resources under company control. They have economic value and 
can be used to produce future benefits. Assets recognition is based on two prin-
ciples: historical cost and conservatism (Schoenebeck and Holtzman 2012). All 
assets are reported by using historical cost: that is, the initial capital investment 
value at some time in the past. The book value of a given asset is defined as its 
initial acquisition cost minus the accumulated depreciation. Should the asset’s 
current market value drop below its book value, the shortfall must be reported 
as an expense. If its market value exceeds its book value, however, the surplus is 
not reported in the company’s balance sheet. This is to ensure that the asset value 
included in the balance sheet always denotes its lower bound. Thus, the balance 
sheet may understate the true value of the company’s assets.

Engineering Management
	
	
Asset reporting must address two specific issues: asset ownership and the 
certainty of its future economic benefits. If neither the ownership nor the future 
benefits are clearly established, an asset cannot be recognized. For example, com-
panies routinely invest in employee training in the hope that doing so will lead to 
increased productivity at a future point in time. Since the completed training is 
really owned by the individual employees involved, and employees may leave at 
any time they wish, companies do not have real ownership of the training results. 
Thus, employee training is regarded as an expense and not an asset. When com-
panies acquire plant facilities to make products for sales in the marketplace, the 
future benefits are more or less certain. Plant facilities are thus reported as assets. 
When companies apply resources to expand R&D and advertising, the future ben-
efits of these investments are neither certain nor measurable. R&D and advertising 
are thus recognized as expenses and not assets.
	
	
GAAP accounting rules in the United States (Flood 2014) contain one exception: 
generally speaking, software development costs are to be reported as expenses as 
they are incurred. However, once the company management becomes confident 
that the software development efforts can be completed and the resulting soft-
ware product will be used as intended, all development costs incurred from that 
point are to be reported as assets.
	
	
There are several ambiguities in the accounting rules practiced in the United 
States:
a.	 Buying versus developing: If Company A acquires Company B by paying a 
purchase price that exceeds Company B’s net asset value, this excess value is 
called goodwill. Goodwill includes the intangible assets of Company B, such 
as its brand name, trademarks, patents, R&D portfolio, and employee skills. 
After the merger, the surviving company has part of its R&D (from the origi-
nal Company A) recognized as expenses and part of the R&D (acquired from 
Company B) as assets.
b.	 Valuing intangible assets: “If you can’t kick a resource, it really isn’t an asset.” 
This saying is typically the justification used by companies to rapidly write 
off intangible assets from their balance sheets. Often, goodwill is signifi-
cantly overvalued in a merger or acquisition transaction due to potential 
conflicts of interests among the parties involved. Writing off intangible 
assets distorts the true value of the assets reported in the company’s balance 
sheet.
c.	 Market value: U.S. accounting rules prescribe that marketable securities (e.g., 
bonds) are to be reported at their fair market values only if they are not to be 
held to maturity. Thus, at any given time, the real asset value of a company is 
distorted by not reporting the current true market values of these assets in bal-
ance sheets.
	
2.	Liabilities are obligations to be satisfied by transferring assets or providing services 
to another entity (e.g., a bank, a supplier, or a customer).
	
	
A liability is recorded when an obligation has been incurred and the amount 
and timing of this obligation can be measured with a reasonable amount of cer-
tainty. For multiple-year commitments, the recordable obligation is the present 
value of expected future commitments, wherein the discount rate is the prevailing 
rate when the obligation was first established.

217
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
	
3.	Revenues recognition must satisfy two conditions: revenue is earned when (1) all 
or substantially all of the goods or services are delivered to the customers and (2) 
it is likely that the collection of cash or receivables will be successful. Generally 
speaking, the timing of product or service delivery may not be the same as that for 
payment collection.
	
	
For magazine subscriptions, insurance policies, and service contracts, cus-
tomers usually pay in advance. In these cases, payments received ahead of the 
service delivery dates are kept in a “deferred revenue” account. Only after the 
pertinent service is delivered will the applicable payments be credited to the rev-
enue T-account during the accounting period. T-accounts will be discussed in 
Appendix 7.A. For products sold on credit, companies recognize the revenue as 
soon as the products are shipped out, and invoices are issued to customers ahead 
of the payment collection.
	
	
In the case of construction projects, which usually stretch out over many 
accounting periods, revenues are recognized in T-accounts by using the percentage 
completion method and are recognized in proportion to the expenses incurred in 
the project.
	
	
For products sold with money-back guarantees, companies recognize revenue 
at the time the product is delivered. At the end of an accounting period, manage-
ment makes an estimate of the cost of returns (a liability) to adjust the revenue 
figure.
	
4.	Expenses are economic resources that either have been consumed or have declined 
in value during an accounting period. Expenses are typically recorded in the form 
of a reduction of asset value (e.g., cash) or by a creation of liability (e.g., accounts 
payable).
	
	
There are three types of expenses: (1) consumed resources having a cause-and-
effect relationship with revenue generated during the same accounting period 
(e.g., CGS); (2) other resources consumed during the same accounting period, but 
having no cause-and-effect relationship with revenue (such as R&D expenses, 
advertising expenses, depreciation charges, local taxes, pension expenses, and 
other general administrative expenses); (3) reduction of expected benefits of com-
pany assets generated by past investments (e.g., the write-down of production 
facilities and equipment that is no longer of value due to the noncompetitiveness 
of products or technological obsolescence).
Example 7.3
Superior Technologies sells a product at the unit price of $100. The unit cost of the prod-
uct is $60. Annual sales have averaged one million units, and its annual selling expense 
has been $7 million. Market research has determined that if the selling price of the com-
pany product is decreased to $90, there will be a 35% increase in the number of units 
sold. The engineering department estimates that if the production volume is increased 
by 35%, it will reduce the unit product cost by 10% due to the scale of economies. To 
market the 35% increase in sales volume, the company’s selling expense will need to 
increase by about 50%.
The company’s current warehouse facilities are sufficiently large to accommo-
date the possible increase of 35% in sales volume without requiring new investment. 
Furthermore, regardless of the product price, the company is obliged to pay an annual 
loan interest of $2 million. Its corporate tax rate is 45%. It maintains an R&D department, 

218
Engineering Management
whose operation is independent of the sales units, at an annual cost of $5 million. Its 
administrative expense is $15 million, which is also independent of the sales activities. 
In addition, the company incurs a pretax depreciation charge of $2 million.
Determine whether the reduction of product price would increase or decrease the net 
income of the company and by how much.
Answer 7.3
The reduction of product price will cause the company’s net income to increase to $7.755 
million from $4.95 million (see details in Table 7.7).
7.3.6  Caution in Reading Financial Statements
In the United States, companies follow the rules set by the Financial Accounting Board 
(FASB), an industrial panel, when preparing financial statements. Even so, these financial 
statements are not always created equal; they need to be studied carefully because of the 
following built-in variations.
	
1.	Depreciation accounting base: Some companies may use the straight-line method, 
whereas others may choose to use the double-declining method, as both are allow-
able (Appendix 6.D).
	
2.	Inventory accounting method: Some companies use the first in and first out (FIFO) 
method, whereas others may choose to use last in and first out (LIFO). In time peri-
ods with high price volatility, the inventory value will be affected by the method 
chosen (Appendix 6.E).
	
3.	Cost of capital: Dependent on the debt-to-equity ratio and the costs of raising equity 
and debt, the weighted average of cost of capital will be different from one com-
pany to another.
	
4.	Difference between book and market values: The book value of a company’s fixed 
assets is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation from its initial

acquisition prices. These values may be quite different from the assets’ current 
market values, which, in turn, are dependent on supply and demand in the mar-
ketplace and the overall economy.
	
5.	Long-term liabilities reportable: The current FASB rules do not require companies to 
report long-term liabilities associated with pension, health care and other such obli-
gations in balance sheets, although these liabilities are typically disclosed in foot-
notes and other such obscure places within the companies’ annual reports. Some 
companies with a heavily unionized workforce could therefore create the illusion of 
having a higher net worth than otherwise for unsophisticated investors. It is impor-
tant to keep such long-term liabilities in mind when reading financial statements.
7.4  Fundamentals of Financial Analysis
The purpose of conducting financial analyses is to assess the effectiveness of the compa-
ny’s management in achieving the objectives set forth by the company’s board of directors 
with respect to a number of critically important business factors (Revsine et al. 2014). Such 
factors include liquidity, activities, profitability, capitalization, and stock value. Typically, 
the corporate objectives of industrial companies are growth, profitability, and return on 
investment (ROI). Many of these financial terms will be defined and explained in this 
section.
The growth objective suggests that companies keep product prices low, increase market-
ing expenses, run plants at full capacity, take loans to keep inventory high, strive for a 
larger market share, and attain a more dominant market position. The profitability objective 
dictates that companies set prices high to maximize profits, run plants at a capacity that 
minimizes costs (production and maintenance), and use debt when called for. The ROI 
objective is to operate the company by maximizing its financial return with respect to the 
firm’s investment (e.g., the “milk-the-cash-cow” strategy. See Section 9.5.4).
Financial analyses focus on studying the period-to-period changes in key financial data 
and on comparing performance ratios with the industrial standards.
7.4.1  Performance Ratios
In this section, we apply a specific system of calculating performance ratios by group-
ing together the ratios for liquidity, activities, profitability, capitalization, and stock value 
(Bragg 2012). In order to understand the system, we will need to introduce the following 
terms:
	
1.	Liquidity: is the firm’s capability to satisfy its CLs, such as buying materials, pay-
ing wages and salaries, paying interests on long-term debt, and other necessary 
expenditures. Without liquidity, there can be no activity.
	
	
Working capital is defined as CAs minus CLs. The changes in working capital 
over several periods provide an indication of the company’s reserve strength to 
weather financial adversities.
	
	
Current ratio is the ratio of CAs to CLs. CAs are frequently considered the 
major reservoir of funds for meeting current obligations. CLs (CL) are short-term 

220
Engineering Management
obligations to be discharged within the next three months, such as salaries, 
accounts payable, taxes, interest payments, utilities, etc. This ratio provides an 
indication of the company’s ability to finance its short-term operations over the 
next 12 months. A current ratio above 1.0 indicates a margin of safety that allows 
for a possible shrinkage of value in CAs such as inventories and accounts receiv-
ables. However, having a current ratio in excess of 2.0 or 3.0 may indicate a poor 
cash management practice.
	
	
Quick ratio is the ratio of quick asset to CLs. Quick asset is defined as cash plus 
marketable securities and accounts receivable. This ratio is more restrictive than the 
current ratio in that it excludes the value of inventory whose liquid value may not 
be certain. Thus, the quick ratio indicates the company’s ability to meet its financial 
obligations over the next 12 months without the use of inventory that may take time 
to unload. It is sometimes also called the acid test or liquidity ratio.
	
2.	Activity: The changes in sales and inventory. Successful activity leads to profitability.
	
	
Collection period ratio is the accounts receivable divided by average daily sales 
as measured in days. The average daily sales is the total annual sales divided by 
360 days. This ratio measures the managerial effectiveness of the credit depart-
ment in collecting receivables and the quality of accounts receivable.
	
	
Inventory turnover ratio is the CGS divided by the average inventory. It expresses 
the number of times during a year that the average inventory is recouped or 
turned over through the company’s sales activities. The higher the turnover, the 
more efficient the company’s inventory management performance will be. A good 
inventory management system will create no shortage of inventory, as such a 
shortage will result in a loss of sales and failure to satisfy customers’ needs.
	
	
Asset turnover ratio of net sales to total assets indicates the ability of the 
company’s management to use total assets to generate sales.
	
	
Working capital turnover ratio is net sales to working capital. Working capital is 
defined as average CAs minus average CLs. It indicates the company’s ability to 
efficiently use working capital to generate sales.
	
	
Sales to employee ratio is the company’s net sales revenue divided by its aver-
age number of employees working during an accounting period. It measures the 
company’s ability to effectually use human resources.
	
3.	Profitability: To be profitable is the objective of most companies. Without liquidity 
and activity, there can be no profitability. If the company is profitable, it can readily 
secure the required liquidity to keep its operations continuing.
	
	
Gross margin percentage is defined as gross margin divided by sales revenue. It 
measures the company’s profitability on the basis of sales. Gross margin is defined 
as sales minus CGS.
	
	
Net income-to-sales ratio indicates the company’s overall operational efficiency 
(e.g., procurement, cost control, CAs deployment, and use of financial leverage) in 
creating profitability based on sales. This ratio is also known as return on sales (ROS).
	
	
Net income to owners’ equity ratio measures profitability from the shareholders’ 
viewpoint. It is also known as return on equity (ROE). Owners’ equity is defined as 
total assets minus total liability of the company, representing the net worth, which 
belongs to the investors. This very common measure indicates the earning power 
of the ownership investment in the company.

221
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
	
	
Net income to total asset ratio is net income divided by total assets. It measures the 
management’s ability to effectively apply company assets in generating profits. It 
is known as return on assets (ROA).
	
4.	Capitalization: The sum of the company’s long-term liabilities and owners’ equity 
is defined as the total capital deployed by company management to pursue busi-
ness opportunities. Several ratios are in use to check this capital deployment 
effectiveness.
	
	
Interest coverage ratio (EBIT divided by the interest expense) calculates the num-
ber of times the company’s EBIT covers the required interest payment for the long-
term debt—an indication of the company’s ability to remain solvent in the near 
future. EBIT is defined as earnings before interests and taxes. EBIAT is defined as 
earnings before interests and after tax.
	
	
Long-term debt to capitalization ratio is the ratio of long-term debt to the sum 
of long-term liabilities plus owner’s equity—the total permanent investment in 
a company, indicating the percentage of long-term debt in the company’s capi-
tal structure, excluding CLs. It is a measure of the company’s financial leverage. 
Keeping this ratio small (hence, large owners’ equity percentage) may not always 
be the smart choice, as the company will forgo the use of low-cost debt with tax-
deductible interest payments to enhance profitability.
	
	
Return on invested capital is the ratio of net income divided by capital. The capital 
of a company is the sum of its long-term liabilities plus owners’ equity.
	
	
Debt-to-equity ratio is the ratio of total liability to owners’ equity. It also measures 
the company’s financial independence and the relative stake of shareholders (insid-
ers) and bondholders (outsiders). A low ratio indicates that the company is finan-
cially secure as far as the owners are concerned. A high ratio indicates that the firm 
is highly leveraged and may thus have difficulty borrowing money in the future.
	
5.	Stock value: This is the market price or value of the company’s stock as defined by 
the financial markets. The company’s management is obliged to pursue proper 
business strategies in order to steadily raise its stock value.
	
	
Earnings per share is the ratio of net income minus preferred stock dividends 
divided by the number of common stocks outstanding.
	
	
Price to earning ratio is the ratio of the market price of common share to earning 
per share.
	
	
Market to book ratio is the ratio of market price of stock to the company’s book 
value per share. More precisely, the total book value of a company is defined as 
the total assets minus intangible assets, minus total liability, and minus the equity 
of preferred stocks. In computing the total assets of the company, the value of 
fixed assets is determined by the difference of their initial investment minus accu-
mulated depreciation, irrespective of the assets’ current market value. The book 
value per share is then the total book value divided by the number of outstanding 
common shares.
	
	
Dividend payout ratio is the ratio of dividends per share divided by earnings 
per share. It indicates the percentage of annual earnings paid out as dividends 
to shareholders. The portion that is not paid out goes into the retained earn-
ings account on the balance sheet. The retained earnings are a part of owner’s 
equity.

7.4.2  Ratio Analysis
Ratios are useful tools of financial analysis (Marck 2014; Healy & Cohen 2000; Tracy 2012). 
Sometimes, ratios of significant financial data are more meaningful than the raw data 
themselves. They also provide an instant picture of the financial condition, operation, and 
profitability of a company, provided that the trends and deviations reflected by the ratios 
are interpreted properly.
Ratio analyses are subject to two constraints: past performance and various accounting 
methods. Past performance is not a sure basis for projecting the company’s condition in the 
future. Various accounting methods employed by different companies may result in differ-
ent financial figures (e.g., inventory accounting and depreciation), rendering a comparison 
that is less meaningful between companies in the same industry. Typically, accountants 
try to reconcile financial statements before conducting comparative analyses. Examples of 
adjustments that are frequently made include:
	
1.	Adjusting LIFO inventories to a FIFO basis (Appendix 6.E).
	
2.	Changing the write-off periods of intangible assets, such as goodwill, patents, and 
trademarks (Appendix 6.D).
	
3.	Adding potential contingency liabilities if lawsuits are pending (Section 6.4.5).
	
4.	Reevaluating assets to reflect current market values (Section 7.3.2, entry (4)).
	
5.	Changing debt obligations to reflect current market interest rates.
	
6.	Restating reserves or charges for bad debts, warranties, and product returns.
	
7.	Reclassifying operating leases as capital leases.
When performing ratio analyses, it is advisable to follow this set of generally recom-
mended guidelines:
	
1.	Focus on a limited number of significant ratios.
	
2.	Collect data over a number of past periods to identify the prevalent trends.
	
3.	Present results in graphic or tabular form according to standards (e.g., industrial 
averages).
	
4.	Concentrate on all major variations from the standards.
	
5.	Investigate the causes of these variations by cross-checking with other ratios and 
raw financial data.
In the financial literature, many of the ratios defined in Section 7.4.1 are systematically 
collected and published for key companies in various industries by investment services 
companies. Sources of information on ratios and other financial measures are typically 
reported regularly and made available for use by the public in publications such as Value 
Line Investment Survey, Standard & Poor’s Industrial Survey, and Moody’s Investors 
Services. STEM professionals should develop the habit of reading and considering such 
reports.
Other commercial sources are accessible through the Internet. For the 500 stocks com-
prising Standard & Poor’s index, five specific ratios—current ratio, long-term debt to 
capital, net income to sales, return on assets, and return on equity—are published in

1.	 Liquidity
	
a.	 Current ratio = CA/CL = 3.1
	
	
From the creditor’s standpoint, this ratio should be as high as possible. 
On the other hand, prudent management will want to avoid the excessive 
buildup of idling cash or inventories (or both).
	
b.	 Quick ratio = Quick assets/CL = 0.931
	
	
A result far below 1:1 can be a warning sign.
	
c.	 Interest coverage ratio = 7.833
	
	
The EBIT of the firm could pay 7.833 times the interest and other costs 
associated with the long-term debts. This ratio is good.
	
2.	 Debt versus equity
	
a.	 Long-term debt to capitalization ratio = 4.44%
	
	
This debt level is prudent for firms in this industry.
	
b.	 Total debt to owners’ equity = 22.4%
	
	
Total debt = CL + long-term debt.
	
	
OE = Common stock plus capital surplus plus accumulated retained 
earnings.
	
c.	 Total debt to total asset ratio = 18.3%
	
3.	 Activity
	
a.	 Sales to asset ratio = 0.86
	
b.	 Ending inventory to sales ratio = 28.6%
	
c.	 CGS/average inventory = 2.65 times
	
	
Average inventory = the average of ending inventory of two consecu-
tive years (e.g., 2012 and 2013)
	
4.	 Profitability
	
a.	 Net income to owner’s equity ratio = 2.8%
	
b. 	 Net income-to-sales ratio = 2.66%
	
c.	 Gross margin to sales ratio = 29.1%
	
d.	 EBIT to total asset ratio = 5.1%
	
e.	 Net income to total asset ratio = 2.3%
	
f.	 EBIT to sales ratio = 5.9%
7.4.3  Economic Value Added
Developed by Stern Stewart & Company in 1989, economic value added (EVA) is an 
improved valuation method for asset-intensive companies or projects. EVA is defined as 
the after-tax-adjusted net operating income of a company minus the total cost of capital 
spent during the same accounting period. It is also equal to the return on capital minus 
the cost of capital, or the economic value above and beyond the cost of capital (Stewart 
2013; Ismail 2011). Sometimes EVA is also called economic profit. In equation form, it is 
defined as
 
EVA NOPAT
WACC Capital Deployed
=
−
(
) 	
(7.1)
where:
 NOPAT	
= net operating profit after tax (net income)
 Capital Deployed	 = total assets − CLs
 WACC	
= weighted average of cost of capital (equity and debt) employed in 
producing the earnings (Section 7.6.3)
If EVA is positive, the company is said to have added positive shareholder value. If EVA is 
negative, the company is said to have diminished shareholder value.

225
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
EVA may also be applied to a single project by calculating the after-tax cash flows 
generated by the project minus the cost of capital spent for the project. For example, the 
NPV equation can be modified as follows:

	 P	
	
= investment capital for the project (dollars)
	 Ct	
	
= net after-tax cash inflow (dollars) to be produced by the project in period t
	P × WACC	 = cost of capital (dollars) spent during period t
	WACC	
= weighted average cost of capital in effect (fraction)
	SV	
	
= salvage value of the project at the end of period N
	 N	
	
= number of period
The major advantage of EVA over ROC is that it may encourage managers to under-
take desirable investments and activities that will increase the value of the firm. The next 
example shows the difference between these two methods.
ABC Company has established that its WACC is 10% and its ROC standard for invest-
ment purposes is 14%. The management is considering a new capital investment that is 
expected to earn a return of 12%. This new investment is attractive according to the EVA 
criterion, as 12% is larger than 10%. However, this new investment is a poor choice if evalu-
ated with the ROC criterion, because 12% is less than 14%. Thus, by using the ROC crite-
rion to evaluate investments, the company may lose the opportunity to create shareholder 
value.
Engineering managers should learn to apply EVA as a supplementary measure, besides 
net income after tax, to assess business performance.
7.5  Balanced Scorecard
Financial ratios are developed by accountants, who naturally emphasize the companies’ 
financial performance of direct interest to shareholders. Nonfinancial ratios are limited in 
number and restricted in scope. Examples include accounts receivable, collection, inven-
tory, use of fixed assets, and working capital.
All financial ratios are determined on the basis of past performance data; they are 
“trailing” indicators, and as such, they cannot foretell the future performance of a com-
pany. Because financial ratios are oriented toward the short term, usually from one quarter 
to another, company management is inadvertently forced to overemphasize short-term 
financial results, often to the extent of neglecting the company’s long-term growth. The 
narrow focus of these financial ratios makes them no longer completely relevant to today’s 
business environment, in which customer satisfaction, employee innovation, business 
joint ventures, global orientation, and continuous betterment of business processes are 
key elements of company competitiveness in the marketplace (Niven 2014).

226
Engineering Management
These basic deficiencies in financial ratios are well recognized in industry. Attempts 
have been made in the past to modify these ratios as corporate measurement metrics. 
Kaplan (1996) suggests that corporate measurement metrics are to be defined to cover four 
areas:
•	 Financial: Shareholder value
•	 Customers: Time, quality, performance and service, and cost
•	 Internal business processes: Core competencies and responsiveness to customer 
needs
•	 Innovation and corporate learning: Value added to the customer, new products, and 
continuous refinement
The significance of the balanced scorecard lies in its balanced focus on both short-term 
actions as well as long-term corporate growth. Cutting R&D and marketing expenses is a 
known way for many companies to emphasize short-term performance at the expense of 
long-term health. Spending adequate company effort on innovation to bring out new prod-
ucts is promoting long-term health. Ideally, metrics should be set up to track outcomes in 
both short-term performance and long-term health, which is related to company growth 
prospects, capabilities, relationships, and assets, to enable future cash flows. Companies 
must create metrics to track outcome in both performance and health. Specifically, Kaplan 
(1996) advocates the use of a total of 15–20 metrics to cover these four areas to guide the 
company as it moves forward.
As an illustrative example, the balanced scorecard metrics for a manufacturing com-
pany may contain the following:
	
1.	Financial: Cash flow, quarterly sales growth and operational income, increased 
market shares, and return on equity
	
2.	Customer: Percentage of sales from new products, percentage of sales from propri-
etary products, on-time delivery as defined by customers, share of key account’s 
purchase, ranking by key accounts, and number of collaborative engineering 
efforts with customers
	
3.	Internal business process: Manufacturing capabilities versus competition, manufac-
turing excellence (cycle time, unit cost, and yield), design engineering efficiency, 
and new product introduction schedule versus plan
	
4.	Innovation and learning: Time to develop next-generation technology, speed to learn 
new manufacturing processes, percentage of products that equal 80% of sales, and 
new product introduction versus competition
In general, balanced scorecard metrics for a given company must be developed accord-
ing to its corporate strategy and vision, using a top-down approach. Doing so will ensure 
that performance metrics at lower management levels are properly aligned with the overall 
corporate goals. A unique strength of balanced scorecard metrics is that they link the com-
pany’s long-term strategy with its short-term actions. These metrics contain forward-looking 
elements at the same time as they balance the internal and external measures. The creation of 
such metrics provides clarification, consensus, and focus on the desired corporate outcome.
In the literature, United Parcel Service is known to have achieved an increase of 
30%–40% in profitability with balanced scorecard metrics. Mobil Oil’s North American 

227
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
Marketing and Refining Division raised its standing from last to first in its industry 
after having implemented a balanced scorecard. Person (2013) recommends that man-
agers, when implementing a balanced scorecard, take personal ownership, nurture a 
core group of champions, educate team members, keep the program simple, integrate 
the scorecard into their own leadership systems, orchestrate the dynamics of scorecard 
meetings, communicate the scorecard widely, resist the urge for perfection, be ruthless 
about implementation, and look beyond the numbers to achieve cultural transformation 
of the company.
A widespread use of broad-based metrics, such as those suggested by the balanced 
scorecard, is likely to shift the attention of corporate management from a focus primarily 
on financial performance to other areas of equal importance, such as customers, inter-
nal business processes, and innovation and learning. Contributions made by engineering 
managers in these nonfinancial areas will likely become readily and more favorably rec-
ognized in the future.
7.6  Capital Formation
Capital formation refers to activities undertaken by a company to raise capital for short-
term and long-term investment purposes (Piketty 2014; Sherman 2012).
In general, the net income earned by most companies, plus their internal resources of 
retained earnings, are not sufficient to finance all investments needed to achieve both their 
short-term and long-term corporate objectives. Even if these internal resources are suf-
ficient, some companies still engage in external financing due to valid reasons related to 
tax and strategic management flexibility. Many companies routinely pursue some external 
financing resources, such as equity or debt financing, or both.
7.6.1  Equity Financing
Equity financing is the raising of capital by issuing company stocks. Stocks are certificates 
of company ownership, which typically carry a par value of $1. The price of the same 
stock in the market (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange) may fluctuate in time as a con-
sequence of national economic conditions, industrial trends, political stability, and other 
factors unrelated to company performance. Shareholders are those who own stocks. They 
have the residual claims to what is left of the firm’s assets after the firm has satisfied other 
high-priority claimants (e.g., bondholders, bankruptcy lawyers, and unpaid employees). 
Basically, there are two kinds of stocks: common stocks and preferred stocks (whose dividends 
have a priority over those of common stocks).
Companies may issue new stocks to raise capital. The process requires the approval of 
the company’s board of directors (which mirrors the interests of all shareholders), because 
such a move may result in the dilution of company ownership. In addition, a public stock 
offering needs to be registered with the federal government (e.g., the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission) and organized by an underwriting firm. The underwriting firm 
helps set the offering price, prepares the proper advertisements, and assists in placing all 
unsold issues to ensure a successful completion of the equity financing process. Companies 
issuing new stocks will incur an issuing expense.

228
Engineering Management
The capital received by issuing stocks has a cost made up of the following components: 
the cost of equity capital, which includes the stock issuing fees; the dividends to be paid in 
future years; and the capital gains through stock price appreciation expected by investors 
in the future. Typically, this cost of equity is set to equal the return of an equity calculated 
by using the well-known capital asset pricing model (CAPM) (Hart 2014).
The CAPM defines the return of an equity as (see Figure 7.1)

(7.3)
where:
	 Rf	
	
= risk-free rate (e.g., 6.0% of 10-year U.S. Treasury bills)
	Rm	
	
= expected return of a market portfolio, a group of stocks representing the 
behavior of the entire market (e.g., S&P 500 Index). Rm depends on conditions 
not related to the individual stocks. The typical value for Rm is in the range 
of 15%, based on long-term U.S. market statistics
 β (Beta)	 = relative volatility of a stock in comparison to that of a market portfolio, which 
by definition has a Beta of 1.0. The Standard & Poor’s 500 stocks serve as a 
proxy for the overall market. If the Beta of a stock is 1.5, then its price will 
change by 1.5% for every 1.0% price change of the market portfolio in the 
same direction. An issue with a Beta of 0.5 tends to move 50% less. A stock 
with a negative Beta value tends to move in a direction opposite to that of 
the overall market. Stocks with large Beta values are more volatile and hence 
more risky. Beta values are published in the financial literature for most 
stocks that are publicly held.
	Rm – Rf	
= market risk premium.
Since the value of Beta is based on historical data, numerous financial analysts view it as 
a major deficiency of the CAPM model. Another deficiency is its lack of timing constraints.

The same cost is assumed to be valid for capital projects of a 2- or 10-year duration. In 
practice, when evaluating a specific capital investment project, some companies adjust the 
value of Beta manually in order to arrive at a pertinent cost of equity capital.
7.6.2  Debt Financing
Debt is the liabilities incurred by the company to make contractual payments (e.g., interest 
payments) under specified terms. Debt represents a fixed prior claim against the compa-
ny’s assets and poses a financial risk to the company. Companies create creditors by issu-
ing industrial bonds or taking loans from financial institutions. Debts are usually secured 
by a certain part of the company’s assets. Creditors have the legal power to enforce pay-
ments and thus potentially drive companies into bankruptcy. When a company declares 
bankruptcy, it must satisfy the claims of creditors in a specific order: (a) secured debts 
(bonds or loans), (b) lawyers’ fees, (c) unpaid wages, and (d) stockholders. Note that bank-
ruptcy lawyers have a payment priority ahead of the hardworking employees and risk-
averse shareholders (Chaplinsky 2010).
Companies seeking debt financing through the issuance of bonds also need to engage an 
underwriting firm and follow a set of prescribed steps. There are several types of bonds: 
(a) corporate bonds, (b) mortgage bonds, (c) convertible bonds (convertible to stocks at a 
fixed price by a given date), and (d) debentures (unsecured bonds). The length of debts 
may be short term (less than one year’s duration), intermediate (one to seven years), or long 
term (more than seven years). There is also an underwriting fee associated with this type 
of public offering.
Companies seeking debt financing through loans will typically negotiate for terms 
and conditions directly with the lending financial institutions involved. The interest rate 
charged is usually the prevalent prime rate plus a surcharge rate. The prime rate is pub-
lished by the Federal Reserve Board on a regular basis as a means to control the liquid-
ity of the financial markets. The surcharge rate varies with the company’s credit rating, 
which in turn depends on the company’s past financial performance and future business 
prospects. The higher the company’s credit rating, the lower is this surcharge rate. Hence, 
better-performing companies may borrow money at cheaper rates. This reflects the lower 
risks involved for the lenders.
The cost of debt capital includes the underwriting fee, bond rate, or interest rate to be 
paid in future periods, the opportunity cost associated with the diminished company 
growth opportunity, and other costs.
The opportunity cost related to reduced growth opportunity results from the fact that 
highly leveraged companies can no longer be as aggressive in pursuing new growth busi-
ness opportunities as they might be in the case of no or minimum leverage. The obligatory 
interest burdens tend to temper the company’s otherwise bold investment strategies. These 
burdens also constrain the company’s investment flexibility and thus cause the company 
to lose the potential benefits that it could otherwise have realized from such new oppor-
tunities. Examples of such new opportunities include the development of new products, 
engagement in leading-edge R&D, entrance into new global markets, and creation of new 
and innovative supply chain partnerships.
The other costs could result from one or more of the following: (1) suboptimal opera-
tional policies that aim at the lower end of a range of sales forecasts; (2) vulnerability of the 
company to attacks by competitors; (3) the company’s inability to access additional debt 
capital, if needed; and (4) the cost of bankruptcy.

Example 7.5
Innovative Products is a company that has enjoyed a high growth rate in recent years. 
Its growth has been largely financed by the retained earnings that belong to the com-
mon stockholders (see Table 7.10).
For the last three years, the company has earned an average annual net income of 
$75,000, after having paid an annual interest of $8,000 and the annual taxes of $50,000. 
The company’s tax rate is 40%.
Company management is considering the strategy of raising $750,000 to double its 
production volume. Of this amount, $500,000 would be used to (1) build an addition to 
the current office building, (2) purchase new IT equipment, and (3) install an advanced 
Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) software system. The remaining amount would 
be needed for working capital to add inventories and to enhance marketing and selling 
activities.
Market research suggests that, despite a doubling of the company’s sales volume, the 
product price can be kept at the current level. The EBIT is projected to be $275,000.
Two specific financing options are to be evaluated closely:
	
1.	 Sell enough additional stock at $30 per share to raise $750,000.
	
2.	 Sell 20-year bonds at 5% interest, totaling $500,000.
Determine which financing option is to be favored from the standpoint of earning 
per share.
Answer 7.5
Earning per share is defined as the company’s net income divided by the number of out-
standing common stocks. To compare the earning per share data for these two financ-
ing options, the income statement must be constructed as in Table 7.11. The following 
explanations may be helpful:

1.	 From the known values of net income ($75,000), tax rate (40%), and inter-
est payment ($8,000) of the present operation, the EBIT is calculated to be 
$133,000.
	
2.	 For the present operation, the number of outstanding common stock is 400,000, 
because the common stock (usually at the par value of $1) is listed as $400,000 
in the company’s balance sheet (see Table 7.10).
	
3.	 For Option 1 and Option 2, the EBIT is known to be $275,000.
	
4.	 For Option 1, the interest charge remains at $8,000, but the number of out-
standing stocks is increased to 425,000.
	
5.	 For Option 2, the interest charge is increased by $25,000 annually due to the 
new loan. However, the old loan is being paid off, reducing the annual interest 
payment by $8000. Thus, the net interest payment is $25,000 per year.
	
6.	 For Option 2, the number of outstanding stocks is increased to 410,000.
	
	   Based on this analysis, the earning per share of Option 1 is larger than 
those of the present operation and Option 2. Equity financing is to be 
preferred.

= cost of debt capital (e.g., 0.08 = yield to maturity [YTM] rate for bonds, plus cost 
associated with lost growth opportunity)
In general, an increase in leverage (e.g., adding more debts) reduces the firm’s WACC. 
This is due to the tax deductibility of interest payments associated with the debt. For many 
companies, WACC is typically in the range of 8%–16%.

7.6.4  Effect of Financial Leverage
Financial leverage denotes the use of debts in financing corporate projects. A measure 
of financial leverage is given by the leverage ratio D/V. The company is said to be highly 
leveraged if its leverage ratio is more than 0.5 (Mathis 2014).
Leverage ratio is known to have an impact on both the variability of reportable earn-
ing per share and the return on equity values. This is illustrated by the following 
example.
Assume that the total assets of a company are $1000. These assets may be financed 
100% by equity (Case A) or by a combination of 40% equity and 60% debt (Case B). 
It is further assumed that under normal circumstances the company’s EBIT is $240. 
The EBIT value may be reduced to $60 under bad economic conditions, but it could be 
increased to $400 under good conditions. The corporate tax rate is assumed to be 50%. 
There is no interest payment in Case A. However, $48 must be paid in Case B as an 
interest charge, which is tax deductible. The net incomes in these cases are different. 
The earning per share and return on equity data reported out by the company vary 
accordingly (see Table 7.12).
Under normal economic conditions, the earning per share is 1.20 in Case A (no debt) and 
2.40 in Case B (with debt). Thus, companies engaged in debt financing will be able to report 
out higher earnings per share data than others that carry no debt, assuming everything 
else being equal.
In the absence of leverage (no debt, Case A), the earning per share varies from 0.3 to 
2.0 and the return on equity from 3.0 to 20 (both from 25% to 167%). When the company 
engages in debt financing, these same ratios vary more widely from 0.15 to 4.40 and from 
1.5 to 44.0 (both from 6.25% to 183%), respectively. Financial leverage compounds the vari-
ability of companies’ financial performance.

7.6.5  Optimum Leverage
The correct selection of the amount of leverage (i.e., debts) is of critical importance to the 
economic health of a firm. Incurring an excessive amount of debt (high leverage) will push 
the company to generate cash for meeting the interest payments, skimp on quality, keep 
inventory low, invest little in maintenance and capital expenditures, and make short-term-
oriented decisions, since the company is not able to capitalize on future growth opportuni-
ties. On the other hand, if the debt level is too low (low leverage), the firm does not feel any 
real pressure to be as efficient as possible (e.g., management will tend to waste resources, 
tolerate excessive scrap, commit capital expenditures loosely, and initiate R&D indiscrimi-
nately) and will suffer from having a higher cost of capital than otherwise because it could 
not take advantage of the tax deductibility of interest payments on debt.
Most firms attempt to assume an optimum amount of leverage. This is because, as the 
leverage exceeds the optimum level, the valuation of the firm experiences a reduction due 
to (a) the cost of bankruptcy, (b) agency costs (e.g., lawyers, courts, and others), and (c) 
preemptive costs (i.e., loss of growth opportunities). Figure 7.2 illustrates such a leverage 
optimum, where Vu is the value of the firm with no leverage.
7.7  Capital Assets Valuation
Financial management deals with three general types of capital assets valuation problems: 
assets in place (operations), opportunities (R&D and marketing), and acquisitions or joint 
ventures.
Capital budgeting problems related to assets in place are those that deliver a predictable 
string of cash flows in the immediate future. Examples include building a new plant facil-
ity, developing new products, and entering a new regional market. Sometimes these prob-
lems are grouped under the heading of operations, as investment in operations usually 
leads to immediate cash flows. Problems related to opportunities arise from decisions that 
do not generate an immediate flow of cash but preserve a likelihood that future gains may 
be realized. Examples include R&D and marketing efforts. The third type of problems is

related to acquisition, joint venture, creation of supply chains, and others, all of which may 
require the company to participate in equity investment and to share future equity cash 
flows with its business partners.
Generally speaking, each of these types of valuation problem is best handled by differ-
ent valuation methods. Larrabee and Voss (2012) suggest a list of recommended methods, 
as shown in Table 7.13.
7.7.1  Operations: Assets in Place
There are several evaluation methods currently in use to assess capital projects in the 
investment category of operations.
7.7.1.1  Discount Cash Flow (Based on WACC)
Today, most companies are using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to determine 
the net present value of an operation with assets in place and assigning WACC to be the 
discount factor:
 
NPV

SV

(7.5)
where:
	NPV		
= net present value (dollars)
	 P	
= initial capital investment (dollars)
	 Ct	
= cash flows = future net benefits (dollars)
	SV	
	
= salvage value recovery at end of project’s useful life (dollars)
	 N	
= total number of periods (year)
	WACC	 = weighted average cost of capital (fraction)
NPV is equal to the present value of all future net benefits (e.g., income minus relevant 
costs), plus discounted salvage value recovery, if any, and minus the initial investment 
capital. It represents the net financial value added to a firm by a given capital investment. 
Projects with large positive NPV values are favored. This method is sometimes called the 
DCF (based on WACC) analysis, as it is based on the use of the weighted cost of capital as the 
all-important discount factor.
Companies accept capital projects if the NPV is greater than zero, meaning that the ini-
tiation of such projects leads to a net positive value added to the companies.

Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
7.7.1.2  Internal Rate of Return
A popular variation of DCF (based on WACC) is the internal rate of return (IRR). When 
applying Equation 7.5 to evaluate projects, IRR is the discount rate that is realizable when 
the present values of all discounted cash flows balance the initial investment (NPV equals 
zero). IRR represents the reinvestment rate, which is held constant over the duration of 
the project. For example, assuming no salvage value, the IRR of a $10,000 investment that 
yields a revenue of $5,000 per year for three years is 23.35%.
In general, companies specify hurdle rates that must be met or exceeded by the IRRs 
of all capital projects acceptable to specific regions (e.g., China, India, Brazil, or Russia). 
By adjusting the hurdle rate according to regional conditions related to market, economy, 
and risk level of the local environment for a specific period involved, companies exercise 
detailed control over the capital investment criteria. The hurdle rates are typically three to 
four times WACC in value.
The major deficiency of IRR is the basic underlining assumption that the interim cash 
flows will be reinvested at the same high rates of return. This may not be realistic in prac-
tice. In contrast, NPV is more realistic, in that its calculation requires only the assumption 
that a company can earn its cost of capital (e.g., WACC) on interim cash flows.
7.7.1.3  Multipliers
Another method to estimate the proper capital investment in a project is to use numerical 
multipliers that are based on historical data. Specifically, average multipliers are defined 
for use in conjunction with commonly available financial data such as sales, book value, 
EBIT, and cash flow.
In general, the financial data of many publicly held companies in various industries 
are widely available in THE literature, including Standard & Poor’s Industry surveys 
and Value Line Industrial surveys. The sales figures of numerous companies are readily 
obtained, and their relationship with company assets is typically recorded as the asset turn 
ratios (see Section 7.4.1). The reciprocal of this ratio is a multiplier that, when used together 
with the known sales figure, provides a rough estimate of the company’s asset value.
For the XYZ Company described in Tables 7.8 and 7.9, the sales to total asset ratio for 
the year 2013 is 0.856(= 395,000/461,500). The reciprocal of this number is 1.168, which 
is the sales multiplier to determine assets. If a sufficient number of other companies in 
the same industry are surveyed, the resulting average industry-based multiplier can be 
used to generate a preliminary estimate of the assets employed to produce known sales 
revenue.
To determine the capital investment value of a plant expansion, new product develop-
ment, and other products, the company’s existing total sales to total asset ratio may serve 
as a good yardstick to ascertain a reasonable capital investment level, but only if the proj-
ect outcome in terms of future sales can be estimated.
How much debt should the company incur to finance a specific project? The debt to asset 
ratio is linked to the debt-to-equity ratio (see Section 7.4.1). For the XYZ Company described 
in Table 7.9, the debt to asset ratio for 2013 is 0.18(= 84,500/461,500). Again, if an industrial 
average is found for this multiplier, it can serve as a useful tool to estimate a reasonable 
debt level for a project on the basis of its known asset value.
Yet another multiplier is related to EBIT. This multiplier is estimated to be 14.49 for the 
XYZ Company in 2013, based on the EBIT to asset ratio of 0.051(= 23,500/461,500) evident 
in Tables 7.8 and 7.9.

236
Engineering Management
The use of some of these multipliers in combination is likely to generate figures that can 
serve as an acceptable ballpark estimate of the required investment for a new project.
7.7.1.4  Monte Carlo Simulations
Monte Carlo simulations refer to a sampling technique that processes input data pre-
sented in the form of distribution functions. All input variables are simultaneously 
varied within each of their respective ranges, as defined by their distribution functions. 
The mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) 
of a given cost model are readily specified in spreadsheet programs (Smith 2000). On 
activating a suitable risk analysis software program, Monte Carlo simulations produce 
one or more outputs that are also in the form of distribution functions (Brandimarte 
2014) (see Section 6.4.2).
In evaluating operations, Monte Carlo simulations may be usefully applied to the DCF 
(based on WACC) method. All future net cash flows and discount rates are modeled by 
distribution functions (e.g., Triangular or Gaussian), as they are expected to vary within 
ranges. The DCF (based on WACC) equation is readily modeled in a spreadsheet program. 
As the sole output, the NPV will also vary between a lower and an upper bound. The 
following results will be helpful to capital budgeting decision-makers:
	
1.	The maximum probability at which the NPV is projected to be negative
	
2.	The probability at which the NPV is projected to exceed a given value (e.g., 
$10 million)
	
3.	The standard deviation of the NPV output
	
4.	The minimum NPV
	
5.	The maximum NPV
Monte Carlo simulations are also applicable to the calculation of IRR for the evaluation 
of operations.
7.7.2  Opportunities: Real Options
The second category of valuation problems is related to opportunities such as R&D and 
marketing projects. These problems do not lend themselves to DCF analyses in the absence 
of projected future cash flows. If there is no cash flow, there can be no net positive present 
value. Financial analysts and researchers in the literature recommend that the European 
simple call option method be used to price these opportunities.
Option is a common tool frequently used for trading securities in the financial markets. 
There are call and put options. A call option provides its holder with the right, but not 
the obligation, to buy 100 shares of an underlying company (e.g., Apple, IBM, or General 
Electric) by a certain expiration date (typically three months from the present) at a specific 
price (strike or exercise price). The holder pays a fee, or premium, to buy the call option, 
which he or she may exercise on any business day leading up to and including the contract 
expiration date. A put option gives its holder the right, but again not the obligation, to sell 
100 shares of stocks within a period of time at a predetermined strike price. Investors who 
predict that the stock price of a given company is going to decline in the future will want 
to sell the stocks today and buy a call option to recover the stocks at a lower price in the 
future. The premium for an option is dependent on five factors: (1) current stock price, 

237
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
(2) strike price, (3) length of option contract, (4) stock price volatility, and (5) current oppor-
tunity cost (e.g., bank interest).
For the purpose of evaluating capital project opportunities, the European simple call 
option is more appropriate, in that the call option can be exercised only on the expiration 
date specified in the contract and no sooner. Table 7.14 shows the equivalence between 
financial calls and real calls.
Companies with new technologies, product development ideas, defensive positions in 
fast-growing markets, and access to new markets have valuable opportunities to explore. 
When dealing with opportunities, three possible scenarios exist: (1) to invest immediately, 
(2) to reject the opportunity right away, and (3) to preserve the option of investing in the 
opportunity at a later time (Ursone 2015; Capinski and Kopp 2012).
This problem may be studied by using the Black–Scholes option pricing model (BSOPM) 
(Black and Scholes 1973), which is defined as

Table 7.15 exhibits the representative data of the N(d) function.
Investment opportunities related to the initiation of new R&D projects or marketing 
programs may be cast into the format of options when exploring the possibilities (1) yes, 
invest now, (2) no, reject the proposal, and (3) buy time to reconsider the same project in the 
near future, as external and internal conditions may change. BSOPM could be applied to 
offer an estimate of the maximum expenditure the company should consider, which could 
be usefully applied to foster the third option (e.g., hiring more R&D experts, understand-
ing R&D efforts of competitors, acquiring additional market intelligence, securing specific 
competitive information, consulting on industrial trends, the future needs of customers, 
or the possibility of new capital formation).

If $1 million is invested immediately, there will be a loss of $100,000 due to the current 
economic conditions and marketing environment. However, if the company waits for 
two years, things may be different. What should the company do, assuming that the 
current risk-free rate is 7% and the project volatility is 0.3?

Now, the company has the alternative of investing $166,042 to preserve investment 
opportunities for two years in addition to deciding for or against it right away. If this 
option is preserved, additional information that will cause a change in the underlying 
asset value may become available during the ensuing two years. The company may still 
decide not to invest in two years, but preserving the option to invest remains a valuable 
alternative.
7.7.3  Acquisitions and Joint Ventures
When companies are being considered as candidates for acquisition, the evaluation of the 
assets of the target companies becomes critically important. A number of methods are 
practiced to assess the value of a company (McKinsey et al. 2015; Vernimmen et al. 2014).
The value of a company is defined by its equity and debt:
 
V
E
D
=
+
 
(7.8)
where:
 V	
= firm’s value in the market
 E	
= equity (stocks)
 D	
= debt outstanding (bonds, loans, etc.)
The company management continues to maximize the candidate firm’s value for its 
shareholders. Two factors may affect this value maximization attempt: (1) takeover bids 
(when the acquiring firms are enticed to pay a higher than normal premium to absorb the 
acquisition candidates) tend to raise the stock price; and (2) stock options (rights to buy stock 
at a fixed price awarded to the company’s management personnel and new hires) tend to 
dilute the shareholder value.
Example 7.7
XYZ Company is considering the acquisition of Target Company, a smaller compet-
itor in the same industry. The income statement of Target Company is displayed in 
Table 7.16. As a stand-alone company, its sales, CGS, depreciation, selling, and adminis-
trative expenses are all projected to increase by 4% per year.
To maintain the projected sales growth of Target Company, XYZ Company must 
make additional working capital investments (see Table 7.16).
	
1.	 Assuming a 10% discount rate, what is the maximum price XYZ Company 
should be willing to pay for this acquisition if it is to be run as a stand-alone 
subsidiary of XYZ Company?

240
Engineering Management
	
2.	 XYZ Company could also integrate Target Company into its existing corpo-
rate IT operations. Web-based customer services, inventory management, 
order processing, and other activities can be readily added to cut down the 
required working capital by 50% from its stand-alone values. There is, how-
ever, an increased IT service charge of $1 million for the first year, and this 
charge increases by 4% per year. Again, assuming a 10% interest rate, what is 
the maximum price XYZ should pay for Target Company under the integration 
scenario?
Answer 7.7
For estimating the present values of cash flows for the period 2010 to infinity, the com-
putations illustrated in Table 7.17 are needed. In Table 7.17, A denotes a constant but 
unknown cash flow defined at the beginning of year 2010.
The present value of cash flow (at the beginning of year 2010) in Table 7.18 is then cal-
culated by the equation A + A(1 − r)/r, where A = 7965/1.1 = 7240.91 and r = 0.05454545.

The same procedure is to be applied to determine the present value of required working 
capital, which turns out to be $133,333 (see Table 7.18).
Since the NPV of Target Company, as a stand-alone operation, is negative, it does not 
justify being acquired by XYZ Company.
On the other hand, if XYZ integrates Target Company into its IT operations, the value 
of this target company is significantly improved, as displayed in Table 7.19.
Under the integration scenario, Target Company is worth about $48 million. Any pur-
chase price below this figure will denote a net gain for XYZ Company.

7.7.3.1  Common Stock Valuation Model (Dividend Valuation Model)
The stock price of the acquisition target company depends on the dividend stream it is able 
to generate. The dividend valuation model offers an estimate of the acquisition candidate’s 
stock price as the sum of the present values of its future dividends:
 
P
D
r
o
t
t
t
=
+
(
)
=
∞
∑1
1
	
(7.9)
where:
 Po	
	
= equity price
 Dt	
	
= dividend payout (DPS) per period
	 r = Ke	
= cost of equity capital incurred by the firm
Upper limit	 = infinite (going concern)
Two special cases may be considered:
	
1.	Constant dividend
	
	 If Dt = Do = constant, then
 
P
D
r
o
o
=
= capitalized value of dividend  
(7.10)
	
	
The stock price Po is equivalent to a single present value that is capable of pro-
ducing a stream of constant dividends of value Do indefinitely. (The derivation of 
this closed-form solution is included in Appendix 7.C.)
	
2.	Finite holding period
	
	
For investors who hold a given stock for only N periods and plan to sell the 
stock at the price Pn thereafter, the stock price may be calculated as
 
P
D
r
P

(7.11)
where:
 r	
= effective rate of return required by the market of the firm’s stock, equal to the cost 
of equity capital incurred by the firm (Ke)
 Pn	
= investment recovery at the end of N periods
Once the stock price is known, the total value of the acquisition candidates is then equal 
to the stock price multiplied by the outstanding number of its stocks.
7.7.3.2  Dividend Growth Model
If the target company is capable of paying out dividends that grow at an annual rate of g 
percent, then its stock price is calculated as the capitalized dividend value at a rate equal 
to the cost of capital minus the dividend growth rate:
 
P
D
K
g
o
e
=
−
(
)
1
	
(7.12)

243
Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
where:
	 g	
= growth rate of dividend per share (percent)
	Ke	
= cost of equity capital (note: Ke > g)
	D1	
= dividend for the next period (dollars/share)
(The derivation of this equation is given in Appendix 7.D.)
The growth rate of annual dividend is calculated by the equation
 
g
b
=
−
(
)
1
ROE  
(7.13)
where:
	ROE	= net income/average equity capital
	 b	
= payout ratio of dividend = dividend payout/net income
	1 − b	= retained dividend ratio = dividend retained/net income
In Equation 7.13, the assumption is made that the company management is capable 
of applying the retained earnings to foster dividend growth in the current year at the 
same rate as that of the ROE that was accomplished by the company in the previous 
fiscal year.
7.7.3.3  Modified Earning Model
The stock price of a company that reinvests retained earnings to generate dividend growth 
is delineated by the equation
 
P
K
o
e
=
+
EPS
PVGO
1
	
(7.14)
where:
 EPS1	
= earning per share in the next period
 Ke	
= cost of equity capital
 PVGO	= present value of growth opportunities
Now, EPS1/Ke is the capitalized value of EPS, and PVGO is the net present value of all 
returns (on the per share basis) generated by having reinvested the retained earnings at 
the rate of ROE. Specifically,

Example 7.8
The company’s stock is selling now at $50 per share. Its expected dividend next 
year is $2.00 per share. A 20% annual growth of dividend is anticipated for the next 
three years. From the fourth year on, its dividend growth rate will be reduced to 
only 6% annually. What is the expected long-term rate of return (R) from buying this 
stock at $50?
Answer 7.8
On the basis of the dividend model, we would formulate the following equation for 
evaluating the overall rate of return:

By trial and error, R = 0.11153. The long-term rate of return of this stock is 11.153%.
Example 7.9
The company expects a total sales revenue of $20 million and a total cost, including tax, 
of $15 million in the forthcoming year. During the subsequent five years (e.g., Year 2 
to Year 6), the revenues and costs will increase by 25% per year, and all profits will be 
reinvested into the business. Thereafter, the company’s growth will decrease to only 5% 
per year, and the company will need to reinvest only 40% of its profits.
If the company is offered $75 million in cash by a major competitor, is this a fair acqui-
sition price, assuming the cost of capital is 12%?

7.7.3.4  Equity Cash Flows
For the valuation problems related to joint ventures and partnerships, ownership claims 
and equity cash flows must be evaluated. Financial specialists are typically involved in 
evaluating such problems by using sophisticated computer programs and models. For 
detailed discussions of this type of evaluation, see Luehrman (1997). Other advanced 
corporate finance issues are discussed by Damodaran (2014).
Capital budgeting is a managerial responsibility related to the company’s capital 
investments. Capital budgeting decisions are made on the basis of certain rational decision 
criteria. Engineering managers are advised to acquire the necessary background knowl-
edge to become effective contributors to such decision-making processes.
7.8  Conclusion
This chapter introduces the basic accrual principle of financial accounting and discusses 
the workings of income statements, balance sheets, and funds flow statements, with 
explanations of all applicable accounting terms. Also pointed out are the ways in which 
contributions by engineering managers are recorded in these financial statements.
Ratio analysis uses the financial data contained in these statements to assess companies’ 
financial health. EVA is described as an upgraded method of reporting the true financial 
value created by a company, a unit, or a specific project.
The shortcomings of ratio analysis are outlined, and a broad-based system of measure-
ment metrics (the balanced scorecard) is illustrated. An adoption of this broad-based met-
rics system by corporate America will likely shift corporate management’s attention from 
being predominantly focused on short-term financial results to a balanced emphasis on 
corporate long-term growth. This is possible with the use of metrics that address impor-
tant competitive factors such as customer satisfaction, continuous improvement of inter-
nal business processes, and innovation for growth. As such broad-based measurement 
metrics become widespread, the critical contributions made by engineering managers will 
be increasingly recognized and rewarded.
This chapter also reviews the basic elements of financial management: raising and 
applying investment capital. Equity and debt financing are the two most common ways 
of obtaining financing. There are costs involved in each: the cost of equity capital and the 
cost of debt capital.
There are different types of capital projects in which a company might invest: operations 
(assets in place), opportunities (R&D and marketing), acquisitions, and joint ventures.
Different evaluation methods are used for these capital projects. For example, DCF (based 
on WACC), IRR, multipliers, and Monte Carlo simulations are useful for evaluating opera-
tions. Option pricing is suitable for evaluating opportunities for which there are no predict-
able cash flows. Acquisitions and joint ventures are advanced financial topics, the evaluation 
of which should be deferred to knowledgeable financial specialists on the subject.

246
Engineering Management
Benjamin Disraeli said, “As a general rule, the most successful man in life is the man 
who has the best information.” Financial information is part of the best information STEM 
professionals should have.
Engineering managers are advised to become well prepared to actively participate in 
the company’s capital budgeting process by becoming familiar with the sources and costs 
of capital as well as the evaluation criteria adopted for capital budgeting. Doing so will 
enable them to constantly bring forth and screen useful projects and valuable opportuni-
ties (including risks assessment) and to be in a position to initiate winning capital project 
proposals on a timely basis.

2.	As the vice president of engineering of the Best Company in Buffalo, you need to 
make a decision regarding how a new product is to be manufactured. You have 
been offered two specific proposals. Proposal A is to set up an assembly opera-
tion in-house and to outsource the production of all subassemblies and parts 
to supply chain partners. This proposal would need a front-end investment of 
$2,000,000 for the assembly operations, an investment of $300,000 for the product 
design and development efforts, and another $100,000 for managing and coor-
dinating the supply chain partners. The projected net profits for the products 
manufactured by this method are $0, $300,000, $600,000, $900,000, $1,200,000, 
and $600,000 in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth year, respectively. 
There is no salvage value of the assembly equipment at the end of the sixth year, 
at which time the sales of this product will be terminated. Interest is at 5.0%.
	
	
Proposal B is to build a production facility to manufacture all subassemblies 
and assemble the products in-house. This proposal would need a front-end invest-
ment of $3,000,000, which includes facility, equipment, engineering, and all other 
required efforts. The projected net profits for the products manufactured by this 
method are $200,000, $400,000, $800,000, $1,200,000, $1,000,000, and $600,000 for 
the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth year, respectively. There is a salvage 
value of $400,000 of the facility at the end of the sixth year. Interest is also at 5%.
	
	
Which proposal should you accept, and why?
	
3.	The ABC Company supplies products to a number of original equipment manu-
facturers (OEMs). It employs 5000 mostly unionized workers and generates about 
$2.2 billion in revenue annually. In 2012, it won an “Excellence Award” from one of 
its major client companies for having supplied an OEM product at the quality level 
of 10 defects per million in three consecutive years, thereby exceeding the specific 
target of 15 defects per million set by this client.
	
	
However, the corporate parent of the ABC Company was less than happy with 
its financial performance. It declared this subsidiary a “Troubled Operation” in 
2013, giving notice that if its business performance did not improve within a cer-
tain time frame, the ABC Company would be closed down or divested. The spe-
cific financial targets set by the corporate parent consisted of (1) NOPAT to sales 
ratio at 5%, (2) EBIT to sales ratio at 10%, and (3) ROA at 22.5%.
	
	
Needless to say, ABC’s management worked diligently to find ways to improve 
the company’s business performance. One strategy was to induce 700 early retire-
ments from the unionized workforce by November 2013. However, as of April 
2014, only 480 workers had signed up for this heavily promoted early retirement 
program that qualified them each to receive a $35,000 cash incentive.
	
	
Besides encouraging workers to retire earlier, what other strategies do you 
think the ABC Company should pursue to achieve all three of the noted financial 
targets?
	
4.	The company is considering the introduction of a new product that is expected to 
reach sales of $10 million in its first full year and $13 million of sales in the second 

248
Engineering Management
and third years. Thereafter, annual sales are expected to decline to two-thirds of 
peak annual sales in the fourth year and one-third of peak sales in the fifth year. 
No more sales are expected after the fifth year.
	
	
The CGS is about 60% of the sales revenues in each year. The GS&A expenses 
are about 23.5% of the sales revenue. Tax on profits is to be paid at a 40% rate.
	
	
A capital investment of $0.5 million is needed to acquire production equipment. 
No salvage value is expected at the end of its five-year useful life. This investment 
is to be fully depreciated on a straight-line basis over five years.
	
	
In addition, working capital is needed to support the expected sales in an 
amount equal to 27% of the sales revenue. This working capital investment must 
be made at the beginning of each year to build up the needed inventory and imple-
ment the planned sales program.
	
	
Furthermore, during the first year of sales activity, a one-time product intro-
ductory expense of $200,000 is incurred. Approximately $1.0 million has already 
been spent promoting and test marketing the new product.
	
a.	 Formulate a multiyear income statement to estimate the cash flows throughout 
its five-year life cycle.
	
b.	 Assuming a 20% discount rate, what is the new product’s NPV?
	
c.	 Should the company introduce the new product?
	
5.	The New Spirit Corporation has CLs of $130,000 with a current ratio of 2.5:1. 
Indicate whether the individual transactions specified next increase or decrease 
the current ratio or the amount of working capital, and by how much in each case. 
Treat each item separately.
	
a.	 Purchase is made of $10,000 worth of merchandise on account.
	
b.	 The company collects $5000 in accounts receivable.
	
c.	 Repayment is planned of note payable that is due in the current period with 
$15,000 cash from bank account.
	
d.	 The acquisition of a machine priced at $40,000 is paid for with $10,000 cash, 
and the lump-sum balance is due in 18 months.
	
e.	 The company conducts a sale of machinery for $10,000. Accumulated deprecia-
tion is $50,000, and its original cost is $80,000.
	
f.	 The company pays dividends of $10,000 in cash and $10,000 in stock.
	
g.	 Wages are paid to the extent of $15,000. Of this amount, $3000 had been shown 
on the balance sheet as accrued (due).
	
h.	 The company borrows $30,000 for one year. Proceeds are used to increase the 
bank account by $10,000 to pay off accounts due to the supplier ($15,000) and to 
acquire the right to patents ($5,000).
	
i.	 The company writes down inventories by $7000 and organization expenses by 
$5000.
	
j.	 The company sells $25,000 worth (cost) of merchandise from stock to custom-
ers who pay in 30 days. The company has a gross margin of 40%.

7.	For the current fiscal year that starts on January 1, 2015, Buffalo Best Company 
projects its financial performance as shown in Tables 7.23 and 7.24.
	
	
In fiscal year 2015, the products of the company are priced at $10,000 each. The 
company president predicts that, because of the generally anticipated recovery 
of the U.S. economy, there will be a 4% per year increase in each of the next four 
years (i.e., 2016 to 2019) in (a) price of the company’s products and (b) number

of products sold. However, the company’s administrative and selling expenses, 
as well as the product cost per unit, are projected to increase by 7% per year. 
Other expenses, such as R&D, interests, depreciation, and corporate tax rate, will 
remain unchanged. The anticipated increase in product cost is primarily due to 
an increase in materials costs and a decrease in labor productivity because of 
high turnover rate, poor employee supervision, inadequate workforce compensa-
tion policy, cumbersome production processes, and inferior employee training. 
If nothing is done, the company expects its net income to decrease by as much as 
50% around 2018–2019.
	
	
At a management meeting on February 12, 2015, the vice president of engineering 
proposed to hire a consulting firm in the second half of 2015 to develop a customized 
program for improving labor productivity. She noted that three options are currently 
available at different investment prices and projected CGS reduction levels:
Program
Investment
CGS Reduction Percentage
A
$700,000
1.0
B
$1,100,000
2.0
C
$1,200,000
3.0
	
	
The investment for any one of these options will be a one-time lump sum that can 
be expensed as an increase in overhead in 2015. The benefits of the consultation pro-
gram will be realized in a projected reduction of product cost per unit (i.e., the orig-
inally anticipated product cost before the management consultation program) by a 
percentage (1%, 2%, or 3%, respectively) per year for the next four years (i.e., 2016–2019).
	
	
The company president welcomes the idea of management consultation as a 
possible way to enhance workforce productivity. Assuming that the company’s

he should approve.
	
8.	The company’s vice president of marketing proposes a new program to signifi-
cantly increase the product sales by 250,000 units per year throughout the 2016–2022 
period. Specifically, it is suggested that the company takes the following actions:
	
a.	 Spend $2.5 million over the period of 2016–2018 as promotional expenditures— 
for example, spend $1.0 million each in the years 2016 and 2017, and $0.5 mil-
lion in the year 2018.
	
b.	 Make a one-time investment of $1.4 million in plants and equipment needed 
at the beginning of 2016 to generate these additional products. No new ware-
house capability is needed. This investment is to be depreciated on a straight-
line basis over the seven-year period. There will be no salvage values for these 
plants and equipment in 2019.
	
	
It is further assumed that the product unit cost is $8.00 in 2016, and it is esti-
mated to increase by 3% per year. The product unit price is $20 in 2016, and it is 
estimated to change as shown in the following table:

The SG&A expenditure is estimated at $1.25 million in 2016, and it will increase 
by 3% per year during the six-year period. A corporate tax of 40% must be paid 
for any marginal income. There is an interest charge during this period, and the 
company’s WACC is 8%.
	
	
If the company’s hurdle rate for this type of investment is 25%, would you rec-
ommend that the marketing initiative be approved?
	
9.	One of the company’s technology patents is about to expire, inducing a likely rush of 
product entries from the competition. Currently, the product line is projected to have 
stagnant sales of one million units for the next seven years from 2015 to 2022. The 
unit price is expected to decrease slightly by 1% per year during the same period.
	
	
The profitability of this product is estimated to be $1,166,000 in 2015, as indi-
cated in Table 7.25.
	
	
Both the CGS and the SG&A expenses are expected to increase by 3% per year 
from 2015 to 2022. The depreciation charge is estimated to remain constant at $1

million per year, and there is no salvage value for the equipment at the end of 2021. 
If the product is continued as planned, the company can recover a working capital 
of $3.9 million at the end of 2021 from sales of residual inventory and collection of 
accounts receivable after having discharged all applicable short-term liabilities.
	
	
If the management decides to discontinue this product line at the end of 2014, 
it can sell the fixed assets related to the product line (having a book value of 
$7 million) for about $3 million, and the loss of $4 million will be tax deduct-
ible. Furthermore, the company can recover the working capital (inventory plus 
accounts receivable, minus accounts payable and other expenses) worth about 
$3.9 million at the end of 2014.
	
	
Assuming that the appropriate discount rate is 12%, would you recommend that 
this product line be discontinued at the end of 2014 or continued through 2021?
	
	
What is the next-best alternative open to the company, besides either shutting it 
down immediately at the end of 2014 or continuing to run it till 2021?
	 10.	Define the EVA of XYZ Company, whose income statement and balance sheet 
are shown in Tables 7.8 and 7.9. Assume that the WACC is 12.35% for both years. 
Discuss the EVA results and contrast them with the EVA results for Superior 
Technologies (Tables 7.20 and 7.21), for which WACC is also assumed to be 12.35%.
	 11.	The 2013–2014 income statement and balance sheet for Buffalo Best are presented 
in Tables 7.23 and 7.24. The WACC for Buffalo Best is 10% for both years. Review 
and comment on the performance of the company based on the following:
	
a.	 Liquidity, activity, and profitability
	
b.	 Uses and sources of funds
	
c.	 Value creation based on EVA analysis
	 12.	Company X manufactures technology products. It plans to expand its manufac-
turing operations. Based on past data, management anticipates the first project 
year of the as-yet-to-be-expanded operations to match the data in Table 7.26.
	
a.	 Compute the working capital requirement during this project year.
	
b.	 Determine the taxable income during this project year.
	
c.	 Calculate the net income during this project year.
	
d.	 Define the net cash flow from this project during the first year.
	 13.	The company has 10,000 shares of common stock outstanding, and the current 
price of the stock is $100 per share. The company has no debt. The vice president 
of engineering discovers an opportunity to invest in a new technology project 
that yields positive cash flows with a present value of $210,000. The total initial 
capital that is required for investing and developing this project is only $110,000. It 
is proposed that capital be raised by issuing new equity. All potential purchasers 
of common stock will be fully aware of the new project’s value and cost, and are 
willing to pay “fair value” for the new shares of the company.
	
a.	 What is the NPV of this project?
	
b.	 How many shares of common stock must be issued, and at what price, to raise 
the required capital, assuming the costs of underwriting these new shares are 
negligible?
	
c.	 What is the effect, if any, of this new project on the value of the stock of exist-
ing shareholders?

	 14.	XYZ Company is financed by debt (50%), preferred stocks (20%), and common 
equity (30%). Its common stock price is $43 per share. It pays a dividend of $3.00 
and has a growth rate of −2%. Its annual preferred stock dividend is $82 per $1000 
share with a flotation cost of 7.5% per share. The interest for long-term debt is 11%. 
Its corporate tax rate is 30%.
	
	
What is the company’s WACC?
	 15.	ABC Company receives a contract from one of its major customers. The con-
tract calls for 20,000  hours of work billed at $75 per hour to be completed 
within one year. The normal billable work for each engineer is 2000 hours per 
year. Thus, the contract requires the involvement of 10 full-time engineers. At 
the present time, the company has only six full-time engineers who may be 
able to work on this contract. The engineers’ wages average $40 per hour. If 
the engineers are to work overtime, their overtime pay is time and a half (i.e., 
$60 per hour).
	
a.	 What would be the contribution margin if 10 engineers were available with no 
need to work overtime?
	
b.	 What would be the contribution margin if all six engineers were used full time 
and the deficiency made up through 8000 hours of overtime?
	
c.	 What would be the contribution margin if the company hired two more full-
time engineers and made up the rest with overtime?
	
d.	 If the cost of recruiting and training each new engineer is $15,000, what would 
be the contribution margin on hiring two new engineers, after factoring in 
recruiting and training costs?
	 16.	New Spirit Company plans to install a new production line consisting of several 
precision machines costing a total of $800,000. The installation of these machines 
requires another $150,000. The products made by the machines are projected 
to deliver a net income after tax of $400,000 per year for the next 10 years. The

	 17.	Using the data contained in Tables 7.20 and 7.21, conduct an evaluation of Superior 
Technologies’ common stock in 2014, using the three different methods specified, 
as follows:
	
a.	 The market value of the company’s net property has risen, and it is now about 
two times the value reported in the balance sheet. Calculate the stock price by 
using its net asset value as a basis.
	
b.	 Assuming that the company’s cost of equity (Ke) is 16%, determine the stock 
price by applying the dividend growth model.
	
c.	 Price to earning (P/E) ratio reflects the general sentiment of the securities mar-
ket toward a specific company or the industry in general. Assuming that the 
average P/E ratio is about 10 for the industry, of which the company is a mem-
ber, define the stock price, using the earning model.
	 18.	Company A has been performing reasonably well over the last several years. 
Table 7.27 shows an abbreviated set of its financial data for the years 2009–2014.
	
a.	 Analyze the company’s dividend–payout ratio to common stockholders, and 
comment on the suitability of this dividend policy.
	
b.	 Discuss the debt financing policy of this company over the years. In your opin-
ion, does the long-term debt of the company represent too high (aggressive) or 
too low (conservative) a percentage in its capital structure? Why?
	
c.	 Do you regard the percentage of common stock equity in the company’s capital 
structure as adequate, and why?
	
d.	 For 2004, the company needs an influx of $30 million to finance business 
expansion. Which financing option should the company pursue? Why?
	 19.	Company B is currently financed by common stock equity. It is considering two 
alternative ways of financing in order to increase the return on common equity. 
Table 7.28 lists the two options under consideration, along with the base case.

The company’s capitalization and EBIT remain constant at $30 million and 
$3  million, respectively. The composition of the capitalization changes from 
100% common stock equity (base case) to a mix of common and preferred stocks 
(Option A) and to a mix of common stock and long-term debt (Option B).
	
	
The corporate tax rate is 40%. Dividends of preferred stocks are paid at a 5% 
rate. The interest charge for the long-term debt is 4%.
	
a.	 Compute the rate of return on common stock equity for the three cases. Explain 
why these numbers change from one case to another.
	
b.	 Compute the rate of return on capitalization for the three cases.
	
c.	 Among the three cases indicated, which financing option is to be preferred by 
the company, and why?
	 20.	Company X is planning to introduce a new service that is expected to reach sales 
of $10 million in its first full year and $13 million of sales in the second and third 
years. Thereafter, annual sales are expected to decline to two-thirds of peak 
annual sales in the fourth year, and one-third of peak sales in the fifth year. No 
more sales are expected after the fifth year.
	
	
The CGS is about 60% of the sales revenues in each year. The SG&A expenses 
are about 23.5% of the sales revenue. Tax on profits is to be paid at a 40% corporate 
rate.
	
	
A capital investment of one-half of a million dollars is needed to acquire the 
service delivery equipment. No salvage value is expected at the end of its five-year 
useful life. This investment is to be fully depreciated on a straight-line basis over 
five years.
	
	
In addition, working capital is needed to support the expected sales in an 
amount equal to 27% of the sales revenue of a given year. This working capital 
investment must be made at the beginning of each year to build up the needed 
sales support elements to implement the planned sales program.
	
	
Furthermore, during the first year of sales activity, a one-time service intro-
ductory expense of $200,000 is incurred. Approximately $1.0 million had 
already been spent promoting and test marketing the new service before the 
sales started.
	
a.	 Formulate a multiyear income statement to estimate the cash flows throughout 
its five-year life cycle.
	
b.	 Assuming a 15% discount rate, what is the new product’s NPV?
	
c.	 Should the company introduce the new service?

Appendix 7.A: T-Accounts
Accountants use T-accounts as tools to register transactions in preparation for creating 
financial statements. T-accounts are set up for any items that are assets, liabilities, equities, 
or other temporary holding entries. A T-account, as displayed in Figure 7.A1, looks like the 
letter “T.” On the left side of the “T,” debits are recorded and on the right side, credits are 
recorded. This type of entry is also known as double-entry bookkeeping.
Following the double-entry bookkeeping practice, every transaction affects at least two 
entries. This is to ensure that a balance is continuously maintained between both the 
assets of, and the claims against, the company. Figure 7.A2 illustrates some transactions 
related to T-accounts.
The company’s assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, land, machines, plant 
facilities, marketable securities, and other resources of value. Liabilities include accounts 
payable, accrued expenses, long-term debts, and other claims creditors have against the 
company. Owners’ equities include stocks, surplus, retained earnings, and other claims of 
the owners against the company. Equation 7.17 depicts the balance between assets (A) and 
claims consisting of liabilities (L) and owners’ equities (OE):

Engineering Management
The convention of T-accounts is: to increase the amount of an asset, debit the account; 
conversely, to decrease an asset amount, credit the account. All liabilities and owners’ 
equities accounts are treated in the opposite way: that is, to increase a liability or equity 
amount, credit the account; and to lessen a liability or equity amount, debit the account.
For accounts that do not fall directly into one of these three categories (i.e., A = assets, 
L = liabilities, and OE = owners’ equities), we need to first define their relationships to 
either A, L, or OE and then treat them accordingly. Revenues, expenses, and dividends are 
examples of these.
Revenues raise the net income of the company. The resulting net income goes into the 
retained earnings account for the owners. Thus, an increase of revenues needs to be cred-
ited to the owners’ equity T-account. The company’s expenses are generally deducted from 
its revenues to arrive at its net income. An increase in expenses results in a reduction of 
net income and consequently a reduction of owners’ equities. Therefore, an increase of 
expenses needs to be debited to the owners’ equity T-account. Similarly, an increase in 
dividends paid to shareholders whittles down the residual net income amount, which is 
then added to the retained earnings account of the owners. Thus, an increase of dividends 
needs to be debited to the owners’ equity T-account. Table 7.A1 summarizes the ways in 
which increases in the indicated assets, liabilities, owners’ equities, or other amounts 
should be treated in their respective T-accounts.
For engineers and engineering managers who are familiar with equations, the rule 
that follows may represent a convenient way of keeping them better oriented with the 
T-account convention. Rearranging the basic accounting equation (Equation 7.17), we get
 
LHS =
−
−
=
A
L
OE
0  
(7.18)
where LHS stands for the “left-hand side” of the equals sign. Note that for each finan-
cial transaction, there are two account entries. The account entry that causes the LHS 
to increase temporarily should be debited to its respective T-account. Examples include 
increases in all assets and decreases in all liabilities and owners’ equities. The account 
entry that leads to a temporary reduction of the LHS should be credited to its respective 
T-account. Equation 7.18 remains valid after both entries of the financial transaction are 
entered.

Financial Accounting and Management for Engineering Managers
Accountants use T-accounts to collect raw financial data, which they check and 
recheck for validity and reliability. Then they make sure that the data are relevant to the 
accounting period at hand and consistent with past practices. Finally, to ensure compa-
rability, accountants regroup them into known line items typically included in financial 
statements.
Example 7.10
Study the following accounts, which contain several transactions keyed together with 
letters:
Cash
Oﬃce equipment

Utilities expenses
(b) 2500
(f) 3500
(d) 8625
(g) 160
Explain the nature of each transaction with the dollar amount involved.
Answer 7.10
	 (a)	 Convert capital of $9000, add $6000 to the cash account, and purchase books 
worth $3000 for the Law Library.
	 (b)	 Pay the prepaid rent of $2500 in cash.
	 (c)	 Pay office supplies of $150 in cash.
	 (d)	 Purchase office equipment ($8500) and office supplies ($125) by credit, creating 
an account payable of $8625.
	 (e)	 Receive the $1300 legal fees earned in cash.
	 (f)	 Pay accounts payable of $3500 in cash.
	 (g)	 Pay utilities expenses of $160 in cash.
Appendix 7.B: Financial Risks
In general, the outcome (i.e., earnings) of any investment has a degree of inherent uncer-
tainty: large in some cases and small in others. Investment risk is defined as the measure 
of potential variability of earning from its expected value. It is usually modeled math-
ematically by the standard deviation of the outcome when the outcome is expressed in the 
form of a probability density distribution function (e.g., a Gaussian distribution function; 
see Section 6.4.3). For common stocks, risk is modeled by a relative volatility index, Beta, 
as defined in Figure 7.1.
The rate of return on risky security can be modeled as the risk-free rate plus a risk 
premium:
 
r
R
Rp
f
=
+
	
(7.19)

260
Engineering Management
The risk-free rate (e.g., Rf  equals some constant rate, such as 6.0% for 10-year U.S. Treasury 
bills) is the return for compensation of opportunity cost without uncertainties. The risk 
premium Rp is the additional return needed to compensate for the added risks the inves-
tors undertake.
Figure 7.A3 illustrates several investment examples and displays the general risk–reward 
correlation between expected annual return and the associated risk of the investment in 
question. An investor may realize only 6% from the risk-free U.S. Treasury Bills, but a 
whopping 25% from highly precarious junk bonds.
	
1.	Expected value is the return of an outcome multiplied by its probability of occur-
rence. For a portfolio containing N independent investments, the total expected 
return is the sum of the products of individual returns and their respective prob-
abilities of occurrence. The total expected return is the average return weighted by 
probability factors:

where:
	
Ri	 = return of investment I
 
Pi	 = single-valued probability of occurrence of Ri
 
[∑Pi; i = 1 to N] = 1
	
2.	Risk aversion delineates the generally expected unwillingness on the part of inves-
tors to assume risks without earning the commensurate benefits. Most investors 
are unwilling to assume risks unless there are incremental benefits (the risk pre-
mium) that compensate them for bearing the added risks involved. Some auda-
cious investors are more willing than others to take on additional risks for the 
sake of gaining the added benefits.

Table 7.A2 exhibits an example in which the behavior of risk-averse investors can 
be studied. Investment A has a nominal value of $100 when the economy is in a nor-
mal state. This investment is projected to be valued at $90 if the economy goes into 
a recession in the near future. On the other hand, its value may increase to $110 if 
the economy booms. Investment B also has a nominal value of $100 when the economy 
is normal, but its value decreases to zero in a recession and increases to $200 in a 
booming economy.
If we further assume that there is an equal probability of 33.33% that the state of the 
future economy will be either normal, in recession, or in a booming state, then the expected 
payoff value of these two investments is identical (e.g., $100); however, their amounts at 
risk are different: −$10 for Investment A and −$100 for Investment B.
Between these two investment options, a risk-averse investor will choose Investment A 
for its lower downside risk; he or she will not choose Investment B, because there is no gain 
in return for the added risks. A risk-preferring investor will choose Investment B for its 
reward potential of doubling the money if the economy booms in the future.

Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
8.1  Introduction
Companies have essentially two major activities: marketing and innovation. Marketing is 
the whole business of the enterprise seen from the perspectives of customers. The purpose 
of marketing is to provide products and services that meet the needs and wants of cus-
tomers. Marketing impacts the top line (i.e., sales revenue) of any enterprise. Innovation 
strengthens the enterprise’s competitive marketing ability to sustain profitability by way 
of timely application of unique technologies and other core competencies (Kotler 2015; 
Burrow and Fowler 2015).
In general, science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals are 
known to be technologically innovative. If they can also master marketing, the result-
ing combined capabilities will likely enable them to contribute significantly toward 
creating business success for their employers and thus propel them to higher leadership 
positions.
The objective of this chapter is to prepare managers for effective interaction with mar-
keting and sales personnel in companies offering technology-based products and services. 
Emphasis is given to the introduction and application of marketing concepts for engineer-
ing and technology products and services (Tracy 2014; Kerin et al. 2014). The topics that 
will be discussed include marketing management processes in profit-seeking organiza-
tions, identification of opportunities and threats facing an organization, and key strategies 
in the marketing of products and services.
STEM professionals are encouraged to continue studying additional current references 
on specific issues in marketing management.
8.2  Function of Marketing
Marketing and sales personnel are critically important to profit-seeking companies 
because they strive to ensure satisfaction in the exchange of values between the producers 
and consumers of products and services, as exhibited in Figure 8.1.
8.2.1  Sales versus Marketing
Sales is a process by which producers attempt to motivate target customers to buy the avail-
able products. The mentality behind sales, as illustrated in Figure 8.2, is that “someone out 

266

there will need the products.” At the time when Ford Motor Company was the dominant 
carmaker in Detroit, the well-known saying attributed to Henry Ford was, “You can have 
any color you want for your car, as long as it is black.” Sales does not take the customers’ 
concerns into account.
In contrast, companies with a marketing orientation offer something that customers 
want by seeking feedback from the marketplace, adjusting the product offerings, and 
increasing the product’s value to consumers (see Figure 8.3).
In the pursuit of marketing strategies, companies solicit intelligence, financial data, 
and customers’ responses to constantly reassess the market. They evaluate such factors 
as product reliability, safety, competition, cost-effectiveness, product substitution, and 
maturity of products. A long-term orientation ensures that benefits for both producers and 
customers will be sustained. Sales strategies are only a part of marketing (O’Keefe 2013; 
Dannenberg and Zupancic 2014).
8.2.2  Marketing Process
The marketing efforts of companies are typically centered on four specific dimensions 
(McDonald and Wilson 2011):

promotion)

1.	Customer focus: The purpose of a profit-seeking business is to understand custom-
ers’ needs, deliver value to customers, and offer services to ensure that customers 
are satisfied. In other words, the customer comes first. All product designers must 
pay more heed to customers.
	
2.	Competitor orientation: Companies seek advantages relative to their competitors, 
monitor their behaviors, and respond to their strategic moves.
	
3.	Interfunctional coordination: Companies integrate all functions, share information, 
and organize themselves to provide added value to the customers.
	
4.	Profit orientation: Companies attempt to make profits in both the short term and the 
long term.
To achieve business success, companies must search constantly for future markets, in 
addition to actively serving today’s markets. The primary responsibility of the marketing 
department is to scan the relevant business environment for future opportunities (such as 
what bundle of products and services to offer to whom, at what price, at what time, and in 
which market segments) and to provide insight into the needs of current customers and 
the intentions of competitors.
Presented in Figure 8.4 is the marketing process, which is iterative in nature. This pro-
cess defines opportunities (unsatisfied needs) in the marketplace; the features of products

or services to satisfy these needs; and the pricing, promotion, distribution, physical evi-
dence, process design, and people strategies to reach the target market segments under 
consideration. Market segments refer to specific groups of customers who share similar 
purchasing preferences, as identified by the company to sell products/services to.
For companies to succeed in the marketplace, marketing must be a core activity cen-
tral to the company’s strategy formulation and execution. Through marketing, companies 
identify and satisfy the needs of customers and achieve long-term profitability by attract-
ing and retaining customers. Specific tasks undertaken to attain these objectives include 
(1) interacting with and understanding the market and its customers, (2) planning long-
term marketing strategies, and (3) implementing short-term tactical marketing programs.
The effectiveness of a marketing program is often measured by two metrics: (1) how 
attractive the company’s products and services are to the target customers and (2) how suc-
cessfully the company can satisfy and retain these target customers. Figure 8.5 illustrates 
the marketing effectiveness diagram.
The marketing program of a company is regarded as a total success if both customer 
retention and product attractiveness to customers are high. This is when high profitability 
can be achieved at a maximum growth rate. The marketing program scores a partial suc-
cess if the product attractiveness to the customer is high, but the customer retention is low. 
While lost customers are typically replaced by new customers, the total customer base 
will show little growth. Partial failure is assigned to a marketing program when product 
attractiveness to the customer is low, but the customer retention is high. Under this sce-
nario, business remains stagnant because it relies on loyal customers to repeatedly buy 
mature, noncompetitive products. The company’s sales may slow down or fall as few new 
customers are added. The marketing program is a total failure if both product attractiveness 
to the customer and the customer retention level are low. Customers are leaving, and the 
company’s sales are falling.
Marketing strategies are implemented at the corporate, business, and operational 
levels. Top management provides inputs toward identifying future opportunities, and 
addresses questions such as what business the company is in and what business the com-
pany should be in. The business managers then devise the proper marketing plan to

bring out products or services, and strive to create and maintain a sustainable competi-
tive advantage in the marketplace. At the operational level, managers and support per-
sonnel conduct planning for specific marketing programs, and implement and control 
marketing efforts related to segmentation, product design, pricing, distribution channels, 
and communications.
8.2.3  Key Elements in Marketing
Those who plan and implement marketing programs are called marketers. Marketers con-
sider various influence factors and make diverse decisions to penetrate a specific market-
place (Taderera 2010). Marketers pay attention to several key elements of marketing, such 
as the market itself, the environment, the customer, the product, pricing, promotion, and 
distribution.
The market is made up of buyers who are expected to purchase certain products and 
services, and also buy substitutes that offer similar values. Of great importance to the 
marketers is the size of the expected market, measured in millions of dollars per year, its 
growth rate, its geographical characteristics, and its requirements. The market must be 
large, stable enough with a reasonable growth rate, and relatively easy to reach and serve 
in order for it to be a worthwhile target for the marketers.
The environment refers to competitors, barriers to entry, rules and regulations, resources, 
and other such factors affecting the marketers’ success in a given market segment. 
Marketers must also understand the opportunities and threats present in the environment.
The customers consist of all potential buyers of a given product or service. Companies 
need to understand why they buy, how they buy, who makes the decision to buy, who 
will use the product, in what specific way the use of the product will contribute value to 
the user, what might be the buyer’s preference related to service and warranty, what other 
product features the customer may want, and other factors. The more a company knows 
about its customers, the better the company can serve the customers in order to build and 
maintain competitive advantages in the marketplace. (Appendix 8.B contains additional 
sample customer survey questions.)
To become customer-oriented, companies need to (1) define the generic needs of custom-
ers through research (such as the buyer’s perception of an automobile’s status, safety, or 
cost), (2) identify the target customers by segmentation (including which selected groups 
of customers have shared needs), (3) differentiate products and communications (e.g., 
offering special reasons for customers to buy due to unique product attributes or special 
communications), and (4) bring about differentiated values for customers.
The product or service symbolizes the actual “bundle of benefits” that is offered to cus-
tomers by the marketers. Factors considered include functional attributes, appropriateness 
to customer needs, differentiable features over competition, product line strategy (e.g., 
synergy between products/services offered; e.g., Apple Watch products are intentionally 
tied into iPhones to form a unique ecosystem), and product-to-market fit (e.g., Apple prod-
ucts are generally favored by music-loving young adults).
Promotion and communication consider the advertising strategies of product and brand 
promotion, options to use a push–pull strategy, selection of advertising media, and the 
choice of promotional intensity. These ensure that the selected means of communication 
are compatible with the target market segments.
The pricing strategy concerns itself with the choice of either a skimming or a penetrat-
ing strategy to set the price, the use of value-added pricing, and the fit of a chosen pricing 
strategy to the target segment.

270
Engineering Management
The placement (distribution) strategy defines options such as the product delivery options 
of either an intensive, exclusive, or selective distribution system; the company’s relation-
ship with dealers; and the changes in distribution systems.
The physical evidence refers to the physical setting (e.g., a store’s appearance, layout and 
color; the dress of service staff; service equipment; and service brochures) that affect cus-
tomer experience.
The process design specifies the applicable operations policies and procedures to effec-
tively serve the customers as related to order processing, logistics, inventory planning, 
franchising policies, sales training, and flow of activities in delivering services.
The people refers to customer-facing service staff, whose training, attitude, and behavior 
directly affect the customer experience.
The first four marketing elements are emphasized when marketing products. For mar-
keting services, the last three elements are added. These elements characterize the multi-
dimensional nature of marketing and are centered on customers, who are the focus of any 
successful marketing program.
8.2.4  Marketing Mix
There are a total of seven key elements of marketing that form the marketing mix (Francese 
1996) (see Figure 8.6). Specifically, the marketing mix consists of price, promotion, product, 
placement (distribution), physical evidence, process designs, and people—the seven P’s of 
marketing.
To help the reader understand the market and the customer, market forecast and market 
segmentation are introduced in Sections 8.3 and 8.4. The first four marketing mix elements 
are addressed in detail in Sections 8.5 through 8.8. Sections 8.9 through 8.11 discuss the 
remaining three marketing elements of physical evidence, process design, and people.
Example 8.1
A company has divided the market for its existing products into three segments: mass-
market applications; applications requiring a quality product, even though consumers 
continue buying on price; and critical applications, in which both quality and reliability

are important. Advise the company on the marketing mix that should be applied to 
these three segments.
Answer 8.1
For the company to be successful, a different set of marketing strategies needs to be 
applied to each of these segments, as suggested in Table 8.1.
Multiple distributions are recommended, including mass-merchandise department 
stores for wide distribution. Direct distribution should include catalogs, specialty 
stores, and upscale department stores.
8.3  Market Forecast: Four-Step Process
The purpose of conducting a market forecast is to define the characteristics of the target 
market regarding its potential size, stability, growth rate, and serviceability. The market 
size and growth rate must be large enough to warrant further consideration by marketers 
(Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2013; Chase 2013).
Any future market is always uncertain due to potential changes in end user behav-
ior, global economics, new technologies, competition, and economic and political 
conditions.
Barnett (1988) emphasizes that the key to successfully forecasting market size is to under-
stand the underlying forces behind the demand. Barnett proposes the following four-step 
process: (1) define the market, (2) segment the market, (3) determine the segment drivers 
and model its changes, and (4) conduct a sensitivity analysis. These steps are explained 
next.
On the basis of customer interviews, the market should be defined broadly to include the 
principal product to be marketed, its “bundle of benefits” to customers, and the competi-
tive products that customers could buy as substitutes instead.
In segmentation, the potential customers for the principal product/service are divided 
into homogeneous subgroups (segments) whose members have similar product prefer-
ences and buying behavior.
Segment drivers are the key factors that drive the growth of a specific segment. Segment 
drivers may be composed of macroeconomic factors (e.g., the increase in white-collar 
workers and in population), as well as industry-specific factors (e.g., the industrial growth 
rate and business climate). Possible sources of information related to segment drivers are

industrial associations, governments, industrial experts, marketing data and service pro-
viders, and specialized market studies.
Sensitivity analyses are conducted to test assumptions. Monte Carlo simulations may be 
performed to generate the maximum—most likely—and minimum total market demand 
sizes, as well as an assessment of the risks involved (see Section 6.4).
The following are two illustrative examples in which the total market demand for a 
product is estimated by (1) defining the industrial segments that purchased the product 
in the past, (2) determining the future growth rates of these industrial segments, and 
(3) calculating the total market demand for the product with these industrial segment 
growth rates as the segment drivers. The assumption here is that the product demand of a 
given industrial segment is in direct proportion to its segment growth rate.
For example, to predict the demand of electricity in future years, a utility company has 
subdivided its consumers into three segments: industrial, commercial, and residential. The 
need for electricity by the industrial segment depends on its future production level and 
business climate. The electricity demand by the commercial segment is related to retail 
sales that in turn are negatively affected by retail stores consolidating, and by growing 
online sales. The residential electricity demand is affected positively by new home sales 
and home sizes, and negatively by the increased energy efficiency of home appliances.
A second example is a paper-producing company that needs to determine the total 
market demand for uncoated white paper. The company divides the market into end-use 
segments such as business forms, commercial printing, reprographics, envelopes, statio-
nery, tablets, and books. The drivers in each segment are then modeled in terms of mac-
roeconomic and industrial factors, using regression analysis and statistics. Examples of 
applicable drivers include growth in the use of electronic technology, white-collar work-
ers, the present level of economic activity, the growing use of personal printers, popula-
tion growth, demand growth induced by price reduction, and the practice of paying bills 
online.
Market forecast is a difficult, but critical first step to take when developing a marketing 
program. Companies routinely engage both internal and external resources to assess the 
principal characteristics of the target markets for their products.
8.4  Market Segmentation
Once it is determined that the target market is worth pursuing (i.e., the market is large and 
stable enough with a high growth rate), then it is useful to understand the target custom-
ers so that they can be served well. Market segmentation is a process whereby companies 
recognize the differences between various customer groups and identify the representa-
tive group behaviors. Generally speaking, members in each of these customer groups do 
respond to product or service offerings in similar ways and have comparable preferences 
with respect to the price–quality ratio, reliability, and service requirements (Bodea 2014).
By dividing consumers into groups that have similar preferences and behaviors with 
respect to the products being marketed, companies achieve four specific objectives: 
(1) matching products and services to appropriate customer groups, (2) creating suitable 
channels of advertisement and distribution to reach these customer groups, (3) uncover-
ing new customer groups that may not have been served sufficiently, and (4) focusing on 
niches that have been neglected by competitors.

273
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
In addition, segmentation allows companies to realize the following benefits: developing 
applicable marketing strategies and objectives, formulating and implementing marketing 
programs that address the needs of the different customer groups, tracking changes in 
buying behavior over time, understanding the enterprise’s competitive position in the 
marketplace, recognizing opportunities and threats, and utilizing marketing resources 
effectively. Figure 8.7 shows a segmentation flow diagram that illustrates the key steps in 
segmenting a market.
Companies classify consumers into segments by understanding their individual, insti-
tutional, and product-related characteristics. Individual characteristics include culture, 
demographics, location, socioeconomic factors, lifestyles, family life cycle, and personali-
ties. Institutional characteristics include the type of business, its size, and the extent of its 
global reach. Product-related characteristics include type of use (e.g., original equipment 
manufacturer [OEM] versus end user), usage level, product knowledge, brand preference, 
and brand loyalty. The benefits sought by consumers—such as psychological and emo-
tional benefits, functional performance, and price—should also be analyzed.
Millions of consumers purchase cars every year. To some, cars are a status symbol; to 
others, cars are simply a means of transportation. A large number of car buyers emphasize 
safety and reliability, while others focus on styling or fuel economy. Socioeconomic fac-
tors, demographics, personalities, and family life are all known to influence the behavior 
of car buyers. These consumers are extensively segmented by all major carmakers.
To be effective, the segmentation of a market needs to satisfy several requirements. 
The segmentation should be measurable. It should result in readily identifiable customer 
groups. The identified customer groups should also be homogeneous. Each group’s 
members should possess more or less unified value perceptions and display compatible 
behavioral patterns. These customer groups are reachable by means of promotion and 
distribution. Above all, the segments should be large enough in size to justify marketing 
efforts, and they should have a high growth rate to allow the company to achieve long-
term profitability.
There are pitfalls to market segmentation. Certain “old economy” companies adopt the 
asset-rich business strategy of pursuing the scale of economy advantages. For these com-
panies, a potential pitfall is over-segmentation, because the selected segments may be too

small or fragmented to serve effectually. Such an over-segmentation is not a pitfall for 
other “knowledge economy” companies that form partnerships to establish supply chains 
for “build-to-order” products. To foster differentiation, knowledge economy companies 
pursue product customization as the basis for their business strategies (Struhl 2013). 
Examples of these products and services are minibrewers, computers, and custom cosmet-
ics. For other companies, overconcentration (lack of balance between segments) could have 
a negative impact on their overall marketing effectiveness (Hartley and Claycomb 2013).
Market segmentation is a prerequisite to developing a workable marketing program. 
Knowledge derived from customer groups serves as valuable inputs to product design, 
pricing, advertising, and customer services, all of which need to be carefully defined by 
the company.
8.5  Product/Service Strategy
The product/service strategy takes center stage in any marketing program (Haines 2014). 
If marketed properly, products/services that offer unique and valuable functional features 
to consumers are expected to enjoy a strong marketplace acceptance.
Products/services may be generally classified as either industrial or consumer oriented. 
Their characteristics are different, as shown in Table 8.2. Marketing programs for con-
sumer products are quite different from those for industrial products, even though the 
same basic marketing approach applies to both (Ulrich and Eppinger 2011).
A good marketing program must take into account the consumer’s perception regarding 
products/services. Indeed, consumers perceive products/services in different ways than 
the producers and marketers do. When buying products/services, consumers look for

“bundles of benefits” that satisfy their immediate wants. Products/services that producers 
regard to be different because of physical embodiment (e.g., input materials), production 
process, or functional characteristics may in fact be equivalent from the customers’ per-
spectives, if offering the same or similar benefits. Table 8.3 contains illustrative examples 
of these different perceptions. Companies must define competition based on the way cus-
tomers perceive their products. Note that products that appear to be physically different to 
marketers may appear to be the same to users.
A product/service strategy must also be established with respect to competition. A com-
pany may decide to market premium products, characterized by having features that are 
outstanding or superior to those offered by the competition. Such outstanding product/
service features may be possible because of the company’s innovative capabilities, techno-
logical superiority, and other core competencies. Companies with such “high-road” brands 
(see Section 8.5.5) tend to enjoy and sustain high profitability. Other companies may elect 
to make commodity-type (value) products with commonly available features so that they 
compete head-on against their competitors on the basis of price, service, distribution, and 
customer relations management. They pursue the option of “low-road” products. Product 
positioning is the step that addresses such competitive issues.
8.5.1  Product/Service Positioning
An important question that companies should ask is, which product/service attributes 
should be included? A perceptual map is a useful tool to position the company’s products/
services in relation to existing competitive offerings in the marketplace. It enables com-
panies to select the correct set of product/service attributes to maximize its marketing 
advantages. It also articulates customer preferences and identifies gaps; these are use-
ful steps in positioning new entries or repositioning existing products (Czerniawski and 
Maloney 2010).
Figure 8.8 is an example of a perceptual map for automobiles regarding the product attri-
butes of price and styling. Only the relative magnitudes of the attributes are emphasized 
in such a map. However, the map helps to identify which car models are in direct competi-
tion with one another and which ones are not. It is also possible to link customer segments 
to these pairs of product attributes, thus enabling companies to refine their advertising 
strategies for these customer segments.
Products/services with more than two important attributes are readily mapped into an 
n-dimensional perceptual map. A product (e.g., P1) is designated by a single point hav-
ing the coordinates F1, F2, F3, through Fn, with each representing an independent product 
attribute. This representation is complete if the elements of the attributes set (F1, F2,…, Fn) 
are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. For example, for automobiles, these

attributes may include price, styling, fuel economy, driving comfort, safety, brand prestige, 
power, and longer-term dependability (e.g., number of problems per 100 three-year-old 
vehicles). The spacing between two neighboring points (each identifying a product) as 
depicted in this n-dimensional map is equal to the square root of the sum of the individual 
attribute differences, squared. Figure 8.9 presents an example of the description of prod-
ucts with six distinguishable attributes.
8.5.2  Product/Service Life Cycles
Every product/service goes through a number of important stages throughout its useful 
life (Stark 2011; Acevedo 2014). These stages include:
	
1.	The initiation stage—product testing, market development, and advertising
	
2.	The growth stage—product promotion, market acceptance, and profit growth
	
3.	The stagnation stage—price competition, substitution, and new technologies
	
4.	The decline stage—cash-cow strategy with no more investment.

Companies need to understand which phase a given product is in (see Figure 8.10).
From the standpoint of the product life cycle, an important product strategy is to 
sequence the introduction of new products so that a high average level of profitability can 
be maintained for the company over time.
Engineering managers are particularly qualified to constantly come up with innovative 
products so that their employers may introduce these products at the right intervals.
8.5.3  Product Portfolio
Another product strategy issue is related to the types of products concurrently being mar-
keted. With the exception of a few, most companies market a group of products at the same 
time, referred to as a product portfolio (Thakor 2012).
Products in a portfolio are usually not “created equal.” From the company’s standpoints 
of profitability and market share position, some are more valuable than others. Boston 
Consulting Group (BCG) of Boston, Massachusetts, developed a portfolio matrix based on 
two measures, namely, growth rate and market share (see Figure 8.11). According to this 
classification scheme, products are regarded as stars if they enjoy high growth rate and

high market share and question marks if they have high growth rate, but low market share. 
Cash cows are those products with low growth rate and high market share. Products are 
designated as dogs if both growth rate and market share are low.
Figure 8.11 indicates that companies need to differentiate the products/services they 
market by strategically emphasizing some and de-emphasizing others, according to the 
responses from the marketplace. For example, a useful strategy to manage a product port-
folio is to milk the cash cows for capital to build question marks into stars that will eventually 
become cash cows. Divest the dogs.
8.5.4  Company Brands
Numerous HT companies operate in a “product-centric” business model, in that they mar-
ket products on price and performance. Recent market studies show that the success of 
technology-based products/services in the marketplace is not purely dependent on the 
price–performance ratio, but also on the trust, reliability, and promised values the custom-
ers perceive in a given brand.
According to Yohn (2014), brand is “a distinct identity that differentiates a relevant, 
enduring and credible promise of value associated with a product, service, or organization 
that indicates the source of that promise.” The brand of a company is more than a name. It 
stands for all the images and experience (e.g., products, service, interactions, and relations) 
that customers associate with the organization. It is a link forged between the company 
and the customers. It is a bridge for the company to strengthen relationships with custom-
ers, according to Wheeler (2012).
A promise of value is an expectation of the customer that the company is committed to 
deliver. Examples of such promises of value from several companies are listed in Table 8.4. 
They must be relevant to the enduring needs of the targeted customers and made credible 
by the persistent commitments of the company. To be competitive, the promise of value 
must be distinguishable from those offered by other brands.
Research indicates that customers consider questions at five levels when purchasing 
both HT and consumer types of products. These questions may be grouped into a brand 
pyramid, as illustrated in Figure 8.12.
Technology-oriented buyers are typically focused on questions at Levels 1 and 2. 
However, higher-level business managers who make purchase decisions are also known 
to address questions at Levels 3–5. These decision-makers are interested in what the prod-
uct or service will do for them, not just how it works. Consequently, to project a trustwor-
thy and reliable image, to build strong relationships with customers, and to enhance brand 
loyalty and customer retention, companies are well advised to pay attention to questions 
at all five levels. This is the emphasis of brand management.
Brand is evaluated on how well it is doing with respect to a number of metrics: deliver-
ing according to the customer’s desire, relevance to the customers, value to the customers,

positioning, product portfolio management, and integration of marketing efforts, manage-
ment, support, and monitoring. Brand is a major asset that must be properly managed and 
constantly strengthened. Useful inputs for brand management are typically secured from 
customer feedback. Once the market is properly segmented, the promise of values is specifi-
cally designed to address the needs of the target segments involved. Actions are then taken to 
deliver the stated promise of values, and results are constantly measured to monitor progress.
In the past, brand management has been focused primarily on points of difference, such as 
how a given brand differs from the other competing brands within the same category. Maytag 
is known to emphasize “dependability.” Tide focuses on “whitening power.” Recently, Keller 
et al. (2002) suggested that attention should be paid to points of parity and the applicable 
frame of reference, in addition to the points of difference, when marketing a given brand. 
Emphasizing the frame of reference is intended to help customers recognize the brand cat-
egory comprising all of the competing brands. Focusing on the points of parity will ensure 
that customers recognize a given brand as a member of the identified brand category.
Brand may be classified with respect to the two dimensions, namely, category and rela-
tive market share. The brand category is defined as premium if the category is dominated by 
premium brands—those with high values to customers. Examples of premium car brands 
include BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and other luxury and specialty cars that each have 
unique high-value attributes. The brand category is defined as value if it is dominated by 
value brands—those with basic, minimum, low-end attributes. Examples of value car brands 
include Chevy, Saturn, and other compact and four-door family cars. Gillette markets its 
Mach-3 Turbo shaving system as a premium brand, whereas the cheap disposable razors 
from its own company as well as its competitors, are marketed as the value brands. The 
relative market share refers to the percentage of market share a given brand is able to attain.
In Figure 8.13, brands are grouped into four classes: high-road, low-road, hitchhiker, 
and dead-end brands (Vishwanath and Mark 1997). Return on sales (ROS) is defined as net 
income divided by the sales revenue (see Section 7.4.1).
High-road brands are those with products that offer premium features, options, quali-
ties, and functions to command high selling prices while attaining a leadership position 
in the market share. Examples of such high-road brands are Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay, and 
Nabisco. These brands enjoy excellent profitability that may be sustained for long peri-
ods. The key success factors for high-road brands are technological innovation (constantly

adding new product/service features and values), time to market, flexible manufacturing, 
and advertising.
Low-road brands are those that offer value brands while enjoying a high market share 
position. Because of marketplace competition and a lack of distinguishable product fea-
tures, these brands can be successfully managed by emphasizing cost reduction, produc-
tion efficiency, product simplification, and distribution effectiveness.
Hitchhiker brands are those with premium product values and low market share. For 
these brands to become high-road brands, management must emphasize cost reduction, 
flexible manufacturing, and product innovation.
Dead-end brands are value brands with low market share. These brands attain only mar-
ginal profitability. There are several strategies to grow the profitability of these dead-end 
brands: (1) reduce the price to penetrate the market and thus move these brands to the 
low-road category; (2) increase the scale of economies by applying the “string-of-pearls” 
strategy: producing and marketing several products together to cut costs; (3) introduce 
a superior, premium product to “trump” this brand into the hitchhiker category. Failing 
all of these attempts, dead-end brands should be discontinued. Table 8.5 summarizes the 
strategies that deal with these four classes of brands.
The preceding discussion on product brands should assist engineering managers 
in understanding the significant value added by brands to the success of the com-
pany’s marketing program (Keller 2012). Such an understanding would make it easier 
for them to channel their support efforts to actively enhance the company’s brand 
strategy.
8.5.5  Engineering Contributions to Product and Brand Strategy
The product/service is a key element in the marketing mix. STEM professionals have 
major opportunities to add value by (1) understanding the customers’ perceptions of 
products; (2) designing products/services with features that are wanted by customers; 
(3) helping to position the company’s products/services strategically to derive marketing 
advantage; (4) practicing innovations in the design, development, production, reliability, 
serviceability, and maintenance of product/services to differentiate them from others;

(5) sustaining the company’s long-term profitability by creating a constant flow of new 
products/services for introduction on a timely basis; (6) assisting in managing compa-
nies’ product/service portfolios by adding premium features to some and reducing costs 
to others; and (7) ensuring commercial success of the high-road and hitchhiker brands in 
the marketplace.
In the “knowledge economy” of the twenty-first century, time to market is an 
increasingly important competitive factor. Once the desirable set of product/ser-
vice attributes is known from market research, those companies that bring the suit-
able products to the market first will enjoy preemptive selling advantages and will 
recover their product development costs faster than others. Engineering managers 
should also be well prepared to contribute in shortening the products’ time to market 
by utilizing advanced technologies to create modular design, eliminate prototyping, 
whittle away design changes, foster parts interchangeability, ensure quality control, 
and other innovations.

8.6  Pricing Strategy
Price is a very important product/service attribute (Jensen 2013; Nagle et al. 2010). 
Companies pay a great deal of attention to the setting of product prices. Setting the price 
too high will discourage consumers from buying, whereas setting it too low will not 
ensure profitability for the company. Generally speaking, the two major strategies for set-
ting the product prices are the skimming strategy and the penetrating strategy.
8.6.1  Skimming and Penetration Strategies
Companies applying the skimming strategy set the product price at the premium levels 
initially and then cut the product price in time to reach additional customers. In other 
words, they “skim the cream” first. An example is the marketing of a new book with hard-
cover copies selling at a high price (e.g., $29.95) followed by the paperback version at a low 
price ($4.95). New technology products are also typically sold at high prices initially in the 
absence of competition. As competitors enter the market with products of similar features, 
product prices are lowered accordingly.
In contrast, companies pursuing the penetration strategy set product prices low to pen-
etrate a new market and rapidly acquire a large market share. A high market share posi-
tion sets forth a barrier of entry for other potential competitors. In general, companies 
use a penetration pricing strategy to enter an existing, but highly competitive market. An 
example is the marketing of Japanese motorcycles in the United States.
8.6.2  Factors Affecting Price
In setting product prices, besides using the skimming and penetration strategies, compa-
nies broadly consider a number of other factors: financial aspects, product characteristics, 
marketplace characteristics, distribution and production capabilities, price–quality rela-
tionship, and the relative position of power (Hamilton 2014). These factors will be dis-
cussed next.
Financial aspects: The more solid the company’s financial position, the more capable it is 
at initially setting the product price low. Companies strong in finance stay afloat for a long 
period of time even with low profitability. Companies that desire high, short-term profit-
ability tend to set the product prices high.
Product characteristics: The product/service price may be set in direct proportion to the 
value and importance of the product to users, as well as the income levels of its target 
customers. Usually, a new product in its early life cycle sells at a high price, allowing the 
company to benefit from the product’s novelty.
Marketplace characteristics: Companies set product prices in reverse proportion to the 
level of competition in the marketplace. The level of competition refers to the number of 
direct competitors, the number of indirect competitors marketing substitution products 
that offer similar value to customers, and the competitive counterstrategies (speed and 
intensity) that these competitors may exercise. Companies tend to set the product price 
high if the barriers to market entry are high. The barriers to market entry depend on lead 
time and resources—technical and financial, patents, cost structure, supply chain strate-
gies and production experience. In addition, products with inelastic price-demand char-
acteristics tend to carry a high price. A product has inelastic price-demand characteristics 

283
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
if a large price increase induces a small change in the quantity of the product demanded 
in the marketplace.
Distribution and production capabilities: Product availability to consumers depends on the 
company’s product distribution capabilities. With strong distribution channels in place, 
companies may set the product price high, as quickly making products available to con-
sumers represents a competitive strength.
Sales volume impacts the company’s production experience. Companies with exten-
sive production experience are known to generate products at a low unit cost. A lower 
product unit cost enables these companies to set a lower product price to gain market 
share.
The Boston Consultant Group studied manufacturing operations and discovered that 
there is a correlation between production volume and product unit cost. For every dou-
bling of the production volume, the unit cost is whittled down by about 15%—or the 85% 
experience curve (Stern and Deimler 2006). (See Figure 8.14. Note that the horizontal axis 
in the figure is nonlinear.)
Companies with a faster time-to-market strategy are able to accumulate production 
experience more quickly, attain a lower product unit cost sooner, and sustain company 
profitability for longer periods of time.
Price–quality relationship: One important consideration in setting the product price is the 
cost–quality relationship perceived by customers. There is substantial evidence in busi-
ness literature to indicate that customers tend to believe that “low-priced items cannot 
be good.” Price is perceived to be an indicator of quality. Thus, product prices should 
not be set too low. There is a price threshold below which customers may raise questions 
regarding the quality, as indicated in Figure 8.15. The demand curve “Quantity T” illus-
trates a normal price–demand relationship in the absence of a price threshold, whereas the 
demand curve “Quantity A” contains a price threshold at about $30 per unit, below which 
the demand for the products starts to drop off as the perception of poor quality related to 
low price kicks in.
Relative position of power: Consumer products are typically marketed by a few major 
companies to a very large number of customers. For innumerable industrial products 
with high technological contents, the number of both producers and customers may 
be limited. The greater the number of sellers there are available for a given product, 
the weaker each seller’s position in the marketplace will be. Similarly, the more buy-
ers there are for a specific product, the weaker the buyers’ relative market position 
will be.

Less competition makes either sellers or buyers more powerful. The relative position 
power between buyers (customers) and sellers (producers) has an impact on product pric-
ing, as illustrated in Figure 8.16. The final price offered by the sellers and accepted by the 
buyers is usually arrived at by a suitable negotiation or auction process.
If both buyers and sellers are strong—for example, when the U.S. government (customer) 
procures fighter airplanes from the defense industry (producer)—a final price is typically 
reached by a negotiation made up of a series of offers and counteroffers. A typical pricing 
arrangement may be cost plus a fixed percentage of gross margins.
When the sellers are strong (e.g., selling an original master painting, a porcelain vase 
from the Ming dynasty, or some other type of unique physical asset) and the buyers are 
weak, sellers tend to take advantage of their dominant supplier position by employing an 
auction. An auction is a bidding process by which buyers are forced to compete against 
each other by committing themselves to consecutively higher prices, with the final price 
being set by the highest winning bid.
If buyers are in a strong position (e.g., due to large transaction volumes), they force weak 
sellers to compete against each other in a reverse auction. A reverse auction requires the

prequalified sellers to submit increasingly lower bid prices within a fixed period of time 
(Preston 2014). The lowest bid defines the final price and the ultimate winner of the sales 
contract. Some large companies employ such pricing tactics to purchase high-volume sup-
ply items such as computers; paper and pencils; tires; batteries; and maintenance, repair, 
and operations (MRO) goods.
Finally, when both sellers and buyers are weak, products are usually not differentiable, 
and the product prices are highly depressed and fixed. Examples include various com-
modity products sold in retail stores. Some sellers (e.g., Land’s End) may activate a Dutch 
auction to compete. In a Dutch auction, sellers slash the product prices by a certain percent-
age at a regular time interval (e.g., every week) until the products are sold or taken off the 
market. In this case, buyers compete against other “sight-unseen” buyers to seize the low-
est possible selling prices (Stafford 2014).
The Internet has made many of these pricing processes much more practical and 
efficient to implement (Roberts and Zahay 2012). Because of its ability to allow sellers 
and buyers to rapidly reach other buyers and sellers, respectively, the Internet tends to 
weaken the relative power positions of both the sellers and the buyers, causing products 
to become increasingly commoditized, thus depressing product prices and intensifying 
competition.

uct price.

8.6.3  Pricing Methods
In setting product/service prices, companies broadly consider a number of the aforemen-
tioned factors. Several of these pricing methods are briefly discussed next (Vohra and 
Krishnamurthi 2012).
Cost oriented: Some companies set prices by adding a well-defined markup percentage 
to the product cost. This is to ensure that all products sold generate an equal amount of 
contribution margin to the company’s profitability:

(8.1)
Cost-plus contracts are often used for industrial products related to research and 
development (R&D), military procurements, unique machine tools, and other uses. Small 
sellers use cost-plus pricing to ensure a fair return while minimizing cost factor risks. 
Larger buyers favor this type of pricing so that they can push for vendor cost reduction 
via experience. Larger buyers may optionally offer to help absorb the cost risks related 
to inflation.
Often, sellers and buyers enter a target-incentive contract, which prescribes that, if actual 
costs are lower than the target costs, sellers and buyers split the savings at a specific ratio. 
On the other hand, if the target costs are exceeded, then both parties pay a fixed percent-
age of the excess; the buyers pay no more than a predetermined ceiling price.
Profit oriented: Other companies prefer to require that all products contribute a fixed 
amount of profit. This pricing method ensures that sellers realize a predetermined return 
on investment (ROI) goal.

(8.2)
Market oriented: Some companies set prices of certain industrial products, such as 
those requiring customization, to what the buyers are willing to pay. For example, 
companies strive to negotiate for the highest price possible and take advantage of the 
fact that product and pricing information may not be easily accessible. The continued 
advancement of Internet-based communication tools tends to make information just 
one click away, rendering this type of pricing method no longer practical in today’s 
marketplace.
Companies may also price the products slightly below the next-best alternative products 
available to the customer. The companies that have exhaustively studied the next-best alter-
native products available to their customers would gain advantages in price negotiations.
Competitive bidding is often used by governments and large buyers. Usually three bids 
are needed for procurements exceeding a specific dollar value. Sealed bids are opened at 
a predetermined date, and the lowest bidder is typically the winner. Some industrial com-
panies may engage in negotiated bidding, wherein they continue negotiating with the lowest 
one or two bidders for additional price concessions after the bidding process (e.g., a reverse 
auction) has been completed.
Valued-added pricing: Companies with extensive application know-how related to their 
industrial products may set product prices in proportion to the products’ expected value 
to the customer. The product’s value to the customer depends on the realizable improve-
ment in quality, productivity enhancement, cost reduction, profitability increase, and other 

287
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
benefits attributable to the use of the product. Producers set the product prices high if there 
is a large value added by these products to the customer (Macdivitt and Wilkinson 2011).
Competition oriented: A common pricing method is to set prices at the same level as those 
of the competition. Doing so induces a head-on competition in the marketplace. In oli-
gopolistic markets (typically dominated by one or two major producers or sellers and par-
ticipated in by several other smaller followers), the market leader sets the price.
One well-known example of a competition-oriented pricing practice is target pricing. 
Target pricing was initiated and applied by many Japanese companies. Some American 
companies have now started to successfully apply this method (Nizam 2014). Target pric-
ing is briefly addressed as one of several external benchmarking strategies in Section 5.3. 
The process of target pricing (see Figure 8.17) is as follows:
	 (a)	 Determine the market prices of products that are similar or equivalent to the 
new product planned by the company. Find all product attributes customers may 
desire. This is usually accomplished by a multifunctional team composed of rep-
resentatives of such disciplines as design, engineering, production, service, reli-
ability, and marketing. Select a product price (e.g., 80% of the market price) that 
makes the company’s new product competitive in the marketplace. This is then 
the target product price.
	 (b)	 Define a gross margin that the company must have in order to remain in business.
	 (c)	 Calculate the maximum cost of goods sold (CGS) by subtracting the gross margin 
from the target product price. This is the target product cost, which must not be 
exceeded.
	 (d)	 Conduct a detailed cost analysis to determine the costs of all materials, parts, sub-
assemblies, engineering, and other activities required to make the new product. 
Usually, the sum of these individual costs will exceed the target product cost pre-
viously defined. Apply innovations in product design, manufacturing, procure-
ment, outsourcing, and other cost reduction techniques to bring the CGS down to 
or below the target product cost level.

	 (e)	 Initiate the development process for the new product only if the target product 
cost goal can be met.
The target pricing method ensures that the company’s new product can be readily 
sold in the marketplace at the predetermined competitive price, with features desired 
by consumers, to generate a well-defined profitability for the company. This method sys-
tematically evaluates low-risk, high-return investment opportunities because it forces 
the company to invest only when the commercial success of the product is more or less 
assured. Furthermore, it also focuses the company’s product innovations on finding ways 
to meet specific and well-defined target product cost goals. It avoids the potential of wast-
ing its precious intellectual talents in chasing ideas with no or little practical value.
Numerous companies use the aforementioned pricing methods. Product/service prices 
are usually set by the marketing department in consultation with business managers. 
Engineering managers are advised to become aware of these methods, but to defer pricing 
decisions and related discussions to the marketing department.
8.6.4  Pricing and Psychology of Consumption
Recent studies indicate that buyers are more likely to consume a product when they are 
aware of its cost. The more they consume, the more they will buy again and thus become 
repeat customers. One useful way to induce them to repeatedly consume the products is 
to remind them of the costs committed through the choice of payment methods. This is 
based on the assumption that the more often the customers are reminded of the payments, 
the more they feel guilty if they do not fully utilize the products they have paid for.
Gourville and Soman (2002) point out that a time payment plan better induces regular 
consumption of a product than a lump-sum prepayment (e.g., prepaid season tickets) at 
the same total value. This is because the time payments remind the buyers of the costs 
periodically and thus invoke the sunk-cost effect on a regular basis. The psychology of the 
sunk-cost effect is that consumers feel compelled to use products they have paid for to 
avoid the embarrassing feeling that they have wasted their money.
Credit card payments are less effective in inducing consumption than cash payments 
because cash payments require the buyers to take out currency notes and count them one 
by one; thus, they experience the “pain” of making payments.
In price-bundling situations, the more clearly the individual prices of products are item-
ized, the better the perceived sunk-cost effect will be. Breaking down large payments into 
a number of smaller ones, thus clearly highlighting the costs of individual products sold 
in the bundle, can enhance this effect.
Studies of membership rates at commercial wellness and fitness centers support this 
logic. It has been well documented that those members who pay the membership fees once 
a year use the facilities only occasionally. These members are the least likely to renew, in 
comparison with those who pay on a monthly basis. Similar observations are made in 
sports events in which holders of season tickets show up less frequently than those who 
buy tickets for specific sets of events.
These examples point out that companies can induce customers to become repeat cus-
tomers by focusing on ways to encourage consumption. Only consumption lets customers 
experience the benefits of the product/service they have purchased. Without such favor-
able experience, they may not feel that they have good reasons to buy the products again 
in the future. Hence, besides providing a good bundle of value made up of price, prod-
uct features, convenient and efficient order processing and delivery, and quick-response 

289
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
after-sales services, companies should devise ways to stimulate consumption as a strategy 
to cultivate and retain repeat customers.
Example 8.2
The company has been selling a number of products to customers. It is about to launch 
a new product with features far superior to any products currently on the market. One 
option is to price this new product at a large premium above the current price range 
so that the heavy development expenses can be readily recouped by the company. The 
other option is to set the price comparable with the existing range in order to retain 
customer loyalty. What is your pricing advice to the company?
Answer 8.2
Hold a focus group to find out the potential response of customers to the new product’s 
features. Are these features of real value to them? How much more are they willing to 
pay for these new features? Exciting new features from the manufacturer’s viewpoints 
may not be as exciting to customers. Should customers appreciate the new features, then 
it is advisable to apply the skimming strategy and set a high price for the new product. 
This is also the principle of value pricing. Furthermore, doing so will avoid “cannibal-
izing” the existing products of the company.
An efficacious promotional campaign is essential to heighten product awareness. 
Keep monitoring the response of the market. If the market response is poor, cut down 
the product price slowly to induce more demand.
8.7  Marketing Communication (Promotion)
Marketing communication is intended to inform the target customers of the features and 
benefits of the company’s offerings (Clow 2013; Belch and Belch 2011). Product promotion 
follows a well-planned process (see Figure 8.18) for who says what to whom, in what way, 
through which channel, and with what anticipated outcome.
8.7.1  Communication Process
Companies select communicators who are publicly recognized and who have trustworthy 
images, as these speakers tend to induce public acceptance of their messages. Examples 
include Bob Dole for Viagra, and Yao Ming for basketball-related items.

FIGURE 8.18

Messages may be in various forms, including slogans. A slogan is a brief phrase used 
to get the consumer’s attention and acts as a mnemonic aid. Successful slogans typically 
represent a symbolization of product features in terms of the customer’s wants and needs 
(such as information, persuasion, and education). Examples include “Ring around the 
Collar,” “Where’s the Beef?,” “You are what you know,” “One investor at a time,” “Our 
Insights are Your Guide,” “Predictive Analytics: Drive Better Decisions with Data,” “See a 
New Way to Discover Insights – Smarter Decisions are Made with IBM,” and “Vanguard 
Lets You Keep More. That’s Our Low-Cost Advantages.”
Channels of communication are a specific means to foster market advertisement. In 
general, there are two types of communications channels: the marketer controlled and 
the consumer controlled. The marketer-controlled channels include advertisements placed 
by the producers in trade journals, national television programs, distribution brochures, 
advertisements by technical salespeople, industrial exhibitions, and direct-mail marketing. 
The consumer-controlled channels include private communications by word of mouth, news 
reports, and others sources of information perceived to contain no conflicts of interest.
The customers are the target for marketing communications. When selecting communi-
cations channels to reach specific consumers, the consumers’ characteristics, media habits, 
and product knowledge must be taken into account. Consumers’ characteristics include 
socioeconomic status, demographics, lifestyle, and psychology. For industrial customers, 
characteristics include market capitalization, market share, and stability of financial posi-
tion. Media habits point to sources of information preferred by the customers (e.g., types of 
magazines and TV programs). Product knowledge is the consumers’ understanding and 
appreciation of the values offered by the producers.
Some companies invest a considerable amount of effort in educating their consumers. 
A case in point is the known practice of some drug companies that sponsor large-scale 
clinical studies conducted by universities and other independent organizations. The pur-
pose of these funded studies is to produce results for publication in technical journals 
from which consumers gain product knowledge in ways preferred by the sponsoring drug 
companies.
The impact of marketing communications on products/services may be short term or 
long term. The short-term impact is related to recall, recognition, awareness, and purchase 
intention with respect to the offerings in question. The long-term impact is reflected in the 
purchases by customers and brand loyalty with repeat purchases. Several factors influence 
the effectiveness of marketing communication, namely, timing, price, product availability, 
responses by competition, product warranty conditions, and customer support service.
Marketing communication brings about heightened product/service awareness, as an 
improved familiarity with the offerings induces more people to purchase them at the cur-
rent price levels.
8.7.2  Promotion Strategy
Product/service promotion may be pursued by either causing the consumers to want to 
pull the products/services from the supply chains or allowing the producers to push the 
products/services to the consumers through the supply chains. Many companies practice 
both strategies.
In a pull strategy, the consumers go to retail stores to ask about the product/service 
because they have been informed of its values by advertisements and other promotional 
efforts of the sellers. In this case, the product or service is presold to the consumers, who 
practically pull the products through its distribution channels (see Figure 8.19).

291
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
In exercising a push strategy, sellers introduce incentive programs (e.g., factory rebate, 
sales bonus, telemarketing, rebate selling, door-to-door sales, or discount coupons) to push 
products/services onto the consumers. Figure 8.20 illustrates the push strategy. Table 8.7 
compares these two promotional strategies.
Consumer and HT products are promoted differently. To bring the most convincing 
marketing messages to the intended users, marketers for HT and consumer products 
use different channels. For examples, trade shows, users groups, trade journals, and 
the Internet are typically used for HT products, whereas print media, radio, TV, and the 
Internet are used for consumer products. Advertising is less important for HT product and 
more important for consumer products. The consumer segments are more numerous for 
HT products than for consumer products. Companies spend less marketing resources and 
place more extensive focus on promoting HT products than on consumer types. Brand is 
critically important for promoting consumer products than for HT types.

8.7.3  Internet-Enabled Communications Options
Communications among sellers, intermediaries (e.g., distribution partners), and buyers 
have been significantly enhanced by the Internet (Lewis 2009). Figure 8.21 presents four 
specific modes of communication.
Manufacturers and suppliers usually set up the intranet to communicate with interme-
diaries (business to business, or B-to-B). Intermediaries may create their own websites and 
other tools to communicate with customers in a business-to-customers (B-to-C) mode. A 
direct communication between manufacturers, suppliers, and customers can be readily 
fostered by the company’s websites, call centers, and other means for order processing, 
inquiry coordination, problem solving, and additional mission-oriented activities such as 
customer surveys, focus groups, and product testing.
The virtual market is a segment of the Internet domain where third-party portals (e.g., 
Google, Yahoo, and other search engines), auction sites (e.g., eBay), and e-commerce mar-
ketplaces (e.g., ChemConnect) actively provide channels to access information useful to all 
parties involved (manufacturers, suppliers, intermediaries, and customers).
In the B-to-B markets, businesses buy essentially two kinds of goods from other busi-
nesses, namely, manufacturing inputs (raw materials, equipment, and components) and 
operational inputs (MRO goods, office supplies, spare parts, travel services, computer sys-
tems, cleaning, and other services). They buy these goods by systematic sourcing or spot 
sourcing. Electronic hubs provide the useful functions of aggregation and matching.
Companies invest efforts into creating websites that offer product information and facili-
tate sales transactions. However, studies show that these efforts have not yet returned the 
high profitability generally anticipated from such a marketing approach. The basic reason 
is that it remains unpredictable how frequently new and repeat customers visit these web-
sites and then actually place orders.
A new way of thinking is offered by Hackley (2013), who suggests that the focus of 
e-commerce should be shifted from contents to context. He believes that contextual mar-
keting (bringing the marketing message directly to the customer at the point of need) is 
the key. A number of contextual marketing examples are described next.
Johnson and Johnson’s banner ads for Tylenol (an over-the-counter painkiller drug) 
show up on e-brokers’ websites whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by more 
than 100 points on a given business day. They anticipate that investors will have headaches 
and thus will need Tylenol when they see their stocks lose money. The marketing message

Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
is brought out in the correct context as a way to reinforce its relevance and to offer trans-
actional convenience at the right time.
CNET and ZDNET websites attract diverse visitors interested in computers. Instead of 
placing banner ads in these CNET and ZDNET sites to redirect visitors to its own web-
site, Dell offers product information directly within the CNET and ZDNET websites. Dell 
piggybacks on CNET’s and ZDNET’s relationship with its computer-savvy customers in 
order to promote Dell’s own customer-acquisition economics. Doing so holds the custom-
er’s attention on computer design and offers competitive design choices and speedy order 
processing at the optimal moment. Here, the tactic used by Dell is to insert itself into a 
preexisting customer relationship at the right time and place.
Several search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Lycos, AltaVista, and HotBot) 
practice contextual marketing. When a user conducts a keyword search, the output is typi-
cally placed in a left-aligned column under the heading “Matching Sites” and rank ordered 
according to hit frequency. Quite frequently, several items under the heading “Sponsored 
Links” are placed on top of the “Matching Sites” column. These are paid advertisements 
related to the keywords entered by the user. They are there to offer contextual marketing 
messages relevant to the expressed interest of the user.
As web-based technologies continue to advance, the Internet will become more acces-
sible by many more users from almost anywhere and at any time, causing them to become 
overwhelmed by information and choices. Bringing the right marketing information to 
the customer at the point of need is likely to become a critical success factor for various 
companies in marketing communications.
8.8  Distribution (Placement) Strategy
Numerous organizations are involved in moving products and services from the points 
of production to the points of consumption. As indicated in Figure 8.22, some companies 
may engage intermediaries (e.g., wholesalers and retailers) to distribute their products, 
while others may elect to interact directly with their customers (Dent 2011). Distribution 
channels serve very useful functions, which include:
Transportation: Overcoming the spatial gap between the producer and the user
Inventory: Bridging the time gap between production and usage
Allocation: Assigning quantity and lot size

Engineering Management
Assortment: Grouping compatible products for the convenience of users, as qualified 
technical representatives could sell several product lines
Financing: Facilitating timely possession of products
Communication: Providing product information and feedback to and from consumers
In recent years, distribution channels for some products/services have experienced sig-
nificant changes due to upgraded logistics, transportation technologies, and advancements 
in communications technologies. For example, the Internet has enabled many producers to 
deliver digitized products—books, newspapers, magazines, music products, video prod-
ucts, and travel services—directly to consumers, thus bypassing the traditional store-front 
intermediaries. Because of the use of sophisticated websites from which extensive prod-
uct/service catalogs may be accessed, retail stores have also lost some of their traditional 
importance for selling physical goods—clothing, cars, appliances, and so forth.
Furthermore, logistics companies such as the United Parcel Service (UPS) are constantly 
improving their transportation capabilities and satellite-based communications system 
technologies in order to deliver physical goods anywhere in the world while allowing a 
constant tracking of the status of consumer orders.
Warehouse design is expected to increasingly involve gantry robots and complex pro-
cess optimization for constantly improving the efficiency of automated high-volume 
operations.
8.8.1  Types of Distribution
Traditionally, distribution is classified as either intensive, exclusive, or selective. In intensive 
distribution, products are stocked in diverse outlets, such as hardware stores, department 
stores, and catalog rooms, for wide distribution. This type of distribution is particularly 
suitable for consumer products of low technology and differentiation features. Examples 
include films, calculators, electric fans, books, and CDs. With exclusive distribution, certain 
products are distributed only through exclusively designated outlets. This allows produc-
ers to retain more control over price policy, promotion, credit, and service, as well as to 
enhance the image of the products. Examples include dealerships for specific cars and 
qualified product centers for brand-name PCs. The selective distribution is suitable for cer-
tain other products, the sales and service of which require special technical know-how and 
training. Examples include electronic instruments, HT equipment, and custom software.
Services, such as health care, business consulting, financial advisement, and education, 
are usually offered, selectively, at specifically designated retail stores.
8.8.2  Organizational Structures
In order to enhance distribution effectiveness, some companies elect to exercise more 
control over the supply chain by integrating forward. Others have elected to integrate 
backward.
A forwardly integrated organization strives to control the distribution channels leading 
to the customers. For the purpose of securing a larger market share and exercising more 
direct control, a producer may attempt to build its own retail outlets. Doing so allows the 
producer to gain direct access to customers and thus to benefit from their feedback. This 
type of organization is also favored by providers of services.
On the other hand, a backwardly integrated organization seeks to control the value chain 
leading backward to production. For example, some retailers or wholesalers may attempt 
to own specific production facilities or to outsource production for creating private-label 

295
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
products in order to market products with their own brand names, reduce costs, ensure 
supply, and control quality.
8.8.3  Impact of E-Commerce on Distribution
The Internet has significantly modified the traditional classifications of distribution. Many 
consumer products, as well as certain HT products, are now marketed directly through 
a company’s websites, including order processing and after-sales services. As a conse-
quence, many intermediate companies currently involved in distributions—wholesalers, 
discounters, and some retail stores—are gradually being forced out by Internet-enabled 
e-commerce companies and by the increased involvement of efficient and fast-responding 
logistics providers.
One immediate impact of e-commerce is the reduction of the final product price and 
product delivery schedule, both of which are beneficial to end users.
Example 8.3
Customers’ wants and needs are regionally different for products intended for global 
markets. How can a centralized, concurrent engineering team develop a product that 
will serve as the common “platform” for global markets?
Answer 8.3
One option is to segregate the mechanical aspects (functionality) of the products from 
their aesthetic aspects (look and feel). General Motors is accomplishing this challenging 
objective by
	
1.	 Building identical assembly plants for Buick cars at four global locations
	
2.	 Outsourcing major subassemblies to local industries to minimize import 
duties and to satisfy local content laws
	
3.	 Standardizing the technical specifications so that parts supplied by one region 
can be readily rerouted for use by another, in order to balance loads due to 
market demand fluctuation, labor disputes, governmental regulations, and 
other unpredictable events
	
4.	 Modifying design to account for local market conditions relative to cultural 
preference (e.g., car names in local languages, styling preferences, purchase 
habits, and colors)
	
5.	 Retaining centralized concurrent engineering approaches to facilitate global 
business strategy and scale of economy, while being flexible enough to adjust 
to local needs
Example 8.4
The company plans to enter a new global market. It has three products currently selling 
well in its home country. The company’s brand name is strong and internationally well 
recognized.
Current market research indicates that the segments for these three products in the 
targeted global market are of different sizes, growth rates, and profitability for the fore-
seeable future. Other product characteristics are included in Table 8.8.
Which one product should be selected to penetrate the targeted global market? Why? 
If the company has the required resources to market all three products in the targeted 
global market, in what priority order should the company proceed?

296
Engineering Management
Answer 8.4
To enter a global market, the company must examine two key questions: (1) How attrac-
tive is the target market segment to the company, and (2) how acceptable is the product 
offered to the customers in the target segment?
The attractiveness of a market segment to a company is generally defined by three fac-
tors, namely, segment size, segment growth rate, and profitability. By using the informa-
tion presented in Table 8.8, it becomes clear that the ranking based on “attractiveness” 
should be Product B first, with Products A and C sharing the second spot.
How acceptable the company’s product is to the customers depends on the product 
value as perceived by the customers, the brand strength of the product, the deliv-
ery or distribution efficiency that affects the product’s availability to the customers, 
and the ease with which customers could obtain an after-sales service. Based on 
the “acceptability” criterion, the ranking of these products should be Products B, C, 
and A.
Since both the “attractiveness” and “acceptability” criteria are equally important, we 
need to come up with a combination ranking, which says that the company should 
select Product B as its first choice to enter the global market, followed by Product C, and 
then Product A.
8.9  Physical Evidence
Physical evidence refers to the physical setting in which a service is to be offered, 
delivered, or consumed. Customers form a brand image of the service vendor by 
observing the physical layout, decor and color, design details, equipment capabilities, 
the status of facilities that support the service delivery and enhance the communica-
tion of messages (e.g., service availability, customer satisfaction) to other potential 
customers, and by judging the extent to which the physical setting meets or exceeds 
their expectations.

McDonald’s and Citibank design its retail branches to look and operate the same way in 
any location.

8.10  Process Design
By process, we refer to the chosen work procedure, inter-unit collaboration, and the flow 
of activities by which services are delivered, service consumption is facilitated, and cus-
tomers’ problems are solved, as measured by such metrics as speed, convenience, effi-
ciency, and the extent of empowerment enjoyed by the customer-facing staff. Customers 
gain an overall impression regarding the equality of the customer-focused process being 
practiced.
8.11  People
Many people are directly or indirectly involved in the production and consumption of 
services (knowledge workers, employees, management, and other customers), who may 
add to the value of the service offering. Following the Value Profit Chain model (Heskett 
et al. 2002), recruiting the right customer-facing staff; preparing them with proper training 
in interpersonal skills, aptitude, and service knowledge; empowering them to take care of 
customers; and compensating them well are all essential models toward achieving cus-
tomer satisfaction and corporate profitability.
Example 8.5
In this chapter, we talked about the marketing elements, which include: (1) product/
service, (2) price, (3) promotion (advertising), (4) placement (distribution), (5) physical 
evidence, (6) process design, and (7) people.
When marketing products, it is usually sufficient to focus on the first four of these 
marketing elements. On the other hand, all seven marketing elements are deemed 
important when marketing services. What are the underlying reasons for the last three 
(e.g., #5, #6 and #7) marketing elements to be particularly important for marketing 
services?
Answer 8.5
Companies address all seven marketing elements (7Ps) when marketing services. The 
principal reason for this is that services (e.g., health care, business consultation, finan-
cial services, leisure and travel, insurance, and others) require a much higher degree of 
customization in the process of specifying, producing, delivering, and offering after-
sales support than products (e.g., automobiles, computers, and appliances). Because 
of these service-specific characteristics, customers are exposed to the vendor’s perfor-
mance in (a) physical evidence, (b) process, and (c) people to a much greater extent, 
making these elements more important in affecting the customer’s satisfaction than in 
marketing products.
Thus, to be customer focused, service companies pay more attention to (a) physical 
evidence related to facility design, office layout, and employee uniforms; (b) processes 
in problem solving and conflict resolutions affecting customers; and (c) people—by 
choosing, training, and monitoring customer-facing staff to ensure friendliness and 
customer-centered attention.

298
Engineering Management
8.12  Customers
Customers are important to any product/service company. A company’s marketing pro-
gram needs to focus on the targeted customers, understand them, practice the right strate-
gies to win them over, create emotional bond with them, improve interactions and enhance 
their loyalty, and continue to expand the number of satisfied customers by asking the right 
customer survey questions.
8.12.1  Customer Focus
Customer focus is aimed at knowing the real needs of target customers, past, present 
and future. It requires the collaboration of many employees as well a functioning sup-
port organization to make it happen. Based on a study of the Royal Bank of Canada, 
Gulati and Oldroyd (2005) suggest a four-stage coordination process for service com-
panies to become customer focused, namely, (1) communal, (2) serial, (3) symbiotic, 
and (4) integral coordination. For example, the primary organizational objective is to 
(1) collect information, (2) gain insight into customers from past behavior, (3) develop 
an understanding of likely future behavior, and (4) conceive a real-time response to 
customer’s needs.
Getting closer to customers is a journey the entire company must take, not just the mar-
keters and customer-facing staff. A firm cannot be oblivious to the changes in customer 
perspectives of its product/service in the marketplace. It requires corporate leadership and 
company commitment to get useful results.
8.12.2  Customer Acquisition in Business Markets
The benefits derived by acquired customers in business markets belong to four categories.
	
1.	Tangible financial benefits
	
2.	Nontangible financial benefits: Conducting pilot projects, money-back guarantees 
for nonperformance, pay for performance contracts
	
3.	Tangible nonfinancial benefits: Corporate reputations, global scale, innovation 
capabilities
	
4.	Nontangible, nonfinancial benefits: Something the vendor does extra for consum-
ers to enhance convenience, customer relationship, or services offered, above and 
beyond contracts
According to Narayandas (2005), to acquire customers, companies must be on par with 
rivals with respect to tangible financial benefits. They need to use tangible nonfinancial 
benefits to differentiate and shift customer’s focus from tangible benefits to nontangible, 
nonfinancial ones (e.g., free services that reduce customers operating expenses); and sug-
gest ways to make customer’s process more efficient, thus earning the trust of the customers.
Consumer markets and business markets are quite different. Table 8.9 shows the 
difference.
When marketing to business customers, companies need to know that business deci-
sions are typically made by a team of people. Each team member could have one or more 
specific needs. Knowing who these people are and what each of them is looking for is of 

299
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
critical importance to the seller. The vendor must become sensitive to these needs and be 
prepared to address all of them adequately.
8.12.3  Moments of Truth in Customer Service
The “moments of truth” are times when a customer invests a significant amount of emo-
tional energy in the outcome of a service transaction with producers. Examples of such 
moments include (1) a customer has a problem encountering an unexpected difficulty in 
applications, receiving a hold on a check, and so on; (2) a customer has a need to get a quick 
answer; (3) a customer receives financial advice (good or bad); and other suggestions. If 
these moments are handled positively, customers are likely to create an emotional bond 
with the producers and subsequently increase their future commitment to the producer’s 
services. The study of Beaujean et al. (2006) shows that the customer experience, related to 
other humdrum service interactions that involve unelevated emotional energy, is of little 
consequence.
Management must therefore support and develop frontline staff to enable them to 
handle such “moments of truth” by way of empowerment, nurturing the right service 
mind-sets, and acquiring the necessary service knowledge, while de-emphasizing the 
efficiency improvement of other manual transactions. Developing deeper and long-last-
ing relationships with customers is key to sustaining long-term profitability (Beaujean 
et al. 2006).
8.12.4  Customer Interactions and Loyalty
The interactions between customers and companies play a very important role in securing 
marketing success. Creating a pleasant experience for customers (e.g., in order process-
ing, service information dissemination, inquiry coordination, problem solving, after-sales 
support service, and market surveys) is crucial for customer retention. Winning customer

Engineering Management
cooperation in offering much-needed feedback is vital to the company’s service develop-
ment. Management of customer relations is thus an important corporate responsibility.
Some lessons from the past are noteworthy. Customer interactions are not limited to 
marketing. Many other functions of the company are involved, including support ser-
vice, accounts receivable, legal, engineering, manufacturing, and shipping. Empowered 
employees can act on behalf of the company to satisfy customer requirements. Adequate 
support infrastructure must be established to enable employees to perform the tasks in an 
innovative and customer-responsive manner.
The major payoff for a successful customer interaction program is customer loyalty. 
Customer loyalty contributes to company profitability. Studies indicate that increasing 
the customer retention rate by 5% raises profits by 25%–95% (Reichhold and Shefter 
2000). Loyal customers are valuable because they buy more, refer their pleasant expe-
rience to new customers, and offer consultations to these new customers at no cost to 
companies.
To build customer loyalty, the customer interaction strategy must be focused on creat-
ing trust. Amazon.com is viewed by many as one of the most reliable and trustworthy 
websites on the Internet. It registers user preference, becomes smarter over time at offering 
services tailored to each user, provides one-click convenience for purchasing items, and 
delivers the ordered services free of errors. It is reported that 59% of Amazon.com sales 
are derived from repeat customers, roughly twice the rate of typical “brick-and-mortar” 
bookstores.
Vanguard Group, a company that markets index-based as well as specifically managed 
investment funds, offers timely and high-quality financial advice on its website and does 
not attempt to hard sell any specific service. Its customer interaction strategy is focused on 
building trust. “You cannot buy trust with advertising or salesmanship; you have to earn 
it by always acting in the best interest of customers,” says Jack Brennan, Vanguard CEO.
eBay is actively practicing the referral-based business, having about 50% of its new 
customers referred by loyal customers, who are also its helpers. One major concern in the 
business of auctioning used merchandise is reliability and fraud prevention. eBay asks 
each buyer and seller to rate each other after every transaction. The ratings are posted 
on the website. Every member’s reputation becomes public record. Furthermore, eBay 
insures the first $200 for each transaction and holds the money in escrow until the buyer 
is satisfied with the received merchandize.
How is trust related to profitability? Studies show that, in some businesses, customers 
must typically stay on board for at least two to three years just for the companies to recoup 
their initial customer-acquisition investment. In other words, for companies to achieve 
profitability, customers must be loyal enough to stay beyond the break-even period. A 
large percentage of customers defect before many new companies reach this break-even 
point. Reichhold and Shelfter (2000) showed that companies with consumer electronics 
and appliances products spend on average $56 to acquire a new customer, their break-even 
point is four years, and 60% of their customers defect before reaching the break-even point. 
For groceries and apparel companies, their customer-acquisition costs are $84 and $53, 
their break-even years are 1.7 and 1.1, and their percentages of customer defection before 
reaching the break-even point are 40% and 14%, respectively.
A large number of companies are successful in planning and implementing strategies 
to interact effectively with customers. According to Dorf et al. (2002), these companies 
identify and prioritize customers, define their needs, and customize support services to fit 
these needs. They reap the benefits of increased cross-selling, reduced customer attrition, 
enhanced customer satisfaction, minimized transaction costs, and sped-up cycle times. 

301
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
Companies known for their success in relationship marketing include Pitney Bowes, Wells 
Fargo, 3M, Owens Corning, British Airways, Hewlett-Packard, and American Express.
Customer loyalty is won, not by technology, but through the delivery of a consistently 
superior customer experience. It requires a well-designed customer interaction strategy 
that is supported by companies with a firm corporate commitment.
8.12.5  Customer Feedback
A great number of customer satisfaction surveys contain too many questions. According 
to Reichheld and Markey (2011), the ultimate question to ask is: “How likely are you to 
recommend this company to a friend or colleague?” Score the results on a 0–10 scale and 
classify the responses as follows:
	
1.	 Loyal promoters (9s and 10s)
	
2.	Passive customers who do business with the company (7s and 8s)
	
3.	Detractors (6s and below) 
The net promoter score (NPS) is defined as the percentage of promoters minus the percent-
age of detractors. For example, if the promoters are 35%, passive customers are 50%, and 
detractors are 15%, then the NPS is 20%. Based on a survey conducted by Bain & Company, 
companies with an NPS in the range of 50%–80%, are superior in achieving good profits. 
Examples of these high-NPS companies include: USSA (82%), HomeBanc (81%), Harley-
Davison (81%), Costco (79%), and Amazon.com (73%).
Obviously, the key to growing a business is to have more promoters and less detrac-
tors. Since the company already has a relationship with these “promoter” customers, 
it should solicit information from them in order to understand exactly where the com-
pany is succeeding and how to apply this information toward ensuring the company’s 
ongoing success. They should contact detractors as well, to find out what the company 
can do to improve their service offerings. Reichheld and Markey (2011) believe that 
business growth can only be sustained over a long period based on the loyalty of 
satisfied customers and customer-focused promotions. To achieve success, companies 
must always practice the Golden Rule: to treat others as you would want to be treated 
in return.
This concept appears to be consistent with the “Value Profit Chain” model (Section 8.5.6) 
in that satisfied customers will not only increase spending for themselves, but also recom-
mend that their friends follow suit. The way to ensure customer satisfaction is to adopt 
company policies that make for happy and loyal employees, who will in turn promote 
company’s brands leading to long-term corporate profitability.
Example 8.6
Over the years, New Health Company spent a considerable amount of effort in develop-
ing and testing a new drug intended for reducing the LDL (bad cholesterol) and rais-
ing the HDL (good cholesterol) of patients with cardiovascular disease. After having 
passed the Phases 1, 2, and 3 trials, the drug received Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approval for marketing to the public. There are some known drugs already in 
the marketplace for this type of disorder, which affects millions of people in the United 
States alone. The size of the overall market for cardiovascular drugs is estimated to be 
about $25 billion annually. Devise a marketing plan to bring this new drug into the U.S. 
marketplace.

products, namely, product, price, placement (distribution), and promotion.
As a new product, the drug in question offers the useful features of lowering LDL 
and raising HDL, a very powerful combination to combat heart disease, based on the 
current state of clinical knowledge. A direct competitor is Lipitor, which has the same 
beneficial effects as the new drug. Furthermore, Crestor, together with Niacin, are also 
known to produce this combination effect. It is important for the company to delineate 
any differences this new drug might have regarding (1) side effects, (2) potential long-
term health hazards, (3) lower frequency of taking the drug, and (4) longer effectiveness. 
These differences must be clinically verifiable by way of large-scale clinical studies.
Pricing is an important issue to some patients. The new drug should be retail-priced 
at a level slightly lower than its current competitors. Aggressive contracts should be 
entered into with major insurance carriers, mail order drug companies, AARP prescrip-
tion drugs program, and others to allow volume-based discounts.
Promotion is rather critical for a new drug entering an existing market. Key targets 
are patients, physicians, and insurance carriers. Patients need to become aware of the 
unique benefits of this new drug via TV, magazine articles, and web-based advertise-
ment, so that they could “pull” this drug from the supply chains. The message should 
emphasize its distinguishing features in view of the existing competition. Physicians 
must be convinced via trade shows, clinical studies, and journal articles of its relative 
merits, so that they would be willing to suggest/prescribe this new drug and allow 
brochures to be distributed through their offices. Frequent publication of supporting 
articles in highly reputable journals such as New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of 
American Medical Association, Journal of Cardiology, Circulation, and others will attract the 
attention of physicians. Insurance carriers need to be convinced of the benefits of this 
new drug in order for them to be willing to place it in their formularies.
The distribution of this new drug would follow the usual wholesale channels, as it 
is a prescription drug authorized by physicians and available only from pharmacies.
New Health Company should monitor the market constantly and adjust its marketing 
program accordingly.
8.13  Other Factors Affecting Marketing Success
There are several other factors that may affect the marketing success of any company.
8.13.1  Alliances and Partnerships
Nowadays, companies increasingly realize that they do not always possess or cannot cul-
tivate internally all competencies needed to compete in the world markets, under the cur-
rent constraints of resource and time. Examples of these constraints may include (1) the 
market access is unattainable, (2) the technology is unaffordable, and (3) the time to market 
is too long. Forming business partnerships and alliances may have become increasingly 
necessary for many companies to compete effectually and to constantly deliver value to 
their customers. For companies to succeed in the marketplace under these circumstances, 
the marketing concepts must penetrate to all members of the partnerships and alliances 
(Humphries and Gibbs 2009). The following examples illustrate the working of such sup-
ply chain partnerships and alliances:

303
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
	
1.	Calyx and Corolla formed a network of partnerships to provide the seamless 
delivery of fresh flowers from grower to final customer in one-fourth of the time 
required by the traditional channels.
	
2.	Dell teamed up with parts manufacturers and assembled computer systems in 
their own plants. Then Dell linked with logistics partners to deliver custom-
designed personal computers (PCs) within three days to customers anywhere in 
the world. The Dell model was highly successful when implemented, allowing 
Dell to attain a high worldwide market share of PCs.
Partners must appreciate that synergistically, benefits may be realized when all mem-
bers of the alliance embrace the marketing concept and come to recognize the importance 
of creating superior customer value by joining hands.
8.13.2  Organizational Effectiveness
Marketing success is also influenced by how effectively the company operates. In general, 
organizations with a less rigid structure have a higher likelihood of becoming more cus-
tomer focused, technologically innovative, and market responsive. Certainly, any conflicts 
between internal functions—manufacturing, design, engineering, and marketing—must 
be minimized. Technology for mass customization requires an integration of R&D, pro-
curement, customer relations management, and supply chain management to achieve a 
high degree of customer satisfaction (Levenson 2015; Biron 2014).
Above all, company management must apply discretionary resources (e.g., R&D, pro-
duction capacity, human resources, organizational expertise, and information services) to 
the right combination of strategies (e.g., marketing, product, distribution, promotion, and 
price) so that maximum strategic marketing leverage can be achieved to capture opportu-
nities offered in the marketplace. Figure 8.23 illustrates this core concept of organizational 
effectiveness.

8.13.3  Chasm for Marketing HT Industrial Products
For marketing HT industrial products, there are five general customer segments to con-
sider (Figure 8.24):
	
1.	Innovators (Techies): Excited with new innovative technologies
	
2.	Early Adopters (Visionaries): Look for strategic value, compelling applications
	
3.	Early Majority (Pragmatists): Willing to use new technologies, look for value and 
take some risks
	
4.	Late Majority (Conservatives): Focus on easy to use, take no risks
	
5.	Laggard (Skeptics): Suspicious to anything of being technologically new 
HT product marketing relies heavily on word-of-mouth references. Customers in the 
Innovators and Early Adopters segments are likely to be technical specialists who are by 
nature excited about things technologically new. Moore (2014) believes that customers in 
the Early Majority group are more conservative in viewing new technologies and thus 
may not be readily influenced by the views of Innovators and Early Adopters This could 
represent a major chasm for HT product vendors to overcome, when marketing HT prod-
ucts to the mainstream customers in Early Majority and Late Majority groups.
To overcome the noted chasm, companies marketing HT products are advised to follow 
these strategies:
	
1.	Create whole products (core products plus extensions)
	
2.	Focus on compelling reasons to buy
	
3.	Emphasize product differentiation in the marketplace 
Example 8.7
Engineering refined the design specifications of a product as originally recommended 
by marketing. Manufacturing made additional changes to the product design in order 
to fabricate the product automatically. Unfortunately, the product did not sell in suf-
ficient quantities to make it a success. Explain the possible reasons.

Answer 8.7
The product features defined initially by the marketing department may not be 
exactly what the majority of customers want. Product testing is a critical step to fine-
tune product design. The selected method of production does not readily accommo-
date an adjustment of product features, even if they are identified by feedback from 
the marketplace. The manufacturing of the product should be based on demand to 
ensure market acceptance, not based on production technology, which is aimed at 
cost reduction.
Skipping the product testing step with customer feedback and applying the automatic 
production method too soon are two likely reasons for the noted failure.
8.14  Conclusion
This chapter covers many important issues related to the marketing of a company’s 
products and services. Engineering managers should understand the overall objec-
tives of the firm’s marketing efforts and become sensitive to various marketing issues 
affecting engineering. They should become well versed with marketing terminology 
and elements of the marketing mix (7Ps), namely, product, price, promotion, placement 
(distribution), physical evidence, process design, and people. It is important for engi-
neering managers to accept the fact that marketing involves a lot of uncertainties associ-
ated with consumers’ perceptions, competitive analyses, and market forecasting. They 
need to wholeheartedly adopt customer orientation in planning and implementing all 
engineering efforts in support of marketing. They must strive to work closely with mar-
keting personnel and remain supportive of the overall marketing efforts by providing 
high-quality engineering inputs to the firm’s marketing program. As Cyrus Eaton said, 
“What counts in any system is the intelligence, self-control, conscience and energy of the 
individual.”
Obviously, the engineering inputs most useful to marketing are related to products/
services and associated production and customer support activities. These include speci-
fying and designing novel product/service features to be of value to customers; utiliz-
ing technologies to confer competitive advantages in time to market, quality, reliability, 
and serviceability; and delivering after-sales technical services needed to ensure customer 
satisfaction.
Engineers are also expected to contribute diligently by improving and managing the 
production process, utilizing resources (labor and materials), controlling quality, and esti-
mating product cost accurately with the activity-based costing (ABC) method. Engineers 
may also get involved in training salespeople, making technology-centered presenta-
tions before customers, conducting industrial exhibits, and evaluating customer feedback 
related to new product features.
Having learned the marketing concepts and been exposed to the complex marketing 
issues reviewed in this chapter, engineering managers will be able to appreciate the dif-
ficult but critically important functions of marketing and can become more effective in 
interacting with marketing management.
Marketing and innovations are two principal activities of any product-based and profit-
seeking organization. STEM professional already know how to innovate. If they also learn 
how to market, the combination of these capabilities will surely enable them to become 
major contributors in any technology-centered organization.

QUESTIONS
	
1.	What are the bases for trade-offs between conflicting wants and needs of different 
customers with respect to the same product? How important is it to emphasize 
product quality when a new and unique product is launched?
	
2.	Is it better to market a new product quickly and then upgrade the design later 
or to incorporate all design modifications or improvements before launching the 
product?
	
3.	How can product development costs be minimized by entering the market 
late?
	
4.	Customers’ wants and needs are regionally different for products intended for 
global markets. How can a centralized, concurrent engineering team develop a 
product that will serve as the common “platform” for global markets?
	
5.	ABC Company wishes to enter a new market arena on the basis of its strength 
in core technologies and financial staying power. However, the market arena in 
question is currently dominated by a major competitor with 80% of the market 
share, and a number of smaller competitors are each focused on small niche seg-
ments. How should ABC Company enter this market?
	
6.	A company makes a range of products and sells to several large, loyal customers to 
achieve a healthy market share. A new competitor has emerged to offer equivalent 
products at much lower prices. What should the company do?
	
7.	The company wants to develop a new product for a high-end consumer market. 
It is known that customers in this market are difficult to identify and are geo-
graphically dispersed. How should the company plan for product distribution 
and promotion?
	
8.	The company wishes to sell its current product in a new market segment. At the 
same time, it wants to launch a new product in the existing market segment. How 
should the company handle the product promotion?
Appendices
Appendix 8.A: Product Concept Testing Program (Air Cleaners)
In 1976, Dr. C. M. Chang, developed a nonelectric particle-filtration method while working 
at Praxair, a Fortune 200 industrial company. This technology was effective in eliminat-
ing airborne submicron particles in airstreams without producing the ozone gas that is 
harmful to people’s health. Product concepts were subsequently refined for air-cleaning 
products for residential markets. The impetus for pursuing these product concepts is the 
notion that harmful respirable dust particles are expected to increase in concentration 
over time in the ambient air due to combustion-related emissions from cars, trucks, power 
plants, and factories. Respirable dust particles trapped in human lungs are known to lead 
to asthma, cancer, and other diseases and discomfort. Elimination of such particulate pol-
lution in residential environments without the presence of ozone as a harmful gaseous 
agent should be attractive to consumers.

307
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
Before embarking on the major investment required for creating this proposed product 
line, the company decided to conduct a product-testing program to assess the consumers’ 
acceptance of the conceived product concepts and define additional product features that 
would satisfy consumers’ needs to the maximum extent possible.
	
1.	Focus group meetings: A commercial product concept-testing company was engaged 
to conduct a series of focus group meetings for the purpose of gauging customers’ 
responses to the proposed product concepts.
	
	
In preparation for the focus group meetings, 18 versions of the products were 
proposed. These product concepts covered the particles’ and gaseous pollut-
ants’ removal at high-, medium-, and low-performance levels. Tentative product 
names were assigned. Fabrication costs and features of competitive products were 
defined. Product brochures were prepared.
	
	
Three teams of customers were selected to form the focus groups. A product 
presentation was made to each focus group, including product price, pollutant 
removal performance, and availability. Questions asked by participating custom-
ers were answered.
	
	
Each focus group was asked to freely deliberate among its members their likes 
and dislikes and the advantages and disadvantages of the products. The groups 
were told that the products were currently in beta-testing stages in another part 
of the country and would soon be available in their region. The key question then 
was whether the customers would buy such products for their own use if they 
became available within a few months. If not at the proposed price, at what price 
would they be willing to buy the product?
	
	
All deliberations were video-recorded for subsequent analyses.
	
2.	Findings: The key findings are as follows: Among high-efficiency filter products, 
consumers buy air cleaners primarily for medical reasons. Therefore, products 
that are equally efficient, but at a lower price are not necessarily attractive for two 
reasons: (1) a high price ensures the perception of superior product features, (2) 
there may be an insensitivity to price because of medical insurance coverage. An 
air-cleaner device at equal price, but with much higher particle-removal perfor-
mance (e.g., one with 95% filtration versus another with 99.95% filtration) does not 
appear to be attractive because consumers cannot notice the performance differ-
ence without employing measurement devices.
	
	
High-priced products with intermediate particle-removal efficiency are not readily 
accepted by consumers with medical problems. These products are priced too high 
for other consumers interested only in reducing the residential environmental dust.
	
	
Products with low filtration efficiency and low price may appeal to the general 
public interested in having an adequate furnace filter at a price “worth the risk” 
for them. A throwaway filter of this type appears to be worth further consider-
ation, provided that it would cost only $5 or less and could fit into most existing 
furnaces. Figure 8.A1 summarizes the four categories of air cleaners defined by 
the two product features of price and particle-removal efficiency.
	
	
The capability to remove gaseous pollutants in residential air does not seem to 
appeal to consumers. Window add-ons and self-standing units do not seem to be 
attractive to them either. In other words, consumers do not understand the benefi-
cial value of the product features of ozone-free generation and efficient control of 

308
Engineering Management
submicron particles. It would take a major advertising effort to communicate the 
message and educate the masses.
	
	
However, countless consumers do purchase air-cleaning equipment without really 
knowing the difference in brands, because most electronic air cleaners have been pur-
chased as part of a bigger package. Retailers’ reputations for price and quality (e.g., Wal-
Mart stores, Sears) have exerted a noticeable influence on consumers.
	
3.	Learning: The key lesson learned from this product-testing program was that, if 
customers do not appreciate the value offered by a product, they will not buy it. In 
this case, the product developer did not fully appreciate the fact that, although it 
was scientifically evident at the time that inhaling submicron particles is detrimen-
tal to personal health, the majority of consumers do not appreciate the importance 
of such scientific facts and thus do not assign the proper importance to the product 
features offered. As indicated by Mello (2002), customer inputs are indeed useful.
	
	
Another lesson learned was that the timing of the products was also off. The 
air-cleaning products described were ahead of their time. In March 2002, studies 
published in The Journal of American Medical Association indicated that, for every 
10 mg/m3 increase in particle concentration in ambient air, there is an 8% increase 
in risk for lung cancer death and a 6% increase in death due to other lung- and heart-
related diseases. Several major U.S. cities are known to have particle-pollution levels 
in excess of the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) standard of 15 mg/m3. In 
the absence of similar studies and authentic sources of information, consumers will 
not understand the long-term benefits of such products as air cleaners.
	
	
In March 2003, Sharperimage.com advertised an Ionic Breeze air purifier at 
$349.95. This product was built on the basis of the principle of electrostatic pre-
cipitation. Flat-plate collectors, which are easily cleaned, are used to capture most 
submicron particles found in residential buildings.
	
	
In summary, the product concept-testing program that Dr. Chang’s company 
used supported the notion that product concepts developed from technology may 
not be as commercially marketable as those derived from the perceived needs and 
wants of customers. The results of the program add evidence to the known reality 
that marketing is as important as technology innovation for a company to achieve 
commercial success.

Appendix 8.B: Consumer Survey and Market Research
To market consumer products, companies need to have a very detailed understanding of 
their customers, just as companies marketing industrial products also need to understand 
their customers, although to a much lesser extent.
When dealing with customers, the key questions typically concern what, how, where, 
when, why, and who.
For example, what functions does the product serve? What are the criteria to buy the 
product (price, color, size)? What is the value to the customer? What do they really want 
from the product (psychological, functional, and other benefits)?
How do customers compare products? How do customers decide to buy? How is the 
product used? How much are customers willing to pay for it? How much do they buy? 
How would the distribution mode and service center location affect the customers’ buying 
decision?
Where is the purchase decision made (e.g., what is the customer’s position in the com-
pany or household)? Where do they receive information? Where do they buy their prod-
ucts (retail store, mail order, department store, Internet, etc.)?
When do they buy it (weekly, monthly, special occasions)?
Why do they prefer one brand over the other (performance, price, convenience, packag-
ing, colors, service, etc.)?
Who are the customers (age, background, sex, geographic location, members of social 
groups, etc.)? Who buys the competitor’s products? Who does the buying (wife, husband, 
children, purchasing agent, engineers, others)? Who makes what decision for whom (deci-
sion-making units)?
To understand the behavior of consumers in making purchase decisions, companies 
focus on customers’ habit in purchasing, consuming, and information gathering. Who 
buys, how often, where, how much, when, and at what price? Who consumes, on what 
occasions, how do they consume, in what quantities, where, when, and with what other 
products? What media do they use (industrial exhibits, trade journals, TV, newspaper, 
radio, Internet, etc.), and when?
It is also useful for companies to understand the process by which consumers make 
their purchase decisions. This process typically encompasses the steps of need arousal 
(problems to solve; discovery from neutral sources; Jones the bragging next-door neighbor; 
etc.), information search (online resources are now one click away), and evaluation and 
decision-making (comparative shopping, making trade-offs, brand versus product, and 
price versus quality and features).
Appendix 8.C: New Product Development
New product development has been extensively studied in the literature. Typically, com-
panies follow a number of steps to develop new products: idea generation, idea screening, 
profitability analysis, product development, and commercialization.
To bring about new product ideas, companies use multiple sources. The internal 
sources include R&D and salespeople. The external sources include users initiated, 
competitors, industrial organizations, and product consulting firms. Innovation is the 
principal technique to identify valuable ideas by applying known principles to different 
processes or in unique configuration, thus producing unexpected benefits such as lower 
cost, smaller size, lighter weight, enhanced user convenience, better functionality, and 
so on.

310
Engineering Management
Two examples of innovative products are noteworthy. The new Segway Human 
Transporter is a clever combination of known technology (battery, gyroscope, wheels, 
stick-enabled weight-based control) and constructed in a unique way to create unexpected 
benefits. Another example is Bandag, a major tire retreading company that provides spe-
cialty composite materials in its retreads in response to different road conditions and travel 
patterns. It developed an innovation by embedding a computer chip in the tire. This chip 
monitors tire performance, calculates wear and tear, and determines balance. It becomes a 
value-added service to truck-fleet managers who are then able to track the total cost of tire 
purchases better than before. Its value in use is derived through information and a tracking 
system that provides important savings due to added life to tires and minimized fuel costs.
Now Bandag’s Tire Management Solution business unit offers quality service in the 
acquisition, maintenance, and recycling of tires to customers, allowing customers to focus 
on their own core business interests.
Product ideas must be screened with respect to criteria such as marketability, market 
size and growth rate, production capabilities, and profitability. Marketability refers to the 
extent to which the proposed product ideas are acceptable to the customers in the target 
segments. Factors affecting marketability include price, product quality, substitution prod-
ucts from competition, available distribution channels, and customer preferences. Market 
size and market growth rate must be at reasonable levels for the product ideas to be worth 
pursuing. Suitable production capabilities, such as raw materials, know-how, skilled labor, 
and equipment must be readily available. Finally, product ideas must have the potential for 
generating sufficient margins to justify the required investment expenditures.
In conducting profitability analysis for product ideas, several factors should be considered. 
The demand factors include users’ needs, substitution products, price, advertising, segment 
size and growth rate, distribution, competition, and interaction with existing products. The 
cost factors are related to product cost, plant size, technology level, utilization of the plant, 
possible technological changes, and cost interdependency between existing and new prod-
ucts. The profit factors consist of product pricing, timing of profits (e.g., in three to five years), 
constraints on profits (due to plant capacity, financing limits, distribution requirements, 
management limits), governmental constraints (OSHA, trade, and environmental laws and 
regulations), and labor restrictions (availability of trained labor and seniority). The decision 
factors assess the profit levels, risks, uncertainty (as in estimating the risks in the market), 
and capital budgeting (investment, cost of capital, timing, and cash-flow pattern).
Once product ideas are deemed worth pursuing, some companies invoke the target-pric-
ing approach (see Section 8.6.3) to determine the maximum CGS (target CGS) that would 
ensure commercialization and profitability of these product ideas.
A very detailed cost analysis follows for the requisite functions of product design (product 
attributes by a perceptual map, modular concepts, interchangeable components, subsys-
tem compatibility, advanced materials, emerging technologies) and fabrication and proto-
typing (flexible production, fabrication technology, automated processes, quality control, 
supply chains, maintenance requirements). The full-scale product development work is to 
be authorized only if the target CGS will not be exceeded.
It is generally advisable for product development to be entrusted to a multifunctional team 
in which all major disciplines (such as marketing, sales, design, value engineering, produc-
tion, distribution, procurement, customer service, and finance) are represented. Doing so 
will cut down the needs of subsequent design changes, improve the all-important time-to-
market performance, and ensure a high probability of product acceptance in the marketplace.
One important area in which engineers should make significant contributions is 
cost reduction in the design and manufacturing of products. For example, developing 

311
Marketing Management for Engineering Managers
innovative techniques to combine production steps, simplifying design, using lower-cost 
materials, and creating interchangeable parts for groups of products can all lower costs. 
Another area in which engineers can add value is the improvement of product reliability, 
serviceability, and maintainability.
For certain products, companies may elect to conduct a test marketing program. The 
purpose is to seek feedback from users regarding such variables as service quality, likes, 
dislikes, desired new product attributes, relative ranking of existing product features, and 
price levels that users are willing to pay. Also useful to collect are data related to sales 
results from the targeted segment, adequacy of selected distribution channels, effective-
ness of the promotional message, and service quality. Such information will allow the 
company to augment its product attributes before launching a major product.
Product commercialization involves final preparations before launching the product. 
These preparations include specifying a product name that is easy to pronounce and distin-
guish; a value package with price, features, value, and product functionality; product styling 
(e.g., industrial design is important to car buyers); production (financing, labor and mate-
rials resources, technologies, and supply chains); sales and marketing (advertising, distri-
bution, sales force training, and product brochures); and service (customer call centers, 
websites, maintenance and repair, and problem solving).
According to published survey results, the introduction of new products in different 
industries has resulted in quite different product failure rates (see Table 8.A1).
Figure 8.A2 presents the “1 in 60” product-development curve, in which 60 product 
ideas pursued initially whittle down to only one product that will become commercially

successful, if the company follows the traditional, sequential product development pro-
cess. However, if a concurrent product development process is employed, the success rate 
will increase to 1 in 7.
There are a large number of reasons why products fail in the marketplace. The following 
list summarizes the principal reasons:
	
1.	Lack of meaningful uniqueness in product features (“me-too” products)
	
2.	Poor planning (no distribution, service, spare parts, inadequate advertising)
	
3.	Wrong timing (economy, season)
	
4.	Excessive optimism
	
5.	Poor product performance (functional deficiency)
	
6.	Product champion failure
	
7.	Company politics
	
8.	Unexpectedly high product cost

Section III
Engineering Leadership in 
the New Millennium
Section III of this book addresses six major topics: (1) engineers as managers and leaders 
(Chapter 9), (2) creativity and innovation (Chapter 10), (3) ethics in engineering and the 
workplace (Chapter 11), (4) operational excellence (Chapter 12), (5) globalization (Chapter 13), 
and (6) engineering management in the new millennium (Chapter 14). These discussions 
provide additional building blocks to prepare science, technology, engineering, and math 
(STEM) professionals and managers to assume technology leadership positions and to 
meet the challenges of the new millennium.
STEM professionals and managers are known to possess a strong set of skills that enable 
them to do extraordinarily well in certain types of managerial work. However, some may 
also exhibit weaknesses that prevent them from becoming effective leaders in engineering 
organizations, or even from being able to survive as STEM professionals in industry. The 
expected norms of effective leaders are described. Steps are discussed that enable STEM 
professionals and managers to enhance their leadership qualities and attune themselves to 
a value-centered business acumen. Certain outlined steps should be of great value to those 
STEM professionals and managers who want to become better prepared to create new 
products and services, integrate technology into their organizations, and lead technology-
based organizations.
Of particular importance for STEM professionals and managers to emphasize, when 
exercising leadership in the new millennium, is to contribute to the creation of strategic 
differentiation and operational excellence for their enterprises. Chapter 10 offers ways of 
generating novel ideas by using question-based prompts, and then develop differentiable 
and novel product/service packages to satisfy the customers’ needs in the marketplace. 
Chapter 12 suggests a large number of proven industrial engineering productivity tools 
(e.g., Lean Six Sigma, value streaming mapping, failure mode, and effect analysis) and 
Internet-based productivity enablers (e.g., big data, analytics, and cloud computing) to 
facilitate communications, preserve company knowledge, cut cost, improve productivity, 
raise process efficiency, align supply chains and speed up time to market, and improve 
customer service for the enterprise.

316
Engineering Leadership in the New Millennium
Many tried-and-true rules are included that serve as suitable guidelines for STEM 
professionals and managers to becoming excellent leaders. Above all, they are expected 
to lead with a vision of how to apply company core competencies to create value, insights 
into how to capture opportunities offered by emerging technologies, and innovations in 
making products and services better, faster, and cheaper, so that they constantly improve 
customer satisfaction. The concepts of value addition, customer focus, mass customiza-
tion, supply chains, and enterprise resources integration are also discussed.
Although STEM professionals and managers are known to rank high in trustworthiness 
and integrity (ahead of businessmen, bankers, certified public accountants, politicians, 
and lawyers), it is important for all STEM professionals and managers to remain vigilant 
in observing a code of ethics, along with taking seriously other topics related to ethics (see 
Table 11.2).
Globalization is further expanding the perspectives of STEM professionals and managers 
with respect to divergence in culture, business practices, and value. Globalization is a 
major business trend that will affect many enterprises in the future. STEM professionals 
and managers must become sensitized to the issues involved and prepare themselves to 
contribute to enterprises wishing to capture new business opportunities offered in the 
global markets. They also need to be aware of the potential effects of job migration due to 
globalization and prepare to meet such challenges. The major hurdle for STEM profession-
als and managers to overcome is the creation of global technical alliances that will enable 
them to take advantage of new technological and business opportunities.
STEM professionals and managers will face external challenges in the new millennium. 
What these specific challenges are, how engineering managers need to prepare to meet 
these challenges, and how to optimally make use of location-specific opportunities to create 
competitive advantages will be examined. Progressive companies will also change organi-
zational structures, set up supply chains, expedite e-transformation, and apply advanced 
tools to serve customers better, cheaper, and faster. Globalization is also expected to con-
stantly evolve. The United Nations has predicted that by 2020, three of the five biggest 
national economies will be located in Asia. There will certainly be winners and losers as 
businesses become more and more global. It is important for future engineering managers 
to explore prudent corporate strategies for engineering enterprises in the pursuit of global-
ization, while minimizing any detrimental impact on the environment and maintaining 
acceptable human rights and labor conditions.
How should STEM professionals and managers prepare themselves to add value in the 
new millennium? What are the success factors for engineering managers in the new cen-
tury? What might be the social responsibilities of engineering managers in the decades 
ahead? These questions are addressed in the final chapter of the book. The new millen-
nium will create ample opportunities for those who know how to properly prepare and 
equip themselves with the required skills, knowledge, savvy, and mind-set.
To foster the leadership roles of engineering managers, a six-dimensional model is 
proposed to emphasize its inside, outside, present, future, local, and global dimensions. 
The management challenges for STEM professionals and managers in these dimensions 
are discussed.

Engineers as Managers/Leaders
9.1  Introduction
Engineering managers lead teams, groups, units, or enterprises to generate products and 
services that are highly technical in nature. The importance of developing engineering 
managers is well recognized (Schermerhorn 2013). Many believe that the development 
of new engineering management talent is crucial to the survival and growth of their 
companies’ businesses.
Technical talents are important prerequisites for becoming leaders, as most science, tech-
nology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals do not readily accept superiors with 
weak technical credentials. For this reason, countless organizations choose only topflight 
engineers as candidates for development to become corporate managers.
Typically, engineers are well trained for certain managerial functions. They are known 
to have the following skills and attributes:
	
1.	Thinking logically, methodically, and objectively while making unemotional 
decisions based on facts and data
	
2.	Analyzing problems and defining technologically feasible solutions
	
3.	Understanding what motivates other STEM professionals
	
4.	Evaluating work with highly technological contents
	
5.	Planning for the future, addressing the company’s needs in technology, produc-
tivity, and cost-effectiveness
	
6.	Discussing technical information with customers
	
7.	Possessing technical expertise that supports high-quality decision-making
Statistics indicate that, whereas engineers are highly trained professionals, as a group, 
they play only a limited leadership role in U.S. industry and economy. Does the engineer-
ing mind-set represent a disadvantage for certain top-level managerial positions? Some 
people say there may be certain personal attributes, traits, and habits that tend to cause 
engineers to be poor managers. This chapter addresses some of these potential drawbacks 
(Younts 2006).
The first part of this chapter looks at the career path of a typical engineer, the factors 
affecting the promotion of engineers to managers, the factors causing engineers to fail 
as managers, and finally leaders and managers. The second part of the chapter discusses 
leadership styles, qualities, and attributes; leadership skills for the twenty-first century; 
unique contributions expected of engineering managers; and a career strategy for the new 

318
Engineering Management
millennium. The chapter concludes with a take-charge formula to inspire engineers to be 
proactive in managing their own professional lives.
9.2  Career Path of a Typical Engineer
In any engineering organization, people accept different positions; some are classified 
as line positions, whereas others are staff positions. Holders of line positions perform 
various activities in order to produce and market products or services. Holders of staff 
positions provide advice, services, and support to the holders of line positions. A career 
path represents a planned progression to higher-level positions of responsibilities within 
or outside an organization, each of which may require a different set of business and 
technical skills.
9.2.1  The Engineer as Technical Contributor
At the beginning of an engineer’s career, his or her job is mostly of a technical nature. 
Tasks performed include the application of engineering principles and know-how to tech-
nical problems in order to verify or predict a specific technical outcome. The engineer is 
expected to be able to do things right on the basis of his or her college education, which 
sometimes may be supplemented by on-the-job training.
Over time, the engineer may build a reputation for being particularly knowledgeable 
in one or more technical domains (e.g., component design, process development, quality 
control, or reliability analysis) and becomes recognized as an expert for others to consult 
with, should such a need arise. Because of his or her expertise, the engineer may be asked 
to serve as a technical contributor on teams involved in product development, technology-
based projects, feasibility studies, and other such multidisciplinary group endeavors. Still, 
the work done by the engineer remains mostly technical in nature.
On a technical career path, the engineer is expected to accomplish technical work of 
high quality based on a solid understanding of engineering fundamentals, efficacious 
application of basic principles, and sound technical judgment. As seen by coworkers and 
managers alike, the engineer needs to be easy to work with. The engineer must exhibit 
strong motivation to learn and improve, in addition to a high degree of maturity and pro-
fessionalism. In well-managed enterprises, the promotion of such engineers to the next 
level on the technical career ladder is usually assured.
It is highly advisable that engineers follow the 10 Get Success rules in managing their 
own careers:
	
1.	Get connected to empower personal and business networks
	
2.	Embrace own mistakes, and learn from them
	
3.	Take the lead in teams to motivate and empower people
	
4.	Secure diversified experience and knowledge
	
5.	Understand self and do strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) 
analysis
	
6.	Create a personal strategic and operational plan

319
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
	
7.	Cultivate an open mind toward things that are different and foreign
	
8.	Exemplify own truthful and authentic self
	
9.	Strengthen own practices, and adhere to ethics and integrity rules
	 10.	Sustain best efforts all the time
Appendix 9.A lists a number of success factors affecting the career of an engineer in 
industry. Appendix 9.B itemizes some common reasons for career failures.
9.2.2  Midlevel Positions
After a couple of initial promotions on the technical career ladder, the engineer is now 
ready to assume higher-level responsibilities and will be asked to make an important 
choice between staying on the technical ladder and moving forward on the managerial 
career path.
The midlevel positions along the technical career path include such titles as senior 
engineer, consultant, engineering/development associate, and corporate fellow. On the 
managerial career path, these positions are equivalent to group leader, section engineer, 
manager, and director, respectively. Some companies may use slightly different titles, but 
the basic organizational design concept is that there are equivalent positions on these two 
career ladders leading up to director or fellow level.
On the technical career path, the engineer may assume greater responsibility for 
highly technical projects for which specific funds and people are allocated. The manage-
rial responsibilities of an engineering or development associate or corporate fellow are 
limited. The expected key contribution is to add value through technological leadership 
related to new technology products and processes by invention and unique application of 
emerging technologies. A corporate fellow is usually recognized as a technical leader both 
inside and outside the company. Note that for numerous well-established companies, the 
technical ladder has a glass ceiling that tops out at the corporate fellow level. It is rare for 
companies to have another technical position at the corporate vice-presidential level.
More conventional is the managerial ladder, which requires the engineer to take on 
responsibilities that deal with nonengineering issues affecting the operation of the orga-
nization. As the individual progresses up this career ladder, the engineer spends less and 
less time on engineering/technology issues and tasks and more and more on managerial 
assignments. This career path continues beyond director to reach vice president of engi-
neering/technology and chief technology officer (CTO). The expected key contribution is 
to add value by deciding on the correct technology-centered projects for the company to 
pursue, and by securing the needed resources to implement them.
Not everyone wants to become a manager. Typical incentives for some STEM profession-
als to favor moving into management include (1) gaining financial rewards; (2) exercising 
authority, responsibility, and leadership; (3) acquiring power, influence, status, and pres-
tige; (4) receiving career advancement, achievement, and recognition; (5) combating fear of 
technological obsolescence; and (6) responding to a random circumstance—an opportu-
nity that is suddenly available. These incentives need to be contrasted with certain draw-
backs associated with being managers, such as increased workload, stress due to making 
decisions under uncertainty, difficulty in achieving work–family balance, burdens related 
to business travel, and so on. Whether a technical or managerial career ladder is suitable 
for an engineer is very much a personal choice, as there are advantages and disadvantages 
to both.

320
Engineering Management
In a 2014 report, John Surgent of the National Science Foundation described the employ-
ment situation of U.S. engineers and scientists. Out of a total of 2,343,600 engineers and 
scientists, 46.1% held management and administrative positions. Figure 9.1 indicates that 
this percentage varies only slightly with age. Almost one out of two engineers or scientists 
has taken on managerial or administrative responsibilities.
Appendix 9.C includes some tips for first-time supervisors and managers to cope with 
their new responsibilities. At any of the previously described position levels, engineers 
will need to effectually collaborate with others, especially with their own superiors. 
Appendix 9.D offers some hints on how to properly manage one’s own superiors.
9.2.3  Promotion to Next Level
Generally speaking, promotion along the technical career path is primarily based on com-
pany needs. A company may have five corporate fellows covering five different technology 
domains, but have only one CTO. If the individual’s expertise serves as a core competency 
of the company, and the engineer’s qualifications and the importance of responsibilities 
so justify, companies have been known to create new technical positions to accommodate 
such individuals (Benenour 2015; Asher 2014).
Promotion on the managerial ladder is subject to tough competition as the available 
opportunities carrying increasing executive-level responsibilities become more and more 
restricted. Exploring such opportunities outside the present employers may become a 
practical option.
Once in executive positions, engineering managers are expected to exert leadership in 
creating new visions and implementing technological strategies to foster business suc-
cesses. Table 9.1 illustrates the change in work content of an engineering manager who 
advances from entry to middle management and executive-level positions.
Specifically, the CTO, who reports to the chief executive officer (CEO) and hopes to get 
important technological strategies accepted for implementation by the company, will need

to work with and solicit support from peer officers: the chief information officer (CIO), 
chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), chief marketing officer (CMO), 
and chief knowledge officer (CKO). It takes leadership talents to be efficacious in such a 
collaborative setting.
9.3  Factors Affecting Promotion to Manager
Generally speaking, there are some basic prerequisites for engineers to receive promo-
tions to the managerial ranks. These prerequisites will be discussed next (Humphrey 2013; 
Mohapatra 2014; Bhatawdekar and Bhatawdekar 2013).
The engineer must be able to master the duties and responsibilities of his or her current 
position, have the respect of his or her coworkers, and receive favorable recommendations 
from his or her superiors.
The candidate must have demonstrated his or her readiness to handle greater and more 
challenging responsibilities, as well as having gained the required skills and knowledge 
via courses, seminars, on-the-job training, professional activities, teamwork, volunteer 
work, tasks related to proposal development, feasibility studies, technology assessment, 
and other avenues. The candidate must possess the skills to manage time, and have the 
desire to seek leadership positions and opportunities to exercise power and manage 
people, spearhead change, and resolve conflicts.
Being competent and ready for promotion to managerial positions is a necessary, but 
not sufficient, condition for being promoted. The candidate’s ambition, desires, and capa-
bilities must also be a good match with the current and long-term needs of the company. 
Well-organized enterprises constantly need new managers and leaders because of the 
dynamics in the business environment, advancement of technology, competition in the 
marketplace, and the mobility of people.
Managerial competency may be classified according to the categories illustrated in 
Figure 9.2. Specifically, it is helpful for engineers who aspire to become managers to focus 
on the following general capabilities:
	
1.	Engineering management skills: These skills include the engineering management 
functions of planning, organizing, leading, controlling, and the ability to work 
with people, and are built on having excellent communication skills.
	
2.	Power base formation: Candidates must nurture the ability to build personal power 
by technical know-how, experience, and networking. Promoting and marketing 
one’s own achievements are important, following the well-known saying, “Early 
to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and advertise!”

3.	Assertiveness: Candidates should demonstrate the ability to become and remain 
assertive in exercising judgment and making decisions. They should be profi-
cient in resolving conflicts and problems of a technical, political, conceptual, and 
people-centered nature.
One primary talent that defines managerial excellence is the ability to deliver tangible 
and measurable results regularly. Harvard Business School (2004) published the “The 
Results-Driven Manager” series comprising the following 21 concise, action-oriented 
guides
	
1.	Motivating people for improved performance
	
2.	Presentation to persuade and motivate

	 16.	Connecting with customers
	 17.	Creating breakthrough innovations
	 18.	Hiring smart for competitive advantage
	 19.	Managing performance for maximizing results
	 20.	Executing strategy for business results
	 21.	Managing knowledge to fuel growth
It should be useful for STEM professionals to review these capabilities and seek 
continuous improvements in all the requisite skills.
Example 9.1
According to Aucoin (2002), engineering managers must possess a set of skills that are 
not taught in a typical college engineering curriculum. These skills include the ability 
to (1) deal with ambiguity and uncertainty, (2) lead (teams, projects, and technological 
development), (3) take prudent risks, (4) delegate tasks to become increasingly effec-
tive, (5) be a team builder, (6) communicate, (7) initiate new projects, (8) negotiate to 
resolve conflicts, (9) network to form support groups, and (10) build alliances and 
partnerships.
How do you propose that an engineer acquire these skills?
Answer 9.1
To acquire the previously described skills, engineers could follow these steps:
	
1.	 Understand why each skill set is important, and verify its importance by talk-
ing with trusted partners (e.g., parents, close friends, relatives, professional 
acquaintances, and mentors). Other steps useful for enhancing understanding 
and building leadership skills are to
 
a.	 Browse technical, business, and managerial publications (e.g., technical 
journals, BusinessWeek, Fortune, Wall Street Journal, and Harvard Business 
Review).
	
b.	 Keep informed of new advancements in the field, such as business strat-
egies, market expansion, technologies, innovations, customer relation 
management, enterprise integration systems, supply chain management, 
business models, lean manufacturing, and e-business.
	
c.	 Absorb new concepts and practices, and become proficient in identifying 
best practices, success factors, and other benchmarks.
	
d.	 Recognize new opportunities in technologies, business, and products 
potentially valuable to the organization.
	
2.	 Understand the metrics (standards) for measuring and monitoring progress 
made in acquiring these skill sets.
	
3.	 Conceive a plan for operation, including specific action steps and milestones.
	
4.	 Make a commitment to implement the plan by setting aside time and effort.
	
5.	 Take courses and training seminars, observe experienced managers and lead-
ers in action, and ask experienced people to share their insight into acquiring 
the specific techniques needed to facilitate technical and managerial growth 
and to build and maintain skills. Training programs are available at profes-
sional societies. Some companies offer internal training services or subscribe 
to external courses. The American Management Association holds public 
training sessions. There are also some university-based training programs.
	
6.	 Proactively seek opportunities to practice the learned techniques. Volunteer 
for team assignments. Become an officer in a students’ organization. Do 

324
Engineering Management
volunteer work in church, scouting organizations, charities, the United Way, 
the Rotary Club, or political groups. Spend time in professional societies or 
industrial committees. Join Toastermasters International to practice public-
speaking skills. 
9.4  Factors Causing Engineers to Fail as Managers
Certain articles address the factors that cause engineers to fail as managers. Engineers 
may be handicapped by a number of perceived shortcomings that do not allow them to 
become good managers. These perceived shortcomings are illustrated next.
Engineers tend to be straightforward, honest, and open, and have strong views based on 
verifiable facts and data. According to Broder (1992), some engineers (1) hate company poli-
tics (they tend to be technically intelligent, but sometimes politically amateurish); (2) do 
not build a personal network; (3) are uneasy trying to fit into an organizational culture 
because of strong beliefs, unique value systems, rigid principles, and inflexible attitudes; 
and (4) have an engineering mind-set that is rational, efficient, and introspective. They 
may see things as either right or wrong, and may not be willing or able to accept different 
shades of gray. For holders of midlevel and top-level managerial positions, this mind-set 
may confer disadvantages when attempting to resolve conflicts, handle disagreements, 
and foster alliances.
The technical training of engineers is based on equations, logic, experimental data, and 
mathematical analyses; this tends to make engineers see the world as orderly, certain, and 
black and white. The business environment in the real world causes some engineers to be 
uncomfortable with approximate or incomplete answers, since they have been trained well 
to recognize indeterminate problems and declare them unsolvable. They are not used to 
the idea of introducing additional assumptions and thus making such problems solvable. 
Some engineers hate problems with inaccurate or unknown factors and dislike planning 
with uncertainty (e.g., strategic planning). They may also want to avoid using intuitive 
knowledge. They prefer cognitive knowledge, which is based on facts and data, and thus 
they lack the ability and willingness to make tough decisions by using intuition and gut 
feelings.
Some engineers are too serious in their approach to professional life. They may be 
unable to say no and ask for help, allowing their personal ego and pride to get in the way. 
They may have the tendency to take mistakes personally, because they are afraid to be 
wrong.
Similarly, some engineers are conservative in nature. They may have a low tolerance for 
risks. Because of their tense personalities, they may not be comfortable taking risks to reach 
for higher levels of reward. Some graduates with a master’s degree in business adminis-
tration (MBA) are said to be “often wrong, but never in doubt”; they continue, despite 
often being wrong, to try new risky approaches until they reach their goals. Engineers are 
quite different in this respect. While having strong self-confidence in their own technical 
capabilities, many engineers do not like to take risks.
In fact, deciding to do something and actually doing so are two different things. There 
is the well-known riddle about five frogs on a log (Feldman 2001). “Five frogs are sitting on 
a log. Four decided to jump off. How many are left?” “Why, one frog of course,” or “five 
frogs.” Both are wrong. Even though four frogs decided to jump off, nothing is said about 

325
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
their having actually done so. Decision is not equal to action. Not taking action for fear of 
risks is typically viewed as a personal weakness.
Some engineers do not feel comfortable leaving their fields of technological strength 
when assuming managerial responsibilities. They tend to lean on technology as a safety 
net. From their viewpoint, technology is more readily controllable, and they are fearful of 
losing their sense of control. Some of them even have the uninformed notion that technol-
ogy is the only thing worthy of respect, that it is valuable, intellectually pure, and deserv-
ing of their efforts. Their perspectives are limited, causing them not to recognize that other 
functions that may be technically less intensive, such as customer service, marketing, pro-
curement, production, and supply chain management, can also contribute equal, or in 
some cases, more value to the organization than engineering and technology.
Because of their conservative nature, some engineers may be reactive in social settings 
and remain inflexible in dealing with a diversity of issues and people. Some of them may 
be readily argumentative and self-righteous when confronted with viewpoints radically 
different from their own. Over time, some of them may be perceived as suffering from a 
lack of human relations skills and the inability to become good team players.
One of the noted shortcomings of highly talented engineers is their lack of willingness 
to delegate. Some of them are not able to work through people and help others to succeed. 
They would prefer to ensure high quality by doing the projects or tasks themselves. Many 
are unwilling to develop subordinates for fear that one day the trainees may become tech-
nically more talented than themselves. Other engineers may have the tendency to apply 
self-imposed, ultrahigh standards in appraising employees. They have difficulty tolerat-
ing below par performance by teammates or coworkers. Still other engineers have the 
tendency to overmanage and overcontrol their subordinates.
Some engineers are unexpectedly promoted to managerial ranks because they per-
formed well as technologists. Due to a lack of preparation on their part, these newly pro-
moted engineers have either limited or no understanding of what managers are supposed 
to do—that is, to add value by efficiently applying resources to the right projects. They 
lack the preparation to do a manager’s job. They are not aware of the fact that people prob-
lems require more time and attention than technical problems. Because of a lack of expo-
sure to nontechnical but equally important issues, they have not acquired the background 
required to develop a well-rounded business sense.
Engineers may be specialists in narrow technical fields. As a consequence, they have 
narrow technical viewpoints and limited vision and perspectives beyond technologies. 
They are not prepared to deal with accounting, marketing, production, finance, and other 
corporate issues outside of technology.
Numerous engineers may suffer, to varying extents, from some of the shortcomings just 
cited. Engineers who aspire to become managers should carefully examine their strengths 
and weaknesses, and commit their efforts to making sure that all of these factors for failure 
are minimized over time.
9.5  Leaders and Managers
Companies need both leaders and managers. According to Tulsiani (2014), management 
focuses on (1) choosing goals and targets typically set by existing corporate strategies; 
(2) planning action steps to achieve the chosen goals; (3) allocating required resources; 

326
Engineering Management
(4) creating organizational structures; and (5) exercising control, measuring results, and 
correcting performance to ensure the attainment of goals. The primary duty of manage-
ment is to keep the organization functioning properly. Management planning is deductive 
in nature, since it aims at creating orderly results.
Leadership, on the other hand, focuses on (1) setting a vision and direction for the future 
in response to changes imposed on the organization externally; (2) creating strategies to 
produce the changes needed to achieve the vision; (3) designing action steps to accom-
plish the strategic goals; (4) aligning people and forming coalitions; and (5) motivating and 
inspiring people to move in the right direction. The function of leadership is to produce 
change. Setting direction by leadership is inductive in nature, as it attempts to produce a 
new vision and new strategies. Vision is the picture of what the company will be in the 
long run with respect to its business portfolio, market position, technological prowess, and 
company culture.
The emphasis placed and the approach taken by managers differs from those of lead-
ers. Table 9.2 summarizes such differences, based on published work (Breaux 2013; 
Olson 2014).
It is further believed that strong leadership with weak management is no better—and 
is sometimes actually worse—than the reverse. A competitive organization needs both 
strong leadership and strong management, and should use each to balance the other. 
Management is needed to ensure that complex organizations operate properly, including 
attaining incremental improvements. Leadership is needed to cope with changes that will 
be thrust upon the organization due to advancements in technology, changes in market 
environments, and competition at international level.
The transition from manager to leader has been the subject of a few studies (Conger 
1992; Zenger and Folkman 2009). Engineers interested in becoming managers and leaders 
should also review the 78 questions raised by Bloomberg (2014), study the 12 principles 
delineated by Shallenberger (2014), and master the 6 competencies described by Pelus 
and Horth (2002). They may benefit from the lessons learned by other leaders (Krames 
2004). Those who regard General Electric’s Jack Welch as a leader to emulate have several 
resources to consult (Welch 2003; Krames 2005; Slater 2002).
Example 9.2
Every engineering manager has strengths and weaknesses. The key to continuous 
improvement is, of course, to identify one’s own weaknesses and do something about 
them. How should an engineering manager study oneself and systematically discover 
opportunities for improvement?
Answer 9.2
Henry Mintzberg (2009), in his article “The Manager’s Job: Folklore and Fact,” proposed 
a large number of insightful questions for managerial self-study. These questions are 
worth studying. Examples of these questions are
	
1.	 Where do I get my information, and how? In what area(s) is my knowledge 
weakest, and how can I get others to provide me with the information I need?
	
2.	 What information do I disseminate? How may I get more information to others 
so that they can make better decisions?
	
3.	 Do I tend to act before information is in? Or do I wait so long for all the 
information that opportunities pass me by?
	
4.	 What pace of change am I asking my organization to tolerate? Is this change 
balanced?

327
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
	
5.	 Am I sufficiently well informed to pass judgment on subordinates’ proposals? 
Do we have problems of coordination because subordinates already make too 
many decisions independently?
	
6.	 What is my vision for this organization? How firm are these plans?
	
7.	 How do my subordinates react to my managerial style? Do I find an appropriate 
balance between encouragement and pressure?
	
8.	 What kind of external relationships do I maintain, and how? Are there certain 
people I should get to know better?
	
9.	 Is there any system to my time scheduling, or am I just reacting to the pressure 
of the moment?

9.6  Leadership Styles, Qualities, and Attributes
9.6.1  Leadership Styles
The consulting firm Hay Group conducted a survey on leadership styles with a sample of 
3,871 executives, from a worldwide database of 20,000 executives. According to Goleman 
(2013), the following styles were identified by the survey as particularly useful for generat-
ing results: (1) authoritative (“come with me”), (2) affiliate (“people come first”), (3) dem-
ocratic (“what do you think?”), and (4) coaching (“try this”). Goleman also advises that 
leaders should minimize the use of two additional styles, namely, (5) coercive (“do what 
I tell you”) and (6) pacesetting (“do as I do now”).
Effective leaders are said to switch constantly between the authoritative, affiliative, dem-
ocratic, and coaching styles, depending on the situation at hand. The key concept here is 
flexibility. Those engineers who are weak in any of these four styles are advised to seek 
self-improvement.
Example 9.3
The NASA space shuttle Columbia broke up during its descent on February 1, 2003, killing 
all crew on board. Immediately after its launch, it was made known to NASA Mission 
Control Center that a piece of solid foam had broken off from the shuttle’s external fuel 
tank during its ascent and smashed into its left wing at high speed. During Columbia’s 
16-day space journey, NASA management dismissed the significance of this mishap 
and did nothing. Instead, NASA insisted that the incident was a routine affair, as foam 
pieces had broken off in a number of previous space flights. Furthermore, NASA over-
turned the requests of its lower-level engineers to obtain U.S. Department of Defense 
pictures of the wing that were photographed by military satellites. Low-level engineers 
e-mailed a query to their superiors about the possibility of getting the astronauts to take 
a spacewalk, which was safe and easy to do, to inspect the wing. That e-mail was never 
answered.
NASA management lost two precious opportunities to avert the disaster. Furthermore, 
Columbia could have had its mission extended by another three to four weeks, allowing 
the shuttle Atlantis, whose launch schedule could have been accelerated to February 10 
(from its original launch date of March 1) to rendezvous and rescue the crew. The other 
option would have been for two Columbia spacewalkers to repair the damaged wing 
with heavy tools and metal scraps scavenged from the crew compartment.
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) conducted interviews, shot foam 
pieces experimentally at test wing targets, and analyzed a large volume of data. Its final 

329
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
report pointed clearly to a NASA management failure, attributable to several named 
managers.
What were the principal modes of management failure deemed responsible for the 
shuttle Columbia disaster?
Answer 9.3
The Columbia shuttle disaster was the result of several factors (Langewiesche 2003):
	
1.	 Culture: NASA claims that it is a badgeless society, meaning that it does not mat-
ter what title of position and responsibility is on one’s name badge; everyone is 
equal when it comes to concern about shuttle safety. NASA has an open door 
and free communications policy.
	
	
The opposite was true, according to Langewiesche. He found that many 
NASA employees were afraid to speak up. In fact, Langewiesche claims in his 
article that many employees feared that their position in the organization pre-
determined how they themselves were viewed, as well as how their opinion 
was welcomed or accepted by the higher-ups. Many employees felt NASA’s 
leadership style to be coercive, not democratic.
	
2.	 Overconfidence and personal arrogance: The NASA managers had shown arro-
gance and insularity, while exhibiting a tough and domineering management 
style. Langewiesche says that the CAIB report singled out a specific NASA 
decision-maker as “intellectually arrogant and an abysmally failed manager.” 
Moreover, Langewiesche claims that the NASA managers demonstrated 
imperious and self-convinced attitudes, suffered from a lack of curiosity, and 
believed in themselves blindly. It is not difficult to see and understand that, as 
NASA had completed over 100 successful space flights, managers could blithely 
accept the notion that there would be no fatal risk upon the foam breaking off 
at lift-off. Previously, when lift-off had created similar mishaps, there were no 
serious repercussions.
	
	
Ultimately, it was conclusively substantiated by CAIB tests that the falling 
foam had punched a hole about 10 inches wide into the wing’s leading edge. 
This hole allowed the hot gases of reentry to enter the shuttle compartment 
and burn it from the inside. Unfortunately, there was no other past experi-
ence upon which the higher-ups could base their decisions, although they 
perhaps should have erred on the cautious side, rather than the less costly 
side.
	
3.	 Pressure to meet deadline: The NASA administrator set stringent performance 
goals related to the International Space Station Project. The strict deadline for 
completing the core, of which Columbia was a part, was February 19, 2004. As 
a consequence, organizational and bureaucratic concerns weighed heavily on 
the managers’ minds. 
A combination of the foregoing three factors led the key managers to stubbornly 
believe that the foam strike was insignificant, and also led them to forego the opportu-
nity to collect more data and hence fail to initiate emergency steps to save the crew. It 
was a colossal engineering management failure.
9.6.2  Emotional Intelligence
According to Goleman et al. (2013), all effective leaders have a high degree of emotional 
intelligence. There are five components of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-
regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Each of these components can be learned 
and enhanced by coaching, observation, training, and practice.

330
Engineering Management
Engineering managers are advised to nurture these components of emotional intelli-
gence so that they can lead effectually.
9.6.3  Inspirational Leadership Qualities
Leaders typically have vision, energy, authority, and strategic direction. However, leaders 
will not succeed if there are no followers. Followers are hard to find in these “empowered” 
times. Goffee and Jones (2006) point out that there are four specific qualities needed by 
leaders who want to be truly inspirational:
	
1.	Approachability and humanity: It is a human quality to show personal humility and 
vulnerability. Doing so will demonstrate authenticity, promote trust building, 
enhance solidarity, and foster collaboration. Acknowledging one’s own shortcom-
ings opens up opportunities for improvement. However, the authors advise that 
the weaknesses shown should be tangential flaws (such as hardworking habits) 
only and not fatal ones or character-related issues.
	
2.	Tact: The ability to know when and how to act based on intuition. Tact is a situa-
tion sensor that is capable of reading underlying currents, detecting subtle cues, 
and gauging unexpressed feelings. This quality is widespread among excellent 
business leaders. However, one needs to make sure that reality testing is done 
frequently with trustworthy friends or confidants, to avoid disasters due to one’s 
own inability to evaluate faulty situations.
	
3.	Tough empathy: This is the ability to establish a balance between respect for 
individuals and the task at hand, in order to impel leaders to take risks and 
to care about the people and the work they do. Leaders do well when they 
close the distance between themselves and their employees. Leaders must give 
employees what they need by helping, coaching, and participating in what 
they do.
	
4.	Uniqueness: The ability to maximize the benefits derivable from the leader’s own 
uniqueness (e.g., expertise, reputation, imagination, loyalty, dress style, physi-
cal appearance, handshake, and humor) and to use this separateness to motivate 
others to perform better.
Leaders need to be themselves, acquire more skills, and apply these four qualities to fit 
their own personality styles to successfully inspire others.
9.6.4  Leadership Attributes
Leaders are those who have special knowledge, are accessible, exhibit charisma (the natu-
ral ability to attract followers), and possess the authority to delegate. Table 9.3 contains a 
set of basic guidelines for engineering managers to lead.
Various research articles on leadership indicate that efficacious managers possess a set 
of common attributes. They have unquestionable character. Their creditability is high 
because of their technical skills, ethics, fairness, and moral standards. They master the 
functions of management, such as planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. They 
constantly perfect their skills in dealing with people, managing time, and controlling 
their own stress. They communicate effectually both in oral and written forms (Harrison 

331
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
and Mulhberg 2014). They have learned to listen well. They are full of energy and in 
good health. They are enthusiastic and positive about things and people. They are self-
motivated, flexible, and independent. They take actions to influence events. They take pru-
dent risks if needed (Tracy 2010). They have superior conceptual skills in reviewing data, 
solving problems, taking action, and planning strategically. They are both persistent and 
persuasive in achieving the goals they set out to achieve. Because of these attributes, they 
create good impressions and build confidence in others’ minds. Effective leaders attract 
those who are willing to follow them.
In fact, these attributes are not dissimilar to the profile of top executives commonly 
noted in the business literature (see Table 9.4).
Managers and leaders have different mental orientations. These mental orienta-
tions make leaders as important as managers in adding value to their organizations. 
Leadership talents are defined as having a natural predisposition for recurring pat-
terns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that can be applied productively. The Gallup 
Organization (www.gallup.com) has identified 20 key leadership talents by interview-
ing more than 40,000 leaders and top-tier managers over a period of 30 years (Fulmer 
and Wagner 1999). These 20 leadership talents are classified in the following four 
groups
TABLE 9.3
Basic Guideline for Managers to Lead
1
Prepare oneself (e.g., study the rules, policies, and objectives of your organization)
2
Understand all jobs under one’s direction
3
Be observant of things going on around oneself (e.g., managing by walking around)
4
Pay attention to details
5
Pose questions
6
Keep things in perspective (e.g., avoid being too close to the trees and unable to see the forest)
7
Be anticipatory of the future conditions.

It is obvious that a good leader must be a good manager, but a good manager may 
not be a good leader if he or she lacks some of the leadership talents indicated. In fact, 
all of them asymptotically converge into a finite set of common leadership attributes 
that all future engineering leaders should feel comfortable assimilating. Engineers 
who aspire to become leaders are encouraged to understand and display these attri-
butes so that, over time, the leadership talents and attributes will become second 
nature to them.
Example 9.4
Highly talented technical professionals may have academic training (advanced degrees), 
experience (company tenure), professional credentials (technical committee activities, 
awards, business connections), and accomplishments (patents, publications, completion 
of major projects) superior to the engineering manager. They could be difficult to man-
age. What are some of their characteristics and working habits? What strategies are 
effective in managing them?

333
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
Answer 9.4
Highly talented technical professionals tend to have the following work-related 
preferences:
	
1.	 They favor individual assignments with clearly recognizable responsibil-
ity. They do not prefer teamwork, wherein individual contributions may be 
crowded out.
	
2.	 They tend to strive for perfection, as they view the technological output as a 
reflection of themselves.
	
3.	 Technical professionals typically become easily frustrated by unexpected 
changes in program priority or resource allocation strategies for approved 
action steps deemed essential to achieve the program objectives.
	
4.	 They hate management jargon.
	
5.	 They find happiness in technical work, without being constrained by other 
nontechnical concerns or the involvement of low-skilled people.
	
6.	 They are readily turned off by administrative details, restrictive policies and 
guidelines, poor quality decisions based on questionable data and assump-
tions, excessive reporting requirements, and overly tight management control.
	
7.	 These workers assign high value to independence, self-motivation, self-
direction, and fairness.
	
8. They demonstrate a reserved attitude in social interactions.
Highly talented technical professionals may be managed by adopting the following 
strategies:
	
1.	 Decide on the objectives of technical programs or tasks, define the funding 
priority, understand the reasons for decisions, and secure the company’s 
commitment to the chosen programs.
	
2.	 Assign technology programs and tasks to specific individuals by clearly com-
municating the objectives, budget constraints, expected results, and other 
details. Suggest specific ways to measure outcome.
	
3.	 Solicit comments from the individual technical professionals involved regard-
ing project value, interest, readiness to perform tasks, and other issues that 
may have been of concern to them.
	
4.	 Invite the individual technical professionals to
 
a.	 Outline specific technical methods to accomplish the program or task at 
hand.
	
b.	 Produce an action plan and define budget requirements (accounting 
for man-hours, equipment, supplies, computation resources, outside 
resources, etc.).
	
c.	 Specify preliminary milestones of when interim results are to be reported 
out (monthly, biweekly, etc.).
	
d.	 Define deliverables.
	
5.	 Review and accept the plans. Authorize the individuals to commence programs 
and tasks.
	
6.	 Be available for any unexpected problems encountered by the individuals pur-
suing these assignments (e.g., practicing the concept of management by excep-
tion). Must be helpful and leave sufficient room for independent work by the 
individuals.
	
7.	 Acknowledge receipt of the final report after it is submitted. Read the report, 
review results with individuals, discuss lessons learned, and invite comments 
on any work extension needed or desired and on how to enhance the manage-
ment aspects of the program.

334
Engineering Management
	
8.	 Evaluate the work performed in terms of its expected value to the organization 
and offer feedback, including any responses from top management and other 
parties affected by the accomplished programs or tasks.
	
9.	 Praise the individuals appropriately whenever good work is done, by, for 
example, practicing the concept of motivation by positive reinforcement and 
recognition. Offer improvement suggestions if performance is to be improved.
	
10.	 Seek and arrange opportunities for the individuals to make prepared presen-
tations on technical programs and tasks during review meetings with upper 
management groups.
	
11.	 Document tasks and evaluations (including specific contributions made and 
their significance to the company) to be in a position to provide an instant 
report to upper management, if required, and to form a basis for the annual 
appraisals of the individuals involved.
9.7  Leadership Skills for the Twenty-First Century
The twenty-first century marketplace is characterized by a fast pace and stiff competition, 
low patience and compliance with authority, close relationships with customers, and a 
brisk speed to market. Rapid changes are expected due to global interactions, dynamic 
environments, technological advances, and population diversity. Jack Welch, a former 
CEO of General Electric, said, “When the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of 
change on the inside, the end is in sight” (Krames 2005). Business success in the twenty-
first century requires global connectivity, innovative discoveries centered on customer 
satisfaction, enhanced performance of people and technologies, alternative organizational 
frameworks, real-time responses, and enduring self-examination.
In the new century, leaders need a new set of skills to help exercise their leaderships. 
These skills include
	
1.	Leading with a strategic focus and vision. Advancing and articulating a value 
proposition that represents a proposed model to create value to companies’ 
stakeholders.
	
2.	Managing multiple points of view simultaneously, such as those from customers, 
suppliers, shareholders, and employees. Remaining flexible and adaptable in deal-
ing with technology, working with people, and forming business networks. Being 
capable of negotiating for solutions that are acceptable to parties involved.
	
3.	Keeping high-level goals in sight, while managing and tracking day-to-day 
success. Keeping the spirit of the enterprise alive.
	
4.	Fostering productive changes. The boiled frog syndrome is explained as follows: If 
you put a frog in a pan full of cold water and slowly turn up the heat, the frog will 
boil to death rather than jump out. If you drop a frog in a pan full of boiling water, 
however, it will jump out immediately. The moral of the story is that, if people do 
not sense a significant need to change, they may not get out of their comfort zones 
and change what they are doing. Usually, effective leaders are needed to convince 
people of the need to change.
	
5.	Being inspirational, technologically savvy, entrepreneurial, and devoted to 
customers’ needs.

335
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
	
6.	Investing in a business model that guides employees’ decision-making at all levels.
	
7.	Devising and maintaining transformational knowledge systems.
	
8.	Accessing relevant information rapidly in light of the explosion of available 
knowledge bases.
	
9.	Understanding how global business practices have evolved.
	 10.	Learning quickly while not relying on what is already known or understood.
Engineering managers need to have business savvy in order to lead in the twenty-
first century. The combination of technological know-how and business savvy is pow-
erful. The following guidelines may help engineering managers to acquire the needed 
business acumen: (1) Become well versed in the business issues faced by the company. 
This includes a thorough understanding of the corporate vision; the company’s priori-
ties, strengths, and weaknesses; the current market position; business processes; and 
engineering and technology factors driving shareholder value. In other words, con-
stantly sharpen one’s own business sense. (2) Know how to define proper metrics to 
measure a company’s financial and cost performance. These include income statements, 
balance sheets, fund flow statements, and various ratio analyses. (3) Recognize that 
technology is to be viewed as a tool to achieve business success. That is, technology can 
make a business become more profitable and productive. Delivering value to custom-
ers remains the key to achieving business success. (4) Be able to recommend suitable 
emerging technologies to enhance shareholder value and to mobilize resources (includ-
ing the engagement of networked partners) to turn these visionary goals into reality. 
(5) Be persistent in pursuing a vision, which is based on legacy and not on activity. 
Winston Churchill said, “The further backward you look, the further forward you can 
see” (Jackson 2004).
Example 9.5
Negotiating for agreements between employees, departments, suppliers, production 
partners, and networked distributors is part of a manager’s job. Explain the guidelines 
for conducting efficacious negotiations.
Answer 9.5
There are numerous excellent books on negotiations (Fisher et al. 2011; Thompson 2011). 
Next, a summary of the key guidelines is listed for effective negotiation:
	
1.	 Focus on the merits by attacking the underlying issues involved, not the 
opponent or their position.
	
2.	 Look for creative solutions with which both parties can win.
	
3.	 Prepare yourself well beforehand. The prenegotiation preparation centers on 
standards that suggest the best deal and available alternatives.
	
	
Sample questions related to preparation include: (1) How much are the 
other vendors selling that brass dish for? (2) What do your competitors charge 
for the service you are offering? (3) How much does a person with your experi-
ence get paid? (4) What is your best alternative to a negotiated agreement?
	
4.	 Raise questions to find out what your opponent really wants, and prepare 
clever arguments to support what you need.
	
	
The parable of the orange says that two parties each want an orange and agree 
finally to split it in half. But it turns out that one side simply wanted the juice 
and the other side wanted the rind. If only they had worked together to solve 

336
Engineering Management
the problem, each side could have gotten what it wanted. According to Walker 
(2003), situations similar to that in the parable of the orange pop up a lot.
	
	
Be prepared to ask questions pertaining to who, where, what, why, and how, 
as they tend to drive your opponent to disclose more information than the yes–
no questions (e.g., “How did you arrive at that figure?”). Posing questions to 
your opponent is also useful for fending off your opponent’s questions to you 
that you may not be prepared to answer. Table 9.5 presents some examples of 
such exchanges.
	
5.	 Listen intently, as the power rests with the listeners. Silence is one of the best 
weapons available to negotiators. Keeping silent will force the opponent to 
talk more and, as a consequence, to revise his or her position and reveal useful 
information in the process.
	
6.	 Make use of the principle of consistency (Long 2013). The principle of consistency 
is that people have the need to appear reasonable. This can be used skillfully 
to make your opponent feel that, to appear reasonable, he or she needs to use 
your standards that have been determined during your prenegotiation prepa-
rations. The more authoritative your standards seem, the better. An example 
of such a standard is the price charged for similar goods by the competitors of 
your opponent.
	
7.	 Let your opponent make the opening offer. Studies indicate that people often 
underestimate their own strengths and exaggerate those of their rivals.
	
8.	 Take a psychological test (e.g., the Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument) 
to understand your own style, be it competitor or collaborator. Taking such a test 
will help define any aspects of your negotiation style that should be fine-tuned.
	
9.	Be aware of some tactics employed by your opponents. Some may flinch 
at your proposals on purpose. Others, with the intent to mislead, may 
exaggerate things they do not really care about. At the close of negotia-
tion, some opponents may say something like, “Wow, you did a fantastic 
job negotiating that. You were brilliant.” Yet others may take advantage of 
the Columbo effect by lulling you into underestimating them and becoming 
overconfident.
	
10.	 Practice makes perfect. Effectual negotiation is 10% technique and 90% 
attitude. Attitude is affected by realism, intelligence, and self-respect.
9.8  Unique Contributions Expected of Engineering Managers
In what way is the technical background of a manager important to today’s executives? 
If an engineering manager does only what a typical nontechnical manager does, then the 
engineering manager does not earn his or her keep. Specifically, what can a technically

Engineers as Managers/Leaders
trained manager do that a nontechnical manager cannot? Technological intuition and 
innovation are the areas that engineering managers can and should excel at (Betz 2011; 
Tucker 2008).
How are innovation and creativity measured? A commonly accepted performance yard-
stick is counting the number of patents a company receives. More recently, a new measure 
was proposed to assess the relative value of patents. If a new patent application cites cer-
tain prior art patents as background on which the new patent is based, then the prior art 
patents are regarded as forward citations. The value of a patent is said to be directly pro-
portional to its number of forward citations, as more forward citations indicate a broader 
significance.
For the moment, let us stay with the patent number as a measure of innovation and cre-
ativity (Durham 2013). According to statistics published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office, only 6 U.S. companies were among the top 12 global companies receiving the most 
U.S. patents in 2014.
Engineering managers are capable of adding value to their employers in diverse ways. 
The following are additional broad-based contributions expected of engineering managers:
	
1.	Use of specific new technologies in product design—novel use of materials, parts, 
subassemblies, production technologies, and other components.
	
2.	Application of web-based technologies to e-transform the enterprise in order to 
achieve refinements in process efficiency, quality, speed, or customer satisfaction.
	
3.	Selection of enterprise integration tools for expediting business information col-
lection, transmission, and processing in order to realize speed, cost, and quality 
advantages.
	
4.	Alignment of networking partners to secure competitive advantages in supply 
chains, production systems, and customer service.
	
5.	Looking out for new technology-based tools that could facilitate serving cus-
tomers better, cheaper, and faster, with products that have a greater degree of 
customization.
	
6.	Employment of new technologies and innovations to add value to stakeholders 
other than customers (e.g., investors, employees, suppliers, and the communities 
in which the companies operate).
	
7.	Scanning literature to constantly learn the best practices of technology 
management in the industry.
Besides the aspect of relative competitiveness, the new era is full of challenges due to 
rapid advancement in technologies, internet-based communications techniques, and glo-
balization. The need for technological leadership is becoming increasingly pronounced 
(Hamel 2003). The areas in which engineering managers are expected to make significant 
contributions are discussed in the next sections.
9.8.1  Technologists as Gatekeepers
A gatekeeper’s primary job is to inspect and authorize the entry of people or materials into 
a gated organization. Technically capable people are usually entrusted with this important 
corporate activity to systematically scout, evaluate, and introduce new technologies for use 
by the enterprise (Maddock et al. 2011).

338
Engineering Management
Engineering managers are in the best position to mobilize capable technologists 
who understand the new or emerging technologies available in the marketplace and 
their relevant value to a company’s products, operations, and services. Capable STEM 
professionals can also bring in and selectively apply new technologies.
9.8.2  Technological Intuition
It is widely recognized in the literature that nontechnical managers do not have enough 
background to develop intuitions about which of the possible technologies now on the 
horizon are likely to advance further and which are likely to be discarded. Nontechnical 
managers cannot judge the merits of revolutionary changes in technology; this is known 
as a factor of ignorance. They have no choice but to procrastinate and wait for it to become 
clear which technology is the best; this is known as a factor of risk aversion. By the time the 
answer is clear, competitors may already have a two- to three-year lead in understanding 
and employing these new technologies. Thus, the nontechnical managers are not likely to 
exert excellent technological leadership.
This is also evident in diverse technical start-up companies, which, by the way, are 
typically headed by technically talented people. These talented entrepreneurs are able to 
invent new technology to serve as the basis for a new business. Eventually, some of these 
start-up companies might be acquired by big companies, which have the financial power 
to advance these technologies further.
Technological intuition is most needed in the strategic planning process conducted 
by a company. Hence, technologically talented managers have an important role to play 
here.
9.8.3  Technological Innovations
Another area of technological leadership expected of engineering managers is in the 
management of technological innovation (Kumar 2012; White and Wright 2003; Dundon 
2002). Technological innovation is the process by which technological ideas are gener-
ated, strengthened, and transformed into new products, processes, and services that are 
used to establish a marketplace advantage and foster company profitability. The following 
statistics were published by Pearce and Robinson (2012):
	
1.	Out of 58 initial product ideas, only 12 survive business analysis screening for 
compatibility with the company’s mission and long-term objectives. This step uses 
8% of the total development time.
	
2.	Only 7 of the 12 ideas remain after an evaluation of their potential. This step uses 
9% of the total development time.
	
3.	Three of the seven remaining ideas survive after development work is completed. 
This step uses 41% of the total development time.
	
4.	Only two of the original ideas remain past the pilot- and field-testing involved in 
the commercialization step, which uses 19% of the total development time.
	
5.	Eventually, only one idea results in a commercially successful product. This step 
uses 23% of the total development time.
Within the product development process (see Figure  9.3), the most time-consuming 
and resource-intensive steps involve development and testing. Engineering managers 

339
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
can make significant contributions to shorten development time and reduce costs while 
ensuring technical quality.
In heading up concurrent engineering teams in product development, engineering 
managers can excel by
•	 Asking pertinent technological questions
•	 Applying their interdisciplinary background to set technological priorities
•	 Incorporating new technologies to achieve competitive advantages and to satisfy 
customers’ needs
Exerting strong technological leadership is where technically trained managers must 
shine. This is the uniquely attractive niche for engineering managers. Engineers do not 
have serious competition from nontechnical majors here, as it is relatively easy for engi-
neers to learn how to manage, but not so easy for nontechnical managers to learn engineer-
ing. However, those engineering managers who cannot exercise technological leadership 
will be no better than nontechnical managers as far as the value added to their companies 
is concerned.
Innovation requires knowledge, ingenuity, and predisposition. Innovation cannot suc-
ceed without hard work. Purposeful work demands diligence, persistence, and commit-
ment. Innovations need to be built on the company’s strengths and core technologies. They 
should focus on opportunities that are temperamentally fit—that is, exciting and attractive 
to the innovators—inspiring them to do the required hard work. In addition, innovation 
must be market driven and focused on customers.
Engineering managers can benefit from taking a systematic approach to enhance 
individual innovation. Such an approach could include
	
1.	Analyzing innovative opportunities systematically, focusing on (a) the unex-
pected successes or failures of the company and its competitors, (b) incongruities 
in processes (production, distribution, and customer behavior), (c) process needs, 
(d) changes in industry and market structures, (e) changes in demographics, 
(f) changes in meaning and perception, and (g) new knowledge.
	
2.	Being observant (asking, looking, and listening). The types of questions to pose 
may include: (a) Which engineering processes or technologies from the past 
should be kept because they have future value? (b) What past engineering and

technological practices should be modified to be more relevant? (c) What activi-
ties should be eliminated because they have no future value? (d) What needs to be 
performed to ensure future success?
	
3.	Recognizing that innovations must be simple and focused, application-specific to 
the present marketplace, and pinpointed on satisfying a need and producing an 
end result useful to the customers. It is not wise to innovate for the distant future 
markets, which may or may not materialize.
	
4.	Starting small scale and aiming at producing a series of small, but useful incre-
mental values. Focusing on areas for which knowledge and expertise are available.
It is equally important for engineering managers to exercise leadership in fostering cor-
porate innovations. Managing group innovation is closely linked to managing group cre-
ativity. Implementing some well-established techniques, such as those enumerated in the 
following list, may enhance the creativity of groups.
	
1.	Brainstorming (for groups of 6–12 people): Many important corporate business or 
engineering issues may be cast in the form of problems. Examples of such issues 
include product design simplification, product or component cost reduction, and 
improvement of operations.
	
	
By using brainstorming techniques, the leader defines a specific problem and 
requests each participant in the group to take a turn proposing possible solu-
tions. No criticisms are allowed during these exchanges in order not to impede 
the free flow of ideas. After all of the ideas are generated and recorded, the group 
then carefully evaluates each solution and jointly defines the best solution to the 
problem at hand.
	
	
As elucidated in Chapter 100, a new thinking methodology, DeepThink, suggests 
to engage teams, comprising of members with diversified background and expe-
rience, to exhaustively apply questions as prompts, in order to think deeper and 
generate ideas of increasing novelty in a multiple-round brainstorming environ-
ment. Initial outcomes of applying DeepThink have been positive.
	
2.	Nominal group technique (small groups): The leader defines a specific problem. Each 
member is encouraged to generate as many written solutions as possible during 
the group meeting. Each member is then invited to present his or her solution and 
to elucidate the relevant rationale behind the proposed solution. No criticism is 
allowed.
	
	
After all of the proposed solutions are presented and recorded, each solu-
tion is thoroughly discussed, evaluated, and criticized. The participants are then 
requested to anonymously rank all of the solutions in writing. The final results are 
presented to management for action.
	
3.	Delphi technique (for identifying future trends): The leader defines a specific problem 
and a set of questions and sends them to a panel of geographically dispersed 
domain experts who do not have contact with one another. Each expert then 
answers the questions individually and anonymously. A summary of all of the 
answers is documented by the leader and sent back to the experts. By review-
ing the comments and the possible criticisms, the experts, again anonymously, 
modify their original answers. No one knows who proposed or criticized what 
specific solutions. The focus is on the merits of the ideas, not on the personality of 

341
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
those who advanced the ideas. The leader again prepares a summary and returns 
it to the experts, offering additional explanations and justifications. In the end, 
every solution is justified. Each time the experts respond to a summary, it is called 
a wave. After the third wave, a summary is prepared and the leader makes a fore-
cast. This method is time-consuming, but it is particularly useful for predicting 
the future course that a company may take in technology and business.
Engineering managers ought to be well versed in many of these techniques to manage 
and promote creativity and innovation from both individuals and groups.
9.9  Career Strategies for the Twenty-First Century
Today’s leaders adopt specific guidelines in managing their own careers (Wanjumbi 2015; 
Green 2013). Among many such guidelines published in the literature on career manage-
ment, the eight specific guidelines offered by Kacena (2002) are particularly comprehen-
sive and insightful (see Table 9.6). Fernandez (1999) offers a slightly different set of career 
strategies (see Table 9.7).
A set of new career strategies was recently offered to STEM professionals by Chang 
(2016). They include
	
1.	Join the promotable ranks (prepare to be ready)
	
2.	Acquire T-shaped competences (acquire a broad-based background and work 
experience)
	
3.	Network to become visible to decision-makers and gain support of key people 
(manage own brand)
TABLE 9.6
Eight Specific Guidelines
1
Think, speak, act, and walk like an entrepreneur. Adopt an entrepreneurial mind-set, as if your own 
investment is involved. Accept the notion that jobs exist so that problems can be solved.
2
Make chaos a friend. Embrace change as an opportunity for growth. The mantra for today’s career 
advancement is “eager to stay, yet ready to leave.”
3
Don’t be afraid to break the rules. Attempt to be a visionary, as innovation is possible only in cultures 
that tolerate mistakes. Be detail oriented.
4
Know your own strengths and weaknesses. Set high standards for yourself and affiliates. Be very 
competitive. Market yourself. Express commitment, passion, and excitement about your own work.
5
Be nonlinear. Radical career shifts will become commonplace. Companies are ignoring specialization 
in favor of adaptability, cross-functionality, people skills, and a rock-solid customer focus. Follow the 
new paradigm that anyone who does not know how to do something must learn or partner with 
someone who does know.
6
Maintain balance. Set your own priorities with respect to health, family, and business—in that 
order—and have fun. “Earn a living, make a life.”
7
Stay connected. Building alliances by networking is essential. Establish reciprocal relationships with 
colleagues, clients, customers, and competitors. Seek to be helpful and supportive so that they 
become resources for ideas, skills, and knowledge.
8
Always keep your options open. Keep abreast of the market, nurture skills that are marketable, stay 
professionally active, and avoid becoming complacent.

342
Engineering Management
	
4.	Obtain requisite skills for the next level of promotion and beyond (know what is 
needed)
	
5.	Avoid career errors (learn from others’ mistakes)
	
6.	Practice global leadership skills (be proficient in specific leadership skills)
	
7.	Innovate to derive strategic differentiation and operational excellence (focus on 
value creation)
Engineering managers are advised to refine their own career strategies constantly by 
using the aforementioned inputs as general guidelines.
9.10  Take-Charge Formula
It is generally recommended that everyone must strive to become exceptional and to take 
charge of underutilized potential:
T: Time should be taken to reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, as well as to do 
something about the weaknesses.
A: Attitude must be fostered and modified as needed.
K: Knowledge must be updated to keep yourself marketable.
E: Empathy and consideration in caring for others’ feelings should be strived for.
C: Communication must be constantly improved and perfected.
H: Health and humor must be diligently nurtured.
A: Appearance must be properly maintained.
R: Respect yourself and others and live one day at a time—enjoy life; why simply wait?
G: Goals should be set for yourself and your family by, for example, creating a five-
year plan.
E: Empower the possibilities by finding ways to delegate, assist, entrust, and praise 
others, and by being generous and giving.
TABLE 9.7
Fernandex Guidelines
1
Balance your priorities between your job, personal interests, family, and the community. This is the key 
to having a full and meaningful life.
2
Cultivate a broad business background through education, diversified work experience, and success 
skills. Ranked most important among success skills are integrity and persistence. Persistence means 
unwillingness to accept defeat.
3
Learn leadership from proven leaders. Observe successful people and learn from their behavior.
4
Learn what the company and industry are really about. Understand the company values, aspirations, 
brand character, market position, organizational structure and culture, and qualities of people.
5
Make an impact. Strive to contribute from the basis of knowledge and attitude. Ask how the world 
would be different and just a bit better because of your efforts.

9.11 Conclusion
Many “rules of thumb” are derived from experience. They are common sense heuristics 
that are all reasonable and intuitively correct.
Knowing what is needed to become (a) an effective engineer, (b) a good engineering 
manager, or (c) an excellent engineering leader is a very good start. The next step is to 
learn the skills and capabilities to shape one’s own attitudes, and to acquire the attributes 
needed to become an effectual engineer, good engineering manager, or excellent engineer-
ing leader. The third step is to lead and contribute in creating competitive advantages in 
strategic differentiations and operational excellence for the enterprise.
To be successful, one must practice, practice, and practice until the preferred behavior 
becomes second nature.

Appendices
Appendix 9.A: Ten Factors for Survival and Success in 
Industry (Alexander and Watson 2013)
To be successful in corporate America, one needs to pay attention to the following common 
sense success factors:
	
1.	Excellent performance: Make sure that all assignments are performed well, as “You 
are only as good as your last performance.” Pay attention to ensure that both 
the performance and its impact are properly recorded and made known to the 
people in the organization who might affect your career growth. Self-promote as 
needed.
	
2.	Personality: Project a mature, easy to work with, positive, reasonable, and flexible 
personality. How one acts and behaves is important.
	
3.	Communication skills: Of all aspects of communication, the written form is the most 
difficult to master. Check the writing advice offered by Hick (2013), with respect 
to readability, correctness, appropriateness, and thought. Consult the book by 
Strunk (2015), with respect to style.
	
4.	Technical skills and ability: Keep your individual capabilities (e.g., analysis, design, 
integration, product development, and software tools application) current and 
marketable.
	
5.	Human relations skills: Constantly review ways of interacting with people and 
make sure that you are creating and maintaining acceptable working relation-
ships. Avoid being labeled as “not able to work well with other people.”
	
6.	Significant work experience and assignments: Seek diversified business and engineer-
ing exposure and high-impact assignments to build up your experience portfolio. 
Doing so will increase your ability to add value to the organization.
	
7.	Self-control: Improve your ability to stay cool and withstand pressure and stress 
by, for example, taking courses in leadership training. According to a CNN News 
report in 2001, a British military training camp was offering training services 
to business executives, subjecting the executives to a high-pressure artificial 
military environment to toughen them up for handling the real-world business 
environment.
	
8.	Personal appearance: Follow the example of superiors to fit yourself into the 
corporate image. Dress for success.

345
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
	
9. Ability to make tough business decisions: Take careful risks when needed. Anyone can 
make the easy plays, but only great people make the tough plays.
	 10.	Health and energy level: Take care of your health and maintain a high level of 
physical vitality.
Appendix 9.B: Seven Most Common Reasons for Career Failures
Some engineers fail in their careers for one reason or another. Listed next are seven 
common reasons for career failure; these are relevant to technologists as well as managers.
	
1.	Poor interpersonal skills: A lack of interpersonal skills is the single biggest reason for 
career failure. Few people are fired or asked to resign due to deficiencies in their 
technical capabilities. As a measure of social intelligence, interpersonal skills are 
important to achieve success in any organization. One needs to be sensitive to 
the feelings of others, able to listen and understand the subtext in communica-
tion, give and take criticism well, strive to build team support, and be emotionally 
stable.
	
2.	Wrong fit: From time to time, a person may find it hard to adapt his or her abili-
ties, styles, personalities, and values to the culture and business practices of the 
workplace. The workplace may assume a cultural norm that is unfamiliar to some 
individuals. It is well known that rigidly layered corporations operate differently 
from dynamic partnerships or entrepreneurial start-ups. The individual’s core 
value system, with priorities, profit motives, and social or environmental prefer-
ences may not be fully compatible with those of his or her coworkers on the job. In 
addition, the chemistry among coworkers within a unit, department, or company 
could also be a source of conflict. Often, the management style of the superior is 
difficult for the individual to adapt to. In cases of such a wrong fit, the best strategy 
for the individual is to move on.
	
3.	Unable to take risks: Lack of risk-taking abilities is a major stumbling block to the 
advancement of one’s career. For fear of failure, some engineers stay in their cur-
rent positions for too long and are not willing to accept promotions that require 
relocation within the company or to venture out for new positions outside of the 
company.
	
	
Others feel comfortable with the technical work they do because they are 
able to control all of the key components of their work (e.g., data, facts, analy-
sis, procedure, and equipment) and the quality of its outcome. Naturally, some 
of them may feel uneasy when requested to take on managerial responsibili-
ties that involve (1) people who may react differently, (2) data that are often 
incomplete and inaccurate, (3) objectives that are usually multifaceted, and 
(4) decision-making tasks primarily based on personal intuition and judg-
ment. The inability to take calculated risks could lead to failure in one’s career 
progression.
	
4.	Bad luck: Sometimes, engineers get hurt by business circumstances that are beyond 
their control or expectations (e.g., mergers and acquisitions, corporate downsizing, 
change of market conditions, change of business strategies, and advancement of 
technologies). Career disruptions due to bad luck can happen to anyone. However, 
one should be able to recover quickly if one’s record demonstrates that past 

346
Engineering Management
achievements consistently created value to employers, and such value-creation 
capabilities are widely marketable.
	
5.	Self-destructive behavior: Certain engineers exhibit work habits or behavior patterns 
that are self-destructive. Examples of self-destructive behavior include working in 
secret, resistance to change, being excessively aggressive, having an uncooperative 
attitude, picking fights with people, becoming overly argumentative, being read-
ily excitable about trivialities, and displaying a lack of perspective. Such behavior 
is clearly unwanted in any group environment.
	
6.	Lack of focus: Some engineers pride themselves on being a “jack-of-all-trades”, get-
ting busily involved in almost everything, but being good at nothing. Failing to 
focus on creating value to the employer is detrimental to one’s own career.
	
7.	Workplace biases: Under ideal conditions, all workplaces should be free of biases 
with respect to race, gender, age, national origin, religious beliefs, and other indi-
vidual qualities. In reality, some workplaces are managed more effectively and 
progressively than others. Individual workers need to monitor the real situation 
at hand and take proactive steps to avoid being hurt by such biases. Engineers 
serve themselves well by constantly checking against these bias-based failures 
and proactively managing those over which they can exercise some control.
Appendix 9.C: Tips on Coping for First-Time Supervisors and Managers
It typically takes two to three years for a first-time supervisor or manager to become 
fully effectual. Here are a few tips that can help the novice to cope during this initially 
challenging period:
	
1.	Organize the office so that important files and project folders can be located 
readily.
	
2.	Get a good perspective from one’s superior in terms of priorities, strategic plans, 
previous problems, and vision to operate the unit or department. Do the homework 
to learn the new languages: finance, marketing, manufacturing, and customer ser-
vice. Acquire the business perspectives of markets, cost-price position, product 
distribution, supply-chain management, enterprise integration application, and 
customer relation management.
	
3.	Obtain training in evaluating staff performance, managing time, and developing 
multidisciplinary teams.
	
4.	Ready self mentally to assign responsibilities while maintaining control in order 
to achieve results through people.
	
5.	Communicate own expectations to staff, both individually and in groups, and 
solicit feedback.
	
6.	Foster relationships with peer managers in other departments.
	
7.	Build the relationship with own superior.
	
8.	Start practicing and polishing your own management styles in order to become 
increasingly effective. 
Humphrey and Stokes (1999) offer another set of nine identifiable people, technical, and 
administrative skills for frontline supervisors in the new century:

347
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
•	 People skills
 
1.	 Communication—ability to adjust own style to correspond with individuals’ 
needs, and an ability to listen to other people
	
2.	 Teamwork—ability to take into account the diversity of other people’s 
backgrounds
	
3.	 Coaching skills—ability to assist other people
•	 Technical skills
 
4.	 Business skills—ability to assess business performance of others
	
5.	 Continuous improvement—ability to constantly update and refine one’s own 
technical skills
	
6.	 Technologically savvy—ability to use modern office equipment
•	 Administrative skills
 
7.	 Project management skills—ability to plan and implement new ideas
	
8.	 Writing and documentation skills—ability to write reports and keep manage-
ment informed
	
9.	 Resource management skills—ability to network with those who control 
resources
Over time, first-time supervisors and managers need to demonstrate the ability to build 
team spirit, create a work environment that fosters self-motivation, solve people and tech-
nical problems, and make decisions by integrating technical issues with business issues 
affecting the company.
Appendix 9.D: How to Manage One’s Own Superiors
Both engineers and engineering managers need to properly manage their respective supe-
riors. The superior needs the active support of all employees to succeed, as most of the 
work is done by the subordinates. On the other hand, all of the subordinates need their 
superiors’ support to move forward along their individual career paths.
The power of a superior should be taken seriously. One of the primary reasons for job 
turnover is personality conflict with the individual’s own superior, not because of technical 
performance.
It is also of critical importance that one understands the corporate mind-set. Whenever 
the organization appoints a group leader or manager, the following unwritten rules 
apply:
	
1.	The organization knows that no one is perfect and that the appointee is no 
exception.
	
2.	The appointee’s strengths are valued more than the trouble caused by his or her 
weaknesses. Even if the appointee appears to be difficult for some subordinates to 
deal with, the organization counts on him or her to lead the group and add value. 
Unless the appointee clearly violates the stated rules, the organization will back 
the appointee most of the time.
	
3.	To achieve the goals of the organization, the organization trusts the views and 
desires of the appointee over those of his or her subordinates.

348
Engineering Management
The organization also expects employees to behave in certain ways. These include being 
attuned to the superior and not insisting that the superior adjust to the employees. Work 
closely to support the superior and help him or her to succeed. Avoid questioning the 
superior’s judgment and decisions, as the superior typically has access to more and bet-
ter information and data than the employees and may not be in a position to share such 
information or data freely.
In readying oneself to manage superiors effectively, it is useful for employees to form 
the following habits:
	
1.	Understand the business and personal pressure your superior is under, his or her 
values and motivators (achievement, success, recognition, money, value systems, 
priorities, principles, and other factors), work style (peacekeeper, conflict lover, 
riser or setter, channel oriented), and personal style (optimistic, fighter).
	
2.	Expect modest help, and request it only when you really need it. It is better to get 
help from your own networked coworkers and friends.
	
3.	Be sensitive to your superior’s work habits. Watch how he or she receives data 
and information and works on it. Learn his or her preferred mode of communica-
tions—face to face, phone, e-mails, or staff meetings, for instance.
	
4.	Stay in touch with your superior, unless he or she does not want to be bothered 
regularly.
	
5.	Present materials clearly and without complex details and jargon.
	
a.	 Emphasize the significance (the benefits and realizable impact) of your techni-
cal work to the group or company, not its technological complexity, sophistica-
tion, or elegance.
	
b.	 Use concise language to elucidate ideas and recommendations clearly.
	
6.	Do not defend a cause unless it deserves it. Keep it in perspective. Do not complain 
when you do not get all that you asked for.
	
7.	Exercise self-control. Manage your own overreactions or counterproductive 
behavior.
The following set of guidelines for managing the superior–subordinate relationship is 
recommended (Goleman (1998):
	
1.	Accept that your superior’s support is important to you. Understand how important 
your support is to your superior.
	
2.	Understand your own response to your superior’s style and personality, and 
manage it. Respect the style and orientation of your superior to his or her work. 
Understand your response to your position in the hierarchy and how you feel 
about working within a structure.
	
3.	Learn to take feedback objectively, not personally, and maintain your sense of self 
and your own uniqueness.
	
4.	Push back when necessary, but only for business reasons and to maintain personal 
integrity; do not push for political gain or to embarrass your superior.
	
5.	Learn your superior’s goals, aspirations, frustrations, and weaknesses. Study and 
understand what your superior thinks is important. Study and be able to emulate 
your superior’s communications style, for the sake of being heard.

349
Engineers as Managers/Leaders
	
6.	Be dependable; follow through on serious requests for information and work 
output.
	
7.	Display respect to others and expect respect from others in all matters of busi-
ness and on-the-job interpersonal interactions regarding time, resources, and 
alternative work styles.
	
8.	Be honest and share all relevant data about the situations and concerns at hand.
	
9.	Keep private any criticism and conflict that may arise between the two of you, and 
always work for a jointly satisfactory solution.
	 10.	Be manageable by and available to those beneath you.

Creativity and Innovation
10.1  Introduction
Innovation is defined as the act of coming up with something new that adds value to 
customers and companies alike. Innovations are of tremendous importance to all 
product/service companies that are constantly in competition for customers and market 
share. In the absence of innovations, companies will soon lose their relative corporate com-
petitiveness and profitability in today’s highly dynamic business environment (Dawson 
and Andriopoulos 2014).
Innovations require creative ideas. Some but not all creative ideas will lead to inno-
vations. Because creativity precedes innovations, it is important to review various ways 
in which creative ideas may be effectively generated. Certain thinking strategies may be 
especially useful in engaging the creative minds of all science, technology, engineering, 
and math (STEM) professionals to enable them to think creatively.
A new brainstorming concept, DeepThink, is introduced, in which question-based 
prompts are applied to induce thinking at a deep level to facilitate the generation of novel 
ideas. Its operation in virtual teams with anonymity and structured interactions (VTASI) 
is elucidated.
In this chapter, we also discuss first creativity and creative thinking strategies, and then 
address the fundamentals of innovation, including value chain, processes, and the keys to 
high-impact innovations. Established practices of developing innovations are then elabo-
rated, including organizational settings, business dimensions, best practices, and some 
additional guidelines. These discussions will then be followed by selected innovation 
examples in various industries. Finally, conclusions are offered.
10.2  Creativity and Creative Thinking Strategies
Creativity and innovation confer business advantages and they are important to any enter-
prise facing a plethora of competition. Creativity focuses on the generation of new ideas, 
regardless of how useful these new ideas might be in the short or long term. Innovation, 
on the other hand, centers on adding value to enterprises by implementing and marketing 
selected new product/service ideas. The extent of creativity is measured by the number of 
new ideas generated, whereas the extent of innovation is judged by the practical value it 
brings about. Not all novel ideas lead to adding value. Great ideas with poor implementa-
tion will bring forth outcomes of no or only minor significance. Innovation is recognized 

354
Engineering Management
to be the foundation of sustainable competitiveness and profitability. Its importance is well 
recognized in the business world (Vogel 2014).
Creativity comes from workers such as scientists, engineers, architects, designers, edu-
cators, artists, musicians, and entertainers, who devise new ideas, new technologies, new 
contents, and/or new business models. Some individuals are more creative than others in 
generating new ideas. Nikola Tesla said: “There’s no thrill that can go through the human 
heart like that felt by the inventor who sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success.”
There are certain prerequisites for individuals to become creative. They need to have 
curious and inquisitive minds, handle ambiguity and uncertainties well, and be highly 
motivated to act. Training can cultivate the methodologies with which new ideas are gen-
erated. Training is also helpful to minimize the constraining effects of past experience and 
procedure known to inhibit “out of the box” thinking, thus improving their propensity in 
coming up with new ideas.
Literature research indicates that in general an individual needs about 10 years of incu-
bation time to amass sufficient knowledge to become creative. Even with sufficient knowl-
edge at their fingertips, many individuals do not become creative overnight. Creativity has 
always been regarded as a desirable but difficult capability to possess.
In many progressive organizations, leaders ask constantly: “How can we up the inven-
tive thought?” For pursuing creativity and innovations, workers go through a creative 
process. This process is usually initiated by some stimuli, which prompt the individuals to 
look for new ideas beyond the conventional. Individuals then apply these new ideas to data 
they have available in order to gain information, which in turn produces knowledge. The 
newly gained knowledge leads to wisdom, which, when applied properly, delivers inno-
vative outcomes. The innovative outcomes benefit society at large. Figure 10.1 illustrates

this process schematically. Specifically, this creative process consists of six steps as follows 
(Chang 2008a):
	
1.	Excite the inquisitive and curious mind with stimuli.
	
2.	Nurture different thinking strategies to produce new ideas beyond the 
conventional.
	
3.	Gain new information and perspectives by evaluating data with new ideas.
	
4.	Apply insights and interpretations to glean new knowledge from information.
	
5.	Grow new wisdom from processing and distilling new knowledge.
	
6.	Empower new wisdom to procreate creative and innovative outcomes.
The first letters of these steps constitute the mnemonic of “ENGAGE.” An alternative 
way of describing these strategies may be as follows:
	
1.	Explore metaphors and analogies
	
2.	Notice lessons from failures and mistakes
	
3.	Garner divergent perspectives
	
4.	Adopt idea combinations
	
5.	Go after intellectual prompts
	
6.	Envision relationships graphically
Creativity precedes innovation, which in turn builds corporate competitiveness and 
sustains enterprise profitability. The six-step engage model delineates the creative pro-
cess leading to innovations and the specific thinking strategies deemed useful in pro-
moting the generation of new creative ideas. The central tenet of this model is that 
individuals need to leave no stone unturned in the quest to generate new ideas and then 
to converge on a selected few to shape the innovative outcomes. The combinations of 
these six thinking strategies may lead to a bubbling of new creative ideas. This engage 
model could be practically implemented by the DeepThink methodology described in 
the next section.
It is believed that by aggressively following the above-described model, both in univer-
sity education and professional development environments, individuals would be able to 
become creative and innovative sooner, allowing them to make better contributions to 
their professions, to their enterprises, and to society at large.
10.3  Generation of New Products/Services Ideas 
by the DeepThink Methodology
Creativity refers to the generation of novel ideas, some of which may become market-
able innovations. The generation of creative ideas precedes the development of product/
service innovation. “Innovation is the embodiment, combination and/or synthesis of 
knowledge in novel, relevant, valued new products, processes or services,” as suggested 
by Leonard (2011).

356
Engineering Management
Creative product/service ideas may be traditionally generated by the in-house tal-
ents of an enterprise. Enterprises that pursue such an idea generation process in-house 
are known to enjoy the benefits of complete control and ownership. Creative service 
ideas may also be generated by an open service innovation strategy (see Chesbrough 
2011), which involves customers, supply chain partners, and domain experts on the 
outside.
In this section, we will introduce a specific methodology to invent new ideas involving 
the use of virtual teams, which may comprise of primarily company-internal people or 
selective members from company-external sources or both.
10.3.1  Background
It is well known from the literature that the personal background knowledge and thought 
process due to prior training and work experience influence the way each STEM profes-
sional will think when challenged by an external problem or issue. The outputs are usu-
ally somewhat predictable (see Figure 10.2).
In order for such an individual to think “out of the box,” the use of external stimuli 
(e.g., question-based prompts) maybe useful, as shown by New Solutions #1 to #4 in 
Figure 10.3. The concept illustrated in Figure 10.3 is based on the assumption that STEM 
professionals may modify the way they think upon receiving external stimuli, and may 
thus come up with new solutions. As their minds are being disturbed, they could engage 
in more free association, thus possibly leading to more creative ideas. By implementing 
this concept repeatedly, an iterative process involving groups of participants may be 
devised to facilitate the generation of new product/service ideas. Figure 10.4 illustrates 
this process.
Specifically, when an individual STEM professional receives a set of question-based 
prompts, he or she will offer the expected conventional solutions, as defined by his or her 
prior training and work experience, as well as some possible new solutions induced by 
these external prompts. In a group setting, all these outputs are to be collected, screened, 
and evaluated. This process is illustrated by the selection lens in Figure 10.4. By eliminat-
ing various solutions that are commonplace or nonnovel or both, the residual solutions 
will become “better” ideas that could serve as the initial starting ideas for the next itera-
tive round of idea generation. Individual professionals in the team reflect on this new set 
of “better” ideas and process them while being prompted by additional question-based 
external prompts. The process continues to yield an improved new set of “better” ideas.

Creativity and Innovation
This process stops when a sufficient number of “better” ideas have been generated. The 
final output of the team will be a set of novel ideas, which are brought into being by this 
multiple-round process.
This team process may be applied in parallel involving several separate teams that 
address the same problem or opportunity. It may also be applied in a series in that, ideas 
from previous teams are introduced as initial inputs to the current teams.

10.3.2  Question-Based Prompts
The abovementioned question-based prompts play a central role in this multiple-round 
idea generation process. Chang (2014) has compiled a set of DeepThink prompts at the 
University at Buffalo. They are delineated as follows (see additional details of specific 
question-based prompts included in Appendix 10.A):
	
1.	Delve: To delve is to dip deeper down to the components and subcomponents lev-
els of an idea/concept in order to exploit the interfaces therebetween, and the roles 
and value contributed by these parts.
	
2.	Envision: To envision is to think divergently and to project an idea forward into the 
future.
	
3.	Exchange: To exchange is to replace or swap components in order to add value.
	
4.	Perturb: To perturb is to seek novelty refinement by slightly modifying the con-
cept’s attributes and features. Raise “what-if” questions.
	
5.	Transpose: To transpose is to invoke lateral thinking by looking at the same concept 
or issue from several different perspectives.
	
6.	Harness: To harness is to discover and redeploy the wisdom contained in other 
ideas for new circumstances.
	
7.	Integrate: To integrate is to combine ideas and concepts in different contexts to 
form new ones.
	
8.	Nurture: To nurture is to modify and adjust separate and unrelated concepts/ideas 
to form something new.
	
9.	Knock: To knock is to knock down limitations, negative driving forces, assump-
tions, and conventional wisdom, which may have inadvertently constrained the 
value of the concept.
The first letters of these nine thinking strategies constitute the mnemonic “DeepThink,” 
and hence the name. They form a set of thinking strategies, which are expected to be 
generically applicable to the production of novel ideas in different fields (see Figure 10.5).
Not all of these nine thinking strategies will apply to each and every issue, problem, or 
opportunity we encounter. If a given sample question does not appear to be relevant to a 
given issue, participants are advised to just skip that question and continue with the next. 
Most productive participants are those with free spirits, being curious and risk taking, and 
are proficient in inductive thinking. Producing inventive ideas of the “blow-the-roof-off” 
type would require all the mental and physical reserves the team could summon.
The DeepThink prompts are designed to promote the creation of novel ideas. For an idea 
to be patentable, being novel is just one of four requirements. The other three requirements 
are (1) being of a subject matter that is eligible for patent protection, (2) being nonobvious 
to people skilled in the art, and (3) being useful. Any invention is novel if it has not been 
known, used, or disclosed by others before the date of invention. It may not be simple 
improvement ideas, which would be obvious to someone skilled in the arts. The patent-
ability requirements vary somewhat from one country to another. The patentability issue 
should be addressed during the innovation development process.
Not all novel ideas are marketable. However, ideas that are marketable but not novel 
do not provide a long-term sustainable advantage to the enterprise, as such ideas can be 
readily copied by competitors. It is also advisable that the primary emphasis of generating 

359
Creativity and Innovation
creative ideas be placed on the core product/service elements, involving (1) knowledge and 
insights (e.g., currency, uniqueness, and access), (2) newness and significance of benefits 
realizable to the intended users, and (3) technological means to enable the consumption of 
the product/service. Thus, the thrust of employing the DeepThink prompts should be to 
identify novel ideas, and to seek increasingly higher levels of their novelty.
The core element of a product/service idea that offers complex value propositions could 
be composed of a group of subelements, some of which should be novel in some ways. If 
possible, the availability of these subelements may be secured through proper licensing 
arrangements with outside inventors.
Appendix  10.B lists a number of illustrative novel ideas that could be generated in 
response to some of the question-based prompts contained in the DeepThink methodolo-
gies. As the saying goes: “Never doubt the power of examples,” a careful review of these 
illustrative examples could enable the readers to better appreciate the practical utility of 
these question-based prompts.
10.3.3  Organize VTASI Teams to Bring Forth Creative Ideas
Teams are one of the most widely utilized organizational forms of creativity pursuits, as 
participants of diversified background could be easily assembled to promote mental cross-
fertilization between different disciplines and innovation by exaptation. As summarized 
by Chang (2011a), there are three types of teams: (1) standard teams in which participants 
meet face to face, (2) virtual teams in which participants interact remotely, and (3) virtual 
teams in which participants interact remotely while remaining anonymous to one another. 
Each of these teams possesses advantages and disadvantages.
It is proposed that the way to effectively utilize the above-described DeepThink method-
ologies in a group environment is to utilize the third type, the VTASI team. Participants on 
the VTASI team need to possess the right qualifications and domain knowledge.
A team leader should be appointed, who will specify the project objective. As Charles 
Kettering said: “A problem well stated is a problem half-solved.” He or she will further 
exercise the leadership role of managing the team, preparing the team members with

required communication technologies, securing the essential supports, explaining the use 
of DeepThink methodologies as question-based prompts, and ensuring that all members 
understand and accept the team objective to create novel and potentially patentable ideas 
that could form the basis of new product/service offerings The team leader is expected to 
have the mettle to accomplish these tasks.
The team leader would then initiate a first-round deliberation via e-mails, while advis-
ing all team members to utilize some of listed question-based prompts. His or her personal 
dedication toward this team effort inculcates a sense of responsibility and urgency among 
the team members. He or she would collect all electronic outputs from the team members, 
prune the results by eliminating redundancies, post questions to further induce creative 
ideas, acknowledge excellent outputs of specific individuals, offer constructive comments 
and feedback to guide the team toward certain potentially more fruitful areas to pursue, 
and recycle the residual ideas back to the team. The purpose is to enable the team to delve 
deeper in the subsequent rounds.
The pruning process is primarily for zeroing in on relatively novel and potentially pat-
entable ideas, from the perspectives of technology, application, and/or utilization of assets. 
The final set of team output are ranked ordered by a vote of all participants. This multiple 
round of iterations is described in Figure 10.4.
10.3.4  Advantages of Engaging VTASI Teams to Generate New Ideas
There are a number of advantages associated with the use of VTASI teams. In such a team, 
every participant may express his or her own ideas freely and uninhibited. It is known 
from Kohn and Smith (2010) that individual brainstorming may be better in generating a 
lot of new ideas than using face-to-face group-based brainstorming settings, because of 
the shortcoming of “collaborative fixation,” the tendency that people’s thinking patterns 
are influenced by ideas presented by others, thus possible channeling to an eventual con-
formity of ideas. Indeed, generating a lot of ideas is very useful, as Thomas Edison said: 
“To have a great idea, have a lot of them.” The interactions between the participants are 
then ensured by reading the summary reports, in which all relatively novel ideas are cat-
egorized without disclosing the identity of their individual authors. From the ideas listed, 
participants will recognize the relative merits, the viewpoints they express, thus enabling 
them to react or respond in the subsequent rounds of interactions. These interactions will 
be in the form of building on others’ ideas, combining ideas already in existence, introduc-
ing new ideas by analogy, or modifying some of their idea-building elements. The next 
critical step is thinking, according to Albert Einstein who said: “Discovery consists of see-
ing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought.” The components 
of individual creativity are identified by Ness (2012) to be motivation, creative thinking 
skills, and expertise. In VTASI teams, these critical thinking skills are promoted via the 
DeepThink methodologies presented before.
Other advantages of VTASI teams include the following: (1) the team avoids the known 
shortcomings of face-to-face meetings, such as social loafing, evaluation apprehension, 
production inhibition, and dominance; (2) they can be readily implemented on a global 
scale, speedily and cost-effectively, involving experienced participants with diversified 
backgrounds residing anywhere; (3) participants are engaged only on a part-time basis 
and for a very short period of time, thus permitting all of them to continue pursuing their 
respective full-time work assignments; (4) the team can be rapidly assembled and dis-
banded, permitting its deployment in a rather agile and cost-effective manner; (5) VTASI 
teams may serve as a screening tool for a product/service enterprise to identify creative 

361
Creativity and Innovation
professionals, who can then be engaged to form increasingly creative teams in the future; 
(6) VTASI teams may be deployed in series, in which the novel outputs of some teams are 
used as initial inputs to subsequent teams, in order to procreate deeper and increasingly 
novel ideas for the project at hand; (7) companies may use VTASI teams to train future 
team leaders who are then empowered to spearhead the development of creative products 
and services; and (8) VTASI teams could serve as a useful tool for colleges to train the cre-
ativity and innovative capabilities of students.
The VTASI team designs have been successfully tested at the University at Buffalo, 
addressing several innovative projects (from 2009 to 2012): (1) Choosing Career Paths 
(Chang 2012), (2) USPS Profitability Problems (Chang 2011b), and (3) Business Enhancements 
to FedEx, Fidelity, Travelocity, and Beach Services (Chang 2011c). The mnemonic VTASI 
stands for virtual teams with anonymity and structured interactions. It may also stand for 
“venturing together achieves superior ingenuities.”
10.3.5  Observations and Team Survey Results
It is generally expected that intra-team competition plays a role among the team members. 
To promote such a constructive competition, the team leader is advised to actively recog-
nize and reward team members for outstanding performances.
The VTASI team leader performs a number of other important tasks. These include 
(a) maintaining a close and admirable working relationship with each participant (e.g., 
evaluating performance, offering feedback, answering individual questions via e-mails, 
injecting questions to challenge, stimulate, redirect and support the individual efforts); (b) 
assisting the team in pruning all ideas that are obvious and of low-level innovative content 
in order to conserve thinking efforts; (c) organizing and presenting the team outputs at 
each round in ways that are easy for team participants to process; (d) managing the idea 
generation process (e.g., guiding the team to utilize the DeepThink prompts by offering 
specific examples or answering questions); (e) enforcing rules to discourage nonconstruc-
tive criticism of others’ ideas; and (f) discouraging any specific individual from exerting 
dominance in idea exchanges. The team leader lights a fire under the team members to get 
the right things done.
Studies in the literature have pointed out that when creative people are challenged by 
other equally creative people on the same team, they could work even better, as more cre-
ativity may be stimulated by interactions between them. The VTASIs can make it happen 
readily by setting up a number of parallel teams to pursue the same project. After the first 
round, members who have demonstrated remarkable creativity could be grouped together 
in new teams to pursue the later rounds.
Extensive surveys were conducted at the University at Buffalo after each project involv-
ing VTASI teams. By and large, most of the survey responses were positive. Participants 
were generally in favor of the use of individual brainstorming methodology, while remain-
ing anonymous. Some participants preferred to have additional group-based meeting for 
face-to-face discussion of the results after each round. A preproject introductory meeting 
was viewed to be useful, so that everyone is brought to the same starting page. A common 
set of reading materials could also be useful, so that all participants have a similar under-
standing regarding the project at hand.
Other improvement ideas suggested include: (a) Additional examples to illustrate the use 
of DeepThink methods in a variety of situations. (b) Offer individually customized feedback 
and leading questions in order to guide participants to drive for a deeper level of creative 
thinking. (c) Allow some Internet-based forms of optional cross-communications between 

362
Engineering Management
the participants, without bringing about social loafing, evaluation comprehension, produc-
tion inhibitation, and other such unwanted effects of group brainstorming. (d) Continue to 
improve the universal applicability of the DeepThink methodologies. (e) Add voting oppor-
tunities for participants to select the top novel ideas at the end of each round of deliberations 
during the idea generation process.
Some of these improvement ideas will be included in our future studies on the use of 
VTASI teams for generating novel ideas in various fields, especially in instances wherein 
breakthrough types of ideas with a high level of novelty are desired.
10.4  Fundamentals of Innovations
In this section, we address the fundamentals of innovation, comprising the innovation 
value chain, the innovation development process, and the keys to high-impact innovations.
10.4.1  Innovation Value Chain
The innovation value chain (Hanson et al. 2007) consists of three sequential processes: 
idea generation, idea development, and the diffusion of the developed concepts. Some 
companies may be strong in one and weak in another. The ultimate success of a company’s 
innovation pursuits depends not on its strengths in any of these processes, but on the 
weaknesses in any of them. Like in a mechanical chain, the overall strength is determined 
by the weakest link in the chain. Companies must understand their own strengths and 
weaknesses in all these processes and take action to strengthen their weak processes, in 
order to achieve an acceptable outcome in their innovation value chain.
10.4.1.1  Idea Generation
Innovative ideas may come from creative people of different sources. Table 10.1 shows a list 
of known sources of “big ideas,” based on a survey conducted by IBM Business Consulting 
Services (Violino 2006).
The concepts of open innovation and open-market innovation are well known in the 
business literature (Chesbrough et al. 2015; Chesbrough 2005; Griffin et al. 2014). The ben-
efits of treating customers and suppliers as strategic partners are obvious. For example, 
physicians may know about opportunities for new capabilities to make their care delivery 
more effective. Debruyne (2014) and Leonard (2002) suggest that companies ask customers 
for the outcomes they want, not for a particular product/service feature that they think 
they need. Christensen (2013) explains the rationale of not asking existing customers solely 
for ideas, thus likely missing some simpler needs of lower-end customers in rapidly grow-
ing segments.
Idea generation may be improved by building an external solution network. As prac-
ticed by Proctor and Gamble (P&G; Huston and Sakkab 2006), customer needs are first 
translated into technology briefs, which include the problems to be solved. These briefs 
are then sent through the company’s solution network, which includes technology scouts, 
suppliers, research laboratories, and retailers to solicit possible solutions.
Idea generation may also be enhanced by creating a solution-seeking website (e.g., Eli 
Lilly’s InnoCentive—www.innocentive.com). Over 80,000 research participants (called 

363
Creativity and Innovation
solvers) in over 170 countries are currently registered at the site to help its clients (called 
seekers) to find solutions to difficult R&D challenges. The clients include Dow Chemical, 
P&G, Eli Lilly, and 20 plus others. When seekers confront a particularly difficult research 
challenge, they post their requirements to InnoCentive’s solver network and offer a bounty 
to anyone who finds a solution. The ultimate price for the solution winner is $20,000. The 
success rate of InnoCentive was said to be about 50%.
Alternatively, companies may set up a discovery network. Siemens is known to have 
set up a 15-person scouting unit in Berkeley, California, to cultivate personal relation-
ships with scientists, engineering doctoral students, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs 
as well as government laboratories and corporate research centers. They keep track of 
emerging technologies and business ideas and constantly feedback their learning to allow 
Siemens to selectively take advantage of such insights in order to achieve time-to-market 
and technological leadership advantages. Similarly, Intuit sent out a 10-member team to 
learn and observe how small business owners do their financial books. The result is the 
Simple Start edition, which became a best seller for Intuit.
Certainly, companies may also build internal cross-unit networks in order to tap into 
the special talents from within. P&G created 30 “communities of practices (CoPs)” each 
focused on an area of expertise, to encourage interactions between workers of diversi-
fied backgrounds. These communities solve specific problems that are brought to them. 
Members of these communities participate in monthly technology summits with business 
representatives.
How could innovations be promoted by networking? Personal networks are extremely 
important for innovative pursuits. Companies should foster innovation by creating net-
works that facilitate interactions between employees and others with specific know-how 
and diversified backgrounds.
A successful network delivers three advantages: (1) private information, which is not 
readily available from public sources; (2) diverse skills sets, which greatly compliment 
one’s own knowledge and experience; and (3) information brokers, who are linked to use-
ful networks to access information if needed (Uzzi and Dunlop 2005). For a network to 
offer these advantages, its members should preferably have diversified knowledge and 
experience, be able to serve as linkages to other networks of diversified people, and can 
offer private information when trust has been established.

Engineering Management
In general, people tend to form their network by predominantly applying the “self-
similarity” principle. The self-similarity principle states that people tend to make friends 
with those who have a similar background, work experience, and outlook. They also 
should not form networks by applying the “proximity” principles, thereby becoming 
closely connected with people who work in nearby offices or neighborhoods. The draw-
backs of such self-similarity or proximity networks lie in their lack of diversity in opinions, 
values, judgments, and worldviews. Too much similarity restricts one’s access to discrep-
ant information.
Instead, people should pursue the “shared activities” principle to form networks, by mak-
ing friends through group activities that pursue high-stakes activities of common interest. 
Examples of such group activities include community service ventures, interdepartmental 
initiatives, voluntary associations, cross-functional teams, charitable foundations, for-profit 
boards, and others. The mutual trusts developed among participants in such activities 
could form a very solid foundation for personal interactions and knowledge interchanges.
Important for innovation is the feedback secured from networks that are composed of 
trustworthy people with diversified perspectives.
MacCormack and Forbach (2008) point out that companies that are successful in pur-
suing innovation via collaboration pay attention to four P’s: (1) People—select people 
on soft skills (communications) and train partners. (2) Processes—teams from different 
cultures have different strengths and working methods, which need to be matched 
with their assigned tasks. Frequent communications is a must to resolve problems. (3) 
Platform—apply the same infrastructure (tools and standards). (4) Program—a coher-
ent program to continuously monitor and improve collaboration efforts (not as indi-
vidual projects). For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner project involves 50 partners 
at 130 locations. The key to competitive advantage lies in the collaboration of so many 
partners, so that their individual expertise can be effectively merged to create innova-
tive outputs.
Example 10.1
Transposing an old known idea to a new unrelated field is a well-known technique to 
innovate. How can company management foster this specific technique of creativity?
Answer 10.1
For such a technique to be effective, companies need to motivate people with diversified 
experience and knowledge to collaborate extensively and have a risk-tolerant organiza-
tion in place to recognize and reward a superior performance in a timely manner.
Hargadon and Sutton (2009) suggest that an effective innovation system can be cre-
ated by the right organization and attitude. Their research pointed out that the best 
innovators systematically use old otherwise disconnected ideas as the raw materials 
for new innovations. Robert Fulton applied the old steam engine idea that was used in 
mines for 75 years to power boats.
Successful innovators of companies systematically go through the knowledge-bro-
kering cycle of identifying good ideas, keeping ideas alive, imagining new uses for old 
ideas, and testing promising ones. Thomas Edison said: “To invent, you need a good 
imagination and a pile of junk.”
10.4.1.2  Idea Conversion and Diffusion
There are two strategies that could improve the success of the idea generation process, 
namely, multichannel funding and safe haven.

365
Creativity and Innovation
Shell Oil created a 25-person unit, GameChanger, with an annual budget of $40 million. 
This unit evaluates and funds business ideas submitted by Shell employees, typically to 
the tune of $300,000–$500,000 per project. Successful projects are subsequently funded by 
Shell divisions.
Safe havens are business units designed to nurture new business ideas and projects 
and shield them from the short-term thinking and budget constraints that pervade in-line 
organizations. Line managers participate on the board that governs these safe havens. Safe 
havens are allowed to operate autonomously in separate geographical locations.
A champion is very much needed to preach and broadcast the value of new ideas, and to 
spearhead the diffusion process throughout a large organization (Vishwanath and Barnett 
2011).
10.4.1.3  Manage and Monitor the Value Chain
One way to constantly improve the innovation value chain is to set up performance 
indicators for each of its three component processes and then steadily monitor their 
progress. For idea generation, these indicators may simply include the number of high-
quality ideas produced within and across units and from outside the firm. For idea 
conversion, the idea selection process may be evaluated by the percentage of all ideas 
generated that end up being selected and funded, whereas the development process 
could be gauged by the percentage of funded ideas that lead to revenues, and the num-
ber of months to first sale. To monitor idea diffusion, the percentage of penetration in 
desired markets, channels, customer groups, and numbers of months to full diffusion 
could be used (Hansen and Birkinshaw 2007).
There are a lot of “best practices” in innovations available in the literature. But one size 
does not fit all. The value chain concept and its management allow the proper choices to be 
made as to which best practices are to be introduced when and where in the organization, 
so that the overall innovation process is effectively advanced.
10.4.2  Innovation Development Processes
According to Kaplan and Norton (2004), basic innovation development processes com-
prise the following four processes: (a) identify opportunities for new products/services; 
(b) evaluate and prioritize ideas for development; (c) design and develop the new prod-
ucts/services; and (d) bring the new products/services to market. These processes will be 
discussed next.
The objectives of identifying opportunities are to anticipate future customer needs and 
then to discover and develop new, more effective or safer products/services. The key met-
rics to measure progress are (1) the time spent with key customers learning about their 
future needs, (2) the number or percentage of new products/service projects launched 
based on client input, (3) the number of new concepts presented for development, and (4) 
the number of new value-added products/services identified.
Innovation opportunities of great value are generally of the following types: (1) ideas 
that enhance functionality aspects and performance attributes, (2) ideas that shorten the 
time-to-market requirements, (3) ideas that extend an existing product/service to applica-
tions beyond the one initially targeted, and (4) ideas that reduce product/service prices for 
customers.
New ideas need to be carefully evaluated and prioritized in view of the respective poten-
tial market values, time lines, risk profiles, and resources required for development. The 

366
Engineering Management
potential market value may be estimated using probabilistic models. The possibility of 
joint development should also be considered.
Many companies utilize the stage-gate process to guide the development process of 
products/services, so that specific objectives are met at predetermined stages. Each gate 
represents a go/no go decision in view of the advancement of technologies, customer pref-
erences, competitive actions, and governmental regulations. The stage-gate process can 
also be used to provide a discipline for the development process of services, although it is 
less formal than in developing products. Figure 10.6 illustrates the stage-gate process that 
is modified for both products and services.
In developing products/services, customer input is sought at all stages. The design/
development efforts are successful if the resulting products/services have the functional 
features desired by the customer in the marketplace, possess the acceptable product/
service quality, and are deliverable at a price that enables the company to earn a satis-
factory profit margin. The more a company understands its customers’ specific behavior 
and needs, the less likely its product/service innovations can be readily copied by the 
competition.
After the launch of the new product/service, companies actively provide after-sale sup-
port to ensure that the marketed product/service delivers the anticipated value to the tar-
geted customers. This involves communications, problem diagnosis, troubleshooting, and 
remedial actions, if any.
For a service provider to be successful in the marketplace there must be something for it 
to stand out, be it a unique service benefit, a novel delivery mode, or a low cost. These must 
be the foci of company innovation drives (Berry et al. 2006).
Examples of superior service contents include the following: Starbucks is known for 
its unique “store atmosphere” that is enhanced by the physical layout, pleasant employee 
interactions, and the special coffee drinks and foods they serve. Cirque de Soleil offers 
a unique combination of highly skilled acrobats and dances, not seen before. Barnes & 
Noble create a seating area for customers to browse its books while enjoying a drink.
Examples of achieving differentiation by offering a superior delivery mode are the fol-
lowing: Ball Memorial Hospital redesigned its emergency room reception area to facili-
tate the rapid processing of patients and to make them more comfortable. Enterprise Auto

locates its car rental stores to where local customers are in order to better serve those 
who have short-term transportation needs due to car repairs. Walgreen stores remain 
open 24 hours a day and are conveniently located at major cross-sections of main streets 
in a city. Similarly, Denny’s and Perkins are known to be open 24 hours a day for the 
convenience of some night folks. Online degree programs represent the innovation dis-
ruption in delivering college education, spearheaded by the University of Phoenix, which 
becomes the world’s largest university with over 60,000 online students. Online degree 
programs are known to please customers who would otherwise not be able to gain the 
educational experience. However, not all hiring companies in industry welcome gradu-
ates of online degree programs because of the divergent reputation and learning quality 
of these programs.
Other services distinguish themselves by lower prices. Southwest Airlines offers a 
significant discount in airfares by using a common aircraft type to reduce maintenance 
cost, flying a limited number of service routes to optimize the utilization of equipment, 
eliminating seat assignment to speed up its boarding operation at the gates, and reducing 
onboard food services to cut costs. Alamo is a low-cost car rental company that is known 
to have placed its rental offices far away from the airport to save operational costs. Hilton 
Hotels is known to have offered groups of hotels at lower price ranges in order to broaden 
the customer niches they can serve.
Christensen and Anthony (2004) point out specific examples of achieving marketplace 
acceptance by lowering prices in health care, education, and law. Specifically, adjusting 
downward the service features to align with the affordability and needs of lower-end 
customers segments represents “innovative disruptions.” Using paralegals to take care 
of the less-demanding tasks of a law firm will allow a “good enough” legal service to be 
provided to more people at a lower cost. Producing software to promote self-help in legal 
matters is another viable option. Nurses can follow the diagnostic procedures developed 
by physicians. In Minnesota, QuickMedx kiosk, which is located in a local grocery store 
and run by a nurse practitioner, dispenses prescription medication for certain common 
illnesses within 15 minutes. CNN is known for its novel programming strategy of offer-
ing news highlights on a 24 hour basis. eBay is the primary online market for buying and 
selling almost anything. FedEx prides itself on being the on-time delivery package service 
that is extremely dependable. Google provide a superb delivery of search results with 
speed and relevance. Netflix created a unique way of communicating with and delivering 
rental CDs to its customers. Banks offering automated teller machines (ATMs) enhance 
customer loyalty by enabling 24 hour access to deposit and withdraw transactions. Other 
services offer web-based frequently asked questions and self-service at no cost to custom-
ers, in order to enhance customer experience.
For both “concurrent and separate” services, companies (1) focus on creating a culture 
that supports employee performance and continuous innovation, (2) create a superior 
service benefit to customers, (3) simplify service designs to raise customers’ affordabil-
ity for services, and (4) empower a champion to lead the innovation process in securing 
a strategic differentiation. Furthermore, for “concurrent” services, companies (5) empha-
size the development of a scalable business model in order to enhance productivity, (6) 
train employees and motivate them to service customers well, and (7) invest in the ser-
vice “factory” by offering a pleasant customer experience (e.g., physical layout, unique 
benefit, pleasant employee interactions). On the other hand, for “separate” services, com-
panies (8) innovate to raise the level of operational excellence and (9) build brand to over-
come risks perceived by customers in selecting “sight-unseen” new innovative services 
(Berry et al. 2006).

368
Engineering Management
Example 10.2
In the new millennium, innovative ideas, rather than physical assets, will enable 
companies to compete efficaciously in a global economy. Usually, innovative ideas come 
from knowledge workers who are typically inventive, independent, and mobile. No sin-
gle company is capable of “chaining” down these workers, as they are happy to be there 
for now, but ready to move on at any time.
It is likely to be a major challenge for engineering or technology managers to foster 
innovation on a continued basis in such an environment. What might be a good strategy 
for engineering and technology managers to adopt in order to secure a constant flow of 
innovations potent enough to sustain the relative competitiveness of their employers?
Answer 10.2
During the last century, a number of well-known companies (e.g., Apple, IBM, AT&T, DuPont, 
GE, and Merck) achieved remarkable business success by emphasizing R&D in-house and 
innovation on the inside. They proudly advertised the number of U.S. patents they received 
per year as an indication of their inventive power. They kept a large number of experts on 
their payroll to foster innovations. Many of these giants have since left their historical mis-
sion of inventive discovery. Some have also abandoned the past practice of not sharing with 
others those inventions that did not fit their respective corporate strategies at the time.
Companies in the knowledge economy have implemented a flexible technology strat-
egy with great success. Known examples include Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, and Pfizer. 
Because skilled workers are mobile, companies can no longer count on in-depth devel-
opment of innovations on the inside. In order to secure a constant inflow of creative 
ideas, they pursue open innovations (e.g., by acquisition, joint venture, codevelopment, 
or contract research) deemed useful to foster their corporate objectives. The empha-
sis has been shifted from in-depth innovation within a discipline to innovation with 
breadth and integration across disciplines.
P&G is known to be an aggressive acquirer of creative ideas from the outside. In 2001, 
10% of P&G products came from outside sources, and this percentage is expected to 
have risen to 50% by 2006. P&G has also decided to make a patented technology avail-
able to outsiders, including competitors, if it is not used by at least one internal business 
unit within three years (Chesbrough 2005).
To meet the new challenge of creating a constant flow of creative ideas, engineering 
and technology managers must scan promising innovations on the outside (universi-
ties, start-ups, competitors, and others) and integrate them for profitable internal appli-
cations. Any inside innovations that do not conform to the corporate objectives are to be 
aggressively marketed to outside companies to generate licensing revenues.
10.4.3  Categories of Innovation in Practice
Boston Consulting Group defined the most innovative companies in the world for 2014 
(Baer 2014). The top ten innovative companies are: (1) Apple, (2) Google, (3) Samsung, (4) 
Microsoft, (5) IBM, (6) Amazon, (7) Tesla Motors, (8) Toyota Motors, (9) Facebook, and (10) 
Sony. A number of useful innovation practices have been defined in their study.
In the past, innovation was about technology and control of quality, cost, and efficiency. 
Today, it is about creativity and growth. In general there are three types of innovations:
	
1.	Technology innovations (Blackberry made by Research in Motion Ltd.).
	
2.	Business model innovations (Virginia Group applies a hip lifestyle brand to airlines, 
financial services, and health insurance; Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd. outsources 
everything except marketing and customer management).

369
Creativity and Innovation
	
	
FedEx is known to have implemented four specific business model innovations:
	
1.	 Branching out into new businesses in order to burrow deeper into the sup-
ply chains of customers.
	
2.	 Expanding into fast-growth markets (e.g., China).
	
3.	 Improving package-tracking capabilities and other customer-oriented 
features.
	
4.	 Adopting a “here, there, and everywhere” strategy (e.g., created 1450 Kinko’s 
outlets).
	
	
Kroger, a traditional grocery chain with annual sales of $66 billion in 2006 
and 3650 stores in 31 states, expanded its businesses to include credit cards, 
Kroger-branded ATM machines, mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and 
insurance coverage (identity theft, home, life, and pet) in order to “drive more 
people to the store and bring them back.”
	
	
Wal-Mart, another grocery chain, added prepaid Visa debit cards and other 
money services and introduced “MoneyCenter” alcoves in stores.
	
3.	Process innovations (operational improvement—Southwest Airlines).
	
	
The study also identified several innovation obstacles, which are prevalent in 
industry. These include: (1) slow development time, (2) lack of coordination (flexible 
organizational setting, new leadership positions, diversity of team, membership); 
(3) lack of culture (rewards, metrics to monitor progress, risk management)—cul-
ture is defined by the CEO; and (4) getting good consumer insights (observe what 
customers do and understand the local culture, behavior, and fashion).
For companies to achieve success in innovation, these obstacles must be overcome.
10.5  Innovation Management
In this section, we will discuss the organizational settings that are conducive to innova-
tions, business dimensions along which innovation could create corporate competitive-
ness, best practice for managing creative people, some additional guidelines for managing 
innovations, and protection of inventions and innovations.
10.5.1  Organizational Settings Conducive to Innovations
Brown (2005) argues for an open “pull-type” of organizational form to foster innovation. 
In case demand is well known, the traditional push system (top-down, centrally man-
aged, routine operation) is best in efficiency. However, when future demand is not readily 
forecast, then a pull system is much more agile, as in the case when consisting of many 
partners, each having special skills and technology, innovations can be pulled together 
for a given new demand. Table 10.2 illustrates the difference between the organizational 
forms of push and pull types.
Companies interested in fostering innovation are strongly advised to adapt the “pull” 
type form, so that they can increase opportunities for collaboration, create closer relation-
ships with customers, receive more rapid feedback, attain greater scalability, and network 

370
Engineering Management
with deep sources of competitive advantage. Examples of “pull” platforms in the service 
industries include Amazon.com, Netflix, and Expedia.
Since 2002, John Deere has created 300 CoPs to drive innovations by facilitating connec-
tions among knowledge workers (Suave 2007). In each of these practice-based communi-
ties, which cover best practices, training, mentoring, and peer resources, subject-matter 
experts are available via e-mail, face-to-face meeting, or through online conference.
IDEO, Palo Alto, California, is a product design company known internationally for its 
innovative skills. The company follows the strategy of observing, brainstorming, proto-
typing, and implementing to pursue innovations. As pointed out by Kelley (2005), its suc-
cess in innovation is primarily due to 10 capabilities that it systematically nurtures and 
develops:
	
1.	Observes and studies customer behavior.
	
2.	Conducts experiments to continuously learn.
	
3.	Brings findings in other industries to the project at hand.
	
4.	Has perseverance to overcome difficulties.
	
5.	Facilitates collaboration among team members.
	
6.	Organizes the right set of team members.
	
7.	Designs to meet customers’ needs.
	
8.	Promotes creativity by changing the physical environment.
	
9.	Anticipates customers’ needs.
	 10.	Motivates the team.
A clear focus on customers, together with experimentation and internal collaboration, 
represents IDEO’s model for innovative success.

Answer 10.3
There are quite a few actions that company management could take to promote the 
cross-disciplinary collaboration of people with diversified skills, knowledge, and 
experience and thus enhance the probability of success in the company’s innovation 
programs.
As indicated in Mendonca and Sneader (2007), Bill Campbell offers a few tips to man-
agers in order to foster innovations:
	
1.	 Empower engineers
	
2.	 Create an innovation culture
	
3.	 Lead with people who care about building durability and lasting value
	
4.	 Focus on things that are really differentiable
	
5.	 Support innovations (fellowships, awards, bonuses, extra vacations, etc.)
	
6.	 Technology centered
	
7.	 Involve marketing to understand the “problems”
	
8.	 Set high expectations
	
9.	 Take risks and anticipate some failures
	
10.	 Hire creative people
	
11.	 Screen ideas and projects from the viewpoint of a venture capitalist
10.5.2  Business Dimensions to Focus
Sawhney et al. (2006) point out that there are many business dimensions along with inno-
vation that could create corporate competitiveness. Neglecting some of these dimensions 
may cause companies to miss valuable growth opportunities.
	
1.	Service offering: The functional features.
	
2.	Platform: Modular components of the service, which can be used to create related 
new services.
	
3.	Solutions: The real value that customers get.
	
4.	Customers: Future needs.
	
5.	Customer experience: The pleasure conveyed to customers by the interactions.
	
6.	Value capture: Profitability to service provider.
	
7.	Processes: Streaming the production process to be cost-efficient.
	
8.	Organization: Change organization to improve customer supports.
	
9.	Supply chains: Engage suppliers to improve offering.
	 10.	Presence: Change the touch points to improve customer experience.
	 11.	Networking: Intelligent offerings via networks.
	 12.	Brand: Create brand to reduce risks perceived by customers.
From the customers’ perspectives, there are nine value dimensions that are important. 
Customer value is created by having achieved satisfaction along one or more of these 
dimensions. Innovations along these nine dimensions tend to effectively create competi-
tiveness in the marketplace. Figure 10.7 illustrates these nine dimensions and the foci of 
innovations that are needed to achieve each.
It is not necessary that companies pursue innovations in all these dimensions in order 
to succeed in the marketplace. Oftentimes, it might be sufficient to focus on one or two 

372
Engineering Management
dimensions that have been neglected by the competition. The following examples demon-
strate the effectiveness of this innovation approach:
	
1.	JetBlue Airways offers a better customer experience by having live satellite televi-
sion, leather seats, and fashionably clad flight attendants.
	
2.	The Home Depot Inc. focuses on the needs of “do-it-yourself” customers.
	
3.	Kaiser Permanent offers comfortable waiting rooms, lobbies with clear directions, 
and large examination rooms for three or more people, and curtains for privacy to 
improve customer experience (Nussbaum 2004).
	
4.	Cemex shortened the time window from 3  hours to 20  minutes for delivering 
ready-to-pour concrete by utilizing global positioning systems (GPS) and comput-
ers in its fleet of trucks.
	
5.	MinuteClinic locates its kiosks in stores such as Target and CVS to offer a menu 
of services to diagnose about 25 straightforward ailments, including strep throat 
and pinkeye. The nurse practitioner who staffs the kiosk can reliably diagnose the 
conditions in less than 15 minutes and write a prescription that the customer can 
fill in the in-store pharmacy. The value dimensions emphasized here are customer 
convenience and speed.
	
6.	Starbucks offers a pleasant environment for conversation, reading, or relaxation, 
even though their coffee sells at $4.00 a cup.
When innovating along the value dimension of service features, it is important to under-
stand the real needs of customers. Services that incorporate excessive performance fea-
tures may overshoot the customers’ needs, while demanding high prices could lead to 
poor marketplace performance. Scaling down the service features oftentimes reduces the 
price and meets a greater majority of lower-strata customers. Intuit was successful in sim-
plifying its Quicken product to better fit the needs of small business customers and scored 
a great success in the marketplace.

Creativity and Innovation
10.5.3  Best Practices in Managing Creative People
Companies have many types of resources, such as raw materials, logistic systems, and 
political influence, but the most valuable one among them is creative capital. Creative capi-
tal is embodied in creative thinkers, who pioneer new technologies, give birth to new 
industries, and power economic growth, and in the relationships built between these 
thinkers and others such as customers, suppliers, and sales and support staff. This creative 
class is said to make up about one-third of the U.S. workforce (Torr 2008).
Over the years, SAS Institute, a software development company located in Cary, North 
Carolina, was able to develop three principles for managing such a creative class:
Employees’ minds are stimulated by increasingly challenging work, attendance at 
professional conferences, opportunities to author and publish journal articles, the use 
of updated tools, and the financial support for additional training. Hassles are mini-
mized based on employee surveys. Various on-site benefits are made available (day-care 
center, basketball court, exercise room, college advisement services, home-care aids, 
dry cleaning, haircutting, auto detailing, and others). Allow a flexible time schedule for 
employees.
To spark creativity, managers ask a lot of questions, bring groups of people together to 
facilitate the exchange of ideas and spur innovations, and procure the materials and tools 
needed by employees. Since managers also do hands-on work, they earn the respect of 
technologists. There is no penalty for making honest mistakes, as experimentation is cru-
cial for breakthroughs.
The company tracks and organizes customer inputs and suggestions that are obtained 
through its website and phone lines, its annual web-based SASware ballot, and its annual 
users’ conference. SAS software developers, consultants, and technical support staff inter-
act with customers, learn their future needs, and invent new solutions for such needs.
Separately, Van Veen et al. (2015) emphasize the customer-centric research to promote 
innovations based on knowing who the customers are and what they want, by establish-
ing a deep relationship with core customers, and then extending the number of customers 
beyond the core and further to new ones. In so doing, companies gain knowledge that is 
often opaque to competitors, promote employees’ loyalty and reduce turnover, and attain 
innovations that add true value to the companies.
Example 10.4
Creativity needs to be encouraged by management. However, many companies take 
steps that unintentionally kill creativity. Name a few of such practices that discourage 
employee creativity.
Answer 10.4
Creativity is known to be affected by three components: (1) expertise, (2) creative think-
ing skills, and (3) motivation. Expertise and creative thinking skills are generally a part 
of individual capabilities, which are not readily influenced by management practices. 
Managerial practices have an impact on motivation, both the extrinsic and intrinsic 
kinds. There are a number of ways that management could inadvertently demotivate 
individuals to become creative (Amabile 2009):
	
1.	 Not matching people with the right assignments that utilize their expertise 
and skills, and stretch their abilities.
	
2.	 Failure to define project goals clearly and change them often. Leave no freedom 
for the individual to select methods to accomplish specific project objectives. 

374
Engineering Management
Autonomy around work processes fosters creativity and enhances intrinsic 
motivation.
	
3.	 Impose fake deadlines or impossibly tight ones and constrain resources 
needed to pursue creativity.
	
4.	 Set up teams with members who do not have diversified experience and exper-
tise, do not collaborate well, and do not build trust among themselves.
	
5.	 Lack of positive managerial encouragement (e.g., remaining silent when out-
come is good, taking a long time to evaluate outcomes, and creating an atmo-
sphere of fear by criticizing failures).
	
6.	 Demonstrate no role models to promote all three creativity components.
	
7.	 Not fostering an organization-wide policy of information sharing and 
employee collaboration.
Example 10.5
In today’s highly competitive marketplace, companies are striving to be customer-
focused. In addition, many of them pursue open innovation strategies to create services 
that are useful to future customers. If you were in charge of turning customer input into 
innovation, how would you proceed?
Answer 10.5
Soliciting input from customers to foster innovation is indeed important for many com-
panies that want to benefit from their customers’ understanding of their future needs 
as well as their insights regarding new ways to satisfy such needs.
Simply asking customers what they would like to see in new services may not work. 
This is because most customers have a limited frame of reference and only know what 
they have experienced. They are not in a position to externalize what they do not know 
about emergent technologies, new materials, and the like. Furthermore, some custom-
ers may merely recite the missing features that other service providers already offer. 
Following such advice will lead to incremental development of “met-too” services. The 
service ideas of “lead users,” those who have an advanced understanding of a service 
and are experts in its use, may be of limited general appeal, because they are not the 
average users. Customers may in fact not always welcome “new and improved” ser-
vice features and functionalities. It is well known that vendors continue to upgrade the 
versions of their software with new features that most customers do not need but are 
forced to buy. An industrial survey indicates that customers typically use less than 10% 
of the software’s overall capability. Innovation along this strategy creates resentment 
among customers. However, there is a methodology for capturing customer input that 
could be conducive to corporate innovation (Ulwick 2005).
The company should lay out the underlying process or activities associated with a ser-
vice (e.g., a specific medical procedure) and hold interviews with a diversified set of cus-
tomers who can judge the value of the service from the cost standpoint.
Appoint a moderator who could focus the customers on the underlying processes, not 
on the solutions of a given service. Ask customers to specify the improvements needed for 
each step in the process, the reasons for wanting such improvements, and the respective 
quantitative measures (time, number, frequency), so that the outcome statements can be 
used later for benchmarking, competitive analysis, and concept evaluation. In general, it 
may take three 2 hour sessions to complete such outcome-based interviews.
The company organizes the outcomes and asks customers to rate them for relative 
importance and satisfaction.

375
Creativity and Innovation
The outcome may be used to jump-start innovation by identifying new areas for service 
development, updating market segmentation, and defining a desirable competitive posi-
tion for the company.
The key novelty of this approach is to ask customers for the new value or benefit they 
would like to see (not to name specific solutions). Then, the company develops solutions in 
specific forms that offer the desirable value to them.
10.5.4  Additional Guidelines for Managing Innovations
Established companies are known to encounter problems in pursuing breakthrough inno-
vations. These problems are typically related to company culture, business practices, and 
management mind-sets.
Built on the business case of Analog Devices Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, Govindarajan 
and Trimble (2005) suggest three specific guidelines for established companies to succeed 
in bringing new innovations to market: (1) forget, (2) borrow, and (3) learn. Companies 
need to forget the old, albeit successful ways of doing business, to borrow from within the 
needed capabilities and resources to support the new innovative ventures, and to learn 
new ways to overcome uncertainties through careful planning.
When managing the development of a new service innovation, it is also important to 
assess the status of the critical complements that are required to bring value to the mar-
ketplace (Adner 2009). Offering a Ferrari in a world without gasoline or highways will 
not lead to marketplace success. Besides assessing the risks of developing the target ser-
vice itself, companies must coordinate with complementary innovators and align all value 
chain partners to deliver the expected service performance in time.
10.5.5  Protection of Inventions and Innovations
Inventions and innovations need to be properly protected. They form valuable intellectual 
properties, which strengthen the relative competitiveness of the enterprise.
10.5.5.1  Types of Intellectual Properties
Intellectual properties, including innovative ideas, may be protected by (1) trade secrets, 
(2) copyrights, (3) trademarks, and (4) patents.
Trade secrets are valuable insights, work procedures, methodologies, know-how, 
or design that the inventors keep secret in order to realize competitive advantages. 
Copyrights protect the works of authorships (e.g., text, drawing, music, and video), fixed 
on a tangible medium (e.g., paper or CD) and are in effect for the duration of the author’s 
life plus 70 years. Trademarks are graphic symbols that indicate the source of goods 
or services. They remain in effect as long as they are being used by the trademark’s 
owners.
Patents are contracts between the inventor and the government. Inventors are required 
to disclose their novel ideas in details (e.g., composition of matter, process, products, or 
improvements) so that society at large will benefit from such novel and nonobvious ideas 
in the long run, in exchange for the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, 
offering for sales, or importing the invention into the United States for 20 years, measured 
from the date of patent filing.

376
Engineering Management
10.5.5.2  Patents
Filing for a patent application is usually proceeded by an evaluation of (1) IP strategy, 
(2) novelty—patentability, and (3) commercial value. Inventors (and their employers) may 
pursue an offensive, defensive, or spoiler IP strategy. An offensive strategy is one in which 
patents are sought to carve out a new product/service domain for generating revenues 
from a new market segment. A defensive strategy, on the other hand, focuses on pro-
tecting the inventors’ own core competencies from being encroached by competitors. The 
spoiler strategy is one in which patents are filed to prevent competitors from applying cer-
tain novel matter, process, or design, even though these areas are of no direct commercial 
interest to the inventors.
The issue of novelty is typically addressed via a patent prior art search. Internet sources 
such as the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO) 
are quite convenient for inventors to access. To be patentable, ideas must be novel, nonob-
vious, and useful. To be nonobvious, the ideas should not have been obvious to persons 
having ordinary skills in the art. Showing the circumstances in which applying the ideas 
at hand could generate unexpected failures is a good way to demonstrate the idea’s nature 
of being nonobvious. Commercial value is generally a very important decision factor for 
filing a patent, as related to the alignment with corporate strategy, compatibility with cur-
rent product/service offerings, and other such considerations.
A patent is a written document, which consists of the following sections: (1) background 
of the invention, (2) summary of the invention, (3) brief description of the drawings, (4) 
description of the invention, (5) claims, and (6) abstract. Inventors supply materials, data, 
and information, which are then absorbed into all sections. Claims are usually prepared 
by patent lawyers.
Claims represent the most important part of the patent. Using legal language, claims 
describe the specifics that inventors could enforce to exclude others from practicing the 
inventive contents comprising composition, process, product design, or improvements. 
Inventors try to prepare claims in a scope as broad as possible, whereas U.S. patent exam-
iners strive to make the scope of the claims as narrow as possible.
A formal patent application represents a costly and time-consuming endeavor. As an 
alternative, inventors may first elect to file a provisionary patent with the U.S. Patent Office 
in order to retain the right to file a formal and detailed patent within one year of the origi-
nal filing date, the earliest priority date. Provisional patents are useful to some inventors, 
who wish to preserve the priority date so that they may negotiate with potential users 
and explore the commercial value of the invention during this one-year period, and then 
decide if a formal patent application should be filed.
To facilitate the filing of patents in foreign countries, inventors may elect to file a patent 
cooperation treaty (PCT) registration within one year of the original priority date. They 
can then follow up with the filing of actual patents in any of the 139 signatory countries 
that participate in this system. The PCT system does not offer patents, as patents must be 
granted by the individual countries or regions (such as the European Union).
10.5.5.3  Public Disclosures of Potentially Novel Ideas
Inventors must pay special attention to the rules regarding public disclosure. Public dis-
closure is the practice of one of the following: filing a provisionary patent application, 
publishing papers in conferences, defending theses in open sessions, discussing ideas 
in departmental meetings, submitting abstracts of grant proposals to funding agencies, 

377
Creativity and Innovation
describing ideas in web pages, and others. If there has been no public disclosure of the 
patentable ideas before filing a U.S. patent, then the inventor has one year to file patent 
applications for protecting the same ideas in foreign countries. However, if a public dis-
closure has been made prior to filing a U.S. patent, then the inventor can only file foreign 
applications to protect the same ideas within one year of the public disclosure. It is thus 
very important to not disclose potentially patentable ideas to anyone.
10.5.5.4  Documentation and Inventorship
There are strict rules for establishing the concept of the patentable idea. It is generally 
recommended that bound notebooks with continuously numbered pages are used to 
document the novel ideas conceived, the date of idea conception, and the names of the 
inventors involved. This page must be signed by all inventors and cosigned by a witness, 
in order to be legally acceptable.
Whether or not all the inventors who sign such pages are a part of the eventual inven-
torship of a patent depends ultimately on the claims the patent contains. Inventors whose 
ideas form the basis of at least one of the claims in the patent are co-inventors. All co-
inventors have the same rights to make use of a granted patent (e.g., selling, enforcing, 
offering license, creating joint ventures, and signing codevelopment contracts), without 
the consent of the remainder co-inventors, unless the rights issue is clarified and agreed 
on by all co-inventors before the patent applications.
10.5.5.5  Safeguard Against the Loss of Intellectual Properties
One frequently encountered problem when marketing novel products/services to emerg-
ing economy countries is how to effectively prevent the loss of the intellectual properties. 
Many companies are known to achieve some success by applying the following tactics:
	
1.	When exporting hardware that requires the use of software, choose to have the 
hardware designed and manufactured in one country and the software in another.
	
2.	Sell and market the product/service of an older version, and not the most innova-
tive ones.
	
3.	Screen all employees based on ethics.
	
4.	Require all company employees by contract not to work for competitors within 
three years of leaving the company.
10.6  Selected Innovation Practices in Industry
10.6.1  Innovation in Communications, Financial, and Technical Business Services
Based on a study of Canadian service industries in 1998, several innovation strategies are 
common among the services industries of communications, financial services, and tech-
nical business services: (1) focusing on existing customers and service quality to main-
tain or increase market share; (2) treating customers as the key sources of innovation 
ideas; (3) emphasizing the use of copyrights and trademarks, instead of patents, to protect 

378
Engineering Management
intellectual properties; (4) de-emphasizing the drive to improve productivity or employee 
skill level (Gellatly and Peters 1999).
Companies in the service industries face different pressures from the marketplace. As 
a consequence, they tend to drive their innovation processes differently. Innovation is 
pursued for different reasons, in different ways, and to meet different industry-specific 
objectives.
	
1.	The communication industry perceives as its major threat the advancements in 
production technologies and regulatory constraints. They orientate their inno-
vation strategy toward the use of high-quality suppliers and the acquisition of 
new technologies. They focus on improving service quality and reliability. They 
get innovation ideas from suppliers and the availability of new technologies (e.g., 
conversion to fiber optics and digital-based technologies). They regard legislative 
restrictions (e.g., restricting the nature and content of services) as an innovation 
obstacle to overcome. In this industry, competition is viewed as less intense than 
in others.
	
2.	The financial services industry regards as a major uncertainty the service sub-
stitutability by consumers and price competition. They understand the need of 
customizing service, and of being price-competitive. Thus, they focus on treating 
their employees well (compensation plans, skills development) and hiring quali-
fied staff. As a result, their innovation strategies are focused on reducing labor 
costs, speeding up delivery, protecting know-how by trademarks, and getting 
innovation ideas from their competitors.
	
3.	The technical business services industry faces uncertainties in predicting the 
future actions of customers and competitors, and dealing with product obsoles-
cence. They need to emphasize service quality and customer experience. They 
are typically oriented toward technology development and refinement through 
in-house R&D. Their innovation drives tend to concentrate on service flexibility 
to diversified customers, as well as service quality, adaptability, user friendliness, 
speed of delivery, and accessibility. In-house R&D is a major source of ideas for 
innovation, which are typically protected by patents. Companies in this industry 
may face some major hurtles related to financial and manpower resources.
When planning for innovation strategies, it is thus important to consider the main mar-
ket pressure the industry is under in order to maximize the benefits derivable from the 
innovative efforts.
10.6.2  Innovations in Insurance Industry
The insurance sector is generally known to be a slow adopter of new innovations, such 
as the Internet and wireless data communication devices. This is partly due to its busi-
ness nature of being low volume and low frequency. However, the development of IT 
technologies, globalization, customers’ demand for transparency leading to insurance 
products commoditization, and industrial consolidation will induce more changes in the 
future. Besides cost control, the insurance sector is expected to embrace new business 
designs, and to promote offerings, marketing ability, product/service distributions, and 
risk assessment.
Examples of some of these new innovations in the insurance sector include:

379
Creativity and Innovation
	
1.	Progressive Insurance, Mayfield Village, Ohio, introduced the immediate response 
claims service, which was later revised to become immediate response vehicles, 
to enable an adjuster to write a check on the spot at an auto accident, thus lower-
ing the cost and creating a positive customer experience. Oftentimes, the agent is 
able to impress the other party in the auto collision such that he or she becomes a 
progressive customer.
	
	
Progressive launched the first insurance website, to offer online policy purchas-
ing in real time and to pilot usage-based insurance via GPS and cellular data modems. 
Customers pay insurance premiums that are based on the actual behavior of the driver.
	
2.	Components of a new insurance application architecture (IAA) were developed 
by IBM to promote the creation of the next-generation insurance applications. 
These components make use of the service-oriented architecture to connect hard-
ware and software elements into an underlying enterprise service bus, which 
fosters the development of new insurance business designs, strategies, and 
opportunities.
	
3.	Jefferson Pilot Financial, Greensboro, North Carolina, and Grange Mutual, Columbus, 
Ohio, started supporting their distribution channels and reducing the barrier to using 
their systems. They developed web portals for their agents and broker customers.
	
4.	Nationwide Insurance, Columbus, Ohio, connected several data sources to create 
a single view of its customers, thereby improving customer experience and reduc-
ing processing errors.
10.6.3  Innovations in Food Industry
The food industry is increasingly adopting new technologies to reduce cost, improve oper-
ations, and raise customer satisfaction (Stewart and Martinez 2002). Wal-Mart is known 
to have pioneered the practices of linking across the supply chain and using information 
technology to respond more promptly to the marketplace. In 2001, the company became 
the nation’s largest food retailer.
Several examples of innovations in the food industry include:
	
1.	Efficient consumer response (ECR) was launched by the grocery retailers and industry 
trade associations in 1992 to (1) manage the mix of products on retail store shelves 
and increase sales and product turnover, (2) reduce out-of-stock percentages, (3) elim-
inate inefficiencies between supply chain partners and minimize problems leading 
to inefficient trade promotions, and (4) increase the success rate of new food products.
	
2.	Efficient foodservice response (EFR) was established by the food service industry 
in 1996 to promote the use of standard product identification codes. Bar coding 
produces 1 error in 3 million, whereas manual key entries register 1 in 300. Tyson 
Foods bar codes nearly 100% of its 4000 products.
	
3.	eFS Network was created in July 2000 by food industry leaders such as McDonalds, 
Sysco, Cargill, and Tyson Foods to increase an Internet-based, industry-wide mar-
ketplace for food service companies.
To induce sales, stores apply special tactics to cause shoppers to stay longer, and walk 
slowly through the aisles. They use smells and sights to trigger shoppers’ appetite. Some 
of the well-known tactics the stores use include:

380
Engineering Management
	
1.	Candy and magazines are placed at the checkout counters so that bored, cranky, 
and hungry shoppers are tempted to grab them.
	
2.	Breakfast cereals are located directly across from the candy section, so that kids 
can check out the candy while Mom is filling up the cart with cereal.
	
3.	Sugary cereals for kids are always on the lower shelves, at a child’s eye level and 
within reach of little arms.
	
4.	Most folks assume that the items located at the end of the aisles where shoppers do 
their U-turns into the next aisle are full of sales items. This is usually not the case. 
That very valuable real estate is full of special items, as suppliers pay the stores 
more to have their merchandise put there.
	
5.	Items are regularly moved throughout the sores so shoppers walk around longer 
and buy more stuff.
	
6.	New products are placed near the top-selling items in order to encourage shop-
pers to try them.
	
7.	Shoppers are kept longer in stores by offering services such as a coffee shop, caf-
eteria-style buffet, pharmacy, photo processing, and others, while playing slow 
music.
	
8.	Shoppers’ senses are attracted by placing items with mouthwatering smells, such 
as cookies or rotisserie chickens, at the store’s entrance section. Food samples are 
used to trigger shoppers’ appetite.
Studies have shown that as a consequence of applying such insightful tactics, shoppers 
usually buy 40% more than what they set out to buy.
10.6.4  Major Hurdles to Innovations in Health Care
The cost of U.S. health care is around $2.2 trillion (17% of GDP) per year, being among 
the highest in the world. Hospital activities account for $400 billion of the excessive costs. 
Still, about 300,000 people have died due to hospital “medical errors” in the past few years. 
Third-party pay providers control reimbursement and favor physicians who follow “reci-
pes” that are established by the innovation-killing “peer reviews” process.
Duke University Medical Center is known to have developed an innovative program 
for people with congestive heart failure. In only one year, the program reduced costs by 
40%, substantially improving patients’ health that hospital visits and usage plummeted. 
As a consequence, the hospital’s income dropped accordingly, as the providers (insurance 
companies) only pay for treating sick people. The third-party pay providers in our current 
system do not reward innovations in health care (Herzlinger 2007).
Entrepreneurs avoid health-care delivery because providers (governments, insurance 
companies) set prices, specify procedures, and define the types of patients to be covered. To 
change the system in favor of innovation, we need a consumer-driven health-care system 
in which consumers can reward new and innovative developments that improve health.
Example 10.6
Innovations are of fundamental importance to any company. However, innovations 
entail risks. Management must be prepared to anticipate risks and devise ways to miti-
gate them. What kind of strategies should a company consider to manage risks related 
to its innovative pursuits?

381
Creativity and Innovation
Answer 10.6
In general, management needs to follow the following general principles to pursue 
service innovations: (1) define a clear challenge in terms of a customer need (not a busi-
ness need) that is worthy satisfying; (2) identify a process to pursue innovations that 
include multidisciplinary participation and sources of cutting-edge ideas; (3) favor con-
cepts that combine multiple elements of innovations (e.g., business model, IT platform, 
and channel) to increase impact and distinctiveness; and (4) apply techniques and struc-
tures that counterbalance the forces of risk aversion.
Risks are inherent in service innovations. Rao (2005) suggests a few “best practices” 
to mitigate them:
	
1.	 Remove the naysayers in leadership positions
	
2.	 Make go/no go decisions by determining if the company can survive the 
worst-case outcome
	
3.	 Make exploratory funds available for trying new concepts
	
4.	 Motivate innovation teams by inducing competition
	
5.	 Create a special environment for allowing the exploration of new opportuni-
ties far afield from the main business line (e.g., IBM’s Watson Health)
10.7  Conclusions
In this chapter, we first discussed the creative process and several creative thinking strat-
egies to promote the generation of new ideas that precede innovations. We then elabo-
rated the fundamentals in innovations (value chains, processes, keys), and the strategies 
and practices of managing innovations (organization, business dimensions, best practices, 
examples, guidelines), followed by innovations examples in selected sectors.
The examples of service innovations discussed in this chapter represent the good results 
of an innovation drive of the service industry. The specific cases discussed illustrate the 
various new opportunities that remain open for additional innovations in technology, 
business model, and/or process. Much more is sure to come.
Strategic differentiation sets any enterprise apart from its competitors in the market-
place. It impacts its long-term potential of generating sales revenue, the top line, in a sus-
tainable way. In the absence of any strategic differentiation, the enterprise would offer 
products/services only of a commodity type, which do not confer competitive advan-
tages. The objective of this chapter is to lay the basic foundation that should enable 
STEM professionals to start developing innovations. The sooner they acquire the essen-
tial skills and understanding in relation to innovations, the sooner they will become 
productive in making creative contributions to their industrial sectors. There is a signifi-
cant opportunity for those who are willing and technologically able, to innovate in the 
service industry.
STEM professionals and leaders are advised to constantly nurture the following skills in 
order to promote strategic differentiations:
	
1.	Capabilities of thinking creatively (e.g., employing the DeepThink strategies) in

metrics.
	 10.	Creativity and innovation will usually result in some changes to be introduced 
into the organization, such as a new production process, new marketing strat-
egies, new procedures of offering customer supports, and others. Not everyone 
likes changes and some will in fact resist them. STEM professionals and managers 
need to be prepared to manage changes. Explain the principal reasons for resis-
tance to change in organizations.

383
Creativity and Innovation

demonstrable skills and insights in both of these competencies, actually 
pursue in order to maximize the value that he or she creates for his or her 
employers?
	 15.	The topic of cross-function teams was discussed in this text. It was postulated 
that nowadays teams are the most appropriate organizational structure for 
managers to deploy in promoting and realizing innovations, be it in conjunc-
tion with new service/product development, new process improvement, service 
design, problem solving, or other such efforts needed on a continuous basis to 
meet the challenges of the future. In fact, without innovation, companies will 
soon cease to have long-term profitability in the absence of relative competitive-
ness in the marketplace. Thus, it is imperative that future managers must know 
how to lead teams effectively. Explain what is required for teams to become 
innovative and to be able to create synergies that are otherwise not readily 
attainable.

Appendix 10.A: DeepThink Question-Based Prompts
	
1.	Delve: To delve is to dip deeper down to the component and subcomponent levels 
of an idea/concept in order to exploit the interfaces therebetween, and the roles 
and value contributed by these parts. Ask the questions:
 
a.	 Can some of these components be removed without affecting the value of the 
whole idea? What is not necessary?
	
b.	 What might be missing? What could be added to heighten the idea’s novelty?

properly modified?
	
e.	 Which new insights could I discover, compile, or extract, to magnify the nov-
elty of this idea?
	
4.	Perturb: To perturb is to seek novelty improvement by slightly modifying the con-
cept’s attributes and features. Ask “what-if” questions as follows:
 
a.	 What if I challenge the basic underlining assumptions (major driving forces) 
and constraints (time, power, people) to exploit new possibilities?
	
b.	 Which nuggets of wisdom (e.g., business trend, scenarios, rules, application 
practices, ways of looking at the available knowledge, reasons for some-
thing what works, and how analogies work in different contests) can or 
should be replaced, modified or reapplied, in order to improve the idea’s 
novelty?

385
Creativity and Innovation
	
c.	 What if I do the opposite of what others might do, in order to exploit what 
might happen?
	
d.	 “How can I improve the novelty of a concept by changing one of its features 
(e.g., rules, procedure, focus, plans, process, marketing, approaches involved, 
knowledge nuggets, sequence of operations, time line, physical size, usage com-
plexity, customer accessibility, degree of customization, or value to customers)?
	
e.	 How can I economize by reducing, streamlining, omitting, miniaturizing, or 
deleting something in order to upgrade the concept’s novelty?
	
f.	 What can be magnified, extended, exaggerated, or overstated to enrich the 
novelty of this concept?
	
5.	Transpose: To transpose is invoke lateral thinking by looking at the same concept 
or issue from several different perspectives. Ask:
 
a.	 What do I gain as new insights for possible betterment, if I view the concept at 
hand from the viewpoints of producers, customers, marketers, or competitors? 
What if I reverse the roles?
	
b.	 How can we help customers to identify what they want to buy?
	
c.	 What are the opposite views to those that are current and predominant 
regarding this concept? How can I make use of these opposite views to see 
new opportunities for adding novelty to the idea?
	
d.	 May this idea be reframed in a new way to uncover unexpected new 
possibilities?
	
e.	 What would happen, if I did the unexpected?
	
f.	 What can be learned if a higher-level perspective is adopted—instead of look-
ing at individual trees, glancing at the forest?

applications?
	
b.	 Which ideas outside of my fields could I harness and adopt for use in the pres-
ent situation?

d.	 Which other ideas does this concept suggest?
	
e.	 What else is like this?
	
f.	 Which different contexts can I put my concept in? 
	
7.	Integrate: To integrate is to combine ideas and concepts in different contexts to 
form new ones. Ask:

cesses, peoples, procedures, power, places, or approaches involved) to cultivate 
the idea’s novelty?

386
Engineering Management
	
b.	 How would this concept work when merged or nested into another one?
	
c.	 What can be combined (e.g., unrelated ideas, goods, services, work processes, 
materials, articles, units, purposes, assortments, applications, and business 
models) to augment the novelty of the idea?
	
d.	 What synergistic combinations could be conceived?
	
e.	 What could I adapt (e.g., part of other processes or ideas)?
	
8.	Nurture: To nurture is to modify and adjust separate and unrelated concepts/ideas 
to form something new. Ask:
 
a.	 How could I modify unrelated concepts and make them compatible to one 
another, so that they together form increasingly novel ideas?
	
b.	 Could I find opportunities of making these ideas more compatible to one 
another, and hence potentially more novel, by changing some of their respec-
tive features (e.g., meaning, color, motive, sound, focus, attributes, reward 
schemes, shape, name, plans, process, or marketing)?
	
c.	 What would it take for me to make these unrelated concepts compatible to one 
and other?
	
9.	Knock: To knock is to knock down limitations, negative driving forces, assump-
tions, and conventional wisdom, which may have constrained the value of the 
concept. Ask:
 
a.	 How can the idea’s novelty be enhanced by relaxing some of the existing 
assumptions, constraints, negative driving forces, and other barriers and 
restrictions associated with the idea?
	
b.	 Which are the present resources and technologies that are currently constrain-
ing the novelty and value of the concept at hand?
Appendix 10.B: Selected Examples of Creative Ideas That Demonstrate 
the Use of DeepThink Methodologies
	
1.	Delve: Can the components’ topology be modified to achieve more novelty and unique-
ness? Can we separate the various parts of the problem and look closely at the relationships 
between these various parts?
	
	
George Vance of Rock Hill, South Carolina, invented the idea of a seat parti-
tion with a deformable frame aiming at “reducing the interaction” between two 
kids who sit next to one another in the back of a car and keep them under control. 
By applying the strategy of “divide and conquer,” this allows for a quieter atmo-
sphere in the vehicle, so that the driver can better concentrate on driving.
	
2.	Envision: What new possibilities can I project forward for the idea at hand?
	
a.	 What “future” states may be foreseen that differ significantly from the “current” 
state?
	
	
In 1962, J. C. R. Licklider of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, 
envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone 
could quickly access data and programs from any site, the Galactic Network 
concept. Of course, having a vision is necessary but not sufficient for creating

value. A large number of scientists worked on innumerable individual enabling 
technologies (e.g., packet switching, communication protocol, and spanning 
tree algorithm) to develop ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency 
NETwork), the first working version of the Internet in 1969. ARPANET was 
successfully demonstrated to the public in 1972, including the use of e-mails. 
Having a vision into the future is the key here.
	
	
By envisioning a new service for local customers, who are not adequately 
being served by traditional car rental companies, Zipcar was invented by Robin 
Chase. This new service allows its fee-paying members to make reservations, 
pick up a car at GPS-designated locations, drive away, return, sign off, and get 
bills automatically. The cars are usually parked at lots near bus stations, so 
that local customers, who do not own cars or are in need of the service of a sec-
ond one, can get there by public transportation. This rental service is particu-
larly suitable to local customers who want the use of an automobile for a short 
period of time. This car-sharing model is enabled by three technologies: high-
speed Internet, mobile broadband, and GPS. If desired, the customers fill up 
the tank using a special charge card available in the car. A daily or hourly rate 
is charged, including insurance, gas, maintenance, and 24/7 roadside assis-
tance, with a limit of 180 miles per day. The American Automobile Association 
estimated that owning a car costs about $8000 a year. Zipcar customers could 
save $600 per month. Each shared car takes up to 20 cars off the road and they 
could wring out 50% of carbon dioxide emissions. While the car-sharing con-
cept practiced by Zipcar has been novel, the company was eventually absorbed 
by Avis in January 2013 for $500 million.
	
	
Extending the car-sharing concept further, Get Around and RelayRides set 
up to rent out privately owned cars to registered renters on an hourly basis, 
while providing insurance, billing services, and roadside assistance. This ser-
vice model is attractive to those car owners who want to see a better utilization 
of their otherwise idling cars.
 
b.	 What new possibilities (e.g., applications) can I envision for the idea at hand?
	
	
In 1974, Arthur Fry of 3M Company looked closely at the weak glue invented 
by Sheldon Silver, another 3M engineer. The weak glue could not hold two 
pieces of paper together. On a Sunday morning, Fry sang in the church choir 
and wanted to put little pieces of paper in the hymnal to mark the songs he was 
supposed to sing. The pieces of paper often fell out, forcing Fry to frantically 
look for the right page. During a particularly tedious sermon, Fry suddenly 
realized how he might use that weak glue to contrive a reusable bookmark, 
which became the most widely used office product in the world: the Post-it 
note. A new product was thereby invented.
	
c.	 What new possibilities (e.g., satisfying a new marketing demand) can I envision from 
the idea at hand?
	
	
There is a big shortage of family doctors in the United States, partly because 
current insurance policies limit the reimbursement dollars received by fam-
ily doctors. The situation is expected to become worse in the future, as many 
young medical students elect to go into specialty training, avoiding becoming 
general practitioners. Furthermore, all emergency rooms of local hospitals are 
typically very crowded, resulting in hours of waiting time for patients seeking 

388
Engineering Management
emergency care. An inadequately served market niche was thus identified in 
need of emergency care by a variety of families.
	
	
Immediate Care sets up local clinics to care for most non-life-threatening 
injuries and illnesses (e.g., sprains, strains and fractures, cuts and lacerations, 
animal and insect bites, cold and flu symptoms, upper respiratory infections, 
and minor burns) as an emergency room alternative. It is open until 10:00 p.m. 
most days during the week and 8:00 p.m. on weekends. This chain carries the 
gold seal of approval from the Joint Commission and accepts most insurance 
plans. Urgent Care clinics are manned by off-duty doctors and nurses, daily 
until midnight, to care for patients under the age of 21. Family Care Medicine 
is another such group practice that offers competing medical care services. 
MinuteClinic are nurse-managed kiosks, which provide diagnosis of and pre-
scription for two common ailments. They become available in shopping malls 
to compete against the busy doctor’s practices.
	
	
These novel business models are formulated to address an identifiable mar-
ket need, which is not being satisfied by the current medical practice.
	
3.	Exchange and integrate: Exchange: To swap new concepts with what is currently available. 
Integrate: To combine ideas and concepts in different contexts to form new ones.
	
a.	 What can be combined to form a new novel concept?
	
	
Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press by having coupled the 
flexibility of a coin punch with the power of a wine press, thus enabling 
the production of books, which spread knowledge and ideas throughout the 
world.
	
	
Trevor Bayliss invented the clockwork radio, which can be mechanically 
wound up by hand. This is particularly useful to people living in an area 
where there is no or little electricity.
	
	
The Segway Personal Transporter combines the technologies of battery, 
gyroscope, electronic control, and electrically driven scooter to contrive a new 
device, which offers transportation service to a user in a standing-up position.
 
b.	 What can be added to its marketing elements (e.g., physical evidence, delivery, people—
Figure 2.8) to augment the novelty of the idea?
	
	
Starbucks offers a pleasant environment attractive to its target customers, 
who want to enjoy coffee and a place to read, relax, or work. Its well-trained 
baristas serve as excellent conversation partners. It was a novel idea being dif-
ferent from its competitors by zeroing in on the service marketing elements of 
“physical evidence” and “people.”
	
	
A further extension of this idea is to have Starbucks shops inside Barnes 
& Noble book stores, so that customers may browse over a variety of books 
of interest while having a comfortable place to sit and enjoy food and drinks. 
Starbucks have also been added to some hospitals to serve the medical profes-
sionals and patients there.
	
	
It is of course also known that the Hooter Restaurant chain applied the 
same concept of enhancing the “physical evidence” and “people” of its service 
environment by employing young attractive waitresses with shapely figures to 
serve food and drinks.

Progressive Insurance introduced the immediate response vehicle, which 
allows its adjuster to reach the spot of an auto accident, settle the claim, and 
write a check to its policyholder instantly. This service delivery mode lowers 
cost and builds a positive customer experience, as its policyholders avoid long 
waits related to paperwork and other administrative hassles.
	
	
Southwest Airlines does not assign seats. Instead, it requires passengers to 
electronically check-in within 24 hours of flight departure, receive a boarding 
pass that carries an assigned boarding number, and board the plane accord-
ingly. The first 15–20 slots are typically reserved for passengers who are will-
ing to pay an extra small fee. At each terminal gate, vertical signposts were 
erected to implement this sped-up boarding process, so that the same termi-
nal gate may be used for more Southwest flights during the day, thus reduc-
ing the overhead charge for each flight. Furthermore, this process encourages 
passengers to arrive earlier at the gate, as they are in competition with other 
passengers for good seats. By modifying one part of the service delivery step, 
Southwest Airlines realized a betterment of customer experience, a shortening 
of gate time, and a reduction in operations costs.
	
4.	Harness: What analogies may be drawn here? How can a technique in one area be applied 
to a new domain?
	
	
“The inventor has a logical mind that sees analogies,” Thomas Edison said. In 
applying the thinking process of “analogies,” one should try to remember cer-
tain ideas, actions, program steps, or technologies, which were known to us in 
other applications (e.g., other service offerings, other product organizations, and 
even applications in unrelated fields), but which could be applicable to the current 
project here. If so, by all means write it down and add them to the section. Using 
such “analogies” is a useful strategy for coming up with innovative ideas. In fact, 
applying a known idea, pattern, or relationship to a different field is one of the 
most commonly known pathways to creativity. The following three examples are 
noteworthy:
	
	
Nissan crash-avoidance technology mimics bumblebee instincts—the American 
Free Press (10/1/08) reported that “Nissan Motor Co. has tapped into an unlikely 
source of inspiration for technology to prevent car crashes—bumblebees.” The 
BR23C (Biomimetic Car Robot Drive) “is a meter-high duckling-shaped robot with 
a sensor that recreates the highly complex eyes of a bumblebee,” and “can detect 
an object up to two meters away in a 180-degree radius. It swerves away on wheels 
when a person or an object suddenly appears in front of it.” The automaker “hopes 
eventually to put the technology into cars.” Toshiyuki Ando, a Nissan engineer 
said, “The split second it detects an obstacle, it will instantly change direction by 
turning its wheels to a right angle or further to avoid collision. The whole process 
is to mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees. It must happen with the blink 
of an eye. ‘Nissan’ teamed up with researchers from the University of Tokyo to 
advance part of the system, which calculates the distance to an object and then 
sends the information back into the car.”
	
	
Cannon copier drum design: A group of Cannon copier designers took a break to 
brainstorm, while holding cans of beer in their hands. One of them got the inspi-
ration of making the copier drum, which represents 90% of the copier reliability

problem, disposable. This is a good example of innovation by analogy, sometime 
accidentally.
	
	
Tough ceramics: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory mimicked the structure 
of the mother of pearl to invent a tougher ceramic. They applied the controlled 
freezing of suspensions in water of an aluminum oxide (alumina) and the addition 
of a polymer, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), to produce ceramics 300 times 
tougher than their constituent components.
	
	
Air-conditioning: Willis Carrier was waiting for his train to arrive. He was 
watching as the fog was rolling in across the platform. He realized suddenly that 
he could use the principles of fog to cool buildings. He invented the idea of cooling 
building using fog. This was an invention by analogy.
	
	
NASA mirror correction: The mirror of NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope was 
found to have been ground improperly after the telescope was already launched 
into space in 1990, and brought about an embarrassing blurry vision to its users. 
NASA engineer James Crocker was taking a shower in a German hotel room and 
noticed the extendable shower hand, which could be adjusted to the user’s height. 
Crocker made an analogy between this extendable shower hand and the myopic 
telescope and invented the idea of placing corrective mirrors on automated arms 
that would reach inside the telescope and adjust it to the correct position. The 
corrective optics space telescope axial replacement (COSTAR), which comprises 8 
motors attached to 5 metal arms holding 10 coin-sized mirrors, was able to solve 
the telescope problem.
	
	
Velcro fastener: George deMestral noticed in 1948 that burdock burrs stuck to his 
dog’s fur with tiny hooks. He borrowed this idea and generated the same effect 
artificially. Today, shoes and other objects are fastened with burr-like hooks and 
cloth-like loops.
	
	
Dyson vacuum cleaners are designed to remove dust from the airstream by cen-
trifugal forces, analogous to that used in the cyclones for sawdust separation at 
sawmills.
	
5.	Nurture: What would it take for me to make these unrelated concepts compatible with one 
and other?
	
	
Toyota invented the hybrid engines by modifying the international combustion 
engine, which burns fuel to cause a shaft to turn (in order to drive a car), and 
adjusting an electric generator, which uses the excess shaft power to produce elec-
tricity for a battery or withdraws power from the battery to operate the generator 
as a motor in order to turn the shaft. Working together as a unit, it realizes fuel 
savings, as the car is often idling at red lights or stuck in traffic jams on highways.
	
	
Fusion music is put together by merging together different music of the East and 
West. It offers something fresh to the listeners away from traditional concerts and 
adds to the globalization concept.
	
6.	Knock: How can the idea’s novelty be enhanced by relaxing some of the existing assumptions?
	
	
Who says that airline passengers should depart and return between two cit-
ies? JetBlue relaxes this conventional assumption by introducing a novel “all you 

391
Creativity and Innovation
can jet” pass for $600, which allows passengers to book an unlimited number of 
flights between any of its 56 U.S. destinations within a period of one month. For 
business travelers who plan to visit a number of cities quickly, such a pass may be 
ideal. This is similar to the business models of (1) all you can eat (cafeteria), (2) all 
you can exercise (fitness centers), (3) all you can drive (rental cars with no mileage 
limits), and (4) all you can read anywhere (Amazon’s Kindle).
	
	
All households accumulate items that are not used frequently but are kept 
within reach. They take up valuable space and make their surroundings look clut-
tered. The Storage by the Box company challenged the assumption of having to 
keep such items locally at home and came up with the service idea of box storage 
at remote locations. Customers are persuaded to pack unused items in boxes and 
send these boxes via FedEx to a Chicago-based warehouse for safekeeping. The 
boxes are numbered and can be retrieved on demand. Customers are advised to 
take photos of the boxed items in order to facilitate their future retrieval. The com-
pany charges only for the space used, saving customers up to 60% on storage costs. 
This is one way of thinking outside of the box.
	
	
Shoes are typically packed in inexpensive cardboard boxes, which are easily 
damaged, nontransparent, and readily replaced. This assumption was removed 
by Shoebby, which makes their shoeboxes out of thin-gauge clear plastic sheets, so 
that their contents are easily recognized from a distance, thus facilitating a rapid 
selection by their users.
	
7.	Transpose: How can I invigorate the customer’s acceptance of this service idea?
 
a.	 How can we help customers to identify what they want to buy?
	
	
Wal-Mart built a knowledge base (e.g., social genome), which data-mines 
customers profiles from social media (e.g., Tweets blogs, Facebook messages, 
and You Tube videos) to identify consumption and then propose gift ideas to 
customers.
 
b.	 How can we encourage shopper traffic to retail stores?
	
	
ShopKick offers a smartphone application that utilizes closed-circuit 
store networks to recognize customers when they enter the store and reward 
them with in-store offers and “Kickbucks,” which are redeemable points 
that customers collect. This system is being applied at Best Buy, Macy’s, and 
Target.
	
c.	 How can we sell more by promoting users’ self-expression and reaching customers’ 
friends
	
	
Uniglo devised a web page to enable its customers to connect with one another. 
Customers could upload their photos while wearing the new Uniglo cloth-
ing to participate in contests, which are rated by other users. Naturally, they 
will also send the photos to their friends via a smartphone application, a free 
“word of mouth” advertisement for the company.
	
8.	Perturb, integrate, and transpose: Perturb: How can I improve the novelty of a concept by 
changing one of its features? Integrate: How can I selectively combine things to improve the 
idea’s novelty? Transpose: How do I gain as new insights for possible betterment, if I view 
the concept at hand from the viewpoint of the customers?

Economy-class passenges of long flights are known to suffer from having to 
sleep in an upright sitting position. Air New Zealand invented the idea of remov-
ing the arm rests and adding large flip up cushions that fill the space between 
three standard economy seats to create Skycouch, which provides a flat space of 
156 cm long and 76 cm wide. It is priced at 2.5 economy seats, particularly attrac-
tive to families with young children. About 30 international airlines are said to 
want to license this new seat design in 2012.

Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
11.1  Introduction
Recent corporate scandals published on the Internet have raised serious questions about 
ethics in the workplace, notably the cases of Enron, Global Crossing, Adelphia, Arthur 
Anderson, Tyco International, Gallon Insider trading, the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme, 
and others—all alleged to have falsified financial data or misused corporate funds. Steps 
have been taken by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to tighten the finan-
cial audit guidelines for the future. Not too long ago, two top editors of The New York 
Times resigned because they had failed to rein in one of their staffers who had fabricated 
or plagiarized three dozen stories over a six-month period. Exposure of these cases in the 
news media causes public anxiety and apprehension. But the focus of the public’s attention 
on ethics in the workplace should help motivate managers to avoid willful wrongdoing 
(Hosmer 2010; Ferrell and Fraedrich 2014).
As the markets in the new millennium become more dynamic and business relation-
ships increasingly intertwined, opportunities for conflicts of interest and ethical dilemmas 
are likely to become more prevalent. This chapter addresses some of the issues and solu-
tion strategies related to ethics in business and engineering management (Parboteech and 
Cullen 2012; Trevino and Nelson 2010).
Recently, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press in Washington, DC, con-
ducted a survey, asking: “Would you say most business executives try to obey the laws 
governing their professions, or do they try to find a way around the laws?” Thirty-five 
percent of respondents said they obey the laws, 58% said they find a way around the laws, 
and 7% offered no answer. In terms of whose interests the companies put first, the survey 
identified a drastic difference between the public’s perceptions of current practices and 
what they perceived the right emphasis should be. For example, current practices for top 
executives, stockholders, employees, and customers (regarding whose interests the com-
panies put first), was 43%, 37%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. On the other hand, the perceived 
right emphasis for them turned out to be 3%, 14%, 31%, and 37%, respectively.
In a 2014 Gallup Poll, the public were asked to assess the honesty and ethical standards 
among professions. The top 11 ranked professions, in descending order, were (1) nurses, 
(2) medical doctors, (3) pharmacists, (4) police officers, (5) clergy, (6) bankers, (7) lawyers, 
(8) business executives, (9) advertising practitioners, (10) car salespeople, and (11) members 
of Congress.
There are numerous situations in which engineers and engineering managers may 
encounter problems with ethics. These situations include public safety and welfare, risks, 
health and environment, conflicts of interest, truthfulness, integrity, choice of a job, loyalty, 

396
Engineering Management
gift giving and taking, confidentiality, industrial espionage, trade secrets, discrimination, 
and professional responsibility.
Generally speaking, there are both microethical and macroethical issues. In microeth-
ics, the focus is on the relationships among engineers and their coworkers, clients, and 
employers. In macroethics, engineers are concerned with the collective social responsibil-
ity of the profession in relation to, for example, product liability, sustainable development, 
globalization, and the impact of technology. Sustainable development refers to industrial 
practices that minimize harmful impacts on the environment while maximizing the effi-
ciency of energy and material use. This chapter will address both types of issues.
In the research literature, two basic approaches are taken to handling ethical issues: 
addressing the general philosophy underlying a particular outlook, and examining spe-
cific cases to draw out lessons related to ethics. There are weaknesses in both approaches. 
The philosophical approach lacks a connectedness to the real-world environment, and 
thus produces no guidelines to deal with actual situations. On the other hand, the case-
based approach produces only “school solutions” after the fact. These may or may not 
generate any useful lessons to be learned (Harris et al. 2013). Since there are a number 
of well-known cases related to ethics, this second approach is selected for use in this 
chapter.
Not all problems in ethics have practical solutions, just as not all product design problems 
have feasible solutions. Furthermore, as more and more companies pursue globalization, 
an additional concern is that what is “normal” in one culture may not translate acceptably 
to another (Brenkert and Beauchamp 2012).
In this chapter, the deliberations about ethics begin with basic definitions, followed 
by discussions about engineering ethics, which are then extended to business ethics. 
The chapter concludes with general guidelines on dealing with ethical issues.
11.2  Ethics in the Workplace
Ethics is important to corporations because companies with strong, positive overall repu-
tations attract and keep the best customers, employees, suppliers, and investors (Bredeson 
and Goree 2011). These companies also avoid the trouble of litigation, fines, recalls, bank-
ruptcy proceedings, and antitrust suits. Corporations are made up of employees; what 
employees say and do creates the corporate reputation.
Ethics is everything. Marilee Jones, dean of admission at MIT from 1997 to 2007, was 
asked to resign because she failed to correct false claims contained in her resume regard-
ing three college degrees which she had not actually earned.
Corporations take steps to address ethics-related issues. According to Schwartz (2002), 
over 90% of large U.S. corporations have formulated company-specific codes of ethics. This 
trend is expanding to corporations in other countries as well. For example, in Canada, the 
United Kingdom, Germany, and France, the percentage of companies with codes of ethics 
is 85, 57, 51, and 30, respectively. A code of ethics is a formal, written document that con-
tains normative guidelines for behavior. Publishing and implementing such a code allows 
a corporation to provide a set of consistent standards for employees to follow, both to avoid 
any adverse legal consequences due to possible wrongdoings and to promote a wholesome 
public image. Harry Emerson Fosdick said, “No virtue is more universally accepted as a 
test of good character than trustworthiness.”

397
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
11.2.1  Universal Moral Standards
Whether a code of ethics contains right or wrong guidelines depends on the benchmark 
standards used to make the assessment. Schwartz (2002) has assembled a set of universal 
moral standards that appear to be intuitively correct.
These standards include six elements: (1) trustworthiness (honesty, integrity, reliabil-
ity, and loyalty), (2) respect (respect for human rights), (3), responsibility (accountability), 
(4) fairness (process impartiality and equity), (5) caring (avoiding unnecessary harm), and 
(6) citizenship (obeying laws and protecting the environment). By using such a set of univer-
sal moral standards as a yardstick, different codes of ethics can be compared and evaluated.
Ethics in the workplace may be discussed within three different scopes—ethics in 
engineering, management, and business—depending on the expected complexity of the 
situation and the potential impact on stakeholders.
11.2.2  Engineering Ethics
Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) professionals, including engineers, 
play key roles in the advancement, production, and use of technology. They should there-
fore assume a degree of responsibility for the consequences of applied technologies. 
Fleddermann (2011) and Harris et al. (2013) address different aspects related to engineer-
ing ethics.
Engineering companies publish codes of ethics to guide engineers in performing their 
work in an ethically and socially responsible manner. A large number of engineering 
societies, such as the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), the American 
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), 
and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), have also issued codes of 
ethics to provide discipline-specific guidelines. In addition, the files of NSPE’s Board of 
Ethical Review contain various types of issues in engineering ethics and their respective 
resolutions.
Pinkus et al. (1997) have noted that there are three principles of engineering ethics: 
competency, responsibility, and public stewardship. Competency means that engineers 
are obliged to know as much as is reasonably possible about the technology with which 
they work. They should be honest and candid enough to acknowledge their own defi-
ciencies and seek assistance from others to fill in any gaps. Responsibility requires that 
engineers voice their concerns when an ethical dilemma is identified. Responsible organi-
zations must then evaluate these concerns promptly. With respect to public stewardship, 
engineers must understand the risks associated with the technology that they deploy.
A key concept in engineering ethics is the notion of professional responsibility, a type of 
moral obligation arising from the special responsibility possessed by an individual engi-
neer. According to Whitebeck (2011), this moral responsibility requires that engineers exer-
cise judgment and care to achieve and maintain a desirable state of affairs, as well as to 
protect public health and safety.
A large number of U.S. engineering schools are now actively involved in teaching eth-
ics in undergraduate curricula. The Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology 
(ABET) reviews and accredits countless engineering school programs in the United States 
on a regular basis. ABET has defined a specific program outcome related to ethics in its 
Engineering Criteria 2000. This program prescribes that graduates are to have an under-
standing of professional and ethical responsibility and the broad education necessary to 
understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context. The ABET 

398
Engineering Management
Engineering Criteria 2000 have been implemented since the fall of 2001. Its contents include 
the following 11 outcomes:
	
1.	Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering.
	
2.	Design and conduct experiments, as well as analyze and interpret data.
	
3.	Design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs.
	
4.	Function on multidisciplinary teams.
	
5.	Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.
	
6.	Understand professional and ethical responsibility.
	
7.	Communicate effectively.
	
8.	Have the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering 
solutions in a global and societal context.
	
9.	Recognize the need for, and have the ability to engage in, lifelong learning.
	 10.	Have knowledge of contemporary issues.
	 11.	Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineer-
ing practice. 
Teaching ethics to engineering students is aimed at achieving four outcomes: (1) 
raising ethical sensitivity, (2) increasing knowledge about relevant standards of con-
duct, (3) improving ethical judgment (e.g., by way of discussions of real-world cases), 
and (4) strengthening ethical willpower to enable a greater capability to act ethically. 
Teaching ethics illustrates real-world complex relationships between technology devel-
opment and the welfare of individuals, society, and the environment. It also promotes 
an understanding of the professional nature of engineering and of the responsibilities 
associated with a professional career. It enhances the engineers’ abilities to analyze situ-
ations that raise questions about ethics and to articulate reasonable ways to respond to 
ethical dilemmas.
In recent years, there have been a number of major engineering ethics cases reported 
in the engineering and business literature. Table 11.1 lists some sample cases. The case 
method of teaching ethics encourages students to express ethical opinions, prompts them 
to identify ethical issues, and helps them formulate and justify decisions in an effectual 
manner. The case method also seeks to strengthen students’ sense of the practical context 
of ethics.
	
1.	The Hooker Chemical case: Located in Niagara Falls, New York, Love Canal was 
10  feet deep, 60  feet wide, and 3000  feet long and surrounded by a virtually 
impervious clay soil. Hooker Chemical obtained permission to use the canal 
for dumping waste chemicals in 1942 and subsequently acquired a strip of land 
200 feet wide with the canal in the center. Hooker sealed chemical wastes into 
steel drums, dropped them into the canal, and covered them with a layer of clay. 
Approximately 22,000 tons were deposited from 1942 to 1953. At the time, there 
were no federal or state regulations governing the dumping of chemical wastes 
(Beck 1979).
	
	
In 1953, Hooker closed the dump and sold the land to the city’s board of edu-
cation for $1 after the board threatened to condemn the land. Hooker included a 
clause in the deed to the board describing the past use of the land and required 

399
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
that the board assume the risk of liability for any future claims that might result 
from the buried chemicals.
	
	
Subsequently, the board constructed a school on part of the land and sold the 
remainder to a developer, who built homes for families. None of the homes were 
built directly over the canal. In 1978, traces of chemicals were noted on the sur-
face of the land. Residents complained of increased rates of miscarriage, birth 
defects, urinary tract infections, and other health-related problems. In August 
1978, President Carter declared Love Canal a limited disaster area. Federal inves-
tigators took 5000 soil samples but failed to establish a direct link with the buried 
chemicals.
	
2.	The Hyatt Regency Walkways case: During a dance party in July 1981, two walkways 
suspended over the atrium of the hotel lobby collapsed, killing 114 people and 
injuring 185 others. Detailed investigations indicated that the mechanical sup-
ports for the walkways were insufficiently designed for the anticipated loads. The 
license of the engineering firm responsible for the design was revoked (Pfrang 
and Marshall 1982).
	
3.	The space shuttle Challenger case: In the well-known space shuttle Challenger 
explosion case, the night before the launch, Morton Thiokol engineers had 
identified the potential danger of launching the shuttle in temperatures less 
than 53°F. NASA management challenged the recommendation. During an off-
line discussion among Morton Thiokol participants in Utah, a vice president 
of engineering was the only one among four to hold out for a launch delay. 
A senior vice president told him bluntly, “It’s time to take off your engineering 
hat and put on your management hat.” The vice president capitulated, and the 
launch went forward, resulting in the disaster on record. This episode and the

anecdote about engineering and management “hats” are now widespread in 
the literature on engineering ethics (Rossow 2012).
11.2.3  Management Ethics
Should there be any difference between engineering ethics and management ethics? Not 
a lot, except that managers must consider broader issues and deal with ethical situations 
more complicated than those typically encountered by individual engineers and STEM 
professionals. Leigh (2013) and Schminke (2010) include some discussion on management 
ethics.
In the space shuttle Challenger case, the Morton Thiokol management standpoint was as 
follows. The company was a contractor to NASA and had clearly expressed its technical 
concerns related to the launch. Even though the recommendation was not fully supported 
by available data, the company did fully discharge its moral and ethical responsibility in 
the O-ring issue. The proper role for Morton Thiokol was, indeed, to respect the view of 
its client. If NASA, as the paying client, decided to launch the shuttle anyway, then the 
responsibility for any negative consequences rested entirely with NASA.
From the NASA management standpoint, the O-ring issue was technically not 
supportable by data. On the other hand, NASA had its mission goals to fulfill. Under 
such circumstances, someone made a decision under uncertainty based on gut feeling 
and personal experience in risk assessment. Unfortunately, the decision turned out to be 
wrong. However, management is paid to make such hard decisions under uncertainty.
Generally speaking, engineering managers consider factors related to the well-being 
of the organization, such as cost, schedule, employee morale, customers, supply chains, 
investors, public image, local communities, health and safety, social and environmental 
impacts, market development, profitability, and globalization. Engineers and STEM pro-
fessionals, on the other hand, focus on technical matters that fall within their professional 
engineering practices, such as product design, production, technology, public health and 
safety, and environmental impact.
Example 11.1
The ocean liner SS United States was a luxurious ship in the 1950s. It had approximately 
one-half-million square feet of harmful asbestos insulation. Initial estimates indicated 
that it would cost $100 million to have it refurbished in the United States. In 1992, it was 
towed to Turkey, where the cost of removing the asbestos was quoted at only $2 million. 
Turkish officials, however, refused to allow the removal because of the danger of expo-
sure to the cancer-causing asbestos. In October 1993, the ship was towed to the Black 
Sea port of Sebastopol, where laws were lax and the removal of asbestos would cost less 
than $2 million.
Do you approve of the program that removed asbestos from the SS United States at 
Sebastopol? Why, or why not?
Answer 11.1
The ethically correct answer is to disapprove. The removal of asbestos at Sebastopol 
was economically attractive for the shipowner, because the local laws did not require 
specific safeguards and safe processes needed for effectively protecting the health of 
workers. Thus, the cost saving was derived by taking advantage of the ignorance of the 
local people and the inadequacy of the local laws. The program had the potential for 
damaging the health of workers at Sebastopol, a blatant violation of core human rights. 
It should have been rejected without reservation.

Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
11.2.4  Ethics in Business
As engineering managers move up the corporate ladder, they become more and more 
involved in influential decision-making that extends beyond the traditional domains of 
engineering and technology. Guidelines related to ethics in business kick in at that time to 
help shape the decision-making.
Such situations arise from the fact that business management must take care of the broad 
interests of five stakeholder groups: shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, and 
people in local communities in which the company operates. Business managers must also 
remain consistent in their professional responsibilities and ethical standards. Note that all 
of these stakeholders are members of society at large, but they represent only a small part 
of it (see Figure 11.1). Thus, inherently, there will be situations in which choices made to 
pursue the interests of these five stakeholder groups may clash with the interests of the 
remaining members of society. Although an ethical company must attempt to eliminate or 
minimize such clashes, conflicts of this type are likely to occur.
In fact, actual situations in real environments are far worse than this. As indicated in 
Table 11.1, questions have been raised concerning the conflicts of interest reflected in the 
management of numerous U.S. corporations. The U.S. public perceive that many compa-
nies unethically put the top managers’ own interests ahead of those of the five major stake-
holder groups. Congress passed the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, the Public Company 
Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act, to more tightly regulate some of the ques-
tionable accounting practices.
Ferrell and Fraedrich (2014) studied 20 business ethics cases, including Bernard Madoff 
(a Ponzi scheme to defraud investors), Enron (corporate financing reporting), and Gallon 
(insider trading to realize illegal gains). Tichy and McGill (2008) offer additional discus-
sions on Arthur Anderson, Tyco International, WorldCom, and Quest.

In September 2015, Volkswagen (VW) admitted that the company had used special soft-
ware to reduce the nitrogen oxide emission of its 11 million diesel trucks so that they would 
fraudulently pass the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards. VW 
stock dropped by 19% following this admission. The company took a charge of $7.2 billion 
and faces a raft of 34 federal lawsuits. It also expects to be further penalized by up to $18 
billion by the government. Early in the year, General Motors (GM) was cited for its faulty 
ignition switches, which had been covered up over many years and had caused the death 
of 124 people and injured hundreds of others. GM was eventually fined $900 million for 
this dishonest practice. Toyota paid $1.2 billion to settle criminal charges related to unin-
tended accelerations of its cars.
McDonald (2014), Shaw (2010), and Hoffman et al. (2014) offer additional viewpoints 
related to business ethics.
11.3  Guidelines for Making Tough Ethical Decisions
Everyone could use guidelines when making tough ethical decisions. Peter Drucker, a 
well-known business management professor, recommends a mirror test. Ask yourself, 
“What kind of person do I want to see when I shave or put on my lipstick in the morning?” 
(Seglin 2000). This method may not deter those violators who are self-serving and who 
apply double standards to justify what they do.
Norman Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin, has proposed four questions to 
gauge how ethical a course of action is:
	
1.	Is it legal?
	
2.	If someone else did it to you, would you think it was fair?
	
3.	Would you be content if it appeared on the front page of your hometown 
newspaper?
	
4.	Would you like your mother to see you do it? 
If you answer “yes” to all four questions, then, according to Augustine, whatever you are 
about to do is probably ethical. Following this method of screening, one is then advised to 
always have the cell phone numbers of a lawyer, the editor of the hometown newspaper, 
and one’s own mother on hand, plus a well-calibrated, unbiased “barometer” of fairness.
Badaracco (2013) believes that character is forged in situations when responsibilities 
come into conflict with values. These situations are called defining moments. At defining 
moments, managers must choose between right and right. Badaracco suggests a set of 
questions for individuals, managers of working groups, and executives of companies to 
answer when evaluating such defining moments:
	
1.	Questions for Individuals Facing Defining Moments
	
What feelings and intuitions come into conflict in this situation?
	
Which of the values in conflict are most deeply rooted in my life?
	
What combination of expediency and shrewdness coupled with imagination and 
boldness will help me implement my personal understanding of what is right?

403
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
	
2.	Questions between Right and Wrong that Managers of Working Groups Must Answer
	
What are the other persuasive interpretations of the ethics of this situation?
	
What point of view is the most likely to win a contest of interpretations inside of 
my organization and influence the thinking of other people?
	
Have I orchestrated a process that can manifest the values I care about in my

Some managers are constantly required to resolve the conflict between discharging their 
responsibility to maximize shareholder value, on the one hand, and behaving in an ethical 
manner, on the other. Bagley (2003) suggests a simple decision tree to guide managers in 
making ethical decisions in any corporate projects (see Figure 11.2).
Bagley advises managers to raise three questions: (1) Is it legal? (2) Does it maximize 
shareholder value? and (3) Is it ethical? Managers should refuse to pursue any project or 
take any action if the answer to any of these questions is “no.” However, managers should 
decide to carry out projects that are legal and ethical, even if these projects do not maxi-
mize shareholder value, as long as pursuing them could benefit the other stakeholders of 
the company (see Figure 11.1). The argument is that managers work for the best interests 
of the company, and these best interests may not always require them to maximize share-
holder value.

Engineering Management
The logic of this decision tree model is rather compelling. But a major weakness of this 
model is that, for some courses of action, the answers to the questions related to share-
holder values and ethics will likely be “maybe” instead of a clear-cut “yes” or “no.”
In the Challenger case, Morton Thiokol engineers and managers argued for a delay of the 
launch due to a suspected O-ring failure under low-temperature conditions. In contrast, 
NASA managers were under pressure to proceed with the launch as scheduled. Numerous 
questions were raised. Did Morton Thiokol have to prove that the flight was unsafe for the 
launch to be delayed? There were no data that could conclusively substantiate the recom-
mendation of a launch delay. Should NASA managers have allowed factors other than 
engineering judgment to influence the flight-schedule decision? From the following two 
options, which stand should NASA have taken? (1) Do not fly if it cannot be shown to be 
safe; (2) fly, unless it can be shown to be unsafe. Certainly, the NASA program objective to 
build the shuttle for about half of the originally proposed cost might also have contributed 
to the decisions that resulted in disaster.
According to the decision tree model presented in Figure 11.2, it is clear that NASA had 
the legal authority to decide. When it comes to the second question, shareholder value, the 
answer was not clear-cut. Two options were under consideration at the time:
	
1.	Launch the shuttle as scheduled. The benefits of a successful launch were expected 
to be the continued enhancement of the value of NASA programs to the American 
people and to the scientific communities, and the preservation of public trust and 
confidence in the capabilities of NASA management. On the other hand, if the 
launch were unsuccessful, then there would be a significant sacrifice of human 
life, the destruction of physical assets, and the loss of the public’s goodwill. 
Perhaps some personnel changes at NASA would have become necessary under 
that scenario.
	
	
The key problem was that neither Morton Thiokol nor NASA had data to con-
firm that the launch would definitely be unsafe. It was only the best judgment of 
Morton Thiokol engineers that the launch might be unsafe. The expected cost of a 
launch failure could not be quantitatively estimated, because there was no reliable 
number for the probability of the O-ring to fail at low temperatures.
	
2.	Delay the launch till temperatures were right. The cost of such a delay would have 
been the loss of public confidence in NASA managerial competency and certain 
operational and equipment maintenance costs associated with a delay. 
Depending on the assumed value of the probability of occurrence for the O-ring failure, 
the expected cost for Option 1 could change. Thus, the question related to shareholder 
value in Figure 11.2 should be answered “maybe.” To move forward from this point on 
would require the introduction of an assumption (usually unproved and likely relying 
on gut feeling or an extrapolation from past experience) related to the probability for the 
O-rings to fail. Determining an accurate probability becomes a judgment call. Apparently, 
NASA management believed that the probability for the O-rings to fail was extremely 
low.
NASA’s assumption of an extremely low probability for the O-rings to fail also led to 
a “yes” answer to the third question related to ethics in Figure 11.2. If this probability of 
O-ring failure had been high, then it would have been unethical for NASA to decide on 
a course of action that would have been likely to lead to the demise of the shuttle crew. 
An academic ethicist (Werhane 1991) evaluated the Challenger disaster and concluded that 

405
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
it was the result of four kinds of difficulties: (1) different perceptions and priorities of 
engineers and management at Thiokol and at NASA; (2) a preoccupation with roles and 
responsibilities on the part of engineers and managers; (3) contrasting corporate cultures 
at Thiokol and its parent, Morton; and (4) a failure by both engineers and managers to 
exercise individual moral responsibility. (For a detailed discussion of the space shuttle 
Challenger case, see Vaughan 1996.) While the decision tree model is generally useful, its 
application can become complicated when conflicts of interest arise among the stakehold-
ers. What happens if value is added to one group of stakeholders at the expense of others? 
The following examples illustrate this type of situation.
	
1.	Some U.S. company boards routinely approve bonus and stock options to top 
managers to offer them extra incentives at the expense of shareholders. This prac-
tice contributes to the distorted corporate emphasis indicated in Table 11.1. Such 
practices are not common in other industrialized countries.
	
2.	When involved in mergers and acquisitions, some top managers negotiate for 
special separation contracts to benefit themselves at the expense of the surviving 
company.
	
3.	Companies outsource manufacturing operations to developing countries where 
environmental and safety regulations are typically less stringent than in the 
United States; this achieves cost advantages for the companies at the expense of 
the communities in which they operate and of the employees in the developing 
countries.
	
4.	Companies sell unsafe automobiles and drug products to consumers, causing 
deaths due to accidents or side effects, while realizing sales revenue and profit-
ability for themselves.
	
5.	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced its settlement 
with 10 Wall Street security firms to restore public trust. These firms agreed, with-
out admitting any wrongdoing, to pay a fine of $1.4 billion for giving biased stock 
investment advice that had caused investors to lose money during the recent past 
and delivered huge financial benefits to the firms involved. 
The troubling point here is that all the decision-makers involved in these cases were 
fully aware of the ethical implications related to their actions. Thus, knowing what is ethi-
cal and what is unethical is clearly only the first step. The decision tree in Figure 11.2 offers 
a logical road map to force a needed critical review of all management decisions. However, 
additional steps beyond making knowledge available are required to ensure that all deci-
sions carried out are ethical at all times and under all circumstances.
11.4  Corporate Ethics Programs
Building an efficacious corporate ethics program requires leadership, commitment, plan-
ning, and execution. According to Navran (1997), companies need to have clear statements 
of their vision and values. They should have an organizational code of ethics. Creating an 
ethics officer position and forming an ethics committee helps communicate the company’s 
ethics strategy, coordinate employee training, maintain a help line to offer confidential 

406
Engineering Management
advice as needed under specific circumstances, monitor and track activities with ethics 
implications, and take action to reward good and punish unethical practices.
More than 90% of all Fortune 500 companies have codes of ethics, and 70% have state-
ments of vision. Companies such as Procter & Gamble, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Texas 
Instruments, John Deere, Cummins Engine, Eaton, and Dow Corning publish codes 
of ethics online. The Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at the Illinois 
Institute of Technology received a grant from the National Science Foundation to design 
and maintain a website, www.ethics.iit.edu/ecodes/about. The site stores 850 codes of 
ethics online, including those issued by engineering associations (Section  11.2.1) and 
corporations.
A corporation’s statement of ethics serves as a behavioral compass for the employees. 
Kinni (2003) recommends a set of guidelines to formulate a code of ethics. Companies 
must first establish their values and direction. To be relevant, a statement of ethics must 
be connected to the core direction in which the organization is going. The code of eth-
ics should be centered on such values as integrity and trustworthiness, instead of being 
merely a compliance document. It should include specifics unique to the business under 
consideration or details about the company philosophy. The company should then go 
public with the code of ethics so that all employees, customers, suppliers, and any other 
stakeholders are fully informed of it. The code of ethics must be updated regularly to 
help guide the day-to-day behavior and decision-making of the employees. The overall 
effectiveness of a statement of ethics depends on the company leaders’ commitment to its 
disciplined enforcement. (Examples of ethics statements can be found in Murphy, 1997.)
It is useful to issue guidelines to handle potentially unethical situations and to set 
clear standards of conduct applicable to daily responsibilities. Employees are advised to 
(1) analyze carefully the situation at hand; (2) list all possible failings and downsides of 
the potentially unethical practice in question; (3) compile all possible benefits that could 
accrue if the practice in question ceases and is admitted now, rather than being discov-
ered by someone else later; (4) issue a memo; and (5) attempt to make a full disclosure to 
coworkers, the superior, the superior’s superior, the company president, the customers, the 
public, and the press.
Besides defining what the employees are expected to do, it is equally important to spell 
out what they should not do. Of specific value is the description of actions that are deemed 
unethical. Setting such lower bounds ensures that there is no ambiguity in interpreting 
what is not allowed. As sample unethical cases from both internal and external sources are 
continuously added to the code of ethics, the resulting casebook will become an increas-
ingly important benchmark reference.
Honeywell has put teeth into its ethical principles by making it mandatory for all employ-
ees to adhere to the company’s code of conduct. Starbucks introduced its Framework for 
a Code of Conduct for coffee-producing countries to standardize ethics practices among 
coffee retailers, exporters, and growers.
Some people believe that it is ineffective for companies to self-police their own codes. 
Instead, there should be an independent monitoring of ethical practices. To deter wrong-
doing, the penalties must be high and the enforcement disciplined. Among examples of 
such penalties are dismissal with charges and forfeiture of all pension rights, a jail term 
with no opportunities for parole, severe financial penalties, and denial of reentry to indus-
tries involved.
There should probably also be more recognition from society for good actions taken 
by companies or individuals. Making ethically sound decisions may have been taken for 
granted by many people for a long time. In 1998, Deloitte/Management Magazine created a 

407
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
Business Ethics Award program in New Zealand, and it has recognized the following com-
panies with best practices in ethics since that time: Norske Skog Tasman in 2002, Methanex 
NZ in 2001, New Zealand Post in 2000, and 3M New Zealand in 1999. More awards of this 
type should be established to honor such people and to reflect society’s appreciation of 
these exemplary ethical behaviors!
In managing corporate ethics programs, the key is to make sure that everyone is honest 
and will disclose fully all of the details of every situation in question. A well-known pub-
lisher suggests a single question as the basis for assessing an ethical situation: “If what I 
just said or neglected to say, did or neglected to do, saw and failed to report, or heard and 
failed to mention, were disclosed openly by someone else in reputable communications 
channels, would it embarrass me, my organization, or my family?” If the answer is “yes,” 
then the action or inaction in question is unethical. This question is likely to be useful for 
honest people with self-respect. However, embarrassment is a personal perception based 
on value. It may not be as useful to white-collar crooks who are driven by greed and 
who are willing and able to circumvent the laws to act unethically. Generally speaking, 
individuals who offer a full disclosure to all concerned are usually ethical (Johnson and 
Phillips 2003).
The commitment of top management to the corporate ethics program is of critical impor-
tance to its success. A case in point is Johnson & Johnson. The company is known for its 
Credo Challenges sessions, in which employees and managers talk about ethics related to 
current business problems and offer criticisms of existing policies and ideas for improve-
ment. The company achieved excellent business results by using this industrial best prac-
tice in the field of ethics.
An opposite case in point is Enron, which had a 65-page code of ethics. Yet, some top 
Enron managers allegedly entered into special business deals with off-balance-sheet 
financing that resulted in a falsely inflated corporate profitability that permitted selected 
management personnel to cash out stock options while siphoning out special bonus pay-
ments to individuals, all eventually at the expense of the company shareholders. Reports 
from internal whistleblowers were simply ignored by Enron top managers, who elected 
to take no corrective action. It was clear to everyone involved that these were unethical 
and illegal management actions. Allegedly acting as its partner in crime, the auditing 
firm Arthur Andersen was also accused of committing the criminal offense of willfully 
destroying Enron papers relevant to the case.
No ethics program will be efficacious unless company top management supports its 
implementation.
Example 11.2
A global job migration trend is starting to develop. Significant numbers of jobs are 
being exported from the United States and other developed countries to such emerging-
economy countries as Mexico, China, India, the Philippines, Ireland, Thailand, and 
Bangladesh. Typical jobs are related to software programming, call center services, 
financial accounting, tax preparation, selected R&D, claims processing, and contract 
production. Other types of jobs may be involved in the future. The principal driving 
force behind the job migration trend is cost: a comparable quality of workmanship may 
be accomplished in emerging economy countries at about one-third the cost of paying 
workers in developed countries.
Does Corporate America display an apparent indifference to its workforce at home? Is 
it unethical for American companies to outsource work in search of cost-effectiveness at 
the expense of American workers?

408
Engineering Management
Answer 11.2
Corporate America is legally empowered to seek cost-effectiveness in creating and mar-
keting products and services, as long as it is doing so in compliance with laws and com-
monly accepted ethics standards. Because of the free market system the United States 
practices, Corporate America does not have the obligation to guarantee jobs for any 
sector of American workers, be they engineers, software programmers, accountants, 
claims-processing clerks, call center service personnel, or factory workers. If certain 
sectors of employment appear to be declining because of global competition, the work-
ers in these affected sectors must be able to learn new skills quickly to keep themselves 
competitive in the job market. Past cases with textile, steel, and agriculture workers are 
typical examples of sector-specific decline due to globalization.
The job protection concept may be appropriate in a socialist system, wherein the gov-
ernment exercises control over the economy, but it is not appropriate in a free market 
economy. By outsourcing, Corporate America does not display an apparent indifference 
to its workforce at home. It is not unethical for American companies to outsource work.
11.5  Affirmative Action and Workforce Diversity
Related to corporate ethics is the issue of affirmative action. The law is very clear on this 
issue. In 1964, the Civil Rights Act was enacted to ban discrimination on the basis of a 
person’s color, race, national origin, religion, or sex. The Equal Employment Opportunity 
Act was passed in 1972, empowering the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC) to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The EEOC directives do not allow dis-
crimination in hiring, placement, training, advancement, compensation, or other activities 
against any person on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disabil-
ity, marital status, or any other such characteristic protected by law. These acts have been 
enforced, and progress in affirmative action has been made over the last several decades 
(Byrd and Scott 2014; Ferdman and Deane 2013).
For the past 30 years or more, a number of private colleges and universities have intro-
duced race-sensitive admissions policies to increase the number of African-American, 
Hispanic, and Native American students they enroll. Bowen et al. (1999) defend such policies 
on the grounds that these institutions have the right to define the preferred composition of 
their student bodies. In recent years, there have been more state or institutional actions taken 
against such policies. In 1996, California abolished affirmative action programs and decided 
to stop using race and gender as college admission factors. Washington State followed the 
Californian example in 1998. In 2000, Florida joined this anti-affirmative action movement.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, excluded white stu-
dents from its annual summer mathematics and science programs for incoming fresh-
men and high school students. In 2002, a complaint was filed with the Department of 
Education’s Office of Civil Rights. Subsequently, MIT opened the programs to all students.
The University of Michigan has a well-known undergraduate admissions policy that 
allows 12 points for a perfect SAT score and adds 20 points if the applicant happens to 
be black, Hispanic, or Native American, but assigns no points for being white or Asian. 
Figure 11.3 illustrates the changing race and ethnicity composition of undergraduate stu-
dents admitted to the University of Michigan. The United States Supreme Court announced 
its famous “split decision” in 2003: the vote was against the points system, but in favor of 
a race-based admissions policy for the University of Michigan Law School to use in the 

409
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
absence of a points system. Proponents on both sides of this issue were able to claim vic-
tory. Is it fair to those white students whose admissions were denied just because of their 
race and ethnicity? Questions such as this remain unresolved.
Even after companies allow more minorities and women to gain entry, there is still an 
atmosphere of tension, instability, and distrust between white and nonwhite managers, 
according to Carver and Livers (2002). Minority managers have a high turnover rate, and 
they encounter deep-rooted, complex, and highly personal attitudes and assumptions in 
their coworkers.
Thomas (1990) argues that companies need to move beyond affirmative action and to 
strive for equal opportunities for everyone in the workforce as a way of creating com-
petitive advantage in a global economy. Globalization may, indeed, precipitate workforce 
diversification and force everyone to work with everyone else, regardless of values, cul-
ture, race, or gender. Thomas and Ely (1996) indicate that companies should use the inte-
gration paradigm to promote equal opportunities for all people, promote open discussion 
of diverse cultural issues, eliminate all forms of domination (by hierarchies, race, gender, 
etc.) that inhibit full contribution, and secure organizational trust.
For sure, this debate will rage on. In the meantime, engineering managers are well 
advised to constantly treat everyone and every situation honestly and fairly and to value 
each person’s contributions properly.
11.6  Global Issues of Ethics
The problems of ethics are broader in complexity and scope for companies with a global 
reach than for companies that operate domestically. This is because the values, business 
practices, laws, environmental and safety standards, and other related references for mak-
ing ethical decisions differ depending on the countries involved (Moliterno and Platon 
2014; Widdows 2014).

Engineering Management
Engineering managers encounter problems with global ethics implications in a num-
ber of ways. Some problems related to product safety, plant operations, environmental 
discharges, work rules, and child labor are to be expected. Managers may need to inter-
act with local governments with respect to permits, customs, transportation services, and 
procurement of parts and materials. They may also need to set up local supply chains and 
require all local participants to comply with specific codes of conduct.
Take environmental standards as an example. Countries that are economically active 
consume a disproportionate amount of energy and natural resources per capita compared 
with emerging economy countries. According to the World Bank’s Little Green Data Book 
for 2003, America uses 16 times as much energy per person than India. About 15% of the 
world’s population living in rich countries are responsible for 50% of the overall emissions 
of carbon dioxide, the principal gas behind global warming. The question may be asked 
whether it is ethical and socially responsible for the economically active countries to pol-
lute more than others.
Another example is related to values and business practices. Figure 11.4 displays the 
study results of Transparency International, a Berlin-based organization. According to this 
worldwide study, the least ethically corrupted country is Finland, followed by Singapore, 
and then Great Britain, Hong Kong, Germany, and the United States.

Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
Yet another problem that has global ethics implications has to do with the law. In 1977, 
the U.S. Congress enacted the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which requires American 
parent companies and their foreign subsidiaries to abide by certain business standards 
(Koehler 2014). This act has three provisions:
	
1.	Recordkeeping and disclosure provision: This provision requires that companies shall 
“make and keep books, records and accounts, which, in reasonable details, accu-
rately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the issu-
ers.” Not recording and disclosing payments (such as bribes) ma…de to foreign 
recipients is an offense clearly prosecutable under this provision.
	
2.	Internal controls provision: This provision prescribes that companies have audit 
committees composed of independent, outside members of their boards of direc-
tors to provide independent financial audits. Not exercising proper managerial 
control in the use of funds (such as accepting bribes or other illegal payments) is a 
violation of this provision.
	
3.	Antibribery provision: This provision prohibits payments to foreign officials, for-
eign political candidates, or foreign political parties intended to corrupt those 
recipients who act in favor of the companies. Doing so is against the Act even if it 
does not violate the laws of the respective countries involved. However, “grease 
payments” in the form of entertainment expenses and small gift items to minor 
officials are generally allowed for the purpose of facilitating transactions. The Act 
is silent with respect to the actual dollar amount above which this provision is 
deemed to be violated, leaving such interpretations to the courts. 
The Act regards the integrity of management as a material factor. Engineers and engi-
neering managers need to become familiar with and sensitized to these provisions when 
engaged in interactions with foreign personnel. When in foreign countries, the applicable 
local laws must be obeyed as well. Thus, it should be self-evident that any course of action 
that violates any laws, either of the home country or of the host country, must not be 
undertaken.
The issue related to the bribery of foreign public officials is a troublesome one. Some 
researchers, such as Tarun (2014), have questioned the positive impact of the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act on overall standards of international business conduct, particularly 
with respect to the bribery of foreign public officials.
Problems involving environmental discharge or child labor may cause engineering 
managers to be fearful of another law. The Alien Tort Claims Act has been used to pros-
ecute U.S. companies for alleged human rights violations and environmental degradation 
abroad. Olsen (2002) reports three such industrial cases.
Even if all of the actions taken by engineering managers are lawful, it is possible that not 
all lawful business decisions they make are ethical. It is usually quite complex to deter-
mine whether a given course of action taken in a host country is ethical or not, because the 
contrasts between the cultures, values, and customs of the host and home countries come 
into play. A number of examples cited by Donaldson (1996) illustrate these differences:
	
1.	Indonesians tolerate the bribery of public officers. Bribery is considered unethical 
and unlawful in the United States.
	
2.	Belgians do not find insider trading morally repugnant. Insider trading is a 
criminal offense in the United States. For example, Martha Stewart was indicted 

412
Engineering Management
and subsequently convicted for having committed conspiracy, making false 
statements, and obstruction related to her suspicious sales of InClone Systems 
stocks. She resigned as CEO of her company and was sentenced to serve time in 
prison.
	
3.	In some countries, loyalty to a community, a family, an organization, or a society is 
the foundation of all ethical behavior. The Japanese people define business ethics 
in terms of loyalty to their companies, their business networks, and their nation. 
The Japanese are group oriented. In contrast, Americans place a higher value on 
liberty than loyalty and emphasize equality, fairness, and individual freedom 
over group achievements. Americans are focused on individualism.
	
4.	The notion of a right or entitlement evolved with the rise of democracy in post-
Renaissance Europe and the United States. This term does not exist in either 
Confucian or Buddhist traditions.
	
5.	Low wages may be considered by workers in wealthy countries (e.g., the United 
States and Europe) as an exploitation of the workforce, but developing nations 
may be acting ethically when they accept low wages to induce foreign investment 
to improve their living standards.
	
6.	Some emerging economy governments may want to use more fertilizer to enhance 
crop yields to combat food supply shortage problems, even though doing so would 
mean accepting a relatively high level of thermal water pollution.
	
7.	A manager at a large U.S. specialty products company in China caught an employee 
stealing. She followed the company’s practice and turned the employee over to the 
provincial authorities. The provincial authorities executed him.
	
8.	In Japan, people who do business together exchange gifts, sometimes very expen-
sive ones, as part of a long-standing tradition. Any foreign countries wanting to do 
business there will need to accept such practices as given.
	
9.	Managers in Hong Kong have a higher tolerance for some forms of bribery 
than their Western counterparts, but they have a much lower tolerance for the 
failure to acknowledge the work of a subordinate. In some parts of the Far 
East, stealing credit from a subordinate for work or ideas is the most unethical 
activity.
	
	
In the case of The New York Times, a staff writer stole credit by plagiarizing the 
writings of freelance writers and other sources. He did so for an extended period. 
Despite multiple warnings, the responsible editors did nothing to stop this staff 
writer from publishing. Finally, the staff writer resigned, and both editors were 
forced out.
	 10.	Some Indian companies offer employees the opportunity for one of their children 
to get a job with the company once the child has completed a certain grade level 
in school. The company honors this commitment even when other applicants are 
more qualified. This perk would be regarded as nepotism in the United States, 
as it is against the principle of equal opportunity that jobs should go to the best-
qualified applicants. On the other hand, some U.S. universities reserve certain 
admission quotas for children of alumni, major donors, and members of specific 
minorities.
	 11.	The Swiss are known for their time sensitivity, whereas South Americans are 
known for their time laxity.

413
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
	 12.	Forty percent of managers in the United States believe that the primary goal of a 
company is to make a profit, while only 33% in England, 35% in Australia, 11% in 
Singapore, and 8% in Japan share this belief. 
There is a significant divergence in the perceived goals of a company from the manager’s 
perspective. Once a company achieves its financial objectives, how should the money be 
distributed? Table 11.1 illustrates the emphasis of U.S. managers versus those of the gen-
eral public in the United States. The self-centered approach of some U.S. managers could 
cause tensions and conflicts in values when dealing with foreign managers.
There is no international consensus on standards of business conduct (Williams 2000). 
Donaldson (1996) offers three basic principles as guidelines: (a) observing core human 
values, (b) showing respect for local traditions, and (c) focusing on the context when decid-
ing what is right and wrong. Core human values determine the absolute moral thresh-
old for all business activities. These values include the right to good health, economic 
advancement, and an improved standard of living. One must respect human dignity and 
recognize a person’s value as a human being, and not treat others simply as tools. A good 
yardstick to use is the Golden Rule, which says: “Do not do to others what they do not want 
done to themselves.”
This principle requires that customers be treated well through the generation of safe 
products/services, and employees through the maintenance of a safe workplace. Also, the 
local environment should be protected. Companies must avoid employing children and 
thereby preventing them from receiving a basic education. Local economic and education 
systems ought to be supported. Companies should forgo those business relationships that 
violate rights to health, education, and safety and prevent the development of an adequate 
standard of living.
Donaldson (1996) classifies ethics conflicts into two types: conflicts due to relative eco-
nomic development and conflicts due to cultural tradition. Ethical situations of the first 
type are related to wages, safety, and the environment; they arise from a low level of eco-
nomic development in the host country in comparison with the developed home country. 
To determine whether a given course of action is ethical, Donaldson suggests that the 
following question be raised: “Would the course of action under consideration be accept-
able in my home country if our economic development were at the same stage as that of 
the host country?” If the answer is “yes,” then the course of action is ethically acceptable. 
For example, if a specific emerging economy country is currently at the stage comparable 
to the United States in the 1970s, then U.S. rules and regulations related to wages, safety, 
and the environment in practice during the 1970s, not those in the 2010s, should be used 
to assess any situation involving ethical conflicts in that emerging economy country at the 
present time.
From time to time, courses of action must be taken even if they bring about conflicts due 
to cultural tradition if companies want to do business in a given host country. Generally, 
cultural tradition is to be respected and accepted. Saudi Arabia is known not to allow 
women to serve as corporate managers; most women there work in education and health 
care. Most foreigners who do business in Japan have now generally accepted the Japanese 
gift-giving tradition. Of course, compromises made in tradition-based conflicts must not 
violate core human values.
Some companies use a specific gift-giving strategy to be lawful, ethical, and compat-
ible with local cultural tradition while promoting goodwill and fostering close working 
relationships. They elect to present two sets of gifts: a big and very expensive company-
to-company gift and several small personal gifts, each being, for example, under $25.

Engineering Management
Past practices have shown that such an approach seems to work out well for the parties 
involved.
Again, when handling global problems of ethics, the following are the basic questions: 
“Is it legal with respect to laws in both the host and home countries?” “Does the planned 
course of action violate basic human values?” “Is it consistent with the local cultural 
norms?” “Is there a creative way to reconcile the ethics issues at hand?” Figure 11.5 pres-
ents the decision tree diagram for global problems of ethics.
In handling challenging situations involving ethics in global settings, all managers and 
STEM professionals need to uphold core human values, account for the relevant local tra-
ditions, and be creative in problem solving to come up with a suitable and ethically accept-
able course of action without violating laws (Tichy and McGill 2008).
Example 11.3
In the past, Levi Strauss engaged numerous contract manufacturers in emerging econ-
omy countries to produce athletic shoes. The company discovered in 1992 that two sew-
ing subcontractors in Bangladesh employed children under the age of 14 in violation of 
company rules. The local economic conditions were such that the children were contrib-
uting significantly to their family income. If these under-aged children were discharged 
instantly, the lack of these income streams would cause economic hardship to the fami-
lies involved. On the other hand, allowing the children to continue working clearly 
violated the stated company ethics policy prohibiting the employment of child labor.
What should Levi Strauss have done?
Answer 11.3
In fact, Levi Strauss came up with a creative solution to this ethics dilemma. The chil-
dren were sent back to school with tuition, books, and uniforms fully paid for by the 
company. In addition, they continued to receive their full wages. They were promised 
jobs after they completed their education at the age of 14. This creative solution satisfied 
both Levi Strauss and the children’s families.
This is a practical example of the creative steps indicated in Figure 11.5. 
Does it violate the core 
human values?
Is it consistent with 
culture-speciﬁc norms?

Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
Example 11.4
Your company is among several U.S. suppliers actively competing for a major equip-
ment project of a state-owned enterprise in Shanghai worth about $20 million. You 
are introduced to a Chinese “consultant” who offers to help. This consultant claims 
that he has contacts inside the enterprise’s midlevel project evaluation teams and its 
top-level decision-making groups and that he can find out sensitive information for 
you, such as the equipment design features in the competitor’s proposals. He can 
also relate back to you the enterprise’s hints for improvements to your proposal and 
help move your project along in a multiple-round bidding process. If you do not win, 
you owe him nothing. However, if your project succeeds, you must pay him 5% of the 
final project value as a consulting fee. Your peers tell you that such an arrangement 
is quite normal in China and that a large part of the consulting fee goes directly to 
staff people in that enterprise and to the enterprise itself. Those who have rejected 
such help in the past have seen major equipment contracts awarded to less fussy 
competitors.
What should you do?
Answer 11.4
Some Chinese state-owned enterprises use their own high-level employees to serve as 
such “consultants,” with the ultimate purpose of driving down the final project cost. 
With the tacit support of the enterprise, each “consultant” forms a team consisting of 
employees situated in various departments and groups within the enterprise. In offering 
advice, they pass along information prepared to exert increased competitive pressure 
among the foreign suppliers. They also collect design intelligence so that the enterprise 
knows what critical questions to raise in project negotiations. It is one of those tools to 
help an unsophisticated technological buyer get the bid.
If your company needs the project to penetrate the Chinese market and views the 
winning of this project to be critically important for your company’s future growth in 
the global market, then you should proceed to engage the consultant, as not doing so 
will render your company less competitive.
If your company regards this project to be useful, but not critically important to your 
future success, then stay on the high ground of morality and reject the services of the 
consultant. 
Example 11.5
You are a manager of a joint venture in Russia. One day you discover that your most 
senior officer in Russia has been “borrowing” equipment from the company and using 
it in his other businesses. When you confront him, the Russian partner defends his 
actions. After all, as a part owner of both companies, surely he is entitled to share in the 
equipment?
How do you propose to resolve this conflict?
(Source: S. Puffer and D. J. McCarthy, “Pinning the Common Ground in Russian and 
American Business Ethics.” California Management Review, Vol. 37, No. 2, Winter 1995, 
pp. 29–46.)
Answer 11.5
You should tell the Russian partner that the joint venture would be very happy to assist 
his other companies in any way. Then you should proceed to send him a bill for lease 
expenses of the equipment at a commonly accepted market rate. Tell him that, in the 
future, you would like to preapprove any such leases to make sure that the affected 
equipment is not needed in your own shop at the time.

11.7  Conclusion
Ethics in the workplace is a fundamental requirement for all members of a corporation—
individual employees, managers of working groups, and executives. Everyone must dili-
gently observe universal moral standards, respect basic human values, act legally, conform 
to local cultural traditions and practices, and disclose the courses of action taken.
Most situations in the workplace involving ethics originate from a conflict between 
responsibilities and values. These situations must be carefully analyzed by the decision-
makers involved to arrive at a proper course of action. A number of models are included 
in this chapter to assist engineers, managers, and executives in carrying out such analyses.
Creating codes of ethics is helpful. Employees become more sensitive if they are exposed 
to more real-world cases with ethical implications. Knowing what is right and what is 
wrong is usually not sufficient in preventing unethical outcomes. Of critical importance 
to the success of a corporate ethics program is the disciplined enforcement of the code of 
ethics supported by top management. Good behavior should be recognized and rewarded 
promptly. Unacceptable behavior must be punished fully and in a timely manner.
The key to ethical behavior is honesty, fairness, and full disclosure. When selecting 
employees, engineering managers need to focus on their characters, as skills can more 
readily be updated. Managers themselves need to be technically outstanding, manageri-
ally competent, and ethically sensitive.
QUESTIONS
	
1.	Smith, an unemployed engineer who recently received certification as an engineer–
intern from the State Board of Registration for Engineers and Land Surveyors, was 
seeking employment with a consulting firm. Engineer A, a principal with a large 
consulting firm, contacted Smith. After a long discussion concerning such mat-
ters as working conditions, salary, benefits, etc., Engineer A offered, and Smith 
accepted, a position with the firm. Thereafter, Smith canceled several other job 
interviews.
	
	
Two days later, in a meeting with other principals of the firm, it was agreed by 
the firm’s management (including Engineer A) that the vacancy should be filled 
by an engineering technician, not a graduate engineer. A week and a half later, 
Engineer A contacted Smith and rescinded the firm’s offer.
	
	
Did the actions of Engineer A in his relations with Smith constitute unethical 
conduct? Why, or why not?

2.	As the business manager of your company, you are visiting several companies 
in Africa to promote new businesses. At the tail end of several successful rounds 
of negotiation, you are invited to attend a family banquet hosted by one of your 
potential business partners. This invitation represents a genuine sign of friend-
ship and a commitment to good-faith business dealings in the future.
	
	
Would you be offended if the host wanted you to pay for the food and drinks 
you enjoyed at the banquet when you depart? Explain your answer.
	
3.	Cindy Jones, a chemical engineer with considerable experience in offset printing 
processes, was hired recently as an engineering supervisor by Company A. Before 

417
Ethics in Engineering Management and Workplace
that, she had been working as a research chemist for a competing firm, Company 
B, where she had invented a new formula and manufacturing process for press 
blankets. Jones’s technique makes the blanket less prone to failure and produces 
better print quality. These press blankets are being marketed by Company B with 
great success.
	
	
When Jones was hired, there was no discussion about the new offset blanket 
during the interview. Jones was interested in moving into management; Company 
A had no openings available, whereas Company B was seeking to add managerial 
personnel with a superior technical background.
	
	
One day, soon after she had started her new job, Jones received an unexpected 
invitation to a staff meeting from the director of engineering. The meeting agenda 
focused on the formulas and manufacturing processes for offset blankets.
	
	
What should Cindy Jones do?
	
4.	Sara King is a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers. Through 
the union, she has secured a new job to operate a truck with an end loader at the 
XYZ Construction Company.
	
	
About two hours into her new job, the truck began to boil because of a leaky 
radiator. She stopped the truck and went to look for water.
	
	
About 100 feet ahead, Sara spotted a 5 gallon pail. On the way to get the 
pail, she happened to pass Joe Dow, an old union man, who was tending an air 
compressor. Joe Dow shouted, “Where are you going?” When Sara told him, 
Joe Dow replied, “I’ve got news for you. You are not going to get that pail. 
Understand? If you want to work on this job, you’d better start acting like a 
union worker, or I’ll report you to the master mechanic. You’d better get back 
on the truck and wait for the foreman to get a couple of laborers to help you. 
Remember, if you stop your truck because of a boiling radiator and there’s 
no pail within 40 feet of where you happen to stop, it’s not your job to get a 
container.”
	
	
Sara did not want any trouble. So she went back to the truck and waited for the 
foreman. It was two hours before the foreman came. In the meantime, seven other 
dump trucks and their drivers were idle. When the foreman finally did come, Sara 
explained the situation to him. The foreman said, “I’ll get you a couple of laborers 
to draw some water.” Sara explained further that she could easily have gotten the 
water herself earlier, but the operator at the air compressor had told her to lay off. 
The foreman answered, “That’s the way things are on this job. I don’t want any 
trouble, so I do what the union people want.”
	
	
Sara encountered other similar incidents as she continued on the job. The basic 
idea was always the same. Various craft unions decided on a lot of unreason-
able restrictions that made a full day’s work unproductive. The XYZ Construction 
Company had entered a cost-plus contract with the client, a steel company. So the 
more the employees loafed on the job and raised the cost, the more money XYZ 
Construction Company made. The steel company client was the one bearing the 
costs. In the long run, the consuming public ended up paying for this labor waste, 
which contributed to the increasing cost of steel.
	
	
Are there any ethics involved in this problem?

5.	Quick Meal is an international fast-food chain that operates in many countries. 
Company management wants to apply a uniform standard of business ethics, 
modeled after U.S. practices, to all of its stores worldwide.
	
	
When Quick Meal opened a new store in Country X, initially the local gov-
ernment cooperated fully. Then the government changed hands, and a corrupt 
group took over. Shortly thereafter, Quick Meal noticed that the general man-
ager of the new store in Country X was providing free food and other conces-
sions to governmental officials “under the table.” The general manager was an 
American married to a local national. He was trying to get an “in” with the new 
government.
	
	
Store profits were still high, but Quick Meal decided to fire the general manager. 
The officials of the new government intervened and told Quick Meal to keep him 
or they would confiscate the local store. Quick Meal stuck to its decision and let 
the general manager go. The new government followed through with its threats 
and took away the local store.
	
	
A few years later, the government of Country X changed hands again. Although 
Quick Meal was promised some indemnity, there was still a considerable financial 
loss to the company. Despite the fact that these losses were written off, some of the 
Quick Meal stockholders were unhappy with the company’s decision regarding 
the general manager.
	
	
What should Quick Meal have done?
	
6.	Jane is a member of the board of directors of Power Company Z, which is consider-
ing the construction of a new power plant.
	
	
Coal-fired power plants emit sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. Ambient air 
containing a high concentration of sulfur dioxide is known to create acid rain, 
which damages crops and erodes some metals (e.g., nickel and copper). If number 
2 oil is used as fuel instead, the sulfur dioxide emission of the power plant could 
be significantly reduced. However, replacing coal with oil will raise the fuel cost 
by about 20%.
	
	
Some directors believe that any increased costs would have to be reflected 
in higher prices. An increase in electricity price would create problems for the 
company. For example, the Public Utilities Commission may delay approving the 
proposed rate increase. Consumers may react negatively to the price increase, 
which could hurt the company’s public image.
	
	
Other directors are convinced that the company should not use methods that 
would increase expenses. They point out that diverse industries and motor vehi-
cles are far more guilty of causing air pollution than the power industry. As one 
director put it, “Why should we be leaders in this area when it is going to cost 
either stockholders or consumers a great deal of money?”
	
	
Jane knows that fuel represents only one-seventh of the total cost of generating 
and distributing electricity. She feels that the company has an obligation to pro-
tect public health as long as it can stay reasonably profitable. She believes, further, 
that the company should not allow purely business considerations to dominate its 
decisions in an area of such critical importance.
	
	
What do you think Jane should do?

7.	Company A recently bought a rock-crushing unit from Company B. This unit was 
expected to produce 750 tons of crushed rocks per hour, but has in practice been 
producing only 500 tons per hour.
	
	
Paul, president of Company A, complains to Gordon, sales manager of Company 
B, about the fact that he is now unable to fill contracts that he secured based on the 
expected capacity of the machine. In some instances, he has been required to buy 
crushed rock—at retail prices—to satisfy his contract obligations. Furthermore, he 
is not able to repay the loan with the expected higher income from the increased 
production. Paul threatens to sue Company B unless they return half of the pur-
chase price of the equipment.
	
	
Frank, the foreman of Company A’s new rock-crushing installation, and Elmer, 
the company’s chief engineer, are not happy with the new equipment. However, 
they are not sure that company B is at fault. The contract for the new equipment 
specified that the unit should be able to crush 750 tons of properly graded lime-
stone per hour. Company B had samples supplied by Company A and based its 
promise of performance on these tests. Paul had been using stone taken from 
several different company quarries. Both Frank and Elmer had objected to this, 
since much of this stone was harder than that in the sample given to Company B. 
The equipment had not broken down, but it was not able to deliver the specified 
capacity.
	
	
Frank and Elmer discussed this matter and decided to present the problem to 
Paul. If Company B fought Paul’s suit, Frank and Elmer would certainly be called 
on to testify. Moreover, they both felt that Company B had a right to know that 
Company A had been using a harder rock than that used in the tests.
	
	
Paul listened to Frank and Elmer, but was not convinced that he ought to inform 
Company B of the difference in rock hardness. Paul thought that the performance 
guarantee covered the crushing of rock for any and all of the company’s quarries.
	
	
What course of action do you suggest for Company A?

Operational Excellence
12.1  Introduction
Operational excellence (OE) refers to achieving a superior level of productivity in all work 
processes related to products/services offered by an enterprise (Mitchell 2015). This level 
of productivity directly affects the customers’ overall perception of product/service qual-
ity, their tendency to come back for repeat business, and the gross margin realizable by an 
enterprise. It is thus self-evident that companies ought to constantly strive for achieving 
excellence in operations.
The work processes involved in the operation of an enterprise include customization, 
knowledge management, order processing, inquiry coordination, conflict resolution, mar-
keting and sales, product/service production, customer relationship management (CRM), 
project/program execution, customer support procedures, training of customer-facing 
agents, product/service delivery process, and so on. The purpose of achieving OE is to 
slash cost, speed up cycle time, ensure work output quality (right at the very first attempt), 
eliminate waste, and utilize corporate knowledge efficiently. For a given level of sales 
revenues (the top line), the attainment of OE will maximize the company’s operational 
margin and consequently its net profits (the bottom line) and the short-term company per-
formance. There are numerous best-practice technologies that can be utilized to achieve 
OE. Introducing additional innovations to improve these OE practices could put the com-
pany further ahead of its existing competitors.
It is, however, worth noting that, despite its importance, emphasizing only OE is usu-
ally not enough for any company (Tellis 2013). Companies should also focus on strategic 
differentiation (see Chapter 10), to promote their long-term health and their sustainable 
profitability. Both OE and strategic differentiation should be emphasized concurrently. 
Jack Welch said, “An organization’s ability to learn, and translate that learning into action 
rapidly, is the ultimate competitive advantage.” This is especially true when the learning 
is focused on creating strategic differentiation and OE.
This chapter is organized as follows: First, various industrial best practices related to 
achieving OE are reviewed (e.g., process standardization and the application of Lean Six 
Sigma). Commercial software tools that foster productivity are then discussed (e.g., those 
related to the management of customer relationships, enterprise resources, supply chains, 
and projects). Also addressed are emerging productivity tools such as web services, 
service-oriented architecture (SOA), cloud computing, mobile computing, and big data 
applications. A subsequent section delineates the effective implementation of OE projects, 
including project selection, justification of financial viability, assessing technical feasibil-
ity, securing corporate commitment, project execution, and documentation to preserve les-
sons learned. Conclusions are then offered.

Engineering Management
12.2  Tools for Achieving Operational Excellence
There are a number of technology tools that product/service enterprises may readily adopt 
for improving their operations.
12.2.1  Process Standardization
A variety of the work processes employed by a product/service enterprise consist of 
procedures and activities that may be standardized to a great extent. They represent ready-
made opportunities for cost reduction, quality improvement, and process optimization to 
derive OE. Constantly searching for best practices in industries will provide good starting 
points from which to standardize specific work processes of significance.
Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals are expected to 
diligently implement the engineering management functions of planning, organizing, 
leading, and controlling regarding their projects, teams, and programs in order to continu-
ously raise work productivity. They should also become aware of distinctive methodologies 
that could aid in their attempt to achieve OE.
For example, some medical journals (e.g., the Journal of the American Medical Association 
and the New England Journal of Medicine) publish well-tested procedures for highly complex 
medical operations (e.g., open heart surgery and cardiac angioplasty procedure), including 
elapse time, cost, and death rate. Countless hospitals that adopted such published stan-
dard procedures were able to realize cost reductions and save some patient lives. Other 
medical organizations published checklists for performing complex procedures, in order 
to minimize medical errors. It is thus useful for all enterprises to diligently search for such 
tried-and-tested work processes, and quickly implement them. Indeed, many enterprises 
can improve their fortune by showing diligence in adopting these various best practices. 
Once they become proficient in applying these processes, they ought to continue to inno-
vate to further advance these best practices.
12.2.2  Productivity Enhancement Programs
12.2.2.1  Lean Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a well-known waste-reduction methodology that has been applied with 
great success in manufacturing industries (George 2010). It employs the define, measure, 
analyze, improve, and control (DMAIC) method to improve the quality of standardized 
work processes. The Lean principle centers on process speed. By emphasizing the flow of 
information and the interaction between people, Lean Six Sigma can be applied to vari-
ous processes, such as procurement, accounts receivable, sales, call centers, surgical suites, 
government offices, R&D, and others to speed up the delivery of high-quality product/
service and reduce operations costs to positively affect customers’ satisfaction.
Together, Lean and Six Sigma strive to simplify work complexity. This methodology 
requires that an enterprise follow a well-defined procedure to speed up the work pro-
cesses and eliminate wastes in delivering products/services. Lean Six Sigma has been 
demonstrated in many cases to (a) slash product/service costs by 30%–60%, (b) decrease 
product/service delivery time by 50%, and (c) expand production capacity by 20% without 
adding manpower. Several successful cases of practicing Lean Six Sigma technologies are 
published in George (2010), involving companies such as Lockheed Martin, Bank One, 
City of Fort Wayne, and Stanford Hospitals and Clinics.

425
Operational Excellence
Lean Six Sigma may be usefully applied to products/services by following the seven-step 
procedure that constitutes the mnemonic of our SERVICE model: (1) study customer value, 
(2) evaluate these product/service elements, (3) refine the work flow diagram, (4) validate 
and improve on cycle time, (5) institutionalize the drive, (6) call out the complexity, and 
(7) excel in delivery. Detailed descriptions of this model are included in Appendix 12.7.
The Unity Health Hospital at Rochester, New York, conducted 45 Six Sigma projects that, 
as of 2011, have resulted in a total saving of $4.5 million. The hospital trained 60 yellow 
belts and 20 green belts among its staff members and inspired them to constantly search 
for new projects to promote its OE. The door-to-balloon time is an important quality mea-
sure in its emergency cardiac care operations. It is the interval that starts with the patient’s 
arrival at the emergency room and ends when a catheter guide wire crosses the culprit 
lesion in the laboratory. In the past, the hospital was able to meet the industry standard of 
90 minutes, as prescribed by the American Heart Association (AHA), only part of the time. 
After having gone through the Six Sigma process, the door-to-balloon work process was 
further refined so that the hospital was able to meet the AHA standard 100% of the time 
for several consecutive years, before this work was reported out to the public.
In many Six Sigma projects, the technique of value stream mapping may be beneficially 
applied. This technique emphasizes studying the specific value that can be added by each 
activity performed in a process, and simplifying the steps needed to secure the required 
material and information flows (Martin and Osterling 2013). Utilizing such a technique, 
Harvard Pilgrim, a health insurance company located in Boston, Massachusetts, made the 
following decisions: (1) Transfer about 40% of the company’s noncore activities to outside 
vendors. These activities include pharmacy-benefit management, disease management, 
behavior health management, and claims processing. (2) Engage outside experts to per-
form data mining analyses in order to discover patients who might be in the early stages 
of developing heart disease and diabetes, so that these patients could be enrolled in pre-
ventive care or disease management programs before their medical conditions become 
serious. (3) Focus on distinctive activities that confer competitive advantage to the com-
pany. These include customer service, design of new services, pricing health insurance, 
attracting doctors into the network, selling to large customer groups, and marketing to 
individual policyholders.
In some other cases, the failure mode and effect analysis is known to add good value to 
an operational excellence project. This method catches the potential modes of failures 
before they actually occur, based on an evaluation by groups of relevant experts (Joint 
Commission 2010). Analysis and simulation tools may be used to conduct “what-if’ studies 
and define refinement steps. The method may also be engaged to find out the root causes 
of any product/service defects. For example, the commission’s checks of an insurance com-
pany were often inaccurate. It turned out that a few root causes were responsible, includ-
ing, (1) complex commission rules, (2) lack of knowledge on the part of check-processing 
staff, and (3) confusing procedures for processing checks.
The changes brought about by the Internet are transforming most aspects of service 
businesses. Besides Six Sigma, the use of Internet-based professional and business soft-
ware tools, web services, and SOA, which are the subjects reviewed in the following sec-
tions, may also be beneficially considered.
12.2.2.2  Web-Based Enablers
All product/service enterprises will generally be expected to perform general activi-
ties related to project management, CRM, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and

collaboration (Chang 2005a). Many web-based software tools are commercially available 
to offer assistance in such undertakings. The following lineup offers a sample of these 
efficiency-enhancement tools:
12.2.2.2.1  Customer Relationship Management
CRM zeros in on the process of understanding and satisfying customers’ present and 
future requirements. STEM professionals are usually engaged in some part of CRM activ-
ities (Buttle and Maklan 2015; Peppers and Rogers 2011; Kumar and Reinartz 2012), as 
related, for example, to product/service customization, problem solving, operational assis-
tance, and other such customer-centered activities.
All customers are important, but some are more important than others, depending on 
the magnitude of their lifetime value (LTV). LTV is the total sales revenues that could be 
realized by the company from the purchases made by a customer over the period in which 
this customer remains engaged with the company. High-LTV customers should be served 
differently than their low-LTV counterparts.
It is known that a number of U.S. enterprises have set up special corporate desks, each 
dedicated to selected customer groups and manned by full-time employees who pay per-
sonal attention to all of the inquiries initiated by these high-LTV customers. For example, 
Fidelity Investments offers investment services related to online trades, exchange-traded 
funds, mutual funds, individual retirement accounts, and 401(k) retirement accounts. Those 
customers whose portfolio net worth exceeds a specific amount will be invited to join its 
Private Client Group, which is managed by experienced account executives. At the other 
end of the spectrum, companies have set up appropriate extranets, so that all low-LTV cus-
tomers can readily help themselves by accessing web-based resources. Communications 
links with low-LTV customers may be via e-mail, text chat, web-based callback request, 
and voice over the Internet. These extranets may contain service catalogs, installation and 
operational instructions, a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section, a news bulletin, dis-
cussion groups, chat rooms, users’ groups, and other features. Surveys may be conducted 
frequently to solicit customer feedback on service quality, desirable new features, sugges-
tions for improvement, and other pertinent issues. Customer service centers are useful in 
coordinating the inquiries of minor-or medium-LTV customers who prefer human voices. 
An efficacious customer service center is expected to respond to customer inquiries within 
a very short period (say roughly 20 minutes).
CRM has gained importance in recent years as a result of competition, globalization, the 
high cost of customer acquisition, and high customer turnover (Shaw et al. 2010). Surveys 
point out that U.S. corporations lose one-half of their customers every five years. The follow-
ing statistics support the importance of this CRM function: (1) it costs five times more to sell 
to a new customer than to sell to an existing one; (2) a typical dissatisfied customer tells eight 
to ten people about the bad experience; (3) a company can boost its profit by 85% by increasing 
its annual customer retention by only 5%; (4) the odds of selling a service to a new customer 
are 15%; whereas they are 50% with an existing customer, and (5) 70% of complaining custom-
ers will do business with the company again if past service deficiencies are quickly corrected.
By managing customer relationships properly, an Internet-enhanced service enterprise 
hopes to use existing relationships to increase revenue and utilize integrated information 
to offer an excellent customer experience. The product/service enterprise can also intro-
duce more repeatable sales processes and procedures, conceive new customer value and 
instill loyalty, and implement a more proactive solution strategy.
Charles Schwab has used a CRM system marketed by Siebel. Table  12.1 delineates 
the various CRM dimensions. Its specific functions are as follows: (1) Obtain detailed 

427
Operational Excellence
information about customers’ behaviors, preferences, demands, and buying patterns. 
(2)  Use that information to customize the relationship with the respective customer. 
(3) Utilize that information to set prices, determine the level of demand and the desires of 
customers, and negotiate the terms of purchase.
Principal Financial Group, Fidelity Investments, and several other mutual-fund compa-
nies have started using web-based e-401(k) programs. The logic for doing so is compelling. 
When a customer places a phone call to a service center, it costs the company about $9 to 
respond. This cost is only $2 if the customer gets the required services from an automated 
voice-mail system. This cost is further reduced to 10 cents if the customer accesses a web-
based self-service system.
Autodesk Inc., located in San Rafael, California, is known to have applied an innovative 
web-enabled corporate help desk to provide high-tech support to customers. The company 
was able to whittle away the cost associated with internal phone-based support by 70%.
Uniglobe.com, located in Irvine, California, uses a web-enabled call center for travel 
services. A useful strategy is to build a self-service knowledge base that allows customers 
to perform self-help activities. Another strategy is to embed e-support capabilities into 
products, as Hewlett-Packard has done.
iSky (www.isky.com) in Laurel, Maryland, provides an Internet-based, real-time, 
customer care system that involves customer acquisition, retention, and optimization. 
It allows end customers to communicate with companies through any available media, 
such as phone, e-mail, fax, and others. It offers self-help services by accessing the client’s 
e-commerce site and using database and FAQ lookups, automated e-mail, and interactive 
voice response. It can also move to human assistance by an agent. The human-assisted 
customer care can be accessed through e-mail, text chat, voice over Internet protocol, tele-
phone callback, and the traditional tele-services support of phone or fax.
Waiting for customers to call for service is not what CRM is all about. The enterprise 
ought to understand customers, anticipate their future demands, and take action to satisfy 
those needs. CRM is aimed at determining which customers have the tendency to pur-
chase what types of products and services and taking proactive steps to promote these 
products/services to them (e.g., cross-selling and upselling in order to derive increased 
business benefits). CRM could benefit from the use of datamining technologies, by defin-
ing customer preferences and characteristics so that products and services can be custom-
ized to grow better business results.

trivial extraction of information from databases for the purpose of discovering new and

valuable knowledge. The knowledge is in the form of patterns and rules derived from 
relationships between data elements. Data mining emphasizes the use of computation-
ally intensive machine learning tools in the analysis of large and complex databases. As 
computer-processing speed is being increased constantly, difficult data mining solutions 
are becoming more readily attainable in a time frame that has become practical to business 
decision-makers (Lindoff and Berry 2011).
Implementing data mining usually involves the following stages: (1) setting specific 
goals for data mining efforts; (2) collecting data and defining data types; (3) preparing 
data, including data segmentation, formatting, and quality control; (4) performing analysis 
and prediction (employing specific tools such as neural networks, decision trees, logistic 
expression, and visualization to build predictive models); and (5) conducting measure-
ment and feedback (implementing models to bring forth results and taking corresponding 
business actions).
Data mining is a useful tool for profiling customers (by segmentation) and predicting 
their purchasing behaviors (Ahlemeyer-Stubbe and Coleman 2014; Zaki and Meira 2014). 
Questions explored in data mining analyses may include the following: (1) Who are my 
best customers, and can I acquire more of them? (2) How can I increase business with my 
best customers? (3) Who are my worst customers, and should I salvage those relationships? 
If so, how? (4) Why are some customers leaving? (5) Are there other products or services 
that I can provide? (6) How can I avoid acquiring unprofitable customers? (7) What are the 
characteristics of prospective loyal customers? (8) Which products and services are the 
prospective customers looking at or inquiring about? (9) Which products has a single cus-
tomer purchased most often? (10) Are there customer complaints about product features, 
service quality, prices, or other issues?
A case in point is Caterpillar (Lindoff and Berry 2011), which is located in Peoria, Illinois. 
In 1997, this company set up a database of 100,000 client companies with known purchase 
records for fleets of truck engines from Caterpillar as well as its competitors. It then 
defined which client companies would have the best potential to buy from Caterpillar in 
the future by studying a predictive model based on the use of data mining techniques. 
Caterpillar initiated a direct-mail campaign to the resulting 10,000–20,000 client compa-
nies regarded as having high potential to purchase truck engines from Caterpillar. The 
resulting response rate to the direct-mail campaign was 37% in 1999, compared with 16% 
in 1996 and the industrial average of only 3%–5% for similar mailings. The conversion rate 
of non-Caterpillar clients was around 40%. As a consequence, Caterpillar’s truck-engine 
market share went up to 30.4% in 1999, from 23% in 1997.
In addition, Caterpillar built an intranet to post detailed information about each client 
company that included all past correspondences. This allowed its national and regional 
account managers to custom-tailor communications packages online for these individual 
client companies. All sales proposals for truck-engine packages were web-based. Within 
48 hours, a personalized package, complete with the salesperson’s signature, could be sent. 
The Caterpillar case is a good example of how data mining can be applied to serve the 
business purposes of the company.
Another case of profitably applying data mining techniques is related to the 2012 presi-
dential election. The Obama campaign was said to have hired a docent of data crunchers, 
who compiled and mined big data comprising merged information collected from posters, 
fundraisers, field workers, consumer databases, social media, and voter files in the swing 
states (e.g., Ohio, Florida, Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, 
and North Carolina). It included 80 pieces of information about each person (e.g., age, sex, 
race, and voting history). This team:

1.	Conducted multivariate tests to identify issues and positions that could move 
undecided voters. Studied what policy messages individual voters should hear.
	
2.	Performed simulation tests to predict who might be persuaded by what kinds 
of appeals. Who might donate online? Who would donate through mail? 
Subsequently, online donations were a major success. The team helped to raise a 
total of $1 billion for the campaign.
	
3.	Devised detailed models of swing state voters in order to increase the effective-
ness of phone calls, door knocks, direct mailings and the use of social media. Sent 
messages via “Facebook pal” to promote voter registration and to encourage them 
to get out to vote.
	
4.	Ran 66,000 tests every night and recommended specific ways to allocate campaign 
resources for the next day. Discovered the best way to reach targeted voter groups, 
resulting in buying TV ads by 14% more efficient.
On November 6, 2012, President Obama was reelected, having won all swing states by 
small margins, with the exception of North Carolina. These data mining efforts were rec-
ognized as a key contributing factor to his success. Cracking massive data for insight is the 
hallmark of our new era involving data mining.
12.2.2.2.2  Enterprise Resources Planning
To achieve sustainable profitability, enterprises need to plan, align, execute, and control 
all basic business processes. By streamlining all transactions and facilitating data 
exchange between units, companies can minimize inventories, shorten the cycle time 
to market, cut costs, upgrade overall operational efficiency, and support customer ser-
vice. ERP software is designed to integrate into one information system all back-office 
operations, such as manufacturing, engineering, finance, distribution, procurement, 
decision support, knowledge management, marketing and sales, and other internal 
business functions (Monk and Wagner 2012; Leon 2012). This building block is at the 
foundation of a progressive enterprise. The capability of ERP to integrate business data 
becomes particularly important to enterprises having numerous sites and multina-
tional operations.
SAP ERP (www.sap.com) is, being a part of the SAP Business suite, a commercial, off-
the-shelf ERP software package marketed by SAP, Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. It 
supports 25 specific functions related to accounting and finance, production planning 
and material management, human resources, and sales and distribution (Hernandez 
et al. 2006; Sankar and Rau 2006; Lawlor 2003). It also supports order entry, facilitates 
supply-planning processes, and assists in customer service. Users of this system claim 
that the order entry process can be shortened from 18 to 1 day and its financial close 
cycle from 8 to 4 days. Microsoft is said to have spent 10 months and $25 million on 
installing mySAP ERP to supervise its 25,000 employees and 50 subsidiaries. It claims to 
have realized an annual cost reduction of $18 million. Nestle (maker of drinks, sweets, 
foods, and pharmaceuticals) uses the mySAP ERP application suite to monitor its 498 
factories, 210,000 employees, and operations in 69 countries. Rhom & Haas Company 
spent $300 million in 1999 to convert the company’s 64 different information systems to 
SAP over a four-year period. By 2003, the company was able to trim 4000 workers and 
save $500 million in operating expenses. It realized an increase in its after-tax profit 
margin from 2% to 8% by 2005. Other companies that use mySAP ERP include Owens 
Corning, Colgate-Palmolive, and Warner-Lambert.

Reviewed next are three specific components in enterprise integration systems: (1) pro-
curement resources management, (2) marketing and sales management, and (3) decision 
support and knowledge management.
12.2.2.2.2.1 Procurement Resources Management  Procurement deals with the acquisition of 
typical operating resources, such as office supplies, services, travel, computer equipment 
and software, maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) supplies, fuels, and training. 
Procurement activities involve identifying and qualifying suppliers, selecting specific 
products, placing orders, and resolving problems and specific issues after purchase.
Traditional procurement follows a number of manually implemented and time-
consuming steps that are subject to frequent human errors. These steps include the follow-
ing: (1) identify vendors who produce a specific item required by the company and who 
satisfy a specific set of procurement requirements defined by the company; (2) exchange 
and review technical documents, such as drawings and product specifications; (3) solicit 
bids and evaluate available offers; (4) process the purchase orders within the company and 
obtain approvals; (5) register orders and subsequent payment transactions into the com-
pany’s back-office systems, involving accounts payable and the factory-receiving depart-
ment, and (6) resolve human errors and transaction mistakes, such as wrong parts ordered, 
shipment dates entered incorrectly, and receiving locations improperly specified.
By contrast, web-based procurement makes this process significantly more efficient, 
decreases administrative costs per item purchased, and is adaptable to the evolution of 
business models because it can do the following: (1) use online catalogs provided by sup-
pliers; (2) make use of an electronic data interchange (EDI) network to process documents, 
a network that currently has 400,000 members in active participation; (3) utilize computer-
aided design (CAD) software to communicate through drawings; and (4) monitor inven-
tory levels and automate the procurement process.
Online procurement is clearly the current trend. The objectives are to reduce order-
processing costs and cycle time, strengthen the corporate procurement capabilities, facili-
tate self-service, integrate with back-office systems, and raise the strategic importance of 
procurement.
In newer e-procurement models, reverse auction has been advanced as a tactic to procure 
well-defined items. Reverse auction works in favor of companies that enjoy a dominant 
buyer’s position because of their large transaction volume. Companies engaged in reverse 
auction first prequalify selected vendors on the basis of product quality, financial strength, 
company reputation, and other factors. Then they publish the specifications of the goods 
required and invite prequalified vendors to submit multiple rounds of bids before a prede-
termined date. The vendor with the lowest bid is awarded the supply contract. It is called 
reverse auction because the bid price is lowered in each consecutive round. The Internet 
greatly enables the process of reverse auction.
Microsoft is said to have spent millions of dollars designing MS Market, an online order-
ing system. It eliminates all paperwork, works in a distributed procurement environment, 
is particularly suitable for high-volume, low-dollar value transactions, processes orders 
linked to supply sources, and permits order status tracking. One important advantage of 
using such a procurement system is the elimination of rules and hidden procedures that 
greatly slow down the procurement process. MS Market reduces the purchase cycle time 
from eight to three days and slices overhead costs by about 90%. It averages 100 orders and 
6000 transactions per day.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) has 1400 branch offices, 40,000 employees, 
and 14,000 suppliers. Using a software system marketed by Ariba, Inc. CIBC employees are 

431
Operational Excellence
able to buy standard office supply items online from preferred suppliers. CIBC decreased 
its procurement costs by 50%.
The following are additional examples of e-procurement software products available in 
the marketplace:
•	 eProcurement (www.purchasingnet.com) is a web-based procurement software 
program marketed by PurchasingNet, Inc., a subsidiary of Versata. It streamlines 
the process of requisitioning, approvals, purchasing management, receiving, 
inventory control, and catalog management. The company claims that the use of 
this system has brought about savings of 5%–15% in purchasing costs. A poten-
tially useful application of the software is for the procurement of MRO parts, 
which are typically low-volume, high-variety, and noncore items.
•	 Purchase Manager (www.Verian.com). Verian Technologies (Charlotte, North 
Carolina) markets this web-based procurement system, which has a total of eight 
modules (e.g., item searching, requisitioning, approving, budgeting, purchasing, 
receiving, managing inventory, and reporting). It automates purchasing with 
attachments (e.g., drawings and documents), processes orders, updates inventory, 
issues reports, performs audits, and tracks the status of customer orders. The com-
pany claims that use of this software has whittled down its clients’ purchase order 
costs by 80%.
12.2.2.2.2.2 Marketing and Sales Management  To service customers well, enterprises should 
devise an easy order processing system, add value for the customers, increase sales force 
effectiveness, and coordinate team building. The following processes are readily auto-
mated by the use of self-service centers: (1) sales configuration, (2) pricing, (3) quote and 
proposal generation, (4) commission and contract management, (5) order entry manage-
ment, and (6) product promotion.
12.2.2.2.2.3 Decision Support and Knowledge Management  The functions of decision 
support and knowledge management are centered on (1) business analysis, such as 
filtering, reporting, what-if analyses, forecasting, and risk analysis; (2) data capture 
and storage, including data warehousing, data mining, and query processing; (3) deci-
sion support, such as expert systems, case-based reasoning modules, and intelligent 
knowledge modules; and (4) data dissemination via proper means, including wireless 
or mobile front ends.
About 70% of Fortune 1000 companies have or will soon possess ERP integration capa-
bilities; among them are Coca-Cola, Cisco, Hershey Foods, Eli Lilly, Alcoa, and Compaq. 
ERP vendors include SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft, J. D. Edwards, and Baan.
12.2.2.2.3  Supply Chain Management
Supply chain management involves the formation, maintenance, and monitoring of a com-
plex network of relationships with business partners to secure the required flows of mate-
rials, technologies, and information (e.g., demand forecast, order processing, and order 
status reporting), and finance (credit card information, credit terms, payment schedule, 
and title ownership arrangements). Its goals are to lessen the time to market, decrease 
the production cost, and supply the right products/services at the right place and at the 
right time (Simchi-Levi 2012; Myerson 2012). Achieving these challenging goals requires 
an integration of various operations, subject to externally imposed constraints, real-time 
scheduling, and the optimization of multiple-objective functions involving cost, time, 

432
Engineering Management
service, and quality. Web-based tools are available to assist in dealing with such complex 
supply chains.
Apple is known to be capable of delivering millions of its sophisticated products very 
rapidly to multiple markets by having established efficient supply chains with worldwide 
partners. Boeing is known to have engaged hundreds of contract manufacturers to pro-
duce its well-known 787 Dreamliner plastic-body aircrafts, while taking advantage of the 
resident technological expertise of its suppliers.
Other companies employ web-based technological enablers to drive efficiency, produc-
tivity, and competitiveness. There is a wealth of information available. STEM professionals 
and leaders are advised to follow the literature closely and leave no stone unturned in the 
quest to find advanced supply chain management tools for productivity improvement and 
cost cutting.
12.2.2.2.4  Project Management
Project management deals with the management of human and physical resources that 
are required to attain a well-defined project objective on time and within budget (Kerzner 
2014; Heagney 2011). Companies may concentrate on civil construction, capital equipment, 
research and development, new product or process design, cost reduction, equipment ret-
rofit, quality improvement, customer and market research, and other projects with a high 
technical content. Project team members may consist of company employees, contractors, 
suppliers, and/or customers.
Project management has become more difficult as business scopes enlarge, project 
contents expand beyond organizational boundaries, and project team members reside 
at geographically dispersed locations. Globalization and new business practices make 
project variables, such as contractor interfaces and increased uncertainties for on-time 
and on-budget deliverables, more complicated. A new collaborative work style demands 
a different project management paradigm—from “command-and-control” to “quick col-
laboration”—as well as an increased effectiveness that demands just-in-time development 
and Internet-speed deployment.
The best practices in project management emphasize the following key management 
issues: tasks and resources, cost, risk, communications, and knowledge.
12.2.2.2.4.1 Task and Resource Management  The first and foremost step in managing a 
project is for the project manager to define the overall project objective and the related 
budgetary, time, and other constraints, in consultation with company management. In the 
project-planning phase, tasks are formulated for implementation in parallel or in series, 
and their starting and completion dates are properly defined. Based on skills, experience, 
and availability, suitable people are then assigned to these tasks, thereby establishing 
individual responsibilities and accountabilities. A Gantt chart or project evaluation and 
review technique (PERT) diagram is then used to graphically model the overall schedule 
and activities of the project. Tasks on the critical path are subsequently defined, as these 
should be tracked carefully. At that point, the anticipated completion date and budget for 
the project are iteratively finalized. The project manager initiates the project after having 
secured the approval of the project plan from company management and the commitment 
of all team members involved. The project manager also specifies the communications 
protocol, guidelines for data and document-transfer, as well as policies related to conflict 
resolution, problem solving, progress reporting, change management, and other issues. 
Training sessions are held to ensure that team members can efficiently utilize all the avail-
able project management tools.

433
Operational Excellence
12.2.2.2.4.2 Cost Management  Tools commonly used to manage costs include spreadsheet 
programs integrated with databases and automatic time entry systems. When incurred, 
actual expenses related to purchased items and capital assets are reported instantly. The 
total cumulative cost incurred for the project is then determined and plotted graphically to 
compare with the planned budget. Progress reports are issued to keep company manage-
ment informed of the project status. When necessary, remedial actions are initiated in a 
timely manner to minimize the impact of possible budgetary and other deviations.
12.2.2.2.4.3 Risk Management  The successful completion of diverse projects is inherently 
subject to uncertainties beyond the control of the project manager or team members. 
Examples of such uncertainties include weather conditions, labor strikes, priority shifts, 
delays in the delivery of materials, and the unavailability of key team members due to 
personal emergencies. Forward-thinking project managers need to be aware of the relative 
impact of such uncertainties and be prepared to respond timely. They are the experts who 
could “see around the corners.”
Most project management software tools permit what-if analyses that determine the 
overall project outcome (e.g., schedule and budget), when one or more input variables 
(e.g., task duration, task expenditure, and task initiation date) deviate from the plan, while 
keeping all remaining input variables unchanged. The results of such analyses allow the 
project manager to understand the relative sensitivity of the overall project outcome to 
these specific deviations. By rank ordering potential plan deviations, the project man-
ager is able to proactively devise suitable contingency plans that minimize such adverse 
impacts on the overall project outcome. Past experience in handling similar projects is 
helpful to project managers for dealing with this type of project risk.
However, it should be mentioned that a what-if analysis has a fundamental deficiency. 
It varies only a small number of input variables while keeping a very large number of 
remaining input variables constant. This deficiency is not consistent with how projects 
behave in the real world. Real-world projects have uncertainties associated with each and 
every project input variable, although these uncertainties may be large in some cases and 
small in others. The overall project outcome model would be a truly realistic one if all 
input variables were allowed to vary within their respective ranges. The Monte Carlo sim-
ulation technique (see Section 6.4.2) is capable of permitting all input variables of a risky 
project to vary simultaneously (Hult et al. 2012; Yoe 2011).
In recent years, companies in a large number of industries have started to practice the 
Monte Carlo simulation technique to manage risky projects on personal computers. All 
input variables may be modeled by a set of three values: the minimum, the most likely, and 
the maximum. The most likely value of an input variable corresponds to its value as origi-
nally planned in the conventional deterministic model, whereas the minimum and maxi-
mum values are the variable’s possible lower and upper bounds, respectively. For each input 
variable, its lower and upper bounds should be defined carefully to account for its right 
range of potential variation. Each input variable is then modeled by a probability distribu-
tion function—Triangular, Gaussian, Beta, Poisson, or another—that portrays how the value 
of this input variable changes with probability. The highest probability is to be assigned to 
its most likely value. Upon activation of the Monte Carlo simulation technique, all input vari-
ables are concurrently varied between their minimum and maximum values. The resulting 
project outcome (e.g., schedule and budget) is represented by a probability distribution func-
tion that has a set of minimum, most likely, and maximum values of its own.
By varying both the minimum and maximum values of specific input variables and 
the shapes of the distribution functions representing them, the project manager is able 

434
Engineering Management
to ascertain their relative impacts on the overall project outcome. What the Monte Carlo 
simulation technique can deliver that the traditional what-if analysis cannot is two pieces 
of new information: (1) the absolute minimum and maximum values for the overall proj-
ect outcome and (2) the probability (e.g., 80%) that the project will be completed within a 
specific budget and on or before a specific completion date. Both pieces of information are 
valuable to the project manager.
In fact, special cases are readily recovered by using the Monte Carlo simulation analysis. 
If all input variables are single valued (e.g., setting the minimum and maximum values 
of all input variables equal to their respective most likely values), then the overall project 
outcome will also be single valued. This result is equivalent to that delivered by a tradi-
tional deterministic project management tool. If one or more input variables are modeled 
by their three-valued sets while the majority of other input variables remain single valued, 
then the project outcome will correspond to that of a traditional what-if analysis.
STEM professionals and leaders ought to familiarize themselves with advanced analysis 
techniques, such as the Monte Carlo simulation technique, which is also readily applicable 
to other technical subjects involving uncertainties, such as system reliability, technology 
forecasting, and decision analysis.
12.2.2.2.4.4 Communication  Communication between team members is a key success factor 
for any project. As project numbers increase and project scope expands, team members 
may become diversified in composition and dispersed in geographical locations. Typical 
communications tools used will include voice, text, video, data, and documents. Specific 
Internet-based technologies are to be established to make communication between team 
members faster, easier, cheaper, of higher quality, and more productive. An open commu-
nication policy tends to foster collaboration, which is essential for securing the success of 
any project.
12.2.2.2.4.5 Knowledge Management  Managing knowledge within a project is a task of 
critical importance. Knowledge is power and it is a decisive and competitive power for 
a company, if it is created, maintained, and widely applied to add value. At the end of a 
project, all team members usually gather to give recognition to those who performed well, 
congratulate each other for the success achieved, and then immediately dash out to take 
on the next assignment. There may be debriefing meetings that summarize what went well 
and what did not go so well. In general, preserving the learning from each project is not 
always done systematically (Dalkir 2011).
Oftentimes, there is a significant amount of knowledge worth preserving. Project man-
agement practices that yield positive results should be properly documented. Explicit 
knowledge is easily preserved and disseminated, but the tacit knowledge, 80% of what 
we know, is not. Mission-critical data are worth saving. Contingency plans that were suc-
cessfully activated to eliminate unexpected uncertainties represent valuable corporate 
know-how that should be recorded. Specific lessons learned from each project should be 
preserved.
Also important is the preference to store useful knowledge in forms that make it readily 
reusable, such as searchable databases. Knowledge that is saved to add value, but is not 
frequently reused, denotes a waste of resources.
Software tools are available to assist in performing various activities related to project 
management. What capabilities should one look for in a web-based project management 
tool? Obviously, such tools should assist the project team, whose members may reside in 

435
Operational Excellence
distant locations and work in different time zones, in accomplishing the project objectives 
in time and within budget, while facilitating instant communications and data sharing. 
England and Finney (2007) offer a set of selection guidelines for web-based project man-
agement tools. According to them, a good web-based project management tool should be 
able to do the following: (1) Offer easy access to the project status of assignments, costs, and 
the time line in real time, via a browser-based client. (2) Have a portal for project-related 
information. (3) Be capable of importing data from and exporting to other project manage-
ment tools. (4) Run programs on a web server. (5) Manage contact information about every 
team member. (6) Map projects and assign tasks to team members (Gantt charts, histo-
grams, and PERT charts). (7) Assign different views to allow each team member to see only 
the information and assignments pertinent to him or her. (8) Enable members to update 
tasks, add notes to tasks, attach files to the document, and send e-mails to others. (9) Permit 
easy installation and use. Offer sample templates for specific project topics that are read-
ily modified to fit the needs of individuals. (10) Possess the capability to track any number 
of tasks and milestones with associated links to web sites, documents, and every other 
project. (11) Hold online, text-based chats for virtual meetings or threaded discussions for 
collaboration between team members. (12) Track resources allocation—load-leveling capa-
bilities and membership rosters integrated with external directories. (13) Organize user 
interfaces. (14) Perform scenario analyses (what-if). (15) Enable risk-adjusted modeling. 
(16) Document project outcome and learning.
Project management software tools have migrated from the infrastructure of centralized 
minicomputers, to PC desktops and local area networks (LAN), and, finally, to web-based 
tools (Laudon and Traver 2014). In the web environment, project management tools involve 
the following: (1) e-mail, (2) web pages to increase speed and availability of information, 
(3) groupware for project tracking and scheduling, (4) file transfer protocol (FTP) for trans-
mission of documents and data, (5) shared databases of multimedia formats, (6) remote 
accessibility, and (7) integration with wireless and palm-top technologies There are still 
two significant constraints currently present in web-based project management tools, 
namely, bandwidths and infrastructure for multimedia transmission and data security.
Project management tools are advancing steadily. Enumerated next are some of the key 
project management tools available to date:
	
1.	Primavera P6 Professional Project Management (www.oracle.com). This project 
management software is marketed by Oracle, Redwood Shores, California. It has 
several modules useful for project management, including Project Planner to over-
see activities and resources, PrimeContract to monitor costs, Evolve to manage the 
portfolio, and TeamPlay to promote the collaboration of participants.
	
	
Toronto Transportation Commission (Toronto, Canada) successfully applied 
Project Planner by Primavera to manage 50 construction service projects, each 
worth $2 million to $1 billion and having 100–600 activities, involving a total 
of 9000 people. A single master schedule is updated across a series of personal 
computers linked to four servers on a local area network (LAN). Data are then 
converted to PERT charts and distributed to all involved. The software displays 
the links between each project and its associated activities. Communications are 
enabled by e-mail, web pages, and other forms of Internet-based tools to keep 
everyone focused on the project goals. Resources to be deployed are categorized 
by discipline, workload, work hours available, and planned work to optimize 
resource loading for meeting project deadlines. Report generation may be in the 

436
Engineering Management
form of paper, e-mail, and posting on TV or the web. Data can be used for risk 
management purposes. The software allows project managers to keep in mind 
the big picture of all of their projects without getting lost in the details, but it also 
permits them to drill down for details if desired.
	
	
Dick Corporation (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) utilized Primavera’s Project 
Planner to manage the construction of a 115,000 square-foot addition to St. Francis 
Health System Hospital while the hospital was still operating. The software 
assisted in scheduling and coordinating all pertinent resources, including con-
tractors, hospital personnel, and special equipment.
	
2.	McLaren Collaboration Workspace CW (www.mclarensoftware.com). McLaren 
Software in San Francisco markets this software, which provides an online col-
laboration workspace particularly suitable for managing construction projects in 
the building industry. Built on the Oracle database using Application Server 3.0 
operating in a Windows environment, this software plans actions; tracks activities; 
coordinates the work of engineers, architects, and contractors; and automates vari-
ous project components. Team members are connected to a password-protected 
website that contains project documentation, schedules, drawings, charts, and 
other project data files. Project managers have access to a messaging system and 
can monitor communications between team members.
	
	
This software has been used by the San Francisco Public Works Department, 
Sun Microsystems, Stanford University, Fidelity Investment, and Charles Schwab.
	
3.	ProjectGrid (www.ProjectGrid.com). This software of ProjectGrid.com, Inc., 
Columbus, Ohio, provides websites on a subscription basis to host project-
specific information. It functions as an online communications management tool 
for project management activities. It is capable of managing (1) financial infor-
mation, (2) bid calendars, (3) project schedules, (4) work in progress, (5) site visit 
reports, (6) design drawings, (7) change orders, (8) contract invoices, (9) file down-
loads, (10) contract information, (11) administrative functions, (12) digital photo 
logs, and (13) other data. Team members access a password-secured website to 
receive updated project information. This program may be particularly attractive 
to small and midsize companies.
	
4.	ProjectTalk (www.projectTalk.com) software by Meridian Systems (Folsom, 
California) has five modules to aid in construction project management: (1) doc-
ument management, (2) cost control, (3) field management, (4) purchasing con-
trol, and (5) reports and queries. Through browsers, team members can access 
design drawings, job-site photos, project schedules, and over 400 reports. They 
are linkable to “e-commerce” and “collaboration” modules of Projecttalk.com to 
promote web-based communication and collaboration among team members. It 
is regarded as a standard in the architects, engineering, and construction (AEC) 
industry and is widely used by architects, engineers, general contractors, and pub-
lic institutions.
	
5.	Elite 3E (www.elite.com). This financial and practice management tool by elite.com 
(Los Angles, California) connects team members with subcontractors and clients. 
It can be accessed via standard web browsers and wireless palm connections. It 
does full project budgeting, tracking, and reporting, and claims to be easy to learn 
and convenient to use. It offers convenient access to subcontractors and clients and 
can be activated through subscription.

437
Operational Excellence
	
6.	Microsoft Professional 2016 (www.microsoft.com). Its capabilities include (1) creating 
Gantt charts for project and individual team members, (2) handling multiple proj-
ect tasks and time lines, (3) producing summary reports, (4) updating project sta-
tus and information using “time sheets,” and (5) offering online help and tutorials 
(Chatfield and Johnson 2013). Team members can access project information and 
view Gantt charts, multiple project tasks, time lines, and summary reports through 
a standard web browser. Project status information can be updated through time 
sheets that permit authorized team members to add tasks for themselves or others. 
Rules can be entered that, when triggered, will alert the project manager of unex-
pected deviations from the plan.
	
7.	Others. Additional project management tools include: TeamCenter Project by 
Siemens (www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us).
As evidenced by the preceding discussion, numerous web-based project management 
tools are strong in some aspects and weak in others. There appears to be no single tool that 
is capable of satisfying all project management requirements. A growing trend in the field 
of project management is to lease advanced tools to manage specific projects on a “pay-
as-you use” basis. Some application service providers (ASPs) market web-based project 
management tools. In general, leasing project management tools is more cost-effective, as 
it meets the specific project requirements better and consumes less cycle time for the com-
pany, compared with the option of either buying expensive software tools that have to be 
customized or building them in-house.
12.2.3  Emerging Tools
12.2.3.1  Web Services
In recent years, web services have become increasingly popular as a computing concept 
(Papazoglou 2012; Zhang 2011; Alonso et al. 2010). In general, web services have several 
common components that make them capable of interacting with human users or with 
other applications: (1) Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) provides the envelope for 
sending the web services messages. (2) The Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) 
forms the basis for web services. A service provider describes its web services using 
WSDL (e.g., XML, Java, and others). (3) Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration 
(UDDI). Registries can be searched to find and use web services quickly, easily and 
dynamically.
There are two specific types of web services. The first type is associated with applica-
tion services that are delivered to human users over the web. The second type is related 
to applications modules that are made accessible to other applications over the Internet 
through XML-based protocols.
Several IT organizations have started offering the first type of web services. Amazon, 
Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, and others are known to be vendors of such 
services (Huckman et al. 2008), namely,
•	 Storage. Simple Storage Service (S3) by Amazon provides a basic interface for stor-
ing and retrieving data from anywhere on the web. To ensure secure storage, each 
object uploaded to S3 will be duplicated and multiple copies are stored in multiple 
locations.

438
Engineering Management
•	 Computing. Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) by Amazon is a web service that 
provided resizable computing capacity in the cloud. Clients could run programs 
on Amazon’s computers.
	
	
The Sun Grid utility services offered by Sun Microsystems provide clients with 
computing power, also on a pay-as-you-go basis.
•	 Database. SimpleDB by Amazon enables real-time lookup and query of structured 
data.
•	 Simple queue service (SQS). SQS, provided by Amazon, is a scalable, hosted queue, 
which can be used to store data messages sent between applications, thus allow-
ing clients to move data between application components that perform different 
tasks. In other words, it allows components of an application to send messages to 
other components and establish a place to store these SQS requests and have the 
consuming components pick them up.
•	 Flexible payment services (FPS). This service is offered by Amazon for clients to col-
lect funds from their customers using credit cards, while allowing the clients to 
define payment conditions.
•	 Online marketplace. Salesforce.com offers Exchange as an online marketplace, 
allowing clients to swap and sell applications. It covers the modules sales service, 
marketing, and partners.
•	 Build and host web applications. Google offers App Engine, which allows clients to 
build and host web applications on Google’s scalable infrastructure. Windows 
Live by Microsoft offers the service of an e-mail program, news headlines, blog 
and audio feeds, and a web page builder.
•	 Premium support. Assistance is offered by Amazon to clients regarding services on 
S3, EC2 and SQS.
In addition, companies such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard offer web-
based infrastructure and software solutions to business clients. The proper use of these 
types of Internet-based technology services will likely to raise the operational productiv-
ity of many service enterprises.
The second type of web services deals with creating modularized applications that inter-
act with other modularized applications, following specific standards regarding language, 
data description, data exchange, and connection protocols. Because everyone shares the 
same standards, these modularized applications are able to talk freely with other appli-
cations (McAfee 2005). Thus, this second type of web services allows the construction of 
modular and interchangeable building blocks of software, which are most useful as the 
basic layer components of an SOA, as will be reviewed in Section 12.2.3.2.
12.2.3.2  Service-Oriented Architecture
Since 2003, SOA and web services have become an important new development in the 
distributed computing world. Innumerable publications in the literature envisage the 
business value that may be conferred by employing this new and emergent computing 
approach (Ortiz and Tran 2015; Josutti 2007; Bell 2010; Erl et al. 2012).
It is important for STEM professionals and leaders to understand how SOA is 
defined, what elements SOA is composed of, what benefits and risks might be involved 
in the implementation of SOA, which SOA applications cases have become available, 

439
Operational Excellence
and, above all, what might be the potential impact of SOA on OE to products/services 
enterprises.
In the literature, SOA has been defined by different people in different ways (Erickson 
and Siau 2008). Currently, there is no consensus among various groups regarding a uni-
fied definition for SOA. SOA is defined from a technological standpoint in Krafig et al. 
(2004), as a service architecture that is based on the key concepts of an application front 
end, service, service repository, and service bus. A service consists of a contract, one or 
more interfaces, and an implementation. Accordingly, SOA may have up to four layers, as 
illustrated in Figure 12.1.
	
1.	Enterprise layer: Application front ends (for communicating with end users) and 
public enterprise services (enabling cross-enterprise integration)
	
2.	Process layer: Containing process-centric services
	
3.	Intermediary layer: Providing technological gateways, facades, and adapters
	
4.	Basic layers: Providing the basic services of the SOA (business logic, data, proxies 
for other company’s public enterprise services)
An SOA structure for airlines (a fully developed SOA with four layers) is depicted in 
Figure 12.2.
XML-based web services (based on SOAP and WSDL) are not the only viable technol-
ogy platform for an SOA, which is generally not dependent on any particular technology 
platform.
Erl et al. (2014) offers the following definition for SOA: “SOA establishes an architectural 
model that aims to enhance the efficiency, agility, and productivity of an enterprise by 
positioning services as the primary means through which solution logic is represented in 
support of the realization of strategic goals associated with service-oriented computing.” 
This definition seems to encompass the various common elements contained in various 
definitions proposed by others. It tends to emphasize the commonality among them. It 
appears to be the best broad-based description of what SOA is all about.

Engineering Management
SOA contains three principal elements, according to Carr (2005). (1) Virtualization. It 
eliminates the platform-related restrictions to allow applications to run on different plat-
forms. (2) Grid computing. It allows a number of diverse hardware components (servers, 
disk drivers, etc.) to interact readily and to form an operating unit. (3) Web services. It 
ensures smooth interactions of legacy and new software by standardizing the interface 
between applications (e.g., input format, language of transmitting messages, and other 
interfacing protocols), thus turning them into modules that can be assembled and disas-
sembled readily.
As a result, SOA is expected to deliver the following useful functionalities:
(1) Composite applications. SOA supports the creation of composite applications that bring 
together numerous business processes from multiple systems into a simple user interface. 
With SOA, companies will be empowered to change business processes with greater con-
fidence, predictability, and frequency, leading to better agility and performance. The ser-
vices provided by vendors are shared among applications. Web services create a common 
platform that enables SOA. (2) Agility. With SOA, change inherently becomes faster and 
easier, because the architecture is centered on the concept of services that are designed to 
be interoperable and used across different business processes and variable business con-
texts. (3) Reusability. The service-oriented approach delivers IT systems as a set of reusable 
services that can be assembled easily to deliver a composite application that automates a 
business process. This “assembly approach” accelerates the time to market for new appli-
cations and minimizes IT costs. SOA allows service components to be reused across the 
organization and reassembled on the fly. In so doing, SOA enables rapid responses to busi-
ness and technology changes in the marketplace.
To minimize the operating risks associated with the implementation of SOA computing, 
there are five phases of SOA implementation that must be managed properly: (1) Define 
the desirable future state and the roadmap to achieve it (e.g., set the vision and plan the 
project). (2) Design an initial set of enterprise software services with obvious business val-
ues and impact to gain corporate acceptance. (3) Set up a library of enterprise services that 
are useful to the vast majority of corporate users. (4) Institutionalize the SOA program to 
further align with the business organization. (5) Continue to innovate in order to enhance 
the value of SOA to the organization.

STEM professionals and managers who are interested in becoming versed in the 
computational and technological issues related to SOA design and implementation should 
consult the Prentice Hall Service-Oriented Computing Series from Thomas Erl, which 
includes (1) concepts, technology, and design; (2) service design; (3) service pattern; and 
(4) design and versioning, as well as other suitable technology resources.
Because of the aforementioned set of functionalities, SOA is expected to offer a number 
of benefits to its corporate users: (1) Foster time to market for new applications and help 
organizations achieve competitive advantage by rapidly seizing new opportunities and 
responding to unexpected threats. A reduction in the time required to deliver new ser-
vices is made possible by the highly reconfigurable implementation of business processes. 
(2) Flexible applications inspire the introduction of flexible business processes, making the 
organization more agile and adaptable to the pace of changing business environments. 
The integration of applications is streamlined. (3) Service reuse brings about greater effi-
ciency and lowers maintenance costs, making IT more efficient in supporting business 
initiatives. A better utilization of company resources is ensured by the reuse of existing 
software assets. (4) The ability to respond quickly to new regulatory requirements or spe-
cific compliance issues helps companies avoid governmental penalties.
These potential benefits are directly useful to product/service enterprises that strive to 
achieve OE.
SOA is a mainstream IT initiative. However, it may fail due to a number of deficiencies 
enumerated here, some of which are management centered. (1) Failure to communicate 
properly to enable the wide use of SOA by everyone. (2) Lack of trust in the quality offered 
by the SOA software involved. (3) Insufficient and difficult testing of SOA components. An 
insufficiently tested but reusable service can amplify risks, as a failure in a crucial service 
can ripple through all the applications and other services that access it. Thus, proper test-
ing of services is a critical requirement with respect to functionality, performance, security 
policies, interoperability, and boundary conditions. (4) Service-level agreement between 
providers and consumers. (5) Change of service infrastructure has an impact on the avail-
ability and performance of the service. (6) Requirements for services are not clearly vis-
ible. (7) Services designed are not properly governed and designed for reuse. (8) Support 
personnel is lacking.
Quite a few of these identified deficiencies are related to project management. Service 
professionals and leaders should pay attention to them when implementing SOA.
Rogers (2008) conducted a survey among IT managers and enterprise architects to 
define the critical success factors for an SOA program: (1) Business alignment. Center 
on enterprise business goals and strategies, business support and involvement, and 
value measurement, and align the funding model. (2) Organizational change manage-
ment. Align resources, implement recognition/incentive program, skills, and education. 
(3) Communications. Communications are necessary for advocacy, awareness, visibility, 
discovery, and progress reporting. (4) Trust. Trust is key for performance, availability, 
service reliability, security, and quality. (5) Architecture. Institutionalize enterprise SOA 
reference architecture and standards. Implement cross-enterprise services management 
discipline. (6) Scale and sustainability. This includes SOA program scalability, technical 
scalability, and service granularity. (7) Governance. Introduce a strong SOA governance 
program at the early stages of initiative, integrate SOA and overall IT governance pro-
cesses, specify runtime practices and design policies, and define and assign key roles 
and responsibilities.
It is rather clear from these success factors that it takes a determined corporate commit-
ment to pursue SOA initiatives and to achieve a useful outcome.

442
Engineering Management
A European-based telecommunications and Internet provider doubled its corporate size 
in 2005 by merging with two other companies. The organization wanted to become more 
flexible in managing its business lines, reducing staff costs, and ensuring high levels of 
subscriber support. Hewlett-Packard, one of several major SOA service providers, imple-
mented HP SOA Management and HP SOA Systinet programs to better align the compa-
ny’s IT project management and the organizations’ business strategies. The SOA initiative 
was focused on managing its assets and monitoring service performance. The following 
programs were introduced:
•	 HP SOA Systinet: Governance
•	 HP SOA Policy Enforcer and HP Diagnostics: Service monitoring
•	 HP Business Availability Center for SOA: Service availability
The benefits realized include: (a) 33% increase in services uptime, (b) 50% reduction in 
time to market for new services, and (c) 30% savings in total service management costs. 
The average annual benefits had been in excess of $5,900,000 (Anonymous 2008). Krafzig 
et al. (2004) contains additional SOA application cases of interest in the service industry, 
including (1) Deutsche Post AG (German post office), (2) Winterthur Group (insurance), 
(3) Credit Suisse (financial services), and (4) Halifax Bank of Scotland (financial services). 
Interested readers should consult these references.
Currently, countless service companies have invested in building and maintaining in-
house computer facilities to provide the required business analysis and other computing 
activities in support of their business objectives. In the future, such computing needs may 
be satisfied by running software hosted by prominent vendors. This is similar to today’s 
industrial and residential consumers who buy electricity from electric utilities, rather than 
producing electricity with their own small-scale generators.
Proponents of SOA technology predict that there will be an IT utility, similar to the 
electric utility industry, from which service enterprises would “buy” or “rent” selected 
computing service packages, instead of each maintaining its own data centers and creat-
ing specific software application modules. This SOA approach will expedite the end of cor-
porate computing (Carr 2005), because of its obvious impact on costs, speed, and process 
flexibility of business computing. Because of its flexible and logical design architecture, 
SOA has a pretty bright future. SOA is likely to make service enterprise more cost-efficient, 
productive, and fast responding in a highly competitive marketplace.
12.2.3.3  Cloud Computing
Cloud computing (Helfert et al. 2014) is a service concept, by which client companies and 
individual customers are able to “rent” computing services from specific vendor compa-
nies that are capable of accessing distributed and unused computing assets. This is espe-
cially important when a service enterprise is in need of such on-demand and “pay-as-you 
use” computing power, which exceeds its in-house capabilities.
The computing world is continuing its evolutional changes, from mainframe to mini-
computers, to desktop personal computers, and now to the era of personalized comput-
ers, through the massive use of tablets and smartphones. The cloud, like a mainframe 
in the sky, is capable of delivering personalized, distributed computing efficiently. Users 
may access their personal clouds using a variety of Internet-connected gateway screens or 
devices.

443
Operational Excellence
As of now, Apple has its iCloud solution, which can store pictures, music, movies, and 
other files in the cloud for ready access by the users. Amazon and Google are known to 
have similar services in development. Other screens to connect to the cloud are very likely 
to become available in the future.
12.2.3.4  Mobile Computing
Mobile computing (Kumar et al. 2012) refers to a computing environment with physical 
mobility such that users are enabled to access data, information, or other logical objects 
from any device and in any network, while on the move. It allows a user to perform a task 
from anywhere using a computing device in the public (the web), corporate (business 
information), and personal information spaces (medical records, address book). The func-
tions of mobile computing include the mobility of user, network, bearer, device, session, 
service, and host. Access to information and virtual objects through mobile comput-
ing enables the optimal use of resources and thus results in increased productivity. In 
addition, mobile computing is becoming increasingly useful, as reaching customers via 
their movable communications devices adds the factor of convenience to the customer 
experience.
12.2.4  Big Data
Big data are high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that require 
new ways of processing (e.g., massively parallel software running on thousands of servers) 
in order to inform decision-making, discover insights, and pursue process optimization. 
(Beyer and Douglas 2012). Examples of such data sets include web logs, social networks, 
social data, Internet text and documents, Internet search indexing, call detail records, 
medical records, large-scale e-commerce, photography archives, and video archives. In 
addition, the amount of traffic flowing over the Internet is projected to have reached 669 
exabytes by 2013. Wal-Mart is said to handle more than one million customer transactions 
every hour, which are imported into databases estimated to contain more than 2.5 pet-
abytes of data—the equivalent of 167 times the information contained in all the books in 
the U.S. Library of Congress (The Economist 2010).
Developed economies make increasing use of data-intensive technologies. As big data 
represents a rich source of information, which could be mined to foster competitive advan-
tages, its systematic use will have an important impact on services in the future.
The IBM Watson supercomputer won the Jeopardy! game show on February 16–18, 2011, 
against two of the best-known human experts. This represented a significant break-
through in natural language interface, data process, and self-learning. Soon after this vic-
tory, IBM signed a contract with Wellpoint Inc. to process massive amounts of patient 
databases (e.g., medical history, genetics, biometric fluctuation, and other factors), in order 
to assist physicians and nurses in arriving at more accurate and evidence-based diagnosis 
and treatment options. In 2012, Citibank engaged IBM to utilize its Watson technology for 
analyzing customer data, with the purpose of offering new personalized banking services 
centered on the customer’s digital and mobile lifestyles.
In 2015, IBM established a new business unit called Watson Heath to focus on the devel-
opment of new applications of Watson technologies in health care, taking advantage of 
various empirical rules and heuristics in the medical fields.
Such a new technology, once further perfected, could likely raise corporate perfor-
mance in various fields, which are enabled by rapid case evaluations. Additional future 

444
Engineering Management
applications may reach data-intensive service sections, such as radiology, legal, financial, 
engineering, retail, and professional business and engineering consulting.
12.3  Implementation of Operational Excellence
In order to achieve OE, enterprises are recommended to select the projects, evaluate their 
financial viability, and check the technical feasibilities in view of the resources available, 
before going forward with the project implementation. It is highly advisable that these 
steps be implemented systematically.
12.3.1  Selection of OE Projects
These projects should be selected primarily to influence the customer’s perception of the 
service offered. Preference should be given to advancing processes and work activities that 
are involved in service customization procedure, new service codevelopment, customer 
problem solving, service support programs, customer access to service information, man-
agement of service supply chains, and others concentrating on constantly improving the 
value of supplemental service elements to customers. Specifically: (1) Assuring competi-
tive advantages by utilizing corporate know-how to customize service and to bring about 
value beyond the customer’s expectations. (2) Streamlining those processes that allow 
customer-facing agents to rapidly access corporate knowledge when servicing customers. 
(3) Management of customer-centered projects, including access to in-house and exter-
nal resources. (4) Customer support processes (e.g., web pages, call centers). (5) Business 
processes, such as marketing and customer management, including the collection and pro-
cessing of customer feedback. (6) Other internal business processes, such as order entries, 
invoicing, financial control, supply chain management, and production.
12.3.2  Financial Viability of Selected OE Projects
Once a specific OE project is defined, its financial viability should be convincingly 
demonstrated before seeking managerial approval for implementation. Such a project may 
require the following resources: (1) Capital investments related to the use of the OE tools 
(e.g., Lean Six Sigma, web service, or SOA development). (2) Maintenance expenditure 
for the selected OE tools. (3) Employee training costs and expenses of new hires, if any. 
(4) Projected reduction of operations costs. (5) Projected life of the OE project in years. 
(6) Cost of money.
Let us assume that a business unit (e.g., department, regional organization or the whole 
service enterprise) is considering the deployment of a specific OE tool. Table 12.2 displays 
its multiple-year income statement before the introduction of such a tool, the base case. The 
number of years assumed in this income statement should be compatible with the time 
span, during which the OE tool is expected to remain effective. This base case is to be set 
up following the methods indicated in Chapter 7.
Table  12.3 shows the multiple-year income statement of the same business unit, but 
including the financial impact derived from the use of the OE tool, the improved case. 
An investment of $1,500,000 is assumed to be required to initiate this OE project and the 
estimated reduction in operations expenses is 20% (Row 4). Obviously, the estimated cost

reduction must be convincingly verified using past cases. Again, the present value of its 
cash flow is then calculated.
Tables 12.2 and 12.3 indicate that the present value of cash flow for the improved case is 
$34,327,000, whereas that of the base case is $31,630,000, an increase of $2,697,000. However, 
subtracting the assumed investment of $1,500,000 from this increase, the net gain for this 
example case turns out to be $1,197,000. This net gain number must be positive for any 
OE project to be worth implementing in the first place. Of course, the higher this net gain

number, which represents the net economic value added, the more valuable the OE project 
will be to the enterprise.
Additional details of such multiple-year income statements are explained in Chang 
(2005b), as well as in any financial accounting textbook (Libby et al. 2013).
12.3.3  Technical Feasibility
After the financial viability of the OE project is proved, it is also useful to review the 
question of technical feasibility during the planning stage. Can the project be implemented 
based on the available people, schedule, technological tools, financial resources, and 
managerial attention? Some technological tools (e.g., the previously described web-based 
enablers) need to be acquired, installed, and customized before they can be efficiently 
utilized. Staff should be properly trained for them to contribute to the project.
The answer to this feasibility question should be yes before the project is approved for 
implementation.
12.3.4  Management Commitment
It is important to ensure the commitment of the enterprise in terms of alignment with 
business objectives, definition of specific project goals, appointment of a project leader, 
allocation of resources, and project time lines before the initiation of an OE project.
12.3.5  Project Execution
An approved OE project delivers value only when it is implemented properly by having 
achieved its stated objective on time and within the allocated budget. Activities involved 
in this phase include planning, resource allocation, task organization, progress monitor-
ing, and problem and conflict resolution. Commercial project management tools may be 
used to facilitate these activities.
Products/service enterprises favor leaders who are well versed in securing corporate 
commitment, defining project objectives, scheduling tasks and people, promoting team 
collaboration, resolving conflicts, managing uncertainties, controlling quality, planning 
for unexpected contingencies, monitoring tightly all tasks on the critical path, making 
midcourse corrections, if needed, and securing customer feedback.
Seeking customer feedback is useful to gauge the degree of project usefulness to the 
intended users. This is to allow a continuous betterment of future projects. Advanced 
tools for managing projects should be engaged to guide the implementation of com-
plex projects, to promote (a) project transparencies, (b) fast access to data, (c) rapid com-
munication to allow quick decision-making, and (d) recordkeeping and knowledge 
management.
12.3.6  Documentation and Lessons Preservation
At the completion of an OE project, a comprehensive project report should be prepared to 
include: (a) a summary of results and review comments, (b) unique experiences acquired, 
(c) lessons learned, and (d) insights garnered. This is to make sure that what is learned in 
this project could be applied to other projects in the future and that the enterprise contin-
ues to accumulate useful insights and becomes smarter over time.

447
Operational Excellence
STEM professionals should strive to initiate new OE projects on a regular basis by identi-
fying new opportunities to whittle down costs, reduce cycle time, increase customer value, 
justify them financially, and execute them in time and within budget. It would be useful to 
aim at improving these operations by, say, 5% or more every year.
12.3.7  Organizational Resizing due to Operational Excellence
Success in achieving laudable results in OE could cause some employees to become 
redundant. If employees who work hard to actively contribute to improve efficiency and 
productivity are not being properly taken care of, they will feel betrayed, leading to a 
deterioration in the morale of surviving employees, which in turn could trigger voluntary 
turnover, possibly causing the organization to be deprived of the critical skills and tacit 
knowledge needed to continue pursuing OE (see Smith 2011).
Also of concern is the potential work overload of surviving employees due to an 
efficiency-induced organizational resizing. A case in point is Red Lobster, which in 2011 
required its waitresses to serve four tables, instead of the original three, while cutting food 
walkers at the same time. The company had to reverse this productivity improvement 
policy in 2013, after having registered employee complaints, customer dissatisfaction, and 
a sizable reduction in business.
Service companies may initiate the following few steps, known in the industry, to mini-
mize such adverse consequence:
	
1.	Create new job opportunities to absorb these people, such as (a) initiating new ser-
vices developed by the company’s strategic differentiation efforts; (b) expanding the 
activities of new technology or business units acquired by the company, if avail-
able; (c) jobs opened up in business units spanned off from the company; (d) jobs 
made available internally due to work redesign for creating new value to customers; 
(e) opportunities due to entering new markets to serve new customers; and others.
	
2.	Maintain an up-to-date inventory of needed skills and capabilities and train all 
employees, possibly by Internet-based tools, to enable their transition into new job 
assignments. Plan well to avoid overloading surviving employees with excessive 
work.
	
3.	Implement knowledge management programs to preserve, update, and reuse 
critical insights and tacit knowledge for enhancing corporate competitiveness in a 
systematic manner.
	
4.	Communicate clearly that the organization must periodically adjust its size to meet 
the ever-changing needs dictated by technological advancement, service innova-
tions, marketplace competition, and shifting customer demands. The company 
would also devise a long-term plan for implementing the right organizational 
resizing program when needed.
	
5.	Apply some short-term cost reduction tactics to delay downsizing, such as (a) 
reduced work week, (b) unpaid leave of absence, (c) early retirement incentives, 
(d) job sharing, (e) buyout incentives, (f) facility shutdown, (g) salary reduction, 
(g) minimize expense budget, (h) partially paid employee sabbaticals, and others 
(Cameron 1994).
	
6.	Offer extensive post-layoff support to affected people, such as outplacement 
services, job search assistance, counseling, relocation assistance, and others.

12.4  Conclusions
In this chapter, we emphasized the importance of achieving OE for any product/service 
enterprise. OE is focused on doing things right (as related to internal work processes, 
customer problem solving, corporate knowledge management practices, speed of service 
delivery, and other supplemental service elements important to customers). It addresses 
issues related to cost, service quality, service availability, and work process reliability in 
order to maximize current corporate net income, and hence cash flow. For profit-oriented 
product/service enterprises, if there is no cash flow, there could be no activity and hence 
no corporate profitability. OE is centered on preserving the short-term performance of an 
enterprise.
As the marketplace becomes increasingly competitive on a global scale, STEM profes-
sionals and leaders should strive for OE on a continuous basis. Besides invoking the stan-
dard engineering management functions of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling 
to projects, teams, processes, and activities, they need to become versed in utilizing tools 
described in this chapter, such as Lean Six Sigma, web-based applications software, web 
services, and the low-cost and flexible computing capabilities offered by an emergent SOA-
based IT utility. It would be wise for STEM professionals and leaders to keep lots of irons 
in the fire and go with whichever ones come to fruition.
Each of the tools described in this chapter has its rightful place in any enterprise, to be 
applied under the right circumstances. Reducing process speed is the primary drive of 
the Lean principle. Service quality is emphasized by the process-standardizing approach, 
by following the best practices established in the industries, and by practicing Six Sigma 
methodologies. The combination of Lean and Six Sigma will simplify work complexity. 
The application of value stream mapping helps to identify wastes, which are tasks that do 
not add value. OE is accomplished by having increased process speed, enhanced service 
quality, and minimized service costs. OE can be further enhanced by an increase in pro-
ductivity, if web-based applications software is selectively employed on a pay-as-you-go 
basis.
Service contains a number of support elements, most of which are amenable to standard-
ization, and the premise of Lean Six Sigma. The core service elements are exceptions; they 
cannot be readily standardized because of the differences in customers’ needs. The use of 
web services and the emergent SOA-based computing model appears to offer an unprec-
edentedly high degree of operational flexibility, in addition to business computing agility 
and software reusability, which would enhance the optimization of these core service ele-
ments to achieve an improved level of service customization.
These tools should be seriously considered by STEM professionals and leaders when 
they strive to discover optimized approaches to deal with problems or opportunities in the 
future. They ought to keep themselves current with the future advancements reported in 
the emerging business computing domains.
For STEM professionals and leaders to contribute effectively to creating OE, they are 
advised to be: (1) knowledgeable of the relevant best practices in industry and familiar 
with new applications that generate new benefits for others; (2) capable of selecting, modi-
fying, and implementing productivity/efficiency tools; (3) versed in conducting the basic 
management functions of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling as applied to 
projects, teams, programs, technologies, and other resources; and (4) supportive of the 
corporate drive to seek continuous improvement in all work processes, especially in those 
that have a direct impact on customers.

449
Operational Excellence
Governmental pressure is likely to force more health-care enterprises to become opera-
tionally efficient. Most enterprises will be compelled to practice many of these OE tools 
due to marketplace competition. Continuous improvement requires a commitment to 
learning. It is highly advisable for STEM professionals and leaders to constantly look out 
for opportunities to advance the level of OE of their enterprises.

of maintaining their own in-house computing data centers, much like how busi-
ness, commercial, and residential customers buy electricity today. What are the 
potential concerns to service enterprises, which become dependent on the IT 
utility, insofar as operation and financial risks are concerned?
Appendix: “Service” Model
Lean Six Sigma may be usefully applied to service-related work processes by following the 
seven-step SERVICE model described in this section:
	
1.	Study customer value: Select those tasks/processes and activities that are likely to 
invigorate customer satisfaction. Lovelock and Writz (2014) illustrate the service 
value package as consisting of a core benefit supported by eight supplemental ser-
vice elements (see Figure 12.A1). For a service to be appreciated by customers, 
both the core and its supplemental elements should be fresh and well formulated, 
because all of them will affect the overall perception registered by the customers. 
This model fits well with different service value packages, although not all supple-
mental service elements are equally important to different core services. Some 
supplemental service elements engage the customers directly, thus having a more 
profound impact on influencing the customer’s perception than others. A useful 
way to prioritize the target activities for applying Lean Six Sigma is then to look at 
the core and the supplemental elements of the service value packages offered by 
the enterprise.
	
	
Processes that go into a service can also be classified into the types of highly 
customized, mass customized, and standardized. Among these three types, the 
best candidates for applying Lean Six Sigma are the standardized processes,

such as payroll and benefit processing, credit card account services, and fast-food 
services, according to Biolos (2002).
	
2.	Evaluate these service elements and map their relative values to customers. Take a 
cross-functional view to screen out activities that do not add value and to identify 
activities that cause processing delays (Martin and Osterling 2013).
	
3.	Refine the work flow diagrams to preserve process data and materials for analysis.
	
4.	Validate and improve on cycle time, and adopt the pull strategy to expand Lean Six 
Sigma activities. By way of promotion and corporate endorsement, company 
employees are inspired to voluntarily participate, so that the Lean Six Sigma 
projects are to be pulled through all units of the company. In order to encour-
age employee buy-in and acceptance, it is advisable for the service enterprise to 
start with a meaningful but self-contained project that does not require changes 
of other processes, and then to promote the resulting successes aggressively.
	
5.	Institutionalize the drive for continuous improvement—applying the DMAIC pro-
cess of Six Sigma to the target process/activities in order to upgrade quality and 
productivity.
	
	
Define service defect and the ways to measure it. From the customer’s stand-
point, a service defect is a flaw in a process that results in a lower level of customer 
satisfaction, higher service turn-around time, or a lost customer.
	
	
Consumers’ Checkbook, an independent rating organization, uses the follow-
ing metrics to rate banking services: (a) overall, (b) pleasantness of staff, (c) knowl-
edge of staff, (d) speed of service, (e) reasonableness of fee policies, (f) convenience 
of hours, and (g) clarity of written communications (Lovelock and Wirtz 2014).
	
6.	Call out the complexities hidden in the process and activities, using both value 
stream mapping and Six Sigma. Complexities are brought about by service dif-
ferentiations. Standardizing the supplemental service elements may be useful to 
eliminate complexities. Since the core service elements are usually customized 
and thus highly differentiated, eliminating those supplemental service elements 
that do not contribute to profitability will help. The outcome of eliminating com-
plexities will be the reduction of costs and wastes.
	
7.	Excel in delivering a Six Sigma level of service quality at lean speed and low 
cost. Lean Six Sigma is an important productivity tool for various service oper-
ations. Some lessons learned in employing Lean Six Sigma may be found in 
(George 2010). Service professionals and leaders are advised to appreciate its 
strategic importance to service enterprises and implement the SERVICE model 
properly.

Globalization
13.1  Introduction
Globalization is defined by the International Monetary Fund as the growing economic 
interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of 
cross-border exchanges in goods, services, international capital flows, and technologies. 
As the boundaries between countries, industries, and market segments crumble, everyone 
is facing a plethora of competition.
Globalization is not a new phenomenon. International trade and commerce have a very 
long history. In recent years, the growth of the world economy and the migration of goods, 
services, capital, people, and technologies across borders have increased. The rapid expan-
sion of the digital economy has also helped to accelerate the pace of globalization (Ritzer 
and Dean 2015; Rupp et al. 2014). Some American companies are expanding to reach new 
global markets and foreign resources. Instead of only a few countries handling the trade 
of most currencies and goods, now many more countries play a part. American compa-
nies are actively pursuing markets in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and other regions. 
Examples of such companies include Wal-Mart, Exxon-Mobile, General Electric, Bank of 
America, Ford, and IBM. Some foreign-owned companies have achieved more sales rev-
enues outside their home countries than in their respective domestic markets (Gupta et al. 
2008). Although the domestic automobile market in Japan continues to fluctuate, Toyota is 
expanding aggressively in the United States, Europe, and China. As reported by Fortune 
Magazine recently, Toyota has now surpassed Ford as the number-two automaker in the 
world, just slightly behind General Motors in global unit sales.
Globalization is recognized as one of six mega trends (Vielmetter and Sell 2014). The 
other five mega trends that will impact on business in the years to come are (1) environ-
mental crisis, (2) the digital era, (3) technological innovations, (4) aging populations, and 
(5) mobility of self-centered professional workers.
In this chapter, we will explore various management issues related to globalization 
(Seitz and Hite 2012). Our emphasis will be steps that science, technology, engineering, 
and math (STEM) professionals and leaders may take to seize new opportunities offered 
by globalization.
13.2  Global Trends and Commerce
The world economy has become interdependent in recent decades. The worldwide 
integration of national economies—through the trade of goods, services, capital, and 

456
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
technologies—has become broad and deep. As a percentage of its gross national products 
(GNP), the United States has seen its trade (the sum of import and export values) increase 
steadily over the last several decades. Another indicator of global trade activities is the 
constant increase in the strategic alliances formed between multinational companies.
13.2.1  New Trends in Global Market
There is indeed a huge tectonic change in the global landscape. Several trends are gener-
ally noticeable among the global companies. Large corporations are steadily increasing 
their scale and scope. Mega-institutions have disproportionately high profits and market 
values, as they take advantage of the talents of their professionals and knowledge workers. 
The book value of these large companies is shrinking, as they compete with the knowl-
edge and talents of their employees, instead of the physical assets on the ground. These 
large companies produce more profit per employees.
Also noticeable are several trends that affect the global business markets: (1) innovation 
(in products, services, and business models), (2) free flow of information, (3) expanded 
access to talent, (4) availability of cheap labor, (5) increase in low-cost competitors, and 
(6) reduction of trade barriers.
McKinsey Corporation conducted a survey among over 3600 business managers in 
Mach 2007, which identified a set of 14 global trends; these trends, listed in the order of 
their relative impact on business, are
	
1.	Growing numbers of consumers in emerging economies (by 2025, China alone is 
projected to have 520 million upper-middle-class consumers; this is the market of 
the future)
	
2.	Increasing availability of knowledge/ability to explore global opportunities
	
3.	Increasingly global labor and talents markets
	
4.	Shifting economic activities between and within regions
	
5.	Development of technologies that empower consumers and communities
	
6.	A faster pace of technological innovation
	
7.	Increasing constraints on supply or usage of natural resources
	
8.	An aged population in developed economies
	
9.	Geopolitical instability
	 10.	Increasing sophistication of the capital markets
	 11.	Adoption of increasingly scientific management techniques
	 12.	Shifting industry structure/emerging form of organization
	 13.	Social backlash against corporate activity
	 14.	Growth of public sector
Battelle, a company focused on technology development, commercialization, and prod-
uct development with 7500 employees and an annual revenue of about $1 billion, identified 
10 technology-centered trends for the next 20 years:
	
1.	Genetic-based medical and health care
	
2.	High-power energy packages

457
Globalization
	
3.	Green-integrated technologies to produce recyclable products and eliminate solid 
wastes
	
4.	Omnipresent computing (big data, business analytics, and Watson-type artificial 
intelligence processing)
	
5.	Nanomachines to enable localized drug delivery to attack cancer cells
	
6.	Personalized public transportation
	
7.	Designer foods and crops
	
8.	Intelligent goods and appliances
	
9.	Worldwide inexpensive and safe water
	 10.	Super sense (with enhanced reality for hearing)
Global companies are expected to plan accordingly by initiating timely actions to seize 
new opportunities and minimize related risks.
13.2.2  Multinational Enterprises
Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are those that operate in more than one country. As of 
2001, there were about 45,000 MNEs in the world. These enterprises play important roles in 
the global economy. They hold 90% of all technology and product patents worldwide, and 
conduct 70% of world trade (30% of which is intracompany). These enterprises also pursue 
diversified businesses, such as mining; refining and distributing oil, gasoline, diesel, and 
jet fuel; building energy plants; extracting minerals; making and selling automobiles, air-
planes, communication satellites, computers, home electronics, chemicals, medicines, and 
biotechnology products; harvesting wood and making paper; and growing crops and pro-
cessing and distributing food products. Furthermore, these enterprises induce govern-
ments to form treaties and trading blocks among the European Union, the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Multilateral 
Agreement on Investment, and the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). These treaties tend to provide great power and authority for MNEs to 
pursue globalization, thus increasingly undercutting the authority and power of national 
governments and local communities.
The 500 largest MNEs are responsible for 80% of all foreign direct investments (FDIs). Of 
these MNEs, 443 are located in only three regions: the United States, the European Union, 
and Japan. (A detailed distribution of these major MNEs is presented in Figure 13.1.)
Available trade data illustrate the extent of dominance by the MNEs operating in the 
triad regions (e.g., NAFTA, European Union, and Asia). Most of the export trades recorded 
have been within the three regions. The total exports from these three regions to countries 
outside the regions was only a minor percentage of the total. As a result, some researchers 
charge that the operations of these MNEs are de facto regional, not global (Rugman 2012).
If we take a longer-term view, we cannot afford to ignore the forecast made by the World 
Bank (1992). According to this forecast, by 2020 the largest economies in the world are 
projected to be China, the United States, Japan, India, and Indonesia. According to an 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook (WEO) report of October 
2015, China is already the largest global economy based on purchasing power parity (PPP) 
(see Table 13.1).
Economic growth rates in emerging markets for the future are predicted to be 3 to 10 
times that of the United States. About 50% of worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) 

458
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
will be generated in emerging markets. Consequently, we should expect that the situation 
just described (i.e., the MNEs having only regional operations for now and the home bases 
of the top 500 largest MNEs being concentrated in the triad regions) will surely change 
in the years to come. The roles played by the emerging countries in Asia, such as China, 
India, and Indonesia, could become substantial indeed. The extent of trade and commerce 
globalization is expected to further increase.
Goldman Sachs, an investment firm based in New York, studied the GDP of both the 
G6 (composed of the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, and Italy) and BRICS 
nations (BRICS is an abbreviation for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). Canada 
is normally part of the G7 nations, but is excluded in this study because its GDP is only about 
3% of the G7 total. Goldman Sachs predicts that by 2037, the total GDP of BRICS will match 
that of G6. Should this prediction hold true, it would mean that the next phase of globaliza-
tion would be manifested in the expansion of global economic activities from being centered 
on the G6 nations at the present time to encompass the BRICS within the next 30-plus years, 
and that high economic growth rates would be found primarily in BRICS nations.
This type of forecast is, of course, valid only in the absence of any disruptive events, 
such as wars, global economic recessions, or natural disasters. Nevertheless, it does foretell

Globalization
the emergence of some developing economies and the increased degree of cross-border 
exchanges in the years ahead.
13.2.3  Ownership of Global Companies
The five major stakeholders of any company are customers, employees, suppliers, inves-
tors, and the communities in which the company operates.
A large number of global companies manufacture products/services designed to reach 
global customers, employ workers from different countries, source materials and compo-
nents from suppliers in global markets, interact with local communities at global locations, 
and have global investors. In recent years, countless countries have been setting up stock 
exchanges and security markets to attract foreign or domestic investments. Nowadays, it 
is easy for an investor to become a shareholder of any global company that is traded in one 
of many public stock exchanges.
As illustrated in Figure 13.2, the ownership of Nestlé, a well-known MNE, is quite global 
indeed. No single Nestlé shareholder owns more than 3% of the company stocks. This 
trend of global ownership is expected to continue as the capital markets become more 
accessible to investors residing in various countries. Over time, companies will diligently 
apply innovative global marketing strategies to sell products/services to global customers, 
in order to create value for a global ownership.
Example 13.1
What are some practical reasons for a company to ever want to expand into the world 
of international business?
Answer 13.1
The reasons for a company to want to expand into the global markets are plentiful. The 
following are the primary few:
	
1.	 Desire to expand markets (finding new customers): For companies whose products 
have been selling in a saturated domestic market at home, expanding into 
global markets represents an attractive opportunity to find new customers.
	
	
Theodore Levitt (Harvard Business Review editor) proposes the idea that the 
characteristics of some products are converging, making them more and more

universal, thus allowing companies to market them to the global marketplace. 
Companies may be able to derive advantages based on the global economies 
of scale. However, in order to do well, companies will need to understand the 
local customers, business practices, and cultures of global customers.
	
2.	 Search for natural resources: Companies pursue foreign investments to avail 
themselves of resources that may otherwise not be readily available. U.S. 
investments in Saudi Arabia and various U.S. offshore gas exploration projects 
are the prime examples.
	
3.	 Proximity to customers: Companies expand into the global marketplace to be 
closer to their customers, for the sole purpose of understanding and serving 
them better, faster, and cheaper. Some products require customization in order 
to enrich the value offered to the customer. Customer satisfaction will increas-
ingly become a key competitive focus. Companies that are in a position to 
understand their customers more thoroughly and are able to customize their 
products better, will have a significant advantage in the marketplace.
	
4.	 Labor savings: Today, certain developing countries offer skilled labor at a frac-
tion of the cost needed to hire similar workers in the home countries of numer-
ous major companies. Mexico is a prime example. Many U.S. companies have 
set up manufacturing shops in Mexico. The products made there are shipped 
back to the United States for distribution and marketing. Several other coun-
tries, such as China, India, the Philippines, and Thailand, are also candidates 
for companies to realize labor savings in certain types of products or services.
	
5.	 Access to innovative talents: A large number of U.S. companies are known to 
have set up research and development (R&D) centers in China, India, and 
Russia to engage talented professionals for various creative ventures.
Example 13.2
When companies attempt to pursue global markets, which common entry strategies are 
deployed?
Answer 13.2
There are several common entry strategies into global markets. In general, companies 
are well advised to first study the relative attractiveness of the target market (e.g., specific 
segments in different countries) by considering factors such as profitability, market size, 
and market growth. In addition, companies need to assess the degree of acceptance of 
their products in these targeted marketplaces (e.g., brand name, competitive position, 
and market access). Once the most favorable product–market-segment pairs are selected, 
companies may pursue these global markets by (1) exporting, (2) licensing or contract-
ing manufacturing, (3) forming joint ventures with local partners, (4) creating a foreign 
branch of the company, and/or (5) establishing a foreign subsidiary of the company.
13.3  United Nations Statistics and Goals
Statistics published by the World Trade Organization (WTO) indicate that world trade, 
defined as the total value of export, has increased about 400% over the last 30 years at a 
compound growth rate of 5.5% per year.
It is well known that countries open to global trade grow twice as fast as those that 
remain relatively closed to trade. At least two African nations, Nigeria and Tanzania, have 

461
Globalization
chosen to rely on protectionism, foreign aid, and inefficient public policy. Today, they 
remain at the 1960s economic development levels of Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. 
In recent years, Latin America has started to embrace market liberalization. It has aban-
doned its old policies of a dominant state presence in the economy, import substitution, 
and domestic industry protection. The results of these changes are encouraging, and more 
countries are expected to jump on the globalization bandwagon.
According to the World Bank (2001), the world output is projected to increase 33% 
from $30 trillion in 2001 to $40 trillion in 2010. The disposable income in regions such as 
China, India, Southeast Asia, and Latin America will double over the same period. About 
300 million people (roughly the size of the population of the United States) will join the 
thriving worldwide middle class in the next 10 years (Kochhar 2015).
On the other hand, World Bank statistics also show that, from 1990 to 2000, only about 
800 million people moved out of absolute poverty, which is defined as having less than 
one U.S. dollar per day of income. As of 2001, 50% of the world population lived on less 
than $2 per day. Eighty percent of the global population lives on less than 20% of the global 
income.
The United Nations (UN) has declared that one of its goals is to decrease the number of 
people in absolute poverty by 50% by 2015. Globalization is regarded as a key process in 
achieving this very meaningful goal (Lamberton 2002).
13.4  Great Philosophical Debate about Globalization
Not everyone favors globalization. It creates winners and losers. Generally speaking, gov-
ernment leaders of both large and small countries are in favor of globalization because of 
its heightened opportunities for FDI, transfer of technology and best practices, and trade 
benefits. Business leaders are strong advocates of globalization for many reasons, includ-
ing the following: (1) greater flow of trade and investments stimulates economic growth; 
(2) rising outputs bring about employment and income, which means higher living stan-
dards for consumers; (3) higher living standards facilitate a greater social willingness to 
devote resources to the environment, education, health care, and other social goals; (4) 
global competition keeps domestic business competitive and innovative, which leads to 
higher quality output and productivity; (5) rapidly developing economies tend to gener-
ate a new middle class that is the bulwark of support for personal liberty and economic 
freedom.
Opponents of all stripes and creeds blame globalization for many of the world’s ills 
(Stiglitz 2003). They are primarily from three major groups: labor union members, human 
rights activists, and environmentalists.
The labor union wants to protect local jobs in industrialized countries, as globalization 
will likely induce MNEs to transfer manufacturing and other high-paying jobs to emerg-
ing economy regions in search of cost-competitiveness. They also raise the issues of child 
labor and forced labor in poor countries, citing past incidents of exploitation by MNEs.
The human rights groups claim that local economic growth induced by globalization in 
some emerging countries may allow their respective dictatorships to stay in power lon-
ger, thus indirectly supporting continued suppression of the people. Globalization would 
become an inadvertent coalition partner in crime against humanity (Nault and England 
2011).

462
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
The environmentalists believe that, by relocating their manufacturing operations to 
developing countries with lower environmental control standards, the MNEs are essen-
tially exporting pollution and other environmentally unacceptable practices to the poor 
countries, thus causing irreversible damages (Shenkar et al. 2014).
These three groups are united in their opposition to globalization. Their reasoning is 
further summarized as follows:
	
1.	Globalization is a conspiracy of big companies exploiting less-developed coun-
tries. It concentrates market power in the hands of a few large corporations, allow-
ing them to trample over smaller commercial rivals and flourish at the expense 
of small companies and consumers. Globalization is akin to companies without 
rules.
	
2.	Globalization promotes the suppression of human rights in developing countries.
	
3.	Globalization destroys the environment.
	
4.	Globalization spreads terrorism, narcotics, disease, and money laundering 
(Condon 2002; Kugler and Frost 2002; Horowitz 2003).
	
5.	Globalization lowers labor standards and turns emerging economy nations’ work-
ers into “slaves.”
	
6.	Information technology (IT) is a “tool for evil” in globalization.
	
7.	Globalization takes away jobs from the United States.
	
8.	Globalization undermines cultural diversity.
	
9.	Globalization widens the gap between the rich and the poor.
Some of the arguments in opposition to the antiglobalization views include
	
1.	Representation: Numerous antiglobalization demands reflect the values of young, 
middle-class U.S. and EU consumers. They may not be the true representative 
voice for the emerging economy countries they claim to speak for.
	
2.	Dominance: Globalization does not mean the triumph of giant companies over 
small ones. A case in point is Nokia versus Motorola. Nokia is small in size and 
dynamic in marketing strategy; this attests to the fact that corporate size is not a 
requirement for global success. Globalization does shift the balance of advantages 
from local incumbents (big or small) to foreign challengers. Protection barriers 
such as the high cost of capital and the difficulty of acquiring new technologies 
are gradually removed over time.
	
3.	Environment: It is partially correct that globalization may indeed affect the envi-
ronmental conditions in some emerging economy countries. Their competition to 
attract foreign investment could accelerate the importation of production plants 
that generate carbon dioxide, toxic wastes, and other environmentally unaccept-
able discharges.
	
	
It is true that any pollution discharged into the ambient air by a production 
plant is bad for the environment. In the United States, various environmental 
regulations for reducing harmful emissions were enacted only after many tough 
struggles between big business and government. The key issue is how to bal-
ance the value created by greenness with that produced by wealth and economic 
progress. While the United States can afford to go green at present, its current 

463
Globalization
environmental standards may not be appropriate to impose on other countries 
that are in situations comparable to the United States in the 1960s.
	
	
Thus, the acceptable degree of greenness for a given country is not to be decided 
by rich countries’ environmentalists. For India and other countries, wealth gener-
ation may be more pressing in the short run than environmental greenness. This 
is why currently the governments of various emerging economy countries wel-
come globalization and do not share the views of environmentalists in developed 
countries.
	
	
However, some local governments and global companies have different views. 
Levi Strauss established ethical manufacturing standards for its overseas opera-
tions. Home Depot adopted an ecofriendly lumber supply program. Starbucks 
buys coffee from farmers who preserve forests.
	
4.	Labor standards: The claim that globalization diminishes labor standards is a ques-
tionable one. The key issues involved are wages, work conditions, and child labor.
	
	
Most FDI is value driven and does not primarily chase after low wages. For 
example, the United States has a positive FDI, meaning that the total amount of 
foreign investment in the United States is larger than the U.S. investment abroad. 
Clearly, this surplus FDI is not driving down U.S. labor standards.
	
	
The governments of emerging economy countries oppose the imposition of the 
current U.S. and EU labor standards on their regions, as doing so will cause them 
to lose the wage advantages they currently enjoy. Imposing an external wage stan-
dard that is not locally sustainable can be harmful, as evidenced in Germany. After 
reunification, West Germany imposed its high wage standards on East Germany. 
The result was an economic disaster: there was zero growth and high unemploy-
ment in the East. The governments of developing countries argue that the Asian 
“Tigers” (e.g., Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore) have convinc-
ingly shown the road to prosperity for developing economies. Each of these coun-
tries started out with low wages and cheap exports and then allowed wages and 
income to rise gradually in concert with the increased value of products/services 
they produce and the improvement in their workers’ skills. Local wages must 
be sustainable in local economies. As expected, all emerging economy countries 
insist on speaking for themselves and want more investment, freer trade, and bet-
ter enforcement of local laws, not the imposition of foreign wage standards.
	
	
In general, global companies do provide higher wages to their workers than 
their local rivals. Some global companies have started paying attention to work-
place conditions as well. Gap and Nike are said to have adopted codes of conduct 
for their overseas plants.
	
	
Child labor is commonly accepted on American farms today and was legal dur-
ing the long period when the United States was a developing country. Imposing 
twenty-first-century labor standards on today’s emerging economy countries thus 
runs the risk of appearing hypocritical. For many families in emerging economy 
countries, child labor may be a major source of income, just as it is on American 
farms today and was for others many years ago.
	
5.	Human rights: The argument that globalization suppresses human rights is also 
a questionable one. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, once a person’s 
physiological needs (clothing, shelter, transportation, and other subsistence needs) 
are met, the next higher levels of needs (social acceptance, peer recognition, and 

464
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
self-actualization) become activated in search of continued personal satisfaction. 
Accordingly, the local population will most likely seek more freedom of speech, 
rights of assembly, and respect for human rights over time, but only after their 
basic subsistence needs are met. An example is Taiwan, which transformed itself 
peacefully from a dictatorship to a democracy through its rapid advancement of 
global trade and economy.
	
6.	Side effects: Globalization promotes free trade and the exchange of goods, ser-
vices, information, money, and technologies across national borders. Indeed, 
there are no effective solutions for minimizing the detrimental side effects of 
increased flows of terrorism, narcotics, disease, and money laundering, unless 
the governments involved are committed to forcefully combat them. In addi-
tion, an aggressive implementation of some of the following programs may help 
(1) enhance educational training for the poor (postsecondary, vocational); (2) 
make social services more widely available; (3) adopt policies to strengthen the 
productive capabilities of all, including the low-income groups; and (4) set up 
safety nets (e.g., social security and unemployment insurance) for those who 
are in need.
It is true that what one believes depends on where one stands. Winners and losers have 
different views on globalization. In the United States, the steel industry is in deep trouble, 
due mainly to cheap imports. The U.S. textile and farm industries need governmental 
subsidies to survive. On the other hand, U.S. high-technology industries (e.g., electronics, 
computers, airplanes, appliances, consumer goods, telecommunications equipment, and 
banking services) are benefiting tremendously from an open global market.
Globalization is an inevitable and unstoppable trend that unfortunately causes dislo-
cations. A prudent approach should be to go forward with globalization while initiat-
ing steps to minimize its detrimental side effects. Examples of such steps include asking 
MNEs to support education and job-skills retraining in emerging economy countries, 
encouraging MNEs to adopt responsible environmental and labor practices when pro-
ducing products/services in host countries, and promoting democracy and respect for 
human rights.
13.5  Impact of Catastrophic Events on Globalization
In recent years, several major events have had a profound impact on the world economy, 
political stability, and peace. These events include the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers 
of the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001; the Iraq War in 2003; 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in South China in 2003; Ebola; ISIS 
uprising in the Middle East; Israel—Palestinian conflicts; Ukraine unrest; U.S. subprime 
conflicts; and the great recession (2008–2009). The immediate consequences of each of 
these events have been an increase in the cost of doing international business and changes 
in business relationships between the United States and other countries. A number of pro-
jected factors may exert a cooling effect on globalization:
	
1. Since the war against terrorism may be protracted, insurance premiums may be 
raised because of heightened security concerns.

465
Globalization
	
2.	Increasing security risks reduce the willingness of business people to travel inter-
nationally and may lead to a reduction in team performance, collaboration, infor-
mation sharing, and knowledge management.
	
3.	A higher return may be demanded to compensate for increased investment risks.
	
4.	Heightened border inspections may slow cargo movements and force companies 
to stock more inventories (such as spare parts).
	
5.	Tighter U.S. immigration policies could curtail the inflow of skilled and blue-col-
lar workers (e.g., from Mexico and Canada to the United States).
	
6.	Time horizons for international projects may be shortened when companies make 
new FDI.
	
7.	The availability of global equities may drop because a smaller number of investors 
are willing to take the added risks involved. FDI to specific countries regarded as 
posing a high risk (e.g., India, Pakistan, the Philippines, parts of South America 
and Southeast Asia, most of the Arab world, and Russia) may be cut.
	
8.	Because of disagreements with U.S. foreign policy, some businesspeople from 
Third World countries may become reluctant to make deals with American 
businesses.
	
9.	High unemployment rates created by the great recession from 2008 to 2009 dis-
couraged foreign, talented professionals to seek employment in the United States.
There are countless specific examples of the rising costs and risks of doing international 
business. U.S. expatriates are leaving Indonesia because of the radical Islamic unrest 
against U.S. and British interests there. Cargo-laden trucks are taking seven hours to cross 
the Laredo, Texas, border crossing, compared with only two hours before the September 
11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Delphi Automotive Systems, which operates 56 plants in Mexico, 
scheduled 200 trucks per day to bring products into the United States before the terrorist 
attacks. Now, the company ships parts in smaller lots more frequently so that it can redi-
rect shipments to planes, boats, or helicopters if the transportation situation so requires.
It may take several years for these effects to dissipate and for the world economy to 
resume a normal growth pattern.
13.6  New Opportunities Offered by Globalization
Globalization offers some unique opportunities for companies to explore. According to 
Gupta and Govindarajan (2001), there are five globalization-specific opportunities avail-
able, namely, (1) adapt to local market differences, (2) exploit economies of global scale, (3) 
exploit economies of global scope, (4) tap optimal locations for activities and resources, and 
(5) maximize knowledge transfer across locations.
13.6.1  Adapting to Local Market Differences
Among local markets, there are major differences in language, culture, income levels, cus-
tomer preferences, distribution systems, business practices, and marketing environment. 
Companies need to adapt their products, services, and processes accordingly.

466
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
Business Week is known to have North American, Asian, and EU editions. Baskin Robbins 
introduced ice cream flavored with green tea in Japan. Coke markets Asian tea (sokenbi-
cha), English tea (kochakaden), coffee drinks not offered by local competitors, and fer-
mented milk drinks in Japan.
Anheuser-Busch Inc. successfully marketed its premium and regular beer products in 
aluminum cans in diverse countries except China. After a careful market study, the com-
pany adapted to local conditions by switching to glass bottles and marketing its premium-
grade beer in large bottles to restaurants and regular-grade beer in small bottles to average 
consumers who buy from their local supermarkets. Budweiser scored a huge sales suc-
cess in China, because this marketing strategy added value to all three parties involved. 
Chinese customers are known to like to show off by ordering premium beer in large bot-
tles when inviting friends to eat in restaurants, typically ordering one big bottle for each 
friend at the table. When they buy beer to consume at home, they want to save money, 
as no one else is around for them to impress. Furthermore, using glass bottles that could 
be readily sourced locally and recycled pleased the Chinese government. These practices 
increased the local labor involved in bottling the contents of the products and eliminated 
solid-waste disposal problems brought into being by aluminum cans. For the company, 
this strategy whittled down the beer product cost by doing away with the need to import 
expensive aluminum cans from the home country.
Whirlpool markets the White Magic washing machine. The company runs a global 
factory network that makes basic models with 70% common parts; the remaining parts 
are readily modifiable to suit local needs. For the Indian market, it conceived a TV-based 
advertisement program to associate Indian housewives’ belief that white means hygiene 
and purity with Whirlpool washing machines designed to be capable specifically of wash-
ing white fabrics in local water. The company offered incentives for local retailers to stock 
washing machines and hired contractors conversant in 18 local languages to deliver prod-
ucts and collect cash payments. Annual sales of Whirlpool washing machines went up 
from $110 million in 1996 to $200 million in 2001—an impressive 80% gain.
Kodak has had tough competition in analog film sales and photo processing services 
from Fuji in Japan, Agfa in Germany, and other global players. In China, Kodak markets its 
franchise business, the chain of Kodak Express photo supply and development shops, to 
small entrepreneurs by (1) supporting the franchisee by offering Kodak equipment as col-
lateral to secure local bank loans, and (2) supplying monthly training services to transfer 
know-how. Kodak was able to establish about 10,000 Kodak Express shops in China by the 
end of 2001. Its Chinese market share increased from 30% in 1995 to 60% in 2001. However, 
Kodak has been in decline since then. So are some other well-known brands, such as Sears, 
Radio Shack, and J.C. Penney.
Not adapting to local conditions could lead to business failure. Walsin-CarTech, a joint 
venture of CarTech with Walsin-Lihwa in Taiwan, planned to build a steel mill in South 
Taiwan to produce 200,000 tons per year of stainless steel and carbon bar, rod, and wire 
products for the world markets. Unexpectedly, the local farmers around the intended plant 
site delayed the installation of electric power lines until they were financially compensated. 
The Taiwan government also complicated the plant’s permitting process. Meanwhile, com-
petitors added their production capacity for stainless steel. The plant needed more invest-
ment capital to build than originally expected. The two-year delay in the plant start-up 
caused the joint venture to miss the window of opportunity. Subsequently, CarTech aban-
doned the joint venture in 1998 and moved on to form a steel joint venture in India.
Adapting to local markets will likely allow companies to increase their market share, 
augment their gross margin due to enhanced value to customers, and neutralize local 

467
Globalization
competition. However, the cost increase associated with local adaptation must be 
commensurate with the value added to customers, inducing them to pay for the higher 
price charged. TGI Friday’s incorporated many local dishes (e.g., kimchi) into its menu 
when it entered the Korean market. This strategy backfired because Korean customers 
wanted to visit TGI Friday’s to taste American, not Korean, food.
The degree of local adaptation may shift over time as the result of the global media, 
international travel variables, and a steady reduction in income disparity. Companies must 
constantly adjust their local adaptation strategies.
13.6.2  Economies of Global Scale
Companies may realize economies of global scale by taking a number of steps, such as (1) 
spreading fixed costs—R&D, operations, and advertising; (2) reducing capital and operat-
ing costs per unit when production capacity is increased; (3) pooling purchase power—
volumetric discounts and lower unit transactions costs by sourcing from a few large 
suppliers; and (4) creating a critical mass of talent—centers of excellence for specific prod-
ucts and technologies.
Autobytel refined a global baseline architecture that consisted of software modules that 
can be snapped together in various combinations, depending on the local needs. There are 
hooks for adding customer software when required. New features invented for a specific 
country may be incorporated back into the baseline if it seems likely that they will be used 
elsewhere.
There are a number of counterbalancing factors to consider. Too much centralization in 
product manufacturing can mandate higher costs of distribution. Concentrated production 
can also isolate the company from the targeted marketplace. Procurement from a few suppli-
ers generates dependency and constraint, insofar as supply disruptions related to labor unrest, 
access to world-class technologies, and utilization of existing competencies are concerned.
13.6.3  Economies of Global Scope
Globalization allows products and services that do not require local adaptation to be mar-
keted to multiple regions and countries. Companies can benefit by
	
1.	Providing coordinated marketing approaches for standard products (e.g., PCs, 
software products, and ketchup used in McDonald’s) to achieve greater consis-
tency in quality, faster or smoother coordination, and lower unit transaction costs.
	
2.	Leveraging market power and customer-specific insights, as a global supplier 
understands a global customer’s value chain better and hence is better prepared 
to serve. For example, FedEx, as a multilocation logistics service provider, better 
understands the needs of Laura Ashley, a multilocation global customer.
	
3.	Specifying the same hardware platform design for all global locations. GM uses 
Unigraphics as its common computer-aided design and manufacturing tool and 
design environment, making it easy for global engineers to collaborate 24 hours a 
day.
In 2003, IBM entered an eight-year contract worth $1.2 billion to take over the North 
American and European information technology operations of the French tire company 
Michelin.

468
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
However, there is a challenge facing the management of centrally coordinated mar-
keting programs: how should businesses reconcile the tension between the needs of 
headquarters and those of the regional units in the actual delivery of products and 
services?
13.6.4  Location-Based Optimization
This is another globalization-specific opportunity for companies to develop new busi-
nesses. Certainly, the intercountry differences in location-based cost structure and ser-
vices must be considered. By optimally selecting the location for each activity in the 
value chain (e.g., R&D, procurement, component manufacturing, product assembly, 
marketing, sales, distribution, and service), global companies can secure advantages in 
several areas.
	
1.	Performance enhancement: To build and sustain world-class excellence conferred 
by talents, speed of learning, and the quality of external and internal coordina-
tion, Fiat chose Brazil, not Italy, as the place to design and launch its “World Car,” 
the Palio. Microsoft established a corporate research laboratory in Cambridge, the 
United Kingdom, rather than in the United States.
	
2.	Cost reduction: Cost is, of course, a major concern to any company. Cost consider-
ations relate to factors such as local manpower and other resources, transporta-
tion and logistics, government incentives, and local tax structures. For example, 
Texas Instruments set up a software development unit in India, and Nike sources 
the manufacture of athletic shoes from Asian countries (i.e., China, Vietnam, 
Indonesia, and others).
	
3.	Risk reduction: Beside economic and political risks, there are also currency risks 
associated with devaluation. A company might need to spread the manufacturing 
operations across a few locations to minimize such risks.
For instance, Texas Instruments has been designing integrated circuits in India since 
1986, Sun Microsystems has hired Russian scientists for software and microprocessor 
research, and CrossComm Corp has its communications software written by Poles at the 
University of Gdansk.
To capture location-based opportunities, companies need to have the right management 
skills with the flexibility and the ability to foster coordination.
Ford relocated some manufacturing operations to Mexico to become more selective in 
hiring, to achieve a reduction in turnover, and to realize better productivity by training. 
Ford was able to achieve lower wage rates as well as higher productivity than it would 
have been able to do in the United States.
Location-specific conditions do evolve over time. Companies must be flexible in shift-
ing production should the location-based conditions no longer justify a continuation of 
production at a given site.
Coordination is of critical importance for companies to maximize the value gener-
ated by location-based opportunities. Texas Instruments conceived the product concept 
of its TCM9055 (high-speed telecommunications chip) in collaboration with engineers in 
Sweden. It developed the product in France with the use of software tools advanced in 
Houston, manufactured the product in Japan and Dallas, and tested the product in Taiwan.

469
Globalization
13.6.5  Knowledge Transfer across Locations
The global company may add value by actively transferring knowledge across locations. 
Knowledge about product or process innovations and about risk-management options are 
of particular value.
	
1.	Product and service innovations: Sharing new ideas among subsidiaries eliminates 
the “reinvention of the wheel” and speeds up product and process innovation.
	
	
Procter & Gamble used ideas conceived at different centers to develop 
Liquid Tide in 1980: they built on technologies developed in Cincinnati (result-
ing in a new ingredient to help suspend dirt in wash water), Japan (cleaning 
agents), and Brussels (ingredients that fight the mineral salts present in hard 
water). Procter & Gamble applied an efficient stocklist-based distribution sys-
tem from India to Indonesia and China and thus significantly minimized its 
cost of innovation.
	
	
In 1997, ABB, a $23 billion industrial product company headquartered in 
Zurich, Switzerland, shifted 1000-plus manufacturing jobs from Western 
Europe to emerging economies over a five-year period for the purposes of 
increasing efficiency, exploiting lower wages, and becoming more responsive 
to customers in growth markets. ABB set up a system that propels local ideas 
for new products and projects around the world in just three weeks. On the 
basis of keywords contained in the proposal, principal global players comment 
and sign off within an allocated period; this minimizes the time from idea to 
approval.
	
2.	Reduced risks of competitive preemption: By rapidly transferring new innovations to 
all global locations, the global company can lessen the danger of losing ideas to 
competitors for replication in other markets.
	
	
Generally speaking, there are two types of knowledge that are important to a 
company. Codified knowledge is typically embodied in chemical formulas and engi-
neering blueprints and is documented in operations manuals. Such knowledge is 
readily transferable. On the other hand, the tacit knowledge embedded in people’s 
minds, in behavior patterns, and in the skills of individuals or teams may be dif-
ficult to transfer. Examples of such tacit knowledge include the vision of a road 
map of new technologies or competency in managing global customer accounts. 
Managers in global companies need to find effective ways to transfer tacit knowl-
edge across subsidiaries.
	
	
It is a natural tendency for people to want to preserve specific competencies (e.g., 
manufacturing superiority) for survival and competitive reasons. Global compa-
nies need to systematically recognize unique know-how that is worth transferring 
and encourage knowledge sharing across locations. All subsidiaries must also be 
encouraged to learn from peer units instead of being handicapped by the “not-
invented-here” syndrome that some locations develop.
	
	
Global companies are blessed with location-based, value-addition opportu-
nities not readily available to companies that are domestically focused. Global 
leadership is needed to take advantage of these unique opportunities to create 
competitive advantages.

Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
13.7  Preparation for Globalization
Pursuing globalization successfully requires that global companies understand the suc-
cess factors gleaned from the experiences of others and that they are properly prepared. 
Preparation addresses the issues associated with management styles, globalization path-
ways, international perspectives, and personal readiness.
13.7.1  Success Factors for Globalization
In order to attain long-term profitability, global companies must (a) build customer rela-
tionships supported by superior, worldwide, and uniform service; (b) possess wide and 
deep knowledge about customers; (c) have strong and easily recognizable brands; (d) hire 
and retain talented people; and (e) organize global virtual teams to effectually implement 
global strategies.
Other key traits of companies that have successfully entered the global market include:
	
1.	Home market strength, which provides a solid revenue basis for global expansion
	
2.	A global business model that is easily replicated and scaled up to multiple markets
	
3.	A powerful vision that motivates employees and communicates core values
	
4.	Strong leaders who can articulate and carry the message globally
General Electric (GE) has been recognized as the master of globalization. It has moved a 
large number of plants to countries with lower labor cost. Specifically, GE locates and relo-
cates manufacturing plants to locations where the GE quality standards can be met at the 
lowest cost. GE pursues the business tenet of “continuous mobility.” As the emerging econ-
omies continuously improve their production skills and standards, GE relocates plants 
from one location to another to keep costs under control. General Electric Medical Systems, 
a division of GE, is known to have moved production plants from Paris to Budapest, from 
Milwaukee to Mexico City, and from Japan to Shanghai and Bangalore. According to Jack 
Welch, “Ideally, every plant you own would be on a barge.” In Figure 13.3, quality standards 
are plotted against countries. The x-axis is also indicative of the relative cost for achieving 
Quality standards

Globalization
a specific quality standard. It is generally expected that outputs of higher quality demand 
larger efforts and incur higher costs. Some developing countries are unable to produce 
quality beyond a certain level due to limitations in technology and skills. However, as 
the developing countries steadily upgrade their engineering and production skills, the 
quality–cost curve shifts to the left and moves from I to II. Most global companies will 
want to maintain high-quality standards for their products, while keeping costs competi-
tive. For example, if GE operates at Point A at a given time, then it is only logical that GE 
seeks to operate at Point B, whenever it is feasible to do so, in order to reduce its cost base. 
Thus, moving its production plants periodically to lower-cost countries, while maintain-
ing predetermined quality standards, is the basis of GE’s “continuous mobility” strategy.
13.7.2  Global Virtual Team
To achieve global success, global virtual teams must function well, as the pace of change 
has increasingly forced global organizations to be more outward looking, market ori-
ented, customer focused, and knowledge driven (Lipnack and Stamps 2000). Global virtual 
teams would typically be composed of members who are geographically dispersed, each 
with specific technical or business competencies, cultural and language backgrounds, 
working habits, and variable comfort levels with technology accessibility and utilization. 
Global teams may be ineffective because of cultural values, cultural and language differ-
ences, and other factors, such as the leader’s approach, lack of organizational support, or 
individual rewards overshadowing the team’s success (Zofi 2011; Fisher and Fisher 2011).
The cultural barriers just mentioned could come from (1) function—due to differences in 
reasoning styles, reactions, and getting motivated by people in various professions, such 
as engineers and marketing personnel; (2) organization—due to different value percep-
tions and behaviors; (3) nationality—due to different styles of human interaction because 
of national origin (e.g., in the United States the emphasis is on the individual, whereas in 
East Asia the emphasis is on the group and on reaching a consensus). Cultural issues need 
to be overcome. Metrics should also be set for goals and performance, and these should 
be focused on deliverables so that all team members fully understand their respective 
accountabilities. Managers also should convince all team members of the value of change 
made possible by the team activities.
Selecting the right team members is a crucial first step for the leader of any global vir-
tual team. Preference should be given to people who can act on their own when needed. 
One model of membership selection is to find regional alliance partners who have the 
necessary core competencies to execute a global, centralized strategy. The best kind of 
alliance partners are those who think ahead, demonstrate commitment with investment, 
understand the company’s requirements, share the common vision, and operate on behalf 
of the company.
When building global virtual teams, leaders need to pay attention to factors known to 
have a direct impact on team success. These factors include clearly articulating common 
goals, being aware of overlapping competencies and skills, acknowledging each other’s 
contributions and needs, formulating clear procedures and ground rules for working 
together, and establishing common rules and technologies for sharing information and 
data.
In order to operate global virtual teams effectively, proactive attention and preventive 
maintenance are needed. Members will need to be trained properly. A constant monitoring 
of the team progress is advisable. Roles and responsibilities must be clearly communicated 
and emphasized. To get team feedback, frequent communication is to be encouraged.

472
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
Communication is the key to keeping teams together and on track. Poor communication 
can bring forth stumbling blocks affecting team success. Some of these stumbling blocks 
are (1) commitment of team members may be misdirected from global activities to local 
priorities (the “out-of-sight, out-of-mind” syndrome); (2) trust between global team mem-
bers may not be strong enough; (3) time-zone differences, resulting in work-time overlaps, 
can discourage frequent communications; (4) language barriers, as English is not univer-
sally spoken, can make verbal and written communication in other countries uneasy and 
time-consuming for some; (5) culture differences produce different work habits and value 
perceptions, which can cause communication to be less free and open. Team leaders need 
to proactively schedule conference calls, in addition to e-mail, and have quarterly face-to-
face meetings if budgets and schedules allow.
Example 13.3
Global teams are often deployed to handle important tasks, such as devising spe-
cific implementation plans, proposing market entry strategies, and designing global 
products.
How do you make global teams efficacious?
Answer 13.3
The following generalized steps could help make a global team efficacious in achieving 
its intended objectives:
	
1.	 Appoint a team leader who is well recognized for leadership quality, inter-
personal skills, and managerial capabilities. Above all, the team leader must 
secure the strong support of the company’s top management. The president or 
another suitable top executive of the company should announce the appoint-
ment of the team leader to demonstrate company commitment.
	
2.	 Specify the team’s objectives, including standards to measure progress and the 
expected outcomes. The potential impact of the team efforts on the company’s 
profitability is clearly understood.
	
3.	 Define the qualifications of the team members on the basis of the expertise and 
level of experience needed to achieve the team objectives.
	
4.	 Solicit suggestions from various regional management centers and receive 
assurance that all required local support (time off, secretarial work, analysis, 
use of local facilities and engineering, marketing, and other resources) will be 
offered to team members.
	
5.	 Interview specific candidates and select the team members with the concur-
rence of local management. Team members with different skills and expertise 
may be needed as the team progresses through various stages, resulting in a 
constant flow of people moving into and out of the team. By organizing the 
team properly, the team leader ensures that a good working atmosphere pre-
vails at all times.
	
6.	 Compile a roster of corporate talents (who is specialized in doing what, for 
how long, with what accomplishments, etc.), with the support of local manage-
ment. This roster should be constantly maintained and could be used by all 
team members.
	
7.	 Make sure that all members receive proper teamwork training regarding 
(1) working in teams; (2) communications, including the use of associated 
equipment and tools; (3) problem solving; (4) available support functions and 
resources that can be tapped, and (5) group goals and expectations.

473
Globalization
	
8.	 Establish operational guidelines for fostering communications between team 
members (e.g., the use of intranet, videoconferencing).
	
9.	 Enhance personal interactions and cooperation, and build trust and confi-
dence among team members by inviting all to be physically present at the first 
team meeting.
	
10.	 Conduct team meetings to focus on achieving the team objectives, encourage 
all to communicate, and take into account the diverse cultural backgrounds of 
the respective members.
	
11.	 Assign members specific actions and steps to carry out (e.g., analysis, focus 
group inputs, activity-based costing).
	 12.	 Organize field trips, on-site visits, and other activities needed to collect data 
and to observe customer practices.
	
13.	 Engage outside consultants and other resources to provide benchmarks, sug-
gest alternatives, or overcome bottlenecks if needed.
	
14.	 Solve problems, resolve conflicts, and secure support functions needed for all 
team members.
	
15.	 Issue regular reports to all regional managers concerning the team’s progress 
and team member performance.
	
16.	 Strive to achieve a consensus on major issues, making sure that the outcome 
serves as a valid solution to the problem under consideration.
	
17.	 Submit the final outcome of the team to the company president or to other 
upper management, and gather the whole team to make a formal presentation 
of the results and to celebrate the successful completion of the team effort.
	
18.	 Document the experience and preserve the learning gained by the team effort, 
using inputs from all team members.
	
19.	 Gather the whole team to celebrate the team success.
13.7.3  Management Style (Most Useful for Global Opportunities)
Management style plays a critically important role in globalization, because globaliza-
tion makes communication and personal interaction necessary between people of dif-
ferent cultural, business, and personal backgrounds. For example, American managers 
may grow up in hierarchical and command-and-control systems. They typically perform 
thorough competitive analyses, using strong analytical tools and strategic audits. They 
focus on short-term profit objectives. They value being goal and achievement oriented. A 
great number of them are competitive, aggressive, ambitious, and intolerant of poor per-
formance. Their management style is also influenced by American education, politics, and 
internal and external reward systems. In contrast, the Japanese management style is char-
acterized by teamwork, market share objectives, commitment to quality, and a philosophy 
that says, “The nail that stands up gets pounded back down.”
It is thus important for managers of global companies to recognize and accept extreme 
differences in management styles practiced by people in different geographical regions. 
In fact, there is no style—American, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, or British—that 
must be rejected. To be successful in a global economy, a manager must accommodate the 
priorities of other cultures by stressing shared goals and a common outlook; remaining 
open-minded; adapting to the local culture, business practices, and value systems; and 
avoiding both cultural and intellectual arrogance (Schneider 2014; Brett 2014).
Companies involved in global businesses typically change their management styles over 
time. Initially, some global companies direct worldwide activities in accordance with the 
home-country standards, adopting central decision-making and control paradigms. As 
the global companies increase their foreign investments, home-country standards become 

474
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
a reference basis for managing worldwide operations, and a model of decentralized and 
autonomous global operations will develop. Gradually, the global companies build a global 
network and follow a transnational strategy that is integrated and interdependent.
Example 13.4
In pursuing global business, one commonly practiced strategy is to elicit the maxi-
mum possible collaboration with the right business partners in the host country. This 
is because their local knowledge is of tremendous value in facilitating the adaptation 
of foreign-made products or services to local market needs and for problem solving. 
Creating trust among the partners will naturally be a critical first step toward imple-
menting such a strategy.
What are some American management practices that can be counterproductive in 
winning the collaboration of foreign partners?
Answer 13.4
As background information, Table  13.2 contrasts the typical American management 
practices with those of the Japanese.
The following list describes some of the American practices that could be counterpro-
ductive in winning the collaboration of foreign business partners:
	
1.	 Exhibiting a highly competitive and arrogant personal demeanor and an 
ignorance of local culture, customs, and other differences in business prac-
tice, alienates the foreign partners. Here are two examples of well-known lan-
guage blunders: (1) an “escrow account” in English means a “gyp account” in 
French. (2) When an issue is ‘tabled” in America, it means that it is not to be 
brought up again; but in England, it means the exact opposite—that it will be 
brought up.
	
2.	 Being highly impatient and pushing aggressively for instant decisions fails to 
allow time for the foreign partners to create group consensus regarding the 
decisions at hand.
	
3.	 Emphasizing short-term profitability is a barrier to recognizing the business 
goals of the foreign partners who seek long-term, broad-based collaboration.
	
4.	 Being proud of risk-taking, and exhibiting decisiveness, a command-and-con-
trol rationale, and an excessive profit motive, fails to recognize that the values 
favored by the foreign partners might be different.
	
5.	 Adopting the “ugly American syndrome” that makes American managers 
insist that foreign partners do exactly what Americans do.

13.7.4  Strategic Pathways to Globalization
Companies pursue globalization along any or all of geography-based, product-based, 
customer-focused, and Internet-based pathways.
The geography-based pathway is a pathway in that companies pursue globalization in geo-
graphical areas that have common cultural and linguistic ties—Canada and England for 
U.S. companies, China for Taiwanese companies, Southeast Asian countries for Chinese 
companies, and African countries for French companies.
Following the product-based pathway, companies conceive and perfect specific products 
that do not require local customization. The companies then distribute the products glob-
ally wherever there is a demand for them.
According to the customer-focused pathway, global companies follow their major clients to 
foreign markets with a basket of products to serve the needs of the local customers of these 
clients more efficiently. Examples of such baskets of products include the combination of 
insurance, banking, and securities offered by Citicorp to Citigroup’s customers in China, 
Brazil, and other countries, and that of logistics and inventory management used by FedEx 
to FedEx’s customers in foreign countries.
The Internet-based pathway prescribes that companies devise a web presence and leapfrog 
over other competitors to reach end users in numerous global markets.
13.7.5  Globalization Mistakes
There are a number of mistakes commonly made by companies pursuing globalization. 
Among them is a lack of company commitment, when companies do not make a firm 
and sufficient corporate commitment to people, capital, and time; and low management 
attention, when senior managers get involved only when there is a crisis affecting earn-
ings. Oftentimes, companies assign low priority, viewing the international businesses as 
“incremental,” and do not engage foreign partners decisively (take a minority position 
when entering a joint venture with local partners). Should the business relationship turn 
adversarial, these companies can get blocked out of the target markets; thus, one should 
always attempt to keep 50–50 ownership to stay even.
“Thinking globally and acting locally” is regarded as a best practice for a global com-
pany to keep things in perspective while achieving practical results. Without an inter-
national perspective, global managers have a disadvantage in the global economy of the 
twenty-first century (Garten 2000).
A lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding has been known to be a major source 
of frustration for global managers. An American in Japan is described in the following 
example (Glover et al. 2002):
A young American manager was sent to Japan to work with the Fuji villagers on a forest 
project. During his first week in Fuji, he requested a local village chief to send “three 
men to do an eight-hour job clearing a field.” Each of the three men was to be paid an 
hourly wage. The next morning, 40 able-bodied men from the village showed up to 
do the work. The American manager asked the group to select three men, reasoning 
that, as he did not need all 40 of them, he would send the remaining 37 back to the vil-
lage. The chief responded that, if all 40 of them cleared the field, they would complete 
the work in one to two hours and then could go back to the village to do other work. 
Furthermore, the chief requested that the men not be paid individually. He would take 
the money and put it in to the village fund, a traditional communal means for distribut-
ing money equally. The American manager sent the chief and all of his 40 men away 

476
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
and paid higher wages to three Fujian Indian contract workers he got from a nearby city 
a week later. He complained that the Fujian villagers were not motivated to be produc-
tive and they did not seem to have any individual initiative.
This was clearly a case of a cultural clash between the occidental approach to productivity 
based on “scientific management” and the oriental approach of getting the work done in a 
speedy manner by a collective work group. Their culturally conditioned views of productiv-
ity were different. The American manager was trapped in the “one best way” he believed in, 
namely, “three people to do an eight-hour job.” He was unable to see possibilities of adapting 
to the concern of the chief, who needed to secure external funds to augment the overall vil-
lage operations, while delivering work at a faster rate by using all of his able-bodied men. The 
chief thought it ought to be the same to the American manager, as the total cost remained the 
same, whether the work was done by 3 or 40 people, as long as it would be at the same hourly 
wage rate. Thus, the chief was equally frustrated by this exchange and viewed any future 
interchanges with this inflexible American manager with suspicion from that point on.
Example 13.5
In the 1980s, a lot of multinational companies were eager to conquer foreign markets. In a 
hurry, they committed a large number of culturally insensitive blunders, contributing to 
major marketing and business failures at the time. Name a few such embarrassing examples.
Answer 13.5
The examples of culturally induced mistakes are plenty. Reviewing them from time to 
time is useful only for the purpose of preserving the learning opportunities they offer 
(Kaynak and Herbig 2013):
	
1.	 Chevrolet introduced the “Nova” in Puerto Rico and found out only later that 
No va means “doesn’t go” in Spanish.
	
2.	 Ford introduced a low-cost truck, the Fiera, into some emerging economy coun-
tries without success. It turns out that fiera means “ugly old woman” in Spanish.
	
3.	 Esso, the oil company, went to Japan. The phonetic pronunciation of Esso in 
Japanese means “stalled car,” which was not helpful in promoting the sales of 
gasoline there.
	
4.	 Cadbury Schweppes, an English food company, introduced its Rondo soft drinks 
into the United States. It failed badly, although it was a success in England. Later, 
they found out that people in the United States thought Rondo was a dog food.
	
5.	 Rolls Royce, before Mercedes acquired it, marketed a car called “Silver Mist.” 
When that name was translated into German, the “mist” became “excrement.” 
It forced Rolls Royce to change the name.
	
6.	 McDonald’s promoted its food products in Japan using white-faced clowns at 
one time. White face in Japan is a death symbol.
13.8  Globalization Drivers
There are a number of driving forces present in the global economy. Each company may 
be driven to globalization by a different set of drivers, such as market reach, cost, competi-
tion, and government.

477
Globalization
Market drivers include worldwide increases in per capita income that result in greater 
purchasing power and an increasing demand for products/services worldwide. Another 
market driver is the convergence in lifestyles, tastes, aspirations, and expectations of 
consumers. An additional market driver is increased global travel, which brings about 
a new class of global consumer. A further market driver is the creation of larger future 
markets in emerging countries. Over 90% of the world’s population is outside the United 
States. Companies need to pursue globalization to reach these extended markets (Brady 
2014; Johansson 2008). To be located close to customers is an important corporate market-
ing strategy. There are about 17 automobile assembly plants built by foreign carmakers 
on American soil. As recently as June 2003, Nissan motors announced an investment of 
$250 million to relocate its production facilities of the Pathfinder SUV (2005 model) from 
Japan to Smyrna, Tennessee. This relocation program would create 1500 new jobs in the 
United States. Also well known are the investment examples of General Motors, Ford, and 
Volkswagen in China, and Renault in Japan.
Cost drivers include lower manufacturing and production costs (due to lower labor costs), 
economies of scale, accelerating technological innovations, and upgraded transportation 
and logistics. Some companies seek a cost advantage as the primary motive to go global.
Competitive drivers include (1) global competitors with speed and flexibility; (2) the 
increased formation of global strategic alliances, resulting in a proliferation of partnership 
relations with suppliers, customers, and competitors (Culpan 2002); and (3) more coun-
tries becoming attractive marketing battlegrounds. Creating competitive advantages is the 
principal goal for some companies to pursue globalization.
Government drivers of globalization include (1) the emergence of trading blocks (EU, 
NAFTA), (2) a large scale of privatization (Brazil, China, etc.), and (3) a reduction of trade 
barriers (WTO). Companies go global to take advantage of the benefits made possible by 
these official or semiofficial government bodies.
Ernst & Young conducted a survey of more than 300 CEOs in 1993. The top 10 drivers in 
the global race were recognized as follows: (1) increased speed of delivery to customers, (2) 
enriched ties with strategic partners abroad, (3) enhanced support of domestic customers’ 
international operations, (4) meeting of cultural needs of foreign customers, (5) access to 
new technologies, (6) avoidance of overseas protectionism, (7) reach for lower taxes and 
government benefits, (8) access to foreign technical and management talent, (9) utilization 
of low-cost labor, and (10) avoidance of domestic regulatory constraints.
Indeed, numerous forces of significant magnitude are driving companies toward 
globalization.
13.9  Implementation Issues Related to Globalization
When pursuing globalization, the management of global companies can benefit from 
the international business experience gained by other companies. This section addresses 
emerging issues and the ways some global companies conduct global business.
Global companies face two emerging issues. The first is fairness. Traditionally, in the 
market economy, major multinational profit-seeking companies have pursued globaliza-
tion. Home-country governments of these companies tend to set the macroeconomic pol-
icy and rules of the game, and they do not always have the interests of emerging economy 
countries in mind. Calls have been issued by some emerging economy countries to seek 

478
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
global governance, with the participation of all emerging economy countries in order to 
ensure fairness to all involved.
The second issue is conflicts of interest. In industrialized countries, workers in certain 
“old-economy” sectors (e.g., mining, textiles, agricultural, and other manufacturing enter-
prises) face unemployment when jobs are transferred to emerging economy countries that 
offer lower labor rates. Workers in the “knowledge economy” sectors—electronics, com-
puters, and high-tech export businesses—are gaining. Surveys indicate that people with 
low incomes are generally opposed to globalization, while those with high incomes favor 
it.
Protests staged against the WTO by the joint forces of labor (stumping for work rules to 
protect U.S. jobs), environmental (promoting the reduction of pollution), and human rights 
groups (protesting for the elimination of political and religious suppression) at various 
international places in recent years have indicated clearly that not everyone is in favor of 
globalization.
Even inside emerging economy countries (e.g., China), globalization is not welcome by 
all. Increased privatization, foreign investment, market opening (telecommunications, 
banking, financial services, and others), and increased foreign trade can facilitate the 
destruction of countless existing state enterprises and thus cause massive unemployment 
in the state sector. Hence, globalization brings gains to some sectors and losses to others, 
as discussed previously. Global companies need to devise long-range programs to address 
these issues in order to sustain the benefits they realize from globalization.
Companies engaged in international business may be classified into one of the four 
groups listed next, according to their corporate behavior in conducting global business.
13.9.1  Defender Companies
These companies are internally focused. They have no global orientation and no interna-
tional vision in their business strategies. They are focused on domestic markets and make 
no effort to understand other markets and cultures. They have limited skills and knowl-
edge to pursue foreign markets. They look to governments to provide protection against 
foreign intrusion (e.g., through trade barriers, quotas, duties, laws, and special agree-
ments). Their view is, “What is different is dangerous.” Examples include (1) the U.S. steel 
industry, which sought quotas from 1960 to 1980 to restrict Japanese steel imports to the 
United States; (2) the U.S. footwear industry, which attempted in vain in 1980 to get import 
protection; and (3) the U.S. textile and machine tools industries, which got government 
relief against imports in 1975. Today, many of these industries are under the protection of 
bankruptcy laws or import tariffs. Some of them have barely survived under governmen-
tal subsidization programs.
13.9.2  Explorer Companies
These companies are largely inwardly oriented, with dominance in the domestic markets. 
They are aware that opportunities may exist abroad. They move into foreign markets very 
cautiously after closely studying the opportunities available. They have some knowledge 
about the markets abroad and possess a restricted set of skills to pursue them. Overall, 
they have small international business revenues. The home-based headquarters controls 
their businesses. They may pursue some export and franchising activities, but with rather 
limited investment commitment. Companies in this category include Seiko and Lotus 
(both of which have been acquired by Microsoft).

479
Globalization
13.9.3  Controller Companies
These companies are more externally oriented than the explorers. They want to control the 
market abroad. They have sufficient knowledge and skills to pursue foreign markets, but 
have a limited global mind-set. They generate a significant amount of overseas sales rev-
enues with major investment commitment. They impose their home culture and practices 
on overseas operations, although they do tailor some strategic decisions to suit the local 
cultures or to optimize the interests of their home office and the local markets. They main-
tain financial and strategic control at the home office, while allowing some independence 
in overseas activities. Examples of companies in this category include Coke, McDonald’s, 
and Pizza Hut.
13.9.4  Integrator Companies
These companies have a global perspective based on heightened awareness (knowledge) and 
strengthen abilities (skills). They form a worldwide web of relationships, partnerships, and 
alliances with suppliers, developers, designers, distributors, competitors, and customers. They 
reconfigure these relationships over time as new threats and opportunities arise. They coor-
dinate, rather than control, these networks of business partners. They focus on overall organi-
zational effectiveness in delivering products/services of value to customers. They understand, 
bridge, and resolve differences between people, companies, values, and cultures. Their core 
strategy is to win in the marketplace by leveraging, sharing, and nurturing complementary 
capabilities. In this group of companies, General Electric, Toyota, and Hewlett-Packard are 
known to have formed networks with primary, secondary, and tertiary suppliers and subcon-
tractors. To be globally successful, companies need to walk, talk, and act like integrators.
13.10  Quality of Global Leadership
Global management is demanding. According to Lamberton (2002), global managers must 
possess certain characteristics and savvy to be successful in a global environment.
Global business is highly complex and uncertain, due to variations in cultural, linguis-
tic, political, social, and economic conditions. Global managers must constantly learn in 
order to succeed. Constant learning requires an inquisitive mind. Successful global lead-
ers are adventuresome, curious, and open-minded. Inquisitiveness strengthens personal 
growth, characterized by emotional connection to people and uncompromising integrity; 
and duality, the capacity to handle uncertainty and the ability to balance tensions. Personal 
integrity inspires staff trust and commitment, which in turn affect the implementation 
results of any global strategy.
To be effective in global business, managers need to have a global mind-set, which will 
enable them to do the following (Jeannet 2000):
	
1.	Extend concepts and modes from one-to-one relationships to holding multiple 
realities and relationships in one’s mind simultaneously, and then act skillfully on 
this more complex reality (global think).
	
2.	Change management orientation from taking individual initiatives to adopting 
team and group initiatives.

480
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
	
3.	Focus simultaneously on hard issues (low-cost producers, bottom lines, budgets, 
manufacturing, marketing, distribution, head count, and finances) and soft issues 
(value, culture, vision, leadership style, innovative behavior, and risk taking).
	
4.	Balance the pressures of global integration (product standardization) and local 
responsiveness (adjusting to the needs of local markets). Recognize the interde-
pendence of the global economy and view the world from a broad perspective. 
Seek trends that affect company business, balance contradictory forces, rethink 
boundaries, and build and maintain organizational networks at the global level.
	
5.	Serve as a catalyst within the company, being sensitive to, and capable of, man-
aging cultural diversity. Become more tolerant of other people and cultures. 
Consider culture diversity an asset. Connect emotionally with people and the 
worldwide organization. It is worth noting that European managers are said to be 
more accustomed to exposure to cultural diversity than American managers.
	
6.	Recognize complex patterns in the global environment and thrive on ambigu-
ity. Become proficient at managing uncertainty and dealing with conditions that 
change constantly and are inherently complex.
	
7.	Preserve a unique time and space perspective. Take a long-term view, extending 
personal space in geography and relationships.
	
8.	Exhibit business and organizational savvy. Recognize opportunities, grow in 
knowledge of available resources, and be capable of mobilizing them to take 
advantage of opportunities.
Global managers must possess specific knowledge and capabilities to succeed. They should 
have a mastery over technology (information systems, telecommunications, and operations) 
and use it effectually. They need to be aware of the social and political features of different 
countries. They should be familiar with the specific culture and cross-cultural issues that 
affect management. Of great importance is their understanding of the global competitive 
practices in manufacturing and communications, such as total quality management, just-in-
time delivery, factory automation, employee involvement, and outsourcing. Also helpful is 
some general knowledge about business and industry and the skills required to put knowl-
edge into action, to become acculturated, to lead, and to motivate a diversified workforce.
Of critical importance to global companies is the business savvy of their global leaders 
to size up business opportunities and to have a vision of doing business worldwide.
	
1.	Recognize global market opportunities: The ability to recognize new opportunities 
is a key leadership quality of global managers. They need to be able to do the 
following:
	
a.	 Assess the cost and quality differences in production outputs and inputs, and 
exploit cost differentials for land, energy, labor, raw materials, and people 
talents.
	
b.	 Identify market needs for goods and services from a deep and broad knowl-
edge base, having mastered finance, accounting, marketing, human resources, 
operations, international relations, economics, industry conditions, and strat-
egy disciplines.
	
c.	 Size up opportunities for efficiency gains by (1) eliminating redundancies to 
wring out costs, (2) using economies of scale in procurement, (3) pursuing 
standardized outputs, and (4) selling to multiple markets.

481
Globalization
	
d.	 Create competitive advantages by forming supply chain networks involving 
strategically selected, local and global partners with complementary resources 
and expertise.
	
2.	Envision doing business worldwide to ultimately make money: The manager should also 
have a good overall perspective of what the company’s business has to offer—
what the core is, why the core is what it is, and what drives the core. This under-
standing is combined with the fundamental good business goal of making money 
for the company.
Global managers are required to demonstrate organizational capabilities. These capa-
bilities are built on specific qualities:
	
1.	Know your company: Global managers must have an intimate knowledge of their 
own companies with respect to subsidiaries’ product lines, cost structures, and 
overall competitiveness. They should know the location and quality of the techno-
logical resources available, including physical assets and managerial and employee 
talents. Global managers must be known to the company’s key decision-makers by 
having served on key committees, participated in task forces, and attended critical 
meetings.
	
2.	Mobilize resources: Global managers need to be able to mobilize resources to take 
advantage of global opportunities. Establishing trust with top management and 
key decision-makers will ensure their favorable response to these mobilization 
efforts.
	
3.	Develop insight: Global managers must be able to identify critical knowledge and 
capabilities beyond merely understanding policies and programs.
	
4.	Keep current: Global managers must keep themselves constantly informed of what 
is presently going on at the headquarters.
Global businesses require managers to be patient with, tolerant of, and open-minded 
toward divergent cultures, customs, and business practices. They should be dedicated to 
the mission at hand and assume a flexible negotiation style to win. They should possess 
stamina to endure personal hardships, the personality to effectively handle uncertain-
ties and ambiguity, and the conviction that what is different is not necessarily dangerous 
(Dalton et al. 2002; Marquardt and Berger 2000; McCall and Hollenbeck 2001).
The manager needs to recognize that, for global businesses to succeed, the new model of 
responsiveness, partnership, teamwork, and decentralization must replace the early man-
agement model of efficiency, hierarchy, control, and centralization.
Not everyone has the desire to become a global leader. Those who want to be global 
leaders need to become proactive in seeking opportunities for leadership development. 
Personal preparation can assist in refining these desirable traits.
13.11  Production Engineering in a Global Economy
Global companies needs to scale down the capital investment for production, shorten the 
time to market, change product features flexibly to meet the requirements of the changing 

482
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
local markets, ensure product quality, and offer after-sales support and services to main-
tain long-term profitability. As a result, production engineering will experience significant 
changes in the global economy.
To compete effectively on a global basis, companies need to aggressively engage partner-
ships, form supply alliances, and create networks with domestic and international sup-
pliers of raw material, subassemblies, semifinished goods, and others to make finished 
products flexibly and speedily (Culpan 2002). The production engineering issues involved 
in global environments will be significantly different from those in traditional old econ-
omy companies.
In old economy companies, where vertical production has been the norm, production 
engineering deals with the manufacturability of products/services and the application of 
resources (technologies, labor, materials, plan layout, utilities, etc.) to optimize production.
In the knowledge economy, in which global companies pursue production via net-
worked partners, each having its own production capabilities and engineering, produc-
tion engineering will need to deal with issues in different ways. Some of these issues and 
methods are as follows:
	
1.	Product design and specification: Communicate and enforce interface specifica-
tions of all parts produced by the partners. Standardize interfaces to promote 
the exchangeability of parts in order to offer different product features. Effect 
infrastructure and hardware and software systems to facilitate supply chain 
management. Integrate middleware, electronic data interchange (EDI), systems 
technologies, regulations, production practices, and others to improve efficiency.
	
2.	Manufacturing: Selectively apply web-based enablers in manufacturing and opera-
tions to gain advantages. Produce core parts, and assemble the finished products 
with vendor-supplied parts. Refine an assembly procedure to safeguard prod-
uct integrity. Conduct statistical process control (SPC) to ensure system qual-
ity of the assembled, finished products. Pursue the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) and other quality process certifications of networked 
partners.
	
	
With GE’s example of “continuous mobility” as a guide, companies should 
explore ways to have quality products made at locations where the loss is low-
est. To implement such a manufacturing strategy, production engineering at head-
quarters must be prepared to transfer manufacturing and technologies processes 
to new recipient groups whenever needed.
	
3.	Management: Share information and foster collaboration between the networked 
global partners. Preserve knowledge and apply global experience and learning. 
Strengthen a customer relationship management system by tapping into the 
expertise, innovation, and knowledge base of the networked partnership. Assist 
in setting up an enterprise resource planning system to optimize the utilization 
of corporate assets. Make the production process transparent to, and traceable by, 
customers.
	
4.	Logistics: Ensure just-in-time (JIT) delivery and optimize transportation logistics.
	
5.	Inventory control: Balance loads between global sites to adjust to changing supply 
and demand and marketplace conditions.
	
6.	Risk management: Respond to labor, politics, currency, and unexpected changes 
and conflicts.

483
Globalization
Boeing is well known to have implemented an ambitious supply chain strategy in 
producing its new 787 Dreamliner airplanes by
	
1.	Engaging suppliers from 10 different countries, including Australia, Canada, 
China, England, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, and the United States.
	
2.	Making use of vendors’ unique expertise in designing and producing specific 
components (e.g., electronics and composite materials aerial processing).
	
3.	Safeguarding of innovative design features.
	
4.	Focusing on producing subassemblies to facilitate the speedy final airplane 
assembly, with the target of reducing the plane assembly time for seven days (for 
737 planes) to three days (for 787 planes).
	
5.	Controlling the life-cycle costs and delivery speed in order for Boeing to better 
align with the changing business cycles of the air travel industry.
To succeed in implementing such a complex supply system, Boeing spent a considerable 
amount of extra effort in preplanning, coordinating, problem solving, quality controlling, 
and transportation logistics. In the end, Boeing was successful in delivering its new air-
plane as originally designed, with the exception of having suffered a total delay in sched-
ule of about three years.
13.12  Job Migration Induced by Globalization
Globalization has a profound impact on jobs, and many jobs are migrating to and from the 
United States as the push for globalization intensifies. For example, when foreign prod-
ucts (such as textiles, shoes, toys, and cheap electronics) overwhelmed U.S. markets in the 
1980s, some American workers suffered. When Japanese automakers set up shop in the 
southern part of the United States in the 1990s to compete against Detroit carmakers, their 
investments created new jobs for American workers. When Nokia expanded its cell phone 
business into the United States, American workers benefited.
Besides reducing the cost of doing business, many companies outsource work to con-
serve investment capital; shorten time to market; build a variable cost structure; secure 
needed skills, technologies, and expertise; and realize a round-the-clock operation.
Over the years, a large number of American-based multinational companies have 
implemented strategies that cause engineering and other jobs to migrate to emerging 
economy countries. Even though engineering and blue-collar jobs related to manufactur-
ing have been disappearing at an alarming rate, American manufacturing productivity 
has risen constantly over the last decade due to automation and a shift to higher-value 
work.
For the year 2002, U.S. productivity reached an annual growth rate of 9.2%, the highest 
worldwide. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2004) has determined that outsourcing, to 
both overseas and domestic partners, has contributed about 1.5% toward this 9.2% growth. 
Innumerable U.S. firms are involved in outsourcing engineering and science-related work 
to developing countries. Engardio (2003) offers a comprehensive list of American com-
panies engaged in outsourcing engineering and science jobs, including General Electric, 
Flour, Intel, Oracle, Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, Boeing, and others.

484
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
Other big technology companies, including IBM and Microsoft, are bringing in foreign 
workers to America on L-1 visas, which allow the companies to pay workers their home-
country wage rates for as long as seven years. The federal government places no limits on 
the number of L-1 visas issued to a company (Bridger 2003). Ford announced its plan to 
purchase auto parts worth $1 billion from China in 2004. With the stroke of a pen, Ford 
shifted thousands of jobs to China.
A large number of companies are also engaged in outsourcing various nonengineering 
jobs overseas (e.g., customer service, microbiology research, tax return preparation, back-
office support, IT applications, and CT scan interpretation work). In fact, McCarthy (2002) 
predicted that 3.3 million U.S. white-collar jobs valued at $136 billion in wages will have 
migrated abroad by the year 2015.
The white-collar job migration is a serious problem that must not be overlooked. It is a 
moving train viewed by many to be unstoppable.
13.12.1  Global Pie Concept
Is white-collar job migration all that bad? It is certain that some white-collar workers will 
be adversely affected. Some analysts believe, however, that the overall impact of offshoring 
may actually be positive for both the United States and the world at large. Agrawal and 
Farrell (2003) estimated that the benefit of about $1.45 may be derived from $1 spent by 
America in offshoring, suggesting that the global pie will be made bigger, not smaller, by 
offshore investments. The key point is, of course, that the offshoring of investments is not 
predicted as a zero-sum game, wherein the gain of one party is at the expense of the other. 
Rather, both parties are expected to benefit in the process.
13.12.2  How to Survive White-Collar Migration
Agrawal and Farrell (2003) assume in their studies that the value of U.S. labor reemployed 
is $0.45–$0.47 for each U.S. dollar invested in offshoring. This means that the investment 
funds freed by going offshore can be effectually deployed within the United States (e.g., 
hiring employees to do higher-value work and initiating leading-edge R&D).
Engineers whose jobs may be outsourced unexpectedly need to ask the question “What 
will it take for them to become part of these ‘reemployed resources’ that companies will 
want to use the freed investment to engage?” There are a number of steps that engineers 
may take to augment their relative competitiveness in this situation.
	
1.	Get advanced training: Currently, white-collar jobs migrate primarily from the United 
States to four lower-wage countries: China, India, the Philippines, and Mexico. 
These recipient countries bring forth an overwhelmingly large number of engineer-
ing and science graduates at the BS level every year. In other words, the number 
of U.S. graduates at the BS level is predicted to become a smaller percentage of the 
five-country total—only 15%. Each U.S. engineer or scientist graduating with a BS 
degree will have six other engineers or scientists as competitors in the job market. 
Similarly, MS and PhD graduates in the United States will make up about one-third 
of the five-country total. Each U.S. engineer or scientist with an MS or a PhD degree 
will have only two others from the four low-wage countries to compete against.
	
	
These numbers suggest that it would be useful for American engineers to 
get advanced degrees as one of several steps to decrease the adverse effects of 

485
Globalization
white-collar migration. Having an advanced degree is likely to be useful, but it is 
still not a guarantee that an engineer will survive the threat imposed by white-
collar job migration.
	
2.	Practice the “steady-ascent” strategy: Engineers should constantly seek to upgrade 
the ways that they perform their jobs, so that their employers can provide bet-
ter, faster, and cheaper products and services to their customers. Innovations are 
desirable at the interface between engineering, design, and manufacturing to 
minimize labor, cut waste, enhance quality, and speed up time to market. The 
added value concept is quite ordinary in itself. However, it becomes critical in 
times of white-collar job migration (see Figure 13.4).
	
	
Quality and value versus location is plotted in Figure  13.4. The horizontal 
axis denotes production sites, from low cost on the left to high cost on the right. 
Production cost at A is higher than at B, which in turn is higher than at C. The 
straight lines I, II, and III symbolize the linear relationship assumed to exist 
between the quality–value combination and cost. It is reasonable to assume that 
the higher the product or service quality is, the higher its production cost will 
be. In the course of time, such a straight line shift from I to II to III, reflecting the 
constant strides made by developing countries in their capabilities of manufactur-
ing products and supplying services at high quality, while keeping their wages at 
relatively low levels.
	
	
Let us assume that Point 1 is the current point of operation, with a quality–cost 
relationship depicted by the straight line I and its location selected at A (e.g., the 
United States). As the developing countries upgrade their engineering and pro-
duction skills and become increasingly capable of supplying work of acceptable 
quality, the quality–cost curve available to U.S. firms moves from I to II. Under 
these circumstances, U.S. firms will logically shift production and other work 
from Point 1 to 4 and relocate the associated operations from A to B (e.g., to India 
or China), while keeping the quality at an acceptable level. Should another coun-
try offer even lower wages in the future, the U.S. firms will not hesitate to move 
their facilities again from B to C to operate at Point 5. This is consistent with the

concept of “continuous mobility” practiced by General Electric and other firms. 
The relocation of operations from A to B and from B to C will ensure that the firms 
remain cost competitive over a long period, without sacrificing the quality of their 
products or services.
	
	
For individual engineers to ensure that they do not get displaced by white-collar 
migration, Figure 13.4 offers an obvious strategy. It is a given fact that the develop-
ing countries will constantly upgrade their engineering and production skills, as 
illustrated by the shifting of the straight line from I to II to III. Therefore, in order 
for engineers to survive white-collar job migration, they need to periodically add 
enough value to ascend from Point 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3 while employed in the 
home country (A in this example). In fact, should the individual reach Point 3 after 
the quality–cost line II is reached, his or her job may be outsourced. Specifically, 
if the value contributed by the engineer reaches Point 6 rather than Point 3, then 
employers will seek to outsource the work to operate at Point 7, the lowest-cost 
operating point for the same value/quality.
	
	
The key message here is that engineers must pay attention to the rapid progress 
made by developing countries and use these external benchmarks as the correct 
yardsticks to measure their own performance so that the incremental value they 
add is always on par with or higher than that which can be readily gained by their 
employers through offshoring. Furthermore, this value must be added in time for 
them to remain competitive from the value–cost standpoint. Besides the magni-
tude of the value contributed, timing is critical. Engineers need to avoid being 
caught off guard in this dynamic environment. It is like rowing a boat upstream; 
resting means falling back.
	
	
Thus, the traditional mode of continuing education (e.g., taking a course or two 
from time to time) will probably not be sufficient to ensure job security. What is 
needed is fast learning guided by constant external benchmarking and adding 
value before equivalent value can be attained at lower cost (via going offshoring).
	
	
As global employers pursue continuous mobility, global engineers need to 
practice the steady-ascent strategy in a timely manner.
	
3.	Be selective: Engineers are advised to be selective in choosing activities and functions 
that add recognizable value to their employers. Adhering to the following guide-
lines will make it more likely that engineers will be marketable at any given time:
	
a.	 Stay close to the employer’s core competencies, which are usually preserved 
and nurtured in-house.
	
b.	 Learn to absorb complex information quickly and solve technical, business, 
and people problems creatively. Focus own work on maximizing its value 
added.
	
c.	 Become versed in interacting with workforce members of diversified back-
grounds. Baby boomers who are managing the current operations of many 
companies are expected to retire in the next two decades. The gap left behind 
by them will need to be filled by capable people who can direct teams of diver-
sified cultural and business backgrounds (Kaihla 2003).
	
d.	 Acquire the capabilities of designing and advancing the next generation of 
products and technologies and pursuing work that has high-innovative con-
tent. Apply new technologies to wring out product costs. Dell uses robots to 

487
Globalization
assemble computers quickly and reliably in the United States, negating some 
of the cost advantages of moving plants offshore.
	
e.	 Cultivate visions with originality and a global orientation, and demonstrate 
leadership in strategic planning.
	
f.	 Maintain a broad business network that can be tapped into to add value for 
challenging situations.
	
g.	 Avoid attaching yourself for too long to functions or activities that are read-
ily outsourced. Study the industry. Stay away from labor-intensive “grunt” 
work—tasks that can be performed by following well-specified procedures 
and are more or less mechanical or operational in nature. Such work is easily 
learned and performed by other engineering graduates in low-wage countries. 
Examples include low-level engineering design, assembly operation, customer 
service, procurement, project management, troubleshooting equipment, engi-
neering analysis using canned software programs, and laboratory tests.
13.13  Conclusion
Globalization continues to be an inevitable business trend in the twenty-first-century 
economy. Three of the top-five economies in the world are likely to shift to Asia by 2020.
Globalization creates ample value-added opportunities to those engineering managers 
who are properly prepared and equipped with the required global mind-set, knowledge, 
and savvy. Having a global orientation is no longer opulence, but a necessity for economic 
survival in any industry.
Adjustments are needed for American managers to become effective in the global arena. 
They need to become more tolerant of, and adaptive to, that which is foreign and different. 
Past experience can serve as a useful basis for guiding future progress.
Engineering managers are encouraged to continuously follow the globalization process, 
to become sensitized to all issues involved in globalization, to make useful contributions 
to high-value work, and to prepare to lead in the global economy.
QUESTIONS
	
1.	For products intended for global markets, customers’ wants and needs are dif-
ferent from one market to another. How can a centralized global team build up a 
product to serve as a “platform” for the global market?
	
2.	Japanese companies face challenges similar to those faced by U.S. companies in 
that low-cost manufacturing capabilities are readily available in such countries as 
China, India, the Philippines, and Mexico. How can the Japanese companies plan 
to deal with these challenges?
	
3.	It can be argued that democracy and capitalism are concepts that are funda-
mentally incompatible with each other. Democracy is built on the principle of 
equality—one person, one vote—regardless of the individual’s intelligence, 
wealth, work ethic, or any other features that may distinguish one individual 
from another. Capitalism, on the other hand, fosters inequality. It uses incentive 
structures to encourage hard work and wise investment to realize differences in 

488
Engineering Management: Meeting Global Challenges
economic returns. Because future income from investments (in human or physical 
assets) depends on current income, wealth tends to generate wealth, and poverty 
tends to constrain the individual’s economic growth. The cycle is self-reinforcing: 
success breeds success, and failure compounds failure. “The economically fit are 
expected to drive the economically unfit out of existence. Thus, there are no equal-
izing feedback mechanisms in capitalism” (Thurow 1997).
	
	
What are some of the remedies capitalistic countries have introduced to miti-
gate such inequality? Would globalization compound this condition in a capitalis-
tic and democratic country? Why, or why not?
	
4.	Globalization, which causes the countries involved to become more intercon-
nected, clearly has tremendous social and political implications. It also has a cul-
tural dimension to it, due to worldwide communications that facilitate the global 
connections. Cultural globalization may lead to a more civic global society with a 
greater consensus on civic values. It may also diminish the rich diversity of human 
civilization, as the Asian, Islamic, South American, and other non-Western values 
become increasingly generic. For many, the preservation of distinct cultural tradi-
tions is a very serious matter.
	
	
Is globalization a form of Western imperialism that may homogenize non-West-
ern values? Why or why not? Can homogenization be avoided or mitigated?
	
5.	During the new century, increased flows of products, services, technologies, capi-
tal, and workers across national borders will affect the economical, social, and 
political life of everyone involved. The UN is expected to play a critical role in this 
increasingly dynamic environment.
	
	
In your opinion, what should be the major missions of the UN in addressing 
these issues?

Engineering Management in the New Millennium
14.1  Introduction
Tomorrow’s industry, due to advancements in technology and the increased sophistica-
tion of customers, will be quite different from that of the recent past (Groen et al. 2015). 
Advancements in communications technologies have made various business transactions 
cheaper, faster, and better at meeting customer demand. Web-based tools are available 
to foster information sharing and knowledge management, leading to improved supply-
chain management, mass customization, benchmarking, customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM), and e-transformation, on top of adding value to the traditional engineering 
functions (e.g., product design, project management, plant operations, and manufacturing) 
(Drucker 2013).
Rapid changes in production, service, and distribution technologies will continue 
to result in extensive organizational reform. Globalization will cause engineering 
organizations to be managed differently than in the past. It is important for today’s sci-
ence, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals and leaders to proactively 
anticipate the future, recognize the significant changes lying ahead, and prepare to seize 
the new opportunities associated with these major changes.
In this chapter, we first contrast past engineering management in industry with that 
of the new millennium (Schmidt 1999). Specifically, we address the issues related to 
new trends emerging in our economy. The differences between companies in the old 
and new economies are reviewed. The characteristics of knowledge economy compa-
nies and their likely strategies are examined next. We then discuss the new types of 
workforce and the new responsibilities of managers in progressive companies. Finally, 
we outline the significant contributions expected of STEM professionals and leaders in 
these companies.
Business development is critical to the success of twenty-first-century companies 
(DePalma 2002; Johansson 2008). The extension of market reach is due primarily to glo-
balization (see Chapter 13). Capable enterprises are constantly looking for new custom-
ers in emerging markets to expand sales, seek resources and location-based synergies to 
enhance their competitive advantages, and exploit economies of global scope to mitigate 
business risks. Reaching out to global markets will be a major driving force affecting innu-
merable engineering enterprises in the new millennium.
In this chapter, we also explore various management issues applicable to the market-
place and emphasize new challenges that STEM professionals and leaders are expected to 
face in the new millennium.

Engineering Management
14.2  Future Trends
Before we talk about specific changes expected in industry, a brief review of some of the 
new trends (not related to globalization) in our economy is in order. Several major trends 
already noticeable in the knowledge economy have been brought about by the growth of 
web-based enablers and by the increasing demands of customers for better, faster, and 
cheaper products and services. The common underlying threads among these trends 
appear to be effectiveness (customer and environment), efficiency (internal structure and 
operation activities), and integration (one-stop consolidation). Discussed in this section are 
specific trends related to customer focus, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and applica-
tion integration, supply strategy, knowledge management, changes in organizational set-
tings, and population diversity.
14.2.1  Customer Focus
In the knowledge economy, customer service will be driven by several distinct character-
istics (Anderson et al. 2000; Schmitt 2003):
	
1.	Speed of customer service: It is preferable to reduce the processing time between 
searching, selecting, entering, and fulfilling orders. There will be no more exces-
sive handoffs. Companies are moving toward a seamless integration of steps to 
accept orders, trigger receivables, send orders to production, route requisitions to 
warehouses, activate shipments by logistics partners (e.g., UPS, FedEx), replenish 
inventory, update accounting, replenish stock with suppliers, and track delivery 
status to ensure on-time delivery (Buss 1999).
	
2.	Customer self-service: Companies involved in real estate, insurance, travel, car 
buying, auction, parts sourcing, and retailing are increasingly moving toward 
empowering customers to serve themselves by creating 24/7 (i.e., 24 hours a day, 
7 days a week) systems and cutting out intermediaries. The following three com-
panies are successful examples of the trend to encourage and empower customer 
involvement in self-service:
a.	 Gateway: Customers define their own needs, configure systems, place orders, 
pay for new computers, and get limited support.
b.	 E-Trade: Customers trade securities without broker involvement, using a 24/7 
website.
c.	 Microsoft Expedia: Customers make reservations online to book flights and 
receive confirmations at a lower cost, while enjoying faster service.
	
3.	Integrated solutions for customers: Customers have moved away from best-of-breed 
individual solutions toward integrated systems. A specific example is Microsoft 
Office Suites with integrated functionality.
	
	
Customers are motivated by the desire to spend less time shopping, shop at 
one-stop stores, make fewer shopping trips, and decide among fewer choices. The 
following are examples of organizations responding to these desires:
a.	 Gap: A one-stop clothing and accessory provider that encourages convenience-
based “package” purchases. Mannequins are outfitted with shirts, blue jeans, 

493
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
belts, baseball caps, sunglasses, socks, shoes, gloves, and a knapsack, market-
ing a hip image.
b.	 Citicorp: In 2002, this company started to offer the combined online services 
of banking, credit cards, automobile insurance, brokerage and investing, mort-
gage and loans, and e-mail cash for money abroad.
c.	 Automatic teller machines (ATMs): These machines are being expanded by 
countless financial institutions to include web-based services such as e-mails, 
online purchases, and transactions.
	
4.	Customized service and sales: Statistics indicate that some companies lose 50% of 
their customers every five years. Generally, it costs 5–10 times more to obtain a 
new customer than to retain one. One approach taken by some companies is to 
train customer-facing agents to cross-sell and upsell.
	
	
For example, Home Depot emphasizes service to do-it-yourself customers and 
provides customers with easy access to information. The company starts offering 
service before sales and continues its customer service after sales.
	
5.	Consistent and reliable service: Customers prefer to have single points of contact, 
which requires the company’s service calls to be coordinated with supply chain 
business partners (i.e., those members of the extended enterprise family under 
outsourcing, alliance, or partnership agreements).
	
6.	Flexible fulfillment and convenient service: Gevalia Kaffe imports coffee and makes 
home deliveries. It performs 200,000 transactions per week and has built an e-busi-
ness infrastructure to take orders, find the lowest-cost routing distance between the 
customer and the nearest warehouse, check inventories, issue shipping orders, and 
activate shipping by the networked partners who deliver coffee to home addresses.
	
7.	Transparent sales process: Customers typically want to know the order status, prod-
uct information, pricing, and availability (Larsson and Lundberg 1998). UPS is 
known to have set up a 24/7 sophisticated information system that performs the 
following functions:
a.	 Tracks air and ground parcels at any time and from anywhere.
b.	 Achieves flawless delivery, which is now becoming the norm rather than the 
exception.
	
	
Another example is Solectron, which makes circuit boards and electrical 
assemblies for such customers as IBM, HP, and Intel and has plants in California, 
Washington, Malaysia, France, and Scotland. The company has refined a shop-
floor tracking and recording system (STARS) that uses bar codes to enable custom-
ers to track the status of their orders. The enhanced process transparency helps 
create new demand while retaining satisfied customers.
	
8.	Continuous improvement in customer service: Constantly learning new ways to 
enhance customer service is one of the key factors for companies to succeed in 
today’s marketplace. For example, Nordstrom bends over backward to please 
customers with gold-plated service and a no-questions-asked return policy. This 
company found that 90% of its business comes from a loyal 10% of its shoppers. 
(This is an example of the Pareto principle, described in Section 5.8.) The methods 
Nordstrom applies to achieve a high degree of customer retention and sustainable 
innovation are outlined as follows:

494
Engineering Management
a.	 Motivate employees by paying them very high rates of commission.
b.	 Use undercover shoppers to evaluate service and give cash rewards to employ-
ees who achieve a perfect score.
c.	 Delegate authority downward to allow autonomy and local decision-making.
	
	
Nordstrom’s strategy is compatible with the Service Profit Chain Model (Heskett 
et al. 2010). This model is unique in that it originates from company leadership 
(e.g., vision, values, energy, concern, and discipline). Superior leadership creates a 
good place for employees to work (e.g., through workplace design, job description 
and latitude, selection and development, communication and information, and 
tools for serving customers), which in turn produces satisfied employees. Happy 
and productive employees serve customers better. In turn, satisfied customers buy 
more and create increased profitability for the company.
	
9.	Technology-enabled services: The trend is toward an integration of various means 
of access available to customers, such as the web, direct dial-up, interactive voice 
response, and kiosks.
	
	
For example, customers are projected to be in the driver’s seat in influencing 
the development of IT technologies (Moschella 2003). The waves of IT technology 
move from a technology-centered paradigm to a customer-centered practice.
The first, system-centric, wave focused on developing proprietary systems. The second, 
PC-centric, wave centered on working out the hardware and software standards. The 
third, network-centric, wave dealt with Internet standards. The fourth, customer-centric, 
wave addresses the information content and transaction standards. This last wave aligns 
more closely the values of IT technologies with the needs of customers.
14.2.2  Enterprise Resource Planning and Application Integration
In the past, companies concentrated on achieving optimum performance in various indi-
vidual functional departments. Each of these departments had a tendency to pursue 
optimal operations within its own boundaries. Each department, similar to a silo, acted 
like a tightly controlled organizational unit with limited communications capabilities to 
the outside world across its boundaries, except through its top. In practice, the deficiencies 
created by poor, uncoordinated transactions between the functional groups more than 
offset the benefits of the local optimization they achieved. Thus, over time, it has become 
evident that corporate competitive advantages can be achieved only through the proper 
integration of the individual functional departments of, for example, engineering, manu-
facturing, design, customer service, procurement, finance, and accounting. Today’s trend 
is toward enterprise application integration (Myerson 2001).
An integration of disparate departmental functions permits greater access to informa-
tion, while linking employees, business partners, and customers more effectively. There 
are many enterprise application software products on the market that facilitate such inte-
gration. The obvious benefits created by this type of integration are speed, accuracy, and 
cost reduction, because of reduced manual handoffs (e.g., manpower), which allows busi-
ness decisions to be made faster, at higher quality and lower cost.
	
1.	Integrated communications systems: The trend is toward an integration of networks 
composed of telephones, cable TV, wireless, and computer data. The “last mile” 
bandwidth problem (from telephone switching in the office to the home) will 

495
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
likely be solved using fiber-optic systems. AT&T, Sprint, and MCI/Worldcom are 
said to be working on the integration of voice and data services
	
	
Browsers and modems are used as customer home contact points today. WebTV 
could very well replace these in the future.
	
2.	Wireless applications: The use of airwaves for other services in addition to phone 
calls is expected to increase. Data transfer to mobile units allows managers and 
leaders to make important decisions from anywhere at any time. For example, 
Palm Pilot (3Com) is a two-way personal communication tool in text format that 
displays real-time flight schedules, news headlines, and online transactions (such 
as movie ticket purchases, stock trading, etc.). The Nokia 9000 Communicator is a 
phone, web browser, and personal-messaging and data-organizing system. Apple’s 
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus systems enjoy much acceptance in the marketplace.
	
3.	Leveraged legacy systems: Middleware consists of connectivity products that link 
the existing legacy systems on mainframe computers with clients and servers and 
the Internet. Middleware performs the important function of making existing 
data widely available to employees and customers
14.2.3  Supply Strategy
Traditional enterprises create vertically integrated organizational structures and amass 
heavy physical assets to achieve competitive advantages in the marketplace. Knowledge-
economy companies form flexible supply chain partnerships to increase the speed to 
market and vary the product/service features to better satisfy the ever-changing needs 
of customers. Use is made of the technological and marketing expertise of the networked 
partners. Competitive advantages are thus derived from their capability to form such 
knowledge-intensive business networks, rather than from the value of capital assets piled 
up on the ground (Chopra 2015).
Outsourcing is a major trend that favors the formation of virtual enterprises. A single 
company working alone is no longer viable, as diverse competencies are needed to com-
pete in today’s marketplace. In these virtual enterprises, certain noncore business pro-
cesses will be strategically outsourced to achieve higher earnings and more pronounced 
competitive advantages. Examples include
•	 Niagara Mohawk, which outsources human resources and purchasing functions
•	 United Technologies and American Express, which outsource their procurement 
functions to IBM
Other companies have started outsourcing many of their noncore operations, concen-
trating instead on doing what they do best. For example, Sun Microsystems has focused on 
design, electing to contract out or purchase all workstation components. This strategy per-
mits Sun to (1) introduce new products rapidly, (2) achieve better quality, (3) ensure depend-
ability, (4) shorten speed to market, (5) gain flexibility, and (6) realize cost advantages.
Another example is Sara Lee, which focuses on building new products, managing 
brands, and building market share, while outsourcing the production of Leggs hosiery, 
frozen desserts, Wonderbras, Coach briefcases, and Kiwi shoe polish.
In essence, this strategy allows the company to jump on and slide down someone else’s 
experience curve (e.g., Boston Consulting Group’s 85 % curve) (Figure 8.13) to maximize 
benefits while maintaining flexibility in switching partners.

496
Engineering Management
The current push for better asset utilization (return on assets [ROA]) helps move com-
panies toward becoming knowledge intensive (through supply chain and marketing), 
rather than capital asset intensive (through in-house production). Better asset utilization 
can be achieved by creating contract partnerships, setting up global production networks, 
keeping overhead costs low, changing products frequently, and innovating through 
technology.
U.S. companies that market products to end users have also started to outsource such 
corporate functions as production, back-office work, logistics, after-sales service, procure-
ment, inventory management, and new product design. As this outsourcing trend con-
tinues, more demand is created for such service functions. The economy of scale dictates 
that new, vertically integrated product/service providers are likely to be created for the 
following purposes:
	
1.	Vertically integrated parts suppliers are becoming huge multinationals in 
their own right, and they are tightly integrated to create efficiency (e.g., Delphi 
Automotive). Their factories are designed to be quickly rearranged in order for the 
same shop to make different products for different client companies. The focus is 
on manufacturing products and operating at capacity almost all the time. They get 
cheap components by buying in quantity. Parts may come from various regions 
of the world. Their gross margins are relatively small (6%–8% on sales), but they 
generate good return on equity (e.g., 20%).
	
2.	Integrated service organizations take orders from banks, automakers, and phar-
maceutical companies to handle financial advisement, accounting, and other ser-
vices. Services offered to different industries are now bundled together. Certain 
design service providers may have teams of industrial, mechanical, and chip engi-
neers scattered around the world.
STEM professionals and leaders in these product/service provider companies will 
need to work in an interdisciplinary environment, as dictated by the companies’ mis-
sion to serve clients in different industries. Since these product and service providers 
conduct no R&D, perform no marketing, and develop no products, product innovations 
will have to come from their client companies’ own R&D departments or from third-
party start-ups.
Managers in the client companies will need to learn how to supervise the interac-
tions between diversified product and service providers, and to ensure that their break-
through idea—now entrusted to an outside provider to implement—will not benefit the 
competition.
14.2.4  Knowledge Management
Knowledge management refers to activities related to the preservation and enterprise-
wide application of corporate expertise and know-how to create competitive advantages 
(Tiwana 2015; Hislop 2013).
Business success depends on innovation and the expertise of competent knowledge 
workers, whose insights need to be properly preserved by documentation, knowledge shar-
ing, recruitment, and retention. The importance of knowledge management is becoming 
increasingly evident in the knowledge economy, wherein knowledge-intensive companies 
forcefully strive, as a corporate strategy, to attract talented and more mobile knowledge 
workers.

497
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
14.2.5  Changes in Organizational Settings
There will be two broad types of corporations in the near future. The first type generates 
and markets products and services to consumers (the end users). These companies retain 
core competencies and outsource everything else to selected service providers. A network 
of contract partners may produce the products or services, each being particularly efficient 
and outstanding in supplying specific components or elements. Outsourcing will succeed 
for these companies, as it has for Dell Computers, with products that are more than ade-
quate for the customers and that are composed of current technologies available from the 
company’s networked partners. Outsourcing requires a perfect understanding of what 
customers need and how the products are specified. Under these conditions, companies 
compete on the basis of speed, flexibility, and cost. Going virtual is thus becoming useful. 
This is a major change in organizational settings, moving toward the virtual organiza-
tional settings and away from vertical integration.
The other type of corporation will supply specialized parts, designs, and services to 
client companies under contracts. Acquiring various manufacturing facilities and orga-
nizing them into vertically integrated enterprises are the primary functions of these com-
panies. Their manufacturing plants are laid out in a flexible manner in order to respond 
to the divergent needs of global clients. This is a second change in organizational settings 
moving toward additional vertical integration.
Some virtually organized companies are swinging back toward vertically integrated 
operations to perform their creative and developmental tasks. The reason for this is that, to 
achieve breakthroughs in products and technologies, innovative performance is needed. 
Usually, virtual companies do not have sufficient information or resources to enable their 
networked partners to make parts for innovative products. On the other hand, a vertically 
integrated company can readily amass all of the needed resources under one roof and 
thus can be effective in developing new products/services. Cisco Systems has integrated 
its operations to develop new fiber-optical networks. So the pendulum swings back a little, 
from virtual to vertical integration, for those companies that intend to come up with inno-
vative products.
Not all companies should become virtual; neither should all functional elements of a 
company be vertical. The organizational form may have to be frequently adjusted accord-
ing to the company’s objectives, strategies, and changing environments.
14.2.6  Population Diversity
The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that there will be significant shifts in the American popu-
lation by 2050. Specifically, whites (non-Hispanics) will decrease from being 69% of the 
total population in 2003 to 50.1% in 2050, blacks from 12.6% to 14.52%, Hispanics from 
12.53% to 14.52%, and Asian/Pacific Islanders from 3.86% to 7.86%.
For example, the projected increase in Hispanics is due primarily to immigration. As 
a consequence, the U.S. workforce is expected to become more diverse (Ferdman 2013; 
Chin and Trimble 2014). Managers may need more diversity training, as more women and 
minorities are expected to attain key positions.
The trends described in this section have become noticeable in the marketplace since the 
turn of the millennium. All of these trends have important effects on how business priori-
ties are set and how companies are run. In the sections that follow, some of the anticipated 
changes will be elucidated, along with the challenges facing STEM professionals and lead-
ers in the new millennium.

14.3  Old Economy and Knowledge Economy Companies
Engineering enterprises in the old economy differ from those in the knowledge economy in 
many ways. These differences, which are briefly discussed in other chapters, are reviewed 
next (Capodagli and Jackson 2001).
14.3.1  Old Economy Companies
Typically, old economy companies are of a pyramidal structure. From the top, the CEO 
directs the company president, vice presidents, directors, and managers to lead, plan, 
organize, and control the workers at the bottom. The hierarchies are rigid, and the com-
pany boundaries are clearly marked.
These companies are capital intensive. They build such physical assets as facilities and 
equipment to create competitive advantages. They produce tangible goods such as cars, 
machines, refrigerators, and food products. Their business models are created around 
fixed assets, working capital, and economies of scale. They derive strength from mass pro-
duction, offering the same products at lower and lower prices. Examples include Ford, GE, 
GM, Johnson & Johnson, and other “brick-and-mortar” companies.
Shareholders own the company’s equity. All physical assets are readily fenced in and 
chained down so that company management can exert full control over these important 
assets that serve as the basis of the company’s competitiveness in the marketplace.
Companies deploy in-house capabilities. Major functions are vertically integrated, start-
ing from raw materials, work in progress, finished goods, distribution, marketing, and 
sales, and ending with support service to customers. The emphasis is on self-sufficiency, 
stability, and incremental growth.
These companies create intensive rivalries with competitors to motivate employees and 
to ensure success in the marketplace. Companies are run as “going concerns,” intended to 
last forever.
In old economy companies, innovative ideas typically float up the chain of command 
to be screened and reshaped for further evaluation before finally being presented for 
decision-making and possible implementation sometime in the future. Decision-making 
is resource centered. Resource centering is the optimum use of limited resources available 
to the company.
These companies maintain a staff to process order entry, invoicing, accounts receivable, 
accounts payable, procurement, shipping, delivery, and other functions. Such processes 
take time and cost money. Also, internal financial performance reports are typically pre-
pared on a monthly basis.
14.3.2  Knowledge Economy Companies
Knowledge economy companies center on a small number of core operations. They have 
a permanent staff to advance technologies, but they assume a predominantly web-like 
organizational design that links business partners, employees, external contractors, 
suppliers, and customers in various collaborative arrangements. All participants in the 
networked arrangements grow interdependently. The networks remain flexible, and the 
business and activity boundaries of the companies are vague and fluid. Knowledge-
economy companies aim to achieve future growth by way of networked partnerships 
(Lefebvre et al. 2013).

499
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
These companies are idea intensive, as ideas are the key assets in a knowledge-based 
economy. The assets are in employees’ heads, not physically constructed on the ground. 
They provide digitizable goods and services (e.g., data, software, books, news, music, 
movies, games, financial services, and advertising). Knowledge economy companies also 
e-transform themselves to produce commodity-type goods (e.g., jeans, cosmetics, comput-
ers, clothing, and sneakers). Their business strategies emphasize cost reduction by apply-
ing technologies secured through networks, and they bring breakthrough ideas to their 
markets first.
They derive strength from mass customization, wherein customers are given tools to 
design individually preferred products. Excellent examples include the following:
	
1.	Dell offers custom-designed computer systems from a group of well-defined sys-
tem components (memory size, hard-drive capabilities, modem type, monitor, etc.) 
with price and delivery options.
	
2.	Levi’s presents custom-designed Spin jeans for special fit, style, and color, with 
1.7 million variations to choose from.
	
3.	Procter & Gamble (P&G) offers custom-designed cosmetics and perfumes with up 
to 50,000 different choices.
	
4.	Nike customizes sneakers by features, styles, and colors.
	
5.	American Quantum Cycles custom-designs motorcycles that use different seats, 
handlebars, and paint colors.
	
6.	Charles Schwab’s mutual funds screener allows customers to design their own 
investment portfolios.
	
7.	Mattel’s My Design Barbie lets customers build a friend for Barbie by choosing 
hairstyle, color, complexion, and eye color for a doll.
	
8.	Cisco’s Marketplace allows business customers to create routers, switches, and 
hubs to build specific computer hardware systems.
	
9.	Point.com’s Service Plan Locator allows customers to choose wireless phones, ser-
vice plans, and accessories.
Such choice boards allow companies to first sell and then produce, instead of the former 
way of spending money to create products and services, hoping to eventually sell some 
or all of them. These companies have high price-to-book (P/B) value ratios and high per-
employee market values. For example, Microsoft employed 31,000 people at one time and 
has a market value of $600 billion. Yahoo has a P/B ratio of 40. Other such high-performing 
companies include Apple, Google and Amazon.
Shareholders of these companies do not have true ownership of the intellectual 
property assets, as ideas reside within the employees’ heads and cannot be controlled. 
Because of workforce mobility, this is a significant risk factor for knowledge economy 
companies.
Typically, knowledge economy companies build their core competencies, outsource 
the rest, and are virtually integrated. They nurture an array of formal and informal 
networks of partnerships and alliances consisting of free agents, outside contractors, 
designers, prototype producers, manufacturers and distributors, and others. As part-
nerships and alliances shift, these networks change accordingly. They focus on achiev-
ing advantages in technology and in time to market in order to realize outstanding 
growths.

500
Engineering Management
By outsourcing noncore activities (manufacturing, product design, accounting, procure-
ment, customer services, janitorial services, and others), companies save time and man-
agement attention, if not money, to go after big opportunities of the e-future. Well-known 
examples include the following companies:
•	 Cisco Systems, the most networked organization, with all administrative func-
tions conducted over the Internet, owns only 2 of 34 plants that make its products, 
and 90% of the company’s orders are not handled by human hands.
•	 Dell manages the most efficient supply chain network, maintaining an inventory 
for six days only.
•	 General Motors created a “sensing and responding” supply chain for delivering 
customized vehicles in 10–12 days in 2003–2004.
Sometimes companies collaborate even with competitors to achieve win–win solutions. 
For example, Covisint is an electronic trading exchange created collaboratively by several 
automakers, namely, GM, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Renault-Nissan, to streamline parts 
procurement and generate revenue.
Excellent ideas are instantly transmitted through the web-like organizational networks. 
Empowered employees make decisions that center on creating competitive advantages 
through shortened time to market and better customer satisfaction, which will bring 
about an increase in top line. Companies achieve “virtual financial close” as the processes 
of order entry, invoicing, shipping, accounts receivable, accounts payable, procurement, 
and others are digitized to function seamlessly, making all financial performance data 
only “one click away.” Massive digitization allows companies to remove people from 
various routine assignments and thus achieve advantages in cost, speed, and quality of 
information.
In the United States, interaction costs, which are the expenses incurred to get differ-
ent people and companies to work together to create and sell products/services, account 
for about 50% of all labor costs. Because these interactions are automated in knowledge-
economy companies, their initial productivity gains are predicted to reach 20%–40% per 
year. These companies embrace digitization through the deployment of suitable enterprise 
integration software systems. Specific examples of unit cost reduction strategies include 
the following:
	
1.	Bank transactions: A transaction by a bank teller costs $1.25, compared with 54 cents 
by phone, 24 cents by ATM, and 2 cents by the Internet.
	
2.	Procurement: This costs $140 for people to procure parts and supplies, compared 
with $11.70 with an Internet-based catalog system (Corning, for example).
	
3.	Handling job applicants and resumes: This costs $128 for a people-based procedure, 
but only 6 cents when accomplished by digitizing the process and eliminating 
manual labor.
	
4.	Customer inquiry processing: This costs $50 over the phone, compared with 50 cents 
with the Internet (General Electric, for example).
The key is to make Internet use a strategic priority. Spotting opportunities early and 
exploiting them fast will work. Knowledge economy companies regard human skills, 
expertise, and relationships as the most precious resources in an organization, whereas the 
twentieth-century “brick-and-mortar” companies emphasize physical assets of production.

14.4  Characteristics of Progressive Companies
Progressive companies are those knowledge economy companies which make it a strategic 
priority to utilize Internet-based technologies, invent innovative business models, create 
supply chain networks, empower a diversified workforce, and pursue customer satisfac-
tion in order to achieve business success in the marketplace.
The major trends discussed in Section 14.3 tend to shape the progressive companies 
of the new millennium. These companies look for real-time customer feedback (e.g., via 
online chat rooms) to get customers to talk about performance and problems. They focus 
on a market segment of one, delivering mass-customized products and services. They 
induce loyalty by managing the customer relationship well. They view the enduring rela-
tionship with employees as an enormous asset, because these employees connect the com-
pany to its partners. Their total workforce consists of permanent staff, temporary service 
people, contract workers, free agents, and consultants. The companies are further linked 
to the employees of their networked partners. Like actors and athletes, talented business-
people will have agents to represent them.
A case in point is Nokia, a cell phone giant in Europe. The company entered the U.S. 
market successfully with only five permanent employees by outsourcing sales, marketing, 
logistics, and technical support. Nokia employees work with a mix of contract teammates 
from around the globe, many of whom they never meet face to face. Every project calls for 
a new team composed of people with special talents and skills. In such a dynamic setting, 
information that is more than one hour old will be viewed with skepticism. Everyone’s 
performance is carefully and constantly evaluated. If there is no contribution, there will be 
no continued membership.
Progressive companies streamline most staff jobs by employing certain types of enter-
prise-planning systems. They devote special attention to supply chain management, enter-
prise integration, customer relations, knowledge management, web-enabled transactions, 
and globalization.
Companies in the new millennium must manage all stakeholders well in order to suc-
ceed in the marketplace. They take care of all five categories of stakeholders: (1) Investors 
are needed for capital to grow. (2) Customers provide the sources of sales revenue growth 
and earning stability. (3) Employees provide productivity and client satisfaction. (4) Suppliers 
provide competitive advantages in technology, innovation, and supply chain manage-
ment. (5) Communities influence the company’s reputation, as well as local regulations, and 
legislation that the company must manage. Some of the unique characteristics of these 
companies are described next.
14.4.1  Complex Organizational Design
The organizational form of progressive companies may be large and complex. They have 
less mass, as various in-house functions are performed by alliances, joint ventures, and 
partners in networks, and they tend to constantly shift portfolios of businesses and assets. 
The new trends discussed in this chapter reflect the competitive needs for operational 
efficiency and customer focus. The drive for efficiency and a customer-centered corporate 
strategy is enabled by available technologies.
A traditional value chain is typically driven by core competencies (as depicted by the 
flowchart in Figure 14.1), starting from what the companies can do best and then defining 
products and services that the customers may want.

502
Engineering Management
A reverse-value chain begins with customer needs (defined by extensive customer study 
and market research) and works backward along the fulfillment chain into company capa-
bilities and functions (see Figure 14.2).
Enterprises organized according to the reverse-value chain tend to be more capable of 
satisfying the needs of customers, a key requirement for business success in the twenty-
first century (Hines 2000).
Another guideline useful for organizational design is to choose a narrow focus. Few 
organizations can do many things well; none shine in every dimension of business, such 
as cost, quality, price, convenience, and ease of use. Examples of a narrow focus in business 
include service, operation, and innovation. Service excellence focuses on strong CRM that 
anticipates customers’ needs, enables self-service, and offers value. Operational excellence 
stresses the optimal leverage of assets, efficient transactions, customized solutions (sales 
intelligence, management of customers’ expectations), the use of measurement systems, 
outsourcing noncore processes, end-to-end process effectiveness, and others. Continuous 
innovation excellence exhibits product leadership to delight customers, grows by merger 
and acquisitions, proactively educates customers about how to use and benefit from new 
products, and encourages innovation.
A progressive enterprise must link three major groups of stakeholders together: (a) cus-
tomers, (b) back-office workers, and (c) supply chain partners. After these groups of stake-
holders are properly linked together, the design of a progressive enterprise organization 
may contain major units, as illustrated in Figure 14.3.
14.4.2  Global Reach
Progressive companies serve global markets by increasing product specifications and oth-
erwise offering products that differ from those in the domestic markets. They also derive 
more revenues from overseas markets than domestic markets and have future growth 
opportunities weighted toward emerging markets.

14.4.3  Partnerships
Progressive companies are dynamic. They constantly create external networks to access 
product innovation, process technologies, manage working capital, maintain market 
access, and cultivate knowledge. These critical linkages are based on mutual benefit, trust, 
empathy, and good communication—and they are vigorously protected (Siegel et al. 2003).
14.4.4  New Composition of Employees
The full-time regular employees in progressive companies are technically literate; they 
embody the core competencies of these companies. Some of these employees may reside 
abroad, have modern attitudes toward the employer–employee relationship, and change 
jobs frequently, preferring opportunities for interesting and challenging work that 
stretches their abilities.
Supporting these core employees are various part-timers, independent contractors, agency 
temporaries, and employees of vendors and consultants who will also be engaged. Therefore, 
the company may have a smaller share of support staff provided by outside agencies.
Example 14.1
What are some new characteristics of workers in the twenty-first century?
Answer 14.1

2.	 Professional groups are likely to offer the senses of identity and community, 
health insurance, and other benefits needed by free agents who move from one 
company to another.
	
3.	 Each employee may have as many as 20 different jobs throughout a career of 
45 years (an average of 2.5 years per job). They tend to constantly bargain for 
better deals within their organizations (e.g., stock options, a sign-up bonus, 
new projects, Thursdays off, an August sabbatical).
	
4.	 Workers seek to acquire a broad set of marketable skills, as companies will con-
tinue to outsource white-collar jobs and spread centers of excellence around 
the world to seek advantages in cost, speed, and expertise.
	
5.	 STEM professionals and leaders need to be flexible and adaptable to organi-
zational changes and become cosmopolitan, equally at ease both at home and 
abroad.
14.4.5  Management Reporting Layers
Progressive companies will have fewer reporting layers between business units, divisions, 
and executive management. Business units will increasingly operate autonomously and be 
measured by specific performance metrics (e.g., a balanced scorecard).
14.4.6  Customer Sophistication and Demand
In the new millennium, customers will be better informed, more sophisticated, and 
increasingly demanding. They will use the Internet to access information, demand product 
customization, require price transparency, and conduct comparison shopping. Customer 
satisfaction will hinge on product/service features and quality, and after-sales support 
and services. More data on customer satisfaction will be published on the web, exposing 
the market leaders and followers in every industry. Progressive companies focus on serv-
ing their customers well.
14.4.7  Brand Image
Because a good public image is regarded as a competitive advantage, progressive compa-
nies nurture a positive reputation of being reliable and ethical. Brand image is expected to 
become increasingly important to the stakeholders of all companies.
Progressive companies strive to protect public interests from ill-conceived mergers and 
acquisitions, dangerous operating practices, antisocial business decisions, and oligopolis-
tic behaviors. Governments are known to have taken decisive actions against some viola-
tors in the past, for example: (1) Alaska opposed BP Amoco’s acquisition of ARCO to take a 
70% share of Alaska’s oil and gas reserves; (2) Italy accused Coke of distorting competition 
rules; (3) the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) raised issues with Microsoft’s monopoly of 
the Windows operating system market; and (4) the U.S. DOJ approved the merger of AOL 
and Time Warner only after having studied it for more than one year.
14.4.8  Stock Market Valuation
The stock valuation of progressive companies will be based on returns on their intan-
gible assets instead of their tangible ones. The intangible assets of a company include (a) 
brand capital (customers and the community) and (b) knowledge capital (strategic sup-
pliers and employees). Progressive companies are capable of optimizing the return on 

505
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
these intangible assets that form the primary basis for the companies’ competitiveness 
in the marketplace.
14.5  Transition to the Knowledge Economy
Numerous old economy companies need to modify their business practices in order to 
become successful in the knowledge economy (Lefebvre et al. 2013).
For companies to succeed in the new millennium, several corporate values are critical. 
Speed is important, as time may be more valuable than money. Companies looking for 
speed may favor the strategy of buying over building. Talents are crucial, as companies 
compete largely on the capabilities of attracting the best people, empowering them to 
innovate, and creating an environment that makes the best people want to stay. Market 
dominance refers to the company’s emphasis on long-term market position rather than 
quarter-to-quarter increments in performance. Customer orientation signals the value 
placed by the company on tracking the needs of customers and creating supply chains 
to quickly and reliably satisfy them. Efficiency is a critical corporate value: companies 
streamline operations using advanced software technologies, such as enterprise integra-
tion systems, to adapt to a changing marketplace. Finally, outsourcing represents a prefer-
ence for the company to farm out noncore activities in order to conserve resources, time, 
and management attention.
Outsourcing cuts down on a company’s investment, shortens it’s time to market, and 
enables it to take advantage of the unique skills and expertise of the supply partners 
in the production of products and services. For example, Cisco Systems is known to 
have dropped in-house R&D in favor of buying start-up companies for its technologi-
cal needs. Companies need to aggressively engage partnerships, form supply alliances, 
and create networks with domestic and international suppliers of raw materials, subas-
semblies, semifinished goods, and others to flexibly and speedily make finished prod-
ucts. Outsourcing facilitates mass customization by which product features are steadily 
modified to meet customers’ needs. The major issues involved in outsourcing and in the 
management of supply chain networks are addressed next (McGrath and Hoole 1992; 
Venkatesan 1992).
14.5.1  Product Design and Specification
Managers need to communicate and enforce interface specifications of all parts manufac-
tured by the partners. Standardizing interfaces to promote exchangeability of parts and 
create varying product features is essential. Effective infrastructure hardware and soft-
ware systems will facilitate supply chain management. Companies also need to integrate 
middleware, electronic data interchange, systems technologies, regulations, production 
practices, and other elements of their business.
Reducing the number of global component suppliers may be accomplished by mini-
mizing the number of components in products. Designing each component innovatively 
by the use of common components minimizes reengineering to meet local needs. The 
company should strive to exceed local quality requirements to create a competitive 
advantage.

506
Engineering Management
14.5.2  Manufacturing
Managers should take the following actions: (1) selectively utilize web-based manu-
facturing and operations enablers to attain business advantages; (2) make critical parts 
in-house and combine with vendor-supplied parts to assemble the finished products; 
(3)  specify assembly procedures to ensure product integrity; (4) conduct a statistical 
process control (SPC) to ensure system quality of the assembled finished products; and 
(5) pursue International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and other quality process 
certifications.
Linking design with manufacturing allows production costs to move down the learning 
curve. Successful companies produce high-labor-content parts in low-labor-cost areas and 
use skilled labor for other high-technology components. The assembly of finished prod-
ucts in plants close to local markets ensures response to local content laws, import duties, 
final tests, and quality control. Transferring components to assembly plants and shifting 
like components from plant to plant balances the load among regions.
14.5.3  Management
Companies need to (1) share information and collaborate with networked global partners; 
(2) preserve corporate knowledge and ensure global application and learning; (3) set up 
a CRM system by tapping into the expertise, innovation, and knowledge base of the net-
worked partnership; (4) assist in implementing an ERP system to optimize the utilization 
of corporate assets; and (5) make the production process transparent to be traceable by 
customers.
STEM professionals and leaders may be particularly qualified to facilitate the transi-
tions of old economy companies into knowledge economy companies. Companies of the 
twenty-first century will form more external relationships with networked suppliers, key 
customer groups, or client companies for which products or services are made on contract. 
The uniqueness of these relationships can be attributed to their characteristics:
•	 Transience: A contractual relationship may last for a short period of time, until the 
market conditions call for change.
•	 Diversity: Partners may be global, with varying degrees of differences in culture, 
language, working norms, and value systems.
•	 Coordination: Strong coordination capabilities are needed, along with project 
management skills, to handle human relations, risk management, conflict reso-
lution, tolerance for uncertainty, problem solving, motivation capabilities, and 
communication.
Managers also need to spend increasing amounts of time nurturing external relationships.
14.5.4  Various Other Issues
There are additional issues that need to be addressed properly. Managers must ensure 
just-in-time (JIT) delivery and optimize transportation logistics. Balancing loads between 
global sites will enable the company to adjust to changing supply and demand and mar-
ketplace conditions. The company must proactively respond to labor, political, currency, 
and other unexpected changes and conflicts. Procuring almost all parts centrally, except 
low-cost and low-volume items, helps the company to realize economies of scale. Vendors 

507
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
are to be centrally qualified. The company needs to coordinate marketing and sales fore-
casts centrally for global markets, on the basis of local inputs.
Example 14.2
Companies in the future will rely more and more on temporary workers, special-
ized vendors, and consultants to flexibly address unique needs and contingencies. 
Employer–employee relations will become peer-to-peer relations rather than the hier-
archical ones. STEM professionals will find that their careers are less stable than in 
previous generations.
In your opinion, what is the most important thing that STEM professionals and lead-
ers can do to prepare for this volatile, uncertain, and dynamic scenario?
Answer 14.2
STEM professionals and leaders need to proactively manage their own careers more 
closely than ever before, while keeping their skills, knowledge, and experience market-
able. A good way to focus is to pursue lifetime learning about the changes in technolo-
gies, tools, industry, and business. Those STEM professionals who do not take care of 
their own careers will rapidly become redundant.
The employer’s position is well stated by Bahrami (1992): “You own your own career, 
we provide you with opportunity!”
14.6  Personal Strategies for the Future
STEM professionals and leaders need to personally ready themselves to meet challenges 
in the future related to the application of Internet-based technologies and the extension of 
market reach and globalization (Stettner 2013; Kamp 2012). To acquire the skills to be suc-
cessful in the future (Chang, 2016), they should:
	
1.	Get postgraduate education, which will be increasingly essential to achieving per-
sonal prosperity in the future. Learn how to learn quickly. Constantly hone skills 
and acquire broader perspectives.
	
2.	Become efficient in digesting vast amounts of information, measuring trade-
offs, and making the right choices. Be computer and Internet literate, develop 
conceptualization skills, and acquire fast reading and knowledge-processing 
capabilities.
	
3.	Acquire a good understanding of new products and markets in transition, which 
are often defined by ever-changing technologies.
	
4.	Be a capable communicator, compromiser, and leader of change.
	
5.	Foster external relationships and networks of partners to succeed. The number 
and complexity of partnerships are expected to increase.
	
6.	Lead with suitable style. Visualize yourself as the director of a symphony orches-
tra or ballet company. The leader sets the vision, but allows the individual “artists” 
to perform, and to fashion their own roles in the performance. The key ability is 
to be assertive and ultimately emerge with a common direction to which everyone 
becomes committed.

508
Engineering Management
	
7.	Supervise temporary employees, outside contractors, and other service providers. 
The number of permanent employees will decline and the number of transient 
workers will increase.
	
8.	Become familiar with the capital market, as leaders will spend more and more 
time attracting venture capital. Skills to communicate with analysts and investors 
are important.
	
9.	Prepare for intensive enterprise integration due to globalization. Exercise “pattern 
recognition” to spot trends that may affect the company’s future.
	 10.	Acquire the following minimum survival skills for twenty-first century office 
workers:
a.	 Be good at something the world values. Keep up marketable skills to offer 
value above and beyond what others can offer elsewhere. These skills include:
i	
Leadership—technology planning, management of diversified employees, 
and perspectives with global orientation are essential.
ii	 Technologies—include core, emerging, and innovative. There must be a 
love of technology present. Since technology changes everything, embrac-
ing it is essential.
b.	 Stay away from service technologies that are readily outsourced. These include 
software programming, procedure or manual preparation, basic design assign-
ments, customer support, product testing, experiments, statistical studies and 
analyses, and other rudimentary engineering/technology jobs.
c.	 Also, stay away from those company functions that are being taken over by 
enterprise integration software systems (e.g., Oracle, Ariba, I2, and Baan). 
Understand clearly what these software systems can do, and then focus your 
efforts on acquiring skills for the high-level work that such software systems 
cannot perform.
	 11.	Create networks. Whom do you know? What do others know that you can use? It 
is extremely important to link with future project mates and peers who appreci-
ate your talents and capabilities. Determine whom you can call on to further your 
current and future projects and goals.
	 12.	Nurture an entrepreneurial instinct. Seize opportunities for new projects and act 
on them.
	 13.	Do marketing, as suggested by a popular slogan:. “Early to bed, early to rise, work 
like in hell, advertise!” Tell your story to let people know more about you; have a 
personal website; attend trade show presentations.
	 14.	Grow better constantly. Manifest a passion for renewal.
	 15.	Prepare oneself to acquire a broad-based background in design, engineering, mar-
keting, and finance in order to inform better decision-making.
14.7  Contributions in the New Millennium
Significant changes are anticipated as a result of the transformation of old economy (verti-
cal) companies to knowledge-economy (virtual) companies.

509
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
Knowledge economy companies rely more on innovations, brand, customers, and unique 
knowledge to compete and less on hard assets, such as the plants, equipment, real estate, 
and traditional distribution channels of the old economy companies. STEM professionals 
and leaders will play an increasingly important role in the new millennium.
14.7.1  Technologies
Applying technological intuition to lead in business planning involves the deployment of 
emerging technologies (Spencer and Johnston 2002; Brown and Heller 2003). STEM profes-
sionals and leaders are particularly qualified to constantly track the development of emerg-
ing technologies and actively screen them to allow for possible adoption for in-house use.
Example 14.3
Continuous improvement is a critical requirement for all companies. How can the pro-
cess of continuous improvement be implemented in the new millennium?
Answer 14.3
Continuous improvement helps companies to remain competitive in the marketplace. 
To manage the continuous improvement process, company management should do the 
following:
	
1.	 Specify objectives in consultation with top management. Assign the respon-
sibility of managing the continuous improvement process to someone with 
visibility. Commit resources and establish a central office to coordinate the 
continuous improvement efforts. The mission of this office must be communi-
cated to all employees.
	
2.	 Define specific goals in a number of areas, on the basis of inputs from various 
divisions, using standards derived by gleaning the available best practices in 
the industry.
	
3.	 Create a number of task forces by interviewing and selecting capable and 
devoted people who have expertise in diversified disciplines. Each task force 
should be empowered to pursue improvement ideas in a specified domain.
	
4.	 Hold teamwork training sessions for members of diversified cultural and tech-
nical backgrounds. Visit team members in various locations to establish con-
tact, assure understanding, and build trust.
	
5.	 Set up a communications system (e.g., an intranet, videoconferences, regional 
meetings, and phone, fax, or multimedia technologies) to enable members to 
interact constantly. Apply web-based tools to foster close collaboration.
	
6.	 Create “suggestion box systems” at each site for members to solicit and obtain 
inputs from knowledgeable employees. All employees are encouraged to con-
tribute new ideas for optional improvement.
	
7.	 Empower the task-force teams to implement improvement ideas deemed use-
ful and to apply resources made available from a central continuous improve-
ment office.
	
8.	 Reward employees who suggested those creative ideas that produced positive 
results after implementation. Present awards in well-advertised meetings to 
promote the continuous improvement effort. Publish awards and the positive 
results in company newsletters and other suitable media to practice positive 
reinforcement.
	
9.	 Encourage the cross-pollination of ideas from all employees at various loca-
tions to take advantage of their diversified experience and viewpoints.
	
10.	 Summarize and publicize possible results on a regular basis.

14.7.2  Innovations
Applying innovations to shorten product development cycles, reduce time to market, 
cut costs, and add features will create competitive advantages (Deschamps and Nelson 
2014). Companies create new businesses by following a typical six-step process, (see 
Chapter 10).
	
1.	Define and develop core technologies to solidify company strengths (best prac-
tices, continuous improvement). Core technologies represent the foundation for 
corporate partnerships and alliances.
	
2.	Create products and services built around core technologies to differentiate from 
others and to succeed in the marketplace.
	
3.	Validate market acceptance of proposed product and service concepts.
	
4.	Conduct technical feasibility tests to produce and deliver the proposed product or 
service. Focus on networked partner supply chains, distribution logistics, sales, 
and services.
	
5.	Raise capital by selling company stocks or from venture funding.
	
6.	Implement the approved business plan by systematically using improved best 
practices.
It is noteworthy that four of the six steps listed in this section need significant innovative 
inputs from STEM professionals and leaders. Creating strategic differentiation needs to 
become a high-priority activity for them to add value.
14.7.3  Value Addition to E-Transitions
STEM professionals and leaders should seek to apply web-based technologies to improve 
efficiency; develop mass customization (“build-to-order”) systems—using design, produc-
tion, logistics, and service—to strengthen corporate competitiveness; and transform other 
corporate functions to add business values. Creating operational excellence should also be 
a high-priority activity with which to add value.
14.7.4  Customer and Knowledge
The management of customers, knowledge, and connections is of critical importance. 
STEM professionals should contribute in the following areas:
	
1.	Relationship management: CRM involves analyzing data generated by call cen-
ters and other sources and devising programs to foster relationships with 
customers.
	
2.	Connectivity creation: Connectivity development, maintenance between business 
partners (e.g., suppliers, alliance partners, employees, and customers), and con-
tent management (e.g., software selection, hardware specification, system design, 
interface design, quality assurance, and control of proprietary information) are 
essential.
	
3.	Knowledge management: STEM professionals are reminded that “It is not who you 
know. It is what who you know knows.” How can your knowledge and theirs be 
combined to create new win–win opportunities?

511
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
14.7.5  Social Responsibility and Leadership
STEM professionals and leaders should become visible leaders in society by speaking out 
more forcefully on broad issues of social interest on behalf of their companies and profes-
sional associations. Examples of such broad issues include
	
1.	Ethics and integrity of business and leadership
	
2.	Environmentally friendly corporate policies to combat global warming
	
3.	Globalization and the environment
	
4.	National energy policies that focus on conservation or exploration
	
5.	The question of taxation on the Internet
	
6.	The patient’s bill of rights in dealing with health maintenance organizations 
(HMOs)
	
7.	Investment of social security benefits by individuals
Example 14.4
In the new millennium, STEM professionals and leaders will need to be prepared to 
lead and manage technology-intensive companies and industries. What specific tech-
nology management activities should they be concerned with?
Answer 14.4
Generally speaking, there are eight activities that STEM professionals and leaders 
should pay attention to (Thamhain 2005):
	
1.	 Integrating technology into the overall strategic objectives of the firm (strategic 
planning)
	
2.	 Getting into and out of technologies effectually (gatekeeping)
	
3.	 Assessing and evaluating technology more effectively (making decisions and 
choices)
	
4.	 Conceiving better methods for transferring and assimilating new technology 
(managing technical knowledge)
	
5.	 Reducing new product development time (creating supply chains and apply-
ing innovations)
	
6.	 Managing large, complex, and interdisciplinary or interorganizational proj-
ects, programs, and systems (leading cross-functional or global teams)
	
7.	 Managing the organization’s internal use of technology (leading teams and 
managing projects)
	
8.	 Leveraging the effectiveness of technical professionals (managing knowledge 
workers)
STEM professionals and leaders should focus not only on R&D management or man-
agement of technical professionals, but also on managing manufacturing and process 
technology, new product development, and other technology-intensive functions in an 
organization. In addition, they strive to implement projects and programs correctly the 
first time and dedicate their efforts to continuous improvement. They are capable of com-
mercializing technology products because they possess the required background and 
training in activity-based costing (cost accounting), net present value (NPV) analysis 
(financial management), and customer relations management (marketing management). 
The critical roles of STEM professionals and leaders are well recognized, as technology is 
of strategic importance to any profit-seeking enterprises.

14.8  The Challenges Ahead
This book is aimed at assisting STEM professionals and leaders in assuming leader-
ship positions in enterprises of the twenty-first century. Many of these enterprises are 
affected by rapid changes in technology and the fast-paced advancement of globalization. 
Anonymous (2012) reviewed various future scenarios for the next 15–20 years and offered 
the following foresights:
	
1.	By 2030, there will be a shift of economic power (e.g., measured in gross domestic 
product [GDP]) from the United States, Europe, and Japan to China, India, and 
Brazil. By 2025, China alone will contribute about one-third of global economic 
growth.
	
2.	The world will have a total population of 8.3 billion people (2030), from 7.1 billion 
(2012), including a major growth in the global middle class, especially in the East.
	
3.	The projected changes in population include: (a) aging, (b) shrinking number of 
youthful societies and states, (c) migration of workers, and (4) urbanization of the 
population.
In combination, these scenarios suggest that there will be an increased demand for ser-
vices as related to health care, professional advisement, retail trade, leisure and hospitality, 
governmental services, transportation, education, financial activities, information services, 
and others in the global marketplace. STEM professionals would have to be under a rock 
to not know that we are in a global economic growth period. The key challenges for exist-
ing service enterprises would then be how they could make use of the currently available 
technologies to preferentially participate in these new growth markets, while fully taking 
into account the local cultural norms and customs. STEM professionals should have the 
wherewithal to help meet these critical challenges.
The pathways outlined in this book to periodically introduce novel product/service 
packages in order to create strategic differentiation in the marketplace and employ pro-
ductivity-enhancing tools to achieve operational excellence in all work processes should 
allow all enterprises engaged in global markets to stand out.
The first section of the book consists of the basic functions of engineering management, 
such as planning (Chapter 2), organizing (Chapter 3), leading (Chapter 4), and control-
ling (Chapter 5). These functions provide STEM professionals and leaders with founda-
tion skills to manage themselves, staff, teams, projects, technologies, and global issues of 
importance.
Best practices are emphasized as the pertinent standards for goal setting and per-
formance measurement. STEM professionals and leaders solve problems and minimize 
conflicts to achieve the company’s objectives. They use the Rational method to make 
decisions and take lawful and ethical actions. They engage Monte Carlo methods to 
assess projects involving risks and uncertainties. They apply emerging technologies, 
motivate a professional workforce of diversified backgrounds, develop new generations 
of products and services in a timely manner, and constantly surpass the best practices 
in industry.
The roles of STEM professionals and leaders in strategic planning, employee selection, 
team building, delegating, decision-making, and managing creativity and innovation are 
explained. The augmentation of managerial competencies is emphasized.

513
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
The second section of the book covers the fundamentals of business, including cost 
accounting (Chapter  6), financial accounting and analysis (Chapter  7), and marketing 
management (Chapter 8). This section is written to enable STEM professionals and leaders 
to acquire a broadened perspective of the company business and its stakeholders and to 
facilitate their interactions with peer groups and units.
These chapters also prepare STEM professionals and leaders to make decisions related 
to cost, finance, products, service, and capital budgets. Discount cash flow and internal 
rate of return (IRR) analyses are reviewed. These discussions are of critical importance, as 
decisions made during the product design phase typically determine up to 85% of the final 
costs of products. Additional discussions are presented of activity-based costing (ABC), to 
define indirect costs related to products and services, and of economic value added (EVA), 
which determines the real profitability of an enterprise above and beyond the cost of capi-
tal deployed.
Also presented is capital formation through equity and debt financing. Resource alloca-
tion concepts for assets in place and option pricing for capital investment opportunities 
are addressed as well. By understanding the project evaluation criteria and the tools of 
financial analyses, STEM professionals and leaders will be in a better position to secure 
project approvals. A critical step to refining technological projects is the acquisition and 
incorporation of customer feedback. For STEM professionals and leaders to lead, they must 
meet the major challenges that arise from the initiation, development, and implementa-
tion of major technological projects, which contribute to the long-term profitability of the 
company.
The important roles and responsibilities of marketing in any profit-seeking enterprise 
are then introduced, along with the supporting contributions expected of STEM profes-
sionals and leaders. Various progressive enterprises are increasingly concentrating on 
CRM to grow their businesses. This customer orientation is expected to continue to serve 
as a key driving force for product design, project management, plant operation, manufac-
turing, customer service, and countless other engineering-centered activities.
The third section of the book addresses six major topics: engineers as managers and lead-
ers (Chapter 9), creativity and innovation (Chapter 10), ethics in engineering and business 
management (Chapter 11), operational excellence (Chapter 12), globalization (Chapter 13), 
and engineering management in the new millennium (Chapter 14). These discussions pro-
vide additional building blocks to enhance the preparation that STEM professionals and 
leaders must undertake to assume technology leadership positions and to meet the chal-
lenges in the new millennium.
Figure 14.4 illustrates the 12 building blocks, covered by this book, which establish the 
solid foundation of new engineering management leadership.
STEM professionals are known to possess strong skill sets that enable them to do 
extraordinarily well in certain types of managerial work. However, some of them may 
also exhibit weaknesses that prevent them from becoming effective leaders in engineer-
ing organizations. The expected norms of effective leaders are described. Steps enabling 
STEM professionals and leaders to augment their leadership qualities and attune them-
selves to value-centered business acumen are elaborated. Certain outlined steps should be 
of great value to those who want to become better prepared for creating new products or 
services based on technology, integrating technology into their organizations, and leading 
technology-based organizations.
A number of tried-and-true rules are included to serve as suitable guidelines for STEM 
professionals and leaders to become excellent leaders. Above all, they are expected to lead 
with a vision of how to apply company core competencies to create value, insights into 

514
Engineering Management
how to seize opportunities offered by emerging technologies, and innovations in making 
products and services better, faster, and cheaper, so that they constantly improve customer 
satisfaction. The concepts of value addition, customer focus, time to market, mass custom-
ization, supply chains, enterprise resources integration, and others are also elucidated.
Although STEM professionals and leaders are already known to be ranked highly in 
trustworthiness and integrity (ahead of businessmen, bankers, certified public accoun-
tants, politicians, lawyers, and others), it is important for all STEM professionals and 
leaders to remain vigilant in observing a code of ethics. Other topics related to ethics are 
discussed, with examples of several difficult ethical dilemmas.
The changes wrought by the Internet are transforming most aspects of company busi-
ness, including information dissemination, product distribution, and customer service. As 
computer processor design, software development, and transmission hardware technolo-
gies continue to advance, their roles in business will surely grow steadily and affect vari-
ous functions of engineering management in the future. STEM professionals and leaders 
need to know which web-based enablers for engineering and management are currently 
available. They must identify which ones can be applied effectually to promote product 
customization, expedite new products to market, align supply chains, optimize inventory, 
foster team creativity and innovation, and enhance customer service. Presented in con-
siderable length is a comprehensive set of web-based tools (Chapter 12) related to product 
design, manufacturing, project management, procurement, plant operations, knowledge 
management, and supply chain management.
Globalization expands the perspectives of STEM professionals and leaders further with 
respect to divergence in culture, business practices, and value. Globalization is a major busi-
ness trend that will affect innumerable enterprises in the coming decades. STEM profes-
sionals and leaders must become sensitized to the issues involved and prepare themselves 
to help their companies in seizing the new business opportunities offered in the emerging 
global markets. They need to be aware of the potential effects of job migration caused by 
globalization and take steps to prepare themselves to meet such challenges. A major hurdle

for STEM professionals and leaders to overcome is to create global technical alliances in 
order to take advantage of new technological and business opportunities.
Engineering management will face external challenges in the new millennium. What 
these specific challenges are, how STEM professionals and leaders need to prepare to 
meet these challenges, and how to make optimal use of location-specific opportunities to 
create competitive advantages have been examined. Progressive companies change orga-
nizational structures, set up supply chains, expedite e-transformation, and implement 
advanced tools to serve customers better, cheaper, and faster.
Globalization is also expected to constantly evolve. The United Nations has predicted 
that, by the year 2020, three of the five biggest national economies will be located in Asia. 
There will certainly be winners and losers as businesses become more and more global. 
It is important for STEM professionals and future leaders to explore prudent corporate 
strategies for engineering enterprises in the pursuit of globalization, while minimizing 
any detrimental impact on the environment, protecting human rights and safeguarding 
proper labor conditions.
As graphically displayed in Figure 14.4, these twelve skill sets enable the formation of 
STEM professionals’ leadership. What is still required for STEM professionals and leaders 
to actively practice these knowledge sets in order to add value? When exercising leader-
ship, Zenger et al. (2002) suggest that close attention be paid to the following “Leadership” 
model:
L – Listening, leveraging own capabilities and strengths. Confucius said: “When 
walking with two other people, one of them could surely be my teacher.”
E – Empowering, entrusting people, and enthusiasm. Winston Churchill said: “Success 
consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.”
A – Action driven, attitudes, accountability, and ability to motivate others. David Starr 
Jordon said: “Wisdom is knowing what to do next, virtue is doing it.”
D – Determination, decisiveness in setting directions. Patty Hansen said, “You create 
your opportunities by asking for them.”
E – Energy, empathy, effectiveness and efficiency. Benjamin Franklin said, “Energy 
and persistence conquer all things.”
R – Rewarding, respecting, risk taking and reinventing self. Williams James said, “The 
deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”
S – Setting personal examples, servicing people, and showing vision. George Bernard 
Shaw said, “Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you 
desire, you will what you imagine and at last you create what you will.”
H – Honesty and honorable objectives. Henry Clay said, “Of all the properties which 
belong to an honorable man, not one is so highly priced as that of character.”
I – Innovative, integrity, interpersonal skills, and inspiring capabilities. Albert Einstein 
said: “Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what 
nobody had thought.”
P – Persistence, positive outlook, and proactive communications. Thomas Edison said: 
“Genius is 1% inspiration, 99 % perspiration.”
STEM professionals and leaders are expected to burnish their leadership credentials and 
bring their deep knowledge, experience, and wisdom to bear in helping to focus on the 

516
Engineering Management
main thing: achieving strategic differentiation and operational excellence through innova-
tion and technology.
As depicted in Figure 14.5, this book is intended to assist STEM professionals and lead-
ers in creating individual leadership pyramids that, when constantly nurtured and rein-
forced brick by brick, allow them to be recognized and remain visible as leaders for a long 
time to come.
How can STEM professionals and managers exercise their leadership roles to add value 
to the stakeholders of the company? The model depicted in Figure 14.6 illustrates a pos-
sibility. From left to right, engineering managers apply resources (as shown in the second 
column from the left), initiate specific processes (as shown in the third column from the 
left), create values (as shown in the fourth column from the left), and eventually benefit 
specific stakeholders (as shown in the right-hand column).

Engineering Management in the New Millennium
There are three specific resources that STEM professionals and managers may activate: 
product design, ERP and other web-based tools, emerging technologies, and vision and 
innovations. STEM professionals and managers utilize product design, ERP, and other 
web-based tools to manage global supply chains, strengthen products, effect the com-
pany’s e-transformation, achieve optimization of global resources, and supervise global 
projects and teams. They use emerging technologies to develop products, promote the 
e-transformation of the company, and achieve best practices with respect to the environ-
ment. They lead with vision and innovations to spearhead product design and devel-
opment, initiate e-transformation, optimize the use of global resources, manage global 
projects and teams, and create best practices with respect to the environment, ethics, and 
other community values.
The successful management of global supply chains leads to better, cheaper, and faster 
products and services and more effective collaboration with suppliers. The process of 
developing products and services with the help of web-based tools or other emerging 
technological aids leads to better, cheaper, and faster products and services, more effective 
collaboration with suppliers, and a stronger global competitive stance for the company. 
E-transformation of the company brings about swifter decision-making and a more robust 
global competitiveness. Optimization of global resources leads to stronger global com-
petitiveness, improved employee satisfaction, and enhanced innovations. Moreover, as the 
company follows best practices with respect to ethics and the environment, it projects a 
superior image of corporate citizenship to the public.
The creation of better, cheaper, and faster products and services adds value to customers. 
Improved collaboration with suppliers makes suppliers happy. Better and faster company 
decision-making pleases the shareholders. Stronger global competitiveness adds value to 
shareholders. Improved employee satisfaction and cutting-edge innovations add value to 
both shareholders and employees. Excellent corporate citizenship favors communities as 
well as the employees.
To confront the management challenges of the twenty-first century, STEM professionals 
and leaders need to manage from the inside as well as from the outside, to lead from the 
present to the future, and to act locally and think globally. Table 14.1 contains descriptions 
of these alternative viewpoints.
On the inside, STEM professionals and managers plan, organize, lead, and control to 
implement projects and programs. They manage people, technologies, and other resources 
to add value to their employers. They strengthen the company’s core competencies and 
come up with products with features that customers want. They effectively define (by ABC

and Monte Carlo simulations), monitor, and control costs. They appraise the company’s 
financial position and seize the right moments to initiate major projects with high tech-
nological content. These projects are supported by rigorous financial analyses in order to 
meet tough corporate evaluation criteria.
On the outside, STEM professionals and managers keep abreast of emerging technologies 
and screen new technologies that might affect the company’s products or services. They 
proactively identify and introduce web-based tools related to product design, project man-
agement, plant operations, facility maintenance, and knowledge management to improve 
the company’s current operations. They define best practices in the industry, emulate them 
as standards by which to evaluate their own in-house practices, and relentlessly strive to 
surpass these best practices. They look for potential supply chain partners whose alli-
ances could create competitive advantages for their employers in production, distribution, 
product customization, or after-sales service. They are sensitive to the constant need to 
improve the management of customer relationships. Through the use of web portals and 
other current technologies, they meet this need. They strive to add value to all stakehold-
ers—customers, employees, suppliers, investors, and the communities in which the com-
pany operates.
For the present, STEM professionals and managers focus on keeping the company 
smoothly operating by “doing things right.” They pay attention to details. They introduce 
a balanced scorecard to make sure that both financial and nonfinancial metrics are selected 
and deployed to monitor and evaluate the company’s performance. They attempt to con-
tinuously improve current company operations. They take care of assignments (e.g., cost 
control and waste elimination) that should be accomplished for the company to achieve 
business success in the short term.
For the future, STEM professionals and managers seek e-transformation opportunities 
to create corporate competencies in the long term. These are profit-producing opportuni-
ties that may be created by significantly enhancing the value of the company’s products 
to customers through, for example, distribution, price, service, features, and ordering pro-
cesses. STEM professionals and managers develop and introduce new products in a timely 
manner to ensure sustainable profitability for the company in the future. They envisage 
a vision for the future, contribute to new company strategies related to technology, and 
assist company management in defining “the right things to do.”
At the local level, STEM professionals and managers seek to best utilize the resources 
available (e.g., people, technology, and business relationships) to achieve the company’s 
objectives. They adjust to local conditions and take lawful, ethical, and proper actions to 
discharge their daily responsibilities. They maintain their local networks of professional 
talents and business relationships to improve the company’s productivity. They commu-
nicate their experience and preserve lessons learned so that others at different sites within 
the company may benefit.
At the global level, STEM professionals and managers are sensitive in their pursuit of the 
optimal use of location-based resources to realize global economies of scale and scope and 
to derive both cost and technology advantages for their employers. They create global net-
works of professional talents and business relationships and exploit innovative business 
opportunities. As companies pursue globalization over time, these professionals acquire a 
global mind-set, become globally business savvy, and ready themselves to exercise leader-
ship roles in international settings.
These six-dimensional challenges are indeed interrelated, as illustrated in Figure 14.7. 
Because many companies are affected by the rapid advancement of technology and 
the fast-paced advancement of globalization, the new millennium both creates ample 

519
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
opportunities for, and poses new challenges to, engineers and engineering managers 
(Kouzes and Posner 2012; Drucker 2014; Deep and Sussman 2000; Palus and Horth 2001; 
Jacobson 2000). Those STEM professionals and managers who capture these new opportu-
nities and meet these new challenges will be rewarded.
Example 14.5
In the new millennium, innovative ideas, rather than physical assets, will enable com-
panies to compete effectively in a global-knowledge economy. Usually, innovative ideas 
come from knowledge workers who are typically inventive, independent, and mobile. 
No single company is capable of “chaining” down these workers, as they are happy to 
be there, but ready to move on at any time.
It is likely to be a major challenge for STEM professionals and managers to foster 
innovation on a continuing basis in such an environment. What might be a good strat-
egy for STEM professionals and managers to adopt in order to secure a constant flow 
of innovations that are potent enough to sustain the relative competitiveness of their 
enterprises?
Answer 14.5
During the last century, a number of well-known companies (IBM, AT&T, Dupont, GE, 
Merck, and others) achieved remarkable business success by emphasizing R&D in-
house and innovation on the inside. They proudly advertised the number of U.S. pat-
ents they received per year as an indication of their inventive power. They kept a large 
number of experts on their payroll to foster innovations. Many of these giants have 
since left their historical mission of inventive discovery. Some have also abandoned the 
past practice of not sharing with others those inventions that did not fit their respective 
corporate strategies at the time.
Companies in the knowledge economy have implemented a flexible technology strategy 
with great success. Known examples include Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, and Pfizer. Because 
skilled workers are mobile, companies can no longer count on in-depth development of 
innovations on the inside. In order to secure a constant inflow of creative ideas, they pursue 
open innovations (e.g., by acquisition, joint venture, or contract research) deemed useful to 
foster their corporate objectives. The emphasis has been shifted from in-depth innovation 
within a discipline to innovation with breadth and integration across disciplines.

P&G is known to be an aggressive acquirer of creative ideas from the outside. In 2001, 
10% of P&G products came from outside sources, and this percentage is expected to have 
risen to 50% by 2006. P&G has also decided to make a patented technology available to out-
siders, including competitors, if it is not used by at least one internal business unit within 
three years (Chesbrough et al. 2014; Griffin et.al. 2014).
To meet the new challenge of creating a constant flow of creative ideas, STEM profes-
sionals and managers must scan promising innovations on the outside (e.g., universities, 
start-ups, competitors, and others) and integrate them for profitable internal applications. 
Any inside innovations that do not conform to the corporate objectives are to be aggres-
sively marketed to outside companies to generate licensing revenues.
Example 14.6
Forecasting future market conditions and technologies is a difficult, but necessary, skill 
for companies striving to sustain business success. Looking out for emerging technolo-
gies should be the primary role of STEM professionals and leaders.
What might be a good strategy for engineering and technology managers to become 
sensitized to forecasting technology and scanning emerging technologies so that they 
fulfill their important role as technology “gatekeepers”?
Answer 14.6
Different engineering and technology managers will have different preferences in ful-
filling this important role of forecasting. One possibility is to adopt the following logical 
sequence of steps:
	
1.	 Compose a “wish list” of technologies that would make the company’s cur-
rent products cheaper, faster, and better. Define desirable new product features 
based on customer inputs and the technologies required for their development. 
Determine new product concepts and the requisite technologies that might be 
compatible with the current product lines marketed by the company.
	
2.	 Understand some of the emerging technologies noted in the literature (e.g., see 
Table 2.2).
	
3.	 Identify the useful technologies that might be available during the next 
5–10 years to support the current products, product enrichments, or new prod-
uct concepts.
	
4.	 Assess the development activities associated with these useful technologies in 
universities, start-ups, technology incubator firms, contract research compa-
nies, or other organizations, both domestic and global, to gauge their quality 
and readiness for commercialization.
	
5.	 Make specific recommendations in a timely manner to secure the supply of 
such new technologies for enhancing the commercial success of the company’s 
products.
Example 14.7
“Think globally and act locally” has been the general guideline offered to managers at 
the headquarters of global companies that seek to achieve success in the global markets. 
The logic is rather compelling.
For those STEM professionals and managers of global companies that operate in local 
regions or markets, perhaps the guideline should be “Think locally and act globally.” 
What is your opinion on these guidelines?

521
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
Answer 14.7
The principal objective of requiring headquarters managers of global companies to 
“think globally and act locally” is to make sure that the company’s products and ser-
vices are sufficiently adjusted to the needs of local markets, while enjoying the econo-
mies of scale advantages of being global.
Numerous local managers of global companies have created innovative strategies 
and achieved remarkable success, based on their understanding of the culture and 
customs in local markets. Oftentimes, the same insight and innovative strategies need 
only be applied to other regions, with only minor modifications, for the headquarters 
managers of the global companies to realize the economies-of-scope advantages on a 
global basis.
Das (1993) spoke in favor of the concept of “thinking locally and acting globally,” as a 
result of his personal experience as a local manager of P&G in India. It is indeed true that 
for local managers, they need a different reference, compared with their counterpart at the 
company’s headquarters, to be effective in making valid contributions.
14.9  Conclusions
This chapter summarizes the foundational skills and capabilities that all STEM profes-
sionals should possess.
In addition, there are 12 groups of skills and knowledge they ought to master, as graphi-
cally represented by the Three-Decker Knowledge Architecture. STEM professionals are 
advised to become versed in these skills and capabilities by self-study or through learning 
opportunities sponsored by their enterprises.
For STEM professionals to make valuable contributions toward creating strategic dif-
ferentiation and operational excellence for their enterprises, they are encouraged to do the 
following:
	
1.	Practice the DeepThink methodologies (see Appendices 10.A and 10.B in 
Chapter 10), or other idea generation techniques, to become proficient in generat-
ing creative ideas and offering novel solutions, on a continuous basis, to problems 
or issues of importance to their enterprise.
	
2.	Seek opportunities to implement the best-practice methods available in industries 
to upgrade all in-house work processes and organize teams to improve the pro-
ductivity and efficiency of increasingly complex processes.
The ability of an enterprise to shape outcomes, such as pursuing its important goals of 
creating strategic differentiation and operational excellence in order to satisfy the expecta-
tions of all of its stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, investors, suppliers, and com-
munity), rests entirely on the shoulders of its employees.
Industrial sectors are growing worldwide, and they assume increasingly dominant roles 
in all developed and developing economies, thus offering high-growth job opportunities 
to those who are properly prepared. In order to become top employees in any enterprise, 
STEM professionals and leaders need to take charge and exercise their leadership roles in

meeting the challenges of the future. In this respect, the following “Take Charge” model 
may be useful as a guide:
T: Take some risks by trying out novel ideas or projects, which may benefit from some 
testing and experimentation.
A: Apply best practices, proven productivity tools, and emerging technologies cur-
rently in development to enhance operational excellence.
K: Know what is yet to be learned (any part of the domains as illustrated in the Three-
Decker Knowledge Architecture framework, new techniques to pursue open 
innovation, and new customer demands in the marketplace) to become prepared 
for making valuable contributions.
E: Exercise leadership in conjunction with innovation development, team building, 
staff selection and training, and the management of projects, programs, supply 
chain, and other activities, especially those facing the customers.
C: Customize product/service offerings to the specific needs of customers in order to 
enhance the value to them.
H: Harness corporate insights by managing and reusing the corporate knowledge 
base to produce visions for the future.
A: Acquire the skills, mind-set, and attitude to work well with customers and people 
at all levels within the enterprise, as well as a set of good habits of thinking inno-
vatively and productively.
R: Ready the enterprise and self for meeting the six-dimensional challenges.
G: Generate new product/service ideas by being proficient in invoking DeepThink or 
other idea-creating methods to promote strategic differentiation.
E: Evaluate new global opportunities and offer creative initiatives.
STEM professionals and leaders are advised to take charge by acquiring the knowledge 
and skills indicated here, applying them to achieve strategic differentiation and opera-
tional excellence for their employers, taking charge to strengthen the short-term perfor-
mance and long-term health of their enterprises, and satisfying the expectations of all their 
enterprises’ stakeholders.
QUESTIONS
	
1.	Sustainable development refers to work that simultaneously satisfies economic, 
social, and environmental requirements (United Nations 2002). It is self-evident 
that work must be economically viable so that customers are willing to pay 
for the work supplied. Work must also be safe and otherwise socially compat-
ible. Furthermore, work needs to be environmentally acceptable in that harm-
ful discharges are minimized, wastes are decreased, material and energy 
resources are conserved, and any other detrimental impact on the environment 
is minimized.
	
	
Some academics suggest that it is the engineer’s responsibility to attain the ide-
als of sustainable development. They view it as the major challenge facing engi-
neers in the future (Cruickshank 2003). Do you agree with this notion? Why or 
why not?

523
Engineering Management in the New Millennium
	
2.	Leading technological innovation will be a major challenge for engineering man-
agers in the new millennium. What are some of the success factors for technologi-
cal innovation?
	
3.	The new millennium is expected to see continued changes in communications 
technologies, business practices, worker diversity, customer empowerment, and 
marketplace conditions. Name a few leadership qualities that are deemed essen-
tial for engineering managers to achieve success in the new millennium.
	
4.	U.S. productivity has improved noticeably in recent years, averaging 4%–5% per 
year, while the U.S. economy grew by only 3.5%. The gain in productivity was due, 
in large part, to the use of technology, in addition to longer working hours by those 
who are lucky enough to have jobs. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the 
average U.S. worker has added 199 hours to a year since 1973. The United States 
achieved per hour productivity of $32, compared with $38 for Norway, and $34 for 
Belgium. In other words, U.S. workers are simply working longer, not necessarily 
better or smarter. They take less annual vacation time (only 10.2 days, on average), 
compared with 30 days in France and in Germany.
	
	
At the same time, a large number of U.S. companies are aggressively outsourc-
ing work to low-wage countries, such as China, India, the Philippines, and Mexico. 
A 2003 study released by the University of California at Berkeley indicates that as 
many as 14 million U.S. service jobs are in danger of being shipped overseas.
	
	
Who is responsible for this peculiar position that U.S. workers are being forced 
into? How can U.S. companies meet the new challenge of improving the quality of 
life for their workers, without sacrificing the companies’ relative competitiveness 
in the marketplace?
	
5.	In the new millennium, speed to market will be a major harbinger of competitive-
ness. “The early bird gets the worm,” as the saying goes. How can engineering 
managers meet this challenge by leading their companies to be the first movers?

Appendix: Selected Engineering 
Management and Business Cases
The case method is well established and widely practiced in management schools. Science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals and managers are advised to 
consult a recent publication regarding the advantages of learning from cases (Source: 
Wambaugh, Eugene (2015), The Study of Cases: A Course of Instruction in Reading and Studying 
Reported Cases, Composing Head-Notes and Briefs, Forgotten Books.)
Samples of engineering and business management cases are selected to assist STEM pro-
fessionals and managers in gaining management and business perspectives. These cases, 
illustrating the complex engineering and management issues involved, may be studied to 
augment the topics covered in this book. The author has used all of them over a period of 
time with success. STEM professionals and managers are strongly encouraged to study 
these and other cases to derive useful lessons from them.
Class surveys indicate that engineering students generally like case discussions, as they 
enhance critical thinking and stimulate active participation. They like the fact that well-
organized case studies are the next-best avenues, besides working in the right industrial 
settings, for them to acquire useful experience in dealing with real-world management 
issues. They understand also that the principle of “more in and more out” applies here, in 
that the more effort they put in to preparing themselves for the case discussions in class, 
the more valuable insights they will get out of the cases discussed.
It is generally advisable to specify a list of questions for each case ahead of time for stu-
dents to focus their preparation on. It is equally important to ensure that the discussions 
are not dominated by a few students in the class, that most students are encouraged to 
speak up, and that the discussions are driven by thought-provoking questions. Each case 
takes, on average, the class time of about 60–90 min. Usually, students like the instructor to 
give them a written case summary that captures the salient points of the case discussion. 
Past experience indicates that asking students to summarize in writing what lessons they 
have learned from each case, without reiterating the case details, helps them to internalize 
the “take-away” messages.
STEM professionals and managers may purchase case materials from the publisher, 
Harvard Business School Publishing Company (http://www.hbsp.harvard.edu). Any aca-
demic educator may register at the same website of Harvard Business Online for Educators 
free of charge. Once registered, the educator may download a free copy of any of these 
cases for evaluation purposes. To use these cases in class, students need to purchase the 
original copies, possibly at an academic discount price. For information regarding order 
processing, contact 1-800-545-7685 or www.hbsp.harvard.edu.
Twenty-one cases are included here (see Table A.1). Three of these cases (Nos. 8, 13, and 15) 
are Harvard Business School’s best-selling cases. Table A.1 groups the cases according to 
the main subjects covered in this book.
The set of cases listed in Table  A.1 covers technology products (both industrial and 
consumer) of large and small firms engaged in domestic and international businesses. The 
cases outlined in Table A.2 address various engineering management issues discussed in 
this book. Table A.2 relates these cases to the chapters involved.
