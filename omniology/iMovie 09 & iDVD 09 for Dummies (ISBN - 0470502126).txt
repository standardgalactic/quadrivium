Authors’ Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Apple for providing me with yet another reason to be glad 
that I use Macs. iLife ’09 makes my life easier because it’s so easy to use and 
works so well that I get far fewer tech support calls from family and friends than 
I used to. Additional thanks go to our editors on this title — Kyle Looper, Linda 
Morris, and Greg Willmore — and our agent, Carole Jelen, for lining up this gig.
— Dennis Cohen
I second Dennis’s thanks to Apple, Kyle, Linda, Greg, and Carole, and offer 
additional thanks to Bruce Kijewski for a timely hardware assist.

iMovie ‘09 & iDVD ‘09 For Dummies 

Introduction
A
pple pioneered so many things we now take for granted in personal 
computing. Among these innovations are the menu-driven, graphical 
user interface (yes, we know they didn’t invent it, but Apple pioneered it for 
the masses) and the digital video application genre. The latter, implemented 
as iMovie and iDVD, are the subjects of this tome.
For those of you who are used to versions of iMovie prior to iMovie ’08, 
iMovie ’09 is going to be a new experience for you. iMovie ’08 was all-new 
from the ground up and iMovie ’09 builds on that by adding a lot of new 
functionality.
iMovie and iDVD are just two of the five applications that comprise the iLife 
application suite as shipped. (iTunes is considered a part of iLife, but is a free 
download and not included on the DVD.) The other applications are iPhoto, 
GarageBand, and iWeb. Although more people probably work with iPhoto 
than iMovie or iDVD, we think that digital video is the most fun, and iMovie 
and iDVD empower you to have that fun.
About This Book
First things first, even though this book has For Dummies in its title, we don’t 
think of you as dummies. After all, you were intelligent enough to want to 
learn about iMovie and iDVD, and you came to us to help you find what you 
seek. We think that’s pretty darn smart! The rationale for the For Dummies 
line of books is to present a comfortable environment for you to find out 
about subjects that interest you but about which you may not know much at 
the outset.
Apple doesn’t provide a manual for the applications in their iLife suite. In 
fact, the closest thing to documentation in the package is a terse pamphlet 
that is more advertising than guidance. Apple does offer the obligatory col-
lection of online Help, however, and it covers various aspects of iMovie 
and iDVD quite well, but you have to know what questions to ask and how 
to ask them if you want to find the right information. Further, Apple hasn’t 
answered a lot of the questions about these applications that we get asked 
all the time. Therefore, we’ve built this book around the things you need to 
know and answers to the questions we hear people ask.

2
iMovie ’09 & iDVD ’09 For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
We make frequent use of bullet lists, numbered steps, and screenshots to 
facilitate your learning because experience has taught us that step-by-step 
instructions help and that pictures are often worth at least a thousand words.
Web addresses (URLs) are presented in a special monospace font (for exam-
ple, www.apple.com). Menu selections appear like this: File➪Import➪iMovie 
HD Project. This tells you to select the File menu, and then, from the sub-
menu that appears, choose Import, and then finally to select iMovie HD 
Project from the next submenu that appears.
Icons Used in This Book
Various paragraphs are set off with special icons, as follows:
 
Advice or information that should help you work more efficiently.
 
Cautionary information to help you avoid pitfalls.
 
Somewhat nerdy information that you don’t really have to know, but that is 
either interesting background or helpful to your understanding.
 
Information that you should really keep in mind because it comes up often.
How This Book Is Organized
Unlike a novel or a textbook where each chapter builds on that which came 
before, this book is quite a bit less linear in its approach. You can skip 
around, completely avoiding sections that don’t apply to what you’re trying 
to do. For example, if you’re assembling pre-existing footage to make a movie, 
you won’t need to know how to import from a camcorder, and if you aren’t 

3
 Introduction
using high-definition (1080i) content, you can skip sections describing how to 
work with 1080i material. If, at some later date, you undertake a project that 
requires 1080i, just go back and peruse the information at that time.
Although you can skip around, a front-to-back reading might be appropriate 
for traditionalists or for those who just want to make sure that they get all 
the info that they can. Because some of you crave that start-to-finish cover-
age, we organized the book to facilitate the linear approach as well, grouping 
similar subjects as follows.
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started
In these early chapters, we give you a little history, introduce the iMovie and 
iDVD workspaces, provide advice on how to prepare for shooting a movie, 
and show you how to get your footage into iMovie, manage the iMovie Event 
Library and Events, and work with clips.
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut
This is where we really get down to the business of iMovie — creating proj-
ects, manipulating clips, working with still images, and working with iMovie 
Themes.
Part III: In the Cutting Room
In these chapters, we cover how to enhance your video; add titles, transitions 
and effects; perform precision editing such as combining separate audio and 
video tracks; work with audio; and add chapter markers for use in iDVD. 
Part IV: Production and Distribution
In this Part, we cover how to share your video product with others, either 
through Web sites such as YouTube or MobileMe, or via DVD. In the last four 
chapters of this Part, we tell you more than you probably want to know about 
how to design and create DVDs with iDVD.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The two chapters in this part are a For Dummies tradition. We introduce ten 
software and hardware products that can enhance your digital video experi-
ence and provide ten tips for troubleshooting common problems.

iMovie ’09 & iDVD ’09 For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
We think that Chapter 1 is a good place for just about everyone to start. After 
that, follow along until you hit a topic that isn’t germane to your intended 
use, at which point you can either continue for the sake of completeness 
or skip to the next relevant heading. Alternatively, if you like the jump cut 
approach, just skip around to topics of interest.
Because we want to make this book as useful as possible, please let us know 
what you think we did well or where you would like to see additional informa-
tion. We might not be able to incorporate all suggestions in future editions 
(we have book length constraints, after all), but we like to deal with what we 
can in print or, where appropriate, follow up on the Web.

Part I
Pre-Production 
and Getting 
Started

In this part . . .
I
n these four chapters, we cover the following topics:
 
✓ Chapter 1 introduces you to the user interface you 
encounter when you start using iMovie and iDVD and 
the basics of how the programs work. It also gives you 
some history, telling how the programs reached their 
current forms.
 
✓ Chapter 2 provides guidance on how to plan your 
movie and how to shoot the best footage you can. It 
then walks you through getting your video into iMovie.
 
✓ Chapter 3 explores using iMovie’s Event Library for 
organizing your video clips and working with Events.
 
✓ Chapter 4 introduces iMovie tools that help you sort 
through your Event Library, mark the footage you 
want to use, and eliminate video segments that just 
don’t measure up to your standards.

Movie and iDVD, parts of the iLife ’09 suite (which includes iTunes, iPhoto, 
iMovie, iDVD, GarageBand, and iWeb), form the digital video spoke of 
Apple’s so-called “Digital Hub.” iLife is bundled with new Macintosh comput-
ers and available separately for a $79 list price. iDVD is unchanged from the 
very mature version shipped in iLife ’08 (other than a couple of minor 
updates). iMovie, on the other hand, has dozens of new fea-
tures, a few of which are the new Precision Editor; chapter, 
comment, and beat markers; and themes.
This chapter details the steps along the way that 
brought iMovie and iDVD to their current incarna-
tions. You also get a brief tour of the iMovie and 
iDVD Workspaces. Additionally, we cover topics 
you should keep in mind when planning and creat-
ing your movies so that you can achieve the best 
end result.
Getting to iLife ‘09
In 1999, Apple introduced the iMac DV (Digital Video), the 
first consumer computer to come with a FireWire port as 
standard equipment. To demonstrate FireWire’s speed and capability, 
the iMac DV included a new application named iMovie. iMovie was a 
groundbreaking introduction of home video editing to the masses (or, as 
Apple prefers to say, “the rest of us”), geared to use the early generation of

Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
MiniDV-tape based camcorders from companies like Sony, Canon, and JVC. 
All of these companies agreed on FireWire as the standard protocol for trans-
ferring video (although it was sometimes called something else, like iLink 
or IEEE-1394). And iMovie was easy to use, far more so than professional 
packages like Apple’s Final Cut or Adobe’s Premiere.
Apple improved and enhanced iMovie through six versions, the last two of 
which included HD (for High Definition) as part of their name. However, 
although it was still easier to use than the competition, iMovie gained com-
plexity along with its new capabilities and was still based on code that 
was originally written for pre-OS X Macs. Then, in late 2007, with the release 
of iLife ’08, a new version of iMovie was introduced. Old-timers like us 
recognized that the new iMovie made getting started a lot easier and that it 
fit into the OS X mold more comfortably than its predecessors, but we also 
noticed that a lot of functionality was either missing or, in a few cases, 
relocated to GarageBand, the audio editing application in the iLife’09 suite. 
Apple recognized that many of their existing users would be dissatisfied with 
the new iMovie, just as new users would be enthused by how easy it was to 
use, so Apple made iMovieHD available to iLife ’08 owners as a free down-
load. The iMovie in iLife ’09 is a vast improvement on the previous release 
and an alternative is no longer necessary nor provided.
Similarly, Apple introduced iDVD at the January 2001 Macworld Expo, 
providing a tool that enabled purchasers of Macs with the new SuperDrives — 
the first DVD burners priced for the consumer market (from Pioneer) — to 
produce their own DVDs. The iDVD in iLife ’09 is, to all intents and purposes, 
the same iDVD that shipped as part of iLife ’08. The only changes are 
compatibility updates for the other applications in iLife ’09.
 
Henceforth in this book, we refer to the current software as iLife, iMovie, 
iDVD, GarageBand, iPhoto, and so on, and include a version number only if 
we find it necessary to discuss an earlier software iteration.
Knowing What Goes into Making a Movie
Just about any movie that anyone would be willing to watch requires some 
planning, organization, and editing. Assuming that the content is coming 
from a camcorder, planning includes being sure to start filming a few seconds 
before the desired scene to avoid missing the first frame and letting the 
camera run a few seconds after the end of scene so as not to prematurely end 
the scene. One of the great things about digital editing in iMovie is how easy 
it is to trim the footage so that you can start and end each scene with exactly 
the frames you want.

9
 Chapter 1: Making and Sharing Movies
Organization includes having your camera and microphone, if you have an 
external microphone, positioned to catch the scene to the best advantage. In 
other words, your scene needs to be properly lit with the audio pickup where 
you’ll catch and immortalize any dialogue. (We could show you a wedding 
video where the camcorder was behind the groom by about 15 feet and his 
vows didn’t come through.) In fact, when you can arrange to do so, have 
multiple cameras recording from different angles. iMovie makes it easy to 
splice in both audio and video, and having multiple sources not only means 
that you’re far less likely to miss something, but that you can use the best 
audio while cutting from one camera angle to another to best present your 
scene. That’s why professional videographers use multiple cameras, too. 
Other organizational items include making sure that you have adequate 
batteries or available power, sufficient media (be it tape, flash memory, 
MiniDVDs, or available hard drive space), and satisfactory lighting. And, if 
your movie is scripted, you need to make sure that everyone knows what 
they’re supposed to do and say as well as where they’re supposed to be 
while giving their performance.
The editing, well, that’s just what we’re going to cover in subsequent chap-
ters, mostly in Chapters 5 and 6. iMovie lets you do easily almost anything 
that a professional editor does, without all of the hard work and training.
Of formats and frame rates
Historically there have been, basically, two 
broadcast standards: NTSC and PAL. Minor 
variations existed, but NTSC and PAL have been 
the name of the game outside of France, which 
still employs a standard called SECAM that was 
common in Eastern Europe before the fall of the 
Iron Curtain, when the formerly Communist 
nations switched to PAL. NTSC is the standard 
in North and Central America, most South 
American countries, Japan, the Philippines, and 
a number of Asian and Pacific Island countries, 
whereas some variety of PAL is the standard 
almost everywhere else (except, as mentioned, 
France). The two major differences between the 
NTSC and PAL formats are the frame rate — 
how many frames of video make up a second of 
footage — and frame size — the number of 
video scan lines in a frame. NTSC uses 30 fps 
(frames per second) — really 29.97, but most of 
the literature rounds this off — and PAL uses 25 
fps. Similarly, NTSC has 525 scan lines and PAL 
has 625, some of which are unused. If you’re 
curious about the nitty-gritty details, the math, 
and the exceptions, we recommend that you 
start by searching the Web for more info on 
NTSC and PAL. While you’re Googling, check 
out some info on ATSC (the format for digital 
television that supports HDTV) to see how the 
“digital transition” has simplified many items 
while introducing its own new technical details 
to confuse the typical TV viewer.

Understanding the Movie-Making Process
Oversimplifying the subject tremendously, movies fall into one of two catego-
ries: documentaries or scripted. Documentaries include not just the polished 
product of collecting and narrating historic footage, but efforts as unpolished 
as the traditional home movie, where you just throw the camera up and 
grab footage of some unplanned event, such as baby’s first steps, animals 
frolicking, or the first time your child succeeds in riding his two-wheeler. 
Scripted movies range from recording planned scenes such as class lectures 
to elaborately scripted vehicles that include not only prepared dialogue but 
elaborate stage direction.
Television tends to blur traditional categorization, referring to the current 
plethora of “reality” shows as unscripted; however, they fall more into the 
scripted category than not, with prepared venues and planned activities. 
The shows lack only the precise details of a traditional scripted show, just as 
a variety show or a talk show leaves a lot of room for improvisation although 
it’s still a planned show. The stunts or routines in a show like Survivor or 
Dancing with the Stars are planned and scripted, but how well they’re exe-
cuted varies, just as the host of a talk show has a prepared list of questions 
(or script), but doesn’t always know how the guest is going to respond.
Just because most home movies are basically documentary, immortalizing 
events and activities, doesn’t mean you can’t put a little structure into 
the process. iMovie (and its companion, iPhoto) help you by grouping 
footage and images into events — content organized initially by time, but 
customizable by you. We discuss events in more detail in Chapter 3.
Entire books are dedicated to the art and science of film-making. If you’re 
interested, a good starting point is Filmmaking For Dummies (Bryan Michael 
Stoller, Wiley Publishing).
Figuring Out What’s Where in iMovie
 
 The first time you launch iMovie (by clicking its icon in the Dock — a five-
pointed star with a circled video camera in the center, as shown in the 
margin), you encounter a screen that looks like Figure 1-1. Some minor details 
in the menu bar and Dock may differ depending on your screen size and what 
software you have installed, but the iMovie window and the Welcome to 
iMovie dialog will be the same.
Apple realizes that you probably won’t want to see the Welcome dialog every 
time you launch iMovie, so they include a check box in the lower-left corner 
that you can deselect after you’ve taken advantage of the information it offers 
(or decide that you don’t want to investigate). You won’t see it again unless 

11
 Chapter 1: Making and Sharing Movies
you choose Help➪Welcome to iMovie. The tutorials are useful and exhibit 
the quality and attention to detail that we’ve come to expect from Apple — 
we heartily recommend them as an adjunct to this book.
After you’ve dismissed the Welcome dialog, you’re left with iMovie’s main 
window, which Apple refers to as the Workspace (see Figure 1-2). This is 
the Workspace’s default configuration. You can, up to a point, change which 
panes are shown and in what positions via iMovie’s preference settings 
(iMovie➪Preferences, or Ô+, (comma)), items in the View menu, and items 
in the Window menu. By default, you see the Project Library pane in the 
upper left, the Viewer pane in the upper right, and the Event Library in the 
lower half. The Event Library is split into a hierarchical view on the left and a 
browser view on the right, displaying the clips in any selected event, with a 
horizontal toolbar in the middle of the Workspace and a control bar for the 
Event Library along the bottom of the window.
 
Although we laud Apple’s user interface consistency, every once in a while, 
even they slip up, and we think this is one of those situations. The Project 
Library has similar controls to the Event Library, and it is clear that the 
controls “belong” to the Project Library by their appearance. The controls 
for the Event Library don’t match in the same way, appearing as part of the 
window frame. But, if you click the toolbar button to swap the Project and 
Events areas, the controls swap appearance as well. It just goes to show you 
that nobody’s perfectly consistent.

If you have movie clips in your iPhoto Library, iMovie asks you whether you 
want thumbnails created for use in your Event Library now or whether you 
wish to wait and perform the processing later, as shown in Figure 1-3. This 
activity takes place because a lot of still cameras are capable of recording 
video and iPhoto imports those videos into the iPhoto Library. As we discuss 
in Chapter 2, iMovie works with content from a variety of sources, including 
iPhoto.

13
 Chapter 1: Making and Sharing Movies

In this example, we told iMovie to process the iPhoto videos so that we have 
some content in our Event Library to illustrate the rest of this discussion. 
That’s why the Event Library sports an iPhoto Videos item in the following 
screenshots, an item that wasn’t present in Figure 1-2.
Exploring the Event Library
As shown in Figure 1-4, we selected iPhoto Videos in the Event Library list 
on the left and its four clips appear to the right. The number of thumbnails, 
and thus the apparent clip length, is controlled by the duration slider at the 
bottom-right of the window — the duration selected determines how many 
thumbnails are shown. In our example, the duration is set for 5 seconds, so 
clips shorter than 5 seconds in length are one thumbnail wide, between 5 and 
10 seconds are two thumbnails wide, and if we had a longer clip of between 
10 and 15 seconds, it would be three wide, and so on. You can modify this 
granularity by moving the duration slider. When you hover the cursor over a 
clip, its duration appears at the left, just above an action drop-down menu 
(the little gear icon with the down-pointing arrowhead to its right), and a red 
positional indicator line follows your scrubbing action (the movement, back 
and forth, through the clip) while the particular frames play in the Viewer.
Along the control bar at the bottom of the window, the left-most button 
controls whether the Events list is showing or hidden: if the Events list is 
present, the little arrowhead points to the left, indicating that you can 
click to hide the Events list (slide it out of view to the left). If the Events list is 
hidden, the arrowhead is on the right, indicating that you can bring the 
Events list back into view. The next button to the right, when clicked, puts 
you in full-screen mode. The menu bar, Dock, and all your windows disap-
pear, as shown in Figure 1-5. When you first enter full-screen mode, only the 
viewer area is visible, but if you move your cursor to the bottom of the 
screen, the controls appear. Pressing the spacebar toggles between playing 
and pausing whatever is being viewed. You can also play events full-screen 
by choosing Window➪Show Events Full-Screen (Ô+7).

 Chapter 1: Making and Sharing Movies
If you have the controls showing in full-screen mode, you can scrub across 
the thumbnails to determine what’s visible in the viewer. Clicking the circled 
X at the bottom left of the screen exits full-screen mode, but if you don’t 
want to have to show the controls, you can also exit full-screen mode by 
pressing Esc.
The Show pop-up menu (refer to Figure 1-4) lets you control which clips are 
shown in the Event pane: Favorites only, Favorites and Unmarked (Ô+L), All 
Clips, or Rejected Clips. We cover rejecting clips and marking favorites in 
Chapter 4.
Deciding on a Distribution Plan
Modern technology has significantly expanded how and where we can share 
our video products. It wasn’t all that long ago that camcorders were bulky 
things that recorded on VHS, Beta, or VHS-C video cassettes, and distribution 
was pretty much limited to duplicating tapes and handing or sending out 
copies. Besides the enormous inconvenience, copying tape was a lossy 
proposition (meaning quality was lost), both from duplicating analog data 
and the fact that tape was flexible, stretched with repeated use, and was 
magnetic, making it susceptible to electromagnetic interference.
DVDs and their predecessors, VideoCDs (VCD) and Super VideoCDs (SVCD), 
eliminated the generational degradation inherent in the analog copying 
process by moving to digital technology.
 
That quality loss is avoided only when you’re creating a duplicate, not when 
you’re re-encoding to a different format, a process known as transcoding. All 
standard distribution formats, such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and DivX 
(or Xvid) employ lossy data compression to keep the size of your video 
manageable, just as JPEG compresses images and MP3 and AAC compress 
audio in a manner that throws away some (hopefully) unimportant bits.
In addition to DVDs, we now have iPods, iPhones, Web pages, YouTube, and 
a myriad of other distribution venues for our content. iMovie, with the help 
of QuickTime, lets you choose which output format or formats you desire. 
You can create a movie optimized for iPod viewing, create a copy targeted to 
Apple TV, and then instruct iMovie to send the content off to iDVD. It’s up 
to you to decide how you want your movies distributed, and we give you a 
helping hand with the details in Chapter 12 and give extensive coverage to 
iDVD in Part IV.

16
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
Checking Out iDVD
 
 Although we now have many different venues and methods for sharing our 
videos, we’re still particularly partial to the DVD. Almost everyone we know, 
and certainly everyone we know with whom we want to share content, has a 
DVD player. Not everyone we know has an Internet connection, particularly 
the broadband variety that is a virtual necessity for accessing viewable video 
over the ether. Although Apple didn’t enhance iDVD’s feature set in iLife ’09, 
they did revise iDVD for compatibility with the other iLife applications and 
included iDVD as one of the six iLife components. This is apparently an 
acknowledgement on Apple’s part that, although they consider DVD an old 
technology that is going to be made obsolete by online and high-definition 
offerings, it is still a dominant distribution venue at this time.
The Select a Task window
When you first launch iDVD, you see the window shown in Figure 1-6. Along 
the window’s bottom, you find a Help button (question mark), a button that 
launches your Web browser and takes you to Apple’s Web site and the page 
with the iDVD tutorials (Video Tutorials), and a Quit button. The tutorials 
don’t teach you anything that isn’t in this book, but they are presented as 
video, so if watching a video helps you learn, the tutorials are a helpful 
adjunct to what you’re holding.

 Chapter 1: Making and Sharing Movies
The Create a New Project button does just what the name suggests. Click it 
and you’re presented with the Create Project dialog shown in Figure 1-7, 
where you name your project in the Save As text box, specify where the 
project should be saved in the Where pop-up menu (or click the down-
pointing arrow to the right of the Save As text box and navigate in the 
expanded Save dialog to another location), and click the radio button that 
tells iDVD whether the project is going to have a 4:3 aspect ratio (Standard) 
or 16:9 (Widescreen). The Open an Existing Project button also is self-
descriptive, presenting you with an Open dialog that enables you to select an 
existing project with which you wish to work. Use Magic DVD to quickly 
assemble a DVD from a collection of existing videos and photos — just drag 
and drop the media into iDVD, and Magic DVD does the rest. OneStep DVD 
lets you import video directly from your camera or a movie and put it on 
DVD. OneStep DVD is an excellent way to make a quick DVD of video you 
don’t intend to edit. OneStep DVD and Magic DVD are covered in Chapter 13. 
Now, we’re just going to briefly introduce the iDVD Workspace you see when 
you create a new project or open an existing project.

Themes, Buttons, and the Media Browser
When you click Create, the dialog disappears and you’ll see a progress dialog 
while iDVD loads the Themes, and so on, before you arrive at the main 
project window, shown in Figure 1-8. The leftmost pane displays the menu on 
which you’re currently working — initially, it shows the main menu for the 
selected Theme. The pane to the right displays available Themes, Buttons, or 
the Media Browser, depending upon which of the three buttons below the 
pane you’ve clicked.
Themes includes a pop-up menu where you choose from which set of themes 
you want to make your selection: All, those that appeared with iDVD 7, those 
debuting in iDVD 6, those introduced in iDVD 5, those from older versions 
of iDVD, or those you specify as Favorites. Themes have the same purpose 
as templates in a word-processing or graphics program. You select a theme 
to provide your DVD with a consistent design, employing professionally 
designed backgrounds, buttons, and other elements.

Clicking Buttons enables you to specify how you want your menu buttons to 
appear. Unlike the computer-based menus to which you’re accustomed, a 
DVD menu is a screen with buttons or labels on it. Menu buttons are the 
visual elements that you navigate and select with your DVD remote control, 
selecting such things as what to play, whether subtitles are on or off, or 
whether to play a narration track. Although they’re called buttons, as you’ll 
see in the following list, they don’t have to look like computer (or physical) 
buttons at all. Your choices are
 
✓ Text: Simple text, although you can designate an underlining style that 
appears when the button is selected
 
✓ Bullets: Small icons that show up when the button is selected
 
✓ Shapes: Graphic elements that appear behind the button when selected
 
✓ Frames: Framing rectangles
 
✓ Artistic: Fancy borders for your button
 
✓ Rectangle: Various boxes that surround your button
 
✓ Rounded: Curved boxes that surround your button
 
With any of the last four button types, selecting the slashed circle icon from 
the styles that appear in that category applies a default border to your 
button, but selecting any other style includes a graphic thumbnail displaying 
a preview of your content (the default is a 30-second video loop).

19
 Chapter 1: Making and Sharing Movies
Selecting Media allows you to specify content for use on your DVD, either as 
part of the menu structure or the actual content. You see the Media Browser 
a lot in this book — it’s the interface between the different iLife applications. 
For example, in iDVD, you would use the Media Browser to select movies 
created in iMovie, audio created in GarageBand or stored in your iTunes 
Library, and photos from your iPhoto Library.

Your Source Material
In This Chapter
▶ Creating your shooting plan
▶ Shooting what you planned
I
f you don’t have a script or a plan and aren’t shooting your own video, 
but are just assembling existing material from other sources, feel free 
to skip over this chapter. However, if you’re planning the next dramatic 
blockbuster or comedy tour-de-farce (pun intended), or just an organized 
event that has yet to occur (such as a sporting event, birthday party, or 
wedding), you can find material here to help you ensure that you 
don’t forget something. In addition, we offer tips for taking 
better footage. The following discussions cover as many 
bases as possible, without delving into a complete 
rehash of Filmmaking For Dummies (Bryan Michael 
Stoller, Wiley Publishing). You might not need to 
heed all the advice, but you should at least consider 
each suggestion before dismissing it as overkill for 
your project.
Planning Your Shoot
You might think that planning your shoot just 
involves giving your actors their scripts, stage direc-
tions, and a chance to rehearse, but that’s just the tip of 
the iceberg!
Arranging the venue
Suppose that you’re chronicling the nuptials of someone you really wish 
to please with your effort: Maybe they’re paying you, or maybe you’re 
giving them this effort as your wedding gift. The first things you need to

Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
consider are where you can set up, whether you can get by with only one 
camera angle (yeah, right!), where the camera(s) need to be positioned, 
where the microphone(s) need to be located, how much control you have 
over the lighting and its position, and whether auxiliary power is available 
without interfering with the event. (Power cords tripping the ushers, guests, 
or bridal party are sure to ruin things.)
 
When it comes to audio, relying on the built-in microphone in your cam-
corder to collect excellent sound is like counting on a politician to tell the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. You might get lucky and get 
good sound if you’re close to the action, if ambient noise levels are low, and if 
your subjects speak clearly and with adequate volume for the microphone to 
pick them up. But those are a lot of ifs. Occasionally, the internal microphone 
even picks up camera noises (for example, the whirring noise when you zoom 
in or out). Most camcorders have an attachment for an external microphone 
and, if it’s within your budget, having an external microphone gives you more 
options when it comes to getting the best audio possible.
 
At a wedding, we would suggest placing one camera behind the officiant 
so that you have a good shot of the couple, with an emphasis on the bride, 
and one behind the couple or the groom, to give you a good shot of the 
officiant, as a minimum. You should also have at least one microphone posi-
tioned between the officiant and the couple to make certain that you catch 
the invocation and the vows: Your camcorders’ microphones can easily miss 
at least part of the dialogue or record it so faintly that viewers won’t be able 
to make out what was said. One possible safety net is to set up a Mac with 
GarageBand running and a good microphone attached to catch everything 
and then dub it back into your movie.
Most microphones come with foam covers. These covers not only protect the 
microphone from scratches, minor dents, and an accumulation of filth, but 
filter out wind sounds, as well as reducing various vocal distractions, such as 
sibilant s sounds or the popping of p and b sounds.
 
Another thing you can do to preview what your audio will sound like is to 
plug a set of headphones into the camcorder’s headphone jack and listen to 
what the camcorder is “hearing.”
Lighting should ideally be located above, slightly behind, and to the side of 
(say, at a 30 degree angle) the camera. The closer you can come to this ideal, 
the better, but you should avoid shooting into the light at all costs. Similarly, 
you should avoid having the light directly atop the camera, especially if 
you’re going to be getting full-face shots: Red-eye is much harder to fix in 
video than it is in still photos.

 Chapter 2: Creating and Assembling Your Source Material
Lining up your resources
It’s been said that timing is everything. We don’t know if that absolute is true, 
but timing and scheduling are certainly important factors in successfully 
making a movie.
If you’re lining up the venue and producing a movie with pre-planned scenes 
and dialogue, here are some of the items you should remember to schedule:
 
✓ The location: Whether you’re working on a traditional sound stage or 
some other venue, you need to schedule its use, giving yourself enough 
time for setup as well as shooting time.
 
✓ The cast and crew: All involved parties need to know when they need to 
be there, what they need to bring, and what preparatory work they need 
to do. This can include learning lines, setting up scenery, applying 
makeup, or getting into costume.
 
✓ The equipment: Cameras, microphones, props, and so forth need to be 
available. You might need to rent or borrow some equipment – verify 
that it is available when needed.
The larger your project, the more involved your scheduling is and the more 
care you need to put into it. Even a small project should, at a minimum, 
have a checklist of to-do items. For larger projects, you should consider 
building a timeline, or even using a project management system to track 
your dependencies and help you identify conflicts before they throw your 
schedule out of whack. Lots of project management tools are available. We 
have used OmniPlan (www.omnigroup.com) and iTaskX (www.itaskx.com) 
for our projects, but many others are available. Both offer trial versions, so 
you can easily check out their suitability for your purposes. Figures 2-1 and 
2-2 show a couple of sample screens from OmniPlan and Figures 2-3 and 2-4 
show the iTaskX screens using the same input data.

25
 Chapter 2: Creating and Assembling Your Source Material
 
If you opt for a project management system, please remember that they are 
only as good as the data they’re fed. GIGO (garbage-in, garbage-out) is espe-
cially true when creating a timeline and dependency chart (they’re usually 
called Gantt charts, after Henry Gannt). All the conclusions drawn are tied 
directly to the input data. If, for example, you tell the program that a given 
task takes two hours, all subsequent activity scheduling is based on that 
estimate and all conflict-checking is also based on that estimate. Similarly, if 
you specify that a particular individual or resource is needed for a task, the 
dependency checking schedules the task so that it isn’t concurrent with 
any other task requiring that resource. On the other hand, if you forget to 
include a necessary resource, the scheduler might end up making the task 
overlap another task that also requires the resource. Many projects go 
awry because the input data is incomplete, unrealistic or, at the very least, 
overly optimistic. This applies not only to time, but also to cost. Double- 
and triple-check to make certain that nothing is omitted and include a little 
padding to deal with the unexpected — Murphy and his laws are alive, well, 
and pop in at the most inopportune times.
Shooting Your Plan
The military has an adage: “No battle plan survives the first contact with the 
enemy.” Moviemakers can adapt that philosophy as “No shooting schedule 
survives past the first scene.” The following examples should illustrate why 
having a “Plan B” (and C and D, and so on) is a necessity.
Be prepared
Okay, you’ve planned everything, scheduled everything, and are now ready 
to implement your artistic vision. Now you hear that one of your cast has 
cracked a tooth and is at the dentist: What is your contingency plan? Are 
there scenes you can shoot in the current location with the available cast and 
crew that don’t involve the poor soul at the dentist?
Another factor that could affect your schedule is the weather. Did you plan 
to shoot an outdoor scene only to have the weatherman send you an unex-
pected rainstorm when you needed a sunlit day?
 
One of the advantages using a Gannt chart offers is that, based upon 
your input, you can usually identify tasks you might switch to that aren’t 
dependent upon the missing resource or the capriciousness of Zeus.
Alternatively, now that you’ve started shooting, you’re finding that your 
cast doesn’t have their parts down quite well enough or that they’re a little 
distracted, presenting you with great fodder for a “blooper reel,” but not 

26
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
getting the scene you want. Meanwhile, your camera battery is running low. 
Did you remember to bring spare, fully charged batteries, or do you have a 
convenient electric outlet so you can run off AC power? You’re also running 
low on tape or whatever other media you might be using (such as mini-DVD/
RWs). Hopefully, you remembered to always keep spare media available. 
Of course, if you’re using a camcorder that records to a hard drive or flash 
memory, it’s easy enough to just erase the bad takes and re-record, but then 
you risk losing what might be some really good blooper material.
If you don’t have multiple cameras available, try to tape more than one take 
of a scene, possibly from a slightly different angle. This gives you a fallback 
position in case you later discover something slightly awry, and it might 
allow you to do a cut from one camera angle to another in order to improve 
your presentation.
 
When filming an unscripted event, such as a school play, you’re quite 
likely to encounter other doting parents and grandparents recording the 
same event. Ask around to see if you can “pool” footage and get that more 
professional, multiple camera look.
Although it seems trite and harkens back to the movies of the 1930s and 
1940s about making films, recording a clapboard or even just a sign with 
information about the scene you’re preparing to shoot provides two impor-
tant elements: identifying the scene and guaranteeing that the camera is 
rolling before the real action begins. If you’re a traditionalist (or just a little 
silly), you can even call out, “Lights, camera, action . . . scene two, take two,” 
or something similar. All of the work involved shouldn’t detract from the joy 
making a movie can offer.
 
When pooling footage or using multiple cameras, try as hard as you can 
to match input formats. For example, if you’re filming in HD, try to find 
others who are also using an HD camcorder (or at least a widescreen aspect 
ratio). The closer you can match input formats, the better (or at least more 
consistent) the output will be.
Getting the best footage you can
Basically, three common errors ruin most amateur film efforts: bouncing, 
jittery camera work; poorly lit scenes; and bad audio. You can avoid these 
pitfalls, in most cases, by heeding the advice in the following sections.
Avoiding the jitters
Most modern digital camcorders (other than the really inexpensive ones) 
include some stabilization circuitry. The provided stabilization takes care 
of really minor shaking, but doesn’t help when it comes to the bouncy 
video resulting from moving the camera around, especially across an uneven 

27
 Chapter 2: Creating and Assembling Your Source Material
surface. iMovie also provides some new stabilization routines that help to 
smooth out jittery video, but the software can only do so much. Avoiding the 
problem in the first place means that you don’t have to rely on how much 
the camera or iMovie’s routines can do to fix the problem. Your best bet to 
inexpensively avoid bouncing images is a tripod.
 
If you have more money in the budget, you might even consider a Steadicam 
or other gyro-balanced camera mount. Lacking the budget, improvise by 
using a table, fence rail, or car/truck hood as your temporary tripod. Pan 
slowly — it not only reduces jitter, but also doesn’t give your audience visual 
whiplash.
Zooming in and out rapidly can give your viewers a queasy feeling. Slow, 
smooth zooming, when zooming is called for at all, is the ticket. And avoid 
digital zoom: Digital zoom is merely a magnification and interpolation in 
your camera’s software, resulting in generally blocky and unrealistic-looking 
footage (unless that is the effect you’re seeking). If you need more zoom than 
offered by your camera’s optical zoom, you should really find a way to get 
closer. Figure 2-5 shows a frame where digital zooming was (ab)used.
Figure 2-5: 
Digital 
zooming can 
make your 
footage look 
fake.
 
Letting in the light
Your camcorder is an electronic device and doesn’t see light the same way 
your eye sees light. In low-light conditions, your eye automatically dilates 
to let in more light, and this can lead you to believe that there’s enough 

28
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
light for the scene. Unless you manually adjust your camera, it is unlikely to 
agree with you. Find out what lighting settings your camera allows and set 
them appropriately for the prevailing conditions. Most camcorders have 
settings for low-light and low-contrast situations, as well as a white-balance 
adjustment used to eliminate color casts.
 
Different types of light sources cast a different tint onto the light they pro-
vide. The human eye filters out these color casts before we even recognize 
their presence. A camera actually records what is present. Sunlight tends 
toward blue, incandescent lights (you know, the ones we’re replacing with 
the compact fluorescent lights that look like spirals) tend toward a yellow 
tinge, and fluorescent lights gravitate toward green. Use your camera’s white 
balance adjustment to accommodate the lighting for the scene you’re about 
to shoot.
Every decent camcorder includes a menu of pre-programmed adjustments for 
different lighting conditions. The downside is that every manufacturer uses 
different names for these adjustments and camera manuals are frequently 
poorly written (or at least poorly translated into English). Fortunately, 
though, the sections on the adjustments are almost always short and compre-
hensible, other than the possibly tortured English. Take the time to learn 
what your camera has to offer you.
Getting clean audio
We can’t overemphasize the importance of checking that you’re capturing 
the audio properly. Wearing headphones, as mentioned earlier in this 
chapter, is an excellent way to verify that the camera is capturing what it 
should and not recording undesired audio. If possible, having additional 
audio sources so that you can dub in as needed in post-production is great 
insurance.
Even a simple clip-on microphone generally provides better audio fidelity 
than your camera’s mic, especially if you aren’t filming a close-up. 
Microphones fall into four basic categories:
 
✓ Cardioid: The heart-shaped pickup region gives this category its name. 
Cardioid microphones, although directed mostly forward, also pick up 
audio from the sides and rear. These microphones, when used in the 
camera, pick up various camera sounds (such as the tape transport 
mechanism or the zoom motor) in addition to the background noises 
you might want.
 
✓ Directional: The traditional example of a directional microphone is the 
shotgun microphone. Its narrow, elliptical pickup region focuses on 
what is in front of the camera and picks up very little audio from the 
sides and virtually none from behind the microphone.

29
 Chapter 2: Creating and Assembling Your Source Material
 
✓ Super-cardioid: The super-cardioid microphone is the one most com-
monly found on camcorders. It is essentially a compromise between the 
cardioid and directional microphone, with an elliptical pickup region 
that isn’t as narrow as the directional.
 
✓ Omnidirectional: These microphones pick up sound from all directions 
equally well, as the name indicates. Most clip-on and lavaliere micro-
phones, like newscasters wear, are omnidirectional.
 
If you know that your subjects are going to be relatively stationary, you 
might consider employing a boom microphone. You can fashion one out of a 
super-cardioid microphone hanging from a wire above the scene, just outside 
the camera’s view.
Importing Your Video
After you’ve gotten your ducks in a row and you have lots of video with 
which to work, you need to get it into iMovie. iMovie accepts video from 
numerous sources, although the most common is a camcorder. Other 
common contributors include your Mac’s iSight camera (if it has one), 
camera video clips that are in your iPhoto Library, and video clips you have 
on your hard drive or other storage media.
Getting video from your camcorder
iMovie works with both FireWire camcorders, which are tape-based, and 
USB 2.0 camcorders, which are commonly hard-drive, flash, or DVD-RW 
based. (FireWire and USB2 are different types of cable used to connect your 
camcorder to your computer.) Other than the obvious difference in the type 
of connection required, a significant difference is that tape-based camcorders 
are sequential access devices, meaning that you have to advance or rewind 
through the content until you’ve positioned the camera to a specific clip 
and then have to monitor the import process to bring in desired clip or clips. 
The USB-based devices are random access, meaning that you can (virtually) 
instantaneously access any clip just as if it were a file on a hard disk or CD or 
DVD — because, to all intents, that’s just what it is.
As a result of this fundamental difference in how you access content, the 
interfaces for importing from these different camera types are somewhat 
different.

30
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
Importing from a FireWire camera
The original standard for use with iMovie, FireWire-based mini-DV cam-
corders provide both a number of advantages and disadvantages compared 
with the USB camcorders we discuss shortly. Among the advantages are
 
✓ The (essentially) uncompressed DV video stream is of relatively 
high quality.
 
✓ The tape to archive your footage is relatively inexpensive (about $2-$3/
hour tape, currently) if you need or want to access it in the future.
 
✓ FireWire provides device control, meaning that your Mac (and iMovie) 
can control the camera when they’re connected, having it play, rewind, 
fast-forward, and so forth.
 
✓ You can share your tapes between multiple cameras.
The disadvantages, however, are
 
✓ DV streams take up about 200MB/minute (12GB/hour).
 
✓ They are sequential access (requiring frequent fast-forwarding and 
rewinding to locate footage you seek).
 
✓ Data transfer is slower because you have to play the tape to make the 
transfer.
When you connect a tape-based camera, iMovie presents a window similar to 
that shown in Figure 2-6.
When you click the Import button (in the lower right of the screen) with the 
Automatic toggle set (lower-left), iMovie prompts you with the dialog shown 
in Figure 2-7. Choose the volume (a techie name that usually means the same 
thing as disk) to which you want to save your clips using the Save To pop-up 
menu. The Add to Existing Event and Create New Event radio buttons are 
pretty much self-explanatory: Because there are no existing Events in our 
brand-new Event Library, the Add to Existing Event item and its related 
pop-up menu are disabled. If you want all the footage to go to one event, 
deselect (uncheck) the Split days into new Events check box; otherwise, 
iMovie splits the content into new events for each taping date. If you want 
iMovie to employ its stabilization routines on the clips, select the Analyze 
for Stabilization After Import check box. Don’t worry: If you don’t stabilize at 
this point, you can always select the clip and stabilize it later. After you’ve 
set your import options, click Import and iMovie instructs your camera to 
rewind the tape to the beginning and then start importing, showing your 
progress in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Even with the toggle set to Automatic, you can still halt the import process 
by clicking the Stop button.
When the import is complete, iMovie presents the process dialog shown at 
the top of Figure 2-8 while generating thumbnails for the imported clips. After 
generating the thumbnails, iMovie tells you about how much video it 
imported (bottom of Figure 2-8).

If you want to import selected clips rather than everything on the tape, flip 
the toggle from Automatic to Manual and watch the import window for 
your camera sprout a few extra controls, as shown in Figure 2-9. The added 
buttons, from left to right, are Rewind, Fast-Forward, Stop, and Play/Pause 
(if paused or stopped, the arrow for Play shows; if playing, Pause’s double 
vertical bar symbol shows). Use these buttons to control your camera and 
position to the footage you want to import. When you’re ready, click the 
Import button. The same process as for Automatic import now unfolds, 
except that you don’t receive a message telling you how much video you 
imported.
When you are finished importing (for the time being), click the Done button 
to return to iMovie’s workspace and notice that your newly imported clips 
are now in the Event Library, as indicated in Figure 2-10.

Importing from a USB recorder
Connecting your USB camera presents a slightly different interface, as shown 
in Figure 2-11 for Manual mode. The bottom half of the window displays 
thumbnails for each clip on your camera’s media (hard drive, flash, or 
mini-DVD), each with a check mark below indicating that it is to be imported. 
The check boxes and the Uncheck All button are absent in Automatic mode, 
where import is all or nothing. If, in Manual mode, you uncheck any of the 
clips, the Import All button changes to read Import Checked.

34
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
 
At the bottom of the Import window is a button labeled Archive All. We 
can’t emphasize strongly enough how valuable backups are, and this button 
is your gateway to archiving the clips residing on your camera’s media, 
allowing you to erase and reuse the space for new footage while still having 
the clips for future use and reference. Click Archive All and iMovie presents a 
collapsed Save dialog, as shown at the left in Figure 2-12, where you can name 
the archive, if you don’t like the default name, and choose a location from the 
Where pop-up menu. Click the blue button with the triangle to the right of the 
Save As text box to expand the Save dialog as shown in Figure 2-12 on the 
right. Personally, we prefer the added flexibility of the expanded dialog, with 
its familiar Finder-like interface. You can choose File➪Import➪From Archive 
to import archived clips at a later time or to a different account’s iMovie 
Event Library.
Next appears the Import dialog shown in Figure 2-13, asking where you 
want to save the clips, whether you want to create a new Event or add to an 
existing Event (and, if so, which one), whether to create new Events if the 
clip was shot on a different day, and whether to perform image stabilization 
after the import. It also gives you a chance to specify (again) a setting for 
1080i high-definition video.

Click Import All (or Import Checked) and iMovie starts the import, indicating 
below each thumbnail where in the process it is, as shown in Figure 2-14. 
When complete, iMovie presents a dialog informing you how many clips and 
how much total time they represent were imported.
When you’re finished importing, click the Done button to dismiss the Import 
From window. The new Event or Events are displayed in the Event Library, as 
shown in Figure 2-15.

36
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
 
Please be sure to unmount your camera before disconnecting it from the 
computer. The Eject button at the bottom of the Import From window is the 
easiest method, but you can also open a Finder window and click the Eject 
button next to your camera’s entry in the Finder window’s sidebar. If you 
disconnect your camera without unmounting it first, you risk damage to the 
media (slight) or to the content on that media.
Recording video from your iSight camera
Many Macs (the MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and iMac) come with 
iSight cameras built in. Although Apple no longer manufactures or sells 
them, you can still find external FireWire iSight cameras available on eBay 
and other such sites. These are excellent adjuncts to Mac minis and MacPros 
that don’t include the camera. You can invoke the Import From window by 
clicking the Camera icon or choosing File➪Import from Camera (Ô+I). If no 
other cameras are connected, the Import From window defaults to the iSight, 
as shown in Figure 2-16.
When you’re ready to start recording, click the Capture button and deal with 
the by now familiar Import Options dialog displayed in Figure 2-17. Specify 
where to save the clip, whether it should be a new Event or should be added 
to an existing Event (and which one), whether to split different days into 
different events, and whether to analyze for stabilization. Click the Capture 
button to proceed.
Figure 2-16:

to capture 
what the 
iSight

37
 Chapter 2: Creating and Assembling Your Source Material
Figure 2-17: 
Set your 
capture 
options.
 
When you’re finished, click Done to dismiss the Import From window and 
you’ll see your new content in the Event Library.
 
We think that the Split Days into New Events check box is excess baggage 
here because live capture is almost never on different days, and if it is, it’s 
still part of a single clip. The stabilization option is almost as redundant, 
but we suppose it’s possible (although not likely) that you’re carrying your 
MacBook while recording.
Importing video from other sources
As we mentioned earlier, we strongly recommend archiving your original 
content before erasing it from your camera. The File➪Import➪Camera 
Archive command lets you bring that footage into iMovie, either at a later 
date or, if you stored it on an external drive, on another Mac. Importing a 
camera archive is simple. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Import➪Camera Archive.
 
 A Save dialog, as shown in Figure 2-18, appears.

iMovie 
asks you 
to locate 
and select

38

2. Navigate to and select the Camera Archive.
 
3. iMovie changes the instruction at the bottom of the dialog to tell you 
that you’ve selected the archive and should click Import to proceed, 
as shown in Figure 2-19.
Figure 2-19: 
When 
iMovie

you to click

 A progress dialog appears and then disappears when the import 
completes.
 
 With a small archive, you’ll miss the progress dialog if you blink – 
importing from a hard disk is fast.
 
4. The Import From dialog now appears, just as if you had the named 
camera connected. Proceed as described earlier in this chapter for 
importing from a USB camera.
You can also import content from compatible video files on your Mac’s 
hard disk or external drives. Compatible files are MPEG-4, DV, and some 
QuickTime movie files (all but one of the ones we’ve tried worked, but Apple 
documents compatibility as “some .mov files”). Proceed as follows:
 
1. Choose File➪Import➪Movies.
 
 A Save dialog appears, as shown in Figure 2-20.
 
2. Tell iMovie where to save the clips, whether you’re creating a new 
Event or augmenting an existing Event (and which one), how to 
deal with HD video, and whether the file should be copied (the 
original stays in place) or moved (the original is deleted after the 
file is copied).

 iMovie performs the conversion and keeps you informed of its progress.
 
Not everything comes over from an iMovie HD project when you import it. 
For example, all transitions come over as Cross Dissolve transitions (see 
Chapter 9 for more on Transitions). Titles and Effects (also covered in 
Chapter 9) are lost, and no music is transferred. Similarly, clips dragged into 
the iMovie HD project from the Finder do not come across either.
As we saw in Chapter 1, iMovie offers to bring compatible movies from iPhoto 
into your Event Library the first time you run iMovie. If you add other movies 
to your iPhoto Library or delayed the conversion, you can click the iPhoto 
Videos item in your Event Library and iMovie shows you compatible movies 
from which to choose.

Managing Events
In This Chapter
▶ Naming your Events
▶ Organizing your Events
▶ Archiving Events
E
vents are the building blocks of iMovie. This chapter is all about how to 
manage Events: what they are, how to name them, organize them, and 
even how to archive them when you think you no longer need them.
Figuring Out What Events Are
In Chapter 2, we talk about the Event Library, iMovie’s organiza-
tional structure that contains all your video clips. However, 
in that chapter, we don’t get into exactly what an Event 
is, partly because an Event is whatever you want it to 
be. By default, as we show in a number of the screen-
shots in Chapter 2, iMovie suggests that footage 
shot on a single date be an Event (iPhoto has the 
same default for the images you import). Setting 
one day to equal one Event is, in our opinion, a 
pretty good default setting.
But if you want your weeklong Caribbean cruise to 
be an Event, you could designate the footage shot 
that entire week as a single Event. On the other hand, 
if you have a couple of kids in Little League who both 
have games on the same day, you probably want each 
game that you record to be a separate Event. iMovie’s “each 
day is an Event” default works well enough for many situations, 
but you’re free to override it whenever you want.

Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
Naming Events
When you import video, iMovie suggests a default name for the Event — a 
combination of the words New Event and the date you imported the footage. 
We don’t know about you, but the import date (possibly followed by a 
sequential number) is not how we think of Events. To us an Event is some-
thing like “Mom’s 80th Birthday” or “Jessie’s High School Graduation.”
 
iMovie uses the import date, not the shoot date, as part of the suggested 
name. We don’t really see why. If they were going to use a date as part of the 
name, why didn’t they choose the shoot date? The date you shot the footage 
is obviously more meaningful to recognizing the Event than the day you 
finally got around to moving it from the camera to your Mac.
Although you can take iMovie’s Event name suggestion, we feel that such a 
policy is only a slight improvement over leaving folder names as “Untitled-n,” 
where n is the number that Finder adds by default. You should really pick a 
descriptive name for Events you’re importing. We think the best time to do 
so is when you’re importing the footage — after all, the content is right in 
front of you and fresh in your mind. Just replace the suggested text in the 
Import Options dialog (see Figure 3-1) and import your content.

Arranging Events
iMovie uses dates to organize the Event Library’s Event list, and the items are 
organized by the year and, optionally, the month (View➪Group Events by 
Month) that the Event was added to the Event Library. Figure 3-5 shows the 
Event Library with grouping by month enabled. Notice that, even though a 
number of Events occurred in previous years (we added the year to the Event 
name to make the Events easier to locate), all the Events are listed as being in 
February, 2009, which is the month in which they were added to the Event 
Library. This presentation is a result of having View➪Most Recent Events at 
Top selected.
If you, like us, prefer to have your events chronological by occurrence, 
deselect View➪Most Recent Events at Top and the content is presented as 
shown in Figure 3-6.
You can give yourself more information about the Events by taking advantage 
of one of iMovie’s Preference settings (iMovie➪Preferences or Ô+,). Click the 
Browser icon at the top of the iMovie Preferences window to display the pane 
shown in Figure 3-7. Select the very first check box, Show Date Ranges in 
Event List, and your Event Library pane resembles that in Figure 3-8. (The 
Date Ranges in question are the first and last dates of the clips in the Event.)

In our opinion, the chronological listing with date ranges displayed is the 
most efficient arrangement iMovie offers. Oddly enough, this arrangement 
comes close to mirroring the presentation in iPhoto. We wonder why the 
defaults are inconsistent between the two programs.
Moving, Copying, and Archiving Events
As you work with your iMovie footage and complete the projects that use it, 
you’re probably going to want to free up some disk space rather than have 
old footage just laying around. Or, if you’re like us and want to have back-up 
copies of your Events, you want to keep an extra copy (or more) on another 
disk for safety’s sake. In either case, knowing how to move your Events 
around comes in very handy.

46
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
Figure 3-9 shows your Event Library displayed in the way to which you’re 
already accustomed. That little iconic button in the right corner of the 
Event Library title bar is a disk icon. Click it to Group Events by Disk — the 
button turns blue when you’re viewing Events by disk. The Event Library now 
displays all the disks your Mac knows about, as shown in Figure 3-10.
To copy an Event to another disk, proceed as follows:
 
1. Click the disk button at the top-right of the Event Library to turn on 
Group by Disk.
 
 The button turns blue and other disks your Mac knows about appear in 
the Event Library list.
 
2. Select the Event or Events that you want to copy.
 
3. Drag them to the name of the disk where you want the copy to reside, 
as shown in Figure 3-11.
 
 iMovie displays a progress dialog while it’s making the copy. Copying 
large files from one disk to another can take a few minutes (or more), 
and video files tend to be large.

Working with Clips
In This Chapter
▶ Viewing your clips
▶ Designating favorite clips
▶ Hiding and showing clips
▶ Reducing clip jitters
S
ay that you’ve shot your footage and imported it into your Event Library. 
Now it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty: Selecting the clips you want 
to use and editing them.
In this chapter, we delve into the techniques available for viewing your clips, 
marking clips as favorites (or rejects), designating which clips are displayed 
in the Event Library’s clip pane, and employing iMovie’s stabiliza-
tion routines to eliminate the seismic shaking commonly 
seen in handheld camcorder video.
Finding Out About Clips
To get started, we have to define the word clip for 
the context of this (and any future) discussion: It’s 
a word we’ve been using and about which we 
believe you probably have a general understanding. 
A clip is a continuous stream of video. In other 
words, from the time you start recording until you 
click the camera’s Record button to stop it is one clip. 
If you subtract the time code for the beginning of a clip 
from the time code for the end of a clip, you get the length 
of your clip. Similarly, if you cut footage from the middle of a 
clip, the result is two shorter clips.

Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
Time codes are a somewhat techy concept, but you find them discussed in 
many digital video contexts, so you probably ought to get a handle on the 
idea. Video is composed of frames, which are essentially still images. NTSC 
video has essentially 29.97 frames per second, but most people just count 
it as 30; PAL has 25 frames per second. If you think of video like a picture 
flipbook, with 30 pages per second flipping by, you’ll understand why we see 
the video as a continuous stream. (In cartoon animation, for example, we 
know that if the rate of images moving by is more than about 16 frames per 
second, the human eye doesn’t notice the discontinuities.) iMovie defaults to 
expressing time codes in the form hh:mm:ss (hours from 0–23, minutes from 
0–59, and seconds from 0–59), but you can opt to show the frames (from 0–29 
for NTSC or 0–24 for PAL) in the iMovie Preferences’ General pane, shown in 
Figure 4-1 with the cursor pointing to the Display Time as HH:MM:SS:Frames 
check box.
Figure 4-2 shows the Event Library status bar when you don’t have Frame 
display turned on at the top and with Frame display active on the bottom.
 
Because iMovie omits the hour field from the display when less than an 
hour is present, the 1:15:12 (which is for a clip that is 1 min, 15 sec, and 12 
frames) displayed in Figure 4-2, out of context, could be misinterpreted 
to mean 1 hr, 15 min, and 12 seconds. We think that time codes should be 
fully exhibited because the frame display is optional. Because iMovie is 
targeted at endeavors shorter than an hour, Apple might argue that this 
implementation is unlikely to cause confusion, but how about those clips 
where the display shows, for example, 5:23? Is that 5 minutes, 23 seconds, or 
is it 5 seconds plus 23 frames? If frames were always displayed, we would 
know that the rightmost number was frames and no confusion could result 
from a shortened time code display.

Viewing Clips in the Event Library
Some people don’t edit their video in any way, shape, or form and they just 
put out the raw footage for others to see. Other than surveillance video, 
where you need to have a continuous stream, we don’t see any reason to 
return to the boring, unedited, 8mm home movie days of the '40s (and a few 
other decades, since 8mm home video debuted in 1932). Why should you? 
iMovie makes it easy to eliminate unwanted material and fix problems like 
jitter. (Okay, laziness could be considered a reason by some, but we call it an 
excuse rather than a reason.)
To determine which clips and how much of those clips you want to use, you 
need to watch them. You also need to watch them to determine which 
require adjustments for color, cropping, audio problems, or jittery video. We 
cover stabilization (jittery video correction) later in this chapter, audio 
adjustments in Chapter 11, and other adjustments in Chapter 6.
You have essentially two ways to view your video in iMovie. The first is in the 
workspace and the second is full-screen, but both environments offer the 
same editing techniques.
When you select a clip in the Event Library, the clip gets a yellow border and 
sports a small Action badge (the gear and menu indicator) in the lower-left 
corner, with a time code above it, indicating the length of the selection. 
The Action badge displays a menu of actions (shown in Figure 4-3) you can 
perform on the clip.
We find it difficult to postpone satisfying our curiosity, so we’re going to 
satisfy yours by showing you the results of choosing any of the four menu 
items. The gratification of finding out how to proceed from those points is 
going to have to wait a bit, however.

52
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
Choosing one of the first three items displays one of the Inspectors shown in 
Figure 4-4 (all three Inspector panes are shown). The Clip Inspector acquires 
additional powers when you’re viewing a clip in the Project Library, which we 
discuss in Chapter 5.
Choosing Cropping & Rotation from the action menu adds some controls to 
the top of the Viewer, as seen in Figure 4-5.
Now that we’ve slaked your curiosity concerning the badge, we are going 
to introduce a pair of buzzwords you should know in order to carry on 
a conversation with others concerning clip viewing (which you’ll probably 
do at, say, your next cocktail party):
 
✓ Playhead: The red vertical bar indicating the current position within 
a clip.
 
✓ Scrubbing: The action of sliding the mouse pointer over a clip, moving 
the playhead. Notice that the Viewer tracks the action. Apple often 
refers to the visual result of this action as skimming. You can see the 
playhead (sometimes called the scrubber bar) under the hand cursor in 
Figure 4-6.

Viewing in the workspace
In the workspace, you scrub to position the playhead on the frame from 
which you want the clip to start playing. When you have the playhead 
positioned, press Space and the clip starts to play in the Viewer (press Space 
again to pause playback). You can also start and stop play by clicking the 
play button below the Event Library.
 
When you’re scrubbing, a black cartoon dialog balloon appears indicating the 
playhead’s time code, as shown in Figure 4-6. You might want to make note of 
some important time codes, such as where you want to trim your footage, 
split a clip, insert a clip, the spot you want to apply an effect, and so on.
Viewing full-screen
Switching to full-screen viewing in iMovie is, in our opinion, less straightfor-
ward than we’ve come to expect from iMovie (and Apple). There are four 
ways to enter full-screen mode. The method you select and when you select 
it affect what you see when you start viewing full-screen:
 
✓ You can click the Play Selected Events Full-Screen button below the 
Event Library. The clips in that Event start playing full-screen automati-
cally from the beginning.
 
✓ You can choose Window➪Show Events Full-Screen (Ô+7). The first 
frame of the first clip in the first selected Event appears full-screen, 
waiting for you to press Space to start it playing (or make the thumb-
strip appear so that you can scrub to the point where you want play to 
begin). We say more on the thumbstrip in a couple of paragraphs.

54
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
 
✓ You can right-click (Control+click) the clip and choose Play Full-Screen 
from the contextual menu that appears. The clip starts playing full-
screen from the where you right-clicked.
 
✓ You can choose View➪Play full-screen (Ô+G) and, in most cases, the 
clip starts playing full-screen.
 
We say the clip starts playing full-screen “in most cases” because this menu 
item isn’t really straightforward in indicating what is going to play. For 
example, if there is a project in the Project Library (we get into Projects in 
Chapter 5), the project is usually going to start playing, even if an Event is 
selected, but if the Event is already playing, pressing Ô+G puts the Event 
playback into full-screen mode. If nothing has played yet and there is no 
project, iMovie just beeps at you. To add to this confusion, the tooltip that 
displays when you hover over the Play Selected Events Full-Screen button 
indicates that Ô+G is the button’s keyboard shortcut, and that doesn’t 
mesh with the View➪Play full-screen menu command. If this all seems a bit 
capricious to you, join the club. However, as long as you keep the oddities in 
mind as you work, you should be fine.
When viewing in full-screen mode, you can move the cursor toward the 
bottom of the screen to slightly reduce the viewing rectangle’s size and 
display some additional controls (as we cover in Chapter 1). The most 
frequently employed control is what Apple calls the thumbstrip: that row 
of thumbnails immediately beneath the viewing rectangle. Just as in the 
Event Library’s clip pane, you can scrub across the thumbstrip to position 
the video. Figure 4-7 shows the thumbstrip and the bottom of the viewing 
rectangle.

55
 Chapter 4: Working with Clips
 
 Press Space to start playing (pressing Space while playing pauses playback). 
To exit full-screen mode, you can either move your cursor toward the bottom 
of the screen to display the controls and then click the circled X (shown 
here in the margin) in the bottom-left corner or, much more quickly, just 
press Esc.
Marking Favorites (and Rejects)
While viewing your video, you are quite likely to encounter footage that you 
really like, and also footage with which you’re ashamed to be associated. 
iMovie makes it easy for you to mark both types of footage for later reference.
To mark video, proceed as follows:
 
1. Select a range of frames, a clip, or multiple clips within an Event.
 
 
2. Press F to mark the video as a Favorite or R (or Delete) to indicate 
that it is a Reject (or press either the Mark Selection as Favorite 
 
 
 button or the Reject Selection button, shown in the margin).
 
 
 Footage that has been marked as a Favorite sports a green line 
at the top, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
 Rejected footage, if your Show pop-up menu is set to All Clips or 
Rejected Only, displays a red line at the top, as shown in Figure 4-9; 
otherwise, it disappears from view.

56
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
 
 If you change your mind as to whether a video sequence is superb (or 
abysmal), select the range and press U or click the Unmark Selection button 
shown in the margin.
Hiding Clips
iMovie gives you four options as to which clips are shown when you select 
an Event. They are controlled by the Show pop-up menu beneath the Event 
Library as follows:
 
✓ Favorites Only: Just what the name implies — only footage marked 
as Favorites (described previously in this chapter) is visible. You 
should choose this option only after you have marked some Favorites; 
otherwise, you have no footage with which to work.
 
✓ Favorites and Unmarked: This is the default setting and displays all 
video that hasn’t been rejected.
 
✓ All Clips: Displays all of your footage (rejected video sports a red bar at 
the top).
 
✓ Rejected Only: Displays only your rejects, sporting their signature red 
bar at the top.
The most common use of Favorites is to mark the footage you intend to 
use in your movie. After you’ve viewed all the video and marked what you 
want to use, it is a simple matter to choose Favorites Only from the Show 
pop-up menu and then drag the clips into your Project (see Chapter 5 for 
the lowdown on Projects).
Similarly, the most common use of Rejects is to mark the footage you want to 
dispose of. To dispose of the rejected video, choose File➪Move Rejected 
Clips to Trash when you’ve completed viewing and marking your clips.
 
Another way to utilize the Favorites and Rejects designators is to mark the 
footage you want in your movie as Favorites and the video for a blooper 
reel (or whatever you want to call your outtakes) as Rejects. With that 
accomplished, you can simply move the appropriate footage to the two 
different projects (we cover Projects in Chapter 5). More complex variations 
are possible using keywords, a feature of iMovie’s Advanced Tools that we 
discuss in Chapter 6.

57
 Chapter 4: Working with Clips
Stabilizing Clips
Sometimes, you want your video to be a bit jumpy, but those instances are 
certain to be intentional: conveying the sense of travelling over an uneven 
surface or simulating an earthquake are good examples of intentional 
shakiness. As a rule, though, you want a nice, steady frame of reference, 
where your subjects don’t appear to have itching powder in their underwear. 
In Chapter 2, we recommended obviating the problem by using a tripod or 
Steadicam device. Lacking the availability of said equipment, iMovie features 
a stabilization adjustment that can (almost) make up for their absence. 
We qualify that with an “almost” because software can only work with the 
footage that’s there. If your camera was shaking, you’re prone to lose 
between “some” and “a lot” around the edges as the stabilized frames are 
constructed. With a camera that’s stabilized in the first place, you get your 
full frame, every frame.
As we saw in Chapter 2, whenever you import material into iMovie, you’re 
prompted about analyzing the video for stabilization. Figure 4-10 reprises the 
dialog you get before importing from a USB video camera, where you can see 
the check box asking whether to analyze.
After importing the video, iMovie presents a progress dialog while perfor-
ming the analysis. Analyzing the video can be quite time-consuming — our 
informal tests showed slightly more than 5 minutes were required to analyze 
the 1 minute, 15 second clip from Figure 4-10. Other analyses we performed 
also yielded a 4:1 ratio of time spent analyzing versus length of clip on a 
2.1GHz Core2Duo MacBook with 2GB of RAM. Thus, if you’re going to import 
45 minutes of video on a similarly configured system, plan on the analysis 
taking about 3 hours.
Figure 4-10: 
If this 
check box 
is selected, 
you’re 
asked 
whether to 
analyze for 
stabilization 
at every 
import.
 

58
Part I: Pre-Production and Getting Started 
And that length of time is for just the analysis. The actual stabilization isn’t 
performed until you add the video to a project, as shown in the Inspector 
for our example clip, displayed in Figure 4-11. (Just to allay any concerns, 
the actual stabilization process when you add the clip to a project is hardly 
discernable.) We cover projects in Chapter 5.

Part II
Doing a Rough Cut

In this part . . .
I
n these four chapters, we cover the following topics:
 
✓ Chapter 5 gets you started working with iMovie’s 
Project Library, creating projects, adding clips to a 
project, and organizing the clips in a project.
 
✓ Chapter 6 introduces iMovie’s basic editing tools.
 
✓ Chapter 7 shows you how to work with still images 
in iMovie, including those photos you bring in from 
iPhoto and those that you create from frames in your 
video.
 
✓ Chapter 8 discusses iMovie’s Themes, which are the 
supplied sets of transitions and titles that can give you 
a head start on presenting your movie.

Creating a Project
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering iMovie Projects
▶ Creating a Project
▶ Browsing the Project
▶ Sharing Events between Projects
W
hen we talk about projects in this book, we aren’t using a polite 
euphemism for public housing. All your iMovie content exists in your 
Event Library, ready for use in your creative endeavors that we call movies. 
Hollywood doesn’t call them movies or motion pictures, however, until they’re 
released for public consumption (usually hyped beyond rational belief). Until 
the movie’s release, however, the Industry calls them projects. When two 
directors meet, “What’s your latest project?” is a question almost 
guaranteed to arise. Similarly, actors instruct their agents to 
find them a “good project.”
We tend to think of a movie project in a manner 
similar to the way a Hollywood studio does: as the 
planning, scripting, casting, shooting, editing, and 
so forth that goes into producing our end result: 
a movie.
In this chapter, we explore what a project is, how 
to create a project, how to browse a project’s con-
tent, and how to change default settings for a proj-
ect. Additionally, we discuss how the Event Library 
lets you share clips between projects.
What Is an iMovie Project?
When iMovie uses the word Project, the definition is much narrower 
than ours (or that of a movie studio). To iMovie, a project is where you 
assemble the video from your Event Library that you’re going to transform 
into a movie.

Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
The project is also where you add titles and transitions, apply special effects, 
tweak the audio, adjust the color, and make the edits that help your video tell 
the story you want told.
 
The adjustments made to your Project’s video are local to that Project. This 
means that the adjustments you make while working on your Project don’t 
appear in other Projects using that footage, nor are they reflected in the 
Event Library (the original footage’s repository). This is called non-destructive 
editing: no matter how much you slice and dice and otherwise modify the 
video in a Project, the original footage remains intact.
Creating a Project
Your Project Library is seldom completely empty. The first time you launch 
iMovie, an unpopulated Project called My First Project resides in the Project 
Library, just waiting for your clips to move into the neighborhood, as shown 
in Figure 5-1. (Okay, so the housing project metaphor can be abused here.) If 
you delete all your completed projects and don’t create a new one before you 
quit from iMovie, iMovie creates a My First Project placeholder the next time 
it runs. Therefore, the only way to have an empty Project Library is to delete 
all the projects, but the Project Library only stays empty until you quit.
 
If you ever wonder whether you’re in the Project Library view or the Edit 
Project view, just check out the arrow: The view you’re not in is the one 
named inside the arrow. Also, if the title bar just says Project Library, that’s 
the view you’re in. When you are editing a project, the Edit Project view’s 
title bar includes the name of the project on which you’re working; for 
example, Project – My Coffee Break with Andre.
Figure 5-1:

63
 Chapter 5: Creating a Project
You can create a new Project in two ways:
 
✓ Choose File➪New Project (or press its keyboard equivalent, Ô+N).
 
✓ Click the New Project button (the plus sign) at the bottom-right of the 
Project Library’s pane.
In either case, iMovie displays the dialog shown in Figure 5-2, where you set 
some project properties, as follows:
 
✓ Give your project a name in the Project Name text box.
 
✓ Choose the aspect ratio from the aptly named Aspect Ratio pop-up 
menu. Your choices are Widescreen (16:9), Standard (4:3), and 
iPhone (3:2).
 
 Each aspect ratio is targeted at a specific common screen type. When 
the aspect ratios don’t match, you see black bars either at each side 
of the video (pillarboxed), or at the top and bottom (letterboxed). 
Additionally, in the iMovie workspace, changing the aspect ratio resizes 
the Viewer pane, which in turn resizes the Project Library (or Event 
Library) pane to the Viewer’s left.
 
✓ Choose a theme to set default styles and transitions for your movie, 
based upon professionally designed themes provided by Apple. We 
discuss themes in much greater detail in Chapter 8. The default theme 
setting for a new project is no theme at all.
 
✓ Specify whether you want iMovie to automatically add a transition 
between your clips by selecting the Automatically Add check box and 
then choosing your favorite transition from the adjoining pop-up menu.
 
✓ Click Create when you have everything the way you want it.

64
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
The subtle arrow outline in the Project Library’s title bar (in the upper left 
of Figure 5-1) may have escaped your notice. Clicking in it moves you back 
and forth between the Edit Project view, where you work on the current 
project, and Project Library view, where you select the project on which you 
want to work.
Now that you’ve created a project, you’re ready to move your favorite footage 
into said project. Select the clip or clips you want in the Event Library and 
drag them into the Project Library. A green vertical bar appears in the Project 
Library where the first selected clip comes to rest. An orange horizontal bar 
appears at the bottom of frames in the Event Library when they’re being used 
in a project, as shown in Figure 5-3.
A red squiggle appears near the bottom of any footage that was too shaky for 
iMovie to stabilize, as shown in Figure 5-4. Once again, we urge you to use a 
tripod or other stabilizing hardware when shooting whenever possible. 
Otherwise, it’s really easy to record video that is too erratic for iMovie’s 
stabilization routines. If you look back at Figure 5-3, you can see a new 
button at the bottom of the Event Library to hide or show clip segments that 
are too shaky to stabilize: The red squiggle indicates that they’re shown, a 
gray squiggle means they’re hidden. If you don’t want the shaky video to be 
moved to the project, hide the shaky video before dragging your video. 
Hiding the shaky video effectively splits the clip at the boundaries of the 
shaky sections, turning one clip into two, or three, or more clips, depending 
on the number of shaky sections that are hidden.
 
Be aware that hiding the shaky video can produce some discontinuity in your 
footage. You have to decide whether having some shaky video is worth it to 
include all the action and dialogue in your movie.
Note also that hiding shaky video in an Event clip after you add it to a Project 
does not affect the video in the Project. If the video had shaky sections when 
you added it to the Project, the shaky sections remain even after you hide 
them in the Event library.

Although dragging your clips into the Project is the simplest and most 
straightforward method of adding clips to your project for most occasions, 
iMovie provides another option via its Add to Project button. Proceed as 
follows:
 
1. Select the frames you want to add to your project.
 
 
2. Click the Add Selection to Project button (shown in the margin) or 
press E.
 
 iMovie adds the selection to the end of your project.
 
Because the selection is added at the end of the project, you may need to 
then move it to its proper position in the video sequence.
 
If you are going to move many different sequences into your project, you 
might want to turn on Advanced Tools in iMovie Preferences’ General pane, 
as shown in Figure 5-5. Then, when you click the Add to Project button, it 
stays selected and you can make selection after selection, each of which is 
added to the end of the project, without having to click the button or press 
E each time.

Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
Changing a Project’s defaults
You can rename the Project by double-clicking its name in the Project Library 
and typing a new name. You can also revisit the other settings at any time by 
choosing File➪Project Properties (Ô+J), or by right-clicking in the Project 
Library and choosing Project Properties from the contextual menu that 
appears. (You can also right-click in a Project Browser pane to display the 
Project Properties dialog.) The Project Properties dialog drops down out of 
the title bar, as shown in Figure 5-6. The General pane is virtually identical to 
the New Project dialog, as you can see by comparing Figures 5-2 and 5-6.
Figure 5-6: 
The Project 
Properties 
General 
pane lets 
you change 
your mind 
about what 
you set 
in New 
Project.
 
 
When iMovie creates a My First Project, you don’t see the New Project dialog, 
and all the settings are defaults: The name is My First Project, the aspect ratio 
is Widescreen, the Theme is None, and automatic transitions are not in effect. 
If that’s not what you want, you don’t have to create a new project: Just press 
Ô+J to display the Project Properties dialog and make any desired changes.
Browsing the Project
While working on your project, you’re going to find yourself going back and 
forth through your video, checking for material you want to edit, places 
where you want to add audio or titles, or points where you want to insert 
additional content. Last, but far from least, you’ll want to play your video to 
check out how well you’re doing in molding your movie.

67
 Chapter 5: Creating a Project
iMovie offers numerous ways to play your video, most of which are most 
easily accomplished with one finger on the keyboard, as described in the 
following list:
 
✓ View➪Play. The keyboard shortcut is to press Space. Pressing Space 
starts your video playing from the playhead location. If you haven’t 
positioned the playhead, your project starts playing from the beginning.
 
✓ View➪Play Selection. The keyboard shortcut is to press / (slash). If you 
haven’t made a selection, play commences from the project’s beginning.
 
✓ View➪Play from Beginning. The keyboard shortcut is to press 
\ (backslash).
 
✓ View➪Play Around Current Frame➪1 Second and View➪Play Around 
Current Frame➪3 Seconds. The keyboard shortcuts are [ and ] (left and 
right square bracket), respectively. The current frame is a somewhat 
nebulous concept. When you have selected something, the current frame 
is the first frame of the selection. Lacking a selection, the current frame is 
the first frame of the segment of the specified length centered around the 
playhead.
 
✓ Click the Play button at the bottom of the Project Library pane. This is 
equivalent to pressing Space.
 
You can freeze the playhead’s position by pressing Control before moving 
the cursor to the menu bar or Play button, but pressing the keyboard 
shortcut is much more efficient.
 
 We recommend using the Swap Events and Projects button (see the margin) 
to place the Projects pane in the iMovie workspace’s more spacious bottom 
 
 pane when you’re working on a project, and switching them back to the 
defaults when you’re working in the Event Library.
Sharing Events between Projects
The most memorable real-life events may be once-in-a-lifetime occurrences, 
but the best iMovie Events are the ones you can reuse across multiple 
Projects.
As we noted earlier in this chapter, Event footage that has been added to a 
Project sports an orange line along the bottom in the Event Library’s clips 
pane. As long as the frames in question are used in at least one project on 
your Mac, that line remains. When the line disappears, you know that it’s safe 
to archive and delete the footage, if you wish, or make permanent changes.

68
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
 
Changes made to video in a project exist only in that project. An Event’s 
video can appear in multiple projects with different adjustments, titles, 
and so on. This is why, for example, that you analyze Event video for stabili-
zation, but iMovie doesn’t actually stabilize the footage until it’s in a project: 
The same Event video in different projects can have different stabilization 
settings. We cover basic editing in Chapter 6 and transitions and advanced 
editing in Part III.

S
ay you have all kinds of raw material at your disposal, just waiting to 
be used in your magnum opus. But as you peruse your source material, 
you realize that using everything makes your movie too long and that some 
of the footage has dull colors, poor audio, or is just plain not of the 
quality you demand. Finally, you decide that you need to 
add narration or background audio to some frames to 
introduce what’s going on or set a mood.
iMovie lets you perform the modifications necessary 
to resolve the above issues, up to a point. iMovie 
lets you trim, polish, and adorn your video, but 
even iMovie isn’t an alchemist: You can’t use it to 
turn lead into gold and it won’t help you turn bad 
footage into an Oscar-worthy movie or documen-
tary. Remember, even Hitchcock and Spielberg 
have produced some clunkers when the acting or 
script weren’t up to par, but those movies would 
have been far worse without their expert touch.
In this chapter, we introduce you to iMovie’s Advanced 
Tools, the use of keywords to identify and classify clips, 
trimming and editing clips in your project, and adjusting the color 
and audio in your project.

Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
Introducing iMovie’s Advanced Tools
Apple calls these tools “Advanced,” but we think that they relieve the 
drudgery and simplify assembling our movies. To turn on Advanced Tools, 
proceed as follows:
 
1. Choose iMovie➪Preferences, or press the keyboard equivalent, Ô+, 
(comma).
 
2. If the General pane is not selected, click the General icon in the 
toolbar.
 
3. Select the Show Advanced Tools check box, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
4. Click the iMovie Preferences window’s close button (or press Ô+W).
Figure 6-1: 
Turn on 
Advanced 
Tools in the 
General 
Preferences 
pane.
 
Your toolbar sprouts a couple of new buttons, an Arrow button and a 
Keywords button, as well as a Show or Hide Keyword Filtering pane button 
beneath the Event Library. You can see these buttons in Figure 6-2. Advanced 
Tools also modifies the operation of the Add to Project button, the Mark as 
Favorite button, the Unmark button, and the Reject button.
Normally (that is, when you haven’t turned on Advanced Tools), you make a 
selection and then click the button for the action you wish to perform. When 
Advanced Tools are active, you click the button for the desired tool and then 
make selections until you’re done with the tool, at which point you click the 
Arrow button to turn the tool off. Deselecting the tools is the only function 
the Arrow button performs: Think of it as an “off” switch.
If you make a selection in the Event Library before selecting a tool while 
using Advanced Tools, you see the Add to Project, Mark as Favorite, Unmark, 
and Reject buttons sprout plus (+) signs in their upper-right corners, as 

71
 Chapter 6: Video Editing Basics
shown in Figure 6-3. When the + signs are present, Advanced Tool mode 
is suspended, and the toolbar buttons revert to their normal behavior. 
Apple refers to this behavior as the dual mode toolbar. To resume Advanced 
Tools operation, click anywhere in the gray areas of the Event Library or 
Project Library, which deselects anything that was selected, and the plus 
signs disappear.
Why does iMovie use a plus sign to indicate that Advanced Tools is sus-
pended? It seems, at least to us, that a minus sign would be more appropriate. 
The first time Dennis saw the Advanced Tools, he happened to have an active 
selection, so he thought the plus sign indicated some additional (that is, more 
advanced) capability, until he found the explanation in iMovie Help. Nope: It’s 
just an iMovie quirk for which we really don’t know the explanation.

Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
Discovering the Keywords dialog
Apple evidently intended iMovie’s keywords functionality to be analogous 
to the one in iPhoto as a way to indicate categories for your footage. The 
pre-supplied keywords are Indoor, Outdoor, Landscape, Closeup, Wide Angle, 
People, and Pets. Click the Keywords button in the toolbar to display the 
Keywords dialog shown in Figure 6-4. Click the tab for the pane you want 
near the top of the Inspector.
 
Footage with one or more associated keywords sports a light blue (or dare 
we say, aqua) bar near the top.
Add your own keywords to the list by typing the new keyword in the New 
Keyword text box at the bottom of the Keywords Auto-Apply pane, or by 
making a selection and then typing the new keyword in the Keyword text box 
at the bottom left of the Keywords Inspector.
 
You can reorder the list in the Keywords dialog by selecting a keyword and 
dragging it to the new position — a blue line tracks your drag, showing you 
where the repositioned keyword will be. Because the numeric keyboard 
shortcuts (listed at the right of the rows) apply to only the first 9 items in 
the list, placing your most frequently used keywords at or near the top of 
the list makes them more accessible. Reordering performed in either pane 
is reflected in the other. Notice that the keyboard shortcuts are still sequen-
tial, so if you drag Pets to the second position on the list, its shortcut 
changes from 7 to 2. The shortcuts for Outdoor through People change in 
increments of 1.
If you intend to tag a number of frame sequences with the same keywords, 
select those keywords in the Auto-Apply pane and then start selecting your 
footage. All selected keywords are automatically associated with the video.

dialog. The 
Auto-Apply 
pane is 
on the left 
and the 
Inspector 
pane is on

73
 Chapter 6: Video Editing Basics
Alternatively, if you wish to apply keywords on an ad hoc basis as you skim 
through your video, proceed as follows:
 
1. Select your footage.
 
2. Open the Keywords Inspector by clicking the Keywords toolbar 
button.
 
3. Select the check boxes for keywords you want applied.
 
 iMovie shows a minus sign in the check boxes of any keywords currently 
applied to part, but not all, of the footage, and a check mark in the boxes 
where the keyword applies to the whole selection.
 
4. Click Add to Clip.
 
 Pressing Option while clicking a keyword in the Auto-Apply Inspector 
applies the keyword to the entire clip, which saves you from having to 
drag-select the entire clip.
 
If you want to remove all keywords from selected frames, press 0 (zero). This 
method is a lot faster than showing the Keywords Inspector, selecting all the 
check boxes, and clicking the Remove All button.
Filtering by keyword
Although you can certainly follow Apple’s lead in how to use keywords, we’d 
be remiss if we didn’t give you some food for thought about additional ways 
to exploit the keyword functionality. In Chapter 3, we mention that you can 
use keywords to identify blooper-reel material so that, when it comes time 
to create your blooper reel project, you can easily find all the blooper reel 
footage and click Add to Project. Assuming that you have already associated 
the Blooper keyword with your designated frames, here’s how to proceed:
 
1. Click the Show Filter by Keywords button to display the Filter by 
Keyword pane, as shown in Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-5: 
Show the 
Filter by 
Keyword 
pane to find 
your tagged 
footage.
 

74
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
 
2. Select the keyword or keywords for which you want to find the tagged 
frames and select the green (right) side of the button next to the 
keyword’s name in the Filter by Keyword pane.
 
 You can exclude video tagged with a keyword from the footage searched 
by clicking the red (left) side of the lozenge-shaped button to the left of 
the keyword. You might do this, for example, when you want to find 
scenes tagged as Outdoor that aren’t candidates for the blooper reel: 
Exclude the Blooper keyword and then filter for Outdoor scenes. You 
might also want to exclude all blooper reel material from the selected 
footage so that you can add the remainder to your project.
 
3. Click the Any button at the bottom of the Filter by Keyword pane if 
you want to find all frames tagged with any of the selected keywords 
(an “or” search). Click the All button if you wish to find the frames 
that have every selected keyword applied (an “and” search).
 
 The clips pane to the right displays the footage your filter identifies.
 
At the time we’re writing this, there is an anomaly (that’s polite talk for “bug”) 
in the Filter by Keyword pane’s operation. The first keyword to appear in the 
list allows only the red side (the “not” side) to be selected, so you can only 
exclude footage with that keyword. Our temporary workaround is to create a 
dummy keyword, which we call “00placeholder” because iMovie presents the 
Filter by Keywords pane’s entries in alphanumeric order. Then, we just don’t 
tag any footage with it, nor do we include it in any of our filters. Hopefully, 
Apple fixes this problem by the time you read this material, but if not, you 
now have a workaround.
Previewing Your Clips
We covered viewing your clips in Chapter 4, but that was to discover the 
available techniques and to get a general sense of what you have in your 
Events. Here, you’ve selected the footage you want and included it in your 
project. Now, you’re going to start transforming this collection of clips into 
the story you want to tell.
Sourcing material from different Events
One common example of pulling footage from different Events is for the 
venerable “highlight reel.” Whether you’re compiling “Best of” moments for 
your holiday video to friends and family (the 21st century version of the 
traditional Christmas letter) or a “funniest moments” short taken from your 
kids’ antics and activities over the years, you will find yourself extracting 
clips from different Events.

75
 Chapter 6: Video Editing Basics
You might have an urge to combine Events to more closely parallel your 
projects. Please restrain yourself if there is any possibility that you might 
want to use footage from one of the Events in more than one project, such as 
the main project for which it was intended as well as a highlights video or 
some other compilation.
 
iMovie makes it very easy to select your clips from multiple Events, espe-
cially if you make use of keywords as described earlier in this chapter. 
Tag your footage, select all the Events in question, and then use Filter by 
Keyword to collect the video from multiple Events to add to your project 
with one click of the Add to Project button (or one press of the E key).
Arranging your footage
When new clips are added to a project, they’re added to the end. While 
you’re skimming through your video, keep an eye out for where the new 
clips actually belong. Move the clips into position and then preview again to 
see what else, if anything, needs to be done. For example, you might decide 
you need a title to introduce the scene or a transition into the clip (see 
Chapter 9 for coverage of titles and transitions). Or, you might decide that 
you want to trim a few frames off one end or the other: We almost always 
have a few seconds of extra footage at either end of our clips, as discussed in 
Chapter 2, to make sure that we don’t start filming too late or stop too soon. 
It is always easy to trim what isn’t needed, but well-nigh impossible to fill in 
for something that just doesn’t exist!
 
You can drag footage from the Event Library and position it precisely within 
existing footage. When you drag the footage to the desired position and 
release the mouse button, you see the preceding menu. Choose the option 
you wish by clicking it. The Cutaway, Picture in Picture, and Green Screen 
choices might not be immediately obvious, but we discuss them in more 
detail in Chapter 10.

76
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
Adjusting Your Video
iMovie’s non-destructive editing really makes your job easier when it comes 
to trimming clips, performing color adjustments, and so forth. iMovie offers a 
number of adjustment possibilities: They are performed, as is the case with 
most of Apple’s software, in the Inspector. You can invoke the Inspector in a 
number of ways. The most common ways to do so are
 
✓ Double-click in a clip. The Inspector appears, as shown in Figure 6-6. If 
you are working with video that has a different aspect ratio than the 
project, the Clip Inspector tells you that you have to convert the clip 
before you can apply a speed adjustment.
 
 
✓ Click the Inspector button in the toolbar (seen here in the margin).
 
 
✓ Choose Window➪Clip Adjustments, Window➪Video Adjustments, 
or Window➪Audio Adjustments, or their respective keyboard shortcuts: 
I, V, or A.
 
Personally, we’re partial to the keyboard shortcuts and double-clicking as 
the fastest and easiest methods of accessing the Inspector. The keyboard 
shortcuts are especially efficient because they take you directly to the 
Inspector pane you want. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts to switch 
between Inspector panes while the Inspector is open.
Figure 6-6:

Inspector’s 
Clip pane

verting the 
clip (left), 
and after 
(right).
 
Exploring clip adjustments
When working with project clips, the Clip Inspector has four sections: 
Duration, Video Effect, Speed, and Stabilization.
 
Working with project clips differs from working with Event clips. Changes 
made to clips in the Event Browser carry over into any project that uses 
those clips, but editing performed in a project is local to that project.

77
 Chapter 6: Video Editing Basics
The Duration section is intended primarily for setting the duration of still 
images (such as photos) added to your project, and we talk about that in 
more detail in Chapter 7. For video, typing a new duration shortens the clip 
to the specified length by truncating — if you type a duration longer than 
the source clip’s length, iMovie sets the duration back to the source clip’s 
duration.
Clicking the Video Effect button rotates the Inspector to display the Choose 
Video Effect dialog shown in Figure 6-7. The thumbnails represent the effect 
applied to your clip; you can also preview the effect in the Viewer as you 
skim across the thumbnail. Return to the Clip Inspector by clicking the effect 
you want or by clicking Cancel (pressing Esc is the same as clicking Cancel).
The effect you choose is visible in the Viewer when previewing your footage, 
but the only indication that an effect has been applied to a clip is a small 
circled i Inspector badge in the upper-left corner of the clip’s initial thumb-
nail, as shown in Figure 6-8. And, to make the visual effect’s presence even 
less obvious, the badge is only visible when the clip is selected and the play-
head is in the clip. We cover Video Effects in much more detail in Chapter 9.
The Speed section is where you speed up or slow down your video (fast 
action and slo-mo) or reverse a clip’s direction so that it plays backward. You 
can combine reverse direction with either fast- or slo-mo. Use the slider or 
the text boxes visible in Figure 6-6 (on the right) to adjust the clip’s speed 
either by a percentage (top text box) or to make it fit in a specified duration 
(bottom text box). Not to belabor the obvious, select the Reverse check box 
to make your clip play backward.

The Stabilization section lets you specify that iMovie should attempt to 
smooth the motion in shaky video. Additionally, if the clip hasn’t yet been 
analyzed for stabilization, selecting the Smooth clip motion check box 
initiates the analysis.
Adjusting your video’s color
Open the Video Inspector by pressing V, choosing Window➪Video 
Adjustments, or (if the Inspector is open) by clicking the Inspector’s Video 
tab. When it’s open, you see the large and colorful Inspector shown in 
Figure 6-9.

Histogram Highlights slider

79
 Chapter 6: Video Editing Basics
For those of you familiar with iPhoto’s adjustment tools (or Photoshop’s), 
using the Video Inspector should be a very comfortable exercise. The 
histogram (the graph at the top), displays the levels of red, green, and blue in 
your frame’s shadows (left), midtones (center), and highlights (right).
For those of you as yet unfamiliar with the tools presented here, we offer this 
brief rundown:
 
✓ The Histogram Highlights slider: This slider is the one on the right with 
the white bar below the triangle. Use it to narrow the range between 
shadows and highlights, thus spreading the colors out more. Moving the 
shadow slider to the right darkens the image; moving the highlights 
slider to the left lightens the image. This is called a Levels adjustment.
 
 Alternatively, you can let iMovie take its best shot at making the adjust-
ment by clicking the Auto button at the bottom of the Video Inspector.
 
✓ Exposure: Drag this slider to the left to darken the shadows or to the 
right to intensify the highlights.
 
✓ Brightness: Dragging Brightness to the left darkens the image and drag-
ging it to the right brightens the image.
 
✓ Contrast: Dragging Contrast to the right increases the range between 
the darkest and lightest colors (intensifying the edges between light 
and dark areas), whereas dragging to the left reduces the range of colors 
between the darkest and lightest (making the edges less distinct).
 
✓ Saturation: Dragging Saturation to the left drains the color from an 
image, reducing it to a grayscale rendition, whereas dragging to the right 
intensifies the image’s colors.
 
✓ Red, Green, and Blue Gain: Visible only when you have Advanced 
Tools enabled, these sliders let you dull (left) or intensify (right) each 
component color individually.
 
✓ White Point: Clicking in the color wheel tells iMovie to make the clicked 
color a new white point, thus changing all the colors accordingly. 
You can also set a new white point by clicking on an appropriate white 
(or gray) area in the Viewer, which is our recommended method. 
Changing the white point is especially useful in removing color casts 
that arise when the camera is not adjusted for the type of lighting in use 
(for example, incandescent lighting tends toward an orange cast and 
natural sunlight tends toward a blue cast).
Again, thanks to iMovie’s non-destructive editing, if you don’t like the results of your 
changes, you can always revert the video to its original color state, simply by clicking 
Revert to Original at the bottom-left of the Video Inspector.

80
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
Making audio adjustments
No matter how much we (or you) discuss iMovie as a video tool, you need 
to remember that without audio, we’d be back in the days of silent pictures. 
(Actually, we’d be back in the zoetrope or nickelodeon era: As soon as 
motion pictures got into theaters, the theater owners had pianists playing 
mood music to fit the current scenes.) Dialogue, sound effects, and back-
ground music are critical aspects of a successful modern movie.
Display the Audio Inspector by choosing Window➪Audio Adjustments, 
pressing A, or (if the Inspector is already open) by clicking the Audio tab. 
The Audio Inspector is shown in Figure 6-10.
Figure 6-10: 
Adjust your 
selection’s 
audio here.
 
The Audio Inspector offers the following adjustments:
 
✓ Volume: The volume adjustment is intuitively obvious. You drag the 
slider to the left to reduce the volume (0 percent is Mute) or to the right 
to increase the volume, up to a maximum of 200 percent.
 
✓ Ducking: iMovie lets you have multiple audio tracks — for example, 
sound effects, background music, or narration — playing simultaneously 
with your video’s actual audio. This is accomplished by lowering the 
volume of other tracks, also known as ducking. Click the Reduce Volume 
of Other Tracks check box to turn ducking on. By default, other tracks 
have their volume reduced to 15 percent of normal. You can adjust the 
amount of ducking with the slider.
 
 The term ducking is a piece of jargon from the pop music business. 
We find it a little odd that Apple chose to use this term, but has so 
strenuously endeavored to remove other bits of industry jargon from 
iMovie. For example, they say skimming instead of scrubbing, pointer 
instead of playhead (which is especially confusing given all of the other 
uses for pointer), and so forth.

81
 Chapter 6: Video Editing Basics
 
✓ Fade In/Fade Out: By default, audio ramps up from 0 to full volume in 
the first half-second of a clip (15 frames for NTSC or ATSC) and down 
from 100 percent to Mute in the last half-second. Selecting the Automatic 
radio button employs the default. To take control, either click the 
Manual radio button and adjust the slider from 0 frames to 2 seconds, 
or just drag the slider, which automatically selects the Manual radio 
button (pun intended).
 
✓ Normalize Clip Volume: This adjustment is specifically meant for 
situations where you have multiple clips selected and the volume varies 
significantly between them. Click Normalize Clip Volume and iMovie 
adjusts the respective sound levels until they are approximately equal. 
You can select clips and click Remove Normalization to revert a clip’s 
volume.
 
 Clips with audio adjustments applied sport a small speaker badge in their 
upper-left corner when they are selected, as shown in the margin. You can 
double-click the badge to go immediately to the Audio Inspector.

Working with Stills

▶ Cropping still images
▶ Resizing still images to fit
▶ Using the Ken Burns Effect
▶ Adjusting still duration
S
peaking of stills, we’ll take a jug of that White Lightning, please . . . 
whoops, wrong kind of still. From the early zoetropes and kinetoscopes 
through to today’s IMAX and Blu-Ray, video really boils down to a series of 
still images passing so quickly through our vision that our minds perceive 
continuous motion.
Still images, however, still have value in movies beyond 
their fleeting passage as a frame of video. Numerous 
movies (for example, Hello, Dolly!) and TV shows (such 
as NCIS) have employed frozen images to lead into a 
scene or close out a scene, or both. Ken Burns’s 
documentaries on PBS, where still images of his-
toric events are brought to life through panning 
and zooming, did a lot to popularize the documen-
tary far beyond PBS’s normal audience. Using 
iMovie’s Ken Burns Effect, you can achieve the 
same effects in your movies.
Another common use of still images in video is the 
“news commentary,” where a photograph fills the 
screen while audio commentary continues. Yet another 
is the venerable slideshow, a staple in so many pieces of 
software (iPhoto, iDVD, Photoshop, Keynote, and others ad 
nauseum).

Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
As you make more movies, or even as you watch more movies and television 
with an eye toward how they are put together, you will find all sorts of 
situations where a still image is just what the producer prescribed. In this 
chapter, we fill you in on iMovie’s still image toolbox.
Extracting a Frame for Use As a Still
As we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, a frozen frame to 
introduce or conclude a scene is an often-used and very effective technique. 
Extracted still frames are called freeze frames because they present a 
moment frozen in time. To freeze a frame of your video project, proceed as 
follows:
 
1. Position the playhead at the frame you want to extract.
 
2. Hold down the Control key and click to display the contextual menu 
shown in Figure 7-1.
 
3. Choose Add Freeze Frame from the menu.
 
 iMovie creates a four-second still clip at the playhead’s position.
You could also right-click to present the contextual menu in Step 2, but you 
then risk accidentally clicking on a frame other than the one you want to 
freeze. Pressing Control locks the playhead while you move your mouse 
pointer. (This is the first time Dennis recalls encountering a situation where 
Control-clicking is clearly preferable to right-clicking.) The fact that you need 
to press Control to lock the playhead’s position anyway is probably the 
rationale for having Freeze Frame available only via a contextual menu.
Figure 7-1: 
Choose 
Freeze 
Frame to 
create your 
still clip.
 

85
 Chapter 7: Working with Stills
If you want to add a freeze frame from your Event Library to your project, the 
following steps walk you through the (rather short) process:
 
1. Position the playhead at the frame you want in the Event Browser.
 
2. Hold down the Control key and click to display the contextual menu 
shown in Figure 7-2.
Figure 7-2: 
Choose Add 
Still Frame 
to Project 
to bring a 
frame from 
your Event 
Library into 
the project.
 
 
3. Choose Add Still Frame to Project from the menu.
 
 iMovie adds a four-second still frame clip to the end of your project. Feel 
free to position it where you want it, as described in Chapter 6.
 
When you add a still frame clip to your project using the preceding steps, 
iMovie automatically applies the Ken Burns Effect to the clip. To convert the 
clip to a true freeze frame, you need to remove the Ken Burns Effect. We 
explain more about this effect later in this chapter in the section, “Applying 
the Ken Burns Effect.”
 
If you want a freeze frame duration other than four seconds, you can change 
the still clip’s length in the Clip Inspector, as we describe later in this chapter 
in the section, “Adjusting Duration.”
One technique frequently employed with freeze frames is to apply a video 
effect, such as Black & White or Sepia, in the Clip Inspector and to either play 
a short riff as audio accompaniment to set the mood or to start playing the 
background music during the freeze frame and continuing it into the actual 
video. Experiment with variations of this technique to see what best suits 
your artistic vision. We cover iMovie’s Video Effects in Chapter 9, in case you 
want to jump ahead.

86
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
Adding a Still Image to Your Project
iLife’s integration provides a service available to other applications on 
your Mac — the Media Browser. Through the Media Browser, you can access 
the content in your iTunes and iPhoto Libraries, as well as GarageBand 
and iMovie projects in whatever program you’re running (so long as its 
developers included Media Browser support, for example, Apple’s iWork 
suite of applications, Roxio Toast Titanium, and Disc Cover).
 
 Click the Photos button (shown in the margin) in the iMovie workspace’s 
toolbar, and iMovie opens the Media Browser pane in the lower-right corner 
of the workspace, as shown in Figure 7-3.
If the disclosure triangle to the left of the iPhoto item is pointing to the right, 
click it (the triangle now points down) and your iPhoto Library’s Events, 
Photos, and albums — both regular and smart albums — appear in the pane. 
If you select Events, you can skim the cursor over the thumbnails at the 
bottom of the Photos pane to get a preview of the photos in that Event. 
Double-click the Event to show thumbnails of all its photos in the bottom 
portion of the Photos pane (drag up or down on the dividing bar to reappor-
tion the space between the list and the thumbnail areas). Use the Search box 
at the bottom to locate photos based on name, keyword, or any other text-
based criterion (for example, Description) that you’ve entered in iPhoto. You 
can also use the check box and associated pop-up menu in the status bar 
below the Photos pane to restrict the display to photos whose dates fall 
within a specified date range around a selected Event. (Your choices are 
same date(s), within one day, within one week, and within one month.) The 
magnification slider to the pop-up’s right gives you control over the size of 
the thumbnails.

87
 Chapter 7: Working with Stills
Select the photo (or photos) you want and drag their thumbnails to your 
project.
Cropping (and Rotating) Stills
If you use still images in your projects, and we wager that most of you do so 
with varying degrees of frequency, you’re going to encounter situations where 
you only want to use part of the photo. Or maybe the photo you want to use 
has a portrait orientation when you want landscape to match the movie’s 
aspect ratio. You could go back to iPhoto (if that was the source of your image) 
and make changes, but iMovie also offers you cropping and rotation capabili-
ties, and it is all non-destructive, which means that you can continue to tweak 
the image within iMovie and not have to keep going back and forth between 
applications. The cropping and rotation tools are available in the Viewer, along 
with the Ken Burns Effect, which we cover later in this chapter.
As usual, iMovie offers you more than one way to make the crop, rotation, 
and Ken Burns Effect tools appear in the Viewer. These methods are
 
 
✓ Click the Crop, Rotate, and Ken Burns tool button in the iMovie toolbar. 
You can see the button in the margin.
 
 
✓ Choose Window➪Cropping, Ken Burns & Rotation.
 
✓ Double-click the crop badge at the upper left of the clip’s thumbnail in 
your project.
 
✓ Press the keyboard shortcut, C.
 
✓ Click a clip’s Action menu (the gear-like badge that appears when you 
hover your mouse pointer near the beginning of the clip) and choose 
Cropping, Ken Burns, & Rotation from the menu that appears.
Seven buttons now overlay the top of the Viewer pane, as shown in Figure 
7-4. From left to right, these buttons are:
 
✓ Fit: Click this button to have iMovie display the entire image within the 
frame. This usually results in letterboxing or pillarboxing the image.
 
✓ Crop: Click this button to display the green cropping box shown in 
Figure 7-5. Drag the corner handles to encompass the desired rectangle. 
iMovie keeps the rectangle’s aspect ratio the same as the project’s 
aspect ratio. Click inside the cropping box and drag to reposition it 
within the frame.

✓ Ken Burns: Use this to set start and end rectangles for the Ken Burns 
Effect, as discussed later in this chapter.
 
✓ Rotate counterclockwise: Rotate the image 90 degrees to the left.
 
✓ Rotate clockwise: Rotate the image 90 degrees to the right.
 
✓ Play clip: Does just what the name says.
 
✓ Done: Click this button when you’re finished with your editing task to 
accept the changes you’ve made.
 
Pressing Return or Enter is equivalent to clicking Done. Pressing Esc exits the 
tool, leaving things as they were before you selected it.
In a number of situations, you’ll find that you need to combine two or more 
of the capabilities this tool offers to achieve your desired presentation. For 
example, you have a portrait image that you haven’t yet rotated in iPhoto, 
so it’s still “laying on its side.” You also need to crop the image. You should 
proceed as follows:
 
1. Rotate the photo so that it is right-side up.

89
 Chapter 7: Working with Stills
 
2. Click the Fit button so that the whole image is presented in the frame 
and the default Ken Burns Effect is no longer in effect.
 
 You will find the image is now pillarboxed (has black bars at the left and 
right of the image).
 
3. Click the Crop button to display the cropping rectangle.
 
4. Drag the rectangle up or down so that it encloses the vertical portion 
of your photo that you want displayed.
 
5. (optional) Drag the cropping rectangle’s corners to hone in on an even 
smaller portion of the image.
 
Make certain that you leave enough pixels for your intended distribution 
medium. For example, if you’re targeting HDTV, iMovie prefers a resolution of 
at least 1920×1080; however, if your target is an iPod, 320×240 should suffice. 
You could crop to a smaller selection, but then iMovie has to scale the image 
up to fit your viewing frame. Scaling up video, just like scaling up images in 
iPhoto, often results in jagged or blurry video.
Applying the Ken Burns Effect
When Steve Jobs presented the first public demonstration of iMovie 3 at San 
Francisco’s 2003 Macworld Expo, the feature producing the greatest positive 
reaction was the Ken Burns Effect, a pan-and-zoom technique that actually 
predated Mr. Burns. Mr. Jobs most likely named it after Ken Burns due to 
Burns’ avid use of the technique in his PBS documentaries. We’re going to 
call it the KBE, at least during this discussion, to avoid wasting space by 
writing it out every time.
The KBE is used to give life, or, in other words, motion, to still images. The 
process involves selecting a starting rectangle and an ending rectangle within 
an image. The effect then pans and zooms to move from having the starting 
rectangle fill the screen to having the ending rectangle fill the screen. In most 
respects, it is analogous to the morphing of one shape into another, where 
you view the progress through intermediate shapes, and the KBE shows you 
the progress from one vantage point and visual focus to another. A couple of 
ways you can use the KBE are
 
✓ Zoom in or zoom out: To zoom in, set a large starting rectangle and a 
much smaller enclosed rectangle (generally centered within the large 
rectangle), as shown in Figure 7-6. Reverse the rectangles for a zoom-out 
effect. The starting rectangle is green and the ending rectangle is red.

90
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
 
✓ Pan across a row of people: Just because you’re working with a still 
image doesn’t mean that you can’t make your audience believe that 
you shot a clip panning across a group. Place your starting rectangle 
around the left end of the row and your ending rectangle around the 
right end for a left-to-right pan, as shown in Figure 7-7. Notice the helpful 
yellow arrow that iMovie displays, showing the motion’s direction.
iMovie places a few restrictions on the use of the KBE, the most notable 
being that the starting and ending rectangles must overlap on a left-to-right 
pan due to limitations on how small the rectangles are allowed to be. This 
means, for example, in the case of panning across a scene, that you can’t 
focus in too tightly. The result is that you can’t pan across the group one face 
at a time (unless the group is only two people).
 
Make use of the Play Clip button at the top of the Viewer to test your effect. If 
things aren’t quite right, adjust one or both rectangles and preview the clip 
again. Keep tweaking the rectangles until you have the best result available.
Combine the KBE with an opening freeze frame and you’ll come close to 
reproducing the scene openers in Donald Bellasario’s very popular NCIS 
television series.

 Chapter 7: Working with Stills
Adjusting Duration
By default, iMovie gives all still clips a four-second duration. Those of you 
who used versions of iMovie prior to iMovie ’08 might wonder why the 
default was changed from five seconds to four seconds. We wondered, too, 
but couldn’t get a response other than “Lots of users complained that five 
seconds was too long, but it doesn’t really matter — you can always set your 
own default for a project.” We can’t really find fault with that answer because 
one size doesn’t fit all and we do change the duration on almost a still-by-still 
basis. We tend to slow down long pans or zooms by making the duration 
longer and speed up any opening and closing freeze frames by shortening 
their durations. So, if you want a different default duration in your project, 
choose File➪Project Properties, click the Timing tab, and set the photo 
duration you prefer.
Here’s how to adjust a still clip’s duration:
 
1. Select the clip in the Project pane.
 
2. Open the Clip Inspector by double-clicking the clip, clicking the 
Inspector button in the toolbar, choosing Window➪Clip Adjustments, 
or pressing I.
 
 The Clip Inspector opens, as shown in Figure 7-8.
 
3. Type your new duration in the Duration text box.
 
 Remember that the duration you type should reflect the time display 
you’ve chosen. In other words, to get a 5 second duration, type 5 if your 
display is set up to show hh:mm:ss, but type 5:00 if it’s displaying 
hh:mm:ss:frames.
 
4. (Optional.) To change the durations of all stills in your project (and 
set a default for all new still clips), select the Applies to All Stills 
check box.
Figure 7-8: 
The Clip 
Inspector 
with a 
still clip 
selected.
 
 
Because selecting Applies to All Stills changes the durations of all existing 
stills, we recommend placing any stills you have that are going to obey the 
default duration first, and then deselecting the Applies to All Stills check box 
before placing and setting durations for any still clips that differ in duration.

Using Themes to Enhance 
Your Movie
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the available themes
▶ Picking a theme
▶ Working with themes
▶ Animating travel maps
A
s fourteenth-century filmmaker Geoffrey Chaucer once said after a long 
session in the editing room, “The lyf so short, the craft so long to 
lerne.” And it can take a long time to learn the craft of editing a movie.
That’s where iMovie themes come in. Themes provide your 
movie with opening and closing titles, provide specially 
designed transitions, and give your work a coherent 
visual design.
Understanding iMovie Themes
When you create a new project, you choose a 
theme for the project, as you saw in Chapter 5. To 
refresh your memory, Figure 8-1 shows you the New 
Project dialog again.
When we showed this dialog to you last time, we glossed 
over the most important part of it, at least as far as the 
amount of screen space it takes up: that group of six labeled 
squares in the center of the dialog that represent the available project 
themes.
As you can see in Figure 8-1, the default theme is no theme at all. If you have 
been playing around in iMovie as you’ve read through this book, that’s the 
theme you’ve most likely been using. But just what is a theme?

it before.
 
A theme is a template for the look of your movie. It includes an opening title, 
a set of customized transitions, a closing title, and a generalized recipe for 
combining and applying those elements to a movie.
For example, Figure 8-2 shows a very simple five-clip movie project that uses 
the None theme. Figure 8-3 shows the same project with the Comic Book 
theme applied.
Notice the colored bars above the clips at the beginning and the end of the 
themed movie, and the little squares between the clips that comprise the 
movie. The bars are title overlays and the squares are transitions.

95
 Chapter 8: Using Themes to Enhance Your Movie
You find out more — much more — about titles and transitions in Chapter 9, 
but here’s the short take:
 
✓ Theme titles: These insert video of the opening and closing clips into 
animated graphic frames. The graphic frames include text labels. A 
theme’s opening title by default displays the name of the project as the 
movie’s title. The closing title by default displays a director’s credit that 
uses the user name for the Mac OS X account in which iMovie is running, 
as shown in Figure 8-4. You can change the text if you want; see Chapter 
9 for how to edit the text of an iMovie title.
 
✓ Transitions: These provide a gradual visual shift between two adjacent 
clips rather than having the video image shift abruptly from one clip to 
the next. The lack of transition is called a jump cut.
The transitions that a theme provides come in two varieties:
 
 
✓ Standard cross-dissolve transitions: Cross-dissolves blend two clips 
together, so that final frames of one clip are overlaid on the opening 
frames of the next clip. As the transition plays, the frames of the first 
clip become more transparent while the frames of the next clip become 
more opaque. Unless you override iMovie’s default settings, the theme 
that you have selected controls how long the transition lasts — usually 
about half a second. Figure 8-5 shows a cross-dissolve midway through 
the transition.
 
 
✓ Theme-styled transitions: This transition selects individual frames from 
your movie and inserts them into an animated graphic that plays 
between the two clips. By default, theme-styled transitions usually take 
a couple of seconds to play. Figure 8-6 shows a theme-styled transition 
in the Comic Book theme. In the section, “Customizing Transitions in a 
Themed Project” later in this chapter, we explain how to select which 
frames in your movie are used in a theme-styled transition.

When you choose a theme, you specify whether iMovie adds automatic 
transitions to your movie. If you choose automatic transitions, you cannot 
edit them or add additional transitions to your movie. iMovie handles the 
transitions for you completely: That’s why they’re called “automatic.” Of 
course, you can turn off automatic transitions at any time and then edit those 
that have been added after you do.
In addition to the None theme, here are the five themes that iMovie ’09 
supplies:
 
✓ Photo Album
 
✓ Bulletin Board
 
✓ Comic Book
 
✓ Scrapbook
 
✓ Filmstrip

97
 Chapter 8: Using Themes to Enhance Your Movie
You can choose a theme when you create a project, or at any time while you 
are working on a project. And after you have chosen a theme, you are not 
wedded to it: You can change a movie’s theme at any time.
 
When you see a Themes dialog, such as the one shown in Figure 8-1, you can 
put your pointer over each theme thumbnail to get a preview of the theme’s 
visual style.
Applying Themes
You can add a theme to a project or change the current theme at any time. 
You can change a theme in any one of these ways:
 
✓ Choose File ➪ Project Properties (Ô+J).
 
✓ Right-click in the project pane and choose Project Properties.
 
✓ Click Set Theme in the Titles pane of the Media Browser.
 
✓ Click Set Theme in the Transitions pane of the Media Browser 
(see Figure 8-7).
When you choose Project Properties, the theme selection choices are 
included in the dialog with other project properties you can set, as shown in 
Figure 8-8.
When you apply a theme to an existing project that has the default None 
theme, the Automatically Add Transitions and Titles check box presents you 
with some choices when you select it. 
Figure 8-7: 
The 
Transitions 
pane of 
the Media 
Browser 
gives you 
theme 
control.
 

98
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
Figure 8-8: 
The Project 
Properties 
dialog 
includes 
theme 
choices.
 
Figure 8-9 shows the choices you have when you change from the default 
None theme to another theme and select the Automatically Add Transitions 
and Titles check box. You see a similar dialog whenever you change themes 
in a project that has clips without transitions and you choose to add 
automatic transitions.
Because the cross-dissolve transitions used in themes make use of the frames 
of two adjacent clips simultaneously, your movie becomes shorter by the 
duration of each cross-dissolve. That’s the default choice: Overlap Ends and 
Shorten Clip is selected.
Figure 8-9: 
This dialog 
appears 
when you

tically add

99
 Chapter 8: Using Themes to Enhance Your Movie
If you don’t want your movie to become shorter when you add a theme and 
choose automatic transitions and titles, however, iMovie can try to use 
footage from beyond the ends of adjacent clips in your movie for the transi-
tions. That’s what the second choice, Extend Ends and Maintain Duration 
(Where Possible), does. Of course, if you use an entire source clip in your 
movie, iMovie won’t be able to extend that clip’s duration, which is why 
iMovie adds the (Where Possible) codicil to the second choice.
Changing Themes
When your project has a theme (other than None) and you change the 
project’s theme, you can tell iMovie what to do with the titles and transitions 
it has already added.
 
When you change your project’s theme from one theme to another, and 
you continue to automatically add transitions and titles, you don’t need to 
make any other choices. iMovie automatically changes the theme transitions 
and titles to those used in the new theme. It’s like having a house redeco-
rated: the rooms and hallways remain exactly where they always were, but 
the furnishings, paint, wallpaper, and carpet change.
iMovie gives you the choices shown in Figure 8-10 if you deselect the 
Automatically Add Transitions and Titles check box.
Figure 8-10: 
Your 
choices 
when you 
decide not 
to automati-
cally add 
titles and 
transitions.
 
The choices are reasonably straightforward:
 
✓ Remove Transitions and Titles, Extending Clip Ends: You can have 
iMovie strip all transitions and titles from your movie and restore the 
clips in your project to their original lengths. You can still add theme 
titles and transitions manually to the project.

100
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
 
✓ Remove Transition and Titles, Maintaining Clip Durations: You can 
have iMovie strip the transitions and titles, but leave the clips in the 
project shortened by the amount they were made when the transitions 
were added originally. You might want to choose this option, for 
example, if you have overlaid audio that will be affected by a change 
in the movie’s length.
 
✓ Leave Transitions and Titles in Current Locations: You can leave 
everything that the theme added or changed intact. This means that 
your movie still has the theme’s look and feel, for the most part, but you 
are free to use other transitions and title styles in your movie as you 
continue to work. You can also modify the transitions and titles that the 
theme adds.
But what happens to your project if you change to the None theme from 
one of the other themes (in essence, remove the theme)? There are two 
possibilities:
 
✓ You can select the Automatically Add check box and choose a transition 
from the pop-up menu. This strips all the theme-based titles from your 
movie and puts the selected transition between each of your clips.
 
✓ You can deselect the Automatically Add check box. In that case, the 
theme-based titles are all removed, but you can make a choice about 
what to do with the transitions that iMovie has previously added to 
your project, as shown in Figure 8-11.
The first two choices are pretty self-explanatory. The third choice, however, 
has some subtle implications. It doesn’t, in fact, leave any of the theme-based 
transitions in your project — those get stripped out. But it does leave any 
cross-dissolve transitions already in place.
Figure 8-11: 
When you 
de-theme 
a project, 
you can

choices.
 
Customizing Themes
How much you can customize a theme depends on whether you have set it to 
automatically add titles and transitions.

101
 Chapter 8: Using Themes to Enhance Your Movie
In the case where you are running on automatic, as it were, you can add titles 
to any clip that doesn’t already have a title attached to it, and you can change 
the durations and frames used in the transitions that iMovie has put in place. 
Here’s what you can’t do:
 
✓ Change or remove the titles that iMovie has placed automatically
 
✓ Remove the transitions that iMovie has added automatically
 
✓ Add additional transitions
Adding Titles to a Themed Project
Chapter 9 describes the care and feeding of titles in detail, but here are 
the basics for adding titles to a themed movie that has automatic titles and 
transitions turned on.
 
 
1. In the toolbar, click the Title button to see the available titles in the 
Media Browser.
 
 
 In addition to the title styles that iMovie makes available for 
all projects, a set of theme-related title thumbnails appears at the top of 
the Media Browser.
 
2. Drag a title thumbnail over a clip in your project that doesn’t have 
a title.
 
 If you drag the title thumbnail over the beginning or the end of the clip, 
the first third or last third of the clip is highlighted, as shown in Figure 
8-12. If you drag the title thumbnail over the center of the clip, the entire 
clip is highlighted. When you drop the title thumbnail, the title appears 
over the section of the clip that was highlighted.
 
3. In the Viewer, click on the title text and change it to your liking, as 
shown in Figure 8-13, and then click Done.

Customizing Transitions in a Themed Project
Although automatic titles and transitions in a themed project prohibit you 
from removing or adding transitions to the project, you still can adjust the 
transitions that the theme has placed in the project.
You can make the following kinds of changes to transitions in a themed 
project that has automatic transitions enabled:
 
✓ Change which frames are displayed in a theme-styled transition
 
✓ Change transition duration
 
✓ Control the type of transition (non-theme-styled only)
As you saw back in Figure 8-6, a theme-styled transition uses individual 
frames drawn from your movie project as part of the transition graphic. To 
choose different frames for the transition graphic, click the theme-styled 
transition icon between two clips. When you do, the project pane shows 
you from where the frames used in the transition are drawn, as seen in 
Figure 8-14.
Figure 8-14: 
Pointers 
show where 
a theme-
styled 
transition 
gets its 
images.
 

103
 Chapter 8: Using Themes to Enhance Your Movie
The numbers in the project pane correspond to those shown in the Viewer 
pane, as seen in Figure 8-15.
Figure 8-15: 
The transi-
tion graphic 
frames are 
numbered in 
the viewer.
 
Here’s how you change a frame used in the transition graphic:
 
1. Drag the pointer in the project pane to a different location in the 
project.
 
 The transition graphic shown in the viewer pane adjusts itself.
 
2. In the viewer pane, click Done.
To adjust the transition duration and, for non-theme-styled transitions, the 
type of transition, do the following:
 
1. Position the playhead over the transition icon, click the action button 
that appears below it, and then choose Transition Adjustments from 
the action menu that appears, as shown in Figure 8-16.
 
 We discuss the Transitions Adjustments menu again in Chapter 9.
 
2. In the Inspector, change the duration and select whether the change 
applies only to the current transition or to all transitions in the proj-
ect, as shown in Figure 8-17.

3. For non-theme-styled transitions, click the transition type, and then, 
when the Inspector rotates to show you the available transition 
choices, click a transition style.
 
 iMovie applies the transition style you clicked, and the Inspector rotates 
back to show its face again.
 
4. In the Inspector, click Done.
Going to Manual transitions
Automatic transitions and titles can take a lot of the work out of building an 
iMovie project. All you have to do is choose the clips and the order in which 
they appear, and iMovie links them all together in an attractive presentation. 
However, you don’t have to be hamstrung completely by iMovie’s automatic 
decisions. You can keep the theme, but wrest control of when, where, and 
how titles and transitions appear.
Getting manual control of your titles and transitions is almost absurdly 
simple: Just try to do something that iMovie doesn’t want you to do. That 
is, drag a title thumbnail over an iMovie-generated title bar, or drag a 
different transition over an iMovie-generated transition. When you commit 
this heinous crime, iMovie displays the dialog shown in Figure 8-18.
All you have to do is click Turn Off Automatic Transitions. Of course, after 
you do that, iMovie no longer generates transitions and titles for you 
when you add clips to your project. You’re on your own: master of your own 
destiny. Don’t turn automatic transitions back on, though, or you’ll lose 
your customizations.

 Chapter 8: Using Themes to Enhance Your Movie
Applying an Animated Travel Map
Okay, we admit it: This section really has nothing to do with themes, but 
there’s really no other good place for it to go in this book, and it somehow 
thematically feels as if it belongs with iMovie themes. So we’re putting it here.
Just as iMovie’s themes give you graphically sophisticated animated titles 
and transitions, iMovie can also give you animated maps that you can use 
to enhance your projects. Maps provide visually interesting introductions 
to scenes in movies that take place in various locations around the world. 
(Sorry, iMovie offers no extraterrestrial maps — at this time.)
You can insert maps between clips in your project to let the audience know 
where the next sequence takes place, and you can even show the course 
of a journey Indiana Jones-style, where a line is drawn on the map indicating 
the journey’s path. And you can choose from a variety of map styles that can 
harmonize with the theme you may have chosen for your project.
 
 To get access to the iMovie map collection, click the Maps and Backgrounds 
button at the far right of the toolbar. The Media Browser presents its maps 
and backgrounds, with the eight animated maps and four still maps at the 
top. They come in four styles, and each style comes in both a globe and a flat 
animated version and in a still flat version (see Figure 8-19):
 
✓ Old World
 
✓ Watercolor
 
✓ Educational
 
✓ Blue Marble
 
You can use both animated maps and still maps as the background for movie 
titles. See Chapter 9 for more about titles and backgrounds.
Figure 8-19: 
Maps that 
move and 
maps that 
don’t.
 

106
Part II: Doing a Rough Cut 
To use an animated map, just drag its thumbnail from the Media Browser to 
your project and drop it on a clip: Drop it near the beginning of the clip to 
have the map precede the clip, and drop it near the end of a clip to have the 
map follow the clip.
 
If your project uses a theme with automatic transitions and titles, iMovie 
adds a transition before or after the map just as it would for any other clip 
that you add to the project.
When you add an animated map to your project, iMovie presents its Map 
Inspector, as seen in Figure 8-20. You use the Inspector to do the following:
 
✓ Set the duration of the animation
 
✓ Apply one of iMovie’s standard video effects to the map
 
✓ Set the location where the map animation begins
 
✓ Optionally, set the location where the animation ends
 
If you do not set an end location for the animated map, the animation centers 
on the start location and animates the location’s label on the map.
Figure 8-20: 
The Map 
Inspector.
 
Here’s how to set a location:
 
1. Click Start Location or End Location.
 
 The Inspector rotates to display the Choose City or Airport dialog.
 
2. Enter a city, state, country, or airport code in the search field.
 
 iMovie offers possible matching locations from its database of locations, 
as shown in Figure 8-21.
 
3. Click a location.
 
 iMovie places it in the dialog’s Name to Display on Map field.

 If you can only find a location near the one you want, choose it and 
change the display name. The map is not so accurate that your audience 
can tell the difference between, say, Malibu (in the database) and Pacific 
Palisades (not in the database) in Southern California.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The dialog rotates back to the Map Inspector.
 
When you have both a start and end location specified, the Map Inspector 
offers you a control that you can use to swap the two locations, so that the 
end becomes the start and vice versa, as shown in Figure 8-22. The Inspector 
also shows the distance between the two locations.
Click Done to close the Map Inspector and play the animated map clip to see 
your travel map in action.

Adding Titles, Transitions, 
and Effects
In This Chapter
▶ Adding titles and text frames
▶ Transitioning between clips
▶ Employing visual effects
N
o matter how wonderful your footage or how compelling your movie’s 
message, you still want to introduce your opus in the best possible 
manner. The textual introduction of your movie’s title, possible text effects 
to set various scenes, the visual segue from one scene to the next, and 
visual effects to set or enhance a mood are all post-production 
activities that have stood the test of time. iMovie provides 
you with all these capabilities in its customary easy-to-use 
way. In this chapter, we show you what you can do with 
titles, transitions, and visual effects, and how to do it.
Working with Titles
The word titles is such an unassuming term to 
cover the broad range of textual adornment iMovie 
provides. Whether you’re looking for a static white-
on-black title still, rolling credits, or scene caption-
ing, iMovie provides you with a wealth of textual 
effects from which to choose.
Picking a title type
 
 You access iMovie’s one-stop title shopping emporium via the Show or Hide 
Title Browser button in the iMovie toolbar, shown in the margin, by choosing

Part III: In the Cutting Room 
When you display the Title Browser, you see something similar to Figure 9-1 
(the selection of titles varies, depending upon the Theme you’re using in your 
project). Thirty-two title presentations are always available, and they’re the 
only ones you see when your Theme choice is None. Theme-specific titles 
appear at the top of the scrolling thumbnail array, separated from the ubiqui-
tous titles by a thin horizontal line, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
You can change themes freely right from the Title Browser. Just click the Set 
Theme button at the upper left to display the Theme Picker dialog and make 
your choice. The current theme’s name is displayed to the right of the Set 
Theme button.

Table 9-1 is a rundown of the titles available to all projects, with a very brief 
overview of each:
Table 9-1 
Title Styles for All Themes
Thumbnail
Name
Brief Description
Centered
Static, two-line title centered 
on the screen, the top line 
being the title in large type 
and the bottom line being an 
optional subtitle.
Lower Third
The same as Centered, but 
with the text positioned in 
the bottom third of the 
screen.
Lower
One line of title text, in the 
bottom-right corner of the 
screen.
Upper
One line of title text, in the 
upper-left screen corner.
Echo
A line of title text above a 
smaller line of subtitle text in 
the bottom-left corner of the 
screen, with the title text line 
repeated in a neutral gray (all 
caps) across the bottom of 
the screen. If the title is too 
long to fit initially, the charac-
ters are made narrower to 
make it fit.

Brief Description
Overlap
This title style is animated. By 
default, the title is in red and 
moves into the frame from 
the left; the subtitle is in white 
and moves in from the right. 
After pausing in place, they 
move offscreen in the same 
directions as they entered, 
overlapping as they pass 
(hence the name).
Four Corners
Another animated style, the 
title comes into the frame 
from the left center and 
stops, whereas the subtitle 
enters the frame from the 
bottom, stopping just below 
the title. Then, they do a slight 
Ken Burns Effect zoom in, fol-
lowed by the title moving off-
screen at the top-right corner 
and the subtitle moving out-
of-frame at the right.
Scrolling 
Credits
This title style should be 
familiar to anyone who’s ever 
stayed for a movie’s closing 
credits. A header (the default 
is “Starring”) is followed by 
line after line of two text col-
umns, with the performer’s 
name in the left column and 
the role in the right column. 
You replace the four place-
holders with your own cred-
its, but when it comes to 
adding additional rows, there 
is a small trick that isn’t that 
obvious: press Return to 
create a new row and then 
press Tab to position the 
cursor to where the right end 
of the name would be. Press 
Tab again to position to the 
start of the second column. 
Repeat as necessary for 
additional lines.

Brief Description
Drifting
An animated two-row title 
where the top line comes to 
the center rapidly from the 
left, hovers briefly, and then 
exits rapidly to the right. The 
second line does the same 
zip-hover-zip sequence, but 
from the opposite direction.
Sideways 
Drift
Very similar to Drifting, but 
with a perspective effect 
where the characters 
increase in size from left to 
right, giving the impression 
that the top line is coming 
toward you and the bottom 
line is receding in the dis-
tance.
Vertical Drift
Similar to Drifting, but with 
the left half of the line 
coming in from the screen 
bottom and zipping off the 
top; the right half of the line 
whips in from the top, hovers 
and speeds off the bottom.
Zoom
The same layout as 
Centered, but the text fades 
into the center, gradually 
zooming in some more, then 
fading out.
Horizontal 
Blur
The text emerges from 
blurred horizontal stripes, 
zooms in slightly, and then 
dissolves back into blurred 
horizontal stripes.
Soft Edge
A single title line about two-
thirds down from the top of 
the screen that softly fades 
into view, moves slowly 
toward the right, and then 
fades out of view.

Lens Flare
Lens flares cross and the 
title line appears in the 
center of the screen, sits 
there, and then fades out. 
This title effect does not 
allow specifying a different 
font, as we discuss later in 
this chapter.
Pull Focus
Similar to Centered, except 
that the text fades in and 
fades out, with the charac-
ters having a thin black out-
line.
Boogie 
Lights
Flashing lights, text fades 
into the center, and then 
flashing lights again.
Pixie Dust
Like Boogie Lights, but with 
the flashing lights replaced 
with sparkling pixie dust, a la 
Disney’s Tinkerbell.
Organic 
Main
An ornate, script title with a 
decorative vine-like accent 
to the upper-left and lower-
right fades into view, hovers 
in the center of the screen, 
and then fades out. This title 
effect does not allow you to 
specify a different font.
Organic 
Lower
The text and vine-like 
accents fade in over a 
parchment stripe at the 
bottom of the screen. You 
cannot choose a different 
font for this title effect.

Ticker
Your title marches from left to 
right along the bottom of the 
screen in a manner similar to 
a stock market ticker tape. 
You may not specify a differ-
ent font for this title style.
Date/Time
This effect places the time 
and date your project was 
created in the bottom-left 
corner of the screen. You 
have no control over any 
aspect of the Date/Time title 
style.
Clouds
Blue (left) and pink (right) 
clouds bounce out of the 
bottom of the screen and 
settle there, displaying your 
title text. You do not have 
control over the font used in 
this effect.
Far, Far 
Away
This is the familiar Star Wars 
opening effect, where line 
after line of text comes in 
from the bottom of the 
screen and narrows as it 
scrolls up, giving the effect 
of fading into the distance. 
You can have as many lines 
of text as you wish.
Gradient — 
White
A title line and a subtitle line 
centered in a white-to-trans-
parent radial gradient stripe 
along the bottom of the 
screen. The stripe and text 
fade in quickly, sit there, and 
then fade out quickly at the 
end of the clip.
Soft Bar —

Similar to Gradient — White, 
but with a solid white bar 
rather than a gradient.

 Chapter 9: Adding Titles, Transitions, and Effects
To add a title to your project, click the title style you want to use and drag 
it to your project, into the position you want it. Note that you can place it 
between clips or have it play over a clip. We explain how in the next two 
sections.
Adding a title over a clip
To have your video play over existing footage, proceed as follows:
 
1. Drag the title style you want to use to your project, letting it hover 
over a clip.
 
 A purple highlight appears, indicating the frames on which the title 
appears.
 
2. Release the mouse button.
 
 A blue title bar appears over the frames where the title plays, as shown 
in Figure 9-3.
 
3. (Optional.) If you want a different duration, double-click the blue bar 
to present the Inspector, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 
 Adjust the duration as desired. Alternatively, you can drag the blue bar 
until the desired duration appears.
Figure 9-3: 
A blue bar 
shows your 
title text, the 
duration, 
and which 
frames it 
covers.
 
Figure 9-4: 
The

title’s 
duration, 
style, and

4. Select the blue bar.
 
 The title editor appears in the Viewer, as shown in Figure 9-5.
 
5. Select the text placeholders and replace them with your text.
 
6. (Optional.) If the Show Fonts button is present and you wish to use a 
different typeface, click the Show Fonts button.
 
 The iMovie Fonts Panel, shown in Figure 9-6, appears. The nine iMovie 
fonts are in the left column, the nine color options in the second column, 
and the nine available sizes in the right column. Select a style (Bold, 
Italic, or Outlined) if desired from the style buttons below the list and an 
alignment choice from the Alignment buttons (left justified, centered, 
fully justified, and right justified). If you want more font flexibility, click 
the System Font Panel button and the window flips over to present the 
standard Mac OS X Font panel.
 
7. (Optional, but recommended.) Click the Play button in the Viewer to 
preview your title.
 
8. Click Done to exit the title editor.

 Chapter 9: Adding Titles, Transitions, and Effects
 
The iMovie Font Panel, described in Step 6, is a little bit like a menu in a 
Chinese restaurant: pick one from column A, one from column B, and one 
from column C. For example, you could select a pale blue Futura Medium in 
size 9 (and no, that’s not point size, but just a 1–9 scale of increasing sizes) 
or a size 2 black Coolvetica or any of the other 727 combinations.
 
In addition to being useful as actual titles and credits, titles applied over clips 
are useful for captioning: We’ve even seen them used to present lyrics for 
sing-along purposes. It’s not quite karaoke, but it’s a reasonable facsimile.
Adding titles between clips
If you don’t want your titles appearing over your footage, proceed as follows:
 
1. Select the title you want to use and drag it to the beginning of your 
project (common for an opening title), the end of project (often used 
for closing credits), or between clips (usually used to set up a scene).
 
 The Choose Background panel appears, as shown in Figure 9-7. As 
you hover the mouse pointer over a background, you see a preview in 
the Viewer.
 
2. Click the background of choice and iMovie places it in your project at 
the point selected in Step 1, as shown in Figure 9-8.
 
 A blue title bar appears over the clip, listing the duration and text (or at 
least the beginning thereof).
 
3. With the blue title bar selected, replace the placeholder text with your 
text in the Viewer.

Choose the 
background 
for your title 
clip here.

4. If you wish to use a different font, size, and/or color and the Show 
Fonts button is present, which indicates that you may customize the 
fonts, click the Show Fonts button to display the iMovie Font Panel, 
shown previously in Figure 9-6.
 
 Using the iMovie Font Panel is described in the previous section of this 
chapter.
 
5. If you wish to change the duration, any fade in/out timing, or even the 
title style, double-click the blue title bar to display the Inspector, 
shown previously in Figure 9-4, and make your adjustments.
 
6. Click Done in the Viewer to exit from title editing mode.
Some ways you might employ titles between clips include
 
✓ Introducing a scene or sequence in your movie: for example, “Day 2, 
Kauai” in a vacation video about your week in the Aloha State.
 
✓ Providing expository text about products in a catalog video.
 
✓ Providing dialogue when simulating a silent film.
 
In the iMovie Font Panel, mentioned in Step 4, you have to pick one from 
column A, one from column B, and one from column C. This gives you 
729 possible combinations (9×9×9) of font, size, and color, without even 
considering stylistic variations (bold, italic, and outlined).
Employing Transitions
As described in Chapter 8, iMovie’s themes include professionally selected 
transitions that are placed between clips. You can select your own transi-
tions, in those cases where you don’t grant iMovie’s themes dictatorial 
control, in the Transitions Browser. To show the Transitions Browser, do 
one of the following:

123
 Chapter 9: Adding Titles, Transitions, and Effects
 
 
✓ Click the Show or Hide Transitions browser button in the iMovie toolbar.
 
 
✓ Choose Window➪Transitions.
 
✓ Press Ô+4.
iMovie provides 20 transitions regardless of the theme in use. Each theme 
has its own set of transitions, whose names consist of the theme name and a 
number, as shown in the top row of thumbnails in Figure 9-9, in addition to 
the ubiquitous 20.
Figure 9-9: 
Theme-
specific 
transitions 
are grouped 
together 
in the 
Transitions 
browser.
 
The ever-present 20 transitions are
 
✓ Cross Dissolve: Probably the most classic transition, the cross dissolve 
overlays the ends of the adjacent clips, fading out the frames from the 
clip that is ending while fading in the frames from the new clip.
 
✓ Cross Blur: Very similar to the Cross Dissolve, Cross Blur blurs the 
frames from the clip that is ending while making the frames from the clip 
that is starting more distinct.
 
✓ Cross Zoom: Yet another variation on the previous transitions, Cross 
Zoom zooms out from the first clip and zooms in the second clip.
 
✓ Ripple: Ripple gives the appearance of ripples on water as the first clip 
gives way to the second.
 
✓ Fade to Black: The first clip fades out to a black background and the 
second clip fades into view.
 
✓ Fade to White: Like Fade to Black, but with a white background.

124
Part III: In the Cutting Room 
 
✓ Page Curl Right: The second clip appears incrementally from the top-
left toward the bottom-right as a curling page effect takes place.
 
✓ Page Curl Left: From the top-right toward the bottom-left.
 
✓ Spin In: The second clip starts as a small centered rectangle tilted about 
45 degrees, and then spins clockwise and grows to fill the screen.
 
✓ Spin Out: The first clip shrinks while spinning counter-clockwise to 
reveal the second clip.
 
✓ Circle Open: A circle in the center of the screen grows to fill the screen 
while revealing the second clip.
 
✓ Circle Close: The first clip disappears from view as a circle shrinks to 
nothing in the center of the screen.
 
✓ Doorway: A rectangle grows laterally to reveal the second clip.
 
✓ Swap: The first clip shrinks to a rectangle on the left and a rectangle on 
the right grows to fill the screen with the second clip.
 
✓ Cube: Many of you have seen this one before. Mac OS X uses it to show 
a user switch. The first scene is on one face of the cube, the second 
scene on the next face to the right. The cube rotates to the left, hiding 
the first clip and displaying the second.
 
✓ Mosaic: The first clip breaks up into mosaic tiles, which then display 
second clip fragments that coalesce to display the second clip.
 
✓ Wipe Left: Another classic transition, the first clip disappears from right 
to left, just like dirt under a squeegee, with the second clip appearing in 
the wiped area.
 
✓ Wipe Right: Reverse directions on Wipe Left and you’ve got this 
transition.
 
✓ Wipe Up: We hope the name makes this transition obvious by now.
 
✓ Wipe Down: And this transition, as well.
 
Although it doesn’t appear in the Transitions browser, there is one more 
transition to consider, and that is the lack of a transition. A straight cut from 
one clip to the next is called a jump cut. Jump cuts are commonly employed 
when moving from one camera angle to another in a single scene and 
transitions are generally employed to give a sense of passing time or change 
of scene.
Hovering the mouse over any of the thumbnails in the Transitions browser 
presents a preview of the transition, just like skimming footage in the Project 
or Events browser.

125
 Chapter 9: Adding Titles, Transitions, and Effects
To insert a transition between two clips, drag a transition from the 
Transitions browser into the Project pane. iMovie displays a vertical green 
bar indicating where the transition is to be placed, as shown in Figure 9-10.
Figure 9-10: 
iMovie 
shows you 
where the 
transition 
will go if you 
release 
the mouse 
button.
 
 
 iMovie displays a transition indicator (shown in the margin) wherever a tran-
sition exists. Double-click the transition indicator to display the Inspector, as 
shown in Figure 9-11. You can also choose Transition Adjustments from the 
action (gear) menu that appears when the mouse pointer is on or near the 
transition indicator. You can change the transition’s duration (the default is 
14 frames) by typing a new value in the Duration text box. Additionally, you 
can select the Applies to All Transitions check box. But, most conveniently, 
you can replace the transition with another by clicking the Transition button, 
displaying your current transition’s name to have the Inspector spin around 
and grow to show the Choose Transition panel, seen in Figure 9-12. Select a 
new transition or click Cancel to keep your current transition: Either action 
returns you to the Inspector.
Figure 9-11: 
The 
Transitions 
Inspector.
 
 
We would be remiss if we didn’t include some advice concerning transitions: 
Pick just a few to use in your movie and employ those few consistently. The 
more transitions you use in your movie, the more distracting your audience 
will find them. Transitions are meant to segue between two clips, not to be 
a noticeable part of your movie. Personally, we think that Spin In, Spin Out, 
Swap, Cube, and Mosaic should be reserved for special situations, such as a 
slideshow, and rarely used in a movie.

Applying Video Effects
We mentioned visual effects briefly in Chapter 6, with a promise to cover 
them more fully in this chapter, so here we go. Apple calls these Video Effects 
because you apply them to your video — the original iMovie product just 
called them Effects. Figure 9-13 shows the Choose Video Effect panel, which 
you access by clicking Video Effect button in the Clip Inspector.
The 20 available Video Effects are
 
✓ None: Enough said.
 
✓ Flipped: Everything on the left is now on the right, and vice versa. 
To the geometrically inclined, the image is reflected through the 
vertical axis.

 Chapter 9: Adding Titles, Transitions, and Effects
 
✓ Raster: The discrete pixels in the image are now evident, as though the 
frame is composed of a mass of small tiles.
 
✓ Cartoon: The number of colors is reduced, producing a more cartoonish 
feel to the video, hence the name.
 
✓ Aged Film: A sort of pebbled or crackled texture is applied, as though 
you used old film that was just starting to deteriorate.
 
✓ Film Grain: A fine, grainy texture is applied to your footage. The differ-
ences between Aged Film and Film Grain aren’t always easy to discern.
 
✓ Hard Light: Familiar to Photoshop users, this is the video analog of 
the Hard Light blend mode. Imagine a harsh spotlight shining on 
your image — lighter colors get highlighted more and darker colors 
become starker.
 
✓ Day into Night: Everything gets darkened so that bright daylight scenes 
appear to be taken at twilight and nighttime footage looks almost 
midnight black, with dark shadows flitting across a darker backdrop.
 
✓ Glow: Intensifies the contrast.
 
✓ Dream: Adds a hazy overlay to your footage.
 
✓ Romantic: Adds an increasing haziness the closer you get to the edge of 
the frame, making the center of the frame stand out more.
 
✓ Vignette: An effect where the image’s clarity degrades close to the edges 
or corners.
 
✓ Bleach Bypass: An effect where the whites look excessively bright, as if 
they had been bleached.
 
✓ Old World: Dulls the footage.
 
✓ Heat Wave: Adds a yellow cast to your footage, as though shot under a 
bright, hot sun.
 
✓ Sci-Fi: Washes out much of the color in your video.
 
✓ Black & White: Okay, this one should be obvious, right?
 
✓ Sepia: Adds a brown (sepia) tone to your footage, similar to the sepia-
toned photos common in the early twentieth century and before.
 
✓ Negative: Inverts your footages colors, much like a photographic 
negative.
 
✓ X-Ray: Light and shadow against a black background, similar to an X-ray 
image (hence the name).
Double-click the desired Video Effect to select it or click Cancel to retain the 
current Effect. In either case, you return to the Clip Inspector.

Skimming over an effect’s thumbnail presents a preview of the selected

Precision Editing
In This Chapter
▶ Adding comment and chapter markers
▶ Fine-tuning a cut
▶ Editing video and audio separately
▶ Using greenscreen compositing
▶ Putting Picture in Picture in play
▶ Employing cutaways
R
emoving excess footage, stabilizing shaky video, and rearranging your 
clips are basic editing operations, and we cover those in Chapter 6. 
Adding titles and transitions and employing video effects are intermediate 
editing operations and we discussed those in Chapter 9. Themes 
and Maps were explored in Chapter 8.
In this chapter, we hit upon some advanced editing 
topics, most particularly a new iMovie feature that 
Apple has dubbed precision editing, hence this chap-
ter’s name. Precision editing also encompasses the 
use of some common video presentations, such as 
picture-in-picture and green-screen composition. 
We also discuss adding chapter markers to be used 
with iDVD and comment markers that serve as 
reminders while editing.
Marking Frames
When you’re browsing through your project’s video, you 
invariably come across frames where you want to add a title, 
adjust the audio, or perform some other operation. You could stop each time 
you encounter such a frame, perform the desired operation, and then go back

to browsing. We’ve tried that and found that we often got sidetracked, losing 
the browsing continuity as we went through the editing process. Similarly, 
when you’re planning to put your opus on a DVD, you probably want to 
emulate professional movies and specify scenes that the viewer can jump 
to quickly.
iMovie helps you stay on track by providing comment markers, essentially 
video bookmarks where you tag a frame with a reminder so that you can go 
back and perform your editing at a more convenient time. To establish which 
frames a DVD viewer should be able to jump to, iMovie provides chapter 
markers as a cue to iDVD (see Chapter 15).
Setting a comment marker
We think you’ll find that using comment markers makes your workflow 
smoother. Here’s how to set a comment marker:
 
1. Make sure that you have Advanced Tools turned on.
 
 Choose iMovie➪Preferences and select the Show Advanced Tools check 
box in the General pane if it isn’t already selected.
 
 
2. Drag a comment marker (see left margin) to the frame in your project.
 
 
 A brown, numbered bar appears above your clip, centered on 
the frame you marked, as shown in Figure 10-1. Note that, if a comment 
marker is dragged to a frame of a title clip, rather than displaying a 
number, iMovie uses the title text as the marker’s name.
 
3. (Optional, but recommended.) Double-click the brown marker and 
type a reminder of why you marked this frame.
 
 When you double-click the marker, the rectangle gets larger. Figure 10-2 
shows the comment marker with a reminder that we want to make a 
freeze frame at this point. Notice that the marker resizes to accommo-
date the comment.

marker 
above the 
frame.

 Chapter 10: Precision Editing
Figure 10-2:

You can go back and edit a comment marker at any time by double-clicking 
the marker. You can also drag the comment marker to attach it to a different 
frame. To delete a comment marker, just click the brown marker to select it 
and press Delete.
Setting a chapter marker
When you purchase a commercial DVD and stick it into your DVD player, 
one of the first things you notice on most DVD menu screens, usually just 
below Play Movie, is a button with a name like Scene Selections or Chapter 
Selections. Using your DVD remote control to select the scene selection 
button displays a new screen with named or numbered images that let you 
pick where you want to start the movie playing. Your movies might not be as 
long or have as many scenes as a Hollywood blockbuster, but they often have 
sections that you really want to highlight. Consider the following examples:
 
✓ In your kid’s Little League game, you might want to be able to jump 
directly to your little darling’s at-bats or especially interesting plays in 
the field (whether a highlight or blooper).
 
✓ When viewing a school play, you might want to be able to go to a 
specific act or scene.
 
✓ For a recital or concert, you might want to be able to jump to specific 
musical numbers or to where particular performers come on-stage.
 
✓ In a vacation video, you might want to jump directly to a specific loca-
tion (maybe the Painted Desert or the Grand Canyon on a trip through 
the American Southwest) or activity (for example, skiing, hang-gliding, 
cliff diving, or driving the bumper cars at Disneyland).
Just add chapter markers in iMovie. Then when you share your movie with 
iDVD, the Media Browser, or iTunes, or export it as a movie file in any size 
other than Tiny (sharing and exporting is covered in Chapter 12), your 
navigational aids are present for your viewers to take advantage of. To add 
a chapter marker, proceed as follows:

132
Part III: In the Cutting Room 
 
1. Make sure that you have Advanced Tools turned on.
 
 Choose iMovie➪Preferences and select the Show Advanced Tools check 
box in the General pane if it isn’t already selected.
 
 
2. Drag a chapter marker (see left margin) to the frame in your project. 
An orange, numbered bar with an arrow appears above your clip, 
centered on the frame you marked, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
 “Orange” is the color Apple uses to describe it — it looks more like

type a name for the chapter.
 
 Your audience will find it easier to select a named scene than to remem-
ber (or try to figure out) what number goes with what scene, and you will, 
too. When you double-click the marker, the rectangle gets larger. Figure 
10-4 shows the chapter marker with a (hopefully) recognizable name. 
Notice that the marker resizes to accommodate the chapter name.
 
Although it’s not always the case, you’ll discover that most of your chapter 
markers fall at the start of a scene. For that reason, you might want to avoid 
placing transitions at the clip boundaries where marked scenes begin, or at 
least avoid the more active transitions lest your audience jump into the 
middle of a transition, missing at least part of the desired effect.

Navigating a marked course
As your project fills with markers, you may begin to find that locating a 
specific marker becomes more and more difficult. Scanning the little orange 
and brown bars for a particular text string requires close attention, so 
Apple made it easy by adding a drop-down menu button next to the comment 
and chapter marker icons in the Project Browser’s upper-right corner, as 
shown in Figure 10-5. A quick click and you have a menu of your markers, 
conveniently arranged to help you find what you seek.
Figure 10-5: 
Go directly 
to your 
marker by 
choosing 
it from the

menu.
 
Editing Precisely
When you apply a transition, iMovie shortens the clips on either side of the 
transition when performing the blend. When viewing your footage normally, 
you don’t see the excised frames. However, when using the precision editor, 
you see and can work with the unused frames on either side of the transition 
point, witnessing the effect your modifications have on the transition.
Editing a transition point
If you want to edit a transition between two clips, proceed as follows:
 
 
1. Open the Precision Editor by choosing Precision Editor from the 
Action menu (see margin) that appears when you move the mouse 
pointer over the transition, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
 The Precision Editor opens in the space normally occupied by the Event 
Library and Event Browser, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
 The frames at the left end of the top row are those that play before the 
transition, those at the right end of the bottom row are those that play 
after the transition, and the remaining (shaded) frames are those that 
are not currently used in your project. The transition appears as an icon 
between the top and bottom rows.

2. To move the cut point, the frame where one clip ends and the next 
begins, just click the frame that you want to be the cut point (in either 
clip). The filmstrip slides to position the new frame at the cut point.
 
 In this manner, you can manually adjust how many frames from either 
clip are subsumed by the transition. Figure 10-8 shows a Fade to White 
transition between an outdoor scene and an indoor scene. Figure 10-9 
shows the result of sliding both filmstrips to the right, in effect fading 
more of the clip that is ending and concealing less of the clip that is 
starting. Be aware that sliding the cut points only moves the start and 
end points and doesn’t alter the transition’s duration.
 
3. Click Done when finished to close the Precision Editor.
 
You can also drag the end of either filmstrip to slide it until the desired frame 
is at the cut point.
  Click the Extras button (see margin) to toggle whether indicators (icons, 
markers, titles, and so on) above the top filmstrip or below the bottom 
filmstrip are present, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
Even if there is no transition or title, you can use the Precision Editor to 
fine-tune a cut point between two clips. Double-click in the space between 
the clips and the Precision Editor appears. This is the easiest way we know 
to trim the exact frames you want from one of your project’s clips.

Adjusting audio separately from video
At times, you might want the audio from a clip to continue into the next clip. 
This might be for artistic effect or to block out a distracting noise at the start 
of a clip.

136
Part III: In the Cutting Room 
 
Industry folk often call such cuts overlap edits or pre-lap and post-lap edits 
(depending upon whether the sound starts prematurely or begins after the 
video). Other terms you might encounter are J-cuts and L-cuts, respectively. 
Now you know some more jargon to make you sound like an editing pro.
To adjust the audio of your clip separately from the video, proceed as follows:
 
1. Open the Precision Editor by double-clicking the space between 
the two clips.
 
 The Precision Editor pane appears.
 
 
2. Click the Precision Editor’s Audio button (see the margin).
 
 
 Blue waveforms appear above the top filmstrip, as shown 
in Figure 10-11. These waveforms represent the audio tracks.
 
3. Drag the line at the top waveform’s cut point to the left to terminate 
its audio prematurely, or drag the line at the bottom waveform’s cut 
point to the left to have it begin during the first clip, or to the right to 
have it begin after its associated video.
 
 In Figure 10-12, we had the second clip’s audio begin during the end of 
the first clip.

You can adjust both waveforms at the same time by pressing Shift while 
dragging an endpoint.
Using Picture-in-Picture
Jaded videophiles that we all are, we’re accustomed to seeing picture-in-
picture video, which is a small video frame superimposed on the full-screen. 
We see it on newscasts, where the anchorperson or correspondent is in 
the small frame telling us what’s going on in the news footage that’s playing. 
We also see it in documentaries, where the narrator describes what’s 
being shown.
iMovie makes it simple to produce your own picture-in-picture footage. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Make sure that Advanced Tools is selected in iMovie’s General 
Preferences. Choose iMovie➪Preferences (Ô+,) and click the General 
icon to check whether it’s selected; select Show Advanced Tools if it 
isn’t already selected.
 
 You might save a trip to iMovie Preferences by looking at the iMovie 
toolbar to see whether the Arrow and Keyword tools are present — 
they’re only on the toolbar when Advanced Tools are active.
 
2. Select the footage in the Events Browser that you want to have appear 
in the inset window.
 
3. Drag the selected footage onto a clip in your project, as shown in 
Figure 10-13. A menu appears.
Figure 10-13: 
Drag your 
inset 
footage 
over the clip 
where you 
want it to

138
Part III: In the Cutting Room 
 
4. Choose Picture in Picture, as shown in Figure 10-14.
 
5. The picture-in-picture clip sports a blue frame when it’s not selected 
and appears above the footage it overlays, as shown in Figure 10-15. 
You can preview the PiP effect in the Viewer, as shown in Figure 10-16.

Figure 10-16: 
Et viola: You

Now that you have your picture in picture in place, you can customize it in 
many ways:
 
✓ You can drag it in the project browser to start at another frame.
 
✓ You can drag the inset in the Viewer to another position on screen, as 
shown in Figure 10-17.

139
 Chapter 10: Precision Editing
 
✓ Grab a corner handle on the inset and drag to resize the inset, as shown 
in Figure 10-18.
 
✓ Double-click the PiP clip in the project browser to customize how the 
inset appears and disappears from the screen as well as whether it has a 
border and how that border looks. Figure 10-19 shows the Clip Inspector 
with the PiP section (and the available PiP Effects).

Part III: In the Cutting Room 
 
 Swap is one of the coolest effects, providing a transition where the PiP 
clip takes over the screen, with the original footage shrinking into the 
inset and re-emerging at the end of the PiP clip.
 
 Both clips’ audio play simultaneously. Adjust the audio of either or both 
clips to control which audio is dominant. In a narration, for example, 
you would make the PiP clip’s audio louder and duck the main clip’s 
audio. Ducking is covered in Chapter 6.
 
If a PiP extends over a transition in your movie, the transition doesn’t play.
Greening your screen
When you watch the weatherperson on TV, standing in front of the animated 
weather map, most of the time that map is actually just a solid green or 
blue background. When the weather forecast is broadcast, the weather maps 
replace the solid-colored section. The technical term for this effect, where 
a single color is made transparent so that other video can show through, 
is chroma key. You may also hear it called greenscreen or bluescreen compo-
siting. Green and blue are the colors most frequently used because they 
provide such a small component of flesh tones. (This technique might not 
work so well if you’re filming someone like a blue-skinned Orion alien for a 
Star Trek movie, though.)
To employ the greenscreen effect in your movies, proceed as follows:
 
1. Record the video you want to superimpose against a green backdrop.
 
 A highly saturated shade of green is best. You should make sure that the 
subject has no green in their attire, as the compositing process will also 
make those green areas become transparent. (St. Patrick’s Day is not the 
best time to film your subject against the green backdrop.)
 
2. Make sure iMovie’s Advanced Tools are active (that is, that the Arrow 
tool is in the iMovie toolbar).
 
 If they aren’t, choose iMovie➪Preferences, click General, and select 
Show Advanced Tools.
 
3. Select the green background scene footage in the Event Browser.
 
4. Drag the selected footage to the clip in your project where you want it 
to appear. Choose Green Screen in the menu that appears (refer to 
Figure 10-14).
 
 The greenscreen clip appears in your project above the video clip on 
which it will be superimposed and, when not selected, sports a dark 
green border, as shown in Figure 10-20.

141
 Chapter 10: Precision Editing
 
5. (Optional.) Select the greenscreen clip in your project and click the 
Cropped button that appears in the Viewer. Handles appear around 
your subject as shown in Figure 10-21. Drag the handles to surround 
your subject, making sure that he doesn’t move out of that area else-
where in the clip.
 
6. Click Done to exit the greenscreen editing process.
 
If the last frame of your greenscreen clip contains only the bright green back-
ground and no subject, iMovie can use that information to improve the 
effect’s efficacy. Double-click the greenscreen clip to invoke the Inspector, as 
shown in Figure 10-22. Select the Subtract Last Frame check box in the 
Background section. iMovie uses that information to further determine what 
gets subtracted from the greenscreen clip.
 
As with PiP clips, transitions that coincide with the greenscreen clip do 
not play.

screen 
clips have a

impose.
 
A brief history of bluescreen compositing
Originally called travelling matte, the technique 
was such a breakthrough that its inventor, Larry 
Butler, received the Special Effects Oscar for it 
at the 1940 Academy Awards. And that wasn’t 
the only Oscar awarded for the matte effect — 
in 1964, Petro Vlahos was awarded an Oscar for 
bluescreen compositing and then, at the end of 
the 1970s received an Emmy and a Lifetime 
Achievement Oscar for his work in compositing 
technology. Compositing allowed filmmakers to 
film, say, a whitewater rapids and place an 
actor’s image into those rapids, or (like in 
Raiders of the Lost Ark) film a nest of vipers and 
superimpose Harrison Ford’s green-screened 
scene on to it. Suffice it to say, digital compo-
siting made many movie scenes possible that 
were too dangerous, too expensive, or too 
difficult to achieve “live.”

Cutting away
Yet another common video editing technique is the use of a cutaway, where 
you overlay video from one clip onto another. Basically, this boils down to 
replacing only the video (not the audio) from your primary footage with the 
alternate video. One common use is to replace some video of a performance 
with that of the audience to show reaction to what’s occurring onstage.
Once again, iMovie makes implementing cutaways a piece of cake. Proceed as 
follows:
 
1. Make sure that you have Advanced Tools active by checking to see if 
the Arrow and Keyword tools are present in the toolbar.
 
 If they’re not, choose iMovie➪Preferences, display the General pane, 
and select the Show Advanced Tools checkbox.
 
2. Select the cutaway footage in the Event Browser.
 
3. Drag the selected footage onto a clip in your project. From the menu 
shown in Figure 10-14, choose Cutaway.

143
 Chapter 10: Precision Editing
 
 The cutaway clip, when not selected, sports a gray border and appears 
over the frames it will replace in your project. You can drag to reposi-
tion it, or you can drag the ends to lengthen or shorten the cutaway’s 
duration.
 
4. (Optional.) Double-click the cutaway clip to display the Clip Inspector, 
shown in Figure 10-23.
 
 You can adjust the fade in and fade out times by selecting the Manual 
radio button and then either typing a new duration in the associated 
text box or dragging the slider. You can also adjust the cutaway’s trans-
lucency by dragging the Opacity slider — this can, if used judiciously, 
present a nice ghosted-image effect.
 
5. Click Done when you’re finished making your adjustments.
 
iMovie gives you the cutaway shot’s audio by default so, if you wish to main-
tain the audio from the original scene, you need to use the Audio Inspector 
to control which audio track is used.
 
Once again, if a transition coincides with a cutaway, the transition does 
not play.

Replacing audio
Back in Chapters 1 and 2, when we recommended using multiple cameras, 
we were leading up to this brief discussion about audio. When you capture 
your footage from multiple sources, you give yourself options. You can 
choose which footage to use, but you can also opt to use the video from 
one with audio from another, or even just part of the audio from an 
alternate clip.

144
Part III: In the Cutting Room 
To replace a piece of flawed audio, select the frames with the bad audio 
in your project to determine how much audio you need to bring in from the 
other clip. This point is a good place to add a comment marker in your 
project. Then, proceed as follows:
 
1. Make sure that you have Advanced Tools active by checking to see if 
the Arrow and Keyword tools are present in the toolbar.
 
 If they are not active, choose iMovie➪Preferences, display the General 
pane, and select the Show Advanced Tools check box.
 
2. Select the frames from the clip in your Event Browser that have the 
good audio.
 
3. Drag the clip to the comment marker. The menu shown in Figure 10-14 
once again appears.
 
4. Choose Audio Only.
You’ve now replaced the inferior audio in your superior video clip with 
improved audio. 
 
Another good use for audio replacement is a narration track.

I
n the classic movie musical Singing in the Rain, Jean Hagen plays Lina 
Lamont, a glamorous silent film star who, at the advent of talking pictures, 
is at risk of losing her career because she has a voice as ugly as her face is 
beautiful. The lesson is that even fantastic video footage can come to naught 
if the audio can’t keep pace.
In the early chapters of this book, we repeatedly stress the importance of 
capturing quality audio. This might mean recording audio from mul-
tiple sources or employing external microphones to capture the 
audio up close and personal, even when the camera isn’t.
Regardless, however, of how much care you take to 
obtain the best audio possible, sometimes “stuff hap-
pens.” This chapter covers what iMovie offers to 
help you work around some of that stuff, including 
adjusting volume, normalizing volume across a clip 
(or clips), and setting beat markers to synchronize 
clips (and stills) with points in an audio track.
Adjusting the Audio Volume
iMovie doesn’t provide some audio editing features that 
were available in the iMovieHD and earlier versions, but it 
does include some new capabilities that are more useful, in gen-
eral. For example, you can’t manually ramp (gradually alter) a clip’s audio 
up and down through a clip, but you can normalize volume across the clips 
in your project, fade the audio in and out at the ends of the clip, and duck 
the audio in other clips (see Chapter 6 for a discussion of ducking audio). 
Fortunately, if you’re adept with GarageBand, you can work around the

Part III: In the Cutting Room 
ramping limitation by duplicating your audio track, bringing it into 
GarageBand and editing it there, and then moving the result back to iMovie 
and replacing the original audio with the edited track.
 
The just-described workaround, thankfully, is one of the few workarounds 
remaining after the transition from the iMovieHD codebase to the new iMovie 
codebase in iLife ’08, which required all sorts of audio editing workarounds. 
You even had to use GarageBand to add chapter markers to your movie in 
iMovie’08, but Apple returned chapter markers to iMovie in this version.
Normalizing clip volume
One of the great features added to iMovie’09, in our opinion, is the ability to 
normalize volume across a clip when in a project. Normalizing is the process 
of setting a clip’s volume to a consistent level. If you have clips where the 
volume level differs noticeably, those clips are good candidates for normal-
ization. Because most home video is shot using the camera’s microphone 
rather than prepositioned microphones, the volume fluctuates depending on 
distance from the camera and which way the subject is facing relative to the 
microphone. Proceed as follows:
 
1. Select the clip whose volume you wish to set to (roughly) the same 
level.
 
2. Invoke the Audio Inspector, as seen in Figure 11-1.
 
 The easiest methods of invoking the Audio Inspector are to press A or 
double-click the selected clip, but you can also choose Window➪Audio 
Adjustment or hover your mouse pointer near the beginning of the 
selected clip and choose Audio Adjustments from the Action (gear) 
menu that appears.
 
3. Click Normalize Clip Volume.
Figure 11-1: 
The 
Inspector’s 
Audio 
pane is

booth.
 

147
 Chapter 11: Editing Audio
 
After a clip’s volume is normalized, you can use the Audio Inspector’s 
Volume slider to raise or lower the volume. Although normalization makes 
the volume consistent, that consistent level hovers around the dominant 
level in the original clip, and that might be higher or lower than you want.
If you decide that the normalization isn’t an improvement you wish to keep, 
click the Audio Inspector’s Remove Normalization button at any time to 
restore the original audio levels.
Detaching a clip’s audio
Although it doesn’t often arise in our experience, when you want to work 
with a clip’s audio track separately from the video, being able to detach the 
audio track is invaluable. You might need to reposition the audio, trim it, or 
duck a part of it. Whatever separate adjustment you might want to make, 
detaching the audio track from the video is the necessary first step in the 
process. Fortunately, it’s easy to do:
 
1. Select the video clip whose audio you wish to detach.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Detach Audio.
 
 The audio track appears below the clip as a purple bar, which you can 
see in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2: 
A purple 
detached 
audio track.
 
A detached audio track
 
The term “detach audio” is slightly misleading. What’s really happening is 
that iMovie makes a copy of the clip’s audio track and then sets the clip’s 
volume to zero. In other words, iMovie mutes the clip’s audio track, just as 
though you had chosen Edit➪Mute Clip (Shift+Ô+M) or set the volume to 
zero in the Audio Inspector. A side effect of this detachment method is that 
you can now boost the audio volume past the 200 percent limit imposed by 
the volume slider, as follows:
 
1. Detach a clip’s audio, as previously described.
 
2. Select the audio clip and display the Audio Inspector by any of the 
tried and true methods you prefer.

148
Part III: In the Cutting Room 
 
3. Move the volume slider to the right, past the 100 percent mark.
 
 This puts the total volume now over 200 percent (over 100 percent in 
the clip and 100 percent in the detached track).
 
4. Adjust the detached track’s volume similarly.
 
 Because you can move both sliders to 200 percent, you can achieve a 
cumulative level of up to 400 percent.
 
The preceding technique lets you recover from many situations where 
you have barely audible audio, but increased ambient noise accompanies 
your volume increase. We think that the trade-off is generally beneficial — 
although great audio is best, audible audio beats inaudible audio every time.
Keeping a Beat
As Michael will tell you, Dennis can’t keep a beat in real life. Fortunately, 
iMovie lets him keep a digital beat in his video projects. Beat markers are the 
cornerstone to synchronizing your video with audio milestones, such as a 
clap of thunder, a particular line in a background song, or key points in a 
narrative.
To add a beat marker to any audio in your project, proceed as follows:
 
1. Select an audio clip.
 
 If you want to set beat markers to the audio portion of an existing video 
clip, you must first detach the audio as described previously in this 
chapter and then select the detached audio clip.
 
2. From the Action menu that appears when you hover over the begin-
ning of your clip, choose Clip Trimmer. The Clip Trimmer opens, as 
shown in Figure 11-3.
 
 You could also choose Window➪Clip Trimmer, but we prefer not to 
have to move the mouse any farther than necessary.

 Chapter 11: Editing Audio
Scoring with GarageBand
Film editors often use a temporary sound track 
for the score when editing a film, and then 
record the final score after the timing is set. You 
can use iMovie’s ability to share a project with 
the Media Browser (see Chapter 12) to make 
your finished cut available in GarageBand, 
where you can then add the score, matching it 
precisely to your video.
When you choose to create a new project in 
GarageBand, one of your project type choices 
is a Movie project. A new Movie project comes 
with an empty movie. Drag your movie from the 
Media Browser in GarageBand to that empty 
track, and your movie appears as a series of 
thumbnails with its audio track visible below it.
You can then add music tracks to the movie, 
fading them in and out as needed. You can 
score your movie with the various music loops 
that GarageBand provides, play your own 
music, and even play sound effects from your 
keyboard.
This figure shows a simple movie project with 
two added music tracks: a jazz organ and 
strings. The volume levels of each track are set 
to fade in and out over one another, which is the 
audio equivalent of a visual dissolve.
When you finish scoring your movie, you can use 
GarageBand’s Share menu to send the movie to 
iDVD, to iWeb, to iTunes, or to export it to disk. 
The last option gives you the ability to save the 
movie at full quality, so your final product looks 
just as good coming out of GarageBand as it did 
going in — and sounding even better!

150
Part III: In the Cutting Room 
 
3. Drag a beat marker (the musical note in the Clip Trimmer’s title bar, 
indicated in Figure 11-3) to the desired point in the waveform.
 
 A thin vertical line with a dot in the center appears in your audio clip 
at the beat marker’s position as well as in the Clip Trimmer waveform 
display.
 
 Although dragging the beat marker to your waveform is the true Mac 
way of achieving your goal, we would like to recommend the keyboard 
shortcut of just pressing M, which adds a beat marker at the playhead 
position in the Clip Trimmer.
Adding Audio from iTunes or GarageBand
iMovie and the Media Browser let you attach 
audio clips from your iTunes library and from 
GarageBand to your video. To display the audio 
that the Media Browser makes available, you 
can either choose Window➪Music and Sound 
Effects (Ô+1) or just click the Music and Sound 
Effects toolbar button (the one with the musical 
note on it). Select the audio you want and drag 
it, as shown in the following figure, onto the clip 
where you want it to start playing. A green bar 
appears below the frames where the audio clip 
will play.
You can use the Media Browser’s search field 
(at the bottom) to search for a sound effect or 
song by name or just scroll through the browser, 
previewing various audio pieces by clicking the 
Play button to the left of the search field.

4. Repeat Step 3 for every beat marker you wish to set.
 
5. Reposition beat markers as desired by dragging them to new 
positions.
 
6. Preview as desired in the Clip Trimmer and click Done when you’re 
satisfied.
To remove a beat marker, display the Clip Trimmer and drag the beat marker 
off the waveform.
By default, iMovie has View➪Snap to Beats turned on (selected), as indicated 
by the check mark next to it in the View menu. This means that when you 
drag a clip or still into a project containing audio tracks with beat markers, 
the clip or still automatically aligns with the beat marker. One example of 
how to use this feature is to create title credits with background stills, with 
an optional Ken Burns Effect. Here’s how:
 
1. Add a song that you want to have as your title credits score.
 
 See the sidebar, “Adding Audio from iTunes or GarageBand,” to see how 
easy it is to use your existing music library to enhance your video proj-
ect’s audio.
 
2. Set beat markers where you want your images and credits to appear.
 
3. Drag still images to the beat markers and apply titles to the stills as 
needed.
 
 You can also add titles by themselves if you don’t want an image behind 
it (for example, a traditional “over black” title screen). We cover adding 
stills in Chapter 7 and titles in Chapter 9.

▶ Sharing via the Media Browser
▶ Posting to YouTube
▶ Sharing via MobileMe
▶ Creating a DVD with iDVD
W
hen we were kids, our parents and teachers taught us that sharing was 
a good thing, and we bet that yours did too. Current technology — the 
Internet, mobile devices, DVD players, and personal computers — provide 
a cornucopia of ways to share your videos, and Apple gave iMovie the tools 
to assist you in sharing your video wealth. And, as with most things 
Apple-related, sharing your movies is easy, as we describe in 
this chapter.
iTunes Is for Movies, Too
A few years ago, Apple expanded the iTunes mis-
sion statement, adding video to the plethora of 
audio types handled by planet Earth’s best-known 
jukebox product. When your name and brand is 
as strong as the iTunes brand, you don’t change 
its name just because you’ve expanded the prod-
uct line; otherwise, Heinz would have stopped being 
Heinz when they added products other than pickles. So, 
don’t let the name fool you. iTunes is not just for music — 
it’s your movie library, too.
As your Mac’s media nerve center, iTunes is an obvious place to enjoy 
and share your movies. Here’s how to share your project with iTunes:

1. Choose Share➪iTunes.
 
 iTunes displays the dialog shown in Figure 12-1.
Figure 12-1: 
Use the 
handy grid 
to pick the 
sizes you 
want for 
your movie.
 
 
2. Select the sizes you want by clicking the appropriate check boxes, 
based upon how you’re going to view your iTunes-hosted movie.
 
 iTunes is your conduit to transfer your movie onto an iPod, an iPhone 
(or iPod Touch), or an AppleTV, in addition to being your Mac movie 
cataloger and viewing center. When you’ve selected a size, you can 
hover your mouse cursor over the circled i at the end of the row to see 
a tooltip detailing the codec used, the frame rate, the bit rate, and the 
estimated size, as shown in Figure 12-2.
 
 Squeezing data down in size is called compression and restoring it back 
to a usable form is called decompression. The software that performs 
compression and decompression is called a codec (compressor-decom-
pressor). You can only compress data so much without losing part of it. 
A codec that gives you back exactly what you started with is referred to 
as lossless. A codec that discards data that is, hopefully, not discernible 
to the eye or ear when restored to a usable form is called lossy. JPEG 
image compression is probably the best known example of lossy 
compression.
 
 If you want to know more about codecs, not to mention frame rate and 
bit rate, check out the nearby sidebar, “Codecs and frame rates and 
bit-rates, oh my!”
 
3. Click Publish.
 
 iMovie displays the progress dialog shown in Figure 12-3.
 
 Don’t be surprised if the initial time estimate seems fairly high — at first, 
iMovie doesn’t have enough data sampled to make a very accurate esti-
mate. The estimate comes down quite a bit after a bit of time elapses.

will take.
 
 
 When iMovie is finished creating all the different specified sizes, the 
dialog rolls back up into the iMovie workspace’s title bar and iTunes 
opens. Your movie is sitting in the iTunes Movies category, just waiting 
for you to watch it or send it on its way to one of your other devices, as 
shown in Figure 12-4.
You can now work in iTunes to distribute your movie to its various media 
centers, watch the movie, or just quit iTunes and go back to working in 
iMovie or some other application.
 
The type of dialog seen in Figures 12-1 and 12-3, where the dialog slides down 
out of the window’s title bar and then slides back up when dismissed is what 
programmers, technical types, and assorted other nerds call a sheet. Now, 
if you hear someone being a little pretentious and telling you to click in the 
sheet, you can smile knowingly, click in the dialog, and rob them of the sat-
isfaction of showing off their expertise by explaining yet another geeky term. 
You’ve seen lots of dialogs in this book, but we figured it was time to clue you 
in that some of them go by another name in techie circles.

 Chapter 12: Sharing Your Movie
Making Your Media Browsable 
in Other Applications
Just as iTunes is the nexus for sharing your content with devices such as the 
iPod or AppleTV, the aptly-named Media Browser is the means for sharing 
your media (sound, images, and video) with other applications, such as iDVD, 
iWeb, Keynote, and even non-Apple software products such as Roxio Toast 
Titanium. You’ve already seen the Media Browser in action in iMovie as the 
Codecs and frame rates and bit-rates, oh my!
For video and audio, MPEG (Motion Pictures 
Expert Group) compression is undoubtedly the 
pre-eminent format. But the video picture (pun 
intended) is more complicated than the still 
image arena. Three common MPEG formats 
exist (and a few that are far less common), with 
the not-so-original names MPEG-1, MPEG-
2, and MPEG-4. (Don’t ask about MPEG-3, it 
just never came to be.) If you’ve ever seen a 
VideoCD, you’ve encountered MPEG-1, and 
even if you haven’t seen a VideoCD, you have 
benefited from the work that went into it. The 
ubiquitous MP3 audio file format stands for 
MPEG-1 audio layer 3 and took the audio world 
by storm in the 1990s and early 2000s, much to 
the initial consternation of the recording indus-
try. DVD Video is almost always MPEG-2 (it can 
also be MPEG-1, but you seldom encounter 
commercial examples due to its lower quality). 
High definition television in the United States 
and a number of other countries is also MPEG-
2, but there are some countries where MPEG-4 
is broadcast due to its smaller size for the 
same quality (for example, Great Britain). Both 
MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 can be used on BluRay 
discs. The codec used for the MPEG-4 content 
that Apple supports on the iPod, iPhone, and 
AppleTV, as well as in iTunes is called H.264. 
For the trivia-inclined, this is sometimes called 
MPEG-4 Part 10 or MPEG-4 AVC (for Advanced 
Video Codec). Another common MPEG-4 codec, 
supported on many DVD players and popular 
in the online world, is called DivX (it also has 
a freeware equivalent called xvid). DivX is an 
example of MPEG-4 Part 2, also known as the 
Advanced Simple Profile (ASP). MPEG-4 Part 3 
is the audio form that iTunes has as its default 
encoding format, more commonly known as 
AAC for Advanced Audio Codec. You can find 
out lots more about these terms online, but 
we’re going to end our codec discussion here 
before our publisher tells us that this discussion 
has felled too many trees already.
As the rate parts of the terms bit rate and frame 
rate should indicate, these terms refer to time 
rather than space. We mentioned way back in 
Chapter 1 that frame rate tells how many still 
images pass the eye per second to give the 
illusion of continuous motion. If a frame rate is 
higher than about 16 fps (frames per second), the 
human eye and mind perceives continuity. Bit 
rate describes how much data, measured in bits 
(0s and 1s), is transferred per second. Common 
bit-rate examples are CD quality audio, which is 
44.1 Kbps (44,100 bits per second), DVD Audio at 
48 Kbps, and Blu-ray High-Def video and audio 
at between 48 Mbps and 54 Mbps (48,000,000 
bps and 54,000,000 bps). That’s a lot of 0s and 1s 
to transfer and process, and that’s where the 
codecs we described previously come into play. 
The fewer bits your hardware has to read from 
the disc per second, the more it can process in 
memory and send to your screen. Remember: 
Memory is a lot faster than disc, hundreds to 
thousands of times faster.

Part IV: Production and Distribution 
force behind the Music Browser and the Photo Browser (Chapter 8) and 
you’ll see it again in this book’s DVD coverage, coming soon in a chapter 
near you (er, that would be Chapter 13).
 
What became today’s Media Browser began as a mechanism to share data 
between separate applications — iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD — when 
Apple bundled them together to create the iLife’04 product. Apple quickly 
realized that the browser could allow them to leverage iLife content else-
where, such as in the Desktop and Accounts panes of System Preferences, 
the new Keynote presentation software, and even the professional media 
applications that now comprise the Final Cut Studio suite. Because program-
mers had to build the programming interfaces for it anyway, the rest of 
Apple’s developer community also got access in the frameworks provided 
in Xcode, the Mac OS X development environment.
Apple is appropriately fond of using effective and consistent interface ele-
ments, so what you’re about to see is likely to be very familiar. To share your 
project to the Media Browser, proceed as follows:
 
1. Choose Share➪Media Browser.
 
 The dialog shown in Figure 12-6 slides down out of your workspace’s 
title bar.
Figure 12-6: 
The Publish 
Your Project 
to the Media 
Browser 
dialog.
 
 
2. Select the size or sizes you want to publish by checking the appropri-
ate check boxes.
 
 You might note that there are a couple of extra columns in the grid com-
pared to Figure 12-1. That’s because iTunes handles hardware and the 
Media Browser handles all the formats needed for iTunes as well as for-
mats used by applications other than iTunes, such as iWeb. Additionally, 
in the iMovie 8.0.1 update, Apple added a high-definition (HD) export 
option for sharing via the Media Browser. The HD choice is not available 
when sharing with iTunes, iDVD, YouTube, or the MobileMe Gallery, but 
comes in really handy if you have a way to author high-definition video, 
such as Toast Titanium’s optional Blu-ray plug-in.

161
 Chapter 12: Sharing Your Movie
 
 Look back to Figure 12-2 to see what hovering your mouse pointer 
over the info button at the end of a row displays about the video you’re 
sharing.
 
3. Click Publish to start publishing your project for use by the Media 
Browser.
 
 The progress dialog shown back in Figure 12-3 as well as the accompa-
nying discussion also applies here.
The Project Library pane, shown in Figure 12-7, displays that our project has 
been published in the three largest sizes: Mobile, Medium, and Large.
Figure 12-7: 
The Project

If you no longer want your movie, or a particular size or set of sizes, to be 
available via the Media Browser, select the project in iMovie and choose 
Share➪Remove from Media Browser. The Remove Rendered Movies from the 
Media Browser dialog appears. Select the sizes that you no longer want pub-
lished and click Remove.
Channeling YouTube
Few Web sites achieve superstar status: Amazon (www.amazon.com) is king 
of Internet retailing, Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and Google (www.google.
com) dominate search, MySpace (www.myspace.com) and Facebook (www.
facebook.com) reign in the social networking realm, and eBay (www.ebay.
com) dominates the auction scene. But the Big Kahuna of Web video sharing 
has to be YouTube (www.youtube.com).
If you already have a YouTube account (called a channel, in keeping with the 
TV metaphor), publishing your iMovie video is a piece of cake. If you don’t 
have a channel, you need to register to get one before you can upload your 
movie to YouTube. Creating a YouTube account is discussed in the sidebar 
elsewhere in this chapter, “Creating a YouTube Account.” After you have that 
account, proceed as follows to share your video:

162
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
1. Choose Share➪YouTube.
 
 The Publish Your Project to YouTube dialog drops down out of the 
iMovie title bar, as shown in Figure 12-8.
 
 If your movie is longer than 10 minutes, a notice warning that your 
movie may be rejected by YouTube displays in the lower-left corner of 
the dialog, as seen in Figure 12-8. Click Cancel and shorten the movie in 
iMovie before trying to publish to YouTube or you’ll encounter the dialog 
shown in Figure 12-9 after Step 10 and you’ll have to start over, anyway.

2. If you have a YouTube or Google account (Google purchased YouTube 
in 2006) that iMovie already knows about, skip to Step 4. If not, click 
the Add button next to the Account drop-down list box to specify one.

163
 Chapter 12: Sharing Your Movie
 
 The Add Account pane appears as shown in Figure 12-10. If you don’t 
have a YouTube account, go to www.youtube.com and create one as 
described in the nearby sidebar, “Creating a YouTube Account.”

5. Fill in the Title text field.
 
 iMovie places your project’s name in the field by default — you can, of 
course, accept the suggestion or supply your own.
 
6. (Optional, but recommended.) Fill in the Description and Tags text 
boxes.
 
 Tags are keywords that YouTube viewers can search on to find your 
video.
 
7. Select either Mobile or Medium as your movie’s size.
 
8. If you want to restrict your movie’s viewers to those specified by your 
YouTube account, leave the Make This Movie Personal check box 
selected. To allow any YouTube visitor to view your movie, deselect 
the check box.
 
9. Click Next. The YouTube Terms of Service agreement appears.
 
10. If you wish to continue, click Publish.
 
 Assuming all is well, you’ll see a progress dialog marking the encoding 
and uploading process. When processing is complete, iMovie presents 
the dialog shown in Figure 12-12.
Figure 12-12: 
Success! 
Your movie 
is now on 
YouTube.
 
 
11. Click OK to dismiss the dialog and get back to work, click View to 
have your Web browser take you to your movie on YouTube, or click 
Tell a Friend to invoke your e-mail client and send a notification mis-
sive out to your adoring fans.
If (or when) you no longer want your video on YouTube, select your project 
in iMovie and choose Share➪Remove from YouTube. iMovie displays a dialog 
telling you that you have to remove your video from your My Videos page 
on YouTube before clicking Done. Click the Go to YouTube button and your 
Web browser opens to www.youtube.com. Sign into YouTube, if you’re not 
already, and you are taken to your My Videos page. Select the check box next 
to the movie you want to remove and click the Delete link. Confirm the dele-
tion in the dialog that appears and return to the iMovie workspace to click 
the Done button.

165
 Chapter 12: Sharing Your Movie
Using MobileMe to Share
 
 If you have one of Apple’s MobileMe accounts, you can publish your movies 
directly to your MobileMe Gallery. MobileMe enables you to enjoy all the 
bells and whistles of iLife in addition to the more mundane e-mail, iDisk, sync-
ing, and so forth features, and we think it’s a great investment (especially if 
you subscribe at the discounts available through Amazon and other online 
retailers). If you don’t have a MobileMe account yet, you can (at least at 
the time we’re writing this) get a 60-day trial by visiting www.apple.com/
mobileme and clicking on the Free Trial link. MobileMe is priced at $99/year, 
but the Amazon price is $63.50 at present (as of April 2009). As of this writing, 
it’s at the top-right corner of the page, but Web pages change frequently, so if 
you don’t find it there, look around a bit.
Publishing your movie to your MobileMe Gallery is, as usual, straightforward, 
but there are a few steps to the process:
 
1. Choose Share➪MobileMe Gallery.
 
 If you are signed into your MobileMe account, you see the dialog shown 
in Figure 12-13. Otherwise, you see the dialog in Figure 12-14, giving you 
a chance to sign in, if you have a subscription, or to get a free trial by 
clicking the Learn More button and signing up.
Creating a YouTube account
You need either a registered YouTube or 
Google account (Google owns YouTube, after 
paying a mere $1.65 billion) to post your videos 
to YouTube. If you don’t have either, you can 
create a YouTube account by visiting www.
youtube.com and clicking the Sign In link 
that appears near the top right of the page. A 
secure page on www.google.com appears 
bearing a Sign Up for YouTube link near the 
bottom right of the page. Click that link to bring 
up the Create Your YouTube Account page. Fill 
in the blanks. You need to select the check box 
indicating that you accept YouTube’s Terms of 
Use and Privacy Policy (the Privacy Policy is 
pretty much the expected boiler-plate, but you 
should at least check out the Terms of Service 
to know what kinds of videos are and are not 
allowed). Click the Create Account button. You 
receive an e-mail from YouTube to verify the 
account. Click the link in the e-mail message 
to verify it and your browser takes you back 
to www.youtube.com. You now have an 
account.
By the way, Apple’s iMovie Help tells you that 
clicking Add in the YouTube publishing dialog 
takes you to YouTube’s Web site to create the 
account, but it doesn’t. You need to make the 
visit on your own, thus this sidebar.

 You can choose Everyone, Only Me, or Edit Names and Passwords. If 
you choose the latter, you see the Names and Passwords dialog in Figure

 iMovie encodes and uploads your movie to your MobileMe Gallery, 
displaying the usual progress dialogs. After the movies are finished 
uploading to MobileMe, iMovie displays the dialog shown in Figure 12-16. 
Clicking the Tell a Friend button invokes your e-mail program so that you 
can send out an e-nnouncement (our made-up term for this ubiquitous fea-
ture). View takes you to your movie using your Web browser, and OK just 
dismisses the dialog so that you can get back to work or play.

and choose Share➪Remove from MobileMe Gallery. iMovie displays a con-
firmation dialog telling you that the operation cannot be undone. Click 
Continue to perform the removal or Cancel to leave it published.
Sharing Movies Old-School with iDVD
Sharing video on the Web, either via MobileMe or YouTube, is great, assum-
ing that all the people with whom you want to share have good Internet 
access (broadband is highly recommended for video) and, in the case of 
MobileMe, are running relatively current Web browsers. (Further, to make 
your video permanently available, you have to keep the account going in per-
petuity and have the space your movie occupies unavailable for new movies 
or other use.) However, if you want Grandma and Grandpa to see the video 
and have it as a permanent keepsake, it’s probably time to get physical, and 
that means sending them a DVD that they can watch on their TV set (or com-
puter).
Sharing via iDVD is very simple. Just proceed as follows:
 
1. Choose Share➪iDVD.
 
 iMovie presents the progress dialog shown in Figure 12-17, telling you 
that it is preparing the movie for iDVD.
Figure 12-17: 
iMovie lets 
you know 
that it’s 
preparing 
your project 
for use with 
iDVD.
 
 
2. When complete, iDVD launches and your movie is automatically 
placed in an iDVD project, as shown in Figure 12-18.
 
 This is where placing chapter markers, as described in Chapter 10, pays 
big dividends. As we explain in Chapters 13 and 14, iDVD automatically 
creates submenus so that your DVD’s audience can navigate directly to 
scenes of interest.

Making a Quick DVD
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a running start on your DVD project
▶ Making a DVD directly from your FireWire camera
I
t seems as though DVD technology has been around for eons, but, as we 
write this book, it’s really only about fifteen years old! Time sure flies 
when you’re having fun.
Nonetheless, many people feel DVDs are passé, if not completely moribund, 
especially in the face of HDTV, Blu-ray discs, and streaming video services 
such as YouTube (www.youtube.com) and Hulu (www.hulu.com). In fact, 
Apple itself seems ambivalent about the DVD format: iDVD is the only one of 
all the components of iLife ‘09 that didn’t get even a minor update from 
the previous version of iLife.
But, unlike Monty Python’s famous parrot, DVD is not 
resting, nor is it pining for the fjords. It is a stable, 
mature technology, and still one of the best ways to 
get your video creations into the hands of your 
friends and family.
That leaves the question, “How do you get the video 
onto a DVD in the first place?” In the previous chap-
ter, we cover one way: via the Share menu in iMovie. 
In this chapter, you’re going to get a look at two 
other options.
Using Magic iDVD
Like other applications in the iLife suite, iDVD keeps track of what you 
were working on, and it opens that project when you start iDVD. But if 
you have no previous project for iDVD to open, or if you close your current 
project, you see the window shown in Figure 13-1.

Click the Magic iDVD button, and iDVD presents the drag-and-drop Magic 
iDVD window as shown in Figure 13-2.

173
 Chapter 13: Making a Quick DVD
On this simple screen, you can add the media — movies and photos — that 
you want to appear on your DVD. You can also specify the title of your DVD 
and choose the theme that controls the appearance of the DVD’s menu 
screens and menu buttons.
 
On a DVD, a menu refers to a screen that contains buttons. You use your DVD 
player’s remote control to select a button on a menu in order to see another 
menu, to play a movie, to view a scene in a movie, or to play a DVD slideshow 
(that is, a collection of photographs on the DVD that play with optional 
background music).
And where do you get the media to put on the DVD? One place is the iLife 
Media Browser, which appears on the right side of the Magic iDVD window, 
as shown in Figure 13-3.
Figure 13-3: 
The iDVD 
Media 
Browser.
 
The Media Browser offers you the following media:
 
✓ Audio: These sources include your GarageBand compositions and any 
audio in your iTunes library.
 
✓ Photos: Sources for these are your iPhoto library and your Aperture 
library.
 
✓ Movies: The Media Browser displays your iMovie Projects and Events, 
video from your iPhoto Library, video from your iTunes Library, and any 
other video files in your home directory’s Movies folder.

174
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
Not all video and audio files from these sources are available in the Media 
Browser, however. iMovie projects and GarageBand compositions need to 
be shared explicitly with the Media Browser in order for them to be available 
to iDVD. For example, you need to use iMovie’s Share➪Media Browser com-
mand and specify the output size of a movie before the iDVD Media Browser 
can offer it. Otherwise, you see the message shown in Figure 13-4 when you 
click the iMovie project in the Media Browser.
 
You are not limited to the Media Browser as a media source for iDVD. You 
can use video, audio, and photos from anywhere on your Mac. Just drag the 
media from a Finder window into your DVD project.
To build a DVD project with Magic iDVD, follow these steps:
 
1. Drag one or more movies from the Media Browser to the Drop Movies 
Here strip in the left side of the Magic iDVD window.
 
 You can shift-click or Ô-click to select multiple movies to drag, as shown 
in Figure 13-5. The number of movies being dragged appears beside your 
pointer as you drag.
 
2. Optionally, drag one or more selections of photos to the Drop Photos 
Here strip.
 
 Each group of photos that you drop on the strip becomes a DVD slide-
show, represented by a thumbnail, as shown in Figure 13-6. Note that if 
you drop photos on top of an existing slideshow in the strip, those 
photos are added to that slideshow. An iDVD slideshow can have as 
many as 9,801 slides.
 
 In fact, a DVD can contain no more than 9,801 images. If, for some odd 
reason, you put that many images in a single slideshow, you won’t be 
able to create any more slideshows in your iDVD project.

 You can also drag and drop audio from the Media Browser onto a 
slideshow thumbnail in the Drop Photos Here strip. The audio becomes 
the background audio for that slideshow presentation. An audio icon 
appears on the slideshow thumbnail when you drop audio on it.
 
3. In the DVD Title box at the top of the screen, type a name for your 
DVD.
 
4. Select a theme for your DVD.
 
 The available themes, by default, are those from the most recent version 
of iDVD. However, you can choose theme collections from other ver-
sions of iDVD from the menu to the right of the theme scroller, and even 
show all of the themes at once, as shown in Figure 13-7.
 
 When you install iDVD, you have the option of installing additional iDVD 
media. If you don’t install that media, you only have the most recent 
iDVD themes available to you.
 
5. In the lower-right of the Magic iDVD window, click Create Project.
 
 After you click the Create Project button, iDVD prepares the project 
for you. When it is finished, the Magic iDVD window is replaced by 
the project window for your iDVD project. Figure 13-8 shows a project 
window created by Magic iDVD.

At this point, you can customize the project or just burn the DVD; see 
Chapter 14 and Chapter 15 to find out how to customize a project and see 
Chapter 16 to discover how to burn a DVD project.
Creating a OneStep DVD
For even more instant gratification, you can use iDVD’s OneStep DVD 
feature — if, that is, you have both of the following items:
 
✓ A video camera with a FireWire connector: Many recent video cameras 
have only USB connectors.
 
✓ A Mac with a FireWire port: Some recent MacBook models do not have 
FireWire ports.
 
✓ The proper cables and adapters: There are at least three different types 
of FireWire connectors — the four-pin FireWire 400 connector (some-
times called iLink), the six-pin FireWire 400 connector, and the new(ish) 
nine-pin FireWire 800 connector. Adapters exist to convert from any of 
these to any other, but you have to have the right ones for your camera 
and computer.
Assuming that you do have what you need, you can make a DVD in only a few 
steps — not quite the one step that the feature name would have you believe, 
but in very few steps. This feature creates a DVD from all of the footage in your 
camera without putting you to the bother of setting up an iDVD project at all.
The OneStep DVD button appears on the iDVD start screen, shown at the 
beginning of this chapter in Figure 13-1. Figure 13-9 shows you the message 
you get when you click the OneStep DVD button without having a camera 
connected.

177
 Chapter 13: Making a Quick DVD
Figure 13-9: 
iDVD tells 
you how 
to use 
OneStep 
DVD.
 
The message says everything you need to know: Follow those instructions, 
wait for iDVD to recognize the disc, and then sit back as iDVD takes control of 
your camera.
By the way — we count six steps to this process (seven if you have to insert 
the tape into the camera):
 
1. On the iDVD start screen, click OneStep DVD.
 
2. Connect your camera to your Mac.
 
3. Turn the camera on.
 
4. Put the camera into VCR mode.
 
5. Click OK.
 
6. Insert a blank disc into your Mac’s DVD burner.
 
iDVD rewinds the tape in the camera to the beginning, so don’t expect to 
queue up a scene on the tape and just capture the video from there.
Figure 13-10 shows the dialog that appears as iDVD works its way through 
the recording. The dialog shows the amount of material captured so far and 
the amount of time available on the DVD. This second figure depends on the 
capacity of the recordable DVD and may be quite inaccurate at the beginning 
of the capture process.
Figure 13-10: 
Capturing 
the OneStep 
DVD video.
 

178
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
Although OneStep DVD always captures from the beginning of the tape, you 
don’t have to capture the entire contents. You can press Stop at any time, 
which produces the dialog shown in Figure 13-11.
Figure 13-11: 
Clicking 
Stop lets 
you burn 
what you’ve 
captured.
 
After capturing is complete, iDVD encodes the video that it has captured and 
burns it to the DVD. This process can take several hours, depending on the 
amount of video captured and the speed of your Mac. (You can, by the way, 
turn off your camera and disconnect it after iDVD has begun encoding the 
video that it has captured.)
 
Make sure that you have plenty of storage available on your Mac’s startup 
drive. iDVD stores the captured video in a temporary location on that drive, 
and a full tape can consume many gigabytes of storage: as much as twenty-
four gigabytes for ninety minutes of imported video along with the encoded 
copy that gets burned to the DVD.
When iDVD finishes burning the disc, it ejects it and gives you the opportu-
nity of burning another copy. This copy uses the previously encoded video, 
so burning a second DVD doesn’t take nearly as long.
 
 And what do you get when you make such a DVD? You get a DVD with a 
generic name (see the icon in the left margin) that is set to play automatically 
when you insert it in a DVD player or open it with your Mac’s DVD Player 
application.

Working with iDVD Themes
In This Chapter
▶ Picking a theme for your project
▶ Switching to a different theme
▶ Choosing an aspect ratio
▶ Making changes to a theme
▶ Adding content to drop zones
▶ Saving a customized theme
i
DVD provides you with a number of carefully crafted, professionally 
designed themes that you use to create the look of your iDVD project. 
These themes provide designs for menu screens, buttons, and highlights.
Much like iMovie themes, iDVD themes give you a running 
start on designing your DVD. (We cover iMovie themes in 
Chapter 8.) But unlike iMovie themes, which you can 
use or not use as you like, you have to take that run-
ning start with iDVD: You can’t make a DVD without 
choosing an Apple theme as your starting point.
Don’t worry — Apple isn’t out to cramp your 
style completely. You can discard many of the 
elements that an iDVD theme provides and you 
can override others. Although you must start 
with an Apple theme, you can end up with a DVD 
design that is more or less your own. And you can 
even save your DVD design as a theme for future use.
Selecting a Theme
Apple gives you quite a few DVD themes from which to choose. You get ten 
themes from iDVD version 7.0 (the version of iDVD that comes with iLife ’08 
and iLife ’09), ten more themes from iDVD version 6.0, and, if you want them, 
dozens of themes from iDVD versions even earlier than that.

Part IV: Production and Distribution 
When you create an iDVD project, you can see the available themes in the 
iDVD project window by clicking the Themes button at the lower right. This 
displays the theme thumbnails in the pane above the button, as shown in 
Figure 14-1.
Figure 14-1: 
Pick a 
theme from 
the Themes 
Browser.
 
 
To select a theme for a new project, simply click the theme in the Themes 
pane. iDVD immediately applies the theme to your project.
Strictly speaking, the term theme applies to a single menu design. A collection 
of related themes are more accurately referred to as theme families, although 
iDVD often uses theme to refer either to a single menu design or to the theme 
family to which the menu design belongs.
Each iDVD theme family comprises menu designs that include the following:
 
✓ Background graphics: Each menu design has a background graphic over 
which the menu elements are displayed. As we explain in the section, 
“Customizing a Theme,” later in this chapter, you can replace these with 
graphics of your own choosing.
 
✓ Default fonts: The menu buttons and titles that you place on a DVD 
menu use specific fonts in specific sizes and styles chosen to harmonize 
with the theme design. However, you can override these as well, as we 
cover in Chapter 15.

181
 Chapter 14: Working with iDVD Themes
 
✓ Menu button designs: By default, the menu button designs for each 
theme are text buttons that use the menu’s default font. You can, how-
ever, apply different button designs, including designs that incorporate 
video loops. Chapter 15 explains how to do this.
The theme families installed with iDVD can also include the following:
 
✓ Video animation: The default iDVD theme families incorporate motion 
menus, which play animations in a loop over the background graphic. 
The loops often contain an intro — an animation that plays when the 
menu first appears on screen — and an outro — an animation that plays 
when the menu leaves the screen. You can enable or disable these, 
and control the length of the animation loop, as explained later in 
“Customizing a Theme.”
 
✓ Background audio: The motion menu animations frequently are accom-
panied with an audio loop that plays while the menu is on the screen. 
You can eliminate the audio, adjust its volume, or replace the audio 
track with audio of your own choosing, as we explain later in the section 
entitled “Customizing a Theme.”
 
✓ Drop zones: Most menu designs have ornamental drop zones into which 
you can drop video or still images. These drop zones serve no functional 
purpose, providing only additional eye-catching menu animation. You 
edit drop zones with iDVD’s drop zone editor, or you can suppress the 
display of a menu’s drop zones, as described later in — you guess it — 
“Customizing a Theme.”
Each theme family in the iDVD default installation comes with several related 
menu designs that you can use for specific purposes. Figure 14-2 shows the 
Shelves theme family from the iDVD 6.0 theme collection, expanded to show 
the three menu designs that belong to the family.
Figure 14-2: 
A theme 
family 
expanded.
 

182
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
The three menu designs in a typical iDVD theme family comprise the following:
 
✓ Main: You typically use the Main menu design for the main screen that 
your user sees, and the screen that the DVD returns to when the user 
clicks the Title button on the DVD player’s remote control. The main 
menu contains menu buttons that link to the primary contents of the 
DVD, such as the featured movie or slideshow. Main menus frequently 
have menu buttons that lead to submenus containing additional DVD 
content.
 
✓ Chapters: You use a Chapters menu to offer the user menu buttons that 
lead to individual scenes in the DVD’s featured movie. When you add a 
movie to your iDVD that has chapter markers, iDVD automatically cre-
ates one or more Chapters menus that contain menu buttons for the 
individual chapters in the movie.
 
✓ Extras: You use this kind of menu for additional DVD features, such as 
secondary movies or slideshows.
 
Menus that you access from the main DVD menu are often referred to as 
submenus.
You don’t have to use every menu design in your project. Many DVD projects 
can get by with just a single Main menu. In fact, many of the older, optional 
themes that come with iDVD contain only a single menu design. These are 
useful for simple DVD projects.
And speaking of older, optional themes, here’s how you can get them:
 
1. From the menu at the top of the Themes pane, choose Old Themes.
 
 The optional themes appear in the pane, dimmed, as shown in Figure 14-3.
Figure 14-3: 
Older 
optional 
themes 
appear 
dim in the 
Themes 
pane if 
they aren’t 
installed.
 

183
 Chapter 14: Working with iDVD Themes
 
2. Click any of the dimmed theme thumbnails.
 
 A dialog appears that offers you theme installation options. You have 
the following options:
 
• Download Now: Choose this to launch the Software Update appli-
cation to download and install the themes.
 
• Download Later: Choose this to have the themes appear in the 
Software Update application the next time you run it.
 
• Install from DVD: Choose this to install the themes from your iLife 
’09 installation DVD.
 
3. Click an option in the dialog and then click OK.
The optional themes require 700MB of disk storage. Naturally, using either of 
the download options also requires an active Internet connection.
 
You may have some trouble with these older themes. Neither of us have 
gotten the download options in iDVD to work with some of the old themes: 
Software Update simply tells us that our software is up to date. What’s more, 
if you received your copy of iDVD with a new Mac, you won’t have a separate 
iLife installation DVD. Instead, you have to find the iDVD installation package 
on the Install or Restore DVD that came with your Mac.
Changing Themes
Picking a theme does not lock you in to your choice forevermore: You can 
change the theme of an individual menu or of the entire project at any time.
Figure 14-4 shows the main menu of the iDVD project that we created to dem-
onstrate Magic iDVD in Chapter 13. The project uses the Shelves theme from 
the 6.0 Themes collection.
Figure 14-4:

menu from

theme.
 

184
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
Figure 14-5 shows the same project after we applied the Forever theme from 
the 7.0 Themes collection.
Figure 14-5: 
The same 
menu after 
the Forever 
theme is 
applied.
 
As you can see, iDVD moved the title text and the menu buttons around to 
match the new theme’s layout, and retained the contents of the three drop 
zones from the old theme but left the others empty, waiting for content.
 
To apply a different theme to an existing project, simply click the theme 
family you want to apply in the Themes pane. iDVD displays the dialog shown 
in Figure 14-6. Note the helpful advice you see when you expand the dialog: 
You can change the themes of all of a project’s menus, or apply a theme to 
individual menus on a case-by-case basis.
Figure 14-6: 
iDVD may 
ask to 
confirm a 
change of 
theme.
 

185
 Chapter 14: Working with iDVD Themes
iDVD’s General preferences offers a set of options that apply to theme 
changes:
 
1. Choose iDVD➪Preferences, or press Ô+comma (,) and then click 
General.
 
2. Click one of the When Changing Themes options:
 
• Use theme default values: Select this to have iDVD use only the 
theme’s design styles for all menu elements and ignore any cus-
tomizations you may have made to the menu and the elements 
on it.
 
• Retain changes to theme defaults: Select this option to have iDVD 
respect any customized elements. For example, if you change the 
size and font of a text title on the main menu, the title retains those 
settings when the theme changes.
 
• Always ask: iDVD asks you what to do about changed menu ele-
ments when you switch themes.
 
3. Close the Preferences window.
When you switch to a theme designed for a different aspect ratio than 
the one your project uses, iDVD asks you if you want to switch to the new 
theme’s native aspect ratio, as shown in Figure 14-7. Changing aspect ratios is 
discussed in the next section.
Figure 14-7: 
Changing 
to a theme 
with a

aspect 
ratio.
 
Customizing a Theme
There are lots of ways to override the menu design imposed by the theme 
that you have chosen. The key to many of these changes is the Inspector 
window.

186
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
The Inspector window is a most useful tool in iDVD, and, as befitting its 
importance, you can invoke it multiple ways. To show and hide the Inspector 
window, you can choose View➪Show Inspector, or you can press Ô+I, or you 
can click the circled i button at the lower-left of the project window.
Figure 14-8 shows what the Inspector window looks like when it is focused on 
the menu displayed in the iDVD window.
Figure 14-8: 
Inspecting a 
DVD menu.
 
 
The Inspector window, in its Menu Info guise, gives you control over these 
elements of the current theme:
 
✓ The menu background, including any motion animation: You can 
adjust the length of the motion loop and disable or enable any intro or 
outro that the theme may provide.
 
✓ The menu audio: You can set the volume of any audio that’s played 
when the menu is onscreen. You can drag audio from iDVD’s Media pane 
to the audio well in the Inspector window to change the menu audio, 
and you can drag audio out of the well to remove it.
 
✓ Menu button placement and appearance: You can set the highlight 
color for the active menu button. You can enable or disable the button 
placement grid that a theme may impose on the menu. The care and 
feeding of menu buttons is described in Chapter 15.
 
✓ Drop done visibility: You can hide all the drop zones, if any, that the 
theme provides. Because drop zones are merely ornamental menu ele-
ments, you might prefer the cleaner look (and lower overhead) of a 
menu sans drop zones.
The media you place in drop zones is one way in which you can customize 
a menu’s theme. Although you can add media to drop zones by dragging 

187
 Chapter 14: Working with iDVD Themes
items directly to them from the Media browser, that can be difficult if your 
project employs one of the more complex menu themes that move drop 
zones onscreen and offscreen during their motion loops. The iDVD drop zone 
editor, shown in Figure 14-9, was made for such situations.
Figure 14-9: 
The 
drop zone 
editor gives 
access to 
menu back-
ground and 
drop zones.
 
 
 You can show the drop zone editor by clicking the drop zone editor button at 
the bottom of the project window, or by double-clicking any visible drop zone 
in the current menu. You can then drag media into or out of the drop zone 
wells for that menu. As an added bonus, you can also replace the menu back-
ground by dragging media (either a still image or a movie) into the menu well 
in the drop zone editor. Spiffy!
 
You can drag the diamond-shaped motion playhead in the scrubber bar 
below the menu pane to scroll through the animation of any motion menu 
and bring different drop zones into view (it helps to click the Motion button 
to turn off menu animation when you scrub through a menu so that the 
motion playhead stays put). You can also enable or disable menu intros and 
outros with the check boxes at either side of the bar.
You can drag the following items into a drop zone:
 
✓ Movies: The video plays in a loop as long as the menu is visible. Click 
the drop zone in the menu pane to show the Movie control, as seen in 
Figure 14-10. You can set the start and end points of a drop zone video 
with this control. We suggest you choose short video segments for your 

188
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
drop zones: the longer the video, the less room on the DVD for more 
useful material.
Figure 14-10: 
Adjust the 
length of a 
drop zone 
video.
 
 
✓ Photos: The simplest of media. It just sits there, looking pretty.
 
✓ Multiple photos for a slideshow: The photos play in a slideshow. You 
can add as many as 99 images to a drop zone. Click the drop zone to see 
the Photos control (shown in Figure 14-11), which you use to select an 
initial photo for the slideshow. You can click the Edit Order button in 
the Photos control to see a simplified slideshow editor (the slideshow 
editor is described in Chapter 15).
Figure 14-11: 
Choose 
an initial 
image in a 
drop zone 
slideshow.
 
 
If the shape of the drop zone crops the image or video in it, you can hold 
down Ô and drag the media around inside the drop zone to position it to 
your liking.

189
 Chapter 14: Working with iDVD Themes
Finally, you can change the aspect ratio of the iDVD project to custom-
ize the theme. Although each iDVD theme is designed for either a wide-
screen or a standard aspect ratio, you can switch to the other one: Choose 
Project➪Switch to Standard (4:3) or Project➪Switch to Widescreen (16:9).
The aspect ratio you choose has some implications for any custom back-
ground images you may add to a menu. iDVD crops custom background 
images to fit the exact dimensions of a DVD screen, as follows:
 
✓ Standard: 720 x 540 (NTSC) or 768 x 576 (PAL)
 
✓ Widescreen: 854 x 480 (NTSC) or 1024 x 576 (PAL)
 
PAL? NTSC? These are the two analog video output standards supported by 
DVDs. NTSC is the standard used in North America and Japan, among other 
places. PAL is commonly used in most of Europe. PAL and NTSC specify 
slightly different aspect ratios for both standard and widescreen video.
Saving a Theme
You can save any theme that you’ve customized (and, truth be told, even 
those you haven’t) as a Favorite, as shown in Figure 14-12. Themes saved as 
favorites appear in the Themes pane in the project window when you select 
Favorites from the menu above the Themes list.
Figure 14-12: 
One of our 
favorite 
things.
 
 
To save a theme as a favorite, choose File➪Save Theme as Favorite. The 
dialog shown in Figure 14-13 appears. The favorite’s proposed name is the 
same as the current theme with the word “favorite” appended.
Figure 14-13: 
Saving a 
favorite.
 

190
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
Themes you save as favorites are only available from your current user 
account unless you select the Shared for All Users check box in the dialog 
shown in Figure 14-13.
 
By default, if the favorite name you supply matches the name of an existing 
favorite, the new favorite replaces it and you won’t be able to get the older 
favorite back. You can deselect Replace Existing when you save a favorite to 
avoid inadvertent obliteration of an existing favorite.
The following items are saved in the favorite theme:
 
✓ Customizations to default button and label styles, such as font, color, 
size, and highlight
 
✓ Customizations to the menu background
 
✓ Media added to drop zones
 
✓ Background audio added to the menu
 
When you save a favorite, the favorite comprises the current menu only, not 
the entire theme family. If you have customized different menus in a theme 
family, you need to save each menu separately.
You can’t remove favorites you’ve saved from within iDVD, but you can find 
them and drag them to the Trash in the Finder as you would any other file 
or folder. Favorites saved for your user account are in ~/Library/Application 
Support/iDVD/Favorites/, as shown in Figure 14-14. Shared favorites reside 
in /Users/Shared/iDVD/Favorites/ at the top level of your system disk.

Assembling Your DVD
In This Chapter
▶ Putting movies on your DVD
▶ Making menu buttons
▶ Preparing a DVD slideshow
▶ Previewing your DVD
I
n the previous chapter, we covered the themes that control the appear-
ance of your DVD, and you saw how to customize DVD themes so that 
they look just the way you want. But a DVD without content is like a big tub 
of popcorn without the popcorn. In this chapter, you find out how to add the 
crunchy, tasty content that your audience craves: content like movies, slide-
shows, and menu buttons and text.
Adding DVD Content
As much fun as designing a DVD menu is, menus 
exist only to provide a way for the audience to find 
out what stuff is on the DVD, and to provide a way 
for the audience to play that stuff. That’s what 
menu text and menu buttons are about:
 
✓ Menu buttons: Menu buttons provide your 
audience with access to other menus, or to the 
movies and slideshows on the DVD. Menu but-
tons can appear as text (most themes use text 
buttons by default), as text over an ornamental 
graphic shape, or text with an accompanying thumb-
nail that represents the material to which the button 
leads. You add menu buttons by adding movies, slideshows, or 
submenus to the current menu as described later in this chapter.

✓ Menu text: Use menu text to label a menu. Menu text is not dynamic or 
interactive; it’s simply there to be read. Most menu text is very short, 
and simply describes the menu’s contents, or reiterates the name of 
the DVD itself. Keep in mind that TVs, even high-definition TVs, are not 
designed for presenting massive quantities of text to the audience. Every 
menu that you create in iDVD has a default menu text label. You can 
add additional menu text labels to a menu, if necessary, by choosing 
Project➪Add Text, or by pressing Ô+K.
Adding a movie
You add menu buttons differently from the way you add menu text: to add 
a menu button, you simply add content to the DVD. When you do, a menu 
button appears on the current DVD menu to provide access to that content. 
The most common type of content you add to a DVD is, of course, a movie.
There are several ways to add a movie to a menu:
 
✓ Click the Add button at the lower left of the project window and choose 
Add Movie, as shown in Figure 15-1.
Figure 15-1: 
One way to 
add a movie 
to the cur-
rent menu.
 
 
✓ Choose Project➪Add Movie, or press Shift+Ô+O.
 
✓ Drag a movie thumbnail from the Media pane, or from a Finder window, 
and drop it anywhere on the menu other than in a drop zone.
This last method adds a movie menu button to the menu and automatically 
links it to the movie that you dragged. The first two methods add the movie 
menu button to the menu, but you still have to attach an actual movie to it.
You can tell if a movie menu button lacks an associated movie if a small cau-
tion icon is present on it, as shown in Figure 15-2.

193
 Chapter 15: Assembling Your DVD
Figure 15-2: 
The caution 
icon and 
button label 
indicates 
a movie 
button that 
lacks a 
movie.
 
This icon means the button lacks an associated movie.
To add a movie to a movie menu button that lacks one, drag a movie either 
from the Media pane or from a Finder window and drop it on the menu 
button, as shown in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-3: 
Drag and 
drop a 
movie on 
an unlinked 
movie but-
ton to attach 
the movie 
to it.
 
When you add a movie to a movie menu button, the menu button dis-
plays the movie name (with one exception, which we describe at the next 
Remember icon, that involves movies with chapter markers).
When you drag the movie from the Media pane, the menu button label shows 
the movie name as it appears in the Media pane. When you drag the movie 
from a Finder window, the menu button label displays the filename of the 
movie. We describe how to edit the menu button label later in this chapter in 
the section, “Editing menu text and menu buttons.”
 
iDVD handles movies with chapter markers differently than the way it 
handles movies without markers. When you add a movie that does not have 
chapter markers, the menu button links directly to the movie on the final 
DVD you create: The user selects the menu button and the movie plays. 
When you add a movie with chapter markers, iDVD not only adds the movie, 
but, by default, adds a scene selection menu as well, although you can turn 
that behavior off in iDVD’s Movie Preferences. The scene selection menu uses 
the theme family’s Chapters theme if the family has one. (Theme families are 
described in Chapter 14.)

iDVD adds the scene selection menu in different ways depending on how you 
add a movie to a menu:
 
✓ If you drop a movie with chapter markers directly on a menu that has 
no movies, iDVD creates two menu buttons, one labeled Play Movie 
and the other labeled Scene Selection. The movie name is not included 
in either menu button label. The Scene Selection menu button links to 
a scene selection menu. This menu contains scene menu buttons that 
play the movie from each chapter marker, as shown in Figure 15-4. 
Scene selection menus can have as many as six scene menu buttons. If 
the movie contains more than six chapters, additional scene selection 
menus are created as needed.
Figure 15-4: 
iDVD

matically as

✓ If you drop a movie with chapter markers on a movie menu button 
that has no attached movie, iDVD labels the menu button with the 
movie name, as described earlier in this section, and creates a new 
movie submenu.
 
 The movie submenu contains Play Movie and Scene Selection menu but-
tons, as shown in Figure 15-5. The Scene Selection menu button links to 
the movie’s scene selection menu.
 
We recommend that you add movies using the drag-and-drop method when 
your project is a simple one, such as one that includes only a single movie 
with chapters. For projects that include several movies and slideshows, use 
the Add Movie command: This method gives each movie with chapters its 
own menu, and thereby helps streamline your DVD’s main menu.

Adding a slideshow
DVDs are a great way to share photos with people, and they can be a natural 
fit with the video on a DVD: for example, a college graduation DVD with both 
video and still photos, or a student film with a special collection of produc-
tion stills. iDVD makes photos available as slideshows on the DVD.
You add slideshows to a menu in much the same way as you add movies:
 
✓ Click the Add button at the lower left of the project window and choose 
Add Slideshow.
 
✓ Choose Project➪Add Slideshow or press Ô+L.
 
✓ Drag a group of photos from the Media pane, or from a Finder window, 
and drop it anywhere on the menu other than in a drop zone.
If you drop an iPhoto Event or iPhoto album, the label on the menu button 
that leads to the slideshow has the name of the album or Event; otherwise, 
the menu button label is My Slideshow. We discuss how to change the label 
and menu button appearance in the next section.
To edit a slideshow, double-click the slideshow menu button. The iDVD slide-
show editor, shown in Figure 15-6, appears in place of the current menu. You 
use the editor to set the slideshow pacing, photo order, accompanying audio, 
and the transitions between photos.

You control the order of the slides in the slideshow by dragging the slide 
thumbnails into place as shown in Figure 15-7.

You control the timing and transition effect between slides with the controls 
at the left of the slideshow editor’s toolbar, as shown in more detail in Figure 
15-8.

 Chapter 15: Assembling Your DVD
The Slide Duration menu lets you set how long each slide stays on screen. 
You can set it for 1, 3, 5, or 10 seconds. You can also set the show to adjust 
slide durations so that the show lasts exactly as long as the accompanying 
audio. You give a slideshow accompanying audio by dragging audio from the 
Media pane to the audio well in the center of the slideshow toolbar (visible at 
the bottom of Figure 15-6). You can also set the slide duration to be manual, 
which means that you control when slides change by using the DVD player 
controls.
The Transition menu provides twelve different transition effects, including 
flips, reveals, dissolves, and so on. You can also choose to have no transi-
tion effect. If an effect involves a spatial move, such as a flip, you can set 
the direction of the effect with the round four-position controller beside the 
Transition menu.
 
The effect you choose controls all of the transitions; you cannot set transi-
tion effects on a per-slide basis.
The Settings button at the right of the editor’s toolbar brings up the dialog 
shown in Figure 15-9.
Figure 15-9: 
The 
slideshow 
Settings 
dialog.
 
Here’s what the dialog options mean:
 
✓ Loop Slideshow: When this is enabled, the slideshow repeats from the 
beginning after all the slides are shown. This is useful for kiosk applica-
tions, parties, or just to waste electricity.
 
✓ Display Navigation Arrows: This option superimposes navigation 
arrows on the TV screen when the slideshow plays. Enable this option 
when you choose Manual from the Slide Duration menu.
 
✓ Add Image Files to DVD-ROM: Enable this option to have iDVD set aside 
a portion of the DVD’s storage for files that you can access on a com-
puter, and to put the original photo files that make up the slideshow in 
that storage space. This allows the recipient of the DVD, for example, to 
print the photos in their original resolution.

198
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
✓ Show Titles and Comments: If you have added titles or comments to the 
photos in iPhoto, they appear superimposed on the photos when the 
slideshow plays if this is selected. You can also see and edit the titles 
and comments in the slideshow editor.
 
✓ Duck Audio While Playing Movies: If the album or Events you drag to 
the editor include video, enable this to have any accompanying audio 
in the slideshow lower its volume when a video clip plays.
After you finish editing a slideshow, click Return at the right of the editor 
toolbar to close the editor.
Editing menu text and menu buttons
You can edit both the appearance and the text labels of menu text and of 
menu buttons.
To edit menu text (as opposed to the text label of a menu button), double-
click the text label. If the Inspector window is not open, a simple in-place for-
matting control appears adjacent to the label, as shown in Figure 15-10.
Figure 15-10: 
Double-
click a menu 
text label 
to edit and 
format it.
 
 
Open the Inspector window: You can choose View➪Show Inspector, or 
press Ô+I, or click the Inspector button at the lower left of the iDVD project 
window. The Inspector window provides more text formatting options, as 
shown in Figure 15-11.
Figure 15-11:

199
 Chapter 15: Assembling Your DVD
 
You can edit the text labels of menu buttons, but not by double-clicking the 
label. Instead, to select menu button label text for editing, you click the menu 
button once to select it, and then pause, and then click again on the text. 
Why? Because double-clicking a menu button does something else, depend-
ing on the type of menu button you double-click:
 
✓ Menu button linked to a submenu: A double-click displays the sub-
menu.
 
✓ Menu button linked to a movie: A double-click opens a preview of the 
movie in the iDVD preview player (we discuss previewing a DVD later in 
this chapter).
 
✓ Menu button linked to a slideshow: A double-click opens the slideshow 
editor, described earlier in this chapter.
In our very humble opinions (and we take pride in our humility), using the 
same mouse gesture to do four completely different things is very confusing. 
It’s even more confusing when the objects you double-click can, and often do, 
look exactly like each other on the screen. The double-click quadruple enten-
dre in iDVD brings new meaning to the phrase “counter-intuitive.”
When no Inspector window is open, a click-pause-click on a menu button dis-
plays the same kind of in-place formatting control for the menu button’s label 
that was shown previously in Figure 15-10. If an Inspector window is open 
(and remember, a simple Ô+I opens it), you see advanced formatting options 
in that window.
The formatting options you see in the Inspector window depend on the menu 
button’s style, which can be one of the following:
 
✓ Text menu button: When not selected, the button appears as text. This 
is the default style of most menu buttons in most theme families. The 
Inspector window for a text menu button is shown in Figure 15-12.
Figure 15-12:

a text menu 
button.

Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
✓ Image menu button: The menu button displays an image or a video loop 
inside a frame in addition to the menu button’s label. Figure 15-13 shows 
the Inspector window for an image menu button.

formatting 
options for

✓ Shape menu button: In most cases, a shape menu button looks just like 
a text menu button, but uses a shape to highlight the button when the 
user selects it with the DVD control, as shown in Figure 15-14. Some 
shape buttons also have a second shape that always appears with the 
menu button, whether highlighted or not. The Inspector window for a 
shape menu button looks like Figure 15-13, but without the Movie slider 
and Custom thumbnail well.
Figure 15-14: 
A shape

light shape

You set the menu button style with the pop-up menu above the Buttons pane, 
as shown in Figure 15-15. The first three items on the menu (yes, even the 
first item, Text) show you the available categories of highlight shapes for 
shape menu buttons. The other items provide categories of frames for image 
menu buttons.

201
 Chapter 15: Assembling Your DVD
Figure 15-15: 
Highlight 
and frame

buttons.
 
Here are the things you can control about a menu button’s appearance with 
the Inspector window:
 
✓ Font, size, style, text alignment, color, and shadow: The controls for 
adjusting these appear at the top of the Inspector window, regardless of 
the menu button style.
 
✓ Image displayed: You can drag any image, group of images, or movie to 
the Custom thumbnail well to apply a custom image to an image menu 
button. You use the Thumbnail slider to select which image the menu 
button displays. This gets tricky, however, because the media you drop 
in the well is added to any other available images for that menu button. 
For example, a menu button for a slideshow can show slides from the 
slideshow as well as the images you add to the well. Even more tricky, 
if you add a movie to the Custom thumbnail well for a slideshow menu 
button, the movie plays when you select it with the Thumbnail slider, 
which might give the audience the impression that the button links to a 
movie and not a slideshow.
 
 Our advice: Don’t add custom thumbnails to image menu buttons that 
link to slideshows or to movies because you’ll only get confused, and 
you may confuse your audience as well. You can remove the custom 
image or video by dragging it out of the well.
 
✓ Movie loop or still image: When an image menu button links to a movie, 
the menu button displays the linked movie in its frame. You can use the 
Movie slider in the Inspector to set where in the movie the loop for the 
movie begins. The length of the loop is the length of the menu’s motion 
loop, which we discuss in Chapter 14. To display a still image from the 
movie instead of a loop, select the Still Image check box, and then use 
the Movie slider to select the frame to display.
 
✓ Size of the image frame or highlight shape: The Size slider adjusts how 
big the frame is for an image menu button, or the size of the highlight 
(and decorative background graphic, if any) for a shape menu button.
 
✓ Label position: For shape or image menu buttons, you can use the Label 
menu to set where the highlight, background, or image frame appear 
relative to the menu button’s label text.

202
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
✓ Transition effect when the menu button is chosen: The two Transition 
menus set the video effect shown when the user chooses a menu 
button to go to another menu or to see a movie or slideshow. The top 
Transition menu provides a choice of transition effects, and the bottom 
menu provides the direction in which the transition effect plays (such as 
left or right) — that is, if a direction is applicable to the chosen transi-
tion effect. For example, a dissolve has no direction, but a wipe does.
 
 To remove the highlight shape or image frame from a menu button, choose 
the first item that appears in the Button pane (you can see in the margin 
what the item looks like). Choosing this item, in essence, applies the text 
menu button style to the menu button. To reset the menu button’s appear-
ance to the style specified by the theme, Control-click or right-click the menu 
button and choose Reset to Theme.
Previewing your DVD content
As we noted previously, double-clicking a menu button linked to a movie 
opens the iDVD preview player, which then proceeds to play the movie. 
That’s fine if you just want to preview a movie that’s part of your project, but 
it doesn’t give you the complete DVD-viewing experience, with its animated 
motion menus and the ability to navigate between menus.
Here’s how to preview your complete DVD project:
 
1. Navigate to the main menu in your project.
 
 This step is optional; the preview function begins at the current menu in 
the project window. Starting the preview at the main menu gives you a 
better feel for how the DVD presents itself.
 
2. Click the Preview button.
 
 This button lies in the toolbar below the menu editing pane, as shown in 
Figure 15-16. When you click it, the project window is replaced by the pre-
view player window and the DVD remote control, as shown in Figure 15-17.

3. Click the controls in the DVD remote control window (Figure 15-18) to 
navigate and to play the DVD:
 
• Menu: This ends playback of a movie or slideshow and returns to 
the menu from which it started.
 
• Title: This displays the DVD’s main menu.
 
• Exit: This ends the preview.
 
• Player controls: These provide the previous chapter, pause, play, 
and next chapter commands, respectively, for viewing movies and 
slideshows.
 
• Round directional control: The arrow buttons on the control 
move the highlight around the current menu. The Enter button in 
the center selects the currently highlighted menu button.
 
• Volume slider: You can probably guess what this does.
 
4. In the remote control, click Exit.
 
 This ends the preview and brings back the project window. You can also 
end the preview by clicking the close button at the top left of the pre-
view window.
Figure 15-18:

204
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
The iDVD volume control is relative to your Mac’s system-wide volume setting. 
In other words, if your Mac’s volume is set to 50 percent, an iDVD volume of 50 
percent gives you 25 percent of the possible Mac volume. So, if you have your 
Mac’s volume set low, no amount of fiddling with the iDVD volume slider is 
going to raise the volume very much.
Playing it safe
In addition to previewing the DVD, you also should check the TV Safe Area 
and, for widescreen DVDs, the Standard Crop Area.
The TV Safe Area shows you the parts of the screen that may not be visible 
on TVs that have picture tubes; picture tubes, if not precisely calibrated (and 
most are not), don’t display the complete video image from edge to edge. 
Most professional TV camera operators have the safe area marked on their 
camera viewfinders to help them frame shots that can be seen on all TVs, 
regardless of calibration. Choose View➪Show TV Safe Area or press Ô+T to 
see it.
The Standard Crop Area shows the part of a widescreen DVD that falls out-
side the boundaries of a standard aspect ratio TV screen. To see it, choose 
View➪Show Standard Crop Area, or press Option+Ô+T. Naturally, if your 
project uses a standard aspect ratio, the Show Standard Crop Area command 
is not available.
Both areas are shown in Figure 15-19; the TV Safe Area is the inner red rect-
angle. iDVD’s themes always try to position menu buttons and menu labels 
within the TV Safe Area. However, you can drag menu buttons around to 
override the theme’s menu button placement, so it helps to know if the menu 
buttons are visible where you put them.

Safe Area

205
 Chapter 15: Assembling Your DVD
 
To restore menu buttons to where the theme wants them, bring up the 
Inspector window for the menu (Ô+I) and click Snap to Grid in the Buttons 
area of the Inspector window.
Managing DVD Menus
You can build iDVD projects that have rather elaborate menu structures. For 
example, suppose you teach a media class, and you want to showcase five 
student videos, along with production slideshows for each video. You can 
easily add menus for each student’s video and other material with the Add 
Submenu command. This command is available on the project window’s Add 
button, as shown back in Figure 15-1. You can also issue the command by 
choosing Project➪Add Submenu (Shift+Ô+N).
When you create a new submenu, iDVD uses the theme family’s Extras theme, 
if there is one, and places a menu button on the current menu to link to it. 
The submenu starts out empty, but you can add movies, slideshows, and 
even other submenus to it.
Figure 15-20 shows a typical submenu, with a couple of menu buttons on it. 
Each submenu that you create automatically includes a menu button that 
links to the main menu; in Figure 15-20, it’s the brush-stroke styled left arrow 
near the bottom left.
Figure 15-20:

206
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
To help your audience get around a DVD menu structure that may go many 
levels deep, you can also add a Title menu button to any menu other than the 
first one. When your audience selects a title button, the DVD displays its title 
menu, which is, by convention, the very first menu. To create a title menu 
button, choose Project➪Add Title Menu Button.
 
 As you build your project, there’s also a tool to help you get around a DVD 
menu structure that may go many levels deep: the DVD Map, which you can 
access with the DVD Map button (shown in the margin) on the project win-
dow’s toolbar. Figure 15-21 shows the DVD Map for a project.
Figure 15-21: 
Your DVD 
treasure 
map.
 
Each square on the map represents a menu, a slideshow, or a movie. You can 
use the slider at the bottom of the map to zoom in or out of the map, and you 
can choose either a horizontal or vertical map layout with the control at the 
left of the toolbar. The Return button closes the DVD map and returns you to 
the last menu that was displayed in the project window.
You can double-click any item in the map with the following results:
 
✓ Menu: The DVD map is replaced by that menu in the project window.
 
✓ Slideshow: The slideshow editor for that slideshow opens. When you 
click Return in the editor, you return to the DVD map.
 
✓ Movie: The movie plays in the preview viewer. When you close the 
viewer, you return to the DVD map.

207
 Chapter 15: Assembling Your DVD
You can also move both menus and media around in the DVD map. Just drag 
an item, either media or a menu, on top of a menu in the map to move it to 
that menu. Figure 15-22 shows a slideshow being moved from a submenu to 
the main menu of a project.
Figure 15-22: 
Moving 
menus on 
the map.
 
 
One of the easiest things to do with a menu, movie, or slideshow is to delete 
it. You can select the menu button that leads to it and press Delete, or you 
can select it in the DVD map and press Delete. Either way, it disappears with 
a satisfying puff of smoke. Keep in mind, however, that any movies, slide-
shows, or submenus belonging to a menu that you delete are also deleted.
Adding DVD-ROM Content
One part of the DVD that your audience never sees on their TV sets is the 
optional DVD-ROM area of the DVD. You can put any files you like on your 
DVD, which turns it into a DVD-ROM. The DVD still plays in an ordinary DVD 
player, but the files you add become available when you insert the DVD into 
a computer’s optical disc reader.
In the section titled, “Adding a slideshow” earlier this chapter, we mentioned 
how you can include a slideshow’s original photos on a DVD: Through an 
iDVD preference setting. The way you add other files to the DVD-ROM is as 
follows:
 
1. Choose Advanced➪Edit DVD-ROM Contents.
 
 The window shown in Figure 15-23 appears.

208
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
Figure 15-23:

2. Drag files or folders from the Finder into the window.
 
 You can also click Add Files and choose files to add from a dialog.
You can delete files or folders from the DVD-ROM contents by selecting them 
in the DVD-ROM Contents window and pressing Delete. When you are done 
adding files to or removing files from the DVD-ROM, just close the DVD-ROM 
Contents window.

▶ Imaging the DVD
I
t’s been a long road, getting from there, when footage was sitting on your 
digital video camera, to here, when you’re ready to create a DVD to dis-
tribute your movie. But now, at last, your journey leaves the realm of pixels 
and packets and enters the realm of the real. Now is when you finally pro-
duce something that you can actually hold in the palm of your hand, a shiny 
rainbow-hued objet d’art.
In this chapter, we show you how to burn a DVD.
Burning a DVD Disc
Burning a DVD may be the simplest part of the 
whole movie-making process. It’s certainly the one 
that requires the least amount of creative thought 
and energy. However, because the process can 
consume hours, you do want to get it right the first 
time: After the DVD is burned, you can’t “fix it in 
post-production” like they do in Hollywood.
Preflighting your project
 
 Before you click the closed-shutter icon at the bottom of 
your project window to start burning your DVD, you should 
take heed of the carpenter’s idiom: “Measure twice, cut once.” Here’s 
a short checklist you can use to make sure your DVD project is ready to burn:

toc
k

210
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
 
✓ Check the DVD map: iDVD puts warnings on the menu thumbnails in 
your project’s DVD map (described in Chapter 15) when it detects that 
something is not quite right, such as a menu with no buttons, or a drop-
zone that contains no media. If you see warnings on the map, resolve 
them.
 
✓ Preview everything in your DVD project: We explained how to pre-
view your DVD in Chapter 15; now is the time to do it. Preview each of 
the movies and slideshows in your project to make sure that they play 
completely from beginning to the end. Click each of your menu buttons 
to make sure that they go to the right place. Adjust the volume of menu 
background audio (described in Chapter 14) to make sure that playback 
isn’t too loud in comparison to your movie’s audio. Double-check every-
thing before you turn the lasers loose on your recordable DVD.
 
✓ Check the power: If you are going to be burning the DVD on a MacBook, 
plug it in. You really don’t want to run out of battery power midway 
through the burning process, and the burning process can suck up bat-
tery power very quickly.
 
✓ Make sure you have enough disk space: The amount of space you need 
to have available on your disk drive should be double the amount the 
final DVD requires. You can find out how big your DVD will be by looking 
at the Project Info window, described in the next section. If your DVD 
project is stored on your system disk, you should also make sure that 
you have additional space available for Mac OS X to use — about ten 
percent of the total system disk size is a reasonable minimum.
 
✓ Have a spare recordable disc or two on hand: This is a just-in-case 
tip — occasionally recordable DVD media isn’t perfect (shocking, we 
know). If iDVD reports a disc recording error, you don’t want to have 
to drop everything and run out to buy a new blank disc.
 
✓ Make sure you have plenty of time: As we discuss in the later section, 
“Choosing the Encoder,” burning a DVD can take many hours. You don’t 
need to baby-sit your Mac while it works, but you shouldn’t plan to burn 
a DVD when you’ll be needing your Mac for other important tasks. When 
your Mac is burning a DVD, that is its most important task, and it can’t 
be interrupted as it works.
 
✓ Make sure your encoding settings are appropriate: We discuss that in 
more detail in the next section because it’s a crucial part of making a DVD.
Choosing the encoder
Encoding converts the media you have added to your project into the format 
that the DVD standard requires. The details of the standard are not impor-
tant (although we touched the tip of that iceberg back in Chapter 12). What is 
important is that the encoder setting you choose for your project determines 
how much material you can put on the DVD, how long it takes to burn the 
DVD, and how good the results look when you play the finished DVD.

211
 Chapter 16: Burning Your DVD
iDVD helps you out with the first part — how much material you can put on 
the DVD — when you open your project. If you have put more material into 
your project than can fit on a DVD using the current project settings, iDVD 
displays a dialog like the one shown in Figure 16-1.
Figure 16-1: 
This dialog 
appears if 
your media 
is bigger 
than your 
disc.
 
Figure 16-2 shows the Project Info window to which that dialog refers. To see 
the Project Info window, choose Project➪Project Info, or press Shift+Ô+I.
 
Red text indicates your movie is too large
 for the current encoding and/or DVD type.
Capacity meter
 
You can see how much disc space a project requires under the Capacity 
meter in the Project Info window. When the disc space amount appears in 
red, as it does in Figure 16-2, it means you have to choose a different encoder 
or set a different disc type. (The disc type is set with the DVD Type pop-up 
menu on the right side of the Project window: Macs with older optical drives 
can burn only single-layer discs, but newer Macs with SuperDrive optical 
drives can burn both single-layer and double-layer discs.)
Figure 16-2: 
Here’s 
where you 
set the 
encoder and 
DVD type for 
your DVD 
project.

212
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
You set the encoder with the Encoding pop-up menu at the left of the 
window. It offers the following three encoders:
 
✓ Best Performance: This is the default encoder. The name refers to how 
much processing time your Mac devotes to encoding, not to how well the 
video plays after it’s encoded. The Best Performance encoder is the only 
encoder that can do its work in the background while you work on your 
iDVD project (although you can turn background encoding off by choos-
ing Advanced➪Encode in Background). Best Performance encoding can 
fit about an hour’s worth of video on a single-layer DVD, and about two 
hours on a double-layer DVD. Although this encoder can fit less material 
on a DVD than the two other encoders can, the picture quality is always 
good, as you can see from the Quality meter shown in Figure 16-2.
 
✓ High Quality: This encoder uses more processing power, and spends 
more time encoding, than the Best Performance encoder. It does this in 
order to try to fit as much material as possible on the DVD. This encoder 
trades picture quality for disc space if necessary: it can fit about two 
hours of video on a single-layer DVD, and about four hours on a double-
layer DVD.
 
 Figure 16-3 shows a part of the Project Info window for a project that 
uses the High Quality setting to fit almost two hours of video on a single-
layer DVD: Note that the Quality meter indicates deep orange for the 
amount of material being encoded, indicating that the picture quality 
will be reduced. Projects that use the High Quality encoder can take 
several hours to encode and burn a DVD.
Figure 16-3: 
Stuffing 
too much 
material on 
a DVD can 
reduce pic-
ture quality.
 
The orange color indicates quality will be compromised.
 
✓ Professional Quality: This encoder uses even more processing 
power, and spends even more time encoding, than does the High 
Quality encoder. It can fit the same amount of material on a DVD as 
the High Quality encoder can, but it produces better looking results. 
The Professional Quality encoder can take twice as long to encode the 
same material as the High Quality encoder. If you’re going to burn a 
full double-layer DVD, bring a good book or two to read, or schedule a 
family outing, because your Mac is going to be spending half a day or 
more encoding your project.

 Chapter 16: Burning Your DVD
Feeling the burn
You’ve done the preflight check. You’ve set the encoder and disc type for the 
project. You’ve got the blank DVD media in hand.
Now here’s what you do:
 
 
1. Click the burn button at the bottom of the iDVD project window, or 
choose File➪Burn DVD (Ô+R).
 
 The burn button looks like a closed shutter until you click it, whereupon 
it becomes the familiar rotating radioactive burn symbol shown in the 
margin. iDVD prompts you to insert a recordable DVD disc.
 
2. Insert a blank DVD into your Mac’s optical drive.
 
 Your Mac spends a few moments detecting the disc, and then presents 
you with the dialog shown in Figure 16-4. This dialog keeps you posted 
on what iDVD is doing at each stage of the DVD creation process. The 
time estimate you see may be inaccurate at the beginning of the process, 
but in just a couple of minutes, the estimate stabilizes and tends to be 
reliable.
Figure 16-4: 
iDVD lets 
you know 
what’s 
going on.
 
 
 Keep in mind that if you use the Best Performance encoder and if iDVD 
has managed to encode all of the video in the background before you 
began burning your DVD, the Process Movies stage goes by very quickly. 
On the other hand, if you use either of the other two encoders, the 
Process Movies stage takes the bulk of the estimated time shown.
 
3. Take note of the time remaining and step away from the keyboard.
 
 Plan to return to your Mac when the DVD creation process finishes. 
When iDVD completes its work, it ejects the finished disc and then 
presents you with the dialog shown in Figure 16-5.

214
Part IV: Production and Distribution 
Figure 16-5: 
Let’s do it 
again!
 
 
4. Either insert another blank DVD and burn a second DVD, or click 
Done.
 
 Because iDVD encodes everything in your project when it performs a 
burn, burning a second copy immediately afterward takes much less 
time: In fact, iDVD only needs the time required to physically burn the 
DVD. So if you want a second copy of your masterpiece, now’s the best 
time to do it.
Congratulations: You have become a DVD mastering . . . well . . . master. Find 
yourself a DVD player, or stick your finished masterpiece back in your Mac 
(see Figure 16-6) and fire up the Mac’s DVD player. It’s movie time! Pass the 
popcorn.

Making and Burning a DVD Disc Image
If you don’t happen to have any blank discs on hand, or if you think you 
might want to burn additional copies of your DVD from time to time, you can 
make a disc image instead of burning your project directly to disc. Then after 
you have the disc image, you can use your Mac’s Disk Utility application to 
burn a new a disc every time you want another copy of your DVD.
 
iDVD can only create a single-layer DVD disc image reliably; double-layer disc 
images can be created with iDVD, but the discs made from these images may 
not work in many DVD players. If your project requires a dual-layer DVD, you 
should burn it directly from iDVD.

215
 Chapter 16: Burning Your DVD
The process of making a DVD image is almost identical to the process of 
burning a disc. Just choose File➪Save as Disc Image, and specify a file loca-
tion in the dialog that appears. iDVD then goes through the same creation 
steps it does when you actually burn a DVD and then stores the image where 
you requested.
After you have created a disc image, you burn DVDs from it with Disk Utility, 
which is located in /Applications/Utilities/. Here’s how to burn a DVD with 
Disk Utility:
 
1. Open Disk Utility.
 
 The Disk utility window is shown in Figure 16-7.
Figure 16-7:

assuming 
Disk Utility 
application 
window.
 
 
2. On the Disk Utility toolbar, click Burn.
 
 Disk Utility presents you with a standard file dialog.
 
3. Navigate to the location of the disc image file, select the file, and then 
click Burn.
 
 Disk Utility presents a dialog asking you to insert a disc. If you like, you 
can click the arrow button in the upper right of the dialog to see detailed 
burning options, as shown in Figure 16-8.

Figure 16-8: 
Disk Utility 
has some 
burning 
options.
 
 
4. Insert a disc, wait until Disk Utility recognizes the disc, and then 
click Burn.
 
 Disk Utility shows you a progress dialog as it burns the disc.
 
5. When the burn is complete, choose Disk Utility➪Quit.
That’s all, folks! Roll the credits.

Ten Useful Hardware and 
Software Add-ons
In This Chapter
▶ EyeTV
▶ Toast Titanium
▶ iDVD ThemePAKS
▶ An external tray-loading DVD burner
John Donne wrote, “No man is an island, entire unto himself.” iMovie and 
iDVD aren’t men, but neither are they islands. Like any of us, they can 
sometimes use a helping hand. We aren’t going to belabor the obvi-
ous pieces of hardware that help you with your work, such as 
a good digital camcorder, a tripod, a microphone for your 
camera, or a DVD burner — that would be tantamount to 
cheating. In this chapter, we focus on ten items that we 
think are great companions for iMovie and iDVD.
EyeTV
Elgato (www.elgato.com) makes and supports 
the award-winning EyeTV hardware and software. 
Most famous as a way to view and record TV on 
your Mac, EyeTV also gives you a way to get old, 
non-digital video and audio onto your Mac from a Beta 
or VHS player, old-fashioned analog camcorder, or a cas-
sette tape deck or turntable, as long as it has composite 
plug capability (composite plugs are those red and white RCA 
plugs for stereo, with a yellow plug for video). EyeTV offers numerous 
models, from the EyeTV Hybrid, which uses your Mac’s processor to encode

the video, to the EyeTV 250 Plus, which encodes the video before sending it 
on to your Mac’s hard disk.
Elgato makes moving your content from VHS tape easy by providing the VHS 
Assistant. Just choose Help➪EyeTV VHS Assistant or, if you want the video 
encoded for the iPod or iPhone, choose Help➪EyeTV iPod Assistant. In either 
case, just follow the onscreen instructions as EyeTV walks you through the 
process. When done, the EyeTV software exports your recording to iTunes. 
You can retrieve it from there by choosing File➪Import➪Movies and navigat-
ing to your ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Movies folder, where you find the 
.m4v file(s) you’ve created. Select your recording and click Import. iMovie 
creates a new Event consisting of your recording.
 
Alternatively, you can manually manage the AV import process in EyeTV 
without using either Assistant.
Whether you record manually or use an assistant, your recordings are also 
in the EyeTV software’s Library under Recordings. You can export manually, 
directly to iMovie, by selecting the recording and choosing File➪Export and 
choosing for iMovie ‘09 from the Format pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 17-1.
 
If you want a device specifically attuned to working with your camcorder and 
creating video for your iPod, iPhone, or AppleTV, the Turbo.264 HD ($149.95 
list price) might be just the ticket. It’s small, fast, and easy to use.

to iMovie.

 Chapter 17: Ten Useful Hardware and Software Add-Ons
MPEG Streamclip
We don’t know about you, but sometimes we receive video files from friends 
or family that aren’t in a form that iMovie accepts. However, if the movie 
can be opened in QuickTime (even with the use of a codec such as DivX or 
Perian), MPEG Streamclip (www.squared5.com) can let you export to a wide 
variety of formats, many of which are iMovie-compatible. Check out Figure 17-2 
to see some of the formats to which MPEG Streamclip can export. Best of all, 
it’s free.

to iMovie-
compatible 
formats.
 
Toast Titanium
iDVD is great for authoring beautiful DVDs, but whether you burn your movie 
in iDVD or use Disk Utility to burn a saved image file, you have to go through 
a whole sequence of steps for each copy you want to burn. When we create 
a family movie that needs to go out to a variety of friends and relatives (for 
example, a holiday DVD that augments or replaces the traditional year-end 
holiday letter), we need lots of copies. Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com) 
fills the bill. Just load the image file and let Toast know how many copies you 
want to burn. Then, all you have to do is sit there and replace finished burns 
with blank discs until the job is done.

222
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
If that were the only thing we used Toast for, it probably wouldn’t be worth the 
price tag. But Toast is excellent for creating quick DVD, SuperVideoCDs, and 
VideoCDs, as well as DivX discs that play in many modern DVD players — not 
to mention data discs in a variety of formats and audio discs.
Although the menus aren’t as fancy as those in iDVD, you have more control 
over the encoding process with Toast, so if you really want to fit more than 
two hours of DVD video on a single-layer DVD-R, Toast is your way to accom-
plish the goal. You can also create a dual-layer image file in iDVD and then 
have Toast compress it to fit on a single-layer disc. Your movie will deterio-
rate slightly in quality, but it probably won’t be noticeable except in high-
speed action scenes, and you’ll still have the menus that you so painstakingly 
created in iDVD. Toast 10 Titanium’s Video pane is shown in Figure 17-3.
Figure 17-3: 
Toast burns 
lots of 
video disc 
formats.
 
Figure 17-3 also displays the tooltip for one of our favorite features. We burn 
a lot of DVDs for family that have only one or two short movies on them. 
You know the type: little Marcus’s birthday party or Taylor’s graduation or a 
vacation slideshow. Of course, we have to get copies of these out to all inter-
ested family members as soon as possible. When all is said and done, we end 
up with 10 or 12 DVDs a year, the combined content of which wouldn’t even 
fill one DVD. Rather than having to build an all-new DVD in iDVD, redoing the 

223
 Chapter 17: Ten Useful Hardware and Software Add-Ons
menus, and reimporting and reencoding the video, Toast lets us select copies 
of the VIDEO_TS folders (see Chapter 18) from all the DVDs. It then compiles 
them for us into an all-new, all-encompassing VIDEO_TS folder and burns it 
to DVD. If you used Magic DVD or One-Step DVD a few times, this feature lets 
you combine those into one DVD as well. Cool!
And if all that isn’t enough to whet your appetite, you also get the capability 
of writing Blu-ray discs (with a suitable Blu-ray burner), giving you a way to 
use your HD camera content in a high-def setting (iDVD doesn’t do HD).
An External Hard Drive
The glamorous people say that you can’t be too rich or too thin (though we 
might argue the latter). At least as true is this: You can never have too much 
disk space. Digital video consumes hard disk space the way kids consume 
Halloween candy. iMovie and iDVD both like a lot of available disk space with 
which to work, and OS X runs a lot faster when there’s a lot of free space for 
swap files. Get a large fast hard drive and dedicate it to your video, leaving 
your startup drive’s space to OS X: You’ll be glad you did. You can find excel-
lent name-brand drives with 1TB (terabyte) or more space for under $300 
these days, and the prices keep falling as the capacities increase. (You’ve 
gotta love electronics . . . it’s one of the very few product lines where you 
keep getting more and more for the same or less money each year.)
iDVD ThemePAKs
Apple supplies a plethora of menu themes for iDVD, but we often don’t 
find one that meets our needs and we end up having to customize it. iDVD 
ThemePAKs (www.idvdthemepak.com) offer dozens of iDVD themes that 
you can plug in and use. Although most are nominally priced and bundle 
deals are available, you can even download a free package of seven themes.
A bundle of 42 custom menu buttons for use with iDVD is also available for $74.
iMovieLocationEditor
New Zealand’s Craig Stanton (craig.stanton.net.nz/code/imovie
locationeditor) provides a free utility that lets you easily add locations 
to the 1,600 Apple put on iMovie’s globe. Locations are covered in Chapter 8.

224
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can type the new locations in by hand or (our preference) copy them 
from Google Earth.
Direct CD/DVD Printer
When you author a DVD to share with friends and family, go the extra mile 
and design the stylish label your opus deserves, or just do it for yourself. 
Many printers, including models from Epson and HP, can print directly to 
printable CDs and DVDs. Printable discs cost only a penny or two more than 
regular optical discs if you shop around a bit. That’s less than the per-label 
cost of a pack of press-on disc labels and you don’t have to worry about 
applying the label “just right.”
 
Alternatively, you could invest in a LightScribe external DVD burner. Although 
this saves considerably on the most expensive aspect of printing — ink — 
the incremental blank disc cost makes it pretty much a wash, and LightScribe 
doesn’t give you the colorful label that printing affords. That said, Dennis 
has a LightScribe-compatible burner (a LaCie), but has only burned a handful 
of LightScribe discs versus thousands of printable DVDs and CDs. If you’re 
going to purchase an external burner, you might make the investment in a 
LightScribe-compatible one, just in case.
An External Tray-Loading DVD Burner
If you’re going to burn a lot of DVDs or if you have a USB camcorder that 
writes to a miniDVD, you really want a tray-loading drive, and the only cur-
rent Mac model that sports one internally is the Mac Pro. You can’t load a 
miniDVD in a slot-loading drive, so your only access to what you’ve recorded 
is through iMovie’s import functionality. A slot-loading drive, the ones used 
in every Mac except the MacPro, slurps the disc in, a tray loader extends a 
tray onto which you place your disc and then press the close button (either 
in software or on the drive case) to retract the tray. In addition to this 
increased capability, tray-loading drives are faster and, in our experience, 
last longer than slot-loaders. Further, when they do die, they’re a lot easier 
and less expensive to replace.
A USB Microphone
This recommendation isn’t for your camcorder; it’s for your Mac. You can 
use the built-in microphone or iSight camera for your narrations, and they’re 
adequate. But, is “adequate” what you want for your movie? A quality USB-
based microphone makes recording your narration much easier because 

225
 Chapter 17: Ten Useful Hardware and Software Add-Ons
you don’t have to position yourself “just so” in order to obtain a consistent 
recording. Additionally, it’s useful if you choose to add a voice track to a 
GarageBand score for your movie.
An iPod or an iPhone
These portable players are awesome for carrying your video library around 
and showing it off. Although the screens are small, the video is clear and 
crisp. Plus, with the appropriate cable, you can connect your iPod to a TV set 
or home entertainment center and share your video artistry without having 
to deal with a stack of clumsy DVDs.

Ten Tips and 
Troubleshooting Hints
In This Chapter

▶ Making a Video_TS folder
▶ Fine-tuning your clips
▶ Naming a DVD
▶ Choosing your favorite iMovie fonts
W
e spend the bulk of this book taking you through the basic tools and 
techniques for making movies and putting them on DVDs. In 
this chapter, we give you ten tips and troubleshooting tricks 
that can give your creative endeavors an extra power-assist.
Moving an iDVD Project
If you ever need to move an iDVD project to a 
different computer or make a complete backup 
of it, you can pack up all the bits and pieces by 
choosing File➪Archive Project and choosing a 
place to save your project. The Archive Project 
dialog shows you how big the archive will be and 
allows you to include both customized themes and 
any encoded video. Your archive contains all the 
movies, audio, photos, themes, and all of the files you’ve 
included in the DVD-ROM contents. The only thing that 
won’t be in the archive are any special fonts you may have used in 
your menus.

You can then copy the archived project to another computer and open 
it there with iDVD’s File➪Open command, just as you would any other 
iDVD project.
Changing Default Clip Click Behavior
By default, when you click a clip in iMovie’s Events library, iMovie selects 
a four-second-long chunk of the clip. You can adjust the size of the chunk 
you select when you click, or even change what a click means. Choose 
iMovie➪Preferences and then click Browser. In the Browser preferences, you 
can use the slider at the bottom to adjust how much a click selects, or you 
can choose to make a click select the entire clip — or, instead, have a click 
deselect everything.
Previewing Your Video with a Video_TS Folder
In Chapter 16, we cover how to make a DVD disc image. However, you don’t 
need a disc image to make a version of your DVD’s contents that you can play 
with your Mac’s DVD Player application or other applications that can play 
DVDs. Instead, you can save a VIDEO_TS folder, using File➪Save as VIDEO_TS 
folder. (A VIDEO_TS is the folder on the DVD that contains all the goodies 
that a DVD player plays.)
Although a VIDEO_TS folder takes almost as much time to make as an actual 
DVD, it does have certain advantages. Here’s one of the most important: 
It’s an excellent way to check the video quality produced by the encoding 
settings you’ve chosen for your DVD without using up a blank disc. Although 
you can’t make a DVD from a VIDEO_TS folder with iDVD, you can with other 
products, such as Toast (see Chapter 17). 
Here’s how you can view the VIDEO_TS folder with your Mac’s DVD Player 
application: just drag and drop the folder on your Mac’s DVD Player applica-
tion, or choose File➪Open DVD Media in the DVD Player application and 
select the VIDEO_TS folder you saved. It will play just like any other DVD on 
your Mac.
Putting a Happy Face on Your Titles
When you edit a title in your iMovie project, clicking the Show Fonts button 
in the Viewer brings up a Choose Font dialog that offers nine fonts and 

229
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips and Troubleshooting Hints
colors from which you can choose. Although you can choose other fonts via 
the System Font Panel button in the dialog, that can be a drag if there’s a 
particular font or two that you always want available.
You can specify the fonts, and the available colors, that appear in the Choose 
Fonts dialog by choosing iMovie➪Preferences and then clicking Fonts. Click 
the double-arrows to the right of a font name to choose a different font to 
appear in the Choose Font dialog (see Figure 18-1). Click a color swatch to 
see the Color Picker, from which you can select a color to replace the color in 
the swatch.
Figure 18-1: 
Pick a font, 
any font.
 
Keeping Names Consistent
iDVD uses the name you gave your DVD to name the DVD it creates. And, as 
we mention in Chapter 16, you can change that name in the Project Info 
window. However, the disc name may not exactly match the project name, 
and it may not match the name that you enter in the Project Info window. 
That’s because the DVD standard has specific rules for DVD names.
A DVD can’t have names longer than 27 characters, and the name can only 
include upper-case letters from A to Z, underscores, and the numerals from 0 
through 9. When iDVD burns the DVD, it ignores other characters, converts 
any lower-case letters to upper-case, and replaces spaces with underscores. 
If you’ve included some of the forbidden characters in your project name, 
your iDVD project name and DVD name won’t match. But if you take care to 
follow these rules when you name your iDVD project, the DVD name always 
matches your iDVD project name.

230
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Moving Your iDVD Themes
Running short of hard disk space? The themes installed with iDVD are not 
tiny, but they don’t have to take up hard disk space if you have another disk 
available when you work with iDVD. You can move the iDVD themes to a 
location of your choosing and then let iDVD know where to find them. Also, 
if you purchase a themes package from a third party, such as one from 
iDVDThemePAK (see Chapter 17), you can tell iDVD where to find it, as well.
You can find Apple’s iDVD themes in /Library/Application Support/iDVD/
Themes. Just move that folder to the location of your choosing. Then, 
in iDVD, choose iDVD➪Preferences and click Advanced. The Advanced 
preferences contains a list of locations where iDVD looks to find themes. 
Click the Add button, locate the folder where you stashed your iDVD themes, 
and then click Open. iDVD adds the location of the folder to Look For My 
Themes in These Folders list. You can add the locations of third-party theme 
packages this way as well. Don’t worry if you move the themes and forget to 
specify a folder location: The next time you open iDVD, it asks you to tell it 
where to find them.
You can use this technique to bring your themes with you if you create iDVD 
projects on more than one machine: Just put your themes on a portable 
hard disk or a network server, and then add that location to the Look for My 
Themes in These Folders list to the copy of iDVD that you’re currently using. 
Trimming a Clip Quickly
iMovie’s Precision Editor is dandy for detailed clip manipulation, but you 
don’t have to use it to fine-tune the length of a clip in your project. Press 
Option+Ô when your pointer is over either end of a clip in your project 
and drag the orange fine-tuning control that appears to the left or right. The 
clip length is adjusted by single frames as you drag the control, and the 
number of frames added or removed from the clip is shown beside the 
control (see Figure 18-2).
 
Here’s an even better idea: Put your pointer over either end of a clip and 
hold down Option as you press the left arrow or right arrow keys to adjust 
the clip’s length a frame at a time.

 Chapter 18: Ten Tips and Troubleshooting Hints
Doing a Slow (DVD) Burn
In a world of instant communications, microwave ovens, and other time-
savings wonders, it may seem strange to want to make something go slower. 
However, sometimes a DVD burner has trouble with certain blank discs and 
fails to burn them properly at the fastest speed, but it may work perfectly if 
the burn speed is slower.
Although you can set the disc-burning speed whenever you start to burn a 
DVD, you may find doing this inconvenient if you have a 50-pack of marginal 
blank discs that require you to fiddle with the burning speed each and every 
time. In this case, you can set iDVD’s default burn speed to the one that 
works best for you: Choose iDVD➪Preferences, click Advanced, and then 
choose a speed from the Preferred DVD Burning Speed menu that appears.
Plucking Apples Off of Your Menus
Many of the themes that come with iDVD have an unobtrusive Apple logo on 
them. If you don’t want to advertise your corporate allegiance with every 
DVD you make, you can hide this logo. Choose iDVD➪Preferences, click 
General, and deselect the Show Apple Logo Watermark check box.
Pasting with Power
As we cover in Chapter 6, you can adjust the colors of any clip with the Video 
Inspector, and you can add video effects to a clip with the Clip Inspector. But 
what if you want to use the same adjustments and effects on several different 
clips in your movie?
It’s a piece of cake, with rich, creamy frosting: Select the clip you’ve adjusted, 
and choose Edit➪Copy. Next, select a different clip and choose Edit➪Paste 
Adjustments, and then select an item from the submenu, such as Video or 
Video Effect.
 
You can also paste speed changes, audio adjustments, stabilization, and 
several other items from this power submenu. If you’re a power user, take 
heart: There are keyboard equivalents for all the adjustments you can paste. 
(For example, Option+Ô+I pastes video adjustments and Option+Ô+L pastes 
video effects.)
