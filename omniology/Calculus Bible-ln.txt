Chapter 1
Functions
In this chapter we review the basic concepts of functions, polynomial func-
tions, rational functions, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, ex-
ponential functions, hyperbolic functions, algebra of functions, composition
of functions and inverses of functions.
1.1
The Concept of a Function
Basically, a function f relates each element x of a set, say Df, with exactly
one element y of another set, say Rf. We say that Df is the domain of f and
Rf is the range of f and express the relationship by the equation y = f(x).
It is customary to say that the symbol x is an independent variable and the
symbol y is the dependent variable.
Example 1.1.1 Let Df = {a, b, c}, Rf = {1, 2, 3} and f(a) = 1, f(b) = 2
and f(c) = 3. Sketch the graph of f.
graph
Example 1.1.2 Sketch the graph of f(x) = |x|.
Let Df be the set of all real numbers and Rf be the set of all non-negative
real numbers. For each x in Df, let y = |x| in Rf. In this case, f(x) = |x|,

the absolute value of x. Recall that
|x| =

x
if x ≥0
−x
if x < 0
We note that f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1 and f(−1) = 1.
If the domain Df and the range Rf of a function f are both subsets
of the set of all real numbers, then the graph of f is the set of all ordered
pairs (x, f(x)) such that x is in Df. This graph may be sketched in the xy-
coordinate plane, using y = f(x). The graph of the absolute value function
in Example 2 is sketched as follows:
graph
Example 1.1.3 Sketch the graph of
f(x) =
√
x −4.
In order that the range of f contain real numbers only, we must impose
the restriction that x ≥4. Thus, the domain Df contains the set of all real
numbers x such that x ≥4. The range Rf will consist of all real numbers y
such that y ≥0. The graph of f is sketched below.

Example 1.1.4 A useful function in engineering is the unit step function,
u, deﬁned as follows:
u(x) =

if x ≥0
The graph of u(x) has an upward jump at x = 0. Its graph is given below.

graph
Example 1.1.5 Sketch the graph of
f(x) =
x
x2 −4.
It is clear that Df consists of all real numbers x ̸= ±2. The graph of f is
given below.
graph
We observe several things about the graph of this function. First of all,
the graph has three distinct pieces, separated by the dotted vertical lines
x = −2 and x = 2. These vertical lines, x = ±2, are called the vertical
asymptotes. Secondly, for large positive and negative values of x, f(x) tends
to zero. For this reason, the x-axis, with equation y = 0, is called a horizontal
asymptote.
Let f be a function whose domain Df and range Rf are sets of real
numbers. Then f is said to be even if f(x) = f(−x) for all x in Df. And
f is said to be odd if f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in Df. Also, f is said to be
one-to-one if f(x1) = f(x2) implies that x1 = x2.
Example 1.1.6 Sketch the graph of f(x) = x4 −x2.
This function f is even because for all x we have
f(−x) = (−x)4 −(−x)2 = x4 −x2 = f(x).
The graph of f is symmetric to the y-axis because (x, f(x)) and (−x, f(x)) are
on the graph for every x. The graph of an even function is always symmetric
to the y-axis. The graph of f is given below.
graph

1.1. THE CONCEPT OF A FUNCTION

This function f is not one-to-one because f(−1) = f(1).
Example 1.1.7 Sketch the graph of g(x) = x3 −3x.
The function g is an odd function because for each x,
g(−x) = (−x)3 −3(−x) = −x3 + 3x = −(x3 −3x) = −g(x).
The graph of this function g is symmetric to the origin because (x, g(x))
and (−x, −g(x)) are on the graph for all x. The graph of an odd function is
always symmetric to the origin. The graph of g is given below.
graph
This function g is not one-to-one because g(0) = g(
√
3) = g(−
√
3).
It can be shown that every function f can be written as the sum of an
even function and an odd function. Let
g(x) = 1
2(f(x) + f(−x)), h(x) = 1
2(f(x) −f(−x)).
Then,
g(−x) = 1
2(f(−x) + f(x)) = g(x)
h(−x) = 1
2(f(−x) −f(x)) = −h(x).
Furthermore
f(x) = g(x) + h(x).
Example 1.1.8 Express f as the sum of an even function and an odd func-
tion, where,
f(x) = x4 −2x3 + x2 −5x + 7.
We deﬁne
g(x) = 1
2(f(x) + f(−x))
= 1
2{(x4 −2x3 + x2 −5x + 7) + (x4 + 2x3 + x2 + 5x + 7)}

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
and
h(x) = 1
2(f(x) −f(−x))
= 1
2{(x4 −2x3 + x2 −5x + 7) −(x4 + 2x3 + x2 + 5x + 7)}
= −2x3 −5x.
Then clearly g(x) is even and h(x) is odd.
g(−x) = (−x)4 + (−x)2 + 7
= x4 + x2 + 7
= g(x)
h(−x) = −2(−x)3 −5(−x)
= 2x3 + 5x
= −h(x).
We note that
g(x) + h(x) = (x4 + x2 + 7) + (−2x3 −5x)
= x4 −2x3 + x2 −5x + 7
= f(x).
It is not always easy to tell whether a function is one-to-one. The graph-
ical test is that if no horizontal line crosses the graph of f more than once,
then f is one-to-one. To show that f is one-to-one mathematically, we need
to show that f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2.
Example 1.1.9 Show that f(x) = x3 is a one-to-one function.
Suppose that f(x1) = f(x2). Then

This is only possible if x1 is not a real number. This contradiction proves
that f(x1) ̸= f(x2) if x1 ̸= x2 and, hence, f is one-to-one. The graph of f is
given below.
graph
If a function f with domain Df and range Rf is one-to-one, then f has a
unique inverse function g with domain Rf and range Df such that for each
x in Df,
g(f(x)) = x
and for such y in Rf,
f(g(y)) = y.
This function g is also written as f −1. It is not always easy to express g
explicitly but the following algorithm helps in computing g.
Step 1 Solve the equation y = f(x) for x in terms of y and make sure that there
exists exactly one solution for x.
Step 2 Write x = g(y), where g(y) is the unique solution obtained in Step 1.
Step 3 If it is desirable to have x represent the independent variable and y
represent the dependent variable, then exchange x and y in Step 2 and
write
y = g(x).
Remark 1 If y = f(x) and y = g(x) = f −1(x) are graphed on the same
coordinate axes, then the graph of y = g(x) is a mirror image of the graph
of y = f(x) through the line y = x.
Example 1.1.10 Determine the inverse of f(x) = x3.
We already know from Example 9 that f is one-to-one and, hence, it has
a unique inverse. We use the above algorithm to compute g = f −1.
Step 1 We solve y = x3 for x and get x = y1/3, which is the unique solution.

CHAPTER 1. FUNCTIONS
Step 2 Then g(y) = y1/3 and g(x) = x1/3 = f −1(x).
Step 3 We plot y = x3 and y = x1/3 on the same coordinate axis and compare
their graphs.

A polynomial function p of degree n has the general form
p(x) = a0xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an−1x + an, a2 ̸= 0.
The polynomial functions are some of the simplest functions to compute.
For this reason, in calculus we approximate other functions with polynomial
functions.
A rational function r has the form
r(x) = p(x)
q(x)
where p(x) and q(x) are polynomial functions. We will assume that p(x) and
q(x) have no common non-constant factors. Then the domain of r(x) is the
set of all real numbers x such that q(x) ̸= 0.

If {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn+1, yn+1)} is a list of discrete data points in
the plane, then there exists a unique nth degree polynomial that goes
through all of them. Joseph Lagrange found a simple way to express this
polynomial, called the Lagrange polynomial.

Consider the points A(0, 0), B(x, 0), C(x, y) where C(x, y) is a point on
the unit circle. Let θ, read theta, represent the length of the arc joining
the points D(1, 0) and C(x, y). This length is the radian measure of the
angle CAB. Then we deﬁne the following six trigonometric functions of θ as

A function f is said to have period p if p is the smallest positive number
such that, for all x,
f(x + np) = f(x), n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .
Since csc θ is the reciprocal of sin θ and sec θ is the reciprocal of cos(θ), their
periods are also 2π. That is,
csc(θ + 2nπ) = csc(θ) and sec(θ + 2nπ) = sec θ, n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .
It turns out that tan θ and cot θ have period π. That is,
tan(θ + nπ) = tan θ and cot(θ + nπ) = cot θ, n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . .
Geometrically, it is easy to see that cos θ and sec θ are the only even trigono-
metric functions. The functions sin θ, cos θ, tan θ and cot θ are all odd func-
tions. The functions sin θ and cos θ are deﬁned for all real numbers. The

In applications of calculus to engineering problems, the graphs of y =
A sin(bx + c) and y = A cos(bx + c) play a signiﬁcant role. The ﬁrst problem
has to do with converting expressions of the form A sin bx + B cos bx to one
of the above forms. Let us begin ﬁrst with an example.
Example 1.2.1 Express y = 3 sin(2x)−4 cos(2x) in the form y = A sin(2x±
θ) or y = A cos(2x ± θ).
First of all, we make a right triangle with sides of length 3 and 4 and
compute the length of the hypotenuse, which is 5. We label one of the acute
angles as θ and compute sin θ, cos θ and tan θ. In our case,
sin θ = 3

cos θ = 4

y = −5 cos(2x + θ).
We can compute the radian measure of θ from any of the equations
sin θ = 3

Example 1.2.2 Sketch the graph of y = 5 cos(2x + 1).
In order to sketch the graph, we ﬁrst compute all of the zeros, relative
maxima, and relative minima. We can see that the maximum values will be
5 and minimum values are −5. For this reason the number 5 is called the
amplitude of the graph. We know that the cosine function has zeros at odd
integer multiples of π/2. Let
2xn + 1 = (2n + 1)π
2 , xn = (2n + 1)π
4 −1
2, n = 0, ±1, ±2 . . . .
The max and min values of a cosine function occur halfway between the
consecutive zeros. With this information, we are able to sketch the graph of
the given function. The period is π, phase shift is 1
2 and frequency is 1
π.

Logarithmic, Exponential and Hyperbolic
Functions
Most logarithmic tables have tables for log10 x, loge x, ex and e−x because
of their universal applications to scientiﬁc problems. The key relationship
between logarithmic functions and exponential functions, using the same
base, is that each one is an inverse of the other. For example, for base 10,
we have
N = 10x if and only if x = log10 N.
We get two very interesting relations, namely
x = log10(10x) and N = 10(log10 N).

1.4. LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS27
For base e, we get
x = loge(ex) and y = e(loge y).
If b > 0 and b ̸= 1, then b is an admissible base for a logarithm. For such an
admissible base b, we get
x = logb(bx) and y = b(logb y).
The Logarithmic function with base b, b > 0, b ̸= 1, satisﬁes the following
important properties:
1.
logb(b) = 1, logb(1) = 0, and logb(bx) = x for all real x.
2.
logb(xy) = logb x + logb y, x > 0, y > 0.
3.
logb(x/y) = logb x −logb y, x > 0, y > 0.
4.
logb(xy) = y logb x, x > 0, x ̸= 1, for all real y.
5.
(logb x)(loga b) = loga xb > 0, a > 0, b ̸= 1, a ̸= 1. Note that logb x =
loga x
loga b .
This last equation (5) allows us to compute logarithms with respect to
any base b in terms of logarithms in a given base a.
The corresponding laws of exponents with respect to an admissible base
b, b > 0, b ̸= 1 are as follows:
1.
b0 = 1, b1 = b, and b(logb x) = x for x > 0.
2.
bx × by = bx+y
3.
bx
by = bx−y
4.
(bx)y = b(xy)
Notation: If b = e, then we will express
logb(x) as ln(x) or log(x).
The notation exp(x) = ex can be used when confusion may arise.
The graph of y = log x and y = ex are reﬂections of each other through
the line y = x.

Limits and Continuity
2.1
Intuitive treatment and deﬁnitions
2.1.1
Introductory Examples
The concepts of limit and continuity are very closely related. An intuitive
understanding of these concepts can be obtained through the following ex-
amples.
Example 2.1.1 Consider the function f(x) = x2 as x tends to 2.
As x tends to 2 from the right or from the left, f(x) tends to 4. The
value of f at 2 is 4. The graph of f is in one piece and there are no holes or
jumps in the graph. We say that f is continuous at 2 because f(x) tends to
f(2) as x tends to 2.
graph
The statement that f(x) tends to 4 as x tends to 2 from the right is
expressed in symbols as
lim
x→2+ f(x) = 4
and is read, “the limit of f(x), as x goes to 2 from the right, equals 4.”
35

36
CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
The statement that f(x) tends to 4 as x tends to 2 from the left is written
lim
x→2−f(x) = 4
and is read, “the limit of f(x), as x goes to 2 from the left, equals 4.”
The statement that f(x) tends to 4 as x tends to 2 either from the right
or from the left, is written
lim
x→2 f(x) = 4
and is read, “the limit of f(x), as x goes to 2, equals 4.”
The statement that f(x) is continuous at x = 2 is expressed by the
equation
lim
x→2 f(x) = f(2).
Example 2.1.2 Consider the unit step function as x tends to 0.
u(x) =
 0
if x < 0
1
if x ≥0.
graph
The function, u(x) tends to 1 as x tends to 0 from the right side. So, we
write
lim
x→0+ u(x) = 1 = u(0).
The limit of u(x) as x tends to 0 from the left equals 0. Hence,
lim
x→0−u(x) = 0 ̸= u(0).
Since
lim
x→0+ u(x) = u(0),
we say that u(x) is continuous at 0 from the right. Since
lim
x→0−u(x) ̸= u(0),

2.1. INTUITIVE TREATMENT AND DEFINITIONS
37
we say that u(x) is not continuous at 0 from the left. In this case the jump
at 0 is 1 and is deﬁned by
jump (u(x), 0) = lim
x→0+ u(x) −lim
x→0−u(x)
= 1.
Observe that the graph of u(x) has two pieces that are not joined together.
Every horizontal line with equation y = c, 0 < c < 1, separates the two
pieces of the graph without intersecting the graph of u(x).
This kind of
jump discontinuity at a point is called “ﬁnite jump” discontinuity.
Example 2.1.3 Consider the signum function, sign(x), deﬁned by
sign (x) = x
|x| =
(
1
if x > 0
−1
if x < 0 .
If x > 0, then sign(x) = 1. If x < 0, then sign(x) = −1. In this case,
lim
x→0+ sign(x) = 1
lim
x→0−sign(x) = −1
jump (sign(x), 0) = 2.
Since sign(x) is not deﬁned at x = 0, it is not continuous at 0.
Example 2.1.4 Consider f(θ) = sin θ
θ
as θ tends to 0.
graph
The point C(cos θ, sin θ) on the unit circle deﬁnes sin θ as the vertical
length BC. The radian measure of the angle θ is the arc length DC. It is

38
CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
clear that the vertical length BC and arc length DC get closer to each other
as θ tends to 0 from above. Thus,
graph
lim
θ→0+
sin θ
θ
= 1.
For negative θ, sin θ and θ are both negative.
lim
θ→0+
sin(−θ)
−θ
= lim
θ→0+
−sin θ
−θ
= 1.
Hence,
lim
θ→0
sin θ
θ
= 1.
This limit can be veriﬁed by numerical computation for small θ.
Example 2.1.5 Consider f(x) = 1
x as x tends to 0 and as x tends to ±∞.
graph
It is intuitively clear that
lim
x→0+
1
x = +∞
lim
x→+∞
1
x = 0
lim
x→0−
1
x = −∞
lim
x→−∞
1
x = 0.

2.1. INTUITIVE TREATMENT AND DEFINITIONS
39
The function f is not continuous at x = 0 because it is not deﬁned for x = 0.
This discontinuity is not removable because the limits from the left and from
the right, at x = 0, are not equal. The horizontal and vertical axes divide
the graph of f in two separate pieces. The vertical axis is called the vertical
asymptote of the graph of f. The horizontal axis is called the horizontal
asymptote of the graph of f. We say that f has an essential discontinuity at
x = 0.
Example 2.1.6 Consider f(x) = sin(1/x) as x tends to 0.
graph
The period of the sine function is 2π. As observed in Example 5, 1/x
becomes very large as x becomes small. For this reason, many cycles of the
sine wave pass from the value −1 to the value +1 and a rapid oscillation
occurs near zero. None of the following limits exist:
lim
x→0+ sin
1
x

,
lim
x→0−sin
1
x

,
lim
x→0 sin
1
x

.
It is not possible to deﬁne the function f at 0 to make it continuous. This
kind of discontinuity is called an “oscillation” type of discontinuity.
Example 2.1.7 Consider f(x) = x sin
1
x

as x tends to 0.
graph
In this example, sin
1
x

, oscillates as in Example 6, but the amplitude

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
|x| tends to zero as x tends to 0. In this case,

x

= 0
lim
x→0−x sin
1
x

= 0
lim
x→0 x sin
1
x

= 0.
The discontinuity at x = 0 is removable. We deﬁne f(0) = 0 to make f
continuous at x = 0.
Example 2.1.8 Consider f(x) = x −2
x2 −4 as x tends to ±2.
This is an example of a rational function that yields the indeterminate
form 0/0 when x is replaced by 2. When this kind of situation occurs in
rational functions, it is necessary to cancel the common factors of the nu-
merator and the denominator to determine the appropriate limit if it exists.
In this example, x−2 is the common factor and the reduced form is obtained
through cancellation.
graph
f(x) = x −2
x2 −4 =
x −2
(x −2)(x + 2)
=
1
x + 2.
In order to get the limits as x tends to 2, we used the reduced form to get
1/4. The discontinuity at x = 2 is removed if we deﬁne f(2) = 1/4. This
function still has the essential discontinuity at x = −2.

2.1. INTUITIVE TREATMENT AND DEFINITIONS
41
Example 2.1.9 Consider f(x) =
√x −
√
3
x2 −9
as x tends to 3.
In this case f is not a rational function; still, the problem at x = 3 is
caused by the common factor (√x −
√
3).

f(x) =
√x −

x2 −9

√
3)
(x + 3)(√x −
√
3)(√x +
√
3)
=
1
(x + 3)(√x +
√
3).
As x tends to 3, the reduced form of f tends to 1/(12
√
3). Thus,
lim
x→3+ f(x) = lim
x→3−f(x) = lim
x→3 f(x) =
1
12
√
3.
The discontinuity of f at x = 3 is removed by deﬁning f(3) =
1
12
√
3. The
other discontinuities of f at x = −3 and x = −
√
3 are essential discontinuities
and cannot be removed.
Even though calculus began intuitively, formal and precise deﬁnitions of
limit and continuity became necessary. These precise deﬁnitions have become
the foundations of calculus and its applications to the sciences. Let us assume
that a function f is deﬁned in some open interval, (a, b), except possibly at
one point c, such that a < c < b. Then we make the following deﬁnitions
using the Greek symbols: ϵ, read “epsilon” and δ, read, “delta.”

Deﬁnition 2.1.1 The limit of f(x) as x goes to c from the right is L, if and
only if, for each ϵ > 0, there exists some δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −L| < ϵ,
whenever, c < x < c + δ.
The statement that the limit of f(x) as x goes to c from the right is L, is
expressed by the equation
lim
x→c+ f(x) = L.

Deﬁnition 2.1.2 The limit of f(x) as x goes to c from the left is L, if and
only if, for each ϵ > 0, there exists some δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −L| < ϵ,
whenever, c −δ < x < c.
The statement that the limit of f(x) as x goes to c from the left is L, is
written as
lim
x→c−f(x) = L.

Deﬁnition 2.1.3 The (two-sided) limit of f(x) as x goes to c is L, if and
only if, for each ϵ > 0, there exists some δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −L| < ϵ,
whenever 0 < |x −c| < δ.

Continuity: Formal Deﬁnitions
Deﬁnition 2.1.4 The function f is said to be continuous at c from the right
if f(c) is deﬁned, and
lim
x→c+ f(x) = f(c).
Deﬁnition 2.1.5 The function f is said to be continuous at c from the left
if f(c) is deﬁned, and
lim
x→c−f(x) = f(c).
Deﬁnition 2.1.6 The function f is said to be (two-sided) continuous at c if
f(c) is deﬁned, and
lim
x→c f(x) = f(c).
Remark 4 The continuity deﬁnition requires that the following conditions
be met if f is to be continuous at c:
(i) f(c) is deﬁned as a ﬁnite real number,
(ii) lim
x→c−f(x) exists and equals f(c),
(iii) lim
x→c+ f(x) exists and equals f(c),
(iv) lim
x→c−f(x) = f(c) = lim
x→c+ f(x).
When a function f is not continuous at c, one, or more, of these conditions
are not met.

tinuous for all real values of x. All logarithmic functions, logb x, b > 0, b ̸= 1

where q(x) ̸= 0. Each of the functions tan x, cot x, sec x, csc x, tanh x, coth x,
sech x, and csch x is continuous at each point of its domain.
Deﬁnition 2.1.7 (Algebra of functions) Let f and g be two functions that
have a common domain, say D. Then we deﬁne the following for all x in D:
1.
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)

If the range of f is a subset of the domain of g, then we deﬁne the
composition, g ◦f, of f followed by g, as follows:
5.
(g ◦f)(x) = g(f(x))

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
This completes the proof of Theorem 2.1.1.
Theorem 2.1.2 If f and g are two functions that are continuous on a com-
mon domain D, then the sum, f + g, the diﬀerence, f −g and the product,
fg, are continuous on D. Also, f/g is continuous at each point x in D such
that g(x) ̸= 0.
Proof.
If f and g are continuous at c, then f(c) and g(c) are real numbers
and
lim
x→c f(x) = f(c), lim
x→c g(x) = g(c).
By Theorem 2.1.1, we get
lim
x→c(f(x) + g(x)) = lim
x→c f(x) + lim
x→c g(x) = f(c) + g(c)
lim

Continuity Examples
Example 2.1.10 Show that the constant function f(x) = 4 is continuous at
every real number c. Show that for every constant k, f(x) = k is continuous
at every real number c.
First of all, if f(x) = 4, then f(c) = 4. We need to show that
lim
x→c 4 = 4.

For each ϵ > 0, let δ = 1. Then
|f(x) −f(c)| = |4 −4| = 0 < ϵ

2.1. INTUITIVE TREATMENT AND DEFINITIONS

for all x such that |x −c| < 1. Secondly, for each ϵ > 0, let δ = 1. Then
|f(x) −f(c)| = |k −k| = 0 < ϵ
for all x such that |x −c| < 1. This completes the required proof.
Example 2.1.11 Show that f(x) = 3x −4 is continuous at x = 3.
Let ϵ > 0 be given. Then
|f(x) −f(3)| = |(3x −4) −(5)|

We deﬁne δ = ϵ

lim
x→3 f(x) = f(3)
and, hence, f is continuous at x = 3.
Example 2.1.12 Show that f(x) = x3 is continuous at x = 2.
Since f(2) = 8, we need to prove that
lim
x→2 x3 = 8 = 23.

Let ϵ > 0 be given. Let us concentrate our attention on the open interval

Provided
|x −2| < ϵ
31.
Since we are concentrating on the interval (1, 3) for which |x −2| < 1, we
need to deﬁne δ to be the minimum of 1 and ϵ
31. Thus, if we deﬁne δ =
min{1, ϵ/31}, then
|f(x) −f(2)| < ϵ
whenever |x −2| < δ. By deﬁnition, f(x) is continuous at x = 2.
Example 2.1.13 Show that every polynomial P(x) is continuous at every
c.
From algebra, we recall that, by the Remainder Theorem,
P(x) = (x −c)Q(x) + P(c).
Thus,
|P(x) −P(c)| = |x −c||Q(x)|
where Q(x) is a polynomial of degree one less than the degree of P(x). As
in Example 12, |Q(x)| is bounded on the closed interval [c −1, c + 1]. For
example, if
Q(x) = q0xn−1 + q1xn−2 + · · · + qn−2x + qn−1
|Q(x)| ≤|q0| |x|n−1 + |q1| |x|n−2 + · · · + |qn−2| |x| + |qn−1|.
Let m = max{|x| : c −1 ≤x ≤c + 1}. Then

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Hence,
lim

x = 1
c
and the function f(x) = 1
x is continuous at each c > 0.
A similar argument can be used for c < 0. The function f(x) = 1
x is
continuous for all x ̸= 0.
Example 2.1.15 Suppose that the domain of a function g contains an open
interval containing c, and the range of g contains an open interval containing
g(c). Suppose further that the domain of f contains the range of g. Show
that if g is continuous at c and f is continuous at g(c), then the composition
f ◦g is continuous at c.
We need to show that
lim
x→c f(g(x)) = f(g(c)).
Let ϵ > 0 be given. Since f is continuous at g(c), there exists δ1 > 0 such
that
1.
|f(y) −f(g(c))| < ϵ, whenever, |y −g(c)| < δ1.
Since g is continuous at c, and δ1 > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
2.
|g(x) −g(c)| < δ1, whenever, |x −c| < δ.
On replacing y by g(x) in equation (1), we get
|f(g(x)) −f(g(c))| < ϵ, whenever, |x −c| < δ.
By deﬁnition, it follows that
lim
x→c f(g(x)) = f(g(c))
and the composition f ◦g is continuous at c.
Example 2.1.16 Suppose that two functions f and g have a common do-
main that contains one open interval containing c. Suppose further that f
and g are continuous at c. Then show that

2.1. INTUITIVE TREATMENT AND DEFINITIONS
53
(i) f + g is continuous at c,
(ii) f −g is continuous at c,
(iii) kf is continuous at c for every constant k ̸= 0,
(iv) f · g is continuous at c.
Part (i) We need to prove that
lim
x→c [f(x) + g(x)] = f(c) + g(c).
Let ϵ > 0 be given. Then ϵ
2 > 0. Since f is continuous at c and ϵ
2 > 0, there
exists some δ1 > 0 such that
(1)
|f(x) −f(c)| < ϵ
2, whenever, |x −c| ≤δ1.
Also, since g is continuous at c and ϵ
2 > 0, there exists some δ2 > 0 such that
(2)
|g(x) −g(c)| < ϵ
2, whenever, |x −c| < δ
2.
Let δ = min{δ1, δ2}. Then δ > 0. Let |x −c| < δ. Then |x −c| < δ1 and
|x −c| < δ2. For this choice of x, we get
|{f(x) + g(x)} −{f(c) + g(c)}|
= |{f(x) −f(c)} + {g(x) −g(c)}|
≤|f(x) −f(c)| + |g(x) −g(c)|
(by triangle inequality)

2 + ϵ

= ϵ.
It follows that
lim
x→0 (f(x) + g(x)) = f(c) + g(c)
and f + g is continuous at c. This proves part (i).

54
CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Part (ii) For Part (ii) we chose ϵ, ϵ/2, δ1, δ2 and δ exactly as in Part (i).
Suppose |x −c| < δ. Then |x −c| < δ1 and |x −c| < δ2. For these choices of
x we get
|{f(x) −g(x)} −{f(c) −g(c)}|
= |{f(x) −f(c)} −{g(x) −g(c)}|
≤|f(x) −f(c)| + |g(x) −g(c)|
(by triangle inequality)
< ϵ
2 + ϵ
2
= ϵ.
It follows that
lim
x→c (f(x) −g(x)) = f(c) −g(c)
and, hence, f −g is continuous at c.
Part (iii) For Part (iii) let ϵ > 0 be given. Since k ̸= 0,
ϵ
|k| > 0. Since f is
continuous at c, there exists some δ > 0 such that
|f(x) −f(c)| < ϵ
|k|,
whenever, |x −c| < δ.
If |x −c| < δ, then
|kf(x) −kf(c)| = |k(f(x) −f(c))|
= |k| |(f(x) −f(c)|
< |k| · ϵ
|k|
= ϵ.
It follows that
lim
x→c kf(x) = kf(c)
and, hence, kf is continuous at c.
Part (iv) We need to show that
lim
x→c (f(x)g(x)) = f(c)g(c).

2.1. INTUITIVE TREATMENT AND DEFINITIONS
55
Let ϵ > 0 be given. Without loss of generality we may assume that ϵ < 1.
Let ϵ1 =
ϵ
2(1 + |f(c)| + |g(c)|). Then ϵ1 > 0, ϵ1 < 1 and ϵ1(1 + |f| + |g(c)|) =
ϵ
2 < ϵ. Since f is continuous at c and ϵ1 > 0, there exists δ1 > 0 such that
|f(x) −f(c)| < ϵ1
whenever, |x −c| < δ1.
Also, since g is continuous at c and ϵ1 > 0, there exists δ2 > 0 such that
|g(x) −g(c)| < ϵ1
whenever, |x −c| < δ2.
Let δ = min{δ1, δ2} and |x −c| < δ. For these choices of x, we get
|f(x)g(x) −f(c)g(c)|
= |(f(x) −f(c) + f(c))(g(x) −g(c) + g(c)) −f(c)g(c)|
= |(f(x) −f(c))(g(x) −g(c)) + (f(x) −f(c))g(c) + f(c)(g(x) −g(c))|

< ϵ1(1 + |g(c)| + |f(c)|)
, (since ϵ1 < 1)
< ϵ.
It follows that
lim
x→c f(x)g(x) = f(c)g(c)
and, hence, the product f · g is continuous at c.
Example 2.1.17 Show that the quotient f/g is continuous at c if f and g
are continuous at c and g(c) ̸= 0.
First of all, let us observe that the function 1/g is a composition of g(x)
and 1/x and hence 1/g is continuous at c by virtue of the arguments in
Examples 14 and 15. By the argument in Example 16, the product f(1/g) =
f/g is continuous at c, as required in Example 17.
Example 2.1.18 Show that a rational function of the form p(x)/q(x) is
continuous for all c such that g(c) ̸= 0.

56
CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
In Example 13, we showed that each polynomial function is continuous
at every real number c. Therefore, p(x) is continuous at every c and q(x) is
continuous at every c. By virtue of the argument in Example 17, the quotient
p(x)/q(x) is continuous for all c such that q(c) ̸= 0.
Example 2.1.19 Suppose that f(x) ≤g(x) ≤h(x) for all x in an open
interval containing c and
lim
x→c f(x) = lim
x→c h(x) = L.
Then, show that,
lim
x→c g(x) = L.
Let ϵ > 0 be given. Then there exist δ1 > 0, δ2 > 0, and δ = min{δ1, δ2}
such that
|f(x) −L| < ϵ
2 whenever 0 < |x −c| < δ1
|h(x) −L) < ϵ
2 whenever 0 < |x −c| < δ2.
If 0 < |x −c| < δ1, then 0 < |x −c| < δ1, 0 < |x −c| < δ2 and, hence,
−ϵ
2 < f(x) −L < g(x) −L < h(x) −L < ϵ
2.
It follows that
|g(x) −L| < ϵ
2 < ϵ whenever 0 < |x −c| < δ,
and
lim
x→c g(x) = L.
Example 2.1.20 Show that f(x) = |x| is continuous at 0.
We need to show that
lim
x→0 |x| = 0.
Let ϵ > 0 be given. Let δ = ϵ. Then |x −0| < ϵ implies that |x| < ϵ Hence,

Part (i) By deﬁnition, the point C(cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the length of
the arc CD, lies on the unit circle. It is clear that the length BC = sin θ is
less than θ, the arclength of the arc CD, for small positive θ. Hence,
−θ ≤sin θ ≤θ
and
lim
θ→0+ sin θ = 0.
For small negative θ, we get
θ ≤sin θ ≤−θ

lim

Therefore,

(iii) cot θ and csc θ are continuous for all θ ̸= nπ, n integer.
Part (i) First, we show that for all real c,
lim

It follows that for all real c, sin θ is continuous at c.
Next, we show that

Linear Function Approximations
One simple application of limits is to approximate a function f(x), in a small
neighborhood of a point c, by a line. The approximating line is called the
tangent line. We begin with a review of the equations of a line.
A vertical line has an equation of the form x = c. A vertical line has no
slope. A horizontal line has an equation of the form y = c. A horizontal
line has slope zero. A line that is neither horizontal nor vertical is called an
oblique line.

62
CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Suppose that an oblique line passes through two points, say (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2). Then the slope of this line is deﬁne as
m = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
= y1 −y2
x1 −x2
.
If (x, y) is any arbitrary point on the above oblique line, then
m = y −y1
x −x1
= y −y2
x −x2
.
By equating the two forms of the slope m we get an equation of the line:
y −y1
x −x1
= y2 −y1
x2 −x1
or
y −y2
x −x2
= y2 −y1
x2 −x1
.
On multiplying through, we get the “two point” form of the equation of the
line, namely,
y −y1 = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
(x −x1)
or
y −y2 = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
(x −x2).
Example 2.2.1 Find the equations of the lines passing through the follow-
ing pairs of points:
(i) (4, 2) and (6, 2)
(ii) (1, 3) and (1, 5)
(iii) (3, 4) and (5, −2)
(iv) (0, 2) and (4, 0).
Part (i) Since the y-coordinates of both points are the same, the line is
horizontal and has the equation y = 2. This line has slope 0.
Part (ii) Since the x-coordinates of both points are equal, the line is vertical
and has the equation x = 1.
Part (iii) The slope of the line is given by
m = −2 −4
5 −3 = −3.
The equation of this line is
y −4 = −3(x −3)
or
y + 2 = −3(x −5).

2.2. LINEAR FUNCTION APPROXIMATIONS

On solving for y, we get the equation of the line as
y = −3x + 13.
This line goes through the point (0, 13). The number 13 is called the y-
intercept. The above equation is called the slope-intercept form of the line.
Example 2.2.2 Determine the equations of the lines satisfying the given
conditions:
(i) slope = 3, passes through (2, 4)
(ii) slope = −2, passes through (1, −3)
(iii) slope = m, passes through (x1, y1)
(iv) passes through (3, 0) and (0, 4)
(v) passes through (a, 0) and (0, b)
Part (i) If (x, y) is on the line, then we equate the slopes and simplify:
3 = y −4
x −2
or
y −4 = 3(x −2).
Part (ii) If (x, y) is on the line, then we equate slopes and simplify:
−2 = y + 3
x −1
or
y + 3 = −2(x −1).
Part (iii) On equating slopes and clearing fractions, we get
m = y −y1
x −x1
or
y −y1 = m(x −x1).
This form of the line is called the “point-slope” form of the line.

4 = 1.
The number 3 is called the x-intercept and the number 4 is called the y-
intercept of the line. This form of the equation is called the “two-intercept”
form of the line.

tangency. This tangent line is called the linear approximation of f about

For n = 4 and c = 2, we ﬁnd the slope, m, and equation for the tangent line
to the graph of f(x) = x4 at c = 2:
m = 4c3 = 32
y −24 = 32(x −2)
or
y −16 = 32(x −2).
Deﬁnition 2.2.1 Suppose that a function f is deﬁned on a closed interval
[a, b] and a < c < b. Then c is called a critical point of f if the slope of the
line tangent to the graph of f at (c, f(c)) is zero or undeﬁned. The slope

2.2. LINEAR FUNCTION APPROXIMATIONS

Part (i) In Example 28, we derived the slope function formula for sin x,
namely
slope (sin x, c) = cos c.
Since cos c is deﬁned for all c, the non-end point critical points on [0, 2π]
are π/2 and 3π/2 where the cosine has a zero value. These critical points
correspond to the maximum and minimum values of sin x.
Part (ii) In Example 29, we derived the slope function formula for cos x,
namely
slope (cos x, c) = −sin c.
The critical points are obtained by solving the following equation for c:
−sin c = 0,
0 ≤c ≤2π
c = 0, π, 2π.
These values of c correspond to the maximum value of cos x at c = 0 and 2π,
and the minimum value of cos x at c = π.

The only critical point is c = 0, where the slope function is undeﬁned. This
critical point corresponds to the minimum value of |x| at c = 0. The slope
function is undeﬁned because the tangent line does not exist at c = 0. There
is a sharp corner at c = 0.

Limits and Sequences
We begin with the deﬁnitions of sets, sequences, and the completeness prop-
erty, and state some important results. If x is an element of a set S, we write
x ∈S, read “x is in S.” If x is not an element of S, then we write x /∈S,
read “x is not in S.”
Deﬁnition 2.3.1 If A and B are two sets of real numbers, then we deﬁne
A ∩B = {x : x ∈A and x ∈B}
and
A ∪B = {x : x ∈A or x ∈B or both}.
We read “A ∩B” as the “intersection of A and B.” We read “A ∪B” as the
“union of A and B.” If A ∩B is the empty set, ∅, then we write A ∩B = ∅.
Deﬁnition 2.3.2 Let A be a set of real numbers. Then a number m is said
to be an upper bound of A if x ≤m for all x ∈A. The number m is said to
be a least upper bound of A, written lub(A) if and only if,
(i) m is an upper bound of A, and,
(ii) if q < m, then there is some x ∈A such that q < x ≤m.
Deﬁnition 2.3.3 Let B be a set of real numbers. Then a number ℓis said
to be a lower bound of B if ℓ≤y for each y ∈B. This number ℓis said to
be the greatest lower bound of B, written, glb(b), if and only if,
(i) ℓis a lower bound of B, and,

2.3. LIMITS AND SEQUENCES
73
(ii) if ℓ< p, then there is some element y ∈B such that ℓ≤y < p.
Deﬁnition 2.3.4 A real number p is said to be a limit point of a set S if
and only if every open interval that contains p also contains an element q of
S such that q ̸= p.
Example 2.3.1 Suppose A = [1, 10] and B = [5, 15].
Then A∩B = [5, 10], A∪B = [1, 15], glb(A) = 1, lub(A) = 10, glb(B) = 5
and lub(B) = 15. Each element of A is a limit point of A and each element
of B is a limit point of B.
Example 2.3.2 Let S =
1
n : n is a natural number

.
Then no element of S is a limit point of S. The number 0 is the only
limit point of S. Also, glb(S) = 0 and lub(S) = 1.
Completeness Property: The completeness property of the set R of all real
numbers states that if A is a non-empty set of real numbers and A has an
upper bound, then A has a least upper bound which is a real number.
Theorem 2.3.1 If B is a non-empty set of real numbers and B has a lower
bound, then B has a greatest lower bound which is a real number.
Proof.
Let m denote a lower bound for B. Then m ≤x for every x ∈B.
Let A = {−x : x ∈B}. then −x ≤−m for every x ∈B. Hence, A is a
non-empty set that has an upper bound −m. By the completeness property,
A has a least upper bound lub(A). Then, -lub(A) = glb(B) and the proof is
complete.
Theorem 2.3.2 If x1 and x2 are real numbers such that x1 < x2, then
x1 < 1
2(x1 + x2) < x2.
Proof. We observe that
x1 ≤1
2(x1 + x2) < x2 ↔2x1 < x1 + x2 < 2x2
↔x1 < x2 < x2 + (x2 −x1).
This completes the proof.

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Theorem 2.3.3 Suppose that A is a non-empty set of real numbers and
m = lub(A). If m /∈A, then m is a limit point of A.
Proof.
Let an open interval (a, b) contain m. That is, a < m < b. By the
deﬁnition of a least upper bound, a is not an upper bound for A. Therefore,
there exists some element q of A such that a < q < m < b. Thus, every open
interval (a, b) that contains m must contain a point of A other than m. It
follows that m is a limit point of A.
Theorem 2.3.4 (Dedekind-Cut Property). The set R of all real numbers is
not the union of two non-empty sets A and B such that
(i) if x ∈A and y ∈B, then x < y,
(ii) A contains no limit point of B, and,
(iii) B contains no limit point of A.
Proof.
Suppose that R = A ∪B where A and B are non-empty sets that
satisfy conditions (i), (ii) and (iii). Since A and B are non-empty, there exist
real numbers a and b such that a ∈A and b ∈B. By property (i), a is
a lower bound for B and b is an upper bound for A. By the completeness
property and theorem 2.3.1, A has a least upper bound, say m, and B has a
greatest lower bound, say M. If m /∈A, then m is a limit point of A. Since
B contains no limit point of A, m ∈A. Similarly, M ∈B. It follows that
m < M by condition (i). However, by Theorem 2.3.2,
m < 1
2(m + M) < M.
The number 1
2(m + M) is neither in A nor in B. This is a contradiction,
because R = A ∪B. This completes the proof.
Deﬁnition 2.3.5 An empty set is considered to be a ﬁnite set. A non-empty
set S is said to be ﬁnite if there exists a natural number n and a one-to-one
function that maps S onto the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. Then we say that S has n
elements. If S is not a ﬁnite set, then S is said to be an inﬁnite set. We say
that an inﬁnite set has an inﬁnite number of elements. Two sets are said to
have the same number of elements if there exists a one-to-one correspondence
between them.

2.3. LIMITS AND SEQUENCES

Example 2.3.3 Let A = {a, b, c}, B = {1, 2, 3}, C = {1, 2, 3, . . . }, and D =
{0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . }.
In this example, A and B are ﬁnite sets and contain three elements each.
The sets C and D are inﬁnite sets and have the same number of elements. A
one-to-one correspondence f between n, C and D can be deﬁned as f : C →
D such that
f(1) = 0, f(2n) = n and f(2n + 1) = −n for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Deﬁnition 2.3.6 A set that has the same number of elements as C =
{1, 2, 3, . . . } is said to be countable. An inﬁnite set that is not countable
is said to be uncountable.
Remark 8 The set of all rational numbers is countable but the set of all real
numbers is uncountable.
Deﬁnition 2.3.7 A sequence is a function, say f, whose domain is the set
of all natural numbers. It is customary to use the notation f(n) = an, n =
1, 2, 3, . . . . We express the sequence as a list without braces to avoid confusion
with the set notation:
a1, a2, a3, . . . , an, . . .
or, simply,
{an}∞
n=1.
The number an is called the nth term of the sequence. The sequence is said
to converge to the limit a if for every ϵ > 0, there exists some natural number,
say N, such that |am −a| < ϵ for all m ≥N. We express this convergence
by writing
lim
n→∞an = a.
If a sequence does not converge to a limit, it is said to diverge or be divergent.
Example 2.3.4 For each natural number n, let
an = (−1)n, bn = 2−n, cn = 2n, dn = (−1)n
n
.
The sequence {an} does not converge because its terms oscillate between −1
and 1. The sequence {bn} converges to 0. The sequence {cn} diverges to ∞.
The sequence {dn} converges to 0.

The sequence {an}∞
n=1 is said to diverge to −∞if, for every natural number
N, there exists some m such that
am+j ≤−N , for all j = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Theorem 2.3.5 If p is a limit point of a non-empty set A, then every open
interval that contains p must contain an inﬁnite subset of A.
Proof. Let some open interval (a, b) contain p. Suppose that there are only
two ﬁnite subsets {a1, a2, . . . , an} and {b1, b2, . . . , bm} of distinct elements of
A such that
a < a1 < a2 < · · · < an < p < bm < bm−1 < · · · < b1 < b.
Then the open interval (an, bm) contains p but no other points of A distinct
from p. Hence p is not a limit point of A. The contradiction proves the
theorem.
Theorem 2.3.6 If p is a limit point of a non-empty set A, then there exists
a sequence {pn}∞
n=1, of distinct points pn of A, that converges to p.
Proof. Let a1 = p −1
2, b1 = p + 1
2. Choose a point p1 of A such that p1 ̸= p
and a1 < p1 < p < b1 or a1 < p < p1 < b1. If a1 < p1 < p < b1, then deﬁne
a2 = max

and b2 = p + 1
22. Otherwise, deﬁne a2 = p −1
22 and


. Then the open interval (a2, b2) contains p but not p1
and b2 −a2 ≤1
2. We repeat this process indeﬁnitely to select the sequence
{pn}, of distinct points pn of A, that converges to p. The fact that {pn} is an
inﬁnite sequence is guaranteed by Theorem 2.3.5. This completes the proof.
Theorem 2.3.7 Every bounded inﬁnite set A has at least one limit point p
and there exists a sequence {pn}∞
n=1, of distinct points of A, that converges
to p.

2.3. LIMITS AND SEQUENCES
77
Proof.
We will show that A has a limit point. Since A is bounded, there
exists an open interval (a, b) that contains all points of A.
Then either

a, 1
2(a + b)

contains an inﬁnite subset of A or
1
2(a + b), b

contains an
inﬁnite subset of A. Pick one of the two intervals that contains an inﬁnite
subset of A. Let this interval be denoted (a1, b1). We continue this process
repeatedly to get an open interval (an, bn) that contains an inﬁnite subset of
A and |bn −an| = |b −a|
2n
. Then the lub of the set {an, a2, . . . } and glb of
the set {b1, b2, . . . } are equal to some real number p. It follows that p is a
limit point of A. By Theorem 2.3.6, there exists a sequence {pn}, of distinct
points of A, that converges to p. This completes the proof.
Deﬁnition 2.3.9 A set is said to be a closed set if it contains all of its limit
points. The complement of a closed set is said to be an open set. (Recall
that the complement of A is {x ∈R : x /∈A}.)
Theorem 2.3.8 The interval [a, b] is a closed and bounded set. Its comple-
ment (−∞, a) ∪(b, ∞) is an open set.
Proof.
Let p ∈(−∞, a) ∪(b, ∞). Then −∞< p < a or b < p < ∞. The
intervals

p −1
2, 1
2(a + p)

or
1
2(b + p), p + 1


contain no limit point of
[a, b]. Thus [a, b] must contain its limit points, because they are not in the
complement.
Theorem 2.3.9 If a non-empty set A has no upper bound, then there exists
a sequence {pn}∞
n=1, of distinct points of A, that diverges to ∞. Furthermore,
every subsequence of {pn}∞
n=1 diverges to ∞
Proof. Since 1 is not an upper bound of A, there exists an element p1 of A
such that 1 < p1. Let a1 = max{2, p1}. Choose a point, say p2, of A such
that a1 < p2. By repeating this process indeﬁnitely, we get the sequence
{pn} such that pn > n and p1 < p2 < p3 < . . . . Clearly, the sequence
{pn}∞
n=1 diverges to ∞. It is easy to see that every subsequence of {pn}∞
n=1
also diverges to ∞.
Theorem 2.3.10 If a non-empty set B has no lower bound, then there exists
a sequence {qn}∞
n=1, of distinct points of B, that diverges to −∞. Further-
more, every subsequence of {qn}∞
n=1 diverges to −∞.

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Proof.
Let A = {−x : x ∈B}. Then A has no upper bound. By Theorem
2.3.9, there exists a sequence {pn}∞
n=1, of distinct points of A, that diverges to
∞. Let qn = −pn. Then {qn}∞
n=1 is a sequence that meets the requirements
of the Theorem 2.3.10. Also, every subsequence of {qn}∞
n=1 diverges to −∞.
Theorem 2.3.11 Let {pn}∞
n=1 be a sequence of points of a closed set S that
converges to a point p of S. If f is a function that is continuous on S, then
the sequence {f(pn)}∞
n=1 converges to f(p). That is, continuous functions
preserve convergence of sequences on closed sets.
Proof.
Let ϵ > 0 be given. Since f is continuous at p, there exists a δ > 0
such that
|f(x) −f(p)| < ϵ
whenever
|x −p| < δ,
and x ∈S.
The open interval (p−δ, p+δ) contains the limit point p of S. The sequence
{pn}∞
n=1 converges to p. There exists some natural numbers N such that for
all n ≥N,
p −δ < pn < p + δ.
Then
|f(pn) −f(p)| < ϵ
whenever n ≥N.
By deﬁnition, {f(pn)}∞
n=1 converges to f(p). We write this statement in the
following notation:
lim
n→∞f(pn) = f

lim
n→∞pn

.
That is, continuous functions allow the interchange of taking the limit and
applying the function. This completes the proof of the theorem.
Corollary 1 If S is a closed and bounded interval [a, b], then Theorem 2.3.11
is valid for [a, b].
Theorem 2.3.12 Let a function f be deﬁned and continuous on a closed
and bounded set S. Let Rf = {f(x) : x ∈S}. Then Rf is bounded.
Proof. Suppose that Rf has no upper bound. Then there exists a sequence
{f(xn)}∞
n=1, of distinct points of Rf, that diverges to ∞.
The set A =
{x1, x2, . . . } is an inﬁnite subset of S.
By Theorem 2.3.7, the set A has
some limit point, say p. Since S is closed, p ∈S. There exists a sequence

2.3. LIMITS AND SEQUENCES
79
{pn}∞
n=1, of distinct points of A that converges to p. By the continuity of
f, {f(pn)}∞
n=1 converges to f(p). Without loss of generality, we may assume
that {f(pn)}∞
n=1 is a subsequence of {f(xn)}∞
n=1. Hence {f(pn)}∞
n=1 diverges
to ∞, and f(p) = ∞. This is a contradiction, because f(p) is a real number.
This completes the proof of the theorem.
Theorem 2.3.13 Let a function f be deﬁned and continuous on a closed
and bounded set S. Let Rf = {f(x) : x ∈S}. Then Rf is a closed set.
Proof. Let q be a limit point of Rf. Then there exists a sequence {f(xn)}∞
n=1,
of distinct points of Rf, that converges to q. As in Theorem 2.3.12, the set
A = {x1, x2, . . . } has a limit point p, p ∈S, and there exists a subsequence
{pn}∞
n=1, of {xn}∞
n=1 that converges to p. Since f is deﬁned and continuous
on S,
q = lim
n→∞f(pn) = f

lim
n→∞pn

= f(p).
Therefore, q ∈Rf and Rf is a closed set. This completes the proof of the
theorem.
Theorem 2.3.14 Let a function f be deﬁned and continuous on a closed
and bounded set S. Then there exist two numbers c1 and c2 in S such that
for all x ∈S,
f(c1) ≤f(x) ≤f(c2).
Proof.
By Theorems 2.3.12 and 2.3.13, the range, Rf, of f is a closed and
bounded set. Let
m = glb(Rf) and M = lub(Rf).
Since Rf is a closed set, m and M are in Rf. Hence, there exist two numbers,
say c1 and c2, in S such that
m = f(c1) and M = f(c2).
This completes the proof of the theorem.
Deﬁnition 2.3.10 A set S of real numbers is said to be compact, if and
only if S is closed and bounded.
Theorem 2.3.15 A continuous function maps compact subsets of its domain
onto compact subsets of its range.

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY

Deﬁnition 2.3.11 Suppose that a function f is deﬁned and continuous on
a compact set S. A number m is said to be an absolute minimum of f on S
if m ≤f(x) for all x ∈S and m = f(c) for some c in S.
A number M is said to be an absolute maximum of f on S if M ≥f(x)
for all x ∈S and M = f(d) for some d in S.
Theorem 2.3.16 Suppose that a function f is continuous on a compact set
S. Then there exist two points c1 and c2 in S such that f(c1) is the absolute
minimum and f(c2) is the absolute maximum of f on S.
Proof. Theorem 2.3.14 proves Theorem 2.3.16.

there exists some N such that if n ≥N, then |an −p| < ϵ/2. If m ≥N

Properties of Continuous Functions
We recall that if two functions f and g are deﬁned and continuous on a
common domain D, then f + g, f −g, af + bg, g · f are all continuous on
D, for all real numbers a and b. Also, the quotient f/g is continuous for all
x in D where g(x) ̸= 0. In section 2.3 we proved the following:
(i) Continuous functions preserve convergence of sequences.
(ii) Continuous functions map compact sets onto compact sets.
(iii) If a function f is continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b], then
{f(x) : x ∈[a, b]} ⊆[m, M], where m and M are absolute minimum and
absolute maximum of f, on [a, b], respectively.
Theorem 2.4.1 Suppose that a function f is deﬁned and continuous on
some open interval (a, b) and a < c < b.
(i) If f(c) > 0, then there exists some δ > 0 such that f(x) > 0 whenever
c −δ < x < c + δ.
(ii) If f(c) < 0, then there exists some δ > 0 such that f(x) < 0 whenever
c −δ < x < c + δ.
Proof.
Let ϵ = 1
2 |f(c)|. For both cases (i) and (ii), ϵ > 0. Since f is
continuous at c and ϵ > 0, there exists some δ > 0 such that a < (c −δ) <
c < (c + δ) < b and
|f(x) −f(c)| < ϵ
whenever
|x −c| < δ.

2.4. PROPERTIES OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

We observe that
|f(x) −f(c)| < ϵ ↔|f(x) −f(c)| < 1
2 |f(c)|
↔−1
2 |f(c)| < f(x) −f(c) < 1
2 |f(c)|
↔f(c) −1
2 |f(c)| < f(x) < f(c) + 1
2 |f(c)|.
We note also that the numbers f(c) −1
2 |f(c)| and f(c) + 1
2 |f(c)| have the
same sign as f(c). Therefore, for all x such that |x−c| < δ, we have f(x) > 0
in part (i) and f(x) < 0 in part (ii) as required. This completes the proof.
Theorem 2.4.2 Suppose that a function f is deﬁned and continuous on
some closed and bounded interval [a, b] such that either
(i)
f(a) < 0 < f(b)
or
(ii)
f(b) < 0 < f(a).
Then there exists some c such that a < c < b and f(c) = 0.
Proof.
Part (i) Let A {x : x ∈[a, b] and f(x) < 0}.
Then A is non-
empty because it contains a. Since A is a subset of [a, b], A is bounded. Let
c1 = lub(A). We claim that f(c1) = 0. Suppose f(c1) ̸= 0. Then f(c1) > 0
or f(c1) < 0. By Theorem 2.4.1, there exists δ > 0 such that f(x) has the
same sign as f(c1) for all x such that c1 −δ < x < c1 + δ.
If f(c1) < 0, then f(x) < 0 for all x such that c1 < x < c1 + δ and hence
c1 ̸= lub(A). If f(c1) > 0, then f(x) > 0 for all x such that c1 −δ < x < c1
and hence c1 ̸= lub(A). This contradiction proves that f(c1) = 0.
Part (ii) is proved by a similar argument.

lowing method of bisection for ﬁnding zeros of a continuous function f:

This method is slow but it approximates the number c guaranteed by
Theorem 2.4.2. This method is used to get close enough to the zero. The
switchover to the faster Newton’s Method that will be discussed in the next
section.
Theorem 2.4.3 (Intermediate Value Theorem).
Suppose that a function
is deﬁned and continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b]. Suppose
further that there exists some real number k such that either (i) f(a) < k <
f(b) or (ii) f(b) < k < f(a). Then there exists some c such that a < c < b
and f(c) = k.
Proof.
Let g(x) = f(x) −k. Then g is continuous on [a, b] and either (i)
g(a) < 0 < g(b) or (ii) g(b) < 0 < g(a). By Theorem 2.4.2, there exists some
c such that a < c < b and g(c) = 0. Then
0 = g(c) = f(c) −k
and
f(c) = k
as required. This completes the proof.

2.4. PROPERTIES OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS

Theorem 2.4.4 Suppose that a function f is deﬁned and continuous on a
closed and bounded interval [a, b]. Then there exist real numbers m and M
such that
[m, M] = {f(x) : a ≤x ≤b}.
That is, a continuous function f maps a closed and bounded interval [a, b]
onto a closed and bounded interval [m, M].
Proof.
By Theorem 2.3.14, there exist two numbers c1 and c2 in [a, b] such
that for all x ∈[a, b],
m = f(c1) ≤f(x) ≤f(c2) = M.
By the Intermediate Value Theorem (2.4.3), every real value between m and
M is in the range of f contained in the interval with end points c1 and c2.
Therefore,
[m, M] = {f(x) : a ≤x ≤b}.
Recall that m = absolute minimum and M = absolute maximum of f on
[a, b]. This completes the proof of the theorem.
Theorem 2.4.5 Suppose that a function f is continuous on an interval [a, b]
and f has an inverse on [a, b]. Then f is either strictly increasing on [a, b]
or strictly decreasing on [a, b].
Proof.
Since f has in inverse on [a, b], f is a one-to-one function on [a, b].
So, f(a) ̸= f(b). Suppose that f(a) < f(b). Let
A = {x : f is strictly increasing on [a, x] and a ≤x ≤b}.
Let c be the least upper bound of A. If c = b, then f is strictly increasing on
[a, b] and the proof is complete. If c = a, then there exists some d such that
a < d < b and f(d) < f(a) < f(b). By the intermediate value theorem there
must exist some x such that d < x < b and f(x) = f(a). This contradicts the
fact that f is one-to-one. Then a < c < b and there exists some d such that
c < d < b and f(a) < f(d) < f(c). By the intermediate value theorem there
exists some x such that a < x < c and f(x) = f(c) and f is not one-to-one.
It follows that c must equal b and f is strictly increasing on [a, b]. Similarly,
if f(a) > f(b), f will be strictly decreasing on [a, b]. This completes the
proof of the theorem.

88
CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Theorem 2.4.6 Suppose that a function f is continuous on [a, b] and f
is one-to-one on [a, b]. Then the inverse of f exists and is continuous on
J = {f(x) : a ≤x ≤b}.
Proof.
By Theorem 2.4.4, J = [m, M] where m and M are the absolute
minimum and the absolute maximum of f on [a, b]. Also, there exist numbers
c1 and c2 on [a, b] such that f(c1) = m and f(c2) = M. Since f is either
strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on [a, b], either a = c1 and b = c2
or a = c2 and b = c1. Consider the case where f is strictly increasing and
a = c1, b = c2. Let m < d < M and d = f(c). Then a < c < b. We show
that f −1 is continuous at d. Let ϵ > 0 be such that a < c −ϵ < c < c + ϵ2b.
Let d1 = f(c −ϵ), d2 = f(c + ϵ). Since f is strictly increasing, d1 < d <
d2. Let δ = min(d −d1, d2 −d). It follows that if 0 < |y −d| < δ, then
|f −1(y)−f −1(d)| < ϵ and f −1 is continuous at d. Similarly, we can prove the
one-sided continuity of f −1 at m and M. A similar argument will prove the
continuity of f −1 if f is strictly decreasing on [a, b].
Theorem 2.4.7 Suppose that a function f is continuous on an interval I
and f is one-to-one on I. Then the inverse of f exists and is continuous on
I.
Proof.
Let J = {f(x) : x is in I}. By the intermediate value theorem
J is also an interval. Let d be an interior point of J. Then there exists a
closed interval [m, M] contained in I and m < d < M. Let c1 = f −1(m), c2 =
f −1(b), a = min{c1, c2} Since the theorem is valid on [a, b], f −1 is continuous
at d. The end points can be treated in a similar way. This completes the
proof of the theorem. (See the proof of Theorem 2.4.6).
Theorem 2.4.8 (Fixed Point Theorem).
Let f satisfy the conditions of
Theorem 2.4.4. Suppose further that a ≤m ≤M ≤b, where m and M are
the absolute minimum and absolute maximum, respectively, of f on [a, b].
Then there exists some p ∈[a, b] such that f(p) = p. That is, f has a ﬁxed
point p on [a, b].
Proof.
If f(a) = a, then a is a ﬁxed point. If f(b) = b, then b is a ﬁxed
point. Suppose that neither a nor b is a ﬁxed point of f. Then we deﬁne
g(x) = f(x) −x
for all x ∈[a, b].

2.4. PROPERTIES OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS
89
We observe that g(b) < 0 < g(a). By the Intermediate Value Theorem
(2.4.3) there exists some p such that a < p < b and g(p) = 0. Then
0 = g(p) = f(p) −p
and hence,
f(p) = p
and p is a ﬁxed point of f on [a, b]. This completes the proof.
Remark 9 The Fixed Point Theorem (2.4.5) is the basis of the ﬁxed point
iteration methods that are used to locate zeros of continuous functions. We
illustrate this concept by using Newton’s Method as an example.
Example 2.4.2 Consider f(x) = x3 + 4x −10.
Since f(1) = −5 and f(2) = 6, by the Intermediate Value Theorem (2.4.3)
there is some c such that 1 < c < 2 and f(c) = 0. We construct a function g
whose ﬁxed points agree with the zeros of f. In Newton’s Method we used
the following general formula:
g(x) = x −
f(x)
slope(f(x), x).
Note that if f(x) = 0, then g(x) = x, provided slope (f(x), x) ̸= 0. We ﬁrst
compute
Slope(f(x), x) = lim
h→0
1
h [f(x + h) −f(x)]
= lim

h [{(x + h)3 + 4(x + h) −10} −{x3 + 4x −10}]

h→0
1
h [3x2h + 3xh2 + h3 + 4h]
= lim
h→0 [3x2 + 3xh + h2 + 4]
= 3x2 + 4.
We note that 3x2 + 4 is never zero. So, Newton’s Method is deﬁned.
The ﬁxed point iteration is deﬁned by the equation
xn+1 = g(xn) = xn −
f(xn)
slope(f(x), xn)

To begin the iteration we required a guess x0. This guess is generally
obtained by using a few steps of the Bisection Method described in Example
36. Let x0 = 1.5. Next, we need a stopping rule. Let us say that we will
stop when a few digits of xn do not change anymore. Let us stop when
|xn+1 −xn| < 10−4.
We will leave the computation of x1, x2, x3, . . . as an exercise.
Remark 10 Newton’s Method is fast and quite robust as long as the initial
guess is chosen close enough to the intended zeros.
Example 2.4.3 Consider the same equation (x3 + 4x −10 = 0) as in the
preceding example.
We solve for x in some way, such as,

xn+1 = g(xn), x0 = 1.5
and stop when
|xn+1 −xn| < 10−4.
We leave the computations of x1, x2, x3 . . . as an exercise. Try to compare the
number of iterations needed to get the same accuracy as Newton’s Method
in the previous example.

f(xn+1)−f(xn)

xn+2 = xn+1 −f(xn+1)(xn+1 −xn)
f(xn+1 −f(xn)
This method is slower than Newton’s Method, but faster than the Bi-
section. The big advantage is that we do not need to compute the slope
function for f. The stopping rule can be the same as in Newton’s Method.
Use the secant Method for Exercises 2 and 3 with x0 = 0.5, x1 = 0.7 and
|xn+1 −xn| < 10−4.
Compare the number of iterations needed with
Newton’s Method.

A set S is said to be connected if S is not the union of two non-empty
sets A and B such that A contains no limit point of B and B contains
no limit point of A. Show that every closed and bounded interval [a, b]
is connected.
(Hint: Assume that [a, b] is not connected and [a, b] = A∪B, a ∈A, B ̸=
∅as described in the problem. Let m = lub(A), M = glb(B). Argue
that m ∈A and m ∈B. Then 1

Show that the Intermediate Value Theorem (2.4.3) guarantees that con-

S be connected and f be continuous on S. Let Rf = {f(x) : x ∈S}.
Suppose Rf = A ∪B, A ̸= ∅, B ̸= ∅, such that A contains no limit point
of B and B contains no limit point of A. Let U = {x ∈S : f(x) ∈A},
V = {x ∈S : f(x) ∈B}. Then S = U ∪V, U ̸= ∅and V ̸= ∅. Since S
is connected, either U contains a limit point of V or V contains a limit
point of U. Suppose p ∈V and p is a limit point of U. Then choose a

CHAPTER 2. LIMITS AND CONTINUITY
Show that A is an open set.
(Hint: Let p ∈A. Then f(p) ∈(c, d). Choose ϵ > 0 such that c <
p −ϵ < p + ϵ < d. Since f is continuous at p, there is δ > 0 such that
|f(x)−f(p)| < ϵ whenever |x−p| < δ. This means that the open interval
(p −δ, p + δ) is contained in A. By deﬁnition, A is open. This proves
that the inverse of a continuous function maps an open set onto an open
set.)

Diﬀerentiation
In Deﬁnition 2.2.2, we deﬁned the slope function of a function f at c by
slope(f(x), c) = lim
x→c
f(x) −f(c)
x −c
= lim
h→0
f(c + h) −f(c)
h
.
The slope (f(x), c) is called the derivative of f at c and is denoted f ′(c).
Thus,
f ′(c) = lim
h→0
f(c + h) −f(c)
h
.
Link to another ﬁle.
3.1
The Derivative
Deﬁnition 3.1.1 Let f be deﬁned on a closed interval [a, b] and a < x < b.
Then the derivative of f at x, denoted f ′(x), is deﬁned by
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
f(x + h) −f(x)
h
whenever the limit exists. When f ′(x) exists, we say that f is diﬀerentiable
at x. At the end points a and b, we deﬁne one-sided derivatives as follows:
(i) f ′(a+) = lim
x→a+
f(x) −f(a)
x −a
= lim
h→0+
f(a + h) −f(a)
h
.
99

100
CHAPTER 3. DIFFERENTIATION
We call f ′(a+) the right-hand derivative of f at a.
(ii) f ′(b−) = lim
x→b−
f(x) −f(b)
x −b
= lim
h→0−
f(b + h) −f(b)
h
.
We call f ′(b) the left-hand derivative of f at b.
Example 3.1.1 In Example 28 of Section 2.2, we proved that if f(x) = sin x,
then f ′(c) = slope (sin x, c) = cos c. Thus, f ′(x) = cos x if f(x) = sin x.
Example 3.1.2 In Example 29 of Section 2.2, we proved that if f(x) =
cos x, then f ′(c) = −sin c. Thus, f ′(x) = −sin x if f(x) = cos x.
Example 3.1.3 In Example 30 of Section 2.2, we proved that if f(x) = xn
for a natural number n, then f ′(c) = ncn−1. Thus f ′(x) = nxn−1, when
f(x) = xn, for any natural number n.
In order to ﬁnd derivatives of functions obtained from the basic elemen-
tary functions using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division, we state and prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3.1.1 If f is diﬀerentiable at c, then f is continuous at c. The
converse is false.
Proof. Suppose that f is diﬀerentiable at c. Then
lim
x→c
f(x) −f(c)
x −c
= f ′(c)
and f ′(c) is a real number. So,
lim
x→c f(x) = lim

= f ′(c) · 0 + f(c)

3.1. THE DERIVATIVE
101
Therefore, if f is diﬀerentiable at c, then f is continuous at c.
To prove that the converse is false we consider the function f(x) = |x|.
This function is continuous at x = 0. But
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
|x + h| −|x|

Thus, |x| is continuous at 0 but not diﬀerentiable at 0. This completes the

interval (a, b) and f ′(x) and g′(x) exist at each point x in (a, b). Then

The Chain Rule
Suppose we have two functions, u and y, related by the equations:
u = g(x) and y = f(u).

112
CHAPTER 3. DIFFERENTIATION
Then y = (f ◦g)(x) = f(g(x)).
The chain rule deals with the derivative of the composition and may be
stated as the following theorem:
Theorem 3.2.1 (The Chain Rule). Suppose that g is deﬁned in an open
interval I containing c, and f is deﬁned in an open interval J containing
g(c), such that g(x) is in J for all x in I. If g is diﬀerentiable at c, and f is
diﬀerentiable at g(c), then the composition (f ◦g) is diﬀerentiable at c and
(f ◦g)′(c) = f ′(g(c)) · g′(c).
In general, if u = g(x) and y = f(u), then
dy
dx = dy
du · du
dx.
Proof. Let F be deﬁned on J such that
F(u) =
(f(u)−f(g(c))
u−g(c)
if u ̸= g(c)
f ′(g(c))
if u = g(c)
since f is diﬀerentiable at g(c),
lim
u→g(c) F(u) = lim
u→g(c)
f(u) −f(g(c))
u −g(c)
= f ′(g(c))
= F(g(c)).
Therefore, F is continuous at g(c). By the deﬁnition of F,
f(u) −f(g(c)) = F(u)(u −g(c))
for all u in J. For each x in I, we let y = g(x) on I. Then
(f ◦g)′(c) = lim
x→c
(f ◦g)(x) −(f ◦g)(c)
x −c
= lim
x→c
f(g(x)) −f(g(c))
g(x) −g(c)
· g(x) −g(c)
x −c

u→g(c) F(u) · lim
x→c
g(x) −g(c)
x −c
= f ′(g(c)) · g′(c).

3.2. THE CHAIN RULE
113
It follows that f ◦g is diﬀerentiable at c. The general result follows by replac-
ing c by the independent variable x. This completes the proof of Theorem
3.2.1.
Example 3.2.1 Let y = u2 + 1 and u = x3 + 4. Then
dy
du = 2u and du
dx = 3x2.
Therefore,
dy
dx = dy
du · du
dx
= 2u · 3x2
= 6x2(x3 + 4) .
Using the composition notation, we get
y = (x3 + 4)2 + 1 = x6 + 8x3 + 17
and
dy
dx = 6x5 + 24x2
= 6x2(x3 + 4) .
Using
(f ◦g)′(x) = f ′(g(x)) · g′(x),
we see that
(f ◦g)(x) = (x3 + 4)2 + 1
and
(f ◦g)′(x) = f ′(g(x)) · g′(x)
= 2(x3 + 4)1 · (3x2)
= 6x2(x3 + 4) .

If we express y in terms of x explicitly, then we get
y = (sin(4x + 1) + 3)2
and
dy
dx = 2(sin(4x + 1) + 3)1 · ((cos(4x + 1)) · 4 + 0)

Diﬀerentiation of Inverse Functions
One of the applications of the chain rule is to compute the derivatives of
inverse functions. We state the exact result as the following theorem:
Theorem 3.3.1 Suppose that a function f has an inverse, f −1, on an open
interval I. If u = f −1(x), then
(i) du
dx =
1
  dx
du

(ii) (f −1)′(x) =
1
f ′(f −1(x)) =
1
f ′(u)
Proof. By comparison, x = f(f −1(x)) = x. Hence, by the chain rule
1 = dx
dx = f ′(f −1(x)) · (f −1)′(x)

3.3. DIFFERENTIATION OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS
119
and
(f −1)′(x) =
1
f ′(f −1(x)).
In the u = f −1(x) notation, we have
du
dx =

  dx
du
.
Remark 11 In Examples 76–81, we assume that the inverse trigonometric
functions are diﬀerentiable.
Example 3.3.1 Let u = arcsin x, −1 ≤x ≤1, and −π

Implicit Diﬀerentiation
So far we have dealt with explicit functions such as x2, sin x, cos x, ln x, ex, sinh x
and cosh x etc. In applications, two variables can be related by an equation
such as

3.4. IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
131
(i) x2 +y2 = 16
(ii) x3 +y3 = 4xy
(iii) x sin y +cos 3y = sin 2y.
In such cases, it is not always practical or desirable to solve for one variable
explicitly in terms of the other to compute derivatives.
Instead, we may
implicitly assume that y is some function of x and diﬀerentiate each term of
the equation with respect to x. Then we solve for y′, noting any conditions
under which the derivative may or may not exist.
This process is called
implicit diﬀerentiation. We illustrate it by examples.
Example 3.4.1 Find dy
dx if x2 + y2 = 16.
Assuming that y is to be considered as a function of x, we diﬀerentiate
each term of the equation with respect to x.

y , provided y ̸= 0.
We observe that there are two points, namely (4, 0) and (−4, 0) that satisfy
the equation. At each of these points, the tangent line is vertical and hence,
has no slope.
If we solve for y in terms of x, we get two solutions, each representing a
function of x:
y = (16 −x2)1/2
or
y = −(16 −x2)1/2.

132

where 3y2 −4x ̸= 0.
Example 3.4.3 Compute dy
dx for the equation x sin y + cos 3y = sin 2y. In
this example, it certainly is not desirable to solve for y explicitly in terms of

3.4. IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION

with respect to x and then algebraically solve for y in terms of x and y.

Higher Order Derivatives
If the vertical height y of an object is a function f of time t, then y′(t) is
called its velocity, denoted v(t). The derivative v′(t) is called the acceleration
of the object and is denoted a(t). That is,
y(t) = f(t), y′(t) = v(t), v′(t) = a(t).
We say that a(t) is the second derivative of y, with respect to t, and write
y′′(t) = a(t)

and then generalize the pattern.
Part (i) f(x) = sin x, f ′(x) = cos x, f ′′(x) = −sin x, f ′′′(x) = cos x, f 4(x) =
sin x. Then the next four derivatives are repeated and so on. We get
f (4n)(n) = sin x, f (4n+1)(x) = cos x, f (4n+2)(x) = −sin x, f (4n+3)(x) = −cos x.
By evaluating these at c = 0, we get

Applications of Diﬀerentiation
One of the important problems in the real world is optimization. This is the
problem of maximizing or minimizing a given function. Diﬀerentiation plays
a key role in solving such real world problems.
4.1
Mathematical Applications
Deﬁnition 4.1.1 A function f with domain D is said to have an absolute
maximum at c if f(x) ≤f(c) for all x ∈D. The number f(c) is called the
absolute maximum of f on D. The function f is said to have a local maximum
(or relative maximum) at c if there is some open interval (a, b) containing c
and f(c) is the absolute maximum of f on (a, b).
Deﬁnition 4.1.2 A function f with domain D is said to have an absolute
minimum at c if f(c) ≤f(x) for all x in D. The number f(c) is called the
absolute minimum of f on D. The number f(c) is called a local minimum
(or relative minimum) of f if there is some open interval (a, b) containing c
and f(c) is the absolute minimum of f on (a, b).
Deﬁnition 4.1.3 An absolute maximum or absolute minimum of f is called
an absolute extremum of f. A local maximum or minimum of f is called a
local extremum of f.

4.1. MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS
147
Theorem 4.1.1
(Extreme Value Theorem) If a function f is continuous
on a closed and bounded interval [a, b], then there exist two points, c1 and c2,
in [a, b] such that f(c1) is the absolute minimum of f on [a, b] and f(c2) is
the absolute maximum of f on [a, b].
Proof. Since [a, b] is a closed and bounded set and f is continuous on [a, b],
Theorem 4.1.1 follows from Theorem 2.3.14.
Deﬁnition 4.1.4 A function f is said to be increasing on an open interval
(a, b) if f(x1) < f(x2) for all x1 and x2 in (a, b) such that x1 < x2. The
function f is said to be decreasing on (a, b) if f(x1) > f(x2) for all x1 and
x2 in (a, b) such that x1 < x2. The function f is said to be non-decreasing
on (a, b) if f(x1) ≤f(x2) for all x1 and x2 in (a, b) such that x1 < x2. The
function f is said to be non-increasing on (a, b) if f(x1) ≥f(x2) for all x1
and x2 in (a, b) such that x1 < x2.
Theorem 4.1.2 Suppose that a function f is deﬁned on some open interval
(a, b) containing a number c such that f ′(c) exists and f ′(c) ̸= 0. Then f(c)
is not a local extremum of f.
Proof.
Suppose that f ′(c) ̸= 0. Let ϵ = 1
2 |f ′(c)|. Then ϵ > 0.
Since ϵ > 0 and
f ′(c) = lim
x→c
f(x) −f(c)
x −c

there exists some δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −c| < δ, then

The following three numbers have the same sign, namely,
f ′(c), f ′(c) −1
2 |f ′(c)|
and
f ′(c) + 1
2 |f ′(c)|.

148
CHAPTER 4. APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Since f ′(c) > 0 or f ′(c) < 0, we conclude that
0 < f(x) −f(c)
x −c
or
f(x) −f(c)
x −c
< 0
for all x such that 0 < |x −c| < δ. Thus, if c −δ < x1 < c < x2 < c + δ, then
either f(x1) < f(c) < f(x2) or f(x1) > f(c) > f(x2). It follows that f(c) is
not a local extremum.
Theorem 4.1.3 If f is deﬁned on an open interval (a, b) containing c, f(c)
is a local extremum of f and f ′(c) exists, then f ′(c) = 0.
Proof. This theorem follows immediately from Theorem 4.1.2.
Theorem 4.1.4 (Rolle’s Theorem) Suppose that a function f is continuous
on a closed and bounded interval [a, b], diﬀerentiable on the open interval
(a, b) and f(a) = f(b). Then there exists some c such that a < c < b and
f ′(c) = 0.
Proof.
Since f is continuous on [a, b], there exist two numbers c1 and c2
on [a, b] such that f(c1) ≤f(x) ≤f(c2) for all x in [a, b]. (Extreme Value
Theorem.) If f(c1) = f(c2), then the function f has a constant value on [a, b]
and f ′(c) = 0 for c = 1
2 (a + b). If f(c1) ̸= f(c2), then either f(c1) ̸= f(a)
or f(c2) ̸= f(a). But f ′(c1) = 0 and f ′(c2) = 0. It follows that f ′(c1) = 0 or
f ′(c2) = 0 and either c1 or c2 is between a and b. This completes the proof
of Rolle’s Theorem.
Theorem 4.1.5 (The Mean Value Theorem) Suppose that a function f is
continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b] and f is diﬀerentiable on
the open interval (a, b). Then there exists some number c such that a < c < b
and
f(b) −f(a)
b −a
= f ′(c).
Proof.
We deﬁne a function g(x) that is obtained by subtracting the line
joining (a, f, (a)) and (b, f(b)) from the function f:
g(x) = f(x) −
f(b) −f(a)
b −a
(x −a) + f(a)

.

4.1. MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS
149
The g is continuous on [a, b] and diﬀerentiable on (a, b). Furthermore, g(a) =
g(b) = 0. By Rolle’s Theorem, there exists some number c such that a < c < b
and
0 = g′(c)
= f ′(c) −f(b) −f(a)
b −a
.
Hence,
f(b) −f(a)
b −a
= f ′(c)
as required.
Theorem 4.1.6 (Cauchy-Mean Value Theorem) Suppose that two functions
f and g are continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b], diﬀerentiable
on the open interval (a, b) and g′(x) ̸= 0 for all x in (a, b). Then there exists
some number c in (a, b) such that
f(b) −f(a)
g(b) −g(a) = f ′(c)
g′(c) .
Proof. We deﬁne a new function h on [a, b] as follows:
h(x) = f(x) −f(a) −f(b) −f(a)
g(b) −g(a) (g(x) −g(a)).
Then h is continuous on [a, b] and diﬀerentiable on (a, b). Furthermore,
h(a) = 0
and
h(b) = 0.
By Rolle’s Theorem, there exist some c in (a, b) such that h′(c) = 0. Then
0 = h′(c) = f ′(c) −f(b) −f(a)
g(b) −g(a) g′(c)
and, hence,
f(b) −f(a)
g(b) −g(c) = f ′(c)
g′(c)
as required. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.1.6.

Theorem 4.1.7 (L’Hospital’s Rule, 0

tiable and g′(x) ̸= 0 on an open interval (a, b) containing c (except possibly
at c). Suppose that

lim

g(x) = lim
x→c
f ′(x)
g′(x) = L.
Proof.
We deﬁne f(c) = 0 and g(c) = 0. Let x ∈(c, b). Then f and g are
continuous on [c, x], diﬀerentiable on (c, x) and g′(y) ̸= 0 on (c, x). By the
Cauchy Mean Value Theorem, there exists some point y ∈(c, x) such that
f(x)
g(x) = f(x) −f(c)
g(x) −g(c) = f ′(y)
g′(y) .
Then
lim
x→c+
f(x)
g(x) = lim

f ′(y)
g′(y) = L.
Similarly, we can prove that

Therefore,

(vi) If f ′(x) = g′(x) on (a, b), then f(x) = g(x)+C, for constant C, on (a, b).
Proof.
Part (i) Suppose a < x1 < x2 < b. Then f is continuous on [x1, x2] and
diﬀerentiable on (x1, x2). By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some c
such that a < x1 < c < x2 < b and
f(x2) −f(x1)
x2 −x1
= f ′(c) > 0.
Since x2 −x1 > 0, it follows that f(x2) −f(x1) > 0 and f(x2) > f(x1). By
deﬁnition, f is increasing on (a, b). The proof of Parts (ii)–(v) are similar
and are left as an exercise.
Part (vi) Let F(x) = f(x) −g(x) for all x in [a, b]. Then F is continuous on
[a, b] and diﬀerentiable on (a, b). Furthermore, F ′(x) = 0 on (a, b). Hence,
by Part (v), there exists some constant C such that for each x in (a, b),
F(x) = C, f(x) −g(x) = c, f(x) = g(x) + C.
This completes the proof of the theorem.
Theorem 4.1.10 (First Derivative Test for Extremum) Let f be continuous
on an open interval (a, b) and a < c < b.
(i) If f ′(x) > 0 on (a, c) and f ′(x) < 0 on (c, b), then f(c) is a local maxi-
mum of f on (a, b).
(ii) If f ′(x) < 0 on (a, c) and f ′(x) > 0 on (c, b), then f(c) is a local minimum
of f on (a, b).
Proof. This theorem follows immediately from Theorem 4.1.9 and its proof
is left as an exercise.
Theorem 4.1.11 (Second Derivative Test for Extremum) Suppose that f, f ′
and f ′′ exist on an open interval (a, b) and a < c < b. Then the following
statements are true:
(i) If f ′(c) = 0 and f ′′(c) > 0, then f(c) is a local minimum of f.
(ii) If f ′(c) = 0 and f ′′(c) < 0, then f(c) is a local maximum of f.

4.1. MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS
153
(iii) If f ′(c) = 0 and f ′′(c) = 0, then f(c) may or may not be a local extremum.
Proof.
Part (i) If f ′′(c) > 0, then by Theorem 4.1.2, there exists some δ > 0 such
that for all x in (c −δ, c + δ),
f ′(c)
x −c = f ′(x) −f ′(c)
x −c
> 0.
Hence, f ′(x) > 0 on (c, c + δ) and f ′(x) < 0 on (c −δ, c).
By the ﬁrst
derivative test, f(c) is a local minimum of f.
Part (ii) The proof of Part (ii) is similar to Part (i) and is left as an exercise.
Part (iii) Let f(x) = x3 and g(x) = x4. Then
f ′(0) = g′(0) = f ′′(0) = g′′(0).
However, f has no local extremum at 0 but g has a local maximum at 0.
This completes the proof of this theorem.
Deﬁnition 4.1.5 (Concavity) Suppose that f is deﬁned in some open inter-
val (a, b) containing c and f ′(c) exists. Let
y = g(x) = f ′(c)(x −c) + f(c)
be the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f at c.
(i) If there exists δ > 0 such that f(x) > g(x) for all x in (c−δ, c+δ), x ̸= c,
then the graph of f is said to be concave upward at c. If the graph of f is
concave upward at every c in (a, b), then it is said to be concave upward
on (a, b).
(ii) If there exists δ > 0 such that f(x) < g(x) for all x in (c−δ, c+δ), x ̸= c,
then the graph of f is said to be concave downward at c. If the graph of
f is concave downward at every c in (a, b), then it is said to be concave
downward on (a, b).
(iii) The point (c, f(c)) is said to be a point of inﬂection if there exists some
δ > 0 such that either

CHAPTER 4. APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
(i) the graph of f is concave upward on (c−δ, c) and concave downward
on (c, c + δ), or
(ii) the graph of f is concave downward on (c−δ, c) and concave upward
on (c, c + δ).
Remark 13 The ﬁrst derivative test, second derivative test and concavity
test are very useful in graphing functions.

Antidiﬀerentiation
The process of ﬁnding a function g(x) such that g(x) = f(x), for a given
f(x), is called antidiﬀerentiation.
Deﬁnition 4.2.1 Let f and g be two continuous functions deﬁned on an
open interval (a, b). If g′(x) = f(x) for each x in (a, b), then g is called an
antiderivative of f on (a, b).

158
CHAPTER 4. APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Theorem 4.2.1 If g1(x) and g2(x) are any two antiderivatives of f(x) on
(a, b), then there exists some constant C such that
g1(x) = g2(x) + C.
Proof. If h(x) = g1(x) −g2(x), then
h′(x) = g′
1(x) −g′
2(x)
= f(x) −f(x)
= 0
for all x in (a, b). By Theorem 4.1.9, Part (iv), there exists some constant c
such that for all x in (a, b),
C = h(x) = g1(x) −g2(x)
g2(x) = g1(x) + C.
Deﬁnition 4.2.2 If g(x) is an antiderivative of f on (a, b), then the set
{g(x)+C : C is a constant} is called a one-parameter family of antiderivatives
of f. We called this one-parameter family of antiderivatives the indeﬁnite
integral of f(x) on (a, b) and write
Z
f(x)dx = g(x) + C.
The expression “
R
f(x)dx” is read as “the indeﬁnite integral of f(x) with
respect to x.” The function “f(x)” is called the integrand, “
R
” is called the
integral sign and “x” is called the variable of integration. When dealing with
indeﬁnite integrals, we often use the terms antidiﬀerentiation and integration
interchangeably. By deﬁnition, we observe that

Linear First Order Diﬀerential Equations
Deﬁnition 4.3.1 If p(x) and q(x) are deﬁned on some open interval, then
an equation of the form
dy
dx + p(x)y = q(x)
is called a linear ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation in the variable y.
Example 4.3.1 (Exponential Growth). A model for exponential growth is
the ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation
dy
dx = ky, k > 0, y(0) = y0.
To solve this equation we divide by y, integrate both sides with respect to x,

4.3. LINEAR FIRST ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
165
Next, we impose the condition y(0) = y0 to get
y(0) = ±ec = y0
y = y0ekx .
The number y0 is the value of y at x = 0. If the variable x is replaced by the
time variable t, we get
y(t) = y(0)ekt.
If k > 0, this is an exponential growth model. If k < 0, this is an example of
an exponential decay model.
Theorem 4.3.1 (Linear First Order Diﬀerential Equations) If p(x) and q(x)

Equation (5) gives a one-parameter family of solutions to the equation. To
pick a particular member of the family, we specify either a point on the curve,
or the slope at a point of the curve. That is,
y(0) = y0
or
y′(0) = y′

Then c is uniquely determined. This completes the proof.

Deﬁnition 4.4.1 A linear second order diﬀerential equation in the variable
y is an equation of the form
y′′ + p(x)y′ + q(x)y = r(x).
If r(x) = 0, we say that the equation is homogeneous; otherwise it is called
non-homogeneous. If p(x) and q(x) are constants, we say that the equation
has constant coeﬃcients.
Deﬁnition 4.4.2 If f and g are diﬀerentiable functions, then the Wronskian
of f and g is denoted W(f, g) and deﬁned by
W(f, g) = f(x)g′(x) −f ′(x)g(x).
Example 4.4.1 Compute the following Wronskians:

(i) W(sin(mx), cos(mx))
(ii) W(epx sin(qx), epx cos(qx))
(iii) W(xn, xm)
(iv) W(x sin(mx), x cos(mx))
Part (i)
W(sin mx, cos mx) = sin(mx) d
dx (cos(mx)) −d
dx (sin(mx)) cos(mx)
= −m sin2(mx) −m cos2(mx)
= −m(sin2(mx) + cos2(mx))

= epx sin qx(pepx cos qx −qepx sin qx)
−epx cos qx(pepx sin qx + qepx cos qx)
= −qe2px(sin2 qx + cos2 qx)
= −qe2px.
Part (iii) W(xn, xm) = xn · mxm−1 −xm · nxn−1
= (m −n)xn+m−1.
Part (iv) W(x sin mx, x cos mx) = (x sin mx)(cos mx −mx sin mx)
−(x cos mx)(sin mx + mx cos mx)
= −mx2(sin2 mx + cos2 mx)
= −mx2.
Deﬁnition 4.4.3 Two diﬀerentiable functions f and g are said to be linearly
independent if their Wronskian, W(f(x), g(x)), is not zero for all x in the
domains of both f and g.
Example 4.4.2 Which pairs of functions in Example 8 are linearly indepen-
dent?
(i) In Part (i), W(sin mx, cos mx) = −m ̸= 0 unless m = 0. Therefore,
sin mx and cos mx are linearly independent if m ̸= 0.
(ii) In Part (ii),
W(epx sin qx, epx cos qx) = −qe2px ̸≡if q ̸= 0.
Therefore, epx sin(qx) and epx cos qx are linearly independent if q ̸= 0.

4.4. LINEAR SECOND ORDER HOMOGENEOUS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS171
(iii) In Part (iii), W(xn, xm) = (m −n)xn+m−1 ̸≡0 if m ̸= n. Therefore, if m
and n are not equal, then xn and xm are linearly independent.
(iv) In Part (iv),
W(x sin mx, x cos mx) = −mx2 ̸≡0
if m ̸= 0. Therefore, x sin mx and x cos mx are linearly independent if
m ̸= 0.
Theorem 4.4.1 Consider the linear homogeneous second order diﬀerential
equation
y′′ + p(x)y′ + q(x)y = 0.
(1)
(i) If y1(x) and y2(x) are any two solutions of (1), then every linear combi-
nation y(x), with constants A and B,
y(x) = Ay1(x) + By2(x)
is also a solution of (1).
(ii) If y1(x) and y2(x) are any two linearly independent solutions of (1), then
every solution y(x) of (1) has the form
y(x) = Ay1(x) + By2(x)
for some constants A and B.
Proof.
Part (i) Suppose that y1 and y2 are solutions of (1), A and B are any con-
stants. Then
(Ay1 + By2)′′ + p(Ay1 + By2)′ + q(Ay1 + By2)

2 + py′
2 + qy2)
= A(0) + B(0)
(Because y1 and y2 are solutions of (1))

Hence, y = Ay1 + By2 are solutions of (1) whenever y1 and y2 are solutions
of (1).

Since y1 and y2 are linearly independent, W(y1, y2) ̸= 0, and hence, A and B
are uniquely determined.
Remark 15 It turns out that the Wronskian of two solutions of (1) is either
identically zero or never zero for any value of x.
Theorem 4.4.2 Let y1 and y2 be any two solutions of the homogeneous equa-
tion

Let

for some constant c. If c = 0, then W(x) = 0 for every x. If c ̸= 0, then

(Homogeneous Second Order) Consider the linear second
order homogeneous diﬀerential equation with constant coeﬃcients:
ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0,
a ̸= 0.
(1)
(i) If y = emx is a solution of (1), then
am2 + bm + c = 0.
(2)
Equation (2) is called the characteristic equation of (1).
(ii) Let m1 = −b −

and m2 = −b +
√
b2 −4ac

. Then the follow-
ing three cases arise:
Case 1. The discriminant b2 −4ac > 0. Then m1 and m2 are real and
distinct. The two linearly independent solutions of (1) are em1x and
em2x and its general solution has the form
y(x) = Aem1x + Bem2x.

174
CHAPTER 4. APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
Case 2. The discriminant b2 −4ac = 0. Then m1 = m2 = m, and only
one real solution exists for equation (2). The roots are repeated. In
this case, emx and xemx are two linearly independent solutions of (1)
and the general solution of (1) has the form
y(x) = Aemx + Bxemx = emx(A + Bx).
Case 3 b2 −4ac < 0. Then m1 = p −iq, and m2 = p + iq where p =
−b/2a, and q =
√
4ac −b2/2a. In this case, the functions epx sin qx
and epx cos qx are two linearly independent solutions of (1) and the
most general solution of (1) has the form
y(x) = epx(A sin qx + B sin qx).
Proof. Let y = emx. Then y′ = memx, y′′ = m2emx and
ay′′ + by′ + cy = (am2 + bm + c)emx = 0, a ̸= 0 ↔
am2 + bm + c = 0, a ̸= 0 ↔
m = −b
2a ±

.
This proves Part (i).
Case 1. For Case 1, em1x and em2x are solutions of (1). We show that these
are linearly independent by showing that their Wronskian is not zero.
W(em1x, em2x) = em1x · m2em2x −m1em1x · em2x
= (m2 −m1)e(m1+m2)x.
Since m1 ̸= m2, W(em1x, em2x) ̸= 0.
Case 2. We already know that emx ̸= 0, and m = −b/2a.
Let us try
y = xemx. Then
ay′′ + by′ + cy = a(2m + m2x)emx + b(1 + mx)emx + xemx
= (b + 2am)emx + (am2 + bm + c)xemx
= (b + 2a(−b/2a))emx
= 0.

4.4. LINEAR SECOND ORDER HOMOGENEOUS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS175
Therefore, emx and xemx are both solutions. We only need to show that
they are linearly independent.
W(emx, xemx) = emx(emx + mxemx) −memx(xemx)
= e2mx + mxe2mx −mxe2mx
= e2mx
̸= 0.
Hence, emx and xemx are linearly independent and the general solution
of (1) has the form
y(x) = Aemx + Bxemx = emx(A + Bx).
Case 3. In Example 8, we showed that
W(epx sin qx, epx cos qx) = −qe2px ̸= 0
since q ̸= 0.
We only need to show that epx sin qx and epx cos qx are solutions of (1).
Let y1 = epx sin qx and y2 = epx cos qx. Then,
y′

Therefore y1 = epx sin(qx) is a solution of (1). Similarly, we can show

Remark 16 Use Integral Tables or computer algebra in evaluating the in-

Example 4.4.3 Solve the diﬀerential equations for y(t).
(i) y′′ −5y′ + 14y = 0
(ii) y′′ −6y′ + 9y = 0
(iii) y′′ −4y′ + 5y = 0
We let y = emt. We then solve for m and determine the solution. We observe
that y′ = memt, y′′ = m2emt.
Part (i) By substituting y = emt in the equation we get
m2emt −5memt + 14emt = emt(m2 −5m + 14) = 0 →
m2 −5m + 14 = 0 = (m −7)(m + 2) →m = 7, −2.
Therefore,
y(t) = Ae−2t + Be7t.
Part (ii) Again, by substituting y = emt, we get
m2emt −6memt + 9emt = 0
m2 −6m + 9 = (m −3)2 = 0
m = 3, 3.
The solution is
y(t) = Ae3t + Bte3t.
Part (iii) By substituting y = emt, we get

the conditions
y′′(t) −2y′(t) −15y(t) = 0; y(0) = 1, y′(0) = −1.
We assume that y(t) = emt. By substitution we get the characteristic equa-
tion:
m2 −2m −15 = 0, m = 5, −3.
The general solution is
y(t) = Ae−3t + Be5t.
We now impose the additional conditions y(0) = 1, y′(0) = −1.
y(t) = Ae−3t + Be5t
y′(t) = −3Ae−3t + 5Be5t
y(0) = A + B = 1

Proof. It is already shown that c1y1(x)+c2y2(x) is the most general solution
of the homogeneous equation (2), where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
We observe that the diﬀerence of any two solutions of (1) is a solution of (2).
Suppose that y∗(x) is any solution of (1). We wish to ﬁnd two functions,
u1 and u2, such that
y∗(x) = u1(x)y1(x) + u2(x)y2(x).

We impose the following condition (5) on u1 and u2:

(7)
The denominator of the solution (7) is the Wronskian of y1 and y2, which is
not zero for any x since y1 and y2 are linearly independent by assumption.
By taking the indeﬁnite integrals in equation (7), we obtain u1 and u2.
u1(x) = −
Z y2(x)r(x)
W(y1, y2) dx
and
u2(x) =
Z y1(x)r(x)
W(y1, y2) dx.
By substituting these values in (3), we get a particular solution
y∗(x) = y2u2 + y1u1
= y2(x)
Z y1(x)r(x)
W(y1, y2) dx −y1(x)
Z y2(x)r(x)
W(y1, y2) dx.
This solution y∗(x) is called a particular solution of (1). To get the general
solution of (1), we add the general solution c1y1(x) + c2 y2(x) of (2) to the
particular solution of y∗(x) and get
y(x) = (c1y1(x) + c2y2(x)) +

.
This completes the proof of this theorem.
Remark 17 The general solution of (2) is called the complementary solution
of (1) and is denoted yc(x).
yc(x) = c1y1(x) + c2y2(x).
The particular solution y∗of (1) is generally written as yp.
yp = y2
Z r(x)y1(x)
W(y1, y2) dx −y1
Z r(x)y2(x)
W(y1, y2) dx.
The general solution y(x) of (1) is the sum of yc and yp,
y = yc(x) + yp(x).

4.5. LINEAR NON-HOMOGENEOUS SECOND ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS181
Example 4.5.1 Solve the diﬀerential equation
y′′ + 8y′ + 12y = e−3x.
We ﬁnd the general solution of the homogeneous equation
y′′ + 8y′ + 12y = 0.
We let y = emx be a solution. Then y′ = memx, y′′ = m2emx and
m2emx + 8memx + 12emx = 0
m2 + 8m + 12 = 0
m = −6, −2.
So,
yc(x) = Ae−6x + Be−2x
is the complementary solution. We compute the Wronskian
W(e−6x, e−2x) = e−6x(−2)e−2x −e−2x(−6)e−6x
= e−8x(−2 + 6)
= 4e−8x

By Theorem 4.4.1, the particular solution is given by

The Deﬁnite Integral
5.1
Area Approximation
In Chapter 4, we have seen the role played by the indeﬁnite integral in ﬁnd-
ing antiderivatives and in solving ﬁrst order and second order diﬀerential
equations. The deﬁnite integral is very closely related to the indeﬁnite inte-
gral. We begin the discussion with ﬁnding areas under the graphs of positive
functions.
Example 5.1.1 Find the area bounded by the graph of the function y =
4, y = 0, x = 0, x = 3.
graph
From geometry, we know that the area is the height 4 times the width 3 of
the rectangle.
Area = 12.
Example 5.1.2 Find the area bounded by the graphs of y = 4x, y = 0, x =
0, x = 3.
183

184
CHAPTER 5. THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
graph
From geometry, the area of the triangle is 1
2 times the base, 3, times the
height, 12.
Area = 18.
Example 5.1.3 Find the area bounded by the graphs of y = 2x, y = 0, x =
1, x = 4.
graph
The required area is covered by a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is 1
2
times the sum of the parallel sides times the distance between the parallel
sides.
Area = 1
2 (2 + 8)(3) = 15.
Example 5.1.4 Find the area bounded by the curves y =
√
4 −x2, y =
0, x = −2, x = 2.
graph
By inspection, we recognize that this is the area bounded by the upper half
of the circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 2. Its equation is
x2 + y2 = 4
or
y =
√
4 −x2, −2 ≤x ≤2.
Again from geometry, we know that the area of a circle with radius 2 is
πr2 = 4π. The upper half of the circle will have one half of the total area.
Therefore, the required area is 2π.

5.1. AREA APPROXIMATION
185
Example 5.1.5 Approximate the area bounded by y = x2, y = 0, x = 0,
and x = 3.
Given that the exact area is 9, compute the error of your
approximation.
Method 1. We divide the interval [0, 3] into six equal subdivisions at the
points 0, 1
2, 1, 3
2, 5
2 and 2. Such a subdivision is called a partition of [0, 3].
We draw vertical segments joining these points of division to the curve. On
each subinterval [x1, x2], the minimum value of the function x2 is at x2
1.
The maximum value x2
2 of the function is at the right hand end point x2.
Therefore,

Method 2. (Trapezoidal Rule) In this method, for each subinterval [x1, x2],
we join the point (x1, x2
1) with the point (x2, x2
2) by a straight line and ﬁnd
the area under this line to be a trapezoid with area 1

Let f be a function that is continuous on a bounded and closed interval [a, b].
Let p = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < . . . < xn = b} be a partition of [a, b], not
necessarily equally spaced. Let
mi = min{f(x) : xi−1 ≤x ≤xi}, i = 1, 2, . . . , n;
Mi = max{f(x) : xi−1 ≤x ≤xi}, i = 1, 2, . . . , n;
∆xi = xi −xi−1, i = 1, 2, . . . , n;
∆= max{∆xi : i = 1, 2, . . . , n};
L(p) = m1∆x1 + m2∆x2 + . . . + mn∆xn
U(p) = M1∆xi + M2∆x2 + . . . + Mn∆xn.
We call L(p) the lower Riemann sum. We call U(p) the upper Riemann
sum. Clearly L(p) ≤U(p), for every partition. Let
Lf = lub{L(p) : p is a partition of [a, b]}
Uf = glb{U(p) : p is a partition of [a, b]}.

(iii) I is expressed, in symbols, by the equation

the “lower limit”; the number “b” is called the “upper limit”; the func-
tion “f(x)” is called the “integrand”; and the variable “x” is called the
(dummy) “variable of integration.”
(v) If f(x) ≥0 for each x in [a, b], then the area, A, bounded by the curves
y = f(x), y = 0, x = a and x = b, is deﬁned to be the deﬁnite integral
of f(x) from x = a to x = b. That is,
A =

g(c2) = absolute minimum of f on [xi−1, xi],
f(c3) + g(c3) = absolute minimum of f + g on [xi−1, xi],
f(d1) = absolute maximum of f on [xi−1, xi],
g(d2) = absolute maximum of g on [xi−1, xi],
f(d3) + g(d3) = absolute maximum of f + g on [xi−1, xi].
It follows that
f(c1) + g(c2) ≤f(c3) + g(c3) ≤f(d3) + g(d3) ≤f(d1) + g(d2)
Consequently,
Lf + Lg ≤L(f+g) ≤U(f+g) ≤Uf + Ug
(Why?)
Since f and g are integrable,
Lf = Uf =
Z b
a
f(x)dx;
Lg = Ug =

By the squeeze principle,
L(f+g) = U(f+g) =

This completes the proof of Part (i) of this theorem.
Part (iii) Let k be a positive constant and let F be a function that is con-
tinuous on [a, b]. Let P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xn−1 < xn = b} be
any partition of [a, b]. Then for each i there exist numbers ci and di such
that F(ci) is the absolute minimum of F on [xi−1, xi] and F(di) is absolute
maximum of F on [xi−1, xi]. Since k is a positive constant,
kF(ci) = absolute minimum of kF on [xi−1, xi],
kF(di) = absolute maximum of kF on [xi−1, xi],
−kF(di) = absolute minimum of (−k)F on [xi−1, xi],
−kF(ci) = absolute maximum of (−k)F on [xi−1, xi].
Then
L(P) = F(c1)∆x1 + F(c2)∆x2 + · · · + F(cn)∆xn,
U(P) = F(d1)∆x1 + F(d2)∆x2 + · · · + F(dn)∆xn,
kL(P) = (kF)(c1)∆x1 + (kF)(c2)∆x2 + · · · + (kF)(cn)∆xn,
kU(P) = (kF)(d1)∆x1 + (kF)(d2)∆x2 + · · · + (kF)(dn)∆xn,
−kU(P) = (−kF)(d1)∆x1 + (−kF)(d2)∆x2 + · · · + (−kF)(dn)∆xn,
−kL(P) = (−kF)(c1)∆x1 + (−kF)(c2)∆x2 + · · · + (−kF)(cn)∆xn.
Since F is continuous, kF and (−k)F are both continuous and
Lf = Up =

L(kF) = U(kF) = k(LF) = k(UF) = k

Theorem 5.2.3
(Additivity)
If f is continuous on [a, b] and a < c < b,
then
Z b
a
f(x)dx =
Z c
a
f(x)dx +
Z b
c
f(x)dx.
Proof.
Suppose that f is continuous on [a, b] and a < c < b. Then f is
continuous on [a, c] and on [c, b] and, hence, f is integrable on [a, b], [a, c]
and [c, b].
Let P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · xn = b}.
Suppose that
xi−1 ≤c ≤xi for some i. Let P1 = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xi−1 ≤c}
and P2 = {c ≤xi < xi+1 < · · · < xn = b}. Then there exist numbers
c1, c2, c3, d1, d2, and d3 such that
f(c1) = absolute minimum of f on [xi−1, c],
f(d1) = absolute maximum of f on [xi−1, c],
f(c2) = absolute minimum of f on [c, xi],
f(d2) = absolute maximum of f on [c, xi],
f(c3) = absolute minimum of f on [xi−1, xi],
f(d3) = absolute maximum of f on [xi−1, xi],
Also,
f(c3) ≤f(c1), f(c3) ≤f(c2), f(d1) ≤f(d3)
and
f(d2) ≤f(d3).
It follows that
L(P) ≤L(P1) + L(P2) ≤U(P1) + U(P2) ≤U(P).
It follows that

This completes the proof of the theorem.

Theorem 5.2.4
(Order Property) If f and g are continuous on [a, b] and
f(x) ≤g(x) for all x in [a, b], then
Z b
a
f(x)dx ≤
Z b
a
g(x)dx.
Proof.
Suppose that f and g are continuous on [a, b] and f(x) ≤g(x) for
all x in [a, b]. Let P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xn = b} be a partition of
[a, b]. For each i there exists numbers ci, c∗
i , di and d∗
i such that
f(ci) = absolute minimum of f on [xi−1, xi],
f(di) = absolute maximum of f on [xi−1, xi],
g(c∗
i ) = absolute minimum of g on [xi−1, xi],
g(d∗
i ) = absolute maximum of g on [xi−1, xi].
By the assumption that f(x) ≤g(x) on [a, b], we get
f(ci) ≤g(c∗
i )
and
f(di) ≤g(d∗
i ).
Hence
Lf ≤Lg
and
Uf ≤Ug.
It follows that
Z b
a
f(x)dx ≤
Z b

g(x)dx.
This completes the proof of this theorem.
Theorem 5.2.5
(Mean Value Theorem for Integrals)
If f is continuous
on [a, b], then there exists some point c in [a, b] such that
Z b
a
f(x)dx = f(c)(b −a).
Proof. Suppose that f is continuous on [a, b], and a < b. Let
m = absolute minimum of f on [a, b], and
M = absolute maximum of f on [a, b].
Then, by Theorem 5.2.4,
m(b −a) ≤

By the intermediate value theorem for continuous functions, there exists some
c such that

Z b

f(x)dx
and
Z b
a
f(x)dx = f(c)(b −a).
For a = b, take c = a. This completes the proof of this theorem.
Deﬁnition 5.2.2 The number f(c) given in Theorem 5.2.6 is called the av-
erage value of f on [a, b], denoted fav[a, b]. That is
fav[a, b] =

Theorem 5.2.6
(Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, First Form) Suppose
that f is continuous on some closed and bounded interval [a, b] and
g(x) =
Z x
a
f(t)dt
for each x in [a, b]. Then g(x) is continuous on [a, b], diﬀerentiable on (a, b)
and for all x in (a, b), g′(x) = f(x). That is

for some c between x and x + h.
Since f is continuous on [a, b] and c is between x and x + h, it follows
that
g′(x) = lim
h→0 f(c) = f(x)
for all x such that a < x < b.
At the end points a and b, a similar argument can be used for one sided
derivatives, namely,
g′(a+) = lim
h→0+
g(x + h) −g(x)

g′(b−) = lim

We leave the end points as an exercise. This completes the proof of this
theorem.
Theorem 5.2.7
(Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Second Form) If f
and g are continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b] and g′(x) = f(x)
on [a, b], then
Z b
a
f(x)dx = g(b) −g(a).
We use the notation: [g(x)]b
a = g(b) −g(a).

CHAPTER 5. THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Proof.
Let f and g be continuous on the closed and bounded interval [a, b]
and for each x in [a, b], let
G(x) =
Z x
a
f(t)dt.
Then, by Theorem 5.2.6, G′(x) = f(x) on [a, b]. Since G′(x) = g(x) for all x
on [a, b], there exists some constant C such that
G(x) = g(x) + C
for all x on [a, b]. Since G(a) = 0, we get C = −g(a). Then
Z b
a
f(x)dx = G(b)
= g(b) + C
= g(b) −g(a).
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.2.7.

Integration by Substitution
Many functions are formed by using compositions. In dealing with a com-
posite function it is useful to change variables of integration. It is convenient
to use the following diﬀerential notation:
If u = g(x), then du = g′(x) dx.
The symbol “du” represents the “diﬀerential of u,” namely, g′(x)dx.
Theorem 5.3.1
(Change of Variable) If f, g and g′ are continuous on an
open interval containing [a, b], then
(i)
Z b
a
f(g(x)) · g′(x) dx =
Z g(b)
g(a)
f(u)du
(ii)
Z
f(g(x))g′(x) dx =
Z
f(u)du,
where u = g(x) and du = g′(x) dx.
Proof.
Let f, g, and g′ be continuous on an open interval containing [a, b].
For each x in [a, b], let
F(x) =
Z x
a
f(g(x))g′(x)dx
and
G(x) =
Z g(x)
g(a)
f(u)du.

5.3. INTEGRATION BY SUBSTITUTION
211
Then, by Leibniz Rule, we have
F ′(x) = f(g(x))g′(x),
and
G′(x) = f(g(x))g′(x)
for all x on [a, b].
It follows that there exists some constant C such that
F(x) = G(x) + C
for all x on [a, b]. For x = a we get
0 = F(a) = G(a) + C = 0 + C
and, hence,
C = 0.
Therefore, F(x) = G(x) for all x on [a, b], and hence
Z b
a
f(g(x))g′(x)dx = F(b)
= G(b)
=
Z g(b)
g(a)
f(u)du.
This completes the proof of this theorem.
Remark 18 We say that we have changed the variable from x to u through
the substitution u = g(x).

CHAPTER 5. THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL

Integration by Parts
The product rule of diﬀerentiation yields an integration technique known as
integration by parts. Let us begin with the product rule:
d
dx (u(x)v(x)) = du(x)
dx
v(x) + u(x)dv(x)
dx
.
On integrating each term with respect to x from x = a to x = b, we get
Z b
a
d
dx (u(x)v(x)) dx =
Z b
a
v(x)
du(x)
dx

dx +
Z b
a
u(x)
dv(x)
dx

dx.
By using the diﬀerential notation and the fundamental theorem of calculus,
we get
[u(x)v(x)]b
a =
Z b
a
v(x)u′(x) dx +
Z b
a
u(x)v′(x) dx.
The standard form of this integration by parts formula is written as
(i)
Z b
a
u(x)v′(x) dx = [u(x)v(x)]b
a −
Z b
a
v(x)u′(x) dx
and
(ii)
Z
udv = uv −
Z
vdu
We state this result as the following theorem:
Theorem 5.4.1
(Integration by Parts) If u(x) and v(x) are two functions
that are diﬀerentiable on some open interval containing [a, b], then
(i)
Z b
a
u(x)v′(x) dx = [u(x)v(x)]b
a −
Z b

v(x)u′(x) dx
for deﬁnite integrals and
(ii)
Z
udv = uv −
Z

for indeﬁnite integrals.

5.4. INTEGRATION BY PARTS
217
Proof.
Suppose that u and v are diﬀerentiable on some open interval con-
taining [a, b]. For each x on [a, b], let
F(x) =
Z x
a
u(x)v′(x)dx +
Z x
a
v(x)u′(x)dx.
Then, for each x on [a, b],
F ′(x) = u(x)v′(x) + v(x)u′(x)
= d
dx (u(x)v(x)).
Hence, there exists some constant C such that for each x on [a, b],
F(x) = u(x)v(x) + C.
For x = a, we get
F(a) = 0 = u(a)v(a) + C
and, hence,
C = −u(a)v(a).
Then,
Z b
a
u(x)v′(x)dx +
Z b
a
v(x)u′(x)dx = F(b)
= u(b)v(b) + C
= u(b)v(b) −u(a)v(a).
Consequently,
Z b
a
u(x)v′(x)dx = [u(b)v(b) −u(a)v(a)] −
Z b
a
v(x)u′(x)dx.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.4.1.
Remark 19 The “two parts” of the integrand are “u(x)” and “v′(x)dx” or
“u” and “dv”. It becomes necessary to compute u′(x) and v(x) to make the
integration by parts step.
Example 5.4.1 Evaluate the following integrals:

(i) We let u = x and dv = sin x dx. Then du = dx and
v(x) =
Z

We drop the constant c, since we just need one v(x).
Then, by the

Z

Z
arcsin x dx = x arcsin x −

To evaluate the last integral, we make the substitution y = 1−x2. Then,

(v) Part (v) is similar to part (iv) and is left as an exercise.
(vi) First we let u = x2, du = 2x dx, dv = ex dx, v =
Z
exdx = ex. Then,
Z
x2ex dx = x2ex −
Z
2xex dx

Z
xex dx.
To evaluate the last integral, we let u = x, du = dx, dv = exdx, v = ex.
Then
Z
xex dx = xex −
Z
ex dx
= xex −ex + c.
Therefore,
Z
x2ex dx = x2ex −2(xex −ex + c)

Logarithmic, Exponential and Hyperbolic
Functions
With the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus it is possible to rigorously de-
velop the logarithmic, exponential and hyperbolic functions.

5.5. LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS231
Deﬁnition 5.5.1 For each x > 0 we deﬁne the natural logarithm of x, de-
noted ln x, by the equation
ln(x) =
Z x
1
1
t dt
,
x > 0.
Theorem 5.5.1
(Natural Logarithm) The natural logarithm, ln x, has the
following properties:
(i)
d
dx (ln x) = 1
x > 0 for all x > 0.
The natural logarithm is an increasing, continuous and diﬀerentiable
function on (0, ∞).
(ii) If a > 0 and b > 0, then ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b).
(iii) If a > 0 and b > 0, then ln(a/b) = ln(a) + ln(b).
(iv) If a > 0 and n is a natural number, then ln(an) = n ln a.
(v) The range of ln x is (−∞, ∞).
(vi) ln x is one-to-one and has a unique inverse, denoted ex.
Proof.
(i) Since 1/t is continuous on (0, ∞), (i) follows from the Fundamental The-
orem of Calculus, Second Form.
(ii) Suppose that a > 0 and b > 0. Then
ln(ab) =

5.5. LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS233
Hence, ln 4 > 1. ln(4n) = n ln 4 > n and ln 4−n = −n ln 4 < −n. By
the intermediate value theorem, every interval (−n, n) is contained in
the range of ln x. Therefore, the range of ln x is (−∞, ∞), since the
derivative of ln x is always positive, ln x is increasing and hence one-to-
one. The inverse of ln x exists.
(vi) Let e denote the number such that ln(e) = 1. Then we deﬁne y = ex if
and only if x = ln(y) for x ∈(−∞, ∞), y > 0.
This completes the proof.
Deﬁnition 5.5.2 If x is any real number, we deﬁne y = ex if and only if
x = ln y.
Theorem 5.5.2
(Exponential Function) The function y = ex has the fol-
lowing properties:
(i) e0 = 1, ln(ex) = x for every real x and d
dx (ex) = ex.
(ii) ea · eb = ea+b for all real numbers a and b.
(iii) ea
eb = ea−b for all real numbers a and b.
(iv) (ea)n = ena for all real numbers a and natural numbers n.
Proof.
(i) Since ln(1) = 0, e0 = 1. By deﬁnition y = ex if and only if x = ln(y) =
ln(ex). Suppose y = ex. Then x = ln y. By implicit diﬀerentiation, we
get
1 = 1
y
dy
dx, dy
dx = y = ex.
Therefore,
d
dx (ex) = ex.

234
CHAPTER 5. THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
(ii) Since ln x is increasing and, hence, one-to-one,
ea · eb = ea+b ↔
ln(ea · eb) = ln(ea+b) ↔
ln(ea) + ln(eb) = a + b ↔
a + b = a + b.
It follows that for all real numbers a and b,
ea · eb = ea+b.
(iii)
ea
eb = ea−b ↔
ln
ea

ln(ea) −ln(eb) = a −b ↔
a −b = a −b.
It follows that for all real numbers a and b,
ea
eb = ea−b.
(iv)
(ea)n = ena ↔
ln((ea)n) = ln(ena) ↔
n ln(ea) = na ↔
na = na.
Therefore, for all real numbers a and natural numbers n, we have
(ea)n = ena.

5.5. LOGARITHMIC, EXPONENTIAL AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS235
Deﬁnition 5.5.3 Suppose b > 0 and b ̸= 1. Then we deﬁne the following:
(i) For each real number x, bx = ex ln b.
(ii) y = logb x = ln x
ln b .
Theorem 5.5.3 (General Exponential Function) Suppose b > 0 and b ̸= 1.
Then
(i) ln(bx) = x ln b, for all real numbers x.
(ii)
d

(iii) bx1 · bx2 = bx1+x2, for all real numbers x1 and x2.

(v) (bx1)x2 = bx1x2, for all real numbers x1 and x2.

(by the chain rule)

= ex2 ln(ex1 ln b)
= ex2·x1 ln b
= e(x1x2) ln b

we get
Z
bx(ln b) dx = bx + c,
ln b
Z
bx dx = bx + c,
Z
ex dx = bx
ln b + D,
where D is some constant. This completes the proof.
Theorem 5.5.4 If u(x) > 0 for all x, and u(x) and v(x) are diﬀerentiable
functions, then we deﬁne
y = (u(x))v(x) = ev(x) ln(u(x)).

The Riemann Integral
In deﬁning the deﬁnite integral, we restricted the deﬁnition to continuous
functions. However, the deﬁnite integral as deﬁned for continuous functions
is a special case of the general Riemann Integral deﬁned for bounded functions
that are not necessarily continuous.

5.6. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL
243
Deﬁnition 5.6.1 Let f be a function that is deﬁned and bounded on a
closed and bounded interval [a, b]. Let P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · <
xn = b} be a partition of [a, b]. Let C = {ci : xi−1 ≤ci ≤xi, i = 1, 2, · · · , n}
be any arbitrary selection of points of [a, b]. Then the Riemann Sum that is
associated with P and C is denoted R(P) and is deﬁned by
R(P) = f(c1)(x1 −x0) + f(c2)(x2 −x1) + · · · + f(cn)(xn + xn−1)
=
n
X
i=1
f(ci)(xi −xi−1).
Let ∆xi = xi −xi−1, i = 1, 2, · · · , n. Let ||∆|| = max
1≤i≤n{∆xi}. We write
R(P) =
n
X
i=1
f(ci)∆xi.
We say that
lim
||∆||→0
n
X
i=1
f(ci)∆xi = I
if and only if for each ϵ > 0 there exists some δ > 0 such that

n
X
i=1
f(ci)∆xi −I
 < ϵ
whenever ||∆|| < δ for all partitions P and all selections C that deﬁne the
Riemann Sum.
If the limit I exists as a ﬁnite number, we say that f is (Riemann) inte-
grable and write
I =
Z b
a
f(x) dx.
Next we will show that if f is continuous, the Riemann integral of f is
the deﬁnite integral deﬁned by lower and upper sums and it exists. We ﬁrst
prove two results that are important.
Deﬁnition 5.6.2 A function f is said to be uniformly continuous on its
domain D if for each ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if |x1 −x2| < δ, for
any x1 and x2 in D, then
|f(x1) −f(x2)| < ϵ.

244
CHAPTER 5. THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Deﬁnition 5.6.3 A collection C = {Uα : Uα is an open interval} is said to
cover a set D if each element of D belongs to some element of C.
Theorem 5.6.1 If C = {Uα : Uα is an open interval} covers a closed and
bounded interval [a, b], then there exists a ﬁnite subcollection B = {Uα1, Uα2, · · · , Uαn}
of C that covers [a, b].
Proof. We deﬁne a set A as follows:
A = {x : x ∈[a, b] and [a, x] can be covered by a ﬁnite subcollection of C}.
Since a ∈A, A is not empty. A is bounded from above by b. Then A has a
least upper bound, say lub(A) = p. Clearly, p ≤b. If p < b, then some Uα
in C contains p. If Uα = (aα, bα), then aα < p < bα. Since p = ℓub(A), there
exists some point a∗of A between aα and p. There exists a subcollection
B = {Uα1, · · · , Uαn} that covers [a, a∗]. Then the collection
B1 = {Uα1, · · · , Uαn, Uα} covers [a, bα). By the deﬁnition of A, A must
contain all points of [a, b] between p and bα. This contradicts the assump-
tion that p = ℓub(A). So, p = b and b ∈A. It follows that some ﬁnite
subcollection of C covers [a, b] as required.
Theorem 5.6.2 If f is continuous on a closed and bounded interval [a, b],
then f is uniformly continuous on [a, b].
Proof.
Let ϵ > 0 be given. If p ∈[a, b], then there exists δp > 0 such
that |f(x) −f(p)| < ϵ/3, whenever p −δp < x < p + δp.
Let Up =

p −1
3 δp, p + 1
3 δp

. Then C = {Up : p ∈[a, b]} covers [a, b]. By The-
orem 5.6.1, some ﬁnite subcollection B = {Up1, Up2, . . . , Upn} of C covers
[a, b]. Let δ = 1
3 min{δpi : i = 1, 2, · · · , n}. Suppose that |x1 −x2| < δ for
any two points x1 and x2 of [a, b]. Then x1 ∈Upi and x2 ∈Upj for some pi
and pj. We note that
|pi −pj| = |(pi −x1) + (x1 −x2) + (x2 −pj)|
≤|pi −xi| + |x1 −x2| + |x2 −pj|
< 1
3 δpi + δ + 1
3 δpj
≤max{δpi, δpj}.

5.6. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL
245
It follows that both pi and pj are either in Upi or Upj. Suppose that pi and
pj are both in Upi. Then
|x2 −pi| = |(x2 −x1)| + (x1 −pi)|
≤|x2 −x1| + |x1 −pi|
< δ + 1
3 δpi
< δpi.
So, x1, x2, pi and pj are all in Upi. Then
|f(x1) −f(x2)| = |(f(x1) −f(pi)) + (f(pi) −f(x2))|
≤|f(x1) −f(pi)| + |f(pi) −f(x2)|
< ϵ
3 + ϵ

< ϵ.
By Deﬁnition 5.6.2, f is uniformly continuous on [a, b].
Theorem 5.6.3 If f is continuous on [a, b], then f is (Riemann) integrable
and the deﬁnite integral and the Riemann integral have the same value.
Proof.
Let P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < . . . < xn = b} be a partition of [a, b]
and C = {ci : xi−1 ≤ci ≤xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n} be an arbitrary selection. For
each i = 1, 2, . . . , n let
mi = absolute minimum of f on [xi−1, xi] obtained at c∗
i , f(c∗
i ) = mi;
Mi = absolute maximum of f on [xi−1, xi] obtained at c∗∗
i ) = Mi;
m = absolute minimum of f on [a, b];
M = absolute maximum of f on [a, b];
R(P) =

Then for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n, we have

We note that L(P) and U(P) are also Riemann sums and for every partition
P, we have
L(P) ≤R(P) ≤U(P).
To prove the theorem, it is suﬃcient to show that
lub{L(P)} = glb{U(P)}.
Since f is uniformly continuous, by Theorem 5.6.2, for each ϵ > 0 there is
some δ > 0 such that |f(x)−f(y)| <
ϵ
b −a whenever |x−y| < δ for x and y in
[a, b]. Consider all partitions P, selections C = {ci}, C∗= {c∗
i }, C∗∗= {c∗∗

such that
||∆|| = max
1≤i≤n(xi −xi−1) < δ
3.
Then, for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n
|f(c∗∗

|f(c∗

It follows that

5.6. THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL

By deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral, I equals the deﬁnite integral of f(x)
from x = a to x = b, which is also the Riemann integral of f on [a, b]. We
write
I =
Z b
a
f(x) dx.
This proves Theorem 5.6.2 as well as Theorem 5.2.1.

5.7
Volumes of Revolution
One simple application of the Riemann integral is to deﬁne the volume of a
solid.
Theorem 5.7.1 Suppose that a solid is bounded by the planes with equations
x = a and x = b. Let the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the x-axis at
x be given by a continuous function A(x). Then the volume V of the solid is
given by
V =
Z b
a
A(x) dx.

5.7. VOLUMES OF REVOLUTION
251
Proof.
Let P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xn = b} be a partition of [a, b].
For each i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n, let
Vi = volume of the solid between the planes with equations x = xi−1 and
x = xi,
mi = absolute minimum of A(x) on [xi−1, xi],
Mi = absolute maximum of A(x) on [xi−1, xi],
∆xi = xi −xi−1.
Then
mi∆xi ≤Vi ≤Mi∆xi, mi ≤Vi
∆xi
≤Mi.
Since A(x) is continuous, there exists some ci such that xi−1 ≤ci ≤Mi and
mi ≤A(ci) = Vi
∆xi
≤Mi
Vi = A(ci)∆xi
V =
n
X
i=1
A(ci)∆xi.
It follows that for each partition P of [a, b] there exists a Riemann sum that
equals the volume. Hence, by deﬁnition,
V =
Z b
a
A(x) dx.
Theorem 5.7.2 Let f be a function that is continuous on [a, b].
Let R
denote the region bounded by the curves x = a, x = b, y = 0 and y = f(x).
Then the volume V obtained by rotating R about the x-axis is given by
V =
Z b
a
π(f(x))2dx.
Proof.
Clearly, the volume of the rotated solid is between the planes with
equations x = a and x = b.
The cross-sectional area at x is the circle
generated by the line segment joining (x, 0) and (x, f(x)) and has area A(x) =
π(f(x))2. Since f is continuous, A(x) is a continuous function of x. Then by
Theorem 5.7.1, the volume V is given by
V =
Z b
a
π(f(x))2 dx.

252
CHAPTER 5. THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
Theorem 5.7.3 Let f and R be deﬁned as in Theorem 5.7.2. Assume that
f(x) > 0 for all x ∈[a, b], either a ≥0 or b ≤0, so that [a, b] does not
contain 0. Then the volume V generated by rotating the region R about the
y-axis is given by
V =
Z b
a
(2πxf(x)) dx.
Proof.
The line segment joining (x, 0) and (x, f(x)) generates a cylinder
whose area is A(x) = 2πxf(x).
We can see this if we cut the cylinder
vertically at (−x, 0) and ﬂattening it out. By Theorem 5.7.1, we get
V =
Z b
a
2πxf(x) dx.
Theorem 5.7.4 Let f and g be continuous on [a, b] and suppose that f(x) >
g(x) > 0 for all x on [a, b].
Let R be the region bounded by the curves
x = a, x = b, y = f(x) and y = g(x).
(i) The volume generated by rotating R about the x-axis is given by
Z b
a
π[(f(x))2 −(g(x))2] dx.
(ii) If we assume R does not cross the y-axis, then the volume generated by
rotating R about the y-axis is given by
V =
Z b
a
2πx[f(x) −g(x)]dx.
(iii) If, in part (ii), R does not cross the line x = c, then the volume generated
by rotating R about the line x = c is given by
V =
Z b
a
2π|c −x|[f(x) −g(x)]dx.
Proof. We leave the proof as an exercise.

Remark 21 There are other various horizontal or vertical axes of rotation
that can be considered. The basic principles given in these theorems can be

base with edge length of 5 units. Find the volume of V of the pyramid.

We let the y-axis go through the center of the pyramid and perpendicular

CHAPTER 5. THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL

Arc Length and Surface Area
The Riemann integral is useful in computing the length of arcs. Let f and
f ′ be continuous on [a, b]. Let C denote the arc
C = {(x, f(x)) : a ≤x ≤b}.
Let P = {a = x0 < x1 < x2 < . . . < xn = b} be a partition of [a, b]. For each
i = 1, 2, . . . , n, let
graph
∆xi = xi −xi−1
∆yi = f(xi) −f(xi−1)
∆si =
p
(f(xi) −f(xi−1))2 + (xi −xi)2
||∆|| = max
1≤i≤n{∆xn}.
Then ∆si is the length of the line segment joining the two points (xi−1, f(xi−1))
and (xi, f(xi)). Let
A(P) =
n
X
i=1
∆si.
Then A(P) is called the polygonal approximation of C with respect to
the portion P.
Deﬁnition 5.8.1 Let C = {(x, f(x)) : x ∈[a, b]} where f and f ′ are con-
tinuous on [a, b]. Then the arc length L of the arc C is deﬁned by
L =

i=1

Theorem 5.8.1 The arc length L deﬁned in Deﬁnition 5.8.1 is given by
L =
Z b
a
p
(f ′(x))2 + 1 dx.

5.8. ARC LENGTH AND SURFACE AREA
261
Proof. By the Mean Value Theorem, for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
f(xi) −f(xi−1) = f ′(ci)(xi −xi−1)
for some ci such that xi−1 < ci < xi. Therefore, each polynomial approxima-
tion Ap is a Riemann Sum of the continuous function

(f ′(x))2 + 1
A(P) =
n
X
i=1

(f ′(ci))2 + 1 ∆xi,
for some ci such that xi−1 < ci < xi.
By the deﬁnition of the Riemann integral, we get

Trigonometric Integrals
The trigonometric integrals are of two types.
The integrand of the ﬁrst
type consists of a product of powers of trigonometric functions of x. The
integrand of the second type consists of sin(nx) cos(mx), sin(nx) sin(mx) or
cos(nx) cos(mx). By expressing all trigonometric functions in terms of sine
and cosine, many trigonometric integrals can be computed by using the fol-
lowing theorem.

Integration by Partial Fractions
A polynomial with real coeﬃcients can be factored into a product of powers
of linear and quadratic factors. This fact can be used to integrate rational
functions of the form P(x)/Q(x) where P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials that
have no factors in common. If the degree of P(x) is greater than or equal to
the degree of Q(x), then by long division we can express the rational function
by
P(x)
Q(x) = q(x) + r(x)
Q(x)
where q(x) is the quotient and r(x) is the remainder whose degree is less than
the degree of Q(x). Then Q(x) is factored as a product of powers of linear
and quadratic factors. Finally r(x)/Q(x) is split into a sum of fractions of
the form
A1
ax + b +
A2
(ax + b)2 + · · · +
An
(ax + b)n
and
B1x + c1
ax2 + bx + c +
B2x + c2
(ax2 + bxc)2 + · · · +
Bmx + cm
(ax2 + bx + c)m.
Many calculators and computer algebra systems, such as Maple or Mathe-
matica, are able to factor polynomials and split rational functions into partial
fractions. Once the partial fraction split up is made, the problem of inte-
grating a rational function is reduced to integration by substitution using
linear or trigonometric substitutions. It is best to study some examples and
do some simple problems by hand.

Theorem 7.3.1 (Cauchy Mean Value Theorem) Suppose that two functions
f and g are continuous on the closed interval [a, b], diﬀerentiable on the open
interval (a, b) and g′(x) ̸= 0 on (a, b). Then there exists at least one number
c such that a < c < b and
f ′(c)
g′(c) = f(b) −f(a)
g(b) −g(a) .
Proof. See the proof of Theorem 4.1.6.
Theorem 7.3.2 Suppose that f and g are continuous and diﬀerentiable on
an open interval (a, b) and a < c < b. If f(c) = g(c) = 0, g′(x) ̸= 0 on (a, b)
and
lim
x→c
f ′(x)
g′(x) = L
then
lim

g(x) = L.

Proof. See the proof of Theorem 4.1.7.
Theorem 7.3.3 (L’Hˆopital’s Rule) Let lim represent one of the limits
lim
x→c, lim
x→c+,
lim
x→c−,
lim
x→+∞,
or
lim

Suppose that f and g are continuous and diﬀerentiable on an open interval
(a, b) except at an interior point c, a < c < b. Suppose further that g′(x) ̸= 0
on (a, b), lim f(x) = lim g(x) = 0 or lim f(x) = lim g(x) = +∞or −∞. If
lim f ′(x)
g′(x) = L, +∞or

then
lim f(x)
g(x) = lim f ′(x)

Proof. The proof of this theorem is omitted.
Deﬁnition 7.3.1 (Extended Arithmetic) For the sake of convenience in deal-
ing with indeterminate forms, we deﬁne the following arithmetic operations
with real numbers, +∞and −∞. Let c be a real number and c > 0. Then
we deﬁne
+ ∞+ ∞= +∞, −∞−∞= −∞, c(+∞) = +∞, c(−∞) = −∞
(−c)(+∞) = −∞, (−c)(−∞) = +∞,
c
+∞= 0,
−c
+∞= 0,
c
−∞= 0,
−c
−∞= 0, (+∞)c = +∞, (+∞)−c = 0, (+∞)(+∞) = +∞, (+∞)(−∞) = −∞,
(−∞)(−∞) = +∞.
Deﬁnition 7.3.2 The following operations are indeterminate:
0
0, +∞
+∞, +∞
−∞
−∞
−∞, −∞
+∞, ∞−∞, 0 · ∞, 00, 1∞, ∞0.
Remark 23 The L’Hˆopital’s Rule can be applied directly to the 0
0 and ±∞
±∞
forms. The forms ∞−∞and 0 · ∞can be changed to the 0
0 or
±∞
±∞by
using arithmetic operations. For the 00 and 1∞forms we use the following
procedure:
lim(f(x))g(x) = lim eg(x) ln(f(x)) = elim
ln(f(x))
(1/g(x)).
It is best to study a lot of examples and work problems.

Deﬁnition 8.1.1 An inﬁnite sequence (or sequence) is a function, say f,
whose domain is the set of all integers greater than or equal to some integer
m. If n is an integer greater than or equal to m and f(n) = an, then we
express the sequence by writing its range in any of the following ways:
1.
f(m), f(m + 1), f(m + 2), . . .

Monotone Sequences
Deﬁnition 8.2.1 Let {tn}∞
n=m be a given sequence. Then {tn}∞
n=m is said
to be
(a) increasing if tn < tn+1 for all n ≥m;
(b) decreasing if tn+1 < tn for all n ≥m;
(c) nondecreasing if tn ≤tn+1 for all n ≥m;
(d) nonincreasing if tn+1 ≤tn for all n ≥m;
(e) bounded if a ≤tn ≤b for some constants a and b and all n ≥m;
(f) monotone if {tn}∞
n=m is increasing, decreasing, nondecreasing or nonin-
creasing.
(g) a Cauchy sequence if for each ϵ > 0 there exists some M such that
|an1 −an2| < ϵ whenever n1 ≥M and n2 ≥M.
Theorem 8.2.1 (a) A monotone sequence converges to some real number if
and only if it is a bounded sequence.
(b) A sequence is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof.
Part (a) Suppose that an ≤an+1 ≤B for all n ≥M and some B. Let L be
the least upper bound of the sequence {an}∞
n=m. Let ϵ > 0 be given. Then
there exists some natural number N such that
L −ϵ < aN ≤L.
Then for each n ≥N, we have
L −ϵ < aN ≤an ≤L.
By deﬁnition {an}∞
n=m converges to L.
Similarly, suppose that B ≤an+1 ≤an for all n ≥M. Let L be the
greatest lower bound of {an}∞
n=m. Then {an}∞
n=m converges to L. It follows
that a bounded monotone sequence converges. Conversely, suppose that a

8.2. MONOTONE SEQUENCES
321
monotone sequence {an}∞
n=m converges to L. Let ϵ = 1. Then there exists
some natural number N such that if n ≥N, then
|an −L| < ϵ
−ϵ < an −L < ϵ
L −ϵ < an < L + ϵ.
The set {an : m ≤n ≤N} is bounded and the set {an : n ≥N} is bounded.
It follows that {an}∞
n=m is bounded. This completes the proof of Part (a) of
the theorem.
Part (b) First, let us suppose that {an}∞
n=m converges to L. Let ϵ > 0 be
given. Then ϵ
2 > 0 and hence there exists some natural number N such that
for all natural numbers p ≥N and q ≥N, we have
|ap −L| < ϵ
2 and |aq −L| < ϵ
2
|ap −aq| = |(ap −L) + (L + aq)|
≤|ap −L| + |a1 −L|
< ϵ
2 + ϵ
2
= ϵ.
It follows that {an}∞
n=m is a Cauchy sequence.
Next, we suppose that {an}∞
n=m is a Cauchy sequence. Let S = {an : m ≤
n < ∞}. Suppose ϵ > 0. Then there exists some natural number N such
that for all p ≥1
|aN+p −aN| < ϵ
2, aN −ϵ
2 < aN+p < aN + ϵ
2
(1)
It follows that S is a bounded set. If S is an inﬁnite set, then S has some
limit point q and some subsequence {ank}∞
k=1 of {an}∞
n=m that converges to
q. Since ϵ > 0, there exists some natural number M such that for all k ≥M,
we have
|ank −q| < ϵ
2
(2)

322
CHAPTER 8. INFINITE SERIES
Also, for all k ≥N + M, we get nk ≥k ≥N + M and
|ak −q| = |ak −ank + ank −q|
≤|ank −ak| + |ank −q|
< ϵ
2 + ϵ2
(by (1) and (2))
= ϵ.
It follows that the sequence {an}∞
n=m converges to q. If S is a ﬁnite set, then
some ak is repeated inﬁnite number of times and hence some subsequences of
{an}∞
n=m converges to ak. By the preceding argument {an}∞
n=m also converges
to ak. This completes the proof of this theorem.
Theorem 8.2.2 Let {f(n)}∞
n=m be a sequence where f is a diﬀerentiable
function deﬁned for all real numbers x ≥m. Then the sequence {f(n)}∞
n=m
is
(a) increasing if f ′(x) > 0 for all x > m;
(b) decreasing if f ′(x) < 0 for all x > m;
(c) nondecreasing if f ′(x) ≥0 for all x > m;
(d) nonincreasing if f ′(x) ≤0 for all x > m.
Proof.
Suppose that m ≤a < b. Then by the Mean Value Theorem for
derivatives, there exists some c such that a < c < b and
f(b) −f(a)
b −a
= f ′(c),
f(b) = f(a) + f ′(c)(b −a).
The theorem follows from the above equation by considering the value of
f ′(c). In particular, for all natural numbers n ≥m,
f(n + 1) = f(n) + f ′(c),
for some c such that n < c < n + 1.
Part (a). If f ′(c) > 0, then f(n + 1) > f(n) for all n ≥m.
Part (b). If f ′(c) < 0, then f(n + 1) < f(n) for all n ≥m.
Part (c). If f ′(c) ≥0, then f(n + 1) ≥f(n) for all n ≥m.
Part (d). If f ′(c) ≤0, then f(n + 1) ≤f(n) for all n ≤m.
This completes the proof of this theorem.

Inﬁnite Series
Deﬁnition 8.3.1 Let {tn}∞
n=1 be a given sequence. Let
s1 = t1, s2 = t1 + t2, s3 = t1 + t2 + t3, · · · , sn =
n
X

for all natural number n. If the sequence {sn}∞
n=1 converges to a ﬁnite number
L, then we write
L = t1 + t2 + t3 + · · · =

tk.
We call
n
X
k=1
tk an inﬁnite series and write
∞
X
k=1
tk = lim
n→∞
n
X
k=1
tk = L.
We say that L is the sum of the series and the series converges to L. If a
series does not converge to a ﬁnite number, we say that it diverges. The
sequence {sn}∞
n=1 is called the sequence of the nth partial sums of the series.
Theorem 8.3.1 Suppose that a and r are real numbers and a ̸= 0. Then
the geometric series
a + ar + ar2 + · · · =
∞
X
k=0
ark =
a
1 −r,
if |r| < 1. The geometric series diverges if |r| ≥1.
Proof. For each natural number n, let
sn = a + ar + · · · + arn−1.
On multiplying both sides by r, we get
rsn = ar + ar2 + · · · + arn−1 + arn
sn −rsn = a −arn
(1 −r)sn = a(1 −rn)
sn =

1 −r −
a
1 −r
lim
n→∞rn =

1 −r.
If |r| > 1, then lim
n→∞rn is not ﬁnite and so the sequence {sn}∞
n=1 of nth partial
sums diverges.
If r = 1, then sn = na and lim
n→∞na is not a ﬁnite number.
This completes the proof of the theorem.
Theorem 8.3.2 (Divergence Test) If the series
∞

f(n) and

n=1 and {Bn}∞
n=1 are strictly increasing sequence. Let
A represent the least upper bound of {An}∞
n=1 and let B represent the least
upper bound of {Bn}∞
n=1
Part (a) If An ≤M for all natural numbers, then {An}∞

converges to A and
A =

ak converges to A.
Part (c) If

is strictly increasing and divergent, for every M there exists some m such
that
M < An ≤Bn
for all natural numbers n ≥m. It follows that {Bn}∞

Therefore, s2n+2 > s2n and {s2n}∞
n=1 is an increasing sequence. Similarly,
s2n+3 −s2n+1 = (−1)2n+4a2n+3 −(−1)2n+2a2n+1 = a2n+3 −a2n+1 < 0.
Therefore, s2n+3 < s2n+1 and {s2n+1}∞
n=0 is a decreasing sequence. Further-
more,
s2n = a1 −a2 + a3 −a4 + · · · + (−1)2n+1a2n
= a1 −(a2 −a3) −(a4 −a5) −· · · −(a2n−2 −a2n−1) −a2n < a1.
Thus, {s2n}∞
n=1 is an increasing sequence which is bounded above by a1.
Therefore, {s2n}∞

(a) If L < 1, then the series P∞

(b) If L > 1, then the series P∞

(c) If M < 1, then the series P∞

(d) If M > 1, then the series P∞
k=1 ak does not converge absolutely.
(e) If L = 1 or M = 1, then the series P∞

absolutely.
Proof. Suppose that for a series

k=1
ak,
lim
n→∞

an+1
an

and
lim
n→∞|an|1/n = M.
Part (a) If L < 1, then the series

lim

|an+1|
|an|

Hence, the series
∞

ak converges absolutely.
Part (b) As in Part (a), the series
∞

|ak| diverges by the ratio test if L > 1,
since
lim

|an+1|
|an|

Part (c) If M < 1, then the series

|ak| converges by the root test, since
lim
n→∞|ak|1/n = M < 1.
Part (d) If M > 1, then the series

Power Series
Deﬁnition 8.6.1 If a0, a1, a2, . . . is a sequence of real numbers, then the
series P∞
k=1 akxk is called a power series in x. A positive number r is called
the radius of convergence and the interval (−r, r) is called the interval of
convergence of the power series if the power series converges absolutely for
all x in (−r, r) and diverges for all x such that |x| > r. The end point x = r is
included in the interval of convergence if P∞
k=1 akrk converges. The end point
x = −r is included in the interval of convergence if the series P∞
k=1(−1)kakrk
converges. If the power series converges only for x = 0, then the radius of
convergence is deﬁned to be zero. If the power series converges absolutely
for all real x, then the radius of convergence is deﬁned to be ∞.
Theorem 8.6.1 If the series
∞
X
n=1
cnxn converges for x = r ̸= 0, then the
series
∞
X

cnxn converges absolutely for all numbers x such that |x| < |r|.
Proof. Suppose that
∞
X
n=0
cnrn converges. Then, by the Divergence Test,
lim
n→∞cnrn = 0.
For ϵ = 1, there exists some natural number m such that for all n ≥m,
|cnrn| < ϵ = 1.
Let
M = max{|cnrn| + 1 : 1 ≤n ≤m}.
Then, for each x such that |x| < |r|, we get |x/r| < 1 and

CHAPTER 8. INFINITE SERIES
By the comparison test the series
∞
X
n=0
|cnxn| converges for x such that |x| <
|r|. This completes the proof of Theorem 8.6.1.
Theorem 8.6.2 If the series
∞
X
n=0
cn(x −a)n converges for some x −a =
r ̸= 0, then the series
∞
X
n=0
cn(x −a)n converges absolutely for all x such that
|x −a| < |r|.
Proof. Let x−a = u. Suppose that
∞
X
n=0
cnun converges for some u = r. Then
by Theorem 8.6.1, the series
∞
X
n=0
cnun converges absolutely for all u such that
|u| < |r|. It follows that the series
∞
X
n=0
cn(x −a)n converges absolutely for all
x such that |x −a| < |r|. This completes the proof of the theorem.
Theorem 8.6.3 Let
∞
X
n=0
cnxn be any power series. Then exactly one of the
following three cases is true.
(i) The series converges only for x = 0.
(ii) The series converges for all x.
(iii) There exists a number R such that the series converges for all x with
|x| < R and diverges for all x with |x| > R.
Proof.
Suppose that cases (i) and (ii) are false.
Then there exist two
nonzero numbers p and q such that
∞
X
n=0
cnpn converges and
∞
X
n=0
cnqn diverges.
By Theorem 8.6.1, the series converges absolutely for all x such that |x| < |p|.
Let
A = {p :
∞
X
n=0
cnpn converges}.

8.6. POWER SERIES
349
The set A is bounded from above by q. Hence A has a least upper bound, say
R. Clearly |p| ≤R < q and hence R is a positive real number. Furthermore,
∞
X
n=0
cnxn converges for all x such that |x| < R and diverges for all x such that
|x| > R. We deﬁne R to be 0 for case (i) and R to be ∞for case (ii). This
completes the proof of Theorem 8.6.3.
Theorem 8.6.4 Let
∞
X
n=0
cn(x −a)n be any power series. Then exactly one
of the following three cases is true:
(i) The series converges only for x = a and the radius of convergence is 0.
(ii) The series converges for all x and the radius of convergence is ∞.
(iii) There exists a number R such that the series converges for all x such
that |x −a| < R and diverges for all x such that |x −a| > R.
Proof.
Let u = x −a and use Theorem 8.6.3 on the series
∞
X
n=0
cnun. The
details of the proof are left as an exercise.
Theorem 8.6.5 If R > 0 and the series
∞
X

cnrn converges for |x| < R, then
the series
∞
X
n=1
ncnxn−1, obtained by term-by-term diﬀerentiation of

X

converges absolutely for |x| < R.
Proof. For each x such that |x| < R, choose a number r such that |x| < r <
R. Then
∞
X

cnxn converges, lim
n→∞cnrn = 0 and hence {cnrn}∞

There exists some M such that |cnrn| ≤M for each natural number n. Then

that

This
completes the proof of this theorem.
Theorem 8.6.6 If R > 0 and the series
∞

cn(x −a)n converges for all x
such that |x−a| < R, then the series
∞
X
n=0
cn(x−a)n may be diﬀerentiated with
respect to x any number of times and each of the diﬀerential series converges
for all x such that |x −a| < R.
Proof. Let u = x−a. Then
∞
X
n=0
cnun converges for all u such that |u| < R. By
Theorem 8.6.5, the series
∞
X
n=1
ncnun−1 converges for all u such that |u| < R.
This term-by-term diﬀerentiation process may be repeated any number of
times without changing the radius of convergence. This completes the proof
of this theorem.
Theorem 8.6.7 Suppose that R > 0 and f(x) = P∞
n=0 cnxn and R is radius

Hence, f(x) is continuous at each number c such that −R < c < R. This

(c) ∞, if the series converges absolutely for all real number x.
If the radius of convergence of the power series in (x −a) is r, 0 < r < ∞,
then the interval of convergence of the series is (a −r, a + r). The end points
x = a + r or x = a −r are included in the interval of convergence if the
corresponding series P∞

Analytic Geometry and Polar
Coordinates
A double right-circular cone is obtained by rotating a line about a ﬁxed axis
such that the line intersects the axis and makes the same angle with the
axis. The intersection point of the line and the axis is called a vertex. A
conic section is the intersection of a plane and the double cone. Some of
the important conic sections are the following: parabola, circle, ellipse and a
hyperbola.
9.1
Parabola
Deﬁnition 9.1.1 A parabola is the set of all points in the plane that are
equidistant from a given point, called the focus, and a given line called the
directrix. A line that passes through the focus and is perpendicular to the
directrix is called the axis of the parabola. The intersection of the axis with
the parabola is called the vertex.
Theorem 9.1.1 Suppose that v(h, k) is the vertex and the line x = h −p is
the directrix of a parabola. Then the focus is F(h + p, k) and the axis is the
horizontal line with equation y = k. The equation of the parabola is
(y −k)2 = 4p(x −h).
361

362CHAPTER 9. ANALYTIC GEOMETRY AND POLAR COORDINATES
Theorem 9.1.2 Suppose that v(h, k) is the vertex and the line y = k −p is
the directrix of a parabola. Then the focus is F(h, k + p) and the axis is the
vertical line with equation x = h. The equation of the parabola is
(x −h)2 = 4p(y −k).
9.2
Ellipse
Deﬁnition 9.2.1 An ellipse is the locus of all points, the sum of whose
distances from two ﬁxed points, called foci, is a ﬁxed positive constant that
is greater than the distance between the foci.
The midpoint of the line
segment joining the two foci is called the center. The line segment through
the foci and with end points on the ellipse is called the major axis. The
line segment, through the center, that has end points on the ellipse and is
perpendicular to the major axis is called the minor axis. The intersections
of the major and minor axes with the ellipse are called the vertices.
Theorem 9.2.1 Let an ellipse have center at (h, k), foci at (h ± c, k), ends
of the major axis at (h ± a, k) and ends of the minor axis at (h, k ± b), where
a > 0, b > 0, c > 0 and a2 = b2 + c2. Then the equation of the ellipse is
(x −h)2
a2
+ (y −k)2
b2
= 1.
The length of the major axis is 2a and the length of the minor axis is 2b.
Theorem 9.2.2 Let an ellipse have center at (h, k), foci at (h, k ± c), ends
of the major axis at (h, k ± a), and the ends of the minor axis at (h ± b, k),
where a > 0, b > 0, c > 0 and a2 = b2 + c2. Then the equation of the ellipse
is
(y −k)2
a2
+ (x −h)2
b2
= 1.
The length of the major axis is 2a and the length of the minor axis is 2b.
Remark 24 If c = 0, then a = b, foci coincide with the center and the
ellipse reduces to a circle.

9.3. HYPERBOLA
363
9.3
Hyperbola
Deﬁnition 9.3.1 A hyperbola is the locus of all points, the diﬀerence of
whose distances from two ﬁxed points, called foci, is a ﬁxed positive constant
that is less than the distance between the foci. The mid point of the line
segment joining the two foci is called the center. The line segment, through
the foci, and with end points on the hyperbola is called the major axis. The
end points of the major axis are called the vertices.
Theorem 9.3.1 Let a hyperbola have center at (h, k), foci at (h ± c, k),
vertices at (h ± a, k), where 0 < a < c, b =
√
c2 −a2, then the equation of
the hyperbola is
(x −h)2
a2
−(y −k)2
b2

Theorem 9.3.2 Let a hyperbola have center at (h, k), foci at (h, k ± c),
vertices at (h, k ± a), where 0 < a < c, b =
√
c2 −a2, then the equation of
the hyperbola is
(y −k)2
a2
−(x −h)2
b2

Second-Degree Equations
Deﬁnition 9.4.1 The transformations
x = x′ cos θ −y′ sin θ
y = x′ sin θ + y′ cos θ

and
 x′ = x cos θ + y sin θ
y′ = −x sin θ + y cos θ

are called rotations. The point P(x, y) has coordinates (x′, y′) in an x′y′-
coordinate system obtained by rotating the xy-coordinate system by an angle
θ.
Theorem 9.4.1 Consider the equation ax2 + bxy + cy2 + dx + ey + f =
0, b ̸= 0.
Let cot 2θ = (a −c)/b and x′y′-coordinate system be obtained

364CHAPTER 9. ANALYTIC GEOMETRY AND POLAR COORDINATES
through rotating the xy-coordinate system through the angle θ.
Then the
given second degree equation
ax2 + bxy + cy2 + dx + ey + f = 0
becomes
a′x
′2 + c′y
′2 + d′x + e′y + f ′ = 0
where
a′ = a cos2 θ + b cos θ sin θ + c sin2 θ
c′ = a sin2 θ −b sin θ cos θ + c cos2 θ
d′ = d cos θ + e sin θ
e′ = −d sin θ + e cos θ
f ′ = f
Furthermore, the given second degree equation represents
(i) an ellipse, a circle, a point or no graph if b2 −4ac < 0;
(ii) a hyperbolic or a pair of intersecting lines if b2 −4ac > 0;
(iii) a parabola, a line, a pair of parallel lines, or else no graph if b2−4ac = 0.
9.5
Polar Coordinates
Deﬁnition 9.5.1 Each point P(x, y) in the xy-coordinate plane is assigned
the polar coordinates (r, θ) that satisfy the following relations:
x2 + y2 = r2, y = r cos θ, y = r sin θ.
The origin is called the pole and the positive x-axis is called the polar axis.
The number r is called the radial coordinate and the angle θ is called the
angular coordinates. The polar coordinates of a point are not unique as the
rectangular coordinates are. In particular,
(r, θ) ≡(r, θ + 2nπ) ≡(−r, θ + (2m + 1)π)
where n and m are any integers. There does exist a unique polar represen-
tation (r, θ) if r ≥0 and 0 ≤θ < 2π.

Graphs in Polar Coordinates
Theorem 9.6.1 A curve in polar coordinates is symmetric about the
(a) x-axis if (r, θ) and (r, −θ) both lie on the curve;
(b) y-axis if (r, θ) and (r, π −θ) both lie on the curve;
(c) origin if (r, θ), (r, θ + π) and (−r, θ) all lie on the curve.
Theorem 9.6.2 Let e be a positive number. Let a ﬁxed point F be called the
focus and a ﬁxed line, not passing through the focus, be called a directrix. If
P is a point in the plane, let PF stand for the distance between P and the
focus F and let PD stand for the distance between P and the directrix. Then
the locus of all points P such that PF = ePD is a conic section representing
(a) an ellipse if 0 < e < 1;
(b) a parabola if e = 1;
(c) a hyperbola if e > 1;
The number e is called the eccentricity of the conic.
In particular an equation of the form
r =
ek
1 ± e cos θ
represents a conic with eccentricity e, a focus at the pole (origin), and a
directrix perpendicular to the polar axis and k units to the right of the pole,
in the case of + sign, and k units to the left of the pole, in the case of −
sign.
Also, an equation of the form
r =
ek
1 ± e sin θ
represents a conic with eccentricity e, a focus at the pole, and a directrix
parallel to the polar axis and k units above the pole, in the case of + sign,
and k units below the pole, in the case of −sign.

Theorem 9.7.1 Let r = f(θ) be a curve in polar coordinates such that f is

Parametric Equations
Deﬁnition 9.8.1 A parametrized curve C in the xy-plane has the form
C = {(x, y) : x = f(t), y = g(t), t ∈I}
for some interval I, ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
The functions f and g are called the coordinate functions and the variable
t is called the parameter.
Theorem 9.8.1 Suppose that x = f(t), y = g(t) are the parametric equa-
tions of a curve C. If f ′(t) and g′(t) both exist and f ′(t) ̸= 0, then

provided g′(t0) ̸= 0 and f ′(t0) ̸= 0.
Theorem 9.8.2 Let C = {(x, y) : x = f(t), y = g(t), a ≤t ≤b} where f ′(t)
and g′(t) are continuous on [a, b]. Then the arc length L of C is given by
