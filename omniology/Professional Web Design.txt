Harsh Truths About Corporate Websites
By Paul Boag 
We all make mistakes running our websites. However, the nature of 
those mistakes varies depending on the size of your company. As your 
organization grows, the mistakes change. This article addresses 
common mistakes made by large organizations.
Most of the clients I work with are large organizations: universities, 
large charities, public sector institutions and big companies. Over the 
last seven years, I have noticed certain recurring misconceptions 
among these organizations. This article aims to dispel these illusions 
and encourage people to face the harsh reality.
The problem is that if you are reading this, you are probably already 
aware of these things. But hopefully this article will be helpful to you 
as you convince others within your organization. In any case, here are 
some of the harsh truths about websites of large organizations.
You Need A Separate Web Division
In many organizations, the website is managed by either the 
marketing or IT department. However, this inevitably leads to a turf 
war, with the website becoming the victim of internal politics.

In reality, pursuing a Web strategy is not particularly suited to either 
group. IT may be excellent at rolling out complex systems, but it is not 
suited to developing a friendly user experience or establishing an 
online brand.
Jeffrey Zeldman urges organizations to create a separate Web division.
Marketing, on the other hand, is little better. As Jeffrey Zeldman puts 
it in his article Let 
 
 T  here 
 
 B  e Web 
 
 D  ivisions
 
 :
The Web is a conversation. Marketing, by contrast, is a 
monologue… And then there’s all that messy business 
with semantic markup, CSS, unobtrusive scripting, 
card-sorting exercises, HTML run-throughs, involving 
10

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
users in accessibility, and the rest of the skills and 
experience that don’t fall under Marketing’s purview.
Instead, the website should be managed by a single unified team. 
Again, Zeldman sums it up when he writes:
Put them in a division that recognizes that your 
website is not a bastard of your brochures, nor a 
natural outgrowth of your group calendar. Let there be 
Web divisions.
Managing Your Website Is A Full-Time Job
Not only is the website often split between marketing and IT, it is also 
usually under-resourced. Instead of there being a dedicated Web 
team, those responsible for the website are often expected to run it 
alongside their “day job.” When a Web team is in place, it is often 
over-stretched. The vast majority of its time is spent on day-to-day 
maintenance rather than on longer-term strategic thinking.
This situation is further aggravated by the fact that the people hired 
to “maintain” the website are junior members of the staff. They do not 
have the experience or authority to push the website forward. It is 
time for organizations to seriously invest in their websites and finally 
11
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
move their Web strategies forward by hiring full-time senior Web 
managers.
Periodic Redesign Is Not Enough
Because corporate websites are under-resourced, they are often 
neglected for long periods of time. They slowly become out of date in 
their content, design and technology. Eventually, the website becomes 
such an embarrassment that management steps in and demands that 
it be sorted. This inevitably leads to a complete redesign at 
considerable expense. This is a flawed approach. It is a waste of 
money, because when the old website is replaced, the investment that 
was put into it is lost, too. It is also tough on finances, with a large 
expenditure having to be made every few years.
Cameron Moll encourages Web designers to realign, not redesign.
12

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
A better way is continual investment in your website, allowing it to 
evolve over time. Not only is this less wasteful, it is also better for 
users, as pointed out by Cameron Moll in his post Good Designers 
Redesign, Great Designers Realign.
Your Website Cannot Appeal To Everyone
One of the first questions I ask a client is, “Who is your target 
audience?” I am regularly shocked at the length of the reply. Too 
often, it includes a long and detailed list of diverse people. Inevitably, 
my next question is, “Which of those many demographic groups are 
most important?” Depressingly, the answer is usually that they are all 
equally important.
The harsh truth is that if you build a website for everyone, it will 
appeal to no one. It is important to be extremely focused about your 
audience and cater your design and content to it. Does this mean you 
should ignore your other users? Not at all. Your website should be 
accessible by all and not offend or exclude anybody. However, the 
website does need to be primarily aimed at a clearly defined 
audience.
You Are Wasting Money On Social Networking
I find it encouraging that website managers increasingly recognize 
that a Web strategy involves more than running a website. They are 
beginning to use tools such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to 
13
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
increase their reach and engage with new audiences. However, 
although they are using these tools, too often they do so ineffectively. 
Tweeting on a corporate account or posting sales demonstrations on 
YouTube misses the essence of social networking.
Microsoft dramatically improved its image among the development 
community by allowing staff to speak out via the Channel 9 website.
Social networking is about people engaging with people. Individuals 
do not want to build relationships with brands and corporations. They 
want to talk to other people. Too many organizations throw millions 
into Facebook apps and viral videos when they could spend that 
money on engaging with people in a transparent and open way.
14

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Instead of creating a corporate Twitter account or indeed even a 
corporate blog, encourage your employees to start tweeting and 
blogging themselves. Provide guidelines on acceptable behavior and 
what tools they need to start engaging directly with the community 
that is connected to your products and services. This demonstrates 
your commitment not only to the community but also to the human 
side of your business.
Your Website Is Not All About You
While some website managers want their website to appeal to 
everyone, others want it to appeal to themselves and their colleagues. 
A surprising number of organizations ignore their users entirely and 
base their websites entirely on an organizational perspective. This 
typically manifests itself in inappropriate design that caters to the 
managing director’s personal preferences and in content that is full of 
jargon.
A website should not pander to the preferences of staff but should 
rather meet the needs of its users. Too many designs are rejected 
because the boss “doesn’t like green.” Likewise, too much website 
copy contains acronyms and terms used only within the organization.
You’re Not Getting Value From Your Web Team
Whether they have an in-house Web team or use an external agency, 
many organizations fail to get the most from their Web designers. 
15

_____________________________________________________________
Web designers are much more than pixel pushers. They have a wealth 
of knowledge about the Web and how users interact with it. They also 
understand design techniques, including grid systems, white space, 
color theory and much more.
Treating designers as pixel pushers wastes their experience: here, a 
designer laments his predicament on Twitter.
It is therefore wasteful to micro-manage by asking them to “make the 
logo bigger” or to “move that element three pixels to the left.” By 
doing so, you are reducing their role to that of a software operator 
and are wasting the wealth of experience they bring.
16

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
If you want to get the maximum return on your Web team, present it 
with problems, not solutions. For example, if you’re targeting your 
website at teenage girls, and the designer goes for corporate blue, 
suggest that your audience might not respond well to that color. Do 
not tell him or her to change it to pink. This way, the designer has the 
freedom to find a solution that may be even better than your choice. 
You’re allowing your designer to solve the problem you have 
presented.
Design By Committee Brings Death
The ultimate symbol of a large organization’s approach to website 
management is the committee. A committee is often formed to tackle 
the website because internal politics demand that everyone have a 
say and that all considerations be taken into account.
To say that all committees are a bad idea is naive, and to suggest that 
a large corporate website could be developed without consultation is 
fanciful. But when it comes to design, committees are often the kiss of 
death.
17

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Design by committee leads to design on the fly.
Design is subjective. The way we respond to a design is influenced by 
culture, gender, age, childhood experience and even physical 
conditions (such as color blindness). What one person considers great 
design could be hated by another. This is why it is so important that 
design decisions be informed by user testing rather than personal 
experience. Unfortunately, this approach is rarely taken when a 
committee is making the decisions.
Instead, designing by committee becomes about compromise. 
Because committee members have different opinions about the 
design, they look for common ground. One person hates the blue 
18

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
color scheme, while another loves it. This leads to designing on the 
fly, with the committee instructing the designer to “try a different 
blue” in the hopes of finding middle ground. Unfortunately, this leads 
only to bland design that neither appeals to nor excites anyone.
A CMS Is Not A Silver Bullet
Many of the clients I work with have amazingly unrealistic 
expectations of content management systems (CMS). Those without 
one think it will solve all of their content woes, and those who have 
one moan because it hasn’t!
It is certainly true that a CMS can bring a lot of benefits. These 
include:
•
reducing the technical barriers of adding content,
•
allowing more people to add and edit content,
•
facilitating faster updates,
•
and allowing greater control.
But many CMS’ are less flexible than their owners would like. They fail 
to meet the changing demands of the websites they are a platform 
for. Website managers also complain that their CMS is hard to use. In 
many cases, this is because the ones using it have not been 
adequately trained or are not using it regularly enough.
19

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Finally, a CMS may allow content to be easily updated, but it does not 
ensure that content will be updated or even that the quality of 
content will be acceptable. Many CMS-based websites still have out-
of-date content or poorly written copy. This is because internal 
processes have not been put in place to support the content 
contributors.
If you look to a CMS to solve your website maintenance issues, you 
will be disappointed.
You Have Too Much Content
Part of the problem with maintaining content on large corporate 
websites is that there is too much content in the first place. Most of 
these websites have “evolved” over years, with more and more 
content being added. At no point did anyone review the content and 
ask what could be taken away.
Many website managers fill their website with copy that nobody will 
read. This happens because of one or more of the following:
•
A fear of missing something: by putting everything online, 
they believe users will be able to find whatever they want. 
Unfortunately, with so much information available, it is hard to 
find anything.
•
A fear users will not understand: whether from a lack of 
confidence in their website or in their audience, they feel the 
20

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
need to provide endless instruction to users. Unfortunately, 
users never read this copy.
•
A desperate desire to convince: they are desperate to sell their 
product or communicate their message, and so they bloat the 
text with sales copy that actually conveys little valuable 
information.
Steve Krug, in his book Don’t Make Me Think, encourages website 
managers to “get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of 
half of what’s left.” This will reduce the noise level on each page and 
make the useful content more prominent.
Conclusions
Large organizations do a lot right in running their websites. However, 
they also face some unique challenges that can lead to painful 
mistakes. Resolving these problems means accepting that mistakes 
have been made, overcoming internal politics and changing the way 
they control their brand. Doing this will give you a significant 
competitive advantage and make your Web strategy more effective 
over the long term.

Portfolio Design Study: Design Patterns and 
Current Practices
By Vitaly Friedman
Following the requests of our readers, we have carefully selected 
dozens of design and Web development agencies, analyzed their 
portfolio websites and identified popular design patterns. The main 
goal of the study was to provide freelancers and design agencies with 
useful pointers for designing their own portfolio.
We have brainstormed on the most important design issues and 
asked designers across the globe what decisions they often have to 
make when designing a portfolio website. We also asked designers 
what questions they would like answered or analyzed in our case 
study.
In the end, we came up with a bag of 40 solid portfolio-related 
questions — sorted, grouped and ranked according to importance. 
We searched for a good mix of established design agencies and well-
designed portfolio websites of small and large agencies.
Finally, we created a questionnaire of 40 questions and went through 
the websites of all of these design agencies, noticing design patterns 
and filling out our quite lengthy forms. Overall, the study took over 75 
hours to prepare.
22

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
This article presents the initial results of our big portfolio design 
study. Below, we discuss the visual design, structure, layout and 
navigation of portfolio websites. We also get into the design details of 
every single page, including the about, clients, services, portfolio, 
workflow and contact pages. Of course, you do not necessarily have 
to follow the findings presented here; rather, get from them a general 
idea of what other portfolios look like, and then come up with 
something of your own that is usable, distinctive and memorable. We 
thank Mark Nutter for helping us gather data for this study.
Light vs. Dark Design
A general question that comes up often is whether to design a 
visually appealing dark website (that is, use big bold typography and 
vivid colors to give the user a colorful and memorable experience) or 
a softer lighter website (one that has a simple structure and clean 
typography).
Surprisingly, according to our studies:
•
82% of portfolio websites have a light design with neutral calm 
colors. The backgrounds of these websites are generally a light 
shade of gray or yellow, rather than pure white.
•
29% of portfolio websites have vibrant, striking colors.
•
Dark websites are much more likely to have big typography 
and strong visuals.
23

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Of course, picking a dark or light design depends strongly on your 
personal approach and individual goals for the portfolio. Saying that 
the “trend” strongly favors light designs would be inaccurate because 
each type serves its purpose in its particular context.
How Many Columns?
Interestingly, many of the portfolio websites we researched tend to 
vary the number of columns between sections. Client and about 
pages usually have two columns, while front pages often have three 
to four columns and present the most important sections of the 
website in a compact overview. In fact, we see pages getting more 
and more columns: every sixth portfolio website we saw has at least 
one page with four columns.
24

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
According to our study, few websites risk experimenting with so-
called out-of-the-box layouts and navigation like JavaScript scrolling 
and other kinds of original layouts. Most portfolios have traditional 
block-style layouts, with two to three clearly separated columns and a 
simple, convenient navigation menu.
Also, most portfolio websites consist of multiple detailed pages with 
relatively deep sub-sections. Minimalist one-page portfolios were 
rarely encountered: only 5.4% of the portfolio websites we saw have 
simple and minimalist designs.
25

_____________________________________________________________
Introductory Block On Top?
Portfolio websites commonly have a large introductory block in the 
header of the page, essentially a short friendly statement about what 
the agency offers and what advantages a customer will gain by using 
its services. The block usually blends vivid imagery with big 
typography. It conveys both the company’s overall image and the 
personal tone of the agency’s staff, making it equally professional and 
friendly. Such blocks usually appear immediately below the logo on 
the front page.
26

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
According to our study, 79% of portfolio websites have some kind of 
introductory block in the upper region. We noticed, though, that 
some portfolios forgo an introductory block in favor of showcasing 
recent projects. In such designs, a small “About us” block is placed 
somewhere else on the page, often below the fold.
Layout Alignment
Back in ’90s, website layouts were traditionally left-aligned, with either 
vertical navigation in the left sidebar or horizontal navigation near the 
head. With growing adoption of widescreen displays, this has 
changed. More and more designers are horizontally centering their 
layouts so that the passive white space around the page balances the 
layout.
We did notice a trend towards more original, even right-aligned, 
layouts at the beginning of the year, but not a single portfolio in our 
current survey has a right-aligned layout.
27

_____________________________________________________________
According to our study,
•
no portfolio layouts are right-aligned,
•
89% of portfolio layouts are horizontally centered,
•
the rest have either original adaptive layouts, a vivid 
background image that fills the remaining screen space or just 
empty space ― of course, you would see the remaining screen 
space only if your display has a widescreen resolution.
28

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Navigation Alignment
Where to put the main navigation in the layout? The question isn’t 
trivial and often leads to debate among designers. Surprisingly, our 
study revealed that most portfolio designers place the main 
navigation in the upper-right corner of the layout. In fact:
•
80% of portfolios have large horizontal navigation,
•
51% of websites have horizontal navigation with right-aligned 
elements,
•
16.4% have horizontal navigation with left-aligned elements,
•
11% have full-width horizontal navigation with large clickable 
elements.
29

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Vertical navigation is rarely used, and other approaches (such as 
horizontal navigation at the bottom of the page) are found on 
unconventional out-of-the-box layouts, though still uncommon.
Search Box Design
While many portfolio websites are quite small, presenting visitors with 
only some general information about the studio and its design 
process, some portfolios go the length and present a variety of case 
studies, blogs and detailed information about their every major 
project.
In general, if a website contains a lot of information, search 
functionality would very likely benefit some visitors to the website. As 
it turns out, very few companies integrate search functionality into 
their website.
•
89% of the portfolio websites we studied have no search 
functionality,
•
Only 11% of websites have a search box, usually a simple clean 
one. Most of the owners of these portfolios have a blog that 
they update regularly.
Flash Elements
Flash, an established tool for rich interactive design, seems to be 
losing popularity among Web designers — at least among designers 
30

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
of portfolio websites. The reason is probably that certain Flash effects 
can be replaced by advanced JavaScript techniques, which are often 
available from popular JavaScript libraries as easy-to-use plug-ins.
Slideshows, animation effects and transition effects can now be 
created with JavaScript solutions that are lightweight and quicker and 
much easier than Flash. Rich Flash animation and video effects are 
being replaced by simpler, subtler JavaScript techniques. Flash is still 
sometimes used, though — for instance, for dynamic text 
replacement.
In our study, only 3.7% of portfolio websites used Flash heavily, and 
even then usually for slideshows and presentations). The reason is 
very likely that we did not include any interactive motion design 
agencies, Flash design studios or video production studios in our 
study.
Where To Put Contact Information?
One important objective of our study was to understand how 
designers convey information about contact options. Do visitors have 
to click on a “Contact us” button to get in touch with a design 
agency? Or is contact information placed prominently at the top of 
the page? Or do most designers put contact information in the footer 
― where most users expect it anyway?
The websites we analyzed put contact information in almost every

area of the page: top, right, left, bottom, even the middle. But we also 
noticed some interesting patterns ― note that we were interested in, 
first, where the link to the “Contact us” page was located and, 
secondly, where the actual contact information itself was positioned.
It turns out that:
•
Only 12.7% of websites display a phone number in the header 
of the page,
•
Only 9.1% of websites display an email address in the header, 
32

_____________________________________________________________
•
A postal address usually isn’t displayed at all (54.5%) or else is 
placed in the footer (40%) or upper area of the website (5.4%),
•
A “Contact” link usually appears in the upper-right corner 
(71%) and/or in the footer (45.4%),
•
“Contact” (59.7%) and “Contact us” (21%) are the most popular 
wordings for the link to the contact page.

“About Us” Page
The About page is used on portfolio websites to present the members 
of the team, explain the philosophy of the agency and prove the 
company’s expertise and professionalism. The page gives the design 
studio a personal touch and — if designed properly — elicits the trust 
of potential customers.
An About page is clearly a must for portfolios: 89% of those we 
analyzed included a link to the page in their main navigation.
The level of detail you use to describe your agency is, of course, up to 
you. 59.1% of About pages we surveyed have no sub-pages and offer 
visitors a brief, compact overview. Photos of team members, their 
personal information and information about the design process are 
very common on such pages. The tone of the main copy is usually 
informal, friendly and sometimes even funny. The most popular 
wordings for the link to the page is “About” (43.6%), “About us” 
(27.3%) and “Who we are” (7.2%).
Client Page
One of the surest signs of professionalism and a good reputation in 
the industry is a solid list of clients with whom your company has 
worked. Of course, the more prominent the companies in the list, the 
more likely potential customers will give you their attention. In our 
experience, many customers seek out a client list, case studies and 
34

_____________________________________________________________
testimonials when searching for a design agency. So we were 
surprised to find that only a few agencies have a standalone page 
listing their clients.
Of the portfolios we analyzed, only 47.2% have a client page (either as 
a standalone page or part of a portfolio page). In most cases, clients 
are represented by their logos, which are often linked to detailed case 
studies that discuss the work done by the agency and client 
testimonials. The most popular wording for the link to this page is 
“Our clients” (46.1%), “Clients” (39.6%) and “Client list” (15.4%).
Services Page
Given that visitors usually come to such websites because they are 
looking for services, validating their search with clear introductory text 
on the front page or with a standalone services page is reasonable. 
Potential clients usually have a pretty good understanding of what 
they are looking for (motion design, print design, Web design, 
CD/DVD jacket design, etc.), so putting your major offerings on the 
services page is a good idea.
67.2% of the portfolios we looked at have a standalone services page 
of some kind. The rest put their information on the About page or the 
front page. The services pages sometimes have sub-pages (35.1%), 
but in most cases the single page is quite long and detailed.
35

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Linking your portfolio page to your services page is definitely a good 
idea because it bridges theory and practice and shows exactly what 
your agency is capable of. The most popular wording for links to such 
pages is “Services” or “Our Services” (75.7%), followed by “What we 
do” (10.8%).
Portfolio Page
Potential customers obviously want to see what a design agency is 
capable of. Does its style match theirs? What aesthetic does it 
communicate for visual design, typography and usability? Do its 
designs feel intuitive and look pleasant? These are the questions 
potential customers want answered when they become interested in a 
design agency. So, a solid showcase of previous work could close the 
deal and convince them to contact the agency.
In general, be selective with the work you showcase, and let visitors 
order and filter the projects by style, industry and year. Also provide 
some information about each project, or even conduct a detailed case 
study with testimonials and insight into your workflow. Unfortunately, 
few portfolios do that.
According to our study:
•
7.2% of websites don’t have a portfolio at all,
•
12.7% have only logos or screenshots, without any description 
36

_____________________________________________________________
or case study,
•
16.4% briefly describe each project next to a logo and/or 
screenshot,
•
63.6% have a very detailed page for each project, including 
case study, testimonials, slideshow of screenshots, drafts and 
sketches.
Surprisingly, the most popular wording for the link to the portfolio 
page is “Work” or “Our work” (47.2%), followed by “Portfolio” (27.2%).
Workflow Page
Actually, the workflow page works rather well as a sub-section of the 
About page, rather than as a standalone page. However, some 
designers want to make their explanation of their workflow more 
prominent. While 74.5% of websites do not have a workflow page at 
all, the rest go to rather great lengths to explain to potential 
customers how their process works and what expectations both 
parties should have.
Giving potential customers a better understanding of how they will be 
involved throughout the design process is certainly a good idea. The 
most popular wordings for the link to this page are “How we work” or 
“Working with us” (42.8%), “Process” or “Our process” (35.7%) and 
“Approach” (7.1%).

_____________________________________________________________
Contact Page
If everything goes right, and your portfolio has earned the interest of 
visitors, then the contact page will be their final destination. Do 
everything you can to make it as easy as possible for them to contact 
you. Make sure customers provides all necessary information by 
presenting a simple, clean form that can accommodate the essential 
information about their project. You could also provide your phone 
number, postal address and email address: the more, the better. 
Driving directions, social profile buttons and vCards are a good idea, 
too.
According to our study:
•
9% of websites don’t have a contact page (instead, contact 
information is included in the footer of each page),
•
Driving directions (often with an interactive Google map) are 
given on 45.4% of portfolio websites(!),
•
83.6% provide a phone number and email address on the 
contact page,
•
76.7% provide a postal address on the contact page,
•
69% of websites have a contact Web form,
•
14.5% offer a vCard for downloading, usually next to the email 
address,
38

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
•
Links to social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter 
and LinkedIn are often used (14.5%).
Specials And Extras
We also noticed a few distinctive elements that some design agencies 
offer potential customers. One popular approach is to offer some kind 
of project or proposal request form, which prospective clients are 
expected to fill out with key details when submitting a request. Also, 
some design agencies offer a project planner or help customers 
estimate costs or offer a more detailed pricing guide.
Among the other interesting things we noticed were chat windows on 
the contact page (e.g. Agami Creative), a “Stress-o-meter” that 
displays the company’s current availability, a quote calculator, and a 
“Capabilities and Credentials” presentation (usually in PDF).
Other Findings
We also found that:
•
None of the portfolio websites have an FAQ page,
•
76.3% of websites have at least one blog. And many portfolios 
have two or more blogs,
•
14.55% have a newsletter or mailing list,
•
9% provide a detailed site map.

Creating A Successful Online Portfolio
by Sean Hodge 
Your portfolio is the showcase of your work, skills and potential for 
future employers. The more time and effort you dedicate to creating a 
usable and good-looking design, the higher your chances of getting a 
better account balance at the end of the month. So how do you make 
sure your portfolio is better than that of competitors? How do you 
draw the attention of employers to your work?
Creating a successful portfolio is easier than you think. Make it simple 
and easy to use and hit your objectives, and you’ll end up with a 
successful portfolio. In this article, we’ll review five pitfalls that plague 
portfolio designs. Then we’ll cover portfolio tips that, if carefully 
heeded and executed well, will deliver quality results.
Let’s review the common mistakes that designers make to ensure that 
you don’t fall into one of these traps.
Pitfall #1: Obfuscating
Clarity and focus should permeate your portfolio. Don’t use twenty 
words when seven would do. Push your best content to the front. 
Where possible, place important content above the fold. Avoid 
meandering in your language. Don't make the levels of your portfolio 
42

_____________________________________________________________
too deep, but make sure that the section still accomplishes your 
objectives.
Copyblogger has an article that features a simple list of writing tips 
based on the early 20th-century writer known for cutting out the fluff. 
See the article Ernest Hemingway’s Top 5 Tips for Writing Well. 
Hemingway championed short sentences, strong forceful language 
and clarity: all principles that make for effective writing on the Web.
In the article Creating The Perfect Portfolio, Collis Ta’eed offers 
portfolio advice from the perspective of a potential employer. The 
section titled "Get to It" gives reasons for limiting the number of 
portfolio pieces you present and for making your best pieces easy to 
find. An employer has to review many applicants quickly. You are 
more likely to make the cut if your best work is prominent. The 
p  ortfolio of Evan Eckard
 
  is an example of a website that promotes his 
best work right on the first page and "gets to it" quickly.
Pitfall #2: Cramming Information
Another pitfall is wanting to say too much in too little space. A 
balance needs to be achieved in the number of pages users have to 
click for more information and the amount of information you fit on a 
page. Be aware of this when constructing your portfolio.
The more tightly packed your portfolio, the more likely it will look 
cluttered. If you do need to put a lot of information on the page, 
43

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
consult the post Grid and Column Designs over on WebDesigner Wall. 
It will give you some great ideas on how to use the grid to your 
advantage when presenting a lot of information.
Pitfall #3: Overdoing It
You’re less likely to go wrong by keeping things simple and organized. 
Do this for all areas of your portfolio. Less is more. The more you try 
to do in your portfolio, the more likely things will go wrong.
Showcasing 18 of your services will be less successful than prioritizing 
a few. Too many types of work or too much work of a single type will 
likely drown users. They won’t spot those prominent pieces that show 
how great your work is.
Pitfall #4: Unusual Navigation
Designers have an urge to stand out as unique. The last place to act 
on this urge is in your website’s navigation. It’s a numbers game. If 
enough visitors to your portfolio have difficulty navigating it, the 
portfolio will have failed to achieve its goals.
In the post My Last Portfolio Sucked, Yours Might Too, Kyle Meyer 
points out some perfect examples of navigation choices to avoid. He 
reviews 200 portfolios, and points out their problems. Navigation 
accounted for over 32% of the problems.

Examples of navigation choices to avoid.
Pitfall #5: Visual Clutter
Consider the purpose of any decorative element. If it meets your 
goals and complements your work, then great. Otherwise, remove it. 
White space lends a professional feel to your portfolio. The more 
elements you cram into an area, the more difficult it will be to 
maintain a semblance of professionalism.
Use hierarchy to guide users through the page. On Boxes and Arrows, 
the article Visible Narratives: Understanding Visual Organization 
explains the principles related to visual hierarchy.

And in the interview Where Visual Design Meets Usability, both page 
hierarchy and visual clutter are addressed. Luke summarizes some of 
Edward Tufte’s teachings on avoiding superfluous data.
Principles of Effective Portfolio Design
Below you’ll find some suggestions for improving your portfolio or 
getting it right the first time from scratch. Bear in mind that some of 
these suggestions require patience, time and a lot of planning. But 
they’re worth it. And the examples provided show that one can 
achieve outstanding results just by following these 12 simple rules.
Define your Criteria and Strategies for Success
As with any project, clarify your goals before beginning. Once you 
know your goals, then every decision you make will be affected. 
Below are some common portfolio goals. Also, be aware that 
portfolios are often meant to accomplish more than one goal. Or at 
least consider creating multiple portfolios for different purposes.

•
The "hire me" portfolio focuses on getting you a job. If you 
are actively searching for employment, then the primary goal 
of your portfolio is to get you hired. You can target this type of 
portfolio to the type of company you want to work for.
•
The sales generation portfolio focuses on keeping the flow 
of work coming through the door. The goal here is to generate 
leads and move potential customers through the sales 
channel.
•
The reputation-building portfolio builds your name in the 
industry and online. This could take the form of an artist’s 
showcase, or you could tie your work together in a portfolio 
blog.
•
The networking portfolio builds relationships. Many 
networks have excellent portfolio-building tools and offer 
some advantages to placing your portfolio on their website. 
Chief among them is leveraging the website's space for 
networking.
Consider Multiple Portfolios
There are multiple reasons to have more than one portfolio. You may 
have more than one skill set to promote. You may want to send one 
portfolio to a particular marketing director to land you a specific job. 
The director will appreciate that. It saves them time and shows that 
you really want the job ― even if it's a one-page portfolio.

Even if you fill the second portfolio with the same work, you will still 
benefit by targeting your portfolios to different groups.
Take the case of Nik Ainley, a UK-based designer and illustrator. He 
has multiple portfolios that all serve complementary goals. He 
participates in multiple portfolio-based communities to build his 
reputation and to network with other designers. His website, Shiny 
Binary, has received over 1 million visits.
48

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Nik has a p  ortfolio on Behance
 
 . He’s involved in numerous groups 
there and has a large inner circle. The portfolio prominently 
communicates that he is available for freelancing, long-term 
contracts, full-time work and consulting jobs.
He also has a very popular p  ortfolio on DeviantArt
 
 . He’s been a 
member there since 2004 and now has over 80 portfolio pieces and 
over 1,000 comments on his work. A lot of fans have marked his 
works as favorites.
Though less active on Gallery on CPLUV, he does a portfolio there, 
too. And his portfolio on Depthcore is good. That website features 
only artists whose works have been solicited, so the quality is high.
Overall, Nik Ainley shows how one can benefit from having multiple 
portfolios online, even when the work being showcased in the 
portfolios is similar. He is tapping into a different community with 
each one. By doing this yourself, you’re making connections with new 
people and exposing them to your work.
Target Your Market
The more targeted your design is to a specific market, the more it will 
speak to the people in that market. If you are looking to land 
corporate clients in a conservative industry, then present them with 
clean, marketable and professional work. Don’t showcase edgy, 
grungy or arty work unless that’s the market you’re going after.

The article The Secret to Getting a Lot of Web Design Work has a 
section entitled, “Design the portfolio you think your clients want to 
see.” And that is precisely the point. Focus your portfolio on your 
target market. If you’re trying to get certain clients, then design with 
those clients in mind.
There are yet more benefits to targeting a market. In the article 
Finding a Target Market, Barbara Pellow discusses both vertical and 
horizontal approaches to target marketing. She identifies some of the 
other benefits of target marketing. Speaking to a specific audience 
allows you to become a recognized expert in the field more easily. 
Targeting a market differentiates your services.
Consider the example of a Web designer who specializes in law firm 
website. His target market will be different than that of a designer 
who builds rock band websites. The language, graphics and approach 
of their respective portfolios will differ greatly. A Web designer who 
has numerous successful law firm websites in his portfolio will make it 
easier for other potential law firm clients to choose him over another 
designer or agency.

Designers are more likely to stand out by targeting a specific market. 
Their success rate at landing niche jobs and being perceived as 
experts in their field will increase. Take Dan Gilroy
 
 's    p  ortfolio
 
  as an 
example of one that successfully targets a particular market.
Having a target market is essential to selecting portfolio pieces and 
designing your website.

Prioritize Usability
Navigation is of paramount importance. See the point above about 
unusual navigation. Another consideration is Web standards. This is 
especially relevant if you’re currently looking for a job. Read the article 
Five 
 
 S  teps to a 
 
 B  etter 
 
 D  esign 
 
 P  ortfolio
 
  by Jeffrey Veen. In it, he 
discusses best practices for portfolios in the context of how you will 
be perceived by employers.
Also, don’t discount search bots. Work towards better search engine 
optimization. The blog SEOBook is a rich resource on the topic. Good 
SEO improves the ability of potential clients to find you in search 
engines.
Use the Right Technology
If certain technologies are fixtures of the job descriptions you're 
interested in, then it makes sense to build your portfolio with that 
technology. Sure Flash is cool, but is it right for your website? 
Probably not if you’re a logo designer. But if you’re trying to land a 
job as a Flash designer at a top-notch interactive design agency, then 
it's the right choice.
The navigation in the po
  rtfolio of 
 
 new media designer 
 
 Mathew V.
 
  
Robinson (see next page) is easy to use. Speed is essential to the 
success of a Flash website. Matthew's portfolio is highly usable and 
looks great.
52

_____________________________________________________________
Consider maintainability when deciding on technologies. Simplifying 
your portfolio as much as possible will reduce the time you spend 
upgrading and making changes.
How easy is it to add and remove portfolio pieces? The easier it is, the 
more likely you’ll update the portfolio regularly. Jamie Gregory has an 
simple, elegant and effective one-page portfolio. He would have no 
trouble adding or swapping out pieces.
53

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Consider enhancement when looking at technology. A wise choice is 
often to add just a little Javascript or other technology, rather than 
rely on them heavily. It will help achieve your goals without 
complicating your design. On Marius Roosendaal’s 
 
 p  ortfolio
 
 , take a 
moment to explore how clean the source code is, complemented by 
the elegant JavaScript-based solutions.
Think first before choosing between a static website and a content 
management system. One-page portfolios are easy to update and a 
quick way to show your best work. You’ll also have no issues with 
navigation, with only one page. But you'll have little flexibility, and you 
won’t be able to leverage the additional features that content 
management systems have to promote your work, like a blog.
Plan The Project
A key factor in creating a successful portfolio is to approach it as you 
would a client project. Manage the project as professionally as you 
would any other Web project you take on. Set aside sufficient time to 
achieve the goals you’ve outlined. Make sure also to set deadlines to 
keep you on track.
Limit The Scope And Type of Work You Promote
Your portfolio should be limited to your best work within the scope of 
your goals. If you are looking to do website redesigns, then your 
portfolio should consist only of those, not logo designs or print work 
54

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
you may have done. If you're not looking for a particular type of work, 
then don’t showcase it. You will be more successful.
Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain redesigned his website, 31three.com, back 
in May 2007. He used to have print and logo designs in his portfolio. 
In the redesign, he clarified his target market by focusing on 
providing design assistance to developers.
His current portfolio presents only website and interface designs 
because that is the type of work he is looking for. This portfolio is very 
successful on many fronts and has been cited throughout the 
blogosphere.
That doesn’t mean that Jesse doesn’t do logo or identity design. He 
does, but he recognizes that logo design is not why people come to 
him. They come to him for designs for new or existing websites; logo 
design might happen to be part of the package. See more about his 
process in the article Redesigning 
 
 the ExpressionEngine Site
 
 .
Certainly some designers and firms will have mixed bas. The more 
types of work you do well, the greater the challenge you’ll have in 
promoting that work. When possible, keep the work on display to a 
minimum. Ten of your best pieces often work better than fifty good 
pieces.

Provide Adequate Contact Information, 
Documentation And Explanations
Contact information should be easy to find, and contact forms should 
be easy to use. Make this information prominent. The Hicksdesign 
p  ortfolio
 
  displays contact information well on every page.
Clarifying your role in the projects in your portfolio instills confidence 
in potential clients. If you designed a website but someone else coded 
it, state that. If you did everything, then confidently declare that, too. 
Cameron Moll demonstrates this principle.
Case studies give a deeper view into your process. Once a potential 
client has narrowed their list, they may come back to spend more

time on your portfolio. Case studies show how competent and 
thorough your process is. David Airey makes his c
 
 ase studies
 
  easy to 
find.
Client testimonials are effective in persuading visitors that you deliver 
on promises. They increase professionalism when tastefully 
incorporated in a portfolio. David Airey's article The Importance of 
Client 
 
 Testimonials
 
  has useful information on the subject.
Present Your Work In The Context of Your Goals
Your work should stand out the most in your portfolio. If the design 
or page layout overpowers the work on display, then you’re not likely 
to meet your goals. Consider every visual element that you add to the 
page carefully. When unsure, favor simplicity.

Infuse Your Personality In The Design
Nick La's portfolio captures his design style and interests. The unique 
background illustration stands out. It doesn’t impede usability but 
acts as a beautiful wrapper. For some, this would interfere too much 
with the work being presented (though his portfolio works fine).
Nick sets his pieces against a solid white background in a strong 
column-based design. The work shown suits the background 
illustration. Pulling off this kind of infusion of personality is difficult, 
but it makes your portfolio not only memorable but remarkable.
Nick has achieved tremendous success with his N.design Studio 
portfolio. Infusing personality in a design ultimately means giving 
expression to the aesthetic you have been cultivating over the years.

Seth Godin makes some excellent points about being remarkable in 
his post How to 
 
 B  e 
  R  emarkable
 
 . He says, “Remarkability lies in the 
edges: the biggest, fastest, slowest, richest, easiest, most difficult.” This 
is a good point, but in pursuing that edge, you run the huge risk of 
riding right off the cliff.
Carefully consider how you will blend such remarkable personal 
elements into your portfolio without sacrificing usability and without 
upsetting the balance between the prominence of your portfolio and 
the overall website design.

Promote And Leverage Your Work
There are many ways to promote your portfolio. Consider joining 
professional online communities to network with other members. 
We’ve already looked at some communities where you can submit a 
portfolio. Add a thread to a design forum about your portfolio. 
Submit your design to gallery websites. Almost any strategy for 
promoting a website can be used to promote a portfolio.
Add a blog to your website. The more traffic you draw to your 
website, the more exposure your portfolio will get. Dan Cederholm 
was an early adopter of this strategy and achieved fame with his blog 
Simplebits. His portfolio resides successfully on the same website.
Leveraging your work involves linking to it when you send emails. Add 
a link to your portfolio in your Facebook profile or any other 
community you belong to. Integrate your portfolio into your 
communications and online identity.
Develop Long-Term Goals
Having a vision of the future always helps. Your needs will evolve as 
you take on different projects over the course of your career. All the 
same, looking at the recent past can also affect the choices you make 
in creating your portfolio.

Better User Experience With Storytelling
By Francisco Inchauste 
Stories define our world. They have been with us since the dawn of 
communication, from cave walls to the tall tales recounted around 
fires. They continue to evolve, but their purpose remains the same: to 
entertain, share common experiences, teach and pass on traditions.
Today we communicate a bit differently. Our information is 
fragmented across various mass-media channels and delivered 
through ever-changing technology. It has become watered down, 
cloned, and is churned out quickly in 140-character blurbs. We’ve lost 
that personal touch where we find an emotional connection that 
makes us care.
Using storytelling, however, we can pull these fragments together in a 
common thread. We can connect as real people, not just computers. 
In this article, we’ll explore how user experience professionals and 
designers are using storytelling to create compelling experiences that 
build human connections.
It Begins With a Story
In 1977, a simple story turned the film industry on its head. The 
special effects technology used to construct this story had not been 
62

created or used in filmmaking prior to its release. The author 
disregarded what was popular and marketable at the time 
(apocalyptic and disaster movies) to follow his own vision. The film 
starred unknown actors, and the genre was a relic of 1930s serial 
movies. It was turned down by many film studios and at one point 
almost shelved.
The movie, if you haven’t yet guessed, is Star Wars. The author is 
George Lucas. Star Wars went on to become one of the most 
successful films of all time and a pop culture phenomenon. It 
inaugurated the blockbuster trilogy and completely changed the way 
special effects were done. Many of today’s most influential film 
companies were spawned from the success of these movies: 
LucasFilm, THX, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Pixar.
Star Wars wasn’t a new story, though. It drew on the mythic 
archetypes from stories told over thousands of years.
Revealing the Design in Stories
The creation of a story is often viewed as an almost magical or 
random process. The author sits in front of their canvas, the blank 
word processor, and begins to type whatever inspires them at the 
moment. Great stories, though, don’t just happen randomly; they are 
designed. There is a pattern at work here. In order to be entertaining, 
find the right dramatic cues and tap deep into our collective psyche, a 
writer must follow a specific method. A story that fails to pull in the

audience emotionally and hold their attention probably did not use 
enough of these patterns as a guide, as shown in the arc of a typical 
story below.
The story "arc" is widely used in screenwriting and novels.
This story structure has been around since long before screenwriting 
was taught. There was a point when it remained simply an unnoticed 
rhythm in the background of every story. Some aspects of this 
structure — such as the hero’s journey and comparative mythology — 
were first popularized by Joseph Campbell. He wrote about his studies 
in the book The Hero with a Thousand Faces.
Campbell was a disciple of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who believed 
that we are all born with a subconscious idea of what a “hero”, 
“mentor” and “quest” should be.
64

_____________________________________________________________
Campbell studied the structure of religions and myths across many 
cultures. He discovered that, consciously or not, every story (or myth) 
was created with the same basic formula. This is why great stories 
transcend even language barriers. This assessment by Campbell set 
off large ripples in the waters of myth and religion.
The stories that captivate us on the silver screen and in novels follow 
these same patterns. We talk about dialogue and scenes at the water 
cooler as if they happened to a personal friend, rather than a fictional 
character. All because we become emotionally invested in the 
characters and story.
Brands strive for this emotional investment every day. Starbucks 
doesn’t just want to sell us coffee ― it wants customers to become 
invested in its story: the ambience, aromas, community. Its goal is to 
become the “third abode” (home, work, Starbucks). It claims that, “It’s 
really about the human connection.”
The Power of Emotion
When speaking of stories, we describe more of an emotional 
experience, something that affects us at a very personal level. This is 
much different than the way we usually describe our experience with 
products such as websites and applications. These are seen more as 
utilitarian and task-oriented.

If we are able to accomplish what we set out to do― say, transfer 
money in a banking application ― then it has been a good user 
experience. If to achieve our goals, the interface should be usable and 
should function the way we expect. This view is preached by many 
usability experts, including Donald Norman, professor of cognitive 
science and a usability consultant for the Nielsen Norman Group.
Upon hearing people say that if his rules were followed, then 
“everything would be ugly,” Norman decided to explore people’s 
relationship to design. The result was the book Emotional Design.
Through his research, Norman found that design affects how people 
experience products, which happens at three different levels and 
translates into three types of design:
66

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
•
Visceral design
This design is from a subconscious and biologically pre-wired 
level of thinking. We might automatically dislike certain things 
(spiders, rotten smells, etc.) and like others (”attractive” people, 
symmetrical objects, etc.). This is our initial reaction to 
appearance.
•
Behavioral design
This is how the product or application functions, the look and 
feel, the usability: our total experience with using it.
•
Reflective design
This is how the product or application makes us feel after the 
initial impact and interaction, where we associate it with our 
broader life experience and attach meaning and value to it.
There is a lot more to emotion than can be covered here, but 
understanding these basic levels of processing gives us some insight 
into why storytelling is so powerful. Consider how the levels play off 
each other at an amusement park: people pay to be scared. At the 
visceral level, we have a fear of heights and danger. At the reflective 
level, we trust that it is safe to go on the ride; and we anticipate that 
emotionally charged rush and sense of accomplishment (in 
overcoming our fear of heights) when the ride is over.
Given how vital emotion is to how we think, it becomes all the more 
important not just to create a functional and usable experience but to 
seek out and create a meaningful connection.

The Basics of Storytelling for User Experience
At a basic level, storytelling and user experience have common 
elements — planning, research and content creation — that can be 
used to create a satisfying experience. Storytelling offers a way for a 
team to really understand the product it is building and the audience 
it is building it for. 
Stories enable the most complex of ideas to be effectively 
communicated to people. This crafted product or experience then 
delivers meaning and emotion to its users. Professionals who 
currently exploit the power of narrative in their projects do so in vastly 
different ways. The following sections outline some of the modern 
uses and benefits of storytelling.
Bring Teams Together
User experience professionals typically have to work with people from 
many different backgrounds. Depending on the type of experience 
needed, this may require the effort of anyone from an engineer to a 
user interface designer. And the approach often taken in creating 
websites or applications is to first consider the technology, or the 
limits of that technology. To make matters more complex, members of 
large teams tend be preoccupied with their respective domains; for 
example, the marketing person will focus on his own objectives and 
strategies based on his experience. This is not always in the end user’s 
best interest and often results in a poor, diluted experience.

The user experience team selected to create an iPhone application for 
the masses would be quite different than the one selected to develop 
a medical device for doctors. As mentioned, the experts at crafting 
stories know how to tap into a way of communicating that has been 
around for thousands of years. Using storytelling, user experience 
teams can also inject emotion and value into their product for users.
User-Centered Goal
In hearing about the storytelling approach, one might think that it's 
just another way of talking about “strategy.” But storytelling carries 
with it a more user-centered goal. Companies like Apple have used 
similar methods in their design process to really define what they are 
building.

_____________________________________________________________
Cindy Chastain refers to it as an experience theme. She says this theme 
is “the core value of the experience” being offered. Christian Saylor 
refers to it as finding the lead character. Without this user-centered 
goal, he states, we are just “designing for the sake of designing.”
Oriented around a specific theme or character, the otherwise 
uncoordinated elements of an experience all merge into a clear goal 
and purpose. With storytelling, a diverse team creating a website or 
application can collectively link the tangible elements and create 
something that is a meaningful experience and more than just bits 
and bytes.
Defining the User
A lot of discussion and articles are circulating about usability and 
functionality on websites and in applications. Functionality, of course, 
is important. For instance, what good is an airplane if the engine isn’t 
powerful enough to get it off the ground? If you step back though, 
the more important question is, how far does the passenger need to 
go? If it’s only a few miles down the road, then it really doesn’t matter 
if the plane is functional: it’s the wrong solution altogether. So, 
identifying what we really need to build is key in the initial phase of 
building the user experience.
When the research is finished, we typically move on to create 
personas as a way to understanding the user, and this can be 
regarded as part of creating the story. By building an imagined 
representation of the user based on real research and observation, we 
70

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
are able to empathize with users and truly understand their needs. By 
creating stories around these personas, we are able to conceive a 
more meaningful vision of the project.
Storytelling allows us to translate this research into anecdotes, which 
people have been shown to have a better rate of recall. In addition, 
being able to empathize with users through stories helps us better 
understand the emotional side of the experience. Films and video 
games deliver experiences that affect people at an emotional level. 
This is something people will begin to expect more from the websites 
and applications they use every day.
We can thus shift our focus from creating simple task-driven websites 
and applications to cultivating valuable human connections. This is, 
after all, a “global campfire” as Curt Cloninger refers to it. He goes on 
to say, “The Web is not a global network of connected computers. The 
Web is a global network of connected people. And storytelling is still 
the most effective way to emotionally impact people.”
The Benefits
Most projects have a lot of documentation outlining their goals and 
strategies. These come in the form of business requirements, 
functional documentation and other supporting research and 
information. Storytelling can improve the overall product/experience 
by doing the following:

Putting a human face to dry data,
•
Simplifying complex ideas for the team,
•
Making team collaboration more efficient,
•
Clarifying purpose,
•
Gaining insight into primary users,
•
Setting a project's direction more quickly,
•
Facilitating communication within large organizations,
•
Delivering meaning and value to users.
Storytelling helps teams focus on everything from website content to 
understanding their business problem in a new way. For example, you 
could quickly define a project's scope without designing or 
wireframing screens. The UX team for Yahoo Personals created a story 
about a fictional dating couple going through certain scenarios. 
Through this story, the team was able to better understand the 
purpose of the website and the type of experience users should go 
through. It opened up the task- and strategy-based steps to the more 
authentic and emotional experience of dating. It was a powerful way 
to get the team to speak directly "to" the experience, rather than 
create documentation "around" it.
Happily Ever After: The Reality
There are many different opinions on how best to craft the user 
experience. Many of them stem from the basic approaches developed 
by Alan Cooper, a pioneer in building software with user-driven 
experiences. But as technology evolves, so do the approaches and 
72

_____________________________________________________________
processes used to create solutions that meet users’ needs. The 
number of approaches to user experience is close to the number of 
frameworks available to develop software. It usually comes down to 
what is best for the type of projects that a team typically works on.
Your ability to follow a particular process depends on many things, 
including timeline, budget and goals. In reality, doing everything as 
outlined is not always possible. 
Storytelling is a way to connect teams quickly, to gain insight and 
understanding. The experiences we create take shape through design, 
content and user interaction. Storytellers have been communicating 
successfully for much longer than websites have been around — 
which makes storytelling a valuable tool for the business side of 
design.
A Few Modern-Day Storytellers
Although the idea of using storytelling within the user experience 
process is fairly new, a few professionals are using it in their projects. I 
spoke with some of these modern-day storytellers to get their 
perspective and see how they are applying storytelling to their work.
Dorelle Rabinowitz
Dorelle is a storyteller who designs, illustrates and tells stories in a 
variety of media and contexts. Mostly she tells stories.

_____________________________________________________________
Question: How do you approach storytelling in UX?
Dorelle: I see it as another tool we can use as a catalyst to 
communicate during our design activities. For me as a designer, it’s 
about putting a human face to the design process and bringing 
people together. You can get designers, engineers, product managers, 
strategists and execs jazzed about a proposed feature because of a 
story, and it can be extremely fulfilling. As a person, it’s all about the 
emotional connection.
Back in the day, I worked on an Oxygen media website called “Our 
Stories,” where we created short online digital stories with our 
74

_____________________________________________________________
audience. We called it co-creation, and when I moved more into 
designing user experiences, I realized that stories helped me 
understand my users better. As I did more and more work, I realized 
that storytelling facilitates communication, that people respond 
emotionally to stories, bond over stories and share stories again and 
again, and that the more I integrated storytelling into my work, the 
better the work was.
So much of what we do isn’t only about the design but about how we 
deal with people, negotiate and plan. Storytelling can be effective in 
all of these situations as well as in driving towards solutions. I think 
the value of stories is independent of the type of experience in which 
they are used.
Question: In the end, business goals (i.e. profit) rule the day. How 
does storytelling tie into this?
Dorelle: Stories help bridge understanding, so storytelling can help 
teams get on the same page and speak the same language — leading 
to expected results. Stories can help people work more collaboratively 
and thus help teams get projects done faster, with a faster time to 
market. Stories can help reframe business problems so that projects 
solve the right problems and come to better solutions.

Dorelle: Cindy Chastain’s article in Boxes and Arrows on Experience 
Themes is a great read.

Curt Cloninger
Curt is an artist and writer. He says his art doesn’t really tell a standard 
narrative with a climax and resolution but rather tries to create a kind 
of event experience.
Question: How do you approach storytelling in UX?
Curt: Design, particularly graphic design, can be understood as a 
visual form of communication, and storytelling is a historically tested 
form of communication. Storytelling or narrative design is more like 
something to keep in mind when considering the user’s experience.

To me, narrative design just means having a consistent “voice” and 
having every design element contribute to the same goal or 
conclusion. It also means allowing for an arc in the user experience. 
And it means allowing the user to have some kind of personal say in 
completing her experience.
This is the difference between a novel (where the user mentally fills in 
lots of visual blanks) and a Hollywood action film (where all the blanks 
are filled in for the user). A novel is arguably more engaging.
Question: In the end, business goals (i.e. profit) rule the day. How 
does storytelling tie into this?
Curt: Hollywood tells stories, and it seems to make a lot of money 
from it. Politicians, journalists and large corporations often tell stories 
(i.e. lies), and they make money. The evolution of any brand over time 
is a kind of narrative.
Corporations spend all kinds of money trying to convince us that their 
characters (e.g. Ronald McDonald) are the good guys. Narrative and 
capitalism have always enjoyed a fruitful relationship.
Question: Where is the best place to learn more?
Curt: I like Nathan Shedroff’s Experience Design book. It’s more about 
“XD” than “UX,” but it addresses narrative at several points 
throughout. Richard Schechner’s Performance Theory is good. It has 
nothing to do with user experience design per se, but it is about

theater, tribal ritual and the cultural interfaces that people construct 
to give meaning to their worlds.
Christian Saylor
Christian is a storyteller who designs user experiences. He believes 
that the things around us have very powerful stories to tell.
Question: How do you approach storytelling in UX?
Christian: Storytelling gives us purpose and a sense of place. So, it 
hasn’t been so much a “discovery” of storytelling as a natural 
progression towards uncovering an experience buried deep within a 
narrative that wants to be told.
78

_____________________________________________________________
This idea of adopting “storytelling” as a means to uncover a rich 
experience for the “end” user, whoever they may be, just makes sense.
At the end of the day, the job of the (UX) designer is to help tell a 
story that is relevant and meaningful, regardless of time, device or 
even location. We use “personas” (characters in our story) and 
“scenarios” (narratives that tell a story about the persona) in order to 
fully understand not only the target audience but also their goals and 
desires, which ultimately helps to create a meaningful experience for 
them.
I strongly believe that everything has a story associated with it. Every 
business, social group, concept, methodology and relationship is 
desperately seeking out better ways to engage with its audience. 
Some just happen to do it on a large scale (Apple), while others 
quietly establish a pattern of life that goes unnoticed until it 
disappears (the remote control). From packaging that sits on the store 
shelf to the applications that follow us throughout our days, story 
influences just about every aspect of our lives. Story is all around us. It 
gives us a sense of understanding and knowledge of the people and 
things that are important to us.
I think the most important aspect of storytelling for me is that it has 
the ability to change the way we view and interact with our world.

Question: In the end, business goals (i.e. profit) rule the day. How 
does storytelling tie into this?
Christian: If you’re telling the right story to the wrong audience, or 
even telling the right story the wrong way, then your business or 
product will ultimately fade away. Design and technology are the 
catalysts of change in the “experience economy.” And if we don’t seek 
out better ways to tell our story, then the vitality of our business, 
product or service will be jeopardized.
As we all know, the business world is constantly looking at the bottom 
line. We live in a world saturated by products and services that vie for 
our attention, and the experience — the way in which a story unfolds 
— will be the difference between a company’s success and failure.
Question: Where is the best place to learn more?
Christian: "Lovemarks (the future beyond brands)" by Saatchi & 
Saatchi. It has unbelievable insight into the way we fall in love with the 
companies and products that surround us.

Question: How do you approach storytelling in UX?
80

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Cindy: Storytelling is another discipline that can be used in the 
context of design as 1) a device, 2) a framework and/or 3) a craft to 
draw upon. In other words, we can use story as a way to capture and 
sell an idea; we can use it as a way to frame an approach to the 
design of a product or service; or we can use narrative techniques to 
craft an interaction and, hence, a variety of behavioral and emotional 
responses to a story.
We tell stories that seek to order chaos, provide meaning and engage 
the emotions of our listeners. We design experiences that hopefully 
do something similar. But in the context of design, meaning is also 
about what this experience, product or service will do for a person. It’s 
about how something fits into or enhances his life. It’s about 
understanding how something is supposed to function.
As designers, we do well at facilitating the dialogue between people 
and the interactive products they use. But we often neglect to 
consider the more intangible layer of experience, the stories that 
evolve dynamically through interactions that people have with the 
things we make.
We also lack an approach to holistic design. If we can learn to 
approach design more like writers approach stories, we will not only 
build richer experiences but start to develop a craft in our work that 
knows how and when certain narrative techniques can be used to 
engage the minds, emotions and imaginations of users. Knowing the 
craft of narrative helps us build better stories, which helps us turn a 
81

set of lifeless features and functions into a whole experience that 
engages the minds and emotions of customers.
Question: In the end, business goals (i.e. profit) rule the day. How 
does storytelling tie into this?
Cindy: Brand message is no longer the thing that sells. Experience 
sells. If the intangible pleasure, emotion or meaning we seek can be 
made tangible through the use of story and narrative techniques, we 
will build more compelling product experiences. And if the experience 
is more compelling, businesses will profit from droves of loyal, 
experience-discerning customers.
Without this understanding, choices about what features should be 
included and how they should behave seem both uninspired and 
disconnected. Sure, we have business goals, user needs, design 
principles and best practices to draw on, but these things won’t get a 
team to a place where it is collaborating in the same conceptual 
space, let alone designing for emotion and meaning.
Question: Where is the best place to learn more?
Cindy: Start with the discipline itself, like Story, Robert McKee’s book 
about screenwriting. For a dive into theory, I recommend Narration in 
the Fiction Film, by David Bordwell, and the classic Computers as 
Theatre by Brenda Laurel. And for the first word on storytelling, read 
The Poetics by Aristotle.

The Storytelling Experiences Around Us
There are many experiences in which storytelling is used to create a 
compelling message that draws users in. The stories are not always 
visible or apparent right away, but underneath many good 
experiences we find great stories. They can appear in a series of 
interactions that tie into a larger story or simply in an emotional 
connection that we form with a product or brand.
In Packaging: Apple
One company the excels at delivering a powerful story is Apple. Laid 
over the image of the iPhone box above is the story arc (introduced in 
part 1) that most screenplays and novels follow. Purchasing an Apple 
product and opening the many beautiful layers of packaging follow a 
similar story arc in building anticipation.
As you move through the process, you find compelling photography 
and clever writing. These build a sort of satisfying tension until you 
finally arrive at the climax of the experience and uncover the iPhone. 
A more common anti-climactic approach would be to wrap the 
iPhone in bubble plastic, reducing the story to a mere “Buy me.”

Designing User Interfaces For Business Web 
Applications
By Janko Jovanovic 
Business Web application design is too often neglected. I see a lot of 
applications that don’t meet the needs of either businesses or users 
and thus contribute to a loss of profit and poor user experience. It 
even happens that designers are not involved in the process of 
creating applications at all, putting all of the responsibility on the 
shoulders of developers.
This is a tough task for developers, who may have plenty of back-end 
and front-end development experience but limited knowledge of 
design. This results in unsatisfied customers, frustrated users and 
failed projects.
So, we will cover the basics of user interface design for business Web 
applications. While one could apply many approaches, techniques and 
principles to UI design in general, our focus here will be on business 
Web applications.
Websites vs. Web Applications
Confusing Web applications and websites is easy, as is confusing user 
interface design and website design. But they are different both in

essence and in so many other ways, which we’ll explore in this article.
A website is a collection of pages consisting mostly of static content, 
images and video, with limited interactive functionality (i.e. except for 
the contact form and search functionality). The primary role of a 
website is to inform. Some websites use content management 
systems to render dynamic content, but their nature is still 
informational.
Web applications, on the other hand, are dynamic, interactive systems 
that help businesses perform business-critical tasks and that increase 
and measure their productivity. Thus, the primary role of a Web 
application is to perform a function that serves the user’s tasks and 
according to defined business rules.
Web applications require a higher level of involvement and 
knowledge of the system on the part of the user. Users don’t just 
stumble upon an application, do their work and bounce off. They use 
it as a tool to perform critical tasks in their daily work. In the end, they 
cannot easily discontinue using the application and switch to another 
if they don’t like how it’s working, as is the case with websites.
Different Types of Web Applications
Business applications range in type from invoicing for freelancers to 
content management systems to document management systems to 
banking and financial systems.

We can distinguish between open and closed applications. Open 
systems are online applications that are easily accessible to anyone 
who opens an account. Users can access such applications via the 
Web and can open an account for free or by paying a fee.
Closed systems (or line-of-business applications) are usually not 
accessible outside of the company that uses it, and they can be 
considered “offline” applications (though many systems expose their 
functionality to business partners via either services or specialized 
interfaces). Such systems usually run on the company’s local network 
and are available only to employees.
I don’t know who coined it, but one term I especially like is 
weblication, which describes what a Web application is in general. This 
doesn’t mean, though, that a Web application is a half-website half-
application hybrid. It is far more complex that that.
First, Know Your Users
You’ve probably heard this a thousand times, and for good reason. A 
successful user interface focuses on users and their tasks. This is key, 
and too many developers have failed to create a good user 
experience. As Steve Krug said, “Developers like complexity; they 
enjoy discovering how something works.”

When identifying your users, keep in mind that clients are not users, 
and you are not a user. Although a client’s management team will 
usually be interested in the project and try to influence decisions, 
remember that they won’t be sitting in front of the computer several 
hours a day (unless the application is specifically for them).
How to Identify Users?
Identifying users can be done using several techniques, such as user 
interviews, business stakeholder interviews and the “shadowing” 
method of observation. Interviews can give you answers to questions 
about the users’ knowledge of the system and computers in general, 
92

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
while shadowing can yield more detailed information about how 
users perform tasks and what errors they make. The method is called 
shadowing because the observer is like a shadow, watching and 
noting the steps a user takes.
If you don’t have access to real users — either because you don’t have 
permission or are designing an open application — you can use 
personas, a tool that helps identify users. Personas are a 
representation of real users, including their habits, goals and 
motivations. Because certain information about users is often 
identified through business analysis, you can make use of it to create 
personas. If you are not familiar with the tool, a comic by Brad Colbow 
will help.
Task analysis helps identify what tasks users perform in their jobs, how 
they do them, how long they take and what errors they make.

_____________________________________________________________
Sometimes clients will be using an old version of the application that 
you are designing to replace. Make use of that old system and watch 
how users use it. Understanding their tasks and challenges will be 
easier that way.
Regardless of who your users are, one thing is certain: in most cases, 
you will have to consider both novices and experts. Novice users 
should be enabled to learn as fast as possible, while expert users 
should be enabled to perform their tasks extremely efficiently. This 
may mean creating separate interfaces. But in many cases you will be 
able to accommodate both types of users in the same interface 
through various techniques, such as progressive disclosure.
Such research is usually done by business analysts. But if no one else 
is responsible for it, you should do it. Once you have the necessary 
information, you can begin with the design.
Design Process
You can follow one of any number of processes in designing the user 
interface. You might already have one. However, I would suggest that 
you consider the Agile approach. Why, you ask? Well, because for 
users (and clients), the user interface is the product. The bottom line is 
that they don’t care about your sketches or fantastic back end or 
powerful server. All they want to see is the user interface.
So, how does Agile help? It helps through its key principle: the 
94

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
iterative approach. Each iteration consists of all of the phases defined 
by your process. This means that at the end of the first iteration, you 
will have a product that can be tested, a prototype.
Sketching
Sketching is a powerful way to explore ideas. The goal is to arrive at 
the solution by sketching different concepts. Most sketches will be 
thrown out, but that is okay. As Bill Buxton says in his Sketching User 
Experience book, sketches are fast to create and easy to dispose of, 
which is why they are so powerful.
95

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Are sketches the same as wireframes? Well, the differences can be 
blurry, but I would say no. Wireframes don’t capture rough ideas but 
rather develop them. Read a fantastic discussion on IxDA: Sketching 
Before the Wireframes.
Once you get the “right” sketches, or at least the ones that you think 
are right, you can create more detailed wireframes or go straight to 
creating interactive prototypes.
Prototyping
The next step in the process is to create prototypes that simulate the 
real application. A prototype can contain one or more features (or all 
of them), but it actually does nothing. It merely simulates the behavior 
of a real application, and users will feel that they are actually doing 
something. Prototypes may contain some functionality if needed 
(such as complex calculations).
Because the nature of a prototype done in HTML is temporary — its 
purpose, after all, is to test ideas — don’t bother with the code; just 
make it work with minimal bugs. You will throw it away anyway. You 
can also use specialized prototyping software. Some people even 
prototype in PowerPoint.
96

_____________________________________________________________
Testing
Prototypes are useless unless you test them. This is not rocket science. 
People like Jakob Nielsen and Steve Krug support so-called “discount 
usability testing,” which is cheap and fast and yields valuable insight 
into your design decisions. You will use this information as the basis 
of another iteration of sketching, prototyping and testing. Do this at 
least until major issues have been fixed. We all know that software 
projects are tight on time and budget, so to be more efficient, test 
early and test often.
One of the best resources for discount usability testing is a new book 
by Steve Krug, Rocket Surgery Made Easy. Pick up a copy and read it.
Design Principles
There are many design principles, but there doesn’t seem to be a 
general consensus on definitive ones. So, we’ll go through design 
principles more informally, leaving out strict definitions.
No One Likes Surprises
Probably the key factors in a good UI are consistency and familiarity. A 
user interface should be consistent across all parts of the application, 
from navigation to color to terminology. This is known as internal 
consistency. But a user interface should also be consistent within its 
context, such as the operating system or other applications in its 
97
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
group or family. A typical example is the applications in the Microsoft 
Office family. This is called external consistency.
A good approach to consistency is to define user interface guidelines 
for each project or group of projects. These should guide the 
decisions you make for all of the details. This will not only maintain 
consistency but also serve as documentation to help team members 
better understand your decisions.
Consistent user interfaces have a shorter learning curve, because 
users will recognize parts of the system and be able to fall back on 
prior experience. But familiarity is sometimes confused with 
consistency. Familiar user interfaces draw on concepts from the users’ 
previous experiences and use appropriate metaphors. Folders, for 
example, are a well-known metaphor for file organization, and they 
have replaced “directories,” which were used previously in command-
line operating systems. In short, speak the language of your users.
A common belief among business owners is that a great user 
interface should look like a Microsoft Office product, especially 
Outlook. I won’t go into explaining how pointless this is. Rather, I will 
offer alternative advice: defend the user-centric approach, and explain 
why creating an application for employees, clients and partners (i.e. 
their users) is so important.
All the same, most businesses are unique, as are their work processes. 
For example, two businesses from the same branch could have 
98

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
significantly different processes, forcing you to go beyond what is 
familiar and start to innovate. This part of the design process can be 
very interesting, although you have to be careful in how much you 
innovate.
Users Should Be Able to Be Efficient
Without a doubt, users should be able to be efficient when using 
business applications. This is what they are paid for, and this is what 
managers expect from the application. User interfaces should allow 
users to be efficient and should focus them on completing tasks in 
the easiest and fastest way.
But this is not always the case. There is an opinion, or at least practice, 
among developers that says the user interface should be as complex 
as the back-end system. No matter how ridiculous this sounds, the 
problem is real and could give you a headache. This is one reason why 
good communication and collaboration between developers are a 
must.
Users are efficient when they focus on a particular task. As mentioned, 
task analysis helps you identify tasks and determines how users 
perform them. If tasks are long, accelerate them by breaking them up 
into smaller units. You can also increase efficiency by providing 
keyboard support and shortcuts. Think how inefficient it is for a user 
to have to switch back and forth between mouse and keyboard. In 
some cases, you will be designing for users who are accustomed to 
99

_____________________________________________________________
working on command-line operating systems and the applications 
made for them. They will be keen to have keyboard support. One 
suggestion: when defining keyboard shortcuts, keep them consistent 
with those of common applications. For example, Ctrl + S should 
always be save, and so on.
Google Docs Spreadsheet enables users to be efficient by providing 
keyboard shortcuts and context menus, as well as by taking advantage 
of users’ familiarity with common desktop applications.
Efficiency can also be enhanced through personalization. Users who 
can personalize an environment will learn it faster and, more 
importantly, will be more confident using it. Personalization can be 
100

_____________________________________________________________
done in many ways: choosing widgets for the dashboard; defining 
shortcut options and favorites; changing the order of elements; etc.
Pay attention to accessibility. Although many assume that accessibility 
doesn’t matter in Web applications, it certainly does. Treat the 
application as if it were a public website.
A Web application also has to be efficient in the speed with which it 
processes information. So, consider heavy interactions that result from 
partial renderings and AJAX requests.
Help!
An interface should provide meaningful feedback that describes the 
state of the system to users. If an error occurs, users should be 
notified and informed of ways to recover. If an operation is in 
progress, users should be notified about the progress.
We can go even further and declare that user interfaces should 
prevent users from making errors. This principle, called forgiveness, 
can be followed with confirmation dialogs, undo options, forgiving 
formats and more. Forgiveness makes it safe to explore the interface, 
decreases the learning curve and increases overall satisfaction.
Because of the complexity of business Web applications, you would 
also need to provide a comprehensive help system. This could be 
done with inline help, a support database, a knowledge base and 
guided tours (which mix video, images and text).

_____________________________________________________________
Can’t Get No Satisfaction
"Satisfaction" is a subjective term that refers to how pleasant an 
interface is to use. Every design principle we have described here 
affects satisfaction. And a few more principles are worth mentioning.
Simplicity is a basic principle of UI design. The simpler a user 
interface, the easier it is to use. But keeping user interfaces for 
business applications simple is a challenge because the apps often 
have a lot of functionality.
The key is to balance functionality and simplicity. Restraint is one of 
the most efficient ways to achieve this balance: i.e. finding the 
simplest way to solve a problem.
Aesthetics, though subjective and somewhat arbitrary, play an 
important role in overall satisfaction. Users respond positively to 
pleasing user interfaces, sometimes even overlooking missing 
functionality. But you’re not creating a work of art. One of the best 
articles that explains aesthetics is In Defense of Eye Candy.
In the end, users will be spending a lot of time in front of the business 
application, and no matter how usable, consistent or forgiving the 
user interface is, satisfaction will be critical in determining how good 
it is.

Essential Components Of Web Applications
Every Web application is unique, but many of them contain common 
features. Although the implementation of any one of these features 
will vary, let’s look at the basic idea of the three most common ones.
Web Forms
Forms in general are important to Web applications. But as Luke 
Wroblewski says in his book Web Form Design, “No one likes filling in 
forms.” That includes sign-up forms in business applications with 
dozens of fields.
Minimize the frustration of filling in forms. Provide inline validation 
and good feedback. Use defaults when possible. Don’t forget about 
novice users. Use wizards to help them complete tasks faster, or use 
progressive disclosure to hide advanced (or infrequently used) 
features.
Master-Detail Views
This is the technique of showing data in two separate but related 
views. One view shows a list of items, while the other shows details of 
the selected item. Master-detail views can be implemented across 
multiple pages or on individual ones.
103
www.ebook777.com

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Dashboards
Many Web applications have dashboards. A dashboard is a view of 
the most important information needed to take action and make 
decisions. It is confined to a single page and is usually the starting 
point of an application. Dashboards are important because they 
enable users to access information and take action without having to 
dig through the application.
Heavy Use of Tables
Because Web applications typically deal with large quantities of data 
that are easily accessible and sortable, tables are unavoidable. But this 
is not a bad thing. In fact, tables were made for this purpose. Don’t 
confuse this with table-less layouts.
Effective tables are easily readable. So, in most cases you will need a 
meaningful header, an optimal number of columns, pagination, 
alternating row colors, proper column alignment, sorting and filtering 
capabilities and much more.
Tables can also be interactive, meaning they are able to generate 
additional info and even modify the data they contain.
Reports
Most businesses work with some kind of reports. Printed reports are 
usually required, so pay attention to the design of reports. Printed (or 
104

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
exported) reports are usually simplified versions of online reports, 
optimized for monochrome printers.
Don’t Forget UI Design Patterns
We’re so used to hearing and talking about UI design patterns that we 
sometimes forget about them! UI design patterns are helpful for 
designing user interfaces. The important thing is to consider them 
early on in the design process, ideally at the sketching stage.
Because patterns often solve common problems, the right pattern can 
facilitate the user’s familiarity with an interface and increase the speed 
at which they learn it.

Case Study: Online Banking Application
To take an example from the real world, I will briefly explain the 
process of designing the user interface for one small bank’s online 
banking system. The team I worked with was hired to improve the 
system. The main reason for the redesign was that, according to 
management, “users complained and many stopped using it.”
After only a couple of hours spent with actual users, the main 
problems were uncovered. Information about accounts and credit 
cards was buried in poor navigation. Understanding how much 
money users were spending and the state of their accounts and credit 
cards was also hard. The application, however, was obvious to bank 
employees; they were familiar with the terminology and could 
interpret the numbers in the application perfectly well.
Give the tight deadlines, we followed the process I have described, 
and we partially succeeded. Despite the short time, the major 
problems were so obvious that we clearly understood our main task 
and how to go about it. We created a dashboard that provided clear 
information on the state of all accounts and credit cards. With this 
new navigation, finding information became easier. Reports were 
easier to understand, and several new features were implemented.
Although we made only a few changes, the changes affected critical 
user tasks and resulted in significant improvements to the overall 
experience.

Final Thoughts
Designing user interfaces for business Web applications is a 
challenging job, full of compromise. You have to make compromises 
between client and user needs; business requirements and users; 
novice and expert users; functionality and simplicity.
It requires a solid understanding of users and their tasks, as well as of 
UI design principles and patterns. Despite the difficulties, the job is 
interesting, and you learn many new things on each project that 
influence the way you design websites.

Progressive Enhancement And Standards Do 
Not Limit Web Design
By Christian Heilmann
Lately I have been getting bored and annoyed with people getting up 
in arms against Web standards and the ideas of progressive 
enhancement, claiming that they hold us back from creating a rich, 
beautiful Web. There are also claims that these tools limit us from 
pushing the boundaries of what is possible with today’s technologies. 
The problem with claims such as these is that they are based on a 
misunderstanding of standards and progressive enhancement and — 
at least to me — on arrogance and ignorance about what our job on 
the Web is. The Web is out there for everybody and is a product and a 
medium like any other.
For example, I am a big film buff and love good movies. I also 
understand, though, that in order to fund great movies we have to 
make money from terrible ones that appeal to the lowest common 
denominator or rehash ideas that were successful in the past.
The same applies to the Web: we need to shift our focus to what 
people use it for and what content should go on it, not how pretty we 
can make it or what cool technology we can apply. The beauty of Web 
technologies is that they can be used to build adaptive products. I 
cannot drive a tall truck through a low tunnel without damaging 
109

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
either the tunnel or the truck. Websites and apps, however, can easily 
make Transformers look clumsy: if we build them adaptively and 
collaboratively with a team of experts.
Shiny New Technologies vs. Outdated Best 
Practices?
Dozens of case studies featuring CSS transformation and animation, 
and demos of the canvas element and HTML5 audio and video that 
“work only in the latest build of browser X,” give us the illusion of a 
Web that could be so much richer and more beautiful. They also lead 
to claims that we are stalling because of the grumpy old people of the 
Web who claim that we have to follow rules and support outdated 
technology. Actually, none of this is about stalling: it is about 
maturing as an industry and embracing the adaptive nature of the 
Web. If you start a design and try to make it work all by yourself, then 
you have not understood the Web and its collaborative nature.
The Mess That Is The Web
Good Web products are the result of successful collaboration. One-
man armies with a limited view of the impact of putting something up 
on the Web lead to a steady stream of mediocre, unsecure, 
unmaintained and hard-to-upgrade Web products. This includes all of 
those websites that look terrible but “do the job,” the very big group 
of websites that are incredibly hard to use but still “communicate the 
110

_____________________________________________________________
brand’s message” and the few that are stunningly beautiful at first 
glance and boring seconds later. Finding a truly usable, accessible, 
beautiful, maintained (and easy-to-maintain) website out there is 
almost impossible.
The reason is that experts tend to advocate for their field of expertise 
as being the most important one, instead of partnering with other 
experts and making both a better offer and subsequently a better 
product.
Creating Celebrities And A Place We
Wish We Were At
We look up to the “rock stars” of Web design, the people who “push 
the envelope,” rather than praise teams that did an amazing job of 
delivering a great Web product in an existing but deficient 
infrastructure. Great technology always happen in environments 
where the designers or developers have full control over the content 
and technology and free reign to build something great.
This is pure escapism, because in the real world you never get any of 
this, unless you build websites for yourself.
It’s frustrating, which is why instead of trying to change our work 
environment and make our mark as Web developers, we escape to 
Awesomeland, where everything is shiny and new and the client-side 
is really popping.

_____________________________________________________________
Returning from a conference at which you’ve glimpsed the future of 
CSS gives you the feeling of being part of something worthwhile. Less 
fulfilling is having to argue with your team to reserve time to write a 
plug-in that ensures your corporate CMS spits out clean, semantic 
HTML instead of a tag soup, or that at least allows you to add a class 
that gives you a style handle to work with. Now guess which in the 
long run will change the game? Probably both, but by fixing the 
underlying infrastructure, we enable cool new technologies to 
become relevant to the mass market.
We can build amazingly fast, low-riding cars that reach top speeds of 
150 mph, but if the roads are full of potholes and crammed with cars, 
then they become little more than toys for rich people who own their 
own racetrack. The same applies to any design showcase in which 
texts are expected to be a certain length and products to be a fixed 
number, and where CSS knowledge is needed to make the website 
look right when you add a product.
This is not how people use the Web, and maintainers should not have 
to depend on experts to make changes to their websites. Websites 
change constantly; this is what makes them interesting and much 
more versatile than, say, print media.
Hollywood And Advertising Teach Us Nothing
A lot of showcases hail movie websites for having the most feature 
richness and visual beauty. Well, try to find websites for older movies 
112

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
and you will see that most are 404 errors or “Not available any more” 
(for example, try to find out what exactly is the Matrix, and you’ll be 
waiting a while). Is this the Web we should be putting our efforts into? 
Is this innovation? Or should we start to work as teams and add our 
unique talents to produce something better and more durable than 
what is merely pretty and what satisfies our own ideas of a great 
website? Isn’t the main premise of Web design something that is 
available to millions of people worldwide and available longer than 
data stored on a cheap CD (whose lifespan is approximately 10 years, 
in case you were wondering)?
The Myth Of Innovating Exclusively Through 
Technology
Know what? In most cases, we are not innovating: this is not the 
revolution; it has been done before.
During the first browser wars, we were in exactly the same boat, and 
people were building things that worked only in certain browsers, and 
they claimed this was the future. I am sure you can guess which 
browser was the worst offender and why we’re having a hard time 
getting rid of it now.
Yes, IE6. A lot of the websites in CSS3 showcases today, especially the 
animated ones, remind me painfully of the IE6 CSS expressions and 
page transition showcases of old. Did you know, for instance, that you 
could rotate text in IE5.5 with the matrix filter? The difference is that, 
113

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
back then computers were so slow that all of these effects looked bad; 
nowadays, on fast computers and shiny iPhones and iPads, they look 
much more impressive. While I am very happy that we don’t use a 
hybrid technology that comes with a boatload of performance issues 
and a syntax that must have been defined in a feverish dream, I am 
also not convinced that the “CSS3″ browser-forking that we do now to 
make websites work in this or that browser is future-proof either.
Innovation Isn’t About New Toys
We generally tend to regard the use of the newest technology as 
“innovation.” This is why you see old problems being solved with new 
technologies over and over again, even though they have already 
been solved. Pure-CSS menus, for example, were newer technology 
but were a step back in usability: you cannot delay the hiding of a 
menu and you cannot test if it will fit the screen before opening it.
For this, you need a technology that has two-way communication: 
you set something and then check that it worked. CSS does not have 
this checking mechanism; we are at the mercy of the browser doing it 
right. With JavaScript we have that option. We also have a sensible 
syntax in JavaScript; whereas CSS, with all of its -browser extensions, 
is slowly but steadily turning into a syntactic nightmare.
CSS has developed some great defensive features: for example, media 
queries, which allow different designs to be served to different screen 
sizes automatically, are wonderful. However, does CSS need all of 
114

_____________________________________________________________
these features, and should we have to wait for universal browser 
support, or would it make more sense to use JavaScript now in 
conjunction with CSS to achieve the same effect? A good CSS 
designer and someone with rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript 
libraries are all it takes. But oh no, why share the fame when we can 
do it with CSS3 alone?
Innovation is not about using the newest technology exclusively. 
Innovation also happens when you combine existing tools and make 
good use of them. Flints were great as spearheads for killing each 
other or skinning animals. Hitting them with another rock or against 
each other all of a sudden gave us fire. No one showed up with a 
lighter to teach people how it works. Instead, we analyzed what we 
had and put it to good use. And guess what? Flints don’t need fuel 
either.
The Corporate Spin On Innovation, And Its 
Consequences
The other thing we should never forget is that every time we innovate, 
some people will one way or another sell these ideas to corporate IT 
half a year later. Most of the time, the innovation is sold as part of a 
bigger software package: “Oh yeah, our CMS package Overpriced-
And-Underspec’ed-otron now supports AJAX… in multiple colors!” 
Sadly, this also happens to be the only time when the innovation will 
have a real impact on the mass market.

If we really think that large corporations or end users care about what 
we do, we’re fooling ourselves. In the end, software and the Internet 
exist to solve the problems of people. And sadly, the people deciding 
on the best solutions are not us but rather those who only go for 
what’s cheapest and seemingly the most secure.
A large company that offers a corporation its software package at a 
fixed price, promising to solve all of the issues plaguing the 
corporation’s daily workflow and to train the people who work with 
the software are selling much more easily than us with our “We will 
help you understand the Web and make it easier for your employees 
to be more effective” pitch. Which sounds like more work for an 
already overloaded IT decision-maker?
The Stockholm Syndrome Of Bad Interfaces
This breeds a lot of ordinary interfaces on the Web that are painful to 
use and terrible to look at. The amazing thing, though, is that people 
love to use them. This is what they learned in corporate training, and 
these are the products supported and endorsed by the company. 
Memorizing five convoluted steps and mechanically going through 
them every time is easier than finding the time to learn new things. 
There is a comfort in knowing how to get the results you are asked to 
get in a predicable way if you really don’t want to use something to 
begin with.

If you don’t want to be one of the people who builds the Web, then 
every change becomes an annoyance — upgrading being one of 
them.
This is why we have outdated set-ups: not because of evil companies 
that refuse to embrace new technologies, but rather because people 
couldn’t be bothered to upgrade because no perceptive gain comes 
from it.
Instead of targeting the people who really prevent the Web from 
evolving and giving them something to consider as a great gain, we 
stay in our comfort zone, talking to each other about pushing the 
envelope and suffering from the wider market not caring.
Want to drive the Web forward? Find a way to disrupt the five-year 
upgrade cycle of corporate environments. Whenever you talk to the 
leading lights of Web design about this, you get an answer like, “This 
is a battle we can’t win.”
This Is Not About Technology Or Design
In the end, we deliver products. We are passionate about the Web, 
and we want to push it forward. The problem is that we stay in our 
comfort zone rather than expand our knowledge:
•
Designers want to push the envelope towards richer 
interaction and more beautiful designs with rich typography.

•
UX people want to make it darned easy for people to achieve 
their goals; and if a pattern works well on the desktop, it 
should also work well on the Web.
•
Engineers push for speed, with “best practices on 
performance” that are relevant to search result pages and Web 
apps like Gmail but not so much to content-heavy websites.
•
Other engineers want to build the most versatile and flexible 
platform ever so that people can use it without ever having to 
bother the engineers again (because they would have already 
moved on to solving other problems).
•
Mobile enthusiasts start to abandon the idea of Web 
technologies as the way forward because the technologies are 
too limited and too far removed from the capabilities of the 
platform.
A lot of these are mutually exclusive, and the latter is especially not 
true and only happens because we as Web developers forgot the 
nature of the Web: a technology stack that adapts to the needs of the 
end user — data that has a clever morphing interface that gives each 
use case the interface it needs. That the Web began as a text platform 
and evolved into a rich media system is great; that we want to replace 
one with the other is just plain wrong or at least very premature.

Where Is The Beauty Of The Web?
Here is the real beauty of Web design: adaptability; interfaces that 
adapt to the needs of the user independent of their technology or 
physical ability. We forgot this for a few reasons:
•
We’re control freaks
We like to control what we do and are afraid of chaos and 
people messing with our products. Sure, we love to be 
disruptive and break conventions, but only when we can 
choose the font-face and colors.
•
We’re bitter
For years, we worked tirelessly to make the Web better and 
more beautiful, and our clients hardly ever cared. We were 
constantly promised to be allowed to build something 
amazing, and then our budgets were cut or we had to move 
on to the next project before adding that last little element 
that would have made it awesome.
•
Cheap thrills
It is easy to draw praise for “thinking outside the box” by 
telling people that progressive enhancement is dead or that 
IE6 should no longer be supported or that everyone you know 
has a 1920-pixel resolution. You get applauded, and people 
look up to you because this is exactly what they want to tell 
their boss every day. But does it help us? Or are we getting 
praise by escaping to our own world?

•
Frustration about the end product
We are hardly ever able to look at a live product and say, “This 
is cool and looks exactly as we planned.” Even worse, after a 
year of maintenance, we are lucky even to be able to recognize 
it as our work. Portfolios are outdated as soon as we put them 
up (I know because I am hiring people right now and cannot 
assess their quality of work that way).
•
Arrogance and ignorance
Our market, our HR practices and even our job boards clearly 
distinguish between designers and developers. Instead of 
challenging this and acknowledging “Web developers” who 
grasp both the user experience and the command line, we are 
content to stay in our own silos.
A developer who claims not to need design input is as useless 
as a designer who doesn’t care about the technical 
implementation of their design. We should encourage each 
other to build the best products through collaboration, and 
not regard each other as show-stoppers or whiners who 
always want it their way.
To Recap: Our Issues
So here are the issues you have to face as someone who wants to 
build great Web products:
•
The technology stack you’re asked to support is unknown.
You can fool yourself into believing that everyone out there is 
120

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
as happy to upgrade and chase after the newest tech, but 
doing it just shows that it’s been a while since you had to 
deliver a real project.
•
Outdated technology is here to stay.
People either are not allowed to upgrade or simply don’t care. 
When I watch TV, I don’t want to know how its internals work, 
and a lot of Web users think this way, too.
•
Your work will be butchered.
The website you plan to build will be changed over the course 
of the project (e.g. the client runs out of money, which always 
happens), and what you do manage to get out will be changed 
over the years to something you never intended to build.
•
You can’t know everything.
When you put a product on the Web, you need to make it do 
the following: work for humans, look pleasing, perform well, 
be secure, be extensible, have the option to be localized to 
different markets and languages, be easy to change and adapt 
and be cheap to run and migrate to another environment. If 
you can do all of that, please send me your CV… on second 
thought, don’t, because I’m sure you’ll be a poor team player.
•
You can’t rely on solutions standing the test of time.
A lot of “great tricks” and “best practices” come with a massive 
price that gets paid a few months down the line. Many 
solutions that were once the bee’s knees are now considered 
bad practice (table layouts, for example, were at one time the 
bulletproof solution for flaky CSS layouts).

_____________________________________________________________
All of this points to a truth that I learned long ago: following 
standards and enhancing progressively means building stuff that will 
not come back to haunt you down the line.
Why Standards Matter, And What “Following 
Standards” Means
Working towards a standard means two things: making it easy for 
others to build on your work, and having a fixed point to start from. 
The thing about standards in any professional environment is that 
they work. They might not be the best or most elegant solution, but 
by sticking to them you are at least delivering a workable solution. 
This is why we standardized screws and print sizes and also why one 
can find boilerplate contracts around.
Products built somewhere else by someone unknown will still be 
maintainable if the developers followed a standard — even if the 
product lacks documentation. I can still put my old lego cars together 
from the parts even though I lost the booklets. If I had sawed off parts 
of the legos or bent them to make them prettier, I wouldn’t be able to 
do that.
By following standards, you are signing an agreement with the people 
who take over from you, saying: no big surprises ahead — I’m a 
professional.
122

_____________________________________________________________
That said, don’t look at standards as a “by any means necessary” 
proposition. Adding ARIA roles to your HTML right now, for example, 
would make the W3C validator complain, but the roles allow people 
to quickly navigate your document without your having to write 
custom keyboard navigation with “skip” links.
Progressive Enhancement Works
Progressive enhancement is not about supporting old platforms: 
anyone who says this totally misunderstands the concept. Progressive 
enhancement means one thing: delivering what can be supported to 
the right platform. This means the following:
•
Including everything that is absolutely necessary for the 
comprehension and functionality of the website in HTML.
Not static HTML, mind you, but HTML rendered by a well-
written back end that gets the data via an API.
•
Keeping the look and feel as much in CSS as possible.
If you need a few HTML elements to achieve a certain look, 
that is not an issue whatsoever. This is actually why we have 
elements like SPAN and DIV. You will find standards zealots 
who frown upon every extra DIV on the page. Tell those 
people to chill out.
•
Enhancing the behavior of the product with a richer 
interactive layer.
This could be CSS for hovers, transitions and animations, or 
123

_____________________________________________________________
JavaScript, or Flash, or Silverlight… heck, throw in Java applets 
if you want. As long as you add them only when appropriate, 
you’re not doing anything wrong.
A great pragmatic example of progressive enhancement in action is 
SWFobject and SoundManager. Instead of putting a Flash movie into 
the document and hoping it works, put a download link to the audio 
or video in the document, add a JavaScript and let the script do the 
rest. It checks whether Flash is supported by the browser and creates 
the right markup for the given browser to embed the audio or video 
only when it is able to be played. Everyone gets to see the movie or 
hear the sound, but only those browsers that can support a player will 
show one.
The main test of good progressive enhancement is this: are you 
offering functionality that you are not sure will work? If not, then 
congratulations: you have built a great Web product. Testing before 
implementation is as obvious as checking the depth of a lake before 
jumping in. There is no magic to it.
One big benefit of progressive enhancement that is often forgotten is 
that by separating the different tasks of a Web product into different 
technologies, you are able to segment the workflow and assign each 
part to a different team.
A progressively enhanced product can be built in parallel by the back-
end team, the front-end developers and the UX and design team. If 
you start with the design and try to trace your way back, you aren’t 
124

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
working together but rather throwing work over a wall and probably 
causing existing code to be changed or even totally re-architected. To 
save time, enhance progressively and measure twice, cut once.
The product cycle should begin with a definition of basic functionality; 
once this is agreed on, all groups can work in parallel and reconvene 
at later stages in an iterative fashion and make the product a bit 
better every time. This also means that if there is an emergency and 
funding gets canned, you can at least deliver a working product. 
Agile, isn’t it?
Best Practices Come From Application And Iterative 
Improvement
To improve our entire market, we have to stop advertising everything 
we do as a “best practice.” Best practices should come from real 
products built by real teams for real clients, with all of the annoyances 
and problems they bring. Test cases that cover all “current” browsers 
are nice, but many more things can throw a spanner in the works 
when we build real products.
So, if you work at a company and managed to implement some cool 
new technology in an existing product or have stories to tell about 
how shifting to a CSS layout saved your client thousands of dollars, 
please write about those. We need tangible stories to tell clients, not 
tales of a bright future.
125

_____________________________________________________________
Furthermore, scrutinize every “best practice” you find in your own 
environment: does it really deliver on its promise? Does something 
need to be added to make it work in the “real world”? Write about 
these add-ons and fixes, adding them as comments to the original 
article.
Together We Can Do This
The last thing I want to bring up here is that I am tired of the debate 
about developer vs. designer vs. project manager. As listed above, real 
Web projects require a lot of different skill sets, and you would be 
hard pressed either to find someone who possesses all of them or to 
find the time to learn them all yourself and stay up to date.
It is all about teamwork, trust, delegation and communication. If we 
stay cooped up in our respective ivory towers and complain that we 
can’t work with the other groups, while pretending that we could do 
their jobs anyway if only people would upgrade their browsers, then 
we shouldn’t be surprised that we don’t get the time and opportunity 
to own and deliver a real Web product, as opposed to some piece of 
software with a Web interface.

Color Theory for Professional Designers
By Cameron Chapman 
Color in design is very subjective. What evokes one reaction in one 
person may evoke a very different reaction in someone else. 
Sometimes this is due to personal preference, and other times due to 
cultural background. Color theory is a science in itself. Studying how 
colors affect different people, either individually or as a group, is 
something some people build their careers on. And there’s a lot to it. 
128

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Something as simple as changing the hue or saturation of a color can 
evoke a completely different feeling. Cultural differences mean that 
something that’s happy and uplifting in one country can be 
depressing in another.

Warm Colors
Warm colors include red, orange and yellow and variations of the 
three. These are the colors of fire, fall leaves and sunsets and sunrises, 
and they are generally energizing, passionate and positive.
Red and yellow are both primary colors, with orange falling in the 
middle, which means warm colors are all truly warm and aren’t 
created by combining a warm color with a cool color. Use warm colors 
in your designs to reflect passion, happiness, enthusiasm and energy.
130

_____________________________________________________________
Red (Primary Color)
Red is a hot color. It’s associated with fire, violence and warfare. It’s 
also associated with love and passion. In history, it has been 
associated with both the devil and Cupid. Red can actually have a 
physical effect on people, raising blood pressure and respiration rate. 
It has been shown to enhance human metabolism, too.
Red can be associated with anger, but it is also associated with status 
(think of the red carpet at awards shows and celebrity events). Red 
also indicates danger (which is the reason stop lights and signs are 
red and why most warning labels are red).
Outside the western world, red has different associations. For 
example, in China, red is the color of prosperity and happiness. It can 
also be used to attract good luck. In other eastern cultures, red is 
worn by brides on their wedding day. In South Africa, though, red is 
the color of mourning. Red is also associated with communism. Red 
has become the color associated with AIDS awareness in Africa due to 
the popularity of the RED campaign.
131

_____________________________________________________________
In design, red can be a powerful accent color. It can have an 
overwhelming effect if used too much in designs, especially in its 
purest form. It’s a great color to convey power or passion in a design. 
Red can be versatile, though, with brighter shades being energetic 
and darker shades evoking power and elegance.
Orange (Secondary Color)
Orange is a vibrant and energetic color. In its muted forms, it is 
associated with Earth and the autumn season. Because of its 
association with the changing seasons, orange can represent change 
and movement in general.
Because orange is also a fruit, it can be associated with health and 
vitality. In designs, orange commands attention without being as 
overpowering as red. It’s often considered more friendly and inviting, 
and less in your face.
132

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Yellow (Primary Color)
Yellow is often considered the brightest and most energizing of the 
warm colors. It is associated with happiness and sunshine. But yellow 
can also be associated with deceit and cowardice (calling someone 
yellow is to call them a coward).
Yellow is also associated with hope, as can be seen in countries where 
yellow ribbons are worn by families that have loved ones at war. 
Yellow is also associated with danger, though not as strongly as red.
In some countries, yellow has very different connotations. In Egypt, 
for example, yellow is for mourning. In Japan it represents courage, 
and in India it’s a color for merchants.
In your designs, bright yellow can lend a sense of happiness and 
cheerfulness. Softer yellows are commonly used as a gender-neutral 
color for babies (rather than blue or pink) and young children. Light 
yellows also give more of a feeling of calm and happiness than bright 
yellows. Dark yellows and gold-hued yellows can look antique and be 
133

used in designs where a sense of permanence is desired.
Cool Colors
Cool colors include green, blue and purple, and they are often more 
subdued than warm colors. They are the colors of night, water and 
nature and are usually calming, relaxing and somewhat reserved.
Blue is the only primary color in the cool spectrum, which means that 
the other colors are created by combining blue with a warm color 
(yellow for green and red for purple). Greens take on some of the 
attributes of yellow, and purple takes on some of the attributes of red. 
Use cool colors in your designs to give a sense of calm or 
professionalism.
Green (Secondary Color)
134

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Green is a down to earth. It represents new beginnings and growth. It 
also signifies renewal and abundance. Alternatively, green can 
represent envy, jealousy or a lack of experience.
Green has many of the same calming attributes as blue, but it also 
carries some of the energy of yellow. In design, green can have a 
balancing and harmonizing effect, and it is stable. It’s appropriate for 
designs related to wealth, stability, renewal and nature. Brighter 
greens are energizing and vibrant, while olive greens represent the 
natural world. Dark greens are the most stable and representative of 
affluence.
Blue (Primary Color)
135
www.ebook777.com

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Blue is often associated with sadness in the English language. Blue is 
also used extensively to represent calmness and responsibility. Light 
blues can be refreshing and friendly. Dark blues are stronger and 
more reliable. Blue is also associated with peace and has spiritual and 
religious connotations in many cultures and traditions (for example, 
the Virgin Mary is generally depicted wearing a blue robe).
The significance of blue depends largely  on its shade and hue. The 
shade of blue you select will have a huge impact on how your design 
is perceived. Light blues are often relaxing and calming. Bright blues 
can be energizing and refreshing. Dark blues are excellent for 
corporate websites and websites where strength and reliability are 
important.
Purple (Secondary Color)
136

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Purple has long been associated with royalty. It’s a combination of red 
and blue and takes on attributes of both. It is associated with 
creativity and imagination, too.
In Thailand, purple is the color of mourning for widows. Dark purples 
are traditionally associated with wealth and royalty, while lighter 
purples (like lavender) are considered more romantic.
In design, dark purples give a sense wealth and luxury. Light purples 
are softer and associated with spring and romance.
Neutrals
137

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Neutral colors often serve as a backdrop in design. They’re commonly 
combined with brighter accent colors. But they can also be used on 
their own and make for very sophisticated layouts. Surrounding colors 
affect the meaning of neutral colors much more than warm and cool 
colors.
Black
Black is the strongest of the neutral colors. On the positive side, it’s 
associated with power, elegance and formality. On the negative side, it 
is associated with evil, death and mystery. Black is the traditional color 
138

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
of mourning in many Western countries. It’s also associated with 
rebellion in some cultures and is tied to Halloween and the occult.
Black is commonly used in edgy designs, as well as in elegant designs. 
It can be either conservative or modern, traditional or unconventional, 
depending on the colors it’s combined with. In design, black is 
commonly used for typography and other functional elements 
because of its neutrality. Black conveys a sense of sophistication and 
mystery.
White
White is at the opposite end of the spectrum, but like black, it works 
well with just about any other color. White is often associated with 
purity, cleanliness and virtue. In the West, white is commonly worn by 
brides on their wedding day. It’s also associated with the health care 
industry, especially doctors, nurses and dentists. White is associated 
with goodness: angels are often depicted in white dress.
139

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
In design, white is often used as a neutral backdrop to give other 
colors a louder voice. It conveys cleanliness and simplicity and is 
popular in minimalist designs. White is also used to represent either 
winter or summer, in conjunction with the design motifs and colors 
around it.
Gray
Gray is a neutral color, generally considered to be on the cool end of 
the spectrum. It can be considered moody or depressing. Light grays 
can be used in place of white in some designs, and dark grays can be 
used in place of black.
Gray is generally conservative and formal but can also be modern. It is 
sometimes considered a color of mourning. It’s commonly used in 
corporate designs, where formality and professionalism are needed. It 
can be a sophisticated color. Pure grays are shades of black, though 
other grays may have blue or brown hues mixed in. In design, gray 
backgrounds are very common, as is gray typography.
140

_____________________________________________________________
Brown
Brown is associated with Earth, wood and stone. It’s a completely 
natural color and a warm neutral. Brown can be associated with 
dependability and reliability, with steadfastness and with earthiness. It 
can also be considered dull.
In design, brown is commonly used as a background color. It’s also 
seen in wood textures and sometimes in stone textures. It gives a 
feeling of warmth and wholesomeness to a design. It’s sometimes 
used in its darkest forms as a replacement for black, in either 
backgrounds or typography.
Beige and Tan
141
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Beige is somewhat unique in the color spectrum, because it can take 
on cool or warm tones depending on the colors around it. It has the 
warmth of brown and the coolness of white and, like brown, is 
sometimes seen as dull. It’s a conservative color in most instances and 
is usually reserved for backgrounds. It also symbolizes piety.
Beige is generally used for backgrounds, often ones with a paper 
texture. It takes on characteristics of the colors around it, minimizing 
its effect on the overall design.
Cream and Ivory
142

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Ivory and cream are sophisticated colors, with some of the warmth of 
brown and a lot of the coolness of white. They’re generally quiet and 
often evoke a sense of history. Ivory is a calm color, with some of the 
pureness associated with white, but a bit warmer.
In design, ivory lends elegance and a sense of calm. When combined 
with earthy colors like peach or brown, it can take on an earthy 
quality. It can also be used to lighten darker colors, without the stark 
contrast of white.
In Brief
While the information presented here might seem just a bit 
overwhelming, color theory is as much about the feeling a particular 
shade evokes as anything else. But here’s a quick reference guide for 
the common meanings of the colors discussed above:
•
Red: Passion, Love, Anger
•
Orange: Energy, Happiness, Vitality

new schemes easier, especially for beginners. Below are the traditional 
schemes, with a few examples of each.

and tints of a particular hue. These are the simplest color schemes to 
create, because they’re all of the same hue, making it hard to create a 
jarring or ugly scheme (though that is still possible).

Here are three examples of monochrome color schemes. For the most 
part, the first color (if we’re looking at the scheme from left to right) 
would be used for headlines. The second would be used for body text 
or possibly the background. The third color would be used for the 
background (or for the body text if the second color was used as the 
background). And the last two colors would be used as accents or in 
graphics.

Analogous
Analogous color schemes are the next easiest to create. Analogous 
schemes consist of three colors that lie next to each other on the 12-
spoke color wheel. Generally, analogous color schemes all have the 
same chroma level, but by using tones, shades and tints we add 
interest and adapt the schemes to our needs.
Examples

This is a traditional analogous color scheme, and while it’s visually 
appealing, there isn’t enough contrast between the colors for an 
effective website design.
Here’s a color scheme with the same hues as the one above, but with 
the chroma adjusted to give more variety. It’s now much more suitable 
for use on a website.
Another example of a traditional analogous scheme.

_____________________________________________________________
This scheme modifies the last one for use on a website.
Complementary
Complementary schemes are created by combining colors from 
opposite sides of the color wheel. In their most basic form, these 
schemes consist of only two colors but can be easily expanded using 
tones, tints and shades. A word of warning, though: using colors that 
are exact opposites with the same chroma and/or value right next to 
each other can be jarring (they’ll seem to vibrate along their border in 
extreme cases). Avoid this, either by leaving white space between 
them or by adding a transitional color between them.
Examples

A wide range of tints, shades and tones makes this a versatile color 
scheme.
Another complementary color scheme with a wide range of chromas.
Don’t forget that beige and brown are really tints and shades of 
orange.
Split Complementary
Split complementary schemes are almost as easy to use as 
complementary schemes. Here, instead of using opposites colors, you 
would use colors on either side of the hue that is opposite to your 
base hue.

Examples
A scheme in which yellow-green is the base hue. In this scheme, having 
enough difference in chroma and value between the colors you select is 
important.
Another palette with a wide range of chromas.
Triadic
Triadic schemes are made up of hues that are equally spaced around 
the 12-spoke color wheel. These make for more vibrant color 
schemes.

_____________________________________________________________
Examples
Using a very pale or dark version of one color in the triad, along with 
two shades, tones or tints of the other two colors, makes the single 
color work almost as a neutral.
Alternately, pairing one very bright hue with muted hues makes the 
bright one stand out more.
Double-Complementary (Tetradic)
Tetradic color schemes are probably the most difficult to pull off.
152

_____________________________________________________________
Examples
A rather unimpressive scheme. The best tetradic schemes use one color 
as the primary color and the others as accents.
Tetradic color schemes with similar chromas and values work well. Just 
add a neutral (such as dark gray or black) for text and accents.
It works just as well for darker color schemes.

Custom
Custom color schemes are the hardest to create. By not following the 
predefined schemes discussed above, you’re abandoning any formal 
rules. Keep in mind things like chroma, value and saturation when 
creating custom color schemes.
Examples
The colors here all have similar chroma and saturation levels.
Again, using colors with similar chroma and saturation is effective and 
creates a sense of cohesion.
154

_____________________________________________________________
Using one color with a high chroma among other colors with lower 
chromas is another effective method (the higher-chroma color serves as 
an accent).
Creating a Color Scheme
Creating your own color schemes can be a bit intimidating. But it’s not 
as complicated as many people think. And you can employ quite a 
few tricks to create great color palettes right from the start.
We’ve gone over the different types of color schemes. Now, let’s try 
creating a few of our own. Plenty of tools are online that will help you 
create a color scheme, but let’s forget about those for now and just 
use Photoshop.
Let’s break away from the types already mentioned and create some 
custom schemes. While knowing how colors interact and how 
traditional schemes are created is important, for most design projects 
you’ll likely create schemes that don’t adhere strictly to any 
predefined patterns.
155
www.ebook777.com

_____________________________________________________________
So, for our purposes here, we’ll create a set of three color schemes for 
two different websites. Our hypothetical clients are a modern 
architecture design blog and a high-end women’s clothing retailer 
that specializes in Victorian-influenced apparel.
We’ll start with a basic monochromatic scheme, just to get a feel for it. 
While traditional color schemes aren’t used as much in design, 
monochromatic color schemes are the exception. You’ll likely find 
yourself using monochromatic schemes on a fairly regular basis.
For our apparel store, here’s a traditional monochromatic scheme, 
with white added as a neutral.
156

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
For our design blog, we’ve gone with a color scheme made up of 
shades and tints of gray.
This is almost an analogous color scheme, but we’ve left out one 
color. It’s made up of shades of purple and reddish-purple. These two 
colors fall next to each other on the color wheel and work well 
together, especially when given different values and saturation levels.
Adding a couple of shades of red to this gray color scheme adds a lot 
of visual interest and the potential to highlight certain parts of your 
design.
157
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Here, we’ve gotten rid of the purple hues and switched to a burgundy. 
Again, this is next to the reddish-purple on the color wheel. We’ve 
also added a very pale yellow tone, which sits opposite purple on the 
color wheel. This serves as our neutral and looks more like an off-
white compared to our other hues.
While this color scheme at first glance looks like another standard 
gray and red palette. However, grays are actually tones of blue. Blue 
and red make up two thirds of a tetradic color scheme, but they work 
just fine together without yellow, especially when the red is pure and 
the blue is toned down to the point of almost being gray.
158

_____________________________________________________________
Why Shades, Tones and Tints Are Important
As you can see from the color schemes above, using tints, tones and 
shades in your color schemes is vital. Pure hues all have similar values 
and saturation levels. This leads to color schemes that are 
overwhelming and boring at the same time.
When you mix in tones, shades and tints, you expand the basic 12-
spoke color wheel to an infinite number of possible colors. One of the 
simplest ways to create a professional-looking scheme is to take a few 
tones, tints and shades of a given color (avoiding the pure hue), and 
then add another pure (or close to pure) hue that is at least three 
spaces away on the color wheel (i.e. that’s part of a tetradic, triadic or 
split-complementary scheme) as an accent color. This adds visual 
interest while still retaining a sense of balance.
Adding in Neutrals
Neutrals are another important part of color schemes. Gray, black, 
white, brown, tan and off-white are generally considered neutral. 
Browns, tans and off-whites tend to make color schemes warmer 
(because they’re really just tones, shades and tints of orange and 
yellow). Gray takes on a warm or cool feel depending on the 
surrounding colors. Black and white also look either warm or cool 
depending on the surrounding colors.
159

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Black and white are the easiest neutrals to add to just about any color 
scheme. To add a bit more visual interest, though, consider using a 
very light or very dark shade of gray instead.
Adding browns, tans and off-white hues is a bit trickier, but with 
practice you’ll find it gets easier. For browns, consider using a very 
dark chocolate brown in place of black. A pale off-white can be used 
instead of white or light gray in many cases. And tan can be used in 
place of gray (create a tone by adding some gray to make it even 
easier).
The Easiest Color Schemes
We’ve touched on this already: adding a bright accent color to an 
otherwise neutral palette is one of the easiest color schemes to create. 
It’s also one of the most striking. If you’re unsure of your skill in 
160

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
creating custom schemes, start out with these types of palettes.
Here are a few examples to give you an idea:
161
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
You can see here how using browns instead of grays makes the entire 
scheme warmer, even with the blue accent color.
You can use tones of any color instead of gray or brown in this type of 
scheme; just keep it close to the gray end of the spectrum for the 
most foolproof results. As a general rule, cool grays and pure grays 
are best for modern designs. For traditional designs, warmer grays 
and browns work better.
How Many Colors?
You’ll notice that throughout this post we’ve used color schemes with 
five different colors. Five is a good number: it gives plenty of options 
162

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
for illustrating the concepts discussed here and it is a workable 
number in a design. But feel free to use more or fewer colors in your 
own schemes.
A lot of websites might have only three colors. Others only two. And 
some might have eight or ten (which is a lot trickier). Experiment, and 
use as many or few colors as you need. But you may want to start 
with a palette of five, and then add or subtract as you see fit and as 
you progress.
The easiest way to add a color is to start with a predefined traditional 
color scheme and go from there. This gives you at lease a bit of 
direction as far as which other colors to consider.
Conclusion
We’ve really only touched on color theory in this article. Specialists 
out there have spent literally years refining their ability to choose the 
appropriate colors for the situation.
The best way to learn how to create beautiful color schemes is to 
practice. Create a scheme every day. You can either start with 
automated tools or just fire up Photoshop and begin. If you come 
across a particularly beautiful or striking color, try creating a scheme 
around it.

Is John The Client Dense or Are You Failing 
Him?
By Paul Boag 
Meet John the client. John runs a reasonably large website. He is a 
marketer who considers himself smart, articulate and professional. 
That said, he doesn’t know much about Web design, and so he needs 
your help. John comes to you with a clear set of business objectives 
and asks for a quote. But what happens next leaves John confused, 
frustrated and extremely unhappy.
Explain Why You Are Asking About Money
Before giving John his quote, you ask a little more about the project. 
After chatting for a few minutes, you ask him about his budget. A fair 
question, you think. After all, you could approach the project in so 
many ways.
Without knowing the budget, knowing where to begin is impossible. 
In your mind, building a website is like building a house. Without 
knowing the budget, you can’t possibly know how many rooms the 
client can afford or what materials you should use to build.
John, on the other hand, is instantly suspicious. Why would you want 
to know about his budget? The only reason he can think of is that you 
165
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
want to make sure you don’t charge him less than what he is willing 
to give. Besides, he doesn’t really know his budget. How the heck is 
he supposed to know how much a website costs?
John leaves, determined to find a Web designer who doesn’t want to 
take advantage of him. Fortunately for you, all of the other designers 
he speaks with also neglect to explain why they need to know about 
his budget, and so you manage to win the project after all.
Justify Your Recommendations In Language John 
Can Understand
Once you have won the job, you arrange a kick-off meeting to nail 
down the specifications. However, John instantly regrets his decision 
to hire you because his worst fears have been confirmed. In his eyes, 
you are all of a sudden trying to squeeze more money out of him as 
you blab on about the importance of usability and accessibility. John 
doesn’t care about disabled users. He doesn’t expect disabled users to 
visit his website anyway.
And as for usability, surely the job of the Web designer is to make the 
website usable. Why do we need expensive usability testing? He is 
pretty certain that usability testing involves expensive things like 
cameras, labs and two-way mirrors. You thought you had explained 
these issues clearly. You spoke of WCAG 2, and you mentioned Jakob 
Nielsen. You are beginning to wonder if John is a bit thick.
166

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Perhaps if you had talked about accessibility in terms of assessing 
search engine rankings and testing usability as a way to increase 
conversion, then John might have listened. As it is, John puts his foot 
down and refuses to pay for any of these “unnecessary extras.”
Include John In The Process
You walk away from the kick-off meeting pleased to have a signed 
contract. But that feeling in the pit of your stomach tells you that this 
might be another one of those projects. Regardless, you try to be 
optimistic, and you dive into the design process. Almost immediately, 
you get a phone call from John asking if there is anything for him to 
see. You explain that it is still early in the process and that you are not 
ready to present anything. John sounds disappointed but resigned.
A short while later, you are ready to present the design to John. You 
are pleased with the result. It took you a lot more time than you had 
budgeted for, but it was worth it. The final design is extremely easy to 
use and will make for a great portfolio piece.
When John sees the design, he is horrified. From his perspective, you 
have entirely missed the point. The design clashes with his offline 
marketing materials and doesn’t hit the right selling points. Also, he is 
convinced that his suppliers will hate it and, although they are not his 
end users, their opinion matters.
167

_____________________________________________________________
After a tense conference call, you feel demoralized but have struck a 
compromise that hopefully will make John happy. You wonder in 
hindsight whether showing John some of your initial ideas and 
sketches would have been better. Perhaps you should have presented 
a wireframe first.
Educate John About Design
After much agonizing and compromise, you are once again ready to 
present to John. John is much happier with the new design and feels 
it is heading in the right direction. However, he does have some 
concerns. For starters, he has to scroll to see most of the content, and 
yet white space takes up either side of the design. He tells you to 
move key content into this wasted space. Also, as he thinks about his 
young male target audience, he realizes that the color scheme is too 
effeminate, so he tells you to change it to blue.
While John feels somewhat happier, you feel crushed. You feel as 
though he is trying to do the job for you. The instructions to move 
this there and change this color to that makes you feel like you have 
been reduced to pushing pixels.
By this point, you are sure the client is dim, and now you just want 
him to sign off on a design. At no stage do you think to ask John why 
he is requesting these changes. Perhaps if you had appreciated his 
thinking, you could have explained concepts such as screen resolution 
and suggested an alternative to corporate blue, which is so over-used 
168

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
on the Web. Instead, you wash your hands of the design and just give 
John what he wants.
Communicate With John Regularly
Now that the design is complete, you turn your attention to building 
it. John certainly won’t care about your code. Now you can finally do 
things right.
It’s a big job and takes a lot of time. Even though you put too much 
time into the design and washed your hands of it, you still have your 
pride. You are not about to cut corners with the code. After all, other 
designers might look at it and judge you!
You work really hard, putting in more work than you probably should 
have. John even manages to slip in some extra functionality at the 
scoping phase, which turns out to be a pain in the butt.
For his part, John is wondering what’s going on. He hasn’t heard from 
you in weeks. Surely the website must be ready now? He decides to 
email you to ask how things are progressing. You reply with a short 
email telling him that everything is progressing smoothly. You never 
did like project management, and you are sure John would prefer that 
you spend time building his website instead of writing him detailed 
reports.
169
www.ebook777.com

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
John receives your email and is becoming increasingly frustrated. 
What does “progressing smoothly” mean? He writes back asking for 
an expected date of completion, and you reply with a rough estimate.
The date comes and goes without a word from you. After all, it was 
merely an estimate, and several complications have delayed 
completion by a few days. John finally loses his temper and calls you. 
He tells you that he has arranged a marketing campaign to coincide 
with the launch date, and because he hadn’t heard from you, he 
presumed everything was on schedule.
You defend yourself, citing “scope creep” and unanticipated delays. 
But responding is difficult when John says, “All I needed was a weekly 
email keeping me up to date on progress.”
Explain John’s Ongoing Role
By this stage, the relationship has broken down entirely. You finish 
your work, and the website finally launches. Begrudgingly, John pays 
the invoice after delaying it for as long as possible. What amazes you 
most is John’s pronouncement that he is bitterly disappointed with 
the result. How can that be when you gave him exactly what he asked 
for? This guy isn’t just thick: he’s a jerk!
Of course, John sees things differently. He came to you with a list of 
his business objectives, and the website has failed to meet any of 
them. He had hoped to launch the website, watch it achieve his 
170

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
objectives and then move on to the next project. Instead, after an 
initial spike in interest, the number of users and inquiries dropped 
over time, and the website stagnated.
What John does not realize is that websites need continued love and 
support. You cannot build a website and then abandon it. John has to 
nurture it by adding new content, engaging with visitors and planning 
for ongoing development. If only someone had told him.
The Moral Of The Story
It’s amazing how quick we are to judge our clients. As Web designers, 
we communicate and empathize for a living. Our job is to 
communicate messages to our clients’ users. We create usable 
websites by putting ourselves in the position of our users, which 
allows us to design around their needs.
Why, then, do we so often seem incapable of empathizing or 
communicating with our clients? Perhaps it is time for us to apply the 
skills we have cultivated as Web designers to our own customers.

How To Identify and Deal With Different 
Types Of Clients
By Robert Bowen 
In business, being able to read people and quickly get a sense of who 
you’re dealing with is an invaluable skill. It turns your encounter with a 
client into an opportunity to catch a glimpse of the upcoming project 
and how it will need to be handled. It is one of the building blocks of 
a professional relationship.
In today’s digital age, the arena has shifted to the Web, and the online 
office space that most freelancers inhabit limits personal interaction. 
Though sussing out a client’s personality via online communication is 
difficult, it still remains an invaluable tool in your arsenal.
In the freelancing field, you will encounter a range of client types. 
Being able to identify which you are dealing with allows you to 
develop the right strategy to maximize your interactions with them, 
and it could save your sanity. Below is a list of the most common 
personality types and the tell-tale signs that will tip you off.
The Passive-Aggressive
This is the client who is very passive when you ask for initial input, but 
when you submit the finished product, they aggressively attack it, 
173
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
demanding a lot of detailed changes, both major and minor. They had 
an idea of what they wanted all along but kept it mostly to 
themselves. Even though they showed appreciation of certain ideas 
and elements throughout the development process, do not expect 
the passive-aggressive client to keep any of them as they send 
revisions your way.
Identifying Characteristics
•
Communication is mostly one-sided and unhelpful during 
project development.
•
Makes statements such as:
•
“I’m not really sure what we’re looking for.”
•
“Just do something that would appeal to us generally.”
•
“You totally missed the point of what we wanted.”
How to Deal With It
Patience is key. Expecting the last-minute requests for revisions may 
soften the blow of the client’s aggressive behavior. Keep your original 
layered design intact so that you can easily refine and change it later 
(not that you wouldn’t, but it does happen). Also, make sure your 
contract specifies a limited number of revisions.
174

_____________________________________________________________
The Family Friend
This is the client whom you have known for years either through 
personal or family interaction, and this connection has landed you the 
job. The relationship will be tested and perhaps marred forever by 
what could very well be a nightmare of a project. This family friend 
believes he deserves a “special” price and unbridled access to your 
work. They will sometimes unwittingly belittle your work or not take it 
seriously because of their personal connection to you.
Identifying Characteristics
•
These clients are easy to identify because… well, you know 
them.
•
Makes such statements as:
•
“Could you just throw something together for me?”
•
“I don’t want you to think that just because I know you 
I want you to cut me a deal.”
•
“You’re going to charge me what?! But we go way 
back!”
How to Deal With It
The way to deal with this client depends on how well you know them 
and how much you value your relationship with them. But remember 
that anyone who would take advantage of such a relationship is not 
175
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
truly a friend, so respond accordingly. An honest approach could end 
up saving the relationship. But start off with a professional, not 
personal, tone, and they may follow your lead. Of course, if you truly 
value the relationship, you may want to pass on the job altogether.
The Under-Valuer
Like the family friend described above, this client devalues your 
creative contributions. But there is a difference: you do not actually 
know this person. There is no rationale for their behavior. They feel 
they should get a “friend’s” pricing rate not because they want to be 
friends with you, but because they do not see your work as being 
worth that much… even if they couldn’t do it themselves. Not coming 
from a creative background or even having had exposure to the arts 
can mar someone’s appreciation of the work that you do. After years 
in our field, we make it look easy, and that is what the under-valuer 
sees.
Identifying Characteristics
•
Does not respond to questions in a timely fashion.
•
Makes such statements as:
•
“It’s not like it takes much effort on your part.”
•
“Couldn’t you just throw something together for me?”
•
“How hard can this really be?”
176

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
How to Deal With It
Confidence is key here. You know what your work demands and how 
well you do your job. The under-valuer will recognize this confidence. 
Don’t back down or concede a point to the client when discussing 
your role in the project. Standing firm will establish the professional 
and respectful tone you deserve. If the client does not respond in 
kind, cut your losses and decline their project.
The Nit-Picker
This client is never fully satisfied with the work you do and constantly 
picks on minor details here and there that they dislike and want 
changed. Do not be surprised if they ask you to change these same 
details over and over ad nauseam. It is not a sign of disrespect (as it is 
with the other clients), but simply the nature of the person. They may 
have been burned in some other project and are now unsatisfied with 
everything in their path, including your work.
Identifying Characteristics
•
Complains almost constantly about unrelated things.
•
Personal outlook comes with a scathing bite.
•
Makes such statements as:
•
“How hard is it really to [fill in the blank with any rant]?”
177
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
•
“I’m not sure about this element here. It just doesn’t 
pop!”
•
“I don’t think you’re really getting it.”
How to Deal With It
Once again, patience is important (especially if you have some sadistic 
reason for taking on nit-picking clients). Try to detach yourself from 
the project as much as possible, so that the constant nit-pickery does 
not affect you personally. It is easy to feel hurt or get defensive when 
your work is repeatedly questioned, and you may begin to doubt your 
skill. But understand that this is not about you or your talent; it is 
simply a personality trait of the person you are dealing with. And once 
again, protect yourself in the contract.
The Scornful Saver
This client has similarities to the nit-picker and under-valuer but is 
actually impressed with your work and skill set. They criticize you 
merely to undermine your confidence in an attempt to lower your 
pricing rate. Unlike some other client types, the scornful saver 
understands creative people and their processes. But they are cheap 
and manipulative, and their scheme may have worked in their favor 
once or twice in the past. So, they continue to subtly abuse the 
people they hire in the hope of saving every last penny.

_____________________________________________________________
Identifying Characteristics
•
Compliments always come with a less-than-flattering qualifier.
•
Takes time to respond to questions, sometimes making you 
ask more than once.
•
Makes such statements as:
•
“I really like what you’ve done overall, but I’m unsure 
about one or two things.”
•
“You may not have gotten exactly what we’re looking 
for, but you’re close.”
How to Deal With It
Once again, it is all about confidence. Having a solid understanding of 
your field and being confident in your knowledge and abilities will 
keep this client’s manipulation in check. Standing your ground and 
even calling the client on some of their tactics could shift the balance 
of power over to you. Be prepared to walk away from the project if 
the disrespect and manipulation continues. There will be other 
projects and other clients.
The “I-Could-Do-This-Myself”-er
Where to begin… When this client farms a project out to you, they 
make clear to you that they know how to do what they’re hiring you 
to do but they just don’t have the time to actually do it. They may be

working at a firm or as an entrepreneur; either way, you are there to 
pick up their slack. If they’re at a firm, you could be in for an 
interesting situation; they were likely hired for their particular style 
and proposals, and now you will have to please two sets of people: 
the person who hired you and the people who hired him.
Identifying Characteristics
•
Will generally be (or look) hectic and rushed.
•
Communication from them often takes the form of short 
bursts of information.
•
Makes such statements as:
•
“I could easily handle this if my schedule weren’t so 
full.”
•
“Really? Not sure that’s the direction I would’ve gone in, 
but whatever.”
•
“Remember, you are filling my shoes, and they’re pretty 
big.”
How to Deal With It
The “I-Could-Do-This-Myself”-er will likely have recognized your 
talent and skill right away, which is why they hired you. They merely 
want you to know that this project (and thus you) is not above their 
ability. And though these reminders will grate on you periodically,

they will let you run with your ideas, perhaps offering suggestions or 
feedback on the final design.
The Control Freak
This client desperately needs to micro-manage every little detail of 
the project, no matter their qualifications. No decision may be made 
without their explicit input and approval. This tiresome person forces 
himself into your workflow, heedless of either invitation or protest, 
and demands access to you at whim. The concepts of boundaries and 
strict work processes are easily lost on the control freak, who 
constantly disrupts the flow. They may also believe you lack 
dedication or preparedness, further reinforcing their need to interfere.
Identifying Characteristics
•
Initial contact is long, detailed and one-sided, with little input 
sought from you.
•
Your input remains unsought as the project pushes forward.
•
Makes such statements as:
•
“This way we can keep in contact 24/7 in case you have 
any questions, or I do.”
•
“I really know best what is right for the project and 
what is not.”

•
“What do you mean, I’m distracting you? I am the only 
thing keeping this project on track!”
How to Deal
If you absolutely must take on this client, for whatever reason, resign 
yourself to the fact that you will not be steering at any point. You will 
have to detach yourself from the work because you will have no 
control at all. You will merely be constructing, not designing, so just 
let go and let it happen. You may want to exclude this project from 
your portfolio.
The Dream Client
This client, widely dismissed as a myth, does in fact exist and 
understands the full scope and artistry of your work. They value your 
role and creative contributions and want you in the driver’s seat as 
soon as the project gets underway. They are timely with responses 
and payments… payments that they did not “negotiate” but rather 
accepted for what they are. They reflect on your suggestions and have 
confidence in your capabilities.
Identifying Characteristics
•
Is enthusiastic about the project and your involvement in it.
•
Communication shows awareness of and respect for your role.

How to Deal
Don’t brag! Just enjoy the ride and hold on to them for as long as you 
possibly can!
Wrap-up
Being able to identify the type of client you are dealing with will 
prepare you for the job ahead. It will also help you decide whether to 
accept the job in the first place. Your contract will reflect the power 
dynamics of the project, so the more you know about the client, the 
better able you will be to adjust the contract as necessary. Have you 
come across other types of clients in your freelancing career? Please 
let us know in the comments.

How To Respond Effectively To Design 
Criticism
By Andrew Follett 
Winston Churchill once said: “Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is 
necessary. It fulfills the same function as pain in the human body. It 
calls attention to an unhealthy state of things.” Regardless of where 
you work or who you work for, being able to take criticism is part of 
the job. Whether you’re getting feedback from your boss or a client, 
having a proper perspective on criticism and a sound understanding 
of how to use it effectively is important.

_____________________________________________________________
Unfortunately, not many people enjoy criticism. In fact, many have 
developed a thick skin and take pride in their ability to brush it off 
and move on. However, despite its negative connotation, criticism 
often presents an excellent opportunity to grow as a designer. Before 
you can respond effectively, you need to understand what those 
opportunities are.
Let’s look at some important aspects of getting constructive criticism:
•
Uncover blind spots
Doing your own thing is easy, but your habits will eventually 
185
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
become deeply ingrained and hard to break. Criticism gives 
you a vital outside perspective on your work, uncovering 
potential areas for improvement that you are unable to see by 
yourself.
•
Challenge yourself
Feedback challenges you to be a better designer. Rather than 
settle for your own standards, you are pushed to take your 
work to the next level.
•
Develop communication skills
If nothing else, dealing with a critic can dramatically improve 
the way you communicate — an essential skill for any 
successful design career.
•
Outside motivation
Constructive criticism often gives you the kick in the butt you 
need to learn a new design skill or technique. Self-motivation 
is great, but everyone could use a hand from time to time.
•
A lesson in humility
Never underestimate the importance of humility. Although 
criticism can bruise the ego, it keeps you grounded, making 
you easier to work with and more open to learning from 
others.
A positive view of criticism isn’t enough. You also need to know how 
to respond effectively when it comes. Here are eight tips you can use 
to start making the most of criticism today.
186

_____________________________________________________________
Have The Right Attitude
Design is subjective and, like any art form, has no rulebook. No one 
can tell you what is “right” and “wrong” with your work, but that 
doesn’t mean you can completely ignore your boss or client’s opinion 
either. However, by taking criticism and feedback with the right 
attitude, you can use it to your advantage and even enjoy it.
Everyone looks at design through a filter shaped by personal 
experience, and this filter is usually very different from your own. 
While you may have a degree in design and 10 years of experience, 
not everyone will agree with your “expert” opinion, so don’t expect 
them to. The important thing is to have a proper attitude from the 
beginning. Expect others to disagree with you, and be open to new 
perspectives. Align your expectations and understand that criticism is 
part of the process. While harsh criticism can cut deep and even scar, 
it can also motivate, instruct and do all of the good things mentioned 
above.
Last, but not least, try to remove yourself from the criticism and view 
it as a commentary on your actions or work and not as a personal 
attack. While easier said than done, this distinction is key to 
responding effectively. If you can rise above the criticism and respond 
calmly and effectively, you will not only earn the admiration of your 
critic but feel better doing it. Set the right expectations, understand 
the benefits, remove yourself from the equation, and remember, 
attitude truly is everything.

_____________________________________________________________
Understand The Objective
Clearly identifying the goal of a design before you share it with others 
is always a good idea. Are you showing it off to mom for some fridge 
time? Is it a client who’s trying to solve a business challenge through 
design? Or perhaps you’re consulting a friend with no experience or 
stake in the project.
Regardless, a vague or confused objective will always elicit off-target 
feedback, so make sure everyone involved “gets it” before taking 
action. To respond effectively to criticism, you need to be sure that the 
critic understands your goals. Be specific. Present your objective in 
clear and concise terms; the criticism you receive will be targeted and 
actionable as a result.

_____________________________________________________________
Check Your First Reaction
For most people (me included), the first reaction to criticism is to get 
defensive or even lash out. If this sounds like you, take time to 
develop the habit of taking a deep breath and counting to 10 before 
responding. This simple yet effective method gives you a chance to 
regain composure and allow logic to prevail over emotion. The last 
thing you want to do is get overly emotional and give a response that 
you will later regret. Remember, in most cases, your critic is only 
trying to help you.
Despite the initial sting, you need honest feedback to become a 
better designer. This is especially important for enthusiasts or 
beginners in the trade. All visual arts have an intrinsic reward 
mechanism: the more you create, the more you sense the progression 
of your skill.
It’s a loop that keeps all artists going, and when this euphoric 
moment is crushed by accurate and much-needed criticism, 
recovering may be difficult. Keep in mind, though, that your skill and 
perceptiveness in this field will mature over time. If you have the right 
attitude to begin with, the proper response will follow.
Separate Wheat From The Chaff
Unfortunately, not all criticism is constructive. Some people are in a 
bad mood, bitter or just plain negative and will take any chance to put 
190

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
others down. Some are also inexperienced or unqualified to give you 
valuable feedback. While design is subjective, being able to separate 
useful feedback from cheap shots and misinformation is important. 
However, this is not an excuse to ignore comments that you don’t like. 
Unless you believe a critique was given in malice or ignorance, don’t 
be quick to dismiss it.
Here are a few tips to distinguish between the two:
•
Specific.
Valuable feedback is always specific. It is clear, logical and 
defined. “The logo is ugly” or “I don’t like the color choice” are 
examples of useless criticism (if you get a lot of this, see #7 
below).
•
Actionable.
Constructive criticism should enable you to take immediate 
action. You should come away with a clearer idea of how to 
improve the concept and the path to follow.
•
Objective.
Useful feedback is unbiased. It gives you a unique perspective 
without an ulterior motive. Objective criticism will always be 
even-tempered and appropriate.
Learn From It
This step is possibly the hardest one in this learning experience but by 
far the most important. For criticism to serve its purpose, you need to 
191
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
act on it! Don’t just go back to business as usual; make an effort to 
improve. The great thing about criticism is that it uncovers our blind 
spots, weaknesses that only others can see. When you’re confronted 
by criticism, don’t let the opportunity pass: write it down and do 
whatever it takes to change for the better.
If someone criticizes your copywriting skills, start with baby steps. 
Read a relevant blog once a week. Buy a book. Practice writing 
headlines for 10 minutes each day. Small victories are often the 
quickest path to success. Eventually you will improve and have your 
critic to thank.
Look For A New Idea
If you can’t learn anything new, look for a new idea. A different 
perspective gives you a chance to examine your work from a 
viewpoint that you would never have considered otherwise. Just as 
you get inspiration from a gallery or another talented designer, you 
can find ideas and inspiration in constructive criticism; seeing it just 
requires you to step back. Be curious, and approach the criticism 
objectively; it could be incredibly useful.
Criticism is sometimes the cold shower you need to wake up and hit 
the “Reset” button on a project. Remember, your work is based on 
your own preconceived notions of what the client wants, and you 
should always be open to the possibility that you have missed the 
mark. In the event that you do need to start over, discuss the 
192

_____________________________________________________________
objectives and expectations right away. Clarifying this information in 
the first place could have prevented a re-do altogether.
Dig Deeper When Necessary
At some point, everyone has received vague, unclear or unactionable 
feedback. It’s a part of life. Unfortunately, unless you take the 
initiative, this type of feedback is more or less useless to everyone 
involved. However, if you’re willing to dig a little deeper, you may 
uncover things that no one else was willing to tell you. Start by asking 
open-ended questions that get to the core of the issue, questions like, 
“I want to understand your point of view. Could you please provide 
more detail?” or “How can I improve?” Ask for specifics and, above all 
else, honesty. These kinds of questions will help keep communication 
lines open and allow you to walk away with practical and concrete 
advice.

_____________________________________________________________
If you feel uncomfortable asking your critic for more detail, or if they 
are unwilling to provide it, approach someone you respect and trust 
and ask them what they think. Do they agree with the criticism? Why 
or why not? Assuming this person is honest and knowledgeable, you 
should be able to get the answers that you need to move forward.
194

_____________________________________________________________
Thank The Critic
Whether the criticism you receive is genuine or downright rude, make 
a point of saying “Thank you.” Thanking even your harshest critics can 
create a lasting impression, keep you humble and open the door to 
additional feedback in the future. Expressing gratitude will also make 
you feel better about the experience and help you alleviate any innate 
avoidance of feedback and criticism you may have. If you have 
followed the guidelines above and recognize the true value of the 
criticism you have received, saying “Thank you” shouldn’t be too 
difficult.
If you respect the person and their opinion, go one step further and 
develop a long-term mentoring relationship with them. Much like in 
the old days of craftsman and apprentice, an individual whose opinion 
you value and hold in high esteem can go a long way in developing 
your skills and abilities. If nothing else, a mentor can keep you 
accountable to your work and help you continually improve.

action? Let us know!

Web Designer’s Guide to Professional 
Networking
By Steven Snell 
Professional networking is a critical component to a successful career 
as a designer. Whether it be for finding new clients or identifying 
opportunities for growth and improvement, a strong network of 
contacts is extremely valuable. In this article, we’ll take a detailed look 
at the subject of networking, the benefits it presents and tips that can 
be used in your own networking efforts.
Networking involves building connections and relationships with 
people from various backgrounds and professions, including other 
designers and developers. This article was written with Web designers 
in mind, but the principles are generally applicable to any profession 
— although the specifics may vary.
Why Network?
If you haven’t been actively involved in networking, you may be 
wondering why you should even bother with it. Before we get into the 
tips and suggestions for networking, let’s take a look at some of the 
benefits.
196

_____________________________________________________________
Referrals
Word-of-mouth advertising is a leading source of business for many 
designers. Simply put, if more people know about you and your 
services, you’ll have more opportunities for referrals. By getting 
connected and staying in touch with those in your network you will be 
on their mind when someone they know is in need of the services that 
you provide. A potential client who gets a personal recommendation 
from someone who knows you or has worked with you will be much 
more likely to become a paying client than someone with another 
type of lead.
Much of the networking done by designers is with others who offer 
the same or very similar services. Obtaining referral business through 
a network of designers is more common than you might think. 
Although your services may have some overlap with another designer 
in your network, you’re each going to have some unique strengths 
and weaknesses, as well as varying levels of experience with different 
types of clients. Additionally, there could be some types of work that 
others simply don’t like to take, or situations where schedules and 
deadlines make it impossible for a designer to work with a particular 
client. In situations like these, it’s very common for the designer to 
recommend a friend or colleague.
Collaborations
Especially for freelancers and independent designers, having a strong 
network opens up countless possibilities for collaborating. This could 
197
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
be a one-time thing that arises from the needs of a particular project, 
or it could be an ongoing collaboration. Ideally, your network will 
include a number of people who have skills that complement yours. 
This will allow you to work with others and each focus on what you do 
best.
Problem-Solving
If you trust and value the people in your network, you will not hesitate 
to turn to them when you need some advice or help with a problem. 
Do you know someone who has been through a similar situation and 
could give you some advice from their own experience? For designers 
and developers, this could be a technical issue, such as dealing with a 
coding challenge or determining the best solution to a client’s needs, 
or it could simply be a need for guidance in some aspect of running a 
freelance business.
Stack Overflow is a collaboratively edited question-and-answer 
website where programmers can solve problems and network.

_____________________________________________________________
Future Opportunities
A professional who is well-connected will typically have more 
opportunities than a comparably skilled professional who is not well-
connected. You may have no pressing reason today for a strong 
network of contacts, but you could run into a situation in future when 
having others you can count on would be invaluable.
For freelance designers, maybe you don’t want to freelance forever, 
and when you’re ready to start looking for employment the process 
will be much easier if you already have an established network that 
knows you and your quality of work. Yes, you could wait to do your 
networking when you’ve officially stopped freelancing, but you’ll be 
better off if you have some established relationships before then.
Help Others
So far, everything we’ve discussed has focused on what your network 
can do for you, but true networking is not one-sided. One of the 
benefits of being well connected is that you will have plenty of 
opportunities to help others. Perhaps you won’t be the freelancer who 
is looking for employment, but maybe you will be the contact who 
puts a freelancing friend in contact with someone who’s looking to 
hire a designer.

_____________________________________________________________
Friendships
Aside from all of the professional benefits, networking can be a fun 
way to meet new people and build friendships. This can be especially 
valuable for freelancers and others who work from home. Networking 
may be one of the few opportunities you have to interact with other 
professionals in your field — not being able to go to an office every 
day to interact with co-workers.
Networking Tips for Designers
Now that we have looked at some benefits of networking, here are 
some tips you can put into practice.
Be Accessible
One of the keys to being well connected is making it possible for 
others to reach you. Sure, networking is about your efforts to meet 
others, but it also involves being accessible when people want to get 
in touch with you. This could include having a contact form or email 
address on your portfolio website, being involved at social networks, 
linking to your social profiles from your portfolio and responding to 
people when they reach out to you.
Seek Mutual Benefit
The most successful types of networking relationships are the “win-
win” ones — in which both parties benefit in one way or another. If 
200

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
you want networking to have a major impact on your business or 
career, make the effort to find opportunities for mutual benefit. These 
situations will encourage both parties to keep the relationship strong 
and improve it in any way possible, bringing results that could not be 
accomplished individually.
Finding win-win situations is not easy, but they will present 
themselves when you get to know others very well and you all can see 
each other’s unique strengths, abilities and opportunities. These types 
of networks will more likely lead to stronger, long-lasting 
relationships.
Blog
Many designers maintain a blog on their portfolio website or other 
domain. Blogging is not only effective in attracting potential clients 
but is also a great way to get involved with other designers and build 
a network. Blogging is personal in nature and involves two-way 
communication, making it extremely conducive to interaction. 
Bloggers tend to read other blogs as well, and the design blogging 
community is very active. Blogging is a great way to get exposure and 
open up opportunities to meet other professionals.
Focus on Depth of Relationships
Like just about anything else in life, quality is better than quantity. 
While having connections with a wide variety of people is good, you’ll 
201
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
find that your most significant benefits from networking come from 
your closest relationships. As you connect with people, get to know 
them on more than a superficial level. The people with whom you 
build strong relationships will likely become part of the “inner circle” 
that you reach out to on a consistent basis.
Be Proactive
Don’t sit back and wait for others to approach you. Get involved in 
social networks, go to local networking events, attend seminars and 
approach people who you’d like to get to know. If you’re at an event 
or using an online social network, the other people are there for the 
same reasons as you — so don’t be intimidated by the thought of 
approaching them.
This could also include commenting on design blogs, participating in 
forums and writing guest articles. Your network will be a valuable part 
of your career, so be proactive and work to make it something special.
Know What You’re Looking For
If you’re proactively getting to know other professionals, it helps to 
know what you’re looking for in potential contacts. This allows you to 
identify the right people to approach, making your networking efforts 
more effective and efficient. For example, if you’re a student who will 
be graduating in a year and looking for a job as a designer, it would 
be beneficial to connect with people who run design studios or 
202

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
people who work at places that may be hiring designers. If you’re a 
designer who doesn’t do any development work, it would be 
beneficial to know some good developers who you could team up 
with on projects.
Think of your strengths, weaknesses and situation. Who or what 
would help you get to where you want to be? Identify people who are 
in these ideal positions and get to know them.
Know What You Have to Offer
Just as important as knowing what you’re looking for in others, you 
should also be aware of what you can offer others and why you would 
be a valuable member of their network. Think about what is unique 
and special about your skills and the opportunities you could present 
to others.
Of course, this doesn’t mean you should go around telling everyone 
exactly what you can offer them and why they need you; but having a 
clear sense of your own worth helps you identify ideal situations of 
mutual benefit and how to present yourself in ways that make you 
stand out.
Network Indirectly
Some of your best contacts will not be people who you actually need 
to keep in touch with. Rather, you may have a contact who knows the 
203
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
type of person you’re looking for and can act as a gateway or 
messenger to them. Your network becomes exponentially more 
powerful and valuable when you realize that you’re connected not 
only to the people who you know directly, but also to all of the people 
who they know, too.
The social networking website LinkedIn is a good way to visualize this 
concept. You may be connected to 50 people on LinkedIn, but each of 
those people will be connected to others who you don’t know. If each 
of your contacts is connected to another 50 people, you’re only one 
person away from some potentially valuable relationships.
Practically speaking, if you’re looking for someone with a particular 
skill or experience, talk to others in your network to see who they 
know who may fit the description. Indirect networking is often more 
effective than direct, because it leverages the networks of others and 
gives you opportunities to get recommendations from people you 
trust.
Don’t Wait Until You Need Something
Networking is more effective when it’s not done under the pressure of 
needing to produce immediate results. Reaching out to your friends 
and contacts when you need something is natural, but having a large 
and established network that stands ready to help when the need 
arises is more effective. Networking only when you need something is 
unlikely to result in mutual benefit and could give others the 
204

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
impression that you’re interested only in helping yourself.
Help Whenever Possible
Helping others and making yourself a valuable contact and friend to 
others is a big part of networking. You will not always be in a position 
to help, but avoid the temptation of helping others only when there’s 
something in it for you. A network of people who are willing and 
eager to help each other will be positive for everyone.
Don’t “Use” People
When looking for the right people to build your network, thinking 
only of what other people can do for you is all too easy. But that’s not 
an effective way to interact, and they will often see through your 
efforts.
The best way to avoid using people is by looking for situations in 
which you can help them. By emphasizing your value to them rather 
than how they can help you, you’ll avoid seeing them only for what 
they have to offer. If you focus on helping others, they will likely want 
to find ways to help you in return.
Don’t Let Networking Hurt Your Productivity
Although professional networking should be an integral part of your 
work, it’s not going to put money in your pocket directly. Freelancers

_____________________________________________________________
in particular need to stay focused on providing services to clients in 
order to generate the income that keeps them going. Networking is 
important, but it should not interfere with your core operations.
Online networks and email especially can be distractions. Develop a 
system that allows you to interact with others in a way that doesn’t 
hinder your work. For example, rather than leaving your email and 
Twitter account open all day, set specific times to check them. Each 
person is different and has a way that works best for them, so find 
one that allows you to network with maximum benefit and with 
minimum disturbance to your productivity.
Don’t Always Evaluate People
When you’re focused on strengthening your network by making 
valuable connections, it’s easy to start measuring people by what they 
can bring to the table. This is a dangerous habit because it will make 
you reluctant to get to know some people because you don’t think 
they have much to offer.
Don’t Try to Be Everywhere Online
Plenty of opportunities are available to network, particularly online. 
But you can be active in only so many places, so don’t spread yourself 
too thin. Instead, choose a few networking websites and groups that 
show promise, and you’ll find that you have more time to be active.

Being active in a few circles yields better results than having limited 
activity in many circles. This goes back to the need for quality over 
quantity in building relationships.
Attend Events
Web designers and other online professionals are fortunate to have a 
number of high-quality conferences and events in their industry that 
provide opportunities to learn and network. If an event is taking place 
in your area, check it out. Of course, if you’re willing to travel, you 
could attend events anywhere.
16. Pay Attention to Local Opportunities
One of the traps of online networking is that it can cause you to miss 
opportunities for face-to-face networking in your local area. Many 
localities have chamber of commerce events, business card 
exchanges, seminars and other events at which to connect with local 
professionals. Pay attention to these activities in your area in case they 
offer something that warrants your involvement.

1. For students who aspire to work in design, what 
would you recommend they study?
David Leggett
Finding a good university-level design program that interests you will 
greatly increase your chance of finding awesome opportunities down 
the road, but it’s very beneficial to get experience before and outside 
of your education. Find projects to help with, start your own, read up 
and apply as much as you can while you’re learning on the side. The 
extra experience never hurts, and at the very least you’ll get to see if 
design is something you really enjoy.
Just to clarify, I have never taken any higher education courses in 
design, but I know that the knowledge you get in that environment is 
valuable, as I’m sure others will suggest.
Wolfgang Bartelme
Well, I guess the most important thing is “practice, practice, practice.” 
To improve the quality of your work, you have to keep pushing 
yourself further and further. By the way, many great artists are self-
taught. But I’m also convinced that a profound education will sharpen 
210

_____________________________________________________________
your skills and help you be able to judge why and how certain designs 
work. Personally, I studied “Information Design” at the University of 
Applied Science in Graz, focusing on all different aspects of design: 
print and advertising, exhibitions, Web design, usability, photography 
and film — which would give students a broad knowledge base and 
make them more generalists than specialists.
2. How does a student determine whether design is 
for them or they should pursue another career?
Jacob Gube
This is a question you have to ask yourself. There aren’t any set rules 
or algorithms to determine whether you should be a designer. The 
important thing is to have passion for the work. Even mediocre 
designers will be able to sustain themselves, but they’ll have to work 
extra hard to compete with more talented and experienced designers. 
So, it all boils down to how much you want to be a designer and how 
much you’re willing to work at it and push forward. I won’t sugar-coat 
the current situation: the truth is that the industry is saturated, and 
there are a lot more designers than jobs, so you have to be sure that 
this is the profession you want to invest your time in.
Henry Jones
I think it’s all about passion. If you find yourself up late at night 
211
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
working on design projects just for the fun of it, then that’s a good 
sign that design is right for you. I think one of the worst situations in 
life is hating what you do. Loving what you do means you’ll probably 
be doing it and thinking about it even outside of class or when you’re 
not being paid to do it. You’ll constantly be honing your skills and 
staying on top of the latest technologies, which is very important for 
designers.
David Leggett
Everyone has a unique situation, and I don’t mean to suggest the 
following is always true: if you’re already a student at a university and 
have no outside experience, it may be difficult to really pursue a 
career in design. I say this only because personal friends of mine have 
struggled to find jobs in this current economic climate. Having 
experience and something to show for your knowledge goes a long 
way.
Otherwise, be sure that you truly enjoy whatever you decide to 
pursue. Many designers and artists I’ve met thoroughly enjoy their 
lifestyles, even when they’re struggling to find work. This is not to say 
that you should undervalue your work, but if you enjoy your career 
when you’re not making money, then it’s probably a good match for 
you.
212

_____________________________________________________________
Wolfgang Bartelme
First and foremost, designing stuff has to be fun: you have to love 
what you do. If that’s not the case, look for something else. Secondly, 
you should, of course, have a decent measure of talent and 
imagination. Even though you will learn many skills in the course of 
your studies, without talent and imagination, your work will be at best 
mediocre.
Chris Spooner
As with any career, if you’re passionate about the subject, you’re set to 
succeed. Careers in the design industry can seem exciting; after all, all 
you do is sit and color things in all day, right? I think this draws in a 
lot of people who maybe haven’t been particularly creative in the past 
and see the career as easy.
This type of person might then find it difficult to be motivated to 
learn the required skills and to continue developing those skills 
throughout their career. That’s not to say that if you weren’t a creative 
child, you can’t pursue a career in design. We all stumble across 
different interests throughout our lives, so as long as you feel you 
have a passion for design, go for it!

3. How do you balance education and work?
Zach Dunn
By my last estimate, I spend about three to four hours on client work 
for every one hour of academic work. I generally learn specialized 
skills more from client work than from academics. It’s easy to get 
caught up in client work and blogging. The hard part is making sure 
you don’t lose touch with the world around you. Interacting with 
clients and blog community members is certainly social, but you need 
to take a break and interact with “regular college students” from time 
to time. I consider it like mental detox.
I’m convinced you must put in extra time on personal projects to truly 
become competent in the Web design industry. Going through the 
motions during class and homework hours only leaves you behind. 
The Internet moves faster than any standard academic schedule. 
Keeping current and practiced is up to you.
Jacob Cass
Finding the right balance between family, friends, work and all of life’s 
other misdemeanors will always be a challenge, no matter what your 
career. You must set priorities and goals relative to what you want to 
achieve and get out of life. Although I have now finished studying 
(formally), I could say that my biggest challenge then was finding 
enough time to give high-quality attention to all projects, whether 
214

_____________________________________________________________
they were educational, personal or for paying customers. At times, I 
found this nearly impossible, and to be honest a lot of my university 
and personal work suffered from my commitments to paying 
customers. In saying this, I guess a lot of it comes down to having 
priorities, goals and good time management.
4. How did work outside of your studies prepare 
you for your career?
Zach Dunn
Almost all of our “career” success so far has been a direct result of 
work done outside of studies. College is a great incubator for a 
number of things other than academics. I value school for reasons 
that are different than those of the average person. College has 
helped me socially. Sam recently wrote an article that does a great job 
of explaining more about our college philosophy in relation to Web 
design, titled The Role of College for Web Designers.
Certain careers cannot start before graduation. Lawyers, for example, 
can’t have hobby clients while putting themselves through school: it’s 
all or nothing. Web design isn’t limited by credentials for entry. Web 
design is largely portfolio-based. When’s the last time a client was 
more interested in your GPA than in your previous client work? In this 
industry, we have the luxury of starting early. I like to take advantage 
of that.
215

_____________________________________________________________
I don’t know what the future holds for Sam and me, but I’m confident 
that at least some of the projects we start today will have some role in 
it.
Jacob Cass
To be honest, I learned more in six months of blogging and following 
other people’s blogs, than studying for three full years at university. 
Doing extra work outside of the education system is vital.
5. What should students and new designers focus 
on outside of their course work to advance in their 
careers?
Brian Hoff
Students should definitely consider taking many business classes, 
especially if they want to go freelance or start their own studio one 
day. I’ve always been passionate enough about design to teach 
myself, but I wish I took more business and marketing classes. Also, I 
would recommend collecting designs. Having resources of inspiration 
and an idea of good design is essential. I take photos of many types, 
colors, designs, etc. as I pass them by, and I use LittleSnapper to 
organize online media. Being a graphic designer is non-stop learning.

_____________________________________________________________
Chris Coyier
No individual program is going to cover every single angle of design, 
especially the most modern technological stuff. Because you are 
already reading Smashing Magazine, you probably already have a 
good grasp of what’s going on in modern design. Reading and 
following tutorials and doing your own experimental projects on the 
side will definitely help you excel. That being said, your whole life 
doesn’t have to revolve around career enhancement. A well-rounded 
life will serve you well. Perhaps some of your other hobbies could 
benefit from your design talent. I have a friend who used to build 
coffee tables and decorate the surfaces with patterns of partially burnt 
matches. If he were looking for a design job, I would absolutely tell 
him to put that stuff onto an online portfolio.
Elliot Jay Stocks
Build your portfolio. Do free websites for your mates’ bands or your 
Mum’s friend’s wool shop. It might not be glamorous work, but doing 
as much as you can builds up your portfolio, and you’ll learn loads on 
every project. When I left university and got my first job, my portfolio 
was made up almost entirely of stuff I’d done on an extracurricular 
basis, not really the course work itself. But also don’t forget that it’s 
about quality, not quantity, and a good portfolio strikes a balance 
between variety (showing that you’re versatile) and continuity 
(showing that you have your own identity as a designer).

Walter Apai
It’s important to expand your knowledge to any areas that are related 
to design. Most design courses concentrate on the basics or on how 
to use the various pieces of software that are available. These are just 
basic tools for new designers, but they won’t make you a great 
designer.
Learn about art, layout and composition, and try to read at least one 
new book on design every month, or even one per week. Subscribe to 
design blogs such as Smashing Magazine and Webdesigner Depot, 
and never stop learning. Keep updating your knowledge whenever 
possible by attending conferences, reading books and magazines and 
becoming involved in the local artistic community. Try to become a 
well-rounded designer, not just an operator of Photoshop or another 
design software tool.
George Lois, the real-life inspiration for Don Draper in Mad Men, said 
it best:
“The computer has played a role in destroying 
creativity with Photoshop. Everybody thinks they’re a 
designer.”
While he may be generalizing a bit, I believe what is meant is that you 
can’t be a proper designer without understanding the fundamentals 
of art and design.

_____________________________________________________________
Jacob Gube
When I was a college student, what truly helped me in my career was 
proactively attempting to get real-world experience by doing 
freelance work, part time. The purpose was two-fold: to see what it 
was like to work with the kind of people who would become your 
employers once you were out of school, and to apply what you 
learned in class, which reinforces your education and helps you 
understand it hands on. You might even end up with a few portfolio 
pieces to show employers once you’re on the job hunt — and some 
money to buy those expensive classroom textbooks.
6. What one thing do you wish you knew before 
starting your career?
Darren Hoyt
Being in touch with my limitations and skills. The first few years of 
designing for the Web (1998 to 2001), I knew that being cross-trained 
was important, so I built my skills in design and front-end code 
(HTML, CSS) equally. But then I made the mistake of thinking that, if I 
was to become a more complete designer and developer, I should 
learn Perl, Flash and Unix commands, too. I sucked at all of those 
things and kept sucking until they asked me to stop.
Deep down, I knew I wasn’t wired for any of that stuff. And more 
importantly, I wasn’t actually interested in it, not compared to design 
219

_____________________________________________________________
anyway. Employers do value someone who is cross-trained, but not if 
the results are mediocre.
David Leggett
Pleasing everyone is nearly impossible. Be friendly to those who enjoy 
your work and friendlier to those who attack it.
Jacob Gube
I wished I had realized that quality is more important than quantity. 
When I started out, I focused on low-cost, high-quantity jobs, which 
resulted in late hours, not enough pay and nothing really that I could 
be proud to put in my portfolio. I wanted to work with as many 
people and on as many projects as I could to jumpstart my experience 
and resume. But the Project Triangle principle applies here: I did it fast 
and cheap, and so the outcomes weren’t good. If I had slowed down 
and focused on getting gigs that were interesting and better quality, I 
would have progressed more fruitfully.
Paul Boag
That constraints are good. As a Web design student, I was given 
endless freedom to design how I wanted and what I wanted. However, 
the real world is not like that. When I joined IBM out of university, my 
first job was to design 8-bit icons. Very restrictive indeed. When I 
started on the Web, it allowed only gray backgrounds and text that 
220

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
was justified left, right or centered. The first time I worked on a 
multimedia CD, it was capable of running video at only 160 x 120 
pixels.
At the time, this frustrated me massively. However, in hindsight it was 
enormously beneficial. It pushed me creatively, and it has also given 
me a lot more patience with the peculiarities of browsers such as IE6.
7. What job search advice do you have for recent 
graduates?
Soh Tanaka
First and foremost, get your portfolio up, and make sure it represents 
your best work. If you lack work samples, start creating projects for 
yourself (websites for your hobbies, your family or for friends). As a 
new grad, you need to prove that you are serious and willing; the best 
way to get that message across is through a robust portfolio.
Secondly, hit the job boards, and send your resumes and cover letters 
to companies you would like to work for. Doing research and tailoring 
each cover letter and resume to the company is important. Stick to 
the job requirements, and follow directions carefully. These employers 
receive many applications daily, and nothing is worse than seeing a 
bland and generic introduction to who you are and what you offer. 
Stand out from the rest.
221
www.ebook777.com

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
Thirdly, keep your networks open, and make yourself known! 
Networking is key.
Darren Hoyt
Obviously, scour the online job boards, but also follow the blogs and 
Twitter feeds of Web designers whom you respect. Studying their 
methods will give you a clearer picture of the sort of designer you 
want to be. If you need advice, trying dropping them an email. But 
remember that not everyone has the time to answer.
Truthfully, most designers I know didn’t get their job by applying cold 
to an agency they knew nothing about. Instead, they slowly made 
relationships with like-minded people until they began to see 
opportunities and get offers.
But I would stress, don’t “network” compulsively. It can look obvious 
and obnoxious and make you look needy. Instead, make connections 
with people you think you actually share interests with, people you 
can picture as colleagues and friends rather than business contacts. 
The rewards are much greater.
Chris Coyier
Nobody will hire you because you say you have skills. You’ll have to 
demonstrate your skills, so either work on your current personal 
website or start building one. Use the website as a portfolio and 
222

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
resume to send to companies. Send it both to companies that say 
they are hiring and to ones that don’t. Just because a Web company 
doesn’t hang a “Now hiring” sign on its door doesn’t mean it couldn’t 
use someone. Pitch them. A little advice for that portfolio: three 
awesome designs are better than three awesome and six mediocre 
designs packed in the same space. Showcase only your finest work, 
what you’re capable of. Quality over quantity.
8. What should new designers consider when 
deciding between working for an agency and 
freelancing?
Elliot Jay Stocks
Jumping straight into freelancing once you’ve completed your 
education is really tempting. I very nearly did that myself. But I’m glad 
I didn’t. You learn valuable lessons working for someone else first, and 
it’s actually much easier because you don’t have to worry about 
getting clients for yourself. So, I would recommend working for 
someone else before going it alone. It’s a great opportunity to build 
your portfolio without dealing with any of the boring stuff that goes 
with freelancing or running your own business. 
Soh Tanaka
As a new designer, being at an agency or on a team is great for 
223

Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
learning and feeling out the industry. Though you may not be able to 
set your own hours or work from home, a steady pay check and 
health insurance are both welcome during a tough economy.
When choosing the freelance route, have some experience under your 
belt, and be ready to be on your own. The key factor is knowing what 
your skills are and having discipline. Freelancing has its ups and 
downs, and you must be self-motivated and determined to overcome 
the challenges. Working from home and setting your own hours is 
ideal for most, but young designers should consider the requirements 
and reality before diving in head first. It may be wise to freelance part 
time until you build enough confidence and experience and know 
enough about your strengths and weaknesses to be able to make the 
right decisions when you strike out on your own.
Chris Spooner
It’s always worth learning the pros and cons of working for an agency 
and freelancing, because each has its perks! Here are a few that spring 
to mind.
Agency pros:
•
Working for an agency after your studies can be great for 
gaining experience in how the industry works and how 
projects are managed from start to finish.
•
At an agency, you work with like-minded colleagues, who you 
224

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
can learn from and develop with.
•
Large agencies often attract big corporations and established 
brands.
•
A full-time job guarantees you a monthly wage and set 
working hours.
Agency cons:
•
You might get stuck working on projects that you don’t find 
interesting or might have to work on something you don’t 
agree with.
•
Agencies sometimes have strict policies, rules and guidelines. 
For instance, browsing the Web, checking Facebook or 
tweeting might get you a slap on the wrist.
•
Agencies work during the usual 9:00 to 5:00 business hours, so 
you will have to as well.
Freelance pros:
•
As a freelancer, you have complete control of the projects you 
take on and the type of work you do.
•
You’re not tied to any particular working hours, so taking a day 
off is no problem.
•
If you can generate a consistent flow of projects, earning a 
225
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
decent wage can be much easier than it would be working at 
an agency.
•
You can work in your pajamas!
Freelance cons:
•
You are personally responsible for your own income, a 
circumstance that can put you at risk.
•
Freelancers need to be able to manage their time in order to 
avoid distractions.
I would recommend that new designers first seek out employment, 
which will give them professional experience with and knowledge of 
design. Then they’ll be able to decide whether they fit better at an 
agency or working for themselves.
One of the main things to consider before starting out as a freelancer 
is whether you’ve generated enough industry experience to be able 
not only to create designs but to source work, manage multiple 
projects and communicate with clients. These other factors definitely 
come into play when freelancing, so having at least some knowledge 
of these processes before diving in is important.
226

_____________________________________________________________
9. How can students and young designers make 
themselves more valuable to potential employers?
Darren Hoyt
Start building a Web presence as early as possible, even before 
seeking a junior position. Buy a personal domain and set up a simple 
portfolio, with an “About” page that gives a snapshot of your 
personality and talents. If you haven’t done client work, do pro bono 
projects for friends until you have work samples to show. Displaying 
them publicly shows that you have pride in your work.
Be concise. Employers and human resource people are like anyone 
else: they are busy and have short attention spans. Don’t make them 
dig to find out who you are. Give your portfolio website just enough 
text, images and examples to paint an accurate picture. If you can’t 
give your own content a crisp and concise design, why should 
employers trust you to do it for clients?
Also, don’t exaggerate the facts when presenting yourself. Our lives 
are way too public these days to bother. More important than 
bragging or dazzling anyone with half-truths is finding a team whose 
needs and interests align with your own. If you get hired under false 
pretenses, you will have wasted everyone’s time. Even experienced 
designers with great portfolios aren’t the right fit, disposition-wise, for 
every agency they apply to.

Wolfgang Bartelme
As I mentioned before, I’m a huge fan of the interdisciplinary 
approach. At most companies, you are unlikely to work exclusively in a 
single field. In fact, when you do Web design, being able to do some 
decent-looking icons or cut a simple screencast or promo video is 
good. This becomes even more important when you are self-
employed. Moreover, this variety makes and keeps work interesting… 
at least that’s the case for me.
Chris Coyier
Just being a nice person and easy to work with is pretty huge. I think 
employers look for that during the interview process, at least as best 
they can in that short time. Someone incredibly stiff or stand-offish is 
unlikely to win the job over someone who is happy and casual. Design 
studios, in my experience, are pretty friendly and casual. Other 
random advice: become really good at one thing. You’ll be a lot more 
valuable as the guy or girl who knows that one thing really well than 
as a jack of all trades. Being well-rounded is awesome, but having a 
spike of talent in one particular area will serve you well.
Walter Apai
Social skills are necessary when dealing with potential clients. 
Designers should know what their clients do and provide them with 
the best possible service.
228

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Smashing eBook Series: #1 Professional Web Design
_____________________________________________________________
I’d encourage all designers to make themselves a one-stop shop for 
all of their clients’ design needs. That would include Web design, 
copywriting, printing, etc. If you’re not an expert in these fields, team 
up with a few peers so that you can help each other as needed.
Designers should focus on making the entire process easy for clients, 
but involve clients in some design decisions as well, so that they feel 
that they are part of the project.
I suggest asking clients a lot of questions and aiming to truly get to 
the core of their business and what would work for them. The more 
we understand our clients and their projects, the more successful the 
projects will be and the better our chances of getting them as repeat 
clients.
A designer is a human being, too. Become a well-versed designer, 
understand your medium, get educated and become a well-rounded 
person who always aims high.
Set high standards for yourself and your work. The right clients will 
gravitate to someone who holds themselves to high standards.

10. What should new freelancers do during the first 
few months of their business to succeed?
Paul Andrew
You have to have a personal business plan. I really wish I had a plan 
when I started out; I really do. I jumped right in feet first and landed 
on my head! And it hurt. Partly, I think it was those first few months of 
hardship that even now propel me forward. That period not only 
affected my finances and confidence, it damaged my reputation. That 
is very hard to regain. I think over the years I have regained it, but it 
was hard work, and it all could have been avoided with a bit more 
planning and simply by writing a personal business strategy.
It’s not enough to have a strategy planned out in your head; it has to 
be on paper. You need to be able to read it and see it to live by it. 
Every so often you should read it again, just to realign yourself. And 
then read it again, and only tweak it if you really have to.
Your personal business plan could do the following:
•
Describe your business objectives, business direction and 
where you hope to be in x number of months.
•
List all potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.
•
Set honest and realistic targets, and allow for a little flexibility.

•
As your business grows, track its achievements and compare 
them to your business objectives.
•
Set up a financial framework to measure how much your 
business is making (or not making).
•
Describe how you will attract new business to meet your 
financial targets.
Everyone and every business is different. Write down what is correct 
and achievable for you, and be very honest: it is your business after 
all. Stick to the plan!

Personally, I worked for nearly three years while preparing to go 
freelance. I would work my 9:00 to 5:00 job, come home, eat dinner 
and then market myself (blog), search for new business, advertise and 
work from around 7:00 pm until 12:00 am. Having a good feel for 
running your own business is important before you go in head first.
Saving money is also important. Every business, no matter what it is, 
goes through periods of drought. Having money to back you up for a 
little while is a must. Freelancing is not for everyone. Part-time 
freelancing while maintaining a steady-paying job will help you get a 
feel for things.

I think the most important time in freelancing isn’t particularly the 
first few months, but more so the time leading up to going freelance. 
As a freelancer, you’ll need a good flow of clients to generate income; 
you’ll have to get busy promoting and building a name for yourself, 
so that when you’re ready to leave your job, you’ll be all set to simply 
flick the switch from employment to self-employment.
During this build-up time, you’ll want to design all of your personal 
branding, especially your website, to showcase what you can do. 
Become an active member of the design community by blogging, 
guest writing and networking via Twitter (or you might want to 
network offline or locally); and begin taking on projects that you can 
work on during the nights. It can be hard work managing both your 
full-time job and one or two freelance projects simultaneously, but 
when the number of inquiries reaches an optimal level, you can 
quickly switch from your job to taking on more freelance work — 
rather than making the decision one day, falling flat on your face and 
then having to eat beans on toast until you’ve built a profile.
Jon Phillips
I believe the first few months are crucial, especially because it usually 
means quitting the day job and taking the plunge into the freelancing 
world. It can be scary at first. Many things need to be done in the first 
few months, but of course nothing is irreparable. Should you make a 
bad decision, you can always fix things as you go along. I highly

recommend getting a portfolio website up; even if you don’t have a 
lot to show, you need a place to showcase what you have. Then get a 
good invoicing system such as Freshbooks or Billings, network with 
other freelancers as much as possible via Twitter, Facebook, design 
forums and blogs, and maybe start a blog of your own.
Elliot Jay Stocks
Work for someone else! For the first few months to be a success, you 
need to have work lined up, so having that in place before you make 
the jump is important. I’d also recommend getting a good accountant 
as soon as you can and some sort of system for keeping track of your 
money, such as Xero. Also, make sure you have a website set up long 
before you decide to go solo.
11. Aside from design and technical skills, what 
aspects of running a business should new 
freelancers focus on?
Paul Andrew
The advice I have been given over the years about freelancing as a 
business has varied. Some have told me that putting business ahead 
of design guarantees profit and keeps your head above water. On the 
other hand, I have also been told not to treat design as a business, to 
work on what your passion is, the business side will take care of itself.

These are both great philosophies, but they don’t really work in the 
real world. The answer is to have a healthy balance between the two. 
Both need to be kept separate while at the same time working off 
each other. Think of it as the positive and negative charge of a battery. 
The battery only works when both charges are connected. (You can 
decide which is the positive and negative side in relation to business 
and design).
When meeting potential clients, first impressions really do count, and 
you really need to present yourself with professionalism. It does not 
matter how strong your portfolio is or who you are — it is about how 
professional and business-like you appear to them. You are 
negotiating a business transaction after all.
Yes, this means breaking away from the designer stereotype of 
wearing t-shirts and jeans and instead being clean-shaven, putting on 
a business suit and remembering the manners your mother taught 
you. Carry business cards with you, maybe even a briefcase; do what 
you have to do to convince the client you mean business.
Some monkeys you should not carry on your back by yourself, and 
they are the finance side of your business. Let’s be honest: who 
understands tax and monetary law. I certainly don’t and don’t care to 
either. Find yourself an accountant. They don’t cost that much — 
maybe a week’s wage out of the year, and when you weigh the cost of 
doing your taxes incorrectly and the penalties that might follow, an 
accountant is a worthwhile investment.

It would be nice if everyone you worked with was honest. Protecting 
the integrity of your work, yourself and your business should be next 
on your to-do list. The reality is that at some point, someone will try 
to shortchange you or, worse, wiggle out of a payment. That is why 
you need a watertight contract. Every country has its own laws 
regarding design; make sure you know and understand yours.
Hiring a lawyer to write a standard contract for your small business 
would be expensive. A way around this would be to write your own, as 
I did. I asked a few designers for advice and researched the law online 
and came up with an outline for my own. I then took it to a lawyer 
and asked them to sanity-check it. Not as expensive as asking them to 
write it — still, it wasn’t cheap, but it was worth it.
So, to sum up, if you’re dressed smart, your business finances are in 
safe hands and you are legally protected, then you are free to do what 
you were trained to do and give your creativity free reign, letting your 
passion fuel your design. It is a long road to take, but it is necessary.
Brian Hoff
Marketing without a doubt. I receive many emails asking how I get so 
much freelance business or how I find clients. My response: you have 
to work hard for it. Clients won’t come to you. Tell everyone what you 
do, start a blog, attend networking events and conferences, contact 
clients directly. Running your own business is hard work. There is no 
such thing as a 40-hour work week when you run your own business. I

work seven days a week. I’ve even gone so far as to strike up new 
work by chatting with someone at the bar (not recommended). You 
have to have personality and drive to freelance successfully.
Jon Phillips
Being a freelancer means having to wear many different hats (a ton of 
different hats!). Spending some time on government websites and 
meeting with an accountant to learn more about tax laws goes a very 
long way. Of course, many designers, being creative types, tend to 
forget that it’s a business (I often forget). You need to spend time on 
accounting but also on networking and marketing your business. In 
the first few months results will be small, but your efforts will pay off 
in the long run. You need to be as good with numbers as you are with 
Photoshop.
12. What are some of the best ways for new 
designers to find clients?
Henry Jones
I can only speak from experience here. Shortly before I went full-time 
freelancing, my portfolio was listed on several popular CSS galleries. 
From that point on, clients found me. I was very surprised to see how 
many people used the galleries to find designers. Once I had a few 
clients and projects under my belt, I started to get a lot of referrals.

_____________________________________________________________
So, work hard on creating a great portfolio, and use the design 
galleries. This is probably the best and easiest way to get the most 
exposure. Plenty of design-specific job boards are available where you 
can search for projects that are a good fit for you.
Jon Phillips
I think websites such as Twitter are a great place to get started! In fact, 
I found a lot of my own clients via Twitter. Design forums are also a 
great place to network, make friends and find work. New freelancers 
may also be tempted to try design contests and crowd-sourcing, but I 
personally think they devalue the industry, so I wouldn’t advise doing 
that. Even if you don’t have much to show in your portfolio, there are 
others ways to get gigs. There are always job boards, such as the one 
on Smashing Magazine and the one on FreelanceSwitch, which are 
great for finding clients. You might even consider buying banner ads 
on design-related websites. But your marketing budget may not allow 
this at first, so networking websites, job boards and forums would be 
the places to hang out.
Jacob Cass
Get your name out there. Start blogging. Showcase your work. Look 
on job boards. Ask friends, family, local charities. Read books and blog 
posts. The information is out there. Your job is to find it!

Networking is one of the best ways but often one of the most 
overlooked. I suggest that new designers speak to everyone they 
know and use every chance they have to talk about their work and 
what they do for a living.
I found myself just mentioning Web design to someone the other day 
(not even looking for more work), and immediately they thought of 
someone they knew who was looking for a website redesign. 
Opportunities are everywhere; just seize them.
I should also mention that one should not rely on networking alone 
or any other single “system.” I’d encourage new designers to take a 
multi-faceted approach to their new career.
There are unlimited ways to get new clients. Posting on bulletin 
boards, both online and offline, and placing small ads in the 
newspaper or local magazines are just a few of the media you can 
use. I also think that starting local is best, and getting experience 
working on projects with people who you can meet in person in your 
own city. This is a good starting point to gain more “field” experience.
Paul Boag
It has to start with friends and family. This will help build your initial 
portfolio. From there, consider doing some discounted work for a 
local charity to gain experience in working for real clients. After that, 
238

the contacts you have made through networking will start to pay off, 
and hopefully you will get some work through them. Finally and most 
importantly, make it known that you want work. It is surprising how 
many freelance websites I visit that don’t state whether they currently 
accept work or not.
That said, I would suggest that if you are straight out of university, 
you should probably work for a small agency before jumping into the 
freelance world. Being a freelancer requires a lot of business skills that 
they don’t teach you in university.
13. What networking tips do you have for young 
designers?
Henry Jones
One option is to attend design conferences, but for young designers 
this can be expensive. So, I would recommend getting involved in the 
design community. Start reading and leaving comments on popular 
design blogs. Create a Twitter account, and post useful stuff. 
Depending on how much time you have, you could even start your 
own design-related blog. Blogging has been huge for me, and I 
believe it’s the best way to get your name out there and meet other 
designers. No matter what route you take, just remember to be 
helpful and genuine, and you will build lasting relationships.

You are young — you cannot change that fact — and you want to be 
successful. In any business, especially ours, you need friends, you 
need contacts and most importantly you need to build professional 
relationships. Bear in mind, though, that networking is not something 
you can rush; it takes time and patience.
The best time to start networking is right now. Even if you are still in 
high school or haven’t yet graduated college, reach out now. It is 
never too early to get your name out there. Your name is your most 
powerful and memorable asset. Work will follow, I promise.
The most important relationships for any designer are the ones they 
have built with fellow students. No matter what happens, they are 
your primary network. You can help each other by sharing knowledge 
and design contacts and by learning from each other.
The best way to network beyond your inner circle is to get in touch 
with seasoned designers. For the most part, designers are pretty 
selfless and love to share and help when they can. With that in mind, 
put together a list of designers on whom you want to model yourself 
and someone with a strong body of work. Send them emails, 
accompanied by your portfolio, stating that you are a young designer 
starting out and seeking a little advice. Ask them how they got 
started, and ask for any tips they might be willing to share? Seasoned 
designers need to build their networks, too, and will welcome your 
introduction and questions.

_____________________________________________________________
When I started out as a designer, I sent a letter (with my portfolio and 
business card) to a local design agency — certainly not the biggest 
one or the most prestigious — and introduced myself as a young 
designer who was eager to learn. I asked if I could come in for a day 
or two to learn a bit about the design business and gain some work 
experience. Thankfully, they consented, and I spent three days asking 
questions, picking up business cards and meeting clients. That was 
over ten years ago, and I still rely on those contacts now. And to this 
day, that has been my most productive and successful period of 
networking.
Not every design agency will be as open as that one was, but I would 
try. There is no harm in asking.
One thing to remember about networking is that success is 
determined not by your number of contacts but by the quality of 
those contacts. Even if the best designer in the world sent you a 
courtesy email reply, it does not mean that you are in their network or 
that they are in yours. A quality network contact is someone who 
gives you a personal reply and genuinely tries to help you. These are 
the contacts you must maintain. This is your network.
Finally, please don’t think of youth as an impediment. Think of it as a 
license to ask questions, to learn and expand your personal network.

Step away from the computer. Meeting people online is great, but 
nothing beats meeting them face to face. Attend conferences and 
meet-ups and get to know people. Then follow up on those 
relationships via Twitter and Facebook.
Also, don’t have an agenda. Or, if you have one, be honest and open 
about it. Too many people network solely to win work or become a 
“Web celebrity.” Instead, network because you want to meet like-
minded people who will inspire and excite you about your work.
Soh Tanaka
Attend industry events, seminars and any kind of social gatherings. 
Don’t be shy; get to know the people around you. Be interested and 
willing to learn from them, and at the right time let them know who 
you are and what you do. Carry business cards with you at all times, 
and have your elevator speech ready. You never know when you will 
run into a potential client or employer. Networking is all about 
expanding your opportunities, and as a designer this skill is critical.
