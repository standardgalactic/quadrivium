Foreword
by Margot Heiligman
Principal, StrukturTeam
This book enters the realm of Internet Protocol-based (IP) services with
knowledge and decisiveness. Lao Tzu has been attributed with the quote
“The good traveler has no set plans, and is not intent on arriving.” While
this may certainly explain the adventure of traveling to new lands, the
discovery of the unknown, and the mystique of uncertainty, it cannot ap-
ply to the bits and bytes traversing an IP highway. Here, an IP packet’s
journey is mired with determinates from the start: its origins must be es-
tablished, its path discernable, its objective and outcome predictable.
As every player in the IP community—from service provider to network
manager—would agree, the packets we are optimizing, switching, routing,
managing, handling, guiding, snifﬁng, trading, billing, monitoring, and
ensuring today would do no worse than to follow the sage’s advice. In
fact, if we extend the continuum with IP-based services as a journey and
relate IP packets to the voyager, it would support our authors’ goals to de-
sign a concept for IP-based services that depicts calculated reference mod-
els to illustrate speciﬁcs in determining where those packets will end up.
Examples of such models are laid out through the book, from guaranteed-
bandwidth design to voice-over-IP services, with many IP-VPN service ar-
chitecture examples in between. The authors’ objective in producing a
guide so comprehensive and organized in its coverage of IP-based services
is to create value for service providers whose innovation objectives and
the means for achieving them are tantamount. In order to soak up all the
vii

material required of the IP business unit, one would be hard-pressed to
ﬁnd a more content-rich source addressing business, technical, and ser-
vice questions.
The authors go so far as to deﬁne provisioning, and cover concrete issues
facing the service provider, such as adequate IP devices for customers,
connections to the various customer networks, conﬁguration of those IP
devices in the customer environment, and activation and monitoring of
services for the purposes of differentiating the service provider and miti-
gating risk. Ms. Morrow, with a rich background in International Telecom
planning and strategy, has our full attention in drawing from real service
provider cases in Chapter 8’s case studies.
To extrapolate our metaphor one level further, the traveler’s donkey or
chariot would be these IP-based services’ technological underpinnings, its
routers and architecture, a means to an end that is staid and uncompro-
mising. The consciousness or human choices voyaging on Lao Tzu’s ad-
vice correlate to the IP service provider’s business rules to ascertain how
priorities are set, plus the service provider’s business model and strategy
for development.
All of which are dealt with elegantly in this book. This volume ex-
pounds the quest of two discoverers, Ms. Morrow and Mr. Vijayananda,
whose route has taken them beyond their native countries and their aca-
demic roots to approach the practical application of their experience in
myriad well-researched examples and to bring to light ﬁndings that are ar-
ticulated in a lively and unequivocal way. The material conveyed about
MPLS, for example, is some of the most pioneering in print today. The ma-
terial covered in Chapter 5 includes the role of MPLS and its advantages in
trafﬁc engineering and security for IP-based services, and the role of new-
comers such as DSL in the creation of IP-based services built on new busi-
ness fundamentals due to factors such as local loop data and voice trans-
port. Mr. Vijayananda, with a Ph.D. in computer science and experience
in cutting-edge research, offers his deep knowledge in building innovative
IP-based service solutions, such as migrating services from IPv4 to IPv6 for
customers who require it (through tunneling to take advantage of the
address-space shortcomings of IPv4). All of the material here advances the
ability of service providers and business managers to offer more choices to
customers and serve those customers who are “on the technology cusp,”
such as those implementing optical networking for merging transport and
IP networks for better resiliency.
Most of all, if you are looking to navigate the often-misunderstood
realm of “practical” IP-based service development, or simply looking to fa-
miliarize yourself with the process for solving customer issues in today’s
competitive and quickly evolving telecommunications environment, this
book provides answers. The product of the authors’ professional pursuits,
the knowledge contained within this volume does justice to where we are
headed, in pushing technology to represent market needs.

Foreword

Let’s fast-forward now, to the moment you’ve been waiting for—your
planned embarkation on a fascinating IP exploit, whether developing a
new IP-based service, translating a market need into a set of rules and busi-
ness cases, building the perfect IP solution, or ﬁnding determinants to

Preface
Looking back at the tremendous growth experienced in the telecommuni-
cations and technology sectors followed by the sudden downturn in those
industries, analysts are now speculating as to when a resurgence will oc-
cur. What may be of more immediate importance to those involved is how
a resurgence will occur.
Telecommunication carriers began overbuying new infrastructure in
the late 1990s, resulting in a high network capacity-to-customer trafﬁc ra-
tio, resulting in a decrease of equipment purchases from suppliers. These
large up-front costs and the unexpected shifting of the business envi-
ronment have forced both enterprise customers and telecommunication
companies to look closely at reducing costs, generating revenues, and sus-
taining overall proﬁtability. One very important way to draw more cus-
tomer trafﬁc and thus increase proﬁtability and revenue is the creation of
new services. It is with this in mind that we have chosen to write a book
on Internet Protocol-based service development and deployment, a topic
that will be of increasing importance to the survivability of carriers and
service providers.
Service providers struggle to create new services for business and resi-
dential customers in order to ameliorate ﬂat (if not declining) voice reve-
nue and a reduction in long-term detrimental operating expenses due
to multiple networks and operation organizations. Meanwhile, the cus-
tomer, speciﬁcally the business customer, is becoming more and more
xvii

demanding in terms of service requirements and expectations. The sup-
plier then needs to provide the infrastructure and features needed to meet
these demands. One other important factor for this symbiotic relation-
ship is the utilization of technology by each group to meet the combined
goals and requirements.
The Internet Protocol (IP) satisﬁes many of these important require-
ments. As end-user applications become more and more aligned with
the Internet Protocol, it can be the foundation for service development
and deployment for achieving service provider goals, customer require-
ments, and supplier product and technology development. Why IP? For
one thing, IP is widely deployed throughout the world. The Internet con-
nects over a million hosts and is based on IP. IP provides common inter-
faces that are used to deliver services such as Web hosting, Internet access,
and the connection of corporate sites to private virtual networks. As a
nonproprietary and open protocol, IP can be used to converge voice, data,
and videoconferencing onto a single platform.
This book is the result of our own experiences in service development,
both as service providers and vendors of service products. We present
business and technical views on the subject of creating and implementing
IP-based services because we see both aspects as equally important. The
challenge of balancing a business view with technical feasibility is not just
inclusive to IP, however, but to service development overall.
Audience
The participants in the service development process are key beneﬁciaries
of this information: product managers, business development strategists,
network engineering architects, operational support and network man-
agement architects, and suppliers’ product development managers. We
also include customer information technology (IT) architects and their
management as sources of these services. Graduate students with a fo-
cus on service development in telecommunications and IT management
courses may also ﬁnd this book useful.
Approach
While there are substantial books on the IP, voice services, frame relay and
other technologies, we have found none that address the service develop-
ment process and that speciﬁcally bind IP with service development. Fur-
thermore, it is our experience that project managers need to know both
the business-engineering aspects associated with service development and
deployment and the practical examples found in technological imple-
mentations. We have included both aspects of service creation in this
xviii
Preface

book, drawing from our combined perspectives and experiences in this
area. It is not necessary to read the book sequentially. In general, the busi-
ness chapters (Chapters 2, 3, and 4) may be most appropriate for product
managers or business analysts. Technical engineers and implementers are
the main target readership for Chapters 5, 6, and 7, and a working knowl-
edge of IP is required to understand the technical portion of the book.
Both types of readers will beneﬁt from Chapter 8 and the Closing Re-
marks. Our goal is to present you with a balanced view of service develop-
ment and deployment based on IP.
We have made a distinction between new competitors and incum-
bents, because the issues facing these service providers are different. In-
cumbents are confronted with the problem of deploying new services on
legacy or existing infrastructure. They may have multiple networks, such
as a public-switched telephone network (PSTN), asynchronous transfer
mode (ATM), and digital subscriber line (DSL), and multiple services, such
as voice and data services that have been developed over years. Con-
verging these services to a single network is complicated by the existence
of different operating support systems to manage these existing networks.
New competitors, on the other hand, do not experience this problem.
They are trying to compete with incumbents and are confronted with
such challenges as name recognition and proving to customers that an al-
ternative service provider can bring value to a customer business.
Book Organization
The book is divided into ﬁve parts:
●
The Introduction sets the stage for the principles espoused throughout
the book. We review some historical trends in telecommunications
that have attempted to discourage monopolistic practices and en-
courage competition. We also present common problems and issues
associated with service development and upgrades.
●
Chapters 2, 3, and 4 comprise the business section and detail business
elements in service development and deployment. Topics such as
shortening the service development cycle and models of develop-
ment for new competitors as well as incumbents are discussed in
these chapters. The focus is on service creation.
●
Chapters 5, 6, and 7 comprise the technical section and expand on these
business models from actual technology examples. Technology dis-
cussions related to IP-based provisioning, network management,
and advanced technology themes are treated in these chapters. An
example of using the technology for service deployment follows
each section. The focus is on service implementation.
Preface
xix

●
Chapter 8 is the case study section. This chapter is further divided into
conceptual case studies and then includes an actual example from a
European incumbent. The case studies demonstrate practical exam-
ples of IP-based service development and service upgrades for in-
cumbents as well as new competitors. We take the principles, prob-
lems, and issues identiﬁed earlier in the book and run through end-
to-end examples to tie these themes together. Due to nondisclosure
agreements, we are restrained from offering details in the actual case
study example, hence the summary format. However, the theoretical
conceptual case studies together with the real case should serve to
provide a comprehensive overview of the IP-based service develop-
ment process. Further, there is not that much of a deviation in ser-
vice development experiences among actual service providers. The
European example reﬂects the approach used by quite a few service
providers internationally.
●
In Closing Remarks, we conﬁrm that IP-based technology is a service
enabler by offering our conclusions and citing new technological
trends.

Introduction
The Internet Protocol (IP) is widely used to route packets over the Internet
and other TCP/IP-based networks. As the unifying protocol between com-
puting and communications, IP provides solutions for merging new tech-
nology with legacy platforms or existing infrastructure. This capability is
due to the nonproprietary character of IP. IP is open and permits the cre-
ation of new services for customers. Services are solutions that add value to
a customer business; they are developed by providers called service provid-
ers. Examples of IP-based services are an IP-VPN (virtual private network)
offering to an enterprise customer for site-to-site communications, Web
hosting, Internet access, and so on. Customer applications are being re-
leased or have migrated to IP, such as email, ﬁle transfer, Web browsing,
and IP telephony. Electronic commerce (e-commerce) companies are us-
ing IP for such applications as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply
chain management (SCM), which integrate business facets such as manu-
facturing, sales and marketing, and product and information ﬂow in order
to automate daily operations.
The history of IP extends back to the development of the transmission
control protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) by the U.S. Department of De-
fense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1974. This protocol
was to permit diverse computer networks to interconnect and communi-
cate with one another. The motivation for the protocol was a problem
that the U.S. Air Force had commissioned the RAND Corporation (an
American nonproﬁt research organization) in 1962 to resolve: how the Air
Force could still maintain command and control over its infrastructure
1

after a nuclear attack. The new network was to survive a nuclear attack.
The proposal from the RAND Corporation was a packet-switched network.
Paul Baran of RAND wrote:
Packet switching is the breaking down of data into datagrams or packets that
are labeled to indicate the origin and the destination of the information and the
forwarding of these packets from one computer to another computer until the
information arrives at its ﬁnal destination computer. This was crucial to the re-
alization of a computer network. If packets are lost at any given point, the mes-
sage can be resent by the originator.
In 1983, the TCP/IP protocol was deployed on the Advanced Research
Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) that later became the basis for what
is now the Internet. Today, the Internet connects over 100,000,000 host
devices or computers throughout the world.
1.1 Why IP?
Why IP? Service providers also use IP to collapse multiple service such as
voice, data, and videoconferencing into a single converged transport en-
vironment, thereby reducing recurring operational expenses associated
with these separate services. Further, the service provider can use IP-based
tools to automate service development and service provisioning. An ex-
ample is to use the operations support system (OSS), which is the nerve cen-
ter for network management, ordering, billing, and reporting used by a
service provider to automate service development and provisioning. Via a
Web interface, a customer requests a service, the request is ﬂagged as a
new service by the service creation database that is part of the OSS archi-
tecture, and the process for developing services commences. This automa-
tion of service creation and provisioning is further discussed in Chapter 2.
The combination of automation and service development cycle reduc-
tion can decrease time to market of new service introductions. The presi-
dent of AT&T Labs has asserted that his goal is to reduce the time it takes
to deploy new services to 6 months from 12 to 18 months, thereby po-
tentially increasing revenue dramatically.1 Automating service delivery
would also decrease costs by eliminating unnecessary manual processes.
There is indeed an opportunity to use IP as a service and business enabler.
When is IP not a solution for service providers? Examples are services
that offer dedicated Layer 2 connections only, like leased lines, synchro-
nous optical network/synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH), integrated
services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber line (DSL), asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM), or frame relay. Layer 2 connections are used to

Fusion (August 27, 2001).

provide only bandwidth to customers. These customers have the resources
to manage their information technology (IT) infrastructure and only require
bandwidth from service providers. These technologies are not competing
with IP, as IP operates at Layer 3. In fact, these technologies complement
IP-based services and are often used in the access to provision IP-based ser-
vices to customers.
1.2 History—Setting the Stage for Service Providers
Prior to the Modiﬁed Final Judgment (MFJ) on January 1, 1984, that re-
sulted in the separation of AT&T from its seven original regional Bell oper-
ating companies (RBOCs) in the United States, no telecom competitors
outside these companies existed. This separation is commonly referred to
as AT&T’s divestiture of the Bell operating companies. In fact, the MFJ was
decreed in order to break up a monopoly. Internationally, post, telephone,
and telegraph (PTTs) are still largely subsidized by national governments.
A trend toward privatization of these government entities is currently
under way. A common thread, however, is that these incumbents have
had years, if not centuries, of existence, which has resulted in a virtual
lock on the market in terms of telecommunications services. With such
longevity in the market, to transform from a slow-moving bureaucracy to
a dynamic business requires time and patience. The universal telephone
service with its 99.999% availability has been a phenomenal achievement
of these incumbent operators, and they have long depended on the sure
revenue from this voice service.
The reason to open the telecommunications sector up to competition is
to offer customers a choice in service providers. But the choice is null if
one cannot have the expected services for a good price. The true bene-
ﬁciary of competition should be the customer.
1.3 Regulatory Events That Opened Competition
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 in the United States was to imple-
ment a pro-competitive national policy. The goals of this communica-
tions policy were to foster competition by opening local service to addi-
tional players, permitting the RBOCs to provide long-distance voice and
video services, deregulating cable fees, revising broadcast ownership regu-
lations, and protecting the universal voice service. By passing this act,
Congress had also acknowledged the possibility of developing innovative
services in the data area, namely, the Internet.
At the heart of the act was freeing up the “last mile” of copper or ﬁber
connecting a customer to an operator (also called the local loop). In addi-
tion to the MFJ of 1984, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to
1.3 Regulatory Events That Opened Competition
3

induce competition in order to offer value-added services to the customer.
Section 271 of the act consists of a 14-point checklist that serves as a
guideline for competition with both local and long-distance services. De-
spite this checklist, the reality today is that the impact of the Telecom-
munications Act of 1996 has been minimal. Due to mergers and acquisi-
tions, four of the seven original Bell operating companies no longer exist.
Many incumbents have attempted to prove full compliance to the check-
list, however, their applications only described a plan toward compliance
rather than an actual demonstration of fact.
Competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), formed as a result of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996, are battling to survive. These are
alternative service providers to the incumbents. Being new entrants,
CLECs and other alternative service providers are referred to in this book
as Greenﬁeld service providers. Examples of these providers are AOL Time
Warner, IP Communications, and x service providers (xSPs).
On the international scene, the situation is not that much different
than in the United States. In countries where PTTs have embarked on the
road to privatization and competition is welcome, unbundling the local
loop is still a challenge. In some cases, incumbents have obtained a defer-
ral from governmental regulatory agencies. Incumbents in these countries
have argued that the playing ﬁeld for competition is not fair to their own
business proﬁtability, and therefore gives an unfair advantage to the com-
petitor. (This subject is further discussed in Chapter 4.)
This history helps us to understand the dynamics behind the ser-
vice provider environment. Understanding the backgrounds of the in-
cumbents as well as the challenges confronting both incumbents and new
competitors in this industry is critical to comprehending the current busi-
ness situation. Regulation with a goal to introduce more competition is
one aspect of the current situation, however, the focus of this book is not
on regulation but rather on service development and deployment for all
players in the market.
1.4 Potential Service Providers—Categories
Identifying service providers and their individual focus helps to clarify the
challenges that they face in developing and deploying new services. The
service providers may be classiﬁed as follows:
●
Incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) and incumbent PTTs who
dominate Layer 2 transport domains and access such as leased lines,
ISDN, DSL, frame relay, SONET/SDH, and ATM. Services from these
providers tend to be homogeneous, with focus on voice as a com-
modity. ILECs control about 90% of the access lines in the United
States. Examples are the former RBOCs and their derivatives, such as
4
Chapter 1: Introduction

SBC Paciﬁc Bell, SBC Southwestern Bell, SBC Ameritech, BellSouth,
and Verizon.
●
Competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) are similar to ILECs and in-
cumbent PTTs in that the service approach is a commodity—for ex-
ample, voice service to residential and business customers. Some
CLECS do have their own backbone and manage access to the cus-
tomer. Unlike ILECs, CLECs do not dominate Layer 2 transport and
access domains. x service providers (xSPs) offer speciﬁc services such
as host service providing, applications service providing, and so
on. (CLECs and xSPs are discussed further in Chapter 3.) Applica-
tions service provider examples include Digital Island (part of Ca-
ble&Wireless) and digex.
●
Interexchange carriers (IXCs) offer long-distance access. Legacy players
have included AT&T and Sprint. Qwest and Level 3 Communica-
tions pose competitive threats to these incumbents.
●
Cable companies offer commodity services over cable. Examples are
AOL Time Warner in the United States and UPC in Europe.
●
Bandwidth brokers have a focus on offering massive and cheap band-
width to everyone, reﬂecting a “carrier’s carrier” model. Some exam-
ples are Qwest and Level 3 Communications.
In examining the challenges and motivations of these providers to de-
velop new services based on IP, we have divided them into two major cat-
egories: Greenﬁeld service providers, representing new-entry providers,
and incumbents. Greenﬁeld is a term used in telecommunications to de-
scribe something new, such as a new backbone. Greenﬁeld service provid-
ers and incumbents are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively.
1.5 Services
Services are solutions for customers with an agreed level of support, such
as availability, performance, and reliability. IP-based service examples are
Internet access, e-commerce portal management, Web hosting, a corpo-
rate virtual private network (IP-VPN), voice-over-IP (VoIP), videoconferenc-
ing, and so on. Developing services depends on the requirements of cus-
tomers, service providers, and vendors. An example of the interaction of
the three is discussed in the next section.
Services can be bundled or unbundled. Bundles are a type of service
packaging often used in a managed service. An example of a bundle would
be offering a combination of managed service offerings such as IP-VPN,
Internet access, and Web hosting. However, bundles are not a requirement
for a managed service offering. A Greenﬁeld service provider may use bun-
dle packaging to secure the customer relationship. For example, it be-
comes more difﬁcult for a customer to user multiple service providers with
1.5 Services
5

bundles as the Greenﬁeld service provider becomes the key source of most
of these services. Service and service packaging are themes found in Chap-
ters 2, 3, and 4.
1.6 Customer Requirements and Service Provider
and Vendor Goals
In setting the stage for using IP to develop and deploy services, we need
to understand the requirements of the three main participants: the cus-
tomer, the service provider, and the vendor. These requirements form the
foundation of the case studies in Chapter 8, and we refer to them through-
out the book to show their relationships to the service development and
technology deployment examples using IP.
1.6.1
Customer Requirements
The requirements of the customer vary, depending on the needs of their
applications and the services that they buy from the service provider.
Some of the common requirements are
Connectivity
Throughput
Quality of service: guaranteed bandwidth, minimal delay, and minimal
delay variation (jitter)
Security
High availability (99.999%) of the service
Service-level agreement reports
Multiservices using a single connection
Connectivity
Connectivity refers to IP connectivity between two sites that are separate. It
is a basic requirement. Typically, customers have several geographically
scattered sites and need connectivity between them to exchange informa-
tion. Depending on the needs of the customer, the connectivity can be
either a full mesh between all the sites or a star topology with the main
site (typically the head ofﬁce) having connectivity to all other sites.
Throughput
Once connectivity is available, the link capacity (throughput) between sites
is the next requirement. The link capacity required for a site depends on
the volume of trafﬁc from and to the site. Small sites (regional ofﬁces)
6
Chapter 1: Introduction

require less throughput than the head ofﬁce. As the volume of trafﬁc in-
creases over a period of time, customers upgrade the link capacity of the
connection to a site or between two sites. Monitoring the link utilization
is necessary to make the decision to upgrade the link capacity. The ability
to dynamically order bandwidth and have it provisioned within 15 min-
utes is also a requirement of the customer.
Quality of Service: Guaranteed Bandwidth, Minimal Delay, and
Minimal Delay Variation (Jitter)
By default, IP is best-effort and makes no guarantees of the throughput
on a physical connection when it is shared by several IP connections.
Today, IP-based applications have more requirements compared to basic
connectivity provided by best-effort IP. Some of these applications require
a guaranteed minimum throughput. It is not enough that information
can be transferred between sites, it must also be exchanged within a cer-
tain period of time. Since the physical connection between sites can be
shared by multiple IP connections, it is necessary to guarantee the band-
width to connections (or a class of connections) that have minimum
bandwidth requirements.
Today, there are several real-time IP-based applications that are time-
sensitive. Voice and video applications like videoconferencing not only
have bandwidth requirements but are also sensitive to delay and variation
in delay. It can be very annoying to hear somebody speak very slowly, to
hear the voice drag, or to see a fuzzy video picture because of the delay.
Hence, it is not enough if the data packets from these applications are ulti-
mately delivered, they must also be delivered on time.
Security
Security concerns fall under two categories: network security and data
security. Network security means that the network is accessible only to au-
thorized people and from authorized locations. Customers do not want
unauthorized people accessing their network (and hence accessing their
conﬁdential data). Physically isolating a network can provide some sense
of security, however, this is not enough to prevent intruders or hackers
from logically connecting to it from remote sites. It is necessary to secure a
customer network both physically and logically to ensure that intruders
cannot connect (logically or physically) to it.
Data security is related to contents of the data packets transported over
an IP network. Customers are becoming more and more conscious of
data security. With the rapid emergence of applications like e-commerce,
e-banking, and e-trading, conﬁdential information is commonly ex-
changed over private networks, as well as public networks like the Inter-
net. Steps must be taken to ensure the integrity and conﬁdentiality of the
transported data. Typically, a service provider network provides connec-
tivity for several customers. Since the same backbone network is used to
1.6 Customer Requirements and Service Provider and Vendor Goals
7

transport data packets from multiple customers, it is even more important
to ensure network and data security in order to win the conﬁdence of the
customers who use the service provider network to build their own private
data networks.
High availability customers require that the network services are highly
available. High availability means that the network services are not in-
terrupted due to failure of individual components or parts of the net-
work. The network services with high availability include connectivity
and quality of service.
Service-Level Agreement Reports
An additional customer requirement is the ability to monitor in real time
the service-level agreement (SLA) via a secure Web interface to the service
provider. Billing and reporting, therefore, should be made available in real
time to the customer via a secure Web interface. A typical SLA that cus-
tomers are interested in is the availability of the links between sites. They
may want to check the availability of the service during the preceding
month in order to verify that the service provider is adhering to the con-
tract. Another SLA that is of interest is the throughput, or link utiliza-
tion, which affects capacity planning. When the link utilization exceeds a
threshold value for a certain duration, it is time to upgrade the capacity of
the link to a higher speed.
Multiservices
The end customer, speciﬁcally the business customer, requires a single-
service, rich-access line. Rather than multiple access lines for each desired
service—for example, data, voice-over-IP, videostreaming, and so on—the
customer desires these services over one link. The result should be an at-
tractive service price and a wealth of feature options that include quality
of service and implement a class-of-service differentiation. The customer
requirement also includes any-to-any connectivity between sites. The cus-
tomer does not want to wait six weeks or three months for such a service
option.
Requirements of a Sample Customer
We now present a sample customer and their requirements. This example
represents the requirements of a typical customer and is examined once
again in Chapter 8 to validate the relevance of IP-based services for this
customer.
Consider a large corporation (Anonymous Inc.) with a head ofﬁce lo-
cated in one city and several large regional ofﬁces located in different cit-
ies. They need connectivity between the head ofﬁce and regional ofﬁces
for their voice, video, and data requirements (see Figure 1.1). The
8
Chapter 1: Introduction

videoconferencing facility is used to hold daily meetings between the
teams located in the regional corporate ofﬁces and the head ofﬁce. This
eliminates the time required to travel between the ofﬁces to attend these
meetings. The private branch exchange (PBX) is used to provide voice ser-
vices. Data servers are located in the head ofﬁce and are accessed by all the
users in the regional ofﬁces.
Some of the requirements of Anonymous Inc. are
●
Any-to-any connectivity for video, voice, and data applications
●
Bandwidth for video, voice, and data
●
Guaranteed bandwidth for data transfer between sites
●
Minimal delay or jitter in video and voice applications
●
Data security to ensure that the conﬁdentiality of the data trans-
ferred between sites is not compromised
●
Network security to prevent hackers from accessing their data
network
●
High availability of network service between all sites to ensure that
voice and video applications can be used during ofﬁce hours and
that data from all the regional ofﬁces can be backed up at the central
site every day
●
SLA reports on link utilization. Anonymous Inc. would like to moni-
tor the utilization of links for each regional ofﬁce and upgrade the

links to higher speed when the utilization exceeds a certain thresh-
old value over a certain period of time.
1.6.2
Service Provider Goals
Service providers have a number of goals to meet in order to make their
business proﬁtable:
Short development and deployment time of IP-based services
Scalable and stable backbone (core) network
Multiservices using the same network
Ease of network operations
Vendor support
Short Development and Deployment Time of IP-Based Services
Developing new services is necessary to remain competitive in the market.
In the data networking world, customer requirements keep changing rap-
idly, so service providers are forced to be innovative and offer new services
to meet those requirements. As a result of rapidly changing customer re-
quirements, gauging the right service development time cycle is challeng-
ing for the service provider.
Scalable and Stable Core Network
Scalability and reliability are key themes for service providers in develop-
ing services and supporting a large number of customers. Scalability is an
issue for core and edge networks. A scalable core network must support
trafﬁc from multiple services. The service provider must be able to offer
these services to many customers without having to add new equipment
to the core network. As long as the core network is scalable, it permits the
service provider to offer many IP-based services (to more customers) using
the same network. A scalable edge network can aggregate trafﬁc from multi-
ple customers. The addition of new customers must not result in a propor-
tional increase of edge devices.
A reliable network does not fail as a result of single point failures. That
is, failure of any single component (device or link) does not result in loss
of connectivity within the network as a whole. Redundancy is used to pro-
tect the network, so customers will not be affected by component failure.
Multiservices Using the Same Network
Voice and data networks are two of the different types of networks owned
by service providers. Typically, a service provider would like to reduce the
cost of maintaining these networks and at the same time be able to offer
10
Chapter 1: Introduction

all the services required by their customers. IP can be used to converge
these different services, such as voice-over-IP, IP-VPN, and videoconfer-
encing based on IP.
Ease of Network Operations
An efﬁcient network operations center (NOC) plays a key role in running
and maintaining a large IP network that supports several IP-based services.
Good network management system (NMS) tools can assist the operator in
the NOC to manage the network, detect and diagnose faults in a timely
manner, and take preventive action to avoid network outages. NMS tools
are also important for provisioning new customers and upgrading to meet
the requirements of existing customers. Provisioning large numbers of
customers in a short period of time is the key to rapid deployment of new
IP-based services and having a competitive edge in the market.
Vendor Support
Vendor support is necessary to get the technologies to roll out services in a
timely fashion. Ideally, vendors work with service providers to develop
the products they need. The service providers add input to product devel-
opment, and there is a relationship between the vendor’s product life cy-
cle and the service provider’s service life cycle. (This relationship is further
explored in the next chapter.)
Two conceptual case studies and one real-life case study representing
actual examples in the industry are discussed in Chapter 8. These case
studies focus on both the business and technical aspects of developing
and deploying IP-based services. Examples are used to highlight the re-
quirements of customers and the goals of service providers.
1.6.3
Vendor Goals
Vendors, or suppliers, must understand the services to be developed and
deployed so as to synchronize technology enhancement and needed fea-
tures with both the service provider and the end customer. Often there is a
lack of synchronization between these parties that results in immature
technology and unavailable features. Exchanging information requires
that the service provider, end customer, and vendor be partners. The ven-
dor goals are
Ensuring product mapping to the service offered by the service provider
Aligning technology with product availability
One example of vendor support toward product and service develop-
ment is a strategic partnership that fosters the exchange of personnel
between vendors and service providers. This can be an engineering
1.6 Customer Requirements and Service Provider and Vendor Goals
11

exchange program in which service provider engineers work on-site at the
vendor’s product development facilities, testing products and services for
feasibility and use in their own environment. Feedback is quick, since
the engineers are working directly with the product and service develop-
ers. Conversely, a vendor developer can work on-site with a service pro-
vider’s engineering team to understand how the products are deployed
and can use the information for further product development or enhance-
ments. An engineering exchange program provides rich feedback to both
parties. The implementation of such a program requires a nondisclosure
agreement for both sides, as the engineers will be working in the cen-
ter of product and service development. Another example of vendor sup-
port is to directly inquire about service provider requirements as a step
to product development. Service providers can also agree to evaluate pre-
production releases of products.
Taking the customer requirement of multiple service features offered
on a single access line requires that both the vendor-speciﬁc infrastructure
and the technology are capable of supporting this need. In the next chap-
ter, we will examine the product and technology development life cycle in
the supplier environment and the impact that this life cycle has on service
development and deployment.
1.7 Chapter Review
IP is a widely deployed protocol and can be used to develop and deploy
new services such as voice-over-IP and videoconferencing. In order to
stay competitive, service providers must understand not only the business
drivers and requirements of their customers, but also the dynamics that
affect their customers’ customers, as they move down the chain of value-
added service relevance and impact. Vendors also need to understand the
service provider business model and its impact on end customers in order
to contribute to the technology required for IP-based services. Chapters 2,
3, and 4 focus on the business aspects of service development and its im-
pact on Greenﬁeld and incumbent environments. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of-
fer practical technological examples reinforcing these business aspects.
Both the business and the technical examples converge in Chapter 8 in
case study scenarios. Are you ready for the journey?

Building the Case for
IP-Based Services
Service providers are confronted with growing challenges from deregula-
tion, new competition, cost pressures, emerging technology, and a con-
stant requirement to develop and deploy new services due to customer de-
mands. Customers are driven to reduce their own costs and maximize
their business revenue due to ﬂuctuations in the economy. This presents
an opportunity for service providers to deliver value-added services that
will help reduce customers’ costs. To develop and deploy these value-
added services, service providers require organizational adaptability, ﬂexi-
bility in the processes that are used, and an understanding of the pro-
cesses, tools, and participants that are involved. Processes such as a cus-
tomer request for a new service (service creation) and delivering a single
service for a set of customers are discussed in this chapter.
Participants in the service development process include the customer,
who originates a service request; the product manager, who is respon-
sible for service revenues; sales and marketing staff, who need to sell
and position the new service; engineering and operations staff, who con-
duct technical feasibility tests on the new service and integrate the net-
work management, reporting, and billing into the operations support sys-
tem (OSS); and, ﬁnally, the vendors, who provide the products needed to
develop and deploy the service. These roles are highlighted in this chap-
ter, along with the associated organizational politics that can affect the
process.
13

There is a relationship between the vendor’s product development cy-
cle and the service provider’s service development cycle. For example, lack
of a product can delay a service, and correspondingly, lack of service pro-
vider requirements and technology can delay a product. IP-based technol-
ogy can be used to improve service development by reducing the amount
of steps in the initial service creation process and by automating the infor-
mation exchange between participants during the service development
process. (Details are discussed in Chapter 6.)
2.1 Nuts and Bolts of Service Development
Service development comprises the service creation and service implementa-
tion processes. Service creation can be just an idea and represents the be-
ginning of the service development process. Service creation can be either
an actual request from a customer or a hypothetical scenario pondered by
the service provider: What if the company were to launch a particular ser-
vice? Who would be the customer? Who would be the target market? Ser-
vice implementation (also called service delivery) is the provisioning of the
service to the customer. The service can be delivered as per a delivery pro-
cess such as a customer order, followed by fulﬁllment of the order by the
service provider operations team (which includes service and network
management). The service provider uses the OSS to deliver the services.
Why develop services? Deﬁning and developing services based on
available products and technology is a complex task; however, the alter-
native, delivering and maintaining customized solutions, is simply not
scalable for a provider. Several questions need to be considered if a service
provider is to go forward with a new service: What are the drivers? Does
the customer drive the process? Is the process service-driven? What role
does an idea have in the process? Exploring these questions is the focus of
Section 2.2.
2.1.1
Deﬁnitions of Service and Service Provider
A service delivers solutions to customers that can have an impact on
the customer’s business (such as cost reduction), and is characterized by a
service-level agreement (SLA). The SLA deﬁnes service features—such as
availability (how often the service is operational), provisioning time (the
speed that a service can be delivered), and quality characteristics (such as
committing to the priority delivery of voice over data ﬁle transfers)—in a
contract between the customer and the service provider. Via the SLA, the
service is measurable and controllable, and failing to deliver an agreed-
upon SLA typically results in a credit to the customer by the service pro-
vider. Services are most often developed for use by a large number of
customers, resulting in an economy of scale—that is, the service can be
deployed with joint resources and processes, such as using a single
14
Chapter 2: Building the Case for IP-Based Services

network to develop and deliver multiple services. A value-added service is a
service that differentiates itself from other services by, for example, in-
stead of offering only voice, offering a palette of services such as Internet
access, Web hosting, e-commerce, voice-over-IP, and videoconferencing.
Thus, a value-added service addresses a variety of customer requirements
and results in a high return on investment, adding value to both the cus-
tomer and the service provider.
Delivering a service is the function of the service provider, who assumes
the risk to develop and deploy the service. There is a value-added chain as-
sociated with the service provider role that starts with the technology sup-
plier and ends, at the top of the chain, with the business provider. The ser-
vice provider function is in the middle of the chain. If you are a service
provider, it may be interesting for you to understand the business growth
opportunity you have. As a telecommunications company, what does it
mean to claim to be “a full-service provider”? If you are a customer, under-
standing the business scope of your service provider may impact what
services you can expect—for example, are you contracting for rented tech-
nology from your service provider but are responsible for the actual ser-
vice yourself?
The technology supplier is the equipment manufacturer—of operating
systems, software, routers, switches, workstations, and so on. The tech-
nology provider integrates the equipment into the service, transferring the
technology for turnkey solutions. The service provider, then, trans-
forms both the products and the technology into services. The business
provider arranges for customers to outsource business processes that are
not part of their core commercial activity, such as accounting and payroll
processing.
2.2 Service Development Process
The service development process can be depicted as passing through a se-
ries of tollgates, from service creation to full-service implementation. Each
tollgate has an input and an output. The process can be stopped at any
point if there is insufﬁcient input to continue. The tollgate concept pro-
vides business case accountability as well as structure for managing the
process itself. (A marketing plan is linked to the business case in the ser-
vice development process but not explicitly described in this section; mar-
keting plan details are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.)
Figure 2.1 depicts a service development process example using six toll-
gates. Let’s take a look at the steps and decisions required during the
process.
Tollgate 1 is the idea that can be presented in the form of a paper pro-
posal and responds to a service ﬁt in the company product portfolio. The
portfolio identiﬁes potential customers and determines whether or not
there are service cannibalization issues that the service provider needs to
2.2 Service Development Process
15

worry about: service cannibalization is the erosion of an existing service as a
result of introducing a new one. Service positioning, how a service provider
will position a new service in the market, is also very important early in
the service development process. The decision to proceed from tollgate 1
to tollgate 2 is an indication that there is an opportunity in the market for
the service. This indication is general and unconﬁrmed by market re-
search; an example would be an overview of market trends.
The output for tollgate 1 is input to a business case draft for tollgate 2—
for example, a technical feasibility overview that conﬁrms the availability
of the technology and products required for the new service. The decision
to proceed from tollgate 2 to tollgate 3 results from the conﬁrmation that
the service is unique.
The output for tollgate 2 is input to a preliminary business case for toll-
gate 3. Examples of such input include competitive analysis; strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis; marketing goals,
strategy, and budget; and revenue potential, all of which are part of the
marketing plan and present the competitive landscape of the market for
the new service. (These are further discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.) The

decision to proceed from tollgate 2 to tollgate 3 is a business judgment
that the service provider can earn revenue from the new service.
The output from tollgate 3 serves as input to the full business case for
tollgate 4. Examples of such input are (1) why the company will develop
the service, (2) what tools are necessary for service development, and (3)
how the service will be developed and with what resources. Tollgate 4 is
the most critical phase in this service development model because the
business case identiﬁes the risks the company must assume in order to
develop and deploy the new service. The decision elements affecting
whether to proceed from tollgate 4 to tollgate 5 are attractiveness of the
business case, identiﬁcation of a pilot customer, realistic service launching
date, and resource availability. In short, can the service provider develop
the service? Table 2.1 summarizes the key issues associated with tollgate 4,
the business plan.
The output for tollgate 4 is input for tollgate 5, the pilot, testing, and
service validation phase. These examples can be seen in Table 2.1 under
“How will the service be developed?” Inputs are resources to develop the
service, customers willing to pilot the service, required vendors, risks asso-
ciated with the service development like failing to launch on time, and
the ﬁnancial model that identiﬁes the cost of developing the service and
the potential revenues. (Examples of ﬁnancial models and service pricing
can be found in Chapters 3, 4, and 8.)
Tollgate 5 speciﬁes the service, service-level agreement, service price,
service delivery process, OSS architecture, service management, lab, test-
ing, and customer pilot results. New service training for the service pro-
vider’s operations, sales and marketing, and engineering teams are pro-
vided during tollgate 5.
The decision elements affecting whether to proceed from tollgate 5 to
tollgate 6 are lab test results conﬁrming that both the technology and
product are feasible for the service; customer pilot results conﬁrming that
the customer has signed off on the service pilot; the service management
announcing that it has integrated the OSS architecture successfully; and,
ﬁnally, the service delivery organization being successfully trained for the
new service.
We are now close to full-service launch at tollgate 6. The output from
tollgate 5 to tollgate 6 includes service reliability and performance as a re-
sult of the testing, completion of service training, completion of market-
ing and sales plans, and completion of service delivery documentation,
such as the operations manual, engineering manual, and service imple-
mentation manual. Tollgate 6 output includes service fact sheets, techni-
cal white papers, service description, service price, and contract templates.
(Service packaging, pricing, and ﬁnancial models are described in Chap-
ters 3, 4, and 8.) The service can now be launched!
We have just explored a service development process. If you are a ser-
vice provider, this process may be familiar, as it is used in several provider

environments. If you are a customer, you now realize what is involved in
service development and can see what function you have in this process.
Namely, you can drive service development. The following section identi-
ﬁes the players and their roles in the service development process.
2.2.1
The Participants
Service development participants include the customer, the service pro-
vider, and the vendor: the customer requests the service of the service
provider, who in turn provides product and technology requirements to
the vendor, who delivers these products and technologies to the service
provider, who then develops and provisions a service for the customer.
Customers drive the requirements for services, and services are devel-
oped for their speciﬁc needs. An example might be to add IP-based prod-
ucts to the service portfolio and to provide services like Web hosting and
e-commerce. Customers are generally interested in lowering their opera-
tional costs in hardware and software maintenance. The service provider
thus needs to understand how the total cost of hardware and software
ownership in a customer environment impacts the customer’s business, in
order to offer value-added services.
Vendors supply products that will be used to develop and deploy a ser-
vice. Obviously, technology is necessary for developing products, and ser-
vice providers and vendors can both play a part in driving technology
standards in such forums as the International Telecommunications Union
(ITU) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Now, what can go wrong in these relationships? If the service provider
does not communicate requirements accurately, or if the vendor misun-
derstands the requirements, then the result is a product that the service
provider cannot use, and a customer who has no service. For successful
service deployment to occur, service providers need to clearly identify
product requirements to vendors. In response, vendors need to listen care-
fully to these requirements and offer a stable product in the time frame re-
quested. Should a technology not exist, both parties have an opportunity
to jointly develop the technology. There are risks for both parties, how-
ever, and they can be equally challenging to overcome. Vendors risk re-
leasing products that service providers will not buy, and service providers
risk having products released that do not align with their own require-
ments because they failed to provide the necessary input to these vendors
or vendors did not understand the requirements. As seen to be true with
customers and service providers, communication is also critical between
vendors and service providers.
What about the service provider organization itself? The key players
here are the chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO) and the sales and marketing,
product management, ﬁnance, engineering, operations, and service man-
agement departments.
2.2 Service Development Process
19

●
The CEO of a service provider organization sets the vision for the
company, outlining what the business focus is—for example, to be
number one in value-added services in the domestic market and to
use IP-based technology to automate collaborative tools for the sup-
ply chain, e-commerce, and training.
●
The sales and marketing staff communicates end-customer require-
ments for service development to product management.
●
Product management looks at the service from a proﬁt-and-loss per-
spective and leads the service development process and service life
cycle (depicted in Figure 2.2). The service life cycle is implemented
in phases similar to service development, but includes service en-
hancements and retirement. A service enhancement is a feature added
to a service, such as quality of service (QoS) added to a basic IP-VPN
service for voice-over-IP. It is not necessary to implement the entire
service development process for an enhancement.
The last phase in the life cycle is to retire a service. A signal to re-
tire a service is when it has become a commodity, that is, widely
available in the market from competitors. If the only differentia-
tion at that point is price, then similar services will ﬂood the market
at lower and lower prices, thus eroding business margins for the

original service provider. This means that the company will make
less money on each dollar of sales, thus adversely impacting overall
business proﬁtability. The product manager is responsible for direct-
ing the service life cycle and working with marketing to position the
company’s services.
●
The ﬁnancial department provides accounting support for both re-
ceivables and payables. Logistics and human resources are part of the
ﬁnance function. In service development, this department offers in-
put as to the cost of additional resources and capital investment. It
can also direct changes and process management. Process management
describes how an individual and/or group manages its workﬂow ac-
tivities. Ultimately, customer satisfaction is more than just achieving
service speciﬁcations; it is focusing on ways to please the customer.
●
The engineering department selects the architecture that is used to
develop services. This team performs technical feasibility studies
and works with vendors in technology and product testing. The
team has a leading role in customer pilots and works closely with
operations.
●
The operations department administers the network conﬁguration
management, fault management, and change management. The
group also maintains IT systems that are used to manage databases.
Operations will look at vendor products for manageability in the ser-
vice development process.
●
Service management is responsible for customer support, help desk
and call center functions, billing and reporting, capacity planning,
and security. This department is in charge of the OSS architecture
and manages customer SLAs.
2.3 Service Development Dynamics
In this section, we explore those dynamics that can either hinder or facili-
tate the service development process. One such area is politics. Politics be-
tween organizations and companies can be a nightmare if not managed
properly. Another source of tension can be due to the vendor’s product de-
velopment cycle and its effect on the service provider’s development cy-
cle. Is the vendor pushing a product? Is the service provider pulling a
product? Who stands to gain? What about the customer?
2.3.1
Politics
In a service provider environment, particularly at an incumbent com-
pany, politics are due largely to legacy organizations (departments or sub-
sidiaries) having control for a period of time. An example of a legacy
2.3 Service Development Dynamics
21

organization is voice, which has traditionally been a source of revenue for
providers. Data services like Internet access are offered by a separate orga-
nization within the company, transmission by yet another. These organi-
zations do not necessarily communicate with one another, because there
has been no requirement to do so.
Changing regulations have opened the markets. Since 1998, long-
distance voice revenues have consistently declined in the United States.
The need to compensate for this loss with a new value-added service, such
as bundled data and voice-over-IP, has resulted in an environment of
change within these provider companies, as they transition from the tra-
ditional telephony focus to IP.
The transmission group manages the Layer 1 and Layer 2 services, such
as leased-line, frame relay, and ATM, and often views IP as a transmission
medium. The transmission and voice groups together participate in the
ITU to develop telecommunications standards. Conversely, the IP-based
services group has functioned separately, providing Internet access and
following IETF initiatives for standards development. The groups have
distinct cultures, often called bell head (traditional culture) and net head
(Internet culture).
Each group has established relationships with vendors that are compet-
itors. This can be an obstacle in product selection for service develop-
ment. The result is that one group and vendor will play against another
group and vendor, creating havoc in the service development process. We
term this group mobbing, and it is negative for a company: such chaos re-
sults in management intervention to resolve the deadlock, as well as de-
lays in the service development. Service development organizations must
recognize these distinctions and address the issues from the beginning.
Examples of these differences are highlighted in Table 2.2.
Sometimes customers themselves are involved in these politics. For ex-
ample, a vendor that has a good relationship with a customer may prod
that customer to pressure the service provider into delivering a service
with the vendor’s product. The customer will dangle a business contract
to the service provider in order to leverage the product selection.
What can a service development organization do to prevent such poli-
tics? Recognizing that the politics exist is the ﬁrst step. Involving all par-
ties in the service development process with clear communication regard-
ing goals, project scope, and deliverables is the second step. As will be seen
in Chapter 8, a success factor in both the conceptual and real-life case
studies is the communication by the CEO, which can transform a com-
pany and its business focus. This transformation often means a cultural
change is required to support the new corporate model. A company needs
to recognize the cultural distinctions between the two groups we’ve dis-
cussed and integrate the best of both worlds into a new organization ready
to develop and deploy services jointly.

Chapter 2: Building the Case for IP-Based Services

2.3.2
Vendor Product Development Cycle
The vendor product development cycle is represented in tollgate 1, which
identiﬁes technical feasibility and product availability. At the very begin-
ning of the service development process, service creation, the team is
already exploring technical alternatives and reviewing product choices.
How does a vendor develop products? Who provides the input? Factors af-
fecting product development include technology availability, market re-
quirements, and vendor competition.
●
Technology availability. If a technology is available, products can be
developed using it; if a technology is not available and a product is
required, then vendors tend to deliver a proprietary solution while
working in standards organizations to drive this proprietary archi-
tecture for acceptance by other vendors and service providers.
Clearly, getting acceptance of a proposed architecture will facilitate
product development, and for that particular vendor assure an im-
plementation of the product as an industry standard. For example,

the development of the multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) architec-
ture started with a vendor’s proprietary implementation, based on
tag switching technology, and resulted in the release of time-to-
market products from the vendor while the MPLS standard had been
developed (Davie and Rekhter 2000). (Time-to-market refers to early
product releases to the market while the architecture is still being de-
ﬁned and standardized with a goal to capture customer mind-set to-
ward adopting the product.)
●
Market requirements. Vendors will poll customers as to their require-
ments, desired features, business goals, and priorities for develop-
ment. Internally, vendors will prioritize product development based
on potential business opportunity. For example, how committed is
the service provider to having a speciﬁc product? As the service pro-
vider assumes a business risk to develop services, the vendor assumes
a business risk to develop products.
●
Vendor competition. By developing a product, how is the vendor dif-
ferentiating itself from its competition in features, scalability, and
price? It is not enough to be ﬁrst in the market if the product is
not stable. The vendor’s motivation is to capture market share
and be market leader. Service providers complain that vendors are
either too slow or too sloppy: slow in getting the exact product
mix when needed and sloppy by releasing time-to-market vari-
ants that are not stable. In fact, new product releases are often be-
tween 9 and 18 months from the identiﬁcation of these require-
ments to the vendor, but are still misaligned with service provider
expectations. This may be due to the unavailability of technology, a
change in service provider requirements, or a misunderstanding on
the part of the vendor. Improving in these areas may set a vendor
apart.
The product development cycle is similar to the service development
process (see Figure 2.3): The business requirements and opportunities are
prioritized for development; a product is designed and then tested inter-
nally to validate basic features before customer pilot release; input from
the customer pilot are integrated into the product prior to general release;
there is usually an internal test run to assure that the basic features are still
operational; and the product is then released to the market. Later, vendors
will integrate feature enhancements to maintain the product’s competi-
tive edge. Finally, the product will be retired as soon as there is market sat-
uration, indicated by large presence of similar products with no differenti-
ation other than price.
Vendors and service providers must work closely together to reduce
gaps in product and service development. One way would be for providers
to include vendors in the process. Another would be to exchange
24
Chapter 2: Building the Case for IP-Based Services

product development requirements monthly or quarterly. Vendors need
to provide a status of product development as it applies to the process.
This is a delicate subject, as this information is conﬁdential and of course
cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of a competitor. The issue of con-
ﬁdentiality also applies to a provider when developing a service. Thus,
there must be a degree of trust between vendors and service providers that
supports both product and service development while maintaining con-
ﬁdentiality. What is important for both parties is being clear about re-
quirements as input from a service provider and product output from a
vendor. The result should be a close alignment of the vendor’s product to
the provider’s service.
2.4 Problems with the Service Development Process
In examining the input/output interaction for each tollgate in Figure 2.1,
we do not see time metrics. When asked, the service providers we inter-
viewed stated that it took an average of between 9 and 18 months for a
service launch. The sales and marketing teams for some of these service
providers feel that this is too long. The general feedback from corporate
customers is that service providers tend to be slow when it comes to

providing services that address their requirements. The tendency by sales
and marketing is to push aggressively for customized solutions so as to
close the gaps between customer requirements and a service launch. The
result is often friction in the service development team as this group tries
to develop and deploy services for a market. So what is the ideal time for a
service launch? Let’s look at the process itself.
The reason for the longer time periods (up to 18 months) to develop
and launch services is multifold. While a service provider can inﬂuence
some factors, if a vendor is not able to provide technology or products,
then the launch time frame is out of the control of the service provider.
However, the service provider can exert pressure on the vendor to provide
the required products and technology within the time frame by not buy-
ing products unless the schedule is met.
One of the main reasons for delays is service implementation. Service
providers generally do not have the right tools and processes to speed up
this phase of service development. Most of the tasks in service implemen-
tation are done manually and are prone to errors; valuable time is lost in
correcting manual errors and ﬁnding the right information. For example,
the lack of tools to manage IP addressing can result in incorrect provision-
ing of customer devices in the service provider network. Consequently,
the service will not be implemented and customers will not have con-
nectivity. Inaccurate information exchange between service development
participants can be another reason for a delay in implementation. For ex-
ample, the IP addressing plan for a customer’s network implementation
might be transmitted from the sales department to the provisioning de-
partment as a hard copy, which is then lost. Due to the loss of the hard
copy, the customer network cannot be implemented.
The second main cause of delays is the lack of automation in informa-
tion ﬂow between the tollgates. This increases the time required for each
tollgate, because valuable time is lost searching for documents. For exam-
ple, the engineering team might develop a technical solution based on the
number of customers that have to be supported by the service. Inaccurate
information about the number of customers given by the marketing de-
partment to the engineering department can result in a technical solution
that may not scale as the number of customers increases. In this example,
automating the ﬂow of information between the departments will help
the technical team keep up to date on the number of customers and de-
velop a solution that will scale as needed.
Finally, to avoid delays, a service provider may need to deﬁne the scope
of the deliverables. For example, a preliminary business case, business case
draft, and business case can be converged to the business case with clearly
deﬁned deliverables. This action requires evaluating the efﬁciency of the
processes and looking at ways to improve them. IP-based technology can
improve the implementation issues, but the service provider deﬁnes the
scope.

Chapter 2: Building the Case for IP-Based Services

2.5 Role of IP in the Service Development Process
We have examined the service development process, as well as dynam-
ics such as politics and the vendor product life cycle. We have also looked
at some problems associated with the process. We now explore the fol-
lowing questions: Can automation or implementing IP-based tools im-
prove the process? What will be the business impact of such an
improvement?
IP has a role in service provisioning and service upgrades. A common
thread is automation—IP-based technology is used to automate these
functions. The OSS architecture is a composite of these functions and is
central to service development and delivery. Here, we examine the role of
IP in each of these functions.
2.5.1
Automation
Automation can help speed the service development process by address-
ing those factors that delay the process, such as information exchange.
For example, the service product manager and marketing manager can use
a Web interface to create a service and produce both the marketing plan
and business case electronically. The documentation output of the toll-
gates can be updated and exchanged electronically among the service de-
velopment participants.
While automation can address some of the problems highlighted ear-
lier, success factors for this automation include the work and research
needed for input such as the business case and the marketing plan, as well
as the accuracy of the information itself. Active engagement is required
with the customer, the market, and the vendor. An engagement example
would be a customer advisory board within the service provider organiza-
tion. Participants could be strategic (leading) customers representing des-
ignated market segments. Such an advisory board could provide input to
the service development process, speciﬁcally to the business and market-
ing plans.
Scope of Process Deliverables
One area for improvement is to deﬁne the scope of the process deliver-
ables—for example, tollgate 1 is the service proposal or request by the cus-
tomer, and tollgates 2, 3, and 4 from the original tollgate process can now
be converged into tollgate 2 for the business case and marketing plan.
Tollgate 3 comprises the product manager’s service description and the pi-
lot documentation with ready-for-service launch at tollgate 4. Figure 2.4
depicts this example.
In describing the outputs of the process deliverables, tollgate 1 identi-
ﬁes customer requirements and beneﬁts while tollgate 2 responds to the
2.5 Role of IP in the Service Development Process
27

business case attractiveness and the marketing strategy. Tollgate 3 assures
that the service elements are ready, training has been completed, and the
pilot customer has signed off on the service pilot; tollgate 4 leads to the
full-service launch with the marketing, product brochures, and contract
templates in place.
2.5.2
Implementation
Another area where automation can be used to improve the service devel-
opment process is in service implementation. Once the service has been
launched, it needs to be provisioned, and IP-based technology can be used
to automate the workﬂow.
The problematic nature of manual processes can be seen in service
provisioning. For example, a customer sends an address plan in a spread-
sheet format. The service provider operations group receives it, and an op-
erator then manually enters the addresses for routers that need to be in-
stalled at the customer site. Suppose an address is typed incorrectly in a
router conﬁguration. The router will be shipped to the customer location
but will fail to become active. Time will be spent troubleshooting the
problem until the operations group realizes its error. The router will then
be sent back for a reconﬁguration of the address and once again sent to
the customer location for installation. The contracted provisioning win-
dow has now slipped, thus resulting in a breach of contract between the
service provider and the customer. Sound like an exaggeration? Unfortu-
nately, this problem is very common.
With automation, the information is entered at a single entry point.
This information can be either correct or incorrect. If incorrect, it is easier
to trace the problem back to the single entry point. Using automation, in
the previous example, a customer could provide the address plan via a
Web interface to the service provider’s operations group. The provisioning
tool would enter the address in a database and generate the router con-
ﬁguration automatically. Thus, the beneﬁt of automation is efﬁciency in
service delivery to the customer.

Service Upgrades
Service upgrades are another activity that must be automated in order to
reduce delays in service implementation; IP technology can automate the
process. An example of a service upgrade would be an increase in band-
width: Via a Web interface, the customer orders an increase in bandwidth.
The order is ﬂagged for a bandwidth increase by the service upgrade en-
gine that is part of the OSS architecture. The request is routed electroni-
cally to the capacity-planning engine to determine capacity availability. If
capacity is available, the bandwidth is increased for the customer. Upon
completion, a notiﬁcation is sent electronically to the billing engine to in-
voice the customer for the increased bandwidth. After the change has
been made in the billing engine, the customer receives an electronic no-
tiﬁcation from the provider that the service upgrade has been completed.
The customer is able to validate the upgrade via an online report display-
ing the bandwidth increase and the new service price.
If capacity is unavailable, then the customer is notiﬁed by the reporting
engine about the current status. The time elapsed between the online or-
der and delivery of the upgrade is between 15 minutes and one hour.
Without this automation, a customer can wait from 24 hours to three
months.
OSS Processes
Figure 2.5 depicts OSS business processes and interfaces. Provisioning is
part of the service delivery process in OSS. Other OSS process interactions
include service usage, which impacts billing and ﬁnancial accounting, ser-
vice assurance, which manages the SLAs, and service creation, for the gen-
eration of a new service. Automating these OSS processes is key to reduc-
ing delays in the service development process.
2.5.3
Putting It All Together
IP-based technology is important in automating service development,
provisioning, and upgrades. Key business issues include the time it takes
to launch a service, provision for an existing service, and activate an up-
grade. It is critical to minimize human errors associated with manual pro-
cesses. Maximizing workﬂow is the real effect of automation in a service
provider environment.
2.6 IP-Based Services
Moving from service development to the actual services, we ask, What
is the motivation to develop IP-based services? What are the customer
2.6 IP-Based Services
29

beneﬁts? What interest does a vendor have in them? This section exam-
ines the reasons for developing IP-based services.
2.6.1
Service Provider Motivation
The main reason for a service provider to develop and deploy IP-based ser-
vices is to gain revenue. In common business language, this translates to
making money. One example of the shift from voice to IP-based services
can be found in North America, where incumbents have experienced a de-
cline in long-distance voice revenue since 1998. For one major U.S. in-
cumbent, this decline translated into a $14 billion loss in long-distance
voice from 1998 to 2001.
Conversely, the North American market (as well as the international
market) has seen an increase in data trafﬁc over the same period. This
trend is attributed to an emphasis on e-business applications and cost

reduction driven by enterprise customers. Examples are customer relation-
ship management (CRM) and converged voice and data. Enterprise cus-
tomers are pressured to operate their businesses efﬁciently and keep
costs under control. Consequently, service providers worldwide are look-
ing for revenue generation opportunities to replace voice (which has
become a commodity) with a value-added service that fulﬁlls customer
requirements.
Reducing operational expenses is another motivation for service pro-
viders to construct an IP-based infrastructure. Service providers have mul-
tiple networks and OSS capabilities for various services, such as PSTN for
voice and frame relay and ATM for data. Multiple networks create opera-
tional complexity and costs for service providers, thus, converging ser-
vices to a single infrastructure will reduce costs and complexity.
Platform simplicity and value-added services are objectives for service
providers, with the most important goal being to garner revenue from
the new services. Both objectives can be achieved via IP-based tech-
nology. This transition is evolutionary for service providers with legacy
infrastructures.
2.6.2
Customer Beneﬁts
What are the drivers for IP-based services from a customer perspective?
For customers, a value-added service describes the capability to extend re-
quirements, such as quality of service for voice, on top of a base service
that can be delivered simply, quickly, and for an uncomplicated service
cost. Without IP-based services, customers contract for data services via
frame relay and voice via PSTN, from different organizations within the
service provider company. The provisioning for these services may vary,
perhaps depending on a combination of bandwidth availability and ef-
fects from manual processes, like conﬁguration errors. In this case, the
customer will receive multiple invoices, depending upon the services, and
may need to track these multiple invoices (often manually). The result is
that the customer can lose track of the costs and impacts of these services;
the lack of clarity is a problem.
IP-based services make the process simpler. They permit customers to
request service enhancements, for example, data service based on IP, such
as a corporate IP-VPN, voice-over-IP, or a videoconferencing-over-IP pack-
age via a Web interface. With IP-based services, the customer can receive
a bundled service package for data, voice, and videoconferencing. The
billing for this package may be at a ﬁxed price, depending upon the band-
width and SLA that the customer has requested, and the customer will
receive a single invoice. Customers can also view service reports via
a Web interface in real time and can track the service impact on their
business. Finally, the provisioning will be less complex, since it is
automated.
2.6 IP-Based Services

2.6.3
Vendor Interest
Vendors are interested in developing a platform that can be used by ser-
vice providers to build IP-based services. A vendor’s goal is to be the mar-
ket leader in a service provider segment. Service providers can consider
market leadership as a factor for vendor selection. Alternatively, as cus-
tomer requirements drive the service development process, vendors are
concerned about offering end-to-end products that will be used to deploy
these value-added services. Suggesting product solutions to end customers
is also a vendor activity. The desired result is that customers will, in turn,
request the service provider to implement these product solutions and put
them into a service package.
2.6.4
Service Examples
IP-based service examples include LAN connection-over-IP; corporate IP-
VPNs; metro Ethernet-access services like Ethernet to the business (ETTB) or
Ethernet to the home (ETTH); Internet access with managed ﬁrewall for se-
curity; and remote access for telecommuting developed on top of a corpo-
rate IP-VPN. LAN connection-over-IP may be a managed router service
where the requirements are high bandwidth (155 Mb/sec or more) and
any-to-any connectivity. Contrast this service with LAN connection-over-
frame relay, where the topology is typically a hub and spoke and there is a
limitation to available bandwidth, typically not more than 45 Mb/sec.
The any-to-any pricing for a LAN connection-over-frame relay can be pro-
hibitive for the customer. (An example of these differences can be found
in Chapter 8.)
The customer may order a corporate IP-VPN for a base intranet service.
A base service package may be to provide an “any-to-any” connectivity in
the form of Layer 3 VPNs. The service is managed by the service provider.
The end customer purchases a committed access rate based on IP. The ser-
vice provider then manages the service, provisions the customer’s equip-
ment, ensures Layer 3 connectivity between the customer’s VPN sites, and
assures that there is no VPN leakage between other customers as part of
the security offering.
The customer may request voice-over-IP as an addition to the IP-VPN
service. The service provider then adds it to the service bundle. The service
provider can offer metro Ethernet services to customers who want to ex-
tend their LANs remotely. An example is a gigabit Ethernet service offered
on a per port basis; although a metro Ethernet service is Layer 2, it can be
offered as an enhancement to IP-based services.
Moving up the value-added chain, service providers can offer Web
hosting and managed server packages to customers. The price will depend
on bandwidth and hard disk requirements. These services can also be bun-
dled for price simplicity (for the customer).
32
Chapter 2: Building the Case for IP-Based Services

Finally, a service provider can be a business provider by offering e-
commerce services such as business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer
(B2C). B2B exchanges are transactions between companies, such as price
negotiation, product speciﬁcation, and delivery targets. B2B involves sup-
ply chain management. Examples of B2B service beneﬁts are reducing pa-
perwork cost and efﬁcient inventory management. B2C applies to any
company that sells products or services to consumers. Examples are on-
line retailers like Amazon.com and online services like banking, travel,
and health information. B2C is often attributed to the ailing dot-com phe-
nomenon. Figure 2.6 depicts the business provider model.

2.7 Greenﬁeld and Incumbent
How do IP-based services apply to a Greenﬁeld service provider? One ad-
vantage that a new service provider has is a lack of legacy infrastructure
and business engineering processes. The Greenﬁeld player can build an IP-
based company from the beginning and does not need to address the
transitional, cultural, and organizational issues that an incumbent does.
For an incumbent, IP-based services offer a new revenue opportunity
and a replacement for lost revenue in long-distance voice. Incumbents
typically have legacy issues, such as multiple networks, but can migrate
toward a single-platform, multiple-service infrastructure. The incumbent
can transform itself to an IP-based company. We take a look at Greenﬁeld
and incumbent challenges in Chapters 3, 4, and 8.
2.8 Chapter Review
The key objectives for a service provider are rapid service introduction and
improved quality of service at a lower cost, ultimately resulting in reve-
nue. These objectives can only be achieved using IP-based technology for
service development and delivery automation. IP-based technology re-
duces service layer complexity and its associated operating costs. Finally,
customers beneﬁt from IP-based services by having value-added service
packages, quicker provisioning cycles, and clear pricing.
As a customer, you can inﬂuence the service development process by
communicating your business priorities to your provider. As a vendor,
you can inﬂuence the process by releasing products that are essential to
the provider’s architecture. As a service provider, you can determine your
business direction by listening closely to your customers and clearly com-
municating requirements and priorities to your vendors.

Greenﬁeld Service
Providers: Opportunities
and Challenges
This chapter explores Greenﬁeld service providers and their business po-
tential for developing IP-based services. It investigates reasons why a
Greenﬁeld service provider would deploy IP-based services, identiﬁes al-
ternative technologies to these services, gives examples of IP-based ser-
vices and pricing, examines the challenges and competitors for a Green-
ﬁeld provider, and highlights the beneﬁts for implementing IP-based
services. Becoming and remaining competitive drives any company. How
can IP-based technology help a Greenﬁeld service provider seize and re-
tain a competitive edge?
3.1 Deﬁnition of Greenﬁeld
The term Greenﬁeld describes a neophyte service provider as opposed to an
established or incumbent service provider. Greenﬁeld service providers are
new entrants in the telecommunications market. As alternatives to in-
cumbents, they can provide customers with different service choices, such
as applications software for payroll or expenses. These entrants often fo-
cus on speciﬁc customer segments, such as small to medium enterprises
35

or particular customer geographic locations. An incumbent is likely to
concentrate on multiple customer segments, such as large enterprises as
well as small to medium enterprises and multiple geographic locations.
Service differentiation and the time to market are key factors (but not the
only ones) of the success of Greenﬁeld service providers.
Greenﬁeld providers are in the business to offer value-added services.
“Value-added” can mean different things to different communities of in-
terest. As an example, in the IT community, value-added is associated with
network access, as in a value-added network (VAN). For ﬁnancial analysts
and business managers, value-added equates to a ﬁnancial performance
measure, as in economic value-added (EVA). In keeping with the theme of
this book, value-added describes an enhancement to customer productiv-
ity as well as service provider productivity using IP-based technology.
Greenﬁeld service providers may be classiﬁed as follows: competitive lo-
cal exchange carriers (CLECs), reseller CLECs, bandwidth brokers, and x ser-
vice providers (xSPs), where x may be application, management, Internet,
or a combination of these service provider types. These categories are dis-
cussed in the next section. The classiﬁcation identiﬁes the business em-
phasis of these various Greenﬁeld service providers, which helps in assess-
ing the applicability of IP-based services to these companies.
3.1.1
CLECs and Reseller CLECs
In the United States, a CLEC competes with incumbent carriers by provid-
ing its own network. The availability of unbundled network elements (UNEs)
is signiﬁcant to CLECs. A UNE is any facility or equipment used to provi-
sion a telecommunications service as well as its features, functions, and
capabilities. The local loop is the most important UNE available to a CLEC,
as it connects the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) switches to the
ILEC’s customers. The local loop provides the capability for CLECs to con-
nect their switches to ILEC switches, thus providing CLECs access to ILEC
customers.
Being a reseller is another option for CLECs. Per the Telecommunica-
tions Act of 1996, any telecommunications services ILECs offer at retail
must be available to CLECs at a wholesale discount. The CLEC avoids
an investment in switches, ﬁber-optic transmission facilities, or colloca-
tion arrangements by being a reseller. A CLEC may decide on being a re-
seller, providing its own switching infrastructure or a combination of both
approaches.
Examples of CLECs include U.S.-based cable operators AOL Time
Warner, IP Communications, and Birch Telecom. CLECs provide services
such as local telephone service, long-distance telephone service, dial-up
Internet access, integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber
line (DSL), and Web hosting.
36
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

3.1.2
Bandwidth Brokers
The term bandwidth broker has different meanings—for example, it applies
to a manager of network usage within a domain that provides reservations
for resources and negotiates reservations with other domains. In this con-
text, a bandwidth broker sets a policy for IP-based routers as deﬁned by
the Bandwidth Broker Advisory Council (BBAC). This group is part of the
Internet2 Initiative to build a test bed for new IP-based quality-of-service
(QoS) technologies.
For Greenﬁeld service providers, bandwidth brokers are providers that
offer bandwidth as a service. The bandwidth is sold as large connectivity
pipes, where the minimum connection may start as T1/E1. Other carriers
would be the typical customers for bandwidth brokers. Examples of band-
width brokers include Qwest and Level 3 Communications.
3.1.3
x Service Providers
This section reﬂects the development of service providers with a speciﬁc
business focus for customers. Some of these terms have been used inter-
changeably, adding to the confusion as to what “x” truly denotes for the
customer. In addition to being a particular type of xSP, a Greenﬁeld service
provider can also be a combination of these service providers. What are
the common xSPs and their business focuses?
Application Service Providers
Application service providers (ASPs) offer customers access to software appli-
cations and provide support over the Internet. ASPs are independent soft-
ware vendors (ISVs) that deliver access to applications such as accounting,
data warehousing, document management, e-commerce, legal services,
medical services, real estate services, retail services, and customer training
over the Internet. ASPs permit customers to avoid support overhead by
outsourcing the installation and management of an application to an ASP.
Some examples of ASPs are Corio for enterprise resource planning (ERP),
cMeRun for desktop applications like word processors and spreadsheets,
NetLedger for accounting and ﬁnancial applications, and PeopleSoft for
collaboration and e-business applications.
Management Service Providers
Management service providers (MSPs) offer network management and
application-monitoring services to multiple customers over a network on
a subscription basis. MSPs deliver system management services, while
ASPs deliver business applications to their customers. Both MSPs and ASPs
offer service delivery via an Internet or network connection based on IP.
3.1 Deﬁnition of Greenﬁeld
37

Examples of MSPs include InteQ, offering 24/7 monitoring and report-
ing for customer IT infrastructures; and Coradiant, which provisions cus-
tomers’ mission-critical locations and manages, maintains, and monitors
those sites from a network operations center. Other MSPs are Internet
Security Systems, providing outsourced managed security services such
as security assessment, intrusion detection, and life cycle security consult-
ing; and Nuclio Corporation, which offers design, implementation, 24/7
management, monitoring, and Web-based reporting on customers’ server-
based operations.
MSP customers are enterprises, ASPs, and emerging dot-coms, and they
typically own servers, operating systems, and applications. Services in-
clude remote application and monitoring support, database backup,
maintenance, recovery, and ﬁrewalls and other security applications.
Host Service Providers
Host service providers (HSPs) provide space and services to host Web-based
content for customers. HSP types are shared, dedicated, and co-location.
Shared hosting provides a hosted site or content to a customer that is
shared with other sites. Via dedicated hosting, customers access their data
from a server that is leased or rented from their service provider. With co-
location, a customer selects a server, installs the software, and then places
the server in an HSP facility using ﬂoor space provided by the HSP. HSPs
offer dedicated Web-hosting services. Examples of HSP companies include
Verio, Hostway, Interland, and InetU.
Storage Service Providers
Storage service providers (SSPs) offer data storage and management services
to customers. The customer is charged based on storage size (in megabytes
or terabytes) required for the data. SSPs also provide enhanced services
such as backups and data replication. Examples of SSPs include 1Disk,
Conxion, EMC, ManagedStorage International, and LiveVault.
Wireless Service Providers and Wireless Internet Service Providers
Wireless service providers (WSPs) and wireless Internet service providers
(WISPs) offer ﬁxed wireless broadband and mobile Internet connectivity
to customers. They can offer broadband connections to their customers
directly as opposed to doing so via ILECs or CLECs. This capability is due
to the nature of wireless technology itself. IP does play a role in wireless
networks. Wireless IP, also known as cellular digital packet data (CDPD), is a
standard for providing data service over cellular voice networks at speeds
of up to 19.2 Kb/sec. For emerging third-generation wireless networks
(3G), the use of packet-oriented protocols such as IP are being reviewed
for packet data and data rate on demand. Examples of WSPs and WISPs
38
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

include Nextel Communications, Craig Wireless International, and
MKL.Net (RealEthernet wireless service).
Internet Service Providers
Internet service providers (ISPs) provide Internet access to their customers.
They purchase bandwidth from network service providers (NSPs) that have
direct connectivity to the Internet. ISPs sell this bandwidth in discrete
chunks ranging from dial-up modem access, ISDN, and DSL to private-line
speeds T1/E1 and T3/E3. ISPs in the United States are often segmented
into tiers: A tier-one ISP may have either its own national backbone or
over a million subscribers. A tier-two ISP may possess its own regional
backbone, providing national or state access to its customers, and may
have over 50,000 subscribers. Tier-three ISPs constitute the majority; they
have less than 50,000 subscribers and offer only local services. Some ex-
amples of tier-one ISPs are America Online (AOL), EarthLink, United On-
line, and Microsoft.
Network Service Providers
Network service providers (NSPs) are often referred to as backbone providers.
NSPs sell bandwidth and network connectivity to ISPs, ASPs, HSPs, and
MSPs. NSPs offer direct access to the Internet as well as to network access
points (NAPs) and metropolitan access exchanges (MAEs). Examples of NSPs
include Sprint, UUNET (Worldcom), Genuity, Level 3 Communications,
Qwest, Telia, and AT&T.
Other Service Providers
E-commerce service providers permit companies to sell products and ser-
vices over the Internet and to accept payments via online credit card
authorization. Amazon.com is an example of an e-commerce service
provider.
Content service providers (CSPs) offer data and information that is avail-
able via a Web server. An example is Streetmail.
Gaming service providers (GSPs) provide online gaming services. An ex-
ample is Sega Online.
Vertical service providers (VSPs) offer industry-speciﬁc application host-
ing to customers in a speciﬁc vertical market, such as health care, manu-
facturing, ﬁnancial service, or retailing. A VSP is a type of ASP that of-
fers customers the ability to use Internet technologies and applications
without the customer requiring know-how or resources. For example, a
retailer might contract with a VSP to conﬁgure and administer its on-
line shopping cart as well as its inventory and payment-processing
applications. The customer thus avoids hiring its own administrators
to do this service. Examples of VSPs include BlueStep for Web-based
3.1 Deﬁnition of Greenﬁeld
39

collaboration and content publishing services; Dorado.com, which fo-
cuses on the mortgage industry; Invesmart for Internet-based retirement
ﬁnancial services; and Novopoint, which provides virtual exchange for
food ingredients like sugar, baking products, and so on.
3.1.4
Putting the Alphabet Soup Together
The common characteristic of these various service provider environ-
ments is an emphasis on service and service delivery via IP-based technol-
ogy. The service can be Web hosting, using an IP-based network to provide
data backup and archiving, or offering Internet access and services such as
email, domain names, or an e-commerce portal for the sale of goods. The
potential for being innovative and seizing the competitive edge is great
for Greenﬁeld service providers; examining this potential is the focus of
the following sections.
3.2 Business Aspects
In today’s business environment, developing and provisioning a service
requires that it generate revenue. This fact becomes even more apparent
in a high-tech industry. Good technology is insufﬁcient in itself to create a
successful company. In this section, we look at the business aspects for de-
veloping and provisioning IP-based services within a Greenﬁeld service
provider environment.
As the approaches for a marketing plan can vary between companies,
we highlight key factors associated with a marketing plan, such as cus-
tomer, vendor, service provider interaction, services, packaging, and pric-
ing examples. We also examine a general methodology in assessing the
requirement of IP-based services. Although there are variations for cost
justiﬁcation within companies, we classify some approaches to assessing
the ﬁscal impact of IP-based technology on a Greenﬁeld service provider’s
budget and offer examples of services and pricing. (Technical implemen-
tation scenarios are examined in Chapters 5 and 6.)
3.2.1
Marketing Plan
A marketing plan is important to every company’s success. A ﬁrst-rate IP-
based service is not in itself enough for a Greenﬁeld service provider un-
less it is marketed well. In fact, marketing can make or break a good ser-
vice. This section examines a marketing plan outline for a Greenﬁeld
service provider and assumes that a market study (research) has been
done for input to the market plan. The research conﬁrms the service
niche, answering the questions, Is there a need for the new service?, and
What company types and market segments will beneﬁt from this new
service?
40
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

A marketing plan consists of the following sections:
Plan summary
Situational review
Strategic opportunities and threats
Goals
Strategy
Budget
Controls
Each of these components is discussed a bit more in the following pages.
Plan Summary
The marketing plan commences with a summary. This part is usually writ-
ten last, since it summarizes the other sections. A well-written summary is
important, as it may be the only section read by external parties such as
bankers and venture capitalists when the company is requesting funding
support.
Situational Review
The situational review identiﬁes the competitive landscape and may con-
sist of other subsections such as the market, customer order process, and
competition.
●
Market subsection: Identiﬁes the overall market size for IP-based ser-
vices, as well as the characteristics and buying patterns of customers
for this type of service. Being speciﬁc about the quantity of busi-
nesses that exist under the target market, the amount of potential
buyers, and why these buyers would contract for this new IP-based
service are the focuses of this subsection.
●
Customer order process subsection: A high-level view of how customers
will contract for the service and interact with the Greenﬁeld service
provider. Will the customers use a Web interface for ordering the ser-
vice? Fault reporting, billing, and service-level reporting may be ad-
dressed in this subsection.
●
Competition subsection: Identiﬁes competitors and states why the new
IP-based service is different. Speciﬁes how much of the market the
Greenﬁeld service provider intends to capture, either as a percentage
of the target market or the number of customers.
Strategic Opportunities and Threats
This section is what is commonly termed in marketing language as SWOT,
or strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The Greenﬁeld service
3.2 Business Aspects
41

provider analyzes the competition and its own IP-based service offering
in depth. Performing a SWOT analysis is the output for this section. Such
an analysis identiﬁes a point-counterpoint description of strengths and
weaknesses, and the results are integrated into this section. An example is
offering an IP-based service with differentiation for voice and data, for an
additional cost. It is a value-added service to a basic IP-VPN for data only.
The additional revenue is a strength for the Greenﬁeld service provider.
The weakness in the positioning may be that other providers offering free
or cheap service may be able to counter with a lower price.
Goals
Marketing goals identify the number of expected customers, market share,
and gross proﬁt. Other goals may be new IP-based service awareness and
brand awareness. An example of market goals may be as follows:
1. Greenﬁeld service provider’s basic IP-VPN service price at 56 Kb/sec per
month/per site is $200; the company’s goal is $250,000 gross proﬁt in
planning year one.
2. Capture 5% of the target market or 10,000 customers during planning
year one.
3. Generate sales revenue of $1 million in year one and a monthly recur-
ring revenue stream of $200,000 per month by the end of year one.
4. Conduct a wide-scale advertising program to build new IP-VPN service
awareness and to gain additional customers.
5. Expand sales channel potential by 5% monthly.
6. Increase average ticket size to $200 per IP-VPN site by incrementally
selling value-added services such as voice, videoconferencing, and
higher-speed connections.
Strategy
The marketing strategy is the most detailed section of the marketing plan
and determines the marketing budget. The marketing strategy may con-
sist of the following subsections: target market, positioning, product,
service, price, method to contract new customers, promotion, and
advertising.
●
Target market subsection: Describes the niche that the Greenﬁeld ser-
vice provider will be marketing to.
●
Positioning subsection: Describes how the Greenﬁeld service provider
will position the new IP-based service in the market, such as value-
added with quality of service and a premium price.
●
Product subsection: Describes the IP-based services that the provider
will sell. Examples are IP-VPN service, Web hosting, and e-commerce
portal management.
42
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

●
Service subsection: Describes how the Greenﬁeld service provider will
interact with the customers in terms of service levels.
●
Price subsection: Identiﬁes the pricing schedule for the new service.
The unit and frequency of billing is deﬁned under price (e.g., per ac-
count, per month).
●
Method to contract new customers subsection: Provides more details to
the situational review in terms of signing up new customers. A dis-
cussion of the sales force and their role in signing up customers is
included.
●
Promotion subsection: Identiﬁes how the Greenﬁeld service provider
will promote its new IP-based service.
●
Advertising subsection: Describes where the Greenﬁeld service provider
will promote its new IP-based service and outlines the marketing
campaign.
Budget
The highlights of the spending plan are described in this section. A com-
plete marketing budget is inserted as an appendix to the marketing plan.
The metrics of the spending plan are discussed in the marketing budget
(e.g., spending as linked to percentage of sales).
Controls
This section describes methods to assure that execution of the marketing
budget is managed—for example, spending within the budget. An exam-
ple of a market control statement would be that the Greenﬁeld service
provider will monitor sales and performance on a monthly basis. The
monthly budget may be used as a tool for monitoring.
From the marketing plan, the Greenﬁeld service provider is ready to ex-
amine requirements, customers, and vendors more closely. The market-
ing plan provides the road map for these new IP-based services. The next
sections identify customer and vendor requirements and further high-
light a feedback loop between customers, Greenﬁeld service providers,
and vendors.
3.2.2
Customer Proﬁle and Requirements
What type of customer purchases services from a Greenﬁeld service pro-
vider? On a macro-level potential, Greenﬁeld service provider customers
can be from the small-to-medium enterprise sector. Large enterprises tend
to contract with established service providers, particularly incumbents.
Name recognition and the fact that large enterprises are most risk-averse
when it comes to trying out a new provider are examples of why large
companies lean toward incumbents for service.
3.2 Business Aspects
43

Greenﬁeld service provider customers are more open to an alternative
provider. Some of these customers do not have the know-how and/or re-
sources to manage services such as Web hosting, e-commerce portals, IP-
VPN, Internet access, and so on and look for opportunities to outsource
these tasks. Thus, an opportunity exists for Greenﬁeld service providers to
tap into this set of customers.
Greenﬁeld service provider customers require the following:
●
Service simplicity and transparency, meaning that if a service is man-
aged, the service should not be complex for the customer, and it
should be simple to order. Transparency applies to the service bill-
ing. The bill should be easy to understand.
●
End-to-end service ownership, meaning that the service provider owns
the SLA and its deliverables for the customer. Speciﬁcally, the ser-
vice provider avoids third-party dependencies for end-to-end service
ownership or, if such a dependency exists, this is transparent to the
customer. An example of such a dependency is subcontracting to an-
other service party for long-distance service.
●
Providing solutions that decrease total cost of ownership for the cus-
tomer. This factor affects the customer’s IT infrastructure purchase
decision for hardware and telecommunications system, as well as ad-
ministering the IT infrastructure. The service provider has an oppor-
tunity to target services and solutions that will aid in decreasing
such costs for the customer. Customers are often pressured to man-
age these cost structures within their own companies.
●
Secure and resilient services, meaning that services, whether IP-VPN or
server co-location, should not violate customer data integrity or ap-
plication availability.
●
Risk reduction of operational and catastrophic failures; this is a subset of
the previous point, in that the service should be available and opera-
tional failures should be transparent to the customer.
To summarize, an opportunity exists for a Greenﬁeld service provider
to develop and provision a service that will reduce customer costs, be easy
to use, improve resiliency, and enhance service availability. Before exam-
ining how IP-based technology can be used to address these customer re-
quirements, let us look at the vendor, or supplier, and its role within a
Greenﬁeld service provider environment.
3.2.3
Vendor Proﬁle and Requirements
The vendor, or supplier, proﬁle for Greenﬁeld service providers could be
either a new technology entrant or an established vendor for whom posi-
tioning emerging products and technology are key strategies. Greenﬁeld
service providers tend to be open to innovative solutions or new product
introductions, particularly those that are IP-based. This is due to the spe-
ciﬁc business focus of these providers, such as ASPs, ISPs, e-commerce
44
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

service providers, and so on, where the use of IP is a base for services and
provisioning. Some Greenﬁeld service providers construct and own their
own backbone infrastructures to deploy new services. These providers
tend to be open to evaluating new technology and products for installa-
tion in the backbone.
Vendors
for
Greenﬁeld
service
providers
must
understand
the
following:
●
Greenﬁeld service provider’s business model: This means that in order
for a vendor to position technology and products, the vendor needs
to know the business focus of the Greenﬁeld service provider. This
fact is certainly not limited to Greenﬁeld service providers. The ven-
dor focus for a Greenﬁeld service provider may differ from that of an
incumbent in that Greenﬁeld providers do not have the challenge of
dealing with existing infrastructures and business-engineering pro-
cesses to develop and deploy IP-based services (what is often termed
legacy).
●
The factors that affect life cycle management within a Greenﬁeld service
provider environment. This is required in order to drive hardware
purchase decisions because of the tactical buying behavior of the
Greenﬁeld service provider. The vendor needs to understand the
compelling aspects that drive IP-based service development and de-
ployment within these Greenﬁeld environments. This information
affects product development given the availability of technology re-
quired to deliver these products.
●
The business viability of the Greenﬁeld service provider, so as to assess
risk in product development for this provider. This point is related to
the ﬁrst bullet but with an emphasis on due diligence for product de-
velopment. How long will the Greenﬁeld service provider exist? Are
new products targeted only for Greenﬁeld service providers? These
questions impact the vendor’s business model. On the one hand,
Greenﬁeld service providers are apt to evaluate new products earlier
than incumbents, thus providing valuable feedback to product de-
velopment. On the other, the longevity of Greenﬁeld service provid-
ers affects strategic partnership decisions between vendors and these
providers. It is a sensitive balancing act for both parties.
Summarizing these points, the Greenﬁeld service provider is a potential
early adopter of emerging products and technology. The vendor needs to
understand the Greenﬁeld service provider’s business model in order to
assess both risk and opportunity for new product development.
3.2.4
Vendor Selection Process
Determining factors that impact the vendor selection process for
Greenﬁeld service providers is the next step toward IP-based service devel-
opment and deployment. What are the recommended strategies? Single

vendor? Multiple vendors? What are the pros and cons? A Greenﬁeld ser-
vice provider’s requirements of a vendor are similar to customer require-
ments: products and solutions that contribute to the provider’s business
and reduce cost; that reduce operational and catastrophic failures; and
that are secure and resilient. The Greenﬁeld service provider selects a ven-
dor strategy that deﬁnes the relationship between the provider and the
vendor.
After agreement on a vendor strategy, the Greenﬁeld service provider
launches a process called a request for information (RFI) to solicit informa-
tion from various suppliers about product availability, technology avail-
ability, future developments, business model, reference customers, and so
on. This process can run parallel to determining a vendor strategy. The
vendor strategy and RFI constitute the vendor selection process.
Vendor Strategy
Vendor strategy is characterized by the approach a provider will have to-
ward suppliers. This translates to adopting either a single-vendor or
a multiple-vendor strategy. A single-vendor strategy means that the
Greenﬁeld service provider works with only one vendor for its products
and solutions. The beneﬁt of this approach is a reduction in managing
multiple suppliers that can be complex if not handled carefully. Examples
of complexity include platform interoperability assurance and ﬁnger point-
ing among vendors when interoperability problems arise. Another beneﬁt
is that the supplier and service provider can develop a closer relationship
that contributes to both product and service development. A drawback to
the single-vendor strategy is the dependence upon only one supplier:
What is the longevity of the supplier? What happens if the supplier goes
out of business? Does the product implement a vendor-proprietary solu-
tion that prohibits platform interoperability should this become a require-
ment for the service provider? Another drawback can be product pricing:
Is the vendor offering competitive product pricing? Or is the vendor tak-
ing advantage of the single-vendor relationship to inﬂate their prices?
A multiple-vendor strategy means that the Greenﬁeld service provider
will work with more than one vendor for its products and solutions.
The beneﬁt of this approach is that the key risk associated with a single-
vendor strategy—business longevity—is minimized. A drawback might
be the complexity of working with multiple vendors to assure platform
interoperability. Another drawback might be that vendors are apprehen-
sive in sharing nondisclosure information because of the relationship the
Greenﬁeld service provider has with potential competition. This informa-
tion may impact the service provider’s business model as it addresses fu-
ture product development strategies and directions. What changes in the
network infrastructure or applications does the Greenﬁeld service pro-
vider need to consider, given the direction of product and technology
46
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

development? Table 3.1 summarizes the pros and cons of single-vendor
versus multiple-vendor strategies.
Once the Greenﬁeld service provider has decided on its vendor strategy,
the vendor selection process commences with an RFI. The RFI can provide
valuable information, as it is an indication of what is available in the sup-
plier market.
Request for Information (RFI)
The Greenﬁeld service provider indicates in its RFI the problem and ser-
vice opportunity it wishes to solve. Once it receives responses, it reviews
and prioritizes them. Factors that affect the prioritization may be whether
or not the supplier is a market leader, applicability of products to solutions
and services, customer references, network management solutions, tech-
nology and product maturity and availability, pricing, platform interoper-
ability, support of open standards, and so on. Vendor selection within a
Greenﬁeld service provider organization may be quicker than selecting
a vendor within an incumbent environment. This is due largely to the
legacy infrastructure factor that an incumbent must consider as part of
its vendor selection process. (Incumbent-related issues are discussed in
Chapter 4.)
To summarize the vendor selection process for Greenﬁeld service provid-
ers: Deciding on a vendor strategy is the ﬁrst step; launching an RFI is the
second step; evaluating and prioritizing the RFI results, and assuring that
there is a ﬁt in the service provider’s business model concludes the steps.
3.2.5
Feedback Loop
Identifying a feedback loop between customers, vendors, and Greenﬁeld
service providers is possible from the previous sections. The feedback loop
conﬁrms the key interactions that contribute to product and service

development. When taken altogether, customer requirements, vendor un-
derstanding, Greenﬁeld service provider goals, and the vendor selection
process are interfaces that affect the product’s life cycle, the technology
availability, and the Greenﬁeld service provider’s service life cycle. (These
interfaces have been highlighted in Chapter 2 in the context of service
creation.) Figure 3.1 depicts this feedback loop between customers, Green-
ﬁeld service providers, and vendors. Essentially, customers provide re-
quirements to the Greenﬁeld service provider that serve as the base for
product and service development. The service provider translates these re-
quirements into an RFI as part of the vendor selection process. Vendors re-
spond with appropriate products and solutions. Examining alternative
technologies to IP for service development is the next step for Greenﬁeld
service providers.
3.2.6
Alternative Technologies
How does a Greenﬁeld service provider offer services like Web hosting
without IP? How does it offer Internet access and Internet-based services
without IP? Or an e-commerce portal for selling books? Layer 2 technolo-
gies such as frame relay, DSL, ISDN, ATM, and leased lines are used to

provide access to the customer from a service provider. Quite a bit of exist-
ing services within Greenﬁeld service providers in fact are based on IP.
If the Greenﬁeld service provider is building its backbone infrastruc-
ture, the same questions apply. Convergence of voice and data into a
packet-based backbone as in an IP-based infrastructure is a reality. Green-
ﬁeld service providers who intend to build a backbone do not have the
complex issues associated with multiple networks and services that in-
cumbents have.
These issues impact provisioning. For service automation, what is the
alternative to IP-based technology? How can a customer service order, im-
plementation, billing, and reporting be done without IP-based technol-
ogy? IP-based technology is pivotal to service automation, as discussed in
Chapter 6.
If Greenﬁeld service providers are deploying IP-based services today,
then what is the value-added proposition to continue to do so? The ques-
tion hits at the heart of a Greenﬁeld service provider’s existence. The
fact that most such providers are deploying IP-based services highlights
the market requirements for these services. The real challenge for a Green-
ﬁeld service provider is avoiding the commoditization of IP-based ser-
vices. This theme is explored further toward the end of the chapter.
3.3 Service Creation Model
Greenﬁeld service providers can use IP to create services such as corporate
VPN, Internet access, Web hosting, e-commerce portals, and so on. Cre-
ating value-added enhancements like voice-over-IP or videoconferencing
on top of a corporate IP-VPN are key examples of implementing IP for
service creation. The Greenﬁeld service provider can develop an IP-based
service package like standard IP-VPN with Internet access, adding Web
hosting, voice-over-IP, and videoconferencing to extend the service value
proposition to customers.
3.4 Service Examples
The discussion’s emphasis has been on generic processes such as deﬁning
customer requirements, vendor understanding, and the vendor selection
process. Using IP-based technology to develop and enhance services and
to be and remain competitive is explored in the rest of the chapter. What
are IP-based service examples for a Greenﬁeld service provider? In the con-
text of the customer requirements identiﬁed earlier, this section gives a
few IP-based service examples, such as managed IP-VPN, Web hosting,
and an e-commerce portal. This section explores a bit more deeply how
3.4 Service Examples
49

these examples satisfy customer requirements and examines the impacts
of these services on a Greenﬁeld service provider, such as revenue creation
and up-sell potential.
3.4.1
Managed Remote-Access IP-VPN
Cost is a factor affecting the decision of a customer to contract for a VPN
service that is IP-based. Customer scenarios include telecommuting and
migrating from a frame relay service to an IP-based VPN service. This sec-
tion looks at a telecommuting example, while the migration from frame
relay to IP-VPN is explored in Chapter 4. This example is for a managed
service for which the Greenﬁeld service provider manages the customer’s
infrastructure and routing. In an unmanaged service, the customer man-
ages its own infrastructure and routing. The unmanaged service is focused
on bandwidth and bandwidth availability.
For those customers who operate their own private remote-access ser-
vice, the initial investment is in the remote-access infrastructure such as a
modem pool or network access server (NAS). Telecommuting is a main driver
for a company to offer remote access to its employees. Employees are
working either from home or from a hotel if traveling on business. Com-
panies experience an increase in recurring long-distance toll charges as
the amount of telecommuters increases. To monitor these charges, com-
panies in the United States use a toll-free number. The problem is that
these calls are, in fact, not toll-free. The charges are transferred from the
telecommuter to the telecommuter’s company. Adding other cost factors,
such as remote-access infrastructure maintenance, depreciation, and sup-
port personnel, to the overall cost of managing this service privately, the
recurring cost of administering the service may not be so attractive for a
company.
An alternative is to replace the private service with a managed IP-VPN
service that is secure, available, and cost-effective. Determining what is at-
tractive also requires that the customer provide information such as how
long it will take for the customer to recover costs and the time frame
for a return on investment. These numbers vary and may depend on
such factors as current amount of telecommuters, projected amount of
telecommuters, number of simultaneous telecommuters online, company
network topology and bandwidth usage, call hours by type (e.g., local/
domestic, etc.) over a period of a month and per telecommuter, and ﬁnally
a description of the customer remote-access network infrastructure.
In determining whether or not a managed remote-access IP-VPN ser-
vice is an attractive alternative to the customer’s private remote-access
service, a Greenﬁeld service provider may determine a basic return-on-
investment comparison. An example is a company with 500 employees.
Three hundred of these employees work from home (for a mix of local
and toll calls), 30 hours per month per employee. Two hundred of these
50
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

employees require access when traveling (use of a toll-free number and in-
ternational calls averaging 25 cents/minute), 10 hours per month per em-
ployee. There are ﬁve branches connected via frame relay to corporate
headquarters. Each branch administers its own modem pool. The com-
pany is considering a managed IP-VPN service available in all ﬁve sites in
preparation for a site-to-site VPN. DSL will be used as the access transport
from these sites to the Greenﬁeld service provider’s location.
The company has been paying approximately $65,388 per month to
operate its private remote-access network. A managed remote-access IP-
VPN service (basic no-service differentiation) may be priced at $50 per
month per employee, or $25,000 per month, representing a savings of
$30,388 per month, or approximately 47%. An initial investment of
$45,000 can be recovered in three months. This new service builds the
foundation for a future site-to-site, managed IP-VPN service that extends
beyond remote access. Table 3.2 summarizes the comparison between a
managed IP-VPN service (remote access) and a privately administered cor-
porate service.
This is an example of the type of interaction between a Greenﬁeld
service provider and its customer. There are other variables that impact
the return-on-investment calculation, such as the monthly charge for
the managed remote-access IP-VPN service. The example shows that the
monthly telecommunication costs dominate the monthly remote-access
costs for a customer. These costs can be attributed to the margin that ex-
ists between the managed IP-VPN access charges and the premium that
can be assessed for managed IP-VPN services. The private remote-access
support represents a signiﬁcant recurring charge for the customer. The op-
portunity for a Greenﬁeld service provider to offer a managed service is
great. Even more attractive for both the customer and the provider are the
beneﬁts from a managed IP-based service.
In the context of customer requirements, cost reduction is certainly
possible with a managed IP-based service, as demonstrated in the return-
on-investment example. For the Greenﬁeld service provider, this repre-
sents a new revenue creation opportunity. The security requirement can
be met via the implementation of a ﬁrewall and other similar devices by
the Greenﬁeld service provider. Understanding recurring costs of the cus-
tomer is key to demonstrating the ﬁnancial viability of a managed IP-VPN
service within the customer environment.
3.4.2
Web Hosting
Web hosting is another example of an IP-based service. This section looks
at a speciﬁc implementation of this service, called dedicated Web hosting. A
Greenﬁeld service provider offers customers a dedicated server or multiple
servers, depending on the customer requirements, as well as dedicated
bandwidth. The provider also offers performance guarantees. The service
3.4 Service Examples
51

target is small to medium enterprises that lack a staff to manage their serv-
ers. A managed Web-hosting service can address those customers who
do not have the resources, speciﬁcally in-house know-how to administer
and manage servers. Bandwidth, space, customer service, reliability, up-
grade options, speed, and price all impact a customer’s decision to select a
Greenﬁeld service provider that offers such a service.
●
Bandwidth: The customer needs to consider the type of connection
the Greenﬁeld service provider has to the backbone, such as T1/E1,
T3/E3, and so on. If a Greenﬁeld service provider offers a T1 connec-
tion to the Internet, this means that it can only permit 1.544 Mb/
sec. This bandwidth is dedicated to the customer in this example.

Bandwidth is derived from the amount of disk space required to ad-
minister a customer server (e.g., 100 MB).
●
Determining space: The customer knows what kind of server it re-
quires for the amount of disk space and the amount of ﬁles to
maintain.
●
Customer service: The type of support available to the customer, such
as 24/7 coverage reachable by phone, email, and fax.
●
Reliability: This can be provided by server backup options in case of
failure. The Greenﬁeld service provider also provides a report dis-
playing server uptime.
●
Upgrade options: If a customer environment is growing, a Greenﬁeld
service provider may offer upgrade options to accommodate this
growth.
●
Speed: This is associated with the server. Customers want to ensure
that data access is not slow. Bandwidth does impact data access, but
if the server speed is slow, the customer will experience slow re-
sponse times when surﬁng for information. Testing the site permits
customers to conﬁrm service performance.
●
Price: Pricing for managed Web-hosting services that are dedicated
can vary. Variables include bandwidth, server infrastructure, and the
SLA package. Greenﬁeld service providers that are new in offering
this service tend to price low so as to build up their customer base.
Thus, a lower price does not necessarily mean that the service is sub-
standard. Conversely, a higher price may reﬂect service add-ons such
as VPN management or email.
A Greenﬁeld service provider interested in offering managed Web host-
ing requires the resources to do so. These resources are people and the in-
frastructure. There are host service providers (HSPs) whose main business
focus is Web hosting as a service. It is also possible for a Greenﬁeld service
provider such as an ISP to offer Web hosting as a value-added service.
There are customers requiring such services, and in the context of cost re-
duction within a customer IT infrastructure, Web hosting is a revenue-
generating opportunity for Greenﬁeld service providers.
3.4.3
E-commerce Portal
E-commerce by deﬁnition is selling or buying something electronically.
This relationship can be between businesses, commonly called business-to-
business (B2B), or between a business and a consumer, referred to as
business-to-consumer (B2C). In B2B, the relationship is among vendors, dis-
tributors, and other businesses. These groups are further segmented into
verticals and horizontals. Verticals are B2B sites that are focused on a spe-
ciﬁc industry, such as retail. Horizontals are sites that provide products,
3.4 Service Examples
53

goods, and materials that are not dedicated to a particular industry. Re-
tailers are typically B2C companies.
The Greenﬁeld service provider has an opportunity to offer a managed
e-commerce portal service. The target customer could be from a small to
medium enterprise that has accepted the potential for doing business over
the Internet but lacks both the know-how and infrastructure to do so. In
a managed Web service, the scope is often limited to such features as
quantity of email accounts, ﬁle transfers, and so on. Providing a managed
e-commerce portal service means offering an online store or commerce-
enabled Web site where goods and services are described and can be se-
lected by the customer (the enterprise company’s customer).
The Greenﬁeld service provider offers an electronic payment capability,
which means the online processing of credit cards. This may require an
agreement between the service provider and the enterprise customer re-
leasing the provider from liability due to credit card fraud. The portal in-
cludes an electronic order and shipment tracking feature. The enterprise
customer is able to track orders and shipment of goods to its own custom-
ers. Customer service is perhaps a call center managed by either the enter-
prise customer or a third party.
For its managed service, the Greenﬁeld service provider offers service
guarantees, such as portal availability and server performance, to the en-
terprise customer. These guarantees are translated into an SLA. This ser-
vice is similar to Web hosting, with the exception that it is focused on e-
commerce portal management. The same options available for managed
Web hosting, like a shared, dedicated, and co-located server, are also avail-
able for e-commerce portal management.
An opportunity exists for a Greenﬁeld service provider to offer this IP-
based service to customers requiring a managed e-commerce portal ser-
vice. It can be an enhancement to an existing, managed Web-hosting
service and can help the customer reduce overall costs by lowering or
avoiding IT infrastructure costs and in-house support costs.
3.5 Service Packaging and Pricing
The IP-based service examples of managed remote IP-VPN, managed dedi-
cated Web hosting, and managed e-commerce portals have the potential
to generate new revenue for Greenﬁeld service providers. More important
is that these services also provide solutions for customers in terms of cost
reduction of IT infrastructure. Applying return on investment to compare
the potential between the new IP-based services and a customer’s private
implementation is a step toward calculating the beneﬁt of such services
for the customer. Service pricing and packaging is another step for the
Greenﬁeld service provider. The following examples apply to the services
that have been presented in this chapter and serve to guide the Greenﬁeld
54
Chapter 3: Greenﬁeld Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

service provider in pricing and packaging. As these are managed services,
the service packages can be bundled. (Service pricing and packaging are
part of the marketing plan.)
3.5.1
Managed Remote-Access IP-VPN
A base, managed remote-access IP-VPN service considers factors such as
bandwidth access, customer equipment, and service level for pricing. One
approach is to deﬁne a base IP-VPN remote-access service and offer value-
added enhancements on top of it. The value-added enhancements result
in a premium service classiﬁcation, for an increase in pricing. An exam-
ple is to offer an “always on” access via DSL to a customer’s VPN and in-
clude Internet access. The DSL access provides downstream speeds for up
to 1.5 Mb/sec and upstream speeds of up to 128 Kb/sec. This access is
connected to the customer’s home, as the customer is a corporate tele-
commuter. The customer receives an IP address, 15 MB of personal Web
space, 10 email accounts, 25 hours of dial-up access per month when trav-
eling, and 24/7 customer support. The Greenﬁeld service provider also
provides the equipment for the customer’s premises. The pricing for DSL
and managed CPE may be approximately $50 per month. Add $15 for the
25 hours of dial-up access for a total of $75 per month per user at a cus-
tomer enterprise.
A service enhancement such as videoconferencing may be added to
this base remote-access IP-VPN service. A Greenﬁeld service provider hosts
videoconferencing facilities on its premises and offers the software to the
customer. The service is available via a Web interface. The customer’s per-
sonal computer is equipped with a camera, and the customer can then set
up and manage a videoconference with a Web-based management tool
on demand and as long as it wants. With this enhancement, the Green-
ﬁeld service provider can upgrade bandwidth to customer locations for
customers subscribing to this service. The provider offers the service at
a ﬁxed fee of $400 per customer site with unlimited users at that loca-
tion. IP-based videoconferencing can help the customer manage the costs
associated with travel. With it, meetings and training can be conducted
remotely.
The Greenﬁeld service provider can offer managed remote-access IP-
VPN and IP-based videoconferencing as bundled services. Bundled op-
tions may have discounts based on quantity of customers, customer loca-
tions, bandwidth, service levels, and contract duration. A customer may
ask the Greenﬁeld service provider about the availability of bundled op-
tions. Table 3.3 depicts the pricing for the managed remote-access IP-VPN
service and the IP-based videoconference enhancement.
The managed remote-access IP-VPN service and IP-based videocon-
ferencing enhancement provide solutions to the customer that reduces
IT infrastructure and support costs and creates efﬁciency in the work

55

environment. With an innovative IP-VPN service enhancement such as
IP-based videoconferencing, customers can improve contact with tele-
commuters, provide e-learning, hold project meetings and design reviews,
and so on. The beneﬁts for a Greenﬁeld service provider are the creation of
service relationships that foster the development of value-added services
and, of course, the creation of revenue.
3.5.2
Managed Dedicated Web Hosting
Server capacity, server speed, and bandwidth requirements are key com-
ponents to pricing for a managed, dedicated Web-hosting service. A
Greenﬁeld service provider may offer a customer the option of dedicated
bandwidth or paying per gigabyte of data transfer, to include the ability
to burst to additional bandwidth. A basic server package may include a
server with 64 megabytes of memory, hard drive with 8.4 GB of capacity,
LAN connection card for Ethernet or fast Ethernet (10/100 network inter-
face card), ﬂoppy drive, speciﬁed bandwidth option, and an operating sys-
tem that supports Web server, ﬁle transfer, email, and domain name server
capabilities. The service can include options for additional services, such
as daily backups and installation of customer-provided software. Other
options available to the customer may be more memory, faster central
processing unit (CPU), and tape drive.
The pricing for the basic dedicated server package includes a one-time
setup fee and a monthly fee. The price will vary according to the dedicated
bandwidth required by the customer. For example, at 56 Kb/sec, the setup
fee may be $300 and the monthly charge $100. The customer avoids pur-
chasing the infrastructure and having to hire dedicated personnel to man-
age the server, so the price is therefore attractive. Table 3.4 depicts an ex-
ample of managed, dedicated Web-hosting pricing and packaging for a
basic offering. This pricing is for dedicated bandwidth and includes 24/7
customer care.

An attraction for customers is that premium service including addi-
tional bandwidth can be offered with step pricing. This means paying in-
crementally for more value-added service options. The Greenﬁeld service
provider beneﬁts from this approach, since it can offer more service en-
hancements and thus gain revenue. The key for the service provider is
packaging the service. What is the basic package for a managed, dedicated
Web-hosting service? What is the premium package? What are the op-
tions? What is the time frame to provision these services and options?
3.5.3
Managed E-commerce Portal
Managed e-commerce portal service may vary depending on whether or
not the customer has limited products, multiple products, or unlimited
products to sell electronically. These factors impact server capacity re-
quirements. The amount of trafﬁc that the customer requires for the e-
commerce portal also affects the service pricing. For a managed online
store or a commerce-enabled Web site that is administered by a Greenﬁeld
service provider, the service can be packaged to reﬂect the number of
products—for example, standard, premium, and premium-plus.
All services may include database software, security software, online
credit card billing and ordering software, online reporting, one static IP
address, multimedia application support, Web control panel with individ-
ual customer password, and so on. The Greenﬁeld service provider may
offer 24/7 customer care, service-level guarantees for portal availability,

throughput (pages come up quickly), and daily backups. For customers
with limited products or who wish to offer a pay-as-you-view service, the
standard service would be appropriate.
An example of a standard package is to offer 750 MB of Web space, up
to 10 GB of Web trafﬁc, 50 email accounts, server choice, secure area for
payments, and back ofﬁce support. The customer pays a one-time setup
fee of $50, then $35 per month. Table 3.5 depicts examples of packag-
ing for standard, premium, and premium-plus services for managed e-
commerce portals.
Greenﬁeld service providers can offer a managed e-commerce portal
service as part of their IP-based service portfolio. This service is an exten-
sion of the managed Web-hosting service. For customers needing to use
the Internet for selling and buying goods and lacking the IT infrastructure
to do so, managed e-commerce portal service provides a solution. The cus-
tomer can focus on its core business and use the Internet to extend its
business reach beyond geographic borders. Greenﬁeld service providers
need to measure the value of this service to its customers. Are customers
generating revenue by using this service? What is the value of this service
to the customer’s business? Answers to such questions serve as input to
help develop additional value-added services based on IP.
3.6 What Are the Challenges?
The key challenge for a Greenﬁeld service provider is service differentia-
tion. Speciﬁcally, Greenﬁeld service providers need to work with custom-
ers and vendors to develop value-added services based on IP. This means
looking at opportunities to enhance offerings such as IP-VPN by adding
voice-over-IP, videoconferencing, and so on. A Greenﬁeld service provider
that focuses a business on a speciﬁc niche such as Web hosting may face

challenges as this market becomes saturated with other HSPs. This applies
to any service provider. Commoditization of IP-based services is another
challenge to a Greenﬁeld service provider; it means that service differenti-
ation no longer exists due to the saturation of other service providers in
the market. Then the only differentiation is price.
To counter these challenges, Greenﬁeld service providers can empha-
size value-added IP-based services. The value proposition for the customer,
such as reducing total cost of infrastructure ownership or enhancing cus-
tomer revenue, is critical to the success of service providers. IP-based ser-
vices and enhancements that address customer requirements are key to
revenue generation for Greenﬁeld service providers.
3.7 Who Is the Competition?
Incumbents are the main competitors of Greenﬁeld service providers.
They have existing resources like backbone ownership, IT infrastructure,
and personnel. Some Greenﬁeld service providers do not own their back-
bone and are required to lease services from incumbents. This factor can
impact end-to-end SLA ownership for a Greenﬁeld service provider cus-
tomer, since the service level depends on a third party.
Other Greenﬁeld service providers are also competitors. ISPs offer Web-
hosting services and are in competition with HSPs. Conversely, HSPs may
offer Internet access and so be in competition with ISPs. There is not a lack
of competition. The key, however, is being and remaining competitive in
terms of IP-based technology.
3.8 Being Competitive in Terms of IP-Based
Technology
Provisioning is the key to being competitive in terms of IP-based technol-
ogy. Greenﬁeld service providers may offer a plethora of IP-based services
and enhancements, but without IP-based provisioning, their competitive
edge is lost. Think about the impact of a Greenﬁeld service provider
that commits to a service being provisioned within 15 minutes or the
customer receives a credit. IP-based service provisioning affects the cus-
tomer’s business. A customer that must wait for a service to be provisioned
may be incurring costs that this service is to replace. To seize and maintain
a competitive edge with IP-based technology, Greenﬁeld service providers
can offer both value-added services and a value proposition by automat-
ing provisioning. Manual provisioning incurs both errors and delays, thus
resulting in customer frustration. IP-based technology is pivotal to the
success of both the customer and the Greenﬁeld service provider.
3.8 Being Competitive in Terms of IP-Based Technology
59

3.9 Chapter Review
Greenﬁeld service providers are certainly in the business of offering IP-
based services, whether a managed remote-access IP-VPN, managed Web
hosting, or a managed e-commerce portal. Success factors include a good
marketing plan, a focus on addressing customer requirements, and using
IP to create services as well as automate provisioning. These factors all
contribute to being competitive for Greenﬁeld service providers. The role
IP plays for incumbents is the subject of the next chapter.

Incumbent Service
Providers: Opportunities
and Challenges
Incumbents have traditionally earned revenue in transporting bits from
one location to another. Transporting bits as in voice has become a com-
modity; long-distance voice revenues have been declining in the U.S.
market since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In order to compen-
sate for this revenue loss, incumbents need to offer value-added services
such as corporate virtual private network access with videoconferencing,
Internet access, integrated local and long-distance voice, Web hosting,
and e-commerce.
Unlike the Greenﬁeld service providers, incumbents are confronted
with legacy infrastructures that reﬂect separate networks and services.
They have constructed separate networks that correspond to a speciﬁc ser-
vice, such as a public-switched telephone network (PSTN) for voice, private
leased lines, and frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) for
data services. Each network possesses a management, provisioning, billing,
and reporting system that consists of separate operations support systems
(OSSs), often managed by different organizations in the company. The
challenge for the incumbent is to converge a network like PSTN, based on
time-division multiplexing (TDM) circuit switching, with a packet-switched
network based on IP. (TDM is discussed in Chapter 5.) This chapter
61

identiﬁes the issues associated with a legacy infrastructure and explores
the reasons for an incumbent to develop and deploy IP-based services, the
most important of which is to be competitive and proﬁtable.
4.1 Deﬁnition of Incumbent
Incumbents consist of incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), former
Bell operating companies often referred to as the Baby Bells; traditional
American interexchange carriers (IXCs), and post, telephone, and tele-
graph companies (PTTs). PTTs are government-operated communications
companies in other countries. Incumbents have a monopoly in the tele-
communications market due to years of existence—for example, ILECs in
the United States control an estimated 90% of the access lines. This is sig-
niﬁcant, since the owner of the access lines generally rules the telecom-
munications industry: these access lines compose what is termed the last
mile, or local loop, and are used to connect to the end customer, thus repre-
senting the greatest revenue source for the service provider. The nearer to
the customer, the more complex and diverse the network becomes, since
service intelligence like billing and reporting functions is often located at
the service provider network edge, and the network edge supports multi-
ple access technologies, such as leased lines, DSL, frame relay, and ATM.
4.2 Business Aspects
For an incumbent, developing and deploying IP-based services have busi-
ness aspects, such as creating a marketing plan that, among other things,
identiﬁes the services to be developed and the packaging and pricing of
those services. This section identiﬁes the business aspects as they apply
speciﬁcally to an incumbent environment—for example, unlike a Green-
ﬁeld service provider, an incumbent may develop a marketing plan that
focuses on entering a market dominated by Greenﬁeld service providers
(such as Internet access). Incumbents have the advantage of name recog-
nition over Greenﬁeld service providers, as they have been in the telecom-
munications market for years; as a result of this name recognition, large
enterprises typically are customers of incumbents.
4.2.1
Marketing Plan
In developing and deploying IP-based services, an incumbent’s marketing
plan focuses on defending local and long-distance voice services as tradi-
tional revenue sources, while capturing additional revenues from new IP-
based services such as corporate IP-VPN, videoconferencing, voice-over-IP,
Web hosting, and e-commerce. For new IP-based services, the focus of the
62
Chapter 4: Incumbent Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

plan is to attack the competitive landscape dominated by Greenﬁeld ser-
vice providers and to project a new image of being innovative. This image
is important because incumbents have been traditionally perceived by
customers as slow to develop new services.
Marketing Goals
Examples of marketing goals that an incumbent can develop for basic IP-
VPN service with Internet access are as follows:
1. Market basic IP-VPN with Internet access at 256 Kb/sec for a service
price of $400 per month per site. The company’s goal in planning year
one is $450,000 gross proﬁt.
2. Capture 10% of the target market or 20,000 customers during planning
year one.
3. Generate sales revenue of $2 million in year one and a monthly recur-
ring revenue stream of $350,000 per month by the end of year one.
4. Conduct a wide-scale advertising program to build new converged IP-
VPN and Internet-access service awareness and to gain additional
customers.
5. Expand sales channel potential by 10% monthly.
6. Increase average ticket size to $350 per IP-VPN site by up-selling value-
added services such as voice, videoconferencing, and higher-speed
connections.
7. Defend against competitive encroachment of traditional local and
long-distance services by integrating the services into value-added
bundles like basic corporate IP-VPN and Internet access with local and
long-distance voice services.
Marketing Strategy
An example of an incumbent’s marketing strategy is to target both large
enterprises and small to medium enterprises as customers for the new IP-
based services. The name recognition of an incumbent facilitates the in-
troduction of these new services to large enterprises, which tend to con-
tract with incumbents because of risks associated with Greenﬁeld service
providers (e.g., lack of business longevity, and unproven performance).
However, for an incumbent to attack the competitive landscape of
Greenﬁeld service providers, it needs to set itself apart from those provid-
ers. Rather than a me-too strategy, incumbents can capitalize on innova-
tive image positioning and their own business longevity. This differentia-
tion can result in a value-added proposition for customers translating to
services that will address their requirements for cost reduction, offered by
service providers who have been (and may be) around longer than the al-
ternative providers. For service positioning, an incumbent can emphasize
geographic reach, as incumbents tend to own their own (often national)
4.2 Business Aspects
63

backbones. Finally, for pricing, an incumbent can stress that the new IP-
based services are value-added, not basic voice and data transport. To
summarize, a marketing plan for an incumbent service provider needs to
highlight such factors as innovative image, business longevity, geographic
reach, and the value-added proposition.
4.2.2
Customer Proﬁle and Requirements
Large enterprises tend to be existing customers of incumbents, because al-
ternative providers are rather new in the telecommunications market and
because incumbents focus on large enterprises for the substantial reve-
nue opportunities. Small to medium enterprises are also customers of
incumbents, but are typically more open to considering an alternative ser-
vice provider. For incumbents, penetrating the small-to-medium enter-
prise customer segment with new IP-based services is an opportunity to
attack Greenﬁeld service providers. One incumbent marketing strategy is
to erode the Greenﬁeld service provider’s traditional services, such as
Internet access, Web hosting, e-commerce, and so on.
An incumbent’s customer requirements are as follows:
●
Value-added services like corporate IP-VPN with voice, videoconfer-
encing, and Internet access, meaning that the incumbent does not
just provide transport for voice and data. These services should all be
secure and reliable.
●
Wide geographic reach for these value-added services is required by
large enterprises.
●
Value-added services should reduce customer IT infrastructure costs
and result in proﬁtability for the customer.
●
Customers require ﬂexible pricing and packaging for these value-
added services (e.g., bundled services).
To summarize, an incumbent has an opportunity to develop IP-based
services that extend geographically and positively impact a customer’s
business. Exploring the vendor proﬁle and requirements within an in-
cumbent environment is discussed in the next section.
4.2.3
Vendor Proﬁle and Selection
An incumbent’s vendor proﬁle emphasis is on being an established rather
than a new technology supplier. Incumbents have multiple networks and
services that have evolved over a period of many years, and as a result of
the existence of these multiple networks, changing vendors can be prob-
lematic from a network infrastructure support viewpoint.
Vendors for incumbent service providers need to understand the
following:
64
Chapter 4: Incumbent Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

●
The incumbent service provider’s business model and the impacts of
legacy infrastructure and multiple business engineering on the ser-
vice provider’s business. A vendor can provide products and solu-
tions that may move the various networks to a converged platform
to deploy multiple services.
●
The IP-based service portfolio that the incumbent intends to de-
velop and deploy so as to position the necessary products required
for these new services.
Incumbents, due to their history, tend to have a multiple-vendor strat-
egy and rely on requests for information (RFIs) to obtain information
about vendors’ product availability, technology availability, future devel-
opment, customer references, and so on in order to select vendors to pro-
vide products and solutions for a new service. Incumbents emphasize the
requirement for platform interoperability because of their multiple net-
works. One approach for an incumbent is to insist that vendors provide
platforms that are open and nonproprietary.
To summarize these points, a vendor for an incumbent needs to pro-
vide products and solutions that both address legacy infrastructure issues
and facilitate the introduction of IP-based services. (Legacy infrastructure
issues are discussed later in this chapter.)
4.2.4
Alternative Technologies
The existence of multiple networks in an incumbent service provider’s
environment prompts a question as to alternatives to IP-based technol-
ogy. The circuit-switched voice network is TDM-based, and incumbents
have transported data over Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks like leased lines,
DSL, frame relay, and ATM. The alternative for an incumbent is to con-
tinue to provide multiple services over multiple networks. However, as
we will see later, this is expensive for the service provider. Incumbents
require a solution that reduces the operation expenses associated with
maintaining multiple networks: IP-based technology can be used to con-
solidate multiple services to a single platform and develop value-added
services.
4.3 Service Creation Model
Incumbent service providers can develop and deploy IP-based services,
such as a corporate IP-VPN with Internet access and Web hosting, and cre-
ate value-added enhancements to those services, such as voice-over-IP
and videoconferencing. Additionally, incumbent service providers can
bundle integrated local and long-distance voice into the IP-based service
offerings. Capitalizing on bandwidth increases due to value-added ser-
vices such as videoconferencing or Web hosting provides another revenue
4.3 Service Creation Model
65

opportunity for incumbents, since they can charge more for the
bandwidth.
4.4 Service Examples
Two value-added service examples—IP-VPN and managed Web hosting—
are discussed in this section to demonstrate the impact of IP-based ser-
vices on both the customer and the incumbent. The managed IP-VPN ser-
vice is an alternative to traditional access offerings such as remote access,
frame relay, and leased lines. Offering differentiated services such as Inter-
net access and voice will be the focus of the ﬁrst service example. (The cost
savings opportunity for a remote-access service is already pointed out in
Chapter 3.) A managed Web-hosting service opportunity for an incum-
bent serving small to medium enterprises is the focus of the second exam-
ple. (Chapter 8 offers detailed scenarios for the development of these
services.)
4.4.1
Managed IP-VPN
An IP-VPN service can be managed or unmanaged. In an unmanaged IP-
VPN service, the customer manages its on-site equipment or router that
connects to the service provider network and is responsible for the Layer 3
routing between locations. The service provider essentially offers band-
width to the customer. This type of customer possesses the technical
know-how to manage the network infrastructure.
In a managed IP-VPN service, the network infrastructure that connects
the customer network to the service provider network is administered by
the service provider (i.e., the customer outsources this responsibility to
the service provider). The customer may lack either the know-how or the
needs to manage the network and may have pressure to reduce IT infra-
structure costs. In the following example, the incumbent offers a man-
aged IP-VPN service to a large enterprise that is national and has points of
presence throughout the country; there is a requirement for any-to-any
connectivity between all of the customer’s locations.
The alternative to a managed IP-VPN service is to use frame relay to
transfer customer data between sites. For any-to-any connectivity, a frame
relay implementation can be expensive for the customer (this is high-
lighted in Chapter 8). For customers that have a hub-and-spoke topol-
ogy—that is, connectivity between a central location and remote lo-
cations—frame relay may be an alternative. The value-added proposition
for an incumbent service provider is to offer an IP-VPN service that sup-
ports differentiated services such as Internet access, voice, and videocon-
ferencing. The customer typically needs to order four access lines to sup-
port each of these services, one line for corporate VPN, a second line for
66
Chapter 4: Incumbent Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

Internet access, a third for voice, and a fourth for videoconferencing.
Rather than four different links for these services, an incumbent service
provider can offer a single access line that supports them. The incumbent
can position this service as a ubiquitous IP plug. (The term ubiquitous
has been used in the telecommunications industry to describe the univer-
sal presence of the telephone network.) This value-added service can po-
tentially result in cost savings for the customer. Figure 4.1 depicts this
example.
An example of potential savings is as follows. Assume that the four ser-
vices below are deployed using four access lines that cost the customer ap-
proximately $3200 per month:
8 voice channels (512 with pulse code modulation)
512K VPN access
256K Internet access
128K videoconferencing
The incumbent service provider can offer these services with a single ac-
cess line at T1/E1 for approximately $1115 per month. This is for access
only and represents approximately a 65% savings for the customer. (The
managed IP-VPN packaging and pricing is discussed later in this chapter.)
The beneﬁt for the incumbent service provider is to gain and retain cus-
tomers with this service offering.
4.4.2
Managed Web Hosting
An incumbent can offer managed Web-hosting services to small to me-
dium enterprise customers that do not have the resources, people, or IT
infrastructure to administer the servers. The services can include a load-
balancing option that balances Web trafﬁc across dedicated customer
servers so that trafﬁc is evenly distributed among servers. For customers
who have multiple dedicated servers that the incumbent manages, this
feature impacts server performance such that trafﬁc does not congest a
server. The load-server balancing feature can assure that, in the event of

either a server or an application failure, the failure is detected and within
seconds fail-over to the next available server occurs without service inter-
ruption to the customer.
An incumbent can offer managed Web-hosting connectivity options
that depend on the network access methods and bandwidth, such as
Ethernet, fast Ethernet, gigabit Ethernet, leased lines, and frame relay. The
customer identiﬁes the trafﬁc requirements based on the customer appli-
cations, and these requirements determine the bandwidth needed to sup-
port the Web-hosting service. An incumbent service provider can offer
24/7 coverage for the customer, as well as options such as network man-
agement and intrusion detection for servers connected to the Internet.
The beneﬁt to the customer for this value-added service is cost reduction
and cost avoidance by outsourcing the Web server management to the in-
cumbent service provider. The beneﬁt to the incumbent service provider
is additional revenue from the new service.
4.5 Service Packaging and Pricing
This section provides examples of service packaging and pricing for IP-
based services. These examples are generic and serve as an overview for an
incumbent service provider. Bundled packages are presented here, since
the services are managed. The key approach for packaging is service dif-
ferentiation by offering enhancements to the service that are attractive
in price and provide solutions for the customer. To attack a Greenﬁeld
service provider, an incumbent service provider needs to emphasize the
value-added proposition to the customer, like feature reach, widespread
geographic range, business longevity, quick service provisioning, and a
guarantee of new value-added services via innovation.
4.5.1
Managed IP-VPN
An incumbent can offer a managed IP-VPN that is site-to-site for a large
enterprise; access can range from 56 Kb/sec–64 Kb/sec to T3/E3 via leased
lines, DSL, or frame relay. The service includes managing customer on-site
equipment (the pricing for the equipment varies depending on the com-
bination of bandwidth and service options needed by the customer). The
service has options for Internet access, voice-over-IP, and videoconferenc-
ing. Table 4.1 depicts an example of components to consider for managed
IP-VPN service pricing and service enhancements.
Service enhancements permit an incumbent service provider to offer a
base package like IP-VPN, a premium package with an addition of Internet
access, and a premium-plus package that includes IP-VPN, Internet access,
voice-over-IP, and videoconferencing. These packages may be bundled to
68
Chapter 4: Incumbent Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

the customer and can also include integrated local and long-distance
voice options that are priced according to number of minutes. For exam-
ple, a basic IP-VPN service may include a certain amount of local and
long-distance voice minutes, a premium IP-VPN may have more local
and long-distance minutes, and the premium-plus IP-VPN may offer even
more local and long-distance minutes.
4.5.2
Managed Dedicated Web Hosting
For managed Web hosting with the load-balancing server feature, price
components include the server type, the bandwidth required for the cus-
tomer’s Web-based trafﬁc, storage requirements for customer data, and ad-
ditional options such as same-day server backup and data archival. As
with the managed IP-VPN packaging, an incumbent can offer basic, pre-
mium, and premium-plus Web-hosting services. A basic Web-hosting ser-
vice may include server type, appropriate bandwidth, server backup, and
support for Web server, ﬁle transfer, email, and domain name server capa-
bilities. A premium Web-hosting service may include the load-balancing
server feature, plus additional server capacity and bandwidth. A premium-
plus Web-hosting service can comprise network management, intrusion
detection, the load-balancing server feature, and additional server capac-
ity and bandwidth.
An incumbent service provider emphasizes value-added service en-
hancements for its customers. These service enhancements can be bun-
dled to include IP-VPN and local and long-distance voice. The customer
thus receives a comprehensive service package from a single service pro-
vider; the potential beneﬁts to the customer are cost reduction and a re-
duction in the complexity that is associated in dealing with multiple ser-
vice providers. The incumbent service provider retains the customer by
offering value-added services in bundles that are attractive in price. This is

a single service provider paradigm, and in fact customers may want to
contract with multiple service providers for the same reasons that service
providers will select a multiple-vendor strategy—that is, not to be depen-
dent on a single provider. The focus of this discussion is how an incum-
bent can offer IP-based value-added services to customers.
4.6 Legacy Infrastructure
Converging multiple services to a single platform requires an evolutionary
strategy for an incumbent that has legacy infrastructure including OSS
platforms. One strategy is termed cap and grow, which means to maintain
existing legacy services such as voice and data over frame relay and grow
IP-based services onto a new network infrastructure. This strategy requires
that the incumbent build a new network.
For some incumbents, investing in a new network infrastructure may
not be possible, so a second strategy is to add features to the legacy infra-
structure that supports IP-based services, such as Layer 3 routing capabil-
ity on ATM switches. This strategy requires the incumbent to maintain
the legacy infrastructure with IP-based technology features added to it
and integrate features in the OSS platforms to support these IP-based ser-
vices—for example, network management, conﬁguration management,
performance management, and so on. This is complex, since the various
OSS platforms may be vendor-proprietary and the business-engineering
processes to provision the services are dependent on various incumbent
service provider organizations. Additionally, upgrades may be required on
the legacy infrastructure to support the IP-based features, and network up-
grades can be disruptive if not planned carefully.
A third strategy is to build an IP-based network infrastructure, grow
new services on the network, and use the legacy infrastructure (Layer 2
networks like frame relay, Ethernet, and ATM) to tunnel trafﬁc over the IP-
based network. This strategy allows the service provider to protect its ex-
isting investment while building a packet core that is IP-based. The service
provider can trunk current Layer 2 customer trafﬁc like frame relay across
the IP-based core network; it is a good strategy for an incumbent service
provider that is focused on transport and also means that the customer
manages Layer 3 routing (IP) between customer sites.
Figure 4.2 shows multiple services and transport technologies that are
common in incumbent service provider companies—such as ISDN, ATM,
DSL, leased lines, frame relay, voice, global system for mobile communica-
tion (GSM), plain old telephone (POTS), plesiochronous digital hierarchy/
synchronous digital hierarchy (PDH/SDH), and wavelength-division mul-
tiplexing (WDM) (all are described in Chapters 5 and 7). Service examples
include IP-VPN, Internet access, and remote access. These services and
technologies are mapped to functions of the incumbent service provider

network, such as a core, edge, and access network. Moving from yesterday
to today, we see that the optical transport is added to the SONET/SDH
core; DSL, frame relay, and ATM are converged to an IP-based edge; re-
mote access (network access server or NAS) connects to an IP-based edge
that provides IP-based services such as Internet access, IP-VPN, Ethernet to
the home (ETTH), and LAN interconnection for enterprise customers. The
emphasis is on evolving multiple services to value-added services based on
IP. These strategies permit the incumbent service provider to evolve legacy
infrastructure to a packet network based on IP and constitute different ap-
proaches to multiple services on a single platform. Figure 4.2 highlights
this evolutionary approach for incumbent service providers.
The incumbent service provider has several strategies to address the leg-
acy infrastructure, with an emphasis on migration toward a single plat-
form based on IP. Factors such as operating expenses due to the existence
of multiple OSS platforms and the people who administer these platforms
can be a liability for legacy infrastructure, as these expenses impact overall
proﬁtability.
4.7 What Are the Challenges?
One challenge for an incumbent service provider is to change its business
focus from transport only (e.g., voice) to value-added services. As multiple
networks collapse to a single platform, the incumbent service provider
is confronted with the possibility of downsizing, with the result of job
losses. The alternative is not to do anything, but this can result in the loss
of customers who then move away from traditional services to IP-based
services offered by Greenﬁeld service providers, with a resulting loss of
revenue. An incumbent service provider needs to price IP-based services
so as to compensate for this loss in revenue from traditional services. By
training staff to develop and support IP-based services, an incumbent can
address the fear of job loss.
Another challenge is for vendors to offer products and solutions that
can facilitate this evolutionary strategy and especially address the com-
plex business-engineering processes associated with managing multiple
networks and services. Incumbents are desperate for a solution that will
reduce the complexities in managing their legacy infrastructures while
evolving their businesses to (1) support multiple services on a single net-
work infrastructure and (2) most importantly, improve service provision-
ing. Finally, incumbent service providers need to address the cannibaliza-
tion issues related to introducing new services—it may be necessary to
cannibalize existing services in order to develop and deploy new ones.
This is part of the marketing strategy, and an incumbent has to decide
at which point cannibalization is required for value-added service
development.

Chapter 4: Incumbent Service Providers: Opportunities and Challenges

4.8 Chapter Review
Incumbent service providers have an opportunity to use IP-based technol-
ogy to reduce their own operating costs by migrating to a single infra-
structure and to develop and deploy value-added services quickly to both
large enterprises and small to medium enterprises. Incumbents have re-
sources that Greenﬁeld service providers may lack, such as a national
backbone network and research labs to evaluate and test new technology.
Fostering an image of service innovation and rapidly provisioning the ser-
vices contribute to a competitive edge for the incumbent service provider.
It is most important that these services add value to the customer’s busi-
ness, and incumbent service providers can use IP-based services to do this
by offering solutions that enhance the customer’s proﬁtability, like IP-
VPN and Web hosting.
What is the role of IP-based technology in developing and deploying
services? Chapters 5, 6, and 7 discuss the technological details that bal-
ance the business aspects of IP-based service development and deploy-
ment and give the technical base needed to understand these issues.

IP as a Building Block:
Enabling Multiservices
This goal of this chapter is to provide an architectural overview of IP as a
building block for enabling multiservices. It ﬁrst elaborates on what is
meant by multiservices, then focuses on IP as a building block for devel-
oping services. IP is at Layer 3 of the classic seven-layer open systems in-
terconnection (OSI) communication model (see Figure 5.1). It is necessary
to have a discussion regarding the underlying layers (Layers 1 and 2),
which provide the infrastructure to build IP networks, in order to under-
stand the issues related to developing IP-based services. The chapter then
goes into a technical discussion on various Layer 2 technologies, such as
ATM, POS, Ethernet, ADSL, cable, and so on, and topics, such as MPLS,
VPNs, trafﬁc engineering, multicast, and so on, that are used today in
building IP networks. This is followed by a discussion on how these tech-
nologies can help a service provider in creating new services.
5.1 Multiservices
The term multiservices has a broad meaning and depending on the context
is used to represent several things. In the context of this chapter, this term
is used to refer to the following:
●
Services that IP uses to deliver data packets: datalink layer services
that are independent of Layer 2 technology
75

●
IP-based services like IP-VPN and Internet access
●
Application layer services that make use of IP, such as IP telephony,
video-on-demand, Web hosting, and so on
5.1.1
Layer 2 Services
Figure 5.1 shows the OSI seven-layer model and the corresponding TCP/IP
model. IP is at the network layer and is responsible for delivery of packets
in the networks. Data packets are delivered based on the IP address in the
packets. The transport layer (TCP) and the application layers depend on IP
to deliver packets to the correct destination.
IP depends on the datalink layer (Layer 2) to deliver packets from one
hop to the next in the network. (An overview of some Layer 2 technolo-
gies is provided later on in this chapter.) Service providers offer a variety of
Layer 2 services to their customers, and an IP network can be built using
several Layer 2 technologies. Using different aggregation techniques and
aggregation devices, it is possible to provide IP service using different
Layer 2 technologies.
Figure 5.2 shows some of the Layer 2 networks that are used by service
providers to provide IP connectivity. These networks are also referred to as
access networks. They are used to deliver IP packets from the customer’s

premises to the nearest point of presence (PoP) of the service provider. The
packets then traverse the IP backbone of the service provider to the PoP
closest to the destination. From that PoP, the access network is used to de-
liver the IP packet to the destination.
5.1.2
IP-Based Services
Service providers generally offer several types of IP-based services. The
most common among these are VPN services and Internet access. Tradi-
tionally, the VPN services were offered using the Layer 2 networks: A
group of sites that were part of a VPN were interconnected using a Layer 2
network, and an IP network was built on top of this Layer 2 network. This
solution is not scalable because it requires a separate Layer 3 network for
each VPN.
Furthermore, it would be even more proﬁtable if the same IP backbone
can also be used to deliver other IP-based services, like Internet access.
This will help to reduce the number of IP backbones required to deliver
services, thereby saving the cost of building and maintaining them.
5.1.3
Application-Layer Services
As seen in Figure 5.1, the application layer depends on the TCP layer,
which in turn depends on IP to deliver the packets to the correct destina-
tion. In the world of data communication, communication is needed to
access or exchange data. Data may be located in a central location or in
several different locations. Depending on the nature of the data, and the

type of applications that require the data, the quality-of-service (QoS) re-
quirements regarding the data communication can vary.
Traditionally, IP networks have provided best-effort services. Best-effort
service means that the packet may be eventually delivered to the destina-
tion, but that there is no guarantee that it will be delivered within a given
time period or even delivered at all. IP provided the means for delivering
data from a source to one or multiple destinations. The Internet is a classic
example of this type of IP network. The transport layer (TCP) provided
QoS, such as
●
Guaranteed delivery in case of packet loss (retransmission)
●
Delivery of packets in correct order (reordering of packets)
●
End-to-end ﬂow control, in case of congestion either in the end sys-
tems or in the service provider network
Today, best-effort service is no longer enough to meet the QoS require-
ments of the modern application-layer services. In addition to best-effort,
some of the additional requirements are
●
Delivery on time (low latency)
●
Delivery of packets with minimum loss (low loss)
●
Delivery of a minimum number of packets in a given time period (guar-
anteed bandwidth)
●
Data security
While the ﬁrst two requirements can be fulﬁlled using the transport
layer (TCP), the other requirements are dependent on IP and the lower
layers used by IP to deliver packets. The QoS offered by IP has a direct rela-
tionship to its ability to fulﬁll the requirements of the application-layer
services. QoS refers to the following factors:
Delay
Delay variation
Packet loss
Delay is the amount of time it takes for the packet to reach the destina-
tion. Delay variation refers to the difference in delay for each packet that is
delivered to the same destination. Packet loss means that not all packets
are delivered to the destination.
Delay depends on the queuing mechanisms used by the network de-
vices to deliver packets when there is congestion in the network. It is pos-
sible to compute the minimum delay to deliver a packet from the source
and destination based on the information about the physical media and
Layer 2 services and the delays in the intermediate nodes in the network.
However, network congestion can result in additional delays in the inter-
mediate nodes and increase the end-to-end delay. (End-to-end delay refers
78
Chapter 5: IP as a Building Block: Enabling Multiservices

to the time taken for a packet to be delivered from a source to a destina-
tion. It also includes the time taken to retransmit the packet if the packet
gets lost in an intermediate node.)
Some of the reasons for packet loss are faults that occur at Layer 2,
faults that occur at Layer 1, and network congestion. Faults in Layer 2
(e.g., collision in Ethernet) and Layer 1 (e.g., cyclic redundancy check-
sum (CRC) errors) can result in packet loss. Network congestion can occur
due to lack of resources, like memory to buffer incoming packets and
when the sum of the bandwidth of all the incoming interfaces exceeds
the bandwidth of the outgoing interface. IP depends on the QoS mecha-
nisms of the lower layers in providing this QoS to the application-layer
services.
Figure 5.3 shows some of the common application services that depend
on the IP network for data delivery. These applications include voice (tele-
phony), videostreaming, database servers, Web servers, and so on. Some
of the applications, like telephony and videostreaming, are time-sensitive
applications and require low latency. Others, like database access, are sen-
sitive to packet loss. Multiservices in this context refer to QoS require-
ments of the application-layer services that make use of the IP-based ser-
vices. The IP network must be capable of satisfying or meeting the QoS
requirements of all the application services.

5.2 Architectural Overview
In this section, we provide an overview of the architecture of the service
provider IP network. This architecture will make a network stable and also
scalable. As discussed in Section 5.1, this IP network must also be capable
of delivering multiservices.
Figure 5.4 depicts an architectural overview of the network. The net-
work is built in three layers: core, edge, and access. The core network is re-
sponsible for providing connectivity between the edge nodes. The edge
network provides the intelligence that is required to support multiservices.
The access network provides connectivity between the edge nodes and cus-
tomer sites.
5.2.1
Core
The core network provides connectivity between the various edge nodes.
It should be independent of the customer network in the sense that irre-
spective of the number of customer-premises equipment (CPE) devices that
are attached to the service provider’s network, the size of the routing

tables of the core network should not be affected. Also, any instability in
the customer network should not affect the core network.
5.2.2
Edge
The edge of the service provider network is used to terminate the Layer 2
connection from the CPE devices. The edge device must be capable of
connecting to several CPE devices: this capability will help the service pro-
vider to build scalable networks and will help reduce the costs of the net-
work infrastructure. The edge device plays an important role, because
most of the intelligence that is required to create and provide IP services
resides within it. It must also be able to augment the QoS requirements of
the IP-based services when the CPE device or access network is not capable
of providing them.
The edge device must be a powerful device in terms of its ability to
●
Examine the IP packets and switch them based on the packet con-
tents. This decision could be based on the IP address or the QoS re-
quirements of the IP packet.
●
Have memory to maintain routing information
●
Implement trafﬁc-shaping, policing, and queuing mechanisms to
satisfy the QoS requirements
5.2.3
Access
The access part of the network, as the word implies, provides access to the
service provider network. Typically, the access network helps to provide
connectivity between customer sites and the service provider network. It
terminates the Layer 2 connection from the CPE onto the device on the
edge of the service provider network, the provider edge (PE) device. Various
access technologies can be used to provide this connectivity. (Section 5.4
provides an overview of some of the access technologies that service pro-
viders use today.)
A very useful device in the access network is the access concentrator,
which helps concentrate Layer 2 connections (whenever it is possible)
from several CPE devices and terminate them on a single interface of the
PE device. This type of device is typically used for access technologies that
permit multiple Layer 2 connections (and hence multiple Layer 3 streams)
on a single physical interface.
The access network plays a signiﬁcant role in providing IP-based ser-
vices to customers. Typically, the Layer 2 connectivity from a customer
site starts on the CPE and terminates on a PE device. The access network
must provide the means to terminate several customer connections on
PE devices. This will help minimize the cost of the service provider’s edge
and core networks and also make them scalable. A large growth in the
number of customers will deﬁnitely increase the number of devices (i.e.,
CPEs and access concentrators) in the access network. However, the
5.2 Architectural Overview
81

increase in the number of devices in the access network should not result
in a corresponding or similar increase in the number of the PE and core
devices.
An interesting topic in this area is the ability of the access network to
support the QoS requirements of the IP layer. This includes the ability of
access concentrators to support the QoS requirements of the IP layer. One
of the QoS requirements is bandwidth. Typically, the access network of a
service provider is oversubscribed. What this means is that the total capac-
ity of the access network will exceed the sum of bandwidth requirements
of all customers attached to the access network. This oversubscription is
normally done under the assumption that all the CPE devices do not use
all of the bandwidth all of the time. For example, in an ATM access net-
work, on a 155 Mb/sec link, there might be 100 customers, each of which
has a 2 Mb/sec PVC. This results in an oversubscription of 30%. The ser-
vice provider assumes that the customers may not be using 155 Mb/sec all
of the time. However, in a situation where all of the customers start using
their connection to the full capacity, it results in congestion in the access
network.
At this point, some of the devices in the access network have to drop
30% of the trafﬁc in order to avoid congestion. Access concentrators must
be capable of discarding trafﬁc in an intelligent manner, such that a rea-
sonable throughput is achieved at the IP layer. Since IP packets are split
into ATM cells, the ATM network must have the intelligence to discard
cells from the same IP packet rather than discard one cell from each
packet. Assuming that each IP packet is 1500 bytes long, and the ATM net-
work decides to drop one cell from each packet to avoid congestion, the
effective throughput achieved at the IP layer is zero.
5.3 Technologies
This section presents a brief description of some of the technologies that
can be used by service providers to create new services. Details about ser-
vice creation are provided in Section 5.5.
5.3.1
Multiprotocol Label Switching
Network layer routing can be divided into two parts: forwarding and con-
trol. The forwarding component is responsible for the actual forward-
ing of the packet from the input to the output across the router or a
switch. It depends on a forwarding table and the information in the
packet itself to forward the packet. The control component is responsible
for building and maintaining the forwarding table. It consists of one or
more routing protocols (e.g., open shortest path ﬁrst (OSPF), intermediate
systems-intermediate systems (IS-IS), border gateway protocol (BGP), and
protocol-independent multicast (PIM)), which help to exchange routing
82
Chapter 5: IP as a Building Block: Enabling Multiservices

information among the routers and also to convert the routing informa-
tion into a forwarding table.
In a conventional IP network, as a unicast packet traverses the network,
each router extracts forwarding information (destination IP address) from
the Layer 3 header, looks up the forwarding table, and then forwards the
packet. Header analysis is repeated at each router (hop) through which the
packet passes.
In a multiprotocol label-switching (MPLS) network, packets are forwarded
based on labels. Each IP network that is reachable through an interface is
assigned a unique label. A mapping is established between an incoming
label (ingress label) and an outgoing label (egress label). This is main-
tained in the label forwarding information base (LFIB) table. Each node
examines the incoming label, does a table lookup, swaps the incoming la-
bel for the outgoing label, and then forwards the packet out of the outgo-
ing interface. Labels only have local signiﬁcance, and they get modiﬁed
(swapped) as the packet traverses the MPLS network.
MPLS Operation
Figure 5.5 shows the details of the MPLS header. It is located between the
Layer 3 (IP) header and the Layer 2 header. The EXP bits and the TTL ﬁeld
of the MPLS header can be copied from the IP header. The S bit indicates
whether there is more than one MPLS label in this packet. Packets are for-
warded based on the label in the MPLS header.
A protocol is used between the routers in an MPLS network to assign la-
bels to IP network preﬁxes and exchange label information with other
routers. There are two protocols that are currently used, both of which are
based on TCP:
Tag distribution protocol (TDP)1 (TDP port number 711)
Label distribution protocol (LDP) (LDP port number 646)

Figure 5.6 gives an overview of label switching in an MPLS-enabled IP
network. A protocol is used to assign labels to networks that have been
learned by the interior gateway protocol (IGP). At the ingress of the MPLS
network, an MPLS header is added to the IP packet. At each hop, the
packet is forwarded by looking only at the label in the MPLS header. The
label is swapped before forwarding it to the next router. At the egress of
the MPLS network, the MPLS header is stripped and the IP packet is for-
warded out of the egress interface.
Advantages of MPLS
At a superﬁcial glance, it looks as if the main advantage of an MPLS net-
work over an IP network is that the MPLS network can switch packets
faster because it forwards them based on labels. However, this is not an ad-
vantage for only the MPLS network; IP networks also forward packets
based on a label (destination IP address). The advantages of an MPLS net-
work over an IP network are

Figure 5.6 Overview of MPLS.

Hierarchical Networks
The stack of labels aids in building hierarchical networks. This means
that the core of the IP network can switch packets without any knowledge
of the customer networks. This will help to restrict the routing informa-
tion base (RIB) to subnets in the core network to a minimum. Increase in
the number of customer networks at the edge of the service provider net-
work has no effect on the RIB in the core. Changes to the RIB in the cus-
tomer network (instability in the customer network) do not have any ef-
fect on the RIB in the core network. This makes the core stable and also
scalable.
Figure 5.7 shows an example of how MPLS helps to keep the RIB in the
core independent of the RIB from the customer network. The core routers
are P1 and P2. The edge routers are PE1 and PE2. Four customer networks
are connected to edge routers. In the core router P1, trafﬁc destined for
network 11.0.0.0/24 and 14.0.0.0/24 are switched based on the same label
(the ingress label is 6 and the egress label is 23). This is not possible in an
IP network because there is no concept of a stack of IP addresses and all
forwarding is based on the IP address of the packet. Irrespective of the
number of customer networks connected to PE2, P1 will switch all packets
destined for networks connected to PE2, based on the same label. The
number of labels used by the core router is independent of the number of
customer networks connected to the edge routers.
Trafﬁc Engineering
Since the MPLS labels have only local signiﬁcance, it is possible to build
tunnels (or forwarding paths) in a controlled manner. In other words,
it is possible to make a tunnel traverse particular links in the core net-
work. Tunnels can be built from the source to the destination in a con-
trolled manner2 (also with backup mechanisms in case of link failures).
In conjunction with reservation protocols like the resource reservation pro-
tocol (RSVP), trafﬁc-engineering tunnels can be built in an MPLS network.
Along with RSVP (using available bandwidth as the reservation criteria),
MPLS helps to provide call admission control (CAC) for IP trafﬁc. Trafﬁc-
engineering tunnels are built only when sufﬁcient bandwidth is available
on all the links from the source to the destination. Using trafﬁc engineer-
ing, service providers can do capacity planning for bandwidth in the core
network in a better and controlled manner. (More details about MPLS and
trafﬁc engineering can be found in Davie and Rekhter 2000.)
5.3 Technologies
85
2. “Controlled manner” refers to the ability to determine the links traversed by the
tunnel. The choice of the links can be static (ﬁxed path from source to destination)
or dynamic, based on criteria like availability of the link and other QoS require-
ments, such as bandwidth.

QoS
MPLS also helps to provide additional features that are not available in an
IP network: namely, end-to-end guaranteed bandwidth and end-to-end
delay for IP trafﬁc. (End-to-end refers to the path of IP trafﬁc from the
source to the destination.) Trafﬁc engineering, together with some polic-
ing and trafﬁc-shaping mechanisms at the IP layer, helps to provide guar-
anteed bandwidth.3 This is the starting point for providing QoS in an IP
network.
Intelligent queuing mechanisms on the MPLS switches help to imple-
ment trafﬁc-engineering tunnels that guarantee minimal end-to-end de-
lay and minimal jitter. QoS and trafﬁc engineering (and IP routing) have a
relationship in providing end-to-end QoS.
5.3.2
Virtual Private Networks
Another application of MPLS is in virtual private networks (VPNs). A VPN by
deﬁnition is a private network that is geographically dispersed. It is also
private in the sense that the routing and the address plan within the net-
work are completely independent of the routing and address plans of
other networks. Informally, a VPN is a set of customer sites that can com-
municate with each other.
Traditionally, VPNs are built using overlay models (Davie and Rekhter
2000). Point-to-point links are built between the sites, and an IP network
is built on top of these point-to-point links for the VPN. This means that a
separate IP network is required for every VPN, to provide interconnectiv-
ity. For a service provider, this is a costly solution and does not provide the
facilities to share the core IP network with several VPNs.
MPLS helps to build several VPNs using a single core IP network. Simi-
lar to the hierarchical model described in Section 5.3.1, the MPLS core
makes use of the stack of labels to build several VPNs using the same core.
The edge routers provide the facility to distinguish between several VPNs.
IP addresses from the VPNs are mapped to MPLS labels, and IP packets
from the VPN traverse as the MPLS packets. They carry two labels: one is
the VPN label (provided by the edge router), and the other (the top label)
is the MPLS label used for forwarding the packet in the MPLS core.
How Does It Work?
Provider (P) and provider edge (PE) routers share a common routing pro-
tocol within the core. These routers use this information to build label-
switched paths between PE routers and use two levels of labels to forward
packets.
5.3 Technologies
87
3. IP can also depend on the policing and trafﬁc-shaping support provided by Layer 2
protocols like ATM or frame relay to enforce the QoS policies.

Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instances are deﬁned on the PE—
each VRF instance represents the end point of a VPN, a separate RIB, a set
of interfaces to which VPNs are attached. To make VPN routes unique on a
PE, the VRF needs to deﬁne a route distinguisher (RD) that is preappended
to each VPN route to make a VPN IPv4 route. For example, in Figure 5.8,
the routing table of the dotted cloud VRF contains a route 10.0.0.0/24 and
the dotted cloud VRF has an RD of 1:1. This route is passed via a multi-
protocol border gateway protocol (MP-BGP) to peer PEs as 1:1:10.0.0.0/24.
The routing table of the dashed cloud VRF contains a route 10.0.0.0/24
and the dashed cloud VRF has an RD of 1:2—this route is passed via MP-
BGP to peer PEs as 1:2:10.0.0.0/24.
VPNs are built using an extended BGP community called route target
(RT). RTs have 64 bits and have the format X:Y. A PE attaches RTs (export
RT) to the routes learned from directly connected customer edge (CE) de-
vices. This RT is sent to remote PEs as an extended BGP attribute of the
route using MP-BGP. A set of VRFs on different PEs constitutes a VPN
when they import routes that have the same RTs. For example, all routes
from dotted cloud VRF VPN1 have RT 1:1, and hence belong to the same
VPN.
VPN routing tables are propagated between PEs using MP-BGP. MP-BGP
is the extension to BGP that permits the exchange of additional informa-
tion like labels, route distinguishers, and route targets (extended commu-
nities) between BGP peers. PEs that exchange extended community infor-
mation use iBGP MP-BGP peering. MP-BGP carries the RD and the RTs
associated with the VPN routes. The PE allocates labels to VPN routes
learned from the CE, and this is propagated along with the MP-BGP up-
dates to the remote PEs. The PE marks packets from CE routers with two
labels: an inner label for the destination VPN route and a second, outside
label to select the label-switched path to the remote PE (BGP next hop)
that originated the destination VPN route. More details about MPLS-VPN
architecture can be found in Rosen and Rekhter 1999 and at www.rfc
-editor.org/rfc/rfc2547.txt.
Data Forwarding
The PE allocates labels to VPN routes learned from the CE, and this is
propagated along with the MP-BGP updates to the remote PEs. At the in-
gress of the MPLS-VPN network, the PE adds two MPLS labels to the IP
packets from CE routers: the ﬁrst label (inner label) is for the destination
VPN route, and the second, outer label selects the label-switched path to
the remote PE (BGP next hop), which originated the destination VPN
route.
The P routers do not use the VPN label and forward packets only based
on the outer MPLS label. Any changes or instability in the VPN network
does not affect the LFIB of the P routers. This data-forwarding paradigm
makes the architecture scalable and stable.
88
Chapter 5: IP as a Building Block: Enabling Multiservices

Figure 5.9 gives an overview of how VPN trafﬁc is forwarded in an
MPLS-VPN network. At the ingress, PE1 receives a packet whose destina-
tion is 11.0.0.1 (dotted VRF). The VPN label for 11.0.0.0/24 is 1. The BGP
next hop for 11.0.0.0 (dotted VRF) PE2 and the MPLS label for PE2 is 6. P1
and P2 forward the data packet based on the MPLS label. P2 is the penulti-
mate hop in the data path, and it pops on the MPLS label (23) and for-
wards the packet to PE2. PE2 looks at VPN label 1 and forwards the packet
out of the dotted VRF interface.
5.3.3
Multicast
At one end of the IP communication spectrum is unicast communication,
in which a source sends a packet to a speciﬁc destination. At the other end
of the communication spectrum is broadcast communication, in which a
source sends a packet for all hosts. (The term all hosts here refers to all the
hosts in the network to which the source belongs.) Multicast communica-
tion lies in between these two communication models. In multicast com-
munication, a source sends packets to a selected group of hosts, identiﬁed
by a multicast IP address. All hosts that are members of this group receive
the packets destined for that multicast address.
Figure 5.10 shows an IP network that has a multicast source and a few
multicast receivers. Trafﬁc from the multicast source is forwarded from

multicast source is forwarded to Network A. For each packet from the
multicast source, routers R3 and R4 receive only one packet and forward
only one packet to Network B and Network C, respectively.
Multicast Applications
Multicast applications are gaining popularity today. Since these applica-
tions are unidirectional (source to destination), most of them make use of
UDP.
●
Multimedia conferencing is a common application that comes to mind
when one thinks about multicasting. In addition to audio and video,
it permits users to share resources like ﬁles, whiteboards, and so on,
during a conference. This helps remote users to have a virtual confer-
ence and also to share data and information at the same time. One
typical use would be a group of people writing a report together, us-
ing the same ﬁle.
●
Data distribution is another IP multicast application that is rapidly
becoming popular. For an example, say information from a central
database is distributed to remote databases on a daily basis. Instead

of sending the data multiple times from the central site to the re-
mote sites, it can be multicast to all the sites.
●
Software upgrades for multiple ﬁeld devices is another application. If
the same software has to be sent to hundreds of remote devices, a
multicast transfer is a good solution.
●
Real-time data multicast is another popular application. Financial in-
stitutions rely on information to do their business—a good example
is the delivery of stock information to all of the workstations on a
trading ﬂoor.
How Does It Work?
The following are necessary for multicast forwarding to work:
●
Multicast address: Certain IP addresses are reserved for multicast
applications.
●
Group membership: Hosts need to register or become members of a
multicast group.
●
Multicast routing: The location of all the hosts belonging to a multi-
cast group and the multicast source must be made available to all the
devices (hosts and routers) in the network.
●
Multicast forwarding: Multicast packets have to be forwarded to all
the hosts of the multicast group.
Multicast Address
Unlike unicast IP addresses, which uniquely identify a single IP host, a
multicast IP address speciﬁes a group of IP hosts that have joined the
group and wish to receive trafﬁc sent to this group. IP multicast addresses
have been assigned an address space by the Internet-assigned num-
ber authority (IANA). They have the binary preﬁx 1110 in the ﬁrst four
bits of the ﬁrst octet of the IP address and range from 224.0.0.0 to
239.255.255.255. Some of the IP multicast addresses in this range are re-
served for multicast applications by IANA.
Multicast Forwarding
In the unicast model, packets are forwarded based on the destination IP
address. Each router along the path forwards the packet based on this ad-
dress. Since the address is unique, this forwarding paradigm does not cre-
ate any problems. Unlike a unicast IP address, a multicast IP address repre-
sents all of the hosts that are members of that address and want to receive
packets sent there. These hosts can be scattered all over the network. Each
router in the network has to maintain information about the location of
all the multicast receivers for each multicast address.
An inefﬁcient way of forwarding multicast packets is to forward them
on all the interfaces except on the one on which the packets were re-
ceived. This results in multiple packets arriving at the destination (if there
92
Chapter 5: IP as a Building Block: Enabling Multiservices

are multiple paths from the multicast source to the destination). In order
to conserve resources, avoid duplicate packets, and avoid loops, a tree can
be built for each multicast address, with the multicast receivers as leaves of
the tree. Depending on the root of the tree, the tree can be a source tree, or
shortest path tree (SPT), with the multicast source as the root (see Figure
5.11), or a shared tree, with a node other than the multicast source acting
as the root; this node can be the root for multiple shared trees (see Fig-
ure 5.12).
Multicast packets are forwarded only along the branches of the tree.
The multicast forwarding table is maintained for each (S, G), where S is
the multicast source and G is the multicast IP address. The forwarding ta-
ble maintains (based on the tree) the list of outgoing interfaces on which
the multicast packet (S, G) has to be forwarded.
In addition to the destination address, multicast forwarding also uses
the source address to verify if the packet was received on the correct inter-
face. A multicast packet (S, G) is received on the correct interface intc on a
router R, if the reverse path to the source S from the router R is via inter-
face intc. This veriﬁcation is called a reverse path forwarding (RPF) check.
When a multicast packet is received, the router forwards the packet only
when the RPF check is successful.

The RPF check to verify that the source is in the reverse path depends
on the multicast routing protocol. In some cases, the multicast routing
protocol maintains a separate multicast routing table and uses it to per-
form the RPF check. In other cases, the unicast routing table is used to per-
form the RPF check.
Group Membership
Hosts have to announce themselves to be members of a multicast group so
that they can receive multicast packets. In order to avoid a ﬂood of mes-
sages and to reduce the complexity for themselves, hosts register with the
nearest router running multicast routing. The router then uses a protocol
to announce the existence of receivers for the multicast group. Internet
group management protocol (IGMP) is used between the router and the hosts
for this registration.
Multicast Routing
Multicast routing protocols can be classiﬁed into four categories:
●
Dense-mode protocols, like distance vector multicast routing protocol
(DVMRP) and protocol-independent multicast—dense mode (PIM-DM).

Sparse-mode protocols, like protocol-independent multicast—spare mode
(PIM-SM) and core-based trees (CBTs)
●
Link-state protocols, like multicast open shortest path ﬁrst (MOSPF)
●
Interdomain protocols, like multicast border gateway protocol (MBGP)
and multicast source-discovery protocol (MSDP)
Dense-mode protocols are based on the ﬂood-and-prune principle. They
use SPTs to deliver multicast packets using the push principle. The push
principle assumes that every router has at least one multicast receiver for
any multicast group and pushes or ﬂoods multicast packets to all the rout-
ers. Pruning is used to limit the trafﬁc to only those branches that have
routers with multicast receivers. When new receivers join at a later stage,
grafting is used to include new branches to the SPT.
Sparse-mode protocols make use of shared trees to distribute multicast
trafﬁc based on the pull principle, which assumes that multicast trafﬁc is
not wanted unless it is requested speciﬁcally (pull the multicast trafﬁc),
using a join mechanism to join the shared tree.
Link-state protocols use the SPT to determine the reachability of the
destination. However, the SPT is built using the multicast information
that identiﬁes the location of multicast receivers. This is distributed using
MOSPF.
Interdomain routing protocols like MSDP and MBGP (MBGP can also
be used within a domain) are used to route multicast trafﬁc between do-
mains. MBGP is used to forward information about multicast sources and
uses the MBGP table for the RPF check.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Multicast communication has both advantages and disadvantages. It
helps to reduce the amount of trafﬁc in the backbone and to make better
use of the link bandwidth, but this is not for free. It requires additional
forwarding mechanisms (multicast forwarding) and routing protocols to
forward multicast trafﬁc in an efﬁcient manner.
Multicast communication at the IP level is not reliable. Upper-layer
protocols have to take care of reliability in case of packet loss or corrup-
tion. Unlike unicast forwarding, reliability for multicasting can be com-
plicated. Consider the situation when out of 100 multicast receivers, one
receiver does not receive the packet. Should the multicast source resend
the packet as a unicast to this particular receiver, or should it send it
as a multicast? Resending multicast packets to unicast addresses can be
inefﬁcient when several receivers do not receive the packet. Resending
the multicast packet to the multicast address can cause confusion for
those receivers that correctly received the packets in the ﬁrst attempt.
Multicast is also not scalable because multicast group addresses cannot be
aggregated.

5.4 Transport Technology Overview
Several transport technologies are available today that can be used to
build IP networks. This section gives an overview of some of those tech-
nologies and how they can be used to build IP networks: POS, ring topol-
ogy, Ethernet, frame relay, ATM, ISDN, DSL, and cable.
5.4.1
Packet-over-SONET
Packet-over-SONET (POS) technology allows for efﬁcient transport of data
over SONET/SDH. It has certainly been a major player in accommodating
the explosive growth of the Internet. POS is a point-to-point technology.
Request for Comments (RFC) 2615 (Malis and Simpson 1999) is the Inter-
net Engineering Task Force (IETF) speciﬁcation that describes how to im-
plement POS. POS uses a point-to-point protocol (PPP) in high-level datalink
control (HDLC)–like framing encapsulation over SONET. Figure 5.13 shows
the format of a POS packet.
POS Implementations
Figure 5.14 shows the implementation of POS using the PPP in HDLC-like
framing. Router POS interfaces are frequently connected to add-drop multi-
plexers (ADMs), terminating point-to-point SONET/SDH links (see Figure
5.14(a)). Direct connections over dark ﬁber (see Figure 5.14(c)) or via dense
wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) systems (see Figure 5.14(b)) are
becoming increasingly popular.
POS provides the following features:
1. High bandwidth utilization (99% for a packet size of 4470 bytes)
2. Secure and reliable data transfer by using the features provided by
SONET and also by using a self-synchronous payload scrambler
3. Fast restoration (less than 50 milliseconds) when using SONET (auto-
matic protection switching, or APS), SDH (multiple switching protection, or
MSP), or DWDM (optical protection mechanism)
4. Maximum bandwidth dependent on the physical layer. Today, POS can
go up to 10 Gb/sec (OC-192 or STM-64)

Applications
POS provides a ﬂexible solution that can be used in a variety of transport
applications. Well-known applications include use in network backbone
infrastructures and data aggregation or distribution on the network edge
and in a metropolitan area. The use of POS for network connectivity can
be broken down into the following three main application categories:
Core
Edge
Metro
The core application refers to the backbone infrastructure for interconnect-
ing PoPs in a large network. Data transport between customer premises
and PoPs as well as intra-PoP connectivity can be classiﬁed as edge applica-
tions. Metro application normally refers to interbuilding connections, such
as in a small city downtown area or university campus.
Core Application of POS
A very common application of POS is wide area network (WAN) con-
nectivity over SONET/SDH networks. This application was the primary
motivation for the development of POS interfaces on routers. This sec-
tion looks at three primary methods for connecting routers with POS
interfaces:
Connectivity to SONET/SDH networks
Connectivity over DWDM systems
Router-to-router connectivity over dark ﬁber

POS on the Network Edge
The edge of the network is associated with trafﬁc aggregation or distri-
bution. It is also the point of convergence of regional trafﬁc housed in
the PoP. A key component of the network edge is intra-PoP connections
between aggregation routers. Until recently, technologies like Ethernet
and ATM were used for intra-PoP connectivity in service provider net-
works, fast Ethernet, and ﬁber distributed data interface (FDDI), and had
bandwidth capability pegged at 100 Mb/sec. The huge bandwidth require-
ments for server-farm deployments and corresponding applications fre-
quently required service providers to use multiple parallel 100 Mb/sec
connections. To keep up with the huge bandwidth available in the wide
area, most service providers have adopted POS as an alternative for high-
speed intra-PoP connectivity (see Figure 5.15). Using POS for intra-PoP
connectivity provides numerous beneﬁts, the most signiﬁcant being

ﬂexible design using mixed-bandwidth links from OC-3/STM-1 to OC-48/
STM-16 (available today) and OC-192/STM-64 (in the near future).
Metro Application of POS
Unidirectional SONET/SDH rings are popular for high-speed connectivity
between ofﬁce buildings in metro areas. This type of ring is normally part
of a carrier infrastructure and features ADMs for bandwidth drop-off to
routers equipped with POS interfaces. DWDM or dark ﬁber can be used
with POS in a similar fashion. Using POS rather than gigabit Ethernet to
provide framing and data transport between connecting routers allows
the use of rich management and other capabilities of SONET/SDH. It is
worth mentioning at this point that gigabit Ethernet is cheaper than POS.
POS in Access Networks
Another application of POS is to build high-speed and reliable access net-
works. The high speed, failure protection mechanisms, and reliable data
transfer make POS a good candidate to build access networks. However, it
has its limitations, and compared to other access technologies, does not
have many advantages. Some of the limitations of POS are
No aggregation capability
Lack of control on restricting bandwidth at the datalink layer
More expensive compared to gigabit Ethernet
5.4.2
Ring Topology
Ring topology is another access technology in the access network. Some of
the traditional technologies based on ring topologies include Token Ring
and FDDI. Unlike point-to-point technologies like POS or ATM, ring to-
pologies help to reduce the number of ﬁber links required to make a full
mesh. FDDI technology is very often used in metropolitan and campus
networks. Token Ring and FDDI have not grown in terms of the link speed
to keep up with the demand in the core and edge networks.
The spatial reuse protocol (SRP) has been developed by Cisco Systems for
use with ring-based media and does not have the speed limitations of
FDDI and Token Ring. It derives its name from the spatial reuse proper-
ties of the packet-handling procedure (Tsiang and Suwala 2000). SRP is a
new generation of transport technology optimized for packet-based opti-
cal transport. This optical transport technology combines the bandwidth-
efﬁcient and service-rich capabilities of IP routing with the bandwidth-
rich, self-healing capabilities of ﬁber rings to deliver fundamental cost and
functionality advantages over existing solutions.
5.4 Transport Technology Overview
99

Implementation
SRP uses a bidirectional, dual-counter, rotating-ring topology. The rings
are referred to as inner and outer rings, as seen in Figure 5.16. Both rings
are concurrently utilized for transporting data and SRP control packets.
SRP control packets handle tasks such as topology discovery, protection
switching, and bandwidth control. Control packets propagate in the op-
posite direction from the corresponding data packets. For data packets be-
ing transported by the outer ring, the corresponding control packets use
the inner ring as depicted in Figure 5.16.
SRP is a media-independent, media access control–layer (MAC-layer) pro-
tocol. Figure 5.17 shows the SRP as a MAC protocol. Like POS, SRP can be
implemented over SONET/SDH, DWDM, or dark ﬁber. Figure 5.18 shows
the format of an SRP packet. SRP allows for up to 32 nodes in a ring; the IP
addresses of all the nodes belong to the same IP network.
SRP Features
SRP offers a lot of features that make it increasingly suitable for use in
the metro networks and in service provider PoPs. Some of these features
include
1. High-speed rings (up to OC-48 link speed).
2. Fast protection (≤50 ms) against a single link or node failure in the
ring. The ring wrap feature helps to protect against link or node failure
in a transparent manner to the upper layers.

3. A distributed fairness algorithm that ensures that every node gets a fair
share of its bandwidth. This algorithm makes SRP better than gigabit
Ethernet: everyone can be assured a minimum bandwidth on the ring,
unlike in a gigabit Ethernet medium.
4. A priority ﬁeld that helps to implement QoS. The IP precedence bit
can be copied to the priority ﬁeld to provide QoS in a transparent
manner.
5. Direct multicast support for IP.

Hierarchical rings (to aggregate trafﬁc from several aggregation devices
to the edge device located in a PoP in a metropolitan city)
Interconnectivity in a campus environment
5.4.3
Ethernet
Ethernet is a LAN implementation that includes four principal categories
based on the supported bandwidth:
●
Ethernet and IEEE 802.3: LAN speciﬁcation that operates at 10 Mb/sec
over coaxial cable or twisted pair or ﬁber
●
100 Mb/sec Ethernet: Also known as fast Ethernet; runs over twisted-
pair cable and ﬁber
●
1000 Mb/sec Ethernet: Also known as gigabit Ethernet; operates at 1000
Mb/sec over ﬁber and twisted pair
●
10 Gb Ethernet: An emerging technology
Transmission Technology
Typically, Ethernet is used as a shared media, so several devices can con-
nect to the same media and share the bandwidth. An algorithm known as
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) helps all of
the devices to share the same physical media. Ethernet can also be used as
a point-to-point technology, in which case it can operate at full-duplex
mode. Ethernet technology allows the device to make full use of the avail-
able bandwidth—it does not have the mechanism to restrict the band-
width used by devices. When used in the shared mode, effective utiliza-
tion starts to degrade (due to excessive collisions) when the utilization is
high.
Today, Ethernet can be used up to a distance of 40 kilometers (25 miles)
over ﬁber. This makes it possible to use it in the access network. Also,
Ethernet is cheaper compared to other technologies, such as POS, ATM,
and SRP.
102
Chapter 5: IP as a Building Block: Enabling Multiservices

Data Encapsulation
The maximum packet size of a standard Ethernet frame is 1526.4 Ethernet
uses two frame formats to transmit data over the physical media, namely,
Ethernet format and IEEE 802.3 format (see Figure 5.19). The type of data
carried by Ethernet is indicated in the Type ﬁeld for an Ethernet frame and
in the 802.2 header for an IEEE 802.3 frame.
Each frame has a source and a destination address. Each device has a
unique Ethernet address. Techniques must be made available to map the
higher-layer address to the Ethernet address. In the case of IP, a protocol
known as address resolution protocol (ARP) is used to map the IP address to
the Ethernet address.
Broadcast and multicast addresses are available for Ethernet tech-
nology, making it efﬁcient for services like videoconferencing, video-
streaming, and so on.
Aggregation
Today, Ethernet can be used up to a distance of 10 kilometers using ﬁber.
This makes it a good technology for the access network. Aggregation de-
vices called Ethernet switches are available for Ethernet; these are intelli-
gent devices that provide several functionalities: They permit several de-
vices with Ethernet connection to communicate with each other. They
provide dedicated ports for each device connected to the switch and pro-
vide point-to-point connection between any two devices connected to the
switch. Ethernet switches also help to create multiple LANs that can be
geographically spread over an entire campus. This concept is called virtual

LAN (VLAN). In a campus, several groups can share the same physical
Ethernet network, but can be logically separate and isolated from one an-
other (see Figure 5.20).
Ethernet switches also help to aggregate connections from multiple de-
vices and terminate them on a single device in the service provider PoP.
Encapsulation techniques using 802.1Q help to have several IP sessions
(over Ethernet) on a single Ethernet interface on the edge device of the
service provider PoP (see Figure 5.21).
5.4.4
Frame Relay
Frame relay is an access technology that operates at the physical and
datalink layer of the OSI model. It is a packet-switched technology and
permits packets of variable size to be switched through the network.
Packets are switched through the frame relay network until they reach the
destination.
Devices
A frame relay network consists of two types of devices: data terminal equip-
ment (DTE) and data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE). DTE devices are
located on customer sites, and DCE devices are the Internetworking de-
vices located in the frame relay network. Some of the typical DTE devices
are routers.
Switching
A basic principle of frame relay is a virtual circuit. A virtual circuit starts on
a DTE device, traverses the frame relay network, and terminates on a DTE
device. It is bidirectional and each virtual circuit has a unique identiﬁer
known as a datalink connection identiﬁer (DLCI). Frame relay virtual circuits
fall into two categories:
●
Switched virtual circuits (SVCs): Temporary circuits that are built be-
tween a pair of DTE devices on a need-only basis and are torn down
when no data is transferred using the virtual circuit. SVCs are not
used very often because it requires a signaling protocol to establish
them.
●
Permanent virtual circuits (PVCs): Permanently established connec-
tions between DTE devices used for frequent and consistent data
transfers.
Frame relay is connection oriented, in the sense that the virtual circuits
have to be established end to end before data can be transferred. DCE de-
vices switch the frame relay packets using the DLCI value in the packets. A
single frame relay virtual circuit can be assigned a different DLCI on each
end of a virtual circuit. Multiple virtual circuits can be terminated on a
single DTE device on the same physical interface.

The DTE devices are mostly routers. DCE devices are frame relay switches
with multiple interfaces. Hosts are connected to the routers, and PVCs are
established between routers. Each PVC has a unique DLCI value. The
frame relay network in the ﬁgure provides connectivity between a ﬁle
server and two hosts located in different sites, using two PVCs.
Service Features
Frame relay provides the following features:
1. Unique identiﬁer for each virtual circuit using DLCI
2. Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint virtual circuits
3. Congestion control mechanism using forward explicit congestion
notiﬁcation (FECN) and backward explicit congestion notiﬁcation
(BECN)
4. Bandwidth allocation and control per virtual circuit using the commit-
ted information rate (CIR); QoS support

connections from multiple DTE devices to a single DTE device

a single physical interface on the edge device located in the PoP of the

ATM
ATM is a packet-switching and multiplexing technology that combines
the beneﬁts of circuit switching (guaranteed capacity and continuous
transmission) with those of packet switching (ﬂexibility and efﬁciency for
intermittent trafﬁc). The packets are called cells and they have a ﬁxed size
(53 bytes). Because ATM is asynchronous, it is more efﬁcient than syn-
chronous technologies such as TDM. In ATM, time slots are available on
demand, and cells are switched based on the identiﬁcation information
contained in each cell. ATM can be operated over several physical media
like ﬁber and copper. Links can traverse very long distances (hundreds of
kilometers) and provide up to 155 Mb/sec.5
Cell
Figure 5.23 shows the details of an ATM cell. Each cell has 53 bytes, of
which 48 bytes are the payload and 5 bytes are the header. The header
contains the identiﬁcation and other information that is used for local
management and congestion management. The following description
summarizes the ATM cell header:
●
Generic ﬂow control (GFC): Provides local function and is used on UNI
interfaces.
●
Virtual path identiﬁer (VPI): In conjunction with the VCI, identiﬁes
the next destination of a cell.
●
Virtual channel identiﬁer (VCI): In conjunction with the VPI, identi-
ﬁes the next destination of the cell.
●
Payload type indicator (PTI): Indicates in the ﬁrst bit whether the
cell carries user data or control data. If the cell contains user data,
then the second bit indicates congestion and the third bit indicates
whether the cell is the last in the series of the ATM adaptation layer 5
(AAL5) frame.
●
Congestion loss priority (CLP): Marked by ATM trafﬁc management to
mark cells in case of congestion. If the CLP bit is one, the cell should
be discarded in preference to cells whose CLP bit is zero.
●
Header error check (HEC): Checksum for only the cell header, used to
verify that the ATM cell header is not corrupted.

5. The capacity of ATM links keeps increasing: today, using STM-4 or STM-16, ATM
links can deliver up to 622 Mb/sec and 2.4 Gb/sec, respectively.

ATM Adaptation
The ATM adaptation layer is responsible for adapting the higher-layer data
to be transported as cells in an ATM network. This layer performs the
segmentation and reassembly. There are ﬁve ATM adaptations deﬁned,
known as ATM adaptation layers, or AAL1 to AAL5.
●
AAL1: This layer is designed for transport of higher-level services
that have very strict constraints on data loss, delay, and jitter. It is
normally used to transport CBR trafﬁc and is also used for real-time
variable bit rate (VBR) trafﬁc like voice. It provides for clock recovery
in the cell header and maintains 64 Kb/sec channel structure in the
payload.
●
AAL2: This layer is more suited for VBR and low-speed connections.
●
AAL3 and AAL4: These layers are designed for switched multi-
megabit data service/connectionless broadband data service (SMDS/
CBDS) services and are seldom used.

AAL5: Data trafﬁc is transported via AAL5, and this layer does not
provide for any clock recovery. Service categories that are supported
by this layer include the unspeciﬁed bit rate (UBR) and the available bit
rate (ABR). In the UBR, the network provides minimum QoS guaran-
tees on a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served basis. UBR with early packet discard or
intelligent packet discard (EPD/IPD) helps to achieve “goodput”6 at
higher layers like IP and TCP. In the ABR, the network guarantees a
minimum bandwidth that can be increased based on availability of
bandwidth. This is done on feedback received from the ﬂow control
mechanism. IP trafﬁc is transported using AAL5. (RFC 1483 provides
a good description of how to transport IP over an ATM network us-
ing subnetwork attachment point (SNAP) encapsulation.)
ATM Switching
An ATM network consists of a set of switches connected by a set of point-
to-point interfaces. ATM supports two types of interfaces: user-to-network
interface (UNI) and network-to-network interface (NNI). The UNI con-
nects ATM end systems (such as hosts and routers) to an ATM switch, and
the NNI connects two ATM switches. A data path from one end system to
another is called a virtual circuit. There are two types of virtual circuits, a
permanent virtual circuit (PVC) and a switched virtual circuit (SVC). A
PVC allows direct connectivity between end systems, guarantees the avail-
ability of the connection, and does not require call setup procedures be-
tween switches. However, the virtual circuit has to be set up manually. An
SVC is created and released dynamically and remains in use as long as data
is being transferred.
ATM is connection oriented, which means that a virtual circuit must be
established before data can be transferred. Each virtual circuit has two
identiﬁers, a virtual path identiﬁer (VPI) and a virtual channel identiﬁer
(VCI). A virtual path is a bundle of virtual channels, and a bundle of vir-
tual paths form the transmission path between two ATM switches. Each
ATM switch forwards cells based on the VPI/VCI information in each cell.
Figure 5.24 shows an ATM network with two virtual circuits. The ﬁrst vir-
tual circuit is from router 1 to router 3. The second is from router 2 to
router 3.
ATM switches forward trafﬁc based on the VPI/VCI information of each
virtual circuit, so the circuit has to be established before trafﬁc can be for-
warded. For example, trafﬁc from router 2 to router 3 starts with VPI/VCI
= 0/40. In the last ATM switch, this virtual circuit has VPI/VCI = 0/50.

Chapter 5: IP as a Building Block: Enabling Multiservices
6. “Goodput” at the IP or TCP layer refers to the throughput achieved at this layer.
During congestion, the throughput achieved at the ATM layer may result in a zero
throughput at the higher layer. This can happen if cells are not discarded in an
intelligent manner.

Trafﬁc Management
The most complex area of ATM is its trafﬁc management capabilities. Traf-
ﬁc management ensures that the QoS guaranteed by ATM to the higher
layers is carried across the ATM network. This is achieved by implement-
ing intelligent policing and queuing mechanisms in the switches. Proper
trafﬁc management also has an impact on the data trafﬁc carried by the
ATM network. For example, TCP expects the network to react in a certain
way in order to preserve the throughput at the TCP layer, and this requires
that the ATM switches discard the cells in an intelligent manner so that at
least some of the TCP packets arrive at the destination when there is con-
gestion in the network.
ATM Service Classes
ATM deﬁnes a number of service categories related to the AALs. Table 5.1
lists the most common service classes, their trafﬁc and QoS parameters,
and their common usage.
Aggregation
Similar to frame relay, ATM also provides the means to aggregate sev-
eral ATM connections onto an interface in the edge device of the service

ensures that the QoS guaranteed to each ATM connection is also guaran-
teed when the connections are aggregated to a single edge device.
5.4.6
ISDN
ISDN comprises digital technology and data transport services offered by
regional telephone carriers. It involves the digitization of the existing tele-
phone network, which permits voice, data, video, and other sources to be
transmitted over it. ISDN can be used to transport IP packets and can be
used as an access technology to deliver IP packets from the customer site
to the service provider PoP. It is typically used to provide connectivity to
small and medium enterprises. Large enterprise ofﬁces also use ISDN, as a
backup link; they typically have other access technologies as their main
link. When the main link fails, ISDN serves as the backup (see Figure
5.25).
ISDN Components
ISDN components include terminals, terminal adaptors, network termina-
tion (NT) devices, and ISDN switches. ISDN terminals are of two types: spe-
cialized ISDN terminals, called terminal equipment type 1 (TE1), and non-
ISDN terminals like analog telephones, called terminal equipment type 2
(TE2). TE2 requires a terminal adaptor (TA) to connect to the ISDN net-
work. Beyond TE1 and TE2 are two NT devices, NT1 and NT2. NT1 con-
nects to the ISDN switch; NT2 is more complicated and does the Layer 2

and Layer 3 functions. Figure 5.26 shows the components of the ISDN
network.
ISDN Interfaces
ISDN offers two types of interfaces: basic rate interface (BRI) and primary
rate interface (PRI). The BRI offers two B channels and one D channel. The
B channel service operates at 64 Kb/sec and is used to carry user data. The
D channel service operates at 16 Kb/sec and is used to carry control and
signaling information. The PRI service offers 23 B channels and 1 D chan-
nel in North America and Japan, yielding a total bit rate of 1.544 Mb/sec.
In Europe, the PRI service offers 30 B channels and 1 D channel, yielding a
total of 2.048 Mb/sec.
Data Encapsulation and Trafﬁc Management
In order to carry IP trafﬁc, most of the ISDN devices (e.g., routers) use PPP
encapsulation. PPP also provides the security mechanism in terms of au-
thentication and allocating IP addresses. ISDN is a dedicated link and
hence guarantees the entire bandwidth for the user. With respect to IP
trafﬁc, all trafﬁc is treated equally. Any additional features, such as

differentiated services, have to be implemented in the higher layers (e.g.,
IP or TCP).
5.4.7
DSL
Digital subscriber line technology is a modem technology that uses exist-
ing twisted-pair telephone lines to transport high-bandwidth data. DSL
services are dedicated, point-to-point, with public network access over the
twisted-pair copper wire on the local loop (last mile) between the service
provider’s central ofﬁce and the customer site. It can also be built on pri-
vate local loops or on local loops created either intra-building or intra-
campus. DSL has several variations, namely, asymmetric digital subscriber
line (ADSL), high bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL), symmetric digital
subscriber line (SDSL), very high speed subscriber line (VDSL), and so on.
The most common among these is asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)
technology.
ADSL Technology
ADSL is asymmetric because the maximum upstream bandwidth is differ-
ent from the maximum downstream bandwidth: downstream bandwidth
(from the provider’s central ofﬁce to the customer site) is greater than up-
stream. ADSL can be used up to six kilometers (3.75 miles). The maximum
bandwidth delivered by ADSL depends on the distance and the quality of
the physical media. The asymmetry combined with an always-on feature
makes it ideal for Internet surﬁng and video-on-demand, during which
users typically download much more information than they upload.
An ADSL circuit connects an ADSL modem on each end of a twisted
pair, creating three information channels: a high-speed downstream
channel, a medium-stream full-duplex channel, and a basic-speed tele-
phone channel. The high-speed channel typically ranges from 1.5 to 6.1
Mb/sec. The medium-speed channel ranges from 16 to 640 Kb/sec.
ADSL depends on advanced digital signal processing and on creative al-
gorithms to squeeze maximum information through a twisted pair. Two
encoding techniques—carrierless amplitude and phase (CAP) and discrete
multitone (DMT)—are used to implement ADSL. Splitters are installed in
the service provider’s central ofﬁce to separate the ADSL circuit from tele-
phone circuits (see Figure 5.27). ADSL can coexist with the telephone con-
nection when the local loop carries both analog and ISDN telephone
connections.
Transport Mechanism
Above the ADSL encoding techniques, there are two possible ways of
transporting data, namely, ATM (ﬁxed-length cells) and frame (variable-
5.4 Transport Technology Overview
115

length packets). The most popular is ATM, which makes it easy to aggre-
gate several ADSL connections using an ATM uplink. The aggregating de-
vice terminates the ADSL circuit and transmits it over an ATM network to
the service provider PoP. Figure 5.28 shows how this is typically done. All
of the ADSL circuits are terminated on the DSL aggregator, and from there
on the data is transported as ATM to the service provider PoP. The default
VPI/VCI used for carrying data is VPI = 1, VCI = 32. VPI = 1, VCI = 33 is
sometimes used to carry trafﬁc in order to manage the ADSL modem.
Data Encapsulation
ATM only provides the transport mechanism for higher-layer services like
voice, video, and data that make use of ADSL. A number of methods to
transport data across an ATM network have been deﬁned. Most common
among them are bridging, using RFC 1483 and classic IP based on RFC
1577. In the case of RFC 1483, the ADSL modem has an Ethernet interface
toward the end user, and in the case of RFC 1577, the ADSL modem has an
ATM interface toward the end user (see Figure 5.29).
5.4.8
Cable Modem
Cable modems use the cable television (CATV) network to deliver data from
the customer’s premises to the nearest service provider PoP. With near-
ubiquitous coverage, coaxial cable connections provide a potentially pow-
erful platform for providing residences and small businesses with high-
speed data access. Cable systems were originally designed to deliver

broadcast television signals efﬁciently to subscribers’ homes. To ensure
that consumers could obtain cable service with the same TV sets they use
to receive air-broadcast TV signals, cable operators re-create a portion of
the air radio frequency spectrum within a sealed coaxial cable line.
Traditional coaxial cable systems typically operate with 330 or 450
MHz of capacity, whereas modern hybrid ﬁber/coax (HFC) systems are ex-
panded to 750 MHz or more. Logically, downstream video program-
ming signals begin around 50 MHz, the equivalent of channel 2 for air-
broadcast television signals. The 5 to 42 MHz portion of the spectrum is
usually reserved for upstream communications from subscriber homes.
Each standard television channel occupies 6 MHz of the radio fre-
quency spectrum. Thus, a traditional cable system with 400 MHz of down-
stream bandwidth can carry the equivalent of 60 analog TV channels, and
a modern HFC system with 700 MHz of downstream bandwidth has the
capacity for some 110 channels.
Technology
Figure 5.30 shows the components of a cable access network. The HFC
network is common to both the television and data networks. A cable mo-
dem provides connectivity between the data devices and the service pro-
vider network. A splitter is required to separate the frequencies used by the
television (low frequency) and the cable modem. The head-end device (typ-
ically a router) is used to terminate all of the cable modem connections.
To deliver data services over a cable network, one television channel
(in the 50 to 750 MHz range) is typically allocated for downstream trafﬁc
to homes, and another channel (in the 5 to 42 MHz band) is used to

carry upstream signals. A cable modem head-end system communicates
through these channels, with cable modems located in subscriber homes
to create a VLAN connection. Most cable modems are external devices
that connect to a PC through a standard 10 Base-T Ethernet card and
twisted-pair wiring.
The cable modem access network operates at Layer 1 (physical) and
Layer 2 (media access control/logical link control) of the OSI reference
model. Thus, Layer 3 (network) protocols, such as IP trafﬁc, can be seam-
lessly delivered over the cable modem platform to end users.
A single downstream 6 MHz television channel may support up to 27
Mb/sec of downstream data throughput from the cable head-end using
the 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) transmission technology.
Speeds can be boosted to 36 Mb/sec using 256 QAM. Upstream channels
may deliver 500 Kb/sec to 10 Mb/sec from homes using 16 QAM or quad-
rature phase shift key (QPSK) modulation techniques, depending on the
amount of the spectrum allocated for service. This upstream and down-
stream bandwidth is shared by the active data subscribers connected to a
given cable network segment, typically 500 to 5000 homes on a modern
HFC network.
Transport Technology
The media access control (MAC) mechanism is normally implemented
in hardware or in a combination of hardware and software. The primary
purpose of the MAC is to share the media in a reasonable way. Both the
head-end device and the cable modem implement protocols to do the
following:
●
Range to compensate for different cable losses. It is essential that
all upstream bursts from all cable modems be received in the head-
end at the same level. If two cable modems transmit at the same
time, but one is much weaker than the other, the head-end device
will hear only the strong signal and assume everything is OK. If the
two signals have the same strength, the signals will garble and the
head-end device will know a collision has occurred.
●
Range to compensate for different cable delays. The size of a CATV
network calls for a fairly large delay in the millisecond range.
●
Assign frequencies and so on to the cable modems. A cable modem
ﬁrst listens to the downstream to collect information about where
and how to answer. It signs on to the system using the assigned up-
stream frequency, and so on.
●
Allocate time slots for the upstream.
Data-over-cable service interface (DOCSIS) is the Layer 2 standard used
between the cable modem and the head-end device. Figure 5.31 shows the
format of a DOCSIS frame. The frame control (FC) ﬁeld identiﬁes the type
of MAC header, 1 byte. Four common types are

LEN (SID) is the length of the MAC frame, deﬁned to be the sum of the
number of bytes in the extended header (if present) and the number of
bytes following the HCS ﬁeld. (For a REQ header, this ﬁeld is the service ID
instead.) EHDR is the variable-size extended MAC header (where present),
0 to 240 bytes. HCS is the MAC header check sequence, 2 bytes.

services (e.g., voice, data, and video) can be offered using a single cable
modem for each customer.
An individual cable modem subscriber may experience access speeds
from 500 Kb/sec to 1 Mb/sec or more, depending on the network architec-
ture and trafﬁc load. This provides more bandwidth than ADSL or dial-up
alternatives. In addition to speed, cable modems offer another key beneﬁt:
constant connectivity. Because cable modems use connectionless technol-
ogy, much like in an ofﬁce LAN, a subscriber’s PC is always online with the
network. That means there’s no need to dial in to begin a session, so users
do not have to worry about receiving busy signals. Additionally, going on-
line does not tie up their telephone line.

QoS transparency: QoS available at the transport layer is also applica-
ble to QoS at higher layers like IP—for example, in an ATM network,
in the case of bandwidth as a QoS parameter, cell discard due to con-
gestion can result in zero throughput at the IP layer even when the
throughput at the ATM still meets the QoS requirements
5.5 Service Creation
This section focuses on the ability of each technology to help the service
provider create services and deliver multiservices using the same technol-
ogy. Services can be provided in several ﬂavors. The goal of the service pro-
vider is to create and provide new services for their customers in such a

way that they are useful and interesting for the customers and, more im-
portantly, that they are also proﬁtable for the service provider. The ser-
vices have to be created and delivered using the existing infrastructure or
by minimum additions to the existing infrastructure in terms of hard-
ware, software, and stafﬁng requirements.
5.5.1
Role of MPLS
As seen from the discussion in Section 5.3.1, MPLS is a core technology. It
helps service providers to build core networks that are stable and scal-
able. The core of the service provider network is mainly responsible for
providing connectivity between the PoPs (edge devices) and must be capa-
ble of transporting trafﬁc related to several services. In addition to these
features, MPLS also helps to provide some value-added services, such as
trafﬁc engineering, and to meet the QoS requirements of the services that
make use of the core network for transport.
Scalable Core
The growth in the number of services offered by the service provider
should not necessitate the installation of new devices to support the addi-
tional services. The service provider will thus be able to reduce their cost
in building and maintaining the core networks. The growth in core infra-
structure required to support additional services should be at a minimum.
Since all IP packets are transported as MPLS within the core, the same core
can be used to transport IP packets from multiservices. As long as there is
enough bandwidth in the core to meet the bandwidth requirement of all
the services, new services can make use of the same core infrastructure to
transport data from one PoP location to another. Thus, MPLS helps the
service provider in reducing the cost of building and maintaining the core
network.
Stable Core
“Stability” here refers to the separation of the forwarding information base
(FIB) of the core network from the customer networks. Since the core net-
work will be used to support multiservices and multiple customers, the
RIB related to the customers must not have any impact on the RIB of the
core network. Otherwise, instability in the RIB of a customer network will
affect the core network and in turn can affect other customers.
MPLS helps to achieve this goal. The stack of labels supported by MPLS
helps to distinguish between the RIB of the core network and the RIB of
customer networks. The edge devices (PE) must have the necessary intelli-
gence to introduce additional labels and switch the packets based on these
labels. The RIB of the core devices contains information only about the
5.5 Service Creation
123

core and edge devices; the RIB of edge devices contains information about
the customer networks that are connected to the edge devices.
Figure 5.33 shows an example of how MPLS helps to achieve this stabil-
ity. Here the MPLS network helps to transport IP packets from two dif-
ferent services (dotted cloud and dashed cloud). The P routers are the
core routers, and the PE routers are the edge routers. The RIB of the edge
routers includes the network 10.0.0.0/24, 11.0.0.0/24, 12.0.0.0/24, and
14.0.0.0/24. The RIB of the P routers contains information only about the
edge routers. The P routers forward packets based on the labels for the PE
devices.
Consider the normal IP trafﬁc ﬂowing from CE1 to CE3. Packets are
switched from CE1 to PE1 based on the address 11.0.0.1. PE1 encapsulates
the IP packet in an MPLS header and attaches the label 6 (label for PE2). P1
and P2 switch the MPLS packet based on the MPLS label for PE2. PE2
switches the packet based on the IP address 11.0.0.1. The addition of new
customer networks has no impact on the RIB of the core devices. With-
drawal of the network 11.0.0.0 from the RIB of PE1, PE2, and CE3 has no
impact on the RIB of the P1 and P2 routers.

As seen in Section 5.3.1, another feature supported by MPLS is trafﬁc engi-
neering, which helps the service provider to do constraint-based routing
in a simple manner. Constraint-based routing is more complicated in a
classic IP network because IP routing is not source-based. Each hop in the
path from the source to the destination will determine how to route the
trafﬁc. Critics might point out that this can also be done in an IP net-
work by building generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnels. However,
this solution is not scalable because it is difﬁcult to manage the routing
through the GRE tunnels when the number of tunnels is large. Trafﬁc en-
gineering helps the service provider in several ways.
Bandwidth Management
When links between core devices become congested, trafﬁc can be di-
verted through less-congested links. For example, in Figure 5.34, there are
two paths from PE1 to PE2. Trafﬁc from CE1 to CE3 requires 60% of the link
capacity between core devices P1 and P2. Trafﬁc from CE2 to CE4 is now
forced from PE1 to PE2 via core devices P3 and P4 by creating a new trafﬁc-
engineering tunnel between PE1 and PE2.
Guaranteed Bandwidth
In
conjunction
with
queuing
and
policing
mechanisms,
trafﬁc-
engineering tunnels can be used to implement guaranteed bandwidth
tunnels. This helps to create new services that require guaranteed

bandwidth across the core network. This is possible because of the trafﬁc-
engineering capabilities of MPLS.
Consider the following scenario shown in Figure 5.35. Two trafﬁc-
engineering tunnels are built between PE1 and PE2. The dotted tunnel car-
ries trafﬁc from CE1 to CE3. The dashed tunnel carries trafﬁc from CE2 to
CE4. The end-to-end link capacity is 155 Mb/sec. Each tunnel has a band-
width requirement of 100 Mb/sec, of which only the dashed tunnel has
guaranteed bandwidth. Clearly, it is not possible to meet the requirements
of both tunnels. However, by using good policing mechanisms, it is possi-
ble to restrict the bandwidth allocated to trafﬁc-engineering tunnel 1 to
50 Mb/sec, thereby ensuring that trafﬁc-engineering tunnel 2 gets 100
Mb/sec bandwidth.
QoS
MPLS is used to transport IP trafﬁc across the core network. In order to
support end-to-end QoS, MPLS must be capable of supporting the QoS
guaranteed by IP. QoS in an IP network refers to the following aspects:
Bandwidth
Minimal delay, delay variation
Priority to certain classes of trafﬁc over others
Implementing effective policing and trafﬁc-shaping mechanisms can sat-
isfy bandwidth requirements. Delay and priority requirements can be sat-
isﬁed by differentiating packets belonging to different services and by im-
plementing queuing mechanisms in the routers that will help deliver the
QoS guaranteed to the different services.
In a multiservice environment, it is necessary to distinguish between
the different services. To allow trafﬁc to have different policies applied to
it, some method of differentiation of packets is required. Within the IP
header is an 8-bit ﬁeld known as type of service (ToS), within which 3 bits
were used as precedence, allowing for eight classes to be used. Figure 5.36
shows the details of the ToS ﬁeld of the IP header.
In order for the MPLS to deliver the QoS guaranteed by IP, it is neces-
sary to queue the packets using the same ﬁeld, such as IP. MPLS, however,
has 3 bits in the experimental ﬁeld in the MPLS header, which the IP pre-
cedence is copied to, as an IP packet has a label appended to it. More de-
tails about QoS can be found in Chapter 7.
5.5.2
Role of MPLS-VPN
MPLS-VPN brings several beneﬁts to the service provider and helps to cre-
ate new services. VPNs provide data security and ensure that the network
is isolated from other networks. Communication with other networks
(e.g., the Internet) is done in a controlled manner. Traditionally, VPNs

implement these features by using separate Layer 2 networks. This does
not make it scalable for the service provider because the core network can
no longer be shared among several services.
Scalable Core Network
MPLS-VPN helps the service provider to implement multiple VPNs using
the same core network by ensuring that the trafﬁc from the different VPNs
is isolated, even though all of these VPNs are implemented using the same
core network. Moreover, the RIB of the VPN is independent from the RIB
of the core. This also makes the core network scalable.
The intelligence is implemented in the PE routers. They maintain a
separate RIB for each VPN. This helps to implement VPNs that have over-
lapping address space and still make use of the same core network. Fig-
ure 5.37 shows an example of how MPLS-VPN helps to implement VPNs
that can share the same core network and how these VPNs can have over-
lapping address space. The dotted VPN and the dashed VPN use the
same address space. The PE routers PE1 and PE2 maintain separate FIBs
for each VPN and ensure the isolation between the VPNs. The core rout-
ers P1 and P2 do not have any information about the VPNs in their FIBs.
The core routers forward the VPN trafﬁc based on the core label, and
the VPN label is transparent to the core routers. The PE router inserts two
labels to the IP packet before forwarding it to the core router. The inner la-
bel is the VPN label and is used by the PE routers; the outer label is the

Figure 5.37 VPNs using MPLS-VPN.

MPLS label that is used by the core routers to switch the packets to the PE
router.
For example, for the trafﬁc ﬂowing from CE1 to CE2 (dotted VPN), P1
forwards this trafﬁc based on the label for router PE2. For the trafﬁc ﬂow-
ing from CE3 to CE4 (dashed VPN), P1 also forwards this trafﬁc based on
the label for router PE2. The inner label (VPN label) is transparent to the
routers P1 and P2 and is used only by PE2. Irrespective of the number of
routes connected to dotted VPN or dashed VPN or the number of VPNs
connected to the PE routers, P1 and P2 forward trafﬁc based on the labels
for the PE routers. This makes the core routers stable and also scalable.
Security
Isolation of trafﬁc between VPNs is implemented in the PE router. Only
the PE routers have knowledge about the VPNs; they maintain a separate
RIB for each VPN. The VPN labels are used to distinguish between packets
from different VPNs. Unique labels are used to distinguish IP packets from
different VPNs. This ensures that IP packets are delivered to the correct
VPNs. For example, in Figure 5.37, the networks 11.0.0.0/24 belonging to
the dotted VPN and the dashed VPN are connected to the router PE2. PE2
advertises the following labels to other PEs:
VPN label 1, for network 11.0.0.0/24 belonging to the dotted VPN
VPN label 2, for network 11.0.0.0/24 belonging to the dashed VPN
When PE1 receives a packet from CE3 that is destined for 11.0.0.1, it
knows that trafﬁc coming from CE3 belongs to the dashed VPN. It imposes
the VPN label 2 and MPLS label 6 onto the IP packet and forwards it to P1.
P1 and P2 forward the packets based on the MPLS label. When the packet
arrives at PE2, it sees the VPN label 2 and knows that this label is for the
dashed VPN and forwards the packet to CE4.
Extranets and Intranets
Other services that can be easily implemented using MPLS-VPN are ex-
tranets, intranets, and selective connectivity between intranets. Tradi-
tionally, extranets are implemented using policy routing, but it makes the
life of the network administrator a nightmare to maintain all of the poli-
cies. Using MPLS-VPN, this can be done in a simple and easy manner. By
selectively allowing certain routes to be leaked from a VPN to another
VPN, it is possible to create extranets and connectivity between intranets.
Firewalls can be implemented between intranets.
A typical application of extranets in the context of a large company
would be in the data center where all of the servers are located. Some of
the servers are dedicated to each department, and some of the common
servers can be accessed by a group of departments. This can be easily
5.5 Service Creation
131

implemented by creating a VPN for each department. The common serv-
ers are placed on a separate VPN (server VPN). The department VPNs can-
not directly communicate with each other, but have access to the server
VPN. Figure 5.38 shows the implementation of extranets.
5.5.3
Role of ADSL Technology
ADSL technology helps a service provider to create new IP services. The
use of the local loop to transmit data and voice simultaneously also helps
to reduce costs. One of the advantages of ADSL is that the same local loop
can be used to carry voice and data trafﬁc. This helps the service provider
to deliver multiservices (voice, data, and video) using the same physical
medium. This is a big selling point with residential customers, who can
now surf the Internet and at the same time use their telephone for voice
conversations (see Figure 5.39).
5.5.4
Role of Cable Technology
Cable technology also helps a service provider to create new IP services. As
with ADSL, the advantage of cable is that the same coax cable can be used
to carry voice and data trafﬁc. The service provider cannot only offer voice
and data but also can offer video services using the same physical connec-
tion. Residential customers can now surf the Internet, carry on telephone
conversations, and watch TV all at the same time (see Figure 5.40). A

three services.
5.5.5
Role of ATM
ATM as an access technology helps the service provider in several ways
to create new services. In the access network, ATM is one of the most ver-
satile technologies, and in combination with ADSL makes an excellent
choice for offering several services to end customers.
Multiservices
As shown in Figure 5.41, ATM can also be used to deliver multiservices. In-
telligent CPE devices can help aggregate trafﬁc from several sources and
deliver it to the service provider PoP using the ATM network. The QoS
guaranteed by the ATM network helps to easily aggregate different classes
of trafﬁc onto a single ATM link and still guarantee the QoS requirements
of all applications.
Aggregation
ATM is an excellent technology for aggregation. Aggregation helps the
service provider to reduce link costs. Another advantage of aggregation
is oversubscription. Assuming that all the customers do not send trafﬁc
at the same time, the access network can be oversubscribed. What this
means is that the sum of all the link capacity of the incoming links on the
aggregator exceeds the uplink capacity of the aggregator.

QoS
The ATM layer helps to guarantee certain QoS to end customers. QoS here
includes guaranteed bandwidth (for data transfer applications) and also
guaranteed end-to-end delay for voice and video applications. For the ser-
vice provider, the ATM layer helps to oversubscribe and to distinguish be-
tween different classes of customers. Customers who require premium ser-
vices get better QoS than customers who require only best-effort services.

This helps the service provider to oversubscribe and thus accommodate
more customers (and hence gain more revenue).
The QoS transparency between the IP layer and the ATM layer provides
an excellent means for implementing IP networks using ATM technology.
This reduces the burden on the IP layer to implement and enforce QoS re-
quirements. The processing power on the router can be devoted to other
activities related to IP services.
5.5.6
Role of Multicast
IP multicast also helps a service provider to create new services. As seen in
Section 5.3.3, there are several applications that require multicast support.
Some of these applications are also time-critical in nature. By using multi-
cast to deliver data from these applications, the service provider can re-
duce the volume of trafﬁc in the backbone. Customers can also get more
value out of their link capacity.
Consider a company that has a central ofﬁce and several remote ofﬁces.
Each remote ofﬁce has a copy of the company database. The remote data-
base is updated every morning with a copy from the central ofﬁce. If this
must be done simultaneously, then a very fast link (equal to the sum of
the link capacities of all the remote sites) is required from the central of-
ﬁce. However, if multicast is used to update the database, then the link ca-
pacity of the central site need not be very large. Assuming that the service
provider backbone supports multicast, the provider can easily offer this
service to the customer and help them reduce their costs.
5.6 Chapter Review
This chapter provided an overview of the architecture of the IP network of
a service provider, followed by a discussion on the various technologies
that enable a service provider to build stable and scalable IP networks.
Building a scalable and stable core network is very important for ser-
vice providers because it will help them to support several services at
once, thereby reducing maintenance costs. This topic was followed by a
discussion on the various access technologies that help transport IP pack-
ets from the customer site to the nearest service provider PoP. Some of the
features that must be supported by these access technologies to make
them scalable were also discussed, such as aggregation and transparency
in QoS between the access network and the IP network.
The latter part of the chapter focused on how the various technologies
help to create new IP-based services for the service provider. The next
chapter focuses on implementing IP-based services and the role of net-
work management in developing and deploying those services.

IP-Based Service
Implementation and
Network Management
The previous chapter discussed IP and the technologies that help a service
provider to develop IP-based services. This chapter discusses the imple-
mentation and delivery of those services. While technology plays an im-
portant role in developing services, it is also important that the services be
provisioned and delivered in an easy and proﬁtable manner. “Easy and
proﬁtable” here refers to the scalability of the solution in terms of the
stafﬁng and skills required to implement the solution for a mass market.
Technical implementation in the lab is an academic exercise to show the
feasibility of a solution. This solution may not be proﬁtable for a service
provider if provisioning the service for a large number of customers is too
expensive or time-consuming.
It is important that the provisioning of the service be (1) simple, mean-
ing that it can be done easily and does not require skilled staff, and (2)
scalable, meaning that a signiﬁcant number of customers can be pro-
visioned in a reasonable period of time. The terms signiﬁcant number
and reasonable period of time have to be deﬁned by the service provider
with reference to proﬁtability. The choice of network devices and
137

provisioning tools plays an important role in making the service provi-
sion simple and scalable.
Another signiﬁcant factor in provisioning services is service upgrades. A
service upgrade may require changes in the conﬁguration of existing de-
vices or a software/hardware upgrade of the network devices. The ease and
speed at which a service upgrade can be done for a large number of cus-
tomers also play an important role in making a service proﬁtable for the
service provider.
Another important aspect of delivering IP-based services is network
management. It is not enough if the service is implemented correctly. It
must also be monitored on a regular basis to ensure that it is functioning
properly. This requires an investment in equipment, stafﬁng, and intelli-
gence in the network devices. There is a trade-off between the cost of
monitoring and the beneﬁts provided by monitoring. Proactive monitor-
ing is useful and helps to prevent service outages and network downtime.
The cost of repairing a fault after its manifestation can be much higher
than the cost of monitoring the network and preventing the occurrence
of the fault in the ﬁrst place.
Consider the situation in which a network device starts malfunc-
tioning as the memory usage and load on it reaches a certain thresh-
old. This device is in a remote location, so it takes a few hours for the
maintenance crew to physically reach it. The load and memory usage
are directly proportional to the number of customer connections ter-
minating on the device. When the load reaches the threshold, the de-
vice stops functioning and must be reset. The maintenance crew must
go to the site where it is located in order to reset it. Proactive monitor-
ing of the load and memory usage of the device can help to prevent this
situation. In order to keep a good balance between the cost and beneﬁts
of monitoring, it is necessary to have a good network management
infrastructure.
This chapter focuses on the implementation of IP-based services, moni-
toring the network to ensure correct delivery of the services, and reporting
the status of the devices to customers as part of the service-level agreement
(SLA). As SNMP plays an important role in implementing IP-based ser-
vices, a brief discussion on SNMP is presented in the beginning of the
chapter.
Several aspects related to the implementation of IP-based services are
presented in this chapter, such as security and management. The opera-
tions support system (OSS) is the system responsible for implementing the
IP-based services. A discussion on the importance of OSS, its architecture,
and its requirements is also presented here. (Chapter 8 presents several
case studies that show the importance of the OSS in implementing IP-
based services.)

Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

6.1 Simple Network Management Protocol
The simple network management protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer
protocol that facilitates the exchange of management information be-
tween network devices. It is part of the transmission control protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) suite. SNMP enables network administrators to manage
network performance, ﬁnd and solve network problems, and plan for net-
work growth. Three versions of SNMP exist: SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1),
SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2), and SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3). All three ver-
sions have a number of features in common, but SNMPv2 offers enhance-
ments, such as additional protocol operations, and SNMPv3 offers secu-
rity features.
SNMP plays an important role in managing networks. It helps provide a
uniform interface to access and manage all network devices. More detailed
information about SNMP can be found in Stallings 1998. This section
makes use of information presented in Downes et al. 1998.
6.1.1
Description
SNMP deﬁnes a client/server relationship. The client program (called the
network management system, or NMS) makes virtual connections to a server
program (called the SNMP agent) that executes on a remote network de-
vice, and serves information to the NMS regarding the device’s status. The
database, controlled by the SNMP agent, is referred to as the SNMP man-
agement information base (MIB) and is a standard set of statistical and con-
trol values. SNMP additionally allows the extension of these standard val-
ues with values speciﬁc to a particular agent through the use of private
MIBs.
Directives, issued by the NMS client to an SNMP agent, consist of the
identiﬁers of SNMP variables (referred to as MIB object identiﬁers or MIB
variables) along with instructions to either get the value for the identiﬁer
or set the identiﬁer to a new value. Through the use of private MIB vari-
ables, SNMP agents can be tailored for a myriad of speciﬁc devices, such
as network bridges, gateways, and routers. The deﬁnitions of MIB vari-
ables supported by a particular agent are incorporated in descriptor ﬁles,
written in Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1)[ASN.1-1, ASN.1-2, ASN.1-3,
ASN.1-4] format, made available to network management client programs
so that they can become aware of MIB variables and their usage.
6.1.2
Components
As shown in Figure 6.1, an SNMP managed network consists of four key
components: managed devices, agents, MIBs, and an NMS.
6.1 Simple Network Management Protocol
139

●
Managed device: A network node that contains an SNMP agent and
resides on a managed network. Managed devices collect and store
management information and make this information available to
the NMS using SNMP. Managed devices, sometimes called network el-
ements, can be routers and access servers, switches and bridges, hubs,
computer hosts, and printers.
●
Agent: A network management software module that resides in a
managed device. An agent has local knowledge of management in-
formation and translates that information into a form compatible
with SNMP.
●
MIB: Consists of the management information that resides in
the managed device. The agent provides a standard access to the
MIB.
●
NMS: Executes applications that monitor and control managed de-
vices. The NMS provides the bulk of the processing and memory re-
sources required for network management. One or more NMSs must
exist on any managed network.

6.1.3
Operations
Managed devices are monitored and controlled using four basic SNMP
commands: read, write, trap, and traversal operations.
●
Read command: Used by an NMS to monitor managed devices. The
NMS examines different variables that are maintained by managed
devices.
●
Write command: Used by an NMS to control managed devices.
The NMS changes the values of variables stored within managed
devices.
●
Trap command: Used by managed devices to asynchronously report
events to the NMS. When certain types of events occur, a managed
device sends a trap to the NMS.
●
Traversal operations: Used by the NMS to determine which variables a
managed device supports and to sequentially gather information in
variable tables, such as a routing table.
6.1.4
Management Information Base
A management information base (MIB) is a collection of information that
is organized hierarchically. MIBs are accessed using a network manage-
ment protocol such as SNMP. They are composed of managed objects and
are identiﬁed by object identiﬁers. A managed object (sometimes called an
MIB object, an object, or a MIB) is one of any number of speciﬁc characteris-
tics of a managed device. Managed objects are composed of one or more
object instances, which are essentially variables. Two types of managed
objects exist: scalar and tabular. Scalar objects deﬁne a single object in-
stance. Tabular objects deﬁne multiple related object instances that are
grouped together in MIB tables.
Figure 6.2 shows a sample MIB tree and shows examples of scalar and
tabular managed objects. An example of a scalar managed object is
ifNumber, which is a scalar object that contains a single object instance,
the integer value that indicates the total number of interfaces in the
router. An example of a tabular managed object is ifTable, which is a
tabular object that contains a multiple object instance. Each instance con-
tains detailed information about the interfaces in the router. The top-level
MIB object IDs belong to different standards organizations, while lower-
level object IDs are allocated by associated organizations. Vendors can de-
ﬁne private branches that include managed objects for their own prod-
ucts. MIBs that have not been standardized typically are positioned in the
experimental branch. The managed object ifNumber can be uniquely

SNMP Version 1 (SNMPv1) is the initial implementation of the SNMP pro-
tocol. It is described in RFC 1157 (Case et al. 1990) and functions within
the speciﬁcations of the structure of management information (SMI).
SNMPv1 operates over protocols such as the user datagram protocol (UDP),

agement protocol in the Internet community.
SNMPv1 and Structure of Management Information
The structure of management information (SMI) deﬁnes the rules for de-
scribing management information, using ASN.1. The SNMPv1 SMI is de-
ﬁned in RFC 1155 (Rose and McCloghrie 1990). It makes three key speci-
ﬁcations: ASN.1 data types, SMI-speciﬁc data types, and SNMP MIB tables.
SNMPv1 and ASN.1 Data Types
The SNMPv1 SMI speciﬁes that all managed objects have a certain sub-
set of ASN.1 data types associated with them. Three ASN.1 data types are
required: name, syntax, and encoding. The name serves as the object
identiﬁer (object ID). The syntax deﬁnes the data type of the object (e.g.,
integer or string). The SMI uses a subset of the ASN.1 syntax deﬁnitions.
The encoding data describes how information associated with a managed
object is formatted as a series of data items for transmission over the
network.
SNMPv1 and SMI-Speciﬁc Data Types
The SNMPv1 SMI speciﬁes the use of a number of SMI-speciﬁc data types,
which are divided into two categories: simple data types and application-
wide data types. Three simple data types are deﬁned in the SNMPv1 SMI,
all of which are unique values: integers, octet strings, and object IDs.
●
Integer data type: A signed integer in the range of −2,147,483,648 to
2,147,483,647.
●
Octet strings: Ordered sequences of 0 to 65,535 octets.
●
Object IDs: Come from the set of all object identiﬁers allocated ac-
cording to the rules speciﬁed in ASN.1.
Seven application-wide data types exist in the SNMPv1 SMI: network
addresses, counters, gauges, time ticks, opaques, integers, and unsigned
integers.
●
Network addresses: Represent an address from a particular protocol
family. SNMPv1 supports only 32-bit IP addresses.
●
Counters: Nonnegative integers that increase until they reach a maxi-
mum value and then return to zero. In SNMPv1, a 32-bit counter size
is speciﬁed.
●
Gauges: Nonnegative integers that can increase or decrease but retain
the maximum value reached.
●
Time tick: Represents a hundredth of a second since some event.
6.1 Simple Network Management Protocol
143

●
Opaque: Represents an arbitrary encoding that is used to pass arbi-
trary information strings that do not conform to the strict data typ-
ing used by the SMI.
●
Integer: Represents signed integer-valued information. This data type
redeﬁnes the integer data type, which has arbitrary precision in
ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI.
●
Unsigned integer: Represents unsigned integer-valued information
and is useful when values are always nonnegative. This data type
redeﬁnes the integer data type, which has arbitrary precision in
ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI.
SNMP MIB Tables
The SNMPv1 SMI deﬁnes highly structured tables that are used to group
the instances of a tabular object (i.e., an object that contains multiple vari-
ables). Tables are composed of zero or more rows, which are indexed in a
way that allows SNMP to retrieve or alter an entire row with one Get,
GetNext, or Set command.
SNMPv1 Protocol Operations
SNMP is a simple request-response protocol. The network management
system issues a request, and managed devices return responses. This be-
havior is implemented by using one of four protocol operations: Get,
GetNext, Set, and Trap.
●
Get operation: Used by the NMS to retrieve the value of one or more
object instances from an agent. If the agent responding to the Get
operation cannot provide values for all the object instances in a list,
it does not provide any values.
●
GetNext operation: Used by the NMS to retrieve the value of the next
object instance in a table or list within an agent.
●
Set operation: Used by the NMS to set the values of object instances
within an agent.
●
Trap operation: Used by agents to asynchronously inform the NMS of
a signiﬁcant event.
6.1.6
SNMP Version 2
SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2) is an evolution of the initial version, SNMPv1.
Originally, SNMPv2 was published as a set of proposed Internet standards
in 1993. Currently, it is a draft standard. As with SNMPv1, SNMPv2 func-
tions within the speciﬁcations of the SMI. In theory, SNMPv2 offers a
number of improvements to SNMPv1, including additional protocol
operations.
144
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

SNMPv2 and Structure of Management Information
The structure of management information (SMI) deﬁnes the rules for de-
scribing management information, using ASN.1. The SNMPv2 SMI is de-
scribed in RFC 1902. It makes certain additions and enhancements to the
SNMPv1 SMI-speciﬁc data types, such as including bit strings, network ad-
dresses, and counters.
●
Bit strings: Deﬁned only in SNMPv2 and comprise zero or more
named bits that specify a value.
●
Network addresses: Represent an address from a particular protocol
family. SNMPv1 supports only 32-bit IP addresses, but SNMPv2 can
support other types of addresses as well.
●
Counters: Nonnegative integers that increase until they reach a maxi-
mum value and then return to zero. In SNMPv1, a 32-bit counter size
is speciﬁed. In SNMPv2, 32-bit and 64-bit counters are deﬁned.
SMI Information Modules
The SNMPv2 SMI also speciﬁes information modules, which specify a
group of related deﬁnitions. Three types of SMI information modules ex-
ist: MIB modules, compliance statements, and capability statements.
●
MIB modules: Contain deﬁnitions of interrelated managed objects.
●
Compliance statements: Provide a systematic way to describe a group
of managed objects that must be implemented for conformance to a
standard.
●
Capability statements: Used to indicate the precise level of support
that an agent claims with respect to a MIB group. An NMS can adjust
its behavior toward agents according to the capability statements as-
sociated with each agent.
SNMPv2 Protocol Operations
The Get, GetNext, and Set operations used in SNMPv1 are also used in
SNMPv2. SNMPv2 adds and enhances some protocol operations. The
SNMPv2 trap operation, for example, serves the same function as that
used in SNMPv1, but it uses a different message format and is designed to
replace the SNMPv1 trap. SNMPv2 also deﬁnes two new protocol opera-
tions: GetBulk and Inform.
●
GetBulk operation: Used by the NMS to efﬁciently retrieve large blocks
of data, such as multiple rows in a table. GetBulk ﬁlls a response mes-
sage with as much of the requested data as will ﬁt.
●
Inform operation: Allows one NMS to send trap information to an-
other NMS and receive a response. In SNMPv2, if the agent respond-
ing to the GetBulk operation cannot provide values for all of the
variables in a list, it will provide partial results.

Security Issues
SNMP lacks any authentication capabilities, which results in vulnerability
to a variety of security threats. These include masquerading, modiﬁcation
of
information,
message
sequence
and
timing
modiﬁcations,
and
disclosure.
●
Masquerading: Consists of an unauthorized entity attempting to per-
form management operations by assuming the identity of an autho-
rized management entity.
●
Modiﬁcation of information: Involves an unauthorized entity attempt-
ing to alter a message generated by an authorized entity so that the
message results in unauthorized accounting management or con-
ﬁguration management operations.
●
Message sequence and timing modiﬁcations: These occur when an un-
authorized entity reorders, delays, or copies and later replays a mes-
sage generated by an authorized entity.
●
Disclosure: Results when an unauthorized entity extracts values
stored in managed objects, or learns of notiﬁed events by monitor-
ing exchanges between managers and agents.
The security issues related to SNMP are addressed in a newer version of
SNMP known as SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3).
6.1.8
SNMP Version 3
SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) is the latest version of SNMP (Case et al. 1990;
Wijnen et al. 1999). It uses the framework provided by SNMPv2 and pro-
vides some additional features. The new features of SNMPv3 (in addition
to those of SNMPv2 listed above) include
●
Security features:
Authentication
Privacy
Authorization and access control
●
Administrative framework features:
Naming of entities
People and policies
Usernames and key management
Notiﬁcation destinations
Proxy relationships
Remotely conﬁgurable via SNMP operations
SNMPv3 includes three important services: authentication, privacy,
and access control. To deliver these services in a ﬂexible and efﬁcient man-
ner, SNMPv3 introduces the concept of a principal, which is the entity on
whose behalf services are provided or processing takes place. A principal
146
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

can be an individual acting in a particular role. It can also be a set of indi-
viduals with every individual acting in a particular role. In essence, a prin-
cipal operates from a management station and issues SNMP commands to
agent systems. The identity of the principal and the target agent together
determine the security features that will be invoked, including authenti-
cation, privacy, and access control. The use of principals allows security
policies to be tailored to the speciﬁc principal, agent, and information
exchange, and gives human security managers considerable ﬂexibility in
assigning network authorization to users. SNMPv3 security options are
shown in Figure 6.3. (More details about SNMPv3 security issues can be
found in Stallings 1998.)
6.2 IP-Based Service Implementation—OSS
IP-based service implementation plays an important role in delivering
services to customers. It is also critical for service providers, because it
helps them to roll out their services in a timely manner, ensure that the
services are implemented correctly, win the conﬁdence of the customers,
and thereby gain and maintain a large share of the customer base. A good
service implementation model is the key to implementing services. The

term implementation as regards an IP-based service for a customer refers to
several aspects of the service. It starts when the customer is sold the idea of
the service, and the end result is when the customer can make use of the
service.
To begin with, the customer is sold the idea of the service by the service
provider. Once the service is sold, it has to be realized before the customer
can actually use it. In some cases, the customer has to provide essential de-
tails for implementing the service—for example, information about the IP
addressing plan of the customer network, the number of customer sites
that require the service, the network infrastructure available at each site,
and so on. Once all of the information is available, new network devices
have to be installed as required on the customer sites and connected to
the nearest PoP. The service provider’s network devices have to be conﬁg-
ured to provision all of the new connections; after the conﬁgurations are
complete, the service is ready to be made available to the customer.
The devices have to be integrated into the network monitoring system
of the service provider. SLA reporting for the customer (if relevant for the
service) has to be activated so that reports can be generated and made
available. The billing department has to be informed about the new ser-
vice so that the customer can be charged for it.
Several key departments are involved in implementing IP-based ser-
vices, including
●
Business marketing department: Responsible for deﬁning the business
aspect of the services like pricing, service options, time to market,
and so on
●
Sales department: Responsible for selling the IP-based services to the
customer, maintaining the customer contact, and also for getting
the requirements and information from the customer that are re-
quired for implementing the IP-based services
●
Engineering department: Responsible for developing and testing the
technical solution for implementing the IP-based services
●
NMS department: Responsible for developing the NMS tools required
for mass deployment of the services, service upgrades, billing, and
SLA reports
●
NOC: Responsible for deploying the services, monitoring the net-
work, and ensuring that SLAs are reported to the customer
●
Billing department: Responsible for billing the customer for their IP-
based services
Each department has information that is critical for the correct imple-
mentation of the services to each individual customer. Oftentimes, the in-
formation provided by one department is crucial input for another de-
partment in order to implement the service. For example, the NOC is
responsible for deploying the services. The billing department needs to
know when the services have been implemented in order to start billing
148
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

the customer. If the customer is charged based on the bandwidth of each
link from the customer site to the nearest PoP, then the NOC must also in-
form the billing department about the bandwidth of each installed link.
It is essential that information ﬂow properly, accurately, and promptly
from one department to another. The service implementation model must
meet the requirements of all the departments and must also ensure that
the services can be correctly implemented. This system responsible for
the integration of all the requirements is often referred to as the opera-
tions support system (OSS). (More details about the OSS are presented in
Section 6.5.)
6.3 Provisioning—What Are the Issues?
This section presents the issues related to provisioning the services for the
customer. Details about the various tasks are also sketched out, giving you
an insight into the complexity of provisioning.
6.3.1
What Is Provisioning?
First of all, it is important to deﬁne the term provisioning before discussing
anything about the issues related to this subject. When an IP-based service
is offered to a customer, it has to be implemented for that customer. This
implementation can involve the following tasks:
1. Installing new devices (customer-premises equipment) at customer sites
2. Connecting the CPE device to the service provider network
3. Conﬁguring the CPE devices for the new service
4. Updating the conﬁguration of the relevant network devices in the ser-
vice provider network to activate the service
5. Updating the network management systems with the information
about the new customer and the network devices that have been
installed
6. Activating the service
7. Activating the monitoring of the devices that are relevant for service
delivery
All of these tasks may not be necessary for every new customer. The term
provisioning loosely refers to all of the tasks mentioned above. The follow-
ing section discusses these activities in detail.
Installation and Conﬁguration of CPE Devices
Most services require a CPE device to be installed at the customer site.
After the installation, they must be physically connected to the service
provider network. The next step is the logical connection between the
CPE device and the service provider network: CPE devices have to be
6.3 Provisioning—What Are the Issues?
149

conﬁgured, or programmed, to deliver the correct service for the cus-
tomer. It is important that the conﬁguration be correct in order for the ser-
vice to be delivered correctly. In most cases, the conﬁguration on the CPE
device has several parts: a part that is responsible for the normal operation
of the CPE device and other parts that are responsible for specialized func-
tions speciﬁc to the service in question.
For example, consider a router that is responsible for providing Internet
connectivity to a corporation. A part of the router is responsible for send-
ing and receiving IP packets. This can be considered as a basic conﬁgura-
tion on the router. Another part of the router is responsible for ensuring
that the IP address space of the corporation is correctly advertised to the
Internet using a routing protocol like BGP. This is the specialized conﬁgu-
ration that is responsible for implementing the service (Internet access).
Another aspect of the conﬁguration on the CPE devices is the parame-
ters necessary to generate the conﬁguration. Some of these parameters
may be the same for all devices, while others are variable and depend on
the service being offered or on the customer location. For example, con-
sider the same router providing Internet access. The IP address on the
router interface connected to the customer network is related to the IP ad-
dressing plan of the customer. The link capacity to the Internet also de-
pends on the customer requirements. All of this information must be cor-
rectly conﬁgured on all of the CPE devices in order for the service to
function properly.
Conﬁguration of Network Devices
Before the CPE devices can communicate with the service provider net-
work, the devices in the service provider network have to programmed, or
conﬁgured. It may be necessary to program a single device or several de-
vices before establishing communication between the CPE device and the
service provider network. It is necessary that the conﬁguration on all the
intermediate devices be correct before the communication can be
established.
For example, when ATM is used as the access technology, the VPI/VCI
must be conﬁgured correctly on all of the ATM switches between the CPE
and the PE in the access network. In addition, if bandwidth guarantee
(QoS) is a requirement, then the ATM class of service (CoS) must also match
on all of the ATM switches between the CPE and PE devices in order for
the ATM network to meet the bandwidth requirements of the CPE device.
It is also important that the conﬁgurations of the CPE device and the
service provider network match in order for them to communicate. Mis-
match in conﬁgurations can result in no communication or incorrect de-
livery of the service. For example, the IP address on the CPE device and
the PE in the service provider PoP must be in the same network in order
for them to be able to exchange IP packets and routing information. If the
150
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

IP addresses do not match, then there will be no communication between
these devices. In the case of guaranteed bandwidth services using ATM
technology, mismatch in the ATM CoS parameters can result in loss of
packets and hence a degradation in the service.
Service Activation
When all of the relevant devices have been correctly conﬁgured, the
next step is to activate the service. This step may involve several activities,
such as
1. Activating the Layer 2 connectivity on the CPE device
2. Introducing all of the new CPE devices into the monitoring system
3. Activating the monitoring of all CPE devices
When all of these steps are completed, the service has been activated.
6.3.2
Device Conﬁguration
Every IP-based service requires conﬁguration of the CPE and service pro-
vider network devices. Some of this conﬁguration is speciﬁc to a service
and may not affect all the devices. Several solutions may be available to
implement the same service, and each solution will have its advantages
and disadvantages.
Consider the following scenario, in which a service provider wants to
implement guaranteed bandwidth services in the access network. The ac-
cess technology is ATM, and the service provider has an ATM access net-
work. The service provider manages the CPE device. In order to imple-
ment guaranteed IP bandwidth service, it is enough to implement ATM
trafﬁc shaping on the CPE device. In order to ensure that trafﬁc shap-
ing functions properly on the CPE device (after all, this is done in soft-
ware and it is practically impossible to write bug-free software), ATM
trafﬁc policing can be implemented on the ﬁrst ATM switch (see Figure
6.4). Another possible variation is to implement trafﬁc shaping on all
of the outbound interfaces and trafﬁc policing on the inbound inter-
faces (see Figure 6.5). The second solution requires more resources to
conﬁgure all of the devices and also makes the conﬁguration more
complicated.
Another major issue in the conﬁguration of network devices is the
chance of misconﬁguration. The potential risk of misconﬁguration is al-
ways there and cannot be avoided. Modiﬁcations to the conﬁguration of
network devices to provision new service requests may not be done cor-
rectly and may disrupt service for other customers if the changes to the
conﬁgurations are incorrect and are not implemented in the correct order.
By keeping conﬁguration changes to a minimum number of devices, the
overall chance of misconﬁguration can be reduced.
6.3 Provisioning—What Are the Issues?
151

Consider again the scenario described in Figure 6.4. The link between
the CPE device and the PE device is supposed to deliver 2 Mb/sec. In
the case of Solution 2, due to a mismatch in conﬁguration if the trafﬁc po-
licing on Switch 2 is set for 512 Kb/sec instead of 2 Mb/sec, then the effec-
tive bandwidth between the PC and the ﬁle server is only 512 Kb/sec.
This problem could have been avoided if the policing were restricted to
Switch 1.

To summarize, in order to keep a service simple and easy to imple-
ment, it is necessary to make the service-speciﬁc conﬁguration as simple
as possible and restrict it to a minimum number of devices. In doing so,
one can reduce (1) the stafﬁng and time required to provision a service re-
quest, (2) the risks of misconﬁguration, and (3) disruption in service for
other customers.
6.3.3
How to Conﬁgure the Devices
Most network devices have software installed on them that allows the
conﬁguration of the device in order to support several functions. Mod-
iﬁcation to relevant parameters in the device activates the corresponding
functions on the device. Depending on the device and the manufacturer,
several methods are available for modifying conﬁgurations of network de-
vices. Some common methods include
●
Text-based command line interface (CLI), to modify values of parame-
ters or activate functions
●
Menu-based CLI, to modify values of parameters or activate functions
●
Web-based CLI, to modify values of parameters or activate functions
●
SNMP-based interface, to set value of variables
Most of these methods provide the operator with an interface to mod-
ify the conﬁguration. In order to prevent unauthorized access to the de-
vice, some form of authentication (username/password) is implemented
on all, the devices. Operators are allowed to modify the conﬁguration
only when they have correctly identiﬁed themselves to the device.
Text-Based CLI
Text-based CLI provides the operator with the possibility of viewing and
modifying the conﬁguration of the device. This requires the operator to
log onto the device. Devices normally have a console monitor that pro-
vides the interface to the device. The operator then has the possibility of
typing the commands that are then executed by the device. A text-based
interface requires the operator to have a good understanding of the syntax
and semantics of CLI. The operator must also have a good knowledge
about the semantics of the parameters that can be modiﬁed and also how
to modify the value of parameters. The CLI, the syntax of the commands,
and the semantics of the variables may all vary from device to device. Op-
erators need to have a good understanding of all of these and must be well
trained in order to reduce the risks of misconﬁguration.
Menu-Driven CLI
Like the text-based CLI, menu-driven CLI helps the operator. Unlike the
text-based CLI, however, the operator does not need to know the syntax
6.3 Provisioning—What Are the Issues?
153

of all the commands. The operator is prompted to choose from a list of
commands—the menu-based CLI may have several choices—and is re-
quired to know the signiﬁcance of each command. All of the commands
may not be presented to the operator at the same time.
The menu-based CLI may be organized in a hierarchical manner, and
the commands may be grouped based on functionality. In this case, the
operator needs to have knowledge about the groups of commands and
how to navigate through the set of menus before executing the necessary
commands in order to make conﬁguration changes.
Web-Based CLI
Today, Web-based interfaces are very popular in all domains. Most of the
network devices from vendors also support Web-based interfaces. Web-
based CLI helps provide a standard access method. Most workstations sup-
port some form of Web browsers and hence can be used to access the net-
work device. Depending on the support available on the network device,
the Web-based CLI may have either a menu-driven or a text-based CLI.
SNMP
The most popular method is the SNMP-based interface. SNMP is a stan-
dard protocol that is widely used in the industry. Its simplicity makes it a
popular choice for conﬁguring network devices. SNMP provides an opera-
tion known as set, with which it is possible to modify the value of parame-
ters on the device. The MIB includes deﬁnitions for parameters, or vari-
ables, that are a part of the device conﬁguration. By modifying the value
of these parameters using SNMP, it is possible to change the conﬁguration
of a network device.
Each device has its own MIB. In order to provide a common interface
independent of the network device and the manufacturer, standard MIB
variables have been deﬁned for IP networks. This standardization has
helped to provide a common interface for accessing network devices inde-
pendent of the manufacturer. The MIB also contains device-speciﬁc vari-
ables and vendor-speciﬁc features on each network device. These variables
are deﬁned as a private MIB speciﬁc to each device.
In order to use SNMP to conﬁgure a network device, the MIB on the
network device must contain all of the variables that are required to mod-
ify the conﬁguration. The SNMP agent residing in the network device
must be capable of reading and modifying the value of these variables.
The use of SNMP helps to develop standard tools to conﬁgure devices,
which in turn helps to automate the tasks of conﬁguring new network de-
vices and modifying the conﬁguration of existing network devices in the
service provider network. General-purpose tools reduce the staff required
to conﬁgure network devices and help to fasten the process to provision
new service requests. Automation also helps to reduce the chances of
154
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

misconﬁguration. Even if there is a misconﬁguration due to software bugs
in the conﬁguration tools, it is easy to ﬁx the bugs and ensure that all of
the devices are correctly conﬁgured.
6.3.4
Service Modiﬁcation
A typical service offered by a service provider will have several features.
Over a period of time, the customer will want to modify the service to in-
clude additional features or to upgrade the quality of the service. This may
require a change in the conﬁguration of the devices or the installation of
new devices. Consider the example shown in Figure 6.4. The customer is
offered a guaranteed bandwidth service. Initially, the customer was of-
fered a 512 Kb/sec ATM connection to the service provider network. Over
a period of time, the volume of trafﬁc from the customer has grown
steadily, so the requirements have increased to 2 Mb/sec. This requires
a change in the conﬁguration of all of the ATM switches and the CPE
device.
In the next phase, due to rapid expansion, the number of users in that
customer site increased dramatically. The volume of trafﬁc from this cus-
tomer site has outgrown the maximum link capacity on the CPE inter-
face. Now it is necessary to install new interfaces on the CPE device or
install a new CPE device. This upgrade in service requires installation of
new equipment and also modiﬁcations to the conﬁguration of the new
devices.
6.3.5
Database Information
Information about all of the devices in the network is necessary to man-
age the network. This information should be maintained in a database
and must be accessible to all of the systems that require them. It must be
correct and consistent. This is critical for the operation of the network, to
guarantee the services to the customer, and to meet the SLA requirements
of the customer. When new service requests are provisioned, it is neces-
sary to update the database information as part of the provisioning
process.
6.4 Network Management—What Are the Issues?
Network management is an integral part of any service offered by a service
provider. It encompasses several issues and is important for the service
provider to manage their network in order to ensure the correct operation
of all of the devices and services that are offered using the network. A typi-
cal service provider network has a wide geographic spread, covering sev-
eral cities. The network devices are installed in several locations and can
be far apart. It is necessary to have a good infrastructure to access and
6.4 Network Management—What Are the Issues?
155

manage these devices from a central location to reduce the cost of the net-
work management infrastructure. Security is another important aspect
that must also be taken into account when managing a network. The net-
work management system and the network devices must be shielded from
illegal access by intruders and hackers. Most service providers invest a lot
of time and money in building a solid and secure network management
infrastructure.
6.4.1
Network Management System
The network management system (NMS) is the crux of the network manage-
ment of a service provider network, providing the necessary infrastructure
to manage the network. It consists of both hardware and software that are
necessary to perform the network management activities (see Section
6.4.2). Several off-the-shelf NMSs are available today that provide a frame-
work to perform network management activities. The service provider
must modify or adapt them to meet their requirements. Considering the
fact that all service providers buy network devices and NMS solutions
from vendors, the competitive edge lies in adapting the network devices
and the NMS solutions to efﬁciently implement the services and deliver
SLAs to customers. Since the NMS plays a crucial role, it is important that
they have redundancy in case of failure. The design of the NMS infrastruc-
ture must take into account failure of components and must provide re-
dundancy for critical components.
6.4.2
Network Management Activities
Managing a service provider network involves several activities, including
1. Verifying the status of all devices
2. Recording and analyzing the error messages from all devices, to moni-
tor the health of all devices
3. Recording and analyzing statistical information, to monitor the health
of the devices
4. Recording and analyzing statistical information for SLA reporting
5. Maintaining and periodically verifying all the conﬁgurations on all
devices
6. Upgrading software and hardware to accommodate more customers or
to remove bugs
Monitoring Devices
Network devices must be up and functioning correctly in order to deliver
services to customers, so they must be monitored periodically. Monitoring
can be a proactive or a reactive activity, depending on the nature of the
devices. Proactive monitoring is important for critical devices. Reactive
monitoring can be done for devices whose failure can be anticipated based
156
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

on information received from other devices that do not affect the services
offered to the customer.
Proactive monitoring is not free. It requires bandwidth to send requests
and receive responses from devices, and it requires a good management
system to handle the volume of trafﬁc. The interval between each request
to monitor the status of devices is also an important factor: If the interval
is too high, then faulty devices may not be detected for a long time, and
this increases the downtime of the device and the service offered by the
device. Shorter intervals can help to overcome this problem, but they re-
sult in a lot of load on the device, the NMS system, and the network. A
good balance has to be maintained between the two choices. The opti-
mum interval for monitoring devices must be determined by the service
provider when designing the monitoring system.
The monitoring system must be designed to take into account service
windows during which devices may not be functioning (e.g., for software
or hardware upgrades). It must be capable of selectively turning off the
monitoring of devices that are being upgraded. The system must inform
the operator when devices do not respond to monitoring requests. It must
also be designed with the topology of the network and the physical and
logical relationship between devices in mind. Sometimes, the failure of a
single device may result in several other devices (connected to this device)
not being reached by the monitoring system. In this case, the monitoring
system must ﬁlter all of the alarms and forward a single alarm to the
operator.
Error Logs
Most network devices are capable of detecting failure of hardware or soft-
ware components. They can also anticipate such failures, depending on
the situation. For example, temperature sensors can be used to detect high
temperatures, and transmission errors on an interface can be used to de-
tect loss of connectivity. Network devices can be conﬁgured to send this
information (as alarms or error messages) to the NMS, which maintains it
in a log. This log information is then used by other systems to detect the
failure of components of devices or devices themselves, or even to antici-
pate failure and take corrective actions.
Error logs provide valuable information to the network operator in de-
tecting and troubleshooting problems in the network. For example, in-
creasing transmission errors on an ATM interface can be used to anticipate
degradation in the QoS offered to the customer, and investigations can be
initiated to determine the cause of this problem before complete loss of
connectivity on that interface.
Network management systems must be properly designed to ensure
that the network devices are conﬁgured to send critical error messages and
to verify that these error messages are logged and analyzed. Similar to the
6.4 Network Management—What Are the Issues?
157

problems associated with the monitoring interval, this must be designed
properly to ensure that critical errors are logged and detected and also that
the NMS is not ﬂooded with too many alarms or error messages.
Statistical Information
Network statistics play an important role in managing a network, deliver-
ing IP-based services, and reporting SLA to customers. Most network de-
vices collect and locally store statistical information in the device itself.
This information can be retrieved by the NMS and stored in a database to
be used at a later stage. (Section 6.4.3 provides more details about how the
statistical information is collected from the network devices.) Statistical
information can be used for several purposes, such as
1. Error detection and troubleshooting
2. SLA reporting
3. Capacity planning
Statistical information about errors observed by a network device can
be useful in detecting and even anticipating faults. Errors can also provide
useful information for troubleshooting. For example, the number of IP
packets received on an interface can help to detect if the interface is prop-
erly receiving and forwarding IP packets. During troubleshooting, this in-
formation can be very useful in isolating faulty interfaces.
Statistical information is also useful in reporting link utilization to cus-
tomers. It can be used to generate SLAs indicating the availability of the
service—for example, the availability of a service may be computed in
terms of the uptime of all the devices involved in delivering the service.
(Uptime can be considered the time the device has been up, or active,
since it was last reset.) Statistical information like link utilization or the
number of interfaces on a device can be useful in capacity planning.
When these values reach a certain threshold, it is time to install more in-
terfaces for a new device with additional interfaces.
Hardware and Software Upgrades
Technology grows at a very rapid rate, so it is necessary to upgrade the
hardware and software of network devices to keep up. Sometimes it is also
necessary to upgrade the software on devices in order to ﬁx problems. A
hardware upgrade may be required to meet the growing demand for a ser-
vice and to provision more customers.
Upgrading hardware and software is an important activity associated
with network management. Procedures must be deﬁned to do it so as to
reduce the downtime associated with the services and the downtime for
customers affected by the upgrade. Normally, an SLA has a provision for
downtime specifying a ﬁxed time. This is sometimes referred to as a service
158
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

window. As far as possible, hardware and software upgrades must be done
during the service window in order to minimize the service downtime.
6.4.3
How Is It Done?
As seen in this section, communication between the NMS and the net-
work devices is critical for managing the network. Without this communi-
cation, it is almost impossible to conﬁgure and monitor the devices, gen-
erate SLAs for customers, or predict the growth of the network and do
capacity planning. There are two aspects of the communication that are of
interest: (1) the communication protocol and the access method between
the NMS and the network device, and (2) the network that supports this
communication.
Communication Protocols and Access Methods
For an IP-based network, it is logical to use a communication protocol
based on IP for communication between the NMS and the network de-
vices. Most of the network devices from vendors support some form of IP-
based protocol to communicate with the network device. Depending on
the communication protocol, the access method can also vary. Some of
these methods have been standardized, and some of the most popular ac-
cess methods and the communication protocols used by these methods
are discussed in this section. Of course, there are also vendor-speciﬁc ac-
cess methods and communication protocols. Each method has its advan-
tages and disadvantages. Good NMS systems must incorporate all of these
methods and help the operator in efﬁciently performing the tasks of net-
work management.
SNMP
SNMP is the industry standard for communication between the NMS and
network devices. The operations supported by SNMP make it practical for
network monitoring and for the devices to report alarms to the NMS
system.
●
snmptrap is an operation supported by SNMP that makes it very use-
ful for devices to report unusual activities to the NMS. The SNMP
agent on the network device can be conﬁgured to report several
types of alarms. snmptrap provides information about the severity of
the trap, and additional information can be included in the trap to
indicate the nature of the fault and the possible cause of the prob-
lem. Some of these traps have been standardized, and there are also
device-speciﬁc and vendor-speciﬁc traps.
●
snmpget is an SNMP operation that can be used to access and extract
statistical information from a network device by the NMS.
6.4 Network Management—What Are the Issues?
159

●
snmpset is an SNMP operation that can be used to modify the value
of variables in the MIB of the network device. By using private MIB
variables, this operation can be used to modify the conﬁguration of
the network device.
All of these operations make it possible to perform most of the activities of
network management discussed in Section 6.4.2. SNMP requires IP con-
nectivity between network devices and the NMS.
Text-Based CLI
Text-based CLI is another method to access network devices and get the
required information to do some of the tasks associated with network
management. It can be used to get the status of a device, to get statistical
information, to modify the conﬁguration of devices, and so on. It can use
TCP-based protocols like telnet if the network device supports this
protocol.
Text-based CLI is a popular method for getting small amounts of infor-
mation—for example, interface status, conﬁguration details, and so on for
short-term activities like troubleshooting or quickly modifying the con-
ﬁguration of a device. An operator can use this method during trouble-
shooting to determine and isolate the cause of problems.
Text-based CLI may not scale for a network with a large number of de-
vices to perform certain activities of network management like collecting
statistical information. It can cause an unnecessary load on the devices
when trying to extract information on a periodic basis. It also requires
additional programs to process this information and save it in formats
that can be used by other systems (e.g., SLA reporting). Most of the off-
shelf NMSs use SNMP and provide some limited support for text-based
CLI.
Depending on the vender and their implementation, text-based CLI
may be able to provide more information than SNMP. Proprietary imple-
mentations of new technologies may not have the necessary MIBs to pro-
vide an SNMP interface. Under these circumstances, it may be necessary
to develop tools that can help to automate network management activi-
ties. Tools that can process and extract information from text-based re-
sponses are required to enable an operator to efﬁciently perform tasks.
Other Methods
Several other methods are available for getting information status about
network devices and also performing basic troubleshooting activities like
device reachability. These tools use some IP-based protocols to achieve
their tasks. For example, tools like ping use ICMP to determine the reach-
ability of devices, and tools like traceroute use ICMP to trace the path to
destination networks and network devices. These tools have to be adapted
to meet the requirements of the network management activity.
160
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

Communication Network
A network is required for communication between the NMS and the net-
work devices. It must support the protocol that is used for such communi-
cation. Two possible solutions are in-band network management and out-
band network management.
In-Band Network Management
“In-band” refers to using the service provider network to communicate
with all network devices. The links that forward customer trafﬁc are used
for communication between the NMS and the network devices. In-band
network management is a simple solution (see Figure 6.6). All it requires is
IP connectivity between the NMS and the service provider network. Once
this is established, then IP communication between the NMS and network
devices is very simple and straightforward.
6.4 Network Management—What Are the Issues?
161

The disadvantage of this approach is that failure in certain parts of the
service provider network may result in loss of connectivity between the
network device and the NMS. This may be critical at times when it is nec-
essary to have direct access to network devices. Moreover, this approach
requires additional bandwidth in the service provider network to accom-
modate the network management trafﬁc.
Out-Band Network Management
Out-band network management implements a separate network to pro-
vide communication between the NMS and the network devices (see Fig-
ure 6.7). This network is implemented separately from the service pro-
vider network (which is used for transporting customer trafﬁc) and is used
only for communication between the NMS and the network devices. The
advantage of this approach is that customer trafﬁc will not affect the
reachability between the NMS and the network device. Bandwidth need
not be reserved in the service provider network for the purpose of network
management.
6.4.4
Security Issues: Managing an IP Network
Security is an important issue that must be addressed when discussing the
management of IP networks. Networks are prone to attack by hackers, so
network devices and the NMS must be secured against intentional (or un-
intentional) intrusions. The NMS devices must be protected from external
intrusion. This can be achieved by using ﬁrewalls between the service pro-
vider network and the NMS system.
6.5 OSS Architecture
The OSS architecture plays an important role in implementing IP-based
services. Several key departments of both service providers and customers
use this system in order to implement services. The OSS maintains infor-
mation that is critical to service implementation and has the responsibil-
ity of ensuring that this information is made available promptly to the
various departments.
6.5.1
OSS Components
Some of the key components of this system are as follows.
Database System
A good database system is the key to OSS architecture. The OSS has a lot of
information that is relevant to service implementation and is also related
to the customer. The OSS must be capable of maintaining all of this

information and making it easily available to the different departments
and to various other components of the OSS that are responsible for ser-
vice implementation.
Network Provisioning and Monitoring Tools
Network provisioning and monitoring tools are also essential components
of the OSS architecture. They can be vendor-speciﬁc, standard tools that
are openly available, or even developed in-house. These tools interact
with the network devices and are responsible for conﬁguring the network
devices, monitoring the status of these devices, and extracting informa-
tion (e.g., link utilization) that is essential for SLA reporting and for bill-
ing. The OSS architecture must have the capability of seamlessly integrat-
ing all of these tools and ensuring that they can interact with other
components in order to get the correct information that is essential for
provisioning and monitoring the network devices.
SLA Reporting and Billing
SLA reporting and billing are important parts of service implementation.
They use the information related to customer requirements, services re-
quested by the customer, and the actual status of network elements re-
sponsible for delivering the services to the customer to generate periodic
reports to the customer. It is essential that SLA reporting and the billing
system have access to correct information.
6.5.2
Requirements of the OSS
Some of the requirements of the OSS architecture are that it be open, scal-
able, automated, and easy to interface between network operators in the
NOC and customers.
Open Architecture
The OSS has several components that must communicate with one an-
other in order to ease the task of service implementation. These compo-
nents may be purchased from several different software vendors. It is
essential that the OSS architecture allow the integration of all of these
components into one system and ensure that the information required by
a component for its proper functioning is readily made available to it.
Scalability
Scalability of the OSS refers to the ability to support a large number of ser-
vices and customers, to implement service requests from multiple custom-
ers within a short period of time, and to maintain information related to
several thousands of customers in order to implement the services. Service
164
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

providers typically have a large customer base (hundreds of thousands of
customers) and offer several services. It is essential that the OSS be capable
of supporting the implementation of services for all of the customers.
When there is surge in demand for a new service, several customers
may request this new service in a single day. This places a huge burden
on the OSS to implement all of the service requests. Scalability in this con-
text refers to the ability of the OSS to implement several service requests
within a short period of time.
As the number of customers using a service offered by the provider in-
creases, the OSS system must be capable of maintaining the information
about all of the customers. The time required to access the customer infor-
mation must not increase as the number of customers increases. This is es-
sential when online SLA reports are made available to customers. SLA re-
porting must have access to customer information (e.g., number of links
and the bandwidth for each customer link) and to the status of network
devices (e.g., link utilization) in order to make reports available to the cus-
tomer online.
Another aspect of scalability is related to the network provisioning and
monitoring tools. These tools must be capable of managing several net-
work devices. As the network grows, the number of network devices will
increase. The time taken to manage the network devices must be indepen-
dent of the number of devices managed by the OSS.
Automation
It is essential that the activities of implementing services are automated to
the maximum possible extent and that the intervention by human opera-
tors is minimized as much as possible. This is a key requirement because it
helps to minimize both the mistakes due to manual intervention and the
time taken to implement the services.
As discussed in the beginning of Section 6.3, provisioning involves up-
dating the conﬁguration of various network devices before the service can
be activated for a customer. Depending on the type of service and the SLA
offered to the customer, the amount of information required to provision
a service can be considerable. In order to ensure that all of this informa-
tion is correctly conﬁgured on the relevant devices, it is better to have
software tools that can automate this process. The software tools can ex-
tract this information from a database and consistently conﬁgure all rele-
vant devices in the correct order. The advantage of software tools is that if
they can correctly do a task once, they can do the same task correctly sev-
eral times. This is what is required in order to provision several customer
service requests in a short period of time and in a correct manner.
SNMP provides the basic means for communication between the NMS
and the network devices. The operations provided for by SNMP help to
extract information from network devices and allow the network devices
6.5 OSS Architecture
165

to report problems or events to the NMS. Software tools based on SNMP
can be used to automate the task of conﬁguring network devices.
As seen in Section 6.4.2, network management involves many activi-
ties, most of which are repetitive tasks that have to be performed periodi-
cally. Some of these tasks involve correlating large volumes of data in or-
der to verify the proper functioning of the network devices and also to
generate reports. Software tools are best suited for such tasks, as they can
do this much faster than human operators. Tools to periodically monitor
the devices are a must when the number of devices in the network is large.
Intelligent systems based on rules or models (e.g., ﬁnite-state machines;
Vijayananda 1996) can be easily built to scan through event logs from all
of the devices. The rules or models can vary based on the service offered
by the provider. Once these rules or models are deﬁned, then they can be
easily used to verify that the service offered to the customer is functioning
properly.
SLA reporting is another activity that can be automated. The informa-
tion required for generating the SLA reports must be made available to the
reporting system in order to automate this task. Once this is done, the re-
ports can be automatically generated, either periodically or on demand
(e.g., upon customer request).
Using Web-Based Tools
Web-based interfaces to applications are becoming more and more popu-
lar. Web applications are based on HTML and use IP-based application-
layer protocols like HTTP for communication with servers. Web-based
tools can help standardize the interface to conﬁgure and manage network
devices. With a few mouse clicks or keystrokes, an operator can easily
modify the conﬁguration of network devices and get information about
their status. The tools also make it easy to present SLA reports to custom-
ers or provide customers with online information about the status of their
service or other information (e.g., link utilization).
Web-based tools can help the service provider to allow online access to
SLA reports. This will make it easy for customers to get information about
their network. Information related to link utilization can help customers
in doing capacity planning and ordering more bandwidth for sites that
have very high link utilization.
6.6 Chapter Review
This chapter has stressed the need for simple and efﬁcient provisioning
and network management systems as a differentiator for the service pro-
vider. Good tools are required to simplify the task of provisioning new
customers, to manage services, and to deliver the SLA reports promised to
166
Chapter 6: IP-Based Service Implementation and Network Management

customers. A good OSS architecture is the key to rapid deployment of IP-
based services and to making it scalable.
SNMP plays a key role in managing IP networks. The features provided
by SNMP make the task of provisioning IP-based services and managing IP
networks easier for service providers. However, SNMP only provides the
basic means to communicate with the network device for the purpose of
network management. SNMP-based tools must be developed by the ser-
vice provider to perform network management activities in an efﬁcient
manner.

IP-Based Services:
Advanced Topics
Chapters 5 and 6 presented several discussions on network technologies
that help to create IP-based services and build IP networks by provid-
ing the basic infrastructure. While these technologies are very helpful in
building basic IP-based services, they may not be able to meet the require-
ments of all customers who make use of the IP network. Some customers
may have additional quality-of-service (QoS) requirements (other than
just connectivity), such as guaranteed bandwidth, guaranteed minimized
end-to-end delay and jitter, security, data privacy, and so on. With the
rapid emergence of modern applications like B2B, e-commerce, video-on-
demand, and voice-over-IP, the requirements listed above are important,
so there is more demand on IP-based networks to deliver the requirements
of these applications.
Applications like voice-over-IP and video are sensitive to delay and jit-
ter. Delay is the amount of time taken by the IP network to deliver a
packet from the source to the destination. Jitter is the variation in the
delay. Unlike traditional IP-based applications that depended on best-
effort services, voice-over-IP applications have strict delay and jitter re-
quirements. Packets from these applications must be delivered to the des-
tinations with a ﬁnite delay (about 150 milliseconds). Video applications
like videoconferencing and video-on-demand also have bandwidth re-
quirements in addition to delay and jitter requirements. They require
guaranteed end-to-end bandwidth, meaning that at any given time, the IP
169

network can guarantee a minimum throughput (measured in kilobits per
second) from source to destination.
Privacy and security of data are of special concern to customers like
banks and insurance companies. Privacy means that this data should not
be accessible to others, and security means that even if the network is in-
secure and the IP packets transporting the data are accessible, contents of
the packets must still be secure and not be compromised. These custom-
ers deal with sensitive data and are very concerned about the safety of
that data. Since the trafﬁc from these customers traverses the same IP
backbone of the service provider (see Chapter 5 for an explanation of this
subject), it is necessary to ensure that data privacy is maintained at any
given time. The security concerns of these customers are addressed in Sec-
tion 7.3.
There are also concerns about the address space limitations of IPv4.
Theoretically, IPv4 address spaces can support up to four billion devices.
Even though VPNs make it possible to reuse IP address space, there are
some people who feel that IPv4 may not be able to meet the current
growth in the number of IP devices. One of the main issues addressed in
IPv6 is the address-space limitation of IPv4.
Optical networking is another advanced topic. With the rapid emer-
gence of this technology and concepts like IP-over-optics, a discussion on
this topic is a must. We offer some insight into how it can help create IP-
based services.
This chapter provides details about these advanced topics, which can
help service providers to enhance and add new IP-based services to their
portfolios in order to meet the additional requirements of their customers.
The demand for QoS in an IP network is increasing every day. With the
rapid emergence of applications like voice-over-IP and video-on-demand,
the expectations of customers are also increasing. QoS and applications
like voice-over-IP are discussed in separate sections, followed by a dis-
cussion of IPv6. A discussion of the local-to-multipoint distribution system
(LMDS) is also included in this chapter to show how this technology can
be used by service providers to provide connectivity between customer
sites and the service provider PoP without using the local loop. Optical
networking is a quickly emerging technology; this chapter shows the syn-
ergy between IP and optical networking and discusses how optical net-
working can help service providers to create more services.
7.1 Quality of Service
The term quality of service, or QoS, can be used in a broad sense and, de-
pending on context, can have several meanings. QoS is normally under-
stood to indicate a set of service requirements that have to be met by a
network. QoS functions are intended to deliver the service requirements
that have been guaranteed by the network. This is achieved by giving the
170
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

network operator control over the usage of network resources, includ-
ing bandwidth, memory to store and forward packets, and CPUs. Some
of the techniques that can be used to satisfy QoS requirements are the
following:
●
Resource reservation at each node in the network. Reservation is done
according to policies implemented by the service provider based
on customer requirements. The reservation mechanism depends on
routing tables/routing protocols to ﬁnd the path with sufﬁcient re-
sources. This gives the operator control over the resources that are al-
located to customers.
●
Scheduling mechanisms to effectively allocate resources based on de-
mand. The scheduling mechanisms have to be implemented by the
service provider based on customer requirements.
●
A combination of resource reservation and scheduling mechanisms to
manage the network resources and meet the QoS requirements of
the customers.
Scheduling mechanisms are local to a network device. However, in or-
der to ensure the end-to-end QoS requirements (meaning that QoS is guar-
anteed along all the links and nodes, from the source node to the destina-
tion node), it is important that all of the nodes in the network have a
common agreement on how to implement the scheduling mechanisms.
Resource reservation also requires cooperation among all of the nodes in a
network. All of the nodes that are in the path from the source to the desti-
nation must implement the reservation policy. Resource reservation de-
pends on routing to ﬁnd out the path from the source to the destination
and reserve resources on all of the nodes.
QoS in an IP network is not an afterthought. Founders of IP had envi-
sioned the need for QoS and have provided for a ﬁeld called type of service
(ToS) in the IP header (see Figure 7.1) to facilitate QoS in IP networks.

Traditionally, IP networks offered best-effort services, meaning that the
only QoS offered was that packets might be eventually delivered to the
destination. Since the Internet was mostly used by applications like telnet
and ﬁle transfer, best-effort service was enough to meet the QoS require-
ments of these applications. The QoS requirements of the applications
that use the Internet today are much higher.
Internet QoS development has undergone a lot of standardization to
provide end-to-end QoS over the Internet. These standardization efforts
are concentrated in two areas:
●
Integrated services: Based on reserving the resources on all network
devices for each ﬂow, or connection, before data from the connection
is transported across the network. This requires a reservation proto-
col like RSVP to be understood by all network devices. (Section 7.1.2
provides more details about this activity.)
●
Differentiated services: Based on managing the resources on all net-
work devices for each ﬂow (based on some information, e.g., IP ad-
dress, ToS ﬁeld, or tags) as the data packets are transported through
the network. This requires implementing QoS functions like packet
classiﬁcation, policing, trafﬁc shaping, and the queuing mechanism
on each network device. (More details about differentiated services
can be found in Section 7.1.3.)
7.1.1
QoS Parameters
The QoS guarantees provided by the network are measured using the per-
formance of the network. Bandwidth, packet delay and jitter, and packet
loss are some common measures used to characterize a network’s perfor-
mance. The QoS requirements vary depending on the requirements of the
applications: for voice-over-IP or IP telephony, delay, packet loss, and jit-
ter are important; for applications that involve bulk data transfer, band-
width is a QoS requirement.
Bandwidth
The term bandwidth is used to describe the throughput of a given medium,
protocol, or connection. It describes the size of the pipe that is required
for the application to communicate over the network. An application re-
quiring guaranteed bandwidth wants the network to allocate a minimum
bandwidth speciﬁcally for it on all the links through which the data is
transferred through the network. Depending on the type of network, the
bandwidth guarantee can be provided at either the IP layer or the data-
link layer. Guaranteed bandwidth at the IP layer depends on the type of
datalink network. Not all datalink network support guarantees bandwidth
when several IP connections share the same network—for example, it is
172
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

not possible to reserve bandwidth in an Ethernet network with several
hosts.
Packet Delay and Jitter
Packet delay, or latency, at each hop consists of serialization or transmis-
sion delay, propagation delay, and switching delay.
●
Serialization or transmission delay: The time it takes for a device to
send the packet at the output rate. This depends on the size of the
packet and the link bandwidth. A 64-byte packet on a 4 Mb/sec
line takes 128 µs to be transmitted. The same 64-byte packet on a
128 Kb/sec line takes 4 ms to be transmitted.
●
Propagation delay: The time taken for a bit to be transmitted by the
transmitter and to be received by the receiver. This is a function of
the media and the distance and is independent of bandwidth.
●
Switching delay: The time taken for a device to start transmitting a
packet after receiving it. This depends on the status of the network
and the number of packets in transit at this hop.
End-to-end delay for a packet belonging to a ﬂow is the sum of all of
the above types of delays experienced at each hop. All packets in a ﬂow
need not experience the same delay—it depends on the transient delay in
each hop in the network. If the network is congested, queues will be built
at each hop, and this increases the end-to-end delay. This variation in the
delay is called jitter. Queuing mechanisms at each node can be used to en-
sure that the delay of certain ﬂows is minimized and also that the jitter
has an upper bound. (This is described in Section 7.1.4.)
Packet Loss
Packet loss speciﬁes the number of packets lost in the network during
transmission. The loss can be due to corruption in the transmission me-
dia, or packets can be dropped at congestion points due to lack of buffer
space in the incoming or outgoing interface. Packet loss due to drops
should be rare for a well-designed network that is correctly subscribed or
undersubscribed. Packet loss due to faulty transmission media can also be
avoided by building good physical networks.
QoS at Layer 2
Depending on the QoS requirements, QoS functions are available at the
datalink layer (Layer 2) and network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
Guaranteed bandwidth as a QoS requirement can be provided by sev-
eral Layer 2 technologies, such as frame relay or ATM, when the physical
medium is shared by several Layer 3 connections simultaneously. ATM
can also meet other QoS requirements like minimizing delay and jitter.

(The discussion on access technologies in Chapter 5 provides more details
about QoS functions available at the datalink layer.)
7.1.2
Integrated Services Model
The integrated services (IntServ) model is based on the concept of request-
ing resources along all the links in a network from the source to the desti-
nation. This reservation is done using protocols like the resource reservation
protocol (RSVP), a network-control protocol that enables Internet applica-
tions to obtain special QoS for their data ﬂows. RSVP is not a routing pro-
tocol; instead, it works in conjunction with routing protocols and installs
the equivalent of dynamic access lists along the routes that routing proto-
cols calculate. RSVP occupies the place of a transport protocol in the OSI-
model seven-layer protocol stack.
Researchers at the University of Southern California Information Sci-
ences Institute (ISI) and Xerox Palo Alto Research Center originally con-
ceived RSVP. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is now working
toward standardization through an RSVP working group (Braden et al.
1997; Wroclawski 1997). RSVP operational topics discussed later in this
chapter include data ﬂows, QoS, session start-up, reservation style, and
soft-state implementation.
How Does It Work?
IntServ using RSVP works in the following manner:
1. Applications signal their QoS requirements via RSVP to the network.
2. Every network node along the path must check to see if the reservation
request can be met.
3. Resources are reserved if the service constraints can be met.
4. An error message is sent back to the receiver if the constraints cannot
be met.
5. Network nodes make sure there are no violations of the trafﬁc contract.
6. Nonconforming packets are either marked down or dropped.
Some of the main drawbacks of the IntServ model are
●
It is an “all-or-nothing” model, meaning that it cannot be partially
deployed—every node in the network must implement it in order
for it to work.
●
The network needs to maintain each reservation for each ﬂow.
●
It is oriented for real-time trafﬁc.
●
Scalability: The number of RSVP reservations is directly proportional
to the number of IP streams that require resource reservation. This is-
sue is addressed by aggregating multiple RSVP reservations into one
174
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

reservation. Work is currently ongoing to provide aggregated RSVP
(Baker et al. 2001).
An example of an application that uses the IntServ model is voice-over-
IP, which makes use of RSVP to make path reservations before transport-
ing voice trafﬁc over a data network. For more details, see Section 7.2.3.
7.1.3
Differentiated Services Model
The differentiated services (DiffServ) approach to providing QoS in a net-
work is based on employing a well-deﬁned set of blocks with which one
can build a variety of services. It is based on the differentiated services code
point (DSCP) byte and ToS byte of the IP packet (Blake et al. 1998;
Heinanen et al. 1999; Jacobsen et al. 1999; Nichols et al. 1998). The
DiffServ architecture provides a framework within which service providers
can offer a wide range of services to customers, each service being differ-
entiated based on the DSCP ﬁeld in the IP packet. This value speciﬁes the
per-hop behavior (PHB) of the packet as it traverses the service provider
network.
Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
To allow trafﬁc to have different policies applied to it, some method of dif-
ferentiation of packets is required. Within the IP header is an eight-bit
ﬁeld known as type of service (ToS), within which three bits are used as pre-
cedence, allowing for 8 classes to be used. This ﬁeld has recently been
redeﬁned by the IETF as the differentiated services code point (DSCP) and
uses six bits of the ﬁeld, allowing for 64 different classes. Figure 7.2 shows
the details of the DSCP ﬁeld (and also the precedence ﬁeld) of the IP
header. In the case of DSCP, the currently unused bits are not used and are
reserved for future implementation.
MPLS has only three bits in the experimental (EXP) ﬁeld of the MPLS
(shim) header. The IP precedence bits (3 left-most bits of the TOS ﬁeld of
the IP header) are copied to the EXP ﬁeld of the MPLS header when the
MPLS header is appended to the packet. This effectively means that full
use of DSCP can only be made in links where MPLS is not enabled. All
other links in the network run MPLS, but only the ﬁrst three higher-order
bits of DSCP can be used to classify trafﬁc.
The limited number of bits in the MPLS header is not necessarily a
drawback of MPLS. MPLS is used in the core network. The DSCP ﬁeld
of the IP header is used to classify the customer trafﬁc. In the core net-
work, trafﬁc from several customers can be aggregated into a single class.
Typically, there are up to four classes in the core network: voice, priority,
guaranteed bandwidth, and best-effort. Since the MPLS packet encapsu-
lates the IP packet with the MPLS header, the DSCP ﬁeld in the IP is not
7.1 Quality of Service
175

lost and can be recovered at the edge of the network when the MPLS
header is stripped and the IP packet is forwarded to the customer.
DiffServ Architecture
All the nodes that follow the DiffServ model are in a DiffServ domain. All
the nodes on a Diffserv domain observe the PHB of a packet based on the
DSCP value. Figure 7.3 shows the DiffServ architecture and the two func-
tional building blocks, trafﬁc conditioners and PHB.
●
Trafﬁc conditioners are used to classify the IP packets by marking the
ToS or DSCP ﬁeld of the IP packet or the EXP bit of the MPLS packet.
Trafﬁc conditioners are applied when the trafﬁc enters the DiffServ
domain. These functions are implemented on the edge nodes of the
DiffServ domain. Packets are policed and marked based on the trafﬁc
proﬁle. The DSCP ﬁeld of the packets is also marked based on the
trafﬁc proﬁle. The trafﬁc conditioner used to police the packet may
drop the packets if they do not match the proﬁle or may shape the
trafﬁc when it does not meet the requirements of the proﬁle.
●
PHB functions must be implemented on all of the nodes in the
DiffServ domain. They allocate resources for the packets to be sched-
uled and transmitted out of each node and implement the drop pol-
icy when there is congestion.

DiffServ versus IntServ
The DiffServ model is more scalable than the IntServ model and has fewer
ﬂows than the IntServ model. However, this model requires that the trafﬁc
conditioners and PHB be implemented in the DiffServ domain. Provi-
sioning the services using the DiffServ model can be challenging because
the trafﬁc conditioners and PHB have to be correctly implemented on ev-
ery interface of all the nodes in the DiffServ domain. It can be a tedious
task to implement and verify the implementation on all of the nodes.
The IntServ model on top of the DiffServ model is an interesting con-
cept that can be used to take advantage of both models. While the
DiffServ model will make it scalable, the IntServ model will assure that re-
sources are made available to each ﬂow for which the IntServ model is
used.
7.1.4
IP QoS Implementation
IP QoS implementation can be divided into the following categories:
●
Classiﬁcation: This involves marking the IP packet (setting DSCP or
the IP precedence value) based on customer requirements. Once the
packets are correctly classiﬁed, they can be properly handled by the
other QoS mechanisms like congestion management and policing to
implement end-to-end QoS requirements. Packet classiﬁcation is
typically done on the edge of the network. Sometimes the service
provider reclassiﬁes packets in the core network by re-marking

certain ﬁelds in the packet. This reclassiﬁcation is required when
trafﬁc is aggregated, however, the service provider must ensure that
the original value of the IP precedence (DSCP) ﬁeld in the IP packet
is restored at the edge of the service provider network when the
packet is delivered to the customer. This can be done in an MPLS
network because two ﬁelds are available. The IP precedence ﬁeld
can be used to classify customer packets, and the MPLS EXP ﬁeld
can be used by the service provider to reclassify packets in the core
network.
●
Congestion management: This involves the creation of queues, assign-
ment of packets to the proper queues, and scheduling of queues and
the packets within the queues. The number of queues depends on
the customer requirements and the number of CoSs offered by the
service provider. Assignment of packets to queues and the schedul-
ing policies are determined by the service provider depending on
the type of QoS offered to the customer. For example, high-priority
trafﬁc like voice-over-IP requires preemptive queue mechanisms that
will ensure that the packets are scheduled and transmitted before
other packets.
●
Congestion avoidance techniques: Congestion avoidance is a preemp-
tive mechanism that monitors the network load and ensures that
there is no congestion in the network. Congestion avoidance is
achieved by dropping the packets; the packets that have to be
dropped are determined based on the drop policy. This depends on
the CoSs offered by the service provider. For example, during net-
work congestion, trafﬁc from the best-effort class should be dropped
ﬁrst. Trafﬁc from the guaranteed bandwidth class should not be
dropped before the minimum bandwidth has been guaranteed to
that class.
●
Policing and shaping mechanisms: These ensure that each CoS (based
on the marked IP packet) adheres to the service contract. The service
contract can include several issues, such as bandwidth, burst size,
and delay.
●
QoS signaling: This is used between nodes in the network to signal
the QoS requirements of each class and to reserve resources. RSVP
is a QoS signaling protocol that can be used to reserve resources
like bandwidth. QoS signaling mechanisms also depend on routing
protocols to determine the best path between the source and the
destination.
Implementing QoS in an IP network is a challenging task. It requires a
good understanding of queuing theory and the requirements of customers
in order to determine the parameters for the queuing policies. One chal-
lenge is the communication between the signaling plane (QoS signaling
protocols like RSVP) and the data-forwarding plane (congestion in the
178
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

network) to ensure that the resource reservation for an application can
be done in the correct manner. For example, RSVP uses bandwidth as the
resource in order to do reservations. In addition to bandwidth, other net-
work resources like queue buffers on the network devices are also impor-
tant resources that are required to guarantee QoS. Congestion in the net-
work device due to lack of queue buffers must be communicated to RSVP
so that RSVP can use alternate paths (between the source and the destina-
tion) that have enough network resources (e.g., bandwidth, queue buffers)
to meet the QoS requirements of the application making the RSVP re-
quest. More details about QoS implementations in an IP network can be
found in Vegesna 2001.
7.1.5
Creating New Services Using QoS
Applications like voice-over-IP have strict QoS requirements regarding de-
lay, jitter, and bandwidth. Real-time applications like video-on-demand
also have QoS requirements that cannot be met by the best-effort services
offered by a traditional IP network. By enabling QoS in the IP network (ei-
ther by using the DiffServ model, the IntServ model, or both), service
providers can offer differentiated services or guaranteed services (or both)
to their customers. This will also enable them to offer new services like
voice-over-IP and use the last mile, or local loop, to implement telephony
services.
Differentiated services (offered using the DiffServ model) can help the
service provider to distinguish between business customers (who pay
more money for the services) and customers who are satisﬁed with best-
effort services. By offering better QoS to the business customers—by allo-
cating sufﬁcient bandwidth and ensuring that the trafﬁc from the busi-
ness customer gets forwarded preferentially over the best-effort customer
in case of congestion—the service provider can have oversubscription in
their network and still meet the QoS requirements of all of their
customers.
A QoS-enabled network will also help the service provider to offer addi-
tional services like guaranteed bandwidth to a customer. Applications like
video-on-demand and videoconferencing have bandwidth requirements.
By ensuring guaranteed bandwidth to customers, the service provider as-
sures customers that their network is capable of meeting the bandwidth
requirements of the customer’s applications.
QoS implementation helps the service provider to offer bundled ser-
vices, like voice, video, and data, on a single physical link. This requires
QoS implementation on a link between the customer premises and the
service provider PoP to differentiate between the voice, video, and data
trafﬁc. Cable, ADSL, frame relay, ATM, and Ethernet are examples of ac-
cess technologies with which the service provider can offer bundled
services.
7.1 Quality of Service
179

7.2 Voice-over-IP
Of the key emerging technologies for data, voice, and video integration,
voice-over-IP (VoIP) is arguably very important. The most QoS-sensitive of
all trafﬁc, voice is the true test of the engineering and quality of a net-
work. Demand for voice-over-IP is leading the movement for QoS in IP en-
vironments, and will ultimately lead to use of the Internet for fax, voice
telephony, and video telephony services. Voice-over-IP will ultimately be
a key component of the migration of telephony to the LAN infrastructure.
7.2.1
Requirements
Voice trafﬁc is sensitive to delay and delay variations. Communication be-
tween gateways must be reliable and be delivered on time. In an IP net-
work, reliable packet delivery can be assured by using robust transport and
session protocols. However, routers and speciﬁcally IP networks offer
some unique challenges in controlling delay and delay variation (see Sec-
tion 7.1.4 for more details).
Traditionally, IP trafﬁc has been treated as best-effort, meaning that in-
coming IP trafﬁc is transmitted on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis. Packets
have been variable in nature, allowing large ﬁle transfers to take advan-
tage of the efﬁciency associated with larger packet sizes. These characteris-
tics have contributed to large delays and large delay variations in packet
delivery. The second part of supporting delay-sensitive voice trafﬁc is to
provide a means of prioritizing the trafﬁc within the router network in or-
der to minimize the delay and delay variation. Section 7.1 provides details
about assuring QoS in an IP network.
7.2.2
Components
In this section, we brieﬂy introduce the components that are involved in
delivering voice trafﬁc over a data network:
●
Packet voice network: Responsible for converting the voice trafﬁc into
data packets and delivering the voice trafﬁc over a data network
●
Protocols like H.323 and session initiation (SIP): Help to provide multi-
media communication (voice, video, and data) over a data network
and operate with the traditional voice networks
Packet Voice Network
All packet voice systems follow a common model, as shown in Figure 7.4.
The packet voice transport network, which may be IP-based, frame re-
lay, or ATM, forms the traditional cloud. At the edges of this network
are devices, or components, called voice agents or gateways. It is the mis-
sion of these devices to change the voice information from its traditional
180
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

telephony form to a form suitable for packet transmission. The network
then forwards the packet data to a gateway serving as the destination, or
called party. This voice-agent connection model demonstrates the two is-
sues in packet voice networking that must be explored to ensure that
packet voice services meet user needs.
The ﬁrst issue is voice coding: how voice information is transformed
into packets and how the packets are used to re-create the voice. Voice
has to be transformed into digital signals before it can be transported over
a packet network. At the other end of the packet network, the digital sig-
nal has to be reconverted into voice signals. Special devices are used to
convert voice to a digital signal and then back to voice. These devices are
called coder-decoders (CODECs).
The second issue is the signaling associated with identifying the calling
party and ascertaining where the called party is in the network. Two sig-
naling protocols, H.323 and SIP, are discussed below.
Voice Coding
Analog communication is ideal for human communication. However, an-
alog transmission is neither robust nor efﬁcient at recovering from line
noise. Analog signals have to be digitized before they can be transported
over a packet voice network. Digital samples are composed of one and
zero bits, and it is much easier for them to be separated from line noise.
Therefore, when signals are regenerated, a clean sound can be maintained.
When the beneﬁts of this digital representation became evident, the tele-
phony network migrated to pulse code modulation (PCM).
PCM converts analog sound into digital form by sampling the analog
sound 8000 times per second and converting each sample into a numeric
code. After the waveform is sampled, it is converted into a discrete digital

form. This sample is represented by a code that indicates the amplitude of
the waveform at the instant the sample was taken. The telephony form of
PCM uses 8 bits for the code and a logarithm compression method that as-
signs more bits to lower-amplitude signals. The transmission rate is ob-
tained by multiplying 8000 samples per second by 8 bits per sample, giv-
ing 64,000 bits per second, the standard transmission rate for one channel
of telephone digital communications.
Two basic variations of 64 Kb/sec PCM are commonly used: MU-law
and A-law. The methods are similar in that they both use logarithmic
compression to achieve 12 to 13 bits of linear PCM quality in 8 bits, but
are different in relatively minor compression details (e.g., MU-law has a
slight advantage in low-level signal-to-noise ratio performance). Usage
has historically been along country and regional boundaries, with North
America using MU-law and Europe using A-law modulation. It is impor-
tant to note that when making a long-distance call, any required MU-law
to A-law conversion is the responsibility of the MU-law country.
Another compression method often used is adaptive differential pulse
code modulation (ADPCM). A commonly used instance of ADPCM, ITU-T
G.726 encodes using 4-bit samples, giving a transmission rate of 32 Kb/
sec. Unlike PCM, the 4 bits in ADPCM do not directly encode the ampli-
tude of speech but the differences in amplitude as well as the rate of
change of that amplitude, employing some very rudimentary linear
predictions.
The most popular voice-coding standards for telephony and packet
voice include
●
G.711: Describes the 64 Kb/sec PCM voice-coding technique out-
lined earlier. G.711-encoded voice is already in the correct format for
digital voice delivery in a public phone network or through PBXs.
●
G.726: Describes ADPCM coding at 40, 32, 24, and 16 Kb/sec;
ADPCM voice may also be interchanged between packet voice and
public phone or PBX networks, provided that the latter has ADPCM
capability.
●
G.728: Describes a 16 Kb/sec low-delay variation of code-excited lin-
ear prediction (CELP) voice compression. CELP voice coding must be
transcoded to a public telephony format for delivery to or through
telephone networks.
●
G.729: Describes CELP compression that enables voice to be coded
into 8 Kb/sec streams. Two variations of this standard (G.729 and
G.729 Annex A) differ largely in computational complexity, and
both generally provide speech quality as good as that of 32 Kb/sec
ADPCM.
●
G.723.1: Describes a technique that can be used for compressing
speech or other audio signal components of multimedia service at a
very low bit rate.
182
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

More details about voice-coding techniques and standards can be found
in Davidson and Peters 2000.
H.323
H.323 is the standard that has been developed for multimedia communi-
cation over a LAN or network that does not provide guaranteed QoS. The
accepted model for internal signaling for IP packet voice networks is the
H.323 standard. While H.323 is popularly viewed as a packet video stan-
dard, it actually deﬁnes a set of multimedia communications standards
between users. In fact, only voice services are required for H.323 participa-
tion; video and data support are optional.
H.323 deﬁnes a complete multimedia network, from devices to proto-
cols. Linking all of the entities within H.323 is H.245, which is deﬁned to
negotiate facilities among participants and H.323 network elements. A
scaled-down version of ISDN’s Q.931 call protocol is used to provide for
connection setup. Figure 7.5 shows the components of H.323. In H.323
terms, the voice agents are terminals, although the common usage of this
concept suggests a single user. H.323 also deﬁnes a gatekeeper function that
performs the address translation and also mapping between a telephone
number and the IP address of the remote gateways. If the network in a
packet voice application is actually made up of several different kinds of
transport networks, H.323 deﬁnes a gateway function between networks
that performs the packet data format translation and signaling translation

required for proper communications across the network boundary. The
most common use of this gateway is the conversion of videoconferencing
from H.320 to H.323 format, permitting packet video users to communi-
cate with traditional room- or cart-based video systems that rely on the
circuit-switched form of video. More details about H.323 can be found in
Davidson and Peters 2000.
Session Initiation Protocol
The session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control pro-
tocol that can establish, modify, and terminate multimedia sessions or
calls. These multimedia sessions include multimedia conferences, dis-
tance learning, Internet telephony, and similar applications. SIP is deﬁned
in RFC 2543.
SIP is a peer-to-peer protocol where end devices (user agents, or UAs) ini-
tiate sessions. The two components of an SIP system are UAs and network
servers. Calling and called parties are identiﬁed by an SIP address. (Figure
7.6 shows the SIP components.) UAs are client end-system applications
that contain both the user-agent client (UAC) and a user-agent server (UAS),
otherwise known as a client and server. The client initiates the SIP request
and acts as the calling party. The server receives the request and returns
the response on behalf of the user and acts as the called party. Examples of
UAs include SIP phones, gateways, PDAs, and robots.

Network servers are optional components in the context of SIP. There
are three types of servers: proxy server, redirect server, and location server.
●
Proxy server: Acts on behalf of the UA and forwards the SIP messages
to the other UAs after modifying the header. Rewriting the header
identiﬁes the proxy server as the initiator of the request and ensures
that the response follows the same path back to the proxy server.
●
Redirect server: Accepts SIP requests from the UA and sends a redirect
response back to the UA with the address of the next server or the
calling party. Redirect servers do not accept calls, nor do they for-
ward or process SIP requests.
●
Location server: Maintains the SIP address of UA devices. The redirect
server and the proxy server use the location server to locate the
called UA.
SIP addresses, also called SIP universal resource locators (URLs), exist in
the form of users@host. The user portion can be a name or telephone num-
ber, and the host portion can be a domain name or network address. The
following examples depict two possible SIP URLs:
sip:vijay@vijay.com
sip:0012012012222@10.10.10.10
Figure 7.7 shows a call setup using a proxy server. A UA can send an SIP
request directly to the local proxy server or to the IP address and port cor-
responding to the called party (e.g., vijay@10.10.10.10). Sending it to a
proxy server is relatively easy because the calling UA does not have to
know the exact URL of the called UA.
7.2.3
How Does Voice-over-IP Work?
The general steps to connect a packet voice telephone call through a
voice-over-IP router are described in the example below. This example is
not a speciﬁc call ﬂow, but it gives a high-level view of what happens
when you make a phone call work over a packet voice network. The gen-
eral ﬂow of a two-party voice call is the same in all cases:
1. The user picks up the handset, signaling an off-hook condition to
whatever the local loop is connected to (e.g., PBX, PSTN central ofﬁce
switch, signaling application in the router).
2. The session application issues a dial tone and waits for the user to dial a
phone number.
3. The user dials the number, which is accumulated by the session
application.
7.2 Voice-over-IP
185

4. The number is mapped via the dial plan mapper to an IP host (by send-
ing a request to the gatekeeper), which talks either to the destination
phone directly or to a PBX, which ﬁnishes completing the call.
5. The session applications run a session protocol (e.g., H.323) to estab-
lish a transmission and a reception channel for each direction over the
IP network. Meanwhile, if there is a PBX involved at the called end, it
ﬁnishes completing the call to the destination phone.
6. If using RSVP, the RSVP reservations are put in place to achieve the de-
sired QoS over the IP network.
7. The voice CODECs/compressors/decompressors are turned on for both
ends, and the conversation proceeds using IP as the protocol stack.
8. Any call progress indications and other signals that can be carried in-
band (e.g., remote phone ringing, line busy) are cut through the voice
path as soon as an end-to-end audio channel is up.
9. When either end hangs up, the RSVP reservations are torn down (if
RSVP is used), and the session ends, with each end going idle waiting
for another off-hook.
When the dial plan mapper determines the necessary IP address to
reach the destination telephone number, a session is invoked. H.323 is the
current session application. Figure 7.8 shows a breakdown of the steps
taken to form the H.323 session. The initial TCP connection is usually
made on port 1720 to negotiate the H.225 portion of the H.323 session.
During this portion, the TCP port number for the H.245 portion of the
H.323 session is passed back to the calling unit.

During the H.245 portion of the H.323 session, the RTP and RTCP ad-

nels available on the calling device. After all portions of the H.225 and

Services Using Voice-over-IP
This section presents a discussion on how voice-over-IP can help a service
provider in creating new services and reducing operational costs. By offer-
ing voice and data services over a single network, service providers can re-
duce the costs of managing two networks. Voice-over-IP can also help ser-
vice providers to augment their portfolio with add-on services that will
provide customers with single network connectivity for both voice and
data services.
Merging Voice and Data Networks
Voice over a packet network uses less transmission bandwidth than con-
ventional voice because the digitized signal is compressed before it is

transmitted. This allows more trafﬁc to be carried on a given connection
in a packet network as compared to a conventional voice network. Where
telephony requires as many as 64,000 bits per second, packet voice often
needs fewer than 10,000. For many companies, there is sufﬁcient reserve
capacity on national and international data networks to transport consid-
erable voice trafﬁc, making voice essentially “free.” A packet/data network
can deliver voice trafﬁc using less bandwidth. Given a certain amount of
bandwidth, more voice trafﬁc can be transported using an IP network
compared to a voice network.
Voice-over-IP is an excellent solution that can help to carry both voice
and data trafﬁc using the same IP network (see Figure 7.9). An IP network
connects two remote sites, Site A and Site B. Voice (telephone) and data
applications are connected to the router at each site. The router is also
the gateway for the voice-over-IP application. X1234 and X5678 are the
telephone numbers of Site A and Site B, respectively. The IP network trans-
ports both voice and data packets. The same network connection between
Site A and Site B is used to transport both voice and data trafﬁc. Merging
voice and data onto one network can help reduce the cost of maintaining
two networks both in terms of infrastructure and the stafﬁng required to
maintain the networks. The challenge lies in ensuring that the IP network
can guarantee the quality required for delivering voice trafﬁc. (Section 7.1
provided details about how to overcome some of these challenges.)
Toll Bypass
Toll bypass will be the most common application that corporations will
look toward for deploying voice-over-IP networks. It allows corporations
to replace the tie lines that currently hook up their PBX-to-PBX networks
and route voice calls across their existing data infrastructures (see Fig-
ure 7.10). Corporations will also use voice-over-IP to replace smaller key
systems at remote ofﬁces while maintaining larger-density voice-over-IP

voice-over-IP is that real-time fax relay can be used on an interofﬁce basis,
an advantage since a large portion of long-distance minutes is fax trafﬁc.
7.3 IP Security
IP security (known as IPSec) provides interoperable, high-quality, crypto-
graphically based security for IPv4 and IPv6. The security services offered
by IPSec include
Access controls (connectionless integrity ensuring data is transmitted
without alteration)
Data origin authentication (knowing received data is the same as sent
data and who sent the data)
Protection against replays and partial sequence integrity
Conﬁdentiality (encryption)
Limited trafﬁc ﬂow conﬁdentiality
One of the most common ways of breaching the security of a network
is to capture some genuine data and then play it back to gain access.
Therefore, IPSec provides a means of securing against this data capture
and replay. While it is good to know whether data has been tampered
with, a priority for most customers is that they do not want their data read
by unwanted parties. The most common way of preventing the wrong
people from reading data is encryption. This not only protects data but
also provides limited trafﬁc ﬂow conﬁdentiality, as it can hide the identi-
ties of the sender and receiver.
The IPSec protocol suite comprises a set of standards that are used to
provide privacy and authentication services at the IP layer. The current
IPSec standards include three algorithm-independent base speciﬁcations
that are currently standards-track RFCs. These three RFCs, listed below, are

7.3.1
Concepts and Terminologies
This section introduces the concepts and terminologies related to IPSec.
The fundamental concepts are authentication, encryption, key manage-
ment, and security association.
Authentication
Authentication, in IPSec terms, is knowing that we trust the “person” that
has sent us the data, that the data has not been altered in transit, and also,
but to a lesser extent, being able to prove that the data was sent. This can
be achieved by using a hashing algorithm: The sender takes the data and
a key (a password of sorts) and hashes these together. The answer, which
is always the same length for that particular key and hashing algorithm,
is known as a message authentication code. IPSec refers to the message au-
thentication code as the integrity check value (ICV). The message authenti-
cation code and the data are sent to the receiver. The receiver takes the
data, the key, and the hashing algorithm and performs the same calcula-
tion as the sender. The receiver compares his or her answer, that is, the
message authentication code, with that sent by the user. If the answers
match, the receiver knows that the data has not been altered (or the
190
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

answer would be different) and knows who sent the data (the person who
knows the same key).
Encryption
Encryption is the transformation of a clear text message into an unread-
able form to hide its meaning. The opposite transformation, retrieving the
clear text message, is decryption. The keys are often symmetric—that is,
the same key is used for encryption and decryption. The most common
encryption algorithm is the data encryption standard (DES). DES is a block
encryption algorithm: it takes the data and encrypts it in blocks of bits.
The blocks of data are 64 bits and the most common key lengths are 56 or
168 (triple DES, or 3DES). With DES, the 56-bit key is often expressed as a
64-bit number, with every eighth bit used for parity. From the key, 16
subkeys are derived that are used in 16 rounds of the algorithm. The ci-
pher text is always the same length as the clear text.
Key Exchange
Both authentication and encryption are based on the use of keys. A key is
a bit pattern that is used to encrypt messages. The length of the key de-
pends on the encryption technique. The key is used by the sender, who
encrypts the message with it, and by the receiver, who decrypts the mes-
sage with it. Therefore, the key has to be exchanged between the sender
and the receiver.
The IPSec protocol suite also includes cryptographic techniques to sup-
port the key management requirements of the network-layer security.
ISAKMP provides the framework for Internet key management and the
speciﬁc protocol support for negotiation of security attributes. By itself, it
does not establish session keys; however, it can be used with various ses-
sion key establishment protocols, such as Oakley, to provide a complete
solution to Internet key management.
The Oakley key-determination protocol provides the important secu-
rity property of perfect forward secrecy and is based on cryptographic tech-
niques that have survived substantial public scrutiny. Perfect forward se-
crecy ensures that if any single key is compromised, only the data
encrypted with that particular key will be compromised; it will not com-
promise any data encrypted with subsequent session keys.
The ISAKMP and Oakley protocols have been combined into a hybrid
protocol. The resolution of ISAKMP with Oakley uses the framework of
ISAKMP to support a subset of Oakley key-exchange modes. This new key-
exchange protocol provides optional perfect forward secrecy and full secu-
rity association attribute negotiation, as well as authentication methods
that provide both repudiation and nonrepudiation. Implementations of
this protocol can be used, for example, to establish VPNs and also to allow
7.3 IP Security

users from remote sites (who may have a dynamically allocated IP address)
access to a secure network.
Authentication Header
An authentication header (AH) provides an authentication and integrity
mechanism for IP trafﬁc. Figure 7.11 shows the ﬁelds of the AH. The pre-
ceding IP header will contain a protocol value of 51. The next header ﬁeld
identiﬁes the type of the next payload. The value speciﬁed is one of the IP
protocol numbers, as deﬁned in the most recent assigned numbers (cur-
rently RFC 1700).
The payload length is the length of the header in 32-bit words minus 2.
The reserved ﬁeld is always set to zero. The security parameter index (SPI)
is 32 bits long, and the value is determined when the security association
(SA) is established. The sequence number is also 32 bits long and is always
present, even if antireplay is not enabled. The sequence number is set to
zero when the SA is established and will never cycle if antireplay is en-
abled. The size of the authentication data ﬁeld contains the message au-
thentication code—which in IPSec terminology is the ICV. It must be a
multiple of 32 bits, and padding can be added if needed.
An extra header (AH) is inserted onto the IP header (see Figure 7.12).
HMAC (keyed hashing for message authentication) algorithms like SHA
(secure hash algorithm) or MDS is used to generate the AH. This header is
generated using the entire IP packet and a secret key. Fields of the IP
packet that get modiﬁed in transit (TTL, ToS, header checksum, ﬂags) are
not used in generating the AH. This header is used to verify that the con-
tent of the IP packet has not been modiﬁed.
Although IPSec is connectionless, it uses a sequence number to detect
duplicate packets in order to provide protection against denial-of-service
(DoS) attack. This mechanism is referred to as antireplay because it pre-
vents packets from being duplicated and retransmitted by hackers as a
part of DoS attack. The sequence number in the AH is used to detect

duplicate packets. AH does not ensure the conﬁdentiality of the payload
of the IP packet. This means that AH does not encrypt the payload.
Encapsulated Security Payload
The encapsulated security payload (ESP) encrypts the entire payload of
the IP packet using DES or 3DES in order to provide conﬁdentiality for
the payload of the IP packet. As shown in Figure 7.13, the ESP header is
inserted between the IP header and the encrypted payload to generate
the encrypted IP packet. It also provides for an optional authentication/
integrity mechanism for the payload. ESP can be used by itself or in con-
junction with AH. ESP is deﬁned in RFC 2406.

Figure 7.12 Generating an authentication header for an IP packet.

Figure 7.14 shows the details of the ESP header. The IP header contains
a protocol value equal to 50 to indicate that the IP packet has an ESP
header. (The SPI and sequence numbers have been discussed in the pre-
ceding section.)
There are three different reasons why padding may be added: The ﬁrst
is that the encryption algorithm may require the data to be multiples of
numbers of bytes. The second is that the pad length and next header ﬁelds
must be right-aligned within the 4-byte words. The last, and sometimes
surprising reason, is to hide the size of the packet. The standard deﬁnes
that a user may add between 0 and 255 bytes of padding. The pad length is
the number of bytes of padding preceding this ﬁeld. This ﬁeld is always
present, so if no padding is added, the ﬁeld will be zero. The authentica-
tion data ﬁeld is present if the security association demands authentica-
tion, and its length is dependent on the authentication algorithm used.
Security Association
The concept of security associations (SAs) is fundamental to IPSec. An SA
is a connection that provides security to the trafﬁc that it carries. The se-
curity is either AH or ESP, but not both. An SA applies in one direction
only, so for security for both inbound and outbound trafﬁc, two SAs will
be established. If both AH and ESP are required for a particular connec-
tion, an SA bundle will be established. An SA is identiﬁed by three parame-
ters: a destination IP address, the security protocol (AH or ESP), and the
SPI. The SPI is a 32-bit number that is used to uniquely identify the partic-
ular SA. Numbers 1 to 255 are currently reserved by the IANA for future
expansion.

There are two main types of SAs: transport mode and tunnel mode (see
Figure 7.15). In a transport mode SA, the source and destination of the IP
packet also do the IPSec processing. In this case, each end station would
have a stack that was IPSec capable and the trafﬁc would be secured end to
end. If one or more of the devices is a security gateway—for example, a
router—the SA is in tunnel mode. In this scenario, the IPSec processing is
not done by either the source or the destination of the IP packet. In Figure
7.15, the IP packets would only be secured between the two routers. Some-
times people refer to the routers as “acting as a proxy”—they are provid-
ing security for clients who are unable to provide security for themselves,
or providing security in addition to that provided by the clients.
It is important to realize that a particular IP packet may experience
both types of SAs in the path between source and destination. For exam-
ple, the sending station may use ESP to encrypt the packet. The sending
station would establish an SA in transport mode. The forwarding router
may then apply AH security to that packet using an SA that is in tunnel
mode.
So what is the difference between tunnel and transport mode, other
than the device that performs the IPSec processing? The main difference is
that in transport mode, the security is applied to upper protocol levels,
whereas in tunnel mode, the security is applied to the entire IP packet.
Figures 7.16 and 7.17 show the difference in the packets generated by tun-
nel mode and transport mode.
7.3.2
How Does IPSec Work?
The IPSec standard will enable interoperable, secure, and authenticated
data ﬂow at the IP level for interchangeable devices, including hosts, ﬁre-
wall products, and routers. The following example illustrates how IPSec is
used to provide for authenticated, conﬁdential data communication be-
tween the remote router and campus ﬁrewall, shown in Figure 7.18. All

trafﬁc from the remote router destined to the campus ﬁrewall must be au-

ﬁrst agree on a security association, which is an agreement between the
two on a security policy. The SA includes

An SA is unidirectional, so for two-way communication, two SAs must

but this leaves room for asymmetrical policies in either direction. These
SAs are negotiated via ISAKMP, or they can be deﬁned manually. After the
SA is negotiated, it is then determined whether to use authentication,
conﬁdentiality, and integrity or simply authentication. If only authentica-
tion is desired, the current standard speciﬁes the use of a hashing func-
tion. Speciﬁcally, implementations must use at least the MD5 algorithm
with 128-bit keys. The packet header and data are run through the hash-
ing function, and the results of the hash computation are inserted into
the speciﬁed ﬁeld in the AH.
Note that for IPv4, the following ﬁelds are set to zero:
Type of service (ToS)
Time to live (TTL)
Header checksum
Offset
Flags
The new packet, with the authentication header between the IP header
and data, is now sent through the router to the campus destination.
When the ﬁrewall receives the packet, it veriﬁes the authenticity of
the packet by recomputing the hash with the hashing function speciﬁed
in the SA. The hashing function must be the same on both sides. As
shown in Figure 7.18, the ﬁrewall then compares its computed hash with
the parameter found in the ﬁeld in the AH, and if they match, it is assured
of authentication and integrity (i.e., that the packet came from the re-
mote router and no bits have been modiﬁed). Note that since the original
packet is expanded because of the insertion of the AH, fragmentation may
be required. Fragmentation occurs after the AH for outgoing packets and
before the AH for incoming packets.
If there is also a requirement for conﬁdentiality, then the SA speciﬁes
that all trafﬁc from the remote router destined to the campus ﬁrewall
must be authenticated and encrypted before passing trafﬁc through. The
ESP provides authentication, integrity, and conﬁdentiality. Note that
since the original packet is expanded because of the insertion of the AH,

fragmentation may be required. Fragmentation occurs after ESP for outgo-
ing packets and before ESP for incoming packets.
7.3.3
Advantages
The advantages of IPSec network-layer security include the following:
●
It can support completely unmodiﬁed end systems, though in this
case, encryption is no longer strictly end to end.
●
It is particularly suitable for building VPNs across nontrusted
networks.
●
It can support transport protocols other than TCP (e.g., UDP).
●
It hides the transport-layer headers from eavesdropping, providing
somewhat greater protection against trafﬁc analysis.
●
With AH and replay detection, it protects against certain DoS attacks
based on swamping (e.g., TCP synchronization attacks).
7.3.4
IPSec versus MPLS-VPN
After reading this section on IPSec, some questions may arise:
1. How do the VPNs created using IPSec differ from the MPLS-VPNs?
2. Is there any need for MPLS-VPNs if VPNs can be created using IPSec?
3. What additional beneﬁts does IPSec bring to the table?
The VPNs created by IPSec and MPLS-VPNs are quite different. MPLS-
VPN creates VPNs at the network layer by using special routing protocols
that help to distinguish between different networks and by using packet-
forwarding mechanisms based on labels to forward packets only within
the VPN. The mechanisms used by MPLS-VPNs are scalable and can be
used to create and maintain several VPNs. The MPLS-VPN solution is scal-
able because there is no need to build and maintain point-to-point tun-
nels between the different sites of the VPN. The number of labels required
to build a VPN is directly proportional to the number of sites (or the total
number of network addresses within a VPN).
IPSec forms VPNs by creating associations between hosts and other net-
work entities that belong to the same VPN and ensuring that communica-
tion is possible only between network elements that are part of the associ-
ation. The solution provided by IPSec is not scalable for a large number of
VPNs because one needs to form associations between the different enti-
ties belonging to a VPN and the complexity of the number of associations
is O(N2), where N is the number of hosts belonging to a VPN. The advan-
tage of IPSec lies in the additional security mechanisms. IPSec can supple-
ment the security by means of authentication and encryption.
IPSec and MPLS-VPN are not two competing technologies, but they
supplement each other so as to overcome the disadvantages of each other.
IPSec on top of an MPLS-VPN provides a solution that is more secure (with
198
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

the additional security provided by IPSec) and also scalable (by using
MPLS-VPN). IPSec can be used to strengthen the security of the network
and also to protect the integrity and conﬁdentiality of the data that is
transported across the IP network.
7.4 IPv6
The current version of IP is version 4, which uses 32 bits for its address.
Therefore, theoretically, the IPv4 addressing scheme supports up to four
billion hosts (232 because the IPv4 address has 32 bits). Today, half of this
address space has been used. Public IP addresses are distributed by agen-
cies like the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) and Réseaux IP
Européens (RIPE). In order to overcome the address space limitation, con-
cepts like network address translation (NAT) were developed in the early
stages. This proved to be a practical solution. However, it has its limita-
tions; some of the issues related to NAT are scalability and lack of transpar-
ency when it comes to developing differentiated services based on IP ad-
dresses. Given the ubiquity of IP and the rapid proliferation of devices
with IP addresses (see Figure 7.19), there arose a need to redesign the ad-
dressing scheme of IP.
In the early 1990s, work started on the next-generation IP (IPng, cur-
rently known as IPv6) to address the issues related to the addressing limi-
tations of IPv4. The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the
7.4 IPv6
199
Figure 7.19 Explosion of new IP devices.

anticipated future demand for globally unique IP addresses. Applications
such as mobile Internet-enabled devices (e.g., PDAs, telephones, and cars),
home area networks (HANs), and wireless data services are driving this de-
mand. IPv6 quadruples the number of network address bits from 32 bits
(in IPv4) to 128 bits, which provides more than enough globally unique IP
addresses for every networked device on the planet. By being globally
unique, IPv6 addresses inherently enable global reachability and end-to-
end security for networked devices, functionality that is crucial to the ap-
plications and services that are driving the demand for the addresses. Ad-
ditionally, the ﬂexibility of the IPv6 address space reduces the need for
private addresses and the use of NAT; therefore, IPv6 enables new applica-
tion protocols that do not require special processing by border routers at
the edge of networks.
7.4.1
Features
This section presents some of the features and beneﬁts of IPv6. Feature
highlights are
1. Expanded address space (128 bits compared to 32 bits in IPv4)
2. Header format simpliﬁcation (header has ﬁxed length)
3. Autoconﬁguration and multihoming (no need for DHCP)
4. Mobile IP without triangular routing
5. Class-of-service/multimedia support
6. Authentication and privacy capabilities
7. No more broadcast—multicast address
The following sections provide more details about the features and bene-
ﬁts of IPv6.
Addressing
IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and are represented as a series of 16-bit
hexadecimal ﬁelds separated by colons (:) in the format x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x.
Following are examples of two IPv6 addresses that have different lengths:
FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210
1080:0:0:0:8:800:200C:417A
There are three types of IPv6 addresses: unicast, anycast, and multicast.
Unicast
A unicast address is for a single interface. A packet that is sent to a unicast
address is delivered to the interface identiﬁed by that address. Figure 7.20
shows the ﬁelds of an IPv6 global unicast address. There are several types
of unicast addresses:
200
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

●
Aggregatable global address: An IPv6 address from the aggregatable
global unicast preﬁx, the structure of which enables strict aggre-
gation of routing preﬁxes that limits the number of routing table
entries in the global routing table. Aggregatable global addresses
used on links are aggregated upward through organizations, then to
intermediate-level ISPs, and eventually to top-level ISPs.
●
Site-local address: An IPv6 unicast address that uses the preﬁx FEC0::/
10 (1111 111011) and concatenates the subnet identiﬁer (the 16-bit
SLA ﬁeld) with the interface identiﬁer. Site-local addresses can be
used to number a complete site while not having a globally unique
preﬁx. They can be considered private addresses because they can be
used to restrict communication to a limited domain. Figure 7.21(a)
shows the structure of a site-local address. IPv6 routers must not for-
ward packets that have site-local source or destination addresses out-
side of the site.
●
Link-local address: An IPv6 unicast address that can be automati-
cally assigned using the link-local preﬁx FE80::/10 (1111 111010)
and the interface identiﬁer. Nodes on a local link can use link-local
addresses to communicate; they do not need site-local or globally
unique addresses. Figure 7.21(b) shows the structure of a link-local
address. IPv6 routers must not forward packets that have link-local
source or destination addresses to other links.
●
IPv4-compatible IPv6 address: An IPv6 unicast address that has zeros
in the high-order 96 bits of the address and an IPv4 address in the
low-order 32 bits of the address (see Figure 7.22). The format of an
IPv4-compatible IPv6 address is 0:0:0:0:0:0:A.B.C.D.
Anycast
An anycast address is an address that is assigned to a set of interfaces that
belong to different nodes. A packet sent to an anycast address is delivered
to the closest interface (as deﬁned by the routing protocols in use)

identiﬁed by the anycast address. Anycast addresses are syntactically in-
distinguishable from unicast addresses because they are allocated from the
unicast address space. Assigning a unicast address to more than one inter-
face makes a unicast address an anycast address. Nodes to which the
anycast address is assigned must be explicitly conﬁgured to recognize that
the address is anycast.

Multicast
An IPv6 multicast address has a preﬁx of FF00::/8 (1111 1111). It is an
identiﬁer for a set of interfaces that belong to different nodes. A packet
sent to a multicast address is delivered to all interfaces identiﬁed by the
multicast address. The second octet following the preﬁx deﬁnes the life-
time and scope of the multicast address. A permanent multicast address
has a lifetime parameter equal to 0; a temporary multicast address has a
lifetime parameter equal to 1. A multicast address that has the scope of a
node, link, site, organization, or globe has a scope parameter of 1, 2, 5, 8,
or E, respectively. For example, a multicast address with the preﬁx FF02::/
16 is a permanent multicast address with a link scope. Figure 7.23 shows
the format of the IPv6 multicast address.

The basic IPv4 packet header consists of 12 ﬁelds with a total size of 20
octets (160 bits) (see Figure 7.24). The 12 ﬁelds may be followed by an
Options ﬁeld, which is followed by a data portion that is usually the
transport-layer packet. The variable length of the Options ﬁeld adds to the
total size of the IPv4 packet header. The shaded ﬁelds of the IPv4 packet
header shown in Figure 7.24 are not included in the IPv6 packet header.
The basic IPv6 packet header consists of 8 ﬁelds with a total size of 40
octets (320 bits) (see Figure 7.24). Fields were removed from the IPv6
header because, in IPv6, routers do not handle fragmentation and check-
sums at the network layer. Instead, fragmentation in IPv6 is handled by
the source of a packet, and checksums at the datalink layer and transport
layer are used. (In IPv4, the UDP transport layer uses an optional check-
sum. In IPv6, use of the UDP checksum is required to check the integrity
of the inner packet.) Additionally, the basic IPv6 packet header and Op-
tions ﬁeld are aligned to 64 bits, which can facilitate the processing of

Autoconﬁguration
All interfaces on IPv6 nodes must have a link-local address, which is usu-
ally automatically conﬁgured from the identiﬁer for an interface, and
the link-local preﬁx FE80::0. A link-local address enables a node to com-
municate with other nodes on the link and can be used to further conﬁg-
ure the node. Nodes can connect to a network and automatically generate
site-local and global IPv6 addresses without the need for manual conﬁgu-
ration or help of a server, such as a dynamic host conﬁguration protocol
(DHCP) server. With IPv6, a router on the link advertises in router adver-
tisement messages any site-local and global preﬁxes and its willingness
to function as a default router for the link. Router advertisement mes-
sages are sent periodically and in response to router solicitation messages,
which are sent by hosts at system start-up. It is worth mentioning that
other conﬁguration parameters like a DNS server address still have to be
conﬁgured on each node.

Table 7.1
Description of ﬁelds of the IPv6 header.
Field
Description
Version
Similar to the Version ﬁeld in the IPv4 packet header, except that the
ﬁeld lists number 6 for IPv6 instead of number 4 for IPv4.
Trafﬁc Class
Similar to the Type of Service ﬁeld in the IPv4 packet header. The Trafﬁc
Class ﬁeld tags packets with a trafﬁc class that is used in differentiated
services.
Flow Label
A new ﬁeld in the IPv6 packet header. The Flow Label ﬁeld tags packets
with a speciﬁc ﬂow that differentiates the packets at the network layer.
Payload Length
Similar to the Total Length ﬁeld in the IPv4 packet header. The Payload
Length ﬁeld indicates the total length of the data portion of the packet.
Next Header
Similar to the Protocol ﬁeld in the IPv4 packet header. The value of the
Next Header ﬁeld determines the type of information following the basic
IPv6 header. The type of information following the basic IPv6 header can
be a transport-layer packet—for example, a TCP or UDP packet, or an
Extension Header, as shown Figure 7.24.
Hop Limit
Similar to the Time to Live ﬁeld in the IPv4 packet header. The value of
the Hop Limit ﬁeld speciﬁes the maximum number of routers that an
IPv6 packet can pass through before the packet is considered invalid.
Each router decrements the value by one. Because there is no checksum
in the IPv6 header, the router can decrement the value without needing
to recalculate the checksum, which saves processing resources.
Source Address
Similar to the Source Address ﬁeld in the IPv4 packet header, except that
the ﬁeld contains a 128-bit source address for IPv6 instead of a 32-bit
source address for IPv4.
Destination Address
Similar to the Destination Address ﬁeld in the IPv4 packet header, except
that the ﬁeld contains a 128-bit source address for IPv6 instead of a 32-
bit source address for IPv4.

Preﬁx Aggregation
The aggregation nature of the IPv6 address space enables an IPv6 address-
ing hierarchy. For example, an enterprise can subdivide a single IPv6 pre-
ﬁx from a service provider into multiple, longer preﬁxes for use within its
internal network. Conversely, a service provider can aggregate all of the
preﬁxes from the customers and advertise only the aggregate address.
Multihomed Sites
Multiple IPv6 preﬁxes can be assigned to networks and hosts. Having mul-
tiple preﬁxes assigned to a network makes it easy for that network to con-
nect to multiple ISPs without breaking the global routing table.
IP Mobility
In IPv6, Mobile IP is implemented using the routing extension header.
This enables a mobile node to send IP packets directly to a destination
node after the mobile node establishes an initial connection to the home
agent. Direct routing in Mobile IP is the ability of a mobile node to bypass
the home agent when sending IP packets to a destination node. Optional
extensions make direct routing possible in Mobile IP for IPv4 (the exten-
sions might not be implemented in all deployments of Mobile IP for
IPv4), whereas direct routing is built into Mobile IP for IPv6.
Security
IPSec functionality is essentially identical in both IPv6 and IPv4; however,
IPSec in IPv6 can be deployed from end to end—data may be encrypted
along the entire path between the source node and destination node.
(Typically, IPSec in IPv4 is deployed between border routers of separate
networks.) In IPv6, IPSec is implemented using the authentication exten-
sion header and the ESP extension header. The authentication header pro-
vides integrity and authentication of the source. It also provides optional
protection against replayed packets. The authentication header protects
the integrity of most of the IP header ﬁelds and authenticates the source
through a signature-based algorithm. The ESP header provides conﬁden-
tiality, authentication of the source, connectionless integrity of the inner
packet, antireplay, and limited trafﬁc ﬂow conﬁdentiality.
Other Advantages
Other advantages of IPv6 include
Flow label for more efﬁcient ﬂow identiﬁcation (avoids having to parse
the transport-layer port numbers)
206
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

Neighbor unreachability detection protocol for hosts to detect and re-
cover from ﬁrst-hop router failure
More general header compression (handles more than just IP and TCP)
Drawbacks
It also may be worth pointing out that the IPv6 routing/addressing archi-
tecture is pretty much the same as IPv4. This means that all of the prob-
lems and issues with the scalability of IPv4 routing exist in IPv6 as well.
7.4.3
Migration Strategy
Integration and coexistence with IPv4 is a prerequisite to enable the
smooth transition to IPv6. IPv6 has been designed from the beginning to
be transition-rich. Following are some of the approaches available to facil-
itate the integration of IPv6 networks with IPv4 networks:
●
Nodes that support both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks (see Fig-
ure 7.25(a))
●
IPv6 tunnels over IPv4 core networks (see Figure 7.25(b))

relay, ATM, and optical (e.g., wave-division multiplexing, or WDM)
7.4.4
Creating New Services
IPv6 helps to overcome the address space shortcomings of IPv4. With the
proliferation of IP devices that connect to the public Internet, NAT is not a
scalable solution. By making their network IPv6-compatible, service pro-
viders can be ready to offer IPv6 services to customers who require them.
As seen in Section 7.4.3, IPv4 and IPv6 can coexist in the same network.
By enabling IPv6, providers can offer additional IPv6 services to their
customers.
7.5 Local Multipoint Distribution Service
LMDS is a broadband, wireless point-to-multipoint communication sys-
tem operating above 20 GHz (depending on country of licensing) that can
be used to provide digital two-way voice, data, Internet, and video ser-
vices. The acronym LMDS is derived from the following:
●
Local: Denotes that propagation characteristics of signals in this fre-
quency range limit the potential coverage area of a single cell site;
ongoing ﬁeld trials conducted in metropolitan centers place the
range of an LMDS transmitter at up to 8 kilometers (ﬁve miles).
●
Multipoint: Indicates that signals are transmitted in a point-to-
multipoint or broadcast method; the wireless return path, from sub-
scriber to the base station, is a point-to-point transmission.
●
Distribution: Refers to the distribution of signals, which may consist
of simultaneous voice, data, Internet, and video trafﬁc.
●
Service: Implies the subscriber nature of the relationship between the
operator and the customer; the services offered through an LMDS
network are entirely dependent on the operator’s choice of business.
LMDS can provide up to 1.25 Gb/sec of bandwidth in both directions.
It is an access-layer technology and can help service providers to provide
connectivity between a customer site and the nearest service provider PoP
without using copper or ﬁber. This helps the service provider to avoid the
problems related to local loops.
7.5.1
Components
The LMDS network architecture (see Figure 7.26) consists primarily of
three parts:
208
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

Base station
Customer-premises equipment
Fiber-based infrastructure
Base Station
The base station is where the conversion from ﬁbered infrastructure to
wireless infrastructure occurs. Base station equipment includes the net-
work interface for ﬁber termination; modulation and demodulation func-
tions; and microwave transmission and reception equipment, typically lo-
cated atop a roof or a pole. Key functionalities that may not be present in
different designs include local switching. This function implies that bill-
ing, channel access management, registration, and authentication occur
locally within the base station.
The alternative base station architecture simply provides connection to
the ﬁber infrastructure. This forces all trafﬁc to terminate in ATM switches
somewhere in the ﬁber infrastructure. In this scenario, if two customers
connected to the same base station wish to communicate with each other,
they do so at a centralized location. Billing, authentication, registration,
and trafﬁc management functions are performed centrally.
CPE
Customer-premises conﬁgurations vary widely from vendor to vendor.
Primarily, all conﬁgurations will include outdoor mounted microwave
equipment and indoor digital equipment providing modulation, demod-
ulation, control, and customer-premises interface functionality. The CPE
may attach to the network using time-division multiple access (TDMA),
frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), or code-division multiple access

(CDMA) methodologies. The customer-premises interfaces will run the
full range, including plain old telephone service (POTS), Ethernet, unstruc-
tured DS1, structured DS1, frame relay, ATM-25, serial ATM over T1, DS3,
STM-1 ATM, and POS. The customer-premises locations will range from
large enterprises (e.g., ofﬁce buildings, hospitals, and campuses), in which
the microwave equipment is shared between many users, to mall loca-
tions and residences, in which single ofﬁces requiring 10BaseT and/or two
POTS lines will be connected. Obviously, different customer-premises
locations require different equipment conﬁgurations and different price
points.
7.5.2
Advantages
Point-to-point ﬁxed wireless networks have been commonly deployed to
offer high-speed dedicated links between high-density nodes in a net-
work. Moreover, since a large part of a wireless network’s cost is not in-
curred until the CPE is installed, the network service operator can time
capital expenditures to coincide with the signing of new customers. LMDS
provides an effective last-mile solution for the incumbent service provider
and can be used by competitive service providers to deliver services di-
rectly to end users. Beneﬁts can be summarized as follows:
Lower entry and deployment costs
Ease and speed of deployment (systems can be deployed rapidly with
minimal disruption to the community and the environment)
Fast realization of revenue (as a result of rapid deployment)
Demand-based build-out (scalable architecture employing open indus-
try standards, ensuring services and coverage areas can be easily ex-
panded as customer demand warrants)
Cost-effective network maintenance, management, and operating costs
High bandwidth (up to 1.25 Gb/sec in both directions)
7.6 Optical Networking
Optical networking provides the means to interconnect devices by using
optical ﬁber and to transport data over that optical ﬁber. Light is used to
convey information from one device to another. It is generated using
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes. Optical ﬁber has a number of
advantages over copper. It is lightweight, has enormous bandwidth poten-
tial, and is immune to electromagnetic interference. Optical ﬁber also has
its disadvantages, such as loss or attenuation (weakening of signal over
distance) and dispersion (equivalent to noise). The disadvantages can be
210
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

overcome with improvements in technology, and the advantages pro-
vide an enormous potential to send more data using the same physical
medium.
This section introduces the concept of optical networking and dis-
cusses how IP networks can be implemented on optical transport networks
(OTNs), as well as the advantages and applications of optical networking
technologies.
7.6.1
Technologies
Optical networking uses light to communicate information from one
point to another. An optical network consists of optical nodes connected
by ﬁber links. Depending on the transport technology, the optical nodes
differ in their intelligence in terms of switching and providing failure
mechanisms. The physical-layer technology includes SONET/SDH. Some
of the transport technologies include POS, ATM, 10-gigabit, and resil-
ient packet rings (also known as SRP). Another physical-layer technology
that is rapidly emerging and replacing transport technology is dense
wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM).
SONET and SDH
SONET (synchronous optical network) and SDH (synchronous digital hi-
erarchy) are recognized standards that make use of optical ﬁber to con-
vey information. SONET deﬁnes optical signals and a synchronous frame
structure for multiplexed digital trafﬁc. It is a set of standards deﬁning the
rates and formats for optical networks speciﬁed in ANSI T1.105, ANSI
T1.106, and ANSI T1.117. SDH, a similar standard, has been established in
Europe by ITU-T. SONET equipment is generally used in North America,
and SDH equipment is used everywhere else.
Both SONET and SDH use an optical carrier (OC). OC standards spec-
ify the physical properties of the optical signal (i.e., power, pulse shape,
modulation techniques, spectral widths, etc.). OC speeds are currently
speciﬁed from OC-1 (51.84 Mb/sec) to OC-192 (9953.28 Mb/sec). Both
SONET and SDH are based on a structure that has a basic frame and
speed. The frame format used by SONET is the synchronous transport signal
(STS), with STS-1 being the base-level signal at 51.84 Mb/sec. An STS-1
frame can be carried in an OC-1 signal. The frame format used by SDH
is the synchronous transport module (STM), with STM-1 being the base-
level signal at 155.52 Mb/sec. An STM-1 frame can be carried in an OC-3
signal.
Both SONET and SDH have a hierarchy of signaling speeds. Multiple
lower-level signals can be multiplexed together to form higher-level sig-
nals. For example, three STS-1 signals can be multiplexed together to form
an STS-3 signal, and four STM-1 signals multiplexed together will form an
STM-4 signal.
7.6 Optical Networking
211

DWDM
Dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) is a technology that al-
lows multiple information streams to be transmitted simultaneously over
a single ﬁber at data rates as high as the ﬁber will allow (2.4 Gb/sec). The
DWDM approach multiplies the simple 2.4 Gb/sec system by up to 16
times, giving an immense and immediate increase in capacity using em-
bedded ﬁber. A 16-channel system (which is available today) supports 40
Gb/sec in each direction over a ﬁber pair, while a 40-channel system un-
der development will support 100 Gb/sec, the equivalent of 10 STM-64/
OC-192 transmitters. The beneﬁts of DWDM over the ﬁrst two options—
adding ﬁber plant or deploying STM-64/OC-192 for increasing capacity—
are clear.
Advantages of DWDM
To transmit 40 Gb/sec over 600 kilometers (373 miles) using a traditional
system would require 16 separate ﬁber pairs with regenerators placed ev-
ery 35 kilometers (22 miles) for a total of 272 regenerators. A 16-channel
DWDM system, on the other hand, uses a single ﬁber pair and four am-
pliﬁers positioned every 120 kilometers (74.5 miles) for a total of 600 kilo-
meters (373 miles).
Applications of DWDM
As occurs with many new technologies, the potential ways in which
DWDM can be used are only beginning to be explored. Already, however,
the technology has proven to be particularly well suited for several vital
applications:
●
DWDM is ready-made for long-distance telecommunications opera-
tors that use either point-to-point or ring topologies. The sudden
availability of 16 new transmission channels where there used to be
only 1 dramatically improves an operator’s ability to expand capac-
ity and simultaneously set aside backup bandwidth without install-
ing new ﬁber.
●
This large amount of capacity is critical to the development of self-
healing rings, which characterize today’s most sophisticated telecom
networks. By deploying DWDM terminals, an operator can con-
struct a 100% protected, 40 Gb/sec ring, with 16 separate communi-
cation signals using only two ﬁbers.
●
Operators that are building or expanding their networks will also
ﬁnd DWDM to be an economical way to incrementally increase
capacity, rapidly provision new equipment for needed expansion,
and future-proof their infrastructure against unforeseen bandwidth
demands.
●
Network wholesalers can take advantage of DWDM to lease capac-
ity, rather than entire ﬁbers, either to existing operators or to new
212
Chapter 7: IP-Based Services: Advanced Topics

market entrants. DWDM will be especially attractive to companies
that have low-ﬁber-count cables that were installed primarily for in-
ternal operations but that could now be used to generate telecom-
munications revenue.
7.6.2
IP and Optical Networking
Figure 7.27 shows the evolution of the optical networks and how IP can
use them. The last part of the ﬁgure shows IP directly over the optical ad-
aptation layer—optical technology is heading in this direction. General-
ized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) is an example of such a tech-
nology. Running IP directly over an optical network (DWDM and using
GMPLS) helps reduce the complexity of the protocol stack. It also helps to
signiﬁcantly reduce the complexity and time required to provision the
networks, as well as the overheads of layers like ATM and POS, and pro-
vides additional bandwidth and enhanced protection mechanisms.
The optical network is no longer a group of point-to-point links; it has
nodes and links. The nodes are optical switches (optical cross-connects, or
OXCs) that switch light (based on wavelength) from one port to another.
The network is resilient and provides protection mechanisms. Trans-
forming the optical layer from a collection of point-to-point links to a re-
silient and manageable network is achieved by introducing devices called

wavelength routers (see Figure 7.28). These are huge optical switches,
switching wavelengths through an optical network. The wavelength rout-
ing capacity implemented in the wavelength routers makes it possible to
provision end-to-end wavelength paths between IP routers dynamically.
The wavelength routers implement signaling mechanisms to provide pro-
tection in case of link and node failures.
Figure 7.28 shows three IP routers (R1, R2, and R3) interconnected using
an optical network. The optical network has ﬁve wavelength routers (W1,
W2, W3, W4, and W5). A wavelength path (WP1) is established between W1
and W3 to provide IP connectivity between R1 and R2. Another wave-
length path (WP2) is established between W1 and W5 to provide IP connec-
tivity between R1 and R3.
Similar to the IP network, the optical network also has two planes: the
control plane and the forwarding plane. The control plane provides the in-
telligence and is responsible for establishing the wavelength-switching
matrix in each wavelength router and also for providing the protecting
mechanism for each wavelength path. The forwarding plane is respon-
sible for switching the wavelength based on the wavelength-switching
matrix.
Two architectures are common in implementing IP directly over optical
networks:

Overlay model: In this model, the optical network is opaque to the IP
network—that is, the IP network is not aware of the topology of the
optical network. The control planes of the optical network and IP
network are independent.

work, and the control planes of the IP and optical networks are inte-

This overlay model is similar to the overlay model used in the IP-over-
ATM and IP-over-frame relay architectures. The underlying optical net-
work is visible as point-to-point links to the IP network. Figure 7.29 shows
the overlay model. The topologies of the IP network and optical network
are not the same, and the IP network does not have any knowledge of the

topology of the optical network. The optical network is visible as a set of
point-to-point links to the IP network.
Figure 7.30 shows the implementation of the overlay model for the IP
and optical networks. The control plane for the optical network is inde-
pendent of the control plane of the IP network. The optical network pro-
vides bandwidth and protection services to the IP network in a transpar-
ent manner. This model is typically used when one service provider owns
the optical network and another owns the IP network. The IP service pro-
vider buys bandwidth from the optical service provider: the optical service
provider is a bandwidth broker and provides bandwidth (on demand) to
other service providers.
Peer Model
In a peer model, several service providers own both the optical network and
the IP network. They look for ways in which to streamline and have a

single control plane for both networks. The IP network (based on MPLS)
uses labels to switch packets, and the optical network uses lambda (wave-
length) to switch packets. The principles of the control plane are similar
for both networks. One is used to assign labels and the other is used to as-
sign lambdas. Integrating the two control planes into one will help service
providers streamline their networking.
The peer model (also known as the integrated optical and IP peer model)
uses a common control plane for both the optical and IP networks. Figure
7.31 shows the integrated optical and IP peer model. In this architecture,
the IP routers and wavelength routers are peers and use the same control
plane. The topology of the optical network is visible to the IP network.
The same signaling mechanism is used in order to establish paths between
IP routers and between wavelength routers. This concept is described in
detail in the following section.
7.6.3
Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
Generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS), also referred to as multi-
protocol lambda switching, is a multipurpose control plane paradigm that
supports not only devices that perform packet switching but also devices
that perform switching in the time, wavelength, and space domains. Re-
cent work has been done to extend and adapt the MPLS control plane,
and speciﬁcally MPLS constraint-based routing, so that it can be used not
just with routers and ATM switches but also with optical cross-connects
(OXCs). This is a fundamental step in the evolution and integration of
data and optical network architectures.
Some enhancements are clearly required to the existing MPLS routing
and signaling protocol to address the peculiar characteristics of optical
transport networks. The IETF, under the framework of GMPLS, is standard-
izing these protocol extensions. Figure 7.32 shows one type of GMPLS net-
work that does lambda switching. The lambda switching router (LSR) in this
network switches lambdas (wavelengths of light) from one port to an-
other. MPLS is used at the signaling plane to establish the lambda switch
paths. Once the lambda switch paths are established, then data is trans-
mitted through this optical network with the help of the LSRs.

Several issues must be addressed in order to make this technology feasi-
ble. Signaling and routing enhancements and protection mechanisms are
required to be built into the optical layer in order to make it robust. Sev-
eral enhancements are currently being proposed in order to make GMPLS
more scalable and robust. The concepts of generalized interfaces, label-
switched path hierarchy, and link bundling make GMPLS scalable. The
link management protocol can be used to make the underlying links more
manageable. The signaling capabilities of GMPLS will allow service pro-
viders to quickly build out high-capacity agile infrastructures that sup-
port fast provisioning of connectivity between any two points in an IP
network.
7.6.4
Applications of Optical Networks
Optical networks help the evolution of the service provider network in
several areas. This includes the metro network and the core network. The
evolution helps the service provider to reduce provisioning time as band-
width requirements increase every day, to offer a more resilient network
(using advanced protection mechanisms offered by the optical network),
and to merge the control planes of the transport and IP networks.

Metro Network
The metro network provides coverage in a metropolitan area and is used to
aggregate trafﬁc from several metro locations. It also helps to overcome
the last-mile problem by providing ﬁber connectivity directly to customer
locations. Providing interconnectivity between the various metro loca-
tions means that there is a constant need to increase bandwidth, because
the aggregated trafﬁc will grow and more bandwidth is required to con-
nect to the nearest PoP location. Providing ﬁber to a customer site means
constantly provisioning new customers.
Optical technologies like gigabit, 10-gigabit, POS, resilient rings (SRP),
and IP-over-DWDM meet these requirements of the metro network. Giga-
bit, 10-gigabit, and POS help to provide direct ﬁber connectivity to
homes. SRP and IP-over-DWDM help to aggregate trafﬁc from several
metro locations to the nearest service provider PoP location.
Core Network
Today, legacy SONET/SDH protection ring architectures at STM-64/OC-
192 provide connectivity between core nodes in a service provider
network. The protection mechanism provided by SONET (APS) helps
to provide seamless connectivity between core nodes. The limita-
tions of this technology are wasted bandwidth to provide protection
(backup links that are used only in case of failure) and an inability to
increase bandwidth between core locations without installing new
ﬁbers.M
The integrated optical and IP peer model helps to overcome both of
these problems. Bandwidth can be increased on demand without install-
ing new ﬁbers. The optical network provides protection without wasting
any bandwidth. The integration of the control plane for IP and the optical
network helps in reducing the operation, administration, maintenance,
and provisioning costs in the core network.
Bandwidth-on-Demand
The optical network helps to provide bandwidth-on-demand between two
locations. This means that the bandwidth between any two locations can
be increased without installation of additional ﬁbers. The integrated opti-
cal and IP model helps to achieve this in a transparent manner between
any two locations that require IP connectivity. The single control plane
for the IP and optical network helps to provision new IP connections be-
tween any two points in the IP network in a transparent manner and re-
duces the complexity of provisioning new links between IP routers. This
will help a service provider to provide bandwidth-on-demand to other ser-
vice providers.

7.7 Chapter Review
This chapter has provided an overview on some advanced topics related to
IP-based services. These topics supplement the features supported by IP
and enhance the services that can be offered by the IP network. For read-
ers who are interested in more details about the topics covered in this
chapter, the bibliography at the end of the book provides suggestions for
further reading.
Today, the requirements of applications using the IP network are more
than just “best-effort.” In order to meet requirements like guaranteed
bandwidth; minimized delay, jitter, and packet loss; and security, it is nec-
essary to implement the QoS functions in the network. Transporting voice
over an IP network helps to merge the voice and data networks. This helps
customers to reduce the cost of maintaining two networks and also to
make effective use of the IP networks. Voice-over-IP has QoS requirements
like minimizing delay and jitter and ensuring bandwidth. By enhancing
the QoS functions of an IP network, it can support applications like voice-
over-IP.
IPSec helps to enhance the security of the IP network. MPLS-VPNs pro-
vide secure networks by ensuring that VPNs are private and that data from
one VPN does not get forwarded to a different VPN. However, MPLS-VPNs
do not guarantee data conﬁdentiality. If someone manages to break into
the VPN, that person can then access the packets and the contents of the
packets. IPSec provides data conﬁdentiality by encrypting the data before
transmitting it over the VPN.
The rapid growth in the number of devices with IP addresses has led to
the evolution of IPv6. The addressing structure of IPv4 limits the number
of devices to about 232. NAT helps overcome this problem to a certain ex-
tent, but it has its own limitations, such as loss of transparency and inabil-
ity to provide end-to-end QoS. IPv6 overcomes this restriction by using
128 bits for an IP address.
Optical networking is a hot topic that is emerging rapidly. IP and opti-
cal networking will help the service provider to resolve the problems re-
lated to bandwidth, resiliency, and rapid provisioning in the core net-
work. Bandwidth-on-demand is becoming increasing popular, and optical
networks and IP together can provide a good solution to this requirement.

Case Studies
The previous chapters presented business and technical factors that drive
IP-based service development and deployment. They offered perspectives
from the service provider, the end customer, and the supplier in order to
explain the motivation to develop IP-based services. Further examining
the role of IP-based technology with advanced topics, such as optics, dem-
onstrated why IP-based technology is tantamount to service develop-
ment. Building the case for IP-based services has been our focus thus far.
This ﬁnal chapter presents how actual service providers, end customers,
and suppliers use IP-based technology to solve business problems and
what lessons can be learned from their experiences.
In this chapter, we outline two conceptual case studies as well as a real-
world case study, which together demonstrate how IP-based services can
be developed and deployed by service providers to generate revenue. The
case studies emphasize the role of OSS architecture in implementing IP-
based services. The two conceptual case studies are composites of real ex-
periences of various service providers. The combination of these two con-
ceptual studies with a real-world example demonstrates the full impact of
IP in both business and technical aspects.
The conceptual case studies present scenarios for both Greenﬁeld and
incumbent service providers. The results of implementing IP-based tech-
nology to develop services are included since they derive from actual
221

examples and provide a good view of the business impact. The real-world
example is based on the authors’ experiences working with a European
incumbent. The conceptual studies are based on the experiences of U.S.
service providers, but are not restricted to the North American market—
they are applicable to Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Paciﬁc region, and
emerging markets as well. The issues and challenges are similar, including
assessing market potential for new services, implementing new services,
and improving service provisioning.
The common thread in these case study examples, both conceptual and
real, is deﬁning the ﬁnancial incentives to develop IP-based services. Fur-
ther, the challenging task for service providers is to assure that there is no
misalignment between their product strategies and the end customer’s re-
quirements. Speciﬁcally, there has to be an incentive for a customer to
contract for IP-based services. Finally, these players analyze whether or
not it is ﬁnancially and technically feasible to develop an IP-based service
architecture that will support the services in question. Identifying how
these issues are addressed by service providers is in the scope of this
chapter.
The technical aspects discussed in the ﬁrst conceptual case study (λ-
Networking, Inc.) are very detailed and lengthy (Section 8.1.9). The terms
and concepts used in this section are reused later in the other two case
studies. You are asked to refer to the ﬁrst case study for technical details re-
lated to the other case studies.
8.1 Conceptual Case Study—Greenﬁeld
The company in this conceptual case study is based in the United States. It
is not an incumbent and is categorized as a competitive local exchange
carrier (CLEC). The case study’s focus is on how this company has used IP-
based technology to construct its network infrastructure and present a
bundled service offering with a single bill to its customer base. (Service
bundles are deﬁned in Chapter 1. The concepts of service pricing and
packaging are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.) The ﬁnancial incentive of
purchasing a service bundle for the customer is to have a discount for
multiple services that are packaged together by a service provider. Another
incentive for the customer is to have a single bill for the bundled services
as opposed to separate billing, which can be complex. Customers may pre-
fer to have their services delivered from a single vendor. Service bundles
mean that the service provider manages the services. The ﬁnancial incen-
tive for the service provider in offering service bundles is that they ensure
a ﬂow of revenue. For service providers, bundling subsidizes lower-margin
services with higher-margin services and results in a margin increase. In
fact, offering bundled services makes it more difﬁcult for a customer to
switch to other providers, because the services are packaged together.
222
Chapter 8: Case Studies

Thus, service providers use bundles to “lock” a relationship with the
customer.
8.1.1
Background
The company, referred to as λ-Networking, Inc., is an East Coast–based
CLEC that has constructed a national ﬁber backbone, operating at an OC-
192/STM-64 speed, with metropolitan networks in over 60 cities. λ-
Networking has invested in its ﬁber-based network infrastructure for the
past seven years, and its stock is publicly traded in the U.S. stock market.
The service differentiator for this company is that it can offer customers a
single, simple invoice for value-added services such as voice-over-IP, Web
hosting, corporate IP-VPN, and so on. Such billing is difﬁcult, as most U.S.
Greenﬁeld service providers do not possess a national network.
λ-Networking has a total ﬁber installation that spans approximately
450,000 ﬁber miles (725,000 km). By constructing and owning its ﬁber in-
frastructure at both a metropolitan and a national level, the company is
able to provision the “last mile,” therein controlling its network end to
end. (Associated regulatory issues are discussed in Chapter 1.)
The company offers broadband access services via LMDS technology.
(LMDS is highlighted in Chapter 7.) The result of this service offering is
that λ-Networking is able to provide direct access to end customers by us-
ing LMDS to bypass the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs). Cus-
tomers are able to connect to λ-Networking via either dial access, for
speeds up to 56 Kb/sec; DSL, for speeds up to 2.3 Mb/sec; or dedicated
leased lines, ranging from T-1 to full OC-3 access.
λ-Networking consists of approximately 5,500 employees in the United
States. Its key services include Web hosting, local voice, long-distance
voice, intranet-VPN, and Internet access. Its pivotal technology strategy
is to provide a single-source, high-capacity, multiservice-capable, secure,
and reliable network that will be used to deploy new services. The com-
pany’s emphasis has been on constructing its high-speed IP network and
developing the value-added service suites that will be deployed in this
network.
The target customer segments are small to medium businesses, with
partial coverage to large enterprises and the government sector. An em-
phasis on simple, uniﬁed (end-to-end) billing based on ﬂat-rate pricing
permits λ-Networking to quickly penetrate the desired market segments.
(A usage- and content-based billing from the service start would have re-
quired a signiﬁcant amount of time for OSS billing integration; content-
based billing examines the application layer for billing and is often associ-
ated with Web hosting and e-commerce services.)
This case study represents a Greenﬁeld service provider’s approach to
using IP for service development and deployment. (The approach is dis-
cussed in Chapter 3.) We will now explore the dynamics between the
8.1 Conceptual Case Study—Greenﬁeld
223

customer, λ-Networking, and the equipment vendors in order to under-
stand the issues and pressures associated with deﬁning IP-based services.
Moreover, measuring the proﬁtability of these services will also be
examined.
8.1.2
Business Aspects
λ-Networking does not position itself as a regular CLEC—speciﬁcally, the
company has advertised its intentions to expand internationally. Some
CLECs have focused on the wholesale market, while others have targeted
small and midsize businesses. λ-Networking targets small, midsize, and
large businesses, as well as the federal and some local government sectors.
The company focus in 2000 was to build metropolitan ﬁber networks with
the intent to tackle the last mile in order to control the network end to
end.
In 2000 the leadership team was also challenged by the competitive en-
vironment to rapidly develop a service portfolio that would be accepted
by the target markets. In the background, λ-Networking continued the
rollout of its high-speed IP network infrastructure based on DWDM archi-
tecture, believing that such an infrastructure would speed deployment of
new services to corporate customers. The DWDM architecture is scalable,
since the same ﬁber can be used for trafﬁc from multiple sources (this ar-
chitecture is discussed in Chapter 7.) DWDM is deployed in the core net-
work, and LMDS is at the access network.
The infrastructure build-out was completed in 2001. From 2000 to
2001, the company evolved its business strategy by developing value-
added services for its business and government customers. In a highly vol-
atile environment where most new entrants have failed and gone out of
business, λ-Networking has paved a path for business viability.
Customer Requirements
The following is a summary of customer requirements:
Single service provider deploying and managing services end to end
Different aggregation speed, ranging from 56 Kb/sec to 155 Mb/sec
(OC-3)
Internet access
VPN services
Voice and video services
Web-hosting services
Online SLA reports
Single bill
224
Chapter 8: Case Studies

The market sectors for these services are small to medium enterprises,
large enterprises, and the public sector. Customer applications include
Web browsers, email, videoconferencing, imaging, electronic ﬁle trans-
fers, and voice. λ-Networking studied the market and found that approxi-
mately 45% of the small to medium enterprises wanted a bundling of
local and long-distance services because of the desire to work with a sin-
gle provider for service delivery. These customers are frustrated by ser-
vice complexities, such as different billing from different providers, exac-
erbated by regulatory complexities (as addressed in Chapter 1). These
customers further would prefer to have a single service provider capable of
offering value-added services like Internet access, corporate IP-VPN, Web
hosting, voice-over-IP, and so on. Customers representing this market
have felt ignored by providers since they do not belong to the large, multi-
national enterprises coveted by existing service providers. Conversely,
large enterprises want to see an established track record from a service pro-
vider before any signiﬁcant business can be successfully negotiated.
λ-Networking also includes the government sector in its portfolio, cov-
ering federal, state, and local agencies. The company’s market research de-
termined that the federal telecommunications market in the United States
is approximately $6.5 million, with an annual growth rate of about 4.5%.
As λ-Networking owns its network infrastructure, extending ﬁber to the
public sector—which requires high bandwidth for such applications as
videoconferencing, military imaging, and medical imaging—enables the
company to implement a last-mile strategy of bringing the network di-
rectly to the customer without connecting via competitors.
Customer requirements include the ability to support different access
speeds, ranging from 56 Kb/sec to 155 Mb/sec to the service provider,
services that provide Internet access, and corporate VPN access, voice
and video services, Web-hosting services, and online SLA reports. Cus-
tomers require that these services be offered and implemented by a sin-
gle service provider to manage an SLA end to end—that is, avoiding third
parties that can impact the service levels. By avoiding third parties, cus-
tomers expect that a service provider will consolidate services on a sin-
gle bill.
λ-Networking, Inc.’s Strategic Objectives
In order to develop and deliver its service portfolios, the company identi-
ﬁed its own set of strategic objectives, summarized as follows:
Scalable network (to support hundreds of customer connections)
Reliable network (to offer high availability—99.999%—to customers)
Security for customer data (in the sense that trafﬁc from one customer
is not visible/accessible to another customer)
8.1 Conceptual Case Study—Greenﬁeld
225

Differentiated services (in terms of bandwidth and delay) for premium
customers
SLA reporting to customers
A reliable network operations center (NOC)
λ-Networking has been building a network capable of evolving with future
technologies. Constructing a network where the infrastructure can be en-
hanced and not replaced is the crux of scalability for the company.
An advantage for λ-Networking is that it has no legacy infrastructure.
(Why a legacy infrastructure is a liability is discussed in Chapter 4.) The
infrastructure technology of choice impacts the scalability issue. One ele-
ment that affects scalability is the capacity required to support customer
access speeds, ranging from 56 Kb/sec to full OC-3 surrounding the 60 na-
tional metro locations. Interconnecting eight data centers via OC-12 to
the metro PoPs is also a requirement for the company. The national core
network must not be a bottleneck for performance and therefore should
be capable of supporting multiple aggregation speeds, ranging from OC-3
to OC-12, and the trafﬁc that is switched across the core must be IP only.
λ-Networking standardized on a single protocol, IP, for transporting
trafﬁc, voice, video, and data. The strategy for the company is to build an
“IP central ofﬁce” architecture that accepts IP trafﬁc from the metropoli-
tan ﬁber ring and transports it end to end, the advantage being a single
network that can support multiservices (as discussed in Chapter 5).
As there will be customer mission-critical applications on the network,
ensuring reliability is also a key requirement for λ-Networking. This means
that the core should provide 99.999% availability. There should be redun-
dant ﬁber connections from the metropolitan PoPs to the core, located
in different conduits. The platform components, hardware, and software
should not negatively impact network reliability. In case of a component
failure, transparent rerouting should be available and not result in loss of
connectivity at the application layer.
λ-Networking will not enforce what the company has termed “com-
plex” SLAs. Either the service works or it does not. To avoid customer
churn, λ-Networking offers a customer satisfaction guarantee in the ﬁrst
three months of a new service delivery. If the customer is not satisﬁed
within the ﬁrst three months, the company will switch the customer back
to the original carrier free of charge. Should the customer experience a
problem after three months, λ-Networking will negotiate a service credit.
Security is a requirement for λ-Networking because a common network
infrastructure is used to offer services to multiple enterprises. The same
core network of the service provider is used to deliver trafﬁc from multiple
services and multiple customers. The network cannot be compromised
such that a loss of service is due to unauthorized and miscreant attacks.
VPN services to business customers must be delivered with a minimum set
of security features, such as IPSec tunneling.
226
Chapter 8: Case Studies

Provisioning differentiated services onto a common backbone infra-
structure is also a requirement for λ-Networking. Voice, videoconferenc-
ing, and data cannot be treated identically, as these applications possess
different QoS requirements for latency, with voice receiving the highest
priority in terms of packetized trafﬁc across the backbone. (These QoS re-
quirements are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.) The base technology im-
plemented by λ-Networking must allow for the support of differentiated
services.
Finally, all services must be mapped to a common billing system for
uniﬁed invoicing and reporting. The uniﬁed billing is a value proposition
for the end customer. The customer must be able to order a service and
view the bill via a secure Web interface. These features must be integrated
into the OSS architecture of λ-Networking. (OSS is discussed in Chapters 2
and 6.)
The company must develop and deploy these services quickly, so as
to gain revenue and sustain growth and proﬁtability. Performing a due-
diligence exercise on these service packages is essential in order to deter-
mine whether or not money can be made. The next steps are balancing
the costs for the network infrastructure build-out, the costs required to
support the services, and operational expenses with revenue gained on a
quarterly basis.
8.1.3
Services
λ-Networking developed its service packages in the ﬁrst six months of the
year 2000 while simultaneously building out its metro and national infra-
structures. The approach was quick market entry and penetration. The
strategy for this quick market entry was to identify a set of service pack-
ages that could be readily adopted by the company’s target market. The
services are voice (local and long distance); Internet access (up to full OC-
3); VPN; metro Ethernet services (up to 1 Gb/sec connectivity); Web host-
ing; managed server; and customer server co-location facility.
Service pricing is designed to be attractive for bundled services. The
goal is to assure a 10% to 30% discount, assuming that the entire package
is purchased. Price variations depend upon regional access rates. These
rates can be granted on a corporate basis or on a per-individual basis. The
metro Ethernet service is priced on a per-port basis. Managed server host-
ing consists of a series of options, depending on the operating system,
amount of memory desired, applications, and bandwidth. The pricing in-
cludes a one-time installation fee ($700 to $3500), with a monthly price
ranging from $700 to $25,000 (if in excess of 10 Mb/sec). The VPN service
is also offered in a bundled package where connectivity options range
from dial-up at 56 Kb/sec to a full T3 dedicated link. The service can be
managed by λ-Networking. The VPN service offered by the company sets
it apart as a leader in the market because this service similarly uses bun-
dling and value-added service options to up-sell to customers features like
8.1 Conceptual Case Study—Greenﬁeld
227

Internet access together with VPN service, as an example. The competi-
tion tends to sell these services separately.
Table 8.1 depicts a typical bundled option menu targeted to a small to
medium enterprise. A customer can order these services via the Web, and
the invoicing is a ﬂat rate based on the bundle selected.
Bandwidth Increase
One key driver behind the λ-Networking build-out of its infrastructure has
been to provide large amounts of bandwidth in service packages, due to
the need to support applications such as videoconferencing and medical
imaging. The metropolitan PoP aggregation, reﬂecting thousands of end-
customer connections, is also a factor for bandwidth increase. For exam-
ple, the gigabit Ethernet service that extends customer LANs remotely re-
quires high bandwidth.
8.1.4
Service Implementation Model
λ-Networking put a priority on developing the OSS architecture in order to
facilitate order entry, billing, and reporting. The key was to be able to pro-
duce a single, consolidated invoice that reﬂected multiservice bundles to
its customers. The company also added the option for usage-based invoic-
ing and reporting to its system. The platforms are redundant and installed
in data centers (with a backup data center for disaster and recovery). Cus-
tomer interface is Web-based, for order entry by the customer and secure
access to provide online billing and reporting.
The sales force uses the sales database that is part of the OSS architec-
ture to forecast sales and to compare performance to date by region. A
modeling tool is available for the sales team to work with a customer
to compare the costs and beneﬁts of a competitor provider with those

offered by λ-Networking. The product management team uses the service
creation database for service development: A new service or service exten-
sion is entered into the service development database. If the service is
new, a ﬂag is sent out and a service development process is launched. If
the requirement is a service enhancement, a ﬂag is indicated as “enhance-
ment,” and a quick feasibility study is executed to determine time, re-
sources, and expected date of enhancement (this is all available to engi-
neering and network operations as well as to sales and marketing).
λ-Networking believes that the OSS architecture is a cornerstone of
their business operations. Everything is automated, from order entry to
provisioning. In providing a single OSS for multiservices based on IP, the
company views this strategy as vital in reducing operating expenses.
8.1.5
Company Performance
λ-Networking, as a new entrant in the market, has embarked on a strat-
egy to construct its own multiservice networking infrastructure. By in-
vesting in a high-performance, IP-based platform developed on top of
ﬁber optics, the company believes that the network will be adaptive to
multiservice requirements like voice, videoconferencing, data, and so on.
The key difference between λ-Networking and its competitors, speciﬁcally
incumbents, is that λ-Networking has developed the network and ser-
vices within approximately one year. The company sees its competi-
tion struggling, trying to enable legacy infrastructures for IP-based service
offerings without disturbing their very large customer bases. The com-
pany, however, realizes that it is only a matter of time before the
competition starts to widely develop and deploy IP-based services. Thus,
the strategy is to penetrate the market rapidly by gaining and keeping
customers.
How did the company perform between 2000 and 2001? The reported
revenue from these new service packages at the end of 2000 was approxi-
mately $850 million. The reported revenue at the end of 2001 was ap-
proximately $2 billion, demonstrating both an increase in revenue and a
reduction in operating expenses. λ-Networking is paving a growth path
toward proﬁtability. In fundamental business language, the continued
improvement in results indicates that the strategy to build out a high-
performance, IP-based infrastructure for multiservices is starting to reap
beneﬁts.
8.1.6
Alternatives Considered
λ-Networking had considered being only a bandwidth broker as an alter-
native to developing and deploying IP-based services. The strategy, how-
ever, was to address the requirements of small to medium enterprises for
bundled value-added services. The market research and corresponding
revenue results indicated that there was an opportunity for revenue. The
company later extended to its customers bandwidth services as an
8.1 Conceptual Case Study—Greenﬁeld
229

enhancement to the bundled service offering. Finally, λ-Networking of-
fered a separate bandwidth service offering that is not part of the bundled
package.
The company could have constructed separate networks for its ser-
vices—like PSTN for voice and frame relay and ATM for data and video-
conferencing. This would have required separate billing systems as well
as dedicated network operations personnel. The probable operating cost
would have been negative. By offering bundled services, the company
was able to penetrate the market more quickly and to sign up customers
interested in having a single service provider that offered value-added ser-
vices and managed the service levels end to end. λ-Networking built a net-
work that is ﬂexible enough to deliver multiple services invoiced on a sin-
gle bill, a customer requirement. The company further recognizes that its
competition, namely, incumbents, are struggling to evolve multiple net-
works toward a convergence-like platform. For λ-Networking, the invest-
ment in a network asset that will evolve in the future was the only
alternative.
8.1.7
Vendor Selection Process
λ-Networking had stated that the network infrastructure must support
multiple vendors. Once the company had settled on a strategy for a high-
performance, IP-based network and an OSS architecture that would be
key to the development and deployment of value-added services, it in-
vited three select vendors to its laboratory. These vendors were selected on
the basis of technology leadership, market position, and installed base in a
service provider environment. The testing was to narrow down the ven-
dors to two partners for delivery of the core infrastructure. A third-party
vendor for OSS integration was selected to ensure that the architecture
components such as network management, conﬁguration management,
performance management, billing management, service management,
and so on were developed and validated.
The lab testing included basic functionality tests for compliance with
published speciﬁcations; performance testing against load; reliability; en-
vironmental factors such as heating, power supply, and card redundancy;
and interoperability. Interoperability testing was based on published spec-
iﬁcations for standard compliance. λ-Networking stated that the selected
vendors must interoperate and assure interoperability in the future—this
meant that the vendors would have to work together such that they
would not lose the customer for lack of interoperable compliance. λ-
Networking also speciﬁed that the OSS architecture must be built on open
standards in order to assure integration of key components that were non-
proprietary. Dependence on any one vendor was to be avoided by the
company in order to emphasize open interfaces on new products.
The company lab team conducted further sets of tests like provisioning,
reporting, and performance, for validating the services from the vendors.
230
Chapter 8: Case Studies

Finally, after three months of testing, two vendors were selected for the
core and edge network infrastructure: one would be positioned in the core
network and the other at the edge network. λ-Networking established a
strategic relationship with the two vendors in order to develop products
necessary for service development. One of these vendors was also selected
to deliver the CPE for the managed VPN service. Providing minimal soft-
ware and hardware upgrades was also a factor in the vendor selection,
as the company simply could not afford to change software frequently
because a feature was lacking or because of instability. λ-Networking re-
iterated that these two vendors must work closely together in order to
have the business: the vendor contract was explicit on this point of
interoperability.
8.1.8
Technical Aspects
λ-Networking needs a network that can deliver all the services discussed
in Section 8.1.2 and can meet the company’s requirements in terms of
scalability, reliability, security, operational aspects, and cost-effectiveness.
The company has PoPs in 60 cities distributed all over the country. As-
suming that ﬁber is available between these locations, the network has to
be designed for reliability and to avoid single points of failure in the
network.
Figure 8.1 gives an overview of the services that λ-Networking wants to
offer to its customers: IP-VPN, voice-over-IP, Internet access, and Web
hosting. The IP services are based on top of the company’s IP network. The
IP network is used to deliver the trafﬁc from all of these IP services.

Network Architecture
λ-Networking wants to build a network that is scalable, stable, and reli-
able. The network must be hierarchical so that it is scalable. It must sup-
port redundancy and must not have single points of failure because of the
SLA agreements with customers. (The terms scalable, stable, and reliable are
discussed in Chapter 5.) Scalable implies that the core network must be ca-
pable of supporting several customers and that enough resources (e.g., of
bandwidth, memory, routing table) are available to support all of the ser-
vices. Stable means that changes (e.g., topology, addition of new net-
works) in the customer premises, access, and edge networks do not have
any implications for the core network. Reliable means that the network
does not have single points of failure (both for network links and network
nodes).
A good starting point for the network architecture is to use the model
described in Section 5.2, based on access, distribution/edge, and core (see
Figure 8.2). The access network provides the connectivity between the
customer premises and the service provider network. The edge net-
work (in each location where λ-Networking has a PoP) is used to concen-
trate all of the customer connections and also to provide intelligence to

implement the services offered to the customer. The core network pro-
vides connectivity between the different PoPs located in 60 cities.
Access Network
The access network is used to provide connectivity between customer pre-
mises and the service provider network. λ-Networking has ﬁber and cop-
per connections between the network edge and its customers’ premises,
and in other cases, the telephone line is used to provide connectivity. The
company decided to implement the access network using the following
technologies in order to meet the different speed requirements, costs, and
physical network infrastructures at each customer site:
●
ISDN: This technology provides up to 56 Kb/sec and is useful for
small to medium enterprises and mobile customers. It will not be
possible to limit the Layer 2 bandwidth available to the customer.
●
DSL: This technology provides up to 2.3 Mb/sec and is useful for the
residential market, small enterprises, and the small ofﬁces of large
companies. It is possible to limit the Layer 2 bandwidth available to
the customer and also to bill the customer based on usage.
●
Leased lines using T1: This technology can provide up to 1.54 Mb/sec.
It is possible to limit the available bandwidth used by the customer,
to increase the available bandwidth-on-demand, and to bill the cus-
tomer based on link utilization.
●
T3 links using ﬁber: This technology provides up to 45 Mb/sec. It is
possible to restrict the available Layer 2 bandwidth and also to in-
crease the available Layer 2 bandwidth-on-demand. This can be used
for business customers.
●
OC-3 connection: This technology provides up to 155 Mb/sec using
ﬁber connection. Depending on the Layer 2 technology (limited to
ATM but not possible for POS), this technology can be used to re-
strict the available Layer 2 bandwidth and also to increase the avail-
able Layer 2 bandwidth-on-demand (up to the maximum limit). This
technology can be used for customers who require high-speed con-
nections for their headquarters.
●
Ethernet using ﬁber: This technology can provide bandwidth up to
1000 Mb/sec. The bandwidth can be provided in three steps: 10 Mb/
sec, 100 Mb/sec, and 1000 Mb/sec. Available bandwidth cannot be
restricted at Layer 2. (Layer 3 techniques are required to restrict the
bandwidth available to a customer.)
Access concentrators are required to terminate the multiple access con-
nections from different customers and connect them to the nearest edge
device. The location of the access concentrators depends on the access
technology. ATM connections can be terminated on an ATM switch before
they are connected to the edge device, and it is best to place the concen-
trator as close as possible to the edge device. The best place for the DSL
8.1 Conceptual Case Study—Greenﬁeld
233

concentrator is near the telephone switch where the splitters are located.
Ethernet switches can be used to concentrate multiple Ethernet connec-
tions from a single customer site, and it is best located on the customer
premises.
Edge Network
The edge network provides connectivity between a customer’s premises
and the backbone network of λ-Networking. It is also used to concentrate
multiple connections on a single edge device: several customer connec-
tions are terminated on the same device. Depending on the technology
and the number of customer connections, several edge devices are re-
quired in a location (PoP).
Each edge device is connected to two different core devices. This redun-
dancy is necessary to make the edge network reliable and to avoid single
points of failure. The edge device also provides the intelligence required to
build an IP network that can deliver IP-based services. The functionality
required on the edge device to deliver the differentiated services includes
the following:
1. Restricting Layer 3 bandwidth available to a customer connection
when the access network does not have capability to restrict the band-
width at Layer 2.
2. Implementing the VPN technology to provide logical (Layer 3) separa-
tion between the different Layer 3 connections that terminate on the
same edge device.
3. Implementing
QoS
functionalities
like
marking,
policing,
and
queuing.
4. Implementing accounting mechanisms like link utilization for billing
purposes.
Based on the requirements of each service, λ-Networking decided to use
a separate edge device for each of its services, namely,
Internet services, Web-hosting services
VPN services
Services like voice and video that have QoS requirements
Taking all of these requirements into account, λ-Networking has two
choices of technology for the connectivity between the edge devices and
core devices: Ethernet and POS. Table 8.2 compares the two technologies.
Based on the comparison, the cost issues, and the QoS requirements, λ-
Networking decided to use the following strategy:
1. Use packet-over-SONET when the edge device is used to support voice
and video services.
2. Use Ethernet for edge devices that support all other services.
234
Chapter 8: Case Studies

Core Network
The core network has 60 core locations, separated into two categories:
National core location (12)
Regional core location (48)
Each regional core location is dually connected to the nearest national
core location, and each national core location is connected to at least two
other national core locations.
The core network is built in a hierarchical manner. There are regional
core networks, consisting of one national core location and several re-
gional core locations. There is one national core network, consisting of all
the national core locations. In total, the core network has 12 regional core
networks and 1 national core network. The topology of the entire network
has the following characteristics (see Figure 8.3):
●
There are two links between two directly connected core locations.
●
There are multiple paths between any two core locations.
●
The maximum number of hops between any two core locations does
not exceed six. This is required to meet the end-to-end delay require-
ments of some of the services, like voice and video.
λ-Networking has a DWDM network interconnecting all 60 core loca-
tions that can support up to 10 Gb/sec. Currently, λ-Networking has de-
cided to use 10 Gb/sec links between all the national core locations. The
connection between the national core location and the regional core loca-
tion is either 2.4 Gb/sec or 622 Mb/sec, depending on the number of edge
devices at each core location and the volume of trafﬁc. Based on the

utilization of the links between the regional core and the national core,
these links may be upgraded from 622 Mb/sec to 2.4 Gb/sec.
Technologies to Support Service Creation
λ-Networking has decided to use the same core network to transport trafﬁc
from all the services. This reduces the cost of the network infrastructure.
The company will use speciﬁc technologies to support various services.
The following is a brief description of each of these technologies and the
services that they can support.
MPLS
MPLS is enabled on all the links in the core network and the links between
the edge and core devices. MPLS helps to maintain a stable core network.
Changes in the edge and access networks or an increase in the number of
customers connected to the network will not have an impact on the core
network. Moreover, MPLS helps to support VPNs based on MPLS, and also
helps to enable trafﬁc engineering in order to spread the load onto all the
core links.
MPLS-VPN
MPLS-VPN helps λ-Networking to offer VPN services to the customers us-
ing the same core network, as opposed to VPN services based on Layer 2
technologies like frame relay or ATM. Multiple customers requiring VPN
services can be connected to the same core network.
IP Security
While MPLS-VPNs guarantee that data from one customer is not visible or
accessible to another, it does not guarantee any security for the contents
236
Chapter 8: Case Studies

of an IP packet. In order to provide additional security for the contents of
IP packets, λ-Networking offers IPSec features on top of MPLS-VPNs. IPSec
not only guarantees data security, it also guarantees integrity of the data
and ensures that a third party cannot illegally access the data even if they
can access the IP packet. By using IPSec, λ-Networking can enhance their
service portfolio with additional security features.
QoS
QoS features help λ-Networking to offer differentiated services to their
customers. Customers who require guaranteed bandwidth, guaranteed
end-to-end delay, and so on, get preferential treatment over those who re-
quire only best-effort services. QoS features are also required for services
(e.g., voice) that have strict delay requirements and those (e.g., video) that
have guaranteed bandwidth requirements.
λ-Networking will enable QoS using the differentiated services model
(see Chapter 7 for more details). Enabling QoS means implementing the
following mechanisms:
●
Marking customer trafﬁc based on the services requested by the
customer
●
Classiﬁcation of customer based on the DSCP value in the IP
headerM
●
Policing the Layer 3 trafﬁc based on the bandwidth contract signed
by the customer
●
Drop mechanism to ensure that every class gets its share of the band-
width in case of congestion in the links
●
Queuing mechanism on all devices so that trafﬁc with strict delay re-
quirements is prioritized over other trafﬁc and to minimize end-to-
end delay
Classiﬁcation and policing are applied on the interfaces of edge devices
connected to the CPE. This has to be done to the edge device in case the
CPE is not managed by λ-Networking.
Queuing mechanisms are implemented in the core network and also
on the links between the core and edge devices. They are required be-
cause the core links and the link between the core and edge devices
are shared by several customer connections. In order to meet the QoS re-
quirements of the different classes, it is necessary to implement queuing
mechanisms.
QoS features like policing at Layer 3 help to limit the bandwidth avail-
able to customers for access technologies that do not support policing at
Layer 2. For example, Layer 2 technologies like Ethernet have no polic-
ing mechanism at Layer 2. So a user with 100 Mb/sec can send data at 100
Mb/sec, and it is not possible to restrict that to 10 Mb/sec at Layer 2. Using
Layer 3 policing mechanisms, it is possible to restrict the amount of band-
width available to customer connections.
8.1 Conceptual Case Study—Greenﬁeld
237

SLA Reporting
As part of the services offered to customers, λ-Networking has identiﬁed
several SLAs, which are reported to customers on a periodic basis. The
SLAs include
Availability
Guaranteed bandwidth
End-to-end delay
In order to verify that the SLAs of the customers are being honored, λ-
Networking collects information from the network devices and uses it to
calculate the SLAs and generate reporting. SNMP is used to collect the in-
formation from the network devices. The information is then fed into an
automatic SLA reporting program. These reports are posted on a Web
server, from which customers can directly access them.
Network Management and Operations
Managing the λ-Networking network plays an important role in providing
reliable services to customers. The NOC is the place from which the entire
network is operated and managed. All OSS servers and tools required to
monitor, maintain, manage, and upgrade the network are located in the
NOC. The NOC plays a crucial role in the success of the company. It is op-
erational 24 hours a day to monitor the network. As a result, it is critical
that the NOC has redundancy not only in terms of connectivity to the en-
tire network but also in terms of location.
Redundancy
λ-Networking decided to have two independent NOCs that are physically
located in two different locations. One of them is active and has connec-
tivity to the network. The other is used to back up all of the data from the
active NOC and becomes active when the active NOC loses connectivity
to the network.
Activities
The NOC is responsible for a variety of activities, including
●
Monitoring all the devices in the network and raising alarms when
the devices are not reachable
●
Monitoring the utilization of network resources, like link capacity
●
Monitoring resources on network devices, like available memory
and CPU usage
●
Conﬁguring new network devices and customer connections
●
Upgrading customer connections to higher speeds
●
Performing software upgrades on network devices
238
Chapter 8: Case Studies

Service Implementation Model
As mentioned in Section 8.1.5, one of the key features of the OSS systems
is automation. λ-Networking wants to automate service provisioning, ser-
vice upgrades, SLA reporting, and various other activities so that it can in-
crease its customer base rapidly and also penetrate the rapidly expanding
market. This section presents an example of how a company automates
service upgrade requests.
Service Upgrades
λ-Networking will provide customers with a Web-based interface to up-
grade their services. One such service upgrade is the bandwidth require-
ment between the CPE and the edge device. Customers get a periodic re-
port of the link and bandwidth utilization, after which they can decide to
upgrade the link speed to a higher capacity. This can be easily done using
a Web-based interface (compared to a manual upgrade by an operator) be-
cause the Web-based interface helps to automate the service upgrade and
reduce the risks of errors due to manual intervention. (See Chapter 6 for
more information on this topic.)
The following steps are involved in an online service upgrade (see Fig-
ure 8.4):
1. Customer logs on to the Web-based tool using a login name and
password.
2. Customer chooses the link that requires the bandwidth upgrade.
3. The new link bandwidth is speciﬁed by the customer.
4. The tool veriﬁes that the new bandwidth is applicable to the link and
that there is enough available capacity on the link.

5. The new conﬁguration is created for both the edge and CPE devices.
6. An SNMP-based tool applies these changes to the concerned devices.
7. A report is sent to the customer and to the billing department once the
service upgrade is completed successfully.
The entire service upgrade, starting from the customer’s request up to
notifying the customer and billing department, should not take more
than 30 minutes. Thus, such a Web-based interface will reduce the time re-
quired to upgrade a service, compared to upgrading manually, which may
take as long as a week before the upgrade information is sent to all the rel-
evant departments and the customer. The Web-based interface will also
help to reduce the mistakes due to manual conﬁguration. This in turn will
help λ-Networking to rapidly deploy services and have a larger share of the
market. In conclusion, a fully automated OSS system is crucial for rapid
deployment of IP-based services.
8.1.9
Assessing Project Risks
Building a new backbone, developing new services, and contracting with
customers to buy these services is risky for any Greenﬁeld service pro-
vider, since these factors require an investment in resources such as in-
frastructure, people, and return on this investment. Some risks in the
λ-Networking project include lack of technology and products to deploy
services, insufﬁcient customer base to buy the services, and lack of money
to continue the business. Lack of name recognition is also a risk for a
Greenﬁeld service provider such as λ-Networking since customers can be
reluctant to contract with an unknown alternative provider. Applying due
diligence to the marketing plan and business case are ways to mitigate the
risks. As an example, it is not enough to build a backbone and hope that
customers will throng, often termed in the telecommunications environ-
ment as a “build and they will come” approach. Conﬁrming that there is a
business opportunity via services is the key to risk reduction.
8.1.10
Lessons Learned
The λ-Networking strategy is aggressive and high-risk. The company em-
barked on its approach since it believed (and still does) that it is only a
matter of precious time before incumbents start to deploy a wide range of
services, especially bundled options based on IP. The λ-Networking experi-
ence outlined in this case study is a composite of the experiences of several
CLECs that have undertaken a similar strategy. It is not IP-based technology
that drives sound business practices but rather solid corporate governance.
8.1.11
Future Plans
The company continues to work with their select technology leaders in
order to assure that the network will evolve with the required services.
240
Chapter 8: Case Studies

This translates to having not only the technology available but also the
vendor products needed to support future services. The company plans to
extend the network internationally at a later stage and expects to enhance
its product portfolio to include e-commerce, speciﬁcally offering a man-
aged e-commerce portal service as an extension to Web hosting.
8.1.12
Conclusion
The λ-Networking experience shows how IP is the driver for building ser-
vices and can be used to deploy services. In the case study, IP-based ser-
vices catalyzed revenue and cost improvements for λ-Networking. The
next section presents a conceptual case study depicting an incumbent.
The incumbent example considers other challenging issues, such as the
existence of multiple networks, legacy infrastructure, and millions of ex-
isting customers. How can IP possibly be implemented to develop and de-
ploy services without adversely impacting these existing customers? What
approach can be taken, if any? These questions and alternatives are ex-
plored in the next section.
8.2 Conceptual Case Study—Incumbent
The company in this conceptual case study is one of the oldest incum-
bents in the United States. The case study examines how IP-based technol-
ogy has driven the development of new services and created better uni-
formity of operations and delivery of these new services to transform
the company’s business from a focus on voice-only services to a focus
on value-added services such as Internet access, Web hosting, corporate
VPNs, and e-commerce.
8.2.1
Background
The company in this case study is an East Coast–based incumbent that
consists of separate business subsidiaries with a focus on wireless, broad-
band, and retail, as well as data and voice (as opposed to wholesale ser-
vices such as selling bandwidth only). The company is referred to as
Traditiontel, Inc. It has approximately 85,000 employees, and its stock is
traded openly on the stock market. In 1997 Traditiontel, Inc., had re-
ported that voice, namely, long distance, dominated the data services that
were emerging at that time. From 1998 to the end of 2001, the company
experienced a decline in long-distance voice and an increase in data, or
packetized, trafﬁc. This decline translated into an approximately $18 bil-
lion loss. The increase in data trafﬁc is attributed to the enterprise custom-
ers driving e-business applications such as CRM, converged voice and
data, and so on, since these customers are pressured to execute business
applications efﬁciently in order to minimize costs and maximize revenue.
8.2 Conceptual Case Study—Incumbent
241

The alternative for Traditiontel customers is to maintain separate corpo-
rate networks for such applications.
Traditiontel possesses legacy infrastructure and a large customer base
of over six million customers, both domestic and international. This leg-
acy infrastructure consists of PSTN for voice, frame relay and ATM for
data access, as well as broadband and wireless. The focus of this case study
is on the company’s decision to embark on a “nondisruptive” service
consolidation strategy of cap and grow—that is, retaining the existing in-
frastructure but growing new services on a next-generation, multiservice,
high-speed IP backbone. Traditiontel launched this strategy at the begin-
ning of 2000.
Traditiontel constructed an IP-based national infrastructure between
2000 and 2001 that includes multiple OC-48/STM-16 (2.5 Gb/sec) and
OC-192/STM-64 (10 Gb/sec) interofﬁce trunk facilities. The core topology
consists of approximately 80,500 kilometers (50,000 miles) of ﬁber-optic
cable and approximately 75 SONET rings that offer self-healing capabili-
ties. The company has been enhancing this network to include an addi-
tional 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles) of ﬁber capable of operating at
OC-192 as well as OC-768/STM-256 speeds.
The target customers for Traditiontel’s IP-based services are small to me-
dium enterprises as well as large enterprises. The company offers Web
hosting, managed host services, VPN service of intranets and extranets,
voice-over-IP, IP-enabled faxing, and so on. These service packages may be
purchased as bundled services. A consolidated bill for bundled services is
not yet available. Traditiontel plans to have a consolidated invoicing sys-
tem in place at the end of 2002. Billing is either ﬂat rate, usage based, or a
combination, depending on such factors as number of users within an
end-customer environment. Price discounts are available, and these vary
with both volume and usage.
This conceptual case study represents an incumbent approach to using
IP for evolving a current business strategy based on legacy systems, and re-
positioning a company as a state-of-the-art service provider using IP-based
technology to develop and deploy services. This state-of-the-art character
manifests itself in the home page of the service provider, where a cus-
tomer can place orders, participate in a tutorial on a speciﬁc technology,
and study white papers written about technical issues and service applica-
tions. There is an interactive question-and-answer application for the cus-
tomer to use that is online. Measuring the proﬁtability impact of these ser-
vices is also part of this conceptual case study.
8.2.2
Business Aspects
Traditiontel has been in a transformation process that commenced in
1998. The company introduced new leadership at that time to enact
much-needed change. It had been focused on long-distance voice, but
242
Chapter 8: Case Studies

customers were requiring more and more data services. In response to
these market requirements, the competition was developing digital net-
work infrastructures, while the long-distance voice was becoming a com-
modity, resulting in revenue loss for Traditiontel. The company was fur-
ther burdened with an inﬂated cost structure in comparison to its
competition.
The company at that time decided to convert its network into a packet-
based network with intelligence located at the edge. Traditiontel trans-
formed its disjointed local, analog cellular systems into a digital wireless
network. To address the inﬂated cost structure, it removed about $3.5 bil-
lion in costs out of the core long-distance business over a period of ap-
proximately four years. Toward the end of 2000, the company created four
business units, focused on wireless, broadband, residential, and business.
Customer Requirements
The Traditiontel strategy is to retain its current business customer base
while attracting new customers. Current business customers typically sub-
scribe to several services, such as frame relay and ATM as well as IP-based
VPN and managed hosts. These customers require both a bundled service
option and a single bill. This requirement is actually no different from the
target customer base of the CLECs and applies therefore to all potential
customers. Finally, the price structure must not be complex, especially for
value-added services such as metro Ethernet or business-class VPN. Cus-
tomer requirements may be summarized as follows:
Bundled service option with single bill
Security and reliability
Cost-effective propositions for value-added services
Less complex dealings that do not impact capital expenditure
The customers range from small and medium enterprises to very large
enterprises. Customer applications include data, voice, email, Web brows-
ing, videoconferencing, and e-commerce applications. The customers re-
quire that the VPN service be secure, reliable, and capable of service dif-
ferentiation between voice and data. They do not want to subscribe to
a service that is feature-rich but difﬁcult to implement. They want to un-
derstand whether or not a VPN-like service is appropriate to their own
networking environment and expect recommendations from the service
provider about the appropriateness of a VPN service within an existing
customer network. This requires that Traditiontel understand the end-
customer business drivers in order to act in an advisory capacity. Finally,
migrating a customer network to an IP-based service should not result in
additional capital expenditure for the end customer.
8.2 Conceptual Case Study—Incumbent
243

Traditiontel’s Strategic Objectives
The top strategic objectives for Traditiontel may be summarized as
follows:
Scalability
Integration
Security
Reliability
Traditiontel intends to be a low-cost service provider that offers an end-to-
end service portfolio to its customers. The network infrastructure must
scale to both domestic as well as international enterprise business custom-
ers. For Traditiontel, the customer forecast is approximately one billion
customers worldwide. The company has observed that in the domestic
market, IP connectivity (VPN, Web hosting, managed host services) has
grown over 200% from 2000 to 2001. Because of the transition from voice
to IP and the wide use of e-business applications, scalability is a key re-
quirement for Traditiontel, as evidenced by the growth trends.
Integration for Traditiontel means the capability to develop and sup-
port multiservices based on IP. Providing an integrated service bundle
with a single bill is a requirement for the company. The OSS billing com-
ponent must be able to invoice for IP-based services. The mediation sys-
tem has to create price records based on IP-centric elements such as bytes,
ToS (for QoS) instead of the traditional voice minutes rating structure. An
extended requirement for Traditiontel is to be able to create an electronic
bill, or e-bill, that will have the look and feel of a credit card invoice.
Security is a requirement for Traditiontel since it is using a shared infra-
structure to develop and provision services for multiple customers. Be-
cause IP is used as a base to develop these service packages, customers
want the assurance that these services are as secure as the existing frame
relay and ATM. Customer VPNs must not be compromised due to miscre-
ant users. Note that the service provider may compromise a frame relay
customer VPN due to a misconﬁguration. Whether frame relay–based or
IP-based, the integrity of the overall network infrastructure must not be
destroyed due to security violations or service provider–induced miscon-
ﬁgurations.
Finally, reliability is an important requirement for Traditiontel since it
offers a minimum of network availability of 99.99% to its customers. In
order to assure the network availability target, redundancy in both ﬁber
installations as well as in PoPs must be implemented. Vendor software
and hardware must be “carrier class.” This means that failure in a vendor
component or software cannot adversely impact the overall function of
the network. Traditiontel offers SLAs to its customers with low-latency
guarantees that average between 70 milliseconds nationally between two
244
Chapter 8: Case Studies

locations. Finally, the company guarantees that domestic average packet
loss will not exceed 0.5%.
8.2.3
IP-Based Solution
The IP-based solution for Traditiontel consists of several facets, including
business, technology, and the service architecture. The pivotal business as-
pects driving the IP-based solution service architecture for Traditiontel in-
clude a shift from voice to IP and the impact of this shift on the service
creation model. Under the shift from voice to IP, the subsequent packag-
ing of IP-based services for the end customer is examined. The impact of
IP-based services on the overall OSS architecture as it pertains to the ser-
vice creation model is also explored.
8.2.4
Services
The business transformation that commenced in 1998 has been rapid for
such an old incumbent provider. At the end of 2000, as the high-speed IP-
based infrastructure was being constructed, Traditiontel planned a series
of IP-based service packages to be created and launched throughout 2001
and 2002. The clear motivation of this strategy was to address pressure
on cash ﬂow resulting from the commoditization of long-distance voice.
The services range from IP-VPN with an option for integrated voice to e-
commerce services. Services, particularly the integrated managed bundles,
offer unlimited domestic on-net and off-net calling to end customers.
These services are managed IP-VPN with options for voice-over-IP, video-
conferencing, and fax-over-IP, as well as Internet access; managed Internet
with options for voice-over-IP; managed ﬁrewall hosting with network-
based, router-based, and server-based options; managed intrusion detec-
tion and scanning services; LAN management; and managed host services
that include e-commerce options.
Customer access possibilities for IP-VPN services are leased line, frame
relay, ATM, Ethernet, and integrated voice and data. Usage reports are
available to the customer via a Web interface. The managed service pro-
vides 24/7 coverage. The SLA to the customer is that if Traditiontel misses
a performance target, the company will reimburse the end customer by
providing a three-day credit to the monthly connection charge. The com-
pany guarantees a T1 Internet access within 30 business days, a T3 Inter-
net access within 40 business days, and an OC-3 Internet access within
60 business days. Failure to provision within these speciﬁed intervals
will result in a credit for the installation fee that is subject to regulation.
Bandwidth-on-demand service options will be available at the end of
2002. Table 8.3 depicts a service bundle example for e-commerce and
hosting for the small to medium enterprise segment.
The bundled e-commerce and host option permits an enterprise to sell
products directly to its customers via a Web site hosted by Traditiontel.
8.2 Conceptual Case Study—Incumbent
245

The service supports real-time credit card transactions for the end cus-
tomer’s products, which are to be sold via this hosted site. With regard to
Web hosting, Traditiontel sponsored a study that indicates that a typical
Web surfer who attempts to navigate will lose interest after approximately
10 seconds. After that time, a number of these users will either go to an-
other site or abort the transaction. Both actions result in a loss of potential
revenue for Traditiontel (estimated revenue loss is approximately $4 bil-
lion). In response to this performance factor, Traditiontel has evolved
trafﬁc management from frame relay and ATM to IP. The company is mov-
ing to trafﬁc management above IP in order to examine the packet layer,
thus creating a content-aware trafﬁc management service architecture. An
enterprise customer may also order a dedicated server for a Web site and
have this server delivered within 30 minutes of placing the order.
Traditiontel offers a metro Ethernet service over its high-speed, ﬁber-
optic network that also has self-healing SONET rings available in 120 met-
ropolitan areas in 40 states. Self-healing means that the rings are able to
recover in case of a network failure, so there should be no service loss to
customers. (This is further explained in Chapter 5.) The Ethernet connec-
tivity is up to 500 Mb/sec. Table 8.4 depicts an example of the metro
Ethernet service connectivity options.
The customer selects a connectivity option (e.g., between two loca-
tions point to point) and chooses the bandwidth required between these

locations (e.g., 50 Mb/sec). The customer can select bandwidth up to 500
Mb/sec with a full gigabit Ethernet to be a future offering. The self-healing
characteristic of the network that provides this service ensures network re-
liability by providing redundancy. Network reliability is dependent on the
architecture. The high-speed, IP-based network infrastructure has redun-
dant ﬁber connections that do not traverse the same conduit. The PoPs in
the core as well as the metro areas are redundant such that a failure in one
area does impact the service in another area.
This network architecture has been constructed with scalability as a
basis for servicing approximately 20 million customers. The high-speed
ﬁber optics is OC-768–capable and enhances the scalability feature of the
network infrastructure. The national network is coast-to-coast OC-192
backbone.
Traditiontel subscribes to quarterly security audits on its network infra-
structure for assessment of the best practices and implementations re-
quired for its customers. The IP-VPN service also includes an IPSec option.
Disaster recovery for managed data servers is possible with four mirrored
data centers located in the East Coast, Central, South, and West Coast
regions.
8.2.5
Service Implementation Model
The problem with enhancing the legacy OSS infrastructure is that there
are multiple systems that correspond to separate services. Traditiontel felt
that it would be effective and least disruptive to existing services to
construct a next-generation OSS architecture. The task has been most

challenging as the company had to outsource the architectural develop-
ment to third-party vendors with an expertise in OSS. The key require-
ment for Traditiontel is nondependency on vendor-proprietary applica-
tions. The new OSS architecture includes customer care, business
engineering, billing, reporting, and new service creation.
At the end of 2000, Traditiontel planned to launch three services per
year. This requirement meant that the service creation process had to be
fully automated across the business organization and not limited to geo-
graphic locations. A service to be created is triggered by a Traditiontel
product manager articulating a need that was expressed by a customer.
(This customer can request a service online, and this service request is then
sent to the product manager). The user interface is Web based. A business
opportunity proﬁle pops up as a window for the product manager to com-
plete. Parameters include whether the service is new or an enhancement;
revenue opportunity between 9 and 12 months; customer proﬁle, such as
key customers requesting the service; the account team driving the service
creation; proposed service description and pricing (draft format); identi-
ﬁcation of competitors; base technology; known suppliers offering a prod-
uct that can be used to develop the service; and, ﬁnally, estimated cost to
develop the service and the required timing for it to go to market. The pro-
posed service should also specify the target customer segment.
The completed proﬁle is routed to the heads of sales and marketing, en-
gineering and services architecture, service and network management,
and business engineering for review, approval, and resource reservation.
Turnaround time for a yes or no response is 10 working days. If the re-
sponse is yes, a meeting is organized using collaborative tools to launch
the service development project. If the response is no, the service request
is ﬁled on a dashboard indicating date and reason for an audit trail in case
the subject surfaces in the future.
Traditiontel expects that any new service pilot is not to exceed one
month in order to validate the overall service model and to assure that the
invoicing processes are ready. There is a service life cycle proﬁle that
the product manager completes. It includes such parameters as testing
and validation, service launch, full service acceptance by the market,
commoditization (when competitors ﬂood the market with similar offer-
ings), and service end. These are estimates based on experience and mar-
ket trends. The output is distributed to the vice presidents of sales and
marketing, engineering and services architecture, and operations. These
managers execute a due diligence on the new service in order to minimize
possible negative impacts on Traditiontel.
Two key proﬁles are completed at the same time by the product man-
ager: a business opportunity proﬁle and a service life cycle proﬁle. These
two proﬁles represent the business case. Other proﬁles, such as new ser-
vice training and provisioning requirements, are also integrated into the
248
Chapter 8: Case Studies

Traditiontel service creation model. The service creation model also in-
cludes an application for the sales force that automates responses to re-
quests for proposal.
In 2001 Traditiontel launched four main services: the business-class IP-
VPN with options; managed hosting with options; integrated voice and
data; and Internet with option for voice-over-IP. The single bill for bun-
dled services will be available at the end of 2002. Traditiontel is planning
to move from a bandwidth-based tariff structure to a transaction-based
model. An example of this model would be a customer who needs to set
up a videoconference in one hour; the customer pays for the bandwidth
use during that hour.
8.2.6
Company Performance
How did Traditiontel perform from 1998 to 2001, with the new-services
launch in 2001? The company spent three years upgrading its network
infrastructure and building a new core and metro edge. A new OSS infra-
structure was also developed and deployed during this period. The com-
pany spent approximately $30 billion during this period and experienced
a shift in revenue from long-distance voice to IP. The volume of IP data
doubled in 2000 from 1999. The IP-based trafﬁc growth averaged a 200%
increase from 2000 to 2001. The managed hosting growth averaged 50%
quarterly over the year 2001. Finally, from 2000 to 2001, the quarterly av-
erage revenue increase was 50%, in sync with the customer trafﬁc pattern.
Traditiontel observed a continued trend toward debt reduction from
2000 to 2001 and believes that its business transformation strategy has
paid off. The company has evolved from a long-distance voice-centric
company to an IP-based services company. The company used this period
to assure that the business-engineering processes were common across the
organization. Finally, essential to this business transformation was the
emphasis on the OSS architecture and infrastructure. Service creation has
been automated to facilitate the target of three new services per year.
8.2.7
Alternatives Considered
Rather than build out a new network infrastructure, Traditiontel could
have considered investing in its legacy infrastructure to support these IP-
based services. The company evaluated this alternative but concluded that
it would be too complex for integration, as well as possibly disruptive to
existing customers. The legacy services have been performing well for
Traditiontel, but the company decided not to invest further in the legacy
infrastructure. The pivotal driver was OSS: These services have separate
OSS systems, and integrating these OSS systems was not possible due to
the existence of vendor-proprietary applications.
8.2 Conceptual Case Study—Incumbent
249

8.2.8
Vendor Selection Process
Traditiontel has a multiple-vendor policy. The company does not want
to be tied to a speciﬁc vendor, since this dependency carries risks (e.g.,
longevity of the supplier in the market, product pricing). Traditiontel sup-
pliers are selected on the basis of technology and product leadership; es-
tablished presence in the service provider market; commitment to devel-
oping products that will assure new service creation; and product and
support pricing that will not be prohibitive to end customers. Interoper-
ability as per open standards is a requirement for Traditiontel.
The company has established relationships with the some of these sup-
pliers. For this project, Traditiontel sent out an RFI to ﬁve suppliers. (RFIs
are discussed in Chapter 3.) Based on the response, the list was narrowed
down to three. A similar process was also launched for the new-generation
OSS architecture. Three supplier candidates were invited to present to up-
per management as well as to the service creation team members. The RFI
scope was for core and metro-edge network infrastructure as well as OSS
architecture.
After the presentations and internal discussions, Traditiontel selected
two suppliers, a primary and a secondary. This selection was based on sup-
plier response as well as Traditiontel agreement. A primary systems inte-
grator was chosen to deliver the OSS architecture. Traditiontel stipulated
that OSS must be part of the service lab testing and validation. The core
and metro-edge primary and secondary suppliers must also prove inter-
operability in the Traditiontel labs for service rollout.
8.2.9
Technical Aspects
The IP-based network of Traditiontel has to support several services. Reli-
ability, scalability, and stability are some of the factors that must be taken
into account when designing the network. A hierarchical approach (simi-
lar to the architecture in Figure 8.2) is the best solution to make the net-
work reliable, stable, scalable, and capable of supporting multiservices (see
Section 8.1.8; this is also discussed in Chapter 5).
Network Architecture
Traditiontel has OC-192 links in the core, which gives about 10 Gb/sec be-
tween the core locations. The ﬁber-optic network is capable of supporting
up to 40 Gb/sec, which allows for future expansion. This makes the net-
work scalable because it allows the addition of new customers without ad-
ditions of new links or bandwidth upgrade to the core network.
Multiple connections between core locations make the network more
reliable and avoid single points of failure (link and node failure) in the net-
work. Any single link or node failure will not partition the network. This
250
Chapter 8: Case Studies

means that end-to-end physical connectivity is not affected by failure of
any single link or node.
Limiting the maximum hop count between core locations also helps to
place a deterministic bound on the maximum end-to-end delay. Delay-
sensitive applications such as voice have requirements like upper bounds
on the end-to-end delay. One of several factors that affect end-to-end de-
lay is the number of hops between the source and the destination. By lim-
iting the number of hops between core locations, it is possible to predict
the maximum end-to-end delay between any two points in the network.
OSS Architecture
The OSS architecture is critical for the development and deployment of IP-
based services. Given the time frame required to develop such services,
the OSS architecture plays a crucial role in the success of providing IP-
based services to customers. Its departments include
●
Business and marketing: Responsible for deﬁning the business aspect
of the service like pricing, service options, time to market, and so on.
●
Sales: Responsible for selling the IP-based services to customers,
maintaining customer contact, and getting the requirements and in-
formation from customers that are necessary for implementing the
services.
●
Engineering: Responsible for developing and testing the technical
solutions.
●
NMS: Responsible for developing the NMS tools required for mass
deployment of the service, service upgrades, billing, and SLA reports.
●
NOC: Responsible for deploying the service, monitoring the net-
work, and ensuring that the SLAs are reported to the customer.
●
Billing: Responsible for billing the customer for the IP-based services.
The OSS architecture must be capable of supporting the needs of all of
these departments. It is responsible for ensuring that information from
one department is readily available to other departments. The informa-
tion ﬂow and communication between the various departments is the key
to the successful, rapid development and deployment of new services.
(More details about OSS requirements are discussed in Chapter 6.)
Automation
Automation plays a key role in the OSS architecture. Manual intervention
or interpretation can be cumbersome and time-consuming and is also
prone to mistakes. Information from several departments must be pro-
cessed and veriﬁed for consistency. Information ﬂow from one depart-
ment to the other must also be automated. The output from the processes
of one department is the input to the processes of another department.
8.2 Conceptual Case Study—Incumbent
251

Automating this information ﬂow can help to reduce the time required
to develop and deploy services. The following sections give some exam-
ples to highlight the role of information-ﬂow automation in the OSS
architecture.
Device Conﬁguration
The engineering department has the ownership of the conﬁguration
guidelines for the network devices for each service. These guidelines are
ﬁnalized based on tests performed in the engineering labs. The conﬁgura-
tion on the device for each service is tested extensively in the labs for cor-
rect functionality. The conﬁguration guidelines are then forwarded to the
NOC to be implemented into the deployment tool, which is responsi-
ble for conﬁguring the network devices. Automation of this process will
help to reduce the time required to generate the conﬁguration for the net-
work devices once the guidelines are ﬁnalized. It also helps to reduce the
time required for modiﬁcation when the engineering department pro-
poses new conﬁguration guidelines for all the network devices.
Service Deployment
Traditiontel wants to offer fast service deployment with penalties (see Sec-
tion 8.2.4). This means that if the service deployment is not performed
within the speciﬁed time period, Traditiontel has to give credits to the cus-
tomer. In order to ensure that service deployment proceeds on time, it is
important to have available all the information that is required to deploy
the service for a new customer.
As an example, an IP address plan is an important input that is required
to ﬁnalize the conﬁguration of the network devices before a service can be
deployed for a new customer. This information is provided by the cus-
tomer to the sales department. Most of the time, lack of an IP address plan
is the cause of delay for service deployment. This information has to be
provided to the deployment tool in order to generate the conﬁguration
for the network devices that are relevant to the new customer. The sales
process must be automated such that the IP address plan from the cus-
tomer is available to the OSS system early enough. The deployment tool
can then generate the conﬁguration for the network devices and help to
deploy the service for the new customer on time.
Service Upgrades
Traditiontel also wants to minimize the time required to perform a service
upgrade. The customer is provided with a Web-based interface to upgrade
services. Once a request is received from the customer, the OSS system
proceeds with the upgrade, updates the SLA reporting tool for the cus-
tomer (if it is relevant), and informs the billing department about the up-
graded service so that the customer can be billed accordingly.
252
Chapter 8: Case Studies

As described in Section 8.2.4, a customer wants to add a new server for
Web hosting, and within 30 minutes after placing the order, the server is
made available to the customer. Unless the OSS system is integrated with
the Web-based system that takes the service upgrade request from the
customer, it will not be possible to perform the service upgrade in 30
minutes.
In conclusion, the OSS architecture plays a key role in developing new
services and also for rapid deployment of new services. An integrated,
fully automated approach to the OSS system is a must in order to achieve
the target for delivering IP-based services. Web-based interfaces will make
life easy both for customers and Traditiontel.
8.2.10
Assessing Project Risks
Similar to the Greenﬁeld service example, lack of vendor product, tech-
nology availability, and customers to sign up for these new IP-based ser-
vices are risks for an incumbent. Another risk factor includes service dif-
ferentiation against Greenﬁeld service providers, who offer similar
services (termed in marketing the “me too” strategy). Emphasis on pro-
viding value-added services reduces this risk for both incumbents and
Greenﬁeld service providers. Finally, outsourcing the development of a
next-generation OSS architecture to a third party has risks, such as manag-
ing the project itself and ensuring that development is per speciﬁcation,
within budget, and as per the project plan. There is also risk of revenue
loss in not using IP to develop value-added services, as the company had
been losing revenue on long-distance voice over a period of several years.
A clear vision of the company business, due diligence on the marketing
plan and business case, and acting decisively in order to mitigate risks are
success factors in this project.
8.2.11
Lessons Learned
The business engineering processes have to be aligned with transforming
a business strategy. This requires a person with experience in multiservice
operations and service management who is both technically and busi-
ness savvy. One recommendation is to include personnel with established
backgrounds in operations at the senior management level in order to
facilitate changes—for service management, for example, a senior vice
president of operations. This person should drive the goal to unify opera-
tions via IP-based technology. To evolve a business strategy based on IP
means training the personnel who will support these new IP-based ser-
vices, as some of them will have a background in other technologies and
services like ATM, frame relay, and voice. This is important to successful
IP-based service development and deployment.
8.2 Conceptual Case Study—Incumbent
253

8.2.12
Future Plans
Traditiontel plans to reduce capital expenditure throughout 2002. At the
same time, new IP-based services will continue to be developed and
launched. A single bill for bundled services will also be available in 2002.
In 2003 and beyond, Traditiontel has a target to be number one in non-
voice business by capturing the most customers.
8.2.13
Conclusion
The Traditiontel case study is an example of how an incumbent uses IP to
transform a conservative business. There are general perceptions that an
incumbent is slow and burdened with heavy processes that may need to
be linked across the company. While some of this may be true, leadership
at a company like Traditiontel can jump-start the necessary changes.
The next section presents a real-life case study of a European incum-
bent that embarked on a road similar to that of Traditiontel. Why did
a conservative incumbent in Europe want to develop IP-based services?
What was the motivation for this change in strategy? What were the is-
sues? The challenges?
8.3 Real-Life Case Study
The conceptual case studies in the previous sections are composites from
actual deployments, based on the experiences of U.S. service providers.
This section presents an anonymous real-life case study. It looks at an in-
cumbent in Europe and, as a real case study, provides more details into the
organizational dynamics of developing IP-based services. (Nondisclosure
agreements prevent us from actually naming the service provider.) The
case is an example of an early adopter of IP-based services by an incum-
bent in Europe. The processes that resulted in a decision to develop and
deploy IP-based services are also discussed. Finally, the impact that IP-
based service has had on this company is also discussed. This case study
applies globally and is not restricted to Europe.
8.3.1
Background
We refer to the European provider in this case study as Meta Telecom.
Meta Telecom is a European incumbent with 100 years of history and 90%
of the domestic market for telecommunications services. It is based in
central Europe and has approximately 20,000 employees. One competi-
tive driver to open up the domestic market to new competition is the deci-
sion by the European Union as well as the national regulatory agency to
unbundle the local loop. Meta Telecom has resisted this requirement and
has requested implementation delay from the national regulatory agency.
254
Chapter 8: Case Studies

The case study commences at a time of change for Meta Telecom. The
impetus of this change was from company leadership, who wanted rapid
privatization of the provider, believing that a totally private company
could be ﬂexible enough to compete in a market that was becoming open
for new players.
At the end of 1998, Meta Telecom consisted of several business divi-
sions, such as carrier, wholesale, mobile, and enterprise. The carrier group
provided transmission and voice services; the wholesale unit offered in-
frastructure services for telehousing, broadband connectivity, and band-
width reseller services; the enterprise group provided Internet access,
frame relay, remote access, and LAN connection-over-frame relay.
Meta Telecom had been reviewing its cost structure for services such as
voice and data. There had been discussions regarding the network infra-
structure requirements for the future Universal Mobile Telecommunica-
tions System (UMTS). UMTS is a third-generation technology that is capa-
ble of delivering broadband at speeds of up to 2 Mb/sec in the form of
voice, data, audio, and video. These services were to be available at the be-
ginning of 2002. Discussions pursued a “what if” exercise for a converged
voice, data, and UMTS platform.
Service creation was cumbersome and not standard across the business
units. The enterprise organization implemented the concept of tollgates
(as discussed in Chapter 2). No collaborative tools other than email and
ﬁle sharing were implemented by Meta Telecom during this period. A
company intranet was under development at the end of 1998. The enter-
prise sales force was frustrated with the service development process as it
was “too slow” and took an approach of aggressively selling customized
solutions in order to pull the service development process. This translated
to “selling a solution now” and “developing the service later.” This ap-
proach frustrated the service development team, which consisted of en-
gineering, operations, and product management, since the approach
conﬂicted with deﬁned processes. Consequently, there was inﬁghting be-
tween the sales and service development teams.
It is in this environment that a very strategic customer, an interna-
tional bank, approached Meta Telecom with a proposition. The proposi-
tion was to engage Meta Telecom as a business and service partner over a
period of ﬁve years to develop and deploy IP-based services. The customer
referred to this value proposition as the “multimedia plug.” The term de-
picts multiservices over one physical connection. The customer wanted
the ﬁrst service fully deployed by the end of September 1999.
8.3.2
Business Aspects
At the end of 1998, Meta Telecom entered into a contract with the strate-
gic customer to develop this multimedia plug. In January 1999, a project
team consisting of various members from Meta Telecom business units
8.3 Real-Life Case Study
255

was created with a goal to develop the ﬁrst IP-based service. The cross-
functional team members were from sales and marketing, product man-
agement, engineering, operations, and ﬁnance, and the team had execu-
tive sponsorship at the CEO level. This meant that resource issues would
be resolved with full management support, escalating directly to the CEO.
Meta Telecom engaged a consulting company to work with the project
team on the ﬁnancial analysis for the service development initiatives as
well as expected revenues from these services over the next three years.
The ﬁnancial analysis methods included net present value and return on
investment, in order to determine whether to retain the existing infra-
structure or construct a new network.
Customer Requirements
The customer subscribed to LAN connection-over-frame relay serving
numerous locations. The business database applications of the customer
were based on proprietary protocols. Two main requirements emerged
from this customer: The ﬁrst was a decision to migrate the business appli-
cations from proprietary protocols to IP. This decision was motivated by
the fact that the costs for application and operating system licensing were
increasing. There was a need for an open architecture to support a variety
of groupware applications such as hypertext for linking text documents
to each other for multiple-person access (e.g., the Web; collaborative writ-
ing systems, workﬂow systems, newsgroups, electronic whiteboards, and
video communications). The strategic customer had just merged with an
international insurance company, driving the requirement for collabora-
tive tools. The company knew that a migration to IP would require an
evolution strategy.
A second requirement was to provide service-rich connectivity that
supports multiservices such as any-to-any connectivity, bandwidth up-
grades, voice-over-IP, and so on. The ﬁrst service was to provide “any-to-
any” communications to numerous locations, in the thousands. This ser-
vice was to be attractively priced—that is, a minimum of 10% cheaper
than the LAN connection-over-frame relay service. Bandwidth should be
able to provide 155 Mb/sec access. The customer also wanted to change
its bandwidth via a Web interface with the bandwidth change to occur
within 24 hours. Finally, the delivery of the new services and their en-
hancements should be quicker than the LAN connection-over-frame relay
service by 50%—instead of eight weeks for provisioning, a minimum of
four weeks.
Table 8.5 provides an overview of the old service, LAN connection-
over-frame relay. The service prices are depicted in Table 8.6. The pricing
reﬂects recurring base charges only for 200 remote sites for the customer.
The monthly recurring charges for this customer were $1,100,000 per
month:

for 200 remote sites at 5 sites/connection, $10,000 × 40 = $400,000
(this is without oversubscription of frame relay bandwidth)
The connectivity was based on hub-and-spoke topology, with no re-
quirement for the other sites to communicate with one another. The cus-
tomer requirements may be summarized as follows:
Migration from proprietary protocols to IP
Service-rich offering
Bandwidth support for 155 Mb/sec
Ability to change bandwidth on demand
Minimum of 10% less expensive than LAN connection-over-frame
relay
Reduction of provisioning time by 50%
Any-to-any connectivity
As stated, the ﬁrst service had to be ready in nine months to start the
provisioning for the new locations. The existing customer frame relay
sites were to be migrated upon completion of the new locations. Total

provisioning was to be completed by the end of March 2000, with service
sign-off on April 1, 2000. All locations were domestic.
Meta Network
The primary goal for Meta Telecom was the time to market for this new
service as per contract. Failing to deliver this service would result in the
loss of a very strategic customer. A secondary goal was to ensure that there
was a wider market for these IP-based services. The main issue here was to
understand the market requirements as an input to the network architec-
ture. How scalable must this network be? A third goal was that the new
service must not cannibalize the existing LAN connection-over-frame re-
lay service. Service positioning must be clear. LAN connection-over-frame
relay still was in demand with over 10,000 customer sites connected. A
fourth goal was that a new network infrastructure would be used as the
base for converging services over time, as determined by each business
case. Finally, the OSS architecture had to support the development and
provisioning of these new IP-based service packages. Meta Telecom goals
may be summarized as follows:
Service time to market for the strategic customer
Wider market for the new service
Not to cannibalize LAN connection-over-frame relay
Network infrastructure to be a base for service convergence
OSS architecture for new IP-based service development and deployment
Quick service delivery for the customer without sacriﬁcing reliability
was also an important factor for Meta Telecom, who had a target to main-
tain 99.99% service availability. The team recognized that the overall proj-
ect would change Meta Telecom as a company. This project was the ﬁrst
one involving all of the major cross-functional entities of Meta Telecom
and had visibility at the CEO level.
Service Time to Market
The requirement for this new service to be ready by September 1999 was
daunting. This fact was due to the lack of consistent service development
processes across the company. Meta Telecom not only was confronted
with a service target but also had a requirement to quickly deﬁne a cross-
organizational service development process that would achieve the time-
to-market goal.
Wider Market
In January 1999, the project team requested a list of the top 10 customers
for the ﬁrst IP-based service, called LAN connection-over-IP. Sales and mar-
keting forecasted the quantity of connections per customer over three
258
Chapter 8: Case Studies

years, and these connections exceeded 100,000: 600 connections were ex-
pected at the end of 1999, 10,000 were anticipated at the end of 2000;
50,000 were expected at the end of 2001; and 70,000 were expected at the
end of 2002. The conclusion by the team was that there was a wider mar-
ket for these IP-based service packages.
Scalability
These connections were used to derive the network architecture require-
ments for scalability. Frame relay was discounted as a base architecture
due to the service bandwidth requirements of 155 Mb/sec and the any-to-
any connectivity that would have made the cost prohibitive. The team
evaluated ATM for the core architecture. The ATM network had been rela-
tively unused at the time. Meta Telecom wanted a single supplier that was
a market leader in high-speed IP routing for the core.
LAN Connection-over-Frame Relay Cannibalization
The LAN connection-over-frame relay service represented about 35% of
the revenues for the enterprise division in 1999. A requirement for Meta
Telecom was to ensure that the emerging IP-based service would not can-
nibalize this service: creating a new LAN connection service based on IP
must not erode this revenue stream. Positioning these services and assess-
ing at which point cannibalization would make business sense were steps
for the company.
Network Infrastructure for Convergence
The requirement for Meta Telecom to use the network infrastructure as a
basis for service convergence was driven by previous exercises on this
topic. Meta Telecom viewed this project as an opportunity to remove the
political deadlock related to the convergence topic. The project had a
larger scope than to deliver the ﬁrst IP-based service by the end of 1999.
This scope was to induce cultural buy-in within the company and to result
in cultural convergence as well.
OSS Architecture
As there were separate OSS architectures corresponding to the various ser-
vices such as voice and data, the new OSS architecture needed to develop
and provision IP-based services. The speciﬁc requirement was to align the
cross-organizational business-engineering processes into a new OSS archi-
tecture. The Meta Telecom project team viewed this alignment as a neces-
sary step toward eventual convergence.

Technical Aspects
Meta Telecom has a legacy frame relay and ATM network. This Layer 2
network is used to implement the LAN connection service. The IP net-
work for each customer is built on top of the Layer 2 network. The Layer 2
8.3 Real-Life Case Study

network provides the logical separation between different customer net-
works. Since a separate Layer 3 network is built for each customer, trafﬁc
from one customer network will never be forwarded to another customer.
Network Architecture
The Layer 2 network is used to provide connectivity between different
sites (see Figure 8.5). Meta Telecom uses frame relay and ATM for the Layer
2 networks. An IP network (for each customer) is built on top of the Layer
2 network (see Figure 8.6). Each IP network is connected to the NOC of
Meta Telecom.
One of the disadvantages of the legacy VPN service is that a separate
Layer 3 network has to be built for each customer in order to ensure data
security; Layer 3 devices cannot be shared among all the customers. Figure
8.7 shows two VPN customers (indicated as dotted and dashed). A sepa-
rate IP network is implemented in order to ensure data security. This
makes the service expensive for customers, because they have to invest in
a lot of equipment. Meta Telecom also has to manage more devices.
Network Management and Operations

devices are monitored from the NOC. Proprietary and vendor-speciﬁc

applications are used to manage the network. The NOC is also involved in
the following activities:
1. Monitoring the status of each network device
2. Collecting SLA information and generating SLA reports
3. Upgrading the link speed in the Layer 2 network when the customer
wants more bandwidth
4. Conﬁguring devices when new customers are added to the network
The time required to install and conﬁgure new sites for a customer is
about four weeks. It involves the following activities:
1. Installing the devices in the new customer site
2. Modifying the conﬁguration of some of the existing devices
3. Including the new devices in the monitoring system
4. Modifying SLA reports to include the new devices
8.3.4
IP-Based Solution
Meta Telecom’s IP-based solution consists of several elements, including
business, technology, and the services architecture. The company culture
played a key role in this project. The performance of Meta Telecom in
achieving both the customer requirements as well as its own goals is

discussed. The transformation of the company in the process of delivering
this project is also examined. The case study concludes with a discussion
of the future plans of Meta Telecom for IP.
8.3.5
Services
Meta Telecom decided to build out a new network infrastructure based
on IP, due to the time-to-market factor. The project team felt that it would
be “too process-intensive” to try to develop and deploy the new services
on the legacy infrastructure. The problem for the Meta Telecom project
team was that the legacy infrastructure was still operated by different
groups within the company. There was a view taken by the team that
building out a separate network would actually be faster than trying to
bridge operational groups across the company. The service development

aspect was to include a base IP service development on top of which
value-added services such as LAN-over-IP could be developed. Figure 8.8
depicts this model. The core of the services building-block diagram de-
scribes the concept of using IP-based technology to build services. The ser-
vice provider develops the services, then deploys them to the customers,
as represented by the larger circle. This decision was made in January
2000.
The Meta Telecom project team examined the network infrastructure
elements required for scalability. Based on the input from sales and mar-
keting for expected customer connections over the next three years, the
team determined that the core needed to support OC-48/STM-16 band-
width by the end of 1999 and OC-192/STM-64 by the end of 2002. Be-
cause the core supplier could not deliver ATM at speeds of OC-48 since the
technology was unavailable, the team decided on a packet-over-SONET/
SDH core (POS). The core would consist of 40 domestic locations with link
speeds at OC-48 by the end of 1999.
The edges were to aggregate speeds of up to 622 Mb/sec from the access
via ATM and eventually leased lines. Approximately 40 domestic aggrega-
tion devices were to be installed by the end of 1999. Finally, access would
be provided either via POS or DSL. Meta Telecom had been in the pro-
cess of installing its broadband infrastructure targeted for the wholesale

market. At the end of 1999, 1000 DSL PoPs were to be installed. The new
IP-based service would use this broadband infrastructure for access. The
architecture was to support edge and access growth, and would expand
with increased customer connections. The core network would remain
small and high-speed in order to accommodate the aggregated trafﬁc
ﬂows. The core network was not to be the source of congestion and there-
fore would be overengineered, as QoS implementations were relatively
unavailable in the beginning of 2000. Figure 8.2 depicts this new architec-
ture generically.
To summarize the network architecture, key components include a
small and high-performing core, an intelligent edge, and access for aggre-
gation as well as accommodating customer growth. Intelligent edges are
the sources of accounting and customer information needed for billing
and reporting. The revenue potential is in the access, where the end cus-
tomers are. Having drafted the generic network architecture, positioning
services was the next step for the Meta Telecom team.
Product and service positioning between LAN connection-over-frame
relay and LAN connection-over-IP was an important requirement for Meta
Telecom. The company also needed to position the emerging IP-based ser-
vices. LAN connection-over-frame relay is targeted for customers with-
out any-to-any connectivity. The LAN connection-over-IP is for customers
who require this any-to-any connectivity. The customer additionally has
the capability to order bandwidth-on-demand from 64 Kb/sec to 155 Mb/
sec and have this provisioned within 24 hours. This capability is not avail-
able for LAN connection-over-frame relay customers. Figure 8.9 depicts
the IP-based service product positioning of Meta Telecom. These building
blocks reﬂect the company’s IP-based service portfolio.
Financial Aspects
Meta Telecom’s primary requirement was to determine that a new revenue
stream from IP-based services was possible. The project team examined
domestic service trends from 2000 to 2004 as part of market research and
ran a series of detailed ﬁnancial analyses examining capital expenditure,
operating expenses, net present value over three years, and pricing models
for the new services. Finally, the team explored the OSS architecture’s
ﬁnancial aspects in terms of capital expenditure and operating expenses
over a period of three years.
We present a high-level view of some of the analysis that was per-
formed, commencing with the trends toward domestic service usage, with
a focus on data services from 2000 to 2004 and the compounded annual
growth rate. The data in Table 8.7 was used by the Meta Telecom project
team as an overall market input conﬁrming the growth rate possibility for
IP-based services. The next step was to look at the capital expenditure and
operating expense results. Table 8.8 presents a high-level summary of the

general analysis for the core, edge, and access as discussed previously and
compares expenditures for a legacy network infrastructure upgrade as part
of due diligence performed by the project team.
The Meta Telecom project team conﬁrmed both market trends as well
as the savings for a new network build-out, as opposed to upgrading its
legacy networks. These conclusions were derived from market research,
the marketing plan, and the ﬁnancial analysis. In fact, the legacy network,
ATM, would be used at the access. The next step was to evaluate a poten-
tial pricing model for the new service that would not cannibalize the LAN
connection-over-frame relay but would also be attractive for the customer
as well as the market. This model would serve as a basis for extrapolating
the potential revenue streams for the new IP-based service.
As a result of ﬁeld research, Meta Telecom decided to price the LAN
connection-over-IP service at 10% below the LAN connection-over-frame
relay. Such pricing would not introduce cannibalization and was aligned
with what the strategic customer wanted. The decision was based on re-
sults from market research. Table 8.9 depicts the pricing elements of the
managed LAN connection-over-IP service. The pricing is ﬂat-fee based.
The port and access lines are combined for simplicity for the customer.
The port fee also includes any class-of-service requirements. The Meta
Telecom team applied the pricing model to the expected number of con-
nections, which were further divided by port and access speeds and had,
as expected, variable results. Table 8.10 depicts these forecasts at 2 Mb/sec.

These are clearly estimates. The exercise approximates the revenue for a
single service, LAN connection-over-IP. Meta Telecom concluded that IP-
based services could generate revenue. The following discussion examines
how all of these factors came together for Meta Telecom to develop and
deploy IP-based services. The OSS architecture capital expenditure and op-
erating expense has to be evaluated before deriving this conclusion. Table
8.11 provides a high-level view of the Meta Telecom OSS architecture
ﬁnancial analysis. Meta Telecom assumed approximately 20% systems in-
tegration in these ﬁgures. The systems integration included the develop-
ment of an intranet-based, object-oriented system.
To complete the OSS architecture analysis, Meta Telecom evaluated
both the yearly cost breakout as well as the yearly savings. Table 8.12 de-
picts this analysis. The majority of the costs are experienced in the ﬁrst
year with a yearly increase in net savings. Meta Telecom took the infor-
mation from the ROI build-out, the revenue approximation for LAN

connection-over-IP, and the OSS architecture analysis and concluded that
the company could make money from IP-based services. Finally, using a
single infrastructure, Meta Telecom prepared to launch its second IP-based
service at the end of 2001 with the addition of voice-over-IP. No addi-
tional investments in the new infrastructure were required for this second
service launch.
8.3.6
Project Execution and Results
The Meta Telecom project team started in January 1999, and the network
build-out, including the OSS architecture, was completed at the end of
August 1999. Intensive training of the operational team occurred between
March 1999 and May 1999. The staff was largely familiar with managing
a PSTN network and voice services and required IP training. Vendors
worked on-site with the project team for testing. The project time line is
depicted in Figure 8.10.
LAN connection-over-IP was launched on time in September 1999,
with the pilot for the strategic customer. The service deployment oc-
curred in record speed for this incumbent. By the end of 1999, the entire
project organization consisted of 100 people, with the majority from ser-
vice management. The project team reﬂected the functional organiza-
tion that Meta Telecom wanted to activate after the project end. Creating
the IP-based service organization occurred in 2000. The project team was
disengaged and integrated into a new IP service organization at Meta
Telecom.

Factors that contributed to the rapid execution were the cross-
functional composition of the project team and upper-management sup-
port. Finally, frequent communications between the strategic customer
and the suppliers facilitated the deployment. The customer was clear
about its expectations, and the supplier delivered the infrastructure as
required.
8.3.7
Service Implementation Model
The main function for the new Meta Telecom OSS architecture was IP-
based service development and deployment. The business-engineering
processes needed to be deﬁned by the Meta Telecom project team to sup-
port IP-based service development and deployment across the company.
Figure 8.11 depicts these processes, which provide interfaces between IP-
based service creation and the OSS architecture. The IP-based service port-
folio is linked to the architecture. With the business-engineering template
and the OSS architecture, IP-based service development is accelerated.
Meta Telecom launched the second service, voice-over-IP, in the fall of
2001. This service development commenced in July 2001, a total of ﬁve
months from beginning to end. The ﬁrst service, LAN connection-over-IP,
took nine months (from January 1999 to the end of September 1999). As
this was the ﬁrst IP-based service, the service creation architecture had
to be developed and implemented simultaneously. Finally, at the end of
2001, the provisioning function of the architecture has been optimized to
deploy approximately 50,000 connections per year.
8.3.8
Alternatives Considered
Using the legacy network to develop the IP-based services was considered,
but only for a short period. The constraint was due to the requirement by
the team to have a single vendor, a leader in high-speed IP routing. The
ATM network has been used at the IP-based service access points. Toward
the goal of convergence, Meta Telecom is currently planning for the mi-
gration of its leased-line services to the IP-based network infrastructure.
8.3.9
Vendor Selection Process
Meta Telecom required a single vendor for the core, edge, and access ag-
gregation. The DSL vendor is a market leader. The network infrastructure,
in fact, supports two vendors. Meta Telecom requested, as an early adopter
of the technology, access to the vendor developers for the core, edge, and
access aggregation. This exchange provided valuable communications for
technology applicability as well as how the technology and product was
being used for IP-based services. Meta Telecom had a direct feedback loop
to product development. (An example of this feedback loop is described in
Chapter 2.) These developers had access to the Meta Telecom service de-
velopment lab. Other European service providers requested Meta Telecom

Technical Aspects
Meta Telecom wants to offer LAN connection service using the new IP net-
work to corporate customers to provide IP connectivity between vari-
ous locations of the company that are scattered across many cities. Meta
Telecom has PoPs located in most of the cities. Some of the features of-
fered by the new LAN connection service include
1. CPEs managed by the service provider
2. Uninterrupted connectivity between all the small satellite sites and the
main sites
3. SLA-guaranteed minimum downtime (four to eight hours) for the
small sites
4. SLA-guaranteed downtime of less than one hour for main sites
5. Guaranteed bandwidth (in several values, ranging from 64 Kb/sec to
100 Mb/sec) for any site
6. Internet access
7. SLA reporting providing details about link utilization and service avail-
ability on a weekly basis
Meta Telecom has decided to use ATM, frame relay, and ADSL in an ac-
cess network based on the available network infrastructure in most cus-
tomer sites. Some customers have copper connections, while others have
ﬁber connections to the nearest service provider PoP. ATM is used for sites
that have large bandwidth requirements (up to 155 Mb/sec); frame relay is
used for sites that have medium bandwidth requirements (up to 30 Mb/
sec); and ADSL is used for small sites that have only a few users and small
bandwidth requirements (not exceeding 512 Kb/sec).
Network Architecture
Figure 8.2 shows the network architecture. This hierarchical architecture
is in line with the architecture adapted by several service providers. It
makes the network scalable, stable, reliable, and capable of supporting
multiservices. Figure 8.12 shows the LAN connection service using the
new IP network. In contrast with the implementation using the legacy
network (see Figure 8.7), it can be clearly seen that the same IP network
can be used to support multiple customers. The NOC of the service pro-
vider requires only one IP connection to manage the entire network.
Network Management and Operations
The NOC plays a major role in providing the LAN connection services us-
ing the new IP network. Its activities include provisioning the service,
272
Chapter 8: Case Studies

monitoring the network, generating SLA reports, and so on. Following are
brief descriptions of the activities of the NOC.
Implementation and Provisioning
Guaranteed bandwidth is implemented, using the features provided by
ATM, frame relay, and ADSL. The maximum link capacity from each site is
restricted to the supported guaranteed bandwidth by using the throttling
features supported by ATM, frame relay, and ADSL technologies. In order
to provide a ﬂexible solution, interconnectivity between the sites is pro-
vided using MPLS-VPN. Routing protocols are implemented between sites
and the service provider network to get and distribute routing informa-
tion of a customer’s sites.
Provisioning a customer site for the LAN interconnection service
requires
1. Establishing Layer 2 connectivity between the customer site and ser-
vice provider PoP; this requires Layer 2 connectivity to be established
in the access network

that site
3. Activating IP connectivity between the CPE and service provider PoP
4. Activating the routing between the CPE and the service provider PoP
and ensuring that the new site has connectivity to all other sites
In order to provision several sites within a short time, tools based on
SNMP can be used to conﬁgure all of the devices in the network. A data-
base provides all of the relevant information for each customer site. The
software tool interacts with the database to extract the information that is
relevant for each site and conﬁgures all of the necessary devices. Software
tools help to reduce the time required to conﬁgure devices and also to
minimize the faults due to manual conﬁguration.
Network Monitoring
In order to guarantee minimum downtime, the NOC must periodically
monitor all of the devices in the network. SNMP-based tools can be used
to monitor the devices and to receive alarms from the network devices. A
good database system with all relevant information about the network
will help to monitor the network and also to provide information for trou-
bleshooting in case of the malfunctioning of some of the devices. A visual
topology of the network can be of great help for troubleshooting prob-
lems in the network.
As part of the fault-monitoring system, error logs must be periodically
checked to see if there are any signs of trouble. Automated tools to scan
the logs for well-known problems (related to service) can help in reducing
the time that is required to detect and isolate faults. These tools are a part
of the OSS architecture.
SLA Reporting
The use of SNMP-based tools to periodically collect statistical information
about link utilization can aid in generating SLA reports for customers.
These tools can be automated to periodically collect this information and
save it in a database. Other tools to generate Web-based reports for the
customer can use this information. The billing department also uses this
information to charge the customer based on link utilization.
OSS Architecture
Meta Telecom has invested time and money to build an OSS architecture
that can aid in rapid service development and deployment. The OSS sys-
tem is built using third-party applications. The architecture helps the vari-
ous departments to exchange information and also to ensure that in-
formation is valid and consistent. The information is accessible to all of
the departments electronically, which minimizes manual intervention to
274
Chapter 8: Case Studies

extract and manipulate the information once it has been registered in the
OSS system.
For example, in the legacy system, the IP addressing plan was ex-
changed between various departments using Excel sheets. Each depart-
ment manually extracted the IP address plan from the Excel sheet and
then entered it into their own system. The new OSS architecture over-
comes this problem. Once the IP address plan of the customer is made
available to the OSS system, it is then available to all departments. Since
all departments make use of the same OSS system, there is no need to ex-
tract the information and enter it into several databases.
Web-Based Tools
Using Web-based tools can help to make the task of provisioning easy for
the operator who is responsible for provisioning new customer connec-
tions. It can also help the operator to monitor the health of the net-
work and the status of individual devices with a few clicks of a mouse.
Meta Telecom intends to provide Web-based online SLA reports to its cus-
tomers. This will make it easy for customers to get information about their
network. Information related to link utilization can help customers in do-
ing capacity planning and ordering more bandwidth for sites that have
very high link utilization.
Meta Telecom provides a Web-based interface to customers for request-
ing service upgrades. One such service upgrade is to increase the link ca-
pacity when the link utilization reaches a threshold value. Customers can
order more link bandwidth using the online Web-based interface. The link
upgrade is performed within 24 hours (if enough network resources are
readily available), and a notiﬁcation is sent to the customer about the suc-
cessful upgrade.

Assessing Project Risks
Building a new backbone and developing new services in time for the stra-
tegic customer’s deadline was a big risk taken by Meta Telecom. The time
required to build the new IP backbone and to implement the service was
extremely short compared to the usual time required for a service develop-
ment cycle within Meta Telecom. Building the services based on technolo-
gies (like MPLS-VPN) that are relatively new is a risk, as the technology is
not mature and can have bugs in the implementation. This requires a
close working relationship with the vendor. Another risk faced by Meta
Telecom was that the new LAN connection service over IP could cannibal-
ize the older LAN connection service over frame relay. This could result in
losing customers for the older service and thereby make it less proﬁtable
to maintain. The legacy OSS infrastructure was another risk factor that
could have slowed down the development of new IP-based services: it

could have slowed down the service implementation phase and resulted
in the loss of customers (and hence revenue) for Meta Telecom.
8.3.12
Lessons Learned
What went right for Meta Telecom? A strategic customer requesting the
development of the “multimedia plug” propelled Meta Telecom into this
evolutionary phase of the company. A cross-functional team that in-
cluded sales and marketing and upper-management support removed the
political obstacles that had precluded the company from moving forward.
Technology and product availability, as well as a valuable exchange be-
tween the vendor developers and the service architecture team aided the
project. Finally, the emphasis that the OSS architecture is important to IP-
based service creation was perhaps the most signiﬁcant success factor in
the Meta Telecom project.
8.3.13
Future Plans
Meta Telecom has launched three new IP-based services in 2002. These are
IP-VPN, remote access, and Internet access. The company is considering
off-loading its voice transit switches to the IP backbone by the end of
2003. The IP backbone will be used for the emerging mobile UMTS service
packages by the beginning of 2004. The strategy toward service conver-
gence onto a single infrastructure is in progress.
8.3.14
Conclusion
The Meta Telecom experience is a success, demonstrating how IP-based
technology has uniﬁed a company’s operations to develop and deploy IP-
based services, reduce costs, and reduce service-provisioning time. The
customer no longer has to wait eight weeks for provisioning—the aver-
age provisioning time is now four weeks, a 50% improvement in deploy-
ment. Most important is that these IP-based services have catalyzed reve-
nues; the company has reported a yearly increase in revenues from service
launch. The case study is a model for IP-based service creation and an ex-
ample of an evolutionary approach to change.
8.4 Chapter Review
The conceptual case studies and the Meta Telecom experience have drawn
a picture of the business and technical aspects associated with IP-based
service creation. There are common success factors in all three examples
that include upper-management support and vision to use IP technol-
ogy to transform a company, the redeﬁnition of business-engineering pro-
cesses for company-wide IP-based service development and deployment,

tions as they pertain to IP-based service development. These questions are
to your vendor, to your customer, to your service provider. Are you ready
to develop and use IP-based services?

Closing Remarks:
Remaining Competitive
with IP
The previous chapters presented business motivations not only for using
IP-based technology to develop services but also for incorporating IP as a
philosophy in developing and deploying those services. Rapid service de-
velopment and implementation is possible for both Greenﬁeld and in-
cumbent operators and can be achieved by using the models proposed
in this book. However, quick and efﬁcient service development is not a
given. Service providers must apply resources to the creation of the IP-
based toolbox, an essential foundation for an electronic development
(e-development) strategy. Once IP-based services are in place, service pro-
viders can begin offering solutions to customers and achieving a competi-
tive edge.
Let us once again visit the requirements of today’s customers, end us-
ers, and service providers. Based on the information presented in the
previous chapters, let us see whether an IP network can meet all of the re-
quirements. Customer requirements can be summarized as follows:
279

Connectivity
Multiservices using a single connection
Guaranteed throughput
Minimal delay
Minimal delay variation (jitter)
Security
High availability (99.999%) of the service
SLA reports on a periodic basis
Cost savings
Fast service
Staying ahead of the curve
IP deﬁnitely satisﬁes the connectivity requirements of today’s applica-
tions, most of which are based on TCP/IP or UDP/IP. As a result, an IP net-
work can easily meet the applications’ connectivity requirements.
IP can also provide connectivity over a number of Layer 2 technologies
and acts as a melting pot to provide connectivity between users with dif-
ferent access technologies. As seen from the access technologies discus-
sion, an IP network can be used to provide multiservices (voice, video, and
data) over a single connection to the customer site. The QoS discussion
shows that IP networks can deﬁnitely meet the QoS requirements of voice,
video, and data applications, such as guaranteed bandwidth and minimal
delay and jitter.
Layer 3 VPNs help a service provider to use the same backbone for mul-
tiple VPNs and at the same time ensure that each VPN has its privacy so
that IP packets from one VPN do not get forwarded to another. Layer 3
VPNs have an advantage over Layer 2 VPNs based on ATM or frame relay
in terms of scalability of the core network. IPSec can supplement the secu-
rity requirements by ensuring data conﬁdentiality in addition to data in-
tegrity. Encryption features provided by IPSec can help applications, like
e-commerce and e-banking, and customers, like banks, by ensuring that
conﬁdential data can be transported using the IP network without any
worries about the data being intercepted by unauthorized parties.
Using redundancy, IP-based networks can be used to provide services
with high availability. SNMP-based tools can be used to provide SLA re-
ports on availability and network utilization to the customer.
IP helps to provide multiservices (voice, video, and data) using the
same physical connection between the service provider PoP and the cus-
tomer site. This helps the customer to reduce their costs on network con-
nectivity and contributes to the customer’s business proﬁtability. For the
280
Closing Remarks: Remaining Competitive with IP

service provider who offers value-added services based on IP, this can re-
sult in both new customers and customer loyalty.
The goals of service providers can be summarized as follows:
Scalable and stable core network to support a large number of
customers
Multiservices using the same network
Easy network operations for maintenance purposes and for upgrading/
modifying customer requests
Short time for developing and deploying IP-based services
Fast time to market and cost savings
Scalability and reliability are key issues for service providers. As long as
the core network is scalable, it permits the service provider to offer many
IP-based services (and hence have more customers) using the same core
network. Technologies like MPLS help in designing and implementing
scalable and reliable core networks. Trafﬁc engineering (using MPLS) helps
to make efﬁcient use of the bandwidth in an IP network.
Reliability can be achieved by using redundancy to avoid single points
of failure. IP networks can provide redundancy. Routing protocols help to
reroute trafﬁc when a single component or multiple components fail in
the network. High availability is provided by having redundant paths in
the core network and between the customer site and the service provider
PoPs.
Voice, video, and data are some of the different networks owned by ser-
vice providers. Typically, they would like to reduce the cost of maintain-
ing these networks and at the same time be able to offer all the services
required by their customers. Technologies like voice-over-IP and video-
streaming help providers to offer these services using a single IP net-
work and thereby reduce the cost of building and maintaining several
networks.
An efﬁcient network operations center (NOC) plays a key role in run-
ning and maintaining a large IP network that supports several IP-based
services. Good NMS tools can assist operators in the NOC to manage the
network, detect and diagnose faults in a timely manner, and take preven-
tive actions to avoid network outages. NMS tools also play a key role in
provisioning new customers and upgrading the services of existing cus-
tomers. Provisioning a large number of customers in a short period of time
is the key to rapid deployment of new IP-based services and having a com-
petitive edge in the market. The challenge lies in having a good OSS archi-
tecture to help reduce the time required to provision new customers and
services. IP and IP-based services can deﬁnitely help service providers in
rapid development and deployment.
Closing Remarks: Remaining Competitive with IP
281

Using IP to automate tools and best practices for marketing and busi-
ness engineering reduces the time to market for a new service because the
processes are not done manually; however, an organization must ﬁrst re-
view its service development process regarding any optimization before
automating the process itself. IP-based technology also contributes to cost
savings for a service provider by reducing operating expenses in collapsing
multiple services and corresponding network management systems to a
single, multiservice architecture, thus eliminating separate networks and
separate network management organizations. With IP-based technology,
the trend is from fast service to self-service for “real-time” service develop-
ment and deployment as initiated by the customer. Self-service allows the
customer to be the key stakeholder for new services: the customer deter-
mines the services to be developed and deployed.
Where does one go from here? Clearly, IP-based services will play a
huge role in enabling future services. Enhancements are being made to IP
in order to provide an equivalent voice QoS and corresponding CoS simi-
lar to traditional switching networks like ATM, frame relay, and voice.
Certainly, this industry is embarking on changes not seen since the on-
set of the telephone itself. Challenging service providers to review their
own service development and deployment processes has been a common
thread throughout this book. Demonstrating how IP-based technology
can facilitate the processes is the crux of this book. The challenge now is
to activate this model.
Will IP be replaced? Intelligence is certainly moving down to the physi-
cal layer in the service provider backbone. For example, optical network-
ing is becoming a more widely adopted transmission technology because
of the bandwidth problems it solves. With the rapid emergence of optical
networking technology, IP is seen as the protocol that will run directly
over an optical transport network like DWDM with an IP-based control
plane (GMPLS) used to control the optical networks. This reduces the
overhead of the intermediate layers, like SONET/SDH and ATM, and helps
to speed up the emergence of IP as a protocol that runs over an optical
network.
A consolidation in the industry will precipitate the deployment of IP-
based services. The reality is that existing service providers need to reach
proﬁtability, funding for new players is lacking, and only a few large sup-
pliers will exist as a result of industry shakeouts. It is not enough to
provide innovative hardware but rather IP-based OSS architecture. Given
the drive for the supplier requirements for “critical mass,” efﬁciency in
research and development, and sales and product depth, coupled with
tighter capital markets, the industry will be more concentrated in this
consolidation trend, that is toward IP-based solutions in products. IP-
based technology will play a key role in this effort.
The most important characteristic of IP is that it is an open protocol,
and as a result, it is commonly used in day-to-day operations, whether
282

looking at real-time stock quotes or sharing a presentation via the Web.
The future of IP looks good. If anything, for a service provider, the trans-
mission layers like ATM, frame relay, and SONET that exist between IP and
the physical layer will be collapsed to a maximum of two; IP will be one of
these layers, and the physical layer will be an optical network.
Finally, looking forward, we see how the Web has been a key ben-
eﬁciary of IP. The Web is an information resource for the world in all areas.
For example, the medical profession is using the Web for research, while
patients use it to search for information on diseases.
IP-based technology is changing the way people learn: universities and
corporations are using it to develop and deploy e-training for customers
and employees. Lectures and information are literally being brought to
the home, thus eliminating the requirement to physically be at a location
to receive information. Developing countries are exploring IP-based tech-
nology for information sharing and training in companies and schools.
Society is now electronic, an e-society using IP-based technology for com-
munication and information. All of this presents opportunities for ser-
vice providers. While IP-based technology does not replace the value of
human-to-human communication, it can facilitate the way people work
and learn by making content available when and where people need it.
We anticipate that the next service you will develop and use will be
based on IP. We wish you a successful journey designing and implement-
ing IP-based services!
