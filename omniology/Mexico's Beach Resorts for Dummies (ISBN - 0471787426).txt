About the Authors
Lynne Bairstow now considers Mexico to be more her home than
her native United States. After living in Puerto Vallarta and explor-
ing Mexico for most of the past 17 years, she’s developed not only
an appreciation but also a true love for the country and its com-
plex, colorful culture. Her travel articles on Mexico have been pub-
lished in the New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles
Times, Luxury Living, Frommer’s Budget Travel magazine, and
Alaska Airlines Magazine. In 2000, the Mexican government
awarded Lynne the Pluma de Plata, a top honor granted to foreign
writers, for her work in the Frommer’s guidebooks to Mexico.
David Baird is a writer, editor, and translator who feels uncomfort-
able writing about himself in the third person (too much like writ-
ing your own obituary). Now based in Austin, Texas, he has spent
years living in various parts of Mexico, Brazil, Peru, and Puerto
Rico. But whenever possible, he manages to get back to the
Yucatán’s turquoise-blue waters because he thinks he looks good in
that color and because he’s excessively fond of the local cooking.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my many friends in Mexico who, through
sharing their insights, anecdotes, knowledge, and explorations of
Mexico, have shared their love of this country. In particular, Silver,
Ricardo, Santiago, and Carlos have shared with me and have
shown me what a magical place Mexico is and how much more I
have to discover and enjoy.
— Lynne Bairstow
To my brother John, whose sheer willpower overcame my objec-
tions and forced me to take the vacation many, many years ago
that first brought me to the Caribbean shores of Mexico.
— David Baird
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Many thanks to all the many people who helped me gather the
information, tips, and treasures that have made their way into this
book. I am especially grateful for the assistance of Cecilia
Mendicuti, her valuable ideas and contributions, and her tireless
work in ensuring that the information in this book is correct.
— Lynne Bairstow
I would like to acknowledge my indebtedness to the irrepressible
Desiré Sanromán, a Cozumeleña who knows her island and who
befriended me for reasons that aren’t quite clear. (Sympathy? Pity?
Concern for all the readers I may mislead?) I also thank that most
capable of guides, Claudia Hurtado Valenzuela, who opened the
doors of the Riviera Maya to me, and whose views on all matters
touristic were well worth hearing.
— David Baird

Mexico’s Beach Resorts For Dummies, 3rd Edition

Introduction
M
exico not only offers travelers some of the world’s best beaches,
but it also presents a rich, 1,000-year-old culture and amazing nat-
ural wonders to explore. Whether it’s the desert caves of Los Cabos or
the Caribbean reefs off Cancún and Cozumel, Mexico’s largely untouched
coastline is a virtual playground for travelers. In addition to the many
natural attractions, Mexico’s beach resorts have added golf, tennis,
diving, and abundant watersports to their lures. But can the rest of your
knowledge about this vast country fit inside a mango seed? For many
people, Mexico is both familiar and a mystery, and some opinions of this
land are influenced by inaccurate or outdated stereotypes. If you’re a
traveler who’s more attuned to the culture, you may have visited one or
two Mexican beach resorts, but you’re probably curious about some of
the others.
How do you sift through the destination choices — and then all the hotel
options — without throwing in the beach towel in a daze of confusion?
How do you plan a vacation that’s perfect for you — not one that simply
follows the recommendations of a friend or travel agent? You’ve come to
the right place. This guide rescues you from both information overload
and detail deficit — those annoying syndromes that afflict far too many
would-be travelers. We give you enough specifics to plan the type of trip
you want and steer clear of the type of trip you don’t want.
Sure, plenty of other guidebooks are available that cover Mexico and its
beach destinations, but many of them may as well be encyclopedias:
They include practically everything you can possibly see and do. When
the time comes to decide upon accommodations, attractions, activities,
and meals, you probably have a tough time finding the best options
because they’re buried in with the rest of the mediocre to not-so-hot
suggestions.
Mexico’s Beach Resorts For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is a whole new enchi-
lada. In this book, we streamline the options, focusing on each vacation
spot’s high points (and warning you about the low points). We leave 
out the less-visited, harder-to-reach beach resorts so that we can concen-
trate on the most popular (and most exciting) destinations. With the
straightforward tips that we offer — how to get there, what to expect
when you arrive, where to stay, where to eat, and where to have big 
fun — arranging your dream vacation can’t be easier.

About This Book
You can use this book in three ways:
 As a trip planner: Whether you think you know where you want to
go in Mexico, or you don’t have a clue, this book helps you zero in
on the ideal beach resort for you. It guides you through all the nec-
essary steps of making your travel arrangements, from finding the
cheapest airfare and considering travel insurance to figuring out a
budget and packing like a pro. Chapters are self-contained, so you
don’t have to read them in order. Find the chapters you want in the
table of contents, and just flip to them as you need them.
 As a beach-resort guide: Pack this book along with your 
sunscreen — it comes in just as handy while you’re away, though
not to prevent sunburn. Turn to the appropriate destination chap-
ters whenever you need to find the best beaches, a good place to
eat, a worthwhile boat cruise, a challenging golf course, the low-
down on a hot nightspot, or tips on any other diversions.
 For an enjoyable overview: If you want a feel for Mexico’s most
popular beach resorts, read this book from start to finish to get a
taste of all the highlights.
Travel information is subject to change at any time — call ahead for con-
firmation when making your travel plans. Your safety is important to us
(and to the publisher), so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of
your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets —
all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, we include reviews of our favorite hotels and restaurants,
as well as information about the best attractions at each of Mexico’s top
beach resorts. In these reviews, we use abbreviations for commonly
accepted credit cards. Here’s what those abbreviations stand for:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
We also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or where to dine on the local cuisine.
We use a system of dollar signs to show a range of costs (in U.S. dollars)
so that you can make quick comparisons.
Mexico’s Beach Resorts For Dummies, 3rd Edition

Unless stated otherwise, the lodging rates that we give are for two
people spending one night in a standard double room. Prices are pro-
vided for both high season — the most popular travel time that runs
roughly from Christmas to Easter — and the generally lower-priced
summer season (or low season). Note that the following dollar sign pric-
ing system indicates only the high-season rates for lodging, and applies
to main courses only for restaurants.
Some hotel rates are much higher than others no matter what time 
of year it is. Don’t be too quick to skip an accommodation that seems
out of your price range, though. Some rates include breakfast, both
breakfast and dinner, or even three meals per day. Other resorts are all-
inclusive, which means that after you pay for your room, you never have
to dip into your pocket again for meals, beverages, tips, taxes, most
activities, or transportation to and from the airport. So, although a price
tag may seem sky-high at first, you may actually find it affordable upon
second glance.
Check out the following table to decipher the dollar signs:

Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and what
your needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what we assumed about you:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to a Mexican beach resort and
how to plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Mexico or its beaches and wants expert advice when you
finally do get a chance to enjoy some fun in the sun.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Mexico or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction
available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on
the places that offer the best or most unique experiences in these
beach resorts.
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
We divide this book into 11 parts. The chapters within each part cover
specific subjects in detail. Skip around as much as you like; you don’t
have to read this book in any particular order. In fact, think of these
pages as a buffet. You can consume whatever you want — and no one
cares if you eat the flan for dessert before you have the enchiladas.
For each beach resort, we include a section called “Fast Facts.” These
sections give you handy information that you may need when traveling
in Mexico, including phone numbers and addresses to use in an emer-
gency, area hospitals and pharmacies, names of local newspapers and
magazines, locations for maps, and more.
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts
Let’s cut to the chase: Where are the best beaches, most romantic
places to stay, best bets for families, and hottest nightlife? We cover all
of this and more in this section — think of it as your personal tip sheet
of the very best of Mexico’s Beach Resorts.
Your vacation will be much more enjoyable if you take the time to learn
a bit about the wealth of this magical land. Sure, Mexico is a close neigh-
bor, but the nuances of its culture are fascinating. Here, we give you a
brief overview of local history, architecture, customs, cuisines, and fies-
tas and celebrations. We also give you a list of some popular movies and
books to make exploring these topics even more enjoyable.
Also in this section, we compare and contrast Mexico’s most popular
beach resorts so that you can decide which place best suits your tastes
and needs. Sure, they all have gorgeous beaches, but that’s where the
similarities end. To help you plan a vacation that’s tailored to your pref-
erences, this part guides you through the process of figuring out which
resort or resorts are best for you.
We take you through the best — and worst — times of year to travel, and
we explain the differences between high season and low season. We also
tell you about special holidays that may help you decide when to visit
Mexico.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts
This section is where we lay out everything you need to know about
making all the arrangements for your trip. We help you decide whether
to use a travel agent, a packager, or the Internet. We offer advice on find-
ing the best airfare — and airline — for your destination. Likewise, we
explain how to estimate the total cost of your vacation and how to stay
within your budget.
We also offer up some special trip-planning advice for families, singles,
gay and lesbian travelers, seniors, and travelers who are physically 
Mexico’s Beach Resorts For Dummies, 3rd Edition

challenged. Finally, we take you through all the ins and outs of other
vacation essentials, from getting a passport and considering travel insur-
ance, to staying connected, staying safe, and packing like a pro.
Part III: Cancún
For years, this has been Mexico’s most popular beach resort, however it
took a wallop of a hit by hurricane Wilma in October 2005. We’ll help
guide you to the places that have recovered, to ensure you won’t be dis-
appointed by those places that haven’t. Popular with first-time travelers
to Mexico, this area has all the comforts of home: familiar restaurant and
hotel chains along with great shopping, easy access to diverse cultural
and geographical activities and excursions to the ancient ruins of Tulum,
world-class scuba diving, and plenty of Mexican fiestas. We provide all
the details for getting to, eating at, staying in, and playing at all of
Cancún’s hot spots.
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya
Staying on a tropical island is a dream for many, and Cozumel offers a
distinctive island destination for a laid-back vacation with a myriad of
water activities, many centered around the famous reef that outlines the
southwest coast. Back on the mainland, the Riviera Maya provides a
stunning stretch of pristine beaches, unique towns, and mega-resorts
from Cancún to Tulum. Check out the ultra-trendy town of Playa del
Carmen or visit one of the eco-parks. This area also suffered extensive
damage from October 2005’s hurricane Wilma, so we’ll let you know of
any areas that haven’t fully recovered. In this part, we cover all the infor-
mation you need to travel to and around these two beach resorts.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast
Turn to this part for the inside scoop (Lynne, one of the authors of this
book, is a long-time resident!) on visiting the picturesque city of Puerto
Vallarta. From viewing historic landmarks to dining in world-class restau-
rants to finding the perfect beach along the 81km (50 miles) of coastline
surrounding Banderas Bay, a trip to this part of Mexico is sure to please
even the most discriminating vacationer.
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
Who says you can’t get it all in one destination? Traveling to the 
towns of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo provides the best of two worlds: Ixtapa
gives you high-class hotels along a beautiful strip of sand, and nearby
Zihuatanejo wraps you in the warmth of its small-town charms. This part
offers advice on staying and dining in both of these great vacation spots.
Part VII: Acapulco
The grande dame of Mexico’s west coast, Acapulco draws many visitors
to its glittering bay and glamorous nightlife. Enjoy the excitement of a
Introduction 5

bustling city combined with the amenities of a beachfront resort. This
part gives you the lowdown on vacationing in Mexico’s first beach
resort.
Part VIII: Huatulco and the Southern Pacific Coast
For details on a vacation that centers on the natural beauty of the land
and the sea, turn to Part VIII. This part offers a close-up look at two
towns along the southern Pacific coast: Huatulco and Puerto Escondido.
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja
Want to take time out for a great golf vacation? Ready to reel in a big
one? Want to relax in one of Mexico’s most deluxe resorts? Or, just need
to let your hair down and enjoy some super-charged nightlife? Then turn
to Part IX for all the details on vacationing in Los Cabos and on the Baja
Peninsula.
Part X: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. In this section, you can find
out about ten marvelous Mexico moments, ten common myths about
Mexico, and ten delicious Mexican dishes to try.
Part XI: Appendixes
Do you want to locate a quick phone number or Web site, touch up on 
a few common Spanish words and phrases, or get your hunger pangs
going for some authentic Mexican cuisine? Check out this part for all
that information and more.

mation. Here’s a look at what each symbol means:

the sun or pursuing active, water-bound activities — and it’s even better
when planned with the right advice and insider tips. Whether you’re a vet-
eran traveler or new to the game, Mexico’s Beach Resorts For Dummies,

and parasailing. The beaches of Punta Mita, the exclusive develop-
ment north of Vallarta, are of the white-sand variety, with crystalline
waters and coral reefs just offshore. Others around the bay nestle in
coves, accessible only by boat. See Chapters 16 to 19.
 Puerto Escondido: This is our pick for the best overall beach value
in Mexico. Although it’s principally known for its world-class surf-
ing beach, Playa Zicatela, the surrounding beaches all have their
own appeal; colorful fishing pangas (small boats) dot the central
town beach, parked under the shade of palms leaning so far over
they almost touch the ground. Puerto Escondido offers unique
accommodations at excellent prices, with exceptional budget
dining and nightlife. See Chapter 29.
 Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo: These side-by-side resorts offer beachgoers
the best of both worlds: serene simplicity and resort comforts. For
those in search of a back-to-basics beach, the best and most beauti-
ful is Playa La Ropa, close to Zihuatanejo. The wide beach at Playa
Las Gatas, with its restaurants and snorkeling sites, is also a great
place to play. The luxury hotels in Ixtapa, on the next bay over from
Zihuatanejo, front Playa Palmar, a fine, wide swath of beach. See
Chapters 20 to 23.
 Cancún: Despite the well-documented damage from 2005’s
Hurricane Wilma, Cancún is rapidly recovering, and is known as
Mexico’s most popular beach playground. Essentially one long
ribbon of white sand bordering aquamarine water, Cancún has one
of Mexico’s most beautifully situated beaches. If you want tropical
drinks brought to you while you lounge in the sand, this is the vaca-
tion for you. In addition to being a bustling, modern mega-resort,
it’s also a great place for exploring Caribbean reefs, tranquil
lagoons, and the surrounding jungle. The most tranquil waters and
beaches on Cancún Island are those at the northern tip, facing the
Bahía de Mujeres. See Chapters 10 to 13.
 Playa del Carmen: This is one of our absolute favorite Mexican
beach vacations. Stylish and hip, Playa del Carmen offers a beauti-
ful beach and an eclectic assortment of small hotels, inns, and
cabañas (cabins). The social scene is focused on the beach by day
and the pedestrian-only Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue) by night,
with its fun assortment of restaurants, clubs, sidewalk cafes, and
shops. You’re also close to the coast’s major attractions, including
nature parks, ruins, and, cenotes (sinkholes or natural wells).
Cozumel Island is just a quick ferry trip away. Enjoy it while it’s a
manageable size. See Chapter 15.
 Los Cabos: Dramatic rock formations and crashing waves mix with
wide stretches of soft sand and a rolling break. Start at Pueblo la
Playa, just north of San José del Cabo, and work your way down the
Cabo Corridor to the famed Playa de Amor at Land’s End. Some
beaches are more appropriate for contemplation than for swim-
ming, which isn’t all bad. See Chapters 30 to 33.

The Best Luxury Resorts
If money is no object, Mexico’s beach resorts have no shortage of places
to park yourself in style. As an extra-added bonus, most of Mexico’s
resorts have recently added brand-new spas that raise the art of relax-
ation and pampering to a new level. What could be better than a massage
on the beach? (Maybe a massage on the beach with a margarita, too?)
The following are a few of our favorite luxury resorts:
 Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita (north of Puerto Vallarta): This
luxury resort has soared in popularity since opening in 1999. It
offers an unrivaled location (on a remote, pristine stretch of beach)
and the stellar service characteristic of the Four Seasons chain.
Also on-site are an expansive spa and a private Jack Nicklaus
Signature golf course. See Chapter 16.
 Las Ventanas al Paraíso (Los Cabos): Stunning in its relaxed ele-
gance, Las Ventanas comes complete with a deluxe European spa,
excellent gourmet restaurant, and elegantly appointed rooms and
suites. From fireplaces and telescopes to private pools and rooftop
terraces, each suite is a private slice of heaven. See Chapter 30.
 One&Only Palmilla (Los Cabos): Currently the most popular
Mexican resort with the Hollywood crowd, the recently renovated
Palmilla has earned its spot as the most deluxe hotel in this seaside
playground known for sumptuous accommodations and great golf.
The exceptional spa, fitness center, and yoga garden, as well as a
restaurant by renowned chef Charlie Trotter are added bonuses.
See Chapter 30.
 Villa del Sol (Zihuatanejo): Few hotels meet the demanding stan-
dards of luxury and attention to detail required to be a member of
the French Relais & Châteaux, but this small beachfront inn does.
It’s also a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World. See
Chapter 20.
 Le Méridien Cancún Resort & Spa (Cancún): Although there are
grander hotels in Cancún, we prefer this resort, as it’s the most inti-
mate of the luxury hotels, with an understated sense of highly per-
sonalized service. Especially notable is its 1,394-sq.-m (15,000-sq.-ft.)
Spa del Mar. See Chapter 10.
 Fiesta Americana Grand Aqua (Cancún): This resort was under-
going repairs from Hurricane Wilma damage at press time, but is
expected to return to its previous splendor by fall 2006. Its exquisite
design and detailed amenities set a new standard for Cancún chic
when it opened in early 2005. It offers luxury that indulges the
senses without overwhelming them. Clean design and a color
scheme that mirrors the aquamarine and white beach landscape are
inherently relaxing. Add a superb spa, dazzling selection of restau-
rants, and a chill-music scene in the evenings around the pool, and
the mood is set for a more modern take on luxury. See Chapter 10.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Mexico’s Beach Resorts 15

 Maroma (Riviera Maya): You cannot ask for a better setting for a
resort than this beautiful stretch of Caribbean coast with palm
trees and manicured gardens. You begin to relax before you even
take the first sip of your welcome cocktail. Service is very attentive,
and the rooms are large and luxurious. See Chapter 15.
The Best Good-Value Accommodations
Being on a budget in Mexico doesn’t mean you’ll have to sacrifice style —
or the perfect beach vacation. There are plenty of well-priced options,
and here are our favorites:
 Paraíso Escondido (Puerto Escondido): This eclectic inn is a great
bargain, especially for the originality of the décor, and the excellent
service. It’s a short walk to both the beach and the action along
Puerto’s main street. See Chapter 29.
 Misión de los Arcos (Huatulco): Just 1 block from the central plaza,
this hotel has a similar style to the elegant Quinta Real, at a fraction
of the cost. An all-white facade and intriguing decorative touches
give it an inviting feel, plus there’s also a cute cafe, stocked gym,
and Wi-Fi everywhere. A shuttle service takes you to Huatulco’s
beaches. See Chapter 28.
 Hotel Los Flamingos (Acapulco): Take a break and step back in
time, to the Hollywood heyday of Old Acapulco, when you stay here.
Set on a dramatic cliff, away from the bustle of Acapulco’s beach
zone, this hotel was once the private retreat of movie greats includ-
ing John Wayne, Cary Grant, and Johnny “Tarzan” Weissmuller. Its
funky charm still captivates. See Chapter 24.
 Cabo Inn (Cabo San Lucas): This former bordello is the best budget
inn in the area. Rooms are small but extra-clean and invitingly deco-
rated, amenities are generous, and the owner-managers are friendly
and helpful. Ideally located, close to town and near the marina, the
inn caters to sportfishers. See Chapter 30.
 Rey del Caribe Hotel: Not only will you find exceptional value here,
but you’ll also support a true ecological hotel, which uses environ-
mentally sensitive practices like collecting rainwater and compost-
ing. Sunny rooms are surrounded by lush jungle landscaping — and
all in the heart of downtown Cancún! See Chapter 10.
 Treetops (Playa del Carmen): An economical, quiet hotel steps
from both the beach and Avenida 5, Treetops could easily get by 
on its location alone. But the owners have gone out of their way to
create distinctive lodging with plenty of amenities. The hotel has its
very own cenote and piece of shady jungle, making it a lovely place
to relax after a trying day of strolling the beach and wandering the
village streets. See Chapter 15.

The Most Unique Places 
to Get Away from It All
Mexico offers a multitude of unique places to escape the world and relax
in seaside splendor. While some of the specific hotels below offer more
activity than others, all are what we consider to be the most unique
places in Mexico to transport you to a truly “away” state of mind:
 Verana (Yelapa, south of Puerto Vallarta): The stylish Verana adds a
dash of sophistication to funky Yelapa — a remote village accessi-
ble only by boat, about 45 minutes from Puerto Vallarta. Each of the
six handcrafted casas has a unique architectural style that comple-
ments the expanse of vistas to the surrounding jungle and ocean.
It’s a perfect blend of style, romance, and nature. See Chapter 16.
 Quinta María Cortez (Puerto Vallarta): This is one of Mexico’s
most original places to stay; it’s an eclectic B&B uniquely deco-
rated with antiques, curios, and original art. It sits on a beautiful
cove on Conchas Chinas beach. See Chapter 16.
 La Casa Que Canta (Zihuatanejo): This architecturally dramatic
hotel incorporates wonderful Mexican adobe and folk art in grandly
scaled rooms. It’s a delightful place to unwind, read on the terrace
overlooking the bay, and order room service. See Chapter 20.
 Casa Natalia (San José del Cabo): This renovated historic home,
now a charming inn, is an oasis of palms, waterfalls, and flowers
against the desert landscape. Each room and suite is an artful com-
bination of modern architecture and traditional Mexican touches.
The restaurant is the hottest in town. See Chapter 30.
 Hotel Jungla Caribe (Playa del Carmen): In a town filled with
exceptional inns, this one’s a standout. The eclectic décor com-
bines neoclassical details with a decidedly tropical touch. The
rooms and suites surround a stylish courtyard, restaurant, and
pool. You couldn’t be better located — a block from the beach, with
an entrance on happening Avenida 5. See Chapter 15.
The Best Active Vacations
With the ocean as tempting as it is off of Mexico’s miles of coastline, you’re
certain to find multiple ways to enjoy it above and below the surface.
There’s also plenty to do on land as well. Here are our favorite things to do: 
 Golf in Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta: Puerto Vallarta, with its
seven championship courses, is the new destination for golfers to
keep their eyes on. See Chapter 19. The Corridor between San José
del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas is one of the world’s premier golf 
destinations, with five championship courses open and a total of
207 holes slated for the area. See Chapter 33.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Mexico’s Beach Resorts 17

 Cenote Diving on the Yucatán Mainland: Dive into the clear
depths of the Yucatán’s cenotes for an interesting twist on under-
water exploration. The Maya considered the cenotes sacred — and
their vivid colors indeed seem otherworldly. Most are located
between Playa del Carmen and Tulum, and dive shops in these
areas regularly run trips for experienced divers. For recommended
dive shops, see Chapter 15.
 Scuba Diving in Cozumel and along the Yucatán’s Caribbean
Coast: The coral reefs off the island, Mexico’s premier diving desti-
nation, are among the top five dive spots in the world, though
damage from 2005’s Hurricane Wilma has affected some areas. The
Yucatán’s coastal reef, part of the second-largest reef system in the
world, affords excellent diving all along the coast. Especially beauti-
ful is the Chinchorro Reef, lying 32km (20 miles) offshore from
Majahual or Xcalak. Diving from Isla Mujeres is also quite spectacu-
lar. See Chapters 14 and 15.
 Surfing Zicatela Beach in Puerto Escondido: This world-class
break is a lure for surfers from around the globe. It challenges the
best in the sport each September and October, when the waves
peak and the annual surf competitions take place. See Chapter 29.
Other noted surf breaks in Mexico include Sayulita and Las Islitas
Beach near San Blas (both north of Puerto Vallarta), and Playa
Costa Azul, on the outskirts of San José del Cabo. See Chapter 33.
 Sportfishing in Cabo San Lucas: Billfishing for magnificent marlin
and sailfish is a popular sport throughout southern Baja, and it’s
what originally put Cabo San Lucas on the map. See Chapter 33.
Fishing is also excellent in Puerto Vallarta, and Zihuatanejo. See
Chapters 19 and 23.
 Sea Kayaking in the Sea of Cortez: From Cabo San Lucas to La Paz,
and continuing north, the Sea of Cortez is a sea kayaker’s dream. 
It has dozens of tiny coves and impressive inlets to pull into and
explore, under the watchful gaze of sea lions and dolphins.
Professional outfitters provide gear, guides, and instruction for
novices. See Chapter 33.
 Exploring the Bays of Huatulco: Whether you travel by party boat
or in a small skiff to a pristine cove, the nine Bays of Huatulco offer
beach lovers a treasure-trove of sand and sea pleasures. See
Chapter 28.
 Whale-Watching in Puerto Vallarta’s Banderas Bay: From
December to May each year, the magnificent humpback whales
make their annual migration to these waters to breed and bear
calfs. Watching these mammoth yet highly social sea mammals
entertain an audience is a truly life-enhancing experience. See
Chapter 19. Whale-watching is also a popular pastime in mid-Baja’s
Magdalena Bay, with trips available from Cabo San Lucas. See
Chapter 33.

The Best Dining Experiences
Best doesn’t necessarily mean most luxurious. Although some of the
restaurants listed here are fancy affairs, others are simple places to get
fine, authentic Mexican cuisine:
 Arrayán, for Tacos Like You’ve Never Before Tasted (Puerto
Vallarta): The colorful atmosphere may be casual, funky, and fun,
but the food is seriously and authentically Mexican. Prime beef filet
tacos are just one specialty — others include Mexican duck confit,
shrimp pozole (broth with hominy and shrimp), and homemade ice
creams from indigenous fruits. See Chapter 18.
 El Mirador, for Margaritas (Acapulco, in the Hotel Plaza Las
Glorias): You can enjoy a great margarita at many places in Mexico,
but this is the only one that serves them with a view of the spectac-
ular La Quebrada cliff divers. See Chapter 24.
 Labná: A showcase of authentic Yucatecan cuisine and music, in
downtown Cancún, this is the place to sample regional specialties
such as pork pibil (pit-baked pork) and poc chuc (slices of pork
with onion, marinated in a tangy orange sauce). See Chapter 12.
 Pozole in Acapulco: If it’s Thursday, there will always be pozole in
Acapulco. Sample this locally popular meal comprised of hominy
and meat in a broth garnished with savory seasonings. Our favorite
place to indulge is at the cliffside restaurant at the Los Flamigos
Hotel. See Chapter 24.
 El Cafecito, for Mango Eclairs and Coffee (Puerto Escondido):
Worthy of the trip to Puerto Escondido itself are El Cafecito’s
mango éclairs, accompanied by a steaming mug of coffee and
served beachside on Playa Zicatela. Also noteworthy are the ample
“surfer’s special” breakfasts at numerous other cafes along the
beachfront. See Chapter 29.
 Cabaña del Pescador (Lobster House; Cozumel): If you want an
ideally seasoned, succulent lobster dinner, Cabaña del Pescador
(Lobster House) is the place. If you want anything else, you’re out
of luck — lobster dinner, expertly prepared, is all it serves. When
you’ve achieved perfection, why bother with anything else? See
Chapter 14.
 Media Luna (Playa del Carmen): The inviting atmosphere of this
sidewalk cafe on Avenida 5 is enough to lure you in. The expertly
executed and innovative menu, together with great prices, makes it
one of the top choices on the Caribbean coast. See Chapter 15.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Mexico’s Beach Resorts 19

The Best Shopping
Beyond the ubiquitous T-shirts and glass pyramids, you’ll find captivat-
ing treasures to take home from your trip to Mexico’s beach resorts.
Here are our favorite shopping experiences:
 Huichol Art in Puerto Vallarta: One of the last indigenous cultures
to remain faithful to their customs, language, and traditions, the
Huichol Indians come down from the Sierra Madre to sell their
unusual art to Puerto Vallarta galleries. Inspired by visions received
during spiritual ceremonies, the Huichol create their art with color-
ful yarn or beads pressed into wax. See Chapter 19.
 Oaxacan Textiles in Huatulco: The valley of Oaxaca produces the
best weavings and naturally dyed textiles in Mexico; it’s also famous
for its pottery (especially the black pottery), and colorful, imagina-
tive woodcarvings. Both can be found in shops in Huatulco, on
Oaxaca’s coast. See Chapter 28.
 Taxco Silver: Mexico’s silver capital, Taxco, has hundreds of stores
featuring fine jewelry and decorative objects. See Chapter 27.
 Resort Wear in Cancún: Resort clothing — especially if you can
find a sale — can be a bargain here. And the selection may be wider
than what’s available at home. Almost every mall on the island 
contains trendy boutiques that specialize in locally designed and
imported clothing. See Chapter 13.
 Duty Free in Cancún or Los Cabos: If you’re looking for European
perfume, fine watches, or other imported goods, you’ll find the
prices in the duty-free shops in both Cancún (at the major malls on
the island and in downtown Cancún) and in Los Cabos hard to beat.
See Chapters 13 and 33.
 Precious Gemstones in Isla Mujeres: Isla Mujeres, also a duty-free
zone, offers an impressive selection of both precious stones and
superb craftsmen who can make jewelry designs to order. See
Chapter 13.
 Quinta Avenida, Playa del Carmen: This pedestrian-only street
offers leisurely shopping at its best. No cars, no hassle, simply
stroll down the street and let your eye pick out objects of interest.
Expect a good bit of merchandise popular with counterculture
types, such as batik clothing and fabric, Guatemalan textiles, and
inventive jewelry and artwork. But you’ll also find quality Mexican
handicrafts, premium tequilas, and Cuban cigars. See Chapter 15.
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts

The Best Nightlife
Rivaling the midday sun on the beach, most of Mexico’s coastal resorts
have a simmering hot nightlife. Here are the liveliest places for nocturnal
diversion among Mexico’s Beach Resorts:
 Puerto Vallarta: Of all the beach destinations, Puerto Vallarta
enjoys the most sophisticated and varied nightlife. An excellent
selection of small clubs features live jazz, blues, salsa, and good old
rock ’n’ roll. You’ll also find mariachi, pre-Columbian, and tradi-
tional Mexican ballads. Heating up the scene are a new group of
contemporary clubs and lounges — including the international set
at Nikki Beach — with DJs spinning house, trance, and chill. See
Chapter 19.
 Acapulco Discos: Nightlife can’t possibly get more lavish, extrava-
gant, or flashy than it is in Acapulco, Mexico’s hands-down diva.
This city’s main cultural attractions are the clubs that jam until
sunrise, several of which have walls of windows overlooking the
bay. See Chapter 27.
 Cancún’s Clubs in Malls: Cancún’s wide-ranging hot spots include
most of the name-brand nightlife destinations, concentrated in
entertainment malls and festival shopping centers, as well as hotel-
lobby bars with live music, and sophisticated discos. Popular
nightlife tours allow you to bypass lines and sample various clubs
in a single night. The clubs here can accommodate up to 3,000, and
there are plenty of options for staying out until the sun comes up.
See Chapter 13.
 Cabo San Lucas Beach Bars: In the nightlife capital of Baja California,
after-dark fun centers on the casual bars and restaurants that line
the main drag, as well as those on the town’s public Medano Beach.
The place retains a rowdy, outlaw feel, despite the influx of tony
hotels nearby. A new lounge scene is, thankfully, updating this lively
town’s nightlife. See Chapter 33.
 Quinta Avenida, Playa del Carmen: Stroll along the lively, pedes-
trian-only Fifth Avenue to find the bar that’s right for you. With live
music venues, tequila bars, sports bars, and cafes, you’re sure to
find something to fit your mood. See Chapter 15.

Digging Deeper 
into Mexico
In This Chapter
 Uncovering Mexico’s fascinating past
 Discovering the delicacies of Mexican dining
 Mastering a few key words and phrases in Spanish
T
he resorts of Mexico are known for a dazzling array of every type 
of beach — from glorious white-sand beaches bordering tranquil,
translucent waters, to dramatic cliffs alongside crashing waves. It would
be easy to let that be the sole draw to this destination, but there’s so
much more here to enjoy. Mexico’s rich history has left mysteries still to
be discovered, and ruins that make for popular explorations. So, what’s
the story behind them?
In this chapter, we’ll relay a brief history of Mexico and its cultural high-
points. We’ll sample the unusual and memorable culinary specialties of
the region, and we’ll even provide some tips to the local lingo, as well as
some recommended reading and films that will help you enjoy this place
much more than you would if you limit your perspective to a beach blan-
ket in the sand.
Introducing Mexico
Mexico stretches nearly 3,220km (2,000 miles) from east to west and
more than 1,600km (1,000 miles) north to south. Only one-fifth the size
of the United States, its territory includes trackless deserts in the north,
dense jungles in the south, thousands of miles of lush seacoast and
beaches along the Pacific and Caribbean, and the central highlands,
crisscrossed by mountain ranges. Mexico has close to 100 million inhabi-
tants, and 22 million of them live in the capital, Mexico City. By most
measurements, the disparity between rich and poor has increased in the
last 30 to 40 years. Cycles of boom and bust weigh heavier on the poor

than on the rich. But in the face of all of this, Mexican society shows
great resilience, due in part to the values Mexicans live by. For them,
family and friends, social gatherings, and living in the present remain
eminently important. In Mexico, there is always time to meet relatives 
or friends for a drink, a cup of coffee, or a special occasion.
Mexico’s mysterious ancient inhabitants, the Aztecs and the Maya, are
another fascinating part of this land. The ancients left behind elegant
and mysterious ruins that, despite all that we now know, seem to defy
interpretation. Almost every year, archaeological excavation leads to the
discovery of more ruins, adding to a growing picture of an urban civiliza-
tion that thrived in an area where only scantily populated jungle now
exists. What can we make of such a civilization? What value do we
accord the Maya among the other lost civilizations of the ancient world?
Even this is unclear, but the art and architecture they left behind are
stunning expressions of a rich and complex cosmological view.
Then there was the arrival of the Spaniards, in the early 1500s — an
event that in hindsight seems almost apocalyptic. Military conquest and
old-world diseases decimated the native population. A new social order
predicated on a starkly different religion rose in place of the old one.
Through all of this, the Maya held on to their language but lost most of
the living memory of their pre-Hispanic ways. What they retained they
cloaked in the language of myth and legend that was worked into a
rough synthesis of old and new. They selectively appropriated elements
of the new religion that could help make sense of the world, and this
process continues today in the many Maya communities that have
native churches.
For these reasons and more, Mexico is a curious place; it may beckon
you with its enticing beaches and tropical climate, but what will ulti-
mately hold your attention is the unique character of the land and its
people. There is no other place like it.
History 101: The Main Events
Mexico’s history extends much longer than that of her neighbor to the
north. Once the center of civilization in the Western Hemisphere, Mexico’s
ancient civilizations were sophisticated and cultured. While the Aztecs
settled in central Mexico — at the site of present-day Mexico City, the
Yucatán was home to the Maya, and remnants of their advanced, mysteri-
ous civilization are still being found, unlocking clues to this fascinating
culture. Modern-day Mexicans are proud of their deep, rich history, and
you will find integrated within many aspects of daily life a bow to the 
mysticism and sacred traditions of ancient times.
Pre-Hispanic Civilizations
The earliest “Mexicans” were perhaps Stone Age hunter-gatherers
coming from the north, descendants of a race that had crossed the
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Mexico 23

Bering Strait and reached North America around 12,000 B.C. This is the
prevailing theory, but there is a growing body of evidence that points to
an earlier crossing of peoples from Asia to the New World. What we
know for certain is that Mexico was populated by 10,000 B.C. Sometime
between 5200 and 1500 B.C. they began practicing agriculture and domes-
ticating animals.
The Pre-Classic Period (1500 B.C.–A.D. 300)
Eventually, agriculture improved to the point that it could provide
enough food to support large communities and enough surplus to free
some of the population from agricultural work. A civilization emerged
that we call the Olmec — an enigmatic people who settled the lower
Gulf Coast in what is now Tabasco and Veracruz. Anthropologists regard
them as the mother culture of Mesoamerica because they established a
pattern for later civilizations in a wide area stretching from northern
Mexico into Central America. The Olmec developed the basic calendar
used throughout the region, established principles of urban layout and
architecture, and originated the cult of the jaguar and the sacredness 
of jade. They may also have bequeathed the sacred ritual of “the ball
game” — a universal element of Mesoamerican culture.
The Maya civilization began developing in the pre-Classic period, around
500 B.C. Our understanding of this period is only sketchy, but Olmec
influences are apparent everywhere. The Maya perfected the Olmec 
calendar and, somewhere along the way, developed their ornate system
of hieroglyphic writing and their early architecture. Two other civiliza-
tions also began their rise to prominence around this time: the people 
of Teotihuacán, just north of present-day Mexico City, and the Zapotec of
Monte Albán, in the valley of Oaxaca.
The Classic Period (A.D. 300–900)
The flourishing of these three civilizations marks the boundaries of 
this period — the heyday of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artistic and
cultural achievements. These include the pyramids and palaces in
Teotihuacán; the ceremonial center of Monte Albán; and the stelae and
temples of Palenque, Bonampak, and the Tikal site in Guatemala. Beyond
their achievements in art and architecture, the Maya made significant
discoveries in science, including the use of zero in mathematics and a
complex calendar with which the priests could predict eclipses and the
movements of the stars for centuries to come.
The inhabitants of Teotihuacán (100 B.C.–A.D. 700, near present-day
Mexico City) built a city that, at its zenith, is thought to have had
100,000 or more inhabitants covering 14 sq. km (51⁄2 sq. miles). It was a
well-organized city, built on a grid with streams channeled to follow the
city’s plan. Different social classes, such as artisans and merchants,
were assigned to specific neighborhoods. Teotihuacán exerted tremen-
dous influence as far away as Guatemala and the Yucatán Peninsula. Its
feathered serpent god, later known as Quetzalcoatl, became part of the
pantheon of many succeeding cultures, including the Toltecs, who
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
24

brought the cult to the Yucatán where the god became known as
Kukulkán. The ruling classes were industrious, literate, and cosmopoli-
tan. The beautiful sculpture and ceramics of Teotihuacán display a
highly stylized and refined aesthetic whose influences can be seen
clearly in objects of Maya and Zapotec origin. Around the seventh cen-
tury, the city was abandoned for unknown reasons. Who these people
were and where they went remains a mystery.
Farther south, the Zapotec, influenced by the Olmec, raised an impres-
sive civilization in the region of Oaxaca. Their two principal cities were
Monte Albán, inhabited by an elite class of merchants and artisans, and
Mitla, reserved for the high priests.
The Post-Classic Period (A.D. 900–1521)
Warfare became a more conspicuous activity of the civilizations that
flourished in this period. Social development was impressive but not as
cosmopolitan as the Maya, Teotihuacán, and Zapotec societies. In cen-
tral Mexico, a people known as the Toltec established their capital at
Tula in the 10th century. They were originally one of the barbarous
hordes of Indians that periodically migrated from the north. At some
stage in their development, the Toltec were influenced by remnants of
Teotihuacán culture and adopted the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl as
their god. They also revered a god known as Tezcatlipoca, or “smoking
mirror,” who later became a god of the Aztecs. By the 13th century, how-
ever, the Toltec had exhausted themselves, probably in civil wars and in
battles with the invaders from the north.
Of those northern invaders, the Aztecs were the most warlike. At first they
served as mercenaries for established cities in the valley of Mexico — one
of which allotted them an unwanted, marshy piece of land in the middle of
Lake Texcoco for their settlement. It eventually grew into the island city 
of Tenochtitlán. Through aggressive diplomacy and military action, the
Aztec soon conquered central Mexico and extended their rule east to the
Gulf Coast and south to the valley of Oaxaca.
During this period, the Maya built beautiful cities near the Yucatán’s
Puuc hills. The regional architecture, called Puuc style, is characterized
by elaborate exterior stonework appearing above door frames and
extending to the roofline. Examples of this architecture, such as the
Codz Poop at Kabah and the palaces at Uxmal, Sayil, and Labná, are
beautiful and quite impressive.
The precise nature of this Toltec influence is a subject of debate. But
there is an intriguing myth in central Mexico that tells how Quetzalcoatl
quarrels with Tezcatlipoca and through trickery is shamed by his rival
into leaving Tula, the capital of the Toltec empire. He leaves heading
eastward towards the morning star, vowing someday to return. In the
language of myth, this could be a shorthand telling of an actual civil war
between two factions in Tula, each led by the priesthood of a particular
god. Could the losing faction have migrated to the Yucatán and formed
the ruling class of Chichén Itzá? Perhaps. What we do know for certain 
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Mexico 25

is that this myth of the eventual return of Quetzalcoatl became, in the
hands of the Spanish, a powerful weapon of conquest.
The Conquest
In 1517, the first Spaniards arrived in Mexico and skirmished with Maya
Indians off the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. One of the fledgling expe-
ditions ended in a shipwreck, leaving several Spaniards stranded as pris-
oners of the Maya. The Spanish sent out another expedition, under the
command of Hernán Cortez, which landed on Cozumel in February
1519. Cortez inquired about the gold and riches of the interior, and the
coastal Maya were happy to describe the wealth and splendor of the
Aztec empire in central Mexico. Cortez promptly disobeyed all orders
from his superior, the governor of Cuba, and sailed to the mainland.
He and his army arrived when the Aztec empire was at the height of its
wealth and power. Moctezuma II ruled over the central and southern
highlands and extracted tribute from lowland peoples. His greatest tem-
ples were literally plated with gold and encrusted with the blood of sacrifi-
cial captives. Moctezuma was a fool, a mystic, and something of a coward.
Despite his wealth and military power, he dithered in his capital at
Tenochtitlán, sending messengers with gifts and suggestions that Cortez
leave. Meanwhile, Cortez negotiated his way into the highlands, always
cloaking his real intentions. Moctezuma, terrified, convinced himself that
Cortez was in fact the god Quetzalcoatl making his long-awaited return. 
By the time the Spaniards arrived in the Aztec capital, Cortez had gained
some ascendancy over the lesser Indian states that were resentful tribu-
taries to the Aztec. In November 1519, Cortez confronted Moctezuma and
took him hostage in an effort to leverage control of the empire.
In the middle of Cortez’s dangerous game of manipulation, another
Spanish expedition arrived with orders to end Cortez’s authority over
the mission. Cortez hastened to meet the rival’s force and persuade
them to join his own. In the meantime, the Aztec chased the garrison out
of Tenochtitlán, and either they or the Spaniards killed Moctezuma. For
the next year and a half, Cortez laid siege to Tenochtitlán, with the help
of rival Indians and a decimating epidemic of smallpox, to which the
Indians had no resistance. In the end, the Aztec capital fell, and, when it
did, all of central Mexico lay at the feet of the conquistadors.
Having begun as a pirate expedition by Cortez and his men without the
authority of the Spanish crown or its governor in Cuba, the conquest of
Mexico resulted in a vast expansion of the Spanish empire. The king
legitimized Cortez following his victory over the Aztec and ordered the
forced conversion to Christianity of this new colony, to be called New
Spain. In the two centuries that followed, Franciscan and Augustinian
friars converted millions of Indians to Christianity, and the Spanish lords
built huge feudal estates on which the Indian farmers were little more
than serfs. The silver and gold that Cortez looted made Spain the richest
country in Europe.

26

The Colonial Period
Hernán Cortez set about building a new city upon the ruins of the old
Aztec capital. Over the three centuries of the colonial period, Spain
became rich from New World gold and silver, chiseled out by Indian
labor. A new class system developed. Those born in Spain considered
themselves superior to the criollos (Spaniards born in Mexico). Those of
other races and the castas (mixtures of Spanish and Indian, Spanish and
African, or Indian and African) occupied the bottom rungs of society. It
took great cunning to stay a step ahead of the avaricious Crown, which
demanded increasing taxes and contributions from its fabled foreign
conquests. Still, wealthy colonists prospered enough to develop an
extravagant society.
However, discontent with the mother country simmered for years. In
1808, Napoleon invaded Spain and crowned his brother Joseph king in
place of Charles IV. To many in Mexico, allegiance to France was out of
the question; discontent reached the level of revolt.
Independence
The rebellion began in 1810, when Father Miguel Hidalgo gave the 
grito, a cry for independence, from his church in the town of Dolores,
Guanajuato. The uprising soon became a full-fledged revolution, as
Hidalgo and Ignacio Allende gathered an “army” of citizens and threat-
ened Mexico City. Although Hidalgo ultimately failed and was executed,
he is honored as “the Father of Mexican Independence.” Independence
from Spain was finally achieved on September 28, 1821.
Political instability engulfed the young republic, which ran through a
dizzying succession of presidents and dictators as struggles between
federalists and centralists, and conservatives and liberals, divided the
country. Moreover, Mexico waged a disastrous war with the United
States, which resulted in the loss of half its territory.
Political instability persisted, and included a brief period where the con-
trol of the country was assumed by Archduke Maximilian of Austria, who
accepted the position of Mexican emperor with the support of French
troops, until he was captured and executed by a firing squad in 1867. His
adversary and successor (as president of Mexico) was Benito Juárez, a
Zapotec Indian lawyer and one of the great heroes of Mexican history.
Juárez did his best to unify and strengthen his country before dying of a
heart attack in 1872; his impact on Mexico’s future was profound, and
his plans and visions bore fruit for decades.
The Porfiriato and the Revolution
A few years after Juárez’s death, one of his generals, Porfirio Díaz,
assumed power in a coup. He ruled Mexico from 1877 to 1911, a period
now called the “Porfiriato.” He stayed in power through repressive 
measures and by courting the favor of powerful nations. With foreign
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Mexico 27

investment came the concentration of great wealth in few hands, and
social conditions worsened.
In 1910, Francisco Madero called for an armed rebellion that became the
Mexican Revolution (“La Revolución” in Mexico; the revolution against
Spain is the “La Guerra de Independencia”). Díaz was sent into exile.
Madero became president, but was promptly betrayed and executed. For
the next few years, the revolutionaries fought among themselves, until
Lázaro Cárdenas was elected in 1934, instituting reforms that solidified
the outcome of the Revolution. He implemented massive redistribution
of land, nationalized the oil industry, and gave shape to the ruling politi-
cal party (now the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI) by
bringing a broad representation of Mexican society under its banner and
establishing mechanisms for consensus building. Most Mexicans practi-
cally canonize Cárdenas.
Modern Mexico
The presidents who followed were noted more for graft than for leader-
ship. The party’s base narrowed as many of the reform-minded elements
were marginalized. Economic progress, a lot of it in the form of large
development projects, became the PRI’s main basis for legitimacy.
Though the PRI maintained its grip on power, it lost all semblance of
being a progressive party.
In the years that followed, opposition political parties grew in power and
legitimacy. Facing pressure and scrutiny from national and international
organizations, and widespread public discontent, the PRI had to con-
cede defeat in state and congressional elections throughout the ’90s.
Elements of the PRI pushed for, and achieved, reforms from within and
greater political openness. This led to deep divisions between party
activists, rancorous campaigns for party leadership, and even political
assassination. The party began choosing its candidates through primar-
ies instead of by appointment.
But in the presidential elections of 2000, Vicente Fox of the opposition
party PAN won by a landslide. In hindsight, there was no way that the
PRI could have won in a fair election. For most Mexicans, a government
under the PRI was all that they had ever known. Many voted for Fox just
to see whether the PRI would let go of power. It did, and the transition
ran smoothly thanks in large part to the outgoing president, Ernesto
Zedillo, who was one of the PRI’s reformers.
Since then Mexico has sailed into the uncharted waters of coalition 
politics, with three main parties, PRI, PAN, and PRD. To the credit of the
parties, the sailing has been much smoother than many observers pre-
dicted. But the real test will be weathering the economic slowdown that
accompanied the downturn in the U.S. economy, and in carrying out the
next presidential elections in 2006.

Building Blocks: Local Architecture
Mexico’s artistic and architectural legacy reaches back more than 3,000
years. Until the conquest of Mexico in A.D. 1521, art, architecture, poli-
tics, and religion were intertwined. Although the European conquest
influenced the style and subject of Mexican art, this continuity remained
throughout the colonial period.
Pre-Hispanic Forms
Mexico’s pyramids were truncated platforms crowned with a temple.
Many sites have circular buildings, such as El Caracol at Chichén Itzá,
usually called the observatory and dedicated to the god of the wind. El
Castillo at Chichén Itzá has 365 steps — one for every day of the year.
The Temple of the Magicians at Uxmal has beautifully rounded and slop-
ing sides. Evidence of building one pyramidal structure on top of another,
a widely accepted practice, has been found throughout Mesoamerica.
Architects of many Toltec, Aztec, and Teotihuacán edifices alternated
sloping panels (talud) with vertical panels (tablero). Elements of this
style occasionally show up in the Yucatán. Dzibanché, a newly exca-
vated site near Lago Bacalar, in southern Quintana Roo state, has at
least one temple with this characteristic. The true arch was unknown in
Mesoamerica, but the Maya made use of the corbelled arch — a method
of stacking stones that allows each successive stone to be cantilevered
out a little farther than the one below it, until the two sides meet at the
top, forming an inverted V.
Throughout Mexico, carved stone and mural art on pyramids served 
a religious and historic function rather than an ornamental one.
Hieroglyphs, picture symbols etched on stone or painted on walls or pot-
tery, functioned as the written language of the ancient peoples, particu-
larly the Maya. By deciphering the glyphs, scholars allow the ancients 
to speak again, providing us with specific names to attach to rulers and
their families, and demystifying the great dynastic histories of the Maya.
For more on this, read A Forest of Kings (1990), by Linda Schele and David
Freidel, and Blood of Kings (1986), by Linda Schele and Mary Ellen Miller.
Carving important historic figures on freestanding stone slabs, or stelae,
was a common Maya commemorative device. Several are in place at
Cobá; Calakmul has the most, and good examples are on display in the
Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City and the archaeology museum in
Villahermosa. Pottery played an important role, and different indigenous
groups are distinguished by their different use of color and style. The
Maya painted pottery with scenes from daily and historic life.
Pre-Hispanic cultures left a number of fantastic painted murals, some 
of which are remarkably preserved, such as those at Bonampak and
Cacaxtla. Amazing stone murals or mosaics, using thousands of pieces
of fitted stone to form figures of warriors, snakes, or geometric designs,
decorate the pyramid facades at Uxmal and Chichén Itzá.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Mexico 29

Spanish Influence
With the arrival of the Spaniards, new forms of architecture came to
Mexico. Many sites that were occupied by indigenous groups at the time
of the conquest were razed, and in their place appeared Catholic
churches, public buildings, and palaces for conquerors and the king’s
bureaucrats. In the Yucatán, churches at Izamal, Tecoh, Santa Elena, and
Muná rest atop former pyramidal structures. Indian artisans, who for-
merly worked on pyramidal structures, were recruited to build the new
buildings, often guided by drawings of European buildings. Frequently
left on their own, the indigenous artisans implanted traditional symbol-
ism in the new buildings: a plaster angel swaddled in feathers, reminis-
cent of the god Quetzalcoatl, and the face of an ancient god surrounded
by corn leaves. They used pre-Hispanic calendar counts — the 13 steps
to heaven or the nine levels of the underworld — to determine how
many florets to carve around the church doorway.
To convert the native populations, New World Spanish priests and archi-
tects altered their normal ways of teaching and building. Often before the
church was built, an open-air atrium was constructed to accommodate
large numbers of parishioners for services. Posas (shelters) at the four
corners of churchyards were another architectural technique unique to
Mexico, again to accommodate crowds. Because of the language barrier
between the Spanish and the natives, church adornment became more
explicit. Biblical tales came to life in frescoes splashed across church
walls. Christian symbolism in stone supplanted that of pre-Hispanic ideas
as the natives tried to make sense of it all. Baroque became even more
baroque in Mexico and was dubbed Churrigueresque or ultrabaroque.
Exuberant and complicated, it combines Gothic, baroque, and Plateresque
elements.
Almost every village in Mexico has the remains of missions, monaster-
ies, convents, and parish churches. Many were built in the 16th century
following the early arrival of Franciscan friars. Examples include the
Mission of San Bernardino de Sisal in Valladolid; the fine altarpiece at
Teabo; the folk-art retablo (altarpiece) at Tecoh; the large church and
convent at Mani with its retablos and limestone crucifix; the facade, altar,
and central retablo of the church at Oxkutzcab; the 16-bell belfry at
Ytholin; the baroque facade and altarpiece at Maxcanu; the cathedral at
Mérida; the vast atrium and church at Izamal; and the baroque retablo
and murals at Tabi.
Religion, Myth, and Folklore
Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic, a religion introduced by the
Spaniards during the Conquest of Mexico. Despite its preponderance,
the Catholic faith in many places in Mexico has pre-Hispanic undercur-
rents. You need only visit the curandero section of a Mexican market
(where you can purchase copal, an incense agreeable to the gods; rustic
beeswax candles, a traditional offering; the native species of tobacco
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
30

used to ward off evil; and so on), or attend a village festivity featuring
pre-Hispanic dancers, to understand that supernatural beliefs often run
parallel with Christian ones.
Mexico’s complicated mythological heritage from pre-Hispanic religion is
full of images derived from nature — the wind, jaguars, eagles, snakes,
flowers, and more — all intertwined with elaborate mythological stories
to explain the universe, climate, seasons, and geography. Most groups
believed in an underworld (not a hell), usually containing nine levels,
and a heaven of 13 levels — which is why the numbers 9 and 13 are so
mythologically significant. The solar calendar count of 365 days and the
ceremonial calendar of 260 days are significant as well. How one died
determined one’s resting place after death: in the underworld (Xibalba
to the Maya), in heaven, or at one of the four cardinal points. For exam-
ple, men who died in battle or women who died in childbirth went
straight to the sun. Everyone else first had to make a journey through
the underworld.
Taste of the Yucatán: Local Cuisine
Authentic Mexican food differs dramatically from what is frequently
served in the United States under that name. For many, Mexico will be
new and exciting culinary territory.
Despite regional differences, some generalizations can be made. Mexican
food usually isn’t pepper-hot when it arrives at the table (though many
dishes must have a certain amount of piquancy, and some home cooking
can be very spicy, depending on a family’s or chef’s tastes). Chiles and
sauces add piquant flavor after the food is served; you’ll never see a
table in Mexico without one or both of these condiments. Mexicans
don’t drown their cooking in cheese and sour cream, a la Tex-Mex, and
they use a great variety of ingredients. But the basis of Mexican food is
simple — tortillas, beans, chiles, and tomatoes — the same as it was
centuries ago, before the Europeans arrived.
Throughout Mexico, you’ll frequently encounter these basic foods.
Traditional tortillas are of the corn variety — they are actually made
from a paste of ground corn, water, and lime, called masa. This grainy
dough is patted and pressed into flat round cakes, tortillas, or take on a
variety of other shapes that hold meat or other fillings.
A taco is anything folded or rolled into a tortilla, and sometimes a double
tortilla. The tortilla can be served either soft or fried. Flautas and que-
sadillas are species of tacos. For Mexicans, the taco is the quintessential
fast food, and the taco stand (taquería) — a ubiquitous sight — is a great
place to get a filling meal.
Chiles are also a staple in Mexico. Many kinds of chile peppers exist, and
Mexicans call each of them by one name when they’re fresh and another
when they’re dried. Some are blazing hot with only a mild flavor; some
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Mexico 31

are mild but have a rich, complex flavor. They can be pickled, smoked,
stuffed, stewed, chopped, and used in an endless variety of dishes.
As distinctive as the food itself is the meal system in Mexico. The morn-
ing meal, known as el desayuno, can be something light, such as coffee
and sweet bread, or something more substantial: eggs, beans, tortillas,
bread, fruit, and juice. It can be eaten early or late and is always a sure
bet in Mexico. The variety and sweetness of the fruits is remarkable, and
you can’t go wrong with Mexican egg dishes.
In Mexico, the main meal of the day, known as la comida (or el
almuerzo), is eaten between 2 and 4 p.m. Stores and businesses close,
and most people go home to eat and perhaps take a short afternoon
siesta before going about their business. The first course is the sopa,
which can be either soup (caldo) or rice (sopa de arroz) or both; then
comes the main course, which ideally is a meat or fish dish prepared in
some kind of sauce and served with beans, followed by dessert.

Gods and Goddesses
Each of the ancient cultures had its gods and goddesses, and while the names might not
have crossed cultures, their characteristics or purposes often did. Chaac, the hook-nosed
rain god of the Maya, was Tlaloc, the squat rain god of the Aztecs; Quetzalcoatl, the
plumed-serpent god/man of the Toltecs, became Kukulkán of the Maya. The tales of the
powers and creation of these deities make up Mexico’s rich mythology. Sorting out the
pre-Hispanic pantheon and beliefs in ancient Mexico can become an all-consuming study
(the Maya alone had 166 deities), so here’s a list of some of the most important gods:
Chaac
Maya rain god.
Ehécatl
Wind god whose temple is usually round; another aspect of Quetzalcoatl.
Itzamná
Maya god above all, who invented corn, cacao, and writing and reading.
Ixchel
Maya goddess of water, weaving, and childbirth.
Kinich Ahau
Maya sun god.
Kukulkán
Quetzalcoatl’s name in the Yucatán.
Ometeotl
God/goddess, all-powerful creator of the universe, and ruler of heaven,
earth, and the underworld.
Quetzalcoatl
A mortal who took on legendary characteristics as a god (or vice
versa). When he left Tula in shame after a night of succumbing to temptations, he
promised to return. He reappeared in the Yucatán. He is also symbolized as Venus, the
moving star, and Ehécatl, the wind god. Quetzalcoatl is credited with giving the Maya
cacao (chocolate) and teaching them how to grow it, harvest it, roast it, and turn it
into a drink with ceremonial and magical properties.
Tlaloc
Aztec rain god.

Between 8 and 10 p.m., most Mexicans have a light meal called la cena. If
eaten at home, it is something like a sandwich, bread and jam, or perhaps
a couple of tacos made from some of the day’s leftovers. At restaurants,
the most common thing to eat is antojitos (literally, “little cravings”), a
general label for light fare. Antojitos include tostadas, tamales, tacos, and
simple enchiladas, and are big hits with travelers. Large restaurants offer
complete meals as well.
There are also some unique attributes to beverages in Mexico. All over
the country you’ll find shops selling jugos (juices) and licuados
(smoothies) made from several kinds of tropical fruit. They’re excellent
and refreshing; while traveling, we take full advantage of them. You’ll
also come across aguas frescas — water flavored with hibiscus, melon,
tamarind, or lime. Soft drinks come in more flavors than in any other
country we know. Pepsi and Coca-Cola taste the way they did in the
United States years ago, before the makers started adding corn syrup.
The coffee is generally good, and hot chocolate is a traditional drink, as
is atole — a hot, corn-based beverage that can be sweet or bitter.
Of course, Mexico has a proud and lucrative beer-brewing tradition.
Mezcal and tequila come from the agave plant, which is not a type of
cactus, but is actually a distant cousin of the lily. Tequila is a variety of
mezcal produced from the A. tequilana species of agave in and around
the area of Tequila, in the state of Jalisco. Mezcal comes from various
parts of Mexico and from different varieties of agave. The distilling
process is usually much less sophisticated than that of tequila, and, with
its stronger smell and taste, mezcal is much more easily detected on the
drinker’s breath. In some places, it comes with a worm in the bottle; you
are supposed to eat the worm after polishing off the mezcal. ¡Salud!

John L. Stephens’s Incidents of Travel in the Yucatan, Vol. I and II (Dover
Publications) are considered among the great books of archaeological
discovery, as well as being travel classics. The two volumes chart the
course of Stephens’s discoveries of the Yucatán, beginning in 1841.
Before his expeditions, little was known of the region, and the Mayan
culture had not been discovered. During his travels, Stephens found and
described 44 Mayan sites, and his account of these remains the most
authoritative in existence.
For contemporary culture, start with Octavio Paz’s classic, The Labyrinth
of Solitude (Grove Press), which still generates controversy among
Mexicans. Lesley Byrd Simpson’s Many Mexicos (University of California
Press) provides a comprehensive account of Mexican history within a
cultural context. A classic on understanding the culture of this country
is Distant Neighbors, by Alan Riding (Vintage).
Maya Art and Architecture, by Mary Ellen Miller (Thames & Hudson),

Movies
Mexico has served as a backdrop for countless movies. Here are just a
few of our favorites, all available on DVD.
The 2003 blockbuster Frida starring Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina is
not only an entertaining way to learn about two of Mexico’s most famous
personalities, but also of its history. The exquisite cinematography per-
fectly captures Mexico’s inherent spirit of Magic Realism.
Que Viva México is a little-known masterpiece by Russian filmmaker
Sergei Eisenstein, who created a documentary of Mexican history, poli-
tics, and culture, out of a series of short novellas, which ultimately tie
together. Although Eisenstein’s budget ran out before he could complete
the project, in 1979 this film was completed by Grigory Alexandrov, the
film’s original producer. It’s an absolute must for anyone interested in
Mexico or Mexican cinema.
Like Water for Chocolate is the 1993 film based on the book of the
same name by Laura Esquivel, filmed by the author’s husband,
acclaimed contemporary Mexican director Alfonso Arau. Expect to be
very hungry after watching this lushly visual film, which tells the story
of a young woman who suppresses her passions under the watchful eye
of a stern mother, and channels them into her cooking. In the process,
we learn of the traditional norms of Mexican culture, and a great deal of
the country’s culinary treasures.

Choosing Where to Go in
Mexico’s Beach Resorts
In This Chapter
 Introducing Mexico’s beach resorts
 Deciding which area to visit
 Examining the pros and cons of each destination
M
exico has a lot going for it in terms of attracting travelers: warm
weather, miles and miles of coastline, and a location so close to the
United States that sometimes it almost seems like a part of it. Although
the official language is Spanish, the use of English is almost as common as
Spanish in resort areas. A visit to Mexico can offer the experience of visit-
ing a foreign country accompanied by many of the familiarities of home.
Mexico’s beaches are generally spectacular. But they’re also as varied as
the country itself. Deciding which one is right for you depends a lot on
what you’re looking for in a vacation. As you read this chapter, think
about what you really want in a destination. Romance? Family fun?
Lively singles scene? And consider how you want to travel. Budget?
Luxury? Somewhere in between? These considerations can help narrow
down your planning. One thing’s for certain — no matter what you’re
seeking, you can find at least one Mexican beach resort that fits the bill.
Because of Mexico’s sheer size, covering more than one of its beach
resorts in a single trip isn’t practical, with the exception of the Riviera
Maya, found south of Cancún. In this chapter, we help you decide which
resort best matches your wish list. Although Mexico has many more
beaches than you could possibly dream of exploring in one trip, in this
book, we only include those with the easiest air access and the best
services and facilities for tourism.
If you don’t know where to begin in choosing between Acapulco and
Cancún, or Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta, don’t worry. In this book, we
tell you what you need to know to help you decide which destination is
right for you. In this chapter, we give you a rundown of the highlights and
drawbacks of each of Mexico’s most popular beach resorts. Because the
type of accommodations you want may determine where you go — or

don’t go — we also explain the different lodging options available at each
destination.
Understanding the Lay of the Land
Mexico is a country known for both its geographical and cultural diver-
sity. And, as a country with more than 13,000km (8,000 miles) of shore-
line, you can choose between a quiet stretch of sand, a pounding surf
break, or a dynamic beach resort with nonstop nightlife.
Mexico’s beach resorts are located in one of three main regions of the
country: the Caribbean coast, along the eastern seaboard; the Pacific
coastline; or on Mexico’s Baja Peninsula, an extension of California that
is almost completely separated from mainland Mexico.
The eastern destinations are known for their crystalline waters, which
border the coral reefs of the Caribbean, and flat, scrubby landscapes.
This area was the land of the ancient Maya, and their impressive remains
are close enough to the popular beach destinations to explore. The
Pacific beach resorts tend to have mountainous backdrops and dramatic
tropical jungles bordering cobalt blue waters. Baja’s beach resorts com-
bine a stunning desert landscape with oceans teeming with sea life.
Picking the Right Beach Resort
Although Acapulco was Mexico’s first beach to attract international trav-
elers, the white-sand beaches and nearby ruins have made Cancún the
most popular choice in recent years. When hurricane Wilma hit Cancún
in October 2005, travelers opened their minds to exploring other parts of
Mexico, and the Pacific coast resorts experienced a surge in popularity,
while Cancún recovered. Puerto Vallarta and Huatulco offer a strong dose
of natural charm and ecotourism, and Los Cabos has become Mexico’s
mecca for golfers and fishermen. Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, Cozumel, and
Puerto Escondido offer a laid-back retreat beneath palm fronds and
sunny skies, and the rapidly growing Riviera Maya region draws adven-
turers and relaxation-seekers alike. In a nutshell, each resort has its own
look, character, and special something. The following sections are snap-
shots to help you focus on the resort that’s right for you.
Also see “Mexico’s Beach Resorts: The Scorecard,” at the end of this
chapter, for a concise rating of each aspect of the resort areas that we
cover in this book. After you decide which amenities are the highest pri-
orities, you can use the table to find the resort that most meets your
particular wishes.
Choosing Cancún
Despite the severe hit it took from hurricane Wilma in October 2005,
Cancún is Mexico’s most popular beach resort, and the reason most
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
36

people travel to Mexico. It perfectly showcases both the country’s
breathtaking natural beauty and the depth of its 1,000-year-old history.
Cancún is also especially comforting for first-time visitors to Mexico
because it offers a taste of life back home that makes foreigners feel
instantly at ease in this beach resort.
Cancún offers an unrivaled combination of high-quality accommoda-
tions, dreamy beaches, and diverse shopping, dining, and nightlife.
While the hurricane washed away the white sands in the resort’s north-
ern hotel zone, it broadened the beaches in the isle’s southern region.
An ambitious restoration program should pump enough sand back to
the northern shores to restore its original beauty by late 2006.
The added lure of ancient culture is also evident in all directions. And
the best part? Cancún is also a modern mega-resort. Even if you’re a bit
apprehensive about visiting foreign soil, you’ll feel completely at home
and at ease in Cancún. Many people speak English, vendors and stores
accept dollars, the roads are well paved, and most lawns are manicured.
Malls are the places for shopping and dining, and you quickly spot rec-
ognizable names for dining, shopping, nightclubbing, and sleeping.
Two principal parts comprise Cancún: Isla Cancún (Cancún Island),
with a 23km-long (14-mile) strip of beachfront hotels reminiscent of
Miami Beach, and Ciudad Cancún (Cancún City), on the mainland, with
hotels to accompany the functional elements of any community.
Cancún, located on the Yucatán Peninsula, is also the departure point
for wonderful day trips to the nearby islands of Cozumel and Isla
Mujeres (Island of Women), where you can enjoy first-class diving, as
well as the remains of ancient cultures.
If you’re looking for an incredible introduction to Mexico’s beaches and
a Mexican-lite vacation while enjoying world-class shopping in a pam-
pered environment, Cancún is your beach. (Check out the chapters in
Part III for more detailed information on this resort.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Cancún include
 Great beaches of powdery, white sand and turquoise-blue water
 First-class facilities, modern accommodations, and tons of shop-
ping and dining options
 Numerous outdoor activities including jungle tours, visits to Mayan
ruins, and eco-oriented theme parks
 No need to worry about communication at this English
language–friendly destination
But also consider the following:
 Cancún is so visitor-friendly that you may forget you’re in Mexico
and miss the Mexican experience altogether.
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go in Mexico’s Beach Resorts 37

 Built for tourism, the prices in Cancún are higher than in most
other Mexican beach resorts.
 The impact of Hurricane Wilma affected many hotels and attrac-
tions, so be sure to check on the status of openings prior to travel-
ing through early 2007 to be sure your expectations for attractions
and services will be met.
Diving into Cozumel
If underwater beauty is your most important criterion for choosing a
beach, then Cozumel is a perfect pick. Considered by many to be one of
the world’s top-ten diving spots, few places can top the aquatic life 
of the waters surrounding this island. Hurricane Wilma hit Cozumel
directly in October 2005, and among the damage done was breakage of
the island’s coral reefs. Still, there remains enough sub-sea beauty to
dazzle you, but it will take several years to restore the aquatic environ-
ment to its previous splendor.
And when you come up for air, or if you’re a nondiver, Cozumel has sev-
eral inland attractions, a variety of watersports, a new golf course, and
ample choices for dining and libations. As Mexico’s most important port
of call for cruise ships, Cozumel also has the best duty-free shopping
and one of the largest selections of fine jewelry shops in the country.
The island’s one town, San Miguel, has a charming old-Mexico feel to it.
Cozumel has more budget-friendly accommodations and places to dine
than newer, nearby Cancún. However, even though the island is really
active during the day, it’s generally a quiet place at night.
Just a 45-minute ferry ride away from mainland Mexico, Cozumel makes
for a great jumping-off point for explorations along the Yucatán’s coast-
line. Just across the channel from Cozumel is captivating Playa del
Carmen, quickly growing in popularity due to its central location and
funky-sophisticated charms.
In addition to being a diver’s dream destination, staying in Cozumel can
be like enjoying multiple beach resorts in one vacation! (Take a look at
Chapter 14 for more on Cozumel.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Cozumel include
 World-class diving
 Secluded beaches to get away from it all
 Relaxed island atmosphere
 A short ferry trip away from the mainland’s cultural and historical
attractions
But also consider the following:
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
38

 The nightlife is almost nonexistent.
 Cozumel is super-casual; you won’t find a dress-up place on the
island.
 Stores tend to be more expensive than elsewhere because they
cater to cruise-ship visitors.
 When the cruise ships arrive, Cozumel is very crowded.
Exploring the Riviera Maya
Cancún’s popularity has given rise to a growing curiosity and desire to
explore other parts of the pristine coastline to the south. New venues
started popping up along the shoreline heading south to Tulum. Now
officially dubbed the Riviera Maya, this stretch of peaceful places to stay
is ideal for either more adventurous travelers or those who simply want
to stay put in an all-inclusive enclave.
The hottest spot along the Riviera Maya is Playa del Carmen, which lies
more than 64km (40 miles) south of Cancún. Playa — as locals refer to 
it — is a small town that’s both funky and sophisticated. In the early
’80s, Playa del Carmen was nothing more than the ferry landing for
Cozumel, but it has since developed into an engaging resort town of its
own merit, with powdery-sand beaches and an eclectic collection of
lodging, dining, and shopping.
Playa seems to attract younger visitors who are looking for a combina-
tion of simplicity and variety. Recently, though, Playa has also attracted
developers. As they rapidly change the beachscape to the north and
south with the addition of mega-resorts, they’re also changing Playa’s
previously playful vibe. But Playa still has enough of its original flavor to
make it different from any other resort in the area.
South of Playa del Carmen lie a succession of commercial nature parks,
planned resort communities, and a few rustic beach hideaways includ-
ing Xcaret, Puerto Aventuras, Xpu-Ha, Akumal, Xel-Ha, and Tulum. This
stretch of coast is also sprinkled with newly developed, all-inclusive
resorts, and is seeing the most dynamic growth in tourism development
in all Mexico.
If you love getting away from it all, the Riviera Maya is a natural choice
for exploration and relaxation. (See Chapter 15 for more details.)
Top aspects of a vacation in the Riviera Maya include
 Beautiful beaches and an array of eco-parks ideal for nature lovers
 Favored by more adventurous travelers, some of whom have settled
here to offer eclectic accommodations, shopping, and dining options
 Smaller crowds and lower prices
 All-inclusive haven with great savings if traveling with children 
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go in Mexico’s Beach Resorts 39

But also consider the following:
 Limited shopping and dining exist outside of Playa del Carmen.
 Nightlife? What nightlife? Unless you consider stargazing an aspect
of nightlife.
 Without a rental car, you’re stuck where you stay.
Playing in Puerto Vallarta
Puerto Vallarta is the place to go if you’re looking to experience a beach
resort with authentic Mexican flavor. Unlike other resorts, such as Cancún,
Ixtapa, and Huatulco, Puerto Vallarta grew up around an original beach
community. To this day, it has a seductively simple pace of life that’s
reflected in the warmth of its people and the spirit of the place itself.
Puerto Vallarta, with its traditional Mexican architecture and gold-sand
beaches bordered by jungle-covered mountains, is currently the second
most visited resort in Mexico (trailing only Cancún). Vallarta, as locals
prefer to call it, maintains its small-town charm despite being home to
sophisticated hotels, great restaurants, a thriving arts community, an
active nightlife, and a growing variety of ecotourism attractions that
range from mountain biking in the Sierra foothills to whale-watching.
Natural beauty and modern infrastructure aside, Puerto Vallarta is remark-
able for the number of options it offers for different types of tourists.
Whether you’re a couple looking for a romantic getaway, a family trying to
find a great value, or senior travelers in search of new shores to explore,
Vallarta has something to fit everyone. This resort is also known for being
very gay-friendly, and it has a selection of hotels, excursions, and nightlife
options that cater specifically to same-sex couples.
If you’re an avid golfer with family members who don’t share your pas-
sion for the links, you can take advantage of the six championship-
quality courses that are now available for play, making Vallarta an up-
and-coming golf resort. And the resort provides ample activities for the
non-golfers in your group.
With an ideal mix of modern services and traditional charms, Puerto
Vallarta is both a great first-time introduction to Mexico and a wonderful
place for those looking to explore more of this country’s natural and cul-
tural riches. (Look at the chapters in Part V for more on this area.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Puerto Vallarta include
 Considered Mexico’s friendliest beach resort
 An authentic sense of community
 Ideal combination of natural beauty and modern infrastructure
 An epicurean’s delight with more than 250 restaurants, as well as
varied nightlife and great shopping
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
40

 Wide variety of lodging options to fit all tastes and pocketbooks
 Countless activities, including mountain biking, hiking, bird-
watching, jungle trekking in ATVs, diving, snorkeling, ocean 
kayaking, and surfing
 Excellent and uncrowded golf courses 
But also consider the following:
 The beaches, at least those in central Puerto Vallarta, aren’t the
best in Mexico. They feature a golden sand that’s darker than most.
However, the northern and southern shores offer exquisite options,
and they’re only a short distance away.
 The presence of numerous beach vendors and timeshare salespeo-
ple means that you’ll have plenty of practice saying, “No, gracias!”
 The town is jam-packed during the major Mexican holidays —
Easter, September 16, November 20, and Christmas — which means
higher prices, fewer lodging opportunities, and tangled traffic.
Introducing Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
If you can’t decide between a modern beach resort and a typical Mexican
seaside village, then consider Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, located north 
of Acapulco on Mexico’s Pacific coast. These side-by-side destinations
offer the best of both worlds less than 7km (4 miles) from one another.
Although they share common geography, they couldn’t be more different
in character. Ixtapa is a model of modern infrastructure, services, and
luxury hotels, while Zihuatanejo — or Zihua, to the locals — is the quin-
tessential Mexican beach village.
If you favor luxury over charm, opt for Ixtapa and take advantage of 
the well-appointed rooms in this pristine setting of great natural beauty.
You can easily and quickly make the 7km (4-mile) trip into Zihuatanejo
for a sampling of the simple life in this seaside pueblo (small town).
However, if you prefer a more rustic retreat with real personality, settle
in Zihuatanejo.
Although this dual destination is a good choice for the traveler looking
for a little of everything, from resort-style indulgence to unpretentious
simplicity, keep in mind that these two resorts are more welcoming to
couples and adults than families with small children. A number of places
are off-limits to children under the age of 16 — something of a rarity in
Mexico.
Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo offer active days and relaxed evenings. During
the day, you can choose between scuba diving, deep-sea fishing, bay
cruises to remote beaches, and golfing. The nightlife in both towns bor-
ders on the subdued, but Ixtapa is the livelier of the two. The favored
evening activity here tends to be a late dinner on the beach.
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go in Mexico’s Beach Resorts 41

Enjoy a sense of two-for-one in this dual destination that’s truly an opti-
mal combo of the best of Mexican beach resorts. (See the chapters in
Part VI for more on these two destinations.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Zihuatanejo include
 Beautiful beaches within a bay that ensures calm waters with
ample stretches of sand for sun worshipers
 Traditional Mexican beach-town atmosphere
 Smaller, more unique accommodations in a variety of price ranges
 A casual, relaxed atmosphere
 One of the best-priced destinations in Mexico 
But also consider the following:
 The nightlife is very quiet.
 Going to the beach sums up the daytime activity; however, you can
take short trips to find horseback riding, bird-watching, and other,
more active endeavors.
 It’s among the least kid-friendly destinations in Mexico.
 The summers are extremely hot, and air-conditioning isn’t prevalent.
Top aspects of a vacation in Ixtapa include
 Modern infrastructure and expansive beaches
 Larger chain hotels and nicely appointed accommodations
 Two good golf courses with some of the lowest greens fees in
Mexico
 Enough variety in the nightlife, especially fun for the 20- and 
30-year-old crowd
But also consider the following:
 It lacks the true “feeling” of being in Mexico.
 Mexican tourists can make the Easter and Christmas holidays
crowded.
 Summers are very hot.
Getting acquainted with Acapulco
Acapulco is known for its sultry beaches for tanning during the day and
its glitzy discos for partying at night. To this day, Acapulco has a non-
stop, 24-hour-a-day energy, which clearly demonstrates why it was the
largest and most renowned Mexican resort from the 1940s to the 1970s,
when movie stars made it their playground. Although golf and tennis are
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
42

played here with intensity, the real participant sport is the nightlife,
which has made this city famous for decades.
Despite the seemingly decadent, nocturnal attractions, Acapulco is also
a charmingly ideal place for a fun-filled family vacation. Many activities
and destinations cater to children, including water parks, zoos, and
exciting tours down a nearby river. Accommodations fit every budget,
and, in the true spirit of Mexican family hospitality, children are wel-
come almost everywhere in town.
In addition to the broadest range of late-night entertainment in Mexico,
this beach resort also has excellent airline connections, outstanding
dining, and a wide array of daytime activities. You can stay at luxurious
hillside villas, resort hotels, or modest inns on the beach and in the old
center of Acapulco. It’s got something for everyone.
Although the view of the bay is stunning, the bay’s cleanliness is still
somewhat in question, despite valiant efforts by city officials. The
water’s cleanliness is an important consideration if your ideal beach get-
away includes tons of time in the ocean. If you plan on spending your
afternoons in the sea, you may want to choose a different resort or, at
least, a place located south of town in one of the areas fronting the
Pacific Ocean rather than Acapulco Bay.
Acapulco is for you if you want to dine at midnight, dance until dawn,
and sleep all day on a sun-soaked beach. (For more information, check
out the chapters in Part VII.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Acapulco include
 Nightlife so hot it rivals the sunshine
 Unforgettable views of the breathtakingly beautiful bay
 An average of 360 days of sunshine per year
 Wide variety of lodging options
 Excellent air-travel connections
But also consider the following:
 The cleanliness of the bay remains questionable.
 The most popular resort with residents of Mexico City, it tends to
fill up with city dwellers on weekends and major holidays.
 Acapulco has a somewhat outdated feel to it, and as a big city, it
can seem less clean than other Mexican beach resorts.
Hanging out in Huatulco
The resort found farthest south along Mexico’s Pacific coastline,
Huatulco is the perfect place for those travelers who want to enjoy pris-
tine beaches and jungle landscapes but would rather view them from a
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go in Mexico’s Beach Resorts 43

luxury-hotel balcony. If you want to enjoy nature’s beauty during the day
and then retreat to well-appointed comfort by night, Huatulco is for you.
The area offers undeveloped stretches of pure, white sands. Isolated
coves lie in wait for the promised growth of Huatulco, which luckily, isn’t
occurring as rapidly as Cancún’s expansion. Huatulco is a FONATUR
development project that aims to cover 20,800 hectares (52,000 acres) 
of land. Of that area, more than 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) are to
remain as ecological preserves. (FONATUR is a government agency that
develops strategic plans and assists in arranging financing for tourism
development projects. It’s the agency responsible for the site selection
and planning of Cancún; Ixtapa and Los Cabos are other FONATUR 
destinations.)
Huatulco has developed a name because of its ecotourism attractions:
river rafting, rappelling, and jungle hiking, to name a few. However, the
shopping, the nightlife, and even the dining options outside the hotels
are scarce, and what is available is high priced for the quality.
If you’re especially drawn to snorkeling, diving, boat cruises to virgin
bays, and simple relaxation, Huatulco fits the bill. (See Chapter 28 for
more information.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Huatulco include
 Magnificent, unspoiled beaches where you can get away from it all
 Beautifully appointed accommodations
 Slow-paced, small-town atmosphere with modern infrastructure
 Plenty of eco-oriented activities such as river rafting, rappelling,
and jungle hiking
 Water-lovers paradise with plenty of snorkeling, diving, and boating
 Superb service and friendliness from the locals 
But also consider the following:
 The nightlife is almost nonexistent.
 The dining and shopping options are limited.
 Reaching Huatulco is more difficult than many resorts, and a lim-
ited number of direct flights service the area.
 It’s slightly more expensive than other beach resorts in Mexico.
Kicking back in Puerto Escondido
Puerto Escondido — usually referred to as Puerto — is known for its
great surf, breathtaking beaches, friendly locals, and inexpensive prices.
Located just north along the Pacific coastline from Huatulco, Puerto
Escondido is another “real” place — not a planned development — which
Part I: Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
44

gives it a unique and authentic character. And it almost seems as though
the locals would rather keep the place small.
In addition to its legendary surf break, Puerto is increasingly gaining a
reputation with travelers seeking both spiritual and physical renewal.
Abundant massage and body-work services, yoga classes, and excep-
tional and varied vegetarian dining options — not to mention seaside
tranquillity — are hallmarks of this resort. We consider it the single best
beach value in all Mexico.
European travelers make up a significant number of the visitors, and
hearing a variety of languages on the beach and in the bars is common.
Puerto is also a place that younger travelers favor — and one of the few
resorts that offers welcoming options for the backpack- and hammock-
type of traveler.
Puerto is definitely the place for surf lovers, but it’s also great for those
who are looking for a funky, relaxed beach attitude infused with a cos-
mopolitan appreciation for espresso drinks and world music. (See
Chapter 29 for details on Puerto Escondido.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Puerto Escondido include
 The best surfing beaches in Mexico
 The best overall value
 Vibrant nightlife with plenty of live music
 Simple atmosphere with no pretensions of being a grand place
 Plenty of healthful and healing-oriented services 
But also consider the following:
 Accommodations are generally in independent inns that feature
fewer services.
 Puerto Escondido isn’t a resort that caters to children. That aspect,
combined with a concern about the powerful ocean surf, makes
this a destination that we don’t recommend for family travelers.
 Challenging air access is the rule. It usually involves complicated
connections through Mexico City and/or Oaxaca, which makes
travel time lengthy.
Lazing in Los Cabos
What was once considered an offbeat outpost for only the most rugged
of sportsmen and vagrants has somehow evolved into Mexico’s most
posh beach resort. Los Cabos, located on the Baja Peninsula just south
of California, actually refers to three areas: the quaint town of San José
del Cabo, the high-energy tourist enclave of Cabo San Lucas, and the
29km-long (18-mile) stretch of highway connecting the two, known as
the Corridor, which is lined with luxury resorts.
Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Go in Mexico’s Beach Resorts 45

Each town has its own distinct personality: San José is a gentrified ver-
sion of a small Mexican town, and Cabo San Lucas is a party place that
attracts the most visitors. Alternately known as “the end of the line” and
“the last resort,” Cabo San Lucas boasts a let-loose nightlife that fre-
quently goes until breakfast the next morning. Cabo San Lucas, in partic-
ular, is so American-friendly that you may find you rarely get the chance
to practice your Spanish, and dollars are accepted as readily as pesos. In
fact, many visitors find that it feels more like an extension of Southern
California than Mexico.
Although sportfishing originally took credit for putting Los Cabos on the
map, golf is now the stronger attraction. The Corridor that connects the
two “Cabos” has an impressive collection of championship golf courses
interspersed at respectable distances among the gorgeous resorts dot-
ting the coastline. Accommodations in the two bookend towns range
from smaller inns to larger chain hotels.
The beaches are breathtaking — cobalt-blue ocean meeting terra-cotta
desertscapes speckled with cacti. Surfing is challenging here, and the
numerous inlets seem custom-made for sea kayaking. Favored land-
bound activities beyond golf include ATV tours and horseback riding.
In terms of everything from taxis to dining out, Los Cabos is much more
expensive than other Mexican beach resorts. One contributing factor is
its remote location; other than the abundant seafood caught offshore,
almost everything else needs to be trucked down the long peninsula.
(The chapters in Part IX go into detail about Los Cabos.)
Top aspects of a vacation in Los Cabos include
 The sheer beauty of the combination of desert and seascapes
 Outstanding sporting opportunities, from the legendary sportfish-
ing to premier golf, plus exceptional spas to take out the kinks
 No need to worry about speaking Spanish at this English 
language–and U.S. dollar–friendly destination
But also consider the following:
 It’s indisputably Mexico’s most expensive beach resort.
 If you plan on doing any exploring, you may need to consider 
renting a car because the distance from one “Cabo” to another is
significant.
 You may feel more like you’re in Southern California than Mexico;
Los Cabos has become very Americanized.
 Despite the level of sophistication of the hotels (especially along
the Corridor), the region’s dining and nightlife options are lacking,
and they’re likely to appeal to a college-age crowd at best.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Understanding Mexico’s weather
 Knowing the high and low travel seasons
 Planning your trip around festivals and special events
M
exico’s beach resorts enjoy sun-drenched and moderate winters,
and they logically attract the most visitors when the weather at
home is cold and dreary. However, almost any time of the year has its
pros and cons for travel. In this chapter, we review what you can expect
from the weather during different months of the year. We also highlight
some of Mexico’s most festive celebrations that you may want to plan
your trip around.
Forecasting the Weather
Mexico has two main climatic seasons: a rainy season (May to mid-Oct)
and a dry season (mid-Oct to Apr). The rainy season can be of little con-
sequence in the country’s dry, northern region, but the southern regions
typically receive tropical showers, which begin around 4 or 5 p.m. and
last a few hours. Though these rains can come on suddenly and be quite
strong, they usually end just as quickly as they begin, and they cool the
air for the evening. We favor the rainy season because that’s when the
landscape is at its most lush and tropical flowers are everywhere. The
lightning flashes offshore also make for a spectacular show.
Hurricane season — June through October — particularly affects the
Yucatán Peninsula and the southern Pacific coast.
June, July, and August are very hot and humid on the Yucatán Peninsula,
with temperatures rising into the mid-80s and 90s Fahrenheit (low 30s
Celsius). Most of coastal Mexico experiences temperatures in the 80s in
the hottest months. Very high summer temperatures are reserved for
Mexico’s northern states that border the United States. During winter
months, temperatures average 70°F to 75°F (21°C–24°C) during the day
and about 55°F to 65°F (13°C–18°C) in the evening, in most of the resorts
in this book. Los Cabos is often cooler (50°F/10°C) during winter-month
evenings.

Considering Mexico’s Travel Seasons
Mexico has two principal travel seasons: high and low. The high season
begins around December 20 and continues to Easter, although in some
places the high season can begin as early as mid-November. The low
season begins the day after Easter and continues to mid-December;
during the low season, prices may drop between 20 percent and 50 per-
cent. At beach destinations popular with Mexican travelers, such as
Acapulco, the prices revert back to high-season levels during July and
August, the traditional, national summer vacation period. Prices at
inland cities seldom fluctuate from high to low season, but they may rise
dramatically during the weeks of Easter and Christmas. In Isla Mujeres
and Playa del Carmen, both on the Yucatán coast, the high season starts
in mid-November as well, but they also have a “second” high season, in
August, when many European visitors arrive. We mention all these
exceptions in the relevant chapters that follow.
We find November to be the best month to travel to Mexico. The
scenery is still green from the recently ended rainy season, and tempera-
tures are just beginning to turn a bit cooler, which can produce crystal-
clear skies. This is especially true in Los Cabos, when even the desert is
in bloom. Crowds are also at a minimum, and you’re likely to find some
good deals.
One time you may want to avoid is spring break. You find the highest
concentration of high-octane party crowds in Cancún, but Puerto Vallarta
also gets its fair share of craziness. Frankly, why travel to see American
youth behaving badly? Other times you may want to avoid are the weeks
of Christmas and Easter. During these traditional Mexican holiday peri-
ods, both crowds and prices are at their highest, but the crowds consist
more of families and couples than young and rowdy revelers.
Mexico’s Calendar of Events
Mexicans are known for throwing a great party — ¡fiesta! — and their love
of fireworks is legendary. You may choose to plan your visit around a 
colorful national or religious celebration. Watersports enthusiasts may
consider visiting during one of the numerous regattas and sportfishing
festivals held at many of the resorts. Remember that during national holi-
days, Mexican banks and government offices — including immigration —
are closed.
Mexicans celebrate Christmas and Easter similarly to the way they’re
celebrated in the United States, but Christmas is much more religiously
oriented, and they place less emphasis on Santa and gift exchanges.

Día de Reyes (Three Kings Day) commemorates the three kings bring-
ing gifts to the Christ child. On this day, children receive gifts, much 
like the traditional exchange of gifts that accompanies Christmas in the
United States. Friends and families gather to share the Rosca de Reyes, a
special cake. A small doll representing the Christ child is placed within
the cake; whoever receives the doll in his or her piece must host a
tamales-and-atole (meat or sweet filling wrapped in a corn husk and a
hot drink) party the next month. January 6.
Music, dances, processions, food, and other festivities are features of
Día de la Candelaria (Candlemas) and lead up to a blessing of seed and
candles in a celebration that mixes pre-Hispanic and European traditions
marking the end of winter. All those who attended the Día de Reyes cele-
bration reunite to share atole and tamales at a party hosted by the recip-
ient of the doll found in the rosca. February 2.
Día de la Constitución (Constitution Day) is a celebration in honor of
the current Mexican constitution that was signed in 1917 following the
Mexican Revolution of 1910. If you’re in Mexico on this day, you find a
parade wherever you are. February 5.
Carnaval (Carnival) is the last celebration before Lent, and it’s cele-
brated with special gusto in Cozumel and in Mazatlán, north of Puerto
Vallarta. Here, the celebration resembles New Orleans’s Mardi Gras 
with a festive atmosphere and parades. Transportation and hotels are
packed, so try to make reservations six months in advance and arrive a
couple of days before the beginning of celebrations. Three days preced-
ing Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent.
Benito Juárez was a reformist leader and a Mexican president who
became a national hero. The national holiday honoring Benito Juárez’s
birthday is the same date as the spring equinox, an important celebra-
tion of the ancient Mexicans. In Chichén Itzá (chee-chehn eet-zah), the
ancient Maya city located 179km (112 miles) from Cancún, the celebra-
tion of the first day of spring is particularly impressive. The Temple of
Kukulcán — Chichén Itzá’s main pyramid — aligns with the sun, and 
the shadow of the body of its plumed serpent moves slowly from the top
of the building downward. When the shadow reaches the bottom, the
body joins the carved-stone snake’s head at the base of the pyramid.
According to ancient legend, at the moment that the serpent is whole,
the earth is fertilized to assure a bountiful growing season. Visitors
come from around the world to marvel at this sight, so advance arrange-
ments are advisable. Elsewhere, festivals and celebrations to welcome
spring mark the equinox. In the custom of the ancient Mexicans, people
perform dances and say prayers to the elements and the four cardinal
points (north, south, east, west) in order to renew their energy for the
upcoming year. Wearing white with a red ribbon is customary. March 21.
(You can see the serpent’s shadow at Chichén Itzá Mar 19–23.)

April/May/June
Semana Santa (Holy Week) celebrates the last week in the life of Christ
from Palm Sunday through Easter Sunday with somber religious proces-
sions, spoofs of Judas, and reenactments of specific biblical events, plus
food and craft fairs. Businesses close during this traditional week of
Mexican national vacations. If you plan on traveling to or around Mexico
during Holy Week, make your reservations early. Airline seats on flights
into and out of the country are reserved months in advance. Buses to
almost anywhere in Mexico are always full, so try arriving on the
Wednesday or Thursday prior to the start of Holy Week. Easter Sunday
is quiet. The week following is a vacation period. Week before Easter.
Labor Day is a national holiday celebrating workers. It features country-
wide parades and fiestas. May 1.
Cinco de Mayo is a national holiday that celebrates the defeat of the
French at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. May 5.
July/August/September
Mexico begins Día de Independencia (Independence Day) — the holi-
day that marks Mexico’s independence from Spain — at 11 p.m. on
September 15, with the president of Mexico’s famous independence grito
(shout) from the National Palace in Mexico City. The rest of the country
watches the event on TV or participates in local celebrations, which
mirror the festivities at the national level. September 16 is the actual
Independence Day and is celebrated with parades, picnics, and family
reunions throughout the country. September 15 and 16.
During the fall equinox, Chichén Itzá once again takes center stage as
the same serpent shadow play that occurs during the spring equinox
repeats itself for the fall equinox, representing the fall harvest.
September 21 and 22.
October/November/December
What’s commonly called the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is
actually two days: All Saints Day, honoring saints and deceased children,
and All Souls Day, honoring deceased adults. Relatives gather at ceme-
teries countrywide, carrying candles and food, and often spend the
night beside the graves of loved ones. Weeks before, bakers begin pro-
ducing bread formed in the shape of mummies and round loaves deco-
rated with bread “bones.” Decorated sugar skulls emblazoned with
glittery names are sold everywhere. Many days ahead, homes and
churches erect special altars laden with bread, fruit, flowers, candles,
photographs of saints and of the deceased, and favorite foods and pho-
tographs of the deceased. On these two nights, children walk through
the streets dressed in costumes and masks, often carrying mock coffins
and pumpkin lanterns, into which they expect money to be dropped.
November 1 and 2.
Chapter 4: Deciding When to Go 51

Día de Revolución (Revolution Day) is a national holiday commemorat-
ing the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 with parades, speeches,
rodeos, and patriotic events. November 20.
During the Día de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (Feast of the Virgin of
Guadalupe), people throughout the country honor Mexico’s patroness
with religious processions, street fairs, dancing, fireworks, and Masses. It’s
one of Mexico’s most moving and beautiful displays of traditional culture.
In December 1531, the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared to a young man, Juan
Diego, on a hill near Mexico City. He convinced the bishop that he had
seen the apparition by revealing his cloak, upon which the Virgin was
emblazoned. In Puerto Vallarta, the celebration begins on December 1 and
extends through December 12, with traditional processions to the church
for a brief Mass and blessing. In the final days, the processions and festivi-
ties take place around the clock. A major fireworks exhibition takes place
on December 12 at 11 p.m. December 1 to 12.
Christmas Posadas celebrates the Holy Family’s trek to Bethlehem. On
each of the nine nights before Christmas, people customarily reenact the
Holy Family’s search for an inn with door-to-door candlelit processions
in cities and villages nationwide. December 15 to 24.

R
eady to travel to Mexico? Well then, it’s probably time
to do a little planning. In the next ﬁve chapters, we help
you with the basics you need to consider when booking your
ideal trip to one of Mexico’s beach destinations. We give tips
and tricks for accurately planning your vacation budget.
Nothing can take away the pleasure of lazy days faster than
worries about spending too much money, so spend some
time here to ward away those stressful thoughts. We help you
decide whether to use a travel agent or to take care of the
arrangements on your own, cover the pros and cons of pack-
age deals, and point you in the direction of the best places to
ﬁnd the information you need to accurately plan and budget
your trip. We also offer some tips for travelers with special
needs in order to help ensure that you choose exactly the
right place that fulﬁlls both your personal requirements and
your expectations. Finally, we cover the nitty-gritty details —
from getting your passport to packing your bags — you need
to know so that you can enjoy a hassle-free vacation.

Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Figuring out the expenses of your trip
 Discovering budget-saving tips
 Understanding Mexican currency
 Dealing with a stolen wallet
T
he brochures are in front of you, and visions of lazy, sunny days fill
your thoughts — so who wants to think about money? Trust me —
take a few minutes to figure out your expected expenses now, so you can
enjoy a worry-free vacation later.
Your budget is greatly affected by your choice of beach resort. An all-
inclusive resort on the Riviera Maya costs more than a modest beach-
side hotel in Acapulco. Within Cancún itself, a room on the beach of Isla
Cancún is considerably more expensive than one in Cancún City (Ciudad
Cancún), and ditto for all the other expenses down the line. After you
decide where you want to go, and you have your hotel and airfare down,
it’s a good idea to calculate the other estimated costs associated with
your trip to plan a proper budget.
Most people save all year to be able to enjoy a wonderful vacation, so in
this chapter, we share with you the finer points of stretching your dol-
lars into pesos. We tell you about the nuances of changing currency to
get more for your money and present the pros and cons of traveler’s
checks, credit cards, and cash. Finally, we tell you how to regroup if your
wallet is lost or stolen.
Planning Your Budget
To make certain that you don’t forget any expenses, try taking a mental
stroll through your entire trip. Start with the costs of transportation
from your home to the airport, your airline tickets, and transfers to your
hotel. Add your daily hotel rate (don’t forget taxes!), meals, activities,
entertainment, taxis, tips, your return to the airport, and finally, your
return trip home from the airport and any parking fees you may have
incurred. Just to be safe, add an extra 15 percent to 20 percent for extra,
unexpected costs that may pop up.

You can use the notes page at the back of this book to jot down antici-
pated costs so that you can easily see whether you need to trim any of
your expenses. Or even better, you may discover that you can afford to
slip into that oceanfront room or plan that sunset sail you’ve been
dreaming of.
Calculating your hotel cost
The biggest part of your vacation budget will go toward your hotel and
airfare, so we suggest getting those expenses down to as low as possi-
ble. In the various destination chapters, we use dollar signs ($–$$$$$) to
indicate the price category of each hotel. (Check out Chapter 7 of this
book for a rundown on the price categories and their corresponding
dollar signs.) You can get a room for $30 a night, or you can get a room
for $700 a night!
Keep in mind that some room rates include breakfast — or all meals,
beverages, and entertainment — so be sure to compare mangoes with
mangoes. Also, when finalizing your reservations, be sure to check
whether the total cost includes taxes and tips. Even within a resort, the
price of rooms can vary widely.
Room location — oceanfront versus a view of a dumpster — is one dif-
ferential. Ask yourself how much your room location matters. Do you
view your room as simply a place to sleep, shower, and dress? Or will
you not feel officially “on vacation” unless you can fall asleep to the
sound of the surf? If so, a pricier room may well be worth it. However,
remember that many “gardenview” rooms in our recommendations are
only steps away from the beach and possibly even more tranquil than
their oceanfront counterparts.
Feeling romantic? Special packages for honeymooners are really popular
in Mexican beach resorts. Even if you’ve been hitched for a while, it
could be a second honeymoon, right? If you ask, you may end up with a
complimentary bottle of champagne and flower petals on your bed.
Mexico couldn’t be more accommodating to travelers with children.
Many of the larger chains don’t charge extra for children staying in the
same room as their parents, and some offer special meal programs and
other amenities for younger travelers. While rollaway beds are common,
you may have a challenge finding a crib. Ask about this contingency
when making your reservation.
Totaling transportation costs
After taking care of your airfare (for tips on keeping airfare costs down
see Chapter 6), your transportation costs vary depending upon your
choice of Mexican beach resorts. While some areas — like Cancún —
offer economical shuttles and great public transportation options,
others, such as in Los Cabos, are more expensive to get to and have
little in the way of local transportation once you’ve arrived at your
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
56

resort, making a rental car desirable if you’re the type of traveler who
likes to explore. These extra charges, however, can make getting around
cost even more than getting there.
One advantage of a package tour (when you make one payment that
covers airfare, hotel, round-trip transportation to and from your accom-
modations, and occasionally meals or tours) is that the round-trip
ground transportation between the airport and your hotel is usually
included. If you’re not sure whether your package covers ground trans-
portation, ask. Note that the taxi union inside Mexico is strong, so you’re
unlikely to find any shuttle transportation provided by your hotel.
Generally, renting a car doesn’t make sense, unless you’re planning to
explore on your own (the one exception for us is Los Cabos, due to 
the high taxi costs there). Renting a small car runs about $70 a day 
on average, including insurance, so you may want to squeeze your car-
dependent explorations into a day or two at the most. You should also
try to time your rental-car excursions to coincide with your arrival or
departure so that you can use your wheels for either leg of your airport-
hotel transportation needs.
As a rule, taxis tend to be the most economical and efficient transporta-
tion for getting around Mexico’s beach resorts. In each of the chapters
detailing these resorts, we provide taxi rates for getting around town.
Estimating dining dollars
In each resort’s dining section, we describe our favorite restaurants, all
of which include dollar signs ($–$$$$$) to give you an idea of the prices
you can expect to pay. Refer to the Introduction of this book for a
detailed explanation of these price categories.
The prices quoted refer to main courses at dinner, unless otherwise
specified. we eliminated the most expensive shrimp and lobster dishes
from our estimates to avoid pre-trip sticker shock. In most cases, you
can find additional entrees above and below the quoted price range. To
estimate your total dining expenses, add in estimated costs for bever-
ages, appetizers, desserts, and tips as well.
Hotels increasingly are offering dining plans. To help you wade through
the terminology, here’s a review of the basics:
 Continental plan (CP): Includes a light breakfast — usually juices,
fruits, pastries or breads, and coffee.
 Breakfast plan (BP): Includes a full, traditional American-style
breakfast of eggs, bacon, French toast, hash browns, and so on.
 Modified American plan (MAP): Includes breakfast (usually a full
one) and dinner.
 Full American plan (FAP): Includes three meals a day.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57

 All-inclusive: Includes three all-you-can-eat meals a day, plus
snacks, soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and entertainment, includ-
ing special theme parties. Sometimes, additional charges apply for
premium liquors or wines.
 European Plan (EP): No meals are included.
Mexican beach-resort hotels are known for their expansive breakfast
buffets. But the buffets can also be expensive, averaging about $20, even
for small children. If breakfast is your main meal or only meal of the day,
these all-you-can-eat extravaganzas may be worthwhile; otherwise,
you’re probably better off sleeping in or finding breakfast elsewhere.
Be sure to explore restaurants away from your hotel. You’re likely to get
a much better dining value, and you can truly savor the diverse flavors
of Mexico. For eateries that best represent the flavorful (and we don’t
mean spicy) cuisine of Mexico, look for the Viva Mexico icon that accom-
panies some of the restaurant reviews throughout this book.
While you’re in Mexico, be sure to try the local beers. Corona is the best-
known brew, but other excellent choices are Bohemia, Modelo Especial,
Pacífico, Indio, and Dos Equis Negro. Beer in Mexico is often cheaper
than soft drinks! Your vacation is looking better and better, isn’t it?
Tipping tips
Many travelers skimp on tips in Mexico, but please don’t. Most of the
employees in this country’s hospitality industry receive the majority of
their income from tips. For bellmen or porters, the equivalent of $1 per
bag is appropriate. For hotel housekeeping, tip between $1 and $2 per
night, depending upon the type of hotel you’re staying in. For restaurant
service, 15 percent is standard, but consider 20 percent if the service is
particularly noteworthy. Oddly enough, the one area you don’t need to
consider tips for is taxis — it’s not customary to tip taxi drivers here
unless they help with baggage, or you’ve hired them on an hourly basis
and they double as a tour guide.
You’ll no doubt run into all sorts of enterprising young boys looking for
a tip to point you in the direction of your restaurant, help you into a
parking spot, or do some other sort of unnecessary favor. In cases like
these, tip as you see fit, or as the spirit moves you.
Sightseeing
You’re going to a beach resort, so regardless of your budget, you always
have the option of simply soaking up the tropical sun during the day and
then taking in the moonlit nights. It’s the most economical plan and a
relaxing and enjoyable option for many. Still, with so much to do and
see, you’re likely to want to spend some time and money getting out and
enjoying the many treasures of Mexico.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
58

Pricing for sightseeing tours varies by the destination, the length of time
of the excursion, whether a meal and beverages are included, and other
extras. However, we can give you some pretty typical ranges that you
can use as a guideline. A city tour generally runs from $12 to $20; half-
day boat cruises that include lunch can cost between $40 and $60; and
full-day excursions to neighboring ruins run between $60 and $150.
If you plan to take part in any sports-related activities like golf, diving,
or sportfishing, you may find the prices to be higher than back home.
Dives range from around $50 to $70 for a two-tank dive, but here, you
tend to really get what you pay for in terms of quality of equipment and
dive guides, so it’s best to pay up. Cozumel has the greatest selection 
of expert dive shops, and the competition makes Cozumel’s prices the
most reasonable for the quality of experience. Going fishing? You have to
decide variables beyond your point of departure, including size of boat,
charter options, and type of gear and refreshments, but count on
between $50 and $75 per person for a half-day charter.
Shopping
If shopping is your call, you can plan to spend or save here. Besides
silver jewelry and other souvenirs, the best excuse for shopping in
Mexico are the great prices on duty-free perfumes, watches, and other
goods in Cancún and in Los Cabos. We discuss shopping specialties in
greater detail within the respective destination chapters.
Nightlife
As for nightlife, the cost depends more on your personal tastes. The
“hot” nightlife spots among Mexico’s beach resorts include Cancún,
Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, and Los Cabos, so if that’s important to you,
these are “the” spots in Mexico for you. When you’re out on the town,
beer is the best bargain and costs about $1 to $3 per beer. National-
branded drinks can run you around $3 to $5 each. Ladies can easily find
bargains like “two-for-one” or “all-you-can-drink” specials.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
While planning your trip, you need to keep in mind certain things that
may help you save some money. Before you leave for vacation, don’t
forget to consider the incidentals that can really add up — hotel taxes,
tips, and telephone surcharges.
Here are a few other suggestions to help keep a lid on expenses so that
they don’t run amuck and blow your vacation budget:
 Travel in the off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times
(Sept–Nov, for example), you can usually find better hotel bargains.
 Travel on off days of the week. If you can travel on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your 
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 59

destination. When you inquire about airfares, ask whether flying on
a different day is cheaper.
 Try a package tour. With one call to a travel agent or packager, 
you can book airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some
sightseeing for many of these destinations for a lot less than if you
tried to put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 6 for specific
suggestions of package tour companies to contact.)
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for a discount on
plane tickets and hotel rooms if you book them in the United
States. In Mexico, you can generally get a discount based on how
full the hotel is at the time you show up; however, you’re also
taking a chance on a vacancy not being available.
 Get a room off the beach. Accommodations within walking dis-
tance of the shore can be much cheaper than those that are right
on the beach. Beaches in Mexico are public, so you don’t need to
stay in a hotel that’s on the sand to spend most of your vacation at
the beach.
 Share your room with your kids. In Mexico, this setup is usually
the norm rather than the exception, so book a room with two
double beds. Most hotels won’t charge extra for up to two children
staying in their parents’ room.
 Use public transportation whenever practical. Not only will you
save taxi fare, but simply getting to where you’re going can be like 
a mini-excursion as you enjoy the local scene. For example, in
Cancún, you’re apt to run into mostly tourists on the clean, public
buses of the hotel zone.
 Cut down on the souvenirs. We don’t expect you to return home
without any local treasures, but think hard about whether that
oversized sombrero will be as charming back home. Your photo-
graphs and memories are likely to be your best mementos.
 Use public phones and prepaid phone cards to call home. Avoid
using the phone in your hotel room to call outside the hotel. Charges
can be astronomical, even for local calls. Rather than placing the
call yourself, ask the concierge to make a reservation for you —
they do it as a service.
You’ll even be charged a surcharge for using your own calling card
and its 800 number. Remember: Most 800 numbers are not toll-free
when dialed from Mexico.
Also avoid using the public phones that urge you, in English, to 
call home using their 800 number. This ploy is the absolute most
expensive way to call home, and the service charges the call to
your home phone. The best option? Buy a Ladatel (brand name for
Mexico’s public phones) phone card, available at most pharmacies,
and dial direct using the instructions in Appendix A of this book.

60

 Drink local. Imported labels can be twice the price of the locally
popular brands, which often are also imported but just different
brands from the ones you may be accustomed to seeing. At least
ask what’s being served as the house brand — you may be pleas-
antly surprised.
 Follow Mexican custom and have lunch as your main meal. If the
restaurant of your dreams is open only for dinner, save that one for
your one “splurge” evening and try out the others for your midday
meal. Lunch tabs are usually a fraction of their dinner counter-
parts, and they frequently feature many of the same specialties.
 Skimp on shrimp and lobster. Sure, we know — you’re sitting 
seaside and dreaming of that tasty lobster. Just understand that
they’re the priciest items on the menu, and the less expensive,
local, fresh fish is often just as good or better.
 Buy Mexican bottled water. Forget the water labels that you 
know — Mexico’s bottled waters are just as good as the imports
and about half the price. Look for such brands as Santa María, Ciel,
and Bonafont.
Making Sense of the Peso
The currency in Mexico is the Mexican peso, and in recent years, econo-
mists have been talking about its amazing recovery and resiliency against
the U.S. dollar. At this book’s time of print, each peso is worth close to
11 U.S. cents, which means that an item costing 11 pesos would be equiv-
alent to US$1.20. Like most things in Mexico, the paper currency is color-
ful, and it comes in denominations of 20 (blue), 50 (pink), 100 (red), 200
(green), and 500 (burgundy) pesos. Coins come in denominations of 1, 2,
5, 10, and 20 pesos and 50 centavos (100 centavos equal 1 peso).
New 50- and 500-peso bills look very similar, but 50-peso bills have a
slightly pinkish hue and are smaller in size. However, always double-
check how much you’re paying and your change to avoid unpleasant
surprises. The same applies to 10- and 20-peso coins. Twenty-peso coins
are slightly larger than the 10-peso coins, but they look very similar.
Getting change continues to be a problem in Mexico. Small-denomina-
tion bills and coins are hard to come by, so start collecting them early in
your trip and continue as you travel. Shopkeepers — and especially taxi
drivers — always seem to be out of change and small bills; that’s doubly
true in a market. In other words, don’t try to pay with a 500-peso bill
when buying a 20-peso trinket.
Before you leave your hotel, it’s a good idea to get a hundred pesos —
about US$9 — in change so that you’re sure to have change for cab and
bus fares.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 61

In this book, we use the universal currency sign ($) to indicate U.S. dol-
lars. When you’re in Mexico, you’ll notice the common use of the cur-
rency symbol ($), generally indicating the price in pesos. Go ahead and
ask if you’re not sure because some higher-end places do tend to price
their goods in U.S. dollars. Often, if a price is quoted in U.S. dollars, the
letters “USD” follow the price.
The rate of exchange fluctuates a tiny bit daily, so you’re probably better
off not exchanging too much currency at once. Don’t forget, however, to
have enough pesos to carry you over a weekend or Mexican holiday,
when banks are closed. In general, avoid carrying the U.S. $100 bill, the
bill most commonly counterfeited in Mexico, and therefore, the most dif-
ficult to exchange, especially in smaller towns. Because small bills and
coins in pesos are hard to come by in Mexico, the U.S. $1 bill is useful for
tipping. A tip of U.S. coins is of no value to the service provider because
they can’t be exchanged into Mexican currency.
To make your dollars go further, remember that ATMs offer the best
exchange rate; however, you need to consider any service fees. Mexican
banks offer the next-best fare, and they don’t charge commission, unless
you’re cashing traveler’s checks, in which case they usually charge a
small commission. After banks, casas de cambio (houses of exchange)
are your next best option, and they usually charge a commission. You
can almost always get a lower exchange rate when you exchange your
money at a hotel front desk.
Choosing Traveler’s Checks, 
Credit Cards, or Cash
You need to think about what kind of money you’re going to spend on
your vacation before you leave home.
ATMs and cash
These days, all the Mexico beach resorts detailed in this book have 
24-hour ATMs linked to a national network that almost always includes
your bank at home. Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com/
cardholderservices/atm) and Plus (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com/
atms) are the two most popular networks; check the back of your ATM
card to see which network your bank belongs to. The toll-free numbers
and Web sites will give you specific locations of ATMs where you can
withdraw money while on vacation. Using ATMs permits you to with-
draw only as much cash as you need for a few days, which eliminates
the insecurity (and the pickpocketing threat) of carrying around a wad
of cash. Note, however, that a daily maximum of about US$1,000 is
common, though this amount does depend on your particular bank and
type of account.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
62

As in many places worldwide, ATMs in Mexico are often targets for 
criminals looking to capture your bankcard information for fraudulent
card-copying purposes. To be on the safe side, only use bank-sponsored
ATMs, and even then, check the ATM carefully before using for any small
cameras or other recording devices that could be used to copy your card.
Shield the touchpad when entering your PIN for further protection
against fraud.
Credit cards
Credit cards are invaluable when traveling. They’re a safe way to carry
“money,” and they provide a convenient record of all your travel
expenses when you arrive home.
Travel with at least two different credit cards if you can. Depending on
where you go, you may find MasterCard accepted more frequently than
Visa (or vice versa), American Express honored or refused, and so on.
You can get cash advances from your credit card at any bank, and you
don’t even need to go to a teller — you can get a cash advance at the
ATM if you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten your PIN or didn’t even
know you had one, call the phone number on the back of your credit
card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five to seven
business days, though some banks will do it over the phone if you tell
them your mother’s maiden name or some other security clearance.
Remember the hidden expense to contend with when borrowing cash
from a credit card: Interest rates for cash advances are often signifi-
cantly higher than rates for credit-card purchases. More importantly,
you start paying interest on the advance the moment you receive the
cash. On an airline-affiliated credit card, a cash advance does not earn
frequent-flier miles.
Traveler’s checks
Traveler’s checks are something of an anachronism from the days when
people wrote personal checks instead of going to an ATM. Because you
could replace traveler’s checks if lost or stolen, they were a sound alter-
native to filling your wallet with cash at the beginning of a trip.
Still, if you prefer the security of traveler’s checks, you can get them at
almost any bank. American Express offers checks in denominations of
$20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 
1 percent to 4 percent, though AAA members can obtain checks without
a fee at most AAA offices. You can also get American Express traveler’s
checks over the phone by calling % 800-221-7282.
Visa (% 800-227-6811) also offers traveler’s checks, available at Citibank
locations across the country and at several other banks. The service
charge ranges between 1.5 percent and 2 percent; checks come in
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 63

denominations of $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. MasterCard also offers
traveler’s checks; call % 800-223-9920 for a location near you.
Although traveler’s checks are very safe, you should consider that:
 You usually get charged a commission to cash your traveler’s
checks, and when you add that to the exchange-rate loss, you end
up getting fewer pesos for your money.
 Many smaller shops don’t take traveler’s checks, so if you plan to
shop, cash the traveler’s checks before you embark on your shop-
ping expedition.
Taxing Matters
There’s a 15 percent value-added tax (IVA) on goods and services in
most of Mexico, and it’s supposed to be included in the posted price.
This tax is 10 percent in Cancún, Cozumel, and Los Cabos. Unlike other
countries (Canada and Spain, for example), Mexico doesn’t refund this
tax when visitors leave the country, so you don’t need to hang on to
those receipts for tax purposes.
All published prices you encounter in your travels around Mexico’s
beaches are likely to include all applicable taxes, except for hotel rates,
which are usually published without the 15 percent IVA and the 2 per-
cent lodging tax.
An exit tax of approximately $18 is imposed on every foreigner leaving
Mexico. This tax is usually — but not always — included in the price of
airline tickets. Be sure to reserve at least this amount in cash for your
departure day if you’re not certain that it’s included in your ticket price.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Odds are that if your wallet is gone, you’ve seen the last of it, and the
police aren’t likely to recover it for you. However, after you realize it’s
gone and you cancel your credit cards, you need to inform the police.
You may need the police-report number for credit-card or insurance pur-
poses later. After you’ve covered all the formalities and before you head
to the nearest bar to drown your sorrows, retrace your steps — you may
be surprised at how many honest people are in Mexico, and you’re likely
to discover someone trying to find you to return your wallet.
Be sure to contact all of your credit-card companies the minute you 
discover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the near-
est police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card companies
have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen;
they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
64

emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following emergency
numbers in the United States:
 American Express % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and traveler’s
check holders)
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at 
% 800-555-1212. 
To dial a U.S. toll-free number from inside Mexico, you must dial 001-880
and then the last seven digits of the toll-free number.
If you opt to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers so that you can handle this type of emergency.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com). 
Identity theft or fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID call your
airline and explain the situation; they might allow you to board the plane
if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you’ve filed.

Beach Resorts
In This Chapter
 Taking a look at airlines and airfares
 Understanding package tours
T
he obvious first step in enjoying your Mexican beach vacation is get-
ting there. It’s easy to do, but the options available can make a big
difference in the price you’ll pay. To help minimize both the cost and the
time it will take to arrive, in this chapter, we point you in the direction of
available planning tools—including the Internet—and explain the bene-
fits and limitations of traveling on a package tour. We offer tips on get-
ting the best airfares and choosing the best airline to whisk you away to
your dreamy beach in Mexico.
Flying to Mexico’s Beach Resorts
The first step for the independent travel planner is finding the airlines
that fly to the Mexico beach resort of your choice. Mexico is becoming
more easily accessible by plane, buoyed by its popularity as a nearby,
safe, and attractive place to travel. Many new regional carriers offer
scheduled service to areas previously not served. In addition to regu-
larly scheduled service, direct charter services from U.S. cities to
Mexico’s most popular destinations are making it possible to fly direct
from the largest airports in the United States. However, if you find that
no direct flights are available, you can always reach your destination
through an almost painless connection in Mexico City.
If you’re booked on a flight through Mexico City, make sure your luggage
is checked through to your final destination. This arrangement is possi-
ble if you’re flying with affiliated or code-share airlines — separate air-
lines that work closely together to help travelers reach final destinations
via connecting flights. This way, you don’t have to lug your bags through
the Mexico City airport, and it saves a lot of time during the connecting
process.

For information about saving money on airfares using the Internet, see
“Researching and Booking Your Trip Online,” later in this chapter.

Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. A coach seat is virtually the same from one carrier to another,
Chapter 6: Getting to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 67

yet the difference in price may run as high as $1,000 for a product with
the same intrinsic value.
Business travelers, who need flexibility to purchase their tickets at the
last minute, change their itinerary at a moment’s notice, or want to get
home before the weekend, pay the premium rate, known as the full fare.
Passengers who can book their ticket long in advance, who don’t mind
staying over Saturday night, or who are willing to travel on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday pay the least — usually a fraction of the full
fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops, the full fare is close to
$1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance purchase ticket is closer to
$200 to $300. Obviously, it pays to plan.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
price: usually no more than $400 for a cross-country flight. Keep your
eyes open for these sales as you’re planning your vacation. The sales
tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume. You almost never see
a sale around the peak Thanksgiving or Christmas periods, when people
have to fly, regardless of what the fare is.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald. For less-developed destinations, small travel
agents who cater to immigrant communities in large cities often have the
best deals.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records. 
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. Flights.com
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) has excellent fares worldwide
and “local” Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP;
www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith
MyTravel and so has especially good access to fares for sunny destina-
tions. Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.
com) is based in Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian
dollar for low fares; it’ll also book trips to places that U.S. travel agents
won’t touch, such as Cuba.
Here are some travel tips — tested and true — for getting the lowest
possible fare:
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
68

 Timing is everything. If you can, avoid peak travel times. In
Mexico, the weeks surrounding the Christmas/New Year holidays
and Easter are so jam-packed that we find it unenjoyable to be at 
a beach resort anyway. Airfares are relatively expensive anytime
between January and May, with September through mid-November
offering the best deals. Specials pop up throughout the year, how-
ever, based on current demand, and last-minute specials on pack-
age tours are an increasingly popular way to travel.
 Book in advance for great deals. Forgetting what we said in the
previous sentence, you can also save big by booking early — with
excellent fares available for 30-, 60-, or even 90-day advance book-
ings. Note that if you need to change your schedule, a penalty
charge of $75 to $150 is common.
 Choose an off-peak travel day. Traveling on a Tuesday, Wednesday,
or even Thursday can also save you money. Even if you can’t travel
both ways on these lower-fare days, you can still save by flying off-
peak at least one way.
 The midnight hour. In the middle of the week, just after midnight,
many airlines download cancelled low-priced airfares into their
computers, so shortly after midnight is a great time to buy newly
discounted seats. Midnight is the cutoff time for holding reserva-
tions. You may benefit by snagging cheap tickets that were just
released by those who reserved — but never purchased — their
tickets.
Researching and Booking Your Trip Online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available 
to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once,” but in reality
only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only valid
for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be booked
weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline
Web sites or check mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-
minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com). 
Chapter 6: Getting to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 69

For last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the U.S. and www.last
minute.com in Europe often have better deals than the major-label
sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia
to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or
11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you
buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to
play their “name our price” game. Note: In 2004 Priceline added non-
opaque service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights,
times, and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares
as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines 
themselves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the
airline sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcom-
ing Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday.
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.
The good news is that you don’t even have to book your trip online to
reap the research benefits of the Web. The Internet can be a valuable tool
for comparison shopping, for approaching a travel agent with a base of
knowledge, and even for chatting with other travelers to truly rate the
quality of the buffets at that all-inclusive you may be considering.
Understanding Escorted and Package Tours
First, bear in mind that there’s a big difference between an escorted tour
and a package tour. With an escorted tour, the tour company takes care of
all the details and tells you what to expect at each attraction. You know
your costs up front, and an escorted tour can take you to the maximum
number of sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount
of hassle. However, escorted tours are extremely rare in Mexico’s beach
resorts; most travelers, once they arrive at their destination, simply
book tours and excursions with local travel agents.
Package tours generally consist of round-trip airfare, ground transporta-
tion to and from your hotel, and your hotel room price, including taxes.
Some packages also include all food and beverages and most entertain-
ment and sports, when booked at an all-inclusive resort. You may find
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
70

Chapter 6: Getting to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 71
that a package tour can save you big bucks and is an ideal vacation
option. 
For popular destinations like Cancún and Puerto Vallarta, package tours
are the smart way to go. In many cases, a package that includes airfare,
hotel, and transportation to and from the airport costs less than just the
hotel alone if you booked it yourself. That’s because packages are sold
in bulk to tour operators who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like
buying your vacation at one of those large, members-only warehouse
clubs — except the tour operator is the one who buys the 1,000-count
box of garbage bags and resells them 10 at a time at a cost that under-
cuts what you’d pay at your average, neighborhood supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others. Some offer the same hotels for lower
prices. Some offer flights on scheduled airlines; others book charter
planes (which are known for having miniscule amounts of legroom). In
some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may be
limited. Some tours let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excursions
or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an
entirely escorted tour.
Each destination usually has one or two packagers that are better than
the rest because they buy in even bigger bulk. The time you spend shop-
ping around will be well rewarded.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel & Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (call % 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you;
www.libertytravel.com) is one of the biggest packagers in the
Northeast, and usually boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Other good sources of package deals are the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including Aeroméxico Vacations
(% 800-245-8585; www.aeromexico.com), Alaska Airlines Vacations
(% 800-468-2248; www.alaskaair.com), American Airlines Vacations
(% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), America West Vacations
(% 800-2-FLY-AWV; www.americawestvacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), Mexicana Vacations
(% 800-531-7921; www.mexicana.com), and United Vacations (% 888-
854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big online travel 
agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and Lastminute.com —
also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure about the pedigree
of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business Bureau in the city
where the company is based, or go online at www.bbb.org. If a packager
won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with them.

You can even shop for these packages online — try these sites for a start:
 One specialist in Mexico vacation packages is www.mexico
travelnet.com, an agency that offers most of the well-known
travel packages to Mexico beach resorts, plus offers last-minute
specials.
 Check out www.2travel.com and find a page with links to a
number of the big-name Mexico packagers, including several of the
ones listed in this chapter.
 For last-minute, air-only packages or package bargains, check out
Vacation Hot Line at www.vacationhotline.net. After you find
your “deal,” you need to call them to make final booking arrange-
ments, but they offer packages from both the popular Apple and
Funjet vacation wholesalers.
Several companies specialize in packages to Mexico’s beaches; they usu-
ally fly in their own, chartered airplanes, so they can offer greatly dis-
counted rates. Here are some of the packagers we prefer: 
 Apple Vacations (% 800-365-2775; www.applevacations.com)
offers inclusive packages to all the beach resorts and has the
largest choice of hotels in Acapulco, Cancún, Cozumel, Huatulco,
Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta, and the Riviera
Maya. Their packages are available only through travel agents.
Apple perks include baggage handling and the services of an Apple
representative at the major hotels. Note that Apple vacations must
be booked through a travel agent, but both their Web site and toll-
free number will easily connect you with one nearby you.
 Classic Custom Vacations (% 800-635-1333; www.classiccustom
vacations.com) specializes in package vacations to Mexico’s
finest luxury resorts. It combines discounted first-class and econ-
omy airfare on American, Continental, Mexicana, Alaska, America
West, and Delta with stays at the most exclusive hotels in Mexico’s
beach resorts. In many cases, packages also include meals, airport
transfers, and upgrades. The prices are not for bargain hunters but
for those who seek luxury, nicely packaged.
 Funjet Vacations (bookable through any travel agent, with general
information available on its Web site at www.funjet.com) is one of
the largest vacation packagers in the United States. Funjet has
packages to Acapulco, Cancún, Cozumel, the Riviera Maya,
Huatulco, Los Cabos, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, and Puerto Vallarta.
 GOGO Worldwide Vacations (% 888-636-3942; www.gogowwv.com)
has trips to all the major beach destinations, including Acapulco,
Cancún, Puerto Vallarta, and Los Cabos, offering several exclusive
deals from higher-end hotels. These trips are bookable through any
travel agent.

W
hether you’ve chosen a package deal or you’re planning your trip
on your own, getting a room is a crucial part of your vacation
planning. In this chapter, we help you decipher the various rates and
provide some tips on how to get the best one, including searching the
Internet for your ideal place to stay. We also compare the pros and cons
of different types of places to stay.
Getting to Know Your Options
From small inns to large all-inclusives, Mexico’s beach resorts offer
every type of vacation accommodation. And the prices can vary even
more! Recommendations for specific places to stay are in the chapters
devoted to the individual beach towns. We try to provide the widest
range of options — both in types of hotels as well as budgets — but we
always keep comfort in mind. What you find in this book is what we
believe to be the best value for the money. Here are the major types of
accommodations:
 Resorts: These accommodations tend to be the most popular
option — especially with package tours — because they offer the
most modern amenities, including cable TV, hair dryers, in-room
safes, and generally, a selection of places to dine or have a drink.
Large by definition, they may also boast various types of sporting
facilities, spa services, shopping arcades, and tour-desk services.
These places also tend to be the most expensive type of accommo-
dation, but they can be heavily discounted if your timing is right.
 Hotels: These quarters tend to be smaller than resorts, with fewer
facilities. In terms of style, look for anything from hacienda-style

villas to all-suite hotels or sleek, modern structures. Most hotels at
Mexican beach resorts have at least a small swimming pool, and if
they’re not located directly on a beach, hotels frequently offer shut-
tle service to a beach club or an affiliate beachfront hotel.
 All-inclusives: In Mexico, all-inclusives are gaining rapidly in popu-
larity, and they seem to be getting larger and larger in size. As the
name implies, all-inclusives tie everything together in one price —
your room, meals, libations, entertainment, sports activities, and
sometimes, off-site excursions. The advantage that many travelers
find with this option is an expected fixed price for their vacation —
helpful if you need to stay within a strict budget. Many all-inclusives
have their own nightclubs or, at least, offer evening shows and
entertainment, such as theme nights, talent contests, or costume
parties. As for the food, you may never go hungry, but you’re unlikely
to go gourmet either. Food quality can be an important variable,
about which it helps to have talked to someone who’s recently
been to the particular all-inclusive, or check online message boards
for up-to-date commentaries on the buffets.
 Condos, apartments, and villas: These accommodations can be
good options, especially if you’re considering a stay longer than a
week, and the reach of the Internet has made these lodging options
extremely viable. Many condos, apartments, and villas come with
housekeepers or even cooks. It’s hard to know exactly what you’re
getting — and often it’s futile to complain after you arrive — so
again, word of mouth can be helpful here. At the very least, ask for
references or search on the Internet to see whether anyone can
offer an experience. In addition to the Internet, select options are
always advertised in the major metropolitan newspapers, such as
the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and the New York Times.
My recommendation? Save this option for your second visit when
you have a better idea about the various parts of town and the area
in general.
In Mexico, where smoking is still the norm, expect that your room will 
be smoker-friendly. However having said that, an increasing number of
hotels — especially the larger resorts — now offer non-smoking rooms.
And, many of the holistic-oriented retreats along the Riviera Maya are
smoke-free. Be sure to ask when booking a room to ensure you get your
preference.
Mexico’s system of rating hotels and resorts is rather generous on its
handing out of “stars.” Here, the top-of-the-line resorts are known as
“Grand Turismo,” and from there, it ranges from five stars down. So,
booking a four-star resort will generally result in much more modest
accommodations than the equivalent ranking in the U.S.
Below, Table 7-1 shows you how we’ve categorized hotel prices in each
of the remaining chapters. Our rankings consider prices for a room
based on double occupancy for one night during high season.

These accommodations are simple and

include basic rooms with hammocks for
sleeping in.

Rooms in this category are generally

Or, in some of the more remote parts of
Mexico, this category could be the top of
the line.

$176–$250
Higher-class still, these accommodations
are plush, and with ocean views and direct
beach access. Think chocolates on your

Many all-inclusives fall into this category,
so your meals and drinks will also be part
of the price you pay for the room.
$$$$$
$251 and up
These top-rated accommodations come
with luxury amenities such as valet park-
ing, on-premise spas, and in-room hot tubs,
plasma-screen TVs, and CD players — but
you pay for ’em.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
When it comes to rates, the most common term is rack rate. The rack
rate is the maximum rate that a resort or hotel charges for a room. It’s
the rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room on a night
that the place is close to being full.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
76

The rack rate is the first rate a hotel offers, but you usually don’t have to
pay it. Always ask whether a lower rate or special package is available —
it can’t hurt, and you may at least end up with a free breakfast or spa
service.
In this book, we use rack rates as a guidepost, not expecting that you’ll
have to pay them. Minimum night stays, special promotions, and sea-
sonal discounts can all go a long way in bringing the rack rate down.
Also, be sure to mention your frequent-flier or corporate-rewards pro-
grams if you book with one of the larger hotel chains. Please note that
rates change very often, so the prices quoted in this book may be differ-
ent from the prices you’re quoted when you make your reservation.
Room rates also rise and fall with occupancy rates. If your choice of
hotels is close to empty, it pays to negotiate. Resorts tend to be much
more crowded during weekends. If you’re traveling off season (see
Chapter 4 for peak and low occupancy times) you can almost certainly
negotiate a bargain.
My experience is you’ll get the best rate by booking your hotel as part of
an air-hotel package (see Chapter 6), but in lieu of that, try contacting
the local number for your best chance of negotiating the best rate. Just
note — it may help if you speak Spanish.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop they must, for prices can vary considerably
from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing
may be there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the
placement.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and
“virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so you can see what you’re
paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that the best rooms
are often held back from bargain booking Web sites). Travelocity posts
unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An
excellent free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you
search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have heard
of — and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes
and service charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb.
com), is partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton,
Hyatt, and Starwood chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the
hotels’ reservations systems — unlike independent online agencies,
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 77

which have to fax or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good por-
tion of which get misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have
arrived at the hotel, only to be told that they have no reservation. To be
fair, many of the major sites are undergoing improvements in service and
ease of use, and Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reser-
vations systems of many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news
for consumers. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation
number and make a printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much
better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding
anything at the bottom of the scale. On the down side, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingforTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not
provide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities
when you book a room through opaque online services. Following are
some of our favorite resources for booking vacation accommodations:
 Although the name All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com)
is something of a misnomer, the site does have tens of thousands of
listings throughout the world. Bear in mind that each hotel has
paid a small fee ($25 and up) to be listed, so it’s less of an objective
list and more like a book of online brochures.
 hoteldiscount!com (www.180096hotel.com) lists bargain room
rates at hotels in more than 50 U.S. and international cities. The
cool thing is that hoteldiscount!com prebooks blocks of rooms in
advance, so sometimes it has rooms — at discount rates — at
hotels that are “sold out.” Select a city and input your dates, and
you get a list of the best prices for a selection of hotels. This site is
notable for delivering deep discounts in cities where hotel rooms
are expensive. The toll-free number is printed all over this site 
(% 800-96-HOTEL); call it if you want more options than are listed
online.
 InnSite (www.innsite.com) has B&B listings in all 50 U.S. states
and more than 50 countries around the globe. Find an inn at your
destination, see pictures of the rooms, and check prices and avail-
ability. This extensive directory of bed-and-breakfasts only includes
listings if the proprietor submitted one. (It’s free to get an inn listed.)
Innkeepers write the descriptions, and many listings link to the inns’
own Web sites. Also check out the Bed and Breakfast Channel
(www.bedandbreakfast.com).
 Places to Stay (www.placestostay.com) lists one-of-a-kind places,
with a focus on resort accommodations, in the United States and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
78

abroad that you may not find in other directories. Again, listing is
selective: This directory isn’t comprehensive, but it can give you a
sense of what’s available at different destinations.
 TravelWeb (www.travelweb.com) lists more than 26,000 hotels in
170 countries, focusing on chains such as Hyatt and Hilton, and you
can book almost 90 percent of these listings online. The site’s Click-
It Weekends, updated each Monday, offers weekend deals at many
leading hotel chains.
 Specific to Mexico, Mexico Boutique Hotels (http://mexico
boutiquehotels.com) has listings of small, unique properties that
are unlikely to show up on the radar screens of most travel agents
or large Web travel sites. In addition to complete descriptions, the
site also offers an online booking service.
 Another site specializing in Mexico accommodations is 
www.mexicohotels.com.
 Check the Web sites of Mexico’s top hotel chains for special 
deals. These include www.caminoreal.com, www.hyatt.com,
www.starwoodhotels.com, and www.fiestaamericana.com.
Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t always
cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a room
away from the renovation work — this is especially true in Cancún,
where construction following the damage from Hurricane Wilma made
the entire beachfront a construction zone. Inquire, too, about the loca-
tion of the restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of
annoying noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you
arrive, talk to the front desk. If they have another room, they should be
happy to accommodate you, within reason.
Mention that you are honeymooners, and ask for the best available 
room — Mexico’s beach resorts are especially accommodating to 
newlyweds.
Most beachfront hotels offer either ground-floor rooms with terraces, or
upper-level rooms with balconies. If you have a preference, be sure to
request it at the time of booking.

Tips for Travelers with
Special Needs or Interests
In This Chapter
 Bringing the kids along
 Looking at senior citizens’ needs
 Considering tips for travelers with a disability
 Stepping out: Gay and lesbian travel info
 Taking a jaunt by yourself
 Getting hitched in Mexico
M
ost people consider themselves unique with special needs, but
some types of travelers really do warrant a little extra advice. In
this chapter, we cover information that’s helpful to know if you’re travel-
ing with children, if you’re a senior traveler, if you have special needs
because of a disability, if you’re gay or lesbian, if you’re traveling solo, or
if you’re planning on tying the knot in Mexico. Throughout the chapter,
we clue you in on what to expect, offer some useful tips, and whenever
possible, steer you to experts concerning your particular circumstances.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Children are considered the national treasure of Mexico, and Mexicans
warmly welcome and cater to your kids. Although many parents were
reluctant to bring young children to Mexico in the past, primarily due to
health concerns, we can’t think of a better place to introduce children to
the exciting adventure of exploring a different culture. Some of the best
destinations for children include Puerto Vallarta, Cancún, and Acapulco.
Hotels can often arrange for a baby sitter. Some hotels in the moderate-
to-luxury range have small playgrounds and pools for children and hire
caretakers who offer special-activity programs during the day, but few
budget hotels offer these amenities. All-inclusive resorts make great
options for family travel because, as a rule, they offer exhaustive activi-
ties programs. They also make mealtime easy by offering buffet-style
meal services almost around the clock.

Before leaving for your trip, check with your pediatrician or family
doctor to get advice on medications to take along. Diapers cost about
the same in Mexico as they do in the United States, but the quality is
poorer. You can get brand-name diapers identical to the ones sold in the
United States, but you’ll pay a higher price. Many stores sell familiar,
brand-name baby foods. Dry cereals, powdered formulas, baby bottles,
and purified water are all easily available in midsize and large cities or
resorts.
Cribs, however, may present a problem; only the largest and most luxuri-
ous hotels provide them. However, rollaway beds to accommodate chil-
dren staying in a room with their parents are often available. Child seats
or highchairs at restaurants are common, and most restaurants go out of
their way to accommodate the comfort of your children. You may want
to consider bringing your own car seat along because they’re not readily
available to rent in Mexico.
We recommend that you take coloring books, puzzles, and small games
with you to keep your children entertained during the flight or whenever
you’re traveling from one destination to the next. Another good idea is
to take a blank notebook, in which your children can paste little sou-
venirs from the trip, such as the label from the beer Daddy drank on the
beach or small shells and flowers that they collect. And don’t forget to
carry small scissors (pack the scissors during the flight due to security
reasons) and a glue stick with you, or the blank notebook may remain
blank.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites like the (www.familytravelforum.com), a comprehensive site
that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel Network (www.
familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that offers travel
features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally with Your Kids
(www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site that offers 
customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.thefamily
travelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a directory of
off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families. 
Throughout this book you’ll notice the Kid Friendly icon, which will alert
you to those hotels, restaurants, and activities that are especially suit-
able for family travelers.
For children under 18 traveling without parents or with only one parent,
they must travel with a notarized letter from the absent parent or par-
ents authorizing the travel. We go over this in detail in Chapter 9, in the
discussion on entry requirements into Mexico. Don’t arrive at the air-
port without it, or your trip to those powdery white beaches will be
delayed!

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Mexico is a popular country for retirees and for senior travelers. For
decades, North Americans have been living indefinitely in Mexico by
returning to the border and re-crossing with a new tourist permit every
six months. Mexican immigration officials have caught on, and they now
limit the maximum time you can spend in the country to six months in
any given year. This measure is meant to encourage even partial resi-
dents to comply with the proper documentation procedures. The follow-
ing can provide some information for seniors thinking of retiring in
Mexico:
 AIM (Adventures in Mexico) is a well-written, candid, and informa-
tive newsletter for prospective retirees. Recent issues evaluated
retirement in Puerto Vallarta, Puerto Angel, Puerto Escondido, and
Huatulco. For subscriptions, which are $18 to the United States and
$25 to Canada, write to Apdo. Postal 31–70, 45050 Guadalajara,
Jalisco, Mexico. Back issues are three for $5.
 Sanborn Tours (2015 South 10th St., McAllen, TX, 78503; % 800-
395-8482; www.sanborns.com) offers a “Retire in Mexico” orienta-
tion tour.
 Puerto Vallarta resident and author Polly Vicars’s Tales of
Retirement in Paradise offers an entertaining account of the
pleasures of “retired” life in this seaside town — a very popular
beach resort with senior travelers. All proceeds from the book go
to the America-Mexico Foundation (www.pvnet.com.mx/amf),
which provides scholarships to needy and deserving Mexican stu-
dents. You can buy the $14 book online through Amazon.com
(www.amazon.com) or purchase it directly from the author via
e-mail at phvicars@pvnet.com.mx. The book is also available for
sale in Puerto Vallarta at bookstores and various shops.
People over the age of 60 are traveling more than ever before. And why
not? Being a senior citizen entitles you to some terrific travel bargains.
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although all of the major U.S. airlines except America West
have cancelled their senior discount and coupon book programs, many
hotels still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, people over the age
of 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other
attractions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation. 
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.

programs for those 55 and over (and a spouse or companion of any age)
in the United States and in more than 80 countries around the world.
Most courses last five to seven days in the United States (two to four
weeks abroad), and many include airfare, accommodations in university
dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition. ElderTreks (% 800-741-
7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group tours to off-the-beaten-
path or adventure-travel locations, restricted to travelers 50 and older.
INTRAV (% 800-456-8100; www.intrav.com) is a high-end tour operator
that caters to the mature, discerning traveler, not specifically seniors,
with trips around the world that include guided safaris, polar expedi-
tions, private-jet adventures, and small-boat cruises down jungle rivers. 
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617-350-7500;

Heilman.
Mature Outlook (% 800-267-3277) is a similar organization, sponsored
by Sears, which offers discounts on car rentals and hotel stays. The
$19.95 annual membership fee also gets you $200 in Sears coupons and a
bimonthly magazine, New Outlook, plus access to its online version, at
www.newoutlook.ca. Membership is open to all Sears customers 18 and
over, but the organization’s primary focus is on the 50-and-over market.
Accessing Mexico’s Beaches: Advice 
for Travelers with Disabilities
A disability needn’t stop anybody from traveling. More options and
resources are available than ever before. 
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers extensive
access information and advice for traveling around the world with dis-
abilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339) caters
to wheelchair travelers and their families and friends.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include the
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a library of
accessible-travel resources online; SATH (Society for Accessible Travel
and Hospitality; % 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual membership

fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which offers a wealth of
travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed recommenda-
tions on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehi-
cle rentals, and companion services; and the American Foundation for
the Blind (AFB; % 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), a referral resource for
the blind or visually impaired that includes information on traveling with
Seeing Eye dogs.
For more information specifically targeted to travelers with disabilities,
check out the quarterly magazine Emerging Horizons ($14.95 per year,
$19.95 outside the U.S.; www.emerginghorizons.com), and Open World
Magazine, published by SATH (subscription: $13 per year, $21 outside
the U.S.).
A World of Options, a 658-page book of resources for travelers with dis-
abilities, covers everything from biking trips to scuba outfitters. It costs
$35 and is available from Mobility International USA (P.O. Box 10767,
Eugene, OR 97440; % 541-343-1284 voice and TTY; www.miusa.org).
However, we need to honestly say that Mexico does fall far behind 
other countries when it comes to accessible travel. In fact, you may feel
like you’re maneuvering one giant obstacle course. At airports, you 
may encounter steep stairs before finding a well-hidden elevator or 
escalator — if one exists. Airlines often arrange wheelchair assistance
for passengers to the baggage area. Porters are generally available to
help with luggage at airports and large bus stations after you clear bag-
gage claim.
Escalators (and there aren’t many in the beach resorts) are often 
non-operational. Stairs without handrails abound. Few restrooms are
equipped for travelers with disabilities, and when one is available,
access to it may be via a narrow passage that doesn’t accommodate a
wheelchair or a person on crutches. Many deluxe hotels (the most expen-
sive) now have rooms with baths for people with disabilities. Budget
travelers may be best off looking for single-story motels, although
accessing showers and bathrooms may still pose a problem outside of
specially equipped deluxe hotels. Generally speaking, no matter where
you are, someone will lend a hand, although you may have to ask for it.
Although Mexico’s international airports are become increasingly 
modernized in recent years, there are still some parts of Mexico that
don’t regularly offer the luxury of boarding an airplane from the waiting
room. You either descend stairs to a bus that ferries you to a waiting
plane that you board by climbing stairs, or you walk across the airport
tarmac to your plane and climb up the stairs. Deplaning presents the
same problems in reverse.
In our opinion, the wide, modern streets and sidewalks of Cancún make
it among the most “accessible” resort destinations. In addition to the
superior public facilities, you can find numerous accommodation options
for travelers with disabilities.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
84

In addition to Cancún, over the past several years, the downtown area of
Puerto Vallarta has become almost fully “accessible” for those with dis-
abilities, adding ramps to all sidewalks, the central plaza, and along the
seaside malecón (boardwalk), thanks to the efforts of a local activist.
These enhancements also make Puerto Vallarta especially appealing for
those with strollers, or others in search of friendlier curbs and walking
areas.
Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Mexico is a conservative country with deeply rooted Catholic religious
traditions. Public displays of same-sex affection are rare, especially out-
side the major resort areas. Women in Mexico frequently walk hand in
hand, but anything more crosses the boundary of acceptability. However,
gay and lesbian travelers are generally treated with respect and shouldn’t
experience any harassment, assuming the appropriate regard is given to
local culture and customs. Puerto Vallarta, with its selection of accom-
modations and entertainment oriented especially toward gay and lesbian
travelers, is perhaps the most welcoming and accepting destination in
Mexico. Susan Weisman’s travel service, Bayside Properties (% 322-
223-4424; www.baysidepuertovallarta.com), rents gay-friendly
condos, villas, and hotels for individuals and large groups. Her services
are customized to individual needs, and she can offer airport pickups
and in-villa cooks.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry, and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to their Web site and click on
“Members.”
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay 
and lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated
travel service. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or 510-655-
0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships for exclusive
lesbian vacations and offers smaller group experiences for both gay and
lesbian travelers.
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores, or you can order them from Giovanni’s
Room bookstore, 1145 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19107 (% 215-923-2960;
www.giovannisroom.com): Frommer’s Gay & Lesbian Europe, an excel-
lent travel resource (www.frommers.com); Out and About (% 800-929-
2268 or 415-644-8044; www.outandabout.com), which offers guidebooks
Chapter 8: Tips for Travelers with Special Needs or Interests 85

and a newsletter ($20 per year; 10 issues) packed with solid information
on the global gay and lesbian scene; Spartacus International Gay
Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag; www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide)
and Odysseus, both good, annual English-language guidebooks focused
on gay men; the Damron guides (www.damron.com), with separate,
annual books for gay men and lesbians; and Gay Travel A to Z: The
World of Gay & Lesbian Travel Options at Your Fingertips by
Marianne Ferrari (Ferrari International; Box 35575, Phoenix, AZ 85069), a
very good gay and lesbian guidebook series.
Arco Iris is a gay-owned, full-service travel agency and tour operator
specializing in Mexico packages and special group travel. Contact the
agency by phone (% 800-765-4370 or 619-297-0897; Fax: 619-297-6419)
or through its Web site at www.arcoiristours.com. They also publish
the Cancún Pink Pages guide, which is free with the booking of any pack-
age tour, or can be ordered for $5 online on its Web site.
Traveling Solo
Mexico is a great place to travel on your own without really being or 
feeling alone. Although identical room rates for single and double occu-
pancy are slowly becoming a trend in Mexico, many of the hotels in this
book still offer single rooms at lower rates.
Mexicans are very friendly, and meeting other foreigners is easy. But 
if you don’t like the idea of traveling alone, try Travel Companion
Exchange (TCE; P.O. Box 833, Amityville, NY 11701; % 631-454-0880;
Fax: 631-454-0170; www.travelcompanions.com), which brings prospec-
tive travelers together. Members complete a profile and then place an
anonymous listing of their travel interests in the newsletter. Prospective
traveling companions then make contact through the exchange. Mem-
bership costs $99 for six months or $159 for a year. TCE also offers an
excellent booklet, for $4.95, on avoiding theft and scams while traveling
abroad.
As a female traveling alone, Lynne can tell you firsthand that she gener-
ally feels safer traveling in Mexico than in the United States. But she uses
the same common-sense precautions she uses when traveling anywhere
else in the world, and she stays alert to what’s going on around her.
Mexicans, in general, and men, in particular, are nosy about single travel-
ers, especially women. If taxi drivers or anyone else with whom you
don’t want to become friendly asks about your marital status, family,
and so on, my advice is to make up a set of answers (regardless of the
truth): “I’m married, traveling with friends, and I have three children.”
Saying you’re single and traveling alone may send out the wrong mes-
sage about availability. Face it — whether you like it or not, Mexico is
still a macho country with the double standards that a macho attitude
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
86

implies. Movies and television shows exported from the United States
have created an image of sexually aggressive North American women. If
someone bothers you, don’t try to be polite — just leave or head into a
public place.
You may even consider wearing a ring that resembles a wedding band.
Most Mexican men stay away at the sight of a ring, and it also deters
many uncomfortable questions.

Mexico, check out the following online resources:

Planning a Wedding in Mexico
Mexico’s beaches may be old favorites for romantic honeymoons, but
have you ever considered taking the plunge in Mexico? A destination
wedding saves money and can be less hassle compared with marrying
back home. Many hotels and attractions offer wedding packages, which
can include everything from booking the officiant to hiring the videogra-
pher. Pick the plan you want and, presto, your wedding decisions are
done! Several properties also provide the services of a wedding coordi-
nator (either for free or at a reasonable cost) who not only scouts out
sweetheart pink roses but also can handle marriage licenses and other
formalities. A destination wedding can be as informal or as traditional as
you like. After returning from their honeymoon, many couples hold a
reception for people back home who couldn’t join them. At these par-
ties, couples sometimes continue the theme of their wedding locale
(decorate with piñatas or hire a mariachi band, for example) and show a
video of their ceremony so that everyone can share in their happiness.
If you invite guests to your destination wedding, find out about group
rates for hotels and airfare, which can save 20 percent or more off regu-
lar prices. Plan as far ahead as possible so that people can arrange their
schedules and join you.
Under a treaty between the United States and Mexico, Mexican civil 
marriages are automatically valid in the United States. You need certified
copies of birth certificates, driver’s licenses, or passports; certified proof
of divorce or the death certificate of any former spouses (if applicable);
tourist cards (provided when you enter Mexico); and results of blood
tests performed in Mexico within 15 days before the ceremony.

Check with a local, on-site wedding planner through your hotel to verify
all the necessary requirements and obtain an application well in advance
of your desired wedding date. Contact the Mexican Tourism Board 
(% 800-446-3942; www.visitmexico.com) for information.

A
re you ready? Really ready? Before you can string that hammock
between the palms, you need to take care of a few more details to
get to your personal paradise.
In this chapter, we cover the essentials and the requirements of getting
into Mexico — and then back home again. We also review the ins and
outs of dealing with travel insurance, discuss what you need to know to
ensure a safe trip, help you decide whether you need to rent a car, and
offer tips to make sure you pack everything you need for your Mexican
beach vacation.
Arriving In and Departing From Mexico
All travelers to Mexico are required to present proof of citizenship,
such as a valid passport (the preferred documentation — see the next
section), an original birth certificate with a raised seal, or naturalization
papers. If you’re using a birth certificate, bring a current form of photo
identification, such as a driver’s license or an official ID card. If your 
last name on the birth certificate is different from your current name
(women using a married name, for example), you also need to bring a
photo ID card and legal proof of the name change, such as the original
marriage license or certificate.

When reentering the United States, you must prove both your citizen-
ship and your identification, so always carry a picture ID such as a
driver’s license or valid passport.
Birth certificates enable you to enter Mexico, but alone, don’t enable
you to reenter the United States. And although you can enter Mexico
using a driver’s license as identification, this document alone isn’t
acceptable identification for reentering the United States. While in
Mexico, you must also obtain a Mexican tourist permit (FMT), which is
issued free of charge by Mexican border officials after proof of citizen-
ship is accepted. Airlines generally provide these forms aboard your
flight into Mexico.
The tourist permit (FMT) is more important than a passport in Mexico,
so guard it carefully. If you lose your FMT, you may not be permitted to
leave the country until you can replace it — a bureaucratic hassle that
can take anywhere from a few hours to a week. (If you do lose your
tourist permit, get a police report from local authorities indicating that
your documents were stolen; having one may lessen the hassle of exiting
the country without all your identification.) You should also contact the
nearest consular office to report the stolen papers so that the consulate
can issue a reentry document.
Note that children under the age of 18 traveling without parents or with
only one parent must have a notarized letter from the absent parent or
parents authorizing the travel. The letter must include the duration of
the visit, destination, names of accompanying adults, parents’ home
addresses, telephone numbers, and so forth. A picture of the child must
also be attached to this letter. When applicable, provide divorce, death
certificate, or guardianship papers.
Getting a Passport
Although you can enter Mexico without a passport, the only legal form
of identification recognized around the world is a valid passport. For
that reason alone, having your passport whenever you travel abroad is a
good idea. In the United States, you’re used to your driver’s license
being the all-purpose ID card. Abroad, it only proves that some
American state lets you drive. Getting a passport is easy, but it takes
some time to complete the process.
The U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs maintains an
excellent Web site (www.travel.state.gov) with good information
about passports, including downloadable applications and locations of
passport offices; just follow the link to “Passport Information.” In addi-
tion, the Web site provides extensive information about foreign coun-
tries, including travel warnings about health and terrorism. You can also
call the National Passport Information Center at % 877-487-2778 ($4.95
per call).

If you’re a resident of Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, or
New Zealand, you can find passport information for your home country
in the upcoming section, “Applying for other passports.”
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office. To find your
regional passport office, either check the U.S. State Department
Web site, http://travel.state.gov, or call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated
information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
(Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social
security card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2-x-2-
inches in size. You often find businesses that take these photos
near a passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-
vending machine because the pictures aren’t identical. 
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $85. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $70.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over 16 when it was issued), you can renew
the passport by mail for $55. Whether you’re applying in person or by
mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State
Department Web site at http://travel.state.gov. For general infor-
mation, call the National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518). To find
your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State Department
Web site or call the National Passport Information Center toll-free
number (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom:
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how
and where to apply. 
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 91

 Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices through-
out Canada, post offices, or from the central Passport Office,
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa,
ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications
must be accompanied by two identical passport-sized photographs
and proof of Canadian citizenship. Processing takes five to ten days
if you apply in person, or about three weeks by mail.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from their Web site. For
information, contact the Passports Office or download it from their
Web site. Contact the Passports Office at % 0800-225-050 in New
Zealand or 04-474-8100, or log on to www.passports.govt.nz.
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
10-year passport (5-year passport for children under 16) at pass-
port offices, major post offices, or a travel agency. For information,
contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410;
www.ukpa.gov.uk).
Clearing U.S. Customs
You can take it with you — up to a point. Technically, no limits exist on
how much loot U.S. citizens can bring back into the United States from a
trip abroad, but the Customs authority does put limits on how much you
can bring in for free. (This limit is mainly for taxation purposes, to sepa-
rate tourists with souvenirs from importers.)
As a U.S. citizen, you may bring home $800 worth of goods duty-free, as
long as you’ve been out of the country at least 48 hours and haven’t
used the exemption in the past 30 days. This amount includes one liter
of an alcoholic beverage (you must, of course, be older than 21), 200 cig-
arettes, and 100 cigars. Anything you mail home from abroad is exempt
from the $800 limit. You may mail up to $200 worth of goods to yourself
(marked “for personal use”) and up to $100 to others (marked “unso-
licited gift”) once each day, so long as the package doesn’t include alco-
hol or tobacco products. You have to pay an import duty on anything
over these limits.
Note that buying items at a duty-free shop before flying home doesn’t
exempt them from counting toward U.S. Customs limits (monetary or
otherwise). The “duty” that you’re avoiding in those shops is the local
tax on the item (such as state sales tax in the United States), not any
import duty that may be assessed by the U.S. Customs office.
If you have further questions, or for a list of specific items you can’t
bring into the United States, look in your phone book (under U.S.
Government, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs & Border
Protection) to find the nearest Customs office. Or check out the Customs
& Border Protection Web site at www.cbp.gov.

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here is our advice
on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in Oct 2001 because they were wary of flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
insured.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back
on goods and services not received if they report the loss within 60
days after the charge is listed on their credit-card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever: Some experts suggest you avoid buying insurance from the
tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s better to
buy from a “third party” insurer than to put all your money in one
place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check before you go,
particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
For travel overseas, most health plans (including Medicare and
Medicaid) do not provide coverage, and the ones that do often
require you to pay for services upfront and reimburse you only after
you return home. Even if your plan does cover overseas treatment,
most out-of-country hospitals make you pay your bills upfront, and
send you a refund only after you’ve returned home and filed the
necessary paperwork with your insurance company. As a safety net,
you may want to buy travel medical insurance, particularly if you’re
traveling to a remote or high-risk area where emergency evacuation
is a possible scenario. If you require additional medical insurance,
try MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com)
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 93

or Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-2828; www.travel
assistance.com; for general information on services, call the com-
pany’s Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see if
your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get bag-
gage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance
package, or buy Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insur-
ance at the airport, as it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any
valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage,
as many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies. 
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com); Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travel
guard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.
travelinsured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Apart from how getting sick can ruin your vacation, it also can present
the problem of finding a doctor you trust when you’re away from home.
Bring all your medications with you, as well as a prescription for more —
you may run out. Bring an extra pair of contact lenses in case you lose
one. And don’t forget the Pepto-Bismol for common travelers’ ailments
like upset stomach or diarrhea.
If you have health insurance, check with your provider to find out the
extent of your coverage outside of your home area. Be sure to carry
your identification card in your wallet. And if you worry that your exist-
ing policy isn’t sufficient, purchase medical insurance for more compre-
hensive coverage. (See “Playing It Safe with Travel and Medical
Insurance,” earlier in this chapter.)
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/
or chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298;
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
94

www.medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condi-
tion and gives them access to your records through Medic Alert’s 24-hour
hot line. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance
to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries you’re
visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors. The United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.cdc.
gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by region or
country and offers tips on food safety.
If you do get sick, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a local
doctor — even his or her own doctor, if necessary. Another good option
is to call the closest consular office and ask for a referral to a doctor.
Most consulates have a listing of reputable English-speaking doctors.
Most beach destinations in Mexico have at least one modern facility
staffed by doctors used to treating the most common ailments of
tourists. 
In the case of a real emergency, a service from the United States can fly
people to American hospitals: Air-Evac (% 888-554-9729; www.airevac.
com) is a 24-hour air ambulance. You can also contact the service in
Guadalajara (% 01-800-305-9400, 3-616-9616, or 3-615-2471). Several
companies offer air-evacuation service; for a list, refer to the U.S. State
Department Web site at http://travel.state.gov.
From our 12 years’ experience of living in and traveling throughout
Mexico, we can honestly say that most health problems that foreign
tourists to Mexico encounter are self-induced. If you take in too much
sun, too many margaritas, and too many street tacos within hours of
your arrival, don’t blame the water if you get sick. You’d be surprised
how many people try to make up for all the fun they’ve missed in the
past year on their first day of vacation in Mexico.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 95
Avoiding turista!
It’s called “travelers’ diarrhea” or turista, the Spanish word for “tourist.” I’m talking
about the persistent diarrhea, often accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting, that
used to attack many travelers to Mexico. Some folks in the United States call this afflic-
tion “Montezuma’s revenge,” but you won’t hear it referred to this way in Mexico.
Widespread improvements in infrastructure, sanitation, and education have practi-
cally eliminated this ailment, especially in well-developed resort areas. Most travel-
ers make a habit of drinking only bottled water, which also helps to protect against
unfamiliar bacteria. In resort areas, and generally throughout Mexico, only purified
ice is used. Doctors say this ailment isn’t caused by just one “bug,” but by a combi-
nation of consuming different foods and water, upsetting your schedule, being over-
tired, and experiencing the stresses of travel. A good high-potency (or “therapeutic”)
(continued)

Keeping the kids healthy
If you’re traveling with infants and/or children in Mexico, be extra care-
ful to avoid anything that’s not bottled. You can readily purchase infant
formulas, baby foods, canned milk, and other baby supplies from gro-
cery stores. Your best bet is to carry extra baby eats when you go out.
Most Mexican restaurants cheerfully warm bottles and packaged goods
for your child.
Be especially careful of sun exposure because sunburn can be extremely
dangerous. Protect the little ones with special SPF bathing suits and
cover-ups and regularly apply a strong sunscreen. (While you’re at it,
don’t forget a fairly strong sunscreen for yourself.)
Dehydration can also make your child seriously ill. Make sure your child
drinks plenty of water and juices throughout the day. Especially when
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
96
vitamin supplement and extra vitamin C can help. And yogurt is good for healthy diges-
tion. If you do happen to come down with this ailment, nothing beats Pepto-Bismol,
readily available in Mexico.
Preventing turista: The U.S. Public Health Service recommends the following meas-
ures for preventing travelers’ diarrhea:
 Get enough sleep.
 Don’t overdo the sun.
 Drink only purified water, which means tea, coffee, and other beverages made
with boiled water; canned or bottled carbonated beverages and water; or beer
and wine. Most restaurants with a large tourist clientele use only purified water
and ice.
 Choose food carefully. In general, avoid salads, uncooked vegetables, and unpas-
teurized milk or milk products (including cheese). However, salads in a first-class
restaurant, or in a restaurant that serves a lot of tourists, are generally safe to eat.
Choose food that’s freshly cooked and still hot. Peelable fruit is ideal. Don’t eat
undercooked meat, fish, or shellfish.
 In addition, something as simple as washing hands frequently can prevent the
spread of germs and go a long way toward keeping turista at bay.
Because dehydration can quickly become life-threatening, be especially careful to
replace fluids and electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and the like) during a bout of diar-
rhea. Rehydrate by drinking Pedialyte, a rehydration solution available at most
Mexican pharmacies, sports drinks, or glasses of natural fruit juice (high in potassium)
with a pinch of salt added. Or try a glass of boiled, pure water with a quarter teaspoon
of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and a bit of lime juice added.
(continued)

they’re in the pool or at the beach having fun, they may not remember
that they’re thirsty, so reminding them is your job. Sunburn also 
contributes to and complicates dehydration.
Staying Safe
If you find yourself getting friendly with the locals — and we mean
friendly to the point of a fling — don’t be embarrassed to carry or insist
on stopping for condoms — then use them! Too many vacationing men
and women are filled with morning-after regrets because they didn’t 
protect themselves. Don’t allow your fear of being judged make you
unprepared. Also know that Mexico’s teen-to-20-something population
has a rapidly escalating HIV/AIDS rate — especially in resort areas —
due to the transient nature of the population and poor overall education
about this disease.
And when it comes to drugs, many outsiders have the impression that
the easy-going nature of these tropical towns means an equally laid-back
attitude exists toward drug use. Not so. Marijuana, cocaine, Ecstasy,
crystal methamphetamine, and other mood-altering drugs are illegal in
Mexico. In some resorts, such as Puerto Vallarta, police randomly search
people — including obvious tourists — who are walking the streets at
night. However, unless you seek drugs out, whatever behind-the-scenes
action there is won’t likely affect you.
If you do choose to indulge, don’t expect any special treatment if you’re
caught. In fact, everything bad you’ve ever heard about a Mexican jail is
considered to be close to the truth — if not a rose-colored version of it.
Mexico employs the Napoleonic Code of law, meaning that you’re guilty
until proven innocent. Simply stated, using drugs isn’t worth the poten-
tial high. That’s what tequila’s for!
Renting a Car
First, know that car-rental costs are high in Mexico because cars are
more expensive here. However, the condition of rental cars has improved
greatly over the years, and clean, comfortable, new cars are the norm. 
At press time, the basic cost for a one-day rental of a Volkswagen (VW)
Beetle, with unlimited mileage (but before the 15 percent tax and $15–$25
daily charge for insurance), was $48 in Cancún, $44 in Puerto Vallarta,
and $40 in Acapulco. Renting by the week gives you a lower daily rate.
Avis was offering a basic seven-day weekly rate for a VW Beetle (before
tax or insurance) of $220 in Cancún and Puerto Vallarta and $200 in
Acapulco. Prices may be considerably higher if you rent in these same
cities around a major holiday.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 97

Car-rental companies usually write up a credit-card charge in U.S. dollars.
Be careful of deductibles, which vary greatly in Mexico. Some deductibles
are as high as $2,500, which immediately comes out of your pocket in
case of car damage. Hertz has a $1,000 deductible on a VW Beetle; the
deductible at Avis is $500 for the same car.
Always get the insurance; any coverage provided by your credit card or
your own insurance policy isn’t valid in Mexico. Insurance is offered in
two parts. Collision and damage insurance covers your car and others if
the accident is your fault, and personal accident insurance covers you
and anyone in your car. Read the fine print on the back of your rental
agreement and note that insurance may be invalid if you have an acci-
dent while driving on an unpaved road.
Personally, we think that Los Cabos is the only destination that is really
enjoyed best if you have a car to get around. For all other beach destina-
tions, we prefer to use taxis, which are reasonably priced except in Los
Cabos.
Finding the best car-rental deal
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions can save you hundreds of dollars. For exam-
ple, weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. Ask whether the
rate is the same for pickup Friday morning as it is for Thursday night. If
you’re keeping the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper
than the daily rate. Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if 
you don’t return the car to the same renting location; others, notably
National, don’t. Ask whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at
the airport or a location in town. Don’t forget to mention membership in
AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, and trade unions. These member-
ships usually entitle you to discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 per-
cent. Ask your travel agent to check any and all these rates. And most
car rentals are worth at least 500 miles on your frequent-flier account!
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can 
make comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier. All the major
booking Web sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia
(www.expedia.com), Yahoo Travel (www.travel.yahoo.com), and
Cheap Tickets (www.cheaptickets.com), for example — have search
engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just enter the size of
the car you want, the pickup and return dates, and the city where you
want to rent, and the server returns a price. You can even make the
reservation through these sites.
In addition to the standard coverage, car-rental companies also offer
additional liability insurance (if you harm others in an accident), per-
sonal accident insurance (if you harm yourself or your passengers), and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
98

personal effects insurance (if your luggage is stolen from your car). If
you have insurance on your car at home, you’re probably covered for
most of these unlikelihoods. If your own insurance doesn’t cover you for
rentals or if you don’t have auto insurance, you should consider the
additional coverage. But weigh the likelihood of getting into an accident
or losing your luggage against the cost of these insurance options (as
much as $20 per day combined), which can significantly add to the price
of your rental.
Some companies offer refueling packages, in which you pay for an entire
tank of gas upfront. The price is usually fairly competitive with local gas
prices, but you don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you
reject this option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to
return the car with a full tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a gallon for any
shortfall. If a stop at a gas station on the way to the airport will make
you miss your plane, by all means take advantage of the fuel purchase
option. Otherwise, skip it.
Remembering safety comes first
If you decide to rent a car and drive in Mexico, you need to keep a few
things in mind:
 Most Mexican roads are not up to U.S. standards of smoothness,
hardness, width of curve, grade of hill, or safety markings. The
roads in and around Cancún are a notable exception, but elsewhere
in the Yucatán, this observation generally holds true.
 Driving at night is dangerous — the roads aren’t good, and they’re
rarely lit; trucks, carts, pedestrians, and bicycles usually have no
lights; and you can hit potholes, animals, rocks, dead ends, or
uncrossable bridges without warning.
 Never turn left by stopping in the middle of a highway with your
left signal on. Instead, pull off the highway onto the right shoulder,
wait for traffic to clear, and then proceed across the road.
 Credit cards are generally not accepted for gas purchases.
 Places called vulcanizadora or llantera repair flat tires. Such places
are commonly open 24 hours a day on the most-traveled highways.
Even if the place looks empty, chances are you’ll find someone who
can help you fix a flat.
 When possible, many Mexicans drive away from minor accidents, or
try to make an immediate settlement, to avoid involving the police.
 If the police arrive while the involved persons are still at the scene,
everyone may be locked up until responsibility is determined and
damages are settled. If you were in a rental car, notify the rental
company immediately and ask how to contact the nearest adjuster.
(You did buy insurance with the rental, right?)
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 99

Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes
for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens of
other countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and
Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Mexico, USACell and Telcel
are the predominant mobile carriers, and both use GSM. 
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across civilized areas on much
of the globe, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless operator
and ask for “international roaming” to be activated on your account.
Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to $1.50.
That’s why it’s important to buy an “unlocked” world phone from the
get-go. Many cellphone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you
from using any other removable computer memory phone chip card
(called a SIM card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked
phone allows you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local
retailer) in your destination country. (Show your phone to the salesper-
son; not all phones work on all networks.) You’ll get a local phone
number — and much, much lower calling rates. Getting an already
locked phone unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can be
done; just call your cellular operator and say you’ll be going abroad for
several months and want to use the phone with a local provider. 
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. (Even world phone owners
will have to rent new phones if they’re traveling to non-GSM regions,
such as Japan or Korea.) While you can rent a phone from any number
of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental agencies,
we suggest renting the phone before you leave home. That way you can
give loved ones and business associates your new number, make sure
the phone works, and take the phone wherever you go — especially
helpful for overseas trips through several countries, where local phone-
rental agencies often bill in local currency and may not let you take the
phone to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus air-
time fees of at least a dollar a minute. The bottom line: Shop around.
Phone rentals in Mexico are still rare, so it’s best to rent before your
arrival. One option is to purchase an inexpensive phone that takes pre-
paid cards, which you can purchase at any Telcel service provider in
Mexico, for just the amount of service you feel you’ll need during your
trip.
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626;
www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-
5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll tell you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
100

what wireless products you need. InTouch will also, for free, advise you on
whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-
7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to http://intouchglobal.
com/travel.htm.
Accessing the Internet Away from Home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem — gives
you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can
still access your e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Within Mexico’s popular tourism destinations, cybercafes are very
common, catering to traveler’s increasing need — or desire — to stay
connected while away. In each of the different locations in Mexico’s
Beach Resorts For Dummies, we list several recommended cybercafes,
along with rates and hours.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates, as well as wireless Internet access, provided through the
Telcel/Prodigy system. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping
malls, hotel lobbies, and tourist information offices around the world,
give you basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than
cybercafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high price mean they
should be avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner cable).
The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried about hack-
ers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to access the
GoToMyPC system.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 101

If you are bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer
access to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more
and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless “hot
spots” from where you can get high-speed connection without cable
wires, networking hardware, or a phone line. You can get Wi-Fi connec-
tion one of several ways. Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in
Wi-Fi capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners
have their own networking technology, Apple AirPort. For those with
older computers, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be plugged
into your laptop. You sign up for wireless access service much as you do
cellphone service, through a plan offered by one of several commercial
companies that have made wireless service available in airports, hotel
lobbies, and coffee shops, primarily in the U.S. (followed by the U.K. and
Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up
wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops nation-
wide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com)
have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass
providers also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby
setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to
use the hotel’s network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby.
The companies’ pricing policies can be Byzantine, with a variety of
monthly, per-connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay
around $30 a month for limited access — and as more and more compa-
nies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more
competitive. 
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities around
the world. To locate these free hot spots, go to www.personaltelco.
net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a few
thousand hotels in the U.S. and Europe now offer free high-speed
Internet access using an Ethernet network cable. You can bring your
own cables, but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in
advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major Internet Service Providers (ISP) have local access
numbers around the world, allowing you to go online by simply placing
a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask
how you can use your current account away from home, and how much
it will cost. If you’re traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass net-
work has dial-up numbers in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have
to sign up with an iPass provider, who will then tell you how to set up
your computer for your destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to
www.ipass.com. One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or
920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or

find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests. As Mexico shares
the same electric current as the U.S., you’ll find you won’t need any spe-
cial adaptors or equipment other than what you’d be using at home.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airlines’ Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card. Print out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to
the security checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re check-
ing bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat, you will be able to do so
using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the
kiosk system, but always call your airline to make sure these alternatives
are available. Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines,
although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — but
that security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup. Bring
food in your carry-on rather than checking it, as explosive-detection
machines used on checked luggage have been known to mistake food
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 103

(especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the U.S.
are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item” such as a purse,
briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things
into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a
personal item. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has
issued a list of restricted items; check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/
public/index.jsp) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow screen-
ers to open and re-lock a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary.
Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops and
Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com).
These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors
with a special code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.
travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved
locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to
hand-search your luggage.
Packing for Mexico’s Beaches
Start packing by taking out everything you think you need and laying it
out on the bed. Then get rid of half of it.
It’s not that the airlines won’t let you take it all — they will, with some
limits — but why would you want to get a hernia from lugging half your
house around with you? Suitcase straps can be particularly painful with
sunburned shoulders.
Unless you’re attending a board meeting, a funeral, or one of the city’s
finest restaurants, you probably don’t need a suit or a fancy dress in
Mexico. Even the nicest restaurants tend to be casual when it comes to
dress, especially for men. Women, on the other hand, tend to enjoy
those sexy resort dresses, and they’re definitely appropriate in any of
the resorts covered in this book. But when it comes to essentials, you
get more use out of a pair of jeans or khakis and a comfortable sweater.
Electricity runs on the same current in Mexico as in the United States
and Canada, so feel free to bring a hair dryer, personal stereo, or what-
ever else you’d like to plug in. Don’t bother to bring a travel iron — most
hotels offer irons and ironing boards, or they offer the service at a very
reasonable rate.
When choosing your suitcase, think about the kind of traveling you’re
doing. If you’ll be walking with your luggage on hard floors, a bag with
wheels makes sense. If you’ll be carrying your luggage over uneven roads
or up and down stairs, wheels don’t help much. A fold-over garment bag
helps keep dressy clothes wrinkle-free, but it can be a nuisance if you’ll
be packing and unpacking a lot. Hard-sided luggage protects breakable
items better, but it weighs more than soft-sided bags.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Mexico’s Beach Resorts 
104

When packing, start with the biggest, hardest items (usually shoes) and
then fit smaller items in and around them. Pack breakable items in
between several layers of clothes or keep them in your carry-on bag. Put
things that could leak, like shampoos or suntan lotions, in resealable
plastic bags. Lock your suitcase with a TSA-approved lock (available at
most luggage stores if your bag doesn’t already have one) and put a dis-
tinctive identification tag on the outside so that your bag is easy to spot
on the carousel.
Stricter security measures now dictate that each passenger is only
allowed to bring one carry-on bag and one personal item (a purse, back-
pack, or briefcase) on the plane, and the items you do bring onboard are
subject to strict size limitations. Both must fit in the overhead compart-
ment or under the seat in front of you.
Among the items you might consider carrying on are a book; any break-
able items you don’t want to put in your suitcase; a personal stereo with
headphones; a snack (in the likely event you don’t like the airline food);
a bottle of water; any vital documents you don’t want to lose in your lug-
gage (your return ticket, passport, wallet, and so on); and some empty
space for the sweater or jacket that you won’t be wearing while you’re
waiting for your luggage in an overheated terminal. You should also
carry aboard any prescription medications, your glasses or spare con-
tact lenses, and your camera. We always carry a change of clothes
(shorts, T-shirt, and swimsuit) — just in case our checked baggage is
lost. If the airline loses your luggage, you’re likely to have it again within
24 hours, but having these essentials allows you to jump right into vaca-
tion fun anyway.
Here’s a quick checklist of items you don’t want to forget:
 At least two swimsuits
 Sunglasses
 Comfortable walking shoes
 Sandals
 Hat or cap
 Sunscreen
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 105
Tips on what to wear to church
Whenever you visit a church in Mexico, no matter how casual the town is or how close
the church is to the ocean, you should never enter wearing just a swimsuit or a pareo.
Women should wear something other than short shorts and halter tops. Men should
always wear some sort of shirt, even if it’s just a tank top.

 Driver’s license (if you plan to rent a car)
 Scuba certification (if you plan to dive)
 Casual slacks other than jeans (for men, especially if you plan on
hitting the trendiest discos, some of which don’t allow shorts 
or jeans)
 A pareo (sarong) that can double as a long or short skirt, or a wrap
(for women)

Cancún

In this part . . . 
T
he most popular of Mexico’s beach resorts, Cancún 
perfectly showcases the country’s breathtaking natural
beauty and the depth of its thousand-year-old history. Cancún
is both the peak of Caribbean splendor and a modern mega-
resort. It boasts translucent turquoise waters, powdery white-
sand beaches, and a wide array of nearby shopping, dining,
and nightlife choices, in addition to a ton of other activities.
Most accommodations are offered at exceptional value, and
Cancún is easily accessible by air.
Many travelers who feel apprehensive about visiting foreign
soil feel completely at home and at ease here: Most people
speak English, most stores and vendors accept U.S. dollars,
roads are well paved, and lawns are manicured. A lot of the
shopping and dining takes place in malls, and you’ll swear
that some hotels seem larger than a small town. Simply
stated, Cancún is the reason why most people travel to
Mexico. The following chapters introduce you to this
Caribbean-coast jewel and include plenty of tips for making
the most of your stay on this nonstop island.

Chapter 10
The Lowdown on Cancún’s
Hotel Scene
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Sizing up the hotel locations
 Evaluating Cancún’s top hotel choices
I
n 1974, a team of Mexican-government computer analysts selected
Cancún as an area for tourism development because of its ideal com-
bination of features to attract travelers — and they were right on the
money. Cancún is actually an island: a 23km-long (14-mile) sliver of land
shaped roughly like the number 7. Two bridges, spanning the expansive
Nichupté Lagoon, connect Cancún to the mainland. (Cancún means
“golden snake” in the Mayan language.)
With more than 28,000 hotel rooms in the area to choose from, Cancún
has something for every taste and every budget. In this chapter, I review
the two main areas — Isla Cancún (Cancún Island) and Ciudad Cancún
(Cancún City), located inland, to the west of the island.
On October 21, 2005, Hurricane Wilma roared ashore with winds reach-
ing 150mph, and then stalled over Cancún for nearly 40 hours. It toppled
trees, demolished homes, and damaged the resort’s hotels, restaurants,
and attractions. However, relief came quickly, as Mexico’s government
understands the importance of Cancún as the country’s most popular
playground. The majority of damaged hotels took the opportunity to
upgrade their facilities and redecorate their rooms, which should ulti-
mately lead to a new and improved Cancún. However, at press time,
many of these were still under construction, so personal reviews of all
accommodations were not possible, and details of renovations were not
available in complete detail. There have been some reportings of selected
rooms retaining a strong smell of mildew, so please, let us know of your
experiences or any comments you may have. Also, the noise of construc-
tion and piles of debris were omnipresent as this book went to press, but
should be but a memory by the fall of 2006.

Cancún is definitely the destination to try out an air-hotel package.
Although the rack rates at Cancún’s hotels are among the highest in
Mexico, the package deals are among the best because of the large
number of charter companies operating here. (See Chapter 6 for more
information on package deals, as well as some recommendations.) I
should also point out that if you do arrive without a hotel reservation —
I don’t recommend it during peak weeks surrounding the Christmas and
Easter holidays — you’re likely to be able to bargain your way into a
great rate.
Choosing a Location
Island hotels are stacked along the beach like dominoes; almost all offer
clean, modern facilities, and most having undergone extensive renova-
tions post–Hurricane Wilma. Extravagance reigns in the more recently
built hotels, many of which are awash in a sea of marble and glass.
However, some hotels, although they’re exclusive, display a more
relaxed attitude.
Following Hurricane Wilma’s devastation, the news item that received 
the most coverage was the destruction of Cancún’s famed white-sand
beaches, certainly key to selecting a hotel location for many. Immediately
following the storm, literally all of the sand was washed away from the
northern border of Isla Cancún, and Punta Cancún. However, thanks in
part to Mother Nature, and in part to a more than $20-million effort by
Mexico’s government to pump the dislocated sand back to the beach, by
fall 2006 this should no longer be an issue. At press time (June 2006) a
large beach had already developed along Punta Cancún, in front of the
Forum Plaza, with sufficient sand in place along the north shore. The
southern beaches of Isla Cancún actually benefited from the storm, and
those areas enjoyed especially wide beachfronts.
The water is placid on the island’s upper end facing Bahía de Mujeres,
while beaches lining the long side of the island facing the Caribbean are
subject to choppier water and crashing waves on windy days. Be aware
that the farther south you go on the island, the longer it takes (20–30 min.
in traffic) to get back to the “action spots,” which are primarily located
between the Plaza Flamingo and Punta Cancún on the island — close to
the point that connects the two parts of the 7 — and along Avenida
Tulum on the mainland.
Almost all major hotel chains are represented along Isla Cancún, also
known as the Hotel Zone, so my selections can be viewed as a represen-
tative summary, with a select number of notable places to stay. The real-
ity is that Cancún is so popular as a package destination from the United
States that prices and special deals are often the deciding factor for
vacationers traveling here.
Part III: Cancún 
110

Ciudad Cancún is the more authentic Mexican town of the two loca-
tions, where the hotels’ employees live and where people not on vaca-
tion conduct their day-to-day business. The area offers independently
owned, smaller, and much less expensive stays — the difference in
prices between these accommodations and their island counterparts 
is truly remarkable. And many hotels in Ciudad Cancún offer a shuttle
service to sister properties in Isla Cancún, meaning you can still access
the beach, for a fraction of the price, in return for a little extra travel
time. Many of the best restaurants are located here, especially if you’re
looking for a meal in a type of restaurant that differs from those you can
find back home. You can also get the best value for your meal budget in
Ciudad Cancún.
Cancún’s Best Accommodations
Each hotel listing includes specific rack rates for two people spending
one night in a standard room, double occupancy during high season
(Christmas to Easter), unless otherwise indicated. Rack rates simply
mean published rates and tend to be the highest rate paid — you can do
better, especially if you’re purchasing a package that includes airfare
(see Chapter 7 for tips on avoiding paying rack rates). The rack rate
prices quoted here include the 12 percent room tax — note that this is 5
percent lower than in most other resorts in Mexico, where the standard
tax is 17 percent. Please refer to the Introduction of this book for an
explanation of the price categories.
Hotels often double the normal rates during Christmas and Easter
weeks, but low-season rates can be anywhere from 20 percent to 60 per-
cent below high-season rates. Some rates may seem much higher than
others, but many of these higher rates are all-inclusive — meaning that
your meals and beverages are included in the price of your stay. All tips,
taxes, and most activities and entertainment are also included in all-
inclusive rates.
All hotels listed here have air-conditioning, unless otherwise indicated.

Antillano

Ciudad Cancún
A quiet and very clean choice, the Antillano is close to the Ciudad Cancún
bus terminal. Rooms overlook the main downtown street (Av. Tulum), the
side streets, or the interior lawn and pool. The latter choice is the most
desirable because these rooms are the quietest. Each room has coordi-
nated furnishings, one or two double beds, a sink area separate from the
bathroom, and red-tile floors. A bonus: This inexpensive hotel provides
guests the use of its beach club on the island. To find Antillano from
Avenida Tulum, walk west on Claveles a half block; it’s opposite the restau-
rant Rosa Mexicano. Parking is on the street.

Blue Bay Getaway & Spa Cancún 
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
Blue Bay is a spirited yet relaxing all-inclusive resort for adults only — no
kids under 16 are allowed — that’s favored by young adults in particular.
One of its best features is its prime location — right at the northern end
of the Hotel Zone, close to the major shopping plazas, restaurants, and
nightlife, with a beach with calm waters for swimming. Surrounded by
acres of tropical gardens, the comfortable, clean, and modern guest rooms
are located in two sections: the central building, where rooms are deco-
rated in rustic wood, and the remaining nine buildings, which feature
rooms in a colorful Mexican décor. The main lobby, administrative offices,
restaurants, and the Las Margaritas bar are all located in the central build-
ing, meaning you’re close to all the action — and more noise — if your
room is in this section. Included are all your meals, served at any of the
four restaurants, and libations, which you can find in the five bars. During
the evenings, guests may enjoy a variety of theme-night dinners, nightly
shows, and live entertainment in an outdoor theater with capacity for 150
guests. Activities and facilities include three swimming pools (with seven
outdoor whirlpools), a tennis court, an exercise room, windsurfing, kayaks,
catamarans, boogie boards, complimentary snorkeling and scuba lessons,
and a marina. Safes are available for an extra charge, as are dry-cleaning
and laundry service. Note that clothing is optional on the beaches of this
Blue Bay resort.

looking for a little familiarity of home, this is a great choice because it feels
like a slice of the United States transported to a stunning stretch of
Caribbean beach. Guest rooms have contemporary furnishings, tiled floors,
and ceiling fans; most have balconies. All suites occupy corners and have
enormous terraces, ocean views, and TVs in both the living room and the
bedroom. The CasaMagna Marriott offers five on-site restaurants, plus a
lobby bar with live music. Alongside the meandering oceanfront pool are
two lighted tennis courts. The hotel caters to family travelers with specially
priced packages (up to two children can stay free with parents) and the
Club Amigos supervised children’s program. Note that the hotel was under-
going extensive renovations, post-Wilma, at press time, so some of the
above details could be subject to change. A more deluxe offering from

structure, slated to open by late fall 2006. A member of the Fiesta
Americana chain, the entire hotel seems to mirror the predominant colors
of Cancún — turquoise and white — in a sublimely chic manner. This hotel
was built for sophisticated travelers who appreciate hip style and look for
the cutting edge in places to stay. Aqua aims to stimulate your five senses,
and upon arrival — under a crystal cube fountain—you’re offered a fusion
tea, and a blend of relaxing and stimulating aromatherapy. The oasis of
eight oceanfront pools is surrounded by chaises, queen-size recliners, and
private cabanas, as well as a beachfront watersports center. All rooms and
common areas emphasize the views to the pool and ocean beyond. Rooms
are generous in size, and all face the ocean and have balconies, plus ameni-
ties that include plasma TVs, minibars, and high-speed Internet access.
Very large bathrooms feature a soaking tub and organic bath products,
plus hair dryers. Guests can tailor their turndown service by selecting
from a pillow menu and choice of aromatherapy oils and candles.
Miniature Zen gardens or a fishbowl add unique touches to room décor.
Suites offer extras like Bose surround-sound systems. Twenty-nine rooms
are “Grand Club,” which include continental breakfast and a club room
with butler service, snacks, bar service, and private check-in. The spa is
among the hotel’s most notable attractions, with 12 treatment rooms offer-
ing a blend of Eastern, pre-Hispanic, and Western treatments. Outdoor
Pilates, tai chi, and yoga classes are offered daily, and massage cabanas
are also available on the beach. Another hallmark of this hotel is its col-
lection of four restaurants, chief among them SIETE, under the direction
of premier Mexican chef and cookbook author Patricia Quintana, featur-
ing her sophisticated take on traditional Mexican cuisine. Chef Michelle
Bernstein, formerly a rising culinary star in Miami, presides over MB, serv-
ing healthful comfort food. There are also an Italian restaurant, deli,
lounge, and room service. After dark, the hotel shifts moods, with fire pits,
torch lights, and ambient music.

Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach 
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
A spectacularly grand hotel, the Fiesta Americana has one of the best loca-
tions in Cancún with its 300m (1,000 ft.) of prime beachfront and proximity
to the main shopping and entertainment centers — perfect for the traveler
looking to be at the heart of all that Cancún has to offer. The great Punta
Cancún location (opposite the Cancún Center) has the advantage of facing
the beach to the north, meaning that the surf is calm and perfect for swim-
ming. When it comes to the hotel itself, the operative word is big — every-
thing at the Fiesta Americana seems oversize, from the lobby to the rooms.
Service is gracious, if cool, as the hotel aims for a more sophisticated ambi-
ence. The finishings of elegant dark-green granite and an abundance of
marble extend from the lobby to the large guest rooms, all of which have
Part III: Cancún

balconies facing the ocean. Two swimming pools border the beach, includ-
ing a 198m-long (660-ft.) free-form swimming pool with swim-up bars and a
casual poolside snack bar, plus a full watersports equipment rental serv-
ice on the beach. Two additional restaurants, plus five bars, are inside the
hotel, along with a mini-shopping center. If tennis is your game, this hotel
has the best facilities in Cancún; three indoor tennis courts with stadium
seating are part of an extensive fitness center and spa.

Flamingo Cancún
$$$–$$$$
Isla Cancún
The Flamingo seems to have been inspired by the dramatic, slope-sided
architecture of the Dreams Cancún, but the Flamingo is considerably smaller
and less expensive. And with two pools, it’s a friendly, accommodating
choice for families. The clean, comfortable, and modern guest rooms — all
with balconies — border a courtyard facing the interior swimming pool and
palapa pool bar. A second pool with a sun deck overlooks the ocean. You
can choose an all-inclusive plan, which includes meals. The Flamingo is in
the heart of the island hotel district, opposite the Flamingo Shopping Center
and close to other hotels, shopping centers, and restaurants.

Hacienda Cancún
$
Ciudad Cancún
An extremely pleasing little hotel — and a great value — Hacienda Cancún
is perfect for travelers on a budget. The facade has been remodeled to look
like a hacienda, and rooms continue the theme, with their rustic-style
Mexican furnishings. Guest rooms are clean and very comfortable; all have
two double beds and windows (but no views). There’s a nice, small pool
and cafe under a shaded palapa in the back. To find it from Avenida
Yaxchilán, turn west on Sunyaxchen; it’s on your right. Parking is on the
street.

Hilton Cancún Beach & Golf Resort
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
The Hilton in Cancún is especially perfect for anyone whose motto is “the
bigger the better.” Grand, expansive, and fully equipped, this is a true
Chapter 10: The Lowdown on Cancún’s Hotel Scene 117

resort in every sense of the word. The Hilton Cancún (formerly the 1994-
vintage Caesar Park Resort) is situated on 100 hectares (250 acres) of
prime Cancún beachfront property with its own 18-hole, par-72 golf course
across the street and a location that gives every room an ocean view
(some have both ocean and lagoon views). Like the sprawling resort,
rooms are grandly spacious and immaculately decorated. Marble floors
and bathrooms throughout are softened with area rugs and pale furnish-
ings. The more elegant Villa rooms are set off from the main hotel in two-
and three-story buildings (no elevators) and have their own check-in and
concierge service, plus nightly complimentary cocktails. The hotel is espe-
cially appealing to golfers because it’s one of only two hotels in Cancún
with an on-site course. (The other is the Meliá, which has an 18-hole exec-
utive course.) The seven interconnected pools with a swim-up bar, two
lighted tennis courts, a large, fully equipped gym, and a beachfront water-
sports center make the Hilton Cancún a good choice for those looking for
an action-packed stay. Their Kids Club program is one of the best on the
island, making it great for families. Post–Hurricane Wilma, all rooms
received an update, and common areas were renovated.

Hotel Margaritas
$$
Ciudad Cancún
Located in downtown Cancún, this four-story hotel (with elevator) is com-
fortable and unpretentious, offering one of the best values in Cancún.
Rooms have white-tile floors and a small balcony, and they’re exception-
ally clean and bright and pleasantly decorated. The attractive pool is sur-
rounded by lounge chairs and has a wading section for children. The hotel
offers complimentary safes at the front desk and more services than most
budget hotels, including babysitting.

Le Méridien Cancún Resort & Spa
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
Of all the luxury properties in Cancún, Le Méridien is the most inviting,
with a polished yet welcoming sense of personal service. Although other
hotels tend to overdo a sense of formality in striving to justify their prices,
Le Méridien has an elegantly casual style that makes you comfortable
enough to relax thoroughly. From the intimate lobby and reception area
to the most outstanding concierge service in Cancún, guests feel immedi-
ately pampered upon arrival. The hotel itself is smaller than others and
feels more like an upscale boutique hotel than an immense resort — a wel-
come relief to those overstressed by activity at home. The décor through-
out the rooms and common areas is one of understated good taste — both
Part III: Cancún 
118

classy and comforting, not overdone. Rooms are generous in size, and
most have small balconies overlooking the pool with an ocean view.
There’s a very large marble bathroom with a separate tub and a glassed-
in shower. The hotel attracts many Europeans and younger, sophisticated
travelers, and is ideal for a second honeymoon or romantic break.
Certainly, a highlight of — or even a reason for — staying here is time spent
at the Spa del Mar, one of Mexico’s finest and most complete European
spa facilities, featuring two levels and more than 1,394 sq. m (15,000 sq.
ft.) of services dedicated to your body and soul. A complete fitness center
with extensive cardio and weight machines is on the upper level. The spa
is located below and is comprised of a healthy snack bar, a full-service
salon, and 14 treatment rooms, as well as separate men’s and women’s
steam rooms, saunas, whirlpools, cold plunge pools, inhalation rooms,
tranquillity rooms, lockers, and changing areas.
The health club may become a necessity if you fully enjoy the gourmet
restaurant, Aioli, with its specialties based on Mediterranean and
Provençal cuisines (check out Chapter 12 for a detailed review of this
restaurant). The menu is simply delicious — not pretentious. Adjoining
the spa is a large swimming pool that cascades down three levels. Above
the spa is a tennis center with two championship tennis courts with lights.
Watersports equipment is available for rent on the beach. There’s also a
supervised children’s program with its own Penguin Clubhouse, play
equipment, and a wading pool.

Oasis Cancún
$$$–$$$$
Isla Cancún
From the street, the Oasis may not be much to look at, but the location is
ideal because it’s set on Cancún’s best beach for safe swimming. And it’s
close to all the shops and restaurants clustered near Punta Cancún and
the convention center. The ocean side has a small but pretty patio garden
and pool. You can choose between rooms with either a lagoon or ocean
view. The rooms are large and undistinguished in décor, but they’re com-
fortable. They feature marble floors and either two double beds or a king-
size bed. Several studios with kitchenettes are also available upon request.
In addition to a restaurant and three bars, you also can use two lighted
tennis courts, watersports equipment rental, and a small marina with its
own fishing fleet.

Parador
$
Ciudad Cancún
The convenient location and rock-bottom prices make this otherwise non-
descript hotel among the most popular downtown hotels. Guest rooms,
located on one of three floors, are arranged around two long, narrow garden
courtyards leading back to a small pool (with an even smaller, separate chil-
dren’s pool) and grassy sunning area. The rooms are contemporary and
basic, each with two double beds and a shower. The hotel is next to Pop’s
restaurant, almost at the corner of Uxmal. Street parking is limited.

Presidente InterContinental Cancún
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
On the island’s best beach facing the placid Bahía de Mujeres, the
Presidente’s location is reason enough to stay here, and it’s just a two-
minute walk to Cancún’s public Pok-Ta-Pok Golf Club. Cool and spacious,
the Presidente sports a postmodern design with lavish marble and wicker
accents and a strong use of color. Guests have a choice of two double beds
or one king-size bed. All rooms have tastefully simple white cedar accents,
minibars, and complimentary Internet access. The expansive pool area
has a pyramid-shaped waterfall and is surrounded by cushioned lounge
chairs and five Jacuzzis. In addition to lighted tennis courts and a small
fitness center, the marina has watersports equipment rentals. Coming from
Ciudad Cancún, the Presidente is on the left side of the street before you
get to Punta Cancún. With its ambience, the Presidente is an ideal choice
for a romantic getaway or for couples who enjoy indulging in golf, tennis,
or even shopping. Extensive renovations and room upgrades occurred
post–Hurricane Wilma.

Radisson Hacienda

Ciudad Cancún
The nicest hotel in downtown Cancún, the Radisson Hacienda is also one
of the area’s best values. It offers all the expected comforts of a known
hotel chain, yet in an atmosphere of Mexican hospitality. Resembling a
Mexican hacienda, rooms are set off from a large rotunda-style lobby, lush
gardens, and a pleasant pool area. All rooms have brightly colored fabric
accents; a small sitting area and balcony; and views of the garden, the pool,
or the street. Bathrooms have a combination tub and shower. For the
price, the extra in-room amenities of a coffeemaker, hair dryer, and iron

are nice pluses. In addition to two restaurants, there’s also a generally
lively lobby bar, as well as tennis courts and a small gym. Guests of the
Radisson Hacienda enjoy a complimentary shuttle service to the beach on
Isla Cancún or to the Pok-Ta-Pok Golf Course. The hotel is located right
behind the state government building and within walking distance of
downtown Cancún dining and shopping.

Refugio del Pirata Morgan
$
Ciudad Cancún
Although not actually in the town of Cancún, but on the highway leading
north from Cancún to Punta Sam, this is the place for those who want a
true encounter with nature. Located on a wide, virgin stretch of beach
(which expanded even more post-Wilma), away from the crowd of hotels
and nightlife, this “refuge” is exactly that: no phones, no television, just
blissful peace and quiet. There are 10 simple cabañas, with both beds and
hammocks, each named for the predominant color of the décor. A small
restaurant offers a basic selection of dining choices featuring fresh fish —
otherwise, the nearest restaurant is 2km (11⁄4 miles) away.

Rey del Caribe Hotel
$–$$
Ciudad Cancún
This hotel, located in the center of downtown, is a unique oasis — a 100
percent ecological hotel, where every detail has been thought out to
achieve the goal of living in an organic and environmentally friendly
manner. The whole atmosphere of the place is one of warmth, which
derives from the on-site owners, who, caring as much as they do for
Mother Earth, extend this sentiment to guests as well. You easily forget
you’re in the midst of downtown Cancún in the tropical jungle setting, with
blooming orchids and other flowering plants. Surrounding gardens and the
pool and hot tub area are populated with statues of Maya deities — it’s a
lovely, tranquil setting. There’s a daily-changing schedule of yoga, tai chi,
and meditation sessions, as well as special classes on astrology, tarot, and
other subjects. Rooms are large and sunny, with your choice of one king
or two full-size beds, a kitchenette, and terrace. The detail of ecological
sensitivity is truly impressive, ranging from the use of collected rainwater
to waste composting. Recycling is encouraged and solar power used wher-
ever possible.

Ritz-Carlton Cancún (scheduled to reopen Sept 5, 2006)
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
The grand-scale Ritz-Carlton is a fountain of formality in this casual beach
resort, perfect for someone who wants a Palm Beach–style experience in
Mexico. The décor — in both public areas as well as guest rooms — is
sumptuous and formal with thick carpets, elaborate chandeliers, and fresh
flowers throughout. The hotel fronts a 360m (1,200-ft.) white-sand beach,
and all rooms overlook the ocean, pool (heated during winter months),
and tropical gardens. In all rooms, marble bathrooms have telephones,
separate tubs and showers, and lighted makeup mirrors. Ritz-Carlton Club
floors offer guests five mini-meals a day, private butler service, and
Hermès bath products. The Club Grill, a fashionable English pub, is one
of the best restaurants in the city, and the Lobby Lounge is the original
home of proper tequila tastings, featuring one of the world’s most exten-
sive menus of fine tequilas, as well as Cuban cigars. I love their white-
draped cabañas for two on the beach! There’s a very good fitness center
and the luxury Kayantá Spa offers an excellent selection of Maya and
Mexican-inspired treatments and massages. There are also three lighted
tennis courts. The Ritz Kids program has supervised activities for chil-
dren, and babysitting services are also available. The hotel has won count-
less recognitions and accolades for service. Special packages for golfing,
spa, and weekend getaways are worth exploring. The hotel took the oppor-
tunity to make extensive renovations post–Hurricane Wilma.

Riu Palace Las Americas

Isla Cancún
The all-inclusive Riu Palace is part of a family of Riu resorts in Cancún
known for their grand, opulent style. This one is the smallest of the three
in Cancún, and the most elegant, steeped in pearl-white Greco style, and
my choice for a high-end all-inclusive vacation in Cancún. The location is
prime—near the central shopping, dining, and nightlife centers, just five
minutes walking to the Cancún Center. All rooms are spacious junior suites
with ocean or lagoon views, a separate seating area, and a balcony or ter-
race, and come with premium extras such as bathrobes and hair dryers.
Eight also feature a Jacuzzi. Two central pools overlook the ocean and a
wide stretch of beach, with one heated during winter months. The hotel
offers guests virtually 24 hours of all-inclusive snacks, meals, and bever-
ages, as well as six restaurants and five bars. A nicely equipped health club

Westin Resort & Spa Cancún
$$$$$
Isla Cancún
A stunning hotel, the Westin Resort & Spa is great for anyone wanting the
beauty of Cancún’s beaches and a little distance between them and the
more boisterous, flashy parts of Cancún’s hotel strip. The strikingly aus-
tere but grand architecture of the Westin Regina is the stamp of leading
Latin American architect Ricardo Legorreta. A series of five swimming
pools front the beach, and the Westin offers two lighted tennis courts and
a small fitness center with limited spa services. The hotel is divided into
two sections: the main building and the more exclusive six-story, hot-pink
tower section. Standard rooms are unusually large and beautifully fur-
nished with cool, contemporary furniture. The rooms on the sixth floor
have balconies, and first-floor rooms have terraces. Rooms in the tower
all have ocean or lagoon views and extensive use of marble, furniture with
Olinalá lacquer accents, Berber-carpet area rugs, oak tables and chairs,
and terraces with lounge chairs. It’s important to note that this hotel is a
15- to 20-minute ride from the lively strip that lies between the Plaza
Flamingo and Punta Cancún, so it’s a better choice for those who want to
relish a little more seclusion than Cancún typically offers. However, you
can easily join the action when you’re so inclined — buses stop in front
and taxis are readily available. The hotel took the opportunity of Hurricane
Wilma damage for a complete renovation.

Chapter 11
Settling into Cancún
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect when you arrive
 Finding your way around
 Discovering helpful information and resources
Yes, you need a passport or other appropriate credentials (see
Chapter 9) to enter Cancún, but after that, you couldn’t be in a more
American-friendly foreign destination if you tried. If this is your first trip
to Mexico — or to a foreign country — you’ll probably find that the ensu-
ing culture shock is practically nonexistent. But there are still a few
details that you’ll be more comfortable knowing before you arrive. In this
chapter, I take you from the plane, through the airport, and to your hotel,
helping you quickly get your bearings in this easy-to-navigate resort.
Arriving in Cancún
Cancún has one of Mexico’s most modern and busiest airports — and
one that is being renovated once again, in the wake of 2005’s Hurricane
Wilma — which will further improve and expand its services. Still, navi-
gating Cancún’s airport is easy — both international and national flights
are under the same roof. After checking in with immigration, collecting
your bags, and passing through the Customs checkpoint, you’re ready to
enjoy your holiday!
Navigating passport control and Customs
Immigration check-in can be a lengthy wait, depending on the number of
planes arriving at the same time, but is a generally easy and unremark-
able process in which officials ask you to show your passport and com-
plete a tourist card, known as the FMT (check out Chapter 9 for more
information).
Your FMT is an important document, so take good care of it. You’re 
supposed to keep the FMT with you at all times because you may be
required to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to

turn the FMT back in upon departure, or you may be unable to leave
without replacing it.
Next up is the baggage claim area. Here, porters stand by to help with
your bags, and they’re well worth the price of the tip — about a dollar 
a bag. After you collect your luggage, you pass through another check-
point. Something that looks like a traffic light awaits you here. You press
a button, and if the light turns green, you’re free to go. If it turns red, you
need to open each of your bags for a quick search. It’s Mexico’s random
search procedure for Customs. If you have an unusually large bag, or an
excessive amount of luggage, you may be searched regardless of the 
traffic-light outcome.
Just past the traffic light, you exit to the street, where you can find trans-
portation to your hotel. Choose between a colectivo (shared minivan)
and a private taxi. If three or more of you are traveling together, you’re
better off with the private cab service. With so many hotels for the col-
lective van to stop at, it can easily take an hour to get to your room, and
believe me, the drivers wait until the vans are packed before departing!
Check out the “Accommodations in Isla Cancún” map in Chapter 10 to
find out where your hotel is relative to the airport.
If you do choose the colectivo service, which consists of air-conditioned
vans, buy your ticket at the booth that’s located to the far right as you
exit baggage claim. You can purchase tickets for private cab service at a
booth inside the airport terminal. Tickets for both the colectivo vans and
the private taxis are based on a fixed rate depending on the distance to
your destination. A taxi ticket is good for up to four passengers.
Getting to your hotel
The airport is on the mainland, close to the southern end of the Cancún
area. It’s about 14km (9 miles) to downtown Ciudad Cancún (Cancún
City), which is located on the mainland. The start of the Zona Hotelera
(Hotel Zone), located on Isla Cancún (Cancún Island), is 10km (61⁄2 miles)
from the airport — about a 20-minute drive east from the airport along
wide, well-paved roads.
Hiring a taxi
Rates for a private taxi from the airport are around $25 to downtown
Cancún or $28 to $45 to the Hotel Zone, depending on your destination.
The colectivos run from Cancún’s international airport into town and the
Hotel Zone and cost about $9 per person. There’s minibus transporta-
tion (for $9.50) from the airport to the Puerto Juárez passenger ferry
that takes you to Isla Mujeres. You can also hire a private taxi for this
trip for about $40.
No colectivo service returns to the airport from Ciudad Cancún or the
Hotel Zone, so you must hire a taxi, but the rate should be much less
than the trip from the airport. The reason? Only federally chartered taxis
Chapter 11: Settling into Cancún 125

may take fares from the airport, but any local taxi may bring passengers
to the airport. Ask for a fare estimate at your hotel, but expect to pay
about half what you were charged to get from the airport to your hotel
(if you originally took a taxi).
Renting a car
Most major car-rental firms have outlets at the airport, so if you’re rent-
ing a car, consider picking it up and dropping it off at the airport to save
on airport-transportation costs. Another way to save money is to arrange
for the rental before you leave home. If you wait until you arrive, the daily
cost of a rental car may be around $65 to $75 for a Volkswagen Beetle.
Major car-rental services include:
 Avis (% 800-331-1212 in the U.S., or 998-886-0221; www.avis.com)
 Budget (% 800-527-0700 in the U.S., or 998-884-6955 downtown
office; www.budget.com)

Looking for more information?
Here’s a list of the best Web sites for additional information about Cancún:
 All About Cancún (www.cancunmx.com)
Before taking off on a vacation, every traveler has a few questions. If Cancún is
your destination, this site is a good place to start. It contains a database of
answers to the most commonly asked questions. Just look for “The Online
Experts” section. The site can be slow, but it has input from lots of recent travel-
ers to the region.
 Cancún Convention and Visitors Bureau (www.cancun.info)
The official site of the Cancún Convention and Visitors Bureau provides excellent
information on events and area attractions. The site’s hotel guide is one of the
most complete and detailed listings I’ve seen, and it has an active message board
of recent visitors to Cancún.
 Cancún.com (www.cancun.com)
Cancún.com is a comprehensive guide that has tons of information about what to
do and see in Cancún. Just remember that advertisers pay to be included and pro-
vide most of the details. Highlights include forums, live chats, property-swaps,
and bulletin boards, plus information on local Internet access, news, and events.
You can even reserve a golf tee time or plan your wedding online.
 Cancún Travel Guide (www.go2cancun.com)
This group specializing in online information about Mexico has put together an
excellent resource for Cancún rentals, hotels, and area attractions. Although only
paying advertisers are listed, you can find most of the major players here.

Although you certainly don’t have to rent a car in Cancún — taxis and
buses are plentiful — this is one destination where having a car may make
sense for a day or two. It can be a convenience, although it’s not likely to
save you bundles on transportation costs, based on the relatively high
prices of car rentals in Cancún. The roads in and around Cancún are 
excellent, and parking is readily available in most of the shopping/
entertainment malls. The main reason for renting a car, however, is the
flexibility that it provides in exploring the surrounding areas — a day trip
down the coast or to nearby sights is definitely recommended. But if
you’re not comfortable driving, you can easily cover this ground on one 
of the many sightseeing tours available.
If you do rent a car, keep any valuables out of plain sight. Although
Cancún’s crime rate is very low, the only real problem tends to be rental-
car break-ins.
Getting Around Cancún
As I discuss a bit in the “Getting to your hotel” section earlier in this
chapter, there are really two Cancúns: Isla Cancún (Cancún Island) and
Ciudad Cancún (Cancún City). The latter, on the mainland, has restau-
rants, shops, and less-expensive hotels, as well as all the other establish-
ments that make local life function — pharmacies, dentists, automotive
shops, banks, travel and airline agencies, car-rental firms, and so on —
which are all located within an approximately nine-square-block area.
The city’s main thoroughfare is Avenida Tulum. Heading south, Avenida
Tulum becomes the highway to the airport, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum.
(It actually runs all the way down to Belize.) Heading north, Avenida
Tulum intersects the highway to Mérida and the road to Puerto Juárez
and the Isla Mujeres ferries.
The famed Zona Hotelera (Hotel Zone, also called the Zona Turística, or
Tourist Zone) stretches out along Isla Cancún, which is a sandy strip of
land 23km (14 miles) long and shaped like a 7. The Playa Linda Bridge, at
the north end of the island, and the Punta Nizuc Bridge, at the southern
end, connect Isla Cancún to the mainland. Between these two bridges
lies Laguna Nichupté. Avenida Cobá from Cancún City becomes Paseo
Kukulkán, the island’s main traffic artery — actually, the only main road
on the island, so getting lost here really takes some effort! To get the
hang of pronouncing it quickly enough, say “koo-cool-can,” as in,
“Cancún is sooo cool!” Cancún’s international airport is located just
inland from the south end of the island.
Chapter 11: Settling into Cancún 127

Ciudad Cancún’s street-numbering system is a holdover from its early
days. Addresses in the city are still expressed by the number of the
building lot and the manzana (block) or supermanzana (group of city
blocks). The city is still relatively compact, and you can easily cover the
downtown commercial section on foot. Streets are named after famous
Maya cities. Chichén Itzá, Tulum, and Uxmal are the names of the boule-
vards in downtown Cancún, as well as nearby archaeological sites.
On the island, addresses are given by their kilometer (Km) numbers on
Paseo Kukulkán or by reference to some well-known location. The point
on the island closest to Ciudad Cancún is Km 1; Km 20 is found at the
very bottom of the 7 at Punta Nizuc, where the Club Med is located.
Taking a taxi
Taxi prices in Cancún are clearly set by zone, although keeping track of
what’s in which zone can take some work. Taxi rates within the Hotel
Zone are a minimum fare of $6 per ride, making it one of the most expen-
sive taxi areas in Mexico.
Taxis operating in the Hotel Zone feel perfectly justified in having a dis-
criminatory pricing structure: Local residents pay about half of what
tourists pay, and guests at higher-priced hotels pay about twice the fare
that guests in budget hotels are charged. You can thank the taxi union
for this bit of fun — they establish the rate schedule. Rates should be
posted outside your hotel; however, if you have a question, all taxi driv-
ers are required to have an official rate card in their taxi, although it’s
generally in Spanish.
Within downtown, the cost is about $1.50 per cab ride (not per person);
within any other zone, it’s $5. Traveling between two zones also costs
$5. If you cross two zones, the cost is $7.50; crossing three zones runs
about $11. Settle on a price in advance, or check at your hotel, where
destinations and prices are generally posted. Trips to the airport from
most zones cost $15. Taxis also have a rate of $18 per hour for travel
around the city and Hotel Zone, but you can generally negotiate this rate
down to $10 to $12. If you want to hire a taxi to take you to Chichén Itzá
or along the Riviera Maya, expect to pay about $30 per hour — many
taxi drivers feel that they’re also providing guide services.
Catching a bus
Bus travel within Cancún continues to improve and is increasingly the
most popular way of getting around for both residents and tourists. Air-
conditioned and rarely crowded, the Hotel Zone buses run 24 hours a
day. You can easily spot the bus stops; look for roadside signs that have
a bus on them. Bus stops are in front of most of the main hotels and
shopping centers. In town, almost everything is within walking distance.
Ruta 1 and Ruta 2 (Hoteles) city buses travel frequently from the main-
land to the beaches along Avenida Tulum (the main street) and all the
way to Punta Nizuc at the far end of the Hotel Zone on Isla Cancún.

American Express
The local office is located in Ciudad Cancún
at Av. Tulum 208 and Agua (% 998-881-4000
or 881-4055), a block past the Plaza México.
The office is open Monday to Friday 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Area Code
The telephone area code is 988.
Baby Sitters
Most of the larger hotels can easily arrange
for baby sitters, but many sitters speak lim-
ited English. Rates range from $4 to $10 per
hour.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Most banks are downtown along Avenida
Tulum and are usually open Monday to
Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and many now have
ATMs for after-hours cash withdrawals. In
the Hotel Zone, you can find banks in the
Plaza Kukulkán and next to the convention
center. There are also many casas de
cambio (exchange houses) in the Hotel
Zone, in the plazas, and near the conven-
tion center. Avoid changing money at the
airport as you arrive, especially at the first
exchange booth you see — its rates are
less favorable than any in town or others
farther inside the airport concourse. In gen-
eral, you can find the best exchange rates
at ATMs, casas de cambio, and hotels.
Business Hours
Most downtown offices maintain traditional
Mexican hours of operation (9 a.m.–2 p.m.
and 4–8 p.m., daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Offices tend to close on Saturday and
Sunday, but shops are open on Saturday, at
least, and increasingly offer limited hours of
operation on Sunday. Malls are generally
open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. or later.
Climate
It’s hot but not overwhelmingly humid. The
rainy season is May through October.
August through October is the hurricane
season, which brings erratic weather.
November through February is generally
sunny but can also be cloudy, windy, some-
what rainy, and even cool, so a sweater and
rain protection is handy.
Chapter 11: Settling into Cancún 129
Ruta 8 buses go to Puerto Juárez/Punta Sam, where you can catch ferries
to Isla Mujeres. The buses stop on the east side of Avenida Tulum. These
buses operate between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily. Beware of private buses
along the same route; they charge far more than the public ones. The
public buses have the fare amount painted on the front; at the time of
publication, the fare was 6.50 pesos (60¢).
Zipping around on a moped
Mopeds are a convenient and popular way to cruise around the con-
gested traffic, but they can be dangerous. Rentals start at $25 for a day,
and the shops require a credit-card voucher as security for the moped.
When you rent a moped, make sure you receive a crash helmet (it’s the
law) and instructions on how to lock the wheels when you park. Read
the fine print on the back of the rental agreement regarding liability for
repairs or replacement in case of accident, theft, or vandalism.

mation office, the Cancún Municipal
Tourism Office (% 998-884-6531 or 884-
3438), is also located in the Cancún Center,
Bulevar Kukulcán Km 9, first floor (% 866-
891-7773 in the U.S. or 998-881-2745; Fax:
998-881-0402); it’s open Monday to Friday 
9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Hotels and their rates are
listed at each office, as are ferry schedules.
For information prior to your arrival in
Cancún, visit the Convention Bureau’s Web
site at www.cancun.info.
Pick up copies of the free monthly Cancún
Tips or the Cancún Tips booklet, which is
published four times a year. Both contain
lots of useful information and great maps. 
Internet Access
C@ncunet (% 998-885-0055 or 840-6099),
located in a kiosk on the second floor of
Plaza Kukulkán (Paseo Kukulkán Km 13),
offers Internet access for $4 per 15 minutes
or $7 per hour from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Maps
One of the best around is the free American
Express map, usually found at the tourist
information offices and the local American
Express office. The publication Cancún Tips
(see “Information”) also has excellent maps
and is generally available through your
hotel concierge.
Newspapers and Magazines
Most hotel gift shops and newsstands carry
English-language magazines and English-
language Mexican newspapers.
Pharmacy
Next to the Hotel Caribe Internacional,
Farmacia Canto (Av. Yaxchilán 36, at
Sunyaxchen; % 998-884-9330) is open from
8am to midnight. MasterCard, and Visa are
accepted. The major shopping malls have

the Hotel Zone. You can stock up on Retin-
A, Viagra, and many other prescription
drugs without a prescription.
Police
To reach the police (seguridad pública), dial
% 998-884-1913 or 884-2342.

130

Post Office
The main post office (% 998/884-1418) is
downtown at the intersection of avenidas
Sunyaxchen and Xel-Ha. It’s open Monday
to Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays, from 
9 a.m. to noon, it’s open just for the pur-
chase of stamps.
Safety
There is very little crime in Cancún. People
are generally safe late at night in tourist
areas; just use ordinary, common sense. As
at any other beach resort, don’t take money
or valuables to the beach.
Swimming on the Caribbean side presents a
danger from undertow. Pay attention to the
posted flag warnings on the beaches.
Car break-ins are about the only crimes
here, although they do happen frequently,
especially around the shopping centers in
the Hotel Zone. VW Beetles and Golfs are
frequent targets.
Taxes
There’s a 10 percent value-added tax (IVA)
on goods and services, and it’s generally
included in the posted price. Cancún’s IVA
is 5 percent lower than most of Mexico due
to a special exemption that dates back to its
origins as a duty-free port.
Taxis
Taxi prices in Cancún are set by zone, and
keeping track of what’s in which zone can
take some work. Taxi rates within the Hotel
Zone are a minimum fare of $6 per ride,
making it one of the most expensive taxi
areas in Mexico. Rates within the down-
town area are between $1.50 and $2. You
can also hire taxis by the hour or day for
longer trips, when you’d prefer to leave the
driving to someone else. Rates run between
$15 and $20 per hour with discounts avail-
able for full-day rates, but an extra charge
applies when the driver doubles as a tour
guide. Always settle on a price in advance,
or check at your hotel, where destinations
and prices are generally posted.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
by using a Mexican prepaid phone card
called Telmex (LADATEL), available at most
pharmacies and mini-supermarkets, using
the official public phones, Telmex (Lada).
Remember, in Mexico, you need to dial 001
prior to a number to reach the United States,
and you need to preface long-distance calls
within Mexico by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Cancún operates on central standard time,
but Mexico’s observance of daylight saving
time varies somewhat from that in the
United States.

Dining in Cancún
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Discovering Cancún’s best restaurants
 Finding a restaurant with true Mexican ambience
U
.S.-based franchise chains, which really need no introduction, pop-
ulate a large part of Cancún’s restaurant scene. These chains
include Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood, Rainforest Cafe, Tony Roma’s,
Ruth’s Chris Steak House, and the gamut of fast-food burger places.
Contrary to common travelers’ wisdom, many of Cancún’s best restau-
rants are located either in hotels or shopping malls.
The majority of restaurants are located in the Hotel Zone in Isla Cancún,
which is logical because that’s where most of the tourists who come to
dine out are located. However, don’t dismiss the charms of dining in
Ciudad Cancún. You’re likely to find a great meal — at a fraction of the
price of an Isla Cancún eatery — accompanied by a dose of local color.
As in many of Mexico’s beach resorts, even the finest restaurants in
town can be comfortably casual when it comes to dress. Men rarely
wear jackets, although you may frequently see women in dressy resort
wear — basically, anything goes.
For those traveling with kids, Cancún has no shortage of options. From
Johnny Rockets to McDonald’s, this destination has plenty of kid-
friendly — and kid-familiar — places.
Prices in Cancún can cover an extended range, boosted by shrimp and
lobster dishes, which can top $20 for an entree. If you’re watching your
budget, even the higher-priced places generally have less-expensive
options — just avoid the premium seafood dishes. Remember that tips
generally run about 15 percent, and most restaurant and bar staff really
depend on tips for their income, so be generous if the service warrants.

Cancún’s Best Restaurants
The restaurants in this chapter are either locally owned, one-of-a-kind
restaurants, or exceptional selections at area hotels. Many feature live
music as an accompaniment to the dining experience. I arrange the
restaurants alphabetically and note their location, as well as their gen-
eral price category and cuisine. Please refer to the Introduction of this
book for an explanation of the price categories.
Please see Appendix C for more information on Mexican cuisine.
Aioli
$–$$$
Isla Cancún
FRENCH
In the Le Méridien Hotel, the Provençal — but definitely not provincial —
Aioli offers simply exquisite French and Mediterranean gourmet special-
ties served in a warm and cozy country French setting. Though it has per-
haps the best breakfast buffet in Cancún (for $15), most visitors outside
the hotel enjoy Aioli only for dinner, when low lighting and superb service
make the restaurant a top choice for a romantic dinner. Starters include
the traditional pâtés and a delightful escargot served in the shell with a
white wine and herb butter sauce. A specialty is duck breast in honey and
lavender sauce. Equally scrumptious is the rack of lamb, prepared in a
Moroccan style and served with couscous. Desserts are decadent in true
French style, including the signature “Fifth Element,” a sinfully delicious
temptation rich with chocolate. For the quality and the originality of the
cuisine, coupled with the excellence in service, Aioli gets my top pick for
Cancún’s best value in fine dining.

fast, try the extremely popular all-you-can-eat buffet that beats the price
and quality of most hotel buffets. Main courses of USDA Angus steak and
seafood are the norm at lunch and dinner, and a menu catering especially
to children is available. Dessert standouts include flaming coffees, crepes,
and Key lime pie. Captain’s Cove sits almost at the end of Paseo Kukulkán,

scene continues into a candlelit dining room with padded side chairs and
tables shimmering with silver and crystal. Elegant plates of peppered scal-
lops, truffles, and potatoes in tequila sauce; grilled lamb; or mixed grill
arrive at a leisurely pace after the appetizer. The restaurant has both smok-
ing and nonsmoking sections. After dinner, take a turn on the dance floor,
as a band plays romantic music beginning at 8 p.m. Club Grill is the place
for a truly special night out. A dress code is enforced: No sandals or tennis

eggs in a green pumpkin sauce). The Labná Special is a sampler of four
typically Yucatecan main courses, including poc chuc, while another spe-
cialty of the house is baked suckling pig, served with guacamole. The
refreshing Yucatecan beverage, agua de chaya — a blend of sweetened
water and the leaf of the chaya plant, abundant in the area, to which
D’aristi liquor can be added for an extra kick — is also served here. The
large, informal dining room is decorated with fascinating black and white
photographs of the region, dating from the 1900s.

La Destilería

Isla Cancún
MEXICAN
If you want to experience tequila in its native habitat, don’t miss this 
place — even though it’s across the country from the region that produces
the beverage. La Destilería is more than a tequila-inspired restaurant; it’s
a mini-museum honoring the “spirit” of Mexico. It serves more than 150
brands of tequila, including some treasures that never find their way
across the country’s northern border, so be adventurous! The margaritas
are among the best on the island. When you decide to have some food with
your tequila, the menu is refined Mexican, with everything from quesadil-
las with squash blossom flowers to shrimp in a delicate tequila-lime sauce.

La Dolce Vita
$–$$$
Isla Cancún
ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
The casually elegant La Dolce Vita is known as Cancún’s favorite Italian
restaurant. Appetizers include pâté of quail liver and carpaccio in vinai-
grette or mushrooms Provençal. The chef specializes in homemade pastas
combined with fresh seafood. You can order green tagliolini with lobster
medallions, linguine with clams or seafood, or rigatoni Mexican-style (with
chorizo, mushrooms, and chives) as a main course, or as an appetizer for
half price. You can dine in air-conditioned comfort or on an open-air ter-
race with a lagoon view. Dinner is accompanied by live jazz from 7 to 
11 p.m., Monday through Saturday. They also have a location downtown,
at Av. Cobá 83 (corner with Av. Nader; % 998-884-3393).

SEAFOOD
La Fisheria is one of the exceptions to the rule about never finding good
food in a shopping mall eatery. The expansive menu at La Fisheria includes
shark fingers with a jalapeño dip, grouper filet stuffed with seafood in a
lobster sauce, Acapulco-style ceviche (in a tomato sauce), New England
clam chowder, steamed mussels, grilled red snapper with pasta — you get
the idea. The menu changes daily, but there’s always tikin xik, that great
Yucatecan grilled fish marinated in achiote sauce (made from achiote chile
paste). And for those diners not inclined toward seafood, a wood-burning,
oven-made pizza may do, or perhaps one of the grilled chicken or beef
dishes. If you’re at the mall shopping, La Fisheria is your best bet — and
a reason to stop by if you’re not.

Isla Cancún
FUSION
Laguna Grill offers diners a contemporary culinary experience in a lush,
tropical setting overlooking the lagoon. A tropical garden welcomes you at
the entrance, while a small creek traverses through the restaurant set with
tables made from the trunks of regional, tropical trees. As magical as the
décor is, the real star here is the kitchen, with its offering of Pacific-rim
cuisine fused with regional flavors. Starters include martini gyoza
(steamed dumplings) and shrimp tempura served on a mango mint salad,
or ahi tuna and shrimp ceviche in a spicy Oriental sauce. Fish and seafood
dominate the menu of entrees, in a variety of preparations that combine
Asian and Mexican flavors such as ginger, cilantro, garlic, and hoisin sauce.
Grilled shrimp are served over a cilantro and guajillo chile risotto. For beef-
lovers, the rib-eye served over a garlic, spinach, and sweet potato mash is
sublime. Desserts are as creative as the main dishes; the pineapple-papaya
strudel in Malibu rum sauce is a standout. If you’re an early diner, request
a table on the outside deck for a spectacular sunset view. An impressive
selection of wines is available.

Dine alfresco in a garden setting and enjoy some of downtown Cancún’s
finest food. Romantic in its setting on a vine-draped patio, La Habichuela
Part III: Cancún 
138

boasts tables that are covered in pink-and-white linens, and soft music
playing in the background. For an all-out culinary adventure, try
habichuela (string bean) soup; shrimp in any number of sauces, including
Jamaican tamarind, tequila, and a ginger-and-mushroom combination; and
the Maya coffee with xtabentun (a strong, sweet, anise-based liquor). The
grilled seafood and steaks are excellent as well, but La Habichuela is a
good place to try a Mexican specialty such as chicken mole or tampiqueña-
style beef (thinly sliced, marinated, and grilled). For something totally
divine, try the Cocobichuela, which is lobster and shrimp in a curry sauce
served in a coconut shell and topped with fruit.

Lorenzillo’s 
$–$$$
Isla Cancún
SEAFOOD
Live lobster is the overwhelming favorite here, and part of the appeal is
selecting your dinner out of the giant lobster tank. A dock leads down to
the main dining area, overlooking the lagoon and is topped by a giant
palapa. When the place is packed (which is often), a wharf-side bar han-
dles the overflow. In addition to the lobster — it comes grilled, steamed,
or stuffed — good bets are the shrimp stuffed with cheese and wrapped in
bacon, the admiral’s filet coated in toasted almonds and a light mustard
sauce, or the seafood-stuffed squid. Desserts include the tempting
“Martinique”: Belgian chocolate with hazelnuts, almonds, and pecans,
served with vanilla ice cream. A sunset pier offers a lighter menu of cold
seafood, sandwiches, and salads. A festive, friendly atmosphere domi-
nates, and children are very welcome — after all, most of the patrons are
wearing bibs!

Dining at sea
One unique way to combine dinner with sightseeing is to board the Lobster Dinner
Cruise (% 998-849-4748). Cruising around the tranquil, turquoise waters of the lagoon,
passengers feast on lobster dinners accompanied by wine. The cost is $79 per person,
and the cruise departs two times daily from the Royal Mayan Marina. A sunset dinner
cruise leaves at 4 p.m. during winter months and 5 p.m. during the summer. A moon-
light cruise leaves at 7:30 p.m. during the winter and 8:30 p.m. during the summer.

Mango Tango

Isla Cancún
INTERNATIONAL
The beauty of dining here is that you can stay and enjoy a hot nightspot —
Mango Tango has made a name for itself with sizzling floor shows (featur-
ing salsa, tango, and other Latin dancing) and live reggae music — but 
its kitchen deserves attention as well. Try the peel-your-own shrimp,
Argentine-style grilled meat with chimichurri sauce, and other grilled 
specialties. Mango Tango salad is shrimp, chicken, avocado, red onion,
tomato, and mushrooms served on mango slices. Entrees include rice with
seafood and fried bananas. Creole gumbo comes with lobster, shrimp, and
squid, and coconut-and-mango cake is a suitable finish to the meal.

VEGETARIAN/MEXICAN
If you want a healthy reprieve from an overindulgent night — or just like
your meals as fresh and natural as possible — this is your oasis. No matter
what your dining preference, you owe it to yourself to try a Mexican tra-
dition: the fresh-fruit licuado. The blended drink combines fresh fruit, ice,
and either water or milk. More creative combinations may mix in yogurt,
granola, or other goodies. And 100% Natural serves more than just meal-
quality drinks — there’s a bountiful selection of basic Mexican fare and
terrific sandwiches served on whole-grain bread, both with options for
vegetarians. Breakfast is a delight as well as a good value. The space
abounds with plants and cheery colors. Prior to Hurricane Wilma, there
were several locations in town, most of which closed due to storm damage.
Other branches are located at Playa Chac-Mool, across from Sr. Frogs, and
downtown.

Paloma Bonita
$$–$$$
Isla Cancún
REGIONAL/MEXICAN/NOUVELLE MEXICAN
Possibly the most “Mexican” of Isla Cancún’s dining options, María Bonita
combines the music, food, and atmosphere of Mexico’s various regions —
it’s almost like taking a condensed food tour of this vast country! Being
that Paloma Bonita is located in a hotel (the Dreams Cancún), prices are
higher and the flavors are more institutionalized than the traditional
Mexican restaurants found in Ciudad Cancún, but the restaurant is still a
good choice for diners wanting more of Mexico’s flavors — without leav-
ing the Hotel Zone. The restaurant overlooks the water, and the interior is
divided by cuisine type. For example, one favorite is La Cantina Jalisco,
which features an open, colorful Mexican kitchen (with pots and pans on
the wall) and tequila bar (with more than 100 different tequilas). For the
Part III: Cancún 
140

less adventurous in your party, a few international dishes are thrown in
for variety. Trios, marimba, and jarocho music, as well as the ever-enchant-
ing mariachis, serenade diners. Check out the front of the menu for expla-
nations on the different peppers used. The kitchen marks each dish for its
heat quotient (from zero to two chiles). The restaurant is to the left of the
hotel entrance, and you can enter from the street.

MEXICAN/SEAFOOD/STEAKS
With colorful murals that almost dance off the walls, a bar area overhung
with baskets (and with saddles for bar stools), inviting leather tables and
chairs, and waiters dressed like Pancho Villa, it’s no wonder that Périco’s
is always booming and festive. It’s arguably the most tourist-friendly spot
in Ciudad Cancún. The extensive menu offers well-prepared steak, seafood,
and traditional Mexican dishes for moderate rates (except for the lobster),
but the food here is less the point than the fun. Périco’s is a place not only
to eat and drink, but also to let loose and join in the fun. Don’t be surprised
if other diners drop their forks, don huge Mexican sombreros, and snake
around the dining room in a conga dance. You can still have fun whether
or not you join in, but Périco’s is definitely not the place for that romantic
evening alone. There’s marimba music from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. and mariachis
from 9:30 p.m. to midnight. Expect a crowd.

ARGENTINIAN/STEAKS/SEAFOOD
As a tribute to the famed Puerto Madero of Buenos Aires, this restaurant
has quickly earned a reputation for its authentic Argentinian cuisine and
ambience. Overlooking the Nichupté Lagoon, the décor re-creates a 20th-
century dock warehouse, with elegant touches of modern architecture.
Puerto Madero offers an extensive selection of prime quality beef cuts,
whole wheat pastas, fish, and shellfish, meticulously prepared with the
Buenos Aires gusto. In addition to the classic carpaccio, their tuna tartar
and halibut steak are favorites, but the real standout here is the grilled
steak, served in ample portions. It’s also a top choice for a splurge on lob-
ster. Enjoy a glass of wine, from their extensive selection, or a cocktail,
while viewing the sunset from their lagoon-side deck. Service is excellent.

Surprised to find great pizza in Cancún? Don’t be. Rolandi’s Pizza is an

beef, and desserts. There’s a full bar list as well. Another Rolandi’s Pizza

Chapter 13
Having Fun on and off the
Beach in Cancún
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Enjoying Cancún’s best activities — on land and at sea
 Spending a day on nearby Isla Mujeres
 Exploring Maya ruins and environmental “theme parks”
 Seeing Cancún’s best sights
 Experiencing great shopping
 Living it up at night in Cancún
You’re likely to run out of vacation days before you run out of things
to do in Cancún. Snorkeling, Jet Skiing, jungle tours, and visits to
ancient Maya ruins or modern ecological theme parks are among the
most popular diversions in this resort that has a little of everything.
Beyond Cancún’s renowned beaches are more than a dozen malls with
name-brand retailers and duty-free shops (featuring European goods
with better prices than you can find in the United States), plus a seem-
ingly endless supply of nightclubs to revel in.
In addition to Cancún’s own attractions, the resort is a convenient dis-
tance from the more Mexican-feeling beach towns in Isla Mujeres, Playa
del Carmen, and Cozumel. The Maya ruins at Tulum and Chichén Itzá,
are also close by. All these diversions are within driving distance for a
spectacular day trip.
So what’s worth your time? To help you decide, I devote this chapter to
giving you an overview of the best beaches in this mecca of white sand
and crystalline waters. I also give you the rundown on the area’s popular
day trips and diversions.

Finding Water Fun for Everyone
If you’re in Cancún, you probably decided to come here based on the
vision of powdery, white-sand beaches and translucent, turquoise
waters. If you’re in search of a beautiful beach, Cancún may be your nir-
vana. And with the added bonus of the Nichupté Lagoon on the other
side of the island, Cancún is packed with ways to make the most of your
time in the water. Although much was made in the news about the loss
of Cancún’s famed beaches post 2005’s Hurricane Wilma, thanks to a
beach recuperation project priced at over $20 million, the white sands
are quickly coming back, and should be well in place by fall 2006.
Basking on a Cancún beach
The big hotels dominate the best stretches of beaches, so you likely
have a fine patch of sand at your hotel. Mexico’s beaches are public
property, so technically you can use the beach of any hotel by accessing
it directly from the sand. Technically is the key word here. Although this
is the law, the reality is that hotel security guards regularly ask non-
guests to relocate. You choose if you want to suffer the potential embar-
rassment of being asked to leave or, if asked, standing your ground — or
beach, as it were.
If you’re intent on swimming, be careful on beaches fronting the open
Caribbean, where the undertow can be quite strong. By contrast, the
waters of Bahía de Mujeres at the north end of the island are usually
calm and ideal for swimming. Get to know Cancún’s water-safety pen-
nant system and make sure you check the flag at any beach or hotel
before entering the water.
Here’s what each flag means:
White: Excellent
Green: Normal conditions (safe)
Yellow: Changeable, uncertain (use caution)
Black or red: Unsafe (use the swimming pool instead)
In the Caribbean, storms can arrive quickly, and conditions can change
from safe to unsafe in a matter of minutes, so be alert. If you see dark
clouds heading your way, head to shore and wait until the storm passes.
The public beaches located along the stretch of Isla Cancún on the calm,
Bahía de Mujeres side include
 Playa Linda: Playa Linda (located at Km 4 on Paseo Kukulkán) has
a shuttle service to Isla Mujeres, as well as a few dive shops and
snack bars.
 Playa Langosta: Playa Langosta (Km 5) is a protected cove near the
Hotel Casa Maya that features a tour-boat pier and a watersports
concession, plus some shops and restaurants.

Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 145

 Playa Tortuga: At Km 7.5, Playa Tortuga is a popular public beach
with changing rooms, public restrooms, and restaurants. On week-
ends, families frequently overrun this bit of sand.
 Playa Caracol: The last beach before the island curves toward the
Caribbean is Playa Caracol (Km 8), which stretches for about a mile
and passes the Fiesta Americana and Camino Real hotels — a
lovely stretch with a few restaurants but no public facilities.
Cancún’s Caribbean side faces the open sea, and it’s subject to frequent
riptides and strong currents. The regally named beaches here include
 Playa Chac-Mool (named after the Maya deity of rain): Playa Chac-
Mool (Km 13) has showers, restrooms, and other facilities that
make it as popular as Playa Tortuga on weekends.
 Playa del Rey: The last public beach (Km 20) on the island before
Punta Nizac, this beach is an unspoiled treasure. This remarkable
stretch of sand ends at the entrance to Club Med (at press time,
closed, without a scheduled reopening date).
At most beaches, in addition to swimming, you can rent a sailboard and
take lessons, ride a parasail, or partake in a variety of other watersports.
Skiing and surfing
Many beachside hotels offer watersports concessions that include the
rental of rubber rafts, kayaks, and snorkeling equipment. Outlets for
renting sailboats, Jet Skis, windsurfers, and water skis are located on
the calm Nichupté Lagoon. Prices vary and are often negotiable, so
check around.
A very popular option for getting wet and wild is a jungle cruise, offered
by several companies. The cruise takes you by Jet Ski or WaveRunner
through Cancún’s lagoon and mangrove estuaries out into the Caribbean
Sea and by a shallow reef. The excursion runs about two and a half
hours (you drive your own watercraft) and is priced from $35 to $55,
with snorkeling and beverages included. Some of the motorized mini-
boats seat you side by side; other crafts seat one person behind the
other. The difference? The second person can see the scenery or the
back of their companion’s head, depending on your choice.
The operators and names of boats offering excursions change often. The
popular Aquaworld (Paseo Kukulkán Km 15.2; % 998-848-8327; www.
aquaworld.com.mx) calls its trip the Jungle Tour and charges $55 for
the two-and-a-half-hour excursion, which includes 45 minutes of snorkel-
ing time. Aquaworld even gives you a free snorkel, but its watercrafts
have the less-desirable seating configuration of one behind the other.
Departures are every hour between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. daily. To find out
what’s available when you’re here, check with a local travel agent or
hotel tour desk; you can find a wide range of options. You can also go 
to the Playa Linda pier either a day ahead or the day of your intended
Part III: Cancún 
146

outing and buy your own tickets for this excursion or for Aquaworld’s
trips to Isla Mujeres. If you go on the day of your trip for the tour to Isla
Mujeres, arrive at the pier around 8:45 a.m.; most boats leave by 9 or
9:30 a.m.
Exploring the deep blue
Known for its shallow reefs, dazzling colors, and diversity of life, 
Cancún is one of the best places in the world for beginning scuba
diving. Punta Nizuc is the northern tip of the Gran Arrecife Maya
(Great Mesoamerican Reef), the largest reef in the Western Hemisphere
and one of the world’s largest. In addition to the sea life present along
this reef system, several sunken boats add a variety of dive options.
Note that 2005’s Hurricane Wilma did damage the offshore reef system,
so ask your operator about the conditions of the area, in order to ensure
you won’t have a disappointing dive. Inland, a series of caverns and well-
springs, known as cenotes, are fascinating venues for the more experi-
enced diver. Drift diving is the norm here, with popular dives going to
the reefs at El Garrafón and the Cave of the Sleeping Sharks —
although be aware that the famed “sleeping sharks” have departed,
driven off by too many people watching them snooze. For those unfamil-
iar with the term, drift diving occurs when divers drift with the strong
currents in the waters and end up at a point different from where they
started. The dive boat follows them. In traditional dives, the divers
resurface where they began.
Resort courses that teach the basics of diving — enough to make shal-
low dives and slowly ease your way into this underwater world of
unimaginable beauty — are offered in a variety of hotels. Scuba trips run
around $60 for two-tank dives at nearby reefs and $100 and up for loca-
tions farther out. One recommended operator is Scuba Cancún (Paseo
Kukulkán Km 5; % 998-849-7508; www.scubacancun.com.mx), located
on the lagoon side. In addition to calling or visiting, you can make reser-
vations from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. using the fax line: 998-849-4736. Their full
certification course takes three and a half days and costs $410. Scuba
Cancún is open from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and accepts major credit cards.
Scuba Cancún also offers diving trips to 20 nearby reefs and cenotes.
Dives in these underwater caves are at 9m (30 ft.), and the open ocean at
9m to 18m (30–60 ft.; offered in good weather only). The average dive is
around 11m (35 ft.). Two-tank dives cost $140. Discounts apply if you
bring your own equipment. Dives usually start around 9 a.m. and return
by 2:15 p.m. Snorkeling trips cost $27 and leave every afternoon at 2 p.m.
and 4:30 p.m. for shallow reefs located about a 20-minute boat ride away.
The largest dive operator is Aquaworld (see contact information in the
“Skiing and surfing” section, earlier in this chapter). Aquaworld offers
resort courses and diving from a man-made, anchored dive platform,
Paradise Island. The price is $99, and includes a basic scuba introduc-
tory course in the pool, as well as a general theory class on diving.
Aquaworld also has the Subsee Explorer, a submarine-style boat with
Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 147

picture windows that hang beneath the surface. The boat doesn’t actu-
ally submerge — it’s more like an updated version of the glass-bottom
boat concept — but it does provide non-divers with a look at life beneath
the sea. This outfit is open 24 hours a day and accepts all major credit
cards.
Most of the beaches in Isla Mujeres are either too rocky or offer no snor-
keling opportunities, so Garrafón or a trip to Isla Contoy are the only
real options here. There are few beachfront hotels on Isla Mujeres, but
those that exist aren’t located in good snorkeling areas except Casa de
los Suenos, which is adjacent to Garrafón. In addition to snorkeling at
Garrafón National Park (see the “Traveling to the Island of Women” sec-
tion, later in this chapter), travel agencies offer an all-day excursion to
the natural wildlife habitat of Isla Contoy that usually includes time for
snorkeling. The island, located an hour and a half past Isla Mujeres, is a
major nesting area for birds and a treat for true nature lovers. Only two
boats hold permits for excursions to the island. They depart at 9 a.m.
and return by 5 p.m. The price of $60 includes drinks and snorkeling
equipment.
The Great Mesoamerican Reef also offers exceptional snorkeling oppor-
tunities. In Puerto Morelos, 37km (23 miles) south of Cancún, this reef
hugs the coastline for 14km (9 miles). The reef is so close to the shore
(about 455m/1,492 ft.) that it forms a natural barrier for the village and
keeps the waters calm on the inside of the reef. The water here is shal-
low, from 1.5 to 9m (5–30 ft.), resulting in ideal conditions for snorkeling.
Stringent environmental regulations implemented by the local commu-
nity have kept the reef here unspoiled.
Only a select few companies offer snorkel trips, and they must adhere 
to guidelines that ensure the reef’s preservation. Cancún Mermaid
(% 998-843-6517 or cellphone [044] 998-155-1946; www.cancun
mermaid.com) is considered the best — it’s a family-run ecotour com-
pany that has operated in the area since the 1970s and is known for
highly personalized service. The tour typically takes snorkelers to two
sections of the reef, spending about an hour in each area. When condi-
tions allow, the boat drops off snorkelers and then follows them along
with the current — an activity known as drift snorkeling, which enables
snorkelers to see as much of the reef as possible. The trip costs $50 for
adults, $35 for children, which includes boat, snorkeling gear, life jack-
ets, a light lunch, bottled water, sodas, and beer, plus round-trip trans-
portation to and from Puerto Morelos from Cancún hotels. Departures
are Monday through Saturday at 9 a.m. or noon; a minimum of four
snorkelers is required for a trip, and reservations are required.
Reeling in the big one
You can arrange a day of deep-sea fishing at one of the numerous piers
or travel agencies for around $220 to $360 for four hours, $420 for six
hours, and $520 for eight hours for up to four people. For up to eight
Part III: Cancún 
148

people, prices are $420 for four hours, $550 for six hours, or $680 for
eight hours. Marinas sometimes assist in putting together a group.
Charters include a captain, a first mate, bait, gear, and beverages. Rates
are lower if you depart from Isla Mujeres or from Cozumel Island, and
frankly, the fishing is better closer to these departure points.
Swimming with dolphins
In Cancún, Wet n’Wild (% 998-193-2000) marine park offers guests a
chance to swim with dolphins (for $115) and view these wonderful crea-
tures in their dolphin aquarium, Atlántido. It’s a fun place for a family 
to spend the day, with its numerous pools, water slides, and rides.
Visitors can also snorkel with manta rays, tropical fish, and tame sharks.
Admission is $25 for adults, $19 for children 3 to 11, and it’s open 10 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. from November to April, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. from May to
October. American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted. The
park is located on the southern end of Cancún (Paseo Kukulkán Km 25),
between the airport and the Hotel Zone.
La Isla Shopping Village, Paseo Kukulkán Km 12.5, also has an Interactive
Aquarium (% 998-883-0413, 883-0436, or 883-0411; www.aquarium
cancun.com) with dolphin swims and the chance to feed a shark for
$110. Interactive encounters and swims start at $50.
The best option for doing dolphin swims is on Isla Mujeres, where you
can swim with dolphins at Dolphin Discovery (% 998-849-4757; Fax:
998-849-4758 or 849-4751; www.dolphindiscovery.com). Each session
lasts an hour, with an educational introduction followed by 30 minutes of
swim time. The price is $129, and transportation to Isla Mujeres is an addi-
tional $15. Advance reservations are required because capacity is limited
each day. Assigned swimming times are 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.,
and you must arrive an hour before your scheduled swim time.
Swimming with dolphins has its critics and supporters. You may want 
to visit the Whale and Dolphins Conservation Society’s Web site at www.
wdcs.org. For more information about responsible travel in general,
check out these Web sites: Tread Lightly (www.treadlightly.org) and
the International Ecotourism Society (www.ecotourism.org).
Enjoying Land Sports
Even by land, Cancún has its share of winning ways to spend the day.
Although golf is a latent developer here, more courses are popping 
up along the coast south of Cancún. Tennis, however, is tops as a 
hotel amenity, and you can find courts throughout Cancún. Horseback
riding and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) tours are also great choices for land
adventures.
Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 149

Teeing off
Although the golf options are limited, the most well-known — and 
well-used — facility is the 18-hole Club de Golf Cancún (% 998-883-
1230 or 883-1277; www.cancungolfclub.com), also known as the Pok-
Ta-Pok Club. Designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr., it’s located on the
northern leg of the island. Greens fees are $140 per 18 holes. Clubs rent
for $40, shoes run $18, and caddies charge $35 per bag. The club is open
daily; American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted. The club
also has tennis courts.
The Gran Meliá Cancún (% 998-881-1100, ext. 193) offers a nine-hole
executive course; greens fee is $43, and the club is open daily from 7 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
A more interesting option is at the Hilton Cancún Beach & Golf Resort
(% 998-881-8000; Fax: 998-881-8093). Its championship 18-hole, par-72
course was designed around the Ruinas del Rey (Ruins of the King)
archaeological site. Greens fees for the public are $175 for 18 holes and
$125 for nine holes, and Hilton Cancún guests pay $125 for 18 holes and
$90 for nine holes; all greens fees include a golf cart. Golf clubs and
shoes are available for rent, and the club is open daily 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The first Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course in the Cancún area is
located at the Moon Palace Golf Resort, along the Riviera Maya (www.
palaceresorts.com). Two additional PGA courses are planned for the
area just north of Cancún, Puerto Cancún, scheduled to be completed 
in 2007 and 2008.
Making time for tennis
Many hotels in Cancún offer excellent tennis facilities, and many of 
the courts are lit for night play. Among the best are the facilities at Le
Méridien and the Fiesta Americana Coral Beach hotels. The hotel reviews
in Chapter 10 include a number of hotels that have tennis courts on-site.
Galloping along
Rancho Loma Bonita (% 998-887-5465 or 887-5423; www.lomabonita
mex.com) is Cancún’s most popular option for horseback riding. Five-
hour packages are available for $54 (adults and children 6–12). The
packages include two hours of riding to caves, cenotes (spring-fed,
underground caves), lagoons, and Maya ruins, and also along the
Caribbean coast. A donkey polo game (yes, you get to play!) and some
time for relaxing on the beach are also included. The ranch also offers 
a four-wheeler ride on the same route as the horseback tour for $55
double, or $72 if you want to drive solo. Rancho Loma Bonita is located
about 30 minutes south of Cancún. The prices include transportation to
the ranch, riding, soft drinks, and lunch, plus a guide and insurance. Visa
is accepted, but cash is preferred.
Part III: Cancún 
150

Trailing away
Cancún Mermaid (% 998-843-6517; www.cancunmermaid.com), in
Cancún, offers ATV jungle tours for $49 per person and $66 for two. 
The ATV tours travel through the jungles of Cancún and emerge on the
beaches of the Riviera Maya. The two-and-a-half-hour tour includes
equipment, instruction, a tour guide, and bottled water; it departs daily
at 8 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. The company picks you up at your hotel. Another
ATV option is Rancho Loma Bonita; see “Galloping along,” on page 150.
Traveling to the Island of Women
One of the most popular — and in my mind, best — ways to spend the
day is to check out a real Mexican beach town across the narrow chan-
nel from Cancún. Isla Mujeres (Island of Women), located just 10 miles
offshore, is one of the most pleasant day trips from Cancún. At one end
of the island is El Garrafón National Underwater Park, which, although
damaged from Hurricane Wilma, still remains a good choice for snorkel-
ing and diving. At the other end is a captivating village with small shops,
restaurants, and hotels, along with Playa Norte, the island’s best beach.
Note that while the hurricane stripped sand from Cancún, much of it was
swept across the channel to Isla Mujeres, meaning the beaches here
have never been wider or lovelier.
To get to Isla Mujeres, you have four options:
 The public ferries from Puerto Juárez take between 15 and 45 min-
utes and make frequent trips.
 Traveling by shuttle boat from Playa Linda or Playa Tortuga is an
hour-long ride. The boats offer irregular service.
 The water taxi is a more expensive but faster option than the public
ferry or a shuttle boat. It’s located next to the Xcaret terminal.
 Daylong pleasure-boat trips to the island leave from the Playa
Linda pier.
Pleasure-boat cruises to Isla Mujeres include practically every conceiv-
able type of vessel: Modern motor yachts, catamarans, trimarans, and
even old-time sloops — more than 25 boats a day — take swimmers, sun
lovers, snorkelers, and shoppers out into the translucent waters. Some
tours include a snorkeling stop at Garrafón, lunch on the beach, and a
short time for shopping in downtown Isla Mujeres. Most cruises leave 
at 9:30 or 10 a.m., last about five or six hours, and include continental
breakfast, lunch, and snorkel gear rental. Others, particularly the sunset
and night cruises, go to beaches away from town for pseudo-pirate
shows and include a lobster dinner or Mexican buffet. If you want to
actually see Isla Mujeres, go on a morning cruise or go on your own

using the public ferry at Puerto Juárez. Prices for the day cruises run
around $45 per person.
The inexpensive Puerto Juárez public ferries are just a few miles from
downtown Cancún, and they give you greater flexibility in planning your
day. From Isla Cancún or Ciudad Cancún, take a taxi or the Ruta 8 bus
(from Av. Tulum) to Puerto Juárez. Choose the fast ferry (a 15-min. ride)
that costs $4.50 per person compared to the slower one (a 45-min. ride)
that costs $3.50. Departures are every half-hour from 6 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.
and then every 15 minutes until 8:30 p.m. Upon arrival, the ferry docks
in downtown Isla Mujeres near all the shops, restaurants, hotels, and
Playa Norte. Take a taxi or rent a golf cart to get to Garrafón Park at the
other end of the island. You can stay on the island as long as you like
(even overnight) and return by ferry, but be sure to check the time of
the last returning ferry — the hours are clearly posted.
The group that runs Xcaret (see the “Xcaret” section, later in this chap-
ter) now manages Garrafón (% 998-877-1101; www.garrafon.com), so
it has taken on more of a full-service theme-park atmosphere. A basic
entrance fee of $20 for adults and $10 for children entitles you to access
the reef, nature trails, and a museum, and to use kayaks, inner tubes, life
vests, the pool, hammocks, and public facilities and showers. You can
rent snorkel gear and lockers for an extra charge. Several restaurants are
on-site; an additional $20 (or $17 for kids) to the entrance fee gives you
access to the buffet and open bar. An all-inclusive option is available for
$44 for adults and $22 for children, which adds dining at any of the
restaurants, plus unlimited domestic drinks and use of snorkel gear,
lockers, and towels. Garrafón also has full dive facilities and gear rentals,
plus an expansive gift shop.
Other excursions from Isla Mujeres go to Garrafón Reefs underwater, so
you can have a near-scuba-diving experience and see many colorful fish.
However, the reefs are some distance from the shore, and they’re impos-
sible to reach on windy days with choppy seas. Also keep in mind that
the reefs have suffered from the storm, as well as over-visitation, and
their condition is far from pristine.
The Atlantis Submarine (% 987-872-5671; www.atlantisadventures.
com) provides a front-row seat to the underwater action. Departures
vary, depending on weather conditions. Atlantis Submarine departs
Monday to Saturday every hour from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.; tours last an
hour and 45 minutes and cost $79 for adults and $45 per child. You need
to take a ferry to Cozumel to catch the submarine. Still other boat excur-
sions visit Isla Contoy, a national bird sanctuary that’s well worth the
time. You can call any travel agent or see any hotel tour desk to get a
wide selection of tours to Isla Contoy. Prices range from $44 to $65,
depending on the length of the trip. If you plan to spend time in Isla
Mujeres, the Contoy trip is easier and more pleasurable to take from
there.
Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 153

Touring Ruins or an Eco-Theme Park
One of the best ways to spend a vacation day is by exploring the nearby
archaeological ruins or one of the new ecological theme parks near
Cancún. Historical and natural treasures unlike any you may have encoun-
tered before are within easy driving distance. Cancún is a perfect base for
day trips to these places that provide a great introduction to Mexico’s rich
historical past and diverse natural attractions.
Make the Maya ruins to the south of Cancún at Tulum your first goal.
Then, perhaps, you can check out the caleta (cove) of Xel-Ha or take the
day trip to Xcaret.
Organized day trips are popular and easy to book through any travel
agent in town, or you can plan a journey on your own via bus or 
rental car.
Seeing the archaeological sites
You can choose from three great archaeological sites within proximity 
to Cancún: 
 Tulum: Summer hours: daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; winter hours:
daily from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. Admission $4.
 Ruinas del Rey: Daily 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Admission $4.50.
 Chichén Itzá: Daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission $8.50.
For all sites, admission for children under 13 and seniors over 60 is free,
and admission is free on Sundays and Mexican national holidays for
Mexican citizens. Video camera permits cost $4, and parking is addi-
tional, varying with the site.
Tulum
Poised on a rocky hill overlooking the transparent, turquoise Caribbean
Sea, ancient Tulum is a stunning site — and my personal favorite of all
the ruins. It’s not the largest or most important of the Maya ruins in this
area, but it’s the only one by the sea, which makes it the most visually
impressive in my opinion. Intriguing carvings and reliefs decorate the
well-preserved structures, which date back to between the 12th and
16th centuries in the post-Classic period.
The site is surrounded by a wall on three sides, which explains its 
name — tulum means fence, trench, or wall. Its ancient name is believed
to have been Záma, a derivative of the Maya word for “morning” or
“dawn,” and the sunrise at Tulum is certainly dramatic. The wall is
believed to have been constructed after the original buildings to protect
the interior religious altars from a growing number of invaders. Although
Tulum is considered to have been principally a place of worship, mem-
bers of the upper classes later took up residence here to take advantage

of the protective wall. Between the two most dramatic structures — the
castle and the Temple of the Wind — lies Tulum Cove, where you can
swim and spend time relaxing on this absolutely magical beach. The cove
is a small inlet with a beach of fine, white sand, and it was a point of
departure for Maya trading vessels in ancient times. Entrance to the site
without a tour is $4; use of a video camera requires a $4 permit. A popu-
lar day excursion combines a visit to the ruins at Tulum with the ecologi-
cal water park Xel-Ha (see the “Xel-Ha” section, later in this chapter).

Tulum is located 130km (81 miles) south of Cancún, along Highway 307.
The ruins’ entrance is to your left, before you pass through the town of
Tulum. After you turn left, you come to the parking lot, which also offers
restroom facilities, a snack bar, and some shops. A shuttle train ($1) is
available to take to you the site of the ruins, but it’s also an easy walk of
a little more than a kilometer (1⁄2 mile).
Chichén Itzá
The fabled pyramids and temples of Chichén Itzá (no, it doesn’t rhyme
with “chicken pizza”; the accents are on the last syllables: chee-chehn
eet-zah) are the region’s best-known ancient monuments. Walking among
these stone platforms, pyramids, and ball courts gives you an apprecia-
tion for this ancient civilization that you can’t get from reading books.
The city is built on such a scale as to evoke a sense of wonder: To fill the
plaza during one of the mass rituals that occurred here a millennium ago
would have required an enormous number of celebrants. Even today,
with the mass flow of tourists through these plazas, the ruins feel empty.
The site occupies 10 sq. km (4 sq. miles) and it takes most of the day to
see all the ruins, which are open daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Service areas are
open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Admission is $8.50, free for children under age 13
and seniors over 60 and free for Mexican citizens on Sundays and holi-
days. A permit to use your own video camera costs an additional $4.
Chichén Itzá’s sound and light show is worth seeing and is included in
the cost of admission. The show is held at 8 p.m. every night and is in
Spanish, but headsets providing translations in several languages are
available for rent ($3).
Chichén Itzá is located 179km (112 miles) west of Cancún, along
Highway 180, between Cancún and Merida. You can arrange day trips
from Cancún through your hotel or through a travel agent in the United
States (before you go) or in Mexico.
Ruinas del Rey
Cancún has its own Maya ruins — Ruinas del Rey (no phone) — a small
site that’s less impressive than the ruins at Tulum or Chichén Itzá. Maya
fishermen built this small ceremonial center and settlement very early in
the history of Maya culture and then abandoned it. The site was reset-
tled again near the end of the post-Classic period, not long before the
conquistadors arrived. You can see the platforms of numerous small
temples amid the banana plants, papayas, and wildflowers. The Hilton
Cancún golf course has been built around the ruins, but the ruins have 
a separate entrance for sightseers. The ruins are located at Paseo
Kukulkán Km 17, about 21km (13 miles) from town, at the southern
reaches of the Hotel Zone, close to Punta Nizuc. Look for the Hilton hotel
on the left (east) and then the ruins on the right (west). Admission to
the site without a tour is $4.50, free for Mexican citizens on Sundays. It’s
open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Exploring an eco-theme park
The popularity of the Xcaret and Xel-Ha eco-parks has inspired a grow-
ing number of entrepreneurs to ride the wave of interest in ecological
and adventure theme parks. Be aware that “theme park” more than “eco-
logical” is the operative part of the phrase. The newer parks of Aktun
Chen and Tres Ríos are — so far — less commercial and more focused
on nature than their counterparts.

Aktun Chen 
This park, consisting of a spectacular 5,000-year-old grotto and an abun-
dance of wildlife, marks the first time that above-the-ground cave sys-
tems in the Yucatán have been open to the public. The name Aktun Chen
means “cave with an underground river inside.” The main cave contain-
ing three rivers is more than 500m (1,640 ft.) long with a magnificent
vault. Discreet illumination and easy walking paths make visiting the
caves more comfortable, without appearing to alter the caves too much
from their natural state. The caves contain thousands of stalactites, sta-
lagmites, and sculpted rock formations, along with a 12m-deep (40-ft.)
cenote (an underground, spring-fed cave) with clear blue water.
Aktun Chen was once underwater itself, and you notice fossilized shells
and fish embedded in the limestone as you walk along the paths. Caves
are an integral part of this region’s geography and geology, and knowl-
edgeable guides lead you through the site while providing explanations
and offering mini-history lessons on the Maya’s association with these
caves. Tours have no set times — guides are available to take you when
you arrive — and groups are kept to a maximum of 20 people.
Nature trails surround the caves throughout the 395-hectare (988-acre)
park, where spotting deer, spider monkeys, iguanas, and wild turkeys is
common. A small, informal restaurant and gift shop are also on-site.
Traveling to Aktun Chen on your own is easy. From Cancún, go south on
Highway 307 (the road to Tulum). Just past the turnoff for Akumal, a sign
on the right side of the highway indicates the turnoff for Aktun Chen;
from there, it’s a 3km (2-mile) drive west along a smooth but unpaved
road. Travel time from Cancún is about an hour, and the park is open
from 9 a.m. until dark. The entry fee of $18 includes the services of a
guide. Call % 998-892-0662 or 984-877-8550 for more information, or you
can visit the park via the Internet at www.aktunchen.com.
Tres Ríos
Tres Ríos — meaning three rivers — is the most “natural” of the area’s
nature parks. Located on more than 60 hectares (150 acres) of land, this
park is a true nature reserve that offers guests a beautiful area for kayak-
ing, canoeing, snorkeling, horseback riding, or biking along jungle trails.
Essentially, the park is just one big natural spot for participating in these
activities. It’s definitely less commercial than the other eco-theme parks.
Tres Rios closed following the October 2005 hurricane, and took the
opportunity to make some improvements to its facilities. At press time it
was scheduled to reopen during the summer, 2006.
The park is located just 25 minutes south of Cancún. The entrance fee is
$22 for adults and $19 for children, which includes canoe trips; the use
of bikes, kayaks, and snorkeling equipment; and the use of hammocks
and beach chairs after you tire yourself out. Extra charges apply for
scuba diving, horseback riding, and extended guided tours through the
Part III: Cancún 
158

preserve and its estuary. Tres Ríos also has bathroom facilities, show-
ers, and a convenience store; however, the facilities are much less
sophisticated than the area’s other, more developed eco-theme parks.
Most Cancún travel agencies sell a half-day “kayak express” tour to 
Tres Ríos. Priced at $48, the trip includes admission to the park and its
activities, round-trip transportation, lunch, and two nonalcoholic drinks.
Call % 998-887-8077 in Cancún or visit the park’s Web site at www.
tres-rios.com for details and reservations. 
Xcaret
Xcaret (ish-cah-reht), located 80km (50 miles) south of Cancún (% 998-
883-0470 or 984-871-5200; www.xcaretcancun.com), is a specially built
ecological and archaeological theme park and one of the area’s most pop-
ular tourist attractions. Xcaret has become almost a reason in itself to
visit Cancún. With a ton of attractions — most of them participatory — in
one location, it’s the closest thing to Disneyland in Mexico. In Cancún,
signs advertising Xcaret and folks handing out Xcaret leaflets are every-
where. The park has its own bus terminal in Cancún where buses pick up
tourists at regular intervals. Plan to spend a full day here. Children love
it, and the jungle setting and palm-lined beaches are beautiful. Past the
entrance booths (built to resemble small Maya temples) are pathways
that meander around bathing coves, the snorkeling lagoon, and the
remains of a group of real Maya temples.
Xcaret may celebrate Mother Nature, but its builders rearranged quite 
a bit of her handiwork in completing it. If you’re looking for a place to
escape the commercialism of Cancún, this may not be it. The park is rel-
atively expensive and may be very crowded, thus diminishing the adver-
tised “natural” experience.
Entrance gains you access to swimming beaches, limestone tunnels to
snorkel through, marked palm-lined pathways, a wild-bird breeding
aviary, horseback riding, scuba diving, a botanical garden and nursery, a
sea turtle nursery, a butterfly pavilion, and a tropical aquarium, where
visitors can touch underwater creatures such as manta rays, starfish,
and octopuses. Extra charges apply for some of these activities. One 
of the park’s most popular attractions is the excellent “Dolphinarium,”
where visitors (on a first-come, first-served basis) can swim with the 
dolphins for an extra charge of $115.
Oh, but there’s more. Xcaret features a replica of the ancient Maya game,
pok-ta-pok. In this game, six “warriors” bounce around a 9-pound ball
with their hips. The Seawalker, a type of watersport designed for non-
swimmers, is another attraction. By donning a special suit and helmet
with a connected air pump, you can walk on the ocean floor or examine
a coral reef in a small bay.
The visitor center has lockers, first-aid assistance, and a gift shop. Visitors
aren’t allowed to bring in food or drinks, so you’re limited to the rather
Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 159

high-priced restaurants on-site. No personal radios are allowed, and you
must remove all suntan lotion if you swim in the lagoon to avoid poison-
ing the lagoon habitat.
The admission price of $59 for adults, $41 for children ages 5 to 12, enti-
tles you to use the facilities, boats, life jackets, snorkeling equipment for
the underwater tunnel and lagoon, and lounge chairs. Other attractions,
such as snorkeling at $34, horseback riding at $51, scuba diving at $55
for certified divers ($75 for a resort course), and the dolphin swim at
$115, cost extra. There may be more visitors than equipment (in the
case of beach chairs, for example), so bring a beach towel and your own
snorkeling gear to be on the safe side.
Travel agencies in Cancún offer day trips to Xcaret that depart at 8 a.m.
and return at 6 p.m. The cost is $89 for adults and $60 for children,
which includes transportation, admission, and a guide. You can also buy
a ticket to the park at the Xcaret bus terminal (% 998-881-2401, 883-
3143), located next to the Fiesta Americana Coral Beach hotel on Isla
Cancún. The “Xcaret Day and Night” trip includes round-trip transporta-
tion from Cancún, a charreada festival (where horse-riding and roping
skills are showcased), lighted pathways to Maya ruins, dinner, and a folk-
loric show. The cost is $89 for adults and $45 for children age 6 to 11
(free for kids 5 and under). Buses leave the terminal at 9 and 10 a.m.
daily, with the “Day and Night” tour returning at 9:30 p.m. The park itself
is open Monday to Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Sunday 8:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m.
Xel-Ha
The sea has carved the Caribbean coast of the Yucatán into hundreds of
small caletas, or coves, that form the perfect habitat for tropical marine
life, both flora and fauna. Many caletas along the coast remain undiscov-
ered and pristine, but Xel-Ha (shell-hah), located near Tulum, plays host
daily to throngs of snorkelers and scuba divers who come to luxuriate in
its warm waters and swim among its brilliant fish. Xel-Ha is a swimmers’
paradise with no threat of undertow or pollution. It’s a beautiful, com-
pletely calm cove that’s a perfect place to bring kids for their first snor-
keling experience. Experienced snorkelers may be disappointed because
the crowds seem to have driven out the living coral and many of the fish
here.
Xel-Ha (% 998-884-9422 or 883-3293; www.xelha.com.mx) is 117km (73
miles) south of Cancún along Highway 307. The entrance is a half-mile
from the highway. Admission is $33 per adult and $23 for children age 5
to 11 (free for children under 5) and includes use of inner tubes, life
vests, and shuttle trains to the river. You can also choose an all-inclusive
option for admission, equipment, food, and beverages that runs $59 for
adults and $41 for children. The park is open daily 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
offers free parking with admission, and accepts American Express,
MasterCard, and Visa. After you arrive at the 4-hectare (10-acre) park,
you can rent snorkeling equipment and an underwater camera, but you
Part III: Cancún 
160

may also bring your own. Food and beverage service, changing rooms,
showers, and other facilities are available. Platforms have been con-
structed that allow decent sea-life viewing for non-snorkelers.
In addition, the resort offers “snuba,” a clever invention that combines
snorkeling and scuba. Snuba is a shallow-water diving system that
places conventional scuba tanks on secure rafts that float at surface
level; the “snuba-diver” breathes normally through a mouthpiece, which
is connected to a long air hose attached to the tank above. This setup
enables a swimmer to go as deep as 6m (20 ft.) below the surface and
stay down for as long as an hour or more. It’s a great transition to scuba,
and many divers may even enjoy it more because snuba leaves you
remarkably unencumbered by equipment.
When you swim, be careful to observe the “swim here” and “no swim-
ming” signs. You can see the greatest variety of fish right near the ropes
that divide the swimming areas from the non-swimming areas and near
any groups of rocks. An interactive dolphin attraction has been added —
a one-hour swim costs $115, and an educational 15-minute program runs
$15. Make your reservations at least 24 hours in advance for one of the
four daily sessions: 9:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2 p.m., and 3:15 p.m.
If you’re driving, just south of Xel-Ha turn off on the west side of the
highway so you don’t miss the ruins of ancient Xel-Ha. You’re likely to
be the only one there as you walk over limestone rocks and through the
tangle of trees, vines, and palms. There’s a huge, deep, dark cenote to
one side, a temple palace with tumbled-down columns, a jaguar group,
and a conserved temple group. A covered palapa on one pyramid guards
a partially preserved mural. Admission is $3.50.
Xel-Ha is close to the ruins at Tulum (check out “Seeing the archaeologi-
cal sites,” earlier in this chapter) and makes a good place for a dip after
you finish climbing the Maya ruins. You can even make the short 13km
(8-mile) hop north from Tulum to Xel-Ha by public bus. When you get off
at the junction for Tulum, ask the restaurant owner when the next buses
come by; otherwise, you may have to wait as long as two hours on the
highway.
Sightseeing in Cancún
To the right side of the entrance to the Cancún Convention Center is the
small Museo Arqueológico de Cancún (% 998-883-0305), a small but
interesting museum with relics from archaeological sites around the
state. Admission is $2. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday from 
9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
During the winter tourist season, bullfights are held every Wednesday at
3:30 p.m. in Cancún’s small bullring (% 998-884-8372), which is located
near the northern end of Paseo Kukulkán (avs. Bonampak and Sayil). A
sport introduced to Mexico by the Spanish viceroys, bullfighting is now
Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 161

as much a part of Mexican culture as tequila. The bullfights usually
include four bulls, and the spectacle begins with a folkloric dance exhibi-
tion, followed by a performance by the charros (Mexico’s sombrero-
wearing cowboys). You’re not likely to see Mexico’s best bullfights in
Cancún — the real stars are in Mexico City.
Keep in mind that if you go to a bullfight, you’re going to see a bullfight,
so stay away if you’re an animal lover or you can’t bear the sight of
blood. Travel agencies in Cancún sell tickets: $35 for adults, with chil-
dren admitted free of charge. Seating is by general admission. American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
La Torre Cancún, a rotating tower at the El Embarcadero park and
entertainment complex, once offered the best possible view of Cancún
and should do so again soon, although its reopening date was uncertain
at press time. It’s located at Paseo Kukulkán Km 4 (% 998-849-7777).
Former prices were $9 for one ride; and $14 for a day and night pass. 
Shopping in Cancún
Despite the surrounding natural splendor, shopping has become a
favored activity in Cancún, and the place is known throughout Mexico
for its diverse array of shops and festive malls catering to large numbers
of international tourists. Tourists arriving from the United States may
find apparel more expensive in Cancún, but the selection here is much
broader than in other Mexican resorts.
Numerous duty-free shops offer excellent value on European goods. The
largest shop is UltraFemme (% 998-884-1402 or 887-4559), specializing
in imported cosmetics, perfumes, and fine jewelry and watches. Its
Ciudad Cancún location on Avenida Tulum, Supermanzana (intersection)
25, offers lower prices than the locations at Plaza Caracol, Kukulkán
Plaza, Maya Fair Plaza, and Plaza Flamingo or at the store at the interna-
tional airport.
Handicrafts and other artesanía works are more limited and more expen-
sive in Cancún than in other regions of Mexico because they’re not pro-
duced here, but they’re available. Several open-air crafts markets are
easily visible on Avenida Tulum in Ciudad Cancún and near the conven-
tion center in the Hotel Zone. One of the biggest markets is Coral Negro,
located at Paseo Kukulkán Km 9.5 (%/fax 998-883-0758). It’s open daily
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
The main venue for shopping in Cancún is the mall — not quite as grand
as its U.S. counterpart, but close. Cancún’s malls are air-conditioned,
sleek, and sophisticated, with most located on Paseo Kukulkán between
Km 7 and Km 12. You can find everything from fine crystal and silver to
designer clothing and decorative objects, along with numerous restau-
rants and clubs. Stores are generally open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
with clubs and restaurants remaining open much later. Here’s a brief

rundown on the malls, running from the northern to the southern end of
the island — and some of the shops they contain:
 Maya Fair Plaza/Centro Comercial Maya Fair, frequently called
“Mayfair” (Paseo Kukulkán Km 8.5; % 998-883-2801), is Cancún’s
oldest mall and features a lively, bricked center with open-air
restaurants and bars, such as Tequila Sunrise, and several stores
selling silver, leather, and crafts.
 The long-standing Plaza Caracol (Paseo Kukulkán Km 8.5; % 998-
883-1038; www.caracolplaza.com) holds Cartier jewelry, Guess,
Waterford Crystal, Señor Frog clothing, Samsonite luggage, Gucci,
and La Fisheria restaurant. It’s just before you reach the convention
center as you come from Ciudad Cancún.
 The entertainment-oriented Forum by the Sea (Paseo Kukulkán 
Km 9; % 998-883-4425; www.forumbythesea.com.mx) has shops
including Tommy Hilfiger, Levi’s, Diesel, Swatch, and Harley
Davidson, but most people come here for the food and fun. You can
choose from Cambalache, Coco Bongo, and Rainforest Cafe, plus 
an extensive food court. It’s open 10 a.m. to midnight (bars remain
open later). This mall suffered extensive hurricane damage, so has
been in the process of a complete face-lift. Some venues are already
open, with the remainder scheduled to reopen by July 2006.
 Plaza Flamingo (Paseo Kukulkán Km 10.5; % 998-883-2945), has
branches of Bancrecer, Subway, and La Casa del Habano (for Cuban
cigars) located inside. Following repairs suffered from Hurricane
Wilma, the Plaza was renovated and reopened for business in
March 2006. 
 The most intriguing mall is the La Isla Shopping Village (Paseo
Kukulkán Km 12.5; % 998-883-5025; www.laislacancun.com.mx),
an open-air festival mall that looks like a small village, where walk-
ways lined with shops and restaurants crisscross over little canals.
The mall also has a “riverwalk” alongside the Nichupté Lagoon and
an interactive aquarium and dolphin-swim facility. It suffered exten-
sive hurricane damage but reopened in March 2006. Shops here
include Zara clothing, Benetton, Guess, Swatch, Ultra Femme, and
much more. Dining choices include Johnny Rockets, The Food
Court (not actually a “food court,” but an Anderson’s restaurant),
and the beautiful Mexican restaurant, La Casa de las Margaritas.
There’s also a first-run movie theater, an Aquarium, a video arcade,
and several nightclubs, including Max-O’s and Alebrejes. It’s
located across from the Sheraton, on the lagoon side of the street.
 Inside Kukulcan Plaza (Paseo Kukulkán Km 13; % 998-885-2200;
www.kukulcanplaza.com) is a large selection of more than 300
shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. There’s a branch of
Banco Serfin; OK Maguey Cantina Grill; a movie theater with U.S.
movies; an Internet-access kiosk; Tikal, a shop with Guatemalan
Part III: Cancún 
164

textile clothing; several crafts stores; a liquor store; several
bathing-suit specialty stores; record and tape outlets; a leather-
goods store (including shoes and sandals); and a store specializing
in silver from Taxco. In the food court are a number of U.S. franchise
restaurants, including Ruth’s Chris Steak House, plus a specialty-
coffee shop. For entertainment, the plaza has a bowling alley, the 
Q-Zar laser game pavilion, and a video game arcade. There’s also a
large indoor parking garage. The mall is open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Discovering Cancún after Dark
Ready to party? The nightlife in Cancún is as hot as the sun at noon on a
cloudless July day, and clubbing is one of the main attractions of this let-
loose town. The hot spots are centralized in Forum by the Sea and La
Isla Shopping Village, but finding a party anywhere in town isn’t hard.
Hotels also compete for your pesos with happy-hour entertainment and
special drink prices as they try to entice visitors and guests from other
resorts to pay a visit. (Lobby-bar hopping at sunset is one great way to
plan next year’s vacation.)
Partying at a club
Clubbing in Cancún can go on each night until the sun rises over that
incredibly blue sea. Several of the big hotels have nightclubs — some-
times still called discos here — and others entertain in their lobby bars
with live music. On weekends, expect to stand in long lines for the top
clubs, pay a cover charge of $10 to $20 per person, and pay $5 to $8 for 
a drink. Some of the higher-priced clubs include an open bar or live
entertainment.
Check out the “Cancún Area” map on page 163 for various club locations.
The Bar Hopper Tour, offered by the American Express Travel Agency
(% 998-881-4050; Fax: 998-884-6942), is a great introduction to the
Cancún club scene. It’s not as cheesy as it may sound, and it’s a great
way to check out the top spots without making a major investment in
cover charges. For $60, a bus takes you from bar to club to bar to club —
generally a range of four to five top choices — where you bypass any
lines and spend about an hour at each establishment. Entry to the clubs,
one welcome drink at each location, and transportation by air-condi-
tioned bus is included in the fee, allowing you to sample the best of
Cancún’s nightlife.
Most of Cancún’s most popular clubs were located at the exact point on
the island where the most damage was done, so they’ve just received a
makeover. While many rushed to reopen in time for Spring Break 2006,
it’s up in the air which will assume the top hot spot, and, as any good
Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 165

clubber knows, popularity can shift like the sands on the beach. So take
this list as a starting point — extensive research showed me that these
were the current hot spots at press time, listed alphabetically:
 The City (Bulevar Kukulcán Km 9.5; % 998-848-8380; www.thecity
cancun.com), was Cancún’s hottest club, pre-Wilma, and promises
to be once again, since reopening in March 2006. It features pro-
gressive electronic music spun by some of the world’s top DJs.
With visiting DJs from New York, L.A., and Mexico City — Moby
even played here — the music is sizzling. You actually need never
leave, as The City is a day-and-night club. The City Beach Club
opens at 8 a.m., and features a pool with a wave machine for surfing
and boogie-boarding, a tower-high water slide, food and bar serv-
ice, plus beach cabañas. The Terrace Bar, overlooking the action on
Bulevar Kukulcán, serves food and drinks all day long. For a relax-
ing evening vibe, the Lounge features comfy couches, chill music,
and an extensive menu of martinis, snacks, and deserts. Open at 
10 p.m., the 7,600-sq.-m (25,000-sq.-ft.) nightclub has nine bars, stun-
ning light shows, and several VIP areas. Located in front of Coco
Bongo, The City also has a second location in Playa del Carmen.
 Coco Bongo in Forum by the Sea (Paseo Kukulkán Km 9.5; % 998-
883-5061; www.cocobongo.com.mx) continues its reputation as 
the hottest spot in town. This spot’s main appeal is that there’s no
formal dance floor, so you can dance anywhere you can find the
space — that includes on the tables, on the bar, or even on stage
with the live band! Coco Bongo can pack in up to 3,000 people —
and regularly does. You have to see it to believe it. Despite its
capacity, lines are long on weekends and in the high season. The
music alternates between Caribbean, salsa, techno, and classics
from the 1970s and 1980s. Coco Bongo draws a mixed crowd, but
the young and hip dominate. Choose between a $15 cover or $25
for open bar (national drinks).
 Dady’O (Paseo Kukulkán Km 9.5; % 998-883-3333; www.dadyo.net)
is a highly favored rave with frequent, long lines. It opens nightly 
at 9:30 p.m. and generally charges a cover of $15. Dady Rock Bar
and Grill (Paseo Kukulkán Km 9.5; % 998-883-1626), the offspring
of Dady’O, opens early (7 p.m.) and goes as long as any other
nightspot, offering a new twist on entertainment with a combination
of live bands and DJ-orchestrated music. It also features an open
bar, full meals, a buffet, and dancing.
 Glazz, in the La Isla Shopping Village (Bulevar Kukulcán Km 12.5,
Local B-7; % 998-883-1881; www.glazz.com.mx), is among Cancún’s
newest nocturnal offerings, combining a restaurant with a sleek
lounge and sophisticated nightclub for a complete evening of enter-
tainment. Geared for those over 30, music is mostly lounge and
house, and there are live entertainment acts (anything from drum-
mers to sultry dancers) periodically through the evening. The staff is
Part III: Cancún 
166

known as being among the top in town. The China Bistro has earned
rave reviews, while the Lounge’s vast selection of martinis and
“tequilitinis” is dangerously tempting. The Club is pure Miami-style,
with plenty of neon and a very hot DJ. It’s open nightly from 7 p.m. to
5 a.m. Cover is $10, and a dress code prohibits sandals or shorts.
Not into the party scene? The most refined and upscale of all Cancún’s
nightly gathering spots is the Lobby Lounge at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel
(scheduled to reopen September 5, 2006; % 998-881-0808, ext. 5310).
Live dance music and a list of more than 120 premium tequilas for tast-
ing or sipping are the highlights here.
Hanging out after dinner
Numerous restaurants, such as Carlos ’n Charlie’s, Planet Hollywood,
Señor Frog’s, T.G.I. Friday’s, and Iguana Wana, double as nighttime
party spots offering wild-ish fun at much lower prices than the clubs.
Check these out:
 Carlos ’n Charlie’s (Paseo Kukulkán Km 8.5; % 998-883-1862) is 
a reliable place to find both good food and fraternity house–type
entertainment in the evenings. A dance floor goes along with the
live music that starts nightly around 8:30 p.m. A cover charge kicks
in if you’re not planning to eat. It’s open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.
 Planet Hollywood (La Isla Shopping Village; % 998-881-8135; Fax:
998-881-8133; www.planethollywood.com) is the still-popular brain-
child (and one of the last-remaining) of Sylvester Stallone, Bruce
Willis, and that terminating politician Arnold Schwarzenegger. It’s
both a restaurant and a nighttime music/dance spot with mega-
decibel live music. It’s open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. The original
branch in Cancún was located at Plaza Flamingos, but at press time,
it was uncertain if this locale would reopen. 
Enjoying a cultural event
Several hotels host Mexican fiesta nights, which include a buffet dinner
and a folkloric dance show; the price, including dinner, ranges from $35
to $50.
In the Costa Blanca shopping center, El Mexicano restaurant (% 998-
883-2220) hosts a tropical dinner show every night and also features live
music for dancing. The entertainment alternates each night — mariachis
entertain off and on from 7 to 11 p.m., and a folkloric show takes place
from 8 to 9:30 p.m.
You can also get in the party mood at Mango Tango (Paseo Kukulkán 
Km 14.2; % 998-885-0303; www.mangotango.com.mx), a lagoon-side
restaurant/dinner-show establishment opposite the Ritz-Carlton Cancún.
Diners can choose from two seating levels, one nearer the music and the
Chapter 13: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Cancún 167

other overlooking the whole production. The music is loud and varied
but mainly features reggae or salsa. The one-hour-and-20-minute dinner
show begins at 8:30 p.m. nightly and costs $49. If you’re not dining and
come just for the music and drinks, a $10 cover charge applies.
For entertainment that lets tourists and locals mingle, head for the
downtown Parque de las Palapas (the main park) for Noches Caribeños
(Caribbean Nights), where live tropical music is provided at no charge
for anyone who wants to listen and dance. Performances begin at 7:30
p.m. on Sundays. Sometimes, performances are scheduled for Fridays
and Saturdays, but the calendar varies.

Part IV
Cozumel and the
Riviera Maya

In this part . . . 
T
he island of Cozumel and the mainland south of Cancún —
called the Riviera Maya — offer a different way of experi-
encing the transparent blue waters and white-sand beaches of
the Mexican Caribbean. Small towns, such as Playa del Carmen
and Tulum, and isolated resorts, both small and large, present
quite a contrast to Cancún’s studded line-up of hotels. Dotting
the landscape are nature parks, ruins, and lovely natural fea-
tures. Life in these parts is slower and holds more local color.
Access by air is easy. Cozumel has its own international air-
port and the Riviera Maya enjoys easy access to Cancún’s air-
port. As with Cancún, many people speak English, making
communication with the locals easy. The two chapters in this
part provide the information you need to make your stay in
the region relaxing and enjoyable.

ozumel is a Caribbean island 19km (12 miles) off the Yucatán coast.
More relaxed than the booming mainland, Cozumel has the feel of a
small island — roads that don’t go very far, lots of mopeds, few buses
and trucks, and a certain sense of isolation. It’s not that small — 45km
(28 miles) long and 18km (11 miles) wide — but the vast majority of the
land is uninhabited low tropical forest. The island’s one small town is
San Miguel.
Cozumel is a popular destination for divers and sun-seekers and is a busy
port of call for cruise ships. Divers come to Cozumel — the number-one
dive destination in the Western Hemisphere — to enjoy the towering
reefs lying just off the island’s western shore.
For sun-seekers, the island offers the beautiful Caribbean. Except for
when a front blows through, the water on the protected side of the
island is perfectly calm. It’s like having the Caribbean for a swimming
pool. And at several beaches you can find all the usual watersports and
beach activities. If you’re a golfer, you may want to check out a beautiful
golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus. If you’re not, try out an assort-
ment of tours and other activities. Because the island is a popular
cruise-ship port, you find lots of duty-free shops and jewelry stores.
Hurricanes Emily and Wilma made a mess of the island in the summer
and fall of 2005, but the town has bounced back strong. By the end of the
year, the shoreline boulevard, Rafael Melgar, was rebuilt and dressed up
with new plantings of palm trees. The stores opened shortly after that,
and within a half a year, the restaurants and hotels gradually returned to
their pre-hurricane status.

Choosing a Location
The town of San Miguel and almost all of Cozumel’s hotels are on the
island’s protected western shore. Some are north of town, some are south
of town, and some are in town. The hotels in town aren’t beach hotels, but
they’re less expensive and offer convenient access to the town’s restau-
rants, nightspots, dive shops, and stores. To go to the beach, you can take
a taxi or rent a bike, moped, or car. The hotels in town suffered more from
the flooding than from the wind or the storm surge.
If the most you want to do is hang out around the pool with the occa-
sional dip into the Caribbean, select one of the beach hotels either north
or south of town. These hotels were forced to close for months to repair
hurricane damage. Many took the opportunity to renovate their guest
rooms and upgrade amenities. All hotels outside of town have swimming
pools and all can provide services for divers and snorkelers. For the
most part, the southern coast has better beaches, but many of the
southern hotels are far from town, making it more expensive to do some
shopping and other activities. Some southern hotels are on the inland
side of the road, and some are on the beach side, which makes for a
large difference in price. The properties farthest away from town are all-
inclusives, which means that the price of your stay includes meals, bev-
erages, tips, taxes, airport transportation, and even some activities, as
well as your lodging.
Because Cozumel is a big destination for divers, all the large hotels and
many of the smaller ones offer dive packages; I don’t mention this in the
reviews later in this chapter, but you can ask about them when shopping
around for a hotel. All the large waterfront hotels have a dive shop and a
pier. If you would rather dive with an operator other than the one at
your hotel, that’s fine — any dive boat can pull up to any hotel pier to
pick up divers.
Evaluating the Top Accommodations
The prices I quote for the hotels are rack rates for two people spending
one night in a double room, and they include the 12 percent room tax.
Please refer to the Introduction of this book for an explanation of the
price categories. See Chapter 7 for tips on avoiding paying rack rates.
The beach hotels in Cozumel, even the smaller ones, work with several
vacation packagers for the U.S. and Canadian markets. You can get siz-
able discounts by booking airfare, ground transfer, and lodging in one
package. Working with some tour operators requires flexibility, but the
big ones for Cozumel — FunJet and Apple Vacations — offer enough
flights to accommodate many people’s vacation plans. If you want an all-
inclusive hotel, you can get a better deal through a travel agent or pack-
ager than by contacting the hotel directly. For more information about
working with vacation packagers and travel agents, check out Chapter 6.

Allegro Cozumel by Occidental
$$$$$
South of town
This all-inclusive has some sister hotels across the way on the mainland,
but this one enjoys something those others don’t: the placid water of
Cozumel’s protected coast. There is also a sister hotel next door, the
Grand Cozumel by Occidental, which is newer and has larger, nicer
rooms, but for the money, this hotel works because it has a better beach.
Guests at the Grand can enjoy the Allegro, but not vice versa. Rooms have
all been remodeled since the hurricanes and are midsize with standard
bathrooms. They are grouped together in two-story Polynesian-style
thatched buildings scattered about the resort’s grounds. You have a choice
of two double beds or one king. There are two large pools (one for activi-
ties, one for relaxing) and, of course, the beach, which was made broader
by the last hurricane. The hotel gets a mix of families and couples and
offers a wide range of activities and water equipment. It’s a good choice for
families who want only to be on the beach. Taking a taxi to town from here
can be expensive; the hotel is at the island’s southern end. Three restau-
rants and a snack bar are available.

In town
The Americans who run this B&B are personable, helpful, and have lived
on the island for years. Rates are a deal and include breakfast and several
little extras. Rooms can be rented by the day, the week, or the month. They
come with cool tile floors, painted furniture, and big bottles of purified
drinking water. The six apartments come with small kitchens (a minimum
stay of one week is required for the apartments). A shared guest kitchen
serves the other six rooms. Most rooms have a double bed and a twin bed,
but no TVs or phones. A number of common rooms, including a televi-
sion/computer room and a rooftop terrace, are available. Breakfasts are
delicious. To find the Caribo from the central plaza, walk 7 blocks inland

Located on the beach side of the southbound road, this hotel is great for

El Cozumeleño Beach Resort
$$$$$
North of town
An all-inclusive resort, El Cozumeleño is for people who want an active vaca-
tion with plenty to do, including an extravagant pool and sunning area, and
a full array of watersports and equipment rentals. As if that isn’t enough to
keep you busy, just across the road is the new golf course. Recently, the
owners have more than doubled the number of rooms in the hotel and
added to the amenities. The rooms in the old part are large, much longer
than they are wide; rooms in the new part are also large, and their shape
allows for a less awkward arrangement of furniture. All rooms have bal-
conies with a great ocean view, attractive décor, large bathrooms, and either
a king bed or two double beds. The hotel has two restaurants and three bars
(including a swim-up bar). There are three pools (including a wading pool
and a very large pool with a roofed section that provides shade), a large
whirlpool, and a tennis court. One drawback is that the beach is small for a
resort of this size. Moped rentals, an ample children’s program, a game
room, and miniature golf are some of the additional highlights.

Iberostar Cozumel
$$$$$
South of town
Just south of the Allegro Cozumel by Occidental (see review earlier in this
section), almost at the end of the island, is this all-inclusive hotel laid out
much like its neighbors: one- and two-story buildings, each holding
between four and eight units, surround a large common area of pools, a
snack bar, and the beach. Also, like the Occidental properties, this hotel is
operated by a Spanish company that mastered the business of running all-
inclusives on the Spanish coast. It has sister properties on the Yucatán
mainland, but this is the smallest of the company’s Mexican properties. It
closed after the hurricanes but reopened in early February 2006. Among
the changes are expanded and improved dining areas. Iberostar does a
good job with the food and the service, which is why I think it’s a step up
from most of the other all-inclusives. The tropical foliage that graced the
resort’s grounds took a hit, but management is working hard to return it
to its original condition. The guest rooms have been improved, too. They
are medium size and well equipped and come with a terrace or porch

equipped with hammocks. The bathrooms are ample, well lit, and come with
showers. There was one benefit from these hurricanes: They shifted a lot of
sand onto the property’s beach, making it larger and more attractive.

InterContinental Presidente Cozumel Resort
$$$$$
South of town
This is Cozumel’s finest hotel in terms of location, on-site amenities, and
service. Palatial in scale and modern in style, the Presidente spreads
across a long stretch of coast with only distant hotels for neighbors. The
resort was closed for many months after the hurricanes while undergoing
a thorough remodeling. Rooms have been completely redesigned and the
amenities modernized. The number of standard rooms was reduced and
now come in three categories — pool view, oceanview, and beachfront —
distributed among four buildings (two to five stories tall). The pool-view
rooms are concentrated around one of the resort’s pools and are medium
size. The oceanview and beachfront rooms are large with roomy, well-lit
bathrooms. Most are located in a long, two-story building facing the water.
Beachfronts are at ground level with a large patio and direct access to the
beach, and the oceanfronts are on the second floor and come with an
ample balcony. A long stretch of sandy beach area dotted with palapas and
palm trees fronts the entire hotel. This destination features a large pool,
plus a wading pool and a watersports-equipment rental booth. You can
choose from two restaurants and a bar, plus 24-hour room service. A spe-
cial in-room dining option with a serenading trio is available for beachfront
rooms. Two lighted tennis courts, a fully equipped gym, and a moped-
rental service for getting around the island are also on-site. A children’s
activities center makes this a good choice for families.

Playa Azul Golf & Beach Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
North of town
Playa Azul is perhaps the most relaxing of the island’s hotels. It’s small in
comparison with the island’s other beach hotels, and the service is atten-
tive and personal. For golfers it’s the best choice, as it includes unlimited
free golfing (guests pay only for the mandatory cart rental). The hotel’s
small beach with shade palapas has been restored since the hurricane and
is one of the best on this side of the island. It has a great beach bar and a
small pool beside it. Almost all the rooms come with balconies and ocean

views. The rooms in the original section are all suites — large ones at 
that, with very large bathrooms. They also come with sleeper sofas in the
living room area. The new wing mostly has standard rooms that are com-
fortable and large. The hotel’s restaurant offers the guests complimentary
breakfasts.

This hotel is located on the town’s shoreline boulevard. All the rooms in
front have ocean views. The balconies are large enough to be enjoyable
and are furnished with a couple of chairs. Rooms are a little larger than
your standard room, with better lighting than you find in most of the hotels
in town. They are simply furnished and decorated, but come with good
amenities, including a small fridge, hair dryer, wireless high speed serv-
ice, and a safe. Bathrooms are medium size or a little smaller and have
showers. The rooms in back go for $10 less and have a view of a small pool
and large Jacuzzi.

Settling into Cozumel
You get to the island either by airplane or by ferry from the mainland,
which means that you’ll arrive at the airport or the municipal pier. In
either case, nothing could be more straightforward. Cozumel’s airport is
small and presents no complications, and the municipal pier is right
across from the town’s main plaza.
Cozumel’s airport is immediately inland from downtown. There is only
one ground transportation provider: Transportes Terrestres, which
operates a fleet of air-conditioned Suburbans. Buy your ticket as you exit
the terminal. Fares are $5 per person to downtown hotels, $7 for hotels
along the north shore, and $10 and up for hotels along the south shore.
More charter flights come to the island than standard commercial
flights. You can buy just a plane ticket from one of the travel packagers
recommended in Chapter 6. Of course, they would prefer to sell you an
entire package, but they’ll be happy to fill empty seats on a plane if they
have to. Commercial carriers from the United States include Continental
(% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com); US Airways (% 800-428-
4322; www.usairways.com); and American (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.
com). Some of these flights are seasonal. In addition, Mexicana (% 800-
531-7921; www.mexicana.com) flies from Mexico City with several inter-
national connecting flights.
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya 
178

If Cozumel is your port of entry, you’ll receive a Mexican tourist permit
(FMT) upon arrival. This document is important, so take good care of it.
You’re supposed to keep it with you at all times — you may be required
to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to turn it in
upon departure.
Passenger ferries travel to and from Playa del Carmen. Of the two com-
panies that service the area — Barcos México (% 987-872-1508) and
Ultramar (% 987-869-2775) — there is little difference. They operate
from the same pier in Cozumel, they charge the same amount for a one-
way ticket ($11), and they take the same amount of time (30–45 min.) to
make the crossing. Since the hurricanes, the ferry schedules have been
in flux, but it’s safe to say that you’ll find departures every hour in the
mornings and, at least, every two or three hours in the afternoon. In
Cozumel, both companies dock at the downtown pier, called the Muelle
Fiscal. Both companies’ boats are enclosed and air-conditioned and
have comfortable upholstered seats. Short-term luggage storage is avail-
able at the Cozumel dock for $2 per day.
The car/passenger ferry to Cozumel from Puerto Calica (11km/7 miles
south of Playa del Carmen) takes a little longer, runs less frequently, and
costs $80 for a standard car. It’s operated by Marítima Chankanaab
(% 987-872-0916), with four departures per day: 7 a.m. and 1, 5, and 
9 p.m. Arrive an hour before departure. The schedule is subject to
change, so double-check it. The ferry docks in Cozumel are at the Muelle
Internacional (the International Pier, which is just south of town near
El Cid La Ceiba Hotel).
Knowing your way around town
San Miguel is logically planned and easy to find your way around. It’s
laid out on a grid, with avenidas (avenues) running north-south, and
calles (streets) running east-west. The exception is Avenida Juárez,
which runs east from the passenger-ferry dock directly inland and even-
tually turns into a road that crosses to the island’s eastern shore.
Avenida Juárez divides the town into northern and southern halves.
Everything north of Avenida Juárez is labeled norte, and everything south
is sur. What’s more, the parallel calles to the north of Avenida Juárez have
even numbers: 2 Norte, 4 Norte, 6 Norte, and so on, while the ones to the
south have odd numbers: 1 Sur, 3 Sur, 5 Sur, and so on. An exception is
Calle Adolfo Rosado Salas, running between 1 Sur and 3 Sur.
The avenida that runs along the shore is Avenida Rafael Melgar. The
avenidas running parallel to Melgar are numbered in multiples of five
that increase as you move inland: Avenida 5, Avenida 10, Avenida 15, and
so on.
The northern extension of Avenida Melgar, called Carretera Santa Pilar
or San Juan, leads to the northern hotels and the golf course. It’s only a
couple of miles long, but the southward extension of Melgar goes for
Chapter 14: Cozumel 179

several miles all the way to the island’s tip. It’s called Costera Sur. The
majority of the island’s big hotels are along the south road. Also along
this road is the Chankanaab National Park, encircling the beautiful
lagoon of the same name. Beyond Chankanaab are several beach clubs,
where you can enjoy the water and find food and beverages. These vary
from simple to quite elaborate.
After the Costera Sur reaches the southern tip of the island, it curves to
the left and heads up the less-protected eastern shore of the island. Here,
the coast is rockier and the surf is harder. Eventually, this road meets up
with the road that crosses the island and is the extension of Avenida
Juárez, known as the Carretera Transversal. This road passes by San
Gervasio, the island’s most prominent ruins, as well as the airport.
Getting around town
You can walk to most destinations in town. However, getting to outlying
hotels and beaches, including the Chankanaab National Park, requires a
taxi or rental car.
Car rentals run from $35 to $60 per day for an economy-sized car,
depending on the season. All the major rental agencies are present in
Cozumel, including Avis (% 987-872-0219) and Budget (% 987-872-
5177). Usually, you save a little money by renting a car in advance, but if
you want to have a car for only a day or two, renting a car through your
hotel and having the car-rental company deliver it is easy enough.
Moped rentals are a popular alternative on Cozumel. You can find rental
mopeds all over the village for a cost of anywhere from $15 to $30 for 
24 hours. If you rent a moped, be careful. Riding a moped made a lot
more sense when Cozumel had less traffic; now it’s a risky activity —
motorists have become pushier.
Moped accidents easily rank as the most common cause of injury in
Cozumel. Before renting a moped, give it a careful inspection to see that
all the gizmos — horn, light, starter, seat, and mirror — are in good
shape and be sure to note all damage to the moped on the rental agree-
ment. If the moped vibrates at cruising speed, it’s probably due to an
unbalanced wheel, and you should return it. Most importantly, read the
fine print on the back of the rental agreement, which states that you
aren’t insured, that you’re responsible for paying for any damage to the
bike (or for the entire bike if it’s stolen or demolished), and that you

without a helmet (subject to a $25 fine).
Taxis remain a good and reasonably priced option unless you plan on
doing some major exploring. Scan over these few sample fares for two

American Express
The local representative is Fiesta Cozumel
(Calle 11 No. 598; % 987-872-0725).
Area Code
The telephone area code is 987.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
There are several banks and casas de
cambio (exchange houses) on the island, as
well as ATMs. Most places accept dollars,
but you usually get a better deal paying in
pesos.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (9 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
4–8 p.m. daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day. Offices tend to close on
Saturday and Sunday, but shops are open
on Saturday, at least, and increasingly offer
limited hours of operation on Sunday.
Climate
From October to December, strong winds
and some rain can prevail all over the
Yucatán. In Cozumel, wind conditions in
November and December can make diving
dangerous. May to September is the rainy
season. Temperatures during the day in the
summer are 80°F to 90°F (27°C–32°C); in
winter 75°F to 80°F (24°C–27°C).
Diving
If you intend to dive, remember to bring
proof of your diver’s certification.
Underwater currents can be very strong
here, and many of the reef drops are quite
steep, making them excellent sites for
experienced divers but too challenging for
novice divers.
Hospital and Recompression Chamber
Cozumel has four recompression chambers
(cámaras de recompresión). Buceo Médico,
staffed 24 hours, is on Calle 5 Sur, 1 block off
Avenida Rafael Melgar between Melgar and
Avenida 5 Sur (% 987-872-2387 or 872-1430).
Another one is the Hyperbaric Center of
Cozumel (Calle 4 Norte, between avs. 5 and
10; % 987-872-3070).
Information
The State Tourism Office (%/fax 987-869-
0212) has information kiosks at the airport
and in front of the municipal pier. Hours are
from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday. 
Internet Access
There are a number of cybercafes near the
central plaza. One of the most reliable is
Modutel (Av. Juárez 15, at the intersection
with Av. 10). Hours are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. The
farther you go from the main plaza, the
cheaper the rates.
Police
Dial % 060. Remember that finding an
English-speaking operator at the police 
station is highly unlikely.
Post Office
The post office (correo), Avenida Rafael
Melgar at Calle 7 Sur, at the southern edge
of town (% 987-872-0106), is open Monday
to Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m.
to noon.
Taxes
A 15 percent IVA (value-added tax) on
goods and services is charged, and it’s gen-
erally included in the posted price.

Taxis
The government and taxi drivers union fix
the fares on the island. Taxis charge extra
for more than two passengers. Call % 987-
872-0236 for taxi pickup.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
by using a Telmex (LADATEL) prepaid phone
card, available at most pharmacies and
mini-supers, using the official Telmex (Lada)
public phones. Remember, in Mexico 
you need to dial 001 prior to a number to
reach the United States, and you need to
preface long distance calls within Mexico
by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Cozumel operates on central standard time.

Dining in Cozumel
Like many of Mexico’s beach resorts, even Cozumel’s finest restaurants
are casual when it comes to dress. Men seldom wear jackets, although
ladies occasionally wear dressier resort wear. Basically, if you err on the
side of casual, you won’t go wrong.
For inexpensive alternatives to the restaurants, try one of these sugges-
tions. If you’re in the mood for just a little bread or pastry to go with
your coffee, try Zermatt (% 987-872-1384), a terrific little bakery on
Avenida 5 at Calle 4 Norte. If you want something really inexpensive and
filling, try Comida Casera Toñita, on Calle Adolfo Rosado Salas between
avenidas 10 and 15 (% 987-872-0401). Comida casera means home cook-
ing, and this place definitely has the feel of someone’s home, in fact, it’s
Toñita’s home, open Monday to Saturday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Please refer to the Introduction of this book for an explanation of the
price categories. Remember that tips generally run about 15 percent,
and most wait-staff really depend on these gratuities for their income, so
be generous if the service warrants. In Mexico it is considered rude to
bring the customer the bill before being requested to, and sometimes it
takes a while for the cashier to write it up. If you’re in a hurry, ask for the
bill as soon as you can.

try some of the best Yucatecan food on the island — anything from pollo
ticuleño, a specialty from the town of Ticul, which is a layered plate of
smooth tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, crispy baked corn tortilla, and
batter-fried chicken breast, all topped with shredded cheese and green
peas; to poc chuc, pork marinated in a tangy sauce and grilled. There are
also a number of seafood dishes and Mexican classics on the menu, such
as butterfly shrimp, fried fish, or enchiladas. El Moro is 12 blocks inland

Lobster House (Cabaña del Pescador)

North of town
LOBSTER
The thought that most often occurs to me when I eat a prepared lobster
dish is that the cook could have simply boiled the lobster to better effect.
This restaurant’s owner seems to agree. The only item on the menu is lob-
ster boiled with a hint of spices and served with melted butter accompa-
nied by sides of rice, vegetables, and bread. The price of dinner is
determined by the weight of the lobster tail you select, with side dishes
provided at no charge. Candles and soft lights illuminate the dining rooms.
A rustic, tropical-island feel, gardens, fountains, and a small duck pond
make the scene inviting and intimate. The owner, Fernando, welcomes you
warmly and sends you next door to his brother’s excellent Mexican-food
restaurant, El Guacamayo, if you must have something other than lobster.

prime rib, filet mignon (good, quality meat), and lobster. For something
out of the ordinary, try the shrimp Bahamas, which are flambéed with a
little banana and pineapple in a curry sauce with a hint of white wine.
Pepe’s is a second-story restaurant with a large air-conditioned dining
room under a massive beamed ceiling. The lighting is soft, and a guitar trio
plays background music. Large windows look out over the town’s harbor.
The children’s menu offers breaded shrimp and broiled chicken. For
dessert, Pepe’s offers a few more flaming specialties: bananas Foster,
crêpes suzette, and café Maya (coffee, vanilla ice cream, and three liquors).

Having Fun on and off the Island
One of the advantages of vacationing in Cozumel is that you can indulge
in a true island experience and still be just a short hop from mainland
Mexico and its attractions. Playa del Carmen is an easy ferry ride away
and makes for a relaxing excursion. From there, you can take a bus to
one of the large nature parks such as Xel-Ha or Xcaret, or one of the
major ruins, such as Chichén Itzá or Tulum (see Chapter 13 for more 
on these attractions).
A trip to Xcaret is the easiest excursion. A visit to Xel-Ha is often com-
bined with a visit to Tulum. The trip to Chichén Itzá, if not done by
plane, is by far the longest and most exhausting. Easier still, you can
arrange a tour with one of the travel agencies on the island. Try
InterMar Cozumel Viajes (Calle 2 Norte No. 101-B, between avs. 5 and
10; % 987-872-1098; Fax: 987-872-0895; intermar@cozumel.com.mx).
Cozumel does have its own ruins, which are easy to visit. (But, honestly,
they can’t compare with the major sites on the mainland.) In pre-
Hispanic times, Maya women made a pilgrimage to the island to leave
offerings to Ixchel, the goddess of fertility. You can see the remains of
about 40 sites on the island today, and archaeologists still uncover the
small dolls that were part of the offerings. The most important ruins on
the island are at San Gervasio (see the “Seeing the sights” section, later
in this chapter).
Travel agencies can schedule activities such as glass-bottom boat tours,
submarine tours, dinner cruises, or a romantic supper on the beach.
For diving and snorkeling, you can do better by arranging your own
trip (see the “Exploring the depths” section, later in this chapter).
If you schedule a snorkeling or diving trip through a travel agency, you’ll
most likely end up on a boat full of cruise-ship passengers. Your best bet
is to find an operator who uses a small boat.
Combing the beaches
Although most of Cozumel’s shoreline is rocky, the island has some nice
beaches. And most beaches have what is called a “beach club” on them.
A beach club in its simplest form is just a palapa (thatched roof) shack
on the beach where you can enjoy soft drinks, beer, and fried fish. In a
more elaborate form, the beach club may have a full-service restaurant,
rent snorkeling gear, and even have a pool. A still larger version offers all
Chapter 14: Cozumel 185

kinds of watersports rentals, including banana boats, Jet Skis, and para-
sailing equipment. Cozumel has two beach clubs made in this latter
mold: Mr. Sancho’s and Playa Mía. Mr. Sancho’s has free admission;
Playa Mía has entrance fees from $8 to $37 for the all-inclusive rate. Both
are on the southern highway Costera Sur, about 13 to 16km (8–10 miles)
south of town. A quieter beach club with a pool and full restaurant is
Nachi Cocom (located almost a mile beyond Mr. Sancho’s). It charges $5
for admission.
For beach access without admission, south of Nachi Cocom are Playa
San Francisco, Playa Paraíso, and Playa Palancar. These are good
places to enjoy the beach. Beach clubs of the simpler variety include
Paradise Cafe on the southern tip of the island across from Punta Sur
Nature Park and Playa Bonita, Chen Rio, and Punta Morena on the east-
ern coast. Except on Sundays when the locals hit the beaches, these
places are quiet and uncrowded. Most of the east coast is unsafe for
swimming because of the surf.
Chankanaab National Park has a beach, too, and a variety of other
activities. Admission is $10. See the “Seeing the sights” section, later in
this chapter, for more information.
Exploring the depths
Cozumel is the most popular dive destination in the Western Hemisphere.
Don’t forget to bring your dive card and dive log. The dive shops on the
island rent scuba gear, but they won’t take you out on the boat until they
see some documentation. If you have a medical condition, bring a letter
signed by a doctor stating that you’re cleared to dive. A two-tank, morn-
ing dive costs around $65; some shops are now offering an additional
one-tank, afternoon dive for $15 for folks who took the morning dives.
(It’s about $30 if you just opt for the one-tank, afternoon dive.) A lot of
divers save some money by buying a hotel and dive package with or with-
out air transportation and food. These packages usually include two
dives a day.
Diving in San Miguel is different from diving in a lot of places — it’s drift
diving, which can be a little disconcerting for novice divers. The current
that sweeps along Cozumel’s reefs pulling nutrients into the reefs and
making them as large as they are also dictates how you dive here. The
problem: The current pulls at different speeds at different depths and in
different places. When it’s pulling strong, the current can quickly scatter
a dive group. This is why having a dive master experienced with the
local conditions is important.
The island has a lot of reefs to choose from. Most of the damage caused
by the hurricanes occurred in the shallower parts, above 15m (50 ft.). In
deeper areas, the currents produced by the hurricane actually improved
matters by clearing some areas of sand, exposing more caverns. Here
are just a few recommended sites:
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya 
186

 Palancar Reef: Famous for its caves and canyons, plentiful fish,
and a wide variety of sea coral
 San Francisco Reef: Features a shallower drop-off wall than many
reefs and fascinating sea life
 Santa Rosa Wall: Monstrous reef famous for its depth, sea life,
coral, and sponges
 Yucab Reef: Highlights include beautiful coral
Cozumel has more than 60 dive operators. I can recommend a couple.
Bill Horn’s Aqua Safari, on Avenida Rafael Melgar at Calle 5 Sur 
(% 987-872-0101; Fax: 987-872-0661; www.aquasafari.com), is a PADI
(Professional Association of Diving Instructors) five-star instructor
center with full equipment and parts rental and sales. Liquid Blue
Divers (% 987-869-7794; www.liquidbluedivers.com) offers a real
personal service. Owner Roberto Castillo has a small, fast boat and
takes a maximum of 12 per dive trip. He’s PADI certified, and his wife
Michelle handles the reservations through e-mail, responding to any
inquiry within 24 hours.
Underwater Yucatán offers a different twist on diving — cenote diving.
On the mainland, the peninsula’s underground cenotes (seh-noh-tehs), or
sinkholes, which were sacred to the Maya, lead to a vast system of under-
ground caverns. Here, the gently flowing water is so clear that divers
appear to be floating on air through the cenotes and caves that look just
like those on dry land, complete with stalactites and stalagmites.
The experienced cave divers of Yucatech Expeditions (%/fax 987-872-
5659; yucatech@cozumel.czm.com.mx) offer a trip five times a week.
Cenotes are 30 to 45 minutes from Playa del Carmen, and a dive in each
cenote lasts around 45 minutes (divers usually do two or three). Dives
are within the daylight zone, about 39m (130 ft.) into the caverns and no
more than 18m (60 ft.) deep. Company owner Germán Yañez Mendoza
inspects diving credentials carefully, and divers must meet his list of
requirements before cave diving is permitted. For information and
prices, call or drop by the office at the corner of Avenida 5 and Calle 3
Sur. There are several other cenote dive operators on the mainland who
are closer to the cenotes, especially in Akumal and near Tulum.
Snorkeling is also an option on Cozumel. The hurricanes did inflict some
damage to the shallow reefs visited by snorkelers. It will take a year or
two for the fan coral and other delicate structures to grow back. Anyone
who can swim can snorkel. Rental of the snorkel (breathing tube), gog-
gles, and flippers should cost only about $5 to $10 for half a day. A
number of small boats offer good snorkeling trips because they neces-
sarily take few people for each trip. One person who does a good tour 
is Victor Casanova. He speaks English and takes his time and doesn’t
rush his customers. You can contact him through e-mail at wildcat
cozumel@hotmail.com, or by phone at % 987-872-1028. Or you can try
the Kuzamil Snorkeling Center (% 987-872-4637), which offers a trip
Chapter 14: Cozumel 187

that goes to several spots and includes lunch for $65 for adults and $50
for children under 12.
Sailing away
Boat trips are a popular pastime on Cozumel. You can choose from
evening cruises, cocktail cruises, glass-bottom boats, and other options.
You can contract these tours through a local travel agency. One rather
novel boat trip is a ride in a submarine, offered by Atlantis Submarines
(% 987-872-5671; www.atlantisadventures.com). The sub holds 48
people, operates almost 3km (2 miles) south of town in front of the Casa
del Mar hotel, and costs $81 per adult and $47 for kids. Call ahead or
inquire at one of the travel agents in town. This is a far superior experi-
ence to the Subsee Explorer offered by Aquaworld, which is really a
glorified glass-bottom boat.
Catching a big one
The best months for offshore fishing are March through June, when 
the catch includes blue and white marlin, sailfish, tarpon, swordfish,
dorado, wahoo, tuna, and red snapper. You can contact Victor Casanova
(% 987-872-1028; wildcatcozumel@hotmail.com), or Aquarius Travel
Fishing (Calle 3 Sur No. 2, between Av. Rafael Melgar and Av. 5; % 987-
872-1092; www.aquariusflatsfishing.com).
Hitting the links
Cozumel has a lovely 18-hole golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus. 
It’s just north of town in the Cozumel Country Club (% 987-872-9570).
Greens fees are $165 including taxes and cart rental for morning tee
times ($99 for afternoon tee times). A couple of hotels on the island have
golf packages. The Playa Azul has the best arrangement, offering free
golf to its guests, who have to pay only for the cart rental.
Seeing the sights
Companies offer several kinds of tours of the island, but to be frank, the
best part of Cozumel isn’t on land; it’s what’s in the water. But, if you’re
starting to look like a prune from all the time in the water or you want to
try something different, travel agencies can book you on a group tour of
the island for around $40. Prices may vary a bit depending on whether
the tour includes lunch and a stop for snorkeling and swimming at
Chankanaab Park. If you’re only interested in Chankanaab, you can go by
yourself and save money (keep reading; more info is coming up in this
section). Taxi drivers charge $60 for four-hour tours of the island, which
most people would consider only mildly amusing depending on the per-
sonality of the taxi driver.
A horseback tour of the island’s interior is fun and inexpensive. A few
outfits offer horseback riding, but the best is Rancho Palmitas (no
phone). This outfit has the best horses and conducts the most interest-
ing tours. It has two locations, both south of town. One is near the
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya 
188

InterContinental Presidente Cozumel Resort and the other is across the
road from the Allegro Hotel by Occidental. Both locations are open seven
days a week. Tours depart at 8 and 10 a.m., noon, and at 2 and 4 p.m.
Chankanaab National Park is the pride of many of the islanders. It suf-
fered extensive damage from the hurricanes and was closed for repairs
until July of 2006. Chankanaab means “little sea,” which refers to a beau-
tiful, land-locked pool connected to the sea through an underground
tunnel — a sort of miniature ocean. Snorkeling in this natural aquarium
isn’t permitted, but you can snorkel off shore. There is a beach with
lounge chairs for sunbathing. Arrive early to stake out a chair and
palapa before the cruise-ship crowd arrives. The park has bathrooms,
lockers, a gift shop, several snack huts, a restaurant, and snorkeling gear
available to rent.
Bordering the lagoon is a botanical garden with shady paths. The garden
is home to 351 species of tropical and subtropical plants from 22 coun-
tries in addition to 451 species of plants from Cozumel. Several Maya
structures have been re-created within the gardens to give visitors an
idea of Maya life in a jungle setting. A small natural history museum is
also on the property. Admission to the park costs $10, and it’s open daily
8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Also at Chankanaab are dolphins. Dolphin Discovery (% 800-293-9698;
www.dolphindiscovery.com) has several programs for sharing a swim
with these highly intelligent animals. You need to make reservations in
advance, and the surest way is through the Web site. The most intensive
dolphin swim program costs $125. There are a couple of more economi-
cal programs costing $75 and $99. Dolphin Discovery offers a program
only in Cozumel where you can swim with sea lions ($59); reservations
also are a must. Finally, a sea lion show costs $5 per adult, $3.50 per kid.
Tickets are available through any travel agency in town. The show also
includes some scarlet macaws, which, like the sea lions, were rescued
from illegal captivity.
Swimming with dolphins has its critics and supporters. You may want to
visit the Whale and Dolphins Conservation Society’s Web site at www.
wdcs.org. For more information about responsible travel in general,
check out these Web sites: Tread Lightly (www.treadlightly.org) and
the International Ecotourism Society (www.ecotourism.org).
One of the most popular island excursions is to the ruins of San Gervasio
(100 B.C.–A.D. 1600). When it comes to Cozumel’s Maya ruins, getting there
is most of the fun — do it for the mystique and for the trip, not for the size
or scale of the ruins. To get to the ruins follow the Carretera Transversal
toward the eastern side of the island. The well-marked turnoff is about
halfway between town and the eastern coast. Stop at the entrance gate
and pay the $1 road-use fee. Head straight over the pothole-infested road
for about 3km (2 miles) until you reach the ruins. Pay the $5 fee to enter;
camera permits cost $5 for each still or video camera you want to bring in.
A small tourist center at the entrance has cold drinks and snacks for sale.
Chapter 14: Cozumel 189

More significant than beautiful, this site was once an important ceremo-
nial center where the Maya gathered. The important deity here was
Ixchel, known as the goddess of weaving, fertility, childbirth, the moon,
and medicine. You don’t see any representations of Ixchel at San
Gervasio today, but here’s a little history: Bruce Hunter, in his Guide to
Ancient Maya Ruins (University of Oklahoma Press), writes that priests
hid behind a large pottery statue of the goddess and became her voice,
speaking to pilgrims and answering their petitions. Ixchel was the wife of
Itzamná, the sun god and preeminent deity among all Maya gods.
Tour guides charge $10 for groups of one to six people, but, with a copy
of the green booklet San Gervasio, sold at local checkout counters and
bookstores, you can see the site on your own. Seeing the whole place
takes 30 minutes. Taxi drivers offer a tour to the ruins for about $25; the
driver waits for you outside the ruins.
In town, check out the small historical museum, Museo de la Isla de
Cozumel, on Avenida Rafael Melgar between calles 4 and 6 Norte 
(% 987-872-1475). It’s more than just a nice place to spend a rainy hour.
The museum’s first floor has an exhibit displaying endangered species in
the area, the island’s origin, and its present-day topography and plant
and animal life, including an explanation of coral formation. The second-
floor galleries feature the town’s history, artifacts from the island’s pre-
Hispanic sites, and colonial-era relics like cannons, swords, and ship
paraphernalia. The museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Admission is $3; guided tours in English are free. A rooftop restaurant
serves breakfast and lunch.
Taking in the shops
If you like shopping for silver jewelry, you can spend a great deal of time
examining the wares of all the jewelers along Melgar who cater to cruise-
ship shoppers. Numerous duty-free stores sell items such as perfumes
and designer wares. If you’re interested in Mexican folk art, a number of
stores now display a wide variety of interesting pieces. Check out the fol-
lowing shops, all of which are on Melgar within a few blocks of the plaza:
 Los Cinco Soles (% 987-872-2040)
 Indigo (% 987-872-1076)
 Viva Mexico (% 987-872-5466)
Prices for serapes (cotton ponchos), T-shirts, and other tourist-type
goods are less expensive on the side streets off Melgar.
While you’re shopping in San Miguel, someone will probably approach
you to offer a deal in a timeshare apartment. Although investing in time-
shares is in many cases a bad idea, weighing financial decisions when
you’re in vacation mode is a really bad idea. Something about vacation-
ing makes people suspend their critical judgment. Don’t mix business
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya 
190

with pleasure. Wait until you’re back home, where you can do your
research, before entering the timeshare market.
Enjoying the nightlife
Cozumel is a town frequented by divers and other active visitors who
play hard all day and wind down at night. The nightlife scene is generally
low-key and peaks in the early evening. The cruise-ship crowd offers an
exception to this rule. On Sunday evenings, the place to be is the main
plaza, which usually hosts a free concert and has plenty of people
strolling about and visiting with friends. Most of the clubs along Avenida
Melgar have been slow to reopen after the hurricane. As of press time
the only one to open was Carlos ’n Charlie’s (% 987-869-1646), in the
little Punta Langosta Shopping Center in front of the pier of the same
name. Ask at the Tourism information kiosk in front to the municipal
pier about other options. If you want to see a movie, the multi-cinema
Cinépolis is on the south side of town off Melgar. It shows a lot of first-
run Hollywood films, usually in English, with Spanish subtitles.

Playa del Carmen and 
the Riviera Maya

T
he Riviera Maya is the area of the Yucatán Peninsula’s upper
Caribbean coast from just south of Cancún to the town of Tulum, 
a distance of 132km (82 miles). It’s a beautiful place with a mix of 
small resort communities, nature parks, small beach hotels, and large
all-inclusive resorts. A long reef system protects this coast and offers
many snorkeling and diving opportunities. Where there are gaps in 
the reef — Playa del Carmen, Xpu-Ha, and Tulum — you find the best
beaches. The action of the surf washes away silt and sea grass and
erodes rocks, leaving a sandy bottom. Where the reef is prominent, you
can expect good snorkeling just offshore with plenty of fish and other
sea life.
Playa del Carmen is the largest town in the Riviera Maya. In the last few
years, it has developed a kind of dual personality. Originally it was a
hideaway for hippies looking for an undeveloped piece of paradise — a
counterculture getaway clothed in native architecture with thatched
roofs, rustic clapboard, and adobe walls. Then the developers showed
up and built a resort community on the south side of town called
Playacar, complete with a golf course, condos, and large all-inclusive
hotels. The town continues to attract a lot of young people interested in
living the simple life and working only as much as necessary. Playa, as
the locals refer to it, is a fun place to stay, with plenty to do or not to 
do, and a lovely beach for those who choose the latter option. In the
evenings, people stroll down the town’s Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue)
shopping, choosing between the many restaurants and bars, or simply
enjoying the evening air.

Tulum is another booming town on this coast. It sprung up along the
highway near the ruins of the same name. Nearby is a beautiful beach
with small hotels and their thatched-roofed (cabañas or palapas) cabins
and small structures. Tulum marks the end of the Riviera Maya. South 
of here is a large natural preserve called Sian Ka’an and then the lower
Caribbean coast, which doesn’t have the same quality of beaches as the
upper coast.
The Riviera Maya has grown increasingly popular as its lodging and
dining options have multiplied. It also holds a wealth of attractions. In
fact, many of the day trips offered in Cancún are to places on this coast,
such as snorkeling tours; horseback riding; the nature parks of Xcaret
and Xel-Ha; and even the ruins of Tulum. Many Europeans have settled
here and set up small hotels and restaurants, lending the area a certain
cosmopolitan flavor. But this cosmopolitanism is spread throughout the
towns of this coast and not concentrated in an urban center such as
Cancún. In the Riviera Maya, you don’t find any skyscrapers or broad
boulevards. Staying here is a different experience from staying in
Cancún, adding to the choices that visitors to the Yucatán have.
In the summer and fall of 2005 the region was hit by two hurricanes.
Emily made landfall in the middle of the Riviera Maya, between Playa
and Tulum. It damaged hotels in Xpu-Ha, but left Tulum and Playa in
fairly good shape. The other was Wilma, which was much stronger and
wreaked havoc on Cozumel and Cancún, but didn’t make direct landfall
on this part of the coast. Most of the damage to the tourism infrastruc-
ture occurred north of Playa. Operations have since returned to normal
for the entire Riviera Maya.
Deciding Where to Stay
Choosing your lodging depends largely on personal taste and the kind of
vacation you have in mind. The Riviera Maya has just about any kind of
lodging option:
 Small, charming hotels in a town where you can interact with the
local residents and get a feel for what life is like in this part of the
world
 Villas and condos that rent by the week — a great option for a
family vacation or a group of friends
 Intimate cabaña hotels (cabins) on a beach far enough away from
the modern world that they have to generate their own electricity
or do without
 Large all-inclusives with all the modern conveniences, including
expansive pools, game rooms, and watersports equipment
 Small, private spa-resorts that pamper their guests
Chapter 15: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 193

In this chapter, I list some of my favorite hotels in the Riviera Maya,
including beach cabañas, inexpensive one-of-a-kind places, and even my
favorite secluded spa-resort. For more information about the different
towns and locations along this coast, see the “Settling into the Riviera
Maya” section, later in this chapter.
If you decide to stay in a hotel in Playa del Carmen, don’t hesitate to
choose a place that’s not on the beach. Town life here is a big part of the
fun, and staying on the beach in Playa has its disadvantages — such as
higher rates and the noise produced by a couple of the beachside bars.
And if you choose accommodations off the beach, you don’t have to
worry about not being able to find that perfect strip of sand. Beaches
are public property in Mexico, and you can lay out your towel anywhere
you like without anyone bothering you.
Near the town of Tulum, you can choose from about 30 cabaña hotels in
a “hotel zone” on the beach. These small hotels generate their own elec-
tricity. Only a few offer air-conditioning, and they charge more than the
small hotels in the other towns, but you avoid the large-resort feel and
the crowds, and you get to enjoy the area’s lovely white sand beaches. 
For families and groups of friends wishing to rent a condo or villa for a
week, the following Web sites are good places to start: Akumal Vacations
(www.akumalvacations.com), Caribbean Fantasy (www.caribbfan.
com), or Loco Gringo (www.locogringo.com). You can find rentals on
many parts of the coast, including an abundance in the town of Akumal,
which many families favor because it’s quieter and more convenient than
some of the booming towns such as Playa or Tulum. 
Also popular with families (and couples) are the all-inclusive hotels, 
of which there are more than 40 on this coast. All-inclusives are large
hotels that work with economies of scale to offer lodging, food, and
drink all for a single relatively low rate. See Chapter 7 for more details
about all-inclusive hotels and resorts.
The best way to get a room at an all-inclusive is by contacting a travel
agent who works with vacation packagers. You get a much better deal
than by contacting the hotel directly. Even if you have frequent-flier
miles to burn, you’ll still find it difficult to match the rates of a full 
package.
All-inclusives tend to look and feel alike, which is why I don’t include any
in the hotel reviews later in this chapter. Of the many all-inclusives in the
Riviera Maya, however, the following are my favorites:
 Aventura Spa Palace (% 984-875-1100; Fax: 984-875-1101; www.
palaceresorts.com) is a hotel in the Palace chain — this one 
is just for grown-ups. It has a large spa and gym and attractive
common areas and guest rooms. There is a large pool but no beach;
guests can take a shuttle to the Xpu-Ha property for beach access.
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya 
194

 The Copacabana Beach Resort in Xpu-Ha (% 984-875-1800; Fax:
984-875-1818; www.hotelcopacabana.com) has raised walkways
preserving much of the flora and making it visually interesting. And
Xpu-Ha is blessed with a stunning beach.
 Freedom Paradise (% 866-548-3995 or 998-887-1101; Fax: 998-887-
1102; www.freedomparadise.com) is billed as the first size-friendly
vacation resort. The management has worked hard to create an envi-
ronment that large people will find comfortable. I like it because it
doesn’t have all the froufrou of so many other resorts — it’s friendly
and unpretentious.
 Iberostar Quetzal or Tucan (% 984-877-2000; Fax: 984-873-0424;
www.iberostar.com): Of the several all-inclusives that are in Playa
del Carmen/Playacar, I like this one, which has two names for differ-
ent halves of the same hotel. The food is better than at most all-
inclusives, and the central part of the hotel is made of raised
walkways and terraces over the natural mangrove habitat. Its
neighbor, the Sandos Gala Playacar(% 984-877-4040; Fax: 984-
873-1169; www.sandoshotels.com.mx), is also a good choice.
 Also in Xpu-Ha is the Xpu-Ha Palace (% 984-875-1010; Fax: 984-
875-1012; www.palaceresorts.com), which is built on the grounds
of a failed nature park. It has some keen features including lagoons
and a jungle, and several facilities for kids, including a small croco-
dile hatchery. The hotel is spread out over a large area and neces-
sarily involves a good bit of walking, but this also makes it feel less
crowded.
Evaluating the Top Accommodations
In the following reviews, I note rack rates (the maximum that a hotel or
resort charges for a room) for two people spending one night in a double
room. For Christmas, rates will be higher than the standard high-season
rates. Prices quoted here include the 12 percent room tax. Please refer to
the Introduction of this book for an explanation of the price categories.
Hotels listed here have both air-conditioning and TVs, unless otherwise
indicated, and if the review doesn’t say anything to the contrary, you
can safely assume that you can walk directly out of your hotel and onto
the beach. 
Cabañas Ana y José
$$$–$$$$
Tulum
This is a tranquil escape that feels worlds away from the rest of civilization,
yet it provides sufficient creature comforts to make for a comfortable stay.
The beach in front of the hotel is pure white sand. The rock-walled cabañas
closest to the water (called “ocean front”) come with two double beds.
These are a little more rustic than the rest of the rooms. The second-floor
Chapter 15: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 195

“ocean view” rooms have been completely remodeled with marble coun-
tertops and marble tile floors and attractive bathrooms. They also have a
terrace or a balcony and one queen or two double beds. The gardenview
rooms are much like the “vista al mar” rooms but don’t face the sea. There
is 24-hour electricity for lights and ceiling fans, and for A/C in the eight
gardenview rooms that don’t catch the sea breezes. The hotel has a small
pool, one of the few on this part of the coast that does. A restaurant takes
care of meals. The hotel can have a rental car waiting for you at the Cancún
airport.

Akumal
This hotel’s rooms and garden bungalows, set along the pristine and tran-
quil Akumal Bay, are large and comfortable. The 40 Villas Maya bungalows
are simply and comfortably furnished and come with kitchenettes. The 21
rooms in the three-story beachfront hotel are more elaborately furnished.
They come with refrigerators and a king bed or two queen beds. Both the
bungalows and the rooms have tile floors and good-size bathrooms, but
neither have phones or TVs. A large pool on the grounds, a children’s activ-
ities program (during high season), two restaurants, and a bar round out
the facilities. You can also ask about two- and three-bedroom villas for rent.

Hotel Jungla Caribe
$$
Playa del Carmen
Located right in the heart of the Avenida 5 action, “La Jungla” is an imagi-
native place, with a highly stylized look that mixes neoclassical with
Robinson Crusoe. Its character perfectly keeps with the town’s quirkiness.
Owner Rolf Albrecht envisioned space and comfort for guests, so all but
eight of the standard rooms are large, with gray-and-black marble floors,
the occasional Roman column, and large bathrooms. Fifteen of the rooms
are suites. Catwalks connect the “tower” section of suites to the hotel. Take
a dip in an attractive pool in the courtyard beneath a giant Ramón tree.
Eight small rooms lack air-conditioning and are priced lower than the rates
listed here.

Hotel Lunata
$$
Playa del Carmen
The Lunata offers a combination of location, comfort, and attractiveness
that no other hotel in this category can beat. It’s built in hacienda style, with
cut stone and wrought iron, and is decorated in contemporary Mexican
colors. The rooms show a lot of polish, with good air-conditioning and nicely
finished bathrooms. They also come with a TV, a small fridge, and a safe.
The majority of rooms are deluxe, which are medium to large and come
with a king or two doubles. A complimentary continental breakfast is
served in the garden, and the third-story terrace makes a nice place to
hang out. This hotel is right on Avenida 5; if you like to go to bed early,
stay in a room in back.

Hotel Ojo de Agua

Puerto Morelos
This is a seaside hotel with modern rooms. Two three-story buildings
stand on the beach at a right angle to each other. Most rooms have bal-
conies and glass sliding doors. They’re simply furnished and clean. Most
rooms have two double beds or a double and a twin; those with one double
bed go for $10 less. Twenty-four rooms have air-conditioning, and 24 have
phones (not the same 24). “Studio” units have kitchenettes. A medium-size
pool and a restaurant are available. Service is friendly. You can set up snor-
keling and scuba trips with the hotel. Turn left when you get to the town
plaza and keep going; look for the sign.

La Posada del Capitán Lafitte

Between Playa del Carmen and Puerto Morelos
A large sign on the left side of Highway 307, 13km (8 miles) south of Puerto
Morelos, points you in the direction of La Posada del Capitán Lafitte. This
lovely seaside retreat sits on a solitary stretch of sandy beach. Here you
can enjoy being isolated while still having all the amenities of a relaxing
vacation. The one- and two-story white-stucco bungalows, which hold one
to four rooms, stretch across a powdery white beach (but the sea floor is
a little rocky). They’re small but comfortable, with tile floors; small, tiled
bathrooms; either two double beds or one king-size bed; and an ocean-
front porch. Twenty-nine bungalows have air-conditioning; the rest have
fans. The hotel offers transportation to and from the Cancún airport for
$50 per person (minimum of two passengers). Your room price includes
both breakfast and dinner, plus there’s a poolside grill and bar. Amenities
include a medium-size pool, watersports equipment, and a TV/game room.

Near Puerto Morelos
In the area around Puerto Morelos, four spa resorts offer different versions
of the hedonistic resort experience. All four pride themselves on their per-
sonal service, amenities, and spa and salon treatments. Being in the
Yucatán, they like to add the healing practices of the Maya, especially the
use of the steam bath known in Mexico as a temazcal. Of the four, this
resort has been around the longest. It has a gorgeous beach and beauti-
fully manicured grounds. Two- and three-story buildings contain the large
guest rooms; most have king beds. The small size makes for personal serv-
ice and a wonderful sense of escape.

Shangri-La Caribe
$$$$
Playa del Carmen
This hotel — a loose grouping of cabañas on one of the best beaches in
Playa — is hard to beat for sheer fun and leisure. And it’s far enough from
the center of town to be quiet yet convenient. The older, south side of the
hotel (the “Caribe” section) consists of one- and two-story cabañas. The
north (“Playa”) side has a few larger buildings, holding four to six rooms.
A preference for one or the other section is a matter of taste; the units in
both are similar in amenities, privacy, and price. The real difference in
price depends on the proximity to the water — beachfront, oceanview, or
gardenview. Many gardenview rooms (mostly in a third section called
“Pueblito”) have air-conditioning, which adds $6 to the price. All rooms
have a patio or porch complete with hammock. Most come with two
double beds, but a few have a king bed. Windows are screened, and ceil-
ing fans circulate the breeze. Book well in advance during high season.

Treetops

Playa del Carmen
Treetops not only offers a good price but also a good location — half a
block from the beach, and half a block from Avenida 5, which is just
enough distance to filter out the noise. The rooms at Treetops encircle a
pool, a small cenote, and a patch of preserved jungle that shades the hotel
and lends the proper tropical feel. Rooms are large and comfortable and
have air-conditioning, fans, refrigerators, and either balconies or patios.

Some of the upper rooms, especially the central suite, have the feel of a
treehouse. Two other suites are large, with fully loaded kitchenettes, and
would work well for groups of four.

Zamas
$$–$$$
Tulum
Zamas is a grouping of stylish beach cabañas located out on a rocky point
on the coast just south of Tulum. Each cabaña comes with a small porch
area and hammocks, a thatched roof, a large bathroom, and electricity.
Mosquito netting hangs over each bed. What the cabañas don’t have are
ceiling fans, which they generally don’t need. In this respect, the hotel’s
location is enviable in that there’s almost always a breeze. Rooms come
with a variety of bed combinations and are ranked in three categories: gar-
denview, oceanview, and beachfront. The gardenview rooms are a good
deal. There are two types of beachfront. The small beachfront is exactly
that, and that’s why it’s a little less expensive than the other rooms. The
oceanview rooms are extra-large upstairs units, with wonderful terraces.
They could easily accommodate four people. Note that the rooms don’t
have air-conditioning, TV, or phones. The hotel’s restaurant has great food.
There’s a slight increase in rates for the month of August.

Settling into the Riviera Maya
For getting through customs and immigration at the Cancún airport, see
Chapter 11. The airport is located well south of Cancún, so you don’t
have to go through the city to get to Playa or the Riviera Maya. If you’re
driving, follow the signs for Puerto Morelos/Playa del Carmen as you
exit the airport. Turn right (south) on Highway 307. For more specific
directions on entering Playa or going farther south, see “Getting around
the area,” later in this chapter.
Another option is to take a bus that travels straight from the airport to
Playa. After you arrive in Playa, you can catch a bus to any of the major
towns along the coast. Turn right after you exit the airport (you walk by 
a long line of counters with people offering you all kinds of services and
info — keep right on walking). Walk to the other side of the airport’s main
entrance. Look for buses labeled Autobuses Riviera in large letters. They
offer direct service more than 12 times a day. Cost is $9 one-way.

The Riviera Maya
Chapter 15: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 201

Knowing where to go
If you know where to go, knowing how to get there is easy. The Riviera
Maya is a coast with one highway, and anyplace you’re heading is going
to be either north or south of the place you’re coming from. Here’s a list
of all the major towns and attractions north to south from the Cancún
airport to Tulum:
 Puerto Morelos: This sleepy little village has a few small hotels and
rental houses. Locals refer to it as “Muerto Morelos” (Dead Morelos)
during the off season for the lack of activity. It’s a short distance from
the bustle of Cancún and Playa del Carmen, and can be considered a
convenient escape from the crowds, perfect for a relaxed vacation of
lying about the beach and reading a book (with perhaps the occa-
sional foray into a watersport or two). The coast is sandy and well
protected by an offshore reef, which means good snorkeling and
diving nearby, but plenty of sea grass is on the beach and in the
water.
 Playa del Carmen: The largest town on this coast, Playa’s got the
best restaurants and the most nightlife. It also has a beautiful
beach. It’s a popular destination, not a place to find solitude.
 Xcaret: Just 7km (41⁄3 miles) south of Playa del Carmen is a large
nature park. It draws people from Cancún, Cozumel, and all points
along this coast. Highlights include floating through an under-
ground river (not for everybody), nightly shows, and loads of sea-
side activities. Chapter 13 has more details about this park.
 Puerto Aventuras: A modern marina community with tons of
condos and a few hotels, I don’t care much for staying here, but it’s
a good place to hook up with sportfishing outfits or to try a swim
with dolphins. See the section, “Having Fun on and off the Beach,”
later in this chapter, for more info.
 Xpu-Ha: This broad beautiful beach with private houses and a few
large all-inclusives is a great place to stay for sun worshipers and a
good place to go for the day. There’s a smattering of beach restau-
rants and some villas and cabins for rent.
 Akumal: This small, modern, and ecologically oriented community
is built on the shores of Akumal Bay and Half-Moon Bay. It’s mostly
made up of two-story villas, and a few hotels — all on the water. It’s
a lot quieter than Playa and is good for families.
 Xel-Ha: A large, well-protected lagoon is the centerpiece for this
lovely eco-park. It attracts crowds of snorkelers who come to view
the fish in the calm, clear waters. The park also offers dolphin
swims and a small grouping of ruins. Check out Chapter 13 for more
details about this location.
 Tulum: The town of Tulum is on the highway 132km (82 miles) from
Cancún, just south of the ruins of the same name. It has a hotel dis-
trict about 3km (2 miles) away on the coast where about 30 small
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya 
202

hotels are lined up along a beautiful beach. Most of these hotels
generate their own electricity and can’t provide basics such as air-
conditioning or phones. Most have small restaurants, and the town
itself has at least a dozen more. Construction is booming, both in
the town and along the coast. But you can enjoy the beach here in
solitude and quiet (unless your hotel is busy building additional
rooms). Of course, the downside of peace and quiet is that Tulum
doesn’t have the variety of restaurants that Playa and Cancún do.
Keeping some cash on hand when traveling this coast is always a good
idea. Outside of Playa del Carmen, you don’t find many cash machines.
In the smaller towns and resorts and at some gas stations, you often
can’t pay with a credit card. Puerto Morelos has just one ATM in the
town and another on the highway at the turnoff junction. After Playa del
Carmen, the next cash machines are in Tulum (two). Also, if you’re driv-
ing, keep some gas in the tank; the coast south of Puerto Aventuras can
sometimes experience power failures that last a day, and after the power
returns, there can be long lines for gas and cash.
Getting around the area
A single road, Highway 307, runs the length of the Riviera Maya. From
the Cancún airport to Playa del Carmen (51km/32 miles), it’s a four-lane
divided highway with speed limits up to 110kmph (68 mph). There are 
a couple of traffic lights and several reduced-speed zones around the
major turnoffs.
As you approach Playa, two extra lanes are added each way and then
divide up. To enter Playa stay in the left lanes so that you can make a left
at one of the traffic lights. If you don’t stay left, you have to pass through
and keep going until you find a turnaround. The main entrances to the
town are Avenida Constituyentes, which works for destinations in north-
ern Playa, and Avenida Juárez, leading to the town’s main square.
From Playa to Tulum (80km/50 miles), the road becomes a smooth two-
lane highway with wide shoulders. Speed limits are a little lower, with
more spots that require you to reduce your speed.
Faster traffic on this stretch of road will often move into the middle of
the road when passing (as if there were a center lane). Oncoming traffic
moves to the right to make room for the passing vehicle. You do the
same, but keep a lookout for cyclists on the shoulder. When making a
left turn where there is no left-turn lane, move to the shoulder and stop
and wait for a gap in the traffic to cross the road. Don’t stop in the main
lane of the highway! In some places, use the right-hand turnoff that
curves around, and then cross the highway at a right angle. Also, all
these potential hazards make driving at night especially challenging.
(And it gets dark early on this coast.)
You may notice many buses running along this stretch of highway, but I
prefer renting a car because many buses stop only in the larger towns or
Chapter 15: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 203

Area Code
The telephone area code for most of the
Riviera Maya is 984. The exception is
Puerto Morelos and its surroundings, which
has the 998 area code.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
There are several banks in Playa with
ATMs, along with several money-exchange
houses. Many of these offices are located
close to the pier and along Avenida 5 at
Calle 8. There’s an ATM in Puerto Morelos
and one at the highway turnoff for the town
(beside the pharmacy). You can also use
the two ATMs and one bank in Tulum.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (10 a.m.–2 p.m. and 4–8
p.m. daily), but shops remain open through-
out the day. Offices tend to close on
Saturday and Sunday. Shops are usually
open on Saturday but still generally respect
the tradition of closing on Sunday. During
peak season, many shops remain open until
9 or even 10 p.m.
Internet Access
There are cybercafes and Internet
providers in all the major towns, including
quite a few in Playa. Prices are cheap.
Medical
For serious medical attention, go to
Hospiten in Cancún. In Playa, Dr. Jorge
Mercado is a capable general practitioner
who speaks English. His office is at the
corner of avenidas 10 and Constituyentes
(% 984-873-3908).
Pharmacy
The Farmacia del Carmen (% 984-873-2330),
on Avenida Juárez between avenidas 5 and
10, is open 24 hours.
Post Office
The post office is on Avenida Principal, 
3 blocks north of the plaza on the right 
after the Hotel Playa del Carmen and the
launderette.
Taxes
There’s a 15 percent IVA (value-added tax)
on goods and services, which is generally
included in the posted price.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
by using a Telmex (LADATEL) prepaid phone
card, available at most pharmacies and
mini-supers, using the official Telmex 
(Lada) public phones. Remember, in
Mexico, you need to dial 001 prior to a
number to reach the United States, and you
need to preface long-distance calls within
Mexico by dialing 01.
Time Zone
The Riviera Maya operates on central stan-
dard time.

they leave you a half-mile from the beach. Playa has any number of
rental agencies. Reserving a car before getting to Mexico is usually
cheaper than waiting until after you arrive (see Chapter 9).
Fast Facts: Riviera Maya and 
Playa del Carmen

Dining along the Riviera Maya
Every town in the Riviera Maya has at least a few restaurants where 
you can get good, if not outstanding, food. But Playa del Carmen is the
exception; it has an impressive number and variety of restaurants for a
town its size. The European influence is quite noticeable, especially with
Italian restaurants. With so many options available, this section lists only
my favorites in Playa. In most other places, your choices will be so lim-
ited, you won’t be struggling with any tough decisions.
 In Puerto Morelos, the best and most expensive restaurant in town
is John Grey’s (open only for dinner, closed Sun; % 998-871-0449),
which is a couple of blocks north of the plaza and a couple inland.
The owner is a former chef for the Ritz-Carlton. On the same street
as John Grey’s is a more economical restaurant that’s open for
lunch and dinner called Bodo’s (% 998-871-0232) The rest of my
suggestions are on or around the main square and include Los
Pelicanos for overpriced seafood (% 998-871-0014); Hola Asia for
Asian food (% 998-871-0679); and Le Café d’Amancia for coffee
and pastries (% 998-850-4110).
 Puerto Aventuras has a large open area beside the dolphin pool
(see “Swimming with dolphins,” later in this chapter) with chairs
and tables and a half dozen restaurants where you can get anything
from steaks to pizza to pub grub. None is outstanding, but all are
passable.
 In Akumal, many people rent villas and cook for themselves (there’s
a convenient grocery store called Super Chomak at the entrance to
town). There are also a few restaurants: the Turtle Bay Café and
Bakery (no phone) is my favorite spot for breakfast or a light
lunch, La Buena Vida for dinner or a drink (% 984-875-9061).
 Tulum has a few good restaurants with reasonable prices. In the
town proper is Charlie’s (% 984-871-2136), my favorite for Mexican
food, and Don Cafeto’s (% 984-871-2207), also Mexican. Both places
are on the main street. There’s a great, authentic Italian restaurant
called Il Giardino di Toni e Simone (% 044-984-804-1316, a cell-
phone; closed Wed), 1 block off the highway. Look for a large build-
ing-supply store called ROCA — the restaurant is on the opposite
side of the road 1 block away. A couple of roadside places grill
chicken and serve it with rice and beans for an economical lunch. 
In the hotel zone, try the food at Zamas.
Please refer to the Introduction of this book for an explanation of the
price categories that I use in the following listings. Remember that tips
generally run about 15 percent and most waitstaff really depend on gra-
tuities for their income, so be generous if the service warrants.
Please see Appendix C for more information on Mexican cuisine.

Playa del Carmen
NORTHERN ITALIAN
Tucked away on a quiet little patio off Avenida 5, this small, homey restau-
rant serves excellent food. The owners, Maurizio Gabrielli and Mary
Michelon, are usually there to greet customers and make recommenda-
tions. They came to Mexico to enjoy the simple life, and this inclination
shows in the restaurant’s welcoming, unhurried atmosphere. The menu is
mostly northern Italian, with several dishes from the rest of the country as
well as daily specials. They make their pastas (except penne and spaghetti)
in-house, and they aren’t precooked. Try fish and shrimp ravioli or penne
alla Veneta. You can choose from several wines, mostly Italian. The salads
are good and are carefully prepared — dig in without hesitation.

MEXICAN/ITALIAN
For dependable food in an advantageous spot for people-watching, try this
restaurant. It’s simple outdoor dining on Avenida 5 — comfortable chairs
and tables under palapa umbrellas that’s not noisy, and the Italian owner
is vigilant about maintaining quality and consistency. He offers an excellent
sopa de lima, a large seafood pasta, grilled shrimp with herbs, and Tex-
Mex specialties such as chili and fajitas. The hot sauces are good.

EUROPEAN/MEXICAN
This new arrival to Playa offers some of the best of both Old and New Worlds.
What I tried was delicious — chicken in a wonderfully scented sauce of fine
herbs accompanied by fettuccine, and a well-made tortilla soup listed as sopa
mexicana. There are a number of cool and light dishes that would be appe-
tizing for lunch or an afternoon meal; for example, an avocado stuffed with
shrimp and flavored with a subtle horseradish sauce on a bed of alfalfa
sprouts and julienned carrots. For dinner try the grilled seafood platter for
two. The dining area is upstairs under a large and airy palapa roof.

SEAFOOD/BREAKFAST
“The restaurant that was born with the town,” proclaims the sign outside
this establishment. Locals also recommend this restaurant as the best 
for seafood. It’s right on the beach, and the water practically laps at the
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya

foundations. Because the owners are fishermen, the fish is so fresh that
it’s practically still wiggling. The wood hut doesn’t look like much, but you
can have your fish prepared in several ways here. If you haven’t tried the
Yucatecan specialty tik-n-xic fish (baked fish in a spicy barbecue-style
sauce), this would be a good place to do so. Tarraya is on the beach oppo-
site the basketball court.

VEGETARIAN/SEAFOOD
This restaurant has an outstanding and eclectic menu that favors grilled
seafood, sautés, and pasta dishes with inventive combinations of ingredi-
ents. Everything I had was quite fresh and prepared beautifully, taking
inspiration from various culinary traditions — Italian, Mexican, and
Japanese. Keep an eye on the daily specials. The restaurant also makes
sandwiches and salads, black-bean quesadillas, and crepes. The restau-
rant is open-air, and the décor is primitive-tropical chic.

MAYA/YUCATECAN
The menu here makes use of many native foods and spices to produce a
style of cooking different from what you usually get when ordering
Yucatecan food. You find such things as a cream of chaya (a native leafy
vegetable), or xcatic chile (a regional variety of chile pepper) stuffed with
savory pit-baked pork called cochinita pibil. I also like the classic fruit
salad, done Mexican style with lime juice and dried powdered chile. The
menu is varied and includes a lot of seafood dishes, and the ones I had
were fresh and well prepared.

Having Fun on and off the Beach
The Riviera Maya is an ideal destination for people who like being active
and exploring new lands. The region has Maya ruins, caves, crystal-clear
underground rivers (cenotes), and fascinating flora and fauna to see,
plus plenty of options for scuba diving and snorkeling.
Scuba and snorkeling
For scuba diving in Puerto Morelos, contact Victor Reyes, the English-
speaking owner of Mystic Divers (% 998-871-0634). He knows the local
dive spots well and is quite accommodating. His shop is on the main
Chapter 15: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 207

square. You can also arrange a snorkeling tour here, or ask at the Hotel
Ojo de Agua. The reef in front of Puerto Morelos has been declared 
a national park and is protected. It is quite shallow and perfect for 
snorkeling.
In Playa del Carmen, contact Tank-Ha Dive Center (% 984-873-0302;
www.tankha.com). It’s on Playa’s Avenida 5 between calles 8 and 10. You
can arrange both reef and cavern diving here, plus snorkeling trips.
Akumal has been the main diving center on this coast for quite some
time. It was the base of operations of a group known as CEDAM, who
became widely known for discovering an old Spanish shipwreck com-
plete with treasure. At least 30 dive sites are offshore near Akumal. The
oldest dive operator in town is the Akumal Dive Shop (% 984-875-9032;
www.akumal.com). In addition to the usual certification courses, it offers
cavern diving and technical diving instruction.
Cavern diving is big here because the Yucatán has so many underground
rivers, especially around the lower Riviera Maya. If you want to try diving
or snorkeling in caverns, the easiest and most fun way is to go to Hidden
Worlds Cenotes (% 984-877-8535; www.hiddenworlds.com.mx). It’s 2km
(11⁄4 miles) south of Xel-Ha on the right side of the road. You can easily
spot the sign. Here, you can rent all the gear including a wet suit (the
water is a bit chilly) and tour two caverns. These caverns were filmed for
the IMAX production, Journey into Amazing Caves. The snorkel tour with
gear costs $40 and takes you to two different caverns. The main form of
transportation is by truck with a guide who throws in tidbits of informa-
tion and lore about the jungle plant life that you see. Prepare to do some
walking, so take shoes or sandals.
For easy-going snorkeling in warmer water, try the nature parks, espe-
cially Xel-Ha, which has scads of fish and rays. For more information on
the nature parks, see Chapter 13.
Swimming with dolphins
You can swim with dolphins at two of the nature parks on this coast —
Xel-Ha and Xcaret (see Chapter 13) — or you can do so in Puerto
Aventuras. An excellent outfit called Dolphin Discovery (% 998-849-
4757; www.dolphindiscovery.com) does a first-rate job of getting people
in contact with these marvelous creatures. An hour-long session costs
$125. Make your reservations well ahead of time using the Web site.
Swimming with dolphins has its critics and supporters. You may want to
visit the Whale and Dolphins Conservation Society’s Web site at www.
wdcs.org. For more information about responsible travel in general,
check out these Web sites: Tread Lightly (www.treadlightly.org) and
the International Ecotourism Society (www.ecotourism.org).
Part IV: Cozumel and the Riviera Maya 
208

Gone fishing
Puerto Aventuras is also the main hangout for fishing. Your best bet for
deep-sea fishing is Capt. Rick’s Sportfishing Center (% 984-873-5195 or
984-873-5387; www.fishyucatan.com). The best fishing on this coast is
from March to August. The captain can combine a fishing trip with some
snorkeling, which makes for a leisurely day.
Getting in touch with nature
The Riviera Maya also provides plenty to do for landlubbers. To start,
the ruins of Tulum are easy to get to and interesting to view; for more
information, check out Chapter 13.
If you want to see some of the jungle, try out rappelling, or get to know a
contemporary Maya community, contact Alltournative (% 984-873-2036;
www.alltournative.com), or book one of its tours through your hotel or
a local travel agency. They do small groups and use vans to pick you up at
almost any hotel in the Riviera Maya. Most of their tours combine a little
adventure with some of the local culture and natural history. The guides
are quite professional.
If you want to see more of the region’s natural habitat, you can arrange a
trip to the Sian Ka’an Biosphere to see a great variety of birds and sea
life, and with a little luck, some of the rarer forest critters. In Tulum, con-
tact Sian Ka’an Tours (% 984-871-2362; siankaan_tours@hotmail.
com). This company offers two kinds of tours to the preserve. The office
is on the town’s main street Avenida Tulum at the corner of Calle Beta,
next door to El Basilico Italian restaurant.
On the highway between Akumal and Xel-Ha is the turnoff for an interest-
ing large cavern called Aktun Chen. You explore the cavern by guided
tour ($18 adults, $10 for children 6–12). It takes 45 minutes and involves
a good bit of walking. The cavern is well lit and has good footing. On the
park’s grounds are a number of local species of fauna, including spider
monkeys. Chapter 13 has a bit more detail about Aktun Chen.
Several outfits along the road offer horseback riding. The best is 6.4km
(4 miles) south of Xcaret. It’s called Rancho Punta Venado. It’s less
touristy than other places, and the owner takes good care of his horses.
It also offers kayaking and snorkeling. The best way to contact them is
through e-mail: gabriela@puntavenado.com. Or you can try the cell-
phone: % 044-984-806-4818. The entrance is 2km (11⁄4 miles) south of
the overpass at Puerto Calica. 
Teeing off and playing tennis
Your best option for chasing a little white ball and whacking a larger,
yellow one is the Playacar Golf Club immediately south of Playa del
Carmen. It is owned by the Palace Resorts chain (www.palace-resorts.
com). They sell all-inclusive golf packages. The course was designed by
Chapter 15: Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya 209

Robert Von Hagge. If you don’t sign up for the package, greens fees are
$180 in the morning (includes golf cart) and $120 after 2 p.m. Two tennis
courts are also available at the club at a rate of $10 per hour.
Going shopping
Playa del Carmen offers the most opportunity for shopping in the area —
along its popular Avenida 5. This pedestrian-only street is lined with
dozens of small, trendy shops selling imported batik (Balinese-style)
clothing, Guatemalan-fabric clothing, premium tequilas, Cuban cigars,
masks, pottery, hammocks, and a few T-shirts. Throw in a couple of
tattoo parlors, and you complete the mix. A smattering of interesting
shops can be found in some of the smaller towns, and some large jewelry
and rug stores line the highway.
Enjoying the nightlife
It seems like everyone in Playa is out on Avenida 5 or on the square until
10 or 11 p.m. Pleasant strolls, meals and drinks at street-side cafes,
shops, and bars with live music make up Playa’s nightlife. Down by the
ferry dock is a Señor Frog’s (% 984-873-0930), with its patented mix of
thumping dance music, gelatin shots, and fraternity-house antics; it’s on
the beach at Calle 4. The real beach bar in Playa is at the Blue Parrot
(% 984-873-0083), and it has quite a following.
I’ve been hearing a lot of complaints about timeshare salespersons on
this stretch of coast lately — more than the usual amount. Some com-
plaints describe tactics that could almost be considered hostage-taking.
I’ve also heard of people being stranded on the highway after they’ve
declined to buy. Don’t mix business with pleasure.

Chapter 16
The Lowdown on Puerto
Vallarta’s Hotel Scene
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Getting the scoop on hotel locations
 Sizing up Puerto Vallarta’s top hotel choices
P
uerto Vallarta maintains a small-town charm despite offering its
visitors a range of sophisticated hotels, great restaurants, a thriving
arts community, an active nightlife, and a growing variety of ecotourism
attractions. With its traditional Mexican architecture and gold-sand
beaches bordered by jungle-covered mountains, Vallarta is currently
the second-most visited resort in Mexico (trailing only Cancún).
Most of the luxury hotels and shopping centers have sprung up to the
north and south of the original town, allowing Vallarta to grow and
become a sizable city of 250,000 without sacrificing its considerable
charms. This growth pattern has made it possible for Vallarta to provide
visitors with the services and infrastructure of a modern city while
retaining the feel of a peaceful Mexican village.
In this chapter, I review the main parts of town, the types of hotel rooms
you’re likely to find in each place, and the pros and cons of staying in
each area. Then I review some of my favorite places to stay in Puerto
Vallarta. The selection is so varied that, regardless of your taste or
budget, you’re sure to find a perfect fit for a satisfying vacation.
Choosing a Location
The part of town you choose to stay in usually impacts your overall vaca-
tion experience, although everything is relatively close by and getting
around is easy and inexpensive. The term Vallarta actually encompasses

the entire area that borders Bahía de Banderas (Banderas Bay) — an
84km (52-mile) stretch of coastline that extends through two Mexican
states. My hotel recommendations extend through this entire area as well.
Nuevo Vallarta and the northern coast
Traveling north from the airport (Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International
Airport), you first come to Nuevo Vallarta. Many people assume
Nuevo Vallarta is a section of Puerto Vallarta, but it’s really a stand-
alone destination located in the state of Nayarit. It’s a mega-resort 
development — complete with marina, two golf courses, and luxury
hotels. Most of the hotels here are all-inclusive, located on one of the
widest, most attractive beaches on the bay. Two lengthy entrance roads
from the highway pass by fields that are great for bird-watching and nearby
lagoons that are great for kayaking. The Paradise Plaza shopping center
(next to the Paradise Village resort) has added a lot to the area in terms
of shopping, dining, and services. In addition, there are two golf courses:
the Mayan Palace Golf Club and the El Tigre course of Paradise Village.
Visitors to Nuevo Vallarta usually plan to travel the distance into Puerto
Vallarta (about 30 min. and $15 by cab) for anything other than poolside
and beach action — options for dining and other diversions outside the
Nuevo Vallarta hotels remain limited, but are getting better. Taxis are
available 24 hours a day. A regularly scheduled public-bus service runs
between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily and costs about $1.50 for a one-way trip.
Bucerías, a small beachfront village of cobblestone streets, villas, and
small hotels, is farther north along Bahía de Banderas, 19km (12 miles)
beyond the airport. Past Bucerías, following the curved coastline of
Bahía de Banderas, is Punta Mita. Once a truly rustic village of fisher-
men and bamboo houses, Punta Mita has developed its own identity as
a luxury destination. Three super-exclusive, luxury-boutique resorts, a
Chopra Center and Spa, numerous private villas (many available for
rent), and two golf courses either exist or are in the works. As of 2006,
only the Four Seasons Resort (see review later in this chapter) and its
adjacent Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course are open, but the St. Regis
Resort, La Solana Resort, Chopra Center, and a second Jack Nicklaus golf
course will be completed by 2007. This spot of white-sand beaches and
clear waters was once home to an ancient celestial observatory, and you
can’t imagine a more exquisite setting. Punta Mita is a departure from
the other beaches in the area.
Marina Vallarta
If you head south from the airport, the first area you come to is Marina
Vallarta, a resort city within Puerto Vallarta, located on the immediate
right as you come into town from the airport. Guests here feel a world
apart from the quaintness of downtown Puerto Vallarta. Marina Vallarta
has the most modern luxury hotels of any area in town, plus a huge
marina with 450 yacht slips, a golf course, restaurants and bars, and 
several shopping plazas.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
214

Because the area began life as a swamp and was later filled in for devel-
opment, the beaches are the least desirable in the area, with darker sand
and seasonal inflows of cobblestones washing down from the mountains
and rivers and then up on the beaches. However, the exquisite pools at
the oceanfront hotels more than make up for this shortcoming.
The Marina Vallarta Club de Golf (% 322-221-0073), an 18-hole golf
course designed by Joe Finger, is within walking distance of most of the
hotels. (See Chapter 19 for more information on golf and other activities
in Puerto Vallarta.)
Although this isn’t the area of choice if you’re a true beach aficionado,
Marina Vallarta is nice for families and for vacationers looking for lots of
centralized activity. The complex is attractive and clean, and the public
transportation is good. If you choose to travel by taxi, going from Marina
to downtown Puerto Vallarta takes about 20 minutes, which is due to
traffic more than distance, and costs about $7.
Hotel Zone
The next area you encounter heading south from the airport toward
town is known as the Hotel Zone because of all the high-rise hotels
located side-by-side along the main roadway. Here, the main street run-
ning between the airport and town is called Avenida Francisco Medina
Ascencio, but it’s sometimes referred to as Avenida de las Palmas for
the stately palm trees that line the strip of land that divides the road.
The tourism boom that Vallarta enjoyed in the mid-1970s gave birth to
the hotels that line this road, and most of them have been exceptionally
well maintained. All the hotels offer excellent, wide beachfronts with
generally tranquil waters for swimming. This area is home to more
casual, less expensive hotels that offer a great beach as a bonus.
The long and wide stretch of golden beach fronting the Hotel Zone has
smoother sand and more watersports concessions than either Marina
Vallarta or downtown. Although many shopping plazas line the main
road in front of the hotels, they mostly service the large residential 
community to the east. You find the most interesting restaurants and
intriguing shops downtown or back in Marina, but from the Hotel Zone,
you’re only a quick taxi or bus ride away from either of these areas.
El Centro Vallarta
Few beach resorts in Mexico offer what Puerto Vallarta exudes — the
feeling that you’re actually in Mexico. Staying in the central downtown
area provides the charm of a traditional village and proximity to a tropi-
cal beach. Sophisticated services, all classes and types of restaurants,
sizzling nightspots, and enough shops and galleries to tempt even the
most jaded consumers are contained within the cobblestone streets and
welcoming atmosphere of the central town.
Chapter 16: The Lowdown on Puerto Vallarta’s Hotel Scene 215

Cool breezes flow down from the mountains along the Río Cuale
(Cuale River), which runs through the center of town. The boardwalk,
or malecón, that borders the main waterfront street boasts fanciful
public sculptures, lively restaurants, shops, bars — and timeshare sales
booths. The malecón is a magnet for both residents and visitors who
walk its length while taking in the ocean breeze, a gorgeous sunset, or a
perfect, moonlit night.
Accommodations here may be older, but most are inexpensive and gener-
ally well kept — plus they have plenty of character. In addition to being
able to reach any downtown destination on foot, the neighborhood is as
safe as it is charming.
Just south of downtown, the Playa Los Muertos area has recently under-
gone a renaissance. It’s now not only a place offering great values in
accommodations, dining, and nightlife, but also an added plus for the
Los Muertos neighborhood is that it also has funky charm, which you
can experience in the sidewalk cafes, great restaurants, and casual
nightspots. Economically priced hotels and good-value guesthouses
dominate accommodations here. Another bonus for the Los Muertos
neighborhood is that most of Vallarta’s nightlife activity is now centered
in the areas south of the Río Cuale and along Olas Altas.
The southern shore
Hillsides dotted with private villas and a few large hotels border the
coastal highway. Immediately south of town lies the exclusive residential
and rental district of Conchas Chinas. La Jolla de Mismaloya resort lies
10km (6 miles) south of town on Playa Mismaloya (where The Night of
the Iguana was filmed). No roads service the southern shoreline of Bahía
de Banderas, but three small coastal villages are popular attractions for
visitors to Puerto Vallarta: Las Animas, Quimixto, and Yelapa, which are
all accessible only by boat. Many visitors mistakenly believe that these
villages are islands, but they’re actually located along the same coast.
Yelapa offers some rustic accommodations in addition to making a great
destination for an enjoyable day trip (see Chapter 19 for more on things
to see and do in Yelapa). Las Animas and Quimixto don’t offer any
accommodations.
Beyond a varied selection of hotels, Puerto Vallarta has many other
types of accommodations. Oceanfront or marina-view condominiums
and elegant private villas are also available; both options can offer a
better value and more ample space for families or small groups. For
more information on short-term rentals, check out the Web site at www.
virtualvallarta.com, which lists a selection of rental options. Prices
start at $99 a night for non-beachfront condos and go up to $1,000 for
penthouse condos or private villas. Susan Wiseman’s Bayside Properties,
Francisca Rodríguez 160, at the corner of Olas Altas (% 322-223-4424 or
222-8148; www.baysidepropertiespv.com), rents gay-friendly condos,
villas, and hotels for individuals and large groups. She can arrange

Puerto Vallarta’s Best Accommodations
For each hotel, I include specific rack rates for two people spending one
night in a double room during high season (Christmas to Easter) unless
otherwise indicated. Rack rates simply mean published rates and tend
to be the highest rates paid — you can do better, especially if you’re 
purchasing a package that includes airfare (see Chapter 7 for tips on
avoiding paying rack rates). Prices quoted here include the 17 percent
room tax. Please refer to the Introduction of this book for an explanation
of the price categories.
It’s not unusual for many hotels to double their normal rates during
Christmas and Easter weeks, but low-season rates can be anywhere
from 20 percent to 60 percent below high-season rates. Note: Some
rates may seem much higher than others, but many of these rates are
“all-inclusive” — meaning that your meals and beverages are included in
the price of your stay. All-inclusive rates also take into account all tips
and taxes and most activities and entertainment.
All hotels listed here have both air-conditioning and TVs, unless other-
wise indicated.
Casa Tres Vidas
$$$$$
South Shore/Conchas Chinas
Terraced down a hillside to Playa Conchas Chinas, Casa Tres Vidas is actu-
ally three individual villas that make a great — and affordable — place to
stay for families or groups of friends. Set on a stunning private cove, Tres
Vidas provides the experience of having your own private villa — complete
with service staff. Under new ownership since 2000, Tres Vidas has been
upgraded in furnishings and amenities, and it’s an outstanding value for
the location (close to town), sweeping panoramic views from every room,
and excellent personal service. Each of the three villas has at least two
levels, more than 465 sq. m (5,000 sq. ft.) of mostly open-design living area,
a private swimming pool, a heated whirlpool, and air-conditioned bed-
rooms. (Because the layout is so open, the rest of the rooms don’t have
air-conditioning.) The Villa Alta penthouse villa has three bedrooms, plus
a rooftop deck with pool and bar. Vida Sol, the center villa, has a 5.4m-high
(18-ft.) domed living room with fireplace, and features graceful arches and
columns. Although it has three bedrooms, it can sleep ten — two of the
bedrooms have two king-size beds in them. Directly on the ocean, Vida
Mar is a four-bedroom villa that can accommodate eight guests. An added
bonus: Meals are prepared in your villa twice a day — you only pay for the
Chapter 16: The Lowdown on Puerto Vallarta’s Hotel Scene 217

cost of the food, and you choose the menu. Casa Tres Vidas is owned and
managed by the owners of the adjacent Quinta María Cortez (see review
later in this chapter).

Dreams Puerto Vallarta
$$$$–$$$$$
South Shore/Conchas Chinas
Formerly the Camino Real, this original luxury hotel in Puerto Vallarta was
taken over by AMResorts in 2004 and turned into the premium all-inclusive
Dreams Resort. It unquestionably has the nicest beach of any Vallarta
hotel — soft, white sand and a private cove. On the beach, numerous shade
palapas are available, along with a chair, towels, and food and beverage
service. Both the nature of the geography and the physical boundaries set
it apart from other properties — with a lush mountain backdrop, Dreams
retains the exclusivity that made it popular from the beginning — yet it’s
only a five- to ten-minute ride to town. The hotel consists of two buildings:
the 250-room main hotel, which curves gently as it traces the shape of the
Playa Las Estacas, and a newer, 11-story tower, also facing the beach and
ocean. An ample pool with an in-pool bar fronts the main building and
faces the beach. Standard rooms in the main building are large. Some of
the rooms have sliding doors that open onto the beach, and others have
balconies. The standard rooms in the tower feature balconies with
whirlpool tubs. All rooms are decorated in vibrant colors, with marble
floors and artwork by locally renowned artist Manuel Lepe. In 2004, all
rooms were completely renovated, with additions including two new swim-
ming pools (including an adults-only tranquillity pool), a wedding gazebo,
and upgraded health club and spa. For the young travelers, the Explorer’s
Club for Kids has a program of daily activities, based on science, nature,
and exploring, certain to keep them entertained.

Fiesta Americana Puerto Vallarta
$$$$
Hotel Zone
The Fiesta Americana’s towering, three-story, thatched-palapa lobby is a
landmark in the Hotel Zone, but this hotel is even better known for its
excellent beach and friendly service. The nine-story, terra-cotta-colored
building embraces a large plaza with a big pool and bar area facing the
beach. Marble-trimmed rooms in neutral tones with pastel accents come
with carved headboards and comfortable rattan and wicker furniture. All
rooms have private balconies with ocean and pool views. In addition to

Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita
$$$$$
Punta Mita
Located on the undisputed best beach in the area, this boutique hotel art-
fully combines seclusion and pampered service with a welcoming sense
of comfort. The 113 rooms and 27 suites are in three-story casitas (little
houses), which surround the main building where the lobby, cultural
center, restaurants, and pool are located. The stretch of beachfront is the
only white-sand beach in the bay, due to a coral reef located just offshore,
which also makes the water a dreamy and translucent shade of aquama-
rine. Every guest room offers an ocean view from a large terrace or bal-
cony. Most suites also offer a private plunge pool, as well as a separate
sitting room. Room interiors are plush and spacious with a king or two
double beds, a seating area, and an oversized bathroom with a deep soak-
ing tub, a separate glass-enclosed shower, and a dual-vanity sink. This is
the place to go to completely get away from it all, but remember that
you’re at least 45 minutes from Puerto Vallarta’s activities. For most guests,
this isn’t a problem — the Four Seasons is so relaxing and comfortable
that thinking of anyplace else is hard. The centerpiece of the resort is the
18-hole (with an optional 19th hole of play on a natural island) Jack
Nicklaus Signature golf course. The course has ocean views from every
hole, and eight holes border the ocean. A full-service spa, complete tennis
center, and watersports center — including guided surf trips and lessons —
round out the activities. In addition to the two restaurants, you can enjoy a
golf clubhouse, a lobby bar, and 24-hour room service. The heated infinity
pool is surrounded by shaded areas and sun chairs, and waiters come by
every so often to offer chilled towels or a spritz of water. Newly added in
2006 is a tranquillity pool, surrounded by private cabañas, complete with
wireless Internet, a minibar, and flat screen TV, which are available for a daily
rental fee. A notable attraction is the cultural center — a library-style envi-
ronment with free Internet access and a menu of entertaining lectures on
Mexican culture, including a popular tequila tasting! The Kids for All Seasons
activities program is hands-down the best place for children to enjoy their
vacation as much as you will. The Four Seasons was the first resort to be
located in Punta Mita, an exclusive development north of Vallarta that’s
all the buzz in luxury travel. In late 2007, the St. Regis Resort, the Chopra
Center and Spa, and a second Jack Nicklaus Signature course will join it.

Hacienda San Angel
$$$$$
Centro
This enchanting boutique hotel may not be on the beach, but you’ll hardly
miss it, because you’ll be so pampered in the stunning suites, or satisfied
enjoying the view from the rooftop heated pool or Jacuzzi and sun deck.
Once Richard Burton’s home in Puerto Vallarta, it’s located just behind
Puerto Vallarta’s famed church — Our Lady of Guadalupe — making it easy
walking distance to the downtown restaurants, shopping, and galleries.

The Hacienda is comprised of three villas; the first two are joined to the
third villa by a path that winds through a lovely terraced garden filled with
tropical plants, flowers, statuary, and a charming fountain. A large, heated
pool and deck offer panoramic views of the city and Bahía de Banderas,
while a second sun deck with Jacuzzi literally overlooks the church’s
crown, across to the water beyond. Each of the Hacienda’s nine elegant
suites is individually decorated, accented with exquisite antiques and orig-
inal art, and has a private bath, air-conditioning, remote control cable TV,
telephone, and bathrobes. Bed linens and coverings are of the finest qual-
ity, with touches such as Venetian lace and goose-down pillows. Each
morning, you wake up to a continental breakfast served outside your suite
at your requested hour, or you can choose a full breakfast (for an addi-
tional charge). The Hacienda’s private chef also prepares a menu of snacks
and light meals during the day, or can prepare a sumptuous private dinner
upon request. From Monday through Saturday, guests can attend a cock-
tail hour and down one of Hacienda’s signature drinks (such as the
Celestial Sin — a wicked blend of vodka and blue Curacao), accompanied
by snacks. With its commitment to highly personalized services, the
Hacienda’s concierge can arrange excursions, golf games, or on-site spa
treatments. Sophisticated style, coupled with casual Vallarta charm, make
Hacienda San Angel a true “find” in Mexico for the discriminating traveler.

Hotel Molino de Agua
$$–$$$
Centro
With an unrivaled location adjacent to both the Río Cuale and the ocean, this
hotel is a mix of stone and stucco-walled bungalows and small beachfront
buildings spread out among winding walkways and lush tropical gardens.
If you want a place that’s more intimate than a standard hotel, in a location
that’s more immersed in town activities, this is the best choice. It’s located
immediately past the Río Cuale — after crossing the southbound bridge,
the hotel is on your right. Although the hotel is centrally located on a main
street, open spaces, big trees, birds, and lyrical fountains lend tranquillity
to the space. The individual bungalows are located in the gardens between
the entrance and the ocean; make sure to request one away from the front
of the property where street noise can keep you up at night. The bunga-
lows are well maintained, and the simple furnishings include a bed,
wooden desk and chair, Mexican tile floors, beamed ceilings, and beauti-
fully tiled bathrooms. Wicker rocking chairs grace their private patios.
Rooms and suites in the small, two- and three-story buildings on the beach
have double beds and private terraces. There are no TVs or telephones in
any of the rooms. In addition to an oceanside pool, a second pool with a
whirlpool is adjacent to the Lion’s Court restaurant and bar.

Marival Grand & Club Suites
$$$$
Nuevo Vallarta
This all-inclusive hotel, located almost by itself at the northernmost end
of Nuevo Vallarta, is a refreshing choice compared to the mega-resorts that
tend to dominate all-inclusive options. The broad, sandy beach is one of the
real assets here — it stretches more than 450m (1,500 ft.). There’s also an
extensive activities program, including fun for children. This Mediterranean-
style property is relatively small, but it offers a large variety of rooms rang-
ing from standard rooms with no balconies to large master suites with
whirlpools. Choose from among six restaurants, plus eight bars, for your
dining and drinking desires. The hotel has three pools and a whirlpool for
adults, plus two pools for children and four lighted tennis courts. If you’re
coming from the Puerto Vallarta airport, Club Marival is the first resort to
your right on Cocoteros when you enter Nuevo Vallarta from the second
entrance.

Paradise Village
$$$–$$$$$
Nuevo Vallarta
This resort truly lives up to its name. It feels more like a self-contained 
village than a resort and is indeed a paradise bordering one of the most
stunning stretches of broad, sandy beach in the bay. Paradise Village offers
a full array of guest services, ranging from an on-site disco to a full-service
European spa and health club. In 2002, the resort added the 18-hole El
Tigre golf course to its roster of guest amenities (see Chapter 19). Styled
in a Maya-influenced design, the collection of pyramid-shaped buildings
houses all-suite accommodations in studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom
configurations. All the suites are well designed and feature muted color
schemes, sitting areas, and kitchenettes — making them ideal for families
or groups of friends. The Maya theme extends to both oceanfront pools
with mythical creatures forming water slides and waterfalls. The exceptional
spa is reason enough to book a vacation here. Services include treatments,
hydrotherapy, massage (including massage on the beach), and fitness and
yoga classes. Special spa packages are always available, and they can
include a full fitness evaluation if you’re up for it. Four tennis courts, a lap
pool, a basketball court, beach volleyball courts, and a watersports center
Chapter 16: The Lowdown on Puerto Vallarta’s Hotel Scene 223

complement the spa and fitness center. In addition to the two full-service
restaurants, beachfront snack bars and special theme nights add to the
dining options. The kid’s club and petting zoo are especially popular with
families.

Playa Los Arcos Hotel & Suites
$$–$$$
Centro
An excellent value and always popular, this hotel is a personal favorite of
mine. Its stellar location in the heart of Playa Los Muertos is central to the
Olas Altas sidewalk-cafe action and close to downtown. The four-story
structure is U-shaped, facing the ocean, with a small swimming pool in the
courtyard. Rooms with private balconies overlook the pool, and the ten
suites have ocean views. Five of the suites have kitchenettes. The standard
rooms are small but pleasantly decorated with carved wooden furniture
painted pale pink, and they’re immaculate. A palapa beachside bar with
occasional live entertainment, a gourmet coffee shop, and the popular
Kaiser Maximilian’s gourmet restaurant (see Chapter 18) are on the prem-
ises. The hotel is located 7 blocks south of the river.

Premier Hotel & Spa
$$$–$$$$$
Centro
You couldn’t ask for a better location if you want to explore the vibrancy
that Vallarta’s centro has to offer. Located on a wide swath of golden sand
beach — and just a few blocks north of the start of the malecón — the
Premier is easy walking distance or a quick taxi ride to the downtown
restaurants, shops, galleries, and clubs. One of the newer hotels in Vallarta
(opened in 1999), the architecture is contemporary, but its size gives the
hotel an intimate feel. With a first-rate spa and a policy that restricts guests
to ages 16 and older, it’s a place that caters to relaxation. Four types of
rooms are available, and all are decorated in warm colors with tile floors
and light wood furnishings. Deluxe rooms have ocean views, with a choice
of a king bed or two doubles, a respectable seating area with comfortable
chairs, plus a sizable private balcony — request one of several rooms that
has an outdoor whirlpool. Premiere suites are larger, and have a separate
seating area; seven additional suites have a separate living room plus a dining
area with private bar and a spacious terrace. These rooms also have a double
whirlpool tub and a separate glass-enclosed shower. The top-of-the-line
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
224

master suites have all these amenities, plus an outdoor whirlpool on an
extra-spacious balcony. Thick terry-cloth robes, slippers, hair dryers, cof-
feemakers, and a daily restocking of complimentary bottled water are
among the notable in-room amenities. The beachfront pool is on the small
side, but it’s heated in the winter, overlooks the beach, and has attendants
to keep you supplied with drinks, snacks, and towels. You have three
restaurants to choose from, all which offer spa cuisine dining options, plus
24-hour room service. If you’re not tempted by the nearby and accessible
dining choices in downtown Vallarta, the Premier offers an all-inclusive
option, with all meals and drinks included.
The stunning bi-level spa is the hotel’s real attraction. Scented with aro-
matherapy and glowing with candlelight, it uses top-notch, 100 percent
natural products, most based on Mexico’s natural treasures such as
coconut, aloe, and papaya. The spa has separate men’s and women’s
steam rooms, sauna, locker/dressing rooms, and six private treatment
rooms, including hydrotheraphy rooms, for massage and skin care treat-
ments. There’s also a salon, and well-equipped fitness room.

Quinta María Cortez
$$$–$$$$
South Shore/Conchas Chinas
An eclectic, sophisticated, and imaginative B&B on the beach, this is Puerto
Vallarta’s most original place to stay — and one of Mexico’s most memo-
rable inns. Seven large suites, uniquely decorated with antiques, whimsical
curios, and original art all feature a private bathroom, and most include a
kitchenette and balcony. Sunny terraces, a small pool, and a central gather-
ing area with fireplace and palapa-topped dining area (where an excellent
full breakfast is served) occupy different levels of this seven-story house.
A rooftop terrace offers yet another alternative for taking in the sun and
is among the best sunset-watching spots in town. Quinta María is located
on a beautiful cove on Playa Conchas Chinas where the rocks sitting just off-
shore form tranquil tide pools. This B&B wins my highest recommendation,
but admittedly, it’s not for everyone. Air-conditioned areas are limited due
to the open nature of the suites and common areas, but then, the open-
ness is a large part of the allure. Vacationers who love Quinta María find

Velas Vallarta Grand Suite Resort
$$$$$
Marina Vallarta
The beachfront Velas Vallarta is an excellent choice for families because
each suite offers a full-size and fully equipped kitchen, ample living and
dining areas, separate bedroom(s), and a large balcony with seating.
Following a complete makeover, the suites are decorated in a sophisti-
cated, modern design featuring jewel-tone colors, Huichol art and Mexican
textiles, feather beds with goose-down comforters, texturized wall cover-
ings, new 27-inch flat-screen TVs, modern kitchen appliances, and teak
wood furniture on balconies and terraces. Special extras include luxury
bath amenities and even a pillow menu, from which you can choose the
type of pillow you want (based on firmness and stuffing) from a menu of
options. This property is actually part hotel and part full-ownership con-
dominium, which means each suite is the size of a true residential unit
offering the feeling of a home away from home. The suites all have partial
ocean views, and they face onto a central area where three free-form swim-
ming pools, complete with bridges and waterfalls, meander through tropical
gardens. A full range of services — including restaurants, mini-market, deli,
tennis courts, spa, and boutiques — means you’d never need to leave the
place if you didn’t want to. The Marina Vallarta Golf Club is across the
street, and special packages are available to Velas guests. With a special
on-site wedding planner who can arrange every detail in one of a variety
of ceremonies, Velas has become a popular place for tying the knot. The
resort also offers the Gold Crown All-Inclusive option, with one of the most
premium all-inclusive programs in Mexico, offering lobster, finer cuts of
beef, and premium liquors, as opposed to the lower-cost food and liquor
options provided with most all-inclusives.

Verana
$$$$–$$$$$
Yelapa
The magical Verana is among my very favorite places to stay in Mexico. It
has an unparalleled ability to inspire immediate relaxation and a deep con-
nection with the natural beauty of the spectacular coast. Although Yelapa
is 30 minutes by water taxi from town, even if you’re not familiar with the
village, I recommend that you consider it. Verana has seven rustic yet
sophisticated suites, set into a hillside with sweeping views of the moun-
tains and ocean. Each is a work of art, hand-crafted with care and creativity
by owners Heinz Leger, a former film production designer, and prop styl-
ist Veronique Lieve. Each suite has a private terrace and two beds, but you
won’t find TVs, telephones, stereos, or other distractions. My favorite suite
is the Studio; it’s the most contemporary, with a wall of floor-to-ceiling win-
dows that perfectly frame the spectacular view. The European-trained chef
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
226

prepares a nightly dinner of scrumptious creations — global cuisine with
a touch of Mexico — at the on-site restaurant, which also serves breakfast
and lunch. To wile away your days, soak up some sun at the hilltop pool,
raid the small but eclectic library of diverse reading materials, or relax in
a sumptuous indoor-outdoor spa. Tours and excursions to nearby — but
secluded — beaches are also available, or it’s a comfortable walk into
Yelapa’s town and lively beach. Compare this to the prices of the other
rustic-chic resorts along Mexico’s Pacific coast, and you find it’s a true
value. Adventurous travelers shouldn’t miss a stay at this unique place.
To arrive, management helps arrange transportation to Boca de Tomatlán,
where you catch a private boat that takes you to Yelapa; from there, it’s a
gentle nine-minute hike up to Verana (a mule helps with your bags).

Westin Regina Resort
$$$$–$$$$$
Marina Vallarta
The service standard of Westin hotels, combined with the stunning 
architecture and vibrant colors of this resort, make it a Puerto Vallarta
favorite — ideal for almost any traveler or type of vacation. Although the
grounds are large — more than 8.4 hectares (21 acres) with 255m (850 ft.)
of beachfront — the warm service and gracious hospitality always reminds
me of an intimate resort. The central free-form pool with hundreds of tall
palms surrounding it is spectacular. You may find hammocks strung
between the palms closest to the beach where there are also private beach
cabañas. Rooms are contemporary in style and brightly colored in textured
fabrics. They feature oversized wood furnishings, tile floors, original art,
tub/shower-combination bathrooms, and in-room safes. Balconies have
panoramic views. Two floors of rooms are designated as the Royal Beach
Club and come with special VIP services and private concierge. The fitness
center here is one of the most modern, well-equipped facilities of its kind
in Vallarta, and three grass tennis courts are available for day or night play,
and regularly scheduled classes for spinning, yoga, and Pilates. Guests enjoy
play privileges at the Marina Vallarta Golf Club and a kid’s club takes care
of the activities for younger travelers. Nikki Beach (www.nikkibeach.com),
a renowned haven for the hip, opened an on-site, beachfront restaurant
and club in 2004, complete with big white bed-size lounges for taking in
the sun, or enjoying libations anytime from noon until the early morning
hours. Their Sunday champagne brunch is especially popular.

Chapter 17
Settling into Puerto Vallarta
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect when you arrive
 Finding your way around town
 Discovering helpful information and resources
F
rom the moment you arrive, you’re likely to settle into Puerto
Vallarta’s welcoming ways. In this chapter, I take you from the plane,
through the airport, and to your hotel, helping you quickly get your
bearings in this easy-to-navigate town. I also provide tips on everything
from taxis to Internet access. You have insider information here —
Puerto Vallarta has been my home for the past 15 years!
Arriving in Puerto Vallarta
Puerto Vallarta’s airport is easy to get through, so you can segue into
sun-soaked days in no time. Recently recognized as the friendliest inter-
national city by the travel magazine Condé Nast Traveler, Puerto Vallarta
is a pleasure. The people here are genuinely welcoming and proud to
share their town with visitors. They strive to make your stay as pleasant
as possible. Visitors usually get a taste of Puerto Vallarta’s hospitality
right from the start — you should find both immigration and Customs
to be brief, generally easy procedures.
Navigating passport control and Customs
After you deplane, you go through a jetway and wind your way down
some stairs into the newly remodeled immigration-clearance area, or a
bus may take you directly to immigration from your plane. When you
reach immigration, an officer asks you to show your passport and your
completed tourist card, the FMT (see Chapter 9 for all the FMT details).
Your FMT is an important document, so take good care of it. You’re sup-
posed to keep the FMT with you at all times because you may be required
to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to turn it back
in upon departure, or you may be unable to leave without replacing it.

Next up is the baggage claim area. Here, porters stand by to help with
your bags, and they’re well worth the price of the tip — about a dollar a
bag. After you collect your luggage, you pass through another check-
point. Something that looks like a traffic light awaits you here. You press
a button, and if the light turns green, you’re free to go. If it turns red, you
need to open each of your bags for a quick search. It’s Mexico’s random
search procedure for Customs. If you have an unusually large bag, or
an excessive amount of luggage, you may be searched regardless of the
traffic-light outcome.
Just past the traffic light, you pass into an enclosed space with people
behind counters — it may look like a tourist information center, but the
people behind the counters are actually timeshare sales reps. Unless
you want to start your vacation shopping for timeshares with these
high-pressure sales pros, keep moving.
Just beyond this entryway you see a bustling crowd of people waiting
for fellow passengers, transportation representatives, and taxi drivers
promoting their services. If you’re part of a package tour that includes
ground transportation to your hotel, start looking for your rep here.
Generally he or she is carrying a sign with your name or the name of
your tour company on it. If you haven’t arranged transportation, head
for the blue and orange booths marked “Taxi” to purchase set-price tick-
ets to your hotel.
Getting to your hotel
The airport is close to the north end of town near the Marina Vallarta,
about 10km (6 miles) from downtown. Transportes Terrestres minivans
and Aeromovil taxis make the trip from the airport to all the hotel areas.
Costs for both options are determined by zones — clearly posted at the
respective ticket booths. Fares start at $10 for a ride to Marina Vallarta
and go up to $30 for a trip to the south-shore hotels. Airport taxis
(Aeromovil) are federally licensed taxis that operate exclusively to pro-
vide transportation from the airport. Their fares are almost three times
as high as city (yellow) taxis. A trip from the airport to downtown Puerto
Vallarta costs $20, whereas a return trip using a city taxi costs only $6.
Yellow cabs are restricted from picking up passengers leaving the airport.
If you don’t have too much baggage, you can walk across the highway
via the overpass at the side exit of the airport. Yellow cabs are lined up
on the other side of the highway ready to take you anywhere your heart
desires for a third of the price of the airport cabs.
Getting Around Puerto Vallarta
Puerto Vallarta is very easy to get around. Essentially, one main road
stretches from the airport in both directions around the bay. Puerto
Vallarta has followed this central roadway — which changes names a
few times along the way — as it has grown along the beach to the north
Chapter 17: Settling into Puerto Vallarta 229

and south. Linking the airport to downtown, the road is called Avenida
Francisco Medina Ascencio (sometimes still referred to by its previous
name, Av. de Las Palmas). Along this main thoroughfare are many luxury
hotels (in the area called the Zona Hotelera, or Hotel Zone), plus sev-
eral shopping centers with casual restaurants.
As you come into the central downtown area, known as El Centro, the
main road becomes Paseo Díaz Ordaz, which runs north to south
through the town. The seaside promenade, called the malecón, which
borders Paseo Díaz Ordaz, is frequently used as a reference point for
giving directions. This section of downtown marked off by the malecón
is the original town and is sometimes referred to as Viejo Vallarta — the
cultural and civic heart of Puerto Vallarta. City hall, the waterfront, the
open-air Los Arcos Theater, the landmark Our Lady of Guadalupe church,
and scores of restaurants, galleries, and shops all call this area home.
From the waterfront, the town stretches back into the hills a half-dozen
blocks. The areas bordering the Río Cuale (Cuale River) are the oldest
parts of town — and home to Gringo Gulch, named for the dozens of U.S.
expatriates who made their homes here in the late 1950s.
The area immediately south of the river, called Olas Altas after its main
street (and sometimes Los Muertos after the beach of the same name),
is now home to a growing selection of sidewalk cafes, fine restaurants,
espresso bars, and hip nightclubs (many with live music).
From the center of town, nearly everything both north and south of the
river is within walking distance. Bridges on Insurgentes (northbound
traffic) and Ignacio L. Vallarta (southbound traffic) link the two sections
of town.
Taking a taxi
Taxi travel is the preferred way for getting around Puerto Vallarta. Away
from the airport, taxis are plentiful and relatively inexpensive. Most trips
from downtown to the northern Zona Hotelera and Marina Vallarta cost
between $3.50 and $7; a trip between Marina Vallarta and Playa Mismaloya
to the south costs $10. Rates are charged by zone and are generally
posted in hotel lobbies. You can also hire taxis by the hour or day for
longer trips when you prefer to leave the driving to someone else, a
good alternative to renting a car. Rates run between $12 and $15 per
hour with discounts available for full-day rates.
Beware of restaurant recommendations offered by taxi drivers — many
drivers receive a commission from restaurants where they discharge
passengers. Be especially wary if a driver tries to talk you out of a
restaurant you’ve already selected and to one of his own personal
“favorites.”
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
230

Catching a bus
Another option for travel around town — combining cheap, easy trans-
portation with some local color — is Puerto Vallarta’s city bus system.
Buses run from the airport through the Zona Hotelera along Calle Morelos
(1 block inland from the malecón), across the Río Cuale, and inland on
Vallarta, looping back through the downtown hotel and restaurant dis-
tricts on Insurgentes and several other downtown streets. To get to the
northern Zona Hotelera strip from old Puerto Vallarta, take the Zona
Hoteles, Ixtapa, or Las Juntas bus. These buses in the Zona Hotelera
follow the same route and may also post the names of hotels they pass
such as Krystal, Fiesta Americana, Sheraton, and others. Buses marked
“Marina Vallarta” travel inside the Marina Vallarta area and stop at the
major hotels there. City buses, which cost about 50¢, can service just
about all your transportation needs frequently and inexpensively.
Buses generally run from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., and waiting more than a few
minutes for one is rare. An additional bus route travels south every 10 to
15 minutes to either Playa Mismaloya or Boca de Tomatlán (the last point
on the southern shore of the bay that can be reached by land — the des-
tination is indicated in the front window) from Plaza Lázaro Cárdenas, a
few blocks south of the river at Cárdenas and Suárez, and along Basilio
Badillo, between Pino Suárez and Insurgentes.
Buses in Vallarta tend to be rather aggressive, and some even sport
appropriately intimidating names — “Terminator,” “Rambo,” and
“Tornado” are three of my favorites. Don’t tempt fate by assuming that
these buses stop for pedestrians. Although Vallarta is an extremely low-
crime city, bus accidents are frequent — and often fatal.
Renting a car
Rental cars are available at the airport and through travel agencies, but
unless you’re planning a distant side trip, don’t bother. Car rentals are
expensive, averaging $66 per day, and parking around town is difficult.
If you see a sign for a $10 Jeep rental or $20 car rental, be aware that it’s
a lure to get people to attend timeshare presentations. Unless you’re
interested in a timeshare, stopping to inquire is a waste of your time.
Cruising around
The cruise-ship pier, or muelle, also called Terminal Marítima, is where
excursion boats to Yelapa, Las Animas, Quimixto, and the Marietas Islands
depart. The pier is north of town near the airport and just an inexpensive
taxi or bus ride away from the Vallarta region. Just take any bus marked
“Ixtapa,” “Las Juntas,” “Pitillal,” or “Aurora” and tell the driver to let you
off at the Terminal Marítima. Note: Odd though it may seem, you have to
pay a $1.50 fee to access the pier where the tour boats are docked.
Chapter 17: Settling into Puerto Vallarta 231

Water taxis offering direct transportation to Yelapa, Las Animas, and
Quimixto leave at 10:30 and 11 a.m. from the pier at Playa Los Muertos
(south of downtown) on Rodolfo Rodríguez next to the Hotel Marsol.
Another water taxi departs at 11 a.m. from the beachfront pier at the
northern edge of the malecón. A round-trip ticket to Yelapa (the farthest
point) costs $25. Return trips usually depart between 3 and 4 p.m., but
confirm the pickup time with your water-taxi captain. Other water taxis
depart from Boca de Tomatlán, located about 30 minutes south of town
by public bus. These Boca de Tomatlán water taxis are a better option
than those at Playa Los Muertos if you want more flexible departure and
return times from the southern beaches. Generally, they leave on the
hour for the southern shore destinations, or more frequently if there’s
heavy traffic. The price is about $12 round-trip with rates clearly posted
on a sign on the beach. You can hire a private boat taxi for between $35
and $50 (depending on your destination), which allows you to choose
your own return time. The boats take up to eight people for that price,
so people often band together at the beach to hire one.

American Express
The local office (Morelos 660, at the corner
of Abasolo; % 01-800-333-3211 in Mexico,
or 322-223-2955) is open Monday to Friday
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
This location offers excellent, efficient,
travel-agency services in addition to offering
currency-exchange and traveler’s-checks
services.
Area Code
The telephone area code is 322. The area
code for Nuevo Vallarta and the northern
areas is 329.
Baby Sitters
Most of the larger hotels can easily arrange
baby sitters, but many sitters speak limited
English. Rates range from $5 to $8 per hour.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Banks are located throughout downtown
and in the other prime shopping areas of
Vallarta. Most banks are open Monday to
Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with partial hours on
Saturday. You can find ATMs throughout
Vallarta, including the central plaza down-
town. They’re increasingly becoming the
most favorable way to exchange currency
because they offer bank rates plus 24-hour,
self-service convenience. Money exchange
houses (casas de cambio) are also located
throughout town and offer longer hours
than the banks with only slightly lower
exchange rates.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (9 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
4–8 p.m., daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day. Offices tend to be
closed on Saturday and Sunday, but shops
are open on Saturday, at least, and increas-
ingly offer limited hours of operation on
Sunday. During peak season, many shops
and galleries remain open as late as 10 p.m.
Climate
Vallarta is warm all year with tropical tem-
peratures; however, evenings and early
mornings in the winter months can turn
quite cool. Summers are sunny, but an
increase in humidity during the rainy

season, between May and October, is the
norm. Rains come almost every afternoon
in June and July. These usually brief but
strong showers are just enough to cool off
the air for evening activities. September 
is the month in which heat and humidity are
the least comfortable and rains are the
heaviest.
Consular Agents
Both the U.S. and Canadian consulates
maintain offices here in the building on
the southern border of the central plaza
(note the U.S. and Canadian flags). The U.S.
Consular Agency office (% 322-222-0069;
Fax: 322-223-0074; both available 24 hr. a
day for emergencies) is open Monday to
Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Canadian
Consulate (% 322-293-0099 or 293-0098; 
24-hr. emergency line: 01-800-706-2900) is
open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Emergencies
Police emergency (% 060); local police
(% 322-290-0513 or 290-0512); intensive
care ambulance (% 322-225-0386; Note:
English-speaking assistance isn’t always
available at this number); Red Cross
(% 322-222-1533).
Hospitals
Ameri-Med Urgent Care (% 322-221-0023;
Fax: 322-221-0026; www.amerimed-
hospitals.com) offers healthcare service
24 hours a day that meets U.S. standards
and is located at the entrance to Marina
Vallarta in the Neptune Plaza. In addition
to excellent diagnostic capabilities, it also
has emergency facilities and helicopters
to evacuate patients to the United States.
The excellent San Javier Marina Hospital
(% 322-226-1010) also offers U.S.-standard
healthcare service that’s available 24 hours.
It’s located on the main highway across
from the cruise-ship terminal (Terminal
Marítima).
Information
The Municipal Tourism Office (Juárez and
Independencia; % 322-223-2500, ext. 230,
ask for the Tourism Office) is in a corner of
the white Presidencia Municipal building
(city hall) on the northwest end of the main
square. In addition to offering a listing of cur-
rent events and a collection of promotional
brochures for local activities and services,
these folks can also assist you with specific
questions — an English-speaking person is
usually on staff. This is also the office of the
tourist police. It’s open Monday to Friday
8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The exceptionally helpful and friendly State
Tourism Office (Plaza Marina, Local 144,
second floor; % 322-221-2676, -2677, 
or -2678) also offers promotional brochures
and can assist you with specific questions
about Puerto Vallarta and other points
within the state of Jalisco including
Guadalajara, the Costa Alegre, and the
town of Tequila. It’s open Monday to Friday
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Internet Access
Puerto Vallarta is probably the best-
connected destination in Mexico as far as
the Internet goes. Of the numerous cyber-
cafes around town, one of the most popular
is The Net House (Ignacio L. Vallarta 232,
2 blocks past the southbound bridge;
% 322-222-6953; info@vallartacafes.
com). It’s open daily 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. Rates
are $4 per hour, and there are 21 computers
with fast connections and English key-
boards. Café.com (Olas Altas 250, at the
corner of Basilio Badillo; % 322-222-0092)
has become a social hub. Rates run $2 for
30 minutes. Complete computer services, a
full bar, and food service are also available.
It’s open daily 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. Some hotels
also offer e-mail kiosks in their lobbies, but
this is a more expensive option than the Net
cafes.
Chapter 17: Settling into Puerto Vallarta 233

Maps
One of the best around is the free American
Express map, usually found at the tourist
information offices and the local American
Express office. Other free maps of the area
are available at the Municipal Tourism
Office, on the southeast corner of city hall
(the corner nearest to the Our Lady of
Guadalupe church).
Newspapers and Magazines
Vallarta Today, a daily English-language
newspaper (% 322-225-3323 or 224-2829;
www.vallartatoday.com), is a good
source for local information and upcoming
events. The quarterly city magazine, Vallarta
Lifestyles (% 322-221-0106), is also very
popular. It has plenty of helpful information
and good colored maps of all the major
tourist areas. Both publications are avail-
able for sale at area newsstands and hotel
gift shops although you can also find them
distributed for free at local businesses. The
weekly P.V. Tribune (% 322-223-0585) is dis-
tributed free throughout town and offers an
objective local viewpoint.
Pharmacy
CMQ Farmacia (Basilio Badillo 365;
% 322-222-1330) is open 24 hours and can
also deliver to your hotel free of charge
with a minimum purchase of $20. Farmacia
Guadalajara (Emiliano Zapata 232; % 322-
224-1811) is also open 24 hours a day.
Police
The policemen in white, safari-style uni-
forms with white pith helmets belong to a
special corps of English-speaking police
established to assist tourists. For the main
police department, call % 322-290-0513 or
290-0512.
Post Office
The post office (correo; Mina 188; % 322-
222-1888) is open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Safety
Puerto Vallarta enjoys a very low crime
rate. Public transportation is perfectly safe
to use, and tourist police (dressed in white
safari uniforms with white hats) are avail-
able to answer questions, give directions,
and offer assistance. Most crimes or
encounters with the police are linked to
using or purchasing drugs, so simply don’t
do it. Note: The tourist police are making a
more frequent habit of conducting random
personal searches for drugs. Although
some questions have arisen about their
right to do this, the best course of action
is to comply if they want to frisk you —
objecting may result in a free tour of the
local jail. Report any unusual incidents to
the local consular office.
Taxes
There’s a 15 percent value-added tax (IVA)
on goods and services, and it’s generally
included in the posted price.
Taxis
Taxis are plentiful and relatively inexpen-
sive. Most trips from downtown to the
northern Zona Hotelera and Marina Vallarta
cost between $3.50 and $7; trips between
Marina Vallarta and Mismaloya Beach to
the south cost $10. Rates are charged by
zone and are generally posted in the lob-
bies of hotels. You can also hire taxis by the
hour or day for longer trips when you prefer
to leave the driving to someone else. Rates
run between $12 and $15 per hour with dis-
counts available for full-day rates.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
234

Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
by using a Telmex (LADATEL) prepaid phone
card, available at most pharmacies and
mini-supers, using the official Telmex (Lada)
public phones. In Mexico you need to dial
001 prior to a number to reach the United
States, and you need to preface long dis-
tance calls within Mexico by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Puerto Vallarta operates on central stan-
dard time, but Mexico’s observance of 
daylight saving time varies somewhat from
that in the United States.

Dining in Puerto Vallarta
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Discovering Puerto Vallarta’s best restaurants
 Finding a restaurant with true Mexican ambience
 Dining on the malecón and in the jungle
P
uerto Vallarta has the most exceptional dining scene of any resort
town in Mexico. More than 250 restaurants serve cuisines from
around the world in addition to fresh seafood and regional dishes. Chefs
from France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and Argentina have come for
visits and then stayed to open their own restaurants. In celebration of
the diversity of dining experiences available, Vallarta’s culinary commu-
nity hosts a two-week-long Gourmet Dining Festival each November.
As in many of Mexico’s beach resorts, even the finest restaurants in town
can be comfortably casual when it comes to dress. Men seldom wear
jackets, although ladies frequently don dressy resort wear — basically,
everything goes. Remember that dinner tends to take on the dual nature
of Puerto Vallarta — many tourists dine at earlier hours, but locals are
apt to just be thinking about dinner at 9 p.m., so many restaurants stay
open late.
Nonetheless, dining isn’t limited to high-end options — you can also find
plenty of small, family-owned restaurants, local Mexican kitchens, and
vegetarian cafes. Vallarta also has its share of imported, food-and-fun
chains: Hard Rock Cafe, Outback Steakhouse, and even Hooters. I don’t
bother reviewing these restaurants because the consistency and décor
are so familiar. Resist the temptation to go with what you know, though.
Trust me — the locally owned restaurants offer both the best food and
the best value.
Vallarta on the whole is a very child-friendly place, and families are wel-
come to bring their children almost anywhere. If your young ones are
particular to more American tastes, standards such as McDonald’s, Burger
King, Hard Rock Cafe, Carl’s Junior, and KFC — good choices — are here,
but you may also want to try one of their Mexican counterparts — Carlos
O’Brian’s or Papaya 3, both located downtown.

Puerto Vallarta’s Best Restaurants
Unless you’re visiting during the height of high season, you generally
don’t need reservations — especially with the number and range of
excellent restaurants in Vallarta. I note reservation information for the
few exceptions that tend to be very busy.
Contrary to conventional travel wisdom, most of the best restaurants in
the Marina Vallarta area are actually located in hotels. Especially notable
are Andrea, at Velas Vallarta, for fine Italian cuisine, and Nikki Beach, on
the beachfront of the Westin Regina Resort, for a hip atmosphere with a
specialty of seafood and sushi. (See Chapter 16 for more information on
these resorts.) You can find other choices along the boardwalk border-
ing the marina yacht harbor. A notable stop is the Café Max, next to the
Vallarta Adventures offices in Condominiums Marina Golf, Local 11.
It serves excellent coffee and espresso drinks, plus pastries and light
snacks and sandwiches, and is open Monday through Saturday from
8 a.m. to 1 p.m., and 4 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. (no credit cards).
The most condensed restaurant area, Zona Romántica, is south of the
Río Cuale. The area’s street, Basilio Badillo, is even nicknamed
“Restaurant Row.” A second main dining drag has emerged along Olas
Altas, where you can find all varieties of foods and price categories. The
wide sidewalks are lined with cafes and espresso bars, which are gener-
ally open 7 a.m. to midnight.
All the restaurants I include in the following listings are arranged alpha-
betically with their location and general price category noted. Please
refer to the Introduction of this book for an explanation of the price cate-
gories. Remember that tips generally run about 15 percent, and most
waitstaff really depend on these for their income, so be generous if the
service warrants.
Please see the menu glossary in Appendix C for more information on
Mexican cuisine.

Finding inexpensive, vegetarian options
The best inexpensive local spots are downtown. The long-standing favorite spot for
light meals and fresh fruit drinks is the tiny Tutifruti, Allende 220 (% 322-222-1068),
which is open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. An inexpensive, bountiful,
and delicious vegetarian buffet is a daily hit at Planeta Vegetariano, Iturbide 270, just
down the street from the Our Lady of Guadalupe church (% 322-222-3073). The buffet
is offered from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and costs $6.50 (no credit cards). A vegetarian
breakfast buffet is also available from 8 until noon for $4.50. Planeta Vegetariano is
closed on Sundays. 

Agave Grill
$–$$
Centro
MEXICAN 
Opening its doors in late 2004, Agave Grill took over most of the space at
the Casa de Tequila, where it’s located in the back, in a beautiful garden
setting, within this classic Hacienda-style building in central downtown.
The space has been put to excellent use: This cafe serves modern, casual
Mexican cuisine and is an ideal spot to stop for a snack or a margarita while
shopping. Start with an order of chiles anchos, stuffed with cream cheese
and raisins, or the antojitos mexicanos, a sampler of Mexican snacks includ-
ing sopes, quesadillas, a tamale, and guacamole. Favorite main courses
include mole poblano, or the beef filet in a chile pasilla gravy, served with
mashed sweet potatoes and grilled watermelon. For a sweet finish, don’t
miss their chocolate truffle with coconut foam in a strawberry salsa. All
tortillas are handmade, as are the savory salsas. An elegant bar borders
the room, serving undoubtedly Vallarta’s most original selection of fine
tequilas, many from small distilleries. In addition to the tequilas and fresh
fruit margaritas, Agave Grill also serves a selection of fine Mexican wines.

Archie’s Wok

Centro/Zona Romántica
ASIAN/SEAFOOD
Since 1986, Archie’s has been legendary in Puerto Vallarta for serving orig-
inal cuisine influenced by the intriguing flavors of Thailand, China, and the
Philippines. Archie was Hollywood director John Huston’s private chef
during the years Huston spent in the area. Today, Archie’s wife Cindy con-
tinues his legacy. The drinks — including a Thai mai tai and other tropical
drinks that are made from only fresh fruit and juices — are a good way to
kick off a meal here, as are the Filipino spring rolls, which are consistently
crispy and delicious. The popular Singapore fish filet features lightly bat-
tered fillet strips in a sweet-and-sour sauce, and the Thai garlic shrimp is
prepared with fresh garlic, ginger, cilantro, and black pepper. Vegetarians
have plenty of options, including the broccoli, tofu, mushroom, and
cashew stir-fry in a black bean and sherry sauce. Finish things off with the
signature Spice Islands coffee or a slice of lime cheese pie. Live classical
music sets the atmosphere in Archie’s Oriental garden Thursday to
Saturday from 8 to 11 p.m.

chef Carmen Titita (praised by James Beard for her culinary work) to
assist in the design of the kitchen and creation of the restaurant’s concise
menu, which features the genuine Mexican food of different regions. The
open-air (but covered) dining area surrounds a cozy courtyard, while its
exposed brick walls and funky-chic décor showcase a modern view of
Mexican classics — tin tubs serve as sinks in the bathrooms, while color-
ful oilcloths cover the tables and Huichol art pieces enliven the dining
room. Start with an order of sumptuous plantain empanadas filled with
black beans and cheese or an unusual salad of diced nopal cactus paddles
with fresh panela cheese. Favorite main courses include their “off the
menu special” tacos filled with prime beef filet, or duck carnitas, a Mexican
style duck confit, served in an arrayán-orange sauce. (Arrayán, the name-
sake of the place, is a small bittersweet fruit, native to the region.)
Homemade, fresh-fruit ice creams are an especially tasty finish to your
meal. The full bar offers an extensive selection of tequilas and regional
liquors, with a creative menu of drink specials — my favorite is their raicilla
martini — made from a regional distillation, infused with herbs, and their

version of the mojito, with vodka and basil, is also quite tasty. Non-alcoholic
beverages center around “aqua frescas,” blended drinks of fresh fruit and
water. You can’t miss the pink facade with the large bell at the entry. The
excellent service is a plus to this can’t-miss dining experience.

Café des Artistes/Thierry Blouet Cocina de Autor
$$–$$$$
Centro
FRENCH/INTERNATIONAL
If you want one over-the-top dining experience in Puerto Vallarta, Café des
Artistes is the hands-down choice. Creative in its menu and innovative in
design, this dinner-only location rivals those in any major metropolitan
city for its culinary sophistication, and may soon become a reason in itself
to visit Vallarta. The award-winning chef and owner, Thierry Blouet, is both
a member of the Académie Culinaire de France and a Maître Cuisinier de
France. In late 2003, the singular dining experience of the Café des Artistes
evolved to complete a trio of special places, adding the upscale Constantini
Bar Lounge and the separate but connected Thierry Blouet Cocina de Autor
dining area. All are located in a restored house that resembles a castle.
The interior of the original Café des Artistes combines murals, lush fabrics,
and an array of original artworks, with both an interior dining area as well
as a lushly landscaped terraced garden area, open only during the winter
and spring. The menu of this section is a changing delight of French gour-
met bistro fare, which draws heavily on Chef Blouet’s French training, yet
uses regional specialty ingredients. A few of the noteworthy entrees include
sea bass filet served with polenta, and the renowned roasted duck glazed
with honey, soy, ginger, and lime sauce, and served with a pumpkin risotto.
At the Cocina de Autor, the atmosphere is sleek and stylish, and the fixed-
price tasting menu (prices depend on the number of plates you select,
between three and six, from a long list of starters, entrees, and desserts)
offers you a choice of the chef’s most innovative and sumptuous creations,
with each dish creatively combining ingredients to present one memorable

Café Kaiser Maximilian
$–$$
Centro/Zona Romántica
INTERNATIONAL
Kaiser Maximilian is the prime place to go if you want to combine excep-
tional food with great people-watching. This bistro-style cafe has a casually
elegant atmosphere with a genuinely European feel to it. Austrian-born
owner Andreas Rupprechter is always on hand to ensure that the service
is as impeccable as the food is delicious. Indoor, air-conditioned dining is
at cozy tables dressed in crisp white linens; sidewalk tables are larger and
great for groups of friends. The cuisine merges old-world European prepa-
rations with regional, fresh ingredients. My personal favorite is the filet of
trout with watercress and beet sauce, served on a bed of spinach. Also
excellent is the mustard chicken with mashed potatoes, and the rack of
lamb with polenta, endive, and lima beans is simply divine. Maximilian also
offers northern-European classics such as rahmschnitzel (sautéed pork
loin and homemade noodles in a creamy mushroom sauce). Desserts are
especially tempting, as are the gourmet coffees — Maximilian has its own
Austrian cafe and pastry shop next door. It’s located at the intersection of
Basilio Badillo and Olas Altas, in front of the Playa Los Arcos Hotel.

A comfortable, classic, sidewalk cafe, Café San Angel is a local gathering
place from sunrise to sunset. For breakfast, choose between a burrito
stuffed with eggs and chorizo sausage, a three-egg Western omelet, crepes
filled with mushrooms, or a tropical fruit plate. Deli sandwiches, crepes,
and pastries round out the small but ample menu. The cafe also has excep-
tional fruit smoothies (such as the Yelapa — a blend of mango, banana,
and orange juice) and perfectly made espresso drinks. As much as I love
it here, I have to warn you that the service is reliably slow and frequently
frustrating, so choose this place if time is on your side, though it does offer
the best people-watching in the area to help you endure the slow service.
Bar service and Internet access are also available.

MODERN AMERICAN
A Vallarta dining institution, Daiquiri Dick’s has been around for more than
20 years, evolving its winning combination of décor, service, and scrump-
tious cuisine. The menu is among Vallarta’s most sophisticated, and the
genuinely warm staff and open-air location fronting Playa Los Muertos add
to the feeling of casual comfort. As lovely as the restaurant is, though, and
as notorious as the fresh-fruit daiquiris are, the food is the main attraction,

incorporating touches of Tuscan, Thai, and Mexican. Start with grilled
asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and topped with shaved asiago cheese,
then try an entree such as sesame-crusted tuna, grilled rare and served
with wild greens; pistachio chicken served with polenta; or my favorite,
simple yet indulgent lobster tacos. Chocolate banana bread pudding
makes a perfect finish. Daiquiri Dick’s is a great place for groups, as well
as for a romantic dinner. It’s one of the few places that is equally enjoyable
for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

de Santos
$–$$
Centro
MEDITERRANEAN
After it opened a few years ago, de Santos quickly became the hot spot in
town for late-night dining and bar action. Although the dining aspect ini-
tially didn’t live up to the atmosphere and music, it does now. The fare is
Mediterranean-inspired; the best bets include lightly breaded calamari,
paella Valencia, lobster ravioli, and excellent thin-crust pizzas. Other good
choices are the nightly specials — always the most creative offerings on
the menu. The cool, refined interior — recently remodeled to expand the
dining area — has exposed brick walls, crisp white-clothed tables, and lots
of votive candles, and feels more urban than resort. The place boasts the
most sophisticated sound system in town — including its own DJ who spins
to match the crowd’s mood. It probably helps that one of the partners is
also a member of Maná, the chart-topping, wildly popular Latin group.
Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and overall experience of an
evening here. Start with dinner and then stay on and enjoy the most favored
club in town, of the same name, located next door (see Chapter 19).

This tiny, hard-to-find cafe is worth the effort — a visit here rewards you
with exceptional, traditional Mexican cuisine and a whimsical crash course

wall and table to table with photographs, paintings, movie posters, and
news clippings about Mexico’s cultural icons. The Mexican painter Frida
Kahlo (the same Frida that Salma Hayek portrayed in the film, Frida) fig-
ures prominently in the décor, and a special menu duplicates dishes that
she and husband Diego Rivera prepared for guests. Specialties from all
over Mexico are featured, including the divine chiles en nogada (poblano
chiles stuffed with ground beef, pine nuts, and raisins, topped with a sweet
cream sauce and served cold), an intricate chicken mole from Puebla, and
the hearty carne en su jugo (steak in its juice). El Repollo Rojo isn’t the
place for an intimate conversation, however — the poor acoustics cause

you’re hearing from adjacent tables are raves about the food. Also, this is

This eatery is Vallarta’s best late-night dining option, and especially popu-

busiest streets — across from El Torito’s sports bar, and cater-cornered
from the lively Señor Frog’s — meaning that traffic noise is a factor, though
not a deterrent. The food is superb, the service attentive, and the prices
more than reasonable. Owned by a partnership of lively Italians, it serves
food that is authentic in preparation and flavor, from thin-crust, brick-oven
pizzas to savory homemade pastas. My favorite pizza is the Quattro
Stagioni, topped with artichokes, black olives, ham, and mushrooms.
Excellent calzones and panini (sandwiches) are also options. I prefer the
rooftop garden area for dining, but many patrons gravitate to the pool
tables in the air-conditioned downstairs, which features major sports and
entertainment events on satellite TV. Espresso also has full bar service and
draft beer — oh yes, and also espresso.

Fajita Republic has hit on a winning recipe: delicious food, ample portions,

festive in atmosphere, and situated in a garden of mango and palm trees
with a view of the passing action on the bordering street. The specialty is,
of course, fajitas, grilled to perfection in every variety: steak, chicken,
shrimp, combo, and vegetarian. All come with a generous tray of salsas
and toppings. This tropical grill also serves sumptuous BBQ ribs, grilled
shrimp, and Mexican molcajetes (dishes served in these stone bowls tra-
ditionally used in Mexico for grinding and puréeing) with incredibly tender
strips of marinated beef filet. Starters include fresh guacamole served in
a giant spoon and the ever-popular Maya cheese sticks (cheese, breaded
and deep-fried). Try a “Fajita Rita Mango Margarita” — or one of the other
spirited temptations — served in oversized mugs or by the pitcher. A new,
second location in Nuevo Vallarta, across from the Velas Resort is drawing

La Palapa
$–$$
Centro/Zona Romántica
SEAFOOD/MEXICAN
This lovely, open-air, palapa-roofed (thatched umbrella) restaurant on the
beach is a decades-old local favorite, and with each recent visit, I’ve found
that the quality of both the food and service keeps improving. It’s an
exceptional dining experience, day or night. Enjoy a tropical breakfast by
the sea, lunch on the beach, cocktails at sunset, or a romantic dinner — at
night the staff sets cloth-covered tables in the sand. For lunch and dinner,
seafood is the specialty. Featured dishes include macadamia and coconut
shrimp in a litchi-fruit sauce and poached red snapper with fresh cilantro
sauce — but note that the menu changes regularly, and that La Palapa also
offers daily specials. The fresh catch is listed on a chalkboard and is
served in much thicker portions than at most local restaurants — simply
sumptuous, and prepared to your preference. La Palapa’s location in the
heart of Playa Los Muertos makes it an exceptional place to either start or
end the day; I favor it for breakfast or, even better, for a late-night dessert
and specialty coffee while watching the moon over the bay with the sand
at my feet. A particular favorite is the all-you-can-enjoy Sunday brunch,
which entitles you to a spot on popular Playa Los Muertos for the day! A
plus at lunch is you can enjoy the extra-comfortable beach chairs for post-
lunch sunbathing. A classy bar area features acoustic guitars and vocals
nightly from 8 to 11 p.m., frequently performed by the very talented owner
Alberto himself.

Las Palomas is one of Puerto Vallarta’s few genuine Mexican restaurants
and has the atmosphere of a gracious home. Breakfast is the best value.
The staff pours mugs of steaming coffee spiced with cinnamon as soon as
you’re seated. Try the classic huevos rancheros (fried eggs served on a soft
fried corn tortilla and topped with red sauce — spicy or mild) or chilaquiles
(tortilla strips, fried and topped with a red or green spicy sauce, cream
cheese, and fried eggs). Lunch and dinner offer other traditional Mexican
specialties plus a selection of stuffed crepes. The best place for checking
out the malecón and watching the sun set while sipping an icy margarita
is at the spacious bar or upstairs terrace.

ITALIAN
One of the first restaurants in the marina, Porto Bello remains a favorite.
It features authentically flavorful Italian dishes and exceptional service in
a casual atmosphere overlooking the marina. For starters, the fried cala-
mari is delicately seasoned, and the grilled vegetable antipasto can easily
serve as a full meal. Signature dishes include Fusilli Porto Bello prepared
with black olives, artichokes, lemon juice, olive oil, and basil, and veal
scaloppine with a creamy white-wine sauce, mushrooms, and shrimp.
Most people prefer seating on the gazebo-like patio overlooking the boats
in the marina. Indoor dining is air-conditioned, and occasionally, live music
fills the air in the evenings.

Vallarta’s jungle dining
Want to get wild while you dine? One of the unique attractions of Puerto Vallarta is its
group of “jungle restaurants,” located to the south of town toward Playa Mismaloya.
Each restaurant offers open-air dining in a tropical setting by the sea or beside a moun-
tain river. A stop for swimming and lunch at one of these places is included in many
of the “jungle” or “tropical” tours (see Chapter 19 for more about these tours).
If you travel on your own, a taxi is the best transportation because all the jungle restau-
rants are located quite a distance from the main highway. Taxis are usually waiting
for return patrons.
The most recommendable of the jungle restaurants is El Nogalito (%/fax 322-221-5225).
Located beside a clear jungle stream, this exceptionally clean, beautifully landscaped
ranch serves lunch, beverages, and snacks on a shady terrace in a relaxing atmos-
phere. Several hiking routes also depart from the grounds. El Nogalito’s guides point
out the area’s native plants, birds, and wildlife. To get to El Nogalito, take a taxi or travel
to Punta Negra, just about 8km (5 miles) south of downtown Puerto Vallarta. A well-
marked sign points to Calzada del Cedro, a dirt road leading to the ranch. El Nogalito
is much closer to town than the other jungle restaurants and is open daily from noon
to 5:30 p.m. (no credit cards).
Just past Boca de Tomatlán, at Highway 200 Km 20, is Chico’s Paradise (%322-223-6005
or -6006), which offers spectacular views of massive rocks and the surrounding jungle
and mountains. Natural pools and waterfalls for swimming are located here, plus a
small mercado (market) selling pricey trinkets. The menu features excellent seafood (the
seafood platter for two is excellent — lobster, clams, giant shrimp, crab, and fish fillets)
as well as Mexican dishes. The quality is quite good, and the portions are generous,
although prices are higher than in town — remember, you’re paying for the setting.
Chico’s is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (no credit cards).

ITALIAN
If the food wasn’t a reason to come here (and it definitely is), then Rito
himself and his gentle, devoted way of caring for every detail of this cozy
trattoria would be the draw. His grandfather emigrated from Italy, so the
recipes and traditions of Italian food come naturally to him. His passion for
food is obvious as he describes the specialties, which include lasagna (veg-
etarian, verde, or meat-filled); ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese;
spaghetti with garlic, anchovy, and lemon zest; and a side of homemade
Italian sausage. Everything, in fact, is made by hand from fresh ingredi-
ents. Pizza lovers favor the Piedmonte, with that famous sausage and
mushrooms, and the Horacio, a cheeseless pizza with tomatoes, oregano,
and basil. Sandwiches come hot or cold and are a two-handed operation.
Rito’s is located 11⁄2 blocks off the malecón on Josefa Ortiz Domínguez next

Centro
INTERNATIONAL
Trio remains the darling of Vallarta restaurants, and is especially popular
with Vallarta’s local residents. Diners beat a path to this modest but stylish
cafe because the chef/owners Bernhard Güth and Ulf Henriksson both share
an undeniable passion for food, which is exhibited in each dish. Güth and
Henriksson have combined local ingredients with their impressive culinary
experience; the result is memorable entrees such as San Blas shrimp in 
a fennel-tomato vinaigrette served over broiled nopal cactus, herb risotto
with toasted sunflower seeds and quail, and pan-roasted sea bass 
with glazed grapes, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut in a white pepper
sauce — but these dishes may not be on the menu when you arrive
because Trio is a constantly changing work of art! Trio is noted for its 
perfect melding of Mexican and Mediterranean flavors. What’s great 
about this place, besides everything I’ve already mentioned, is that despite
a sophisticated menu, the atmosphere is always comfortable and 
welcoming — Bernhard and Ulf are regularly seen chatting with guests at
the end of an evening. A rooftop bar area makes for a comfortable wait for
a table or a great spot to enjoy an after-dinner coffee. A real treat!

BISTRO
This beachfront bistro was opened in late 2004 by the chef/owners of Trio,
and their recipe for success took hold from day one — the place is already
bustling at any hour, and has become the new favorite among local resi-
dents. Due to strategically-placed mirrors on the back wall, every seat has
a view of the ocean, while the eclectic interior is cheerful and inviting.
Seating is at small bistro-style tables, along a banquette that runs the
length of the back wall, or at the small but beautiful bar. The long, narrow
bistro faces the waterfront between the central plaza and river, which has
recently completed a restoration — extending the malecón to pass by
Vitea. But enough about looks — what counts here is the exceptional fare,
which is both classic and original. Starters include a tomato and Roquefort
salad with pecans, foie gras with Spanish plum sauce, and an exquisite
bistro salad with bacon. Quiche is always on the menu, with changing
selections, and main courses include chickpea ravioli with portobello
mushrooms, Wiener schintzel with salad, or a traditional steak frites.
Lunch offers lighter fare, including heavenly deli sandwiches. You won’t
be disappointed here, no matter what you order! There’s a full bar with an
excellent selection of wines, and the service is exceptional.

Tapas, anyone?
Certainly, much of modern Mexico’s culture draws on the important influence of Spain,
so it only makes sense that culinary traditions would be evident as well. Within the
last several years, dining on tapas has soared in popularity here. Of the many options,
these are my favorites: The long-standing Barcelona Tapas, Matamoros and 31 de
Octubre streets (% 322-222-0510), a large and lovely restaurant on a terrace built high
on a hillside, with sweeping views of the bay. They serve tapas and a selection of
Spanish entrees, including paella, from 5 p.m. to midnight. La Taberna de San Pascual,
Corona 176 (% 322-223-9371; Wed–Mon 4 p.m.–1 a.m., with bar service extending to
2 a.m.; closed Tues) is a cozy eatery, rich with brick walls and dark wood accents,
located on popular Corona Street, in the center of downtown. All ingredients are
imported from Spain, and there’s a selection of excellent Spanish wines to accom-
pany their flavorful tapas. La Esquina de los Caprichos, Miramar 402, corner of Iturbide
(% 322-222-0911; Mon–Sat 1–10 p.m.) is a tiny tapas place, known as having the most
reasonably priced ($2.50–$6) tapas in town, and perhaps the tastiest.

Centro
MEXICAN
Located in the heart of downtown, this creative Mexican restaurant has
earned raves for its intimate atmosphere and chef/owner Luis Fitch
Gómez’s exceptionally creative versions of the country’s culinary treas-
ures. It’s named for one of Mexico’s contributions to gastronomy — the
tomato (Xitomatl, in the ancient Aztec language of Náhuatl). The menu
mixes Mexican with Caribbean, Asian, and Mediterranean influences, and
the presentation is as creative as the preparation. Starters include the sig-
nature coconut shrimp in a tangy tamarind sauce, thinly sliced scallops
with cucumber and jicama julienne, or mushrooms stuffed with shrimp or
huitlacoche (itself, a mushroom that grows on corn stalks). Main courses
range from grilled salmon filet in a poblano chile sauce, to a tender rib eye
steak with mushrooms, delicately flavored with the Mexican herb, epazote.
The house specialty dessert is a Toluca ice cream cake. The warmly dec-
orated dining room is accented with tin star lamps and flickering candles.
An excellent wine list and full bar complement the exquisite dining.

D
ecisions, decisions . . . With so many fun-filled options competing for
your time, choosing among them may be the biggest problem you
encounter on a Vallarta vacation. Besides a bevy of beautiful beaches —
some secluded coves, others outrageous in their people-watching 
potential — dry land also offers intriguing and entertaining possibilities.
In this chapter, I give you an overview of the best beaches tucked into
the 42km (26 miles) of coastline surrounding Bahía de Banderas
(Banderas Bay) and the best ways to get to each. I also reveal the
most interesting sights in town and a few cool activities to try.
Vallarta is gaining recognition as a veritable treasure chest for ecotourism.
A number of tours permit you to explore the culture or nature of the
area — while having a sun-filled good time in the process. I cover these
excursions as well.
Hitting the Beaches
For years, beaches were Puerto Vallarta’s main attraction. Although 
visitors today explore more of the surrounding geography, the golden
sands and cobalt waters are still a powerful draw. The coast of Bahía de
Banderas covers more than 81km (50 miles), with 42km (26 miles) of
beaches ranging from action-packed party spots to secluded coves
accessible only by boat.

Northern beaches
The entire northern coastline from Punta Mita to Bucerías is a succes-
sion of sandy coves alternating with rocky inlets. For years, the beaches
to the north, with their long, clean breaks, have been the favored locale
for surfers.
Public transportation to any of the north-shore beaches is easy and inex-
pensive. Buses and minivans marked “Bucerías” or “Punta Mita” stop at
the bus stop in front of the airport gas station. You can ask your driver
to let you off at any of the beaches listed in this section. Buses generally
run every 20 minutes from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., but check with your hotel
concierge for current schedules. For the return trip, simply flag a bus
down. The fare is less than $2 each way; that price gets you all the way
to Punta Mita.
As you travel south on Highway 200A from Punta Mita, the first public
beach you come to is Playa Anclote — a broad, sandy beach with 
protected swimming areas and a few great palapa (thatched roof) 
restaurants. The water is gentle and shallow for quite a distance out,
and boats regularly anchor offshore and take dinghies in for a fresh fish
lunch. Of the restaurants, El Anclote and El Dorado have been the long-
standing favorites, but Mañana, by Chef Roger (% 329-291-6374), is
raising the culinary bar of this casual dining area. It’s open Tuesday
through Sunday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., in summer 1 to 9 p.m. All have beach
chairs available for your post-margarita nap in the sun.
You can also hire a panga (small motorized boat) at Playa Anclote from
the fisherman’s cooperative on the beach and have the captain take
you to the Marietas Islands just offshore. These uninhabited islands
are a great place for bird-watching, diving, snorkeling, or just exploring.
You can spot blue-footed booby birds (no joke) all along the islands’
rocky coast, and giant mantas, sea turtles, and colorful tropical fish
swim among the coral cliffs. The islands are honeycombed with caves
and hidden beaches — including the stunning Playa del Amor that only
appears at low tide. You enter a shallow passageway to access this semi-
circular stretch of sand. And a cave 12m (40 ft.) below the surface has
an air pocket where divers can dispose of their regulators and have an
underwater conversation! Humpback whales congregate around these
islands during the winter months, and you can rent a panga for a do-it-
yourself whale-watching excursion (trips cost about $20 per hour). You
can also visit these islands aboard one of the numerous day cruises that
depart from the cruise-ship terminal in Puerto Vallarta.
Further south is the rustic, natural setting of Playa Destiladeras. It has
talc-smooth sand and a couple of thatched-roof restaurants, making for
a quick but meaningful getaway from town. Playa Piedra Blanca and
Playa Manzanilla are beaches similar in style and spirit located just
before the curve in the bay, past the small town of La Cruz de Huanacaxtle.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
252

The small coastal town of Bucerías, with its broad, smooth-sand
beaches, has caught on as a great day trip. Come here from Puerto
Vallarta to enjoy the long, wide, and uncrowded beach, along with the
fresh seafood served at the beachfront restaurants or at one of the great
cafes. One of the top choices is Karen’s Place on the beach at the Costa
Dorada, calles Lázaro Cárdenas and Juárez (% 322-229-6892). Open
Tuesdays through Sundays from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., it caters to American
tastes and has a super Sunday brunch served from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday
is also street-market day in town, but in keeping with the casual pace of
Bucerías, the market doesn’t get going until noon or so. The Coral Reef
Surf Shop (Héroe de Nacozari 114 F; % 329-298-0261) offers a great
selection of surfboards and gear for sale. It also features surfboard and
boogie-board rentals, surf lessons, ATV tours, and other adventure tours
to surrounding areas.
The gold-sand beaches of Nuevo Vallarta are the main reason people
choose to stay in Nuevo Vallarta hotels. Nuevo Vallarta is south of
Bucerías, and technically you could say that it also falls on the northern
coastline. If you want to check the beaches out for yourself, spend a day
at the Etc. Beach Club (Paseo de los Cocoteros 38; % 322-297-0174).
This casual beach club has a volleyball net, showers, restroom facilities,
and food and drink service on the beach (both day and night). Public
transportation is okay to get to Nuevo Vallarta, because it’s the most
economic way to get there in relative comfort — the buses are fairly new
and some even are air-conditioned. Taxis are a bit expensive — $15 one
way, but they’re a faster, more convenient way to get to Nuevo Vallarta.
To get here from Puerto Vallarta, take the second entrance to Nuevo
Vallarta and turn right on Paseo de los Cocoteros; it’s past the Vista
Bahía hotel. The club is open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Bring cash for
food and drink purchases — credit cards aren’t accepted.
Central and town beaches
In Chapter 16, I caution you that the beaches at Marina Vallarta, with
darker sand and seasonal inflows of stones, are the least desirable in the
area. If you’re a traveler whose priority is the beauty of the beach, ven-
ture to areas other than Marina Vallarta. Though it has its charms, the
beaches aren’t among them. If you do choose to make it a beach day
in Marina Vallarta, Nikki Beach, at the Westin hotel, is the place to go.
The oversized lounge beds are great for soaking up the sun, sipping a
cool beverage, and enjoying the spot’s fusion cuisine and hip tunes.
Shade umbrellas are available. It’s among the most comfortable ways
to enjoy a beach day in the area.
The Hotel Zone beach runs for 5km (3 miles) from just beyond the cruise-
ship terminal to the north to just south of the malecón (boardwalk).
The names of the beaches change along the way, from Playa de Oro to
Playa Camarones, but most people just refer to the hotel property that
the beaches front.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 253

It’s a wide, clean, and generally uncrowded stretch of sand, but the
shore does drop steeply just offshore. This is the best place to rent
watersports equipment, especially Jet Skis and sailboards.
As you reach the central town, you may notice that relatively few people
choose to swim along the central stretch of sand running from the start
of the malecón to the Río Cuale, because it’s more of a commercial area,
and there are no services for chairs or beverages on the sand, although
it’s a popular place for parasailing.
Playa Los Muertos (also known as Playa Olas Altas or Playa del Sol)
begins just south of the Río Cuale and is hands-down the most popular
town beach. The water can be rough here, but the wide beach is home
to a large array of palapa restaurants with food, beverage, and beach-
chair service. The two most popular spots to grab some grub are the
adjacent El Dorado and La Palapa (see Chapter 18 for a detailed review
of the latter), both of which are located at the end of Calle Pulpito. On the
southern end of this beach is a section known as “Blue Chairs” — the
most popular gay beach. Vendors stroll the length of Los Muertos, and
beach volleyball, parasailing, and Jet Skis are all popular pastimes.
Playa Mismaloya is in a sheltered cove about 10km (6 miles) south of
town along Highway 200. The water here is clear and beautiful and ideal
for snorkeling off the beach. Entrance to the public beach is just to the
left of the Barceló La Jolla de Mismaloya (% 322-226-0660; www.
lajollademismaloya.com). Colorful palapa restaurants dot the small
beach, and you can rent beach chairs for sunbathing. You can also stake
out a table under a palapa for the day. Using a restaurant’s table and
palapa is a reciprocal arrangement — the restaurant provides a comfort-
able place to hang out, and you buy your drinks, snacks, and lunch there.
The 1960s Richard Burton movie, The Night of the Iguana, was filmed at
Mismaloya. La Jolla de Mismaloya has a restaurant, The Sets of The Night
of the Iguana Restaurant, on the restored film set that’s open daily noon
to 11 p.m. The movie runs continuously in John Huston’s Restaurant
(serving drinks and light snacks 11 a.m.–6 p.m.) located below the The
Sets of The Night of the Iguana.
About 5km (3 miles) past Mismaloya is Boca de Tomatlán, which is 
similar in setup to Mismaloya but without a large resort looming in the
background. Both Mismaloya and Boca de Tomatlán are accessible by
public buses that depart from Lázaro Cárdenas Park, at the corner of
Basilio Badillo and Insurgentes, every 15 minutes from 5:30 a.m. to
10 p.m. and cost just 50¢. La Boca is the end of the bus line and the
point at which the highway turns inland.
South-shore beaches
Boca de Tomatlán is the jumping-off point for the south-shore beaches
of Las Animas, Quimixto, and Yelapa, all of which are accessible only
by boat. In addition to having the ambience of a south-seas cove, each
location offers intriguing hikes to jungle waterfalls and plays host to
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
254

restaurants that front a wide beach. Las Animas is my favorite of the
three spots. The beach has the most tranquil waters for swimming and
two rocky headlands for protection. Quimixto’s palm-fringed crescent
of sand takes a back seat to hiking and horseback rides to the waterfall.
Although the waterfall rages impressively from August to January, as the
dry winter season progresses, you’re likely to be less than blown away.
Yelapa, located on a beautiful sheltered cove, is the most remote location
of these three beaches. Once a haven for those looking to escape the
confines of society — or equally likely, the law — it became a popular
haven for long-term, expatriate visitors and artists due to its seclusion,
natural beauty, and simplicity of life. Yelapa has no cars, has one lone
paved (pedestrian-only) road, and got electricity only in the past three
years. It offers a few primitive accommodations, plus one stunning six-
villa inn, Verana (Chapter 16 has a detailed review), as well as beachside
restaurants and hikes to one of two jungle waterfalls. Although the
mellow attitude still prevails, yoga is rapidly becoming the preferred
way to reach an altered state of mind here.
Finding Water Fun for Everyone
You haven’t experienced Puerto Vallarta unless you’ve been to the bay —
on a boat, under the water, or playing along the shoreline. Bahía de
Banderas is as deep as the surrounding mountains are high, and with the
wealth of sea life found here, you’re as likely to spot whales or dolphins
as you are to see other tour boats. The view of town from the bay is
simply stunning. And, when it comes to having fun in the water, your
biggest challenge is deciding what to do first.
Cruising Puerto Vallarta
Puerto Vallarta offers a number of different boat trips, including sunset
cruises and trips for snorkeling, swimming, and diving. Most of the
excursions generally travel one of two routes: to the Marietas Islands,
which are about a 30- to 45-minute boat ride off the northern shore of
Bahía de Banderas, or to Yelapa, Las Animas, or Quimixto along the
southern shore.
All the trips to the southern beaches make a stop at Los Arcos, an island
rock formation south of Puerto Vallarta, for snorkeling. Don’t base your
opinion of underwater Puerto Vallarta on this location though. Dozens of
tour boats dump large numbers of snorkelers overboard at the same time
each day, and the fish have figured out not to be there at that time. Los
Arcos is, however, an excellent site for night diving.
When comparing all the boat cruises, note that some include lunch and
most provide music and an open bar on board. Most boats leave around
9:30 a.m., stop for 45 minutes of snorkeling, arrive at the beach destination
around noon for a two-and-a-half-hour stay, and return around 3 p.m.
At Quimixto and Yelapa, visitors can take a half-hour hike to a jungle
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 255

waterfall or rent a horse for the trip. Prices range from $45 for a sunset
cruise or a trip (with open bar) to one of the beaches to $85 for an all-
day outing with open bar and meals.
Here are some great choices for a boat cruise:
 One boat, the Marigalante (% 322-223-0309; www.marigalante.
com.mx), an exact replica of Columbus’s ship the Santa María, was
built in honor of the 500-year anniversary of his voyage to the
Americas. It offers a daytime “pirate’s cruise” complete with picnic
barbecue and treasure hunt and a sunset dinner cruise with folk-
loric dance and fireworks. The day tour is $65 per person, and the
sunset dinner cruise is $75 per person.
 My choice for the best day trip is an excursion to Caletas, the
cove where John Huston (the director of such movie classics as
The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, and the Vallarta-
filmed The Night of the Iguana) made his home for years. Vallarta
Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S., or 322-297-1212;
www.vallarta-adventures.com) holds the exclusive lease on this
private cove and has done an excellent job of restoring Huston’s
former home, adding exceptional day-spa facilities, and landscaping
the beach, which is wonderful for snorkeling or diving. The quality
facilities, combined with the relative privacy that this day trip offers
at $75 per person, has made it one of the most popular excursions.
Vallarta Adventures also offers an evening cruise that comes com-
plete with dinner and a spectacular contemporary dance show,
“Rhythms of the Night.”
 Whale-watching tours are becoming more popular each year
because spotting humpback whales is almost a certainty from 
mid-November (sometimes a few weeks later) through March.
For centuries, these majestic whales have migrated to Bahía de
Banderas (called Humpback Bay in the 1600s) to reproduce and
bear calves. Open Air Expeditions (Guerrero 339; % 322-222-3310;
www.vallartawhales.com) is the noted, local, whale-watching
authority. These folks offer ecologically oriented tours (for up to
12 people) in small, specially designed, soft boats that allow for
better observation from a level that is closer to water, and the
sound of their engine is less disturbing to the whales than the
engines of the larger boats. The twice-daily, $80 tours (8:30 a.m.–
2:30 p.m.) last four hours and include a healthful snack.
 Vallarta Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S., or 322-297-
1212) offers whale-watching photo excursions in small boats for
$70. The trip includes a pre-departure briefing on whale behaviors.
This company also features whale-watching on its tours to the
Marietas Islands. For $80 you get lunch, time at a private beach,
and an ambience that is more festive than educational while travel-
ing aboard the large catamaran boats.

Skiing and surfing
Watersports — including water-skiing, parasailing, and windsurfing — are
available at many beaches along the Bahía de Banderas. The best-known
spot for watersports-equipment rental is Club Bananas Water Sports
Center, which is located on the beachfront of the Las Palmas Hotel
(Av. Francisco Medina Ascencio Km 2.5, Hotel Zone; % 322-226-1220;
ask for the Water Sports Center). WaveRunners, banana boats, and
water-skiing equipment are available for hourly, half-day, or full-day
rentals. You can also find rental equipment at Playa Los Muertos in
between La Palapa and El Dorado restaurants.
Exploring the deep blue
Although Puerto Vallarta lacks the crystal-clear waters of Cancún and
other Caribbean coastal venues, it’s still a great dive site. The reefs are
much smaller than those in Caribbean destinations; however, the abun-
dance of marine life is spectacular. You can see a great variety of sea life,
including giant mantas, sea turtles, dolphins, and tropical fish. During
the winter months, you’re also apt to hear the beautiful underwater
songs of humpback whales as you dive. Underwater enthusiasts from
beginners to experts can arrange scuba diving with the following folks:
 Vallarta Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S., or 322-297-1212;
www.vallarta-adventures.com) is a five-star PADI dive center
that offers instructional programs ranging from the resort-course
level to instructor certification. Dives take place at Los Arcos, a
company-owned site at Caletas Cove, Quimixto Coves, the Marietas
Islands, and the offshore El Morro and Chimo reefs.
 Chico’s Dive Shop (Díaz Ordaz 772–5, near Carlos O’Brian’s; % 322-
222-1895; www.chicos-diveshop.com) offers similar dive trips
and is also a PADI five-star dive center. Chico’s is open daily 8 a.m.
to 10 p.m. and has branches at the Marriott, Vidafel, Villa del Palmar,
Camino Real, Paradise Village, and Playa Los Arcos hotels.
Sailing away
Put some wind in your sails and experience the bay in the most natural
of ways:
 Sail Vallarta (Club de Tenis Puesta del Sol, Local 7-B, Marina Vallarta;
% 322-221-0096; sailvallarta@bancomer.com) offers several 
different sailboats for hire. A group day-sail, including crew, use of
snorkeling equipment, beer and sodas, food, and music, costs $65.
Most trips include a crew, but you can make arrangements to sail
yourself or on a smaller boat. Prices vary for full boat charters
depending on the vessel and amount of time you want to spend
on the water.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 257

 Vallarta Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S., or 322-297-1212;
www.vallarta-adventures.com) also offers two beautiful sailboats
for charter and small group sails (up to 12 people for day or evening
sails). Daytime sailing charters are priced at $80 per person, where
sunset sails are $60 per person. The service is superb, as is the
quality of the food and beverages served on board. And the Vallarta
Adventures boats are known for being the sailboats most frequently
under sail — many of the other sailing charters prefer to simply
motor around the bay.
 The newest addition to Vallarta’s sailing scene is most impressive —
Coming About (% 322-222-4119; www.coming-about.com) is a
women-only sailing school that provides hands-on sailing instruction
for day-sailing excursions, as well as week-long sailing classes at a
variety of skill levels. Owned and operated by Pat Henry, who spent
eight years sailing around the globe, then wrote about it in her
book, By the Grace of the Sea: A Woman’s Solo Odyssey Around the
World, the classes are challenging, inspiring, and entertaining, as
Pat shares her adventures with participants. Dubbed “any woman’s
sailing school,” the goal is to take away the fear and the mystery,
and make the skill of sailing accessible to everyone. Courses range
from a one-day introductory course to a nine-day bareboat charter
captain course. Fees for the one-day course are $475 for four people;
$2,800 to $3,600 for the nine-day course, including hotel.
Reeling in the big one
You can arrange a fishing trip through travel agencies or through the
Cooperativa de Pescadores (Fishing Cooperative; % 322-222-1202)
on the malecón north of the Río Cuale, next door to the Rosita Hotel.
Fishing charters cost $180 (for four hours) to $350 a day for four to eight
people; price varies with the boat size. Although the posted price at the
fishing cooperative is the same as what you’d find through travel agen-
cies, you may be able to negotiate a lower price at the cooperative.
Bring cash — the cooperative doesn’t accept credit cards. It’s open
Monday to Saturday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., but make arrangements
a day in advance. You can also arrange fishing trips at the Marina
Vallarta docks or by calling Fishing with Carolina (% 322-224-7250
or wireless [044] 322-292-2953; fishingwithcarolina@hotmail.com),
which features a 9m (30-ft.) Uniflite Sportsfisher fully equipped with an
English-speaking crew. Fishing trips generally include equipment and
bait, but drinks, snacks, and lunch are optional, so check to find out
what the price includes.
Swimming with dolphins
Ever been kissed by a dolphin? Take advantage of a unique and absolutely
memorable opportunity to swim with Pacific bottlenose dolphins in a
clear lagoon or oceanarium. Dolphin Adventure (% 866-256-2739 from
the U.S., or 322-297-1212; www.vallarta-adventures.com) operates an
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
258

interactive dolphin-research facility — considered the finest in Latin
America — that allows a limited number of people to swim with the dol-
phins Monday through Saturday at scheduled times. Cost for the swim is
$128, and advance reservations are required — they’re generally sold
out at least a week in advance.
You may prefer the Dolphin Encounter ($60) at the same facility, which
allows you to touch and discover more about these dolphins in smaller
pools, so you’re ensured up-close and personal time with these fascinat-
ing creatures — it’s also a better choice for children. You can even be a
Trainer for a Day, a special seven-hour program of working alongside
the more experienced trainers and the dolphins, for a cost of $250. The
new Dolphin Kids program, for children ages 4 to 8, is a gentle introduc-
tion to dolphins, featuring the Dolphin Adventure baby dolphins and
their mothers interacting with the children participants ($60).
Dolphin Adventures has two facilities — one in the lagoon of Nuevo
Vallarta, and a newer, more expansive oceanarium-style facility on
Av. Las Palmas No. 39-A., which also serves as the headquarters of
Vallarta Adventures. The oceanarium gets my highest recommendation.
The experience leaves you with an indescribable sensation, and it’s a
joy to see these dolphins — they’re well cared for, happy, and spirited.
After a few swims with these dolphins, I now consider them to be my
friends, and they even remember me — that’s how it seems to me
anyway. The program is about education and interaction, not entertain-
ment or amusement, and I especially recommend it for children 10 and
older.
Swimming with dolphins has its critics and supporters. You may want
to visit the Whale and Dolphins Conservation Society’s Web site at
www.wdcs.org. For more information about responsible travel in gen-
eral, check out these Web sites: Tread Lightly (www.treadlightly.org)
and the International Ecotourism Society (www.ecotourism.org).
Enjoying Land Sports
What’s great about Puerto Vallarta is that many of the best things to do
on land here are free. Vallarta is a town of simple pleasures — walking
along the malécon at sunset, catching a concert at the open-air theater
across from the central plaza, strolling through the impressive Our Lady
of Guadalupe church, or wandering into any of the dozens of local art
galleries.
In addition to these laid-back diversions, Puerto Vallarta is a virtual play-
ground for activities ranging from mountain biking to golf. Eco-friendly
tours can take you into the tropical jungle or to remote mountain villages.
I bet that you can find more things to do here than you have days in
which to do them.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 259

Teeing off
Puerto Vallarta is rapidly positioning itself to rival Los Cabos as Mexico’s
golf capital. Five new courses have opened in recent years, and the Vista
Vallarta Golf Club was the site of the 2002 World Golf Championships-
World Cup.
A set of fairways and greens that has been around for awhile is the
Joe Finger–designed course at the Marina Vallarta Golf Club (% 322-
221-0073), an 18-hole, par-74, private course that winds through the
Marina Vallarta peninsula and provides great ocean views. It’s for mem-
bers only, but most of the luxury hotels in Puerto Vallarta have member-
ships that their guests can use. A bar, restaurant, and pro shop are on
the premises, and a golf pro is around to offer his services. The greens
fees are $121, or $88 after 2 p.m. in high season and $115 during low
season. (These rates may vary depending on the type of membership
your hotel has.) Fees include golf cart, range balls, and tax. Caddies
charge $10. Club rentals, lessons, and special packages are also available.
North of town in the state of Nayarit, about 16km (10 miles) beyond
Puerto Vallarta, is the public, 18-hole, par-72 Los Flamingos Club de Golf
(% 329-296-5006; www.flamingosgolf.com.mx), the oldest course in
town. It features beautiful jungle vegetation and has just undergone a
course renovation and upgrade. The club is open from 6:30 a.m. to
7:00 p.m. daily and has a snack bar (but no restaurant) and full pro shop.
The greens fee is $95 and includes the use of a golf cart; a caddy charges
$20, and club rentals are $30 to $40. A free shuttle service is available
from downtown Puerto Vallarta; call for pickup times and locations.
The breathtaking Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course at the Four Seasons
Punta Mita (% 322-291-6000) is as challenging as it is stunning. It has
eight oceanfront holes, but you can see the ocean from every hole on the
course. Its hallmark is Hole 3B, the “Tail of the Whale,” with a long drive
to a green located on a natural island — the only natural-island green
in the Americas. It requires an amphibious golf cart to take you to the
green when the tide is high, and the management has thoughtfully added
an alternative-play hole for times when the ocean or tides aren’t accom-
modating. The course is open only to guests of the Four Seasons resort
or to members of other golf clubs with a letter of introduction from their
pro. Selected other Vallarta-area hotels also have guest privileges — ask
your concierge. Greens fees for guests of the Four Seasons are $170, $230
for non-guests, including cart, with club rentals (Calloway) an extra $60.
Golf lessons are also available.
A second Jack Nicklaus course is at the Vista Vallarta Golf Club
(% 322-290-0030; www.vistavallartagolf.com), along with one
designed by Tom Weiskopf. These courses were the site of the 2002
World Golf Championships-World Cup. Vista Vallarta is in the foothills
of the Sierra Madre, behind the bullring in Puerto Vallarta. A round
costs $167 per person, with cart rental fees priced at $43, and club
rentals $45 per set/per round.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
260

The Robert von Hagge–designed El Tigre course at Paradise Village in
Nuevo Vallarta (% 322-297-0773; www.eltigregolf.com) opened in
March 2002. The 6,515m (21,717-ft.) course is on a relatively flat piece of
land, but the design incorporates challenging bunkers, undulating fair-
ways, and water features on several holes. El Tigre offers lessons and
has an expansive clubhouse. Greens fees are $185 a round, or $85 if you
play after 2 p.m. and clubs rental $45.
Taking time for tennis
Many hotels in Puerto Vallarta offer excellent tennis facilities, several
with clay courts, and there’s also a full-service public tennis club. The
Canto del Sol Tennis Club (% 322-224-0123; www.cantodelsol.com),
located at the Canto del Sol hotel in the Hotel Zone, offers indoor and
outdoor courts (including a clay court), a full pro shop, lessons, clinics,
and partner match-ups.
Trailing away
One of the best ways to get some exercise, and see some great local
sites in the process, is to take a mountain-bike tour with Bike Mex
(Calle Guerrero 361; % 322-223-1834; www.bikemex.com). Bike Mex
offers expert guided biking and hiking tours up the Río Cuale canyon
and to outlying areas. The popular Río Cuale bike trip costs $44 for four
hours and includes bike, helmet, gloves, insurance, water, breakfast,
lunch, and an English-speaking guide. Trips take off at either 9 a.m. or
2 p.m., but starting times are flexible; make arrangements a day ahead.
And . . . did I say Yelapa is accessible only by boat? For anyone serious
about their biking, I’ve traveled with Bike Mex on its all-day, advanced-
level bike trip to this magical cove, and it’s great. You and your fellow
riders depart at 7:00 a.m. in a van and travel to your starting point in
the town of El Tuito. The 53km (33-mile) ride includes 30km (19 miles)
of climbs to a peak elevation of a little more than 1,000m (3,600 ft.).
The journey covers switchbacks, fire roads, single tracks, awesome
climbs, and steep downhills before ending up at a beachfront palapa
restaurant in Yelapa. You have the option of staying the night in Yelapa
or returning that afternoon by small boat. This tour costs $160, takes
seven to eight hours, and includes all bike gear, drinks, lunch, boat and
land transportation, guide, and ample encouragement.
Other bicycle trips are also available. Guided hiking tours are available
along the same routes. The prices start at $30 and vary depending on
the route.
Saddling up
You can arrange guided horseback rides through travel agents or directly
with one of the local ranches. Rancho Palma Real (Carretera Vallarta-
Tepic 4766; % 322-222-0501; Fax: 322-222-8101; ranchopalmareal@
hotmail.com) offers by far the nicest horseback riding tour in the area.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 261

The horses are in excellent health and condition, plus you get an added
tour of local farms on your way to the ranch. The office is five minutes
north of the airport, and the ranch is in Las Palmas, approximately
40 minutes northeast of Vallarta. The horses are in excellent condition,
and you enjoy a tour of local farms on your way to the ranch. Breakfast
and lunch are included with the $62 fee.
Rancho El Charro (Av. Francisco Villa 895; % 322-224-0114; www.rancho
elcharro.com) and Rancho Ojo de Agua (Cerrada de Cardenal 227;
%/fax 322-224-0607) also offer high-quality tours. Both of these ranches
are about a 10-minute taxi ride north of downtown toward the Sierra
Madre foothills. The morning and sunset rides last three hours and take
you up into the mountains overlooking the ocean and town. The cost is
$52. They also have their own comfortable base camp for serious riders
who want to stay out overnight.
Enjoying an ecotour
The Sierra Madre Expedition is an excellent tour offered by Vallarta
Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S., or 322-297-1212; www.
vallarta-adventures.com). This daily excursion travels in special
Mercedes all-terrain vehicles through jungle trails north of Puerto
Vallarta, stopping at a small town and in a forest for a brief nature walk.
The tour winds up on a pristine secluded beach for lunch and swimming.
The $75 outing is worthwhile because it takes tourists on exclusive trails
through scenery that would otherwise be off-limits.
In addition to their seasonal whale-watching excursions, Open Air
Expeditions (% 322-222-3310; www.vallartawhales.com) offers other
nature-oriented trips, including bird-watching outings and ocean kayak-
ing sessions in Punta Mita. The tours at Ecotours de México (Ignacio
L. Vallarta 243; % 322-222-6606; www.ecotoursvallarta.com) include
seasonal trips (Aug–Nov) to a turtle preservation camp where you can
witness baby Olive Ridley turtles hatch.
Tukari Tours travel agency (% 322-224-7177; Fax: 322-224-2350;
www.tukari.com) specializes in ecological and culturally oriented tours.
These folks can arrange bird-watching trips to the fertile birding grounds
near San Blas (three to four hours north of Puerto Vallarta in the state of
Nayarit), shopping trips to Tlaquepaque and Tonalá (six hours inland
near Guadalajara), or a day trip to Rancho Altamira (a 20-hectare/50-acre
hilltop working ranch) for a barbecue lunch and horseback riding fol-
lowed by a stroll through El Tuito, a small colonial-era village nearby.
They can also arrange an unforgettable morning at Terra Noble Spa Art
and Healing Center (% 322-223-3530 or 222-5400; www.terranoble.com),
a mountaintop day spa and center for the arts where participants can
get a massage or treatment, work in clay and paint, and have lunch in a
heavenly setting overlooking the bay.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
262

Vallarta’s newest adventure activity is a canopy tour, operated by
Vallarta Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S., or 322-297-1212;
www.vallarta-adventures.com). You glide from treetop to treetop,
getting an up-close-and-personal look at a tropical rain forest canopy
and the trails far below. Expert guides assist you to the special platforms,
and you move from one platform to another using pulleys on horizontal
traverse cables, while the guides explain the tropical flora surrounding
you. The guides also offer assistance — and moral support! — as you
rappel back down to the forest floor. Tours depart from the Vallarta
Adventures offices in both Marina Vallarta and Nuevo Vallarta at 8 a.m.,
returning at 2 p.m. The price ($75 for adults, $50 for children 8–12)
includes the tour, unlimited non-alcoholic beverages, and light snacks.
A second option for a canopy tour is available in the southern jungles of
Vallarta, over the Orquidias River, with Canopy Tours de Los Veranos
(% 322-223-6060; www.canopytours-vallarta.com). This tour picks
you up at the Canopy office, near the southside Pemex station, to trans-
port you to their facilities upriver from Mismaloya. Departures are at 9,
10, and 11 a.m., noon, and 1 and 2 p.m. In addition to the 13 cables — the
longest being a full 350m (1,150 ft.) — it also offers climbing walls, water
slides, and horseback riding. Price is $80 for adults, or $50 for children
ages 6 to 12. Use of the natural-granite climbing wall (helmets and climb-
ing shoe use included) is $18; a 90-minute jungle horseback riding tour
costs $35.
Sightseeing in Puerto Vallarta
Puerto Vallarta, itself, is a sight to see — cobblestone streets lined with
tiny shops, rows of windows edged with curling wrought iron, and vistas
of red-tile roofs set against the sea. Start with a walk up and down the
malecón, the boardwalk that borders the main seaside street.
One of the great pleasures of strolling Puerto Vallarta’s malecón is
taking in the fanciful sculptures that line this seaside promenade.
Among the notable works on display is Nostalgia, located across from
Carlos O’Brian’s restaurant. Created by Ramiz Barquet, this sculpture
depicts a couple sharing a romantic moment while gazing out on the
bay. Farther south is the sculpture group at the Rotonda del Mar,
locally known as Fantasy by the Sea. It’s an array of sculpture “chairs”
by renowned Mexican artist Alejandro Colunga. This wildly creative
series — one chair is topped by a large octopus head, another bench
has two giant ears for backrests — seems to always draw a crowd.
Closer to the main square is the Boy on the Seahorse sculpture, an image
that has come to represent this resort town. Photo ops abound — don’t
miss the fountain across from the main square; its three bronze dolphins
seem ready to leap right into the bay.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 263

Across the street from the fountain is the palacio municipal (city hall),
located on the main square (next to the tourism office). Besides housing
the local government, the building has a large Manuel Lepe mural painted
inside its stairwell. Nearby, up Calle Independencia, sits the Parish of
Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe church (Hidalgo 370; % 322-222-1326),
topped with its curious crown held in place by angels — a replica of the
one worn by Empress Carlota during her brief time in Mexico as Emperor
Maximilian’s wife. On the church steps, women sell religious mementos,
and across the narrow street, vendors sell native herbs for curing common
ailments. Services in English are held Sundays at 10 a.m. (in Jan, there’s
also a 5 p.m. Mass in English). Regular parish hours are from 7 a.m. until
9:30 or 10 p.m. daily.
Three blocks south of the church, head east on Calle Libertad, lined with
small shops and pretty second-story windows, to the municipal market
by the river. After exploring the market, cross the bridge to the island
on the river; sometimes a painter is at work on the island’s banks. Walk
down the center of the island toward the sea, and you come to the tiny
Museo Río Cuale (no phone), which has a small but impressive perma-
nent exhibit of pre-Columbian figurines. It’s open Monday to Saturday
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.
Retrace your steps back to the market and Calle Libertad and follow
Calle Miramar to the brightly colored steps up to Calle Zaragoza. There
are close to 100 steps, but you walk leisurely to climb them and coming
down is a breeze; the idea is to experience the streets of Vallarta and the
feel of this place that was built on the side of the mountain. Up Zaragoza
a block to the right is the famous pink arched bridge that once connected
Richard Burton’s and Elizabeth Taylor’s houses. This area, known as
“Gringo Gulch,” is where many Americans have houses.
You can also tour the Taylor-Burton villas (Casa Kimberley; Calle
Zaragoza 445; % 322-222-1336; www.casakimberley.com). Tours of the
two houses once owned by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton cost $8.
Just ring the bell between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and if
the manager is available, he’ll take you through the house.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
264
A Spectacular Sight
Performances of the Papantla Flyers (Voladores de Papantla), take place every Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday night at 6:00 to 6:30, 8:00 to 8:30, and 9:30 to 10:00 p.m., on the
malecón, adjacent to the “Boy on a Seahorse” statue. In this pre-Columbian religious
ritual four men are suspended from the top of a tall pole, circling around it (as if in flight),
while another beats a drum and plays a flute while balancing himself at the top. It sig-
nifies the four cardinal points, and the mystic “center” of the self, a sacred direction
for ancient Mexican cultures.

You can get a peek at some of the other villas in Vallarta every Wednesday
and Thursday (late Nov through Easter) on the International Friendship
Club private-home tours (% 322-222-5466). You get to view four
private villas in town for a donation of $30 per person with proceeds
benefiting local charities. Tour arrangements begin at 10 a.m. at the
Hotel Molino de Agua (Av. Ignacio L. Vallarta 130, adjacent to the south-
bound bridge over the Río Cuale), where you can buy breakfast while
you wait for the group to gather. Arrive early because this tour sells out
quickly! The tour departs at 11 a.m. and lasts approximately two and a
half hours.
Thanks to a recently completed expansion of the malecón, you can
now continue strolling the malecón from the Los Arcos Amphitheater
along the water’s edge and over a pedestrian bridge located where the
River Cuale meets the sea, directly into the Los Muertos beach zone.
Hotel travel desks and travel agencies can book you on the ever-popular
Tropical Tour or Jungle Tour ($30 each), a basic orientation to the area.
These tours are really expanded city tours that include a drive through
the workers’ village of Pitillal, the affluent neighborhood of Conchas
Chinas, the cathedral, the market, the Taylor-Burton houses, and lunch
at a jungle restaurant. Any stop for shopping usually means the driver
picks up commission for what you buy.
Shopping Puerto Vallarta
What makes shopping in Puerto Vallarta so great is that it’s generally
concentrated in small, eclectic, and independent shops rather than
impersonal malls. You can find excellent-quality folk art, original cloth-
ing designs, and fine home accessories at great prices. Vallarta is known
for having the most diverse and impressive selection of contemporary
Mexican fine art available outside Mexico City. If you want the more typ-
ical Mexico resort shopping experience, don’t worry — you can still find
plenty of tacky T-shirts and the ever-present silver jewelry.
The best shopping is concentrated in a few key areas: central downtown,
the Marina Vallarta malecón, the popular mercados, and on the beach —
where the merchandise comes to you. Some of the more attractive shops
are found 1 to 2 blocks in back of the malecón. Although still home to
a few interesting shops, the marina boardwalk (marina malecón) is 
dominated by real estate companies, timeshare vendors, restaurants,
and boating services. Start at the intersection of calles Corona and
Morelos — you can find interesting shops in all directions from here.
Marina Vallarta does offer two shopping plazas (Plaza Marina and Plaza
Neptuno, both on the main highway coming from the airport into town),
but both have a limited selection of shops, with Plaza Neptuno primarily
dedicated to items for the home.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 265

Puerto Vallarta’s municipal market is just north of the Río Cuale where
Libertad and A. Rodríguez meet. The mercado sells clothes, jewelry,
serapes, shawls, leather accessories and suitcases, papier-mâché par-
rots, stuffed frogs and armadillos, and of course, T-shirts. Be sure to
do some comparison-shopping and definitely bargain before buying.
The market is open daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Up the mercado stairs, a food
market serves inexpensive Mexican meals — for more adventurous
diners, it’s probably the best value and most authentic dining experi-
ence in Vallarta. You can find an outdoor market along Río Cuale Island,
between the two bridges. Vendors sell crafts, gifts, folk art, and clothing.
New to downtown is the Small Vallarta (% 322-222-7530) on Paseo Díaz
Ordaz 928, on the eastern side, just before the start of the malecón. It is
a “small mall” featuring tourist-friendly shops and dining options, includ-
ing Carl Junior’s burgers, Häagen-Dazs ice cream, Swatch watch shop,
El Mundo de Tequila, and a Diamonds International jewelry store.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
266
Huichol Indian art: 
What it is and where to buy it
Puerto Vallarta offers the best selection of Huichol art in Mexico. Descendants of the
Aztecs, the Huichol Indians are one of the last remaining indigenous cultures in the
world that has remained true to its ancient traditions, customs, language, and habi-
tat. The Huichol live in adobe structures in the mountains north and east of Puerto
Vallarta. Due to the decreasing fertility of the land surrounding their villages, they now
depend more on the sale of their artwork for sustenance.
Huichol art has always been cloaked in a veil of mysticism — probably one of the rea-
sons this form of artesanía (handicrafts) is so sought after by serious collectors.
Huichol art is characterized by colorful, symbolic yarn “paintings,” inspired by visions
experienced during spiritual ceremonies. In these ceremonies, artists ingest peyote,
a hallucinogenic cactus, which induces brightly colored visions; these are consid-
ered to be messages from their ancestors. The symbolic and mythological imagery
seen in these visions is reflected in the art, which encompasses not only yarn paint-
ings but also fascinating masks and bowls decorated with tiny colored beads.
The Huichol may be geographically isolated, but they have business savvy and have
adapted their art to meet consumer demand — original Huichol art, therefore, isn’t
necessarily traditional. Designs depicting iguanas, jaguars, sea turtles, frogs, eclipses,
and eggs are a result of popular demand. For more traditional works, look for pieces
that depict deer, scorpions, wolves, or snakes.
You may also see Huichol Indians on the streets of Vallarta, dressed in white clothing
embroidered with colorful designs. A number of fine galleries that sell Huichol pieces
are located in downtown Puerto Vallarta (see “Decorative and folk art” and “Crafts and
gifts,” later in this chapter). A notable place for finding out more about the Huicholes
is Huichol Collection, Morelos 490, across from the seahorse statue on the malecón

Along any public beach, walking vendors approach tourists and try to
sell merchandise ranging from silver jewelry to rugs, T-shirts to masks.
“Almost free!” they call out in seemingly relentless efforts to attract your
attention. If you’re too relaxed to think of shopping in town, this can be
an entertaining alternative for picking up a few souvenirs. (Remember
that bargaining is expected.) The most reputable beach vendors are con-
centrated at Playa Los Muertos in front of the El Dorado and La Palapa
restaurants (on the beach near Calle Pulpito).
You need to be aware that much of the silver sold on the beach is actu-
ally alpaca, a lesser-quality silver metal (even though many pieces are
still stamped with the designation “9.25,” supposedly indicating that it’s
true silver). The prices for and quality of silver on the beach are much
lower than they are elsewhere. If you’re looking for a more lasting piece
of jewelry, you’re better off shopping in a true silver shop.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 267
(% 322-223-2141). This shop offers an extensive selection of Huichol art in all price
ranges, and it has a replica of a Huichol adobe hut, informational displays explaining
more about their fascinating way of life and beliefs, and usually a Huichol Indian at
work creating art.
Huichol art falls into two main categories: yarn paintings and beaded pieces. All other
items you may find in Huichol art galleries are either ceremonial objects or items used
in their everyday lives:
 Yarn paintings are made on a wood base covered with wax that is meticulously
overlaid with colored yarn. Designs represent the magical vision of the under-
world, and each symbol gives meaning to the piece. Paintings made with wool
yarn are more authentic than those made with acrylic; however, acrylic yarn paint-
ings are usually brighter and have more detail because the threads are thinner.
Finding empty spaces where the wax base shows is normal. Usually the artist
starts with a central motif and works around it, but having several independent
motifs that, when combined, take on a different meaning is common. A painting
with many small designs tells a more complicated story than one with only one
design and fill-work on the background. Look for the story of the piece on the back
of the painting. Most Huichol artists write in pencil in Huichol and Spanish.
 Beaded pieces are made on carved wooden shapes depicting different animals,
wooden eggs, or small bowls made from gourds. The artist covers the pieces with
wax and applies tiny chaquira beads one by one to form different designs. Usually
the beaded designs represent animals; plants; the elements of fire, water, or air;
and certain symbols that give a special meaning to the whole. Beadwork with
many small designs that don’t exactly fit into one another is more time consum-
ing and has a more complex symbolic meaning. This kind of work has empty
spaces where the wax shows.

In most of the better-quality shops and galleries, shipping, packing, and
delivery services to Puerto Vallarta hotels are available, and some also
ship to your home address.
Clothing
Here are some recommend clothing shops and boutiques:
 Vallarta’s only true department store is LANS, Juárez 867 (% 322-
226-9100), which also has a second location in the Hotel Zone in
front of the Gigante shopping center (% 322-226-0604). LANS offers
a wide selection of name-brand clothing, accessories, footwear, cos-
metics, and home furnishings.
 Laura López Labra Designs, Basilio Badillo 329-A (% 322-113-0102),
just may have the most comfortable clothing you’ve ever worn.
LLL is renowned for her trademark, all-white (or natural) designs in
100 percent cotton or lace. Laura’s fine gauze fabrics float through
her designs of seductive skirts, romantic dresses, blouses, beach-
wear, and baby dolls. Men’s offerings include cotton drawstring
pants and lightweight shirts. It’s open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m.
to 2 p.m. and 5 to 9 p.m.
 Mar de Sueños, Leona Vicario 220 (% 322-222-2662), is a small but
delectable shop that carries stunning swimsuits and exquisite 
lingerie. Without a doubt, this shop offers the finest women’s
beachwear, intimate apparel, and evening wear in Vallarta for
those special occasions — or just to make you feel extra special.
The shop also stocks a selection of fine linen clothing, and it’s one
of the few places in Mexico that carries the renowned Italian line,
La Perla. Other name brands include Gottex, Calvin Klein, and
DKNY. Open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Hip and sultry fashions, direct from South America, are the special-
ties of the de Santos Boutique, Morelos 771 (% 322-223-5326 or
223-3052; www.desantos.com.mx), found inside of the de Santos
restaurant and club. It’s open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and 6 to 10 p.m.
Contemporary art
With one of the stronger art communities in Latin America, Puerto
Vallarta has an impressive selection of fine galleries featuring quality,
original works of art. Several dozen galleries get together to offer art
walks almost every Wednesday between November and April. Here are
some that are worth a visit:
 Galería AL (Arte Latinoamericano), Josefa Ortiz Domínguez 155
(%/fax 322-222-4406; www.galeriaal.com), showcases contempo-
rary works created by young, primarily Latin-American artists, as
well as Vallarta favorite Marta Gilbert. It’s open Monday to Saturday
10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
268

 Galleria Dante, Basilio Badillo 269 (% 322-222-2477; www.galleria
dante.com), showcases contemporary sculptures and classical
reproductions of Italian, Greek, and Art Deco bronzes — all set
against a backdrop of gardens and fountains in a former private
villa. Located on the “calle de los cafés,” the gallery is open daily
during the winter 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Galería des Artistes, Leona Vicario 248 (% 322-223-0006), features
contemporary painters and sculptors from throughout Mexico,
including the renowned original “magiscopes” of Feliciano Bejar.
Paintings by Vallarta favorite Evelyn Boren, as well as a small selec-
tion of works by Mexican masters, including Diego Rivera and
Orozco, are also here, among the exposed brick walls and stylish
interior spaces. It’s open Monday to Saturday noon to 10 p.m.
 Since opening in 1987, Galería Pacífico, Aldama 174, second floor,
11⁄2 blocks inland from the fantasy sculptures on the malecón
(% 322-222-1982; www.galeriapacifico.com), has been consid-
ered one of Mexico’s finest galleries. The gallery has a wide selection
of sculptures and paintings by midrange masters and up-and-comers
on display. During high season, it’s open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m.
to 9 p.m. and Sundays by appointment.
 One of Vallarta’s first galleries, Galería Uno, Morelos 561 at Corona
(% 322-222-0908), features an excellent selection of contemporary
paintings by Latin American artists, plus a variety of posters and
prints. Set in a classic adobe building with an open courtyard, it’s
also a casual, salón-style gathering place for friends of owner Jan
Lavender. The gallery is open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 T. Fuller Gallery, Hidalgo 242 (% 322-222-8196), just steps away
from Our Lady of Guadalupe church, exhibits a small but stunning
collection of contemporary art, paintings, ceramics, and sculptures.
Hours are Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 6 to 9 p.m.
Crafts and gifts
Check out these choices for finding crafts and gifts:
 Opened in 1953, Alfarería Tlaquepaque, Av. México 1100 (% 322-
223-2121), is Vallarta’s original source for Mexican ceramics and
decorative crafts — all at excellent prices. Talavera pottery and
dishware, colored glassware, bird cages, baskets, and wood furniture
are just a few of the many items you can find in this warehouse-
style store. The hours are Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 I am enchanted by La Casa del Feng Shui’s (% 322-222-3300)
selection of crystals, candles, talismans, fountains, and wind
chimes — along with many more items designed to keep the good
energy flowing in your home, office, or personal space. Why not
take home something to add more harmony to your life? Open
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 269

Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. It’s located at Corona
165, around the corner from Morelos street. 
 Flickering candles glowing from colored-glass holders welcome you
into Safari Accents, Olas Altas 224, Local 4 (% 322-223-2660), a
highly original shop overflowing with creative gifts, one-of-a-kind
furnishings, and reproductions of paintings by Frida Kahlo and
Botero. It’s open 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.
Decorative and folk art
Find some one-of-a-kind pieces at these unique shops:
 The Banderas Bay Trading Company, Lázaro Cárdenas 263, near
Ignacio L. Vallarta (% 322-223-4352), has fine antiques and dec-
orative objects for the home, including unique and contemporary
furniture, antique wooden doors, religious-themed items, retablos
(painted scenes on tin backgrounds depicting the granting of a mir-
acle), original art, beeswax candles in grand sizes, hand-loomed
textiles, plus glassware and pewter. Items are hand-picked by one
of the most noteworthy interior designers in the area, Peter Bowman.
Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Lucy’s CuCu Cabaña and Zoo, Basilio Badillo 295 (no phone), has
one of the most entertaining, eclectic, and memorable collections
of Mexican folk art — about 70 percent of which is animal-themed.
Each summer they travel Mexico and personally select the hand-
made works created by over 100 indigenous artists and artisans.
Items include metal sculptures, Oaxacan wooden animals, retablos,
and fine Talavera ceramics. The shop is open Monday to Saturday
10 a.m. to 10 p.m., but it’s closed May 15 to October 15.
 Puerco Azul, Constitucion 325, just off Basilio Badillo (% 322-222-
8647), offers a whimsical and eclectic selection of art and home
accessories, much of it created by owner and artist Lee Chapman
(a.k.a. Lencho). You can find many animal-themed works in bright
colors, including his signature “blue pigs” (puercos azules).
It’s open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Querubines, Juárez 501 A, at Galeana (% 322-223-1727), is my per-
sonal favorite for the finest-quality artisan works from throughout
Mexico, including exceptional artistic silver jewelry, embroidered
and hand-woven clothing, bolts of loomed fabrics, tin mirrors and
lamps, glassware, pewter frames and trays, high-quality wool rugs,
straw bags, and Panama hats. It’s open Monday to Sunday 10 a.m.
to 9 p.m.
Jewelry and accessories
You can find jewelry and other accessories at the following:
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
270

 Mosaïqe, Basilio Badillo 277 (% 322-223-3146), is a potpourri of
global treasures. The shop features an extensive selection of silk,
cotton, and cashmere pareos and shawls, plus resort bags, jewelry,
and home decor items. It’s open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. There’s a
second location at Juárez 279 (% 322-223-3183). This one is open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 At Viva, Basilio Badillo 274 (% 322-222-4078; www.vivacollection.
com), both the shop and jewelry are stunning. You enter through
a long corridor lined with displays showcasing exquisite jewelry
from 450 international designers. The main room has a large, glass,
pyramid-shaped skylight as its roof, and more memorable jewelry
displays surround comfy couches. Viva also features the largest
selection of authentic French espadrilles and ballet slippers in
Latin America, plus a great selection of sunglasses and hats. It’s
open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Tequila and cigars
Looking for quality tequila and cigars? Check out these shops:
 La Casa del Habano, Aldama 174 (% 322-223-2758), is a fine
tobacco shop with certified-quality cigars from Cuba, along with
humidors, cutters, elegant lighters, and other smoking accessories.
It’s open Monday to Saturday noon to 9 p.m.
 At La Casa del Tequila, Morelos 589 (% 322-222-2000), you can
find an extensive selection of premium tequilas, plus information
and tastings to help guide you to an informed selection. The shop
has recently been downsized to accommodate the Agave Grill
(see Chapter 18) in the back, but now you can enjoy tasty Mexican
fare and margaritas while you shop! Business hours are Monday to
Saturday from noon to 11 p.m.
Embarking on a Side Trip
Anyone for a shot of tequila? I’m talking about taking a picture of the
town — although you can also sample the beverage of the same name
on this side trip. Vallarta Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S., or
322-297-1212; www.vallarta-adventures.com) offers a half-day trip
(300km/186 miles) that takes you to the classic town of Tequila, where
you visit one of the original haciendas and tequila fields. It’s just a com-
fortable 35-minute flight aboard a private, 16-passenger plane to the
town of Tequila. This is the only region in the world where this leg-
endary spirit is distilled, much like the exclusive Champagne region
in France. The visit centers around Herradura Tequila’s impressive 
18th-century Hacienda San José where you find out about the myth
and the tradition of producing tequila from the stately plants that line
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 271

this town’s hillsides — an experience comparable to California’s winery
tours. The tour departs every Thursday at 1 p.m. from the Aerotron pri-
vate airport (adjacent to the PV International Airport) and returns to
Puerto Vallarta by 8 p.m. The cost is $255, which includes all air and
ground transportation, tours, lunch, and beverages.
For other day trip options around Vallarta, worthy choices include San
Sebastián, Mascota, Talpa, and Yelapa.
Mining historic San Sebastián
If you haven’t heard about San Sebastián, it probably won’t be long until
you do — its remote location (about 160km/100 miles from Vallarta) and
historic appeal have made it the media’s new darling destination in
Mexico. Originally discovered in the late 1500s and settled in 1603, the
town peaked as a center of mining operations, swelling to a population
of more than 30,000, by the mid-1800s. Today, with roughly 600 year-round
residents, San Sebastián retains all the charm of a village locked in time.
Highlights include an old church, a coffee plantation, an underground
tunnel system — and not a T-shirt shop to be found.
Vallarta Adventure’s Colonial Treasures Air Expedition (% 866-256-2739
from the U.S., or 322-297-1212; www.vallarta-adventures.com) is a
great introduction to this town. A 15-minute flight aboard a 13-seat, turbo-
prop Cessna Caravan takes you into the heart of the Sierra Madre before
settling in San Sebastián. The plane is equipped with raised wings, which
allows you to admire — and photograph — the mountain scenery below.
The plane arrives on a gravel landing strip in San Sebastián for a half-day
tour — it’s more like an informal stroll through town and a chance to
talk with the more colorful personalities of the area — and each day is
different. The package costs $145 and includes the flight, a walking tour
of the town (including a stop at the old Hacienda Jalisco, an inn located
in a historic building, once used as the headquarters of a silver mining
company — a favored getaway of John Huston, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard
Burton, and their friends), and brunch in town. For those who prefer to
travel by land, they offer another option by bus, at a cost of $75.
This innovative tour company also offers a similar — yet different — air
tour to the mountain villages of Mascota and Talpa de Allende, where
you find out about the religious significance of these traditional towns.
In Mascota, stroll the cobblestone streets lined with adobe houses and
colonial haciendas, stopping at the majestic town church, dedicated to
the Virgin de los Dolores (Virgin of Sorrows), which was completed in
1880 and took more than 100 years to construct. You stop for lunch and
tour a local raicilla distillery to sample this locally popular beverage
before traveling on to Talpa. Talpa is known for being home to one of
Mexico’s most revered icons, the Virgin Rosario de Talpa, believed to
grant miracles with her healing powers. Ask for one yourself as you visit
the Gothic church that bears her name, or simply wander around this
pastoral village, set in a valley that is surrounded by pine-covered moun-
tains. The six-hour adventure includes airfare and lunch, for $140 per
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
272

person. Departures are Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 10:30 a.m.,
from Aerotron (next to Puerto Vallarta’s airport).
Pacific Travel (% 322-225-2270) offers a Jeep tour to San Sebastián for
$75 (up to four people per Jeep including a guide). You can choose to
drive along steep, narrow, rocky mountain roads or leave that part of the
adventure to your guide. This tour departs at 9 a.m. and returns at 5 p.m.
If you want to stay overnight, you have two options. The first is the very
basic El Pabellon de San Sebastián (%/fax 322-297-0200), which has
nine rooms facing the town square. Don’t expect extras here, but the
rates run $40 per double or $13 for singles. Reservations are handled
through the town’s central phone lines — you call and leave a message
or send a fax, and hopefully, the hotel receives it. Except on holidays,
there’s generally room at this inn, but bring cash — credit cards aren’t
accepted.
A more enjoyable option is the stately Hacienda Jalisco (% 322-297-2855
or 222-9638), built in 1850 and once the center of mining operations in
this old mining town. Located near the airstrip (a 15-min. walk from
town), the beautifully landscaped, rambling hacienda has walls that
seem to whisper tales of its past. But if proprietor Bud Acord is feeling
social, his stories usually outshine any the hacienda has to tell. He’s wel-
comed John Huston, Liz Taylor, Richard Burton, Peter O’Toole, and a
cast of local characters as his guests. The extra-clean rooms have wood
floors, rustic furnishings and antiques, and working fireplaces; some are
decorated with pre-Columbian reproductions. The ample bathrooms are
beautifully tiled and have skylights. Hammocks grace the upstairs ter-
race. A sort-of museum on the lower level attests to the celebrity guests
and prior importance the hacienda has enjoyed over the years. Because
of its remote location, all meals are included. Rates are $80 per person
per night including breakfast and dinner; alcoholic beverages are extra.
Group rates are available and discounts may be possible for longer
stays. No credit cards are accepted.
Relaxing in Yelapa
Yelapa, the same south-shore beach I discuss earlier in this chapter, is
also a great overnight escape. It’s a cove straight out of a tropical fan-
tasy and only a 45-minute trip by boat from Puerto Vallarta. Yelapa has
no cars, has one lone paved (pedestrian-only) road, and got electricity
only in the past four years. (The cove remains accessible only by boat.)
Yelapa’s tranquillity, natural beauty, and seclusion make it a popular home
for hippies, hipsters, artists, writers, and a few expatriates (looking to
escape the stress of the rest of the world or, perhaps, the law). Yes, it’s a
seemingly strange cast of characters, but you’re unlikely to ever meet a
stranger here — Yelapa remains casual and friendly.
To get to Yelapa, take an excursion boat or an inexpensive water taxi.
You can spend an enjoyable day in this wonderful spot, but I recommend a
longer stay — it provides a completely different perspective of the place.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 273

When you’re in Yelapa, you can lie in the sun, swim, and snorkel; eat
fresh, grilled seafood at a beachfront restaurant; or sample the local
moonshine, raicilla. The beach vendors specialize in the most amazing
pies I’ve ever tasted (coconut, lemon, or chocolate), and the way pie
ladies walk the beach while balancing the pie plates on their heads is
equally amazing. Vendors sell crocheted swimsuits too. You can also
tour this tiny town or hike up a river to see one of two waterfalls. The
waterfall closest to town is about a 30-minute walk from the beach.
If you use a local guide for a tour or a hike, agree on a price before you
start out. Horseback riding, guided bird-watching excursions, fishing
trips, and paragliding are also available.
For overnight accommodations, local residents frequently rent out rooms,
or you can check out the rustic Hotel Lagunita (% 322-209-5055 or
209-5056; www.hotel-lagunita.com). With 32 cabañas (all with private
bathroom), a saltwater pool, massage services, and an amiable restaurant/
bar, this is the most accommodating place for most visitors — although
you may need to bring your own towel because they’re known to be in
short supply. Also, note that the hotel only has a few hours of power
daily. Rates generally run $75 to $110 per night, but they vary depending
on the cabaña and the time of year. Hotel Lagunita accepts American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa with a 10 percent surcharge. This location
has become quite popular for yoga students and other groups.
My preferred place to stay is Verana (% 800-677-7176 or 310-360-0155 in
the U.S., or 322-222-2360; www.verana.com). It’s a magical six-villa
inn located on the mountaintop of the western edge of Yelapa Cove.
For details about Verana, check out my review in Chapter 16.
If you stay over on a Wednesday or Saturday night during winter months,
don’t miss the regular dance at the Yelapa Yacht Club (no phone).
Typically tongue-in-cheek for Yelapa, the “yacht club” consists of a cement
dance floor and a disco ball, but the DJ spins a great range of tunes rang-
ing from Glenn Miller to Black Eyed Peas, attracting all ages and types of
musical aficionados to the dance. Dinner is a bonus — the food may be
the best anywhere in the bay. The menu changes depending on what’s
fresh. Ask for directions; it’s located in the main village on the beach.
Discovering Puerto Vallarta after Dark
Puerto Vallarta’s spirited nightlife reflects the town’s dual nature: part
resort, part colonial Mexican town. In the past few years, Vallarta’s
nightlife has seen an expansion of live music, especially in clubs along
Calle Ignacio L. Vallarta (the extension of the main southbound road)
after it crosses the Río Cuale. A live blues club, a sports bar, live mariachi
music, a gay dance club, a steamy-hot live salsa dance club, and the
obligatory Señor Frog’s are along one 3-block stretch of the road. Walk
from place to place and take in a bit of it all!
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
274

The malecón, which used to be lined with restaurants, is now known
more for its selection of dance clubs and a few more-relaxed club
options, all of which look out over the ocean. You can walk along the
broad walkway by the water’s edge and check out the action at the vari-
ous clubs, which extend from the Cuban-themed La Bodeguita del
Medio on the north end to Hooters just off the central plaza.
Marina Vallarta has its own array of clubs with a more upscale, indoor,
and air-conditioned atmosphere. South of the Río Cuale, the Olas Altas
zone literally buzzes with action pouring out of its wide selection of
small cafes and martini bars. In this zone, there’s also an active gay and
lesbian club scene.
Taking in a cultural event
As in most Mexican beach resorts, Vallarta has a limited selection of cul-
tural nightlife beyond the Mexican fiesta, but as a growing center for the
visual arts in Mexico, Vallarta is more diverse than most. Popular events
include the winter season of art-exhibition openings. Puerto Vallarta’s
gallery community comes together to present almost weekly art walks
where new exhibits are presented, featured artists are in attendance,
and complimentary cocktails are served. These social events alternate
between the galleries along the Marina Vallarta malecón and the galleries
in the central downtown area. Check listings in the daily English-language
newspaper, Vallarta Today, upon arrival to see what may be on the sched-
ule during your stay.
Celebrating a fiesta
Major hotels in Puerto Vallarta feature frequent fiestas for tourists — an
open-bar, a Mexican buffet dinner, and live-entertainment extravaganzas.
Some fiestas are fairly authentic and are good introductions for first-time
travelers to Mexico; others can be a bit cheesy. Shows are usually held
outdoors but move indoors when necessary.
 The NH Krystal Puerto Vallarta (% 322-224-0202; kvallarta@
krystal.com) hosts one of the best fiestas on Tuesdays at 7 p.m.
These things are difficult to quantify, but Krystal’s program is prob-
ably less tacky than most of its hotel counterparts. The charge is
$65, and major credit cards are accepted.
 My personal favorite of the nocturnal fiestas is Rhythms of the
Night, which combines a sunset boat cruise to the cove of Caletas
with an evening of dining and entertainment under the stars at
John Huston’s former home. The smooth, fast Vallarta Adventure
catamaran takes you to the site, providing entertainment along the
way until you’re greeted at the dock by tiki torches and native
drummers. There’s no electricity here — you dine by the light
of the multitude of candles, the stars, and the moon. The buffet
dinner is delicious — steak, seafood, and generous vegetarian
options, accompanied by wine. Everything is first class. The show,
set to the music of native bamboo flutes and guitars, showcases
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 275

indigenous dances in a contemporary style. The boat departs from
the Terminal Marítima at 6 p.m. and returns by 11 p.m. To reserve a
spot, contact Vallarta Adventures (% 866-256-2739 from the U.S.,
or 322-297-1212; www.vallarta-adventures.com). The cost is $75
and includes the boat cruise, dinner, open bar, and entertainment.
Major credit cards are accepted.
Enjoying the club and music scene
You can actually find some of Vallarta’s best bets for nightlife in popular
restaurants — combining food and fun. Other options are one of the
many clubs featuring live music. Whatever your final selection is, one
thing is for sure — Vallarta offers something for everyone, and there’s
rarely a quiet night in town.
Restaurants/bars
The sleek Bianco, Insurgentes 109, Col. Emiliano Zapata (% 322-222-2748),
is a popular choice for more sophisticated nightlife, with its long, glass-
top bar and cozy seating areas where conversation is possible. This is
the spot for anyone older than 30 who wants to enjoy an evening out, lis-
tening to contemporary music. The air-conditioned lounge also features
occasional live music, notably salsa on Thursday and Saturday nights.
You can’t miss the dramatic entrance. Open daily from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m. 
Vallarta’s original nightspot is Carlos O’Brian’s, Paseo Díaz Ordaz 786,
along the malecón at Pípila (% 322-222-1444 or 222-4065), once consid-
ered the only place you’d think of going for an evening of revelry. Although
the competition is stiffer nowadays, COB’s still packs them in — especially
the 20-something set. Late at night, the scene resembles a college party.
It’s open daily noon to 2 a.m.
The newest and most sophisticated lounge in Vallarta is the Constantini
Bar Lounge, set in the elegant eatery, Cafe des Artistes, Guadalupe
Sanchez 740 (% 322-222-3228 or 222-3229; www.cafedesartistes.
com). Opened in late 2003, it’s become a popular option for those looking
for a lively yet sophisticated option for after-dinner drinks. The plush
sofas are welcoming, and the list of champagnes by the glass, signature
martinis, and specialty drinks are suitably tempting. Live jazz and blues
in an intimate atmosphere are drawing crowds. An ample appetizer and
dessert menu make it appropriate for a late-night dining-and-drinks
option. Open from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Kit Kat Club, Pulpito 120, Playas Los Muertos (% 322-223-0093), is
swank, sleek, and reminiscent of a New York, high-style club, but don’t be
fooled — the club also has a terrific sense of humor. In the golden glow
of candlelight, you can lounge around in cushy, leopard-patterned chairs
or cream-colored, overstuffed chaise lounges listening to swinging tunes
while sipping on a martini. The place isn’t only hip, but it also serves
good food, with especially tasty appetizers that can double as light
meals and scrumptious desserts. Michael, the owner, describes his
lounge and cafe as cool, crazy, wild, jazzy, and sexy. I agree. Often, in
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
276

high season, a cross-dressing songstress performs a cabaret-style floor
show. The club is open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.
La Bodeguita del Medio, Paseo Díaz Ordaz/malecón, at Allende (% 322-
223-1585), is an authentic Cuban restaurant known for its casual energy,
terrific live music, and mojitos — stiff rum-based drinks with fresh mint
and lime juice. It’s a branch of the original Bodeguita in Havana (reput-
edly Hemingway’s favorite restaurant there), which opened in 1942. If
you can’t get to that one, the Vallarta version has successfully imported
the essence — and it has a small souvenir shop that sells Cuban cigars,
rum, and other items. The downstairs has large wooden windows that
open to the malecón street action, while the upstairs offers terrific views
of the bay. Walls throughout are decorated with old photographs and
patrons’ signatures — if you can, find a spot and add yours! The food is
less memorable here than the music and atmosphere, so I suggest drinks
and dancing, nothing more. It’s open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m.
A Mexican classic gone contemporary is Mi Querencia, Morelos 709
(% 322-222-7701). Cantinas are a centuries-old tradition in Mexico, and
this one retains the fundamentals while updating the concept to a hip club.
Cantinas serve little complimentary plates of food as your table continues
to order drinks. The grub is served here from 1 to 5 p.m. and may include
carne con chile (meat in a chile sauce), soup of the day, or quesadillas.
In the evenings, enjoy a romantic, clubby atmosphere with recorded music
alternating between sultry boleros and the hottest in Mexican rock at
levels that still permit conversation. If you require more stimulation, board
games are available to play in one of the brightly colored, smaller rooms or
on the larger open-air patio. Mi Querencia is open Sunday to Wednesday
noon to 2 a.m. and Thursday to Saturday noon to 4 a.m. No credit cards. 
Live music
Currently the most popular live-music club in Vallarta, Route 66, Ignacio
L. Vallarta 217 (no phone), features a hot house band that plays a mix of
reggae, blues, and rock. Live music jams nightly from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.
Route 66 is located south of the river between Madero and Cárdenas,
and it’s open nightly 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. There’s no cover.
El Faro Lighthouse Bar (% 322-221-0541 or -0542) is a circular cocktail
lounge at the top of the Marina Vallarta lighthouse and is one of Vallarta’s
most romantic nightspots. Live or recorded jazz plays, and conversation
is manageable. Drop by at twilight for the magnificent panoramic views.
Open daily 5:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. with no cover.
Mariachi Loco, Lázaro Cárdenas 254, at Ignacio Vallarta (% 322-223-2205),
is a live and lively mariachi club that also features singers belting out
boleros and ranchero classics. The mariachi show begins at 10 p.m. —
the mariachis stroll and play as guests join in impromptu singing — and
by 10 p.m., things really get going. After midnight, the mariachis play for
pay, which is around $10 for each song. The kitchen serves Mexican food
until 1 a.m. The club itself is open daily 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 277

Dance clubs and discos
A few of Vallarta’s clubs or discos charge admission, but generally you
just pay for drinks — $4 for a margarita, $3 for a beer, and more for
whiskey and mixed drinks. Keep an eye out for the discount passes fre-
quently available in hotels, restaurants, and other tourist spots. Most
clubs are open daily 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.:
 Collage Club, Calle Proa s/n, Marina Vallarta (% 322-221-0505), is
a multilevel monster of nighttime entertainment that features a pool
hall, video arcade, bowling alley, and an always-packed disco bar
(with frequent live entertainment). Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 a.m., the
club is easily visible from the main highway, just past the entrance
to Marina Vallarta, and it’s very popular with a young and mainly
local crowd. Cover charge is $4.
 Christine (% 322-224-0202) is a dazzling club that still draws a
crowd with an opening laser-light show, pumped-in dry ice and
oxygen, flashing lights, and a dozen large-screen video panels.
Once a disco — in the true sense of the word — Christine received
a face-lift in 2003, and is now a more modern dance club, with techno,
house, and hip-hop the primary tunes played. The sound system is
truly amazing, and the mix of music can get almost anyone dancing.
This spot is open nightly 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.; the light show begins at
11 p.m. No shorts (for men), tennis shoes, or flip-flops are permit-
ted. It’s part of the NH Krystal Puerto Vallarta, north of downtown,
and is very visible off Avenida Francisco Medina Ascencio. Cover
varies from free to $20, depending on the night, and major credit
cards are accepted.
 de Santos, Morelos 771 (% 322-223-3052 or 223-3053; www.
desantos.com.mx), may be among Vallarta’s chicest dining spots,
but it is really known more for the urban, hip crowd its bar and adja-
cent club draws. Opened in 2003, this stunning state-of-the-art club
quickly became the place for the super-chic to party. The lower
level holds an air-conditioned bar and dance floor, where a DJ spins
the hottest house and techno. Upstairs, an open-air rooftop bar has
chill-out music and acid jazz. Enjoy the tunes and the fresh air while
lounging around on one of the several oversize beds. One partner, a
member of the super-hot Latin rock group Maná, uses Vallarta as a
home base for writing new songs. The restaurant bar is open daily
from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.; the club is open Wednesday through Saturday
from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. On special event nights, there may be a cover
charge, but generally admission is free.
 You’ll recognize Hilo, Malecón, between Aldama and Abasolo
(% 322-223-5361), by the giant-sized sculptures that practically
reach out the front entrance and pull you into this high-energy club,
which has become a favorite with the 20-something set. Music ranges
from house and electronic to rock. It seems the later the hour, the
more crowed the place becomes. Open daily from 4 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Cover charge is $7, weekends and holidays. 
Part V: Puerto Vallarta and the Central Pacific Coast 
278

 The J&B Salsa Club, Av. Francisco Medina Ascencio Km 2.5, in the
Hotel Zone (% 322-224-4616), is the locally popular place to go for
dancing to Latin music — from salsa to samba, the dancing here is
hot! The club features live bands on Fridays, Saturdays, and holi-
days. It’s open from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. with a $10 cover.
 Nikki Beach, on the beach at the Westin Regina Resort (% 322-22-
0252 or 226-1150; www.nikkibeach.com), is a haven for the hip,
which hails from South Beach, Miami, and St. Tropez, bringing its
ultracool vibe to Vallarta. White-draped bed-size lounges scatter
the outdoor lounge area, under a canopy of tall palms and umbrel-
las. Indoor dining and lounge areas are also available. The music
is the latest in electronic, house, and chill, with visiting DJs often
playing on weekend nights. Sundays feature their signature beach
brunch, and Thursday evenings feature “Beautiful People” night.
It’s a great choice for catching rays during the day while sipping
tropical drinks, but its real appeal is the nocturnal action. Open
Sunday to Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. (food service stops
at 11 p.m.); Thursday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. (food 
service stops at 1 a.m.). 
 At The Palm Video & Show Bar, Olas Altas 508 (% 322-223-4818),
the big screen above the dance floor plays the most danceable
videos in town. At this colorful, lively, and air-conditioned club, the
pool table is regularly in play, and you frequently find you’re in for a
night of great entertainment, as the club regularly books live shows
featuring female impersonators. This is a gay-friendly but not exclu-
sively gay club, with a spirited, festive atmosphere. Open daily
from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., a cover charge of about $5 applies on show
nights only.
 The sheer size of Señor Frog’s, Ignacio L. Vallarta and Venustiano
Carranza (% 322-222-5171 or 222-5177), an outpost of the famed
Carlos ’n Charlie’s chain, may be daunting, but it still fills up with
partiers and rocks until the early morning hours. Those cute waiters
remain a signature of the chain, and one never knows when they’ll
assemble on stage and call on a bevy of beauties to join them in a
tequila-drinking contest. Occasionally, live bands appear. Although
mainly popular with the 20s set, all ages find it fun. There’s food
service, but the place is better known for its dance-club atmos-
phere. It’s open from noon to 4 a.m., with a cover charge of $11.
 A visit to the Zoo, Paseo Díaz Ordaz 630, the malecón (% 322-222-
4945; www.zoobardance.com), gives you a chance to be an animal
and get wild in the night — this joint even has cages to dance in if
you’re feeling really unleashed. The Zoo has a terrific sound system
and a great variety of dance music including techno, reggae, and rap.
Every hour is a happy hour here with two-for-one drinks. The club
is open 11:30 a.m. until the wee hours of the morn, and cover usu-
ally ranges from free to $11.
Chapter 19: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Puerto Vallarta 279

Sports bar
With enough TVs and sports memorabilia to start a mini-museum, Micky’s
No Name Café, Morelos 460 at Mina, the malecón (% 322-223-2508;
www.nonamecafe.net), is a great venue for catching your favorite game,
including NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLB games, as well as pay-per-view sport-
ing events. Mickey’s also serves great BBQ ribs and imported steaks
from the United States. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to midnight.
Gay and lesbian clubs
Vallarta has a vibrant gay community and a wide variety of clubs and
nightlife options including special bay cruises and evening excursions
to nearby ranches. The free Gay Guide Vallarta (no phone; www.
gayguidevallarta.com) specializes in gay-friendly listings.
 Club Paco Paco, Ignacio L. Vallarta 278 (% 322-222-7667; www.
clubpacopaco.com), is a combination disco, cantina, and rooftop
bar that also hosts a spectacular “Trasvesty” drag show every
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night at 1:30 a.m. The club is open
noon to 6 a.m. daily and is air-conditioned. The Ranch Disco Bar,
around the corner at Venustiano Carranza 239, has nightly specials
including Western Night on Tuesdays and Leather Night on
Thursdays. A nightly “Ranch Hand’s Show” is performed at 1 a.m.
and 3 a.m. This club, which can be accessed from Club Paco Paco,
is open 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. The cover of $6 applies to both clubs and
includes a drink.
 Garbo’s, Pulpito 142 (% 322-229-7309; www.bargarbo.com), is a
small, cozy club that is gay friendly, but not exclusively gay. It fea-
tures great recorded music and occasional live music on weekends.
It’s open daily from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. and is air-conditioned. 
 Los Balcones, Juárez 182 (% 322-222-4671), one of the original gay
clubs in town, is a bi-level space with several dance floors and an
excellent sound system. It earned a few chuckles when it was listed
as one of the most romantic spots in Vallarta by Bride’s magazine.
This air-conditioned club is open 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. and posts nightly
specials including exotic male dancers.

Part VI
Ixtapa and
Zihuatanejo

In this part . . . 
T
hink of a vacation here as getting two destinations (and
the best of both worlds) for the price of one: The side-by-
side beach resorts of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo may share a
common geography, but they couldn’t be more different in
character. Ixtapa has a modern infrastructure, tons of services,
and luxury hotels. Zihuatanejo — or Zihua to the locals — is
the quintessential Mexican beach village with one-of-a-kind
accommodations.
The only thing that some visitors may ﬁnd lacking is the
nightlife, which is rather subdued in both towns — especially
compared to other more developed resorts such as Acapulco,
Los Cabos, and Puerto Vallarta. But, if you’re looking for laid-
back evenings of good conversation and cocktails in the
moonlight, the absent party crowd may be a plus.

T
hink of a vacation to this slice of Mexico as cashing in a two-for-one
coupon and getting the best of both worlds: The side-by-side beach
resorts of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo may share a common geography, but
they couldn’t be more different in character. Ixtapa boasts a modern
infrastructure, a wide array of services, and luxury hotels. Zihuatanejo —
or Zihua to the locals — is the quintessential Mexican beach village and
offers lower-priced rooms and one-of-a-kind inns. If you’re the type of
traveler who prefers comforts reminiscent of home, opt for Ixtapa and
take advantage of well-appointed rooms in a setting of tropical beauty.
You can easily and quickly make the 6km (4-mile) trip into Zihuatanejo
for a sampling of life in this pueblo by the sea. But, if you prefer a more
rustic retreat with real personality, consider settling in Zihuatanejo. Its
funky charm has attracted a community of Swiss and Italian immigrants,
adding an air of sophistication to the laid-back village life.
With a backdrop of palm-covered hills and the Pacific Ocean waters
serving as a foreground, you can enjoy a full range of activities and
diversions here — scuba diving, deep-sea fishing, bay cruises to remote
beaches, and golf are among the favorites. The one exception is the
nightlife, which is rather subdued in both towns, especially compared to
other more-developed resorts such as Acapulco, Los Cabos, and Puerto
Vallarta.

As a dual destination, Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo are the ideal choice for the
traveler looking for a little bit of everything, from resort-style indulgence
to unpretentious good times. Zihua is a relaxed, down-to-earth paradise,
and it’s also known for its collection of unique hillside boutique hotels,
which cater to an international crowd looking for pampered luxury and
individualized style. Terrific bargains also exist and still offer character,
cleanliness, and safety — if not the full range of amenities. Of all the
resorts in Mexico, the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo region has the best selection
of one-of-a-kind places to stay.
These two resort towns are more welcoming to couples and adults
than they are to families. A number of places are off-limits to children
under 16 — something of a rarity in Mexico.
Choosing Your Location
Because the ambience is so different between these two sister towns,
choosing the right place to stay makes a big difference in your overall
vacation experience — though the ride between the two is an easy one.
Ixtapa, as I note earlier in the chapter, is the more modern, made-for-
tourism town. Developed by the Mexican government in the 1970s as a
complement to Zihua’s fetching charms, Ixtapa places a bevy of conven-
iences at your disposal: shopping centers, sleek eateries, golf courses,
and high-rise hotels. Almost everything is accessible by foot or is an
inexpensive cab ride away.
Each of the Ixtapa hotels listed in this chapter (with the exception of
Las Brisas) lies along the wide, attractive Playa el Palmar and is largely
self-contained — with shops, bars, restaurants, and water fun on-site —
meaning you never need to leave the resort’s property if you don’t want
to. The main difference between Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo is that while
Ixtapa hotels offer every conceivable comfort and convenience, they
lack the charm and originality of Zihua accommodations. Also you need
to remember that Ixtapa hotels, on the whole, are priced much higher.
If you choose the traditional appeal of Zihuatanejo, you still need to
narrow down your preference in terms of staying in the central town or
on one of Zihua’s neighboring beaches. In either case, Zihua is small,
friendly, colorful, and full of Mexico’s authentic charms.
The places to stay in town — known as el centro — are generally
small and inexpensive with the exception of Villa Vera Puerto Mio
(which isn’t technically located downtown anyway, so forget about the
whole “exception” thing). Many establishments offer bare-bones accom-
modations without air-conditioning and are subject to local street noise,
but they’re clean, priced right, and within easy walking distance of
plenty of places to eat and shop. Note that none of the centro Zihua
hotels are situated directly on the beach, and only Puerto Mio has an
ocean view.
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 
284

Also worth knowing is that the term “bungalow” is loosely defined in
Zihuatanejo, just as it is elsewhere in Mexico. Thus, a bungalow may be
an individual unit with a kitchen and bedroom, or it may be a mere bed-
room. It may also be like a hotel, located in a two-story building with
multiple units with or without kitchens. The bungalow may be cozy or
rustic, with or without a patio or balcony.
Two lovely beaches and a couple of Mexico’s most notable small hotels
are just east of centro Zihuatanejo. Playa Madera and Playa La Ropa,
separated from each other by only a craggy shoreline, are both accessi-
ble by road. Prices here tend to be higher than those in town, but the
value is much better, and people tend to find that the beautiful and tran-
quil setting is worth the extra cost. The area is rich with charm and a
stellar selection of sand for anyone who truly treasures a great beach.
The only drawback to this area is that dining is limited to palapa (thatched
roof) beach restaurants or the on-site restaurants at the hotels, and there’s
essentially no shopping or nightlife to speak of, which means you have
to hop in a taxi and go to town for any diversions other than beach-
related fun and limited dining. The town is just 5 to 20 minutes away
depending on whether you walk or take a taxi, which costs about $2.
Ixtapa’s and Zihuatanejo’s 
Best Accommodations
As far as prices go, I note rack rates (the maximum that a hotel or resort
charges for a room) for two people spending one night in a double room.
You can usually do better, especially if you’re purchasing a package that
includes airfare. Expect to pay more — up to double the rack-rate prices —
if you’re planning a visit during Christmas or Easter weeks. Prices quoted
here include the 17 percent room tax. Please refer to the Introduction of
this book for an explanation of the price categories.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo tend to not
be very kid friendly, so if you plan on bringing the whole family, includ-
ing the little ones, please pay special attention to the Kid Friendly icons
highlighting the best choices. Unless otherwise indicated, all hotels have
air-conditioning.
Apartamentos Amueblados Valle
$–$$
Zihuatanejo Centro
These accommodations are actually apartments, but you can rent them
by the day or week, meaning you can enjoy a well-furnished apartment for
the price of an inexpensive hotel room. This property is a great choice for
friends traveling together on a budget. Five one-bedroom apartments
accommodate up to three people; the three two-bedroom apartments can fit
four comfortably. Request an apartment that doesn’t face the street; they’re
less noisy. Each apartment is different, but all are clean and airy with ceiling

fans, private balconies, and kitchenettes, but no air-conditioning. Maid
service is provided daily, and the office offers a paperback-book exchange.
Reserve well in advance during high season.

longed stays. No credit cards.
Barceló Ixtapa
$$$$
Ixtapa
A grand, 12-story resort hotel (formerly the Sheraton), Barceló Ixtapa is one
of the best choices in the area for families. A modern, well-equipped resort,
Barceló boasts handsomely furnished public areas and tropical gardens sur-
rounding a large pool, which has a swim-up bar and a separate section for
children. Most rooms have balconies with ocean or mountain views, and non-
smoking and handicapped-accessible rooms are available. You never need
to leave this hotel if you choose not to; the Barceló Ixtapa lacks nothing —
four restaurants plus room service, a nightclub, a lobby bar, and the area’s
most popular Mexican fiesta (held weekly) with a sumptuous buffet and
live entertainment outdoors. If you choose to spend all your time here, be
sure to take advantage of the optional, all-inclusive pricing rates. Four tennis
courts and a fitness room are available for the actively inclined. For all that
the Barceló offers on-site, it may be the best value in Ixtapa.

breakfast only; low season $225 double all-inclusive. AE, DC, MC, V.
Bungalows Ley
$$–$$$$
Zihuatanejo Beaches/Playa Madera
Located on a small complex on Playa Madera, Bungalows Ley is a great
option for friends traveling together. If you’re traveling with a group, you
may want to book the most expensive suite (called Club Madera), which
comes with a rooftop terrace, tiled hot tub, outdoor bar and grill, and a
spectacular view. No two suites are the same here, but all are immaculate;
the simplest layouts are studios with one bed and a kitchen in the same
room. All rooms have terraces or balconies just above the beach, and all
are decorated in the ice-cream colors reminiscent of Miami South Beach.
Bathrooms, however, tend to be small and dark. Clients praise the man-
agement and the service. To find the property, follow Calle Eva S. de López
Matéos to the right up a slight hill; the hotel is on the left.

Casa Cuitlateca
$$$$–$$$$$
Zihuatanejo Beaches/Playa La Ropa
The perfect place for a romantic holiday, Casa Cuitlateca is an exclusive
bed-and-breakfast and one of the unique inns that has made Playa La Ropa
a standout. Done in the architectural style that has made Zihua famous,
Casa Cuitlateca has palapa roofs and earthy colors and is built into the
hillside across from Playa La Ropa, just a short walk away. Three of the
four units offer a stunning view. Two smaller rooms have their own private
terrace and a small sitting area. There’s also a suite with a large terrace,
and a second suite with no view but a very nice sitting area and small pri-
vate garden. Each room is carefully decorated with handicrafts and tex-
tiles from all over Mexico. The bar is on the first level behind the pool and
serves cocktails to the public from 4:30 to 8 p.m. Guests can help them-
selves to soft drinks and beers on the honor system when the bar is
closed. The small pool, like everything else here, is beautifully designed.
On the top level of the two suites, all guests can enjoy a sun deck and a
hot tub. From the entrance to the property, you climb a steep staircase of
120 steps. The driveway is also very steep, with parking for six cars. The
parking lot connects to the house through a hanging bridge.

Hotel Raul 3 Marias
$
Zihuatanejo Centro
Although it’s a small, basic hotel with strictly functional rooms, the Raul
is very clean and known for its friendly guest services. Nine rooms have a
balcony overlooking the street, and the small office offers telephone and
fax service to guests. Downstairs is the landmark Zihuatanejo seafood
restaurant, Garrobos, which is open for lunch and dinner. The hotel also
offers deep-sea fishing and diving charters.

Hotel Susy
$
Zihuatanejo Centro
Consistently clean with tons of plants along a shaded walkway set back
from the street, this two-story hotel offers small rooms with fans (no air-
conditioning) and louvered-glass windows with screens. Hotel Susy is a
good choice if you’re looking for a central location, a cheap price, and a
comfortable, simple place to stay. Request an upper-floor room and enjoy
a balcony that overlooks the street. To get here, face away from the water
at the basketball court on the malecón (boardwalk), turn right, and walk
2 blocks; the hotel is on your left at the corner of Guerrero.

La Casa Que Canta
$$$$$
Zihuatanejo Beaches/Playa La Ropa
Another striking inn and another ideal choice for a romantic getaway is
“The House that Sings,” located on a mountainside overlooking Zihuatanejo
Bay. Designed with striking molded-adobe architecture, La Casa Que Canta
was the first of a rustic-chic style of architecture now known as Mexican
Pacific. All the rooms are individually decorated in unusual, painted,
Michoacán furniture; antiques; and stretched-leather equipales (a tradi-
tional Mexican chair characterized by its round-design and sturdy con-
struction), with hand-loomed fabrics and handsome, natural-tile floors
used throughout. All units have large, beautifully furnished terraces with
bay views. Hammocks under the thatched-roof terraces, supported by
rough-hewn vigas (wooden beams), are perfectly placed for watching
yachts sail in and out of the harbor. The four categories of rooms (terrace
suites, deluxe suites, grand suites, and private-pool suites) are all spa-
cious. Rooms meander up and down the hillside, and although no one
staircase is terribly long, you should know that Casa Que Canta doesn’t
have elevators. Technically, the hotel isn’t on Playa La Ropa (or any
beach), but on the road leading there. The closest stretch of beach (the
very beginning of Playa La Ropa) is down a steep hill. La Casa Que Canta
has a small restaurant-bar on a shaded terrace, a small pool on the main
terrace, and a second, saltwater pool on the bottom level. A new Well
Being Center has been added, offering massage, spa services, and yoga.
Little extras such as laundry, room service, and complimentary soft drinks
and beer in your minifridge are present to pamper you.

Las Brisas Resort
$$$$–$$$$$
Ixtapa
Set above the high-rise hotels of Ixtapa on its own rocky promontory, Las
Brisas (formerly the Westin Brisas) is clearly the most stunning of Ixtapa’s
hotels, and the hotel most noted for gracious service. The austere but lux-
urious public areas, all in stone and stucco, are bathed in sweeping
breezes and an air of exclusivity. A minimalist luxury also characterizes
the rooms, which have Mexican-tile floors and private, plant-decked patios
with hammocks and lounges. All rooms face the hotel’s cove and private
beach, Vista Hermosa. Although this beach is true to its name (the
breezes), it’s dangerous for swimming. The six master suites come with
private pools, the 16th floor is reserved for nonsmokers, and three rooms
on the 18th floor are equipped for travelers with disabilities. Like many of
Ixtapa’s hotels, Las Brisas is so complete that you may never feel the urge
to leave — choose from among five restaurants, room service, and three
Chapter 20: The Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo Hotel Scenes 289

bars including a lobby bar with live trio music at sunset. Three swimming
pools (including one for children) connected to one another by waterfalls,
lighted tennis courts (with a pro available on request), and a fitness center
with massage services round out the offerings.

NH Krystal Ixtapa
$$$–$$$$$
Ixtapa
Welcoming, exceptional service is what the Krystal chain of hotels is
known for in Mexico, and the Ixtapa version is no exception. In fact, many
of the staff members have been with the hotel for all its 20-some years of
operation and greet returning guests. The Krystal is probably the area’s
best hotel for families because it has a playground and a special kid’s club
activities program. Each spacious and nicely furnished room has a balcony
with an ocean view, game table, and tile bathroom. Master suites have
large, furnished, triangular-shaped balconies that overlook the spacious
grounds and the large pool, which has a special kid’s section as well as 
a waterfall and water slide. A tennis court, racquetball court, and a 
small gym are also on-site. Note that some rates include a daily breakfast
buffet — a great deal if you make the buffet your main meal of the day.
Krystal Ixtapa has five restaurants to choose from, including the evenings-
only Bogart’s, plus room service. Also important to note is that the center
of Ixtapa nightlife is found here, at Krystal’s famed Christine Disco.

Posada Citlali

Zihuatanejo Centro
A pleasant, three-story hotel, Posada Citlali is a major bargain. Although
the rooms are small, they’re spotless, and they border a very pleasant
plant-filled courtyard decked out with comfortable rockers and chairs.
Bottled water is in help-yourself containers on the patio, and fans are
found in all rooms (there’s no air-conditioning). Although you may hear
the children heading for the nearby school in the morning, the location
avoids most of the evening noise and traffic sounds, making Posada Citlali
a peaceful retreat in el centro. The stairway to the top two floors is narrow
and steep.

Sotavento Beach Resort
$–$$$
Zihuatanejo Beaches/Playa La Ropa
Perched on a hill above the beach, this resort is for people who want to
relax near the ocean in a simple, lovely setting without being bothered by
televisions or closed up in air-conditioned rooms. A throwback to the style
of the 1970s, when Zihua was first being discovered by an international jet
set, the Sotavento comprises two multi-story buildings. Quite a variety of
rooms are available to choose from — ask to see a few different rooms to
find something that suits you, such as the popular doubles on the resort’s
upper floors, which are about three times the size of a normal double room.
The furnishings in all the rooms are simple but comfortable, and all have
ocean-view terraces that are half-sheltered and half-open, with chaises for
basking in the sun and hammocks for enjoying the shade. Screened win-
dows filter the ocean breezes, and ceiling fans keep the rooms airy even
when the breeze is absent (remember — there’s no air-conditioning). One
curious feature of the Sotavento is that the floors are always slightly
slanted in one direction or another — by design of the owner. Two restau-
rants, a small lobby bar, a pool with whirlpool, and a rooftop yoga studio
serve guests. The resort is built into the side of a hill, and isn’t for people
who dislike climbing stairs. Take the highway south of Zihuatanejo about
2km (1 mile), turn right at the hotel’s sign, and follow the road.

Villa del Sol
$$$$$
Zihuatanejo Beaches/Playa La Ropa
Villa del Sol is an exquisite inn known as much for its unequivocal attention
to luxurious detail as for its exacting German owner, Helmut Leins, who is
almost always present to ensure the quality of his guests’ stay. Villa del Sol
is a haven of tranquillity that caters to guests looking for complete privacy
and serenity. Each room is a harmony of magnificent design. The spacious,
split-level suites have one or two bedrooms, plus a living area and a large
terrace, some of which have a private mini-pool. King-size beds are draped
in white netting, and comfy lounges and hammocks beckon to you at siesta
time. Standard rooms are smaller, and they don’t have TVs or telephones,
but they’re still artfully and individually appointed with artistic Mexican
details. Nine beachfront suites have recently been added, but I still prefer
the original rooms. No two are alike. Suites have CD players and private fax
machines, with satellite TVs or DVD players brought to you upon request.
No children under 12 are allowed during high season, and a “no children”
and “no excess noise” sentiment prevails in general. Travelers who relish
a more typically welcoming Mexican ambience may find a stay here less
enjoyable. The hotel sits on a private, 180m-long (600-ft.), palm-shaded

tennis courts, and a massage service. After you work up an appetite, enjoy
an outstanding gourmet meal at the open-air, beachfront restaurant-bar or
room service in your sumptuous surroundings. The rooms are stocked
with deluxe amenities, and the hotel offers every service expected at a
five-star resort.

Villas Miramar
$–$$$
Zihuatanejo Beaches/Playa Madera
A lovely hotel with beautiful gardens, Villas Miramar offers a welcoming
atmosphere, attention to detail, and superb cleanliness. For the price, you
may expect less, but the rooms are colorful and well equipped, and some
have kitchenettes. Several of the suites are built around a shady patio that
doubles as a restaurant, which serves a basic menu for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner. Suites across the street face a swimming pool and have pri-
vate balconies and sea views. A terrace with a view to Zihuatanejo Bay has
a bar that features a daily happy hour from 5 to 7 p.m. Of all the more
budget-priced accommodations around, Villas Miramar is the most wel-
coming to children. To find Villas Miramar, follow the road leading south
out of town toward Playa La Ropa, take the first right after the traffic circle,
and then hang a left on Adelita.

A nine-villa complex nestled on the mountainside above Playa La Ropa,
Villas San Sebastián offers great views of Zihuatanejo’s bay and an indulgent
sense of seclusion. The villas, all with beautiful ocean views, are surrounded
by tropical vegetation and border a central swimming-pool area. Each comes
complete with kitchenette and its own spacious, private terrace. The per-
sonalized service is one reason these villas come so highly recommended;
owner Luis Valle, whose family dates back decades in the community, is
always available to help guests with any questions or needs.

Villa Vera Puerto Mio
$$$$–$$$$$
Zihuatanejo Centro
This idyllic inn is located on 10 hectares (25 acres) of beautifully landscaped
grounds apart from the rest of the hotels in Zihuatanejo. Technically not
in el centro, Villa Vera Puerto Mio is on the farthest end of the bay, almost
directly across from Playa Las Gatas. All rooms are decorated with hand-
crafted details from around Mexico, and all enjoy beautiful views of either
Zihuatanejo’s bay or the Pacific Ocean. The rooms are divided into three
main areas: Casa de Mar, the cliff-side mansion closer to the main entrance
where most of the rooms are located; the Peninsula, located on the tip of
the bay; and a more secluded area with two deluxe suites. (These two
suites have no TVs to disturb the tranquillity.) Three other suites, located
between Casa de Mar and the Peninsula, have recently been added and
have private pools. The upper-level suite is the largest in size. One of the
hallmarks of Villa Vera Puerto Mio is its seclusion — the location sets the
hotel apart, and you can only reach the small private beach below by going
through the hotel. The hotel has two restaurants, plus a small marina with
a sailboat that’s available for charters. Children under 16 are welcome only
during the summer.

Chapter 21
Settling into Ixtapa and
Zihuatanejo
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect when you arrive
 Finding your way around
 Discovering helpful information and resources
O
ne of the pleasures of a vacation in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo is how
easy finding your way around really is. The airport is a breeze to
navigate, and the towns are just as simple to figure out; both are basi-
cally oriented around one main road each.
In this chapter, I cover the basics of getting around the towns, and I pro-
vide you with tips on everything from exchanging money to Internet
access. Truly, the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo area is a place for complete relax-
ation, and it almost seems like the towns have trivialized the everyday
details of life to make everything just a little bit easier.
Arriving in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
Your first impression at the Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo airport is likely to set
the tone for your trip here — arrivals are usually easy, uncomplicated,
and hassle-free. But the airport lacks any real source of tourist infor-
mation or currency exchange, so you’re on your own until you reach
town.
In recent years, the airport has been in a more-or-less constant state of
renovation, but it’s a generally simple building to navigate. When you
exit the plane, head down the portable stairway to the tarmac and walk
to the airport building.

The climate change is likely to be intense upon your arrival, especially if
you’re heading here during the winter months. Remember to wear layered
clothes so that you’re not unbearably hot when you get off the plane.
Navigating passport control and Customs
Your task upon entering the airport is to clear immigration. At the immi-
gration booth, an officer will ask you to show your passport (or other
proof of citizenship) and your completed tourist card, the FMT (see
Chapter 9 for all the FMT and entry details).
Your FMT is an important document, so take good care of it. You’re sup-
posed to keep the FMT with you at all times because you may be required
to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to turn it back
in upon leaving Mexico, or you may be unable to leave without replacing it.
After you pass through immigration, you go through glass doors to the
baggage claim area — essentially one carousel, so finding your bags should
be simple enough. Here, porters stand by to help with your bags, and
they’re well worth the price of the tip — about a dollar a bag. After you
collect your luggage, you pass through another checkpoint. Something
that looks like a traffic light awaits you here. You press a button, and if the
light turns green, you’re free to go. If it turns red, you need to open each
of your bags for a quick search. It’s Mexico’s random search procedure
for Customs. If you have an unusually large bag, or an excessive amount
of luggage, you may be searched regardless of the traffic-light outcome.
Finally, you pass through a second set of sliding-glass doors that open to
the general airport-arrival area. This is where you find transportation to
your hotel. Booths sell tickets for colectivos (shared van service) and
private taxis. The fares for both are based on distance (see the following
“Getting to your hotel” section). Taxis are always around, but colectivos
gather only for the larger flights. Clear, well-marked signs indicate the
way to the taxis.
Getting to your hotel
The Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo airport is 11km (7 miles) from Zihuatanejo and
13km (8 miles) from Ixtapa. Taxi fares into town range from $19 to $22.
The least expensive way to make the trip to either town is by using the
colectivos, operated by Transportes Terrestres. For transportation to
any of the hotels in Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa, purchase a ticket at the
booth located just outside the baggage-claim area. Cost depends on 
distance, but fares generally run between $6.50 and $8.
Several car-rental agencies also have booths in the airport. These com-
panies include Dollar (% 800-800-4000 in the U.S., or 755-554-2255;
www.dollar.com) and Hertz (% 800-654-3131 in the U.S., or 755-554-2590
or 554-2952; www.hertz.com).
Chapter 21: Settling into Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 295

Getting Around Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
Zihuatanejo is both a fishing village, in the traditional sense of the term,
and a resort town. The town spreads out around the beautiful Bay of
Zihuatanejo, which is framed by the downtown (el centro) to the north
and a beautiful, long beach and the Sierra foothills to the east. The heart
of Zihuatanejo is the waterfront walkway, Paseo del Pescador (also called
the malecón), bordering the Playa Municipal.
One aspect of Zihua (as the locals call Zihuatanejo) that I enjoy most is
that the town centerpiece isn’t a plaza, as it is in most Mexican villages,
but a basketball court, which fronts the beach. It’s a useful point of ref-
erence for directions. The main thoroughfare for cars is Juan Alvarez, a
block behind the malecón. The town has designated several sections of
the main streets as the zona peatonal (pedestrian zone blocked off to
cars). The zona peatonal follows a zigzag pattern, and to me, it seems to
block parts of streets haphazardly.
A cement-and-sand walkway, lit at night, runs from the downtown-
Zihuatanejo malecón along the water to Playa Madera making it easy to
walk between these two points. Access to Playa La Ropa is via the main
road, Camino a Playa La Ropa. Playa La Ropa and Playa Las Gatas are
connected only by boat. Playa La Ropa and Playa Madera are connected
by car (the rocks between the two beaches are dangerous). Skip to
Chapter 23 for a description of these beaches.
Highway 200 connects Zihua to Ixtapa, which is located 6km (4 miles) to
the northwest. The 18-hole Ixtapa Golf Club marks the beginning of the
inland side of Ixtapa. Tall hotels line Ixtapa’s wide beach, Playa el Palmar,
against a backdrop of palm groves and mountains. The main street,
Bulevar Ixtapa, provides access to the beach. A large expanse of small
shopping plazas (many of the shops are air-conditioned) and restau-
rants lie opposite the beach. At the far end of Bulevar Ixtapa, Marina
Ixtapa has excellent restaurants, private yacht slips, and an 18-hole golf
course. Condominiums and private homes surround the marina and golf
course, with exclusive residential communities in the hillsides past the
marina en route to Playa Quieta and Playa Linda. Ixtapa also has a great
paved bicycle track that begins at the marina and continues around the
Marina Ixtapa Golf Course and on toward Playa Linda.
Getting around the two resorts is easy — taxis are the preferred form
of transportation. Rates are reasonable, but from midnight to 5 a.m.,
they increase by 50 percent. The average fare between Ixtapa and 
central Zihuatanejo is $4.50; a trip from Playa La Ropa (just east of
Zihuatanejo) to downtown Zihuatanejo is about $2.50; and it costs
approximately $2.50 to get from one end of the Ixtapa Hotel Zone to
the other.
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 
296

A mini bus (35¢) goes back and forth between Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa
every 15 or 20 minutes from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily, but it’s generally very
hot and crowded with commuting workers. In Zihuatanejo, it stops near
the corner of Morelos-Paseo Zihuatanejo and Juárez, about 3 blocks north
of the market. In Ixtapa, it makes numerous stops along Bulevar Ixtapa.
The highway leading from Zihuatanejo to Ixtapa is now a broad, four-
lane highway, which makes driving between the towns easier and faster
than ever. Street signs are becoming more common in Zihuatanejo, and
good signs now lead you in and out of both towns. However, both loca-
tions have an area called the Zona Hotelera (Hotel Zone), so if you’re
trying to reach Ixtapa’s Hotel Zone (the area alongside Bulevar Ixtapa),
signs in Zihuatanejo pointing to that village’s own Hotel Zone (the area
alongside Playa Madera and Playa La Ropa) may confuse you.
Fast Facts: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
Chapter 21: Settling into Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 297
American Express
The main office (% 755-544-6242; Fax:
755-544-6242) is located in the Plaza San
Rafael, Local 7, on Av. Colegio Heroico
Militar 38. It’s open Monday to Friday from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Area Code
The telephone area code is 755.
Baby Sitters
Most of the larger hotels in Ixtapa can
arrange baby sitters, but many speak lim-
ited English. Rates range from $4 to $10 per
hour. Babysitting services may be more dif-
ficult to come by in Zihuatanejo because
the more upscale places tend to discourage
children and the smaller ones simply may
not have the resources.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Ixtapa’s banks include Bancomer, located
in the La Puerta shopping center. The most
centrally located Zihuatanejo bank is
Banamex, located on Cuauhtémoc 4. Banks
change money during normal business
hours, which are now generally 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. Monday to Friday and Saturday 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. ATMs and casas de cambio
(currency exchange booths) are available
during these and other hours, and they 
generally have the best rates. Most estab-
lishments accept U.S. dollars as readily as
pesos but at reduced exchange rates, so
you’re better off using local currency when-
ever possible. The airport has a currency
exchange booth, so upon arrival, exchange
just enough to pay for your cab fare and
have a bit of cash to move around until you
make it to a bank.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (10 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
4–8 p.m. daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day. Offices tend to close on
Saturday and Sunday, but shops are open
on Saturday, at least, and increasingly offer
limited hours of operation on Sunday.
Climate
Although the climate is always quite warm,
summer is particularly hot and humid, but
sea breezes and brief showers temper the
heat. September is the peak of the tropical
rainy season, and showers are concentrated
in the late afternoons.

Consular Agency
A U.S. Consular Agency is located in
Zihuatanejo (% 755-553-2100; Fax:
755-557-1106).
Emergencies
Police (% 755-554-2040, 755-554-5370); fire
department (% 755-554-0012); Red Cross
(% 755-554-2009).
Hospitals
The larger hotels in Ixtapa have a doctor on
premises or on-call. The Hospital de la
Marina Ixtapa is at Bulevar Ixtapa s/n, in
front of the Hotel Aristos (% 755-553-0499).
In Zihuatanejo, try the Clinica Maciel (Calle
de la Palma 12; % 755-554-2380); its staff
also includes a reliable dentist.
Information
The State Tourism Office (% 888-248-7037
from the U.S., or %/fax 755-553-1967 or
553-1968) is in the La Puerta shopping
center in Ixtapa across from the Presidente
Inter-Continental Hotel. It’s open Monday to
Friday 8 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. This location is
mainly a self-service office where you can
collect brochures; the staff is less helpful
than in other offices in Mexico.
The Zihuatanejo Tourism Office Module 
is on the main square by the basketball
court at Alvarez. It’s open Monday to Friday
9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and serves basic, tourist-
information purposes.
Note: According to recent regulations, the
very few timeshare sales booths that exist
in both towns must be clearly marked with
the names of the businesses and can’t dis-
play signs claiming to be tourist-information
centers.
Internet Access
Several cybercafes are located in the 
Los Patios Shopping Center in Ixtapa.
Comunicación Mundial is in Local 105
(% 755-553-1177). Go to the back of the
shopping center and take the stairs to the
second level; Comunicación Mundial is to
your right. You can find many Internet cafes
in Ixtapa, and the average fee is $3 per hour.
Maps
One of the best around is the free American
Express map, usually found at the tourist
information offices and hotel concierge
desks.
Pharmacy
Farmacias Coyuca are open 24 hours a
day and deliver. The Ixtapa branch doesn’t
have a phone number; in Zihuatanejo, call
% 755-554-5390.
Post Office
The post office for both towns (% 755-
554-2192) is in the SCT building (called
Edificio SCT) behind El Cacahuate. It’s open
Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and
Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Safety
Generally speaking, both Ixtapa and
Zihuatanejo are quite safe, and you
should feel very comfortable walking
around here — even at night.
The one main safety warning applies to
travelers who elect to drive: Motorists plan-
ning to follow Highway 200 northwest up
the coast from Ixtapa or Zihuatanejo toward
Lázaro Cárdenas and Manzanillo should be
aware of reports of car and bus hijackings
on that route, especially around Playa Azul.
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 
298

Bus holdups are more common than car
holdups. Before heading in that direction,
ask locals, the police, or the tourism office
about the status of the route. Don’t drive at
night. According to tourism officials, police
and military patrols of the highway have
increased recently, and the number of inci-
dents has dropped dramatically.
As is the case anywhere, tourists are vul-
nerable to thieves, especially so when
shopping in a market; lying on the beach;
wearing jewelry; or visibly carrying a
camera, purse, or bulging wallet.
Taxes
There’s a 15 percent value-added tax (IVA)
on goods and services, and it’s generally
included in the posted price.
Taxis
Always establish the price of a ride with the
driver before starting out. Taxi rates are rea-
sonable, but from midnight to 5 a.m., rates
increase by 50 percent. The average fare
between Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo is $4.50.
Telephones
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
by using a Telmex (LADATEL) prepaid phone
card, available at most pharmacies and
mini-supers, using the official Telmex (Lada)
public phones.
In Mexico, you need to dial 001 prior to a
number to reach the United States, and you
need to preface long distance calls within
Mexico by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo operate on central
standard time, but Mexico’s observance of
daylight saving time varies somewhat from
that in the United States.

Zihuatanejo

In This Chapter
 Uncovering some local institutions and bargains
 Discovering the best restaurants in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
D
ining destinations in this area are divided as neatly as the accom-
modations: You can find more modern, stylized places in Ixtapa,
and eateries with more local color (and flavor) tend to be located in
neighboring Zihuatanejo (Zihua for short). Although you find the major-
ity of the best-known restaurants in Ixtapa inside the larger hotels,
Zihua’s top spots are small, mostly family-owned treasures. The restau-
rants on Zihuatanejo’s Playa Madera and Playa La Ropa run the gamut
from palapa-topped (thatched-roof) seafood shacks to elegant, upscale
bistros.
From sunset to dinner, cocktails are the highlight of the nocturnal action
here, and although these towns may lack the nightclub action of other
resorts, they do offer a varied and excellent selection of restaurants.
Seafood is the star, of course, but the preparations vary wildly, and in
other cuisines, the influences of the European expatriate community are
evident.
Mexico’s 15 percent value-added tax (IVA) is added into most restaurant
bills, but the tip isn’t, and the waitstaff in Mexico depends on tips for the
majority of their income — the usual tip here is 15 percent.
Finding Fast and Cheap Eats
Zihuatanejo’s central market, located on Avenida Benito Juárez (about 
5 blocks inland from the waterfront), is a perfect place for cheap and
tasty food at breakfast and lunch before the market activity winds down
in the afternoon. Look for what’s hot and fresh. The market area is one
of the best places on this coast for shopping and people-watching.

Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo’s Best Restaurants
I list the following restaurants alphabetically with references to price
and location. Please refer to the Introduction of this book for an explana-
tion of the price categories.
Because restaurants price shrimp and lobster so much higher than
other entrees, I note the price ranges exclusive of these dishes unless
they make up the major part of the menu. And, unless otherwise speci-
fied, reservations aren’t accepted or aren’t necessary.
Please see Appendix C for more information on Mexican cuisine.

NORTHERN ITALIAN
Beccofino is a standout not only in Ixtapa but also in all of Mexico. Owner
Angelo Rolly Pavia serves up the flavorful northern Italian specialties he
grew up enjoying. The breezy location is under a covered slip overlooking
the marina’s yachts. The menu is strong on pasta. Ravioli, a house spe-
cialty, comes stuffed with the freshest seafood, whether swordfish or
shrimp. The garlic bread is terrific, and the wine list is extensive with an
impressive selection of imported wines to choose from. It’s a popular
place, and the restaurant tends to be loud when crowded, which is often.
Beccofino is increasingly becoming a popular breakfast spot.

The place is renowned for chile rellenos, served mild and stuffed with plenty
of cheese, and the pork chops are divinely inspired. Although it may appear
a little too rustic for less experienced travelers to Mexico, Casa Puntarenas
is very clean, and the food is known for its freshness. To get to Puntarenas

ingredients to prepare dishes such as seafood pâté and grilled filet of snap-
per Coconuts. The house specialty is chiles rellenos Luduvina, chile
poblanos stuffed with shrimp and potatoes and topped with a tomato
coulis. The bananas flambé has earned a loyal following of its own — with
good reason. Expect friendly, efficient service here.

Golden Cookie Shop
$
Ixtapa
PASTRIES/INTERNATIONAL
Although the name is misleading — they sell more than cookies here —
Golden Cookie’s fresh baked goods beg for a detour, and the coffee menu
is the most extensive in town — and includes iced-espresso drinks for
those sultry Ixtapa days. The prices are high for the area, but the break-
fasts are particularly noteworthy, as are the deli sandwiches. Large sand-
wiches, made with fresh soft bread, come with a choice of sliced deli
meats, such as smoked ham. Chicken curry is among the other specialty
items, and the Golden Cookie folks serve up a hearty German buffet every
Friday evening at 7 p.m. They have recently expanded their menu to
include sugar-free options for diabetics and dieters. To get to the shop,
walk to the rear of the Los Patios shopping center as you face Mac’s Prime
Rib; walk up the stairs, turn left, and the restaurant is on the right. An air-
conditioned area is reserved for nonsmokers.
Los Patios shopping center. % 755-553-0310. Main courses: $6–$8; breakfast $4–$6;
sandwiches $4–$6. MC, V. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–3 p.m.

Zihuatanejo Beaches/Playa La Ropa
NUEVA COCINA/SEAFOOD
Open architecture, stunning views of the bay, and refined cuisine are
among the hallmarks of this popular restaurant. Head chef Ricardo
Rodriguez supervises every detail of this elegantly understated operation
from the ultra-smooth background music that invites after-dinner conver-
sation to the spectacular presentation of all the dishes. The baked potato
with baby lobster and the mahimahi carpaccio are two of my favorites, but
consider the daily specials — Ricardo always gets the freshest seafood
available and prepares it with great care. For dessert, the pecan and choco-
late cake served with a dark chocolate sauce is simply delicious. During
high season, reservations are essential. Located on the road to Playa La
Ropa, the restaurant is on the right-hand side of the road past the first
curve coming from downtown.

La Perla
$
Playa La Ropa
SEAFOOD
Along Playa La Ropa, you can find any number of casual, palapa-style
restaurants, but La Perla, with its tables under the trees and a thatched
roof, is the most popular. Although it’s known more as a tradition than for
the food or service, somehow, this long stretch of pale sand and groups of
wooden chairs under palapas (thatched-roof umbrellas) have made a
charming combination. Some diners joke that getting a waiter’s attention
at La Perla can be so hard that, if you get take-out food from a competitor
and bring it here to eat, they won’t even notice. Still, La Perla is consid-
ered the best spot around for tanning and socializing and serves a whop-
per of a gringo (American) breakfast. Lunches are lighter — ceviche (fresh
fish cocktail made with finely cubed raw fish that is marinated with lime,
vinegar, and spices) are the specialty. In the evening, casual dinners and
cold cervezas (beers) are accompanied by satellite-dish-delivered sports.
La Perla is located near the southern end of Playa La Ropa. Take the right
fork in the road; a sign is in the parking lot. The kitchen doesn’t open until
10 a.m. but the restaurant is open at 9 a.m. for customers who arrive early
to get the best spots on the beach!
Playa La Ropa. % 755-554-2700. Main courses $6–$11; breakfast $2.50–$5. AE, MC,
V. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–10 p.m.; breakfast served 10 a.m.–noon.
La Sirena Gorda
$
Zihuatanejo Centro
MEXICAN
Head to La Sirena Gorda (the chubby mermaid) for one of the most popu-
lar breakfasts in town. Choose from a variety of eggs and omelets, hot
cakes with bacon, or fruit with granola and yogurt. The house specialty is
seafood tacos — fish in a variety of sauces plus lobster — but I consider
these selections overpriced at $4.50 for the fish and $25 for the lobster. To
me, a taco is a taco is a taco, but they did earn rave reviews in Bon Appétit
a few years back. Instead, I recommend something from the short list of
daily specials such as blackened red snapper, steak, or fish kebabs. The
food is excellent and patrons enjoy the casual sidewalk-cafe atmosphere.
To get here from the basketball court, face the water and walk to the right
along the Paseo; La Sirena Gorda is on your right just before the town pier.

Zihuatanejo Centro
MEXICAN
Rich cappuccinos sprinkled with cinnamon, fresh fruit licuados (kind of a
smoothie), and pancakes with real maple syrup draw patrons to this open-
air snack shop. The mainstays of the menu are tortas and enchiladas, and
everything is offered with friendly, efficient service. Dine indoors and
watch your food get prepared in the spotless open kitchen, or choose a
seat at one of the sidewalk tables for a pleasant people-watching session.

You can easily find Nueva Zelanda by walking 3 blocks inland from the
waterfront on Cuauhtémoc; the restaurant is on your right. A second loca-
tion (% 755-553-0838) is located in Ixtapa in the back section of the Los
Patios shopping center.

Ruben’s

Ixtapa
BURGERS/VEGETABLES
If time in Ixtapa also means a vacation from decision making, then check
out Ruben’s. The choices are easy — you can order a big, juicy burger
made from top-sirloin beef grilled over mesquite or a foil-wrapped packet
of baked potatoes, chayote, zucchini, or sweet corn. Ice cream, beer, and
soda fill out the menu, which is posted on the wall by the kitchen. The
place is kind of a do-it-yourself affair: Guests snare a waitress and order,
grab their own drinks from the cooler, and tally their own tabs. But
because of the ever-present crowds, it can still be a slow process. For
years, Ruben’s was a popular fixture in the Playa Madera neighborhood,
but it moved to two locations in Ixtapa. The food remains as dependable
as ever, even if the locale has expanded and spiffed up a bit.
Flamboyant shopping center, next to Bancomer. Also on Bulevar Ixtapa across from
the Radisson. % 755-553-0027. Main courses: Burgers $3–$5; vegetables $2; ice
cream $1.50. No credit cards. Open: Daily 6–11 p.m. Delivery service also available.
Villa de la Selva
$$–$$$
Ixtapa
MEXICAN/CONTINENTAL
Once the summer home of one-time Mexican president Luis Echevarria,
this exquisite restaurant is set into the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea.
Elegant and romantic, it offers diners the most spectacular sea-and-sunset
view in Ixtapa. Candlelit tables are arranged on three terraces; try to come
early in hopes of getting one of the best vistas — my favorite is the lower
terrace. The cuisine is delicious, artfully appointed, and classically rich:
Filet Villa de la Selva is red snapper topped with shrimp and hollandaise
sauce. The cold avocado soup or hot lobster bisque make a good begin-
ning; finish with chocolate mousse or bananas Singapore. The restaurant
is just above Las Brisas Resort, overlooking Vista Hermosa beach.
Paseo de la Roca. % 755-553-0362. www.villadelaselva.com. Reservations
recommended during high season. Main courses: $15–$44. AE, MC, V. Open: Daily
7–11 p.m. Closed in Sept.

W
hile you’re in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, life isn’t just a beach; it’s 
a choice of beaches! From rocky coves to smooth stretches of
golden sand, this chapter gives you the rundown on all the key beaches
in the area and highlights the beaches that are best for watersports and
safest for swimming so that you can choose the patch of sand that’s per-
fect for you. If you’re looking for adventure beyond the sea, I also have
some recommendations for you — along with tips on the best shopping
and nightlife.
All beaches in Zihuatanejo are safe for swimming because undertow is
rarely a problem, and the municipal beach is protected from the Pacific
Ocean’s main surge. Beaches in Ixtapa are more dangerous for swimming
because of frequent undertow problems, so keep an eye on the safety
flags posted in front of the hotel beaches.
Hitting the Beaches
This section contains the skinny on the area’s beaches, traveling from
the beaches northwest of Ixtapa to those south of Zihuatanejo. Even if
you fall in love at first sight with the stretch of sand immediately in front
of your hotel, explore a bit to see what other beauties are out there.

Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo Area
Chapter 23: Having Fun on and off the Beach 307

Playa Linda and Playa Quieta are about as far out as you’re likely to
travel to find a beach in this area. Playa Linda, about 13km (8 miles)
north of Ixtapa (about 10 min. by taxi), is the departure point for the
inexpensive water taxis that ferry passengers to Isla Ixtapa. It’s also the
primary out-of-town beach, a long stretch of flat sand with watersports
equipment and horseback riding. Along with a collection of small stands
selling trinkets, the La Palapa restaurant makes a good place to spend
the afternoon. Playa Linda faces the open ocean but also lies near a
freshwater estuary that’s home to birds, iguanas, and the occasional alli-
gator — visible through the safety of a fence. Club Med and Qualton
Club have largely claimed neighboring Playa Quieta directly across from
Isla Ixtapa. The beach at Playa Quieta is beautiful, but unless you’re stay-
ing at either of those resorts, you won’t find shade, drinks, or any sort of
beach club facilities. If you’re not staying on Playa Quieta, skip it. The
other beaches are just as beautiful and a lot easier to get to.
Around the Punta Ixtapa peninsula lies Playa Las Cuatas, a pretty beach
and cove a few miles outside of Ixtapa. It has heavy surf and a strong
undertow, so I don’t recommend it for swimming.
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 
308
Finding fun in the sun off the mainland
Some notable beaches, along with clear water, snorkeling, and a few nature trails, are
out on Isla Ixtapa. You can find four small beaches on the island, the busiest of which
is Playa Cuachalatate, named for a native tree. It’s the arrival point for the ferryboats
and has a selection of palapa-topped restaurants. Playa Varadero, with calm clear
waters that make it a favorite for snorkeling, is along a paved walkway to the right of
Playa Cuachalatate. Group tours here usually include lunch at El Marlin restaurant. 
El Marlin is one of several restaurants on the island, but it’s not appreciably better than
the others, so feel confident in making your way on your own.
Continue to the right along the same path past Playa Varadero and you come to Playa
Coral, which true to name, offers the most varied groupings of underwater coral in the
area — it’s excellent for snorkeling. The most isolated of the beaches on Isla Ixtapa
is Playa Carey — to the left of the Playa Cuachalatate dock. It doesn’t have any facil-
ities but makes a great spot for a picnic. (Be sure to take your trash with you as you
leave — no containers are available here for disposal.)
Boats leave the dock at Playa Linda for Isla Ixtapa every 10 minutes between 11:30 a.m.
and 5 p.m., so you can depart and return at your own pace. The round-trip boat ride is
$2.50 and takes anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes (depending on the boat and the boat’s
captain). Along the way, you pass dramatic rock formations, and you can see Los
Moros de Los Pericos islands in the distance where a great variety of birds nest on
its rocky points jutting out into the blue Pacific. When you reach Isla Ixtapa, you can
find snorkeling, diving, and other watersports gear available for rent. Be sure to catch
the last water taxi back at 5 p.m., but double-check that time upon arrival on the island.

Ixtapa’s main beach, Playa el Palmar, is a lovely white-sand arc on the
edge of the Hotel Zone. Almost 5km (3 miles) long, this beach features
dramatic rock formations by the sea. The surf here can be rough; use
caution and don’t swim when a red flag is posted. Several of the nicest
beaches in the area are essentially closed to the public — resort devel-
opments rope them off exclusively for their guests. Although by law all
Mexican beaches are open to the public, it’s a common practice for
hotels to create artificial barriers (such as rocks or dunes) to preclude
entrance to their beaches.
Next up is lovely Playa Vista Hermosa, framed by striking rock forma-
tions and bordered by the Las Brisas Resort high on the hill. Although
very attractive for sunbathing or a stroll, this patch of sand is also
known for its heavy surf and strong undertow, so use extreme caution 
if swimming or snorkeling here.
Local fishermen still use the Zihuatanejo town beach, Playa Municipal,
to pull their colorful boats up onto the sand — a fine photo op. The
small shops and restaurants lining the waterfront here are great for
people-watching and absorbing the flavor of daily village life.
Just east of Playa Municipal lies Playa Madera, which is accessible by
following a lighted concrete-and-sand walkway that cuts through the
rocks for about 90m (300 ft.) from the Paseo del Pescador. The beach
itself is open to the Pacific surf but is generally peaceful. A number of
attractive budget lodgings overlook this area from the hillside, and
beachside restaurants line the shore.
South of Playa Madera is Zihuatanejo’s largest and most beautiful beach,
Playa La Ropa, a long sweep of sand with a great view of the sunset.
Some lovely, small hotels and restaurants nestle into the hills; palm
groves edge the shoreline. Although it’s also open to the Pacific, waves
are usually gentle. A taxi from town costs $3. The name “Playa La Ropa,”
ropa means clothing, comes from an old tale of a galeón that sunk during
a big storm. The silk clothing that the boat was carrying back from the
Philippines all washed ashore on this beach — hence the name.
The nicest beach for swimming and the best beach for children is the
secluded Playa Las Gatas. You can see this delicate ribbon of sand,
which is speckled with minute seashells, across the bay from Playa La
Ropa and Zihuatanejo. The small coral reef just offshore is a nice spot
for snorkeling and diving, and a few small dive shops on the beach rent
gear. The waters at Las Gatas are exceptionally clear and there’s no
undertow or big waves, which is due in large part to a rock wall sur-
rounding the beach that turns the waters into a virtual wading pool. The
pre-Hispanic emperor Calzonzin, who chose this beach as his private
playground more than 500 years ago, constructed the wall. Open-air
seafood restaurants on the beach make it an appealing lunch spot. 
(Two of the restaurants are now open for dinner as well.) Small, shaded
pangas (small boats) make the voyage to Las Gatas from the Zihuatanejo
town pier, a ten-minute trip. The captains can take you across whenever
Chapter 23: Having Fun on and off the Beach 309

you want between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Evening ferries are less predictable,
so check for the current schedule. A round-trip fare generally runs about
$3.50.
Finding Water Fun for Everyone
The beaches here are so appealing because the waters are crystal clear
and obviously free of pollution and over-fishing. Snorkel, dive, cast a
line, or take a dip — it’s a slice of heaven. And there are other ways to
enjoy splashing around . . . or cruising above the deep blue.
Skiing and surfing
Rental stands with sailboats, windsurfers, and other watersports equip-
ment are located at numerous points along Playa La Ropa and Playa Las
Gatas in Zihuatanejo, Playa el Palmar in Ixtapa, and even on Isla Ixtapa.
You can parasail (about $20 for a 15-min. ride) at La Ropa and Palmar.
Kayaks are available for rent at Carlos Scuba (Cuauhtémoc 3; % 755-
554-42810 or 554-6003; www.carloscuba.com), hotels in Ixtapa, and
some watersports operations on Playa La Ropa. A few places also have
WaveRunners, which rent for about $30 per half-hour.
Exploring the deep blue
These clear waters, with more than 30 deep-dive sites, just beg to be
explored! Water visibility frequently is more than 30m (100 ft.), espe-
cially from December through May when the temperature is usually
comfortably warm. You’re likely to see an abundance of sea life — as
well as an old anchor or other artifacts from the days of the Spanish 
conquistadors.
Arrange your scuba-diving trip through Carlos Scuba (Cuauhtémoc 3;
% 755-554-2810 or 554-6003; www.carloscuba.com). Fees start at
around $80 for two dives including all equipment and lunch. Expert,
bilingual dive instructors are available for all levels of dive instruction.
This group is the most knowledgeable about the area, which has excel-
lent dive sites, including walls and caves, for all experience levels.
Certification courses are available, and the dive-guide-to-diver ratio is 
an outstanding one-to-three.
I suggest that you make advance reservations for dives during Christmas
and Easter.
The diving here is great, but you can also enjoy many of the underwater
sites without going to such depths. Snorkeling is best at Zihuatanejo’s
Playa Las Gatas, Isla Ixtapa’s Playa Varadero, and Playa Vista Hermosa in
front of the Las Brisas Resort. Equipment rentals are available at all loca-
tions and range from $5 to $15 a day.
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 
310

Reeling in the big one
Looking for the big one? Billfish — notably blue and black marlin and
Pacific sailfish — swim in the waters off Zihuatanejo. And, when you
catch the big one, release it. It may sting a bit, but this conservation
effort is increasingly popular in Mexico, and I encourage it. You can
arrange fishing trips with the boat cooperative (% 755-554-2056) at the
Zihuatanejo town pier. Excursions cost $140 to $300 per trip depending
on boat size, trip length, and other factors. Most trips last about six
hours; no credit cards are accepted. The price includes ten soft drinks
and ten beers, bait, and fishing gear. Lunch is on your own.
You pay more for a trip arranged through a local travel agency; the least
expensive trips are on small launches called pangas — most have shade.
Outfits offer both small-game and deep-sea fishing. The fishing here is
adequate, but it’s not on par with that of Mazatlán or Baja.
You can also arrange trips that combine fishing with a visit to the nearly
deserted ocean beaches that extend for miles along the coast north 
and south of the towns of Zihua and Ixtapa. Sam Lushinsky at Ixtapa
Sportfishing Charters (19 Depue Lane, Stroudsburg, PA 18360; % 570-
688-9466; Fax: 570-688-9554; www.ixtapasportfishing.com) is a noted
fishing outfitter. They accept MasterCard and Visa.
Boating and fishing expeditions from the Marina Ixtapa, a bit north of
the Ixtapa Hotel Zone, can also be arranged. As a rule, everything avail-
able in or through the marina is more expensive, in addition to being
more “Americanized.”
Tipping the captain 10 percent to 15 percent of the total price of your
charter is customary, depending on the quality of the service. Give the
money to the captain, and he’ll split it with the mates.
Cruising Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
The area’s most popular boat trip is probably the voyage to Isla Ixtapa
for snorkeling and lunch at the El Marlin restaurant or one of several
other restaurants on the island. You can book this outing as a tour
through any local travel agency or your hotel tour desk, or you can head
out on your own from Playa Linda, which allows you to follow your own
schedule. (Check out the “Finding fun in the sun off the mainland” side-
bar, earlier in this chapter, for more info on getting to Isla Ixtapa from
Playa Linda.)
Local travel agencies can also arrange day trips to Los Moros de Los
Pericos islands for bird-watching, though it’s less expensive to rent a
boat with a guide at Playa Linda. These islands are located offshore from
Playa el Palmar; however, you must leave from Playa Linda because no
boats depart from Playa el Palmar.
Chapter 23: Having Fun on and off the Beach 311

Day cruises and sunset cruises on the trimaran (a catamaran with an
extra hull) TriStar can be arranged through Yates del Sol (% 755-554-
2694 or 554-8270) or through any travel agent (with no difference in
price). Both day and sunset cruises depart from the Zihuatanejo town
pier at Puerto Mío.
The day cruise sails to Playa Manzanillo, where you have time for swim-
ming, snorkeling, and shell collecting. On the return trip, the boat anchors
off Playa La Ropa. The price of $59 includes lunch, an open bar, and
round-trip transportation from your hotel. Snorkeling gear is $5 extra.
There’s also a day trip to Isla Ixtapa on this very comfortable and rarely
crowded yacht that begins at 10 a.m., costs $49, and includes an open bar
and lunch. The sunset cruise, generally running from 5 to 7:30 p.m., costs
$39 and includes an open bar and snacks. Because schedules and special
trips vary, call for current information.
Enjoying Land Sports
Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo offer plenty of popular land sports for vacation-
ers. In this section, I cover golf, tennis, and horseback riding. If you’re
looking for an activity I don’t list here, be sure to consult your hotel or
resort concierge for more information.
Teeing off
Ixtapa has two locations where you can tee off. One spot is the Club de
Golf Ixtapa Palma Real (% 755-553-1062 or 553-1163), located in front
of the Barceló Hotel at the entrance to Ixtapa’s Hotel Zone as you arrive
from Zihuatanejo. Robert Trent Jones, Jr., designed the 18-hole course,
and much of the land here is protected as a wildlife preserve, so you
may see flamingos or cranes near the lagoon at the 15th hole. Greens
fees are $70; caddies cost an additional $20 for 18 holes or $11 for nine
holes. Electric carts are $25, and club rentals are $20. Tee times begin 
at 7 a.m., but the club doesn’t take reservations. Another option is the
Marina Ixtapa Golf Course (% 755-553-1410), which was designed by
Robert von Hagge and features 18 challenging holes. It’s located at the
opposite end of Hotel Zone from the Palma Real — the courses kind of
form two bookends. The greens fees are $120; carts, caddies, and club
rentals are $20 each. The first foursome tees off at 7 a.m. Call for reser-
vations 24 hours in advance. (Both courses accept American Express,
MasterCard, and Visa.)
Taking time for tennis
If you want to work on your tennis game in Ixtapa, both the Club de Golf
Ixtapa Palma Real (% 755-553-1062 or 553-1163) and the Marina Ixtapa
Golf Course (% 755-553-1410) have lighted public courts and equip-
ment available for rent. Fees are $10 per hour during the day and $12 per
hour at night. In addition, the Dorado Pacífico and most of the better
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 
312

hotels on the Playa el Palmar have courts. Although priority play is
given to guests, most hotel courts are also open to the public.
Galloping along
For horseback riding, Rancho Playa Linda (no phone) offers guided trail
rides from the Playa Linda beach (about 13km/8 miles north of Ixtapa).
Guided rides begin at 8:30, 9:45, and 11 a.m. and 3, 4, and 5 p.m. The early
morning ride is the coolest, and it’s a beautiful way to start a day; the 
5 p.m. trip offers a view of the sunset. Groups of three or more riders can
arrange their own tour, which is especially nice a little later in the evening
around sunset (though you need mosquito repellent). Riders can choose
to ride along the beach to the mouth of the river and then follow the river
back through coconut plantations, or they can hug the beach for the
whole ride (which usually lasts between an hour and an hour and a half).
The fee is around $30, cash only. Travel agencies in either town can
arrange your trip but do charge a bit more for transportation. During the
high season, I suggest that you make reservations. Another good place to
go horseback riding is at Playa Larga. There’s a ranch on the first exit
coming from Zihuatanejo on Highway 200 going south (no phone, but you
can’t miss it — it’s the first corral to the right as you drive toward the
beach). The horses are in excellent shape, and the fee is $30 for 45 min-
utes. To arrange riding in advance, call Ignacio Mendiola, at % 755-559-
8884 (it’s a cellphone, so locally, dial 044 before the number).
Sightseeing in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
One of the most enjoyable things to do here doesn’t even cost a peso —
stroll along Zihuatanejo’s Paseo del Pescador and take in the local life.
Fishing boats bob in the waters, gulls circle overhead, and the basketball
court is constantly in use.
The Museo de Arqueología de la Costa Grande (no phone), which
traces the area’s history from Acapulco to Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo from
pre-Hispanic times through the colonial era, is at the east end of the
Paseo del Pescador near Vicente Guerrero. Most of the museum’s pot-
tery and stone artifacts provide evidence of extensive trade between the
peoples of this area and far-off cultures and regions, including the Toltec
and Teotihuacán cultures near Mexico City, the Olmec culture on both
the Pacific and Gulf coasts, and areas along the northern Pacific coast.
This museum easily merits the half-hour or less it takes to stroll through;
information signs are in Spanish, but an accompanying brochure is avail-
able in English. Admission is $1, and it’s open Tuesday to Sunday from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Shopping in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo
Shopping isn’t especially memorable in Ixtapa — T-shirts and Mexican
crafts make up most of the offerings. Several of the town’s numerous
Chapter 23: Having Fun on and off the Beach 313

plazas have air-conditioned shops that carry resort wear — as well as
the requisite T-shirts and silver jewelry. These shops are within the
same area on Bulevar Ixtapa, across from the beachside hotels, and
most are open 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 9 p.m. including Sunday.
However, the terrific shop La Fuente (in the Los Patios shopping center;
% 755-553-0812) is worth a stop in Ixtapa. The shop carries gorgeous
Talavera pottery, jaguar-shaped wicker tables, hand-blown glassware,
masks, tin mirrors and frames, hand-embroidered clothing from Chiapas,
and wood and papier-mâché miniatures.
Zihuatanejo, like other resorts in Mexico, also has its quota of T-shirt and
souvenir shops, but it’s becoming a better place to buy Mexican crafts,
folk art, and jewelry. The artisan’s market on Calle Cinco de Mayo is a
good place to start your shopping before moving on to specialty shops. 
A municipal market is located on Avenida Benito Juárez (about 5 blocks
inland from the waterfront, sprawling over several blocks), but most of
the vendors offer the same things — huaraches (Mexican-style sandals
made of hard leather), hammocks, and baskets — with little variety.
Numerous small shops spread inland from the waterfront some 3 or 
4 blocks and are well worth exploring.
Shops are generally open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to
8 p.m.; many of the better shops close on Sunday, but some smaller sou-
venir stands stay open, although the hours vary.
I recommend the following shops:
 The small Casa Marina complex (Paseo del Pescador 9, along the
waterfront heading in the direction of Alvarez near Cinco de Mayo;
% 755-554-2373) houses four shops, each specializing in hand-
crafted wares from all over Mexico including handsome rugs, tex-
tiles, masks, colorful woodcarvings, and silver jewelry. Café Marina,
the small coffee shop in the complex, has shelves and shelves of
used paperback books in several languages for sale.
 Coco Cabaña Collectibles (Guerrero and Alvarez, next to Coconuts
Restaurant; % 755-554-2518) is filled with carefully selected crafts
and folk art, including fine Oaxacan woodcarvings, from all across
the country. Owner Pat Cummings once ran a gallery in New York,
and the inventory reveals her discriminating eye.
 Viva Zapatos (Guerrero 33, three doors down from Amueblados
Valle; no phone) carries bathing suits to fit every shape and fashion
trend, great casual and not-so-casual resort wear, sunglasses, and
just about everything else for looking good in and out of the water.
Taking a Side Trip
About 32km (20 miles) northwest of Ixtapa, the tiny fishing hamlet of
Troncones, with its long beaches, has become a favorite escape for 
Part VI: Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo 
314

visitors to Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo — when that pace of life becomes 
too hectic. Troncones is so remote that only a few people have phones.
Strolling the empty beach, swimming in the sea, and hiking in the jungle
and to nearby caves is about the extent of the action. When you’ve built
up an appetite, satisfy it with fresh seafood at one of the fisherman-
shack restaurants.
No public buses serve this area, so you must join a tour or hire a taxi to
take you to Troncones. For about $30, the taxi driver can take you to the
area and return at the hour you request to bring you back to town. Some
travel agencies have day trips here for about $25, which usually include
lunch; it’s cheaper, but less flexible than a taxi.
If you’re only spending the day in Troncones, you can use the restaurant
El Burro Borracho (% 755-553-2834 or 553-2800) as your headquarters
and have the taxi return for you there. This casual beachfront establish-
ment isn’t your ordinary beach-shack restaurant. Owned by a former
chef from San Francisco, it offers fish, shrimp, and lobster as well as
steak and grilled meat. Try the shrimp tacos for a uniquely Troncones
treat. Wash the tasty grub down with a frosty margarita, an iced cappuc-
cino, a glass of wine, or a cold beer. Remember that El Burro Borracho
doesn’t accept credit cards, and it’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Discovering Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo after Dark
With an exception or two, Zihuatanejo nightlife dies down around 11 p.m.
or midnight. For a decent selection of clubs, discos, hotel fiestas, and spe-
cial events, head for Ixtapa. Just keep in mind that shuttle-bus service
ends at 11 p.m., and a taxi ride back to Zihuatanejo after midnight costs 
50 percent more than the regular price. During low season (after Easter
and before Christmas), club hours vary: Some places are open only on
weekends, and others are closed completely. In Zihuatanejo, a lively bar
with satellite TV sports, is Bandido’s, at the intersection of Cinco de Mayo
and Pedro Ascencio in Zihuatanejo Centro, across from the Artisan’s
Market (% 755-553-8072). It features live music Wednesdays through
Saturdays, and is open nightly until 2am, but is closed on Sundays from
May to October. A popular hangout for local residents and ex-pats is
Rick’s Bar, Av. Cuatémoc 5, in Zihuatanejo centro (% 755-554-2535). 
On Fridays it’s known for its live music jam sessions, open to anyone
wanting to share their unique talents. It’s open Monday through Saturday
from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Many Ixtapa hotels hold Mexican fiestas and other special events that
include dinner, drinks, live music, and entertainment for a fixed price
(generally $33). The Barceló Ixtapa (% 755-553-1858) hosts the most
popular fiesta, held each Wednesday night. Call for reservations or book
your seats through your hotel’s travel agency.
Chapter 23: Having Fun on and off the Beach 315

Many discos and dance clubs in Zihua and Ixtapa stay open until the last
customers leave, so closing hours depend upon the revelers.
Most discos have a ladies night at least once a week — admission and
drinks are free for women, making it easy for men to buy them a drink.
The Anderson chain of festive restaurants is a standard in Mexican
nightlife, and Ixtapa has two of them. Carlos ’n Charlie’s (Bulevar Ixtapa,
just north of the Best Western Posada Real; % 755-553-0085) runs knee-
deep in nostalgia, bric-a-brac, silly sayings, and photos from the Mexican
Revolution. This restaurant-nightclub boasts a party ambience and good
food. The eclectic menu includes iguana in season (with antacids and
aspirin on the house). Out back by the beach is an open-air section
(partly shaded) with a raised wooden platform for “pier-dancing” at
night. The recorded rock-and-roll mixes with sounds of the ocean surf.
The restaurant is open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight; pier dancing is
held nightly from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. The second tried-but-true Mexican
nightspot from the Anderson lineup is Señor Frog’s (Bulevar Ixtapa, in
the La Puerta Center; % 755-553-2282), which features several dining
sections and a warehouse-like bar with raised dance floors. The rock-
and-roll playing from large speakers sometimes prompts even dinner
patrons to shimmy by their tables between courses. The restaurant is
open daily 6 p.m. to midnight; the bar is open until 3 a.m.
Of all the clubs in Ixtapa, Christine (Bulevar Ixtapa, in the Hotel Krystal;
% 755-553-0333) is both the best known and the glitziest. A throwback
to the days of disco, Christine is famous for its midnight light show,
which features classical music played on a mega sound system. A semi-
circle of tables arranged in tiers overlooks the dance floor. No tennis
shoes, sandals, or shorts are allowed, and reservations are advised
during high season. It’s open nightly during high season from 10 p.m. 
to the wee hours of the mornin’ (off-season hours vary). Cover varies
depending on the day of the week from free to $20, and all major credit
cards are accepted.
Ixtapa’s most progressive nocturnal option is Zen (% 755-553-0003 or
553-0293), located on Bulevar Ixtapa, next to the Radisson Hotel. Music
includes acid jazz, Drum+Bass, and ambient. With a cover charge rang-
ing from free to $10, a young, hip crowd enjoys Zen.

t’s a beach resort . . . and it’s a big glittering city. The
largest and most decadent of Mexico’s beach resorts,
Acapulco can be daunting at ﬁrst glance.
With its 24-hour, nonstop action, Acapulco can overwhelm
ﬁrst-time visitors. But have no fear — this part helps you
choose your accommodations and serves up insights on the
best places to dine — from simply delectable ﬁsh-taco stands
to cliff-side gourmet restaurants with views of Acapulco Bay’s
dazzling nightlights. Nightlife? You can’t visit Acapulco without
sampling this part of the action. The Acapulco club scene
remains the super-hot attraction of this grand dame of Mexico’s
beach resorts.

Chapter 24
The Lowdown on
Acapulco’s Hotel Scene
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Laying out the hotel locations
 Evaluating the número uno hotel choices
A
capulco was the first Mexican beach town to attract tourism to its
golden sands, warm waters, and sunny days. Since the late 1930s,
this beach resort has welcomed visitors from around the world, and at
one time, it rivaled Rio de Janeiro as the playground of the elite and
famous. Today, Acapulco offers one of the widest ranges of hotel choices
among Mexican beach resorts — something for every taste and budget.
Because Acapulco’s heyday occurred somewhere between 1950 and
1970, many of the hotels are notably dated; however, others have been
kept up admirably, offering a funky, kind of retro charm. To me, the
single most striking feature of Acapulco is the view of the twinkling
lights of the bay at night — an impressive sight that tends to draw you
into its nocturnal energy, tempting you to come out and play. The best
views are from the hilltop hotels and from the resorts on the bay’s
southern border, but any of the high-rise locations along Playa Condesa
also offer prime views.
Choosing a Location
During my first encounter with Acapulco, I dismissed it as an outdated
resort — a tired and ill-kempt relic most appropriate for those who
enjoy a carnival-type atmosphere and sleeping all day to prepare for
nights that last until sunrise. But my opinion was colored by where I was
staying — in the heart of the rowdiest beach-bar action — which didn’t
suit my mood at the time. As I grew to know Acapulco and became
acquainted with her other sides, it didn’t take long for me to succumb to
this diva’s unique charms. Acapulco’s energy is tireless (if occasionally

tawdry), and her appeal lies somewhere between that of Las Vegas and
Miami. Your decision about where to stay plays a huge role in determin-
ing how happy you’ll be with your Acapulco vacation.
Although Acapulco is an expansive city of several million residents,
most visitors only come in contact with the area directly bordering
Acapulco Bay and its beaches, which is easy to navigate and can be
divided into three main areas. There’s really no need to explore more —
and you’re not likely to have enough time to take in all the sights, activi-
ties, and options for dining and nightlife in these areas during a typical
weeklong stay anyway.
Running from north to south, the first principal area is Old Acapulco,
the historic section with a true downtown and plenty of budget 
accommodations.
Old Acapulco — the original heart of this grand dame of Mexico’s beach
resorts — has a great selection of basic, inexpensive hotels, and lots 
of local color. Travelers familiar with Acapulco — or comfortable with
travel in Mexico — tend to prefer this area. Numerous budget hotels dot
the streets fanning out from the zócalo (Acapulco’s official and original
central plaza). These accommodations are among the best values in
Acapulco but, with the exception of the Hotel Los Flamingos — one of
my favorite places to stay in Mexico — generally offer only the most
basic of comforts.
Next comes the Costera Hotel Zone. The mid-range, high-rise hotels —
lined up side by side, looking much like Miami Beach — are concen-
trated along this golden stretch of Playa Condesa. The area offers plenty
of options for shopping, dining, and nightlife, and is easy to navigate, so
it’s the best choice for first-time visitors.
If you’re looking to spoil yourself, the hotels in the southern neighbor-
hoods and up in the hillsides overlooking the bay are your best bets.
The hillside neighborhood bordering the curve of the southern edge of
Acapulco Bay is Las Brisas, the elegant address in town and home of
Acapulco’s exclusive villas and lusher hotels. Encompassing the Las
Brisas area, south of Acapulco Bay, as you travel toward the airport, are
the neighborhoods of Punta Diamante and Revolcadero Beach, which
fronts the Pacific Ocean. This is where you find the most expensive and
luxurious resorts, complete with golf courses.
Las Brisas is several miles from the heart of Acapulco; anytime you want
to travel into the Hotel Zone to enjoy its restaurants, shopping malls, or
nightclubs, you’re looking at a round-trip taxi fare of anywhere from $12
to $20.
Part VII: Acapulco 
320

Acapulco’s Best Accommodations
Each hotel listing includes specific rack rates for two people spending
one night in a double room during high season (Christmas to Easter),
unless otherwise indicated. Rack rates simply mean published rates and
tend to be the highest rate paid — you can do better, especially if you’re
purchasing a package that includes airfare (see Chapter 7 for tips on
how to avoid paying rack rates). Please refer to the Introduction of this
book for an explanation of the price categories.
It’s not unusual for many hotels to double their normal rates during
Christmas and Easter weeks, but low-season rates can be anywhere from
20 percent to 60 percent below high-season rates. Note that some rates
may seem much higher than others, until you realize that they’re all
inclusive, meaning that your meals and beverages are included in the
price of your stay. These rates also include all tips, taxes, and most
activities and entertainment.
All hotels have air-conditioning unless otherwise indicated.
Camino Real Acapulco Diamante
$$$$$
Punta Diamante/Puerto Marqués
I love this hotel — it’s an oasis of tranquillity in the middle of Acapulco’s
nonstop energy. This relaxing, self-contained resort is an ideal choice for
families or for travelers who already know Acapulco and don’t care to
explore much. If swimming in the ocean is a priority, this is your best bet
in the area — it’s located on the clean and safe-for-swimming Playa Puerto
Marqués — but you do miss out on the compelling views of Acapulco Bay.
In terms of contemporary décor, services, and amenities, I consider this to
be one of Acapulco’s finest hotels. The Camino Real is tucked in a
secluded, 32-hectare (81-acre) location — part of the enormous Punta
Diamante development. From Carretera Escénica, you wind down a hand-
some brick road to the site of the hotel overlooking Puerto Marqués Bay.
The spacious rooms have balconies or terraces, small sitting areas, marble
floors, a safe-deposit box in the closet, and comfortable, classic furnish-
ings. A bonus: The Camino Real offers 24-hour room service with a terrific
menu at very reasonable prices — competitive with area restaurants after
you figure in the cost of a round-trip taxi ride. The property also offers spe-
cial amenities for children including the kid’s “Mischief Club” and a chil-
dren’s pool. For adults, a small health club, spa, and tennis court are
on-site.

Costa Linda Hotel
$$
Playa Caleta/Old Acapulco
Budget-minded American and Mexican couples are drawn to the clean,
sunny, and well-kept rooms of the Costa Linda, one of the area’s best
values. Playa Caleta is just a 1-block walk from the property. All rooms
have a minifridge, and some have a small kitchenette, making it a good
choice for longer stays or for those who want to save vacation dollars by
preparing a few of their own meals. Although the Costa Linda is cozy, it’s
situated adjacent to one of the busier streets in Old Acapulco, so traffic
noise can be bothersome. Rooms surround a small pool with lounge chairs
and tropical plants. Choose an upstairs room for more privacy. A tennis
court is also available.
Costera Miguel Alemán 1008, just above the entrance to Caleta Beach pier. % 744-
482-5277 or 482-2549. Fax: 744-483-4017. 44 units. Free parking. Rack rates: High
season $90 double; low season $35 double. Two children under 8 stay free in par-
ents’ room. MC, V.
Elcano Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Costera Hotel Zone
An Acapulco classic and a personal favorite of mine, the Elcano is known
for its prime location near the convention center on a broad stretch of
golden-sand beach. Its retro-style, turquoise-and-white lobby, and its
beachfront pool area are the closest you can get to a South Beach Miami
atmosphere in Acapulco, and its popular open-air restaurant adds to the
lively waterfront scene. On the whole, the Elcano reminds me of a set from
a classic Elvis-in-Acapulco movie — you almost expect to see the King
among the tanned beach regulars here. The hotel’s reputation is further
enhanced by its exceptional service. The continually upgraded rooms, fea-
turing classic navy-and-white accents, are bright and very comfortable,
and most offer ample oceanfront balconies. This place is ideal if you attend
a convention in Acapulco or want the optimal location between hillside
nightlife and the Costera beach zone.

El Mirador Acapulco
$$$
Old Acapulco
The best part about staying here is watching those amazing Acapulco cliff
divers every day and evening from the comfort of your room. It’s an unfor-
gettable sight and a real adrenaline rush. The hotel is built in a horseshoe
shape at the apex of La Quebrada, the famous cove where the cliff divers
perform. Recently renovated with tropical landscaping and Mexican tile
accents, this hotel offers attractively furnished rooms with a choice of
double or queen-size beds, kitchenettes with a minifridge and coffeemaker,
Part VII: Acapulco 
324

and large bathrooms with marble counters. Most have a separate living
room, some have a whirlpool tub, and all feature colorful, Saltillo-tile
accents and other Mexican decorative touches. Be sure to ask for a room
with a balcony or ocean view. The restaurant and bar also offer great views
of the cliff-diving shows and are popular with tourists from other hotels
during the evening performances. The beach here is a steep jump down
the cliff, but the resort does offer an alternative in the form of a saltwater
pool (though it is occasionally out of service) as well as two freshwater
pools. A protected cove with good snorkeling is located nearby.

Fiesta Americana Condesa Acapulco
$$–$$$$
Costera Hotel Zone
The location of this hotel — in the absolute heart of Playa Condesa — is
perfect for travelers who don’t want to miss a beat and who look to be
right in the middle of the casual beach-bar action. The 18-story structure,
located just east of and up the hill from the Glorieta Diana (a landmark
traffic circle with a statue of Diana the Huntress — which is a duplicate of
the one in Mexico City — at its center), towers above Playa Condesa. The
unremarkable but comfortable rooms tend to be loud (depending on the

a private terrace or balcony with an ocean view. In addition to a beach-
front pool, an adults-only hilltop swimming pool offers one of the finest
views of Acapulco in the city, plus the hotel has a smaller children’s pool
and a sun deck.

Hotel Caleta

Playa Caleta/Old Acapulco
If you prefer the authentic feel of a Mexican holiday with all its boisterous,
family-friendly, and spirited charms, then the Hotel Caleta (formerly known
as the Grand Meigas Acapulco Resort) is a great choice. It’s also a great
value. The rooms at this all-inclusive property are simple — stark even —
but the hotel itself is usually heavily populated and teeming with activity.
This high-quality, nine-floor resort is built into a cliff on the Caleta penin-
sula and is located adjacent to one of the liveliest beaches in Old Acapulco.
Successions of stepped terraces are home to tropical gardens, restaurants,
and pools — both saltwater and freshwater. A private beach and boat dock
are located down a brief flight of stairs. Rooms surround a central plant-
filled courtyard topped by a glass ceiling, and all rooms have large terraces
Chapter 24: The Lowdown on Acapulco’s Hotel Scene 325

with ocean views, although some layouts lack separation from the neigh-
boring terrace. As is traditional in all-inclusive resorts, meals and drinks
are available at almost any hour, and the resort has a changing agenda of
theme nights and evening entertainment.

Hotel Los Flamingos
$$
Old Acapulco
What a find! You can’t help but fall in love with Los Flamingos as soon as
you see it — I couldn’t! — with its funky charm that transports you back
to the days when there was a Hollywood jet set and Acapulco was their
playground. Perched on a cliff 150m (500 ft.) above Acapulco Bay, this
hotel was frequented by such former Hollywood stars as John Wayne, Cary
Grant, Johnny Weissmuller, Fred MacMurray, Errol Flynn, Red Skelton, Roy
Rogers, and a host of others. In fact, the stars liked the Flamingos so much
that at one point they bought it and converted it into a private club.
Though it enjoys a colorful history, it’s in excellent shape and is excep-
tionally clean. Los Flamingos offers visitors a totally different perspective
of Acapulco because it maintains all the charm of that grand era gone by.
Photos of movie stars grace the lobby, especially those of Wayne, Grant,
and Weissmuller — who constructed the large “Tarzan Suite” (also known
as the “Round House”) as his part-time residence. All rooms have dramatic
ocean views with either a large balcony or terrace, but most of them aren’t
air-conditioned (those that are also have TVs). Still, the constant sea
breeze is cool enough. Rooms are colorful with mosaic-tile tables, mirrors,
and brightly painted walls. A small pool is the popular gathering point
during the day; the large bar is the place to be in the evening. I don’t rec-
ommend this hotel for small children though — the same dramatic setting
that produces such spectacular views can also inspire a constant state of
panic for parents. A weekly pozole (a special stew made from hominy,
served with shredded pork or chicken and an assortment of toppings)
party makes Thursdays especially popular. Live music performed by a
Mexican band that was probably around in the era of Wayne — note the
seashell-pink bass — accompanies the festivities. Even if you don’t stay
here, plan to come for a margarita at sunset and a walk along the dramatic
lookout point — not for the faint of heart!

Hotel Misión

Old Acapulco (Downtown)
If this courtyard hotel reminds you of an old monastery, it may be because
the original structure is more than a century old — truly and authentically

326

“Old Acapulco!” Rooms are located in the L-shaped building that borders
a plant-filled, brick courtyard shaded by two enormous mango trees. The
hotel’s location, on a narrow street surrounded by tiny shops, lends a dis-
tinctly different atmosphere to an Acapulco holiday here. You’re in the
center of town life just 2 blocks inland from the Costera, fishermen’s wharf,
zócalo, and La Quebrada — the site of the famous cliff divers. Playa Caleta
is about a kilometer (half-mile) away. The rooms have colonial touches,
such as colorful tile and wrought iron, and come simply furnished with a
fan (no air-conditioning here) and one or two beds with good mattresses.
Unfortunately, the promised hot water isn’t reliable — request a cold-
water-only room and receive a discount. Breakfast is served on the patio.

Hotel Sands

Costera Hotel Zone
Comfortable and unpretentious, the Hotel Sands is a great option for budget-
minded travelers. The hotel’s location on the inland side of the Costera
translates to greatly reduced prices, and the fact that it’s about a block off
the main highway means it’s far enough away from all the traffic noise to
make your nights peaceful. Still, the Hotel Sands is close enough — walking
distance — to the lively Costera Hotel Zone. From the street, you enter the
hotel lobby through a stand of umbrella palms and an attractive garden
restaurant — one that offers terrific, authentic Mexican food at rock-bottom
prices. Rooms are light and airy in the style of a good, modern motel and
have basic furnishings, wall-to-wall carpeting, and a terrace or balcony. The
bungalow units are located across the street — all have kitchenettes. Two
swimming pools (one for adults only), a kid’s playground, a volleyball court,
and complimentary coffee served in the lobby round out the features.

Hyatt Regency Acapulco
$$$$–$$$$$
Costera Hotel Zone
The Hyatt is one of the largest and most modern hotels in Acapulco and
about as sophisticated as they come here — which is still less sophisticated
than most other resorts. It’s a good choice for couples looking for a roman-
tic break or for those attending conventions (it’s close to the convention
center). Two large, free-form pools meander through tropical gardens on the
broad, golden-sand beachfront. The sleek lobby has an inviting sitting area
and bar that hosts live music every evening and boasts the largest selection
of tequilas in Acapulco. All rooms are large with sizable balconies over-
looking the pool and ocean. Regency Club guests receive special amenities.
(Note: Children aren’t allowed in Regency Club rooms.) Kitchenettes are
available in some rooms for an extra charge. Three outdoor tennis courts lit

for night play and access to a nearby gym are included with your stay,
making this hotel a good choice for travelers who prefer their vacations a
little on the active side. The Hyatt Acapulco caters to a large Jewish clien-
tele and offers a full-service kosher restaurant, an on-premises synagogue,
and a special Sabbath elevator. The hotel recently opened the “Alory Spa”
which offers personalized, professional spa and salon services.

Las Brisas
$$$$$
Las Brisas
With its hilltop views, terrace pools, and 24-hour, pampering service, the
pink-themed Las Brisas hotel is the quintessential Acapulco experience
for many Acapulco veterans. A local landmark, Las Brisas is known for its
tiered, pink-stucco facade and the 175 pink Jeeps rented exclusively to Las
Brisas guests. If you stay here, you better like pink because the color
scheme extends to practically everything. Las Brisas is also known for
inspiring romance and is best enjoyed by couples indulging in time
together — alone. Although the marble-floored rooms with mostly built-
in furnishings are simple, they are each like separate villas and offer spec-
tacular panoramic views of Acapulco Bay from the private balconies and
terraces. Each room also has a private (or semi-private) swimming pool.
(Altogether, Las Brisas boasts 250 swimming pools.) The more spacious
Regency Club rooms are located at the apex of the property and offer the
best views. You stay at Las Brisas more for the panache and setting than
for the amenities. TVs are a recent addition, but they feature volume con-
trol so you don’t disturb other guests. Early each morning, continental
breakfast arrives in a discreet cubbyhole, so your coffee is ready when you
are. Although the property isn’t located on the beach, Las Brisas offers
courtesy shuttle service to its own private beach club located five min-
utes away on the southwestern tip of Acapulco Bay. Here, freshwater and
saltwater pools, plus a large restaurant and bar — though still not much
of a real beach — compete for your attention. Five tennis courts, daily
activities, and access to a nearby gym round out the action. A mandatory
service charge takes care of the shuttle service from the hillside rooms to
the lobby and all other service tips. The hotel is located on the southern
edge of the bay overlooking the road to the airport and close to the hottest
nightclubs in town.

Villa Vera Hotel, Spa, and Racquet Club
$$$$–$$$$$
Costera Hotel Zone
Another “address of distinction” in Acapulco is the legendary Villa Vera,
which is ideal for a romantic getaway. A smaller inn with a decidedly
clubby feel to it, this property started off as a private home with adjacent
villas serving as accommodations for houseguests. After a while, it became
popular with stars such as Liz Taylor, who married Mike Todd here.
Richard M. and Pat Nixon celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary here,
and it also served as the set for much of Elvis’s film, Fun in Acapulco. The
hotel is located on a hill above the Costera Hotel Zone and offers the clos-
est experience to Acapulco villa life that you can find on a public property.
Several years ago, significant renovations and upgrades in facilities
returned Villa Vera to a standard of excellence — in the style of today’s
more popular boutique-style hotels. Rooms are large, airy, and more
sophisticated in décor than most others in Acapulco. Villa Vera offers
exceptional spa facilities as well as two clay tennis courts, two lighted rac-
quetball courts, and a small gym. The total of 14 pools includes eight pri-
vate pools for the six villas and two houses. Most of the other rooms share
pools, except for the least expensive standard rooms, which have access
to the large public pool located across from the restaurant.

Settling into Acapulco
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Knowing the scene before you arrive
 Finding transportation around town
 Reading up on all kinds of useful resources and tips
A
lthough most beach resorts have “relaxing” written all over them,
Acapulco offers visitors nonstop, 24-hour-a-day energy. With so
much to do, you won’t want to lose a minute figuring out the details, 
so this chapter guides you through the fundamentals of settling into
Acapulco. I help you get your bearings upon arrival at Acapulco’s
bustling airport, get settled into your hotel, and gain confidence in find-
ing your way around the area. Finally, I give you tips on everything from
currency exchanges to Internet access to finding the cheapest — and
most entertaining — ways to get around town.
Arriving in Acapulco
No matter the time of year or where you’re coming from, the first thing
you’re likely to notice about Acapulco when you get off the plane is the
sizzling climate. You definitely feel the heat, but most travelers quickly
adjust. Both immigration and Customs are brief, generally easy proce-
dures. Mexico’s second-most important industry is tourism, so the coun-
try’s aim is to be as welcoming as possible.
Navigating passport control and Customs
The immigration clearance area is generally a lengthy walk from the
plane’s jetway and then down a flight of stairs. When you reach immigra-
tion, an officer asks you to show your passport (or other proof of citi-
zenship) and your completed tourist card, the FMT (see Chapter 9 for all
the FMT details).

Your FMT is an important document, so take good care of it. You’re 
supposed to keep the FMT with you at all times because you may be
required to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to
turn it back in upon departure, or you may be unable to leave without
replacing it.
Next up is the baggage claim area. Here, porters stand by to help with
your bags, and they’re well worth the price of the tip — about a dollar 
a bag. After you collect your luggage, you pass through another check-
point. Something that looks like a traffic light awaits you here. You press
a button, and if the light turns green, you’re free to go. If it turns red, you
need to open your bags for a quick search. It’s Mexico’s random search
procedure for Customs. If you have an unusually large bag, or an exces-
sive amount of luggage, you may be searched regardless of the traffic-
light outcome.
Getting to your hotel
The airport is 23km (14 miles) southeast of town — over the hills east 
of Acapulco Bay. Private taxis are the fastest option to get to downtown
Acapulco. A taxi ride runs from $15 to $50 depending on your destination.
The major rental-car agencies all have booths at the airport, but I advise
against getting a car unless you determine you really want one, say, for a
side trip to Taxco (see Chapter 27) — they tend to be very expensive
and generally more troublesome than convenient.
Transportes Terrestres has desks at the front of the airport (just as you
exit the baggage-claim area) where you can buy tickets for colectivo
(shared minivan) transportation into town for $5 to $10 — rates are
preset and based on the distance to your hotel. You must reserve return
service to the airport through your hotel. Taxis to the airport tend to be
much less expensive (about half the price) than taxis from the airport
because the taxis that pick you up at the airport are federally chartered
cars with exclusive rights to airport transportation — and the associ-
ated steep fares.
Getting Around Acapulco
Acapulco stretches for more than 6km (4 miles) around the huge bay.
The most popular tourist areas are divided roughly into three sections:
Acapulco Viejo (Old Acapulco); the Costera Hotel Zone, which follows
the main boulevard, Costera Miguel Alemán (or just “the Costera”); and
the southern shore, whose exclusive neighborhoods border the scenic
highway (Carretera Escénica) between the airport and the International
Center.
Chapter 25: Settling into Acapulco 331

Street names and numbers in Acapulco can be confusing and hard to
find — many streets either aren’t well marked or change names unex-
pectedly. Fortunately, you’ll seldom have any reason to stray far from
the Costera, so getting lost is difficult. But remember that street num-
bers on the Costera don’t follow a logical order; you can’t assume that
similar numbers are necessarily close together.
Taking a taxi
Taxis, which are more plentiful than tacos in Acapulco (and practically
as inexpensive if you’re traveling in the downtown area only), are the
best way to get around here.
Significant differences in prices for different types of taxis are common,
so always establish the price with the driver before starting out. Hotel
taxis may charge three times the rate of a taxi hailed on the street, and
nighttime taxi rides cost extra, too. Taxis are also more expensive if
you’re staying in the Punta Diamante neighborhood, south of Las Brisas,
which includes Puerto Marqués — these areas are along the southern
highway (Carretera Escénica), between town and the airport. The mini-
mum fare is $2 per ride for a roving VW bug–style taxi in town. The fare
from Puerto Marqués costs $8 to the Hotel Zone and $10 into downtown.
Sitio taxis are nicer cars, but they’re also more expensive with a $4 mini-
mum fare.
Acapulco’s taxi fashion demands that drivers decorate their cars with
flashy, Las Vegas–style neon lights — the more colorful and pulsating,
the better. It almost appears to be a local competition. And there’s no
extra charge for the added embellishments. These decked-out rides are
especially popular in Old Acapulco.
Catching a bus
Buses are another great option for traveling along the Costera — they’re
easy to use and inexpensive. Two kinds of buses run along this main
drag: pastel, color-coded buses and regular “school buses.” The differ-
ence is in the price: The newer, air-conditioned, color-coded, tourist
buses (Aca Tur Bus) cost 50¢; the older “school buses” cost 35¢.
Covered bus stops, with handy maps on the walls showing bus routes to
major sights and hotels, are located all along the Costera. If you want 
to go downtown from the Costera, take the bus marked “Centro” or
“Zócalo”; to get to the southeast side (the Punta Diamante area), take a
bus marked “Base” (pronounced bah-seh). Buses traveling these popular
routes come along at least every ten minutes. Buses also head out to
more distant destinations such as Puerto Marqués to the east (marked
“Puerto Marqués-Basa”) and Pie de la Cuesta to the northwest (marked
“Zócalo-Pie de la Cuesta”). Be sure to verify the time and place of the
last bus back if you hop on along one of these routes.

American Express
The main office (Av. Costera Miguel Alemán
121, Hotel Continental Emporio, Local 31; 
% 744-435-2200) is open Monday to Friday
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Area Code
The local telephone area code is 744.
Baby Sitters
Though most of the larger hotels can easily
arrange for them, many baby sitters speak
limited English. Rates range from $4 to $10
per hour with an additional charge of about
$5 for a taxi for the sitter if you stay out past
10 p.m.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Numerous banks are located along the
Costera and are open Monday to Friday 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 
1:30 p.m. Banks, and their ATMs, generally
have the best exchange rates. Casas de
cambio (currency exchange booths) along
the street may have better exchange rates
than hotels, and they’re open late. Most
establishments accept U.S. dollars as read-
ily as pesos but at reduced exchange rates,
so you’re better off using local currency
whenever possible.
Climate
Acapulco boasts sunshine 360 days a year
and an average daytime temperature of
80°F (27°C). Humidity levels vary. Acapulco
receives approximately 59 inches of rain
per year — June through October is the
rainy season, although July and August are
relatively dry. Tropical showers are brief
and usually occur at night.
Consular Agents
The U.S. Consular Agency office is at the
Hotel Club del Sol on Costera Alemán at
Reyes Católicos (% 744-469-0556), across
from the Hotel Acapulco Plaza. The office 
is open Monday to Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The Canadian Consulate (Centro Comercial
Marbella, Local 23; % 01-800-706-2900 toll-
free emergency number inside Mexico, or
744-484-1305) is open Monday to Friday 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Hospitals
Hospital Magallanes (Av. Wilfrido Massieu
2, on the corner with Colón, 1 block from the
Costera; % 744-485-6194 or 485-6197) has
an English-speaking staff and doctors. 
Information
The State of Guerrero Tourism Office
(%/fax 744-484-4583 or 484-4416) operates
the Procuraduría del Turista on the street
level in front of the International Center, a
convention center set back from Costera
Miguel Alemán. (It’s down a lengthy walk-
way with fountains.) The office offers maps
and information about the city and state as
well as police assistance for tourists; it’s
open daily 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Chapter 25: Settling into Acapulco 333
Renting a car
Rental cars are available at the airport and at hotel desks along the
Costera, but I don’t recommend one — they’re expensive, and parking is
hard to find. Unless you plan on exploring outlying areas, you’re better
off taking taxis or using the easy and inexpensive public buses. Besides,
leaving the driving to someone else is much easier.
Fast Facts: Acapulco

Internet Access
A number of small Internet-access services
are located along the Costera, but they
seem to go out of business quickly. Internet
access kiosks are available inside Wal-
Mart, Costera Miguel Alemán 500 (% 744-
469-0203), with varying rates depending on
usage. Or you can try Acanet, Av. Cuatemoc
1632 Centro Commercial Monte Blanco,
Local 2, in front of Papagayo Park, across
from City Hall (Presidencia; % 744-486-
1803 or 486-2343); it’s open Monday to
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Internet
access costs $1 per hour. This is a com-
puter shop that also offers Internet access
and has a very helpful staff.
Maps
One of the best around is the free American
Express map, usually found at tourist infor-
mation offices and hotel concierge desks.
Sanborn’s or Wal-Mart may also have more
detailed maps for sale.
Newspapers and Magazines
The larger Costera hotels generally carry a
good selection of English-language news-
papers (such as USA Today) and magazines
in their gift shops, as well as the English-
language Mexico City News. You can also
find English-language paperbacks and
magazines at Sanborn’s department stores
(Costera Miguel Alemán 209, downtown
across from the ship docks, % 744-482-
6167; Costera Miguel Alemán 1226, in the
Estrella Condo Tower, % 744-484-4465; and
Costera Miguel Alemán 163, at the Hotel
Calinda, % 744-481-2426).
Pharmacy
One of the largest drugstores in town is
Farmacia Daisy (% 744-481-2635). The
Sam’s Club and Wal-Mart (open 24 hr.) 
are both located on the Costera and have
pharmacy services and lower prices on
medicines.
Police
Policemen in white and light-blue uni-
forms belong to a special corps of English-
speaking police established to assist
tourists. For the main police department,
call % 744-485-0650.
Post Office
The central post office (correo) is located
next door to Sears (close to the Fideicomiso
office). Other branches are located in the
Estrella de Oro bus station on Cuauhtémoc,
inland from the Acapulco Qualton Hotel,
and on the Costera near Playa Caleta.
Safety
Riptides claim a few lives here every year,
so pay close attention to warning flags
posted on Acapulco beaches. Red or 
black flags mean stay out of the water,
yellow flags signify caution, and white or
green flags mean it’s safe to swim.
As is the case anywhere, tourists are vul-
nerable to thieves, which is especially true
when shopping in a market; lying on the
beach; wearing jewelry; or visibly carrying
a camera, purse, or bulging wallet.
Taxes
There’s a 15 percent value-added tax (IVA)
on goods and services, and it’s generally
included in the posted price.
Taxis
Always establish the price of a trip with the
driver before starting out. Hotel taxis charge
more than a taxi hailed on the street, and
nighttime taxi rides cost extra, too. The mini-
mum fare is $3 per ride for a roving VW
bug–style taxi in town. The fare from Puerto
Marqués costs $10 to the Hotel Zone and
$12 into downtown. Sitio taxis are nicer
cars, but they’re also more expensive — 
$4 minimum fare.
Part VII: Acapulco

Telephone
Phone numbers seem to change frequently
in Acapulco — the most reliable source for
telephone numbers is the Procuraduría del
Turista (% 744-484-4583) where an excep-
tionally friendly staff can help you locate
what you need. Avoid the phone booths that
have signs in English advising you to call
home using a special 800 number — these
are absolute rip-offs and can cost as much
as $20 per minute. The least expensive way
to call is by using a Telmex (LADATEL) 
prepaid phone card, available at most 
pharmacies and mini-supers, using the offi-
cial Telmex (Lada) public phones.
In Mexico, you need to dial 001 prior to a
number to reach the United States, and you
need to preface long distance calls within
Mexico by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Acapulco operates on central standard
time, but Mexico’s observance of daylight
saving time varies somewhat from that in
the United States.

Dining in Acapulco
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Discovering Acapulco’s best restaurants
 Finding the best Mexican cuisine in Acapulco
B
eing the cosmopolitan city that it is, Acapulco offers world-class
international cuisine, much of it served in the romantic restaurants
located along the southern coast. The quintessential Acapulco dining
experience is sitting at a candlelit table with a view of the glittering bay
spread out before you. If, however, you’re looking for simple, good food
or an authentic, local dining experience, you’re best off checking out the
scene in Old Acapulco. Being a beach town, Acapulco restaurants serve
up a ton of fresh seafood. My personal Acapulco favorites include a
small place that specializes in fish tacos.
Despite the growing profusion of American-influenced chain restaurants,
resist the temptation to go with what you know — trust me, the locally
owned restaurants offer the best food and best value.
And, although most of Mexico’s beach resorts fall on the casual side
when it comes to dress, Acapulco goes against the trend, especially for
women. Feel free to go all out with your sexy resort wear when dining
here. Also note that dinner tends to be a late affair. Most Acapulco regu-
lars wouldn’t think of dining before 10 p.m. so that they can finish up
just in time to hit the clubs, which open at midnight.
You can find American standards such as McDonald’s, Tony Roma’s,
Burger King, and Hard Rock Cafe — good choices if you’re traveling with
kids — but you may also want to try the Mexican alternatives of Carlos ’n
Charlie’s and 100% Natural, both located along the Costera.
If you’re visiting Acapulco on a Thursday, indulge in the local custom of
eating pozole, a bowl of white hominy and meat in a broth garnished
with sliced radishes, shredded lettuce, onions, oregano, and lime. The
truly traditional version is served with pork, but a newer chicken ver-
sion has also become a standard. You can also find green pozole, which

is made by adding a paste of roasted pumpkin seeds to the traditional
pozole base, giving the broth its green color. For a uniquely Acapulco
experience, enjoy your Thursday pozole at the cliff-side restaurant of the
Hotel Los Flamingos.
Acapulco’s Best Restaurants
All the restaurants included in this chapter are arranged alphabetically
with their location and general price category noted. Remember that
tips generally run about 15 percent, and most wait-staff really depend 
on tips for their income, so be generous if the service warrants. See the
Introduction of this book for an explanation of the price categories.

over-the-top dining experience. You enter from the street, and then
descend a spiral staircase into the stunning bar and restaurant, awash in
muted tan and cream colors of luxurious fabrics and natural accents of
stone, wood, and water. The restaurant itself is constructed into the cliff,
providing sweeping views of Acapulco Bay’s glittering lights. The large
dining room, with a two-story ceiling, has comfortable seating, including
sofas that border the room. The creative menu combines traditional
French and Asian fare, and then adds a dash of Mexican flare. Start with the
scallops in chipotle vinaigrette, or the black bean soup with duck foie gras.
Notable entrees include steamed red snapper with lobster butter sauce,
chicken breast rolled and stuffed with asparagus in a white wine reduc-
tion, or medallions of New Zealand lamb in a sweet garlic sauce. The serv-
ice is as impeccable as the presentation. You can also choose from an
extensive selection of wines, as well as enjoy live jazz and bossa nova
music nightly. Periodically during the evening, large projector screens
descend over the floor-to-ceiling glass windows, and show short films of
old Acapulco or cavorting whales and dolphins, providing a brief reprise
from conversation and dining. A fashionably late dining spot (expect a
crowd at midnight), the attire is chic resort wear, because most patrons
are headed to the clubs following dinner. Baikal also has wheelchair
access, a private VIP dining room, and a wine cellar, as well as an ample
bar, ideal for enjoying a sunset cocktail or after-dinner drink. It’s located
east of town on the scenic highway just before the entrance to the Las
Brisas hotel.

Casa Nova
$$–$$$
Las Brisas
GOURMET ITALIAN
This long-standing favorite of Mexico City’s elite is easily one of Acapulco’s
top spots for a romantic evening, and one of the cliff-side restaurants
noted for its food as much as for its view. Enjoy an elegant meal and a fab-
ulous view of glittering Acapulco Bay at this restaurant located east of
town on the scenic highway just before the entrance to the Las Brisas
hotel. You can dine in one of several elegantly appointed dining rooms
awash in marble and stunning murals or outdoors on the terrace that fea-
tures a dramatic view. The crowd here is generally decked out in fashion-
able resort attire, and the peak dining hour is 10 p.m. Notable dishes
include veal scaloppini and homemade pastas, such as linguini with fresh
clams. The service is stellar, and a changing tourist menu offers a sampling
of the best selections for a fixed price. You can also enjoy an ample selec-
tion of reasonably priced national and imported wines as well as live piano
music nightly.
Carretera Escénica 5256. % 744-446-6237, -6238, or -6239. Reservations required.
Main courses: $28–$50; $39 fixed-price four-course meal. AE, MC, V. Open: Daily
7–11:30 p.m.
El Amigo Miguel
$–$$
Old Acapulco
MEXICAN/SEAFOOD
The ever-present crowd of locals is a sure sign that El Amigo Miguel, 
3 blocks west of the zócalo, is a standout among Acapulco seafood 
restaurants — you can easily pay more elsewhere and not eat better.
Impeccably fresh seafood reigns here, and the large, open-air dining room
is usually brimming with seafood lovers. When it overflows, head to a
second branch with the exact same menu across the street. Dining at El
Amigo Miguel is a casual way to enjoy the best of the bay’s bounty. Try the
delicious camarones borrachos (drunken shrimp) in a sauce made with
beer, applesauce, ketchup, mustard, and bits of fresh bacon — the ingre-
dients may not sound great when listed individually, but trust me, this stuff
is heaven. The filete Miguel is red-snapper filet stuffed with seafood and
covered in a wonderful chipotle-pepper sauce. Mojo de ajo (grilled shrimp
with garlic) and whole red snapper are also served at their classic best.
Juárez 31, at Azueta. % 744-483-6981. Reservations not accepted. Main courses:
$2.70–$20. AE, MC, V. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–11 p.m.
El Cabrito
$
Costera
NORTHERN MEXICAN
A hacienda-inspired facade marks the entrance to this popular joint
located in the heart of the Costera. El Cabrito is known for its authentic
and well-prepared northern Mexican cuisine. Although the décor appears
to shout “tourist trap,” this restaurant enjoys a strong reputation among
Mexican nationals as well. Among the specialties are cabrito al pastor
(roasted goat), charro beans (a dish made with pinto beans), Oaxaca-style
mole (a complex sauce that uses a variety of ingredients ranging from
Part VII: Acapulco

chocolate to chiles — there are red, yellow, green, and black moles), and
burritos de machaca.
Costera Miguel Alemán 1480, on the ocean side of the Costera opposite of Hard Rock
Cafe. % 744-484-7711. Reservations not accepted. Main courses: $5–$15. AE, MC, V.
Open: Mon–Sat 2 p.m.–1 a.m.; Sun 1–11 p.m.
El Olvido
$–$$$
Costera
MEXICANA
This stylish restaurant tucked in a shopping mall gives you all the glitter-
ing bay-view ambience of the posh Las Brisas restaurants without the taxi
ride from the Costera hotels. The menu is one of the city’s most sophisti-
cated. Each dish is a delight in both presentation and taste — truly some
of the finest “new-style” Mexican cuisine in the country. Start with one of
the 12 house specialty drinks such as Olvido — made with tequila, rum,
Cointreau, tomato juice, and lime juice. Soups include a delicious cold
melon and a thick, black bean and sausage. Among the innovative entrees
are quail with honey and pasilla chiles and thick sea bass with a mild sauce
of cilantro and avocado. For dessert, try the chocolate fondue or the gua-
nabana (a tropical fruit) mousse in a rich zapote negro (black-colored trop-
ical fruit) sauce. El Olvido is in the Plaza Marbella shopping center on
Diana Circle. Aca Joe clothing store fronts the plaza. Walk into the passage
to the right of Aca Joe and head left; it’s in the back.
Plaza Marbella, at the Diana Glorieta (Circle). % 744-481-0203 or 481-0256.
Reservations recommended. Main courses: $14–$30. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily 
6 p.m.–2 a.m.
Ika Tako
$
Costera
SEAFOOD/TACOS
This is my favorite place to eat in Acapulco, and I never miss it when I’m
in town. Perhaps I have simple tastes, but these fresh fish, shrimp, and
seafood tacos served in combinations that include grilled pineapple, fresh
spinach, grated cheese, garlic, and bacon are addictive. Unlike most inex-
pensive eateries, the setting here is lovely — a handful of tables overlook
tropical trees and the bay below. The lighting may be a bit bright, the
atmosphere occasionally hectic, and the service dependably slow, but the
tacos are delectable. You can also get beer, wine, soft drinks, and a dessert
of the day. This restaurant is located along the Costera, next to Beto’s lob-
ster restaurant. A second branch of Ika Tako sits across from the Hyatt
Regency hotel, but it lacks the atmosphere of this location.

including ceviche, lobster, octopus, crayfish, and baby-shark quesadillas.
This local favorite is 2 blocks west of the zócalo on Breton, just off the
Costera. Another branch (% 744-484-0165), open daily 1 to 9:30 p.m., is at
Costera Miguel Alemán and Canadá, across from the convention center.

Mezzanotte Acapulco 
$$–$$$
Las Brisas
ITALIAN/FRENCH/MEXICAN
Mezzanotte offers a contemporary blending of classic cuisines, but its
strongest asset is the view of the bay. This location has changed hands
several times; it currently offers a mix of trendy international dishes
served in an atmosphere that tries a bit too hard to be upscale and fash-
ionable. Music is loud and hip, so if you’re looking for a romantic evening,
this is probably not the place. It’s a better choice if you want a taste of
Mexican urban chic. The view of the bay remains outstanding, though the
food still strives for consistency. Dress up a bit for dining here. Mezzanotte
is in the La Vista complex near the Las Brisas hotel.
Plaza La Vista, Carretera Escénica a Puerto Márquez 28–2. % 744-446-5727 or -5728.
Reservations required. Main courses: $20–$35. AE, MC, V. Open: Daily 6:30pm–mid-
night. Closed Mon during low season.
Mi Parri Pollo

Old Acapulco
MEXICAN/INTERNATIONAL
Umbrella-covered tables on one of the coolest and shadiest sections of the
zócalo comprise this tiny and typically Mexican restaurant. It’s especially
popular for breakfast with specials that include coffee refills and a great
fresh-fruit salad with mango, pineapple, and cantaloupe. Other specials
include fish burgers, tortas, a special rotisserie-grilled chicken, and steak
Milanesa. Fruit drinks, including fresh mango juice, come in schooner-size
glasses. To find the restaurant, enter the zócalo from the Costera and walk
toward the kiosk. On the right, about midway into the zócalo, is a wide,
shady passageway that leads onto Avenida Jesús Carranza and to the
umbrella-covered tables under the shady tree.

Especially notable are the fruit licuados, blended fresh fruit and your
choice of purified water or milk. Yogurt shakes, steamed vegetables, and

whole grain breads. If you’ve over-indulged the night before, get yourself
back on track here. It’s also a great place for families.

A comfortable setting, terrific food, and moderate prices are what you get
at Su Casa. Owners Shelly and Angel Herrera created this pleasant and
breezy open-air restaurant on the patio of their hillside home overlooking
the city. Both are experts in the kitchen and stay on hand nightly to greet
guests on the patio. The menu changes often, so each time you go there’s
something new to try. But some items are standard — shrimp a la patrona
in garlic; grilled fish, steak, and chicken; and flaming fillet al Madrazo, a
delightful brochette marinated in tropical juices. Most entrees come gar-
nished with cooked banana or pineapple. The margaritas are big and deli-
cious. Su Casa is the hot-pink building on the hillside above the convention
center.

Having Fun on and off the
Beach in Acapulco

 Checking out the sights and shops
 Visiting Taxco
 Partying like you’re in Acapulco
A
capulco’s beaches aren’t all created equal, and knowing that sun
and sand are a key part of any vacation here, I use this chapter 
to guide you to the areas that are best for watersports and safest for
swimming — and I throw in a few out-of-the-way recreational finds.
In and out of the water, Acapulco features a wealth of activities to do and
see, so I point out the top attractions. Though the town is lacking in true
cultural options, I’ve found a few hidden gems that I reveal in this chapter.
And then there’s the nightlife! Oh, the nightlife! I wrap up this chapter
with a guide of the top clubs in town, giving you a rundown of the typi-
cal crowd and type of action you’re likely to encounter in each location.
This info can help you pick a spot that best meets your tastes — without
having to cough up a bunch of cover charges just to find the right scene.
Hitting the Beaches
Acapulco Bay is a stunning sight — night or day — that practically cries
out in temptation. But, before I dive into the best beaches, I have a few
words of wisdom.
Acapulco’s golden beaches, cobalt-blue bay, and sun-soaked climate
lured so many people here that, by the late 1970s, Acapulco became a
victim of its own success. Beaches began to lose their luster as waves of

garbage and pollution started coming in with the tides. As the numbers
of visitors sharply declined, authorities took notice, and over the past
decade, the city has gone to great lengths (and great expense) to clean
up the waters of its beautiful bay. Despite the notable success of these
efforts, it still pays to be cautious in some areas. (Acapulco is an active,
industrial port.) You may also notice the fleet of more than 20 power-
sweeper boats that skim the top of the bay each morning to remove any
debris or oil film or . . . 
The tides in the area can be treacherous, especially in the open ocean
north and south of Acapulco Bay. Each year, at least one or two unwary
swimmers drown in the area because of the deadly riptides and under-
tow, so heed any posted warnings — red or black flags mean stay out 
of the water altogether, and yellow warns you to exercise caution. The
safest swimming is in either Acapulco Bay or Puerto Marqués Bay.
I’m glad I got that off of my chest; now I can tell you about the best
places to play. In the old days, the downtown beaches were the focal
point of Acapulco, but today, the resort developments stretch along the
entire length of the shore. The beaches and coves tucked into Acapulco
Bay go by as many as 50 different names, but I just focus on the best and
most popular beaches from west to east.
Located 13km (8 miles) west of Acapulco Bay is Pie de la Cuesta.
Traveling by taxi or car (this is the one time you may want to consider
renting a car) is the best way to reach this beach because it’s much
faster than taking the bus. However, buses run regularly along the
Costera, leaving every five or ten minutes. A taxi costs about $22. The
water here is too rough for swimming, but it’s a great spot for checking
out big waves and the spectacular sunset — especially over coco locos
(drinks served in a fresh coconut with the top whacked off) at one of the
rustic beachfront restaurants hung with hammocks. The area is known
for excellent bird-watching and the surrounding coconut plantations.
Heading on the road northwest, beyond the bay, along the Pacific coast-
line, you come to Coyuca Lagoon on your right. Colectivo boat tours —
or small boats that band together a group of people to comprise a 
tour — of the lagoon are offered for about $10.
Back toward Acapulco, around the area near La Quebrada (where the
cliff divers perform), is Playa La Angosta, a small, sheltered, and often-
deserted cove. If you’re staying in Old Acapulco, this beach is great not
only for its location, but also because it’s much less crowded than public
beaches in Old Acapulco, and much more dramatic in its setting —
though generally too rough for swimming.
South of downtown on the Peninsula de las Playas lie Caleta and
Caletilla; the image I hold in my mind of these sister beaches is one of
bright colors, and plenty of laughter, kids, and an almost carnival-like
atmosphere. A small outcropping of land that contains an aquarium and

water park, Mágico Mundo Marino (open daily 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; % 744-
483-1215), separates the two beaches. In this area, you find thatched-
roofed restaurants, watersports equipment for rent, and brightly painted
boats that ferry passengers to Isla de la Roqueta. You can also rent
beach chairs and umbrellas for the day. Mexican families favor these
beaches because they’re close to several inexpensive hotels. In the late
afternoon, fishermen pull their colorful boats up on the sand; you can
buy the fresh catch of the day and, occasionally, oysters on the half
shell.
Speaking of Isla de la Roqueta, this island has two small beaches amidst
a hilly, forested terrain. Playa Marin is the more deserted of the two.
Playa Roqueta has thatched-roof restaurants where you can enjoy a
snack and a cold beer or rent snorkeling equipment. The island also has
a small zoo of exotic animals kept in pitifully small cages — I kindly ask
you to boycott it in the hope that these poor creatures will one day be
released. You can get here via one of the panga boats (small, open-air
fishing boats) departing from Playa Caletilla. The boat rides cost about
$5 round-trip and depart about every 20 minutes from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
daily. You can purchase tickets directly from any boat that’s loading.
You need to remember the name of Playa Manzanillo if you’re planning
to set out on a pleasure-boat excursion — including chartered fishing
trips. This beach is where they dock. It’s located just south of the zócalo
(Acapulco’s central plaza).
East of the zócalo, the major beaches are Hornos (near Papagayo Park
and sometimes referred to as Playa Papagayo), Hornitos, Condesa, and
Icacos, which merge one into the other. Icacos is the beach just beyond
the Hyatt Hotel. Of the four beaches, it’s closest to the naval base (La
Base), which is directly opposite the bay from the zócalo. All these
strips of sand are wide, and the surf is gentle, but I remain cautious
about swimming along this interior curve of Acapulco Bay — based on
my concerns about water cleanliness. Of these beaches, Condesa is the
liveliest with watersports equipment for rent and a regular crowd of
beach babes of both sexes.
As you travel around the bay, down the Costera to the Scenic Highway
(Carretera Escénica), and past the legendary Las Brisas hotel, the road
continues to Playa Puerto Marqués, located in the small, clean, and 
separate bay of Puerto Marqués. It’s my top choice for beach swimming
in Acapulco, and one key reason for staying at the Camino Real (see
Chapter 24). The water is calm, and the bay is sheltered, meaning the
water quality here is much better than in Acapulco Bay, and it’s a great
place for water-skiing — rentals are generally available. A row of palapa-
topped (thatched-roof), beachfront restaurants draws a sizable crowd
every weekend, so arrive early; better yet, come during a weekday.
Past the bay lies Playa Revolcadero, a magnificent wide stretch of
beach on the open ocean where you can find many of Acapulco’s 
Part VII: Acapulco 
348

grandest resorts — including the Acapulco Princess, Mayan Palace, and
Pierre Marqués. About 6km (4 miles) farther south lies Barra Vieja, a
lovely, wide beach with firm sand (ideal for running on the beach) — but
also strong waves. Tres Palos Lagoon, a fascinating freshwater jungle
lagoon, is nearby. You can hire a boat for about $15 to take you around
these wetlands, which are at the east end of the fishing village that
adjoins Barra Vieja.
Finding Water Fun for Everyone
It seems like you can find more ways to have fun in Acapulco in the
water than out of it — after all, this resort grew up around the bay.
Whether it’s plowing through the surf on a Jet Ski or diving below the
surface, if you can do it in the water, you can find it in Acapulco!
Skiing and surfing
Acapulco watersports tend to lean toward the motorized variety — the
louder the engine, the better the fun. In Acapulco’s heyday, images of
bronzed, muscled water-skiers were commonplace, and today, this sport
remains as popular during the day as dancing is at night. An hour of
water-skiing can cost as little as $35 or as much as $65. Boats and rental
equipment are available at Playa Caletilla, Puerto Marqués Bay, and
Coyuca Lagoon. You can also check out the Club de Esquís (Costera
Miguel Alemán 100; % 744-482-2034); water-skiing rates run $50 per
hour here.
You can find concessions for other watersports equipment on the
beaches fronting the Costera hotels — most notably the Qualton Club,
Acapulco Plaza, Fiesta Americana, and Hyatt hotels. Banana boats ($5
per person for about 15 min.), parasail rides (about $30 for the longest
10 min. of your life), and Jet Skis ($50 per hour) are usually available.
Although these concessions are also available at Playa Caletilla and
Coyuca Lagoon near Pie de la Cuesta, the equipment tends to be in
better shape along the Costera hotel beaches.
The mother of all motorized watersports in Acapulco is, without a doubt,
the Shotover Jet. These 12-person, soft-sided boats careen down the oth-
erwise tranquil Laguna Puerto Marqués propelled by 8-liter, V-8 engines.
You travel at speeds of 65 to 80kmph (40–50 mph) and make 360-degree
turns, so the ride is a thrill. Book these trips directly through the Shotover
Jet office (Costera Miguel Alemán 121, in front of the Continental Plaza
Hotel; % 744-484-1154; www.shotoverjet-acapulco.com). Tickets cost
$44 for adults and $22 for children and include round-trip transportation
from this departure point to the lagoon.
The Shotover Jet ride is a four-hour excursion, door-to-door. Be sure to
bring a change of dry clothes — you’ll get wet on this trip.
Chapter 27: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Acapulco 349

Exploring the deep blue
Scuba diving isn’t as brilliant in Acapulco as it is in other parts of Mexico
(the problems with pollution have resulted in fewer fish and less sea
life), so it may disappoint. But, as an avid diver, I always say that there’s
no such thing as a bad dive. For novice divers, or those needing a
refresher course, you can expect to pay $30 for 90 minutes of instruction
if you book directly with an instructor on Playa Caleta. One dive opera-
tor I recommend is Divers de México (% 744-482-1398), located at
Costera Miguel Alemán 100, near Club de Esquis. Typical prices are
about $55 per person for equipment, a dive guide, and a boat for three
hours. The best snorkeling sites are off Isla de la Roqueta. You can rent
gear at a concession on the island, or you can take one of the regularly
scheduled snorkeling trips from Playa Caleta to the island, which costs
about $20 for two hours, including equipment.
Reeling in the big one
For deep-sea fishing excursions, go to the pale-pink building housing the
fishing-boat cooperative Pesca Deportiva opposite the zócalo or book a
day in advance (% 744-482-1099). Charter fishing trips run from $150 to
$200 for up to four people for six hours, tackle and bait included. Credit
cards are accepted, and ice, drinks, lunch, and a fishing license (about
$10) are extra. You can usually swing a better deal by paying cash.
Generally, boats leave at 8 a.m. and return by 3 p.m. and travel anywhere
from 5km to 16km (3–10 miles) offshore. Sailfish, marlin, and tuna are
popular catches. If you book through a travel agent or hotel, fishing trips
start at around $200 to $280 for four people, and again, fishing license,
food, and drinks cost extra.
If you’re into planning ahead, consider booking with either of these reli-
able sportfishing outfitters: Ixtapa Sportfishing Charters (19 Depue
Lane, Stroudsburg, PA 18360; % 570-688-9466; Fax: 570-688-9554;
www.ixtapasportfishing.com/acapulco) and Fish-R-Us (Costera
Miguel Alemán 100; % 877-3-FISH-R-US in the U.S., or 744-482-8282;
www.fish-r-us.com). Their boats range in size from 12m to 14m (40- to
48-ft.) custom cruisers and are priced from $291 to $520 for up to eight
people, including crew, tackle, and taxes.
Finding family fun
One of the best options for family fun is the CICI water park (Centro
Internacional de Convivencia Infantil; Costera Miguel Alemán at Colón;
% 744-484-8033). Located just east of the convention center, the park
has swimming pools with waves, water slides, water toboggans, and sea-
life shows. The park is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. with dolphin shows
(in Spanish) taking place at noon, 2:30, and 5 p.m. A dolphin swim pro-
gram includes 30 minutes of introduction and 30 minutes of swim time,
for an additional $95. Swim times are at 10 a.m. and 12:30 and 4 p.m.
Reservations are required, with a ten-person maximum per swim for the
Part VII: Acapulco 
350

dolphin swim option. CICI, which recently underwent a $3-million reno-
vation, also has a snack bar and restrooms. General admission is $6
during weekdays, and $8 on weekends; children under 2 are admitted
free.
Cruising Acapulco’s shores
Although a booze cruise may not technically qualify as a watersport
(even though it requires extensive repetitions of the one-arm cocktail
curl), I’ll go out on a limb: Because the activity takes place on the 
water, it counts in my book. A booze cruise is one of the most popular
ways to spend a day — or evening — in Acapulco, and the options are
numerous. Choose from yachts, catamarans, and trimarans (single- and
double-deckers) to take in the sun (and a few beverages) and enjoy
expansive views of the bay. Cruises run morning, afternoon, and evening,
and some offer buffets, open bars, and live music; others just have
snacks, selected drinks, and taped music. You notice a difference in
prices, too, which can range from $15 to $50. Your hotel’s tour desk or
any Acapulco travel agency can explain the current options, as well as
provide brochures or recommendations.
Enjoying Land Sports
Acapulco has a number of ways to spend the day on land. From golf to
tennis to horseback riding, you’re sure to find an activity — or two — to
suit your interests.
Teeing off
If you aim to hit the links during your stay, the best golf is at the courses
at Playa Revolcadero. Both the Acapulco Princess (% 744-469-1000)
and Pierre Marqués (% 744-466-1000) hotels have top-notch courses.
The Princess’s course is a rather narrow, level, Ted Robinson design.
The Marqués course, redesigned by Robert Trent Jones, Sr., in 1972 for
the World Cup of Golf tournament, is longer and more challenging. A
round of 18 holes at either course costs $125 for guests and $145 for
non-guests; American Express, Visa, and MasterCard are accepted. 
Tee-times begin at 7:35 a.m. Make your reservations a day in advance.
Club rental is available, and costs an extra $21. The Mayan Palace Golf
Club (Geranios 22; % 744-466-2260 and 469-6043), designed by Latin
American golf great Pedro Guericia, lies farther east. Greens fees are
$115, and caddies are available for an additional $15.
The newest addition to Acapulco’s golf scene is the spectacular Robert
von Hagge–designed course at the exclusive Tres Vidas Golf Club,
Carretera a Barra Vieja Km 7 (% 744-444-5138). The par-72, 18-hole
course, right on the edge of the ocean, is landscaped with nine lakes,
dotted with palms, and home to a flock of ducks and other birds. The
club is open only to members, guests of members, and guests of certain
Chapter 27: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Acapulco 351

hotels that have play privileges at the club. Greens fees are $144, including
cart; a caddy costs $20. You can also enjoy a clubhouse with a restaurant,
open from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., as well as a pool and beach club.
American Express, Visa, and MasterCard are accepted.
The main public course in town is the Club de Golf Acapulco (% 744-
484-0781), located off the Costera next to the convention center. You can
play nine holes for $40 and 18 holes for $60, with equipment renting for
$16. There are no carts, but caddies are available for about $14. The
course isn’t very well maintained.
Taking time for tennis
Tennis is vastly more popular in Acapulco than golf, and getting a game
going is a fairly easy process. You can choose from several public tennis
clubs — court time averages about $11 an hour. One option is the Club
de Tenis Hyatt (Costera Miguel Alemán 1; % 744-484-1225), which is
open daily 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Outdoor courts cost $15 an hour during
the day and $22 per hour at night; the indoor courts cost $25. Rackets
rent for $4, and a set of balls will set you back $3.50 Many of the hotels
along the Costera have tennis facilities for their guests; the best are at
the Acapulco Princess, Pierre Marqués, and Las Brisas hotels.
Galloping along
If you’re not entirely comfortable swimming in Acapulco Bay, then try
horseback riding along the beach. Independent operators stroll the
Hotel Zone beachfront offering rides for about $20 to $40 for one to two
hours. Horses for riding are also commonly found on the beach in front
of the Acapulco Princess Hotel. There’s no phone; you have to go
directly to one of the beaches to make arrangements.
Experiencing Acapulco’s Front Row Attractions
Traditionally called Fiesta Brava, bullfights are held during Acapulco’s
winter season at a ring (Plaza de Toros) up the hill from Playa Caletilla.
Tickets purchased through travel agencies cost around $35 and usually
include transportation to and from your hotel. The festivities begin at
5:30 p.m. each Sunday from December to March. Although bullfights in
Acapulco tend to feature better matadors than those in other Mexican
resort towns, you’re still seeing amateur or up-and-coming matadors
rather than the real pros who practice this sport in Mexico City.
The must-see spectacle in Acapulco is the renowned cliff divers. High
divers perform at La Quebrada each day at 12:30, 7:15, 8:15, 9:15, and
10:15 p.m. for a $2.50 admission. From a spotlighted ledge on the cliffs,
divers (holding torches for the final performance) plunge into the roar-
ing surf 39m (130 ft.) below — after wisely praying at a small shrine
nearby. To the applause of the crowd, divers climb up the rocks and
accept congratulations and cash tips from onlookers. This is the 
Part VII: Acapulco 
352

essential Acapulco experience, and no visit here is complete without
watching these death-defying divers — this goes for jaded travelers 
as well.
The public areas have great views, but arrive early because all perform-
ances quickly fill up. Another option is to watch from the lobby bar and
restaurant terraces of the Hotel El Mirador (% 744-483-1155). At the
bar, you have to pay an $18 cover charge, which includes two drinks.
Reservations are recommended during the high season. The best way 
to reach La Quebrada is by taxi. It’s located uphill from Avenida López, 
3 blocks west of the zócalo.
Sightseeing in Acapulco
Acapulco is best known for its beaches and bay, and sadly, few visitors
bother to explore its traditional downtown area. But a trip to the shady
zócalo (also called Plaza Alvarez) is an experience that offers a true
glimpse of local life and color. Inexpensive cafes and shops border the
plaza, and the cathedral Nuestra Señora de la Soledad — with its blue,
onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers — is at the north end.
Though reminiscent of a Russian Orthodox church, the structure was
originally built as a movie set and then later adapted for use as a house
of worship. Take a taxi up to the top of the hill from the main plaza and
follow the signs leading to El Mirador (lookout point) for an unparal-
leled view of Acapulco.
Of all the exclusive villas and homes in Acapulco, one stands far apart
from the others. Though not as elegantly impressive as the villas of Las
Brisas, the home of Dolores Olmedo in Acapulco’s traditional down-
town area is a veritable work of art. In 1956, the renowned Mexican artist
Diego Rivera covered its outside wall with a mural of colorful mosaic
tiles, shells, and stones. The work is unique, and one of the last he cre-
ated. Rivera, considered one of Mexico’s greatest artists, has been cred-
ited with being one of the founders of the 20th-century Mexican-muralist
movement. The Olmedo mural, which took him 18 months to complete,
features Aztec deities such as Quetzalcoatl and Tepezcuincle, the Aztec
dog. Rivera and Olmedo were lifelong friends, and Rivera lived in this
house for the last two years of his life during which time he also covered
the interior with murals. However, because this home isn’t a museum,
you have to settle for enjoying the exterior masterpiece. The house is
located a few blocks behind the Casablanca Hotel, a short cab ride from
the central plaza, at Calle Cerro de la Pinzona 6. Have the driver wait
while you look around because there’s not much traffic and it’s a steep
climb back to the plaza.
Acapulco wasn’t always a beach resort. Originally, it was an important
port for the Spanish Empire, and because of the rich trade that took
place here, the city was subject to frequent pirate attacks. In 1616, the
Fuerte de San Diego was constructed to help protect Acapulco. Today,
Chapter 27: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Acapulco 353

this fort is home to the Museo Histórico de Acapulco (% 744-482-3828).
It contains exhibits that tell the story of Acapulco from its roles as a port
in the conquest of the Americas, as a center for local Catholic conversion
campaigns, and as a key site for trade with the Orient. The fort you see
today was rebuilt after a large earthquake damaged the original structure
in 1776, and it benefited from another renovation in 2000. To reach the
fort, follow Costera Miguel Alemán from the Hotel Zone toward Old
Acapulco and the zócalo; the fort is on a hill on the right. The museum is
open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The museum has excep-
tional bilingual exhibitions, and excellent air-conditioning. The $3.50
admission is waived on Sunday.
Sightseeing on the water isn’t limited to the ferryboats that take travel-
ers to Isla de la Roqueta. Old, wooden glass-bottom boats circle the bay,
and you can look down at a few fish and watch a diver or two swim
down to the underwater sanctuary of the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron
saint of Mexico. (The statue of the Virgin — created by sculptor
Armando Quesado — was placed at its submerged location in 1958 in
memory of a group of divers who lost their lives at the spot.) You can
purchase tickets (for approximately $5) at any loading boat or from the
information booth on Playa Caletilla at a discount (% 744-482-2389).
Shopping in Acapulco
Shopping, like attractions in Acapulco, tends to favor the popular over
the cultural — you’re more likely to find a sexy swimsuit than a true
artistic treasure here. Yet, Acapulco does have a few interesting shops.
The best are found at the Mercado Parazal (often called the Mercado 
de Artesanías) on Calle Velázquez de León near Cinco de Mayo in the
downtown zócalo area. (When you see Sanborn’s, turn right and walk
behind it for several blocks; ask for directions if you need to.) It’s a col-
lection of covered stalls selling unique curios from around the country
including silver, embroidered cotton clothing, rugs, pottery, and papier-
mâché. The market is open daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Markets such as the Mercado Parazal are made for bargaining, and the
shopkeepers here test both your negotiating skills and your patience —
they start with a steep price and then drag it down little by little. The
more time you play their game, the better price you pay. As always,
acting uninterested often brings down prices in a hurry.
What Acapulco does offer in abundance are stores selling resort wear,
casual clothing, and the ever-present T-shirt. The Costera is crowded
with shops and boutiques like these, including some brand-name loca-
tions such as Tommy Hilfiger that often have much lower prices than
their stateside counterparts. If you find a sale, you can find incredible
bargains.
Part VII: Acapulco 
354

For the serious shopper, Acapulco even has a few malls. One of the
nicest, air-conditioned shopping centers on the Costera is Plaza Bahía
(Costera Miguel Alemán 125; % 744-485-6939 or 485-6992), which has
four stories of shops, movie theaters, small fast-food restaurants, and a
bowling alley. The center is located just west of the Costa Club Hotel.
The bowling alley, Bol Bahía (% 744-485-0970 or 485-7464), is open
Monday to Saturday noon to 1:30 a.m. and Sundays 10 a.m. to midnight.
Another popular shopping strip is the Plaza Condesa, adjacent to the
Fiesta Americana Condesa, with shops that include Guess, Izod, and
Bronce Swimwear. Olvido Plaza, near the restaurant of the same name
(see Chapter 26), has Tommy Hilfiger and Aca Joe.
Sanborn’s is the hands-down standard in department stores in Mexico
and offers an array of staples including cosmetics, drugstore items, elec-
tronics, music, clothing, books, and magazines. There are three branches
in Acapulco:
 Downtown at Costera Miguel Alemán 209, across from the boat
docks (% 744-482-6167)
 Costera Miguel Alemán 1226 at the Condo Estrella Tower, close to
the convention center (% 744-484-2025, ext. 24/29)
 Costera Miguel Alemán 163 at the Hotel Calinda (% 744-481-2426
or 484-4465)
Acapulco also has a Sam’s Club and a Wal-Mart located on the inland
side of the main highway just prior to its ascent to Las Brisas.
Acapulco has a few notable fine-art galleries. My favorite, Galería
Espacio Pal Kepenyes, Costera Guitarron 140, on the road to the
Radisson (% 744-446-5619), carries the work of Pal Kepenyes, whose
stunning bronzes are among Acapulco’s most notable public sculptures.
The gallery shows smaller versions, as well as signature pieces of jew-
elry in brass, copper, and silver, by appointment only.
Works by another notable Mexican artist, Sergio Bustamante, are avail-
able at his gallery and shop, La Colección de Sergio Bustamante,
Costera Miguel Alemán 120-9, at Galerías Picuda (% 744-484-4992). You
can see his capricious suns, moons, and fantasy figures in a variety of
materials.
Taking a Side Trip to Taxco
The nearby colonial town of Taxco (tah-skoh) is known worldwide for its
silver, but when you arrive, you may see that the town’s geography and
architecture are equally precious. Taxco sits at nearly 1,500m (5,000 ft.)
on a hill among hills, and almost any point in the city offers fantastic
views.
Chapter 27: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Acapulco 355

The center of town is the tiny Plaza Borda, shaded by perfectly mani-
cured Indian laurel trees. On one side is the imposing twin-towered,
pink-stone Santa Prisca y San Sebastián Church; whitewashed, red-tile
buildings housing the famous silver shops and a restaurant or two line
the other sides. Beside the church, deep in a crevice of the mountain, is
the wholesale silver market — absolutely the best place to begin your
silver shopping, to get an idea of prices for more standard designs. You’ll
be amazed at the low prices. Buying just one piece is perfectly accept-
able, though buying in bulk can lower the per-piece price. One of the
beauties of Taxco is that its brick-paved and cobblestone streets are
completely asymmetrical, zigzagging up and down the hillsides. The
plaza buzzes with vendors of everything from hammocks and cotton
candy to bark paintings and balloons.
The tiny, one-man factories that line the cobbled streets all the way up
into the hills supply most of Taxco’s silverwork. Your success at finding
bargains depends somewhat on how much you know about the quality
and price of silver, but Taxco’s quantity and variety of silver can’t be
matched anywhere else in the country.
Getting to Taxco
It takes about four hours by bus to travel between Acapulco and Taxco,
but the resulting bargains in exquisite silver and jewelry are well worth
the trip — you won’t be disappointed.
The best way to travel to Taxco from Acapulco is through one of the
numerous day-trip charters that you can easily arrange at your hotel’s
tour desk or a local travel agent. Most excursions leave around 6:30 a.m.
and return at 9 p.m. for a cost of about $60. You can also venture on 
your own — but I strongly recommend taking a bus over renting a car
because the bus drivers know the route and much of the trip is along
narrow, curvaceous roads through steep mountains.
Exploring Taxco
Shopping for jewelry and other items is the major pastime for tourists.
Prices for silver jewelry at the more than 300 shops in Taxco are about
the best in the world, and everything is available, from $1 trinkets to
artistic pieces costing hundreds of dollars. You can get your fill of silver
and an idea of what Taxco is like by spending an afternoon here, but this
picturesque town has a lot more to offer than just the Plaza Borda and
the shops surrounding it. For example, Taxco is the home of some of
Mexico’s finest stone sculptors and is also a good place to buy masks.
However, beware of so-called “antiques” — there are virtually no real
ones for sale.
Stay overnight and give yourself time to wander the steep cobblestone
streets and discover the little plazas, fine churches, cultural attractions,
and of course, the silversmith shops. If Acapulco is all you’ve seen
Part VII: Acapulco 
356

during your vacation, a visit here will make you feel that, at last, you’re
in “Mexico.” Take time to visit the following sites:
 Santa Prisca y San Sebastián Church, Plaza Borda (% 762-622-
0183 or -0184), is Taxco’s centerpiece parish church; completed in
1758 after eight years of labor, it’s one of Mexico’s most impressive
baroque churches. The church is open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
and admission is free.
 Stroll along Ruiz de Alarcón and look for the Humboldt House/
Museo Virreinal de Taxco, Calle Juan Ruiz de Alarcón 12 (the street
behind the Casa Borda; % 762-622-5501), where the renowned
German scientist and explorer Baron Alexander von Humboldt
(1769–1859) spent a night in 1803. The museum houses 18th-century
memorabilia pertinent to Taxco. Admission is $3 for adults and
$1.15 for students and teachers with ID; the museum is open
Tuesday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 A plaque in Spanish explains that most of the collection of pre-
Columbian art displayed at the Museo de Taxco Guillermo
Spratling, Calle Porfirio A. Delgado 1 (% 762-622-1660), as well 
as the funds for the museum, came from William Spratling. You’d
expect this to be a silver museum, but it’s not. This museum’s
entrance floor and the second floor display a good collection of
pre-Columbian statues and implements in clay, stone, and jade. The
lower floor has changing exhibits. To find the museum, turn right
out of the Santa Prisca Church and right again at the corner; con-
tinue down the street, veer right, then immediately left. The
museum is facing you. The museum is open Tuesday to Saturday 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is $3.35 
for adults and free for children under 13, with free admission for all
on Sundays.
Staying a night
Taxco is an overnight visitor’s dream: charming and picturesque, with a
respectable selection of pleasant, well-kept hotels. Hotel prices tend to
rise at holiday times (especially Easter week). The following are some
suggestions in case you decide to spend a night or two:
 The Hacienda del Solar, Paraje del Solar s/n (%/fax 762-622-0587),
comprises several Mexican-style cottages, all on a beautifully land-
scaped hilltop with magnificent views of the surrounding valleys
and the town. The décor is slightly different in each cottage, but
most contain plenty of beautiful handicrafts, red-tile floors, and
bathrooms with handmade tiles. Several rooms have vaulted tile
ceilings and private terraces with panoramic views. Rates are $130
double and $130 to $150 for a junior or deluxe suite.
 Hotel Los Arcos, Juan Ruiz de Alarcón 4 (% 762-622-1836; Fax:
762-622-7982), with rooms for $39 double, occupies a converted
1620 monastery. The handsome inner patio is bedecked with
Chapter 27: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Acapulco 357

Puebla pottery and has a lively restaurant area, all around a central
fountain.
 Each room at the delightful Hotel Emilia Castillo, Juan Ruiz de
Alarcón 7 (%/fax 762-622-1396), is simply but beautifully appointed
with handsome carved doors and furniture; bathrooms have either
tubs or showers. Rate is $40 double.
 The Rancho Taxco Victoria, Carlos J. Nibbi 5 and 7 (% 762-622-
0004; Fax: 762-622-0010), clings to the hillside above town, with
stunning views from its flower-covered verandas. It exudes the
charm of old-fashioned Mexico. The comfortable furnishings,
though slightly run-down, evoke the hotel’s 1940s heyday. Even if
you don’t stay here, come for a drink in the comfortable bar and
living room, or sit on the terrace to take in the fabulous view.
Rooms cost $62 for a standard double, $89 for a deluxe double, 
and $100 for a junior suite.
 The Santa Prisca, Cenaobscuras 1 (% 762-622-0080 or 622-0980;
Fax: 762-622-2938), is one of the town’s older and nicer hotels.
Rooms are small but comfortable, with standard bathrooms (show-
ers only), tile floors, wood beams, and a colonial atmosphere. A
reading area in an upstairs salon overlooks Taxco, as well as a lush
patio with fountains. Rooms range from $46 double to $52 superior
to $74 suite.
Dining in Taxco
Taxco gets a lot of day-trippers from Mexico City and Acapulco, most of
whom choose to dine close to the Plaza Borda. Prices in this area are
high for what you get. Just a few streets back, though, you can find some
excellent, simple restaurants:
 The spectacular view of the city from La Ventana de Taxco, in the
Hacienda del Solar hotel, Paraje del Solar s/n (% 762-622-0587),
makes it one of the best places to dine in Taxco. The food — 
standard Italian fare — is also quite good, if not predictable. The
pasta dishes are the most recommendable. Lasagna is a big
favorite, and Sicilian steak is also popular.
 An inexpensive alternative is Restaurante Ethel, Plazuela San Juan
14 (% 762-622-0788). This family-run place is opposite the Hotel
Santa Prisca, a block from the Plaza Borda. It has colorful cloths on
the tables and a tidy, homey atmosphere. The hearty comida cor-
rida (essentially, a daily special) consists of soup or pasta, meat
(perhaps a small steak), dessert, and good coffee.
 Another favorite is Sotavento Restaurant Bar Galería, Juárez 8,
next to City Hall (% 762-627-1217), which offers many Italian 
specialties — try the deliciously fresh spinach salad and large
pepper steak for a hearty meal; or Spaghetti Barbara, with poblano
peppers and avocado, for a vegetarian meal. To find this place from
the Plaza Borda, walk downhill beside the Hotel Agua Escondida,
Part VII: Acapulco 
358

and then follow the street as it bears left (don’t go right on Juan
Ruiz de Alarcón) about a block. The restaurant is on the left just
after the street bends left.
 Toni’s, in the Hotel Monte Taxco (% 762-622-1300), is an intimate,
classic restaurant (albeit a tad expensive) enclosed in a huge, cone-
shaped palapa with a panoramic view of the city. The menu, mainly
shrimp or beef, is limited, but the food is superior. Try tender, juicy
prime roast beef, which comes with Yorkshire pudding, creamed
spinach, and baked potato. Lobster is sometimes available. To reach
Toni’s, it’s best to take a taxi. Note: Toni’s is only open for dinner.
Discovering Taxco after dark
Paco’s (% 762-622-0064) is the most popular place overlooking the
square for cocktails, conversation, and people-watching, all of which
continue until midnight daily. Taxco’s version of a disco, Windows, is
high up the mountain in the Hotel Monte Taxco (% 762-622-1300). The
whole city is on view, and music runs the gamut from the hit parade to
hard rock. For a cover of $6.70, you can dance away Saturday night from
10 p.m. to 3 a.m.
Completely different in tone is Berta’s (Plaza Borda 9; % 762-622-0172),
next to the Santa Prisca Church. Opened in 1930 by a lady named Berta,
who made her fame on a drink of the same name (tequila, soda, lime,
and honey), it’s the traditional gathering place of the local gentry and
more than a few tourists. Spurs and old swords decorate the walls, and 
a saddle is casually slung over the banister on the stairs leading to the
second-floor room, where tin masks leer from the walls. A Berta (the
drink, of course) costs about $2; rum, the same. It’s open daily from 
11 a.m. to around 10 p.m.
National drinks (not beer) are two-for-one nightly between 6 and 8 p.m. at
the terrace bar of the Hotel Rancho Taxco Victoria (% 762-622-0004),
where you can also drink in the fabulous view.
Discovering Acapulco after Dark
If there’s anything Acapulco is more famous for than its beaches, it’s the
nightlife. Even if you feel that your “clubbing” days are behind you —
trust me — give it a try. The views from the hillside clubs are among the
best in town, and it’s an equally fascinating scene inside. As is typical
with clubs, the names and crowds change with the seasons, and places
don’t remain “hot” forever, but the ones I list tend to always be in the
upper end of popularity. In addition, here are some general tips:
 Every club seems to have a cover charge of around $20 in high
season and $10 in low season; drinks can cost anywhere from $3 
to $10. Women can count on paying less or entering for free. Don’t
even think about going out to one of the hillside discos before 
Chapter 27: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Acapulco 359

11 p.m., and don’t expect much action until after midnight. The
party goes on until 4 or 5 a.m. — and occasionally until 8 a.m. On
weekends, the live dance shows — bordering on performance art —
are well worth the lack of sleep.
 Many discos periodically waive their cover charge or offer some
other promotion to attract customers. Another popular option is to
have a higher cover charge but an open bar. Look for promotional
materials displayed in hotel reception areas, at travel desks or
concierge booths, and in local publications. You may also be hit up
with promotions for nightclubs as you take in the sun at the local
beaches.
 Besides nightclubs, you have other options. The Gran Noche
Mexicana combines a performance by the Acapulco Ballet
Folklórico with one by Los Voladores from Papantla. One of the 
few options to experience some authentic Mexican culture in town,
it’s held in the plaza of the convention center every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday at 7 p.m. With dinner and an open bar, the
show costs $62; general admission (including three drinks) is $30.
Call for reservations (% 744-484-7046 or 484-7098) or consult a
local travel agency. Many major hotels also host Mexican fiestas
and other theme nights that include dinner and entertainment.
 If you’re brave enough — or inebriated enough — you can try out
the bungee jump (Costera Miguel Alemán 101; % 744-484-7529) in
the midst of the beach bar zone. For $62, you get one jump, plus a
T-shirt, diploma, and membership. Additional jumps are $28, and
your fourth jump is free. For $67, you can jump as many times as
you like from 4 to 11 p.m.
Acapulco has essentially two different club scenes: the strip of beach
bars along the Costera Hotel Zone and the glitzier club scene in the hill-
sides near Las Brisas.
The younger crowd seems to prefer a little fresh air with their nightlife
and favor the growing number of open-air, oceanfront dance clubs along
Costera Miguel Alemán. These establishments are concentrated between
the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels; tend to feature
techno, house, or alternative rock; and are an earlier and more casual
option for nightlife. Faves include the jammin’ DiscoBeach (% 744-484-
8230), El Sombrero doesn’t exist anymore, now it’s called Tacos n’Beer
(% 744-484-2549), Taboo also closed, and the pirate-themed Barbaroja
(% 744-484-5932). These places generally offer an open bar with cover
charge (around $10). Women frequently drink for free or with a lesser
charge. (Men may pay more, but then, the young and tanned beach
babes are here. So who’s complaining?)
Of the more traditional clubs, here’s my alphabetical rundown of the
current scene including some uniquely entertaining options:
Part VII: Acapulco 
360

 Exterior reflection pools and flaming torches mark the entrance to
Alebrijes (Costera Miguel Alemán 3308, across the street from the
Hyatt Regency Acapulco; % 744-484-5902). Inside, booths and
round tables with a seating capacity of 1,200 surround the vast
dance floor — the disco doubles as a venue for concerts and live
performances by some of Mexico’s most notable singers. Usually,
you’ll join a Mexican crowd in their mid-20s here, but the crowd
may vary with featured performers. Alebrijes is open nightly 11
p.m. to 5 a.m. Cover (including open bar) for women is $5 to $25;
for men it’s $8 to $35. On Mondays, the open bar is for tequila
drinks only.
 A long-time favorite in Acapulco is Baby-O’s (Costera Miguel
Alemán, across the street from the Hotel Romano Days Inn; % 744-
484-7474), which has kept current and maintained its place among
the top clubs. This hangout is a great choice for those who shun
mammoth clubs in favor of a more intimate setting. The mid- to
late-20s crowd dances to everything from swing to hip-hop to 
rock ’n’ roll on the small dance floor surrounded by several tiers 
of tables and sculpted, cave-like walls. Drinks are more moderately
priced than in most Acapulco clubs and cost $3 to $5. Baby-O’s is
open 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. Cover for women is $5 to $17; for men, it’s
$10 to $35. Both covers include two national drinks.
 Venture into the stylish chrome-and-neon extravaganza that is
Mandara (Carretera Escénica; % 744-446-5712 or 446-5711; www.
mandaraacapulco.com.mx) for a true Acapulco-nightlife experi-
ence. Perched on the side of the mountain between Los Rancheros
Restaurant and La Vista Shopping Center, the club is easy to spot
with its neon and laser lights pulsating in the night. The plush, dim
interior dazzles patrons with a sunken dance floor and a panoramic
view of the lights of Acapulco Bay. The club also has a more inti-
mate piano bar upstairs overlooking the disco, Siboney, which
draws a more mature and moneyed crowd. Downstairs, the club
alternates between pumping in mood smoke and fresh oxygen to
keep you dancing. The door attendants wear tuxedos indicating
that they encourage a more sophisticated dress — tight and slinky
is the norm for ladies; no shorts for gentlemen. The club opens
nightly at 10:30 p.m. Fireworks rock the usually full house at 3 a.m.,
which is when a stylized dance performance takes place on week-
ends in the style of Euro-clubs. During peak season, call to find out
if you need reservations. Cover varies but is around $5 for women
and $25 for men, and all major credit cards are accepted.
 Palladium (Carretera Escénica; % 744-446-5483) is just down the
road from Enigma, but it lacks both the style and the classy clien-
tele of the neighboring club. A younger, rowdier crowd enjoys the
equally fabulous views and the dancing platforms set in the large
glass windows overlooking the bay. Cover is $5 to $15 for women,
$8 to $25 for men.
Chapter 27: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Acapulco 361

 Pepe’s Piano Bar (Carretera Escénica, Comercial La Vista, Local 5;
% 744-446-5736) has surely been one of the most famous piano
bars in the hemisphere, although it appears those days may be
numbered. It has inspired patrons of all ages to sing their hearts
out for more than 40 years, and it still draws a crowd, though it
now caters to karaoke instead of piano — a big mistake, in my opin-
ion. I keep hoping the owners will come to their senses and return
to their roots. It’s open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. 
 Billing itself as “the cathedral of salsa,” Salon Q (Costera Miguel
Alemán 3117; % 744-481-0114) is known as the place to get down
to the Latin rhythms when in Acapulco. Frequently, management
raises the cover and features impersonators doing their thing as
the top Latin American musical acts. Cover runs from $13 to $25.
 Across the street from Mandara is Zucca (Carretera Escénica 28, in
the La Vista Shopping Center; % 744-446-5691 or 446-5690), which
offers up yet another fantastic bay view. It claims to cater to a
slightly more mature crowd — stating that only those older than 25
are admitted — but seems to bend the rules, especially for younger
women. Zucca is particularly popular with the moneyed Mexico City
set. Periodically during the evening, the club projects a laser show
across the bay. The dress code prohibits shorts, jeans, T-shirts, or
sandals. The club is open nightly 10:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m., but it stays
open later (until 4 a.m.) on weekends or when the crowd demands
it. The cover charge, which ranges from $10 to $15, is occasionally
waived, at least until a sufficient crowd builds.

Part VIII
Huatulco and the
Southern Paciﬁc
Coast

In this part . . . 
T
he southern beach resorts of Huatulco and Puerto
Escondido are Mexico’s purest ecotourism beach resorts.
Unspoiled nature and a laid-back sentiment combine to offer
up the uninterrupted experience of Mexico’s pure, natural
splendor. Puerto Escondido is a little-known paradise of
exceptional values and unique, independent accommoda-
tions. Neighboring Huatulco puts on a bit of a different face 
as it combines indulgent hotels and modern facilities with
pristine beaches and jungle landscapes.
The following chapters take you through these lesser-known
treasures among Mexico’s beach resorts and help you uncover
their unique and worthwhile charms.

Chapter 28
Bahías de Huatulco
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Surveying Huatulco’s hotel scene
 Getting to know Huatulco
 Finding great places to dine
 Embarking on an adventure
L
ocated in the state of Oaxaca (wah-hah-cah), Huatulco’s nine bays
encompass 36 beaches and countless inlets and coves. The resort
as a whole is a staged development project by the Mexican govern-
ment’s tourism development arm (FONATUR) that aims to cover 20,800
hectares (52,000 acres) of land with more than 16,000 hectares (40,000
acres) remaining as ecological preserves. Huatulco hasn’t grown as rap-
idly as Cancún, the previous planned-development resort, so plenty of
undeveloped stretches of pure white sand and isolated coves are still
around to enjoy.
Huatulco has increasingly become known for its ecotourism attractions —
including river rafting, rappelling, and jungle hiking. It’s not a destination
for travelers who care a lot about shopping, nightlife, or even dining
because its options for these pursuits are fewer than other beach resorts
in Mexico. However, if you’re especially drawn to snorkeling, diving, boat
cruises to virgin bays, and simple relaxation, you may quickly find that
Huatulco fits the bill perfectly.
The opening of a new cruise-ship dock in Santa Cruz Bay is changing the
level of activity in Huatulco, providing the sleepy resort with an impor-
tant business boost. The new dock handles up to two 3,000-passenger
cruise ships at a time (tenders used to ferry passengers to shore).
In this chapter, I describe the layout of Huatulco and review some of the
region’s best hotels. I also take you from the plane, through the airport,
and to your hotel, helping you quickly get your bearings in this easy-to-
navigate resort situated along successive bays. I also offer tips on every-
thing from transportation to dining out to enjoying the best of the
numerous natural treasures of this pristine part of Mexico.

Choosing a Location
Unspoiled nature can be an idyllic retreat from the stress of daily life —
and for some people, it’s even more attractive when viewed from a
luxury-hotel balcony. Huatulco is for vacationers who want to enjoy the
beauty of nature during the day and then retreat to well-appointed com-
fort by night. Slow-paced and still relatively undiscovered, the hotels
located among the nine bays of Huatulco enjoy the most modern infra-
structure of any resort destination along Mexico’s Pacific coast.
The area is divided into three principle sections: Santa Cruz, Crucecita,
and Tangolunda Bay. These locations offer enough variety in accommo-
dations that you’re sure to find something to satisfy your vacation
expectations regardless of your taste or budget. 
The main differences between locations here can be simply summarized:
Tangolunda Bay hotels are the newest, most deluxe properties in the
area offering full-service pampering. Hotels in Santa Cruz are older, sim-
pler in style, and lower in price. The village of Crucecita by far offers the
best value, but you must take a shuttle to the beach. Although you cer-
tainly may find that the part of town you stay in impacts your overall
experience, understand that everything is relatively close by, and getting
around is both easy and inexpensive. Bahía Chahué also has some lim-
ited accommodations, but is still less prominent for tourism services.
Moderate- and budget-priced hotels in Santa Cruz and Crucecita are gen-
erally higher in price compared to similar hotels in other Mexican beach
resorts. But the luxury beach hotels in Tangolunda Bay have rates com-
parable to similar properties in other destinations, especially when
these hotels are part of a package that includes airfare. The trend is
toward all-inclusive resorts, which in Huatulco are a good option given
the lack of memorable dining and nightlife options around town. Hotels
that aren’t oceanfront generally have an arrangement with one of the
beach clubs at Santa Cruz or Chahué Bay and provide shuttle service 
to the beach. Low-season rates refer to the months of August through
November only.
Evaluating the Top Accommodations
As far as prices go, I note rack rates (the maximum that a hotel or resort
charges for a room) for two people spending one night in a double room
during high season (Christmas to Easter). You can usually do better, espe-
cially if you’re purchasing a package that includes airfare (read Chapter 7
for tips on avoiding paying rack rates). Prices quoted here include the 
17 percent room tax. Note that some rates may seem much higher than
others — until you realize that they’re “all inclusive” — your meals and
beverages are included in the price of your stay. These rates also include
all tips, taxes, and most activities and entertainment. Please refer to the
Introduction of this book for an explanation of the price categories.

Camino Real Zaashila
$$$$$
Tangolunda Bay
One of Tangolunda Bay’s original hotels — and my top choice here — the
Camino Real is located on a wide stretch of sandy beach secluded from
other beaches by small rock outcroppings. With calm water, it’s perfect for
swimming and snorkeling and ideal for families. The Mediterranean-style
white-stucco building is washed in colors on the ocean side, looking a little
like a scene from the Greek isles. Rooms on the lower levels — 41 of 
them — each have their own sizable dipping pools. All rooms are large and
have an oceanview balcony or terrace, marble tub/shower-combination
bathrooms, wicker furnishings, and décors with bold colors. The main pool
is a free-form design that spans 120m (400 ft.) of beach with chaises built
into the shallow edges. Well-manicured, tropical gardens surround the pool
and the guest rooms. You have your choice of three restaurants here,
including Chez Binni, noted for its excellent regional Oaxacan cuisine (fea-
turing pork dishes and moles), plus room service and a lobby bar with live
music. A full watersports center is also on its exceptional stretch of beach.
Other pluses include a large outdoor whirlpool and a lighted tennis court.

Tangolunda Bay
With all meals, drinks, entertainment, tips, and a slew of activities included
in the price of admission, the Gala is a value-packed experience. It caters
to adults of all ages (married and single) who enjoy both activity and relax-
ation. An excellent kids’ activities program probably makes it the best
option in the area for families. Rooms have tile floors and Oaxacan wood
trim, large tub/shower-combination bathrooms, and ample balconies —
all with views of Tangolunda Bay. Three restaurants serve both buffet and
a la carte meals, and the Gala has changing theme nights. A large, free-form
pool, a complete beachfront watersports center, four lighted tennis courts,
and a full gym are on-hand to keep you active.

Santa Cruz
This property was Huatulco’s first hotel, and it retains the Mexican charm
and comfort that originally made it memorable. A recent addition more
than doubled the hotel’s original size. Rooms have Mexican-tile floors, arti-
san-crafted bedspreads, and colonial-style furniture; French doors open
onto tiny wrought-iron balconies overlooking the main street of Juárez or
the pool and gardens. The newer rooms have more modern teak furnish-
ings and are generally much nicer — request this section. A nice shady
area surrounds the hotel’s small pool in back of the lobby. The hotel is
away from the marina at the far end of Juárez, only a few blocks from the
water. These folks offer free transportation every hour to the beach club
at Santa Cruz Bay.

Misión de los Arcos
$–$$
Crucecita
This exceptional hotel, just a block from the central plaza, has a similar
style to the elegant Quinta Real — at a fraction of the cost. The hotel is
mostly white and accented with an abundance of greenery (no flowering
plants), which gives it a fresh, clean, and inviting feel. Rooms, washed in
white with cream and beige bed coverings and upholstery, have the same
ambience. Built-in desks, French windows, and minimal but interesting
decorative accents give this budget hotel a true sense of style. A cafe with
international magazines and high-speed Internet access (open 8 a.m.–mid-
night) is at the right side of the entrance level. The adjacent Terra Cotta
restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and is equally stylish and
budget-friendly. There’s also an on-site gym with excellent quality equip-
ment, which is complimentary for guest use, and open to other visitors 
for a daily fee. Although the hotel has no pool, guests may enjoy the 
use of the Castillo Beach Club, at Chahué Bay, open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The hotel’s central location is ideal for sampling Crucecita’s shops and
restaurants.

Quinta Real
$$$$$
Tangolunda Bay
The most romantic of Huatulco’s hotels, the Quinta Real is known for its
understated elegance and efficient service. Double Moorish domes mark
this relaxed hotel that has a richly appointed cream-and-white décor. The
Quinta Real cascades down a hillside — from the welcoming reception
area to the luxurious beach club below. The small groupings of suites are
built into the sloping hill down to Tangolunda Bay and offer spectacular
views of the ocean and golf course. (Rooms on the eastern edge of the
resort sit above the highway and have some traffic noise.) Interiors are
elegant and comfortable with stylish Mexican furniture, wood-beamed ceil-
ings, marble tub/shower-combination bathrooms with whirlpool tubs, and
original artwork. Telescopes grace many of the suites. Balconies have over-
stuffed seating areas and floors of stone inlay. Selected suites have private
pools of their own. One restaurant serves breakfast and dinner, and the
beach club poolside-casual restaurant is open for lunch. The beach club
has two pools — one for children — as well as showers and palapas on
the beach with chair and towel service. The elegant, library-style bar offers
up a stunning view and makes a great place for a drink even if you’re not
staying here. The Quinta Real is perfect for weddings, honeymoons, or
small corporate retreats.

Settling into Huatulco
In Huatulco, getting into the swing of things is easy. From the small air-
port, the ride into town along well-paved roads is quick. You’re likely to
encounter exceptional graciousness and a truly warm welcome from
everyone from taxi drivers to bellhops.
Arriving in Huatulco by air
Huatulco’s international airport (% 958-581-9004 or 581-9005), is
located about 19km (12 miles) northwest of the Bahías de Huatulco. As
you deplane, you go down some stairs onto the tarmac and take a brief
walk into the terminal — important to know if you’re carrying on any
heavy luggage. After you’re inside the small terminal, you reach the
immigration clearance area. At the immigration booth, an officer asks
you to show your passport (or other proof of citizenship) and your com-
pleted tourist card, the FMT (see Chapter 9 for all the FMT details).
Your FMT is an important document, so take good care of it. You’re 
supposed to keep the FMT with you at all times because you may be
required to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to
turn it back in upon departure, or you may be unable to leave without
replacing it.

Next, grab your baggage from the baggage-claims carousel. If needed,
porters are available to help with your bags for a tip of about a dollar a
bag. After you collect your luggage, you pass through another check-
point. Something that looks like a traffic light awaits you here. You press
a button, and if the light turns green, you’re free to go. If it turns red, you
need to open each of your bags for a quick search. It’s Mexico’s random
search procedure for Customs. If you have an unusually large bag, or an
excessive amount of luggage, you may be searched regardless of the traf-
fic-light outcome.
With your bags, exit the terminal where taxis and other transportation
services are waiting.
Getting from the airport to your hotel
From the airport, private taxis charge $40 to Crucecita, $42 to Santa Cruz
Bay, and $48 to Tangolunda Bay. Transportes Terrestres (% 958-581-
9014) a colectivo (shared) minibus fares range from $8 to $10 per person.
When returning to the airport, make sure to specifically ask for a taxi
unless you have a lot of luggage. Taxis to the airport run $20, but unless
you request one, companies send a van, which costs $40 for the same
trip.
Because this beach destination is so spread out and has excellent roads,
you may want to consider a rental car (at least for a day or two for a bit of
exploring). The bays are spread out, and having a car allows you to see
more of them, and explore a bit on your own on the modern and well-
paved roads. If you opt for a rental, consider timing it so that you either
pick up your car upon arrival or return it as you depart, saving an extra
trip to the airport. Budget (% 800-322-9976 in U.S., or 958-587-0010 or
581-9000) has an office at the airport, which is open when flights arrive.
Daily rates run around $56 for a Volkswagen sedan, $79 for a Nissan Sentra
or Geo Tracker, and $100 for a Jeep Wrangler.
Knowing your way around town
Bahías de Huatulco include all nine bays of this resort area. The town 
of Santa María de Huatulco, the original settlement in this area, is 27km
(17 miles) inland. Santa Cruz Bay, usually just called Santa Cruz, was 
the first area on the coast to be developed. It has a central plaza with a
bandstand kiosk that has been converted into a cafe serving regionally
grown coffee. Santa Cruz also has an artisan’s market on the edge of the
plaza that borders the main road, a few hotels and restaurants, and a
marina from which bay tours and fishing trips set sail, as well as the
cruise ships. Juárez is Santa Cruz’s main street. It’s about 4 blocks long
in all and anchored at one end by the Hotel Castillo Huatulco and at the
other by the Meigas Binniguenda hotel. Opposite the Hotel Castillo is the
marina, and beyond the marina are restaurants housed in new, colonial-
style buildings facing the beach. The area’s banks are on Juárez. Getting
lost is impossible; you can take in almost everything at a glance.
Chapter 28: Bahías de Huatulco 371

Area Code
The telephone area code is 958.
Baby Sitters
Most of the larger hotels can easily arrange
baby sitters, but many sitters speak limited
English. Rates range from $4 to $10 per
hour.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
All three areas have banks, including the
main Mexican banks Banamex and
Bancomer, with ATMs. Banks change
money during business hours, which are 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday and 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. on Saturdays. Banks are located
along Calle Juárez in Santa Cruz and sur-
round the central plaza in Crucecita.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (10 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
4–8 p.m., daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day. Offices tend to be
closed on Saturday and Sunday, but shops
are open on Saturday, at least, and increas-
ingly offer limited hours of operation on
Sunday.
Emergencies
Police emergency (% 060); local police
(% 958-587-0815); transit police (% 958-
587-0186); and Red Cross (Bulevar Chahué
110; % 958-587-1188).
Part VIII: Huatulco and the Southern Pacific Coast 
372
About 2.5km (11⁄2 miles) inland from Santa Cruz is Crucecita, a planned
city that sprang up in 1985 centered on a lovely grassy plaza edged 
with flowering hedges. Crucecita is the residential area for the resorts.
Neighborhoods of new stucco homes are mixed with small apartment
complexes. The town has evolved into a lovely, traditional town where
you can find the area’s best — and most reasonably priced — restau-
rants, plus some shopping and several clean, less-expensive hotels.
Tangolunda Bay, 5km (3 miles) east of Crucecita, is the focal point of bay
development. Over time, half of the bays should have resorts. But for now,
Tangolunda has the lion’s share, with an 18-hole golf course; the elegant
Las Brisas Resort; and the Quinta Real, Barceló Huatulco, Gala Resort,
Casa del Mar, and Camino Real Zaashila hotels, among others. Small strip
centers with a few restaurants occupy each end of Tangolunda Bay.
Chahué Bay, between Tangolunda and Santa Cruz, is a small bay with a
beach club, along with houses and some small restaurants.
Walking between any of the three destinations (Crucecita, Santa Cruz,
and Tangolunda) is too far, but taxis are inexpensive and readily avail-
able. The fare between Santa Cruz and Tangolunda is roughly $2.50;
between Santa Cruz and Crucecita, $2; and between Crucecita and
Tangolunda, $3.
Minibus service between towns costs 50¢. In Santa Cruz, catch the bus
across the street from Castillo Huatulco; in Tangolunda, it stops in front
of the Grand Pacific; and in Crucecita, the bus stop is cater-corner from
the Hotel Grifer.

Information
The State Tourism Office (Oficina del
Turismo; % 958-581-0176 or -0177; 
sedetur6@oaxaca.gob.mx) has an
information module in Tangolunda Bay near
the Grand Pacific hotel, and another inside
the Gala Resort.
Internet Access
Several Internet cafes are located in
Crucecita. One is at the cafe in the Misión
de los Arcos (Av. Gardenia 902; % 958-587-
0165), which in addition to paid service is
also a free wireless hot spot; another is on
the ground-floor level of the Hotel Plaza

main plaza; % 958-587-0054 or 587-0009;

One of the best around is the free American
Express map, usually found at the tourist
information offices.
Medical Care
Dr. Ricardo Carrillo (% 958-587-0687 or
587-0600) speaks English.
Pharmacy
Farmacia del Carmen (% 958-587-0878),
one of the largest drugstores in Crucecita,
is located just off the central plaza.
Farmacia La Clinica (% 958-587-0591) is
located at Sabalí 1602 in Crucecita and
offers both 24-hour service and home/hotel
delivery.
Post Office
The post office at Bulevar Chahué 100,
Sector R (% 958-587-0551), is open
Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and
Saturdays 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Safety
Huatulco enjoys a very low crime rate.
Most crime or encounters with the police
are linked to pickpocket thefts, so use
common sense and never leave your
belongings unattended at the beach.
Taxes
A 15 percent IVA (value-added tax) on
goods and services is charged, and it’s 
generally included in the posted price.
Taxis
In Crucecita, a taxi stand is opposite the
Hotel Grifer and another is on the Plaza
Principal. Taxis are readily available in
Santa Cruz and Tangolunda through your
hotel. The fare between Santa Cruz and
Tangolunda is roughly $2.50; between Santa
Cruz and Crucecita, $2; and between
Crucecita and Tangolunda, $3. You can also
rent taxis by the hour (about $15 per hour)
or for the day if you want to explore the
area.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
by using a Telmex (LADATEL) prepaid phone
card, available at most pharmacies and
mini-supers, using the official Telmex 
(Lada) public phones. Remember, in Mexico
you need to dial 001 prior to a number to
reach the United States, and you need to
preface long distance calls within Mexico
by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Huatulco operates on central standard
time, but Mexico’s observance of daylight
saving time varies somewhat from that in
the United States.
Chapter 28: Bahías de Huatulco 373

Dining in Huatulco
Contrary to conventional travel wisdom, many of the better restaurants
in the Tangolunda Bay area — or from a practical standpoint, most of
the restaurants, period — are located in the hotels. Outside the hotels,
the best choices are in Crucecita and on the beach in Santa Cruz.
Like many of Mexico’s beach resorts, even the finest restaurants in town
can be comfortably casual when it comes to dress. Men seldom wear
jackets, although ladies frequently wear dressy resort garb — basically,
everything goes.
I list the following restaurants alphabetically and note their location and
general price category. Remember that tips generally run about 15 per-
cent, and most wait-staff really depend on these for their income, so be
generous if the service warrants. Please refer to the Introduction of this
book for an explanation of the price categories.
Please see Appendix C for more information on Mexican cuisine.

For years, Doña Celia, an original Huatulco resident, chose to stay in busi-
ness in the same area where she started her little thatch-roofed restau-
rant. Now, she’s in a new building at the end of Santa Cruz’s beach serving
the same good eats. Among her specialties are filete empapelado, a foil-
wrapped fish baked with tomato, onion, and cilantro, and filete almen-
drado, a fish filet covered with hot-cake batter, beer, and almonds. The
ceviche is terrific (one order is plenty for two), as is the platillo a la huat-
ulqueño (shrimp and young octopus fried in olive oil with chile and onion
and served over white rice). The ambience is basic, but the food is the
reason for its popularity. If you dine here during the day, beach chairs and
shade are available, so you can make your own “beach club” away from
your hotel in this more traditional and accessible part of Huatulco.

OAXACAN
El Sabor de Oaxaca is the best place in the area to enjoy authentic and richly
flavorful Oaxacan food, which is among the best of traditional Mexican cui-

of tourists. The mixed grill for two — with chorizo (a zesty Mexican
sausage), Oaxacan beef filet, tender pork tenderloin, and pork ribs — is
among the most popular items, and the Oaxacan special for two — a gen-
erous sampling of the best of the menu with tamales, Oaxacan cheese, pork
mole, and more — is a can’t-miss selection. Generous breakfasts are just

Having Fun on and off the Beach
Attractions around Huatulco concentrate on the nine bays in the area and
their related watersports. Huatulco is truly a nature-lover’s paradise offer-
ing the more adventurous travelers activities from rafting to rappelling.
Hitting Huatulco’s best beaches
Huatulco’s major attraction is its coastline — that magnificent stretch of
pristine bays bordered by an odd blend of cactus and jungle vegetation
that runs right to the water’s edge. The only way to really grasp its beauty
is by taking a cruise of the bays, stopping at Organo Bay or Maguey Bay
for a dip in the crystal-clear water and a fish lunch at one of the palapa
restaurants on the beach.
As far as the more accessible, local beaches go, a section of the beach 
at Santa Cruz (away from the small boats), is the location of the beach
clubs that guests of non-oceanfront hotels use. Several restaurants are
also on this beach, and you can find palapa umbrellas down to the
water’s edge.
For about $15 one way, pangas (small boats) from the marina in Santa
Cruz ferry passengers to Playa La Entrega, also in Santa Cruz Bay. A row
of palapa restaurants, all with beach chairs out front, greet you at La
Entrega. Find an empty palapa, call it home for the day, and in return,
use that restaurant for your refreshment needs. A snorkel-equipment-
rental booth is about midway down the beach, and there’s some fairly
good snorkeling on the end away from where the boats arrive.
Between Santa Cruz and Tangolunda bays is Chahué Bay. A beach club
here has palapas, beach volleyball, and refreshments for an entrance fee
of about $4. However, a strong undertow makes this a dangerous place
for swimming.
Playa Tangolunda, fronting the best hotels, is wide and beautiful.
Theoretically, all beaches in Mexico are public; however, if you’re not a
guest at a Tangolunda Bay hotel, you may have difficulty entering a hotel
to get to the beach.
Cruising Huatulco
The most popular way to tour Huatulco’s bays is to jump on a boat, such
as the Tequila, and join one of the organized day-long bay cruises com-
plete with guide, drinks, and on-board entertainment. You can call direct
(% 958-587-0856), or any travel agency can easily arrange these tours,
which cost about $25 per person with an extra charge of $4 for snorkel-
ing equipment rental and lunch. Another, more romantic option is the
Luna Azul, a 13m (44-ft.) sailboat that offers bay tours and sunset sails.
Call % 958-587-0945 or 587-1145 (at the Hotel Chahué) for reservations.
Part VIII: Huatulco and the Southern Pacific Coast 
376

If you prefer to venture out on your own, arrange your own bay tour by
going to the boat-owners’ cooperative (% 958-587-0081) in the red-and-
yellow tin shack at the entrance to the marina in Santa Cruz. Prices are
posted there, and you can buy tickets for sightseeing, snorkeling, or fish-
ing. Besides Playa la Entrega, other more distant beaches are noted for
good offshore snorkeling, plus they also have palapa restaurants and
other facilities. These strips of sand include Playa Maguey and Playa San
Agustín. Just remember that several of these beaches are completely
undeveloped and pristine, so you need to bring your own provisions.
Boatmen at the cooperative can arrange return pick-up at an appointed
time. Prices run about $15 for one to ten people to La Entrega and $35 for
a trip to Maguey and Organo bays. The most distant bay is San Agustín,
and that all-day trip runs $80 in a private panga (small boat).
Taking time for tennis or golf
For the more traditional sports aficionados, the 18-hole, par-72
Tangolunda Golf Course (% 958-581-0037) is adjacent to Tangolunda
Bay and has tennis courts as well. The greens fee is $73 with an extra
charge for carts. Tennis courts are also available at the Barceló hotel
(% 958-581-0055).
Sightseeing and shopping
A day in Crucecita can be enjoyable. Just off the central plaza is the
Iglesía de Guadalupe with its large mural of Mexico’s patron saint grac-
ing the entire ceiling of this church’s chapel. The image of the Virgin is
set against a deep-blue, night sky, which includes 52 stars — a modern
interpretation of the original cloak of Juan Diego.
Considering that shopping in Huatulco is generally limited, and unmem-
orable, the bays’ best choices are in Crucecita — in the shops that sur-
round the central plaza. The stores tend to stay open late and offer a
good selection of regional goods and typical, tourist take-homes includ-
ing artesanías (local crafts), silver jewelry, Cuban cigars, and tequila.
Plus, you can dine in Crucecita for a fraction of the price of dining in
Tangolunda Bay and get the added benefit of some local color.
You can also check out the Crucecita Market (open 10 a.m.–8 p.m.) 
on Guamúchil, half a block from the plaza in Crucecita, and the Plaza
Oaxaca, adjacent to the central plaza. This small shopping center has
several clothing shops including Poco Loco Club/Coconut’s Boutique
(% 958-587-0279) for casual sportswear; Mic Mac (% 958-587-0565),
featuring beachwear and souvenirs; and Sideout (% 958-587-0254) for
active wear. Coconuts (% 958-587-0057) has English-language maga-
zines, books, and music. A small, free trolley is available to take visitors
on a short tour of the town. Hop on at the central plaza.
The other main option for shopping is the Santa Cruz Market (open 
10 a.m.–8 p.m.), located by the marina in Santa Cruz. Among all the typi-
cal souvenirs, you may want to search out regional specialties that
Chapter 28: Bahías de Huatulco 377

include Oaxacan embroidered blouses and dresses and barro negro, a
pottery made from a dark clay found exclusively in the Oaxaca region.
Several shopping centers in Tangolunda Bay offer a selection of crafts
and Oaxacan goods but are pricier than the markets.
The most worthwhile sightseeing excursion in the area is the daylong
trip to Oaxaca City and Monte Albán. The tour includes round-trip air-
fare on Aerocaribe, lunch, admission to the archaeological sight of
Monte Albán, and a tour of the architectural highlights of Oaxaca City —
all for $100. Contact any travel agency or the Aerocaribe office (% 958-
587-1220) for more information.
Enjoying the nightlife
Only a very limited selection of dance clubs is available around 
Huatulco — so everyone goes to these places. Note that these seem to
change ownership and names almost annually, but the locations should
be accurate. El DexkiteLitros (% 958-587-0971) has open-air dancing 
on the Santa Cruz beachfront. Located next to the Marina Hotel on the
beach, it spins techno and rock from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. For live music,
try Magic Tropic, Paseo Mitla 304, Santa Cruz (no phone). In Crucecita,
one block has a collection of party places, including the popular Bar 
La Crema (Gardenia and Guanacaste) with a lounge style atmosphere
and a mix of tunes; La Peña, and Cafe Dublín, on Carrizal, 1 block east,
and 1⁄2 block south from the southeastern corner of the zócalo.

Brewing up some fun
Mexico’s Huatulco region is known for its rich pluma coffee, grown in the region’s
mountainous areas. Centuries-old plantations, most of which continue to use tradi-
tional methods, grow and harvest coffee beans. The majority of the plantations are
located around the mouth of the Río Copalita in small towns, including Pluma Hidalgo,
Santa María de Huatulco, and Xanica, located roughly an hour to an hour and a half
from Tangolunda Bay. Both day tours and overnight stays from Huatulco are available
to select coffee plantations.
Café Huatulco (% 958-587-0339) is a unique project developed by the area’s coffee
producers’ association to bring awareness to the region’s coffee and to offer an
unusual excursion for tourists. Café Huatulco, located in a kiosk in the central plaza of
Santa Cruz, sells whole-bean, regional coffee and serves coffee and espresso bever-
ages. The association can arrange coffee tastings for groups of six or more and
overnight stays at the coffee plantations for travelers who are really serious about
their coffee.
Paraíso Tours (% 958-581-1218; pariasohuatulco@prodigy.net.mx) also
offers an eight-hour Coffee Plantation Tour, traveling by bus to the coffee plantations
to learn first hand about the cultivation of the local coffee.

A
lthough it may be best known as Mexico’s top surf break, Puerto
Escondido has a much broader appeal — it simply offers the very
best all-around value of any beach resort in Mexico. What’s the attrac-
tion? Consider this: stellar beaches; friendly locals; and terrific and inex-
pensive dining, places to stay, and nightlife — plus an abundance of
English-language speakers and a notable absence of beach vendors and
timeshare salespeople. But if you’re traveling with children, Puerto
Escondido may not be the perfect fit — it’s really a better choice for
young adults or more adventurous travelers.
In this chapter, I cover the best of Puerto Escondido — where to stay
and dine and where to find the best adventures. I also offer tips on
everything from transportation to where to find the best nightlife.
Evaluating the Top Accommodations
The town of Puerto Escondido is very small — all the hotels are in or
bordering the town. The main pedestrians-only zone is known locally as
the Adoquín after the hexagonal-shaped, interlocking bricks used in its
paving. The hotels along Playa Zicatela really cater to surfers.
As far as prices go, I note rack rates (the maximum that a hotel or resort
charges for a room) for two people spending one night in a double room
during high season (Christmas to Easter). You can usually do better,
especially if you’re purchasing a package that includes airfare (read
Chapter 7 for tips on avoiding paying rack rates). Prices quoted here
include the 17 percent room tax. Please refer to the Introduction of this
book for an explanation of the price categories.

The hotels that I list here have both air-conditioning and TVs, unless
otherwise indicated; and if the review doesn’t say anything to the con-
trary, you can safely assume that you can walk directly out of your hotel
and onto the beach.
Arcoíris Hotel

Playa Zicatela
This hotel offers a winning combination of Zicatela’s laid-back charms,
together with more amenities and services than the nearby bare-bones
surfer hotels, making it a good choice for families. Rooms are located on
three levels in this Mexican colonial-style inn, and all have large balconies
or terraces that face either Playa Zicatela or an interior garden. You can
string a hammock up on the balcony — a common sight, with no air-
conditioning in the rooms — and relax away the afternoon. Ground-floor
rooms are sans TV, while upper-level rooms have satellite TV. About half
of the rooms have a small kitchenette. Hotel amenities include a smallish
swimming pool, game room with satellite TV, bookstore, and pharmacy, as
well as a restaurant and popular rooftop bar — one of Playa Zicatela’s
favorite spots for sunset-watching and happy hour. The attentive staff is a
plus.

Best Western Posada Real
$$$
Playa Bacocho
Set on top of a cliff overlooking Playa Bacocho just west of town, this prop-
erty is the area’s best choice for family travelers. The clean but smallish
standard rooms are less enticing than the hotel grounds, which include an
expansive, manicured lawn that is one of the most popular places in town
for a sunset cocktail. A big plus here is the hotel’s Coco’s Beach Club — a
.8km (1⁄2-mile) stretch of soft-sand beach, a large swimming pool, a kid’s
playground, and a bar with swing-style chairs and occasional live music.
A shuttle service (or a lengthy walk down a set of stairs) takes you to the
beach club, which is also open to the public ($2.50 cover for non-guests).
The hotel is located only five minutes from the airport and about the same
distance from Puerto Escondido’s Tourist Zone — you must take a taxi to
get to town. In addition to Coco’s, the hotel has two restaurants and a
lobby bar plus two swimming pools — one is a wading pool for children —
tennis courts, and a putting green. It’s the most traditional (hotel-chain
style) hotel I recommend in Puerto Escondido.

Playa Zicatela
Facing Playa Zicatela, this surfer’s sanctuary offers clean, cheap accom-
modations plus an on-site gym, surf shop, vegetarian restaurant, and
Internet cafe. The two-story hotel and the bungalows surround a pool
shaded by great palms. Rooms are small and basic, but bungalows offer
fundamental kitchen facilities. The cabañas are more open and have ham-
mocks. Parking, public telephones, money-exchange facilities, a pharmacy,
and the vegetarian restaurant (Mango’s) are located in the adjoining com-
mercial area. The well-equipped gym costs an extra $1 per day or $15 per
month.

Flor de María
$
Playa Marinero
Though not right on the beach, this hotel is a real find and very popular
with older travelers. Canadians María and Lino Francato own this cheery,
three-story hotel facing the ocean, which you can see from the rooftop.
The structure is built around a garden courtyard, and each room is color-
fully decorated with beautiful, realistic still lifes and landscapes painted
by Lino. Two rooms have windows with a view; the rest face into the court-
yard. All have double beds with orthopedic mattresses and small safes.
The roof, in addition to the great view, has a small pool, a shaded ham-
mock terrace, and an open-air bar (open 5–9 p.m. during high season) with
a TV that receives U.S. channels. All in all, the roof is a great sunset spot.
I highly recommend the first-floor María’s Restaurant (see the “Dining in
Puerto Escondido” section, later in this chapter). Ask about off-season dis-
counts for long-term stays. The hotel is just steps from the center of town
and up a sandy road from Playa Marinero on an unnamed street at the east-
ern end of the beach.

Tourist Zone
If you want to be in the heart of the Adoquín, this hotel is your best bet for
excellent value and clean, ample accommodations; plus it’s just a block
from the main beach. The courtyard pool and adjacent palapa (thatched
roof) restaurant is a great place to hide away and enjoy a margarita or a
book from the hotel’s exchange rack. The bright, clean, and simply fur-
nished rooms offer a choice of bed combinations, but all have at least two
beds and a fan. Some rooms have air-conditioning and a minifridge. The

you’re a light sleeper, consider a room in the back. Some rooms can sleep
up to five ($60), an excellent and economical choice for families.

Hotel Santa Fe
$$$
Playa Zicatela
If Puerto Escondido is Mexico’s best beach value, then the Santa Fe is with-
out a doubt one of the best hotel values — and a personal, all-around
favorite of mine. It has a winning combination of unique Spanish-colonial
style, a welcoming staff, and clean, comfortable rooms. The hotel has
grown up over the years alongside the surfers who came to Puerto in the
1960s and 1970s — and nostalgically return today. It’s located about 1km
(2⁄3 mile) southeast of the town center off Highway 200, at the curve in the
road where playas Marinero and Zicatela join — a prime sunset-watching
spot. The three-story, hacienda-style buildings have clay-tiled stairs, arch-
ways, and blooming vines surrounding the two courtyard swimming pools.
The ample but simply stylish rooms feature large tile bathrooms, colonial
furnishings, handwoven fabrics, Guerrero pottery lamps, and TVs with
local channels only. Most rooms have a balcony or terrace — ocean views
on upper floors. Bungalows are next to the hotel, and each has a living
room, kitchen, and bedroom with two double beds. The Restaurant Santa
Fe is one of the best on the southern Pacific coast (see the “Dining in
Puerto Escondido” section, later in this chapter).

Paraíso Escondido

Tourist Zone
The curious collection of Mexican folk art, masks, religious art, and paintings
on the walls make this eclectic inn an exercise in Mexican magic realism in
addition to a tranquil place to stay. An inviting pool, surrounded by gardens,
Adirondack chairs, a restaurant, and a fountain, has a commanding view of
the bay — but it’s several blocks to the main public beach in town. Each
room has one double and one twin bed, a built-in desk, and a cozy balcony
or terrace with French doors. Each has a slightly different decorative accent,
and all are very clean. The suites have a much more deluxe décor than the
rooms and feature recessed lighting, desks set into bay windows with
French-paned windows, living areas, and large private balconies. The pent-
house suite has its own whirlpool tub and kitchenette plus a tile chessboard
inlaid in the floor and murals adorning the walls — it’s the owners’ former
apartment. Limited free parking is available in front of the hotel.

Settling into Puerto Escondido
Puerto Escondido’s very small airport is about 4km (21⁄2 miles) north of
the center of town near Playa Bacocho. A trip on the collective minibus
to your hotel is $2.25 per person. Transportes Terrestres sells colectivo
tickets to the airport through Turismo Dimar Travel Agency (%/fax
954-582-1551) on Avenida Pérez Gasga (the pedestrian-only zone) next
to Hotel Casa Blanca. The minibus can pick you up at your hotel.
Flying directly into Puerto Escondido can be a challenge. I find it gener-
ally easier (and less expensive) to fly into the Huatulco airport via
scheduled or charter flights. An airport taxi costs $85 between Huatulco
and Puerto Escondido. If you can find a local taxi, rather than the gov-
ernment-chartered cabs, you can reduce this fare by about 50 percent,
including the payment of a $5 mandatory airport exit tax. Frequent bus
service also travels between the two destinations. Budget Car Rental
has cars available for one-way travel to Puerto Escondido with an added
drop charge of about $10. In Puerto Escondido, Budget is located at the
entrance to Playa Bacocho (% 954-582-0312). By car, the trip from
Huatulco to Puerto Escondido takes just under two hours. Because the
roads are unlit and frequently curvy through a mountainous zone, plan
on traveling only during daylight hours.
Knowing your way around town
Looking out on the Bahía Principal and its beach, to your left is the east-
ern end of the bay consisting of a small beach, Playa Marinero, followed
by rocks jutting into the sea. Beyond this is Playa Zicatela, unmistakably
the main surfing beach. Playa Zicatela has really come into its own as
the most popular area for visitors with restaurants, bungalows, surf
shops, and hotels located well back from the shoreline. The western side
of the bay, to your right, is about 1.6km (1 mile) long with a lighthouse
and low green hills descending to meet a long stretch of fine sand.
Beaches on this end aren’t quite as accessible by land as those to the
east, but hotels are overcoming this difficulty by constructing beach
clubs accessed by steep private roads and Jeep shuttles.

The telephone area code is 954.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Banamex, Bancomer, Bancrear, and Banco
Bital all have branches in town, and all

each bank’s hours vary, but you can gener-
ally find one of them open Monday to
Saturday 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. ATMs and 
currency-exchange offices are also located

Chapter 29: Puerto Escondido 385
The town of Puerto Escondido has roughly an east-west orientation with
the long Playa Zicatela turning sharply southeast. Residential areas
behind (east of) Playa Zicatela tend to have unpaved streets; the older
town (with paved streets) is north of the Carretera Costera (Hwy. 200).
The streets are numbered — Avenida Oaxaca serves as the dividing line
between east (este) and west (oeste), and Avenida Hidalgo acts as the
divider between north (norte) and south (sur).
North of Zicatela is the old town, through which Avenida Pérez Gasga
makes a loop. Part of this loop is a paved, pedestrian-only zone, known
as the Adoquín. Hotels, shops, restaurants, bars, travel agencies, and
other services are all conveniently located here. In the morning, taxis,
delivery trucks, and private vehicles are allowed to drive here, but at
noon it’s closed off to all but foot traffic.
Avenida Pérez Gasga angles down from the highway at the east end of
the Adoquín; on the west, where the Adoquín terminates, it climbs in a
wide northward curve to cross the highway, after which it becomes
Avenida Oaxaca.
The beaches — Playa Principal in the center of town and Marinero and
Zicatela southeast of the town center — are interconnected. Walking
from one to the other crossing behind the separating rocks is easy.
Puerto Angelito, Carrizalillo, and Bacocho beaches are west of town, and
you can reach them by road or water. Playa Bacocho hosts the few more-
expensive hotels located in Puerto Escondido.
Getting around Puerto Escondido
Almost everything is within walking distance of the Adoquín. Taxis are
inexpensive when traveling around town; call % 954-582-0990 or 582-
0955 for service.
Hiring a boat is easy, but you can walk beside the sea from Playa
Principal to the tiny beach of Puerto Angelito, though it’s a bit of a hike.

day, but during low season, they close
between 2 and 5 p.m. Offices tend to close
on Saturday and Sunday. Shops are usually
open on Saturday but still generally respect
the tradition of closing on Sunday. 
Hospitals
Try Unidad Médico-Quirúrgica del Sur (Av.
Oaxaca 113; % 954-582-1288), which offers
24-hour emergency services and has an
English-speaking staff and doctors.
Information
The State Tourist Office, SEDETUR (% 954-
582-0175), is about 1km (2⁄3 mile) from the
airport at the corner of Carretera Costera
and Bulevar Benito Juárez. It’s open
Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Saturday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. A kiosk at the air-
port is open for incoming flights during high
season, and another, near the west end of
the paved Tourist Zone, is open Monday to
Saturday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Internet Access
Cyber-café is a small, extremely busy
Internet service at the entrance to the
Bungalows and Cabañas Acuario (Calle de
Morro s/n; % 954-582-0357, ask for the
cybercafe). It’s open daily 8 a.m. until 9 p.m.
The rate to get online is $1.50 for 15 minutes,
$3 for a half-hour, or $5 per hour. Graficom

Post Office
The post office is on Avenida Oaxaca at the
corner of Avenida 7 Norte (% 954-582-0959).
It’s open Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Safety
Depending on whom you talk to, you need to
be wary of potential beach muggings, prima-
rily at night. However, the hope is that the
new public lighting at Playa Principal and
Playa Zicatela goes a long way in preventing
these incidents. Local residents say most
incidents happen after tourists overindulge
and then go for a midnight stroll along the
beach. Puerto Escondido is so casual that
letting your guard down is easy, but don’t
carry valuables, and use common sense and
normal precautions. Also, respect the power
of the magnificent waves here. Drownings
occur all too frequently.
Taxes
A 15 percent value added tax (IVA) is
charged on goods and services, and it’s
generally included in the posted price.
Taxis
Taxis are easy to find around town. They’re
also inexpensive, generally costing $1 to $3
for various parts of town; call % 954-582-
0990 or 582-0955 for service.
Telephone
Numerous businesses offer long-distance
telephone service. Many of these establish-
ments are along the Adoquín, and several
accept credit cards. 
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
Part VIII: Huatulco and the Southern Pacific Coast 
386

by using a Telmex (LADATEL) prepaid phone
card, available at most pharmacies and
mini-supers, using the official Telmex 
(Lada) public phones. Remember, in
Mexico, you need to dial 001 prior to a
number to reach the United States, and you
need to preface long-distance calls within
Mexico by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Puerto Escondido operates on central stan-
dard time, although Mexico’s observance of
daylight saving time varies somewhat from
that in the United States.

Dining in Puerto Escondido
I find dining in Puerto Escondido an absolute pleasure. The food is 
excellent — generous portions display innovative flavorings at some of
the lowest prices I’ve ever seen anywhere. The atmosphere is exceed-
ingly casual — but don’t let that throw you. I’ve enjoyed some very
memorable meals in these funky settings, starting with the mango
éclairs at El Cafecito. In fact, Puerto Escondido is even more casual than
Mexico’s other beach resorts — no need to even think about bringing
dressy attire or jackets. Personally, I think that Playa Zicatela has the
highest concentration of great eats.
All the restaurants I include in the listings are arranged alphabetically
with their location and general price category noted. Remember that
tips generally run about 15 percent, and most waitstaff really depend on
these for their income, so be generous if the service warrants.
In addition to the places I list in this section, the palapa restaurants on
Playa Zicatela are a Puerto Escondido tradition for early-morning surfer
breakfasts or casual dining and drinks by the sea at night. One of the
most popular palapa restaurants is Los Tíos, offering very economical
prices and surfer-sized portions. After dinner, enjoy homemade Italian
ice cream from Gelateria Giardino. It has two locations, on Calle del
Morro at Zicatela Beach, and Pérez Gasga 609, on the Adoquín (% 954-
582-2243).

“Where Legends Are Born” is the logo at this beachfront restaurant, and
the local crowd craves chef Gary’s special sauces that top his grilled fish,
shrimp, steaks, and ribs. Favorites include his dill-Dijon mustard, wine-
fennel, and Thai-curry sauces. But you can’t count on these sauces always
being on the menu because Gary buys what’s fresh and then goes from
there. An added bonus is that Cabo Blanco turns into a hot bar on Playa
Zicatela with special parties on Mondays featuring all-you-can-eat plus
dancing, and a Friday night reggae dance. Gary’s wife Roxana and a top-
notch team of bartenders keep the crowd well served and well behaved.

With a motto of “Big waves, strong coffee!” this cafe opened several years

its amiable proprietor, Carmen. El Cafecito features an array of unforget-
table pastries to start your day, and is also open for lunch and dinner. This
restaurant actually spans two facing corners; the northern corner is set
up more for coffee or a light snack with oceanfront bistro-style seating.
The southern corner offers a more relaxed setting with wicker chairs and
Oaxacan cloth-topped tables set under a palapa roof. Giant shrimp din-
ners are priced under $5, and the creative, daily specials are always a sure
bet. An oversized mug of cappuccino is $1, a fresh and filling fruit smoothie
goes for $1.50, and Carmen’s mango éclairs — I’d pay any price — are a
steal at $1.

Having Fun on and off the Beach
Playa Principal is the main beach in town where small boats are avail-
able for fishing and tour services. Playa Principal and the adjacent Playa
Marinero are the best swimming beaches. Beach chairs and sun shades
rent for about $2, a charge that may be waived if you order food or
drinks from the restaurants that offer them.
Playa Zicatela, a world-class surf spot, adjoins Playa Marinero about
2.5km (11⁄2 miles) from Puerto Escondido’s town center and extends to
the southeast for several miles. Due to the size and strength of the
waves here, it’s not a swimming beach, and only experienced surfers
should attempt to ride Zicatela’s powerful waves. A surfing competition
is held each August, and Fiesta Puerto Escondido, held for at least three
days each November, also celebrates Puerto Escondido’s renowned
waves. (The tourism office can supply exact dates and details; call 
% 954-582-0175.) Beginning surfers often start out at Playa Marinero
before graduating to Zicatela’s awesome waves.
New, stadium-style lighting has recently been installed in both of 
these beach areas in an attempt to crack down on nocturnal beach 
muggings. The lights have diminished the appeal of the Playa Principal
restaurants — you look into bright lights rather than at the nighttime
sea now. Lifeguard service has recently been added to Playa Zicatela.
Barter with one of the fishermen on the main beach for a ride to Playa
Manzanillo and Puerto Angelito, two beaches separated by a rocky out-
cropping (the best way to get here is by boat). Here, and at other small
coves just west of town, swimming is safe and the overall atmosphere is
calmer than it is in town. You can also find palapas, hammock rentals,
and snorkeling equipment — the clear blue water is perfect for snorkel-
ing. Enjoy fresh fish, tamales, and other Mexican dishes cooked right at
the beach by local entrepreneurs. Puerto Angelito is also accessible by 
a dirt road that’s a short distance from town, so it tends to be busier.
Playa Bacocho is on a shallow cove farther to the northwest and is best
reached by taxi or boat rather than walking. It’s also the location of
Coco’s Beach Club at the Best Western Posada Real. It’s open to the
public for a cover charge of $2.50, which gains you access to the pools,
food and beverage service, and facilities.

groups on both eco-adventures and cultural explorations. Tours into the
surrounding mountains include a five-hour horseback excursion up to
the jungle region of the Chatino healing hot springs and a trip to Nopala,
a Chatino mountain village, and a neighboring coffee plantation. An all-
day trip to Jamiltepec (a small, traditional regional Indian community
called a Mixtex village) offers the opportunity to experience day-to-day
life in an authentic village. The visit includes stops at a market, the
church, the cemetery, and the homes of local artisans.

dimar@hotmail.com), on the landward side of the Adoquín, is an excel-
lent source of information and can arrange all types of tours and travel.
It’s open daily 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Manager Gaudencio Díaz speaks English
and can arrange individualized tours or more standard ones such as
Michael Malone’s Hidden Voyages Ecotours. Malone, a Canadian
ornithologist, takes you on a dawn or sunset trip to Manialtepec
Lagoon, a bird-filled mangrove lagoon about 19km (12 miles) northwest
of Puerto Escondido. The cost is $32 and includes a stop on a secluded
beach for a swim.
Chapter 29: Puerto Escondido 391

Another reputable agency is Cantera Tours (Av. Pérez Gazga at Andador
Gloria; % 954-582-1926 or 582-1927; Fax: 954-582-1926). 
One of the most popular all-day tours offered by both companies is a
trip to Chacahua Lagoon National Park, about 68km (42 miles) west of
Puerto, at a cost of $38 with Dimar or $25 with Ana’s. These excursions
are true ecotours — small groups treading lightly. You visit a beautiful
sandy spit of beach and the lagoon, which has an incredible array of
birds and flowers including black orchids. Locals provide fresh barbe-
cued fish on the beach. If you know Spanish and get information from
the tourism office, staying overnight under a small palapa is possible,
but bring plenty of insect repellent.
An interesting and slightly out-of-the-ordinary excursion is Aventura
Submarina (Av. Pérez Gasga 601A, in front of the tourism office; % 954-
582-2353). Jorge, who speaks fluent English and is a certified scuba
instructor, guides individuals and small groups of qualified divers along
the Coco trench just offshore. The price is $55 for a two-tank dive. This
outfit offers a refresher scuba course at no extra charge. Jorge also
arranges surface activities such as deep-sea fishing, surfing, and trips 
to lesser-known yet nearby swimming beaches.
Fishermen keep their colorful pangas (small boats) on the beach beside
the Adoquín. A fisherman’s tour around the coastline in a panga costs
about $35, but a ride to Playa Zicatela or Puerto Angelito is only $10.
Most hotels offer or gladly arrange tours to meet your needs.
A Mixtec Ceremonial Center was discovered in early 2000 just east of
Puerto Escondido and is considered a major discovery. The site covers
many acres with about 10 pyramids and a ball court, with the pyramids
appearing as hills covered in vegetation. A number of large carved
stones have been found. Situated on a hilltop, it commands a spectacu-
lar view of Puerto Escondido and the Pacific coast. The large archaeolog-
ical site spans several privately-owned plots of land, and is not open to
the public, although Gina, “the information goddess” (see information,
above), has been known to offer a guided walking tour to it. 
Planning a side trip to Puerto Angel 
and Playa Zipolite
About 80km (50 miles) southeast of Puerto Escondido and 48km 
(30 miles) northwest of the Bahías de Huatulco is the tiny fishing port of
Puerto Angel (not to be confused with Puerto Angelito, which is a beach
in Puerto Escondido). Puerto Angel, with its beautiful beaches, unpaved
streets, and budget hotels, is popular with the international backpacking
set and travelers seeking an inexpensive and restful vacation. Its small
bay and several inlets offer peaceful swimming and good snorkeling. The
village follows a slow and simple way of life: Fishermen leave very early
in the morning and return with their catch shortly before noon.
Part VIII: Huatulco and the Southern Pacific Coast 
392

The golden sands and peaceful village life of Puerto Angel are the rea-
sons to visit. Playa Principal, the main beach, lies between the Mexican
navy base and the pier that’s home to the local fishing fleet. Near the
pier, fishermen pull their colorful boats on the beach and unload their
catch in the late morning while trucks wait to haul it off to processing
plants in Veracruz. The rest of the beach seems light years away from
the world of work and purpose. Except on Mexican holidays, it’s rela-
tively deserted.
The beaches around Puerto Escondido and Puerto Angel (located
between Huatulco and Puerto Escondido) are important turtle nesting
grounds for the endangered Ridley sea turtle. During the summer months,
tourists can sometimes see the turtles laying eggs or observe the hatch-
lings trekking to the sea. Playa Escobilla, near Puerto Escondido, and
Playa Barra de la Cruz, near Puerto Angel, seem to be the favored nest-
ing grounds of this species.
In 1991, the Mexican government established the Centro Mexicano la
Tortuga, known locally as the Turtle Museum, for the study and life
enhancement of the turtle. Examples of all species of marine turtles
living in Mexico are on view, plus six species of freshwater turtles and
two species of land turtles. The center is located on Playa Mazunte near
the town of the same name. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tuesday to
Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; entry is $2.50.
Mazunte is also home to a unique shop that sells naturally produced
shampoos, bath oils, and other personal-care products. The local com-
munity women make and package all the products as part of a project to
replace the income lost from turtle poaching. The products are excellent
in quality, and purchasing them goes a long way in ensuring the cessa-
tion of turtle poaching in the community. Buses go to Mazunte from
Puerto Angel about every half-hour, and a taxi ride is around $5.50. You
can fit this trip in with a visit to Playa Zipolite, the next one closer to
Puerto Angel.
Playa Panteón is the main swimming and snorkeling beach. “Cemetery
Beach,” ominous as that sounds, is about a 15-minute walk from the
center of town. Just walk straight through town on the main street that
skirts the beach. The panteón (cemetery), which is also worth a visit
with its brightly colored tombstones backed by equally brilliant bloom-
ing vines, is on the right.
In Playa Panteón, some of the palapa restaurants and a few of the hotels
rent snorkeling and scuba gear and can arrange boat trips, but they all
tend to be rather expensive. Check the quality and the condition of the
gear — particularly scuba gear — that you rent.
Playa Zipolite and its village are 6km (4 miles) down a paved road from
Puerto Angel. Taxis charge around $1 to $1.50 (taxis are relatively inex-
pensive here), or you can catch a colectivo on the main street in the
town center and share the cost.
Chapter 29: Puerto Escondido 393

Zipolite is well known as a good surf break and nude beach. Although
public nudity (including topless sunbathing) is technically against the
law throughout Mexico, it’s allowed here — one of only a handful of
beaches in Mexico to allow it. This sort of open-mindedness has
attracted an increasing number of young European travelers. Most sun-
bathers concentrate beyond a large rock outcropping at the far end of
the beach. Police occasionally patrol the area, but they’re much more
intent on searching for drug users than harassing au natural sunbathers.
Spots to tie up a hammock and a few palapa restaurants where you can
grab a light lunch and a cold beer dot the beach.
In Zipolite, as in the rest of Mexico, the purchase, sale, or use of drugs is
definitely against the law, no matter what the local custom may be (and
their use is relatively customary here). Because the ocean currents are
quite strong (that’s why the surf is so good!), a number of drownings
have occurred over the years — so, know your limits.
If you’re traveling here by car, you arrive via Highway 200 from the north
or south. Take coastal Highway 175 inland to Puerto Angel. The road is
well marked with signs leading to Puerto Angel. From either Huatulco or
Puerto Escondido, the trip takes about an hour.
Taxis are a readily available to take you to Puerto Angel, Playa Zipolite,
the Huatulco airport, or Puerto Escondido for a reasonable price.
Shopping in Puerto Escondido
The Adoquín sports a row of tourist shops selling straw hats, postcards,
and Puerto Escondido T-shirts, and a few excellent shops feature
Guatemalan, Oaxacan, and Balinese clothing and art. You can also get a
tattoo or rent surfboards and bodyboards here. Pharmacies and mini-
markets for basic necessities are interspersed among the shops, hotels,
restaurants, and bars.
The largest of these mini-marts is Oh! Mar (Av. Pérez Gasga 502; % 954-
582-3056), which not only sells anything you’d need for a day at the
beach but also sells phone (LADATEL) cards, stamps, and Cuban cigars.
Plus, the store has a mail drop box and arranges fishing tours.
During high season, businesses and shops are generally open all day, but
during low season, they close between 2 and 5 p.m. Some highlights
along the Adoquín include:
 Bazaar Santa Fe (in the Hotel Santa Fe lobby, on Playa Zicatela,
Calle del Morro s/n; % 954-582-0170), which sells antiques includ-
ing vintage Oaxacan embroidered clothing, jewelry, and religious
artifacts.
 Central Surf shops are located on the Adoquín (% 954-582-0568)
and on Playa Zicatela (Calle Morro s/n; % 954-582-2285). The stores
rent and sell surfboards and related gear and offer surf lessons.
Part VIII: Huatulco and the Southern Pacific Coast 
394

 Bikini Brazil (Calle de Morro s/n, Zicatela Beach; no phone), where
you’ll find super-hot bikinis imported from Brazil, land of the tanga.
Shops are located on the Adoquín (% 954-582-0568) and on Playa
Zicatela (Calle Morro s/n; % 954-582-2285). The stores rent and
sell surfboards and related gear and offer surf lessons.
 360 Surf Shop sells everything for your out-of-town surf needs, 
as well as sells, trades, and rents boards. Board rentals start at 
$10 per day, with lessons available for $20. They don’t have a
phone number, but you can contact them by e-mailing 360@puerto
connection.com.
 Just in front of the Rockaway Resort on Playa Zicatela, a 24-hour
mini-super (no phone) sells the basic necessities: beer, suntan
lotion, and basic food supplies.
Enjoying the nightlife
As hot as the daytime surf action is in Puerto Escondido, the nocturnal
offerings offer some stiff competition that can make catching those first
morning waves somewhat of a challenge.
Sunset-watching is a ritual to plan your day around, and good lookout
points abound here. Watch the surfers at Zicatela and catch up on local
gossip at La Galería (Calle del Morro s/n; % 958-582-0432), upstairs on
the third floor of the Arcoíris hotel. La Galería has a nightly happy hour
(with live music during high season) from 5 to 7 p.m. For other great
sunset spots, head to the Hotel Santa Fe at the junction of playas
Zicatela and Marinero or the rooftop bar of Hotel Flor de María. For a
more tranquil, romantic setting, take a cab or walk half an hour or so
west to the Best Western Posada Real. The hotel’s cliff-top lawn is a per-
fect sunset perch. You can also climb down the cliff (or take the Posada
Real’s shuttle bus) to Coco’s on the beach below.
When it comes to bars and clubs, Puerto has a nightlife that satisfies
anyone dedicated to late nights and good music. Along the Adoquín, here
are some spots that may lure you in:
 Bar Fly, The Blue Iguana, and Rayos X cater to a younger surf
crowd with DJs spinning alternative, house, and techno tunes.
 Located across the street, Wipeout is a multilevel club that packs
in the crowds until 4 a.m.
 The Bucanero Bar and Grill has a good-sized bar and outdoor
patio fronting Playa Principal.
 Montezuma’s Revenge has live bands usually playing contempo-
rary Latin American music.
 Son y la Rumba is home to live jazz featuring its house band with
Andria Garcia playing each night 8 to 11 p.m. with a $1 cover.
Wednesdays through Saturdays, it switches over to DJs playing
Chapter 29: Puerto Escondido 395

house music after 11 p.m. This club is located beneath the Un Tigre
Azul, on the western end of the Adoquín.
 El Tubo is an open-air, beachside disco just west of Restaurant
Alicia on the Adoquín.
Also downtown is Tequila Sunrise, a spacious two-story disco overlook-
ing the beach. It plays Latino, reggae, cumbia, tropical, and salsa. It’s a
half-block from the Adoquín on Avenida Marina Nacional. A small cover
charge ($1.20–$2.40) generally applies.
Out on Zicatela, don’t miss Cabo Blanco’s (see the “Dining in Puerto
Escondido” section, earlier in this chapter) Monday night dine and
dance party (all you can eat), or their Friday reggae night. Split Coco,
just a few doors down, has live music on Tuesdays and Fridays and TV
sports on other nights. It has one of the most popular happy hours on
the beach and serves barbecue as well.
There’s a new movie theater on Playa Zicatela — PJ’s Book Bodega and
Music Shop. It’s a pretty simple setup consisting of a large screen and
some beach chairs, and it serves up popcorn and movies nightly.
Most nightspots are open until 3 a.m. or until the customers leave.

Part IX
Los Cabos and
Southern Baja

In this part . . . 
C
abo San Lucas, San José del Cabo, and the stretch of
coastline (the Corridor) that connects them are collec-
tively known as Los Cabos (The Capes). They’re located at
the tip of Mexico’s Baja Peninsula. “The end of the line,” “the
last resort,” and “no man’s land” are all terms used in the past
to describe Mexico’s remote but diverse Baja Sur, an exquisite
setting that artfully blends desert landscapes with vibrant
seascapes. With seven championship golf courses open for
play, golf has overtaken sportﬁshing as the main draw here.
Other activities you can ﬁnd in Cabos to keep you busy are
sea kayaking, whale-watching, diving, surﬁng, and hiking.
In the next four chapters, you discover the differences
between the three distinct parts of Los Cabos and their
unique attractions. And you get clued in on the best places to
stay and dine, great things to do, and the craziest spots for
nighttime diversion.

Chapter 30
The Lowdown on the Hotel
Scene in Los Cabos
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Laying out the hotel locations
 Reviewing the top hotel choices in Los Cabos
P
art of the attraction of the towns of Los Cabos — on the tip of the
Baja Peninsula — seems to be the feeling that they’re an extension
of Southern California’s brand of American style — luxury accommoda-
tions, golf courses, shopping, franchise restaurants, and a spirited
nightlife. Cabo San Lucas has retained its boisterous, party-town tradi-
tions, and San José del Cabo still has the appearance and ambience of a
quaint Mexican town, though in recent years, it is becoming more and
more gentrified. 
Nearly 30km (18 miles) of smooth highway, known as the Corridor, lie
between the two Cabos. Along this stretch of pavement, major new
resorts, including some of the world’s finest golf courses and residential
communities, have developed. And the area’s signature natural beauty
continues to beckon: Dozens of pristine coves and inlets with a wealth of
marine life just offshore greet visitors.
The Los Cabos area has earned a deserved reputation for being much
higher priced than other Mexican resorts. Although a boom in new hotel
construction has occurred, these new properties have all been luxury
resorts — solidifying Los Cabos’ higher average room prices, not adjust-
ing prices downward with the added supply of rooms. The other factor
driving up prices here is that compared to mainland Mexico, little agri-
cultural activity takes place in Baja; most foodstuffs (and other daily
required items) must be shipped into the area. U.S. dollars are the pre-
ferred currency here, and seeing price listings in dollars rather than
pesos isn’t uncommon.

In this chapter, I review the two main towns, the Corridor between them,
and the types of hotel rooms you’re likely to find in each as well as the
pros and cons of staying in each area. Then, I run down a selection of my
favorite places to stay in Los Cabos. The accommodation options are so
varied here that no matter your taste or budget, you’re sure to find the
perfect fit for a satisfying vacation.
Choosing a Location
Los Cabos is actually three destinations in one — the traditional town of
San José, the rowdy party town of Cabo San Lucas, and the luxury-lined
corridor between the two. Where you stay impacts your overall experi-
ence, although you can move around from one location to another — for
a price. My hotel recommendations extend through this entire area.
San José del Cabo, located closest to the airport, has pastel cottages and
flowering trees lining its narrow streets, retaining the air of a provincial
Mexican town. Originally founded in 1730 by Jesuit missionaries, it’s the
seat of the Los Cabos government and the center of the region’s busi-
ness community. The main square, adorned with a wrought-iron band-
stand and shaded benches, faces the cathedral, which was built on the
site of an early mission.
San José is becoming increasingly sophisticated. A collection of note-
worthy cafes, art galleries, and intriguing small inns adds a newly refined
flavor to the central downtown area. Still, San José is the best choice for
travelers who want to travel to this paradoxical Mexican landscape but
still be aware that they’re in Mexico. Most of the hotels I list here are
found in the town — that is, away from the beaches of San José, but not
so far away that it’s an inconvenience.
The Corridor between the towns of San José del Cabo and Cabo San
Lucas contains some of Mexico’s most lavish resorts designed as self-
contained dream getaways. Most growth in this area is occurring along
the Corridor, which has already become a major international locale for
championship golf. The three major resort areas are Palmilla, Cabo Real,
and Cabo del Sol. Each location is a self-enclosed community with golf
courses, elegant hotels, and million-dollar homes.
If you plan to explore the region while staying at a Corridor hotel, con-
sider renting a car for at least a day or two for easier access; cars are
available at the hotels. Even if you’re not staying here, the beaches and
dining options are worth a visit. All the hotels along the Corridor qualify
as “very expensive” selections. Golf and fishing packages are available at
most resorts.
The hundreds of luxury hotel rooms along the Corridor to the north of
Cabo San Lucas have transformed the very essence of this formerly
rustic and rowdy outpost. Although it still retains a boisterous nightlife
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
400

that runs counter to the pampered services that surround it, Cabo San
Lucas is no longer the simple town John Steinbeck wrote about and
enjoyed. Once legendary for the big-game fish that lurk beneath the
deep blue sea, Cabo San Lucas now draws more people for its nearby
fairways and greens — and the world-class golf played on them. Today, it
caters to a traveler getting away for a long weekend or indulgent stay of
sport and relaxation. Cabo San Lucas has become Mexico’s most elite
resort destination.
Travelers here enjoy a growing roster of adventure-oriented activities,
and playtime doesn’t end when the sun goes down. The nightlife here is
as hot as the desert in July and oddly casual, having grown up away
from the higher-end hotels. It remains the raucous, playful party scene
that helped put Cabo on the map. A collection of popular restaurants
and bars, spread along Cabo’s main street, stay open and active until the
morning’s first fishing charters head out to sea. Despite the growth in
diversions, Cabo remains more or less a “one-stoplight” town with most
everything located along the main strip within easy walking distance.
Budget accommodations are scarce in Cabo San Lucas, but a number of
small inns and B&Bs, with several notable ones, fit the bill nicely. Because
most of the larger hotels are well maintained, and packages are available
through travel agents, I focus on the smaller, more unique accommoda-
tions available in Cabo San Lucas.
Best Accommodations in Los Cabos
There’s more demand than supply for hotel rooms in the Corridor, so
prices tend to be higher than equivalent accommodations in other parts
of Mexico. San José has only a handful of budget hotels, so call ahead for
reservations if you want economical accommodations. In the town of
San José, you’ll find smaller inns, or B&Bs, offering stylish accommoda-
tions. The beachfront Hotel Zone in San José often offers package deals
that bring room rates down to the moderate range, especially during
summer months. Shop around or check with your travel agent.
For each hotel, I include specific rack rates for two people spending one
night in a double room during high season (Christmas to Easter), unless
otherwise indicated. Keep in mind that summer rates are about 20 per-
cent less. Rack rates simply mean published rates, and tend to be the
highest rate paid — you can do better, especially if you’re purchasing a
package that includes airfare (read Chapter 7 for tips on avoiding paying
rack rates). Please refer to the Introduction of this book for an explana-
tion of the price categories.
Many hotels double their normal rates during Christmas and Easter
weeks. Note that some rates may seem much higher than others — until
you realize that they’re “all-inclusive” — meaning that your meals and
beverages are included in the price of your stay. This rate also includes
all tips and taxes and most activities and entertainment.
Chapter 30: The Lowdown on the Hotel Scene in Los Cabos 401

All hotels I list here have both air-conditioning and TVs, unless other-
wise indicated; if the review doesn’t say anything to the contrary, you
can safely assume that you can walk directly out of your hotel and onto
the beach.
The Bungalows
$$
Cabo San Lucas
The Bungalows is one of the most special places to stay in Los Cabos. Each
“bungalow” is a charming retreat decorated with authentic Mexican fur-
nishings. Terra-cotta tiles, hand-painted sinks, wooden chests, blown glass,
and other creative touches make you feel as if you’re a guest at a friend’s
home rather than in a hotel. Each room has a kitchenette, a private bath,
purified water, a TV with VCR, and designer bedding. The varied bunga-
lows, which include eight one-bedrooms, two deluxe one-bedrooms, and
six two-bedrooms, surround a lovely heated pool with cushioned lounges
and tropical gardens — but the nearest beach is a few miles away. You can
enjoy fountains and flowers throughout the grounds, and a brick-paved
breakfast nook serves a complete gourmet breakfast daily including fresh-
ground coffee and fresh juices. The breakfast nook is also where guests
become friends and share travel tips and experiences. Under the warm and
welcoming management, this is Cabo’s most spacious and comfortable full-
service inn with exceptionally helpful service. A 100-percent smoke-free
environment, the property is located 5 blocks from downtown Cabo.

Cabo Inn
$–$$
Cabo San Lucas
This three-story hotel on a quiet street is a real find, and it keeps getting
better. The Cabo Inn is a rare combination of low rates, extra-friendly man-
agement, and great, funky style — not to mention extra clean — but you’re
about a mile to the nearest public beach. Rooms are basic and very small —
this inn was a bordello in a prior life. All rooms have recently upgraded fur-
nishings and new air-conditioning (2005) and those on the lower level also
have a minifridge. Muted desert colors add a spark of personality, and rooms
come with either two twin beds or one queen bed. The rooms surround a
courtyard where you can enjoy satellite TV, a barbecue grill, and free coffee.
The third floor has a rooftop terrace with palapa (thatched roof) and a small
swimming pool. Also on this floor is Juan’s Love Palace, also known as the
honeymoon suite. It’s a colorful, palapa-topped, open-air room with hang-
ing tapetes (woven palm mats) for additional privacy. The hotel is just 
2 blocks from downtown and the marina. A lively restaurant next door can
deliver pitchers of margaritas and dinner to your room.

Casa del Mar Golf Resort & Spa
$$$$$
Corridor
A little-known treasure, this intimate resort is one of the best values along
the Corridor, and it’s one of my top recommendations for honeymooners.
The hacienda-style building offers guests luxury accommodations com-
plemented by an on-site spa. Located within the Cabo Real development,
it’s conveniently located by the 18-hole championship Cabo Real, a Robert
Trent Jones, Jr., golf course. Gentle waterfalls lead to the adults-only pool
area with hot tub, and a flowered path takes you farther along to the wide,
sandy stretch of beach with a clear surf break. The Casa del Mar even has
a “quiet area” on the lawn for those looking for a siesta. Guest rooms have
a clean, bright feel to them with white marble floors, light wicker furnish-
ings, separate sitting areas, and large hot tubs, plus separate showers on
the raised bathroom level. Balconies have oversized chairs and ocean
views beyond the pool. It’s a romantic hotel known for its welcoming, per-
sonalized service. In addition to golf, four lighted AstroTurf tennis courts,
one paddle tennis court, the full-service Avanti Spa, and a small but well-
equipped workout room round out the offerings.

Casa Natalia
$$$$$
San José
This property may be Mexico’s most exquisite boutique hotel, a former
residence transformed into a beautiful combination of palms, waterfalls,
and flowers that mirrors the beauty of the land. The inn itself is a com-
pletely renovated historic home, which now combines modern architec-
ture with traditional Mexican touches. Each of the rooms has a name that
reflects the décor such as Conchas (seashells), Azul (blue), or Talavera
(ceramics); all have sliding glass doors that open onto small private ter-
races with hammocks and chairs, shaded by bougainvillea and bamboo.
The two spa suites each have a private terrace with a hot tub and ham-
mock. Thirty-nine tall California palms surround a small courtyard pool;
the terraces face this view. The inn, however, is several miles from the
nearest public beach, but does offer its guests a daily shuttle to a beach
club along the corridor. In its favor, Casa Natalia offers its guests privacy,
style, and romance, and it welcomes children 13 and older only. One of the
highlights of being here is being so close to the exceptional gourmet
restaurant, Mi Cocina (see Chapter 32). It’s in the heart of the Bulevar
Mijares action, just off of the central plaza.

El Encanto Inn
$$–$$$
San José
Located on a quiet street in the historic downtown district, this charming,
small inn borders a grassy courtyard with a fountain and small pool, offer-
ing a very relaxing alternative to busy beachfront hotels. Rooms are all
attractively — and uniquely — decorated with rustic wood and contem-
porary iron furniture. The nice-sized bathrooms have colorful tile accents.
Rooms have two double beds, and suites have king-size beds and an added
sitting room. A pool area with palapa bar and 14 poolside suites were
recently added. These new suites have minibars and other extras, while
all rooms offer satellite TV. El Encanto’s welcoming owners, Cliff and
Blanca, can also help arrange fishing packages, as well as golf and diving
outings. Blanca is a lifelong resident of San José, so she’s a great resource
for information and dining tips. This inn is best for couples or singles look-
ing for a peaceful place from which to explore historic San José.
Continental breakfast is included with room rates. It’s located between
Obregón and Comonfort, half a block from the church.

Corridor
Although this luxury resort along Cabo’s over-the-top Corridor sits on a bluff
overlooking two small, rocky coves, the absence of a real beach doesn’t
seem to matter much to its guests — the hotel more than makes up for it
in terms of pampering services and stylish details. Created by the famed
Auberge Resorts group, this hotel’s architecture is dramatic, elegant, and
comfortable. The casitas and villas are spread across 6.8 hectares 
(17 acres), designed to resemble a Mexican village, and are connected to
the resort facilities by stone footpaths. The top-floor suites have hand-
made palapa ceilings and a private outdoor whirlpool spa. All rooms are
exceptionally spacious, with woven wicker and tropical wood furnishings,
original art, rugs and fabrics in muted colors with jeweled-tone color
accents, and Frette linens gracing the extra-comfortable feather beds.
Terraces are large, extending the living area to the outdoors, and all have
hammocks and views of the Sea of Cortez. In-room amenities include fully
stocked honor bars; plush bathrobes; high-speed Internet access; and
entertainment centers with plasma televisions, stereos, and DVDs. The
oversize bathrooms have a separate tub and shower with dual shower-
heads. You can also enjoy an acclaimed oceanfront restaurant, fitness
center, full-service spa, gourmet market, infinity swimming pool, and the
private beach.

San José
Removed from even the slow pace of San José, this older yet impeccably
clean and friendly courtyard hotel is ideal for fishermen and those looking
for something removed from a traditional hotel vacation. It’s the only hotel
on San José’s only beach that’s safe for swimming. Steps from the water
and the lineup of fishing pangas (small boats), the two stories of sunlit
rooms frame a patio with a pool just large enough to allow you to swim

Las Ventanas al Paraíso
$$$$$
Corridor
Mexico’s most renowned luxury hotel, Las Ventanas consistently offers
luxury accommodations and attention to detail. The architecture, with
adobe structures and rough-hewn wood accents, provides a soothing com-
plement to the desert landscape. The only burst of color comes from the
dazzling ventanas (windows) of pebbled rainbow glass — handmade by
regional artisans — that reflect the changing positions of the sun. Richly
furnished, Mediterranean-style rooms are large (starting at 93 sq. m/1,000
sq. ft.) and appointed with every conceivable amenity, from wood-burn-
ing fireplaces to computerized telescopes for stargazing or whale-watch-
ing from your room. Fresh flowers and glasses of tequila welcome each
guest, and room standards include satellite TVs with VCRs and DVD play-
ers, stereos with CD players, and dual-line phones. Larger suites offer pam-
pering extras such as rooftop terraces, sunken hot tubs on a private patio,
or personal pools. Note that Las Ventanas is also booking the surrounding
Las Ventanas condominiums as part of its room inventory, so be certain to
verify where you’ll be placed, if this is not your preference. Although spa-
cious and boasting a full kitchen, the condominiums lack the views of the
resort rooms and suites. The Spa is among the best in Mexico — particu-
larly notable is its Sea and Stars nighttime massage for two, a relaxing aro-
matherapy massage with two therapists that takes place on the rooftop
terrace of your private suite. With a staff that outnumbers guests by four
to one, this is the place for travelers who want (and can afford) to be seri-
ously spoiled. The oceanview gourmet restaurant has an impressive wine
cellar and an adjoining terrace bar with live classical music. A seaside
casual-dining grill and a fresh-juice bar are also on the property. Guests
enjoy access to the adjoining championship Cabo Real golf course. And Las
Ventanas has its own sportfishing boats and luxury yachts for charter.

Los Milagros

Cabo San Lucas
The elegant, white, two-level buildings that contain the 11 suites and
rooms of Los Milagros (The Miracles) border either a grassy garden area
or small pool. All rooms are different, but they’re all decorated with con-
temporary iron beds with straw headboards, buff-colored tile floors, and
artistic details — but no TVs. Some units have kitchenettes, and the
master suite has a sunken tub. E-mail, fax, and telephone services are avail-
able only through the office, and morning coffee service takes place on the
patio. In the evenings, candles light the garden, and classical music plays.
Request a room in one of the back buildings because conversational noise
is less intrusive. Los Milagros is located just 11⁄2 blocks from the Giggling
Marlin and Cabo Wabo nightclubs and a couple of miles from Cabo’s main
public beach.

location on Medano Beach is central to any other action you may want to
seek out, but you’ll find plenty right here. Rooms are awash in blues and
white, with a sleek, contemporary décor. All suites have ocean views and
private terraces looking across to the famed El Arco. Master suites have a
separate living room area. Guests gather by the beachfront pool where the
Nikki Beach trademark oversized day beds perfectly accommodate this
lounge atmosphere. There are also VIP tepees, and the live DJ music keeps
the party here going day and night. In addition to Nikki Beach, several
dining options are at the hotel, including a Saturday night Mexican Fiesta.

One&Only Palmilla

One of the most comfortably luxurious hotels in Mexico, the One&Only
Palmilla is the grande dame of Los Cabos resorts, and its last renovation
made it among the most spectacular resort hotels anywhere. Perched on
a cliff top above the sea (with beach access), the resort is a series of white
buildings with red-tile roofs, towering palms, and flowering bougainvillea.
The feeling here remains one of classic resort-style comfort, but the new
sophisticated details bring it up-to-date with the most modern of resorts.
The décor features muted desert colors and luxury fabrics, with special

extras such as flat-screen TVs, DVD/CD players, and Bose surround-sound
systems. Bathrooms feature inlaid stone rain-showers and sculpted tubs.
Ample, private balconies or terraces have extra-comfortable, overstuffed
chairs, and each room also has a separate sitting area. Guests receive
twice-daily maid service, a personal butler, and an aromatherapy menu —
to ensure you leave completely relaxed or rejuvenated. Their signature
restaurant — simply named C — is under the direction of the renowned
Chicago Chef Charlie Trotter, and offers 24-hour in-room dining. A second,
more casual dining choice is the palapa-topped Agua restaurant, with so-
called Mexiterranean cuisine. The Palmilla has become renowned as a
location for destination weddings and anniversary celebrations with a
renewal of vows; ceremonies take place in its small, signature chapel that
graces a sloped hillside. Across the highway, the resort’s own champi-
onship golf course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, is available for guests, and
the Palmilla also has two lighted tennis courts, a 186-sq.-m (2,000-sq.-ft.)
state-of-the-art fitness center, and a yoga garden. Also among the new addi-
tions is an exceptional spa, with 13 private treatment villas for one or two
people.

Solmar Suites

Cabo San Lucas
Set against sandstone cliffs at the very tip of the Baja Peninsula, the Solmar
is beloved by travelers seeking seclusion, comfort, and easy access to
Cabo’s diversions. The beach here is spectacular, though not for swim-
ming. Suites are located in two-story, white-stucco buildings along the edge
of the broad beachfront and have either a king bed or two double beds,
satellite TVs, separate seating areas, and private balconies or patios on
the sand. Guests gather by the pool and on the beach at sunset and all day
long during the winter whale migration. With one of the best sportfishing
fleets in Los Cabos, including the deluxe Solmar V that is used for long-
range diving, fishing, and whale-watching expeditions, the Solmar is espe-
cially popular with fishing enthusiasts. Every Saturday, Solmar hosts a
popular Mexican fiesta; advance reservations are necessary almost year-
round. A small timeshare complex adjoins the Solmar; some units are avail-
able for nightly stays. Rates include the hotel’s mandatory 10 percent
service charge.

Mexican setting. Set just behind (and adjacent to) the Tropicana Bar and
Grill (see review in Chapter 32), it frames a plant-filled courtyard with a
graceful arcade bordering the rooms and inviting swimming pool. Each
nicely furnished, medium-size room in the L-shaped building (which has
both a two- and three-story wing) comes with tile floors, two double beds,
a window looking out on the courtyard, a brightly tiled bathroom with
shower, and a coffee pot. Each morning, the staff sets out freshly brewed
coffee, delicious sweet rolls, and fresh fruit for hotel guests. You can order
room service until 11 p.m. from the Tropicana Bar and Grill (owned by the
hotel). The inn is a block south of the town square, and about 2.5km 
(11⁄2 miles) from the nearest beach.

pink walls rise against a landscape of sandstone, cacti, and palms with

rooms. Electric carts carry guests and their luggage through the vast prop-
erty. The rooms are gorgeous and feature air-conditioning and ceiling fans,
private balconies, satellite TVs, and walk-in showers separate from the
bathtubs. This property is probably the best choice among my selections
for families vacationing along the Corridor because of the wealth of activ-
ities available for children (plus babysitting). With six restaurants and two
bars, you may never need to leave the resort. For golfers, both the Palmilla
and Cabo Real golf courses are nearby, and the Westin also has two tennis
courts, seven pools, two children’s pools, a beach club, and complete fit-
ness center with spa and massage services.

Chapter 31
Settling into Los Cabos
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect when you arrive
 Getting the lowdown on the layout
 Discovering helpful information and resources
E
ven though Los Cabos may feel like an extension of Southern
California in spirit, it’s still a foreign country, so a few things are
important to know and keep in mind. Still, if you’re a first-time traveler
to Mexico, you’ll immediately feel comfortable — English appears to be
more accepted than Spanish in terms of languages, and U.S. dollars are
the widely accepted currency.
In this chapter, I take you from the plane, through the airport and to
your hotel, helping you quickly get your bearings in this easy-to-navigate
area. I continue with tips on everything from where to find Internet
access to how to save a buck or two on transportation.
Arriving in Los Cabos by Air
Los Cabos International Airport is small and easy to navigate. It’s
located closest to San José del Cabo. From this town, continue down a
long, well-paved stretch of highway known as the Corridor until you
reach the proverbial “end of the line” — Cabo San Lucas and its rowdy
charms. From the very beginning of your Cabo experience, everything
should be smooth sailing — you can find both immigration and Customs
to be brief, generally easy procedures.
Navigating passport control and Customs
When you arrive, you walk right from your plane straight into the immi-
gration clearance area. Here, an officer asks you to show your passport
(or other proof of citizenship) and your completed tourist card, the FMT
(see Chapter 9 for all the FMT details).

Your FMT is an important document, so take good care of it. You’re 
supposed to keep the FMT with you at all times because you may be
required to show it if you run into any sort of trouble. You also need to
turn it back in upon departure, or you may be unable to leave without
replacing it.
Next up is the baggage claim area. Here, porters stand by to help with
your bags, and they’re well worth the price of the tip — about a dollar 
a bag. After you collect your luggage, you pass through another check-
point. Something that looks like a traffic light awaits you here. You press
a button, and if the light turns green, you’re free to go. If it turns red, you
need to open each of your bags for a quick search. It’s Mexico’s random
search procedure for Customs. If you have an unusually large bag, or an
excessive amount of luggage, you may be searched regardless of the 
traffic-light outcome.
Inside the baggage claim are the rental-car booths, geared for people
who haven’t reserved a car in advance. If you do have a reservation,
agents can advise you where to go to pick up your car. After you’re out-
side the baggage claim area and past the timeshare booths, you find an
area with more rental-car information as well as taxi info and other
transportation options. If you’re part of a package tour that includes
ground transportation to your hotel, this is where you look for your rep-
resentative — generally carrying a sign with your name or the name of
your tour company on it.
After you collect your bags, you may notice a corral-like area that you
pass through, decorated with stunning photos of Los Cabos, and popu-
lated by lots of people waving you over. You may think this is a perfect
place for tourism information, what with such exceptionally friendly
locals; but you’d be wrong. These are timeshare salespeople — hot to
offer you a deal on a rental car, transportation to your hotel, or some
other ploy in exchange for a generally aggressive sales pitch. Trust me —
settle into the area first and then decide if a timeshare presentation is
something you want to include in your vacation agenda.
Getting to your hotel
The one airport that serves both Cabos and the connecting Corridor is
12km (71⁄2 miles) northwest of San José del Cabo and 35km (22 miles)
northeast of Cabo San Lucas. Public transportation here is minimal —
but improving — and taxis are expensive. This is one Mexican beach
resort where I find having a rental car for even part of your stay is not
only practical but also economical if you plan on exploring the area even
a little bit. The main road connecting the two Cabos is a modern, well-
paved stretch of road, and driving here is easy — getting lost is hard,
and parking, though a challenge in the heart of the two towns, isn’t
impossible.
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
414

Renting a car
Advance reservations aren’t always necessary, and don’t be afraid of
requesting a better price than the first one a representative quotes —
bargaining sometimes works. You can, however, generally get a much
better rate by booking your car in advance through a company’s U.S.
toll-free number or Web site. Before signing your name, be sure you
understand the total price after insurance and taxes are added. Rates
can run between $40 and $75 per day with insurance costing an extra
$15 per day.
National Car Rental is my favorite here; its “all inclusive” rate includes
the insurance and taxes. I find this to be much clearer and preferable to
trying to figure out the various options that other companies offer —
that is, you don’t have any surprises. The major car-rental agencies all
have counters open at the airport during hours of flight arrivals. Major
car-rental services include:
 Avis (% 800-331-1212 in the U.S., or 624-146-0201; www.avis.com;
Open: 7 a.m.–9 p.m.)
 Budget (% 800-527-0700 in the U.S., or 624-143-4190; www.budget.

 National (% 800-328-4567 in the U.S., or 624-142-2424; www.

Of the local car-rental agencies, I find the most economical to be

up the car downtown, you can return it to the airport at no extra charge.
If you decide to rent a car, picking it up at the airport may be a good idea
because doing so saves you the airport-to-hotel transportation expense.
You don’t have to drive to the airport to return it either — most of the
car companies have pick-up service at your hotel or local offices within
both towns. On the other hand, if you prefer to settle in first, plan your
car rental for the last part of your vacation. The agency can deliver the
car to your hotel, and then you can return it to the airport prior to
departing (but allow as much as an extra 30 min. for checking it in).
Hiring transportation
If you do opt to let someone else do the driving, buy a ticket inside the
airport for a colectivo (shared minivan) or a taxi. Colectivo fares run
about $12 to San José, about $15 to hotels along the Corridor, and $20 
Chapter 31: Settling into Los Cabos 415

to Cabo for up to eight passengers, and they’re only available from the
airport. A private taxi can be shared by up to four people and costs
about $25 to San José and about $85 to Cabo San Lucas.
If you prefer private transportation, but don’t want to pay the high rates
of a taxi, book through Gray Line (% 624-146-9410; Fax: 624-146-9412;
www.graylineloscabos.com), a company offering full tour services in
Los Cabos. Rates from the airport to hotels range from $27 to $35 per
person for shared rides, and include a bilingual driver who meets you
with a sign bearing your name, luggage assistance, and bottled water.
Private transportation ranges from $65 to $116, and includes all the pre-
viously mentioned items, plus extras such as a welcome kit of informa-
tion. You can book in advance and prepay online (Visa and MasterCard
are accepted).
Getting Around Los Cabos
You exit the airport onto Highway 1, also known as Carretera
Transpeninsular. The first main town you come to is San José del Cabo.
The highway continues west to the shore and then curves and heads
south for about the next 32km (20 miles), where you reach Cabo San
Lucas. In the center of Cabo, Highway 1 turns into Lázaro Cárdenas.
If you’re staying in San José del Cabo, turn off Highway 1 on Zaragoza,
the main street leading from the highway into town; Paseo San José runs
parallel to the beach and is the principal boulevard of this hotel zone.
The mile-long boulevard is the main street in San José with restaurants,
shops, banks, and other services. San José has two principal zones:
downtown, where sophisticated inns as well as traditional budget hotels
are located, and the hotel zone along the beach. Note that no local bus
service runs between downtown San José and the beach; a taxi is the
only means of getting between the two places.
The road that connects San José del Cabo to Cabo San Lucas is the cen-
terpiece of resort growth. Known as the Corridor, this stretch of four
well-paved lanes offers cliff-top vistas but still has no nighttime lighting.
You find the area’s most deluxe resorts and renowned golf here, along
with a collection of dramatic beaches and coves.
A toll-road expressway was recently added to bypass the traffic around
San José, connecting the Corridor directly to the airport. The toll is
$2.50 along this stunning — and mostly empty — stretch of road, and
can be a faster way to reach the airport, or get to your destination, if
you’re in a hurry.
The small town of Cabo San Lucas, edged by foothills and desert moun-
tains to the west and south, grew up around the harbor of Cabo San
Lucas Bay and spreads out to the north and west. The main street lead-
ing into town from the airport and San José del Cabo is Lázaro Cárdenas.
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja

American Express
The representative for the area is located 
in San José, at Plaza La Misión, Local 1-b,
Bulevar Mijares/Paseo Finisterra (% 624-
142-1336 or 624-1343).
Area Code
The local telephone prefix is 624. Calls
between Cabo San Lucas, San José del
Cabo, and northern Corridor hotels are toll
calls, so you must use the area code.
Baby Sitters
Most of the larger hotels can easily arrange
for baby sitters, but many sitters speak lim-
ited English. Rates range from $4 to $10 per
hour.
Banks, ATMs, and Currency Exchange
Banks exchange currency during normal
business hours, generally Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Currency-exchange
Chapter 31: Settling into Los Cabos 417
As Cárdenas nears the harbor, Marina Boulevard branches off from it
and becomes the main artery that curves around the waterfront. Lázaro
Cárdenas, the main street into town from Highway 1, splits off to the
right and then loops back around a shady plaza, turning into Marina
Boulevard, which runs along the waterfront. Most of the shops, restau-
rants, and nightlife in Cabo are all located within this loop.
Touring around town
Many of the Corridor hotels offer some sort of shuttle service into the
two towns, usually for a $15 charge, but the hotels have to disguise it as
a “tour” due to the strength of the taxi union.
Taking a taxi
Finding taxis may be easy, but comparing them to the high cost of every-
thing else, they’re expensive within Cabo. Expect to pay about $25 for a
taxi between Cabo and the Corridor hotels, and about $35 if you’re going
all the way to San José.
Whenever you take a taxi, establish the price before setting out, because
different taxis seem to have different charges. Your hotel should have
the rates to various places posted in the lobby, enabling you to easily
find out the average rates to and from different areas.
Considering a car rental
Because more than 32km (20 miles) separate the two Cabos — with
numerous attractions in between — consider renting a car, even if it’s
only for a day. Transportation by taxi is expensive here, and if you’re at
all interested in exploring, a rental car is your most economical option.
Each of the two towns has its own distinctive character and attractions,
so make the most of this two-for-one resort.
See “Renting a car,” earlier in this chapter, for car-rental information.
Fast Facts: Los Cabos

booths, found all along Cabo’s main tourist
areas, aren’t as competitive, but they’re
more convenient. ATMs are widely avail-
able and even more convenient, and they
dispense pesos — and in some cases 
dollars — at bank-exchange rates.
Beach Safety
Before swimming in the open water here,
check whether the conditions are safe.
Undertows and large waves are common.
In Cabo, Playa Medano (close to the marina
and town) is the principal beach that’s safe
for swimming. It has several lively beach-
front restaurant-bars. It’s also easy to find
watersports equipment for rent here. The
Hotel Meliá San Lucas, on Playa Medano,
has a roped-off swimming area to protect
swimmers from Jet Skis and boats. Note:
Colored flags signaling the safety of swim-
ming conditions aren’t generally used in
Cabo, and neither are lifeguards.
Business Hours
Most offices maintain traditional Mexican
hours of operation (10 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
4–8 p.m. daily), but shops remain open
throughout the day. Offices tend to be
closed on Saturday and Sunday, but shops
are open on Saturday, at least, and increas-
ingly offer limited hours of operation on
Sunday.
Climate
It’s warm all year; however, evenings and
early mornings in the winter months can
turn quite cool. Summers can be very hot,
but tropical rainstorms may cool the 
afternoons.
Emergencies
You can try 060, but generally, no one
answers. The local city-hall number is 
% 624-142-0361.
Hospitals
In Cabo, Baja Medico (Camino de la Plaza
s/n, on the corner with Pedegral; % 624-
143-0127 or 143-0175) has a 24-hour walk-in
clinic. Most of the larger hotels have a
doctor on-call.
Information
In San José, the city tourist information
office (% 624-142-3310 or 142-0465) is in
the old post-office building on Zaragoza at
Mijares. It offers maps, free local publica-
tions, and other basic information about the
area. It’s open Monday through Friday from
8 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The Secretary of Tourism functions as the
information office in Cabo. It’s on Madero
between Hidalgo and Guerrero (% 624-
146-9628 or 142-0446).
Prior to arrival, contact the Los Cabos
Tourism Board at % 866-567-2226, toll-free
from the U.S.
Note: The many visitor-information booths
along the street are actually timeshare
sales booths, and their staffs aim to pitch 
a visit to their resort in exchange for 
discounted tours, rental cars, or other 
giveaways.
Internet Access
In San José, Trazzo Internet, on the corner
of Zaragoza and Morelos (% 624-142-0303),
1 block from the central plaza, is open
Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and charges
$2.50 for 30 minutes or less for high-speed
access.
Access in Cabo San Lucas is available at
Onda Net Café & Bar (Lázaro Cárdenas 7,
Edificio Posada, across from the Pemex gas
station; % 624-143-5390). Access costs $5
for 15 minutes, $7 for 30 minutes, or $8 for
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja

an hour. It’s open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to
Saturday.
Maps
One of the best around is the free American
Express map, usually found at the tourist
information offices and the hotel concierge
desks.
Newspapers and Magazines
Most hotels and shops distribute the
English-language Los Cabos Guide, Los
Cabos News, Cabo Life, Baja Sun, and the
irreverent and extremely entertaining
Gringo Gazette (www.gringogazette.
com). These publications have up-to-date
information on new restaurants and clubs.
Books, Books, in Cabo San Lucas (% 624-
143-3172 or -3173), sells a good selection of
English- and Spanish-language reading
material, with a specialty of regional guides
and publications. It’s located on Bulevar
Marina, Plaza de la Danza, Local 7, next to
Tanga Tanga, and is open daily from 9 a.m.
to 10 p.m. A second location is in San José
at Bulevar Mijares 41 near the Tropicana Inn
(% 624-142-4433), open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
English-language books and magazines are
also generally available for sale in hotel gift
shops.
Pharmacy
In San José, Farmacia ISSTE (Carretera
Transpeninsular Km 34, Plaza California; 
% 624-142-2645) is the major pharmacy in
the area. It’s open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
A long-standing drugstore in Cabo San
Lucas, with a wide selection of toiletries as
well as medicines, is Farmacia Aramburo
(Lázaro Cárdenas at Zaragoza, Plaza
Aramburo; % 624-143-1489). It’s open daily
from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Police
In San José, call % 624-142-0361; in Cabo
San Lucas, the number is % 624-143-3977.
Post Office (Correo)
In San José, the correo on Bulevar Mijares
1924 at Valerio González (% 624-142-0911)
is open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m. and Saturday 9 a.m. to noon.
The correo (% 624-143-0048) in Cabo San
Lucas is at Lázaro Cárdenas and Francisco
Villa on the highway to San José del Cabo,
east of the El Squid Roe bar. It’s open
Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.
Special Events
The feast of the patron saint of San José
del Cabo is celebrated on March 19 with a
fair, music, dancing, feasts, horse races,
and cockfights. October 12 is the festival of
the patron saint of Todos Santos, a town
about 105km (65 miles) north. October 18 is
the feast of the patron saint of Cabo San
Lucas, celebrated with a fair, feasts, music,
dancing, and other special events.
Taxes
There’s a 15 percent value-added tax (IVA)
on goods and services, and it’s generally
included in the posted price.
Taxis
Taxis are plentiful but relatively expensive.
Trips between the two towns average 
$35; trips between hotels along the Corridor
average $20. Rides within San José cost
around $5, but rides within Cabo cost
between $8 and $12.
Telephone
Avoid the phone booths that have signs in
English advising you to call home using a
Chapter 31: Settling into Los Cabos 419

special 800 number — these are absolute
rip-offs and can cost as much as $20 per
minute. The least expensive way to call is
by using a Telmex (LADATEL) prepaid phone
card, available at most pharmacies and
mini-supers, using the official Telmex (Lada)
public phones. In Mexico you need to dial
001 prior to a number to reach the United
States, and you need to preface long dis-
tance calls within Mexico by dialing 01.
Time Zone
Los Cabos operates on mountain standard
time, but Mexico’s observance of daylight
saving time varies somewhat from that in
the United States.

Chapter 32
Dining in Los Cabos
by Lynne Bairstow
In This Chapter
 Discovering the best of Los Cabos
 Dining with the locals
P
aying a lot for mediocre food isn’t uncommon in Los Cabos, so try
to get a couple of unbiased recommendations before settling in for
a meal. If people are only drinking and not dining, take that as a clue
because many seemingly popular places are long on party atmosphere
but short on food quality. Prices decrease the farther you walk inland
from the waterfront.
With several exceptional choices and culinary offerings more represen-
tative of Mexico, San José is becoming known as the preferred dining
town. Prices also tend to be more reasonable. If you’re staying along the
Corridor, remember to figure in transportation costs when calculating
the price of your meal — you may just decide to dine at your hotel,
which is likely to have a top-notch chef anyway. Cabo has the most
restaurant offerings, but sad to say, few are truly spectacular.
Cabo is a very casual town, and shorts and jeans are accepted every-
where except the most upscale resort restaurants, but dressier resort
wear is still acceptable, too. Despite the relaxed atmosphere, prices here
are generally higher than you find in comparable restaurants in the
United States or other parts of Mexico. This situation is due to the
necessity of importing many ingredients from the mainland. Cabo has
also imported some customs of “upper” California — it’s becoming more
common to have segregated nonsmoking areas in restaurants here due
to the demand by visitors.
Besides the restaurants mentioned in this chapter, dozens of good, clean
taco stands and taco restaurants dot the downtown area. To find addi-
tional good restaurants, explore Hidalgo and Cárdenas and the Marina 
at the Plaza Bonita. North-of-the-border tastes have heavily influenced
Cabo’s dining scene. The usual suspects (U.S. franchise chains such as
KFC, Subway, Pizza Hut, and a host of others) are everywhere downtown.
Note that many restaurants here automatically add the tip to the bill.

When it comes to welcoming young ones at restaurants, Los Cabos is
more like the United States than Mexico — less than enthusiastic, except
at the more traditional establishments and casual hotel restaurants. If
your children are particular to American tastes, you can go with the
standards such as McDonald’s, Burger King, and Hard Rock Cafe — all
good choices. But you may also want to try the Mexican alternatives of
Carlos O’Brian’s or Squid Roe, which seem to be fun at any age — and if
you dine early, the atmosphere is less raucous.
The Best Restaurants in Los Cabos
I arrange the following restaurants alphabetically, noting their location
and general price category. Remember that tips generally run about 
15 percent, and most wait-staff really depend on these for their income,
so be generous if the service warrants. Please refer to the Introduction
of this book for an explanation of the price categories.
Please see the menu glossary in Appendix C for more information on
Mexican cuisine.
Baan Thai
$$
San José
PAN-ASIAN
Pan-Asian cuisine seems to be in the spotlight worldwide these days, and
Baan Thai does an impressive job of combining Thai flavors with a hint of
those of Mexico in this exceptional restaurant, under the direction of
Chef/owner Carl Marts. Move beyond traditional starters like spring rolls
or satay to one of Baan Thai’s more unique offerings, such as blue crab
stir-fried with chile, garlic, and tomatoes, or mild chilies stuffed with
smoked marlin and served with a soy-ginger dipping sauce. From there,
move on to entrees such as wok tossed Chilean salmon, with chiles and
basil; steamed Baja mussels in a coconut herb broth; or seared steak
tossed with mangoes, green apples, and chiles. An impressive wine list and
full bar service are available to complement your meal. For more than a
decade prior to opening Baan Thai, Chef Marts presided over the kitchen
at the Corridor’s Twin Dolphin resort. Air-conditioned indoor dining, as
well as outdoor dining, in an exotic garden patio, is available.

GOURMET
Under the direction of renowned Chicago chef Charlie Trotter (this is his
first restaurant outside the U.S.), a table for dinner at C is the most coveted
reservation in Cabo. Baja’s influence on Trotter’s culinary innovation is
obvious in the menu selections, which change daily, but emphasize
seafood and indigenous ingredients, although selections of meat and game
are also available. To experience the restaurant’s best, order the signature

degustation menu, offering a variety of small courses, each paired with
individual wine selection. The 110-seat dining room is L.A.-chic and gives
no hint that you’re in Mexico, despite the prevalent water theme and the
series of blue cylindrical aquariums that separate the dining room from
the exhibition kitchen. There are also two glass-enclosed wine rooms in
the main dining area, and the overall atmosphere is bright, if a bit loud. C
also offers a 10-seat Private Dining Room, and an invitation-only Chef’s
Kitchen Table, seating eight. Many consider a meal at C worth the trip to
Cabo. Although the setting is visually stunning and the flavors superb, I
found the service pretentious and the prices excessive — even for Cabo,
which is saying a lot. Formal resort attire is requested, and reservations
are an absolute must during high season.

or on the bustling waterfront terrace. The appealing menu also offers break-
fast egg wraps, salads (for example, curried chicken salad with fresh fruit),

Casa Rafael’s
$$–$$$$
Cabo San Lucas
INTERNATIONAL
Although I consider it overpriced, Casa Rafael’s is regarded as one of the
most romantic places in Cabo. Dine in one of the candlelit rooms or
alcoves (air-conditioned) of this large house, or perhaps outside beside
the small swimming pool. Piano music plays in the background while you
enjoy a leisurely meal; the staff times the courses so that you don’t feel
rushed. To start, try the sublime smoked dorado pâté or perhaps the
hearts of palm with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. House specialties
include the chicken Parmesan Sonia and scampi with pasta. The Black
Angus steaks are imported from the United States; the lamb comes from
New England. The rich desserts may make you wish you’d seen them first
before stuffing yourself on the entrees. Wine and aperitif menus are exten-
sive. To find Casa Rafael’s, follow Hacienda Road toward the ocean; when
you top the hill, look left. Turn left when you see the rosy-pink château
with an arched front and patio with caged birds and a fountain.

SEAFOOD/MEXICAN
For one of the area’s finest Mexican meals, this casually elegant restaurant
in an 18th-century hacienda is a great bet. The 150-year-old colonial home
is decorated in the colors of a Mexican sunset: walls painted a deep
orange, and tables and chairs clad in bright rose, lavender, and orange
cloth. Mariachis play nightly from 8 to 9 p.m. (mid-Dec through Mar) in the
tropical courtyard where candles flicker under the trees and flowering
vines. For an appetizer, try the mushrooms diablo — a moderately zesty
dish of mushrooms with garlic and guajillo chiles. For a main course, the
ranchero shrimp in cactus sauce or grilled lobster tail are flavorful
choices. You can also enjoy brunch almost until the dinner hour. The inte-
rior dining room is nice, but the courtyard is the most romantic dining
spot in San José. It’s located on the east side of the town plaza.

In this rustically casual restaurant, you may feel like you’re dining at 
a friend’s home, as welcoming as chef Armando Montano is. His passion
for Mexican cuisine is evident, as he blends the traditional flavors of this
country — including an array of chiles — into imaginative and heavenly
offerings. Among the most popular dinner options are shrimp in a roasted
garlic and guajillo chile sauce, or the creative grilled tortilla and salmon
Napoleon accompanied by a mango pico de gallo (lime juice with a salty
chile powder). These choices may not be offered when you arrive, how-
ever, as chef Armando is known to frequently change his menu. At night,
candlelight adds a sparkle of romance to the setting. El Chilar also offers
a full bar and an ample selection of wines, with suggestions for pairings
with your meal. Air-conditioned indoor dining is available.

La Dolce
$–$$
Cabo San Lucas
ITALIAN
This Cabo restaurant, with authentic Italian thin-crust, brick-oven pizzas
and other specialties, is the offspring of Puerto Vallarta’s La Dolce Vita.
The food is some of the best in the Baja Peninsula, and the fact that 80 per-
cent of La Dolce’s business is from local customers underscores the point.
It’s known for its reasonable prices and attentive and welcoming service.
The simple menu also features sumptuous pastas and calzones, beef or
fish carpaccio, plus great salads. Due to its popularity, a second location
(% 624-142-6621) has opened in one of San José’s historical buildings,
right on the main Plaza Jardin Mijares. With a true bistro atmosphere, this
La Dolce is open Tuesday through Sunday, from 2 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Corner of M. Hidalgo and Zapata. % 624-143-4122. Reservations not accepted. Main
courses: $8–$19. MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 6 p.m.–midnight. Closed Sept.
Mi Casa

Cabo San Lucas
MEXICAN/NOUVELLE MEXICAN
The building’s vivid, cobalt-blue facade is your first clue that this place
celebrates Mexico; the menu confirms that impression. Mi Casa is one of
Cabo’s most renowned gourmet Mexican restaurants, although it’s equally
noted for its inconsistency. Traditional specialties, such as manchaman-
teles (literally interpreted as “tablecloth stainers,” it’s a stew of meat and
vegetables), cochinita pibil (a local pork dish), and chiles en nogada (chile
peppers stuffed with a mixture of meat, nuts, and fruit) are everyday menu
staples. Fresh fish is prepared with delicious seasonings from recipes
found throughout Mexico. Especially pleasant at night, the restaurant’s
tables, scattered around a large patio, are set with colorful cloths, tradi-
tional pottery, and glassware. It’s across from the main plaza.
Calle Cabo San Lucas at Madero. % 624-143-1933. Reservations recommended.

Mi Cocina

San José
NOUVELLE MEXICAN/EURO CUISINE
Without a doubt, Mi Cocina is currently the best dining choice in the entire
Los Cabos area. From the setting to the service, a dinner here is sure to
be unforgettable. The plant-filled courtyard, with its towering palms, dra-
matic lighting, and art-filled exposed brick walls, accommodates alfresco
dining on several different levels. But it’s not just the romantic setting that
makes this restaurant special — the food is creative and consistently
superb. Notable starters include steamed baby clams topped with a light
creamy cilantro sauce and served with garlic croutons, or a healthy slice
of Camembert cheese, fried and served with homemade toast and grapes.
Among the favorite main courses are the baked baby rack of lamb served
with grilled vegetables, and the Provençal-style shrimp served with risotto,

roasted tomato, basil, and cilantro-fish consommé. Save room for dessert;
choices include the famous chocolate-chocolate cake and a perfect crème
brûlée. The full-service palapa bar offers an excellent selection of wines,
premium tequilas, and single-malt scotches. Be adventurous and try one
of the special martinis, such as the Flor de Mexico, an adaptation of the
Cosmo, using hibiscus flower infusion rather than cranberry juice.

SEAFOOD
The location of this long-standing Cabo favorite isn’t very inspirational —
it’s basically a large cement building — but somebody obviously likes the
food. The place is always packed, generally with local diners tired of high
prices and small portions. Ocean-fresh seafood is the order of the day
here, and the specialty platter can easily satisfy the healthy appetites of
four people. The restaurant is 11⁄2 blocks inland from Lázaro Cárdenas.

JAPANESE/SUSHI
Exceptional Japanese cuisine and sushi are the specialties in this air-con-
ditioned restaurant with a clean, minimalist décor. A rosewood sushi bar
with royal blue-tiled accents invites diners to watch the master sushi chef
at work. An exhibition kitchen behind the sushi chef demonstrates why
this place has been honored with a special award for cleanliness. It’s a per-
sonal favorite of mine — as well as of many local residents.

One of Cabo’s most exclusive patio-dining establishments, Peacocks
emphasizes creatively prepared fresh seafood. Start off with the house
pâté or a salad of feta cheese with cucumber, tomato, and onion. For the
main course, try one of the pastas — linguini with grilled chicken and sun-
dried tomatoes is one of my favorites. Heartier entrees include steaks,
shrimp, and lamb, all prepared several ways.

The Restaurant (Las Ventanas al Paraíso)
$$$–$$$$
Corridor
INTERNATIONAL 
It may just be called “The Restaurant,” but that’s where simplicity ends
and the extraordinary begins. Where Los Cabos is known for its pricey
dining, this is one restaurant that is worth the price. Start off with a cock-
tail before dinner in The Lounge, the casually elegant bar area bordering
Las Ventanas’ stunning pool, lit from above with a constellation of tin stars
illuminated by candles. When you move into the dining area, you get a
sense of the Las Ventanas signature service — such as, if you’re wearing
black, your server gives you a black napkin. As remarkable as the service
is, the dining itself is even better. First courses may include Ensenada
steamed mussels served in coconut milk with a hint of chile arbol and a
dash of tequila, or a stone crab salad with baby watercress, mango, phyllo,
and sweet mustard sauce. The constantly changing menu of main courses
generally includes an ample selection of seafood, including lobster, done
in creative presentations, but the grilled rack of lamb with garlic potatoes
is as good as anywhere. Especially recommendable are the chef’s gourmet
variations on traditional Mexican cuisine — such as the suckling pig enchi-
lada in chile ancho sauce, a grilled New York steak in a tequila-infused red
wine sauce served with spicy cactus paddle (nopal), or the chocolate
tamale with guanábana sorbet, for an intriguing finish. A stellar selection
of premium wines is served, and dress is resort attire. You have your
choice of alfresco dining on the patio, or in indoor, air-conditioned com-
fort. Reserve at least a day prior, because dinner at The Restaurant is quite
popular in Cabo at any time during the year.

MEXICAN/ASIAN
The contemporary Mexican cuisine with a light and flavorful touch is the
star attraction here, although the garden setting, with rustic leather and
twine furniture and lanterns scattered among palms and giant mango trees,
is also lovely. Start with a heavenly version of the traditional chiles en
nogada stuffed with couscous, raisins, and papaya and seasoned with cin-
namon. Grilled tuna with cilantro ginger sauce arrives perfectly seared;
the whole-grain bread is fresh and hot. Seriously consider trying one of
the specialties: shrimp in tequila sauce or the ribs in tamarind sauce.
Attentive service complements the fine meal. An added touch: Cuban
cigars and an excellent selection of tequilas are available, as is an exten-
sive wine list emphasizing California vintages.

The Tropicana remains a popular mainstay, especially for tourists. The
recently remodeled restaurant and bar retains its steady clientele day and
night, as well as its offerings of live music and special sporting events on
satellite TV. The main dining area is in a garden (candlelit in the evening)
with a tiled mural at one end. A new interior area, done in a rustic-chic
décor, adds about 100 new seats to the restaurant. Cafe-style sidewalk
dining is also available. The menu is too extensive to lay claim to any spe-
cialty; it aims to please everyone. All meats and cheeses are imported, and
dinners include thick steaks and shrimp fajitas. Paella is the Sunday spe-
cial. The restaurant is a block south of the Plaza Mijares.

eographically, Baja California is set apart from mainland Mexico,
which greatly contributes to its unique culture and personality, as
well as to its many attractions and diversions. Volcanic activity created
the craggy desertscape populated mainly by forests of cardón cactus,
spiky Joshua trees, and spindly ocotillo bushes that you see today. Hard
to believe such a formidable landscape could become home to a vaca-
tion haven, but it has. Today, Los Cabos offers visitors a bevy of options
for fun in the sun — ecotours, golfing, sportfishing, diving, and whale-
watching, to name a few — amidst beautiful settings and posh resorts.
In this chapter, I give you an overview of the best beaches tucked into the
miles of coastline between the two Cabos (and in the neighboring areas).
I point out the most interesting sights in these twin towns, and I also offer
a rundown of the best ways to spend an active day — or night — here.
Hitting the Beaches
The beaches of Los Cabos are stunning — cobalt-blue waters set against
a backdrop of rugged desert terrain. The countless inlets and small
coves in the Sea of Cortez have made Los Cabos a popular destination
for ocean kayaking, and the abundant sea life attracts both divers and
sport fishermen. And as for the beaches here (see the “Los Cabos” map,
in this section), you can choose from dozens of tranquil coves or opt to

take on the long stretches of challenging surf breaks. One after another,
these beautiful patches of sand hug the shoreline between the two
Cabos (San José del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas).
If you’re a beach aficionado who wants to explore the beautiful coves
and beaches along the 35km (22-mile) coast between the two Cabos,
consider renting a car for a day or so. Rental cars cost $40 to $75 per
day and up. (Check out Chapter 31 for all the details on renting a car in
Cabo.) Frequent bus service between San José del Cabo and Cabo San
Lucas also makes it possible to take in the pleasures of both towns.

Cabo’s northern beaches
The relaxed pace of San José del Cabo makes it an ideal place to unwind
and absorb authentic Mexican flavor while enjoying a stretch of sand.
The nearest beach to San José that’s safe for swimming is Pueblo la
Playa (also called La Playita), located about 3km (2 miles) east of town.
From Bulevar Mijares, turn east at the small “Pueblo la Playa” sign and
follow the dusty, dirt road through cane fields and palms to a small vil-
lage and beautiful beach where local fishermen pull their pangas (skiffs)
ashore. This whole area is likely to be significantly changed by press
time, as the new Puerto Los Cabos marina and resort is rapidly develop-
ing just to the north. It will include, in addition to the marina, a golf
course, hotels, and real estate, so certainly, additional options will be
popping up. But for now, enjoy the La Playita Resort and its adjacent
restaurant (% 624-142-4166), which currently offer the only formal sus-
tenance on the beach. Also note that the beach has no shade palapas
(thatched roofs).
The beach that forms the southern border of San José is a broad stretch
of sand, but because hotels front most of it, hotel guests are the primary
beachgoers here — it can be a hassle for non-guests to access the beach.
Corridor beaches
Traveling from San José to Cabo San Lucas along Highway 1, the first
beach along the Corridor is Playa Costa Azul (Km 29) where Zipper’s
restaurant is located (see Chapter 32). It’s a long stretch of sand next to
the Mykonos and La Jolla condo developments. Most of the year, Costa
Azul has a gentle, but regular, surf break; however, from late summer to
early fall, a southwest swell brings consistent wave action with some
truly exceptional surf conditions.
Playa Palmilla (Km 27.5), with its beautiful rock formations, is the near-
est swimming beach after you’ve set off down the Corridor. It’s located
just west of Playa Costa Azul near the One&Only Palmilla — an elegant
place to stay or dine. To reach Playa Palmilla, take a taxi to the road that
leads to the One&Only Palmilla grounds. Then take the left fork in the
road (without entering the hotel grounds) and follow the road to the
beach.
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
434
Watching your feathered friends
Between Pueblo la Playa and San José’s Presidente InterContinental Hotel lies the
Estero San José, an estuary and protected ecological reserve with at least 270 species
of birds. Across from the entrance to the InterContinental, a footpath leads you into the
estuary for one heck of a bird-watching experience.

Playa Chileno (Km 14) is the largest and most popular of the public
beaches along the corridor, and it has both public restrooms and 
showers — a rarity in Mexico. A watersports-equipment rental facility
located at the southern end of the beach can come in handy — the rocky
headlands at both ends of this small bay offer some good snorkeling.
Nearby Playa Santa María (Km 12) has less in the way of facilities and
shade, but it’s better for snorkeling and diving. Both of these beaches
are noted for their abundance of marine life.
The remains of the Japanese tuna boat Inari Maru make Playa Barco
Varado (Km 9–10) noteworthy and provide the beach with its name —
Shipwreck Beach. The boat became stranded on the rocky shoals in
1966. It’s now one of the main dive sites in the area. The hull and other
wreckage lie 2 to 26m (61⁄2–85 ft.) underwater.
Although a few travel agencies run snorkeling tours to some of these
beaches, no public transportation is available. If you want to explore
these beaches on your own, your only option is to rent a car. To find
these beaches, follow the blue-and-white signs along Highway 1. The
signs are sometimes labeled ACCESO A PLAYA, but more often, they simply
bear the international symbol for a swimmer or a snorkeler.
In addition to Playa Palmilla, the beaches of Chileno and Santa María are
generally safe for swimming — but always be careful. The other beaches
along the Corridor aren’t safe. Experienced snorkelers may want to check
them out, but other visitors should go for the view only. Always check at
a hotel or travel agency for directions and swimming conditions.
Cabo’s southern beaches
The main beach in Cabo San Lucas is a curving sweep of sand known as
Playa El Medano, located on the east side of the bay. The swimming
conditions here are generally safe. You can also rent snorkeling gear,
boats, WaveRunners, kayaks, pedal boats, and windsurf boards and
score some windsurfing lessons. The people-watching at El Medano is as
hot as the action — take your pick from the many outdoor restaurants
along the shore and settle in for a cold one.
Finding Water Fun for Everyone
It began with John Steinbeck’s stories and continued with the tall tales of
the early sport fishermen who came here in the 1940s and 1950s. With
more than 3,000 estimated species of fish in the waters offshore Baja
California and the title of undisputed bill-fishing capital of the world, Los
Cabos enjoyed early fame among visitors who wanted to tackle these
larger species, such as tuna, marlin, and swordfish (see “Reeling in the
big one,” later in this chapter). In the years that followed, travelers to
Los Cabos have discovered an even greater number of ways to revel in
the treasures of this deep, blue sea.
Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 435

Cruising Los Cabos
Whether by day or in the fading light of the sunset, numerous cruises
are available to take you around Land’s End — the famed tip of Baja
California — to enjoy this truly stunning sight. Boats depart from Cabo
San Lucas. The cruise prices and offerings vary but usually include
music, an open bar, and snacks for between $30 and $45 per person.
Variables include the type of boat, duration of the cruise, and amenities.
The sunset cruise on the 13m (42-ft.) catamaran Pez Gato (% 624-143-
3797 or 143-5297; www.pezgatocabo) is always a favorite. The excursion
departs from the Muelle Principal dock at 5 p.m. This two-hour cruise
costs $35 and includes margaritas, beer, and sodas. Similar boats also
leave from the Plaza las Glorias Hotel dock and from the marina. Almost
any travel agency or hotel tour desk can make the arrangements for you,
or you can call Gray Line Los Cabos (% 624-146-9410; www.grayline
loscabos.com). Gray Line works with all the tour providers in the area
and can give you the unbiased lowdown on which one will meet your
individual needs.
Another great way to see the aquatic sights is aboard a glass-bottom
boat. These boats leave from the Cabo San Lucas marina every 45 min-
utes between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. daily. The cost is about $10 for an hour-
long tour past sea lions and pelicans to the famous El Arco (Rock Arch,
or simply “The Arch”) at Land’s End where the Pacific Ocean and the Sea
of Cortez meet. Most boats make a brief stop at Playa del Amor or drop
you off if you ask; you can use your ticket to catch a later boat back. (Be
sure to find out what time the last boat departs.)
You don’t want to miss the whale-watching cruises when the gray
whales migrate to the Los Cabos area between January and March. In
San José, fishermen at Pueblo la Playa take small groups out to see the
whales; a four-hour trip runs about $45 per person. 
Sportfishing boats, glass-bottom boats, and cruise catamarans also offer
whale-watching trips at prices ranging from $35 to $60 for a half-day trip.
You can also spot the whales from shore; good whale-watching spots
include the beach by the Solmar Suites hotel on the Pacific (see review
in Chapter 30) and the beaches and cliffs along the Corridor.
The ultimate whale excursion is an all-day trip to Magdalena Bay, a one-
hour plane ride away. In a small skiff, you get close enough to touch the
whales. The cost for the trip, including air transportation, is $380, avail-
able through most local travel agents. If you want to spend more time
with the whales, Sea Kayak Adventures (% 800-616-1942; www.sea
kayakadventures.com) offers an eight-day trip to Magdalena Bay, with
kayaking among whales for four to five hours per day, hiking, and camp-
ing in remote coves. Prices start at $1,280 per person.
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
436

Preferring a paddleboat
Fully guided, ecologically oriented sea-kayaking tours are available
through Baja’s Moto Rent (% 624-143-2050), Cabo Expeditions (% 624-
143-2700), and Aqua Deportes (% 624-143-0117). Most ocean kayaking
tours depart from Cabo San Lucas.
The tours generally run from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. and include breakfast 
and beverages for a price of about $70. No previous experience is 
necessary — guides provide complete instructions at the start of the
tour. Kayaks are the most popular and practical way to explore the pris-
tine coves that dot this shoreline.
Another excellent source for kayak tours is BajaWild Expeditions 
(% 624-142-5300; www.bajawild.com), specialists in adventure tours in
the Cabos area. They offer a variety of kayaking and snorkeling tours to
venues that include Cabo Pulmo, the Arch and Lover’s Rock, and excur-
sions within the estuary. Prices range from $50 to $95.
Catching a wave
When summer hurricanes spin off the southern end of the peninsula,
they send huge surf northward to beaches such as Zippers, Punta
Gorda, and Old Man’s. People have compared Zippers (near the Brisa
del Mar Trailer Park and the Costa Azul surf shop outside San José del
Cabo) with places such as Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu. That
may be a bit of an exaggeration, but this area does feature great waves
nonetheless.
Playa Costa Azul (Hwy. 1 Km 29, just south of San José) is the most pop-
ular surfing beach in the area. A few bungalows are available for rent
here, and surfers can camp on the beach. You can rent surfboards and
surf racks for your rental car by the day here. Spectators can watch the
action from the highway lookout point at the top of the hill south of
Costa Azul.
You can find good surfing from March through November all along the
beaches west of Cabo, and Playa Chileno, near the Cabo San Lucas
Hotel east of town, has a famous right break. Other good surfing beaches
along the corridor are Acapulquito, El Tule, and La Bocana.
The Pacific coast has yet to face the onslaught of development that 
has rapidly changed the landscape to the east. An hour-long drive up 
the coast to the little towns of Pescadero and Todos Santos can be a
great surf journey, with a couple of good point breaks near here. You 
can reach Playa San Pedrito via the dirt road that begins about 7km 
(41⁄2 miles) south of the Todos Santos town limits. Follow the “San
Pedrito Campground” signs. The point is very rocky and sharp, but it’s 
a wonderful wave at the right swell direction and tide (north-west 
swell, rising tide). Farther down the road is Playa los Cerritos, located
13km (8 miles) south of Todos Santos. Cerritos is a lovely beach with a
surfable point break off a big headland.
Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 437

New to surfing? Baja Wild (% 624-142-5300; www.bajawild.com) offers
surf lessons as well as surf tours, so you can get right to the best waves
in the briefest amount of time. Trips take you to any of 15 breaks within
the Sea of Cortez or to the big breaks on the Pacific Ocean. You can even
combine surfing and kayaking.
Exploring the deep blue
Diving in Los Cabos is so special because of the abundance of marine
life, which includes giant mantas, sea turtles, dolphins, and tropical 
fish. You can choose between diving the coral reefs at the southern tip
of the cape region or one of the shipwrecks in the area. April through
November is the best time to dive, but diving is most crowded from
October to mid-January. Making reservations in advance is important 
if you’re planning to dive then. During the winter months, you’re also
likely to hear the moving, tonal songs of the humpback whales as you
dive. Note that during the winter months, the water here can be quite
cold, so a wet suit is necessary — even for most snorkelers.
Several companies offer snorkeling; a two-hour cruise to sites around 
El Arco costs $30, and a four-hour trip to Santa María costs $55. Both
prices include gear rental. Certain beaches, such as Playa del Amor,
Santa María, Chileno, and Barco Varado, have snorkeling gear for rent 
at the beach; it’s generally priced between $10 and $15.
For scuba diving, contact Amigos del Mar (% 800-344-3349 in the 
U.S., or 624-143-0505; Fax: 310-454-1686 in the U.S., or 624-143-0887; www.
amigosdelmar.com), located at the marina in Cabo San Lucas. Diving
specialist Ricardo Sevilla has all the answers to your Cabo diving ques-
tions. Dives are made along the wall of a canyon in San Lucas Bay where
you can see the “sandfalls” that even Jacques Cousteau couldn’t figure
out — no one knows their source or cause. Amigos del Mar also has
scuba trips to Playa Santa María and places farther away including the
Gordo Banks and Cabo Pulmo. Dive prices start at $40 for a one-tank
dive and $70 for two tanks. Trips to the coral outcropping at Cabo Pulmo
start at $130. Located two hours from Cabo San Lucas, Cabo Pulmo is
rated for beginners and up. Gordo Banks, for advanced divers, is an
underwater mountain about 5 miles offshore with a black-coral bottom
and schools of game fish and manta rays at a rate of $125 for a two-tank
dive. Resort courses cost $100 per person and open-water certification
costs around $450.
In addition to Amigos del Mar in Cabo San Lucas, snorkeling and scuba
trips can also be arranged through Gray Line (% 624-146-9410; www.
graylineloscabos.com), in San José.
Reeling in the big one
Superb sportfishing put Cabo San Lucas on the map, and many travelers
still come here with the dream of dropping a line and waiting for the big

one. The fishing really lives up to its reputation — bringing in a 100-
pound marlin is considered routine. Angling is good all year, though the
catch varies with the season. Here’s the fishing lineup by time of year
and the most prevalent fish:
January to April: Yellowtail
May to December: Yellowfin tuna
June to November: Sailfish and wahoo
July to December: Black and blue marlin
All year: Striped marlin
For most cruises and excursions, try to make fishing reservations at
least a day in advance, keeping in mind that some trips require a mini-
mum number of people. You can arrange your fishing trip through a
travel agency or directly at one of the fishing-fleet offices at the marina’s
far south end in Cabo San Lucas.
The marina is located on the south side of the harbor. You can easily
find fleet operators with offices near the docks. To choose a boat, take a
stroll around the marina and talk with the captains — you may arrive at
an economical deal. Try ABY Charters (% 624-144-4203; Fax: 624-143-
0874; www.abycharters.com) or Picante/Bluewater Sportfishing 
(% 624-143-2474; Fax: 624-143-5969; www.picantesportfishing.com).
Both companies have booths located at the sportfishing dock at the
marina’s far south end.
The going rate for a day on a fully equipped cruiser with captain and
guide (many of the larger hotels, such as the Solmar, have their own
fleets) starts at around $700 for up to four people. For deluxe trips 
with everything included aboard a 12m (40-ft.) boat, budget $1,300.
The panga fleets offer the best deals. Pair up with another angler and
charter a panga, a 6.6m (22-ft.) skiff used by local fishermen, at Playa la
Puebla near San José. Several panga fleets offer up to six-hour sportfish-
ing trips, usually from 6 a.m. to noon, for $25 per hour (with a three-hour
minimum). You can split the cost with one or two other people. For
information, contact the fisherman’s cooperative in Pueblo la Playa, or
you can call Palmilla Bay Sportfishing (% 624-146-9681; Fax: 624-130-
7786) at the Hotel Posada Real. Palmilla Bay’s also has its own fishing
fleet with both pangas ($190 for six hours) and cruisers ($380–$495).
Outfitters supply the boat and tackle, and the client buys the bait,
drinks, and snacks.
You need daily fishing permits in Cabos, but your captain can take care
of the details. Daily permits range from $4 to $10, and annual permits are
also available. Check with your outfitter when you make your reserva-
tion to determine how he handles permits.
Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 439

Catch and release is strongly encouraged in Los Cabos. Anglers reel in
their fish, which are tagged and released unharmed into the sea. Anglers
get a certificate that documents the catch, and they leave Los Cabos
with the knowledge that plenty of billfish will still be in the sea when
they return.
Enjoying Land Sports
The rugged terrain of Baja and the cape region once kept people out of
the area. Now it seems to be a main lure, attracting travelers in search 
of an active vacation and true interaction with nature. If you prefer your
nature somewhat on the tame side, you may find your game on one of
Cabo’s many famed golf courses. In fact, golf has overtaken sportfishing
in popularity in Cabo.
Teeing off
Los Cabos has become Mexico’s golf mecca. The master plan for golf in
Los Cabos calls for 207 total holes in the future. The fees I list in this sec-
tion are for 18 holes of play during high season, including golf cart, water,
club service, and tax. Summer rates are about 25 percent lower, and many
hotels offer special golf packages. I list the courses in geographical order,
starting in San José, heading down along the Corridor, and ending in Cabo
San Lucas (for specifics on the playability of the various courses, see the
“Lowdown on golfing in Cabo” sidebar in this chapter):
 As with many things in Los Cabos, visitors find that the most eco-
nomical way to enjoy this sport is to play in San José. Greens fees
at the nine-hole Mayan Resort Golf Los Cabos (previously the Club
Campo de Golf San José; Paseo Finisterra, across from the Howard
Johnson Hotel; % 624-142-0900 or 142-0905) are just $99 for nine
holes or $119 for 18 holes. They offer discounted rates if you bring
your own equipment, and also for tee times between 2 and 6 p.m.
The course is open daily from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and club guests
can also use the swimming pool.
 The newest course to open in Los Cabos is Querencia (Bulevar
Querencia 1; % 624-145-6670), a Tom Fazio–designed course,
which includes an 18-hole championship course along with a nine-
hole Fazio short course and practice facility. It’s billed as a strictly
private club with play limited to property owners and golf club
members, however, you may find there are provisions for guests of
the resort hotels along the Corridor.
 The 27-hole course at the Palmilla Golf Club (One&Only Palmilla
resort, the Corridor; % 800-386-2465 in the U.S., or 624-144-5250;
www.palmillaresort.com) was the first Jack Nicklaus Signature
layout in Mexico. The course was built in 1992 on 900 acres of 
dramatic oceanfront and desert. The 27-hole course offers you a
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
440

choice between two back-nine options. High-season greens fees are
$220 (lower after 1 p.m.), and low-season greens fees are between
$120 and $210. Although Palmilla is currently a semiprivate club,
most Corridor hotels have membership benefits.
 Just a few miles down the road from the Palmilla is another Jack
Nicklaus Signature course, the 18-hole Ocean Course at Cabo del
Sol (Cabo del Sol resort, the Corridor; % 866-231-4677 in the U.S.,
or 624-145-8200; www.cabodelsol.com). The 7,100-yard course is
known for its challenging final three holes. Tom Weiskopf designed
the new 18-hole Desert Course, also at Cabo del Sol. Greens fees are
$220 to $295.
 Robert Trent Jones, Jr., designed this 18-hole, 6,945-yard course at
Cabo Real (Meliá Cabo Real resort, the Corridor; % 800-543-2044
in the U.S., or 624-144-0232; www.caboreal.com), which features
holes that sit high on mesas overlooking the Sea of Cortez. Fees run
$260 for 18 holes, $180 after 3 p.m.
 The El Dorado Golf Course (Meliá Cabo Real resort, next to the
Westin Regina hotel, the Corridor; % 877-795-8727 in the U.S., or
624-144-5451) is a Jack Nicklaus Signature course. The course is open
daily from 7 a.m. until dusk. Eighteen holes are $260. After 2 p.m., a
twilight special offers a round for $168. Carts are included; caddies
are available for $80.
 Located in Cabo San Lucas, the Raven Club (Palo Blanco 501; 
% 888-328-8501 in the U.S., or 624-143-4653; Fax: 624-143-5809) 
features an 18-hole course designed by two members of the Dye
family, so the front and back nines play like two different courses.
The entire course overlooks the juncture of the Pacific Ocean and
Sea of Cortez, including the famous Land’s End rocks. The layout
includes the 607-yard, par-five seventh hole — the longest hole in
Mexico. Greens fees are $176 for morning tee times, $160 for the
noon rate (noon–2:30 p.m.), and $127 after 2:30 p.m.
Several specialty tour operators offer golf packages to Los Cabos, which
include accommodations, greens fees, and other amenities. Among the
best is Sportours (% 888-GOLF-MEX from the U.S., no phone in Mexico;
www.sportours.com).
Making time for tennis
You can play tennis at the two courts of the Mayan Resort Golf Los
Cabos (Paseo Finisterra 1; % 624-142-0905) for $13 an hour during the
day or $22 an hour at night. (Club guests can also use the swimming
pool.) Tennis is also available at the One&Only Palmilla (two lighted
courts) classes $70 an hour and regular playing free of charge, guests
only and the Presidente InterContinental (two lighted courts) $10 an
hour.

442
Lowdown on golfing in Cabo
Golf isn’t always how you play the course, but how the course plays you. Los Cabos
is now considered one of the world’s finest golf destinations, which means some of
the courses can be pretty challenging. Picking a course that matches your abilities is
important so that a challenge doesn’t become a frustration. Los Cabos has an ample
and intriguing variety of courses for golfers of all levels.
Beyond the selection, quality, and beauty of the courses in Los Cabos, a key reason
so many golfers choose to play here is the very reliable weather. The courses high-
lighted in this chapter compare to the great ones in Palm Springs and Scottsdale with
the added beauty of the ocean views, as well as the wider variety of desert cacti and
flowering plants.
Course fees are high in Cabo — generally over $200 per round. But these are world-
class courses, worth the world-class price. Courses generally offer 20 percent to 30
percent off rates if you play after 2 or 2:30 p.m. This is actually a great time to play,
because the temperature is cooler and play is generally faster. The golf offerings in Los
Cabos will only continue to expand; four courses are in various phases of construc-
tion. At Puerto Los Cabos, a new mega-development northeast of San José del Cabo,
construction has started on the first of two 18-hole courses, with nine holes designed
by Jack Nicklaus, and the other nine by Greg Norman. It’s scheduled to be playable
by June 2006. At the other end of the peninsula near Cabo San Lucas on the Pacific
side, the Cabo Pacífica development will soon be launching two more championship
courses. Below are a Cabo’s best courses:
 Cabo del Sol: The Ocean Course was the second Jack Nicklaus course con-
structed in Los Cabos. It is much more difficult than the Palmilla course, with less
room for error. 
Don’t be fooled by the wide, welcoming first hole. This is challenging target golf,
with numerous forced carries — even from the red tees. Seven holes are along
the water. At the par-three signature 17th hole, the golfer is faced with a 178-yard
shot over sandy beach and rocky outcroppings to a tiny green framed by bunkers
on one side and a drop to the ocean on the other. The finishing hole, guarded by
desert and cactus on the right and rock cliffs leading to the sea on the left, is mod-
eled after the 18th at Pebble Beach.
Cabo del Sol offers another option, the Desert Course, which is Tom Weiskopf’s
first course design in Mexico. Spread over 56 hectares (140 acres) of gently rolling
desert terrain, it provides sweeping ocean views. The course’s large landing
areas ensure a pleasant game for players at all levels.
 Cabo Real: This Robert Trent Jones, Jr., design is known for its holes along the
Sea of Cortez; exceptional among these is the frequently photographed 12th hole,
which sits high on a mesa facing the sea. Jones designed the course to test low
handicappers, but multiple tees make it enjoyable for average players as well.
While the first six holes are in mountainous terrain, others skirt the shore. Rolling
greens and strategically placed bunkers on narrow terrain work their way up to

Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 443
the sixth tee, 138m (460 ft.) above sea level. The par-72 layout is 6,945 yards long
and was designed with professional tournament play in mind. The most celebrated
hole, the 15th, sits right on the beach between the Meliá Cabo Real Golf & Beach
Resort and Las Ventanas al Paraíso.
 El Dorado Golf Course: Another Jack Nicklaus Signature course located at Meliá
Cabo Real, El Dorado is a links-style course in the Scottish tradition. The layout is
challenging — seven holes border the Sea of Cortez and 12 are carved out of two
pristine canyons. The ocean isn’t the only water you see on this course — 
man-made lakes are also a part of the scenery. El Dorado bills itself as the “Pebble
Beach of Baja” — but then again, so does Cabo del Sol — you decide. Note that
this course was recently purchased and is in the process of being redesigned; it
was closed at press time, but scheduled reopen sometime in 2006.
 The Raven Club (formerly known as the Cabo San Lucas Country Club): Different
Dye family members designed the front and back nine here, so the course plays
like two different courses. It has deep waste bunkers, subtle terracing up hill-
sides, and holes built into the natural desert terrain. The most challenging hole is
the extremely long, 607-yard, par-five seventh around a lake; it’s the longest hole
in Mexico. The Dye family redid the whole course in 2002. Although the layout is
essentially the same, some greens have moved slightly and some holes are a little
shorter than before, but all the bunkers and hazards have remained, and the
course is now considered better than before. From the greens on higher ground,
you’ll enjoy views overlooking the famous El Arco, the Sea of Cortez, the town of
Cabo San Lucas, and the Pacific Ocean.
 Palmilla Golf Club: The original Cabo course is now a 27-hole layout. You must
play the Arroyo (the original front nine) for your first nine holes, and then you
choose between Mountain (the name given to the original back nine) and Ocean
Nine (the new holes — although these newer holes lie closer to the water, only
one of them has a true ocean view) for your back nine. If you play this course only
once, choose the Mountain back nine — it offers better ocean views. The views
at the mountaintop clubhouse are also pretty spectacular. The eventual plan is
for this course to be exclusive to One&Only Palmilla guests and residents of the
adjacent real estate development. It’s beautiful, playable, and well maintained,
and views of desert mountains and the cobalt ocean without any interfering con-
struction are featured throughout. It’s one of a handful of places in the world
where a golfer can play by water, mountain, and desert views surrounded by flow-
ering vegetation. Bermuda short-cut grass makes putting fast, and the signature
hole is the Mountain five hole; you hit over a canyon and then down to the greens
below over a forced carry. This is target golf, and as a Jack Nicklaus course, the
layout was constructed with strategy in mind. A mountaintop clubhouse provides
spectacular views. Although it is currently a semiprivate club, most Corridor hotels
have membership benefits. The eventual plan is for guests of the One&Only
Palmilla and residents of the adjacent real estate development to have exclusive
use of this course.

Taking Adventure and Nature Tours
Expeditions on all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) to the Cabo Falso lighthouse
and La Candelaria (an Indian pueblo in the mountains) are among the
most popular of the adventure tours available in Los Cabos. These
excursions are a great way to explore the land, and they’re available
through most travel agencies.
 The three-hour tour to Cabo Falso includes a stop at the beach, a
look at some sea-turtle nests (without disturbing them) and the
remains of a 1912 shipwreck, a ride over 150m (500-ft.) sand dunes,
and a visit to the lighthouse. Guided tours cost around $45 per
person on a single vehicle or $60 for two people riding on one ATV.
You can also rent ATVs for $35 for three hours. Ask your hotel
concierge for more information.
 La Candelaria is an isolated Indian village in the mountains 40km
(25 miles) north of Cabo San Lucas. As described in National
Geographic, the old pueblo is known for the white and black witch-
craft still practiced here. An underground river that emerges at the
pueblo provides water for the lush landscape of palms, mango
trees, and bamboo. The tour’s return trip travels down a steep
canyon, along a beach (giving you time to swim), and past giant
sea-turtle nesting grounds. Departing at 9 a.m., the La Candelaria
tour costs around $80 per person or $100 for two on the same ATV.
Driving Tours
A uniquely “Cabo” experience is offered by Outback Baja (% 624-142-
9200; Fax: 624-142-3166; www.bajaoutback.com) via their caravan style
Hummer Adventures. You drive these luxury Hummer H2s, going off-road
to cruise desert and beachfront terrain in style while learning about the
surrounding area by expert guides. Communication links the up to ten
vehicles in the caravan, allowing you to listen to the narrations of the
guide. There’s a choice of four routes, which include treks to Todos
Santos, the East Cape, Santiago and Cañon de la Zorra, and Rancho la
Verdad. Tours depart at 9 a.m. and return at 3 p.m., with prices ranging
from $165 to $220, depending upon the route, and include lunch. Visa,
MasterCard, and American Express are accepted, and you must bring your
valid driver’s license. Special group rates are also available.
If that sounds too tame, Wide Open Baja Racing Experience (% 888-
788-2252 or 949-340-1155 in the U.S., or 624-143-4170; office located in
Plaza Nautica; www.wideopencabo.com) gives you the chance to drive
actual Chenowth Magnum race cars at their 600-hectare (1,500-acre)
racing ranch on the Pacific Coast. There’s a varied terrain to drive, 
with twists, turns, sand-washes, and plenty of bumps for thrillseekers.
Session times for the Test Drive are at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. The price of
$250 includes shuttle transportation from downtown Cabo to the ranch,
driver orientation, and safety equipment. Private group rates are also
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
444

available. Wide Open Baja also offers multi-day tours driving race vehi-
cles through Cabo, Ensenada, and the entire Baja peninsula.
A variety of land- and water-based adventure and nature tours are avail-
able through Tio Sports (% 624-143-3399; www.tiosports.com),
including the popular ATV tours to Cabo Falso and Candelaria and para-
sailing at $50 single or $70 tandem. Gray Line Tours (% 624-146-9410)
is a great contact for a complete rundown of what’s available. They offer
all the tours from all the local companies rather than working with only
a select few.
For horseback riding, here are a couple of good options for the Los
Cabos area:
 I highly recommend Cuadra San Francisco Equestrian Center,
Km 19.5 along the Corridor, in front of the Casa del Mar resort 
(% 624-144-0160). Master horseman Francisco Barrena, with more
than 30 years of experience in training horses and operating eques-
trian schools, can assist any level rider in selecting and fitting a
horse to his or her skill level. Your choice of English or Western
saddles are available on well-trained, exceptional horses. A two-
hour canyon ride in and around Arroyo San Carlos or Venado
Blanco costs $80; a one-hour ride to the beach or desert is $35.
 Rancho Collins (% 624-143-3652) also has horses available for
rent for $25 per hour, with guide. Rides include trotting along the
beach and sunset tours. They also take you to the Pacific for
sunset-riding on the beach for a cost of $35 per person per hour.
It’s open daily from 8 a.m. to noon and 2 to 5 p.m. They’re located
in front of the Hotel Club Cascadas de Baja.
Sightseeing in Los Cabos
Sports and partying are Cabo’s main attractions, but you can find a 
few — very few is a better description — cultural and historical points
of interest. In San José, the Spanish missionary Nicolás Tamaral estab-
lished the stone Iglesia de San Lucas (Church of San Lucas; Calle Cabo
San Lucas, close to the main plaza; no phone) in 1730. According to local
lore, the Pericúe Indians reportedly resisted Tamaral’s demands that
they practice monogamy and eventually killed the missionary. Buildings
on the streets facing the main plaza in San José are being renovated to
house restaurants and shops, and the picturesque neighborhood prom-
ises to have the strongest Mexican ambience of any place in town.
Shopping in Los Cabos
San José has the better shopping of the two towns when it comes to
higher quality items, but if you’re after a beer-themed T-shirt, Cabo San
Lucas can’t be topped. In San José, a growing selection of unique shops,
Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 445

hip boutiques, and collections of fine Mexican artesanía (handicrafts) 
is clustered around Bulevar Mijares and Zaragoza, the main street. The
municipal market on Mauricio Castro and Green has edibles and utilitar-
ian wares.
In Cabo San Lucas, the most notable shops are now concentrated in the
Puerto Paraíso Entertainment Plaza. Opened in 2002, this is now the
focal point for shopping for tourists, complete with parking, a food
court, movie theatres, and a video arcade. With more than 50,000 sq. m
(538,195 sq. ft.) of air-conditioned space on three levels, it’s too bad that
the shops don’t live up to the promise of this attractive mall. Although it
bills itself as having an array of designer shops, this claim is a bit mis-
leading; you may find only one or two name-brand items within any
store, and many of the locales are vacant. It is a good place to shop for
swimwear or resort wear, and there are plenty of gift items to choose
from, but don’t expect the equivalent of a U.S. shopping mall experience.
However, Puerto Paraíso does have some choice dining options, the best
being the local branch of Ruth’s Chris Steak House (adjacent to the
marina; % 624-144-3232). The plaza is located marina-side between the
Plaza Bonita Mall and Marina Fiesta Resort — you couldn’t miss it if you
tried. Most other shops in Cabo are on or within a block or two of
Bulevar Marina and the plaza.
Clothing
Escape (Plaza Florentine, Zaragoza 20, across from the cathedral in San
José; % 624-142-2799) features designer and casual sportswear and
accessories including designer jeans, leather bags, belts, and a trendy
selection of sunglasses. An interior-décor shop by the same name next
door has a small cafe and espresso bar in the connecting courtyard.
H2O has a tempting selection of women’s swimwear, casual wear, dresses
and evening wear, as well as casual resortwear for men (Vicente Guerrero
and Madero; % 624-143-1219). The gallery is open Monday to Saturday 9
a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. They accept MasterCard and Visa.
Contemporary art
San José has a growing number of art galleries — mainly artist studios
open to the public — and the town’s creative ambience is blossoming.
The most notable gallery is Galería Wentworth Porter (Av. Obregón 20;
%/fax 624-142-3141), which features a selection of original fine art along
with prints and art cards by local artists. As the name implies, the work
of locally popular artist Dennis Wentworth Porter figures prominently.
The gallery is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The area’s longest-standing art gallery, in Cabo San Lucas, is the Golden
Cactus Studio-Gallery (Vicente Guerrero and Madero; % 614-143-6399;
www.goldencactusgallery.com), which shows original art by regional
artists, including Chris MacClure, as well as reproductions and posters
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
446

of popular Mexican works. It’s open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m.
Also in Cabo San Lucas, in the Medano Beach area, the handsome Galería
Gattamelata (Hacienda Rd.; % 624-143-1166) specializes in antiques and
colonial-style furniture. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Crafts, gifts, and jewelry
Copal (in San José at Plaza Mijares; % 624-142-3070) features traditional
and contemporary Mexican artesanía and silver jewelry in a former resi-
dence tastefully converted into a contemporary shop. You can shop here
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.
Cuca’s Blanket Factory (in Cabo San Lucas at Cárdenas and Matamoros;
% 624-143-4575) is an open-air stand that sells standard, Mexican, cotton
and woolen blankets with an added attraction — you can design your own
blanket and have it ready the next day. The stand is open daily from 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m.
For unusual and well-priced jewelry, visit SAX (Mijares 2 in San José; 
% 624-142-4696; www.saxstyle.com), where two local designers create
one-of-a-kind pieces using silver, coral, and semi-precious stones. They
can even create a special request design for you, ready in 24 hours.
Located next to Casa Natalia, SAX is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., closed
Sundays.
Decorative and folk art
Arte, Diseño y Decoración (ADD; Zaragoza at Hidalgo, San José; % 624-
142-2777) sells creative home accessories and furnishings, mostly made
of rustic wood, pewter, and Talavera ceramics, and offers shipping serv-
ices back home for travelers who shop too much and can’t carry it all.
Other stores
The Plaza Bonita Shopping Center (Bulevar Marina at Cárdenas) is an
older shopping center that is still worth a visit. This large terra-cotta-
colored plaza on the edge of the Cabo San Lucas marina has been
around since 1990, and it finally has a group of successful businesses. A
branch of Dos Lunas (% 624-143-1969) sells colorful casual sportswear.
Cartes (% 624-143-1770) offers hand-painted ceramic vases and dishes,
pewter frames, carved furniture, and hand-woven textiles. Most shops in
the plaza are open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Ultrafemme is Mexico’s largest duty-free shop, with an excellent selection
of fine jewelry and watches, including Rolex, Cartier, Omega, TAG Heuer,
and Tissot; perfumes (Lancôme, Chanel, Armani, Carolina Herrera); and
other gift items, all at duty free prices. It’s located in Plaza Ultrafemme
(Bulevar Marina, across from Carlos & Charlies; % 624-145-6090 or 145-
6099; www.ultrafemme.com.mx), and is open daily, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.
Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 447

One of the spiffiest (but commercial) shops in Los Cabos is Mamma Eli’s
(Calle Cabo San Lucas, west of the plaza at Madero; % 624-143-1616), a
three-level store packed with folk art, crafts, clothing, and furniture. It’s
open Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m.
Books, Books, in Cabo San Lucas (Bulevar Marina 7n, Plaza de la Danza
next to Dairy Queen; % 624-143-3172 or 143-3173), sells a good selec-
tion of English- and Spanish-language books, magazines, and newspa-
pers, as well as a fine collection of regional guides and publications. This
location is open daily from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. A second location in San
José, at Bulevar Mijares 41 near the Tropicana Inn (% 624-142-4433), 
is open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
For fine Cuban cigars and cigarettes, as well as Veracruz cigars, a visit to
Los Amigos Smokeshop and Cigar Bar (% 624-142-1138) in San José is
a must. Here you can buy not only high-quality cigars but also a whole
range of smoking accessories, including humidors and cutters, with
friendly assistance from a knowledgeable staff. In a new, expanded loca-
tion (Hidalgo 11, across from the French Riviera bakery), they offer 
private lockers, a bar with an excellent selection of single malts and
California wines, Wednesday evening cigar tastings, and a VIP club for
frequent visitors. Los Amigos is open Monday to Wednesday 9 a.m. to 
8 p.m. and Thursday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
For smokes in Cabo, visit J & J Habanos Cabo’s largest cigar shop, sell-
ing premium Cuban and fine Mexican cigars — it even has a walk-in
humidor. It’s found on Madero between Bulevar Marina and Guerrero
(% 624-143-6160 or 143-3839) and is open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m. 
to 10 p.m.; Sunday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and accepts American Express,
MasterCard, and Visa.
A large selection of fine tequilas and other liquors, as well as cigars, is
available at Tequila’s House. There are two locations: Bulevar Marina
624, in front of Caliente (% 624-143-5666), and Morelos at Lázaro
Cárdenas (% 624-143-9070). Both are open Monday to Saturday 8 a.m.
to 11 p.m.; they accept MasterCard and Visa.
Embarking on a Side Trip
You can book a day trip to the city of La Paz through a travel agency for
around $55, which includes beverages and a tour of the countryside
along the way. The tours usually stop at the weaving shop of Fortunato
Silva, who spins his own cotton and weaves it into wonderfully textured
rugs and textiles. Day trips are also available to Todos Santos for $95,
including a guided walking tour of the Cathedral Mission, a museum, the
Hotel California, and various artists’ homes.
A few years back, Todos Santos became known as “Bohemian Baja.” 
It found its way on the travel agendas of folks looking for the latest, 
the trendiest, and the hippest of artist outposts — and in the plans of
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
448

travelers who were simply weary of the L.A.-ization of Cabo San Lucas.
In no time, Todos Santos blossomed as a true gem of a place that seems
to foster the creative spirit while retaining its pervasive beauty and
lovely heritage that held the original attraction.
The art and artistry created here now — from the culinary plate to the
canvas — cares less about commercial appeal than quality, and in doing
so, it becomes more of a draw. Don’t overlook the attendant arts of agri-
culture, masonry, and weavings that some of the town’s original residents
created. From the superb meals at Café Santa Fe to an afternoon spent
browsing the numerous shops and galleries, Todos Santos is intriguing 
to its core. Following is a sampling of what the town has to offer:
 For me — and I suspect for many others — a meal at the Café Santa
Fe (Calle Centenario 4; % 612-145-0340) is reason enough to visit
Todos Santos. Much of the attention the town has received in
recent years can be directly attributed to this outstanding cafe,
which opened 15 years ago; it continues to live up to its lofty repu-
tation. Owners Ezio and Paula Colombo refurbished a large stucco
house across from the plaza, creating an exhibition kitchen, several
dining rooms, and a lovely courtyard adjacent to a garden of hibis-
cus, bougainvillea, papaya trees, and herbs.
The excellent Northern Italian cuisine emphasizes local produce
and seafood. Try the homemade ravioli stuffed with spinach and
ricotta in a Gorgonzola sauce or the ravioli with lobster and shrimp
accompanied by one of their organic salads. In high season, the
wait for a table at lunch can last quite a while. Everything is pre-
pared fresh when ordered, and reservations are recommended.
Main courses run between $35 and $40. The restaurant is open
Wednesday through Monday from noon to 9 p.m., but it’s closed
September 1 to October 30.
 A more casual option, and a magical place to kick off a day in Todos
Santos, is the garden setting of the Caffé Todos Santos (Calle
Centenario 33, across from the Todos Santos Inn; % 612-145-0300).
Try the bowl-sized cafe latte with a freshly baked croissant or one
of the cafe’s signature cinnamon buns. Lunch or a light meal may
include a frittata or a fish filet wrapped in banana leaves with
coconut milk. Main courses average $6 to $20, and the cafe is open
Tuesday through Sunday from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Monday from 
7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 A new and notable addition is the La Coronela restaurant/bar (Calle
Benito Juárez and Morelos; % 612-145-0525), at the recently remod-
eled Hotel California (allegedly the inspiration for The Eagles’ popu-
lar song of the same name). With its high-style design (think Philipe
Stark meets Baja), the Belgian chef creates a changing menu to
accompany the ever-present and very popular margaritas.
 At least a half dozen galleries are in town including the noted
Galería de Todos Santos (Topete and Legaspi; % 612-145-0500),
which features a changing collection of works by regional artists.
Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 449

 El Tecolote Libros (Hidalgo and Juárez; % 612-145-0295), though
tiny, gets my vote for the best bookstore in Mexico due to its excep-
tional selection of Latin American literature, poetry, children’s
books, and reference books centering on Mexico. You can purchase
English- and Spanish-language books, both new and used, along
with maps, magazines, cards, and art supplies. Adjacent to El
Tecolote (you enter through the bookshop) is the whimsical
Traditions shop that sells fun folk art and Mexican kitsch at its
best. It’s a great place for finding that perfect, creative, and inex-
pensive something to bring home.
Casual visitors can easily explore Todos Santos in a day, but a few tran-
quil inns welcome charmed guests who want to stay a little longer. You
can arrange a day’s visit through tour companies in Los Cabos or ven-
ture on your own with a rental car.
Discovering Los Cabos after Dark
San José’s nightlife is nonexistent outside of the restaurant and hotel
bars. The bars at Casa Natalia and Tropicana — the former catering to
sophisticated romantics and the latter to those in search of rowdier
good times — are particularly notable. On some weekends, Tropicana
even brings in a live Cuban band for dancing. Several of the larger hotels
along the beach have Mexican fiestas and other weekly theme nights
that include a buffet (usually all-you-can-eat), drinks, live music, and
entertainment for $25 to $35 per person. A large disco on Bulevar
Mijares seems to be under different ownership each year — it was
closed at press time but had a “re-opening soon” sign on the door. If
you’re looking for real nightlife, look to Cabo San Lucas, because even
the restaurants in San José close between 9 and 10 p.m.
In fact, Cabo San Lucas is the undisputed nightlife capital of Baja and a
contender for the title among all of Mexico’s resorts. After-dark fun is
centered around the party ambience and camaraderie found in the
casual bars and restaurants on Bulevar Marina and those facing the
marina, rather than around a flashy disco scene. You can easily find a
happy hour with live music and a place to dance or a Mexican fiesta 
with mariachis.
To enjoy live music in a more sedate setting, check out the Sancho
Panza Wine Bar and Bistro (% 624-143-3212; see “Hanging out and
happy hours,” later in this chapter). It offers classic jazz in a club-style
atmosphere that accommodates conversations.
Enjoying a theme night
Some of the larger hotels have weekly fiesta nights, Italian nights, and
other buffet-plus-entertainment theme nights that can be fun and a good
buy. Check with travel agencies and the following hotels: the Solmar
(% 624-143-3535), the Finisterra (% 624-143-3333), and the Meliá San
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
450

Lucas (% 624-145-7800). Prices generally range from $25 (drinks, tax,
and tips are extra) to $50 (everything is covered including an open bar
with national drinks).
Watching a sunset
At twilight, check out Land’s End — where the Sea of Cortez meets the
Pacific Ocean — and watch the sun sink into the Pacific. The Whale
Watcher’s Bar (Hotel Finisterra; % 624-143-3333) is considered Los
Cabos’ premier place for sunset-watching. Its location at Land’s End
offers a truly world-class view of the setting sun. The high terrace offers
vistas of both sea and beach as well as magical glimpses of whales from
January to March. “Whale margaritas” cost $6, and beers set you back
$3. The bar is open daily from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Hanging out and happy hours
If you shop around, you can usually find an hora alegre (happy hour)
somewhere in town between noon and 7 p.m. On my last visit, the most
popular places to drink and carouse until all hours were the Giggling
Marlin and El Squid Roe. Here are the best nightlife options:
 El Squid Roe (Bulevar Marina, opposite Plaza Bonita; % 624-143-
0655; www.elsquidroe.com) is one of the late Carlos Anderson’s
inspirations, and it still attracts wild, fun-loving crowds of all ages.
This two-story bar features nostalgic décor and eclectic food that’s
far better than you’d expect from such a party place. As fashion-
able as blue jeans, El Squid Roe is a place to see and see what can
be seen — women’s tops are known to be discarded with regularity
here as the tabletop dancing moves into high gear. A patio out back
serves as a place to dance when the tables, chairs, and bar spots
have all been taken. It’s open daily from noon to 4 a.m.
 Live music alternates with recorded tunes at the Giggling Marlin
(Cárdenas at Zaragoza, across from the marina; % 624-143-0606;
www.gigglingmarlin.com) to get the happy patrons dancing —
and occasionally jumping up to dance on the tables and bar. A 
contraption of winches, ropes, and pulleys above a mattress pro-
vides entertainment as couples literally string each other up by the
heels — just like a captured marlin. The food is only fair here; stick
with nachos and drinks. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. Drinks are
half-price during happy “hour,” which in the tradition of excess that
Cabo adores, lasts for four hours — 2 to 6 p.m.
 Latitude 22+ Roadhouse (Hwy. 1 Km 4.5, next to Costco; % 624-
143-1516; www.lat22nobaddays.com) is a semi-seedy restaurant/
bar. License plates, signs, sports caps, and a 959-pound blue marlin
are the backdrop for U.S. sports events that play on six TVs scat-
tered among pool tables, dart boards, and assorted games. The
kitchen offers dishes from hamburgers to chicken-fried steak, or
you can have breakfast any time. Latitude 22+ is a block north of
Chapter 33: Having Fun on and off the Beach in Los Cabos 451

the town’s only traffic light. It’s open from Wednesday to Monday 8
a.m. to 11 p.m., and is closed on Tuesdays.
 Mambo Café is a recent addition to the Cabo nightlife scene, part 
of a chain of bars around Mexico. It features a Caribbean concept
club with a marine tropical ambience, playing contemporary Latin
music. Live music is also featured. It’s open Tuesday through
Sunday from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. It’s located at Marina Local 9 and 10,
next to the Costa Real Cabo Resort (% 624-143-1484; www.mambo
cafe.com.mx). Cover charge, if any, varies with the night and the
entertainment.
 Nikki Beach, a haven of the hip that hails from South Beach, Miami
and St. Tropez, brought its ultra-cool vibe to the Meliá San Lucas
resort beachfront in March 2005. White-draped bed-size lounges
scatter the outdoor lounge area, under a canopy of umbrellas, sur-
rounding a pool and overlooking Cabo’s best swimming beach. A
teak deck offers covered dining. The music is the latest in elec-
tronic, house, and chill, with visiting DJs often playing on weekend
nights. Sundays feature their signature beach brunch. It’s a great
choice for catching rays during the day while sipping tropical
drinks, but its real appeal is the nocturnal action. It’s open Sunday
through Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. (food service stops at 
11 p.m.); Thursday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. (food
service stops at 1 a.m.), and is located on the beach at the Meliá San
Lucas, on Medano Beach (% 624-145-7800; www.nikkibeach.com).
 Finally, an alternative to beer bars! Sancho Panza Wine Bar and
Bistro (Plaza Las Glorias boardwalk, next to the lighthouse; % 624-
143-3212; www.sanchopanza.com) combines a gourmet-food market
with a wine bar that features live jazz music plus an intriguing menu
of nuevo-Latino cuisine. The place has a cozy neighborhood feeling.
Tourists and locals take advantage of the selection of more than 
150 wines, plus espresso drinks. During high season, you need reser-
vations. It’s open daily, 4 p.m. until the last guest leaves (the kitchen
remains open until 11 p.m.).
 The Tropicana Bar and Grill (Mijares 30, San José; % 624-142-0907)
is definitely the most popular place in San José. This long-standing
bar was undergoing extensive renovations during my last visit, but
promises to have a more elegant ambience — rather than its previ-
ous “rustic chic.” Don’t worry though, the Tropicana will still feature
all types of American sports events — on plasma TV screens — and
a new area to segregate drinkers from diners. Live mariachi music
plays nightly from 6 to 9 p.m., with live Mexican and Cuban dance
music playing from 9:30 p.m. until about 1 a.m. Truly, this is your
sole nightlife option in tranquil San José. The Tropicana is open daily
from 7 a.m. to 1 a.m.
Going dancing
Owned by Sammy Hagar (formerly of Van Halen) and his Mexican and
American partners, the Cabo Wabo Cantina (Vicente Guerrero at
Part IX: Los Cabos and Southern Baja 
452

Cárdenas; % 624-143-1188; www.cabowabo.com) packs in youthful
crowds — especially when rumors fly that a surprise appearance by a
vacationing musician is imminent. Rock bands from the United States,
Mexico, Europe, and Australia frequently perform live on the well-
equipped stage. When live music is absent, a disco-type sound system
plays mostly rock but some alternative and techno music as well.
Overstuffed furniture frames the dance floor. For snacks, the Taco-Wabo,
just outside the club’s entrance, stays up late too. The cantina is open
from 11 a.m. to 4 a.m.
Mens’ clubs
What do the guys do after they’re finished with golf? Often, they end the
evening at one of the many strip clubs in Cabo. There’s a changing selec-
tion of them to choose from, but the mainstays include Mermaid’s
(corner of Lázaro Cárdenas and Vicente Guerrero; % 624-143-5370;
www.loscabosnights.com/mermaids.htm), which offers its patrons
their choice of topless stage shows or private dances. Admission is $5
for the general show, or $20 for the private dances. It’s open nightly from
7 p.m. to 3 a.m. Another popular option is Twenty/20 Showgirls (Lázaro
Cárdenas at Francisco Villa; % 624-143-5380; www.loscabosnights.
com/exoticclubs/twenty20.htm), also with a bevy of beauties to
entertain you with their dancing skills on any one of the numerous
stages. It’s the largest of these clubs in Cabo. In addition to a topless
cabaret show, they offer topless lap dances, as well as televised sports,
pool tables and food service. It’s open from 8:30 p.m. to 3 a.m., closed
Tuesdays.

Ten Top Mexican Moments
In This Chapter

 Watching for whales along Mexico’s beaches
 Experiencing a singularly Mexican moment
W
ant to watch the sun sink into the horizon from the deck of a sail-
boat while balmy breezes swirl around you? Care to be amazed
by watching men leap into a narrow, rocky passage of surging ocean
from a ledge 39m (130 ft.) above the water’s surface?
Along with all of the classic, beach-going fun you can have at a Mexico
beach resort, several singular experiences exist that you can only have
here in grand old Mexico. These events become the unforgettable
moments that make traveling to another country and another land a
unique experience.
Enjoying a Mexican Fiesta
Mexican fiestas, colorful celebrations of Mexican food, dance, and fun,
are mainstays among the entertainment options at Mexican beach
resorts. Though the varieties of a fiesta mexicana can range from the
cheesy to the sublime, a fiesta is generally a party that begins with a
shot of tequila and an ample buffet, goes on to take you through presen-
tations of different regional dances, and ends in a display of fireworks.
¡Viva Mexico!
Setting Sail at Sunset
Virtually every Mexican beach resort offers some variation of the sunset
sail, which is just about the very best way to experience a Mexican beach
resort. In Acapulco, Ixtapa, Huatulco, and Puerto Vallarta, these trips
tend to be romantic bay cruises — with plenty of libations. In Cancún, try
a replica pirate cruise with a lobster dinner; in Los Cabos, make that sail
at sunset around the famous El Arco (The Arch) at the end of the Baja
Peninsula past Lovers Beach. No matter where you set sail from, an
excursion at sunset provides memories that can make a vacation.

Mixing It Up with Mariachi Music
From the first impressive note of the trombone, to the last strum of the
guitar, mariachi music is synonymous with Mexico. Strolling musicians,
often dressed to the nines in charro outfits and sombreros, play mari-
achi music on the streets and in restaurants.
Sipping on Margaritas at Sunset
Actually, feel free to pick your poison, but a cocktail at sunset is the
quintessential Mexican beach vacation experience. This plan works best
when you’re on the Pacific coast so that you can watch the sun sink
below the horizon; however, sipping at sunset on the East Coast doesn’t
seem to dampen the spirits either!
Strolling the Malecón
Call it a cheap thrill, but in most of Mexico’s beach resorts, one of the
best experiences is absolutely free — just stroll along the seaside walk-
way (malecón) in Puerto Vallarta or Zihuatanejo or sit in the plaza in San
José de Los Cabos or Acapulco. You’re certain to be both charmed and
entertained by the parade of local life. And while you’re at it, splurge on
classic fare sold by vendors — we’re talking corn on the cob and a color-
ful swirl of cotton candy.
Feasting on Fresh Fish under a Palapa
Eating fresh fish — or, more specifically, grilled fresh fish on a plate
served under a palapa (a thatched umbrella) by the ocean’s edge and
accompanied by a cold cerveza (beer) and a balmy sea breeze — is an
experience. We promise — you’ve never tasted anything more delicious.
Looking for Whales in Baja or Puerto Vallarta
Watching the majestic — and enormous — whales leap out of the water,
splash their tail, or corral in their young is a thrill. Each winter, whales
migrate to Mexico’s Pacific shores. You can find the greatest concentra-
tion of whales in Baja California and in Banderas Bay, just offshore
Puerto Vallarta. Ecologically sensitive whale-watching tours are becom-
ing a favored Mexico-vacation experience.
Watching Cliff Divers in Acapulco
The only place in the world to see this sight is in Acapulco — bikini
brief–clad men dive from a rocky cliff into the roaring surf of a narrow
Part X: The Part of Tens 
458

crevice 39m (130 ft.) below. Why? Because they can . . . and because you
keep watching them do it! Don’t miss this sight when in Acapulco.
Visiting Tulum
Although Tulum isn’t the largest or most important Maya ruin, it’s 
the only one by the sea, which makes it the most visually impressive.
Ancient Tulum is a stunning site — and our personal favorite of all the
ruins — poised on a rocky hill overlooking the transparent, turquoise
Caribbean Sea. You can’t visually sum up Mexico’s combination of exqui-
site beaches and a centuries-old culture more aptly.
Shopping — While Sunbathing
Call it Mexican multitasking, but you can make the most of your precious
vacation time by doing a little shopping while soaking up the sun. Along
Mexico’s public beaches, being approached by strolling vendors, ped-
dling everything from silver jewelry to Spiderman parachute dolls, is
quite common. Woven baskets, colorful ceramics, and even woven rugs
are also common finds. And the shopping isn’t limited to tangibles —
services are available as well! Have your hair braided, your portrait
sketched, or even get a temporary tattoo, all from the comfort of your
beach chair. Where else but Mexico?

Ten Myths and
Misconceptions 
about Mexico
In This Chapter
 Getting the geography straight
 Dissecting the stereotypical preconceptions
 Steering clear of illegal activities
 Solving food and drink misconceptions
 Respecting the country and its residents
I
f you’ve never visited Mexico, you may have some preconceptions
about what you’re likely to find here. Perhaps you think that the 
geography — apart from the beaches — is an arid landscape with a uni-
formly hot climate. Or you may think that you should only drink tequila
as a shot — doused with lime and salt.
This chapter explains some of the most common misconceptions about
this vast country and its rich culture. Read on — and the next time
someone starts talking about how you shouldn’t drink the water in
Mexico, you can set them straight!
Mexico Is a Desert, and It’s Hot Everywhere
Not true: Mexico’s geography includes pine forests, and occasional
snowfalls hit some of the country’s higher elevations. Most of the beach
resorts in this book, however, do enjoy sultry climates, but bringing
along a sweater or light jacket for cool evenings, especially during winter
months, is always wise.

Mexico Is the Land of Sombreros and Siestas
The common image of a Mexican napping under his sombrero exists in
some minds, but this stereotype is mostly made of myth. Today, Mexico
is a mix of contemporary business professionals and traditional agrarian
populations. The afternoon break — between 2 and 4 p.m. — is still a
wonderful tradition, but rather than being a time for siesta, it’s the time
when families come together for the day’s main meal. 
Mexico Has No Drinking or Drug Laws
Because of the welcoming and casual nature of Mexico, many visitors
believe that the sale of alcoholic beverages — or illegal drugs — is
unregulated. This belief simply isn’t true. The legal drinking age in
Mexico is 18, and technically, you’re not allowed to drink openly in
public. However, if you’re not acting intoxicated, you can generally enjoy
a beer or even a cocktail while you stroll around town. As with most
things in Mexico, it’s not what you do but how you do it. Although you
can drink on public beaches, you can’t be inebriated in public. 
With regard to drugs, we want to get straight to the point: They’re illegal,
and carrying even a small amount of marijuana can earn you a very
unpleasant trip to jail. Remember that Mexican law states that you’re
guilty until proven innocent.
If in Trouble, Pay a Mordida
Although the idea of paying a mordida, or “bite,” may have been rooted
in truth for a long time, in Mexico’s new political era, an active campaign
is underway to keep dishonesty to a minimum and to clean house of cor-
rupt public servants. Many old-school traffic cops still take a bribe when
offered; however, officers belonging to the new generation of federal
policemen are tested for honesty, and the penalties for corrupt behavior
are severe — as are the penalties for those civilians inducing corruption
by offering bribes to police officers. Our suggestion is don’t offer a “tip”
to ease your way out of trouble; the best course of action is to just act
politely and find out what the problem is.
All Mexican Food Is Spicy
Not all Mexican food is spicy — although Mexican food does include
some of the most intriguingly flavored foods we’ve ever enjoyed.
Although spicy sauces may likely be in the vicinity of the food you’re
served, the truth is that many delicious Mexican dishes don’t include
chile peppers among their ingredients.
Chapter 35: Ten Myths and Misconceptions about Mexico 461

Don’t Drink the Water
In the past, visitors often returned home from Mexico with stomach 
illnesses, but this type of vacation souvenir is a rarity today. Massive
investments in an improved infrastructure and a general increase in
standards of cleanliness and hygiene have practically wiped out the
problem. However, play it safe and drink bottled water. Ice served in
tourist establishments is purified.
Tequila Is Best with a Pinch of Salt and Lime
Tequila is a drink to be appreciated and sipped — not slammed down 
in a shot, its flavor masked by salt and lime. If you need to do that,
you’re drinking the wrong tequila. Insist on only 100-percent blue agave
tequila — the mark of a pure, quality tequila — and then discover how
to appreciate the subtleties and nuances of this tasteful beverage.
A Jeep Rental Is Really $10 a Day
One of the most common lures a timeshare salesperson uses is the “Rent
a Jeep for $10 per day” enticement. Sure, it’s true that the Jeep is only
$10, but only after you spend up to half a day listening to an often high-
pressured sales pitch. You decide — what’s your vacation time really
worth? And always remember: If it looks too good to be true . . .
Going Anywhere in Just Your 
Swimsuit Is Okay
Although you may be at a seaside resort, keep in mind that it’s also a
home and place of business for many Mexicans. Wearing swim trunks or
a pareo skirt wrapped around your bikini is okay while you’re on your
way to the beach, but we recommend that you put on a shirt or a sun-
dress when you plan to explore the town. You can still go casual, but
Mexicans frown upon tourists who can’t tell the difference between
beach and town attire — especially true when it comes to going into any
church wearing inappropriate clothing. 
Mexicans Who Don’t Speak English 
Are Hard of Hearing
Or at least it appears that many tourists buy into this statement. Some
travelers seem to believe that a native Spanish-speaker will somehow
Part X: The Part of Tens 
462

get over his or her inability to understand English if the English-speaking
individual talks really loudly into the Spanish-speaker’s face. The truth 
is that many Mexicans understand at least some English, especially in
popular tourist areas. Try this: Instead of panicking and starting to yell
in order to get your point across, ask nicely for help, and an English-
speaking local will come to assist you.

Ten Most Deliciously
Mexican Dishes
In This Chapter
 Knowing your Mexican meals and sauces
 Indulging in uniquely Mexican beverages
S
ome like it hot . . . and then there’s Mexican food! But true Mexican
cuisine is noted more for its unique way of combining flavors —
chocolate and chiles, sweet and hot — than for its fire appeal.
This chapter explains some of the most flavorful and traditional Mexican
dishes that you’re likely to find on a menu here — go ahead and be
adventurous! Let your taste buds have a vacation from the foods you
know — explore the favored flavors of Mexico.
Café de Olla
The popularity and tradition of drinking coffee is nothing new to Mexico,
so to experience a taste of the past, try the traditional Mexican version
called café de olla. The espresso-strength coffee is prepared in an earth-
enware pot. It’s spiced with cinnamon, cloves, and raw brown sugar. It’s
certain to wake you up!
Ceviche
Ceviche is one of Mexico’s more traditional ways to enjoy fish and
seafood. Ceviche is usually made of fish, but it may also be made from
seafood including shrimp, octopus, crab, and even conch. The fresh fish —
or seafood — is marinated in lime and vinegar and mixed with chopped
tomatoes, onions, and, depending on the region, cucumbers and carrots.

Chilaquiles
One of the most traditional and satisfying breakfast dishes in Mexico is
chilaquiles, fried tortilla strips cooked in a mild or spicy red or green
sauce. They’re usually served with a fried egg or shredded chicken and
topped with fresh cream, chopped onions, and shredded white cheese.
Licuados
Not quite a meal, yet much more than a beverage, licuados are essen-
tially smoothies, blended drinks of fresh fruit, ice, and either water or
milk. Popular flavors include mango, banana, pineapple, or watermelon.
You can also make up your own combination of tropical fruit flavors!
Mole
Mole is a rich sauce that’s often considered Mexico’s most important culi-
nary contribution. A thick, deeply colored sauce, mole comes in hues of
green, red, yellow, and even black. Mole blends the flavors of fresh and
dried peppers, nuts, and — depending on the area — fruits or chocolate.
Mole is traditionally served with chicken but is sometimes found accom-
panying fish and pork. It truly reflects the spirit of Mexico — the ingredi-
ents are a combination of both European and pre-Hispanic elements. The
final taste varies according to the individual chef. If we had to compare it
with something, curry would be the closest association.
Pescadillas
Pescadillas, flour tortillas filled with melted cheese and fresh grilled fish,
are truly succulent. Most places serve them with a mild tomato sauce.
Pescado Sarandeado or Pescado en Talla
You’re at a Mexican beach resort, so you’re almost certain to indulge in
the fresh fish (pescado). One of the most traditional and tasty ways to
prepare fish is sarandeado (the term used along the beaches of Puerto
Vallarta) or en talla (as they refer to this dish in Acapulco and Huatulco).
The fish is prepared by marinating it in a sauce of Worcestershire, lime,
mild red-pepper paste, and other seasonings that vary slightly depend-
ing on the region. The fish is then cooked slowly over a wood fire. The
Mexican-Caribbean variation of this fish is called tikik-chik or tikin-chik,
and it includes a regional achiote (annatto seed) paste in the marinade.
Chapter 36: Ten Most Deliciously Mexican Dishes 465

Pozole
A traditional dish from the coastal states of Jalisco, Colima, and
Guerrero, pozole represents the blending of the pre-Hispanic Mexican
culture and European influences. It’s a souplike dish made with hominy
and pork, but nowadays many places make it with chicken. You can find
red, green, and white versions of pozole, depending on the area, and gar-
nishes include shredded lettuce, radish slices, or cabbage.
Tacos al Pastor
When ordered from a street vendor, tacos al pastor are only for the more
adventurous travelers, but they’re truly a Mexican specialty. Tacos al
pastor are made from shanks of marinated pork, which are skewered and
slowly cooked on a vertical charcoal grill. The traditional ones are
served with a chunk of fresh pineapple, diced onion, and cilantro. You
may have heard about the dangers of eating tacos on the street; how-
ever, the common sense that you apply to purchasing food from any
street vendor also applies here. If you want to be really safe, though, we
recommend you enjoy them at a small taco restaurant rather than from
a street stall.
Tamales
Tamales in Mexico are quite different from the ones you typically find 
in the United States, which tend to be compact and greasy. In Mexico,
these tasty bundles of corn dough are fluffy and come with a variety of
fillings ranging from spicy to sweet. One popular variety is rajas con
queso, a filling of poblano pepper strips and cheese. Other possibilities
are rojos (red) or verdes (green) tamales filled with shredded chicken or
pork — the names refer to the type of sauce included. Sweet tamales
may come filled with cinnamon and raisins, stewed mangoes, or pineap-
ple. On the southern-Pacific coast, tamales come wrapped in banana
leaves and have a heavier consistency. Traditional Oaxaqueño (from
Oaxaca) tamales are filled with mole and chicken and wrapped in palm
leaves.

Cabo (Plaza La Misión, Local 1-b, Bulevar
Mijares/Paseo Finisterra; % 624-142-1306).
ATMs
Automated teller machines are widely
available in all major resort towns, with
fewer to be found in the smaller destina-
tions. They’re a great option to get cash at
an excellent exchange rate. To find the
closest ATM, visit the Web sites for the
most popular networks: Plus (www.
visa.com/pd/atm) and Cirrus (www.
mastercard.com/atmlocator). (See
Chapter 5 for further details.)
Business Hours
In general, businesses in resort destina-
tions are open daily between 9 a.m. and 
8 p.m.; although many close between 2 and
4 p.m. Smaller businesses also tend to
close on Sundays. The larger resort desti-
nations have extended business hours —
many shops stay open until 10 p.m. Bank
hours are Monday to Friday 8:30 or 9 a.m.
to anywhere between 3 and 7 p.m.
Increasingly, banks are offering Saturday
hours in at least one branch for at least a
half-day, usually from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m.
Credit Cards
Most stores, restaurants, and hotels
accept credit cards. However, smaller des-
tinations such as Puerto Escondido, where
telephone lines aren’t always available to
process the authorization for the charge,
may not be so credit-card friendly. The
same goes for smaller, family-run shops
and restaurants. You can withdraw cash
from your credit card at most ATMs, but

make sure that you know your PIN and
you’ve cleared the card for foreign with-
drawals with your bank. For credit-card
emergencies, call the following numbers:
American Express % 001-800-528-2122,
MasterCard % 001-800-MC-ASSIST, and
Visa % 001-800-847-2911. These numbers
connect you to the U.S. toll-free numbers
to report lost or stolen credit cards; how-
ever, the call isn’t toll-free from Mexico.
Currency
The currency in Mexico is the Mexican
peso. Paper currency comes in denomina-
tions of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000
pesos. Coins come in denominations of 1,
2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 centavos (100 centavos
equal 1 peso). The currency-exchange rate
is about 11 pesos to US$1.
Customs
All travelers to Mexico are required to
present proof of citizenship, such as an
original birth certificate with a raised seal,
a valid passport, or naturalization papers,
and need to have a Mexican tourist card
(FMT), which is free of charge and can be
attained through travel agencies and air-
lines and at all border-crossing points
going into Mexico. For more information,
see Chapter 9.
Doctors and Dentists
Every embassy and consulate can recom-
mend local doctors and dentists with good
training and modern equipment; some of the
doctors and dentists also speak English.
See the list of embassies and consulates
under the “Embassies & Consulates,” sec-
tion later in this appendix. Hotels with a
large foreign clientele can often recom-
mend English-speaking doctors as well.
Most first-class hotels in Mexico’s resort
areas have a doctor on call.
Drug Laws
To be blunt, don’t use or possess illegal
drugs in Mexico. Mexican officials have no
tolerance for drug users, and jail is their
solution. If you go to jail, you have little
hope of getting out until you complete the
sentence (usually a long one) or pay heavy
fines. Remember, in Mexico, the legal
system assumes that you’re guilty until
proven innocent. (Note: It isn’t uncommon
to be befriended by a fellow user, only to
be turned in by that “friend,” who’s col-
lected a bounty.) Bring prescription drugs
in their original containers. If possible,
pack a copy of the original prescription
with the generic name of the drug.
U.S. Customs officials are also on the look-
out for diet drugs that are sold in Mexico
but illegal in the United States. Possession
of these could land you in a U.S. jail. If you
buy antibiotics over the counter (which
you can do in Mexico) — say, for a sinus
infection — and still have some left, you
probably won’t be hassled by U.S. Customs.
Electricity
The electrical system in Mexico is 110
volts AC (60 cycles), as it is in the United
States and Canada. But in reality, it may
cycle more slowly and overheat your appli-
ances. To compensate, select a medium or
low speed for hair dryers. Many older
hotels still have electrical outlets for flat,
two-prong plugs; you’ll need an adapter for
any modern electrical apparatus that has
three prongs or an enlarged end on one of
the two prongs. Many first-class and
deluxe hotels have the three-holed outlets
(trifásicos in Spanish). Hotels that don’t
have modern outlets may have adapters to
loan, but to be sure, carry your own.
Embassies and Consulates
Embassies and consulates can provide
valuable lists of doctors and lawyers, as
well as regulations concerning marriages
Part XI: Appendixes 
470

in Mexico. Contrary to popular belief, your
embassy can’t get you out of a Mexican
jail, provide postal or banking services, or
fly you home when you run out of money.
However, consular officers can provide
you with advice on most matters and prob-
lems. Most countries have a representa-
tive embassy in Mexico City, and many
have consular offices or representatives in
the provinces.
The embassy of the United States is in
Mexico City (Paseo de la Reforma 305; 
% 555-080-2000; Fax: 555-525-5040). Its
hours are Monday to Friday 8:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. You can visit the embassy’s Web
site at www.usembassy-mexico.gov
for a list of street addresses for the U.S.
consulates inside Mexico. U.S. consular
agencies are located in Acapulco (% 744-
469-0556 or 484-0300), Cabo San Lucas 
(% 624-143-3566), Cancún (% 998-883-
0272), Cozumel (% 987-872-4574 or 987-
872-4485), Ixtapa (% 755-553-2100), and
Puerto Vallarta (% 322-222-0069).
The embassy of Australia is in Mexico City
at Rubén Darío 55, Polanco (% 551-101-
2200; Fax: 551-101-2201). It’s open Monday
to Friday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. (www.mexico.
embassy.gov.au).
The embassy of Canada is also in Mexico
City (Schiller 529, in Polanco; % 555-724-
7900). It’s open Monday through Friday 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. (At other
times, the name of a duty officer is posted
on the embassy door.) Visit the Web site at
www.canada.org.mx for a complete list
of the addresses of the consular agencies
in Mexico. Canadian consulates are
located in Acapulco (Centro Comercial
Marbella, Local 23, Prolongación Farallón
s/n; % 744-484-1305; acapulco@
canada.org.mx), Cancún (Plaza Caracol
11, Bulevar Kukulkán; % 998-883-3360;
cancun@canada.org.mx), Puerto
Vallarta (Edificio Obelisco, Local 108, 
Av. Francisco Medina Ascencio 1951; 
% 322-293-0098 or 293-0099; vallarta@
canada.org.mx), and San José del
Cabo (Plaza José Green, Local 9, Bulevar
Mijares s/n; % 624-142-4333; loscabos@

The embassy of New Zealand in Mexico
City is at Jaime Balmes 8, fourth floor, Col.
Los Morales Polanco (% 555-283-9460;
Fax: 555-283-9480; kiwimexico@
compuserve.com.mx).
The embassy of the United Kingdom is 
in Mexico City at Río Lerma 71, Col.
Cuauhtémoc (% 555-242-8500). The
embassy’s Web site, which you can visit at
www.embajadabritanica.com.mx,
has an updated list of honorary consuls in
Mexico. There are honorary British con-
suls in Acapulco (% 744-484-1735),
Cancún (% 998-881-0100), and Huatulco
(% 958-587-2373 or 587-2372 — leave a
message).
The embassy of Ireland is located in
Mexico City on Bulevar Cerrada Avila
Camacho 76, third floor Forum Building,
Col. Lomas de Chapultepec (% 555-520-
5803; Fax: 555-520-5892; embajada@
irlanda.org.mx).
The embassy of South Africa is also in
Mexico City at Andres Bello 10, ninth floor,
Col. Polanco (% 555-282-9260; www.sre.
gob.mx/acreditadas/sud.htm).
Emergencies
In case of emergency, always contact your
embassy or consulate. For police emer-
gencies, you must dial % 060 — this
number connects you to the local police
department. Remember that in most cases
the person answering the phone doesn’t
speak English. The 24-hour tourist help line
from Mexico City (INFOTUR) is % 800-987-
8224 or 555-089-7500. A tourist legal assis-
tance office (Procuraduría del Turista) is
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 471

located in Mexico City (% 555-625-8153)
or dial 078. Although the phones are fre-
quently busy, they do offer 24-hour service,
and an English-speaking person is always
available.
Health
No special immunizations are required. As
is often true when traveling anywhere in
the world, intestinal problems are the most
common afflictions experienced by travel-
ers. Drink only bottled water and stay
away from uncooked foods, especially
fruits and vegetables. Antibiotics and anti-
diarrheal medications are readily available
in all drugstores. Contact your embassy or
consulate for a list of accredited doctors in
the area.
Hot Lines
While in Mexico, contact the 24-hour
tourist help line, INFOTUR (% 800-987-
8224), for information regarding hotels,
restaurants, tourist attractions, hospitals
with English-speaking staff, and so on.
Information
The best source of information is the
tourist help line INFOTUR (% 800-987-
8224); however, having a general idea of
the information you’re requesting — the
approximate name of the hotel or restau-
rant, the name or subject matter of the
museum, and so on — is important. You
can also find telephone-number informa-
tion inside Mexico by dialing % 040; how-
ever, it’s very common to find that the
telephone numbers aren’t listed under 
the known name of the establishment. A
reminder: Very few information operators
speak English.
Internet Access
In large cities and resort areas, most five-
star hotels offer business centers with
Internet access. You also find cybercafes
in destinations that are popular with expa-
triates and business travelers. Even in
remote spots, Internet access is very
common — it’s often their best way of
communicating with the outside world.
Note that many Internet service providers
automatically cut off your Internet connec-
tion after a specified period of time (say, 
10 min.) because telephone lines are at a
premium. Some Telmex offices also have
free-access Internet kiosks in their recep-
tion areas. If you plan to check your e-mail
while in Mexico, register for a Web-based
e-mail address, such as those from
Hotmail or Yahoo!
Language
The official language in Mexico is Spanish,
but you find that a fair number of Mexicans
who live and work in resort areas speak
some English. Mexicans are very patient
when it comes to foreigners trying to
speak Spanish. See Appendix B for com-
monly used terms in Spanish.
Legal Aid
International Legal Defense Counsel (111
S. 15th St., 24th floor, Packard Building,
Philadelphia, PA 19102; % 215-977-9982) is
a law firm specializing in legal difficulties
of Americans abroad. Also, see the
“Embassies & Consulates” and
“Emergencies” sections, earlier in this
appendix.
Liquor Laws
The legal drinking age in Mexico is 18;
however, it’s extremely rare that anyone 
is asked for identification or denied pur-
chase. Grocery stores sell everything from
beer and wine to national and imported
liquors. You can buy liquor 24 hours a day,
but during major elections and a few offi-
cial holidays, dry laws often are enacted
as long as 24 hours beforehand. The laws
apply to foreign tourists as well as local
residents, even though it’s not uncommon
Part XI: Appendixes 
472

to find a few hotels and nightclubs that
manage to obtain special permits to sell
alcohol. Mexico doesn’t have any “open
container” laws for transporting alcohol 
in cars, but authorities are beginning to
target drunk drivers more aggressively.
Driving defensively is a good idea.
Drinking in the street isn’t legal, but many
tourists do it. Use your better judgment and
try to avoid carrying on while sporting beer
bottles and cans — you’re not only expos-
ing yourself to the eyes of the authorities,
but most Mexicans consider public intoxi-
cation to be tacky behavior. If you’re get-
ting too drunk, don’t drink in the street
because the police will most likely stop
you. As is the custom in Mexico, it’s not so
much what you do, but how you do it.
Mail
Postage for a postcard or letter is 1 peso,
and the item may arrive at its destination
anywhere between one to six weeks after
you send it. A registered letter costs 
$1.90. Sending a package can be quite
expensive — the Mexican postal service
charges $8 per kilo (2.2 lb.) — and is 
unreliable — it takes between two and 
six weeks, if it arrives at all. Packages are
frequently lost within the Mexican postal
system, although the situation has improved
in recent years. Federal Express, DHL, UPS,
or any other reputable, international-mail
service is the recommended option for a
package or important letter.
Newspapers and Magazines
Newspaper kiosks in larger Mexican cities
carry a selection of English-language mag-
azines. Most resort towns have their own
local publications in English, which provide
helpful hints and fun reading tailored to
tourists and foreigners who have made
their homes in the different resort destina-
tions around Mexico. In Puerto Vallarta,
the Vallarta Today and PV Tribune are two
of these newspapers — the former is a
daily publication, and the latter is pub-
lished weekly. In Los Cabos, you can find 
a wealth of information in the Los Cabos
Guide, Los Cabos News, Cabo Life, Baja
Sun, and the irreverent and extremely
entertaining Gringo Gazette.
Pets
Taking a pet into Mexico is easy but
requires a little pre-planning. For travelers
coming from the United States and
Canada, your pet’s health needs to be
checked within 30 days before arrival in
Mexico. Most veterinarians in major cities
have the appropriate paperwork — an offi-
cial health certificate, to be presented to
Mexican Customs officials, which ensures
the pet is up-to-date on its vaccinations.
When you and your pet return from
Mexico, U.S. Customs officials will require
the same type of paperwork. If your stay
extends beyond the 30-day time frame of
your U.S.-issued certificate, you need to
get an updated certificate of health issued
by a veterinarian in Mexico that also states
the condition of your pet and the status of
its vaccinations. To find out about any last-
minute changes in requirements, consult a
Mexican-government tourist office.
Pharmacies
Farmacias sell you just about anything you
want, with or without a prescription. Most
pharmacies are open Monday to Saturday
8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Generally, one or two 24-
hour pharmacies are located in the major
resort areas. Pharmacies take turns stay-
ing open during off-hours, so if you’re in a
smaller town and you need to buy medi-
cine after normal hours, ask for the farma-
cia de turno (pharmacy on duty).
Police
It’s quite common to find that the majority
of police forces in tourist areas are very
protective of international visitors. Several
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 473

cities, including Cancún, Puerto Vallarta,
and Acapulco, have gone so far as to set
up a special corps of English-speaking
tourist police to assist with directions,
guidance, and more. In case of a police
emergency, dial % 060 to contact the
local police department, keeping in mind
that, unless you’re dealing with tourist
police, the force is very unlikely to speak
English.
Restrooms
Public restrooms are usually more of an
adventure than a service — you can never
tell whether they’ll be clean or toilet paper
will be available. You can usually resort to
using the restroom in a restaurant.
Safety
Most resort areas in Mexico are very safe;
however, it’s better to be prepared than
sorry. A few points to keep in mind: Before
you leave home, prepare for the theft or
loss of your travel documents by making
two photocopies of them. Keep each copy
and the original documents in separate
places. Lock your passport and valuables
in the hotel safety-deposit box. Keep
credit-card company phone numbers and
the numbers of traveler’s checks some-
where other than your purse or wallet.
Don’t dress or behave in a conspicuous
manner. When visiting crowded places, be
aware of your wallet or purse at all times.
Leave your best jewelry at home — who
wants jewelry tan lines anyway?
Taxes
Most of Mexico has a 15 percent value-
added tax (IVA) on goods and services,
and it’s supposed to be included in the
posted price. This tax is 10 percent in
Cancún, Cozumel, and Los Cabos. Mexico
charges all visitors an entry tax of $24,
which is usually included in the price of
your plane ticket. Mexico also imposes an
exit tax of around $24 on every foreigner
leaving the country, which again, is usually
included in the price of airline tickets.
Telephone and Fax
In November 2001, telephone area codes
were changed. Now, all telephone num-
bers in Mexico are seven digits plus a
three-digit area code, except for Mexico
City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey where
local calls require that you dial the last
eight digits of the published phone number.
Many fax numbers are also regular tele-
phone numbers — you have to ask who-
ever answers your call for the fax tone
(“Me da tono de fax, por favor.”). Wireless
phones are very popular for small busi-
nesses in resort areas and smaller com-
munities. To dial a wireless number inside
the same area code, dial 044 and then the
number — depending on the area, you
may need to dial the last seven digits or
the seven digits plus the three-digit area
code. To dial the cellular phone from any-
where else in Mexico, first dial 01, and
then the ten-digit number, including the
area code. To dial any number inside
Mexico from the United States, just dial
011-52 plus the ten-digit number.
The country code for Mexico is 52. To call
home from Mexico, dial 00 plus the country
code you’re calling and then the area code
and phone number. To call the United
States and Canada, you need to dial 001
plus the area code and the number. The
country code for the United Kingdom is 44,
the country code for New Zealand is 64,
and the country code for Australia is 61.
To call operator assistance for calls inside
Mexico, dial 020; for operator assistance
for international calls, dial 090. Both num-
bers provide assistance for person-to-
person and collect calls.

Time Zone
Central standard time prevails throughout
most of Mexico. The west-coast states of
Sonora, Sinaloa, and parts of Nayarit are
on mountain standard time. The state of
Baja California Norte is on pacific time, but
Baja California Sur is on mountain time.
Most of Mexico observes daylight saving
time, but the time change lasts for a shorter
period of time than it does in the rest of the
world. Mexico doesn’t spring forward until
June, and the country falls back in early
October. This time-change pattern has cre-
ated a lot of political arguments, and the
guidelines may change again.
Tipping
Most service employees in Mexico count
on tips for the majority of their income —
especially true for bellboys and waiters.
Bellboys should receive the equivalent 
of 50¢ to $1 per bag; waiters generally
receive 10 percent to 20 percent, depend-
ing on the level of service. In Mexico, tip-
ping taxi drivers isn’t customary, unless
you hire them by the hour, or they provide
guide or other special services. Don’t use
U.S. coins to tip.
Water
Most hotels have decanters or bottles of
purified water in the rooms, and the better
hotels have purified water from regular
taps or special taps marked AGUA PURIFI-
CADA. Some hotels charge for in-room bot-
tled water. Virtually any hotel, restaurant,
or bar brings you purified water if you
specifically request it, but they usually
charge you for it. Bottled, purified water is
sold widely at drugstores and grocery
stores. Some popular brands are Santa
María, Ciel, and Bonafont. Evian and other
imported brands are also widely available.

tourism office; presidencia@ixtapa-zihuatanejo.com).
Following is a list of several Web sites where you can find updated 
information about Mexico and traveling to the most popular beach
resorts; however, keep in mind that most of the companies that these
Web sites recommend received this lofty status by paying some sort of
advertising fee:
 The Mexico Ministry of Tourism’s official Web site (www.mexico-
travel.com) offers ample information (15,000 pages worth) about
Mexico. However, the pages are slow to load and the information is
a little outdated.
 The Mexico Tourism Board developed another official site (www.
visitmexico.com) with more current information on the different
destinations in Mexico. Again, the pages are slow to load, but the
navigation is a lot easier. The site features sections for travelers
divided by region; a good search engine usually takes you to the
information you’re looking for.
 For low-impact travel planning, visit the Eco Travels in Mexico sec-
tion of the award-winning Web site Planeta.com (www.planeta.
com/mexico.html). You can find up-to-date information on reliable
ecotour operators in Mexico. This site also offers an excellent source
to find banks and telephone services. Planeta.com is one of the best
sources for current information because it’s updatedmonthly.
 The electronic version of Mexico Connect magazine (www.mex
connect.com) offers a wealth of information and is the ideal site to
begin a more in-depth, online exploration about when and where to

Appendix A: Quick Concierge 481
visit Mexico. The site offers a great index where you can find every-
thing from out-of-the-way adventures to Mexico’s history to recom-
mended accommodations.
 Cancun South (www.cancunsouth.com) is a great site for independ-
ent travelers looking to explore the Riviera Maya. The site is easy 
to navigate and offers a wealth of information specific to the area.
 Cozumel.net (www.cozumel.net) provides detailed information
about the island’s life. In our opinion, this site has the most reliable
information about Cozumel and it even lists ferry schedules in the
“About Cozumel” section.
 Two good sites feature information on Los Cabos: Baja Travel Guide
(www.bajatravel.com) and All About Cabo (www.allaboutcabo.
com). We prefer the factual and less flashy presentation of the Baja
Travel Guide site; however, if you want to find out a bit more about
activities such as golf and fishing and get an up-to-date beach fore-
cast, All About Cabo is the site to visit.
Following is a selection of Web sites that can help you with all the impor-
tant stuff related to your Mexican beach resort vacation, such as figuring
out where to get cash, how to ask for a cold beer, where to go to send an
e-mail to your friends back home, how to find really great deals, and so on:
 Cybercafes (www.cybercafes.com): Search this interactive data-
base to find Internet and cybercafes worldwide, though given the
fluctuating state of these businesses, locations change frequently.
For Mexican cybercafes, you have to search by state, rather than
city or resort.
 Foreign Languages for Travelers (www.travlang.com): Find out
what basic terms mean in more than 70 languages and click on any
underlined phrase to hear what it sounds like. Note: Free audio
software and speakers are required.
 Intellicast (www.intellicast.com): Get weather forecasts for all
50 United States and cities around the world. Note: Temperatures
are in Celsius for many international destinations.
 Mapquest (www.mapquest.com): Choose a specific address or 
destination, and in seconds, get a map and detailed directions.
 Travel Secrets (www.travelsecrets.com): This site is one of the
best compilations around. The site offers advice and tips on how to
find the lowest prices for airlines, hotels, and cruises, and it also 
provides a listing of links for airfare deals, airlines, booking engines,
discount travel, resources, hotels, and travel magazines.
 Universal Currency Converter (www.xe.net/ucc): See what your
dollar or pound is worth in more than 100 other countries.
 Visa ATM Locator (www.visa.com/pd/atm) or MasterCard ATM
Locator (www.mastercard.com/atmlocator): Find ATMs in hun-
dreds of cities in the United States and around the world.

Appendix C
Authentic Mexican Cuisine
A
uthentic Mexican food differs quite dramatically from what is fre-
quently served up in the United States under that name. For many
travelers, Mexico is new and exciting culinary territory. Even grizzled
veterans are pleasantly surprised by the wide variation in specialties
and traditions offered from region to region.
Despite regional differences, you can make some generalizations. In fact,
Mexican food usually isn’t pepper-hot when it arrives at the table (though
many dishes must have a certain amount of spiciness, and some home
cooking can be very spicy, depending on a family’s or chef’s tastes). The
piquant flavor is added with chiles and sauces after the food is served;
you never see a table in Mexico without one or both of these condiments.
Mexicans don’t drown their cooking in cheese and sour cream (which is
the case in many Tex-Mex restaurants), and they use a great variety of
ingredients. But the basis of Mexican food is simple — tortillas, beans,
chiles, squash, and tomatoes — the same as it was centuries ago, before
the Europeans arrived.
Knowing the Basic Dishes
Traditional tortillas are made from corn that has been cooked in water
and lime, and then ground into masa (a grainy dough), patted and
pressed into thin cakes, and cooked on a hot griddle known as a comal.
In many households, tortillas take the place of fork and spoon; Mexicans
merely tear the tortillas into wedge-shaped pieces, which they use to
scoop up their food. Restaurants often serve bread rather than tortillas
because it’s easier to prepare, but you can always ask for tortillas. A
more recent invention from northern Mexico is the flour tortilla, which
you don’t see as frequently in the rest of Mexico. If asked, choose corn
over flour tortillas for a more authentic Mexico dining experience.
Dishes made with tortillas
The tortilla is the basis of several Mexican dishes, and the most famous
dish is the enchilada. The original name for this dish was tortilla enchi-
lada, which simply means a tortilla dipped in a chile sauce. In a similar
manner, there’s the entomatada (tortilla dipped in a tomato sauce) and
the enfrijolada (tortilla dipped in a bean sauce). The enchilada begins as
a very simple dish: A tortilla is dipped in chile sauce (usually with ancho

Appendix C: Authentic Mexican Cuisine 489
chile) and then into very hot oil, and then is quickly folded or rolled on a
plate and sprinkled with chopped onions and a little queso cotija (crum-
bly white cheese) and served with a few fried potatoes and carrots. You
can get this basic enchilada in food stands across the country. If you
come across them in your travels, give them a try. In restaurants, you get
the more elaborate enchilada, with different fillings of cheese, chicken,
pork, or even seafood, and sometimes in a casserole.
A taco is anything folded or rolled into a tortilla, and sometimes a double
tortilla. The tortilla can be served either soft or fried. Flautas and quesadil-
las are offshoots of tacos. For Mexicans, the taco is the quintessential fast
food, and the taco stand (taquería) — a ubiquitous sight — is a great place
to get a filling meal. See the section, “Eating Out: Restaurants, Taquerías,
and Tipping,” later in this appendix for information on taquerías.
All about beans
An invisible “bean line” divides Mexico: It starts at the Gulf Coast in the
southern part of the state of Tamaulipas and moves inland through the
eastern quarter of San Luis Potosí and most of the state of Hidalgo, and
then goes straight through Mexico City and Morelos and into Guerrero,
where it curves slightly westward to the Pacific. (Check out the map of
Mexico on the inside back cover of this book to gain a little perspective
about this bean line.) To the north and west of this line, the pink bean
known as the flor de mayo is the staple food; to the south and east, the
standard is the black bean.
In private households, beans are served at least once a day and, 
among the working class and peasantry, with every meal, if the family
can afford it. Mexicans almost always prepare beans with a minimum of
condiments — usually just a little onion and garlic and perhaps a pinch
of herbs. Beans are a contrast to the heavily spiced dishes. Sometimes
they’re served at the end of a meal with a little Mexican-style sour
cream, which is basically just cream.
Mexicans often fry leftover beans and serve them on the side as frijoles
refritos. Refritos is usually translated as refried, but this translation is a
misnomer — the beans are fried only once. The prefix re actually means
well (as in thoroughly), and what Mexicans actually mean is the beans
are well fried.
Getting to know tamales
You make a tamal by mixing corn masa with a little lard, adding one of sev-
eral fillings — such as meats flavored with chiles (or no filling at all) —
and then wrapping it in a corn husk or in the leaf of a banana or other
plant, and finally steaming it. Every region in Mexico has its own tradi-
tional way of making tamales. In some places, a single tamal can be big
enough to feed a family, although in other places, they’re barely 3 inches
long and an inch thick.

Part XI: Appendixes 
490
Understanding the chile pepper
Many kinds of chile peppers exist, and Mexicans call each of them by
one name when they’re fresh and another when they’re dried. Some are
blazing hot with only a mild flavor; some are mild but have a rich, com-
plex flavor. They can be pickled, smoked, stuffed, stewed, chopped, and
used in an endless variety of dishes.
Eating Out: Restaurants, 
Taquerías, and Tipping
First of all, we feel compelled to debunk the prevailing myth that the
cheapest place to eat in Mexico is in the market. Actually, this is almost
never the case. You can usually find better food at a better price without
going more than 2 blocks out of your way. Why? Food stalls in the mar-
ketplace pay high rents, they have a near-captive clientele of market ven-
dors and truckers, and they get plenty of business from many Mexicans
for whom eating in the market is a traditional way of confirming their
culture.
On the other side of the spectrum, avoid eating at those inviting side-
walk restaurants that you see beneath the stone archways that border
the main plazas. These places usually cater to tourists — so authenticity
may be suspect — and they don’t need to count on getting any return
business. But they’re great for getting a coffee or beer.
During your trip, you’re going to see many taquerías (taco stands).
These are generally small places with a counter or a few tables set
around the cooking area; you get to see exactly how they make their
tacos before deciding whether to order. Most tacos come with a little
chopped onion and cilantro, but not tomato and lettuce. Find one that
seems popular with the locals and where the cook performs with brio (a
good sign of pride in the product). Sometimes you see a woman making
the tortillas right there (or working the masa into gorditas, sopes, or
panuchos if the taquería serves them). You’ll never see men making 
tortillas — this is perhaps the strictest gender division in Mexican 
society. Men do all other cooking and kitchen tasks, and work with
already-made tortillas, but they never work with masa.
For the main meal of the day, many restaurants offer a multicourse blue-
plate special called comida corrida or menú del día. This dish is the
most inexpensive way to get a full dinner. In Mexico, you need to ask for
your check; Mexican culture generally considers presenting a check to
someone who hasn’t requested it as inhospitable. If you’re in a hurry to
get somewhere, ask for the check when your food arrives.
Tips are about the same as in the United States. You sometimes find a 
15 percent value-added tax on restaurant meals, which shows up on the
bill as “IVA.” If you’re an arithmetically challenged tipper, you may be
Part XI: Appendixes 

Appendix C: Authentic Mexican Cuisine 491
(slightly) thankful for this tax, saving you from the undue exertion of
trying to calculate a 15 percent tip in your head.
To summon the waiter, wave or raise your hand, but don’t motion with
your index finger, which is a demeaning gesture that may even cause the
waiter to ignore you. Or if you want your check, you can motion to the
waiter from across the room using the universal pretend-like-you’re-
writing gesture.
Most restaurants don’t have nonsmoking sections; when they do, we
mention it in the restaurant reviews throughout this book. But Mexico’s
wonderful climate allows for many open-air restaurants, usually set
inside a colonial house’s courtyard, or in rooms with tall ceilings and
plenty of open windows.
Drinking in Mexico
All over Mexico you find shops selling jugos (juices) and licuados
(smoothies) made from several kinds of tropical fruit. They’re excellent
and refreshing; while in Mexico, take full advantage of them. You also
come across aguas frescas — water flavored with hibiscus, melon,
tamarind, or lime. Soft drinks come in more flavors than in any other
country we know. Pepsi and Coca-Cola taste the way they did in the
United States years ago, before the makers started adding corn syrup.
The coffee is generally good, and hot chocolate is a traditional drink, as
is atole, a hot, corn-based beverage that can be sweet or bitter.
Of course, Mexico has a proud and lucrative beer-brewing tradition. A
lesser-known brewed beverage is pulque, a pre-Hispanic drink: the fer-
mented juice of a few species of maguey or agave. Mostly you find it for
sale in pulquerías in central Mexico. It’s an acquired taste, and not every
gringo acquires it. Mezcal and tequila also come from the agave. Tequila
is a variety of mezcal produced from the A. tequilana species of agave in
and around the area of Tequila, in the state of Jalisco. Mezcal comes
from various parts of Mexico and from different varieties of agave. The
distilling process is usually much less sophisticated than that of tequila,
and, with its stronger smell and taste, mezcal is much more easily
detected on the drinker’s breath. In some places such as Oaxaca, it
comes with a worm in the bottle; you’re supposed to eat the worm after
polishing off the mezcal. But for those teetotalers who are interested in
just the worm, we have good news — you can find these worms for sale
in Mexican markets when in season.
