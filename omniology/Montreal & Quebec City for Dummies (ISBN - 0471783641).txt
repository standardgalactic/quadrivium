Montréal & Québec City For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
E
uropean flair and French joie de vivre — you’ll definitely find these
elusive old-world qualities in Montréal and Québec City.
Visiting Montréal is like escaping into a little corner of Europe, except
that you don’t have to cross the Atlantic to get here. And Montréal 
doesn’t feel European only because life and business is carried out
mostly in French. Things are really different here. People eat later (and,
may I add, better), they party differently (ditto), and life is infused with 
a touch of European style. Montréalers seem to keep one eye on Paris 
all the time.
Visiting Québec City is like slipping into the past without actually leaving
the present. One of the oldest, most picturesque cities in North America,
Québec City has preserved all its historic charm while hanging on to its
vibrant and distinct culture.
To give you a better idea, the whole province (state) of Québec con-
sumes half the wine sold in all of Canada. Yet Québec is only about 20
percent of the country’s total population. Although the rest of Canada’s
colonial roots are English, Protestant, and Anglo-Saxon, in Québec, the
French arrived first, making its roots Catholic and Latin. So, life’s bound
to be a little different in many ways in this, still-predominantly-French-
speaking corner of the world.
Yet make no mistake. Both cities have their feet firmly planted in North
America. Distinct as they are, Montréal and Québec City feel familiar,
too: The road system looks similar, telephones work the same way, and
people here smile at strangers. You’ll feel a je ne sais quoi about both
cities, but people here won’t seem as foreign as the people you meet
when traveling to another part of the world.
About This Book
By no means is Montréal & Québec City For Dummies, 2nd Edition, an
encyclopedia about the two cities. Although I’ve scoured both cities,
this book highlights the best — not the most — of each. It’s the insider
information and street knowledge you need to know to make savvy deci-
sions during your trip. I assume you have only so much time and need to
cut to the chase. With that in mind, I’ve organized the chapters in this
book to answer your questions roughly in the order they pop up — from
figuring out whether you really want to visit these cities to knowing when
to go, planning a budget, deciding where to stay and eat, and figuring out
what to see and do.

Of course, you may not have the same questions in the same order, so
feel free to jump ahead and read the chapters in any order you want.
Who am I to judge? In these pages, you find a fair bit more information
about Montréal than Québec City, but that’s not because I’m choosing
favorites. Montréal is a much bigger city, with much more to see and do
(and many more places to eat!). To give you the best of Montréal, I have
to give you more. However, if you decide to skip Montréal, don’t worry,
because I cover all the bases in Québec City, too.
Remember: Travel information is a dicey game — things change — 
particularly prices. So, take heed; be sure to call ahead for confirmation,
especially of essential matters like your travel and lodging reservations.
Once on-site, you have a little more leeway to improvise. Please keep in
mind: the authors, editors, and publisher can’t be held responsible for
the experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,
however, so I encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surround-
ings. Generally, keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets — all
favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets in cities worldwide.
Conventions Used in This Book
Montréal & Québec City For Dummies, 2nd Edition, uses a few conven-
tions to help you find information quickly.
All prices in this book are shown first in Canadian dollars, then in U.S.
dollars. The dollar signs are preceded by C or US so that you know
which is which. (At the time of this writing, C$1 is worth US85¢, and all
prices are converted at that rate. That may change by the time you read
this and when you travel to these cities.)
In the hotel sections, the prices I give are the rack rates (the official rates
the hotel publicizes) for one night for a double room, during the high
season of tourism: May to October. The price you end up paying may be
significantly lower if you travel off season or with a package deal.
In the restaurant sections, I give you the price range of a main course at
each establishment. In most cases, these are the prices of dinner entrees,
but if a restaurant doesn’t serve dinner, I give you the price of a lunch
entree.
I also use dollar-sign symbols ($) in both the hotel and restaurant sec-
tions. These signs give you the price range of a night’s stay at a hotel
(non-discounted, standard rates) or a restaurant meal (including drinks
and tips). Check out the following table to decipher the dollar signs:

C$300 (US$255) or above
C$60 (US$51) or above
I also use abbreviations for credit cards, so that you can quickly see how
you can pay for hotels and restaurants. They are as follows:
AE: American Express
DC: Diner’s Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
In addition, I keep the addresses of hotels, restaurants, and attractions
in French, because that’s what you’ll see on street signs — I hope this
simplifies finding your way around. Here’s the rundown of French street
terminology:
French Term
U.S. Equivalent
Rue
Street
Bd.
Boulevard
Av.
Avenue
Est
East
Ouest
West
Nord
North
Sud
South
You may sometimes see the odd street name starting with place. Some
street names also start with côte, which means hill, so at least you know
what to expect before you get there. (Don’t worry, though, most hills are
just gentle slopes.) Also, many streets are named for saints, whose given
names are preceded by Ste (for female saints) or St (for male saints).
Vieux means “old,” as in Vieux-Montréal and Vieux-Québec, the older 
sections of the cities, which are loaded with history and character.
I also keep names of buildings and sites in French, except where they are
very frequently referred to in English.
Introduction 3

Otherwise, I translate French words and expressions into English as
much as possible. However, some terms just don’t translate very well,
and when that happens, I leave the words in French and put them in 
italics. For a list of handy French expressions, see the Cheat Sheet at the
front of this book.
For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
a page reference is provided in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
I make a few assumptions about you, dear reader. You probably fall into
one or more of these categories:
 You’re a first time visitor to Montréal or Québec City. Or you
stopped here briefly, say, on business, got a taste of it, and want to
go back for more. I don’t want to give you a comprehensive course
on these cities. I simply show you how to enjoy them best with the
least amount of planning and painstaking research possible.
 You’re busy. Perhaps you’re an experienced traveler, but you don’t
have a ton of time to spend planning a trip, or you don’t have loads
of time to spend in Montréal and Québec City after you get there.
You want expert advice on how to maximize your time and enjoy a
hassle-free trip.
 You don’t want to spend your whole trip reading a guidebook.
This book is a quick and easy read, focusing on the very best that
Montréal and Québec City have to offer. It’s also a reliable reference
for a quick recommendation while on-the-fly, booting around town.
How This Book Is Organized
Montréal & Québec City For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is both a planning
guide to help you prepare for your trip and a travel guide that gives you
all the information you need to have an interesting and fun stay that
doesn’t break the bank. As such, this book is organized into five parts.
Part I: Introducing Montréal and Québec City
Right out of the gate I introduce you to the very best of Montréal and
Québec City. I describe the main attractions for each city, tell you what the
weather is like, and give you ideas of what’s going on throughout the year.
Montréal & Québec City For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Part II: Planning Your Trip to 
Montréal and Québec City
I tell you how much everything costs, give you tips on how to plan a
budget, and help you decide whether to use cash, credit, traveler’s
checks, or ATMs. From the advice in this chapter, you’ll be able to
decide on the best way to travel to Montréal and Québec City. Finally, 
I give specialized advice for gay and lesbian travelers, people traveling
with kids, travelers with disabilities, and senior citizens.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal
I start this part by explaining what to do when you arrive in Montréal
and where to get the information you need to visit the city. Here is where
you’ll begin to familiarize yourself with the different Montréal neighbor-
hoods. The chapters in this part also list the best hotels, restaurants,
attractions, and shopping in the city. I then cover the best nightspots in
Montréal and also describe the best daytrips, in case you want to get
out of the city for an afternoon.
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City
Here, I describe the Québec City neighborhoods you want to spend time
exploring. I also give you a list of my top hotel picks, recommend what
to see and do, and direct you to the best food in town — whether you
want fine French cuisine or just pizza. Finally, I suggest some sample 
itineraries that let you explore different themes in the city.
Part V: The Part of Tens
One thing to never forget when you travel is your sense of humor. In this
part, I tell you how to have fun in Montréal and Québec City. Some of my
advice is practical. Some of it is whimsical — just an indirect way of
poking fun at the cities and their inhabitants. You be the judge.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you find information as quickly and easily as possible, every For
Dummies book includes a series of icons that serve as little road signs,
alerting you to pleasures and dangers ahead — or just alerting you,
period. In this book, I add an icon of my own to tell you what’s really,
truly, unique about this French-speaking corner of the continent.
Traveling in Canada used to be a real steal for Americans, thanks to the
weak Canadian dollar. Those days are over — at least in the short term —
so you have work a little harder to cut corners off your travel budget. 
I use this icon to make that job easier for you.
Introduction 5

Best of the Best highlights the best Montréal and Québec City have to
offer in all categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shop-
ping, and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Think traveling with kids is hard work? Okay, you’re right. Nevertheless,
I try to make the process easier by using this icon when a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction happens to be particularly well-suited for your pint-
size companions.
Some of the sites, foods, and activities in Montréal and Québec City wrap
up what’s unique about Québec. I don’t want you to miss out on these or
accidentally overlook them, so I flag them with this icon. Vive le Québec!
This icon alerts you to special, insider advice on everything from dealing
with Québec’s extreme weather to exchanging money and finding the best
rate on accommodations.
Where to Go from Here
Time to dig in and do some reading. You won’t find any fixed rule about
which chapters to read first. I’ve organized them in what I thought was a
logical sequence, but you’re free to wander in and out of them to your
heart’s content, in whatever order suits you. You may actually want to
read about attractions and restaurants before you dig into the nitty-gritty
about planning a trip and buying air tickets — just to see what fun stuff
is in store for you.
Don’t worry, though. Regardless of the order in which you plan this trip,
you’ll be amply rewarded when you arrive. So start reading!

M
ontréal is fun, sexy, and sophisticated. It’s a city with charisma, a
place with flair. Even the people who live here think so. Is it the
mix of French and North American cultures that is so appealing? Is it
Montréal’s tumultuous past as a battleground between English and
French? Or is it just the great food and pulsing night and the generally
hedonistic ways of modern Montréalers? Actually, it’s the combination
of these and other qualities that give the city its unique beat.
Montréal has seen some dark days. A little over a decade ago, the econ-
omy was in a slump, political tensions were at their peak, and morale hit
rock bottom. It wasn’t pretty. But the city made an amazing about-face —
which means now is a great time to visit Montréal. The economy has
seen a remarkable upturn in the last five years, so the city boasts more
great restaurants, clubs, and attractions than ever. The city’s festivals
are getting bigger and more glamorous every year, attracting an amazing
array of talent. Tensions between English and French feel like ancient
history now. And, best of all, this cultural and economic germination is
really putting Montréalers in a good mood.
Québec City, with its quaint cobblestone streets, top-notch restaurants,
beautiful vistas, and old-world charm, never goes out of style. In 2003,
Travel + Leisure magazine ranked Québec City as one of the top five des-
tinations in North America. In 2005, it took the seventh spot. And the
city is in no danger of losing the title of North America’s most romantic
holiday destination. Just being in this fortified, cliff-top, port city is
enough — although you can find plenty more to do than just soak up the
view. For a small city, it offers an impressive roster of cultural events,

exhibitions, performances, festivals, and more. The booming economy
through Québec province hasn’t done its capital city any harm, either.
In the following pages I introduce you to the choicest parts of both.
Montreal’s Best Neighborhoods 
Vieux-Montréal is a “must-see” for its yesteryear architecture and cobble-
stone streets. During the day, this bustling neighborhood is home to many
businesses, boutiques, restaurants, and cafes. Rue St-Paul is the main
shopping street. The establishments on Place Jacques Cartier have ter-
races that spill out onto the square where there’s always a busker shilling
for the large crowds. The Old-Port, a boardwalk and green space along
the riverfront, has many attractions and hosts special events throughout
the year. By dark, Vieux-Montréal empties out somewhat, which makes it
very romantic for strolling couples, whose steps echo down the streets.
Increasingly, though, bars and lounges are setting up there, and it is in the
early stages of becoming an exciting nightlife destination.
The Plateau is Montréal’s trendiest neighborhood and the epicenter of
its pulse. Strut up boulevard St-Laurent, across avenue Mont-Royal,
and down avenue St-Denis and you will have covered the Plateau’s main
commercial drags and seen some of what it’s all about. You’ll have diffi-
culty passing yourself off as a local, at first, but you, too, will immedi-
ately wish you were a Plateauzard, the name for the indigenous hipsters
from this ’hood.
Little Italy is northeast of downtown, just beyond the Plateau neighbor-
hood. The main attraction here is Marché Jean Talon. It’s worth getting
up early to catch all the morning hubbub of merchants setting up their
stalls and haggling with shoppers over fresh produce and other local
ingredients. (Note: See Chapter 10 for a brief discussion on the impor-
tance of terroir, locally grown specialty ingredients, on Montréal’s restau-
rant scene.) The Marché Atwater is at the opposite end of the city but is
not as action-packed.
Québec City’s Best Neighborhoods
Québec City is much smaller than Montréal. In fact, at first glance, the
whole seems happily contained in the Haute-Ville and Basse-Ville, the
upper and lower parts of the Vieux-Québec.
Step beyond the fortified walls to experience a more everyday version of
Québec City, the province’s capital. Exit the gate on rue St-Jean. Beyond,
this street becomes a long commercial strip with many independent bou-
tiques, cafes, and bars — fewer tourists and more locals going about
their daily errands. Also outside the walls, rue St-Louis becomes La
Grande Allée, which is Québec City’s nightlife hub.
Part I: Introducing Montréal and Québec City 
10

Several blocks farther in the same direction lies a cross-street, avenue
Cartier, which is another charming district and somewhat hidden from
the tourists buzzing between sights. In the Basse-Ville, if you go past
Place Royale, you’ll come to a narrow sliver of land between the cliff and
the river, the 3 or 4 blocks in here are fun to troll. Rue St-Paul is Québec
City’s “Antique Alley.” Hidden away in the up-and-coming district of St.
Roch, don’t miss the shopping on rue St-Joseph. Once an undesirable
part of town, this strip is now lined with destination boutiques, bustling
bistros, and happening pubs.
The Best Hotels
The most exciting development in Québec’s hotel industry is the ever-mul-
tiplying number of boutique hotels. In Montréal, the W Hotel and the Hôtel
Godin are the latest additions to an already crowded roster. Some of the
first boutique hotels that started the trend here are Hôtel Le Germain,
Hôtel Nelligan, Hôtel Gault, and Hôtel St. Paul. Many located in Vieux-
Montréal took over 18th-century buildings that had fallen into disuse.
The Dominion 1912 and the Royal William are the boutique hotels in
Québec City. Even if you don’t stay in one this time, it’s definitely worth
sticking your head in and taking a look around.
The Best Restaurants
Eating well will be a major theme for your trip to Québec. In the French
tradition, food, drink, and merrymaking are major concerns of the
people here.
Au Pied de Cochon, which opened in 2002, remains one of the most
exciting destinations on Montréal’s culinary landscape. Toqué!, Beaver
Club, and Moishe’s are top-dollar places serving the very best. However,
Montréal’s restaurant scene is so varied that there’s plenty of feasting
for any budget. Bistros L’Express and Le Continental are longtime
favorites among foodies.
Montréal’s restaurant scene reflects the many ethnic communities that
make up its population. There are tons of restaurant specializing in differ-
ent cuisines from around the globe. Some of the most popular are also
great values, like Taquéria Mexicaine, Rôtisserie Italienne, and Pushap
Sweets (Indian). Schwartz’s, a Hebrew deli, is a must for the city’s best
“smoked meat” (Montréal’s way better version of corned beef or pastrami).
Also, don’t miss stopping in at Cobalt, Le Cartet, or Le Reservoir for
snazzy brunches on weekends.
Québec city is heavy on French food with lots of small bistros doing escar-
got, steak frites, crème brûlée, and other brasserie-type staples. Café du
Monde and L’Ardoise are two notables among them. Québec City’s finest
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Montréal and Québec City 11

tables include Le Paris-Brest, Le Saint-Amour, and Initiale. A great spot
for a casual meal is Chez Victor, which has the best burgers in town.
The Best Attractions
The Musée d’Archeologie et d’Historie de Montréal and the Canadian
Centre for Architecture are two of the city’s best museums. By regular
museum standards, both are quite unusual and reveal lots about Montréal.
Of course, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Montréal is the spot for culture
vultures to get their fine-arts fix. Many visitors can’t resist the tempta-
tion of winning big money at the Casino de Montréal, so they go there
instead. Winter or summer, Parc Mont-Royal attracts the fitness- or
leisure-conscious. Visitors to Montréal should hike up to the lookout
atop the “Mountain,” just because it’s there. It’s not that high or that
steep. The penguins at the Biodome are always a favorite with the kids.
In Québec City, locals call the Château Frontenac, atop the cliff overlook-
ing the St. Lawrence River, “Québec’s Eiffel Tower,” and indeed, it is —
everyone goes to see it. Behind this famous hotel is La Citadel, a fortress
that defended this hotly contested port city over the course of its history.
Weather permitting, you can witness the Changing of the Guard, a proces-
sion of expressionless redcoat soldiers in tall fur hats — oddly enough, just
like the ones in England. Behind it lie the Parc des Champs-de-Bataille and
the Plains of Abraham where the decisive battle between the French and
English took place. In the Basse-Ville at the bottom of the cliff is the Musée
de la Civilisation, featuring engaging exhibits on the first settlers and the
Native American people who were already here. Beyond the Plains of
Abraham is the Musée du Québec, which, along with its permanent collec-
tion, hosts temporary exhibits of a surprisingly high caliber.
The Best Nightlife
Montréal’s just hitting its stride when the sun goes down. Kick off your
evening at a brewpub like Le Reservoir or a martini lounge, like Jello
Bar, for after-work drinks — called the cinq a sept in local lingo. Step it
up another notch or two after dinner by hitting places like Mile End or
Newtown. After midnight, if you’re looking to dance, Club 1234 qualifies
as Montréal’s most crowded dance floor of the moment. The Society of
Art and Technology and Casa del Popolo provide other good options
for a more alternative crowd.
Nights in Québec City aren’t necessarily more sedate, just smaller in
scale. Pubs and other intimate settings with lots of live music are what
dominate the scene. The two exceptions are the mega-clubs on the
Grand Allée, Chez Dagobert and Chez Maurice. Many spend their night
hopping between the two. Les Salons Edgar, Bistro Scanner
Multimedia, and Bal du Lezard are three good alternatives in the St.
Roch neighborhood just beyond the Basse-Ville.

I
n this chapter, I provide some background information. The aim of
these easily digestible bites is to steady your footing, open your eyes,
and prime your senses to discover the different possibilities that
Montréal and Québec City offer.
History 101: The Main Events
The cities of Montréal and Québec City boast fascinating histories. The
following are some highlights from the annals of two of the oldest cities
in North America.
The French discovered Québec . . .
Looking for a quick passage to Asia, French explorer Jacques Cartier landed
at the future site of Québec City in 1535. For some reason, he thought the
ground was rich with diamonds. It wasn’t, so he went back to France.
In 1608, another French explorer, Samuel de Champlain, founded a fur
trading post in Québec, which attracted French settlers. The British cap-
tured the colony from France in 1759 and began to settle it with Irish,
Scottish, and English immigrants and American Loyalists.
In the 19th century, when railroads began cutting into Québec’s port
business and economic prospects looked grim, the English-speaking

population moved to Montréal, leaving Québec City almost entirely to
French speakers.
. . . and then Montréal
Jacques Cartier also discovered Montréal in 1535, but again, he left with-
out making much of an impression. In 1641, the French explorer Paul de
Chomedey Maisonneuve founded a mission on the site and set out to
convert natives to Christianity. Then, of course, the French ceded
Montréal to the English in 1760.
By the early 1800s, Montréal was the cultural and commercial capital of
Canada, with a booming port business and a wealthy English population
running the show, while the Catholic French-speaking majority did the
grunt work for them.
. . . and then Québeckers took over
In the 1960s, Québec’s French-speaking majority decided to become their
own bosses and shake off the influence of the Catholic Church in one shot.
The period is known as the Quiet Revolution. Practically overnight, French-
speaking Québeckers went from being mostly farmers and working poor
dominated by the Catholic Church to being a modern, secular society.
Parlez-Vous?
The question on most people’s minds when they visit either city is: “Can I
get by without French?” To be honest, you can have more fun if you master
a few words of French, but you can get by just fine without it. Although
once upon a time, the English and the French were throwing rocks at each
other in the streets of both cities, today, young Montréalers are often as
comfortable speaking English as they are French — or Spanish or Italian,
for that matter. In Québec City, the booming tourism industry has done 
its work in making English widely used and understood. You can always
expect warmth and cordiality from Québeckers, but especially if you make
an effort to speak their native tongue.
Part I: Introducing Montréal and Québec City 
14
Savoring the language
Before taking your trip, why not take some time to brush up on your French? Québec
City is almost entirely French-speaking, and in Montréal, some of the most interesting
parts of the city are predominantly French. Although you don’t need to speak French
to get around either city, knowing when to drop the occasional civility, such as bon-
jour and au revoir, or s’il vous plait and merçi, endears you to the locals. They may
answer you in English anyway, but they’ll be flattered by your effort. (The words and
expressions I provide on the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book can definitely get
you out of any tight spot.)

Soaking Up That European Flavor
That Québec and Montréal have so much European flair isn’t surprising.
These are two of the oldest cities in North America — and definitely among
the best preserved. In both, you can stroll cobblestone streets and gaze at
stone buildings and churches that date back to the 1700s. The relaxed
pace, late hours, and abundance of cafes only add to the illusion that
you’re somewhere in Europe. For maximum old-world impact, visit the port
areas of both cities. In Vieux-Québec, don’t miss Le Petit Champlain. In
Montréal, la rue Notre-Dame or la rue St-Paul transport you back in time.
Following Your Stomach
Thanks to the ongoing French influence on local cuisine, Montréal and
Québec City are both renowned for excellent restaurants and a refined
approach to dining. And trust me, it’s getting better every day. That said,
Québeckers also eat their share of fast food, so you want to be selective
about where you eat. Chapters 10 and 18 give you the lowdown on the
best food for every budget in both cities.
Excellent eateries can be found everywhere, but in some neighborhoods,
you just can’t get a bad meal. Québec’s Old City houses many fine
choices, such as the Café du Monde. Montréal’s Old Port area is actually
not the best place to eat, but rue St-Denis and boulevard St-Laurent
offer impressive dining choices.
Experiencing the Festival Frenzy
Other cities may have summer festivals, but Montréal is famous for its
festivals. Unlike elsewhere, this city shuts down large portions of down-
town for a string of festivals lasting practically all summer long. An
intoxicating mix of English and French permeates these widely attended
events. The fact that party-hearty Montréalers attend the festivals in
droves, not to mention various states of intoxication, certainly doesn’t
hurt. There’s definitely a je ne sais quoi about the dozens of summer
events here, whether it’s the Montréal International Jazz Festival, the
Just for Laughs Comedy Festival, the International Film Festival, the
Nuits d’Afrique African-music festival, or the FrancoFolies (the largest
French-language music festival in the world).
See Chapter 3 for a calendar of the major festivals in Montréal and
Québec City.
Living It Up After Hours
Back in the 1920s, when the rest of North America was in the grips of
Prohibition, Montréal was known as the “City of Sin” for its freewheeling,
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Montréal and Québec City 15

immoral ways. Among modern-day Canadians, the city is still revered 
for late bar closings (last call is at 3 a.m.), public affection (couples get
very cozy on benches in public parks), and general lack of political 
correctness — all of which can create a carnival-like atmosphere after
dark. If you want to let your hair down or stay out all night, Montréal
offers endless opportunities for entertainment. You can roam the hop-
ping club scenes, which are concentrated along boulevard St-Laurent,
rue Crescent, and rue St-Denis.
Checking Out the Many Faces of Montréal
France isn’t the only culture you taste in Montréal — and I mean that 
literally. Dozens of other nationalities have marked out distinct corners
of the city and filled them with great restaurants. In sheer numbers of
immigrants, Montréal doesn’t compare to multicultural havens like
Toronto and Vancouver, but Montréal’s long-established ethnic neigh-
borhoods have left a lasting mark, and they continue to play a vital role
on the urban landscape.
Have a cappuccino at Café Italia in Little Italy, pick up some bagels on
rue St-Viateur in the heart of Montréal’s Orthodox Jewish neighborhood,
or grab a souvlaki along avenue du Parc, with its concentration of Greek
restaurants, and you’ll see what I mean.
Many of these areas boast interesting architecture as well, such as the
famous winding staircases of the Plateau and Little Italy; winding cobble-
stone streets and graceful, stone buildings of Vieux-Montréal; and the
beautiful churches, basilicas, and cathedrals throughout the city.
Walking (and Skiing and Eating) 
in a Winter Wonderland
There’s no denying winter in Montréal and Québec City, where tempera-
tures can regularly dip to –5°F (–20°C) or lower for weeks on end. However,
while many North Americans live in denial of their semi-Nordic surround-
ings, Québeckers embrace winter. By April, locals have had enough of
snow, slush, and those speeding sidewalk plows that terrorize pedestri-
ans. But from November to March, locals whisk away the winter blues by
dressing properly — and plenty stylishly — and then skiing, snowboard-
ing, skating, snowshoeing, and, let’s be honest, eating and drinking to
their heart’s content.
Join the fun and dive right into the season by taking your trip during
Québec City’s Winter Carnival or Montréal’s Fête des Neiges (Snow
Festival), both in February. In either city, you’re less than an hour from
great skiing and snowboarding destinations, such as Mont Tremblant or
Mont Ste-Anne. If you really can’t take the cold, you can always retreat
Part I: Introducing Montréal and Québec City 
16

to Montréal’s underground city, where you never have to leave the
safety of central heating to visit a number of museums, shopping cen-
ters, skyscraper lobbies, and major hotels.
Eyeing Recommended Books and Movies
Complement your hard-nosed research about the nuts-and-bolts of 
your trip to Montréal and Québec City with some lighter fare. From the
following novels and films you’ll gain a better picture of life in Québec.
I’ve limited most of my recommendations to English movies and books;
however, it’s a minority perspective. Remember: Most media in Québec
is in French, so, if you took French immersion or if you like foreign films
with subtitles, there’s a whole other vast world of titles to explore.
Turning the pages
Montréalers Leonard Cohen and the late Mordecai Richler were both
English-speaking Québec’s literary lions of the 20th century. Cohen’s The
Favourite Game and Beautiful Losers are set in Montréal and emblematic
of life in the 1960s and ’70s. Richler’s The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz
and Barney’s Version reveal much about the different facets of Montréal
that may not be apparent to the naked eye of a first-time visitor. Barney’s
Version won the Giller Prize in 1997, one of Canada’s most prestigious
book awards.
Though not a Montréal native, Hugh MacLennan wrote a novel, Two
Solitudes, that won the 1945 Governor General’s Award for Literature and
coined a term that’s still used to describe the collectively imagined
abyss between the lives of English- and French-speaking co-inhabitants
of Montréal and the province at large.
Though Québec’s independence may seem like a distant issue today,
during the most recent bout of separatist unrest in the early 1990s,
which prompted a referendum in 1995, Richler penned a satirical essay
entitled Oh Canada! Oh Québec! — his commentary on the mounting
political tension of the time. William Weintraub’s novel The Underdogs
speculates about life in Québec after separation.
The Anglo Guide to Survival in Québec by Josh Freed and Jon Kalina has
become a cult classic among expats of all stripes wanting the lowdown
on the hidden codes of la belle province — rife with humor, some of
what it reveals would possibly take years to learn otherwise.
In 1983, reviewers heralded Ken Dryden’s The Game as the best book 
on hockey and, perhaps, the greatest sports book ever. It can also be
enjoyed by someone who has never seen the game. This memoir tells of
day-to-day life on the Montréal Canadiens, Stanley Cup dynasty team of
the ’70s — at a time when hockey and les glorieux were everything in
Québec. They won six league championships during Dryden’s eight

years playing. It reveals what the whole era was like, beyond hockey,
including his experiences as an Anglophone in French-speaking Québec.
Screening films
Like Toronto and Vancouver, Montréal is a popular destination for
Hollywood movie productions — which seems to ensure the presence of
at least one A-list celebrity in town at any time. Montréal’s varied archi-
tecture offers many different looks, making it a great place to shoot “on
location.” By and large, the scenes shot in Montréal are for movies set
elsewhere. Montréal rarely gets to play itself. This is particularly true of
Vieux Montréal, which regularly stands in for European cities: Today it’s
Paris, tomorrow Prague.
Nonetheless, there are several movies actually set in Montréal. A young
Richard Dreyfuss plays the lead in The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz
(1974), a coming-of-age story adapted from Mordecai Richler’s novel. In
1989, Québécois director Denys Arcand received an Oscar nomination
for Jesus of Montréal, which follows a troupe of actors through the con-
sequences arising from their avant-garde update of a “passion play” 
for a local parish. Another homegrown movie is Eldorado (1995), where
streetscapes from Montréal’s Plateau neighborhood are the backdrop for
several days in the lives of an odd cast of characters during a summer
heat wave. In Afterglow (1997), Nick Nolte and Julie Christie star in this
drama about two Montréal couples cheating on each other.
The Score (2001), with Robert De Niro and Edward Norton, is a heist
flick, with a brief cameo by Marlon Brando. Almost the entire movie
takes place in Vieux Montréal, along rue St-Paul, Est, in front of the
Marché Bonsecours and near the Canada Customs House, on the west-
ern edge of this historic district. (They’re trying to break in.)
Mambo Italiano (2003) is a comedy arising from the fuss caused by
Angelo and Nino, two first-generation Italian-Canadians, who are a gay
couple and must come out to their somewhat more traditional families.
Denys Arcand’s The Barbarian Invasions (2003) won an Oscar for Best
Foreign-language Film. It’s the sequel to Arcand’s Decline of the American
Empire (1986), which also received an Oscar nomination, but, alas,
didn’t win.
C.R.A.Z.Y. (2005) is the latest film out of Québec to make a stir. It won the
audience award at the festival in Venice and Best Canadian Feature Film
at the Toronto International Film Festival in the fall of 2005. It’s Canada’s
Foreign-Language hopeful for the 2006 Academy Awards.

 Examining the four seasons of each city

 Timing your trip with your favorite event
M
ontréal is always hopping — no matter when you decide to visit —
but the weather is always an issue. During the year, Montréal’s cli-
mate swerves between scorching summer heat waves and icy winter cold
snaps. Between these extremes, spring and fall are as unpredictable as
they are short.
Québec City is 250km (155 miles) down the St. Lawrence River from
Montréal, and 1 degree of latitude to the north, so the winters tend to be
a couple of degrees Fahrenheit colder. Snowfalls are heavier and more
consistent than in Montréal. In fact, by the end of the winter, the accu-
mulated snow in the streets can reach as high as the rooftops. Summers
are a little cooler than those in Montréal, but they can still be surpris-
ingly hot and humid. During summer evenings, a wind off the river can
make you feel a bit chilly.
Be aware when making travel plans that weather extremes and unpre-
dictability are the general rules. The heat — or cold — can hit when you
least expect it. Bring a sweater, even in July.
Revealing the Two Faces of 
Montréal and Québec City
Freezing temperatures, snowy conditions, and icy roads may intimidate
some travelers, but for residents of Montréal and Québec City, winter’s
harsh conditions are merely facts of life. We simply don more layers,
tread carefully over icy patches, and spend more time indoors. As soon
as we have enough snow and the temperatures are low enough, we

swing into hardy outdoor pursuits, such as ice hockey, cross-country
skiing, skating, snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling — and even
ice fishing, which is incredibly popular in Québec.
Fortunately, all these activities can be done within an hour’s drive of
either Montréal or Québec City. If you’re tempted by the idea of trekking
into the wilderness in winter, just remember that daylight hours are
extremely short from November until March.
Quiet, midnight snowfalls and pristine snowbanks never seem to lose
their magic. Fresh snow turns Québec City, with its fortifications, cannons,
French colonial architecture, and cliff-top setting next to the river, into a
winter wonderland. For the first two weeks in February, the provincial
capital celebrates its Nordic spirit with the Québec City Winter Carnival,
the world’s largest outdoor winter festival. In 2003, this Carnaval de
Québec celebrated its 50th anniversary.
Come March, however, all that snow turns into salty, gray-brown slush
that coats both cities and drives everyone nuts. Navigating through
slush ponds is an arduous, nerve-jangling task, whether you’re driving or
walking, and the salt that city officials dump on the roads to thaw the ice
stains pant legs and ruins shoes.
When spring comes, it’s short; this is partly because Montréalers inter-
pret any warm weather as proof that summer has begun. At the first sign
of a parasol on a terrace, locals hit the streets and start tearing off their
clothing. Really.
From the grease, glitz, and green light of the Formula One Canadian
Grand Prix in early June to the last curtain of the Montréal World Film
Festival in September, outdoor events and festivals jam this city’s
summer schedule. By the end of June, Montréal is a steamy urban
jungle, where throngs of locals and visitors flock the streets for free out-
door concerts, stand-up comedy shows, open-air film screenings, and
more. Summer in Montréal is one long party.
Experiencing the Secret of the Seasons
Your tolerance for cold — or heat — is probably the first aspect to con-
sider when planning your trip to Montréal and Québec City. In the fol-
lowing sections, I tell you what to expect from the seasons. Table 3-1
provides the average temperatures and precipitations for Montréal, and
Table 3-2 provides the information for Québec City.

Spring
With the annual great thaw, excitement in both cities builds as snow and
ice melt away:
 Days are longer, particularly during daylight saving time.
 You encounter less snow, sleet, and cold.
 After a barren winter, life returns to the streets.
The dicey weather of the short transition between winter and summer,
however, comes with its drawbacks:
 You usually can’t put away your coat, hat, and gloves until the
middle or end of April.
 As temperatures warm and the snow melts, expect a bit of every-
thing, weather-wise. Definitely be prepared for some rain.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 21

 Enormous slush ponds form at every street corner. Be prepared by
wearing waterproof footwear or risk spending some of your stay
with cold, wet feet.
Summer
After the heat of a summer day, when the sun goes down, the city’s
nightlife comes alive:
 Expect festivals galore. Both in Montréal and Québec City, the
summer season brings many special events.
 People in the streets bask in the glorious weather.
 Eating and drinking moves outdoors. People dine on their balconies.
Restaurants open their patios, and the parks are filled with picnick-
ing families (a popular option for travelers, too, because drinking
wine and beer in parks is perfectly legal, as long as you accompany
your drink with a meal).
On the downside, the heat and the crowds can get unbearable, so you
may want to seek refuge in your air-conditioned hotel room — if you can
find one, that is. Here are some other drawbacks:
 The crowds of tourists and festival-goers, although loads of fun,
can be enough to give you a mild fit of agoraphobia.
 The heat can be brutal — and it’s not just the temperature. Montréal
and Québec City can be unbearably humid in the summer.
 Booking a room, particularly during the major festivals, can be 
difficult.
 Rates at hotels and attractions are high.
 During the Construction Holidays, in the last two weeks of July,
many Québeckers take their summer vacations. It’s a major holi-
day; so, many out-of-town accommodations can be booked solid 
at this time. Québec City also gets a major influx of visitors from
around the province during these two weeks.
Fall
Brisk fall days are glorious, with the brilliantly colored leaves, harvest
bounty at the markets, and temperatures that are typically ideal:
 The leaves change color.
 Temperatures are cooler and usually remain pleasantly warm until
the end of September.
 You have an easier time finding accommodations.
 Restaurants keep their terraces open practically until the first frost,
when people eventually make their way inside.
Part I: Introducing Montréal and Québec City 
22

 The cultural calendar kicks up again with the start of the seasons at
the theater, opera, ballet, symphony, and arts in general.
However, as winter begins, autumn can start to turn nasty:
 Cold, unpredictable weather can set in as early as October. First
you see frost, then the ground freezes, and then you get snow.
 Most of the outdoor festivals are over, and the winter activities
haven’t begun yet, so on overcast days the cities can feel a tad drab.
Winter
Instead of seeing the snow and ice as impediments, your best bet is to
regard them as opportunities for seasonal recreation and leisure. By
braving the extreme conditions in the name of fun, or, le fun as locals 
are likely to say, you’re taking part in Québec’s Nordic spirit:
 It’s sunny almost all the time, and the days can be really exhilarat-
ing, even if your hands and feet are numb, your glasses are fogged,
and you have hat-head all the time.
 By the end of December, both cities usually offer enough snow and
ice for all winter sports. Skaters at the artificially frozen rink in the
Bonsecours Basin (Montréal’s Old Port) are usually the first to hit
the ice outdoors.
 Good food, not to mention drink, goes down that much better when
you’ve worked up an appetite by braving the elements all day.
Lots of layers and defensive driving are the winter’s watchwords:
 You need a hat, mittens, and a scarf — and not just as fashion
accessories.
 Driving can be difficult. When it snows, roads become slippery or
icy and visibility is poor.
Viewing Montréal’s Calendar of Events
Montréal is definitely a four-season town — although one of its seasons
can be brutally cold — so you get plenty of reasons to celebrate all year
’round.
January/February
In January, bundled-up kids celebrate the annual Fête des Neiges (liter-
ally, Snow Party). The festival takes place on Île Ste-Hélène and features
ice skating, ice sculptures, tube slides, dogsleds, mitten-making work-
shops, and more. Most activities are free of charge. For more informa-
tion, visit www.fetedesneiges.com. Three weekends in late January
and early February.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 23

The Montréal High Lights Festival (www.montrealhighlights.com) is
an adult version of the snow party, combining multimedia light shows, a
performing arts program, and guest appearances by world-renowned
chefs at the trendier downtown eateries. Eleven days in mid- to late
February.
March
The International Festival of Films on Art (www.artfifa.com) is the
only festival of its kind in the Americas. The screenings happen at differ-
ent venues around town; the programming also includes conferences
and seminars on the topic. Ten days in mid-March.
When the sap in Québec’s maple trees starts to drip, it’s Sugaring-Off
time; groups of friends and families flock to the countryside to visit
sugar shacks where maple farmers boil the sap and make syrup. The
main event on these excursions is a traditional meal in a mess hall where
fresh maple syrup is used as a topping for everything — gulp, even fried
pork fat. Back in town, outdoor stands at markets and on sidewalks sell
tire (pronounced teer), which is maple taffy that’s made by ladling thick,
hot, unrefined syrup from a steaming caldron onto a bed of snow. When
the syrup cools, you wrap the gooey stuff on a Popsicle stick and watch
salivating kids devour it. The fun starts in early March and lasts until
mid-April.
Everyone in Montréal is Irish on St. Patrick’s Day, despite historic ten-
sions between the English and the French. Beginning at noon, thousands
of onlookers line rue Ste-Catherine for Montréal’s St. Patrick’s Day
Parade, a procession of floats, marching bands, and folk dancing. After
the parade, the crowds get a little rowdy and roam the streets in search
of green beer. The parade is the oldest and longest-running one of its
kind in North America. For more info, not beer, visit Tourisme Montréal
on the Web (www.tourisme-montreal.org). March 17.
April
In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed Montréal as the World Book Capital. 
During that time, the city was responsible for leading the world in pro-
moting books and reading. Alas, the honor lasts but a year. However, 
for five days early in the month on an annual basis, Blue Metropolis
(www.blue-met-bleu.com) is Montréal’s international literary festival.
From its quiet beginnings in 1999, it has since grown into a significant
event on the cultural calendar. Early April.
At the end of the month, the Festival de théâtre des amériques
(www.fta.qc.ca) begins. This critically acclaimed biennial offers two
weeks of French-language theater productions from the Americas and
Europe in odd-numbered years. Plays tend toward the edgy, and many
make their North American debuts here. The programming lasts for a
week into May.
Part I: Introducing Montréal and Québec City 
24

May
Bikes are popular here. Féria du vélo de Montréal (www.velo.qc.ca),
or Bike Fest, is a weeklong event near the end of the month celebrating
this two-wheeled, environmentally sound, and health-inducing form of
transportation. In fact, this is a unique event in North America. One of
the high points is the Tour de l’Ile, which draws over 30,000 partici-
pants. The course, which changes annually, winds through a number 
of Montréal neighborhoods, making for a fun group or family outing.
If you’re in Montréal this time of year, take advantage of Museum Day,
when entry to select museums is free, as is a shuttle service running
among them. For more, check out www.museesmontreal.org. Last
Sunday in May.
June
Start the month off at the Mondial de la bière (www.festivalmondial
biere.qc.ca), or World Beer Festival, where visitors sample 250 liquid
products, including beer, scotch, cider, and port, from around the world.
It’s one of the largest festivals of its kind on the continent.
Though there are several electronic music events over the course of a
year, MUTEK (www.mutek.ca) is Montréal’s premier happening. It takes
place early in June and draws acts from all over the world: new music
producers brandishing their high-tech gear — and making suitably far-
out sounds. Some of the performances are simultaneously broadcast 
via the Web site.
Les FrancoFolies de Montréal (www.francofolies.com) is a festival
that features a bevy of French-language musicians from across the
planet. It takes place on the city’s main festival site which closes to 
car traffic and opens to hordes of music lovers and people watchers
throughout the summer. Les FrancoFolies kicks off the action for ten
days in mid-June.
The Montréal Fringe Festival (www.montrealfringe.ca) offers off-off-
Broadway-type drama on boulevard St-Laurent. Ten days in mid-June.
Late in the month, the Formula One Grand Prix (www.grandprix.ca)
makes its only Canadian stop at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Île Notre-
Dame, where, at press time, homegrown F-1 hero Jacques Villeneuve has
not finished a race on the track named after his father since his second
place debut in 1996. In the weeklong festivities leading up to Sunday’s
race, fumes of motor oil and champagne mix freely on the main drags
downtown.
The Montréal International Jazz Festival (www.montrealjazzfest.
com) is the summer’s main event. For two weeks, a boatload of interna-
tional acts plays free outdoor shows and world-class headliners top the
bills at ticketed venues. Each year, well over 1.5 million people swarm
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 25

the downtown site of the festival, which takes place on the streets and 
in parks surrounding Place des Arts, Montréal’s main performing arts
center. Like clockwork, every year, you can count on the bands to strike
up in the last week of June and carry on for a week into July.
At this time of year, after dark, it’s always tough to choose between 
an evening at the Jazz Fest or catching the Montréal International
Fireworks Competition (www.lemondialsaq.com). The riverfront in
Vieux-Montréal is an ideal place to watch the pyrotechnics, which go 
off at 10 p.m. Every Saturday, mid-June to late July.
July
For just a month, a local theater troupe gives free outdoor presentations
of the Bard’s original plays during the annual Shakespeare-in-the-Park
(www.shakespeareinthepark.ca) tour. Visit its Web site for the sched-
ule. Mid-June to mid-August.
Right after the Jazz Fest, the Festival International Nuits d’Afrique
(www.festivalnuitsdafrique.com), or Nights of Africa Festival,
showcases African and Caribbean musicians at paid venues downtown.
Nuits d’Afrique is nearly two decades old, and by now, many of the great-
est names in world music have participated. Ten days in early July.
Gory B-movies and improbable sci-fi action are the hallmarks of the
Fantasia Film Festival (www.fantasiafest.com), held in a state-of-the-
art theater at Concordia University’s downtown campus. The screenings
start in mid-July, and for about three weeks, these are some of the
hottest tickets in town.
Beach volleyball in Montréal? Yes! As strange as it may sound, mid-
month, the women of the International Volleyball Federation World
Cup (www.fivb.org) make a stop here for a five-day beach-volleyball
tournament. The action is riveting. It’s mid-season and between two
Grand Slam events, so the competitors are in top form. The action goes
down at the Uniprix Stadium in the northern reaches of the city.
The Just For Laughs Comedy Festival (www.hahaha.com) is another
roaring success with locals and visitors alike. This outdoor festival has
launched the likes of Jim Carrey, Ray Romano, and Tim Allen. It takes
place on rue St-Denis south of rue Sherbrooke, where the scene turns
into a veritable freak show, with clowns, street acts, and circus-school
students all vying for the attention of passersby. Do your best not to end
up as the victim of a gag on the festival’s spin-off, candid-camera TV
show. By all accounts, it’s a hysterical two weeks in mid-July.
August
The Divers/Cité Festival (www.diverscite.org) starts off the month
with a weeklong celebration thrown by Montréal’s gay community. It’s
capped off by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered Pride
Part I: Introducing Montréal and Québec City 
26

Parade on a Sunday. It’s an absolutely fab party, which has attracted
800,000 people in past years.
Join the caber-toss at the Montréal Highland Games (www.montreal
highlandgames.qc.ca), a sporting event that could best be described
as the pole vault’s distant, cross-dressing cousin. Men in kilts should not
be vaulting over anything. Thankfully, here, it’s the caber that goes over
the bar atop the uprights. Also: bag pipes, drumming, and highland
dancers over the course of a fun-filled Sunday, Celtic style; early in the
month.
Tennis, anyone? Mid-month, Montréal hosts one-half of the Tennis
Masters Canada (www.masters-series.com), sharing it with Toronto.
Each year, the women’s and men’s tournaments alternate between the
cities. The eight-day tournament is a warm-up for the U.S. Open; so,
many top-ranked players make a show here.
Park Maisonneuve, next to the Olympic Stadium, hosts La Fête des
enfants de Montréal — a weekend festival for Montréal’s kids. 
Mid-August.
Then, near the end of the month, the Montréal Indy (www.molsonindy.
com) brings another class of screaming race cars back to the Gilles
Villeneuve track (also discussed in the “June” section).
And, if that’s not fast-track enough, movie stars and paparazzi descend
on the city for the World Film Festival (www.ffm-montreal.org).
Screenings, premieres, and parties abound. “What, I’m not on the list? Do
you know who I am?” Late August through second week in September.
September/October
Warmly anticipated by Montréalers, cooler weather brings the Magic 
of Lanterns (www.ville.montreal.qc.ca/jardin) to the Botanical
Gardens, a dazzling annual display of over 700 handcrafted lanterns of
silk and bamboo from Shanghai. The show’s theme changes annually
and it lasts from the beginning of September until the end of October.
Every second year, it’s Mois de la photo (www.moisdelaphoto.com), or
Image and Imagination, and for a month, the city stands still just long
enough to play host to a variety of exhibits and events related to photog-
raphy, including several outdoor galleries along major streets. Early
September to early October.
At the beginning of October, over the course of a weekend, Québec’s arts
community holds an open house of sorts, called Les journées de la cul-
ture (www.journeesdelaculture.qc.ca). Across the province, artists
from every métier open the doors to their workshops, studios, coopera-
tives, and other creative spaces to the general public. The three days
offer a variety of demonstrations, guided tours, and discussion forums.
From architecture, to circus arts, to electronic art, to pluridisciplinary
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 27

art — it’s all encompassing. The 2006 edition marks the event’s tenth
anniversary. Three days in early October.
Slated at the beginning of October, Pop Montréal (www.popmontreal.
com) is a relative newcomer to the city’s festival circuit. It’s a weeklong
bender staging a variety of alt-rock shows, reflective of the local live-
music scene and focusing on innovative and independent artists both
homegrown and from abroad. It’s a thriving event and Montréal seems to
have become a hotbed for producing this kind of breakout talent as of
late, so there’s lots of buzz. (Think: Rufus Wainwright, The Sam Roberts
Band, Arcade Fire, The Dears, and Wolf Parade — just to name a few.)
Also, early in October, over 12,000 people of all persuasions attend the
Black and Blue Festival’s Main Event (www.bbcm.org), an extravagant,
mega-dance party with DJs and choreographed live performances,
making it one of the largest AIDS benefit events in the world. Everyone’s
there to dance into the wee hours of the morning for a good cause.
The Montréal International Festival of New Cinema and New Media
(www.nouveaucinema.ca) pushes the frontiers of high-tech art a little
more each year, with its eclectic mix of provocative film and other digital
arts. Mid-October.
The Botanical Gardens’ Great Pumpkin Ball is as close as Montréal gets
to the Peanuts gang’s It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. Literally hun-
dreds of decorated pumpkins are on display in the main greenhouse
during most of October. It’s actually a contest. There’s a resident witch,
who hosts the proceedings. Throughout October.
The Grand Masquerade (www.grandemascarade.com) is a Halloween-
themed celebration that takes place on Place Jaques Cartier and at the
Marché Bonsecours in Vieux-Montréal. The historic part of the city is an
ideal location for scaring up ghosts of yore with a costumed ball. You
don’t have to be in costume to join the fun, but dressing up is encour-
aged. Several evenings leading up to Halloween.
November
During the Santa Claus Parade, Montréalers bid adieu to the big guy just
before he leaves for work in the North Pole. Yes, Santa spends his off
season in Montréal. Kids line up to watch the procession down rue Ste-
Catherine, shivering with excitement until the very last float. For infor-
mation, call % 514-937-7754. Mid-November.
Montréal’s documentary film festival, Rencontres internationales du
documentaire de Montréal (www.ridm.qc.ca), features the work of
local, Canadian, and international documentary filmmakers. Ten days in
mid-November.

Checking Out Québec City’s 
Calendar of Events
The fun doesn’t end just because the temperatures are frigid. Some of
the city’s best events take place in the beginning of the year. But great
events occur in the other seasons, too.
January/February
A red-sashed snowman known as the Bonhomme du Carnaval leads 
the festivities at the Carnaval de Québec (% 418-626-3716; www.
carnaval.qc.ca). More than a million people brave the cold to join
parades, concerts, and nightly winter balls in an ice palace. Many fortify
themselves against the cold with caribou, a Québec specialty consisting
of red wine and pure alcohol, which in colonial times contained actual
caribou blood. Two weeks in late January and early February.
March/April
Slurp up as much maple syrup as you can at the cabanes à sucre (sugar
shacks) surrounding the city, from the beginning of March to mid-April.
Festival de la Gastronomie de Québec/Coupe des nations (www.
festivalgastronomiequebec.com) is a food-and-drink extravaganza
and competition that showcases Québec’s regional specialties. Three
days in late April.
Over the course of five days at the end of March and at the beginning of
April, the Festival de cinéma des 3 Amériques (www.fc3a.com), a pan-
American film festival, screens over 100 short and feature-length films in
Saint-Roch, a neighborhood just outside the Old City.
May
The Manifestation international d’art de Québec (www.manifdart.
org), a biennial exhibition taking place in the odd years (the next one is
in 2007), showcases the newest and the best contemporary and multi-
disciplinary artists in Québec City. First two weeks of May.
During the last half of May, the Carrefour international de theatre
(www.carrefourtheatre.qc.ca) is a festival that stages nearly 100

Planning Your Trip 
to Montréal and
Québec City

In this part . . . 
P
lanning your trip in advance will help you hit the ground
running, and save you from learning while on vacation
when your time’s most precious. While in either Montréal or
Québec City, you want to be out and about on the town expe-
riencing the street life, yakking with locals, shopping for gear,
tasting different foods from around the world, and drinking it
all in. It’s a balancing act — of course, you’ll have to refer to
this book and your other material throughout, but the more
you know beforehand the better equipped you’ll be to enjoy
these cities to their fullest. This part focuses on the essential
steps of setting a budget for your trip, ﬁguring out how to get
to Québec, and other important matters to consider before
you take off.

Managing Your Money

 Gauging how you’ll spend your money
 Avoiding hidden expenses and finding ways to cut costs
 Understanding the Canadian dollar, or “Loonie”
 Considering different ways to carry cash and pay
 Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
O
n the whole, the living is easy in Montréal and Québec City. Like the
French, Québeckers tend to consider eating at restaurants and going
out more like a basic human right than a luxury. That attitude somehow
keeps prices affordable. Plus, you can find plenty to do for free — strolling
quaint streets, gazing at stunning architecture, gawking at beautiful
people. Factor in the still-favorable exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, and
you have yourself a pretty amazing vacation for the money.
Planning a Budget
Planning a budget is a little bit like performing a juggling act. You have
six vacation pins: lodging, transportation, dining, attractions, shopping,
and nightlife. You can’t really afford to drop any of them (that is, unless
you want to be truly spartan), but you may want to throw some pins
higher than others. First, decide ahead of time what’s most important to
you: Staying in a fine hotel? Eating gourmet meals? Hitting the chicest
shops? After you set your priorities, look for ways to cut costs in other
areas. To get you started, the following sections show you what to
expect — and expect to pay — from each category of basic travel
expenses.
Lodging
Whether you like it or not, accommodations are your biggest expense.
Before leaving on your trip, do your homework to find bargains and
reserve rooms. Plan ahead, and you may save enough to stay another
night! (See Chapter 9 for details on getting the best hotel deals.)

The minimum you want to spend on accommodations per night is
around C$100 (US$85). Sure you can get better deals, but your comfort
may be compromised.
Transportation
Here’s an area where you can save. You don’t need a car unless you 
want to take day trips around Montréal and Québec City. Driving in
either city can be a nightmare, and you don’t need to put yourself
through it. Québec’s Old City is so small and compact you can walk
everywhere. Montréal has a great public-transportation system, with 
a subway that serves all major attractions, even the ones outside the
city. A booklet of six tickets (valid for both buses and the subway) costs
C$11.25 (US$9.60) — less than the price of a single taxi ride across 
downtown.
If you’re bent on renting a car, check Chapter 7 for details on getting a
good rental deal. When you’re doing your calculations, remember that
gas is expensive in Canada. At press time, the price of gas was hovering
around the C$1 mark (per liter), or the equivalent of US$3.21/gallon.
Nothing on the nightly news suggests prices will be dropping any time
this century.
Montréal and Québec City (outside of the old cities) have an abundance
of taxis that are easy to flag in case you’re too tired to walk back to your
hotel. Just find a busy street and raise your arm.
See Chapter 5 for ways to save on your trip to and from Montréal or
Québec City. Booking your travel arrangements well in advance is one
sure way to save money. Researching and comparing the prices of lots of
different fare options, like discount airlines, seat-sales, courier fares, or
flying standby, is another. Usually both of these factor into what you end
up paying.
Dining
Dining is probably not the place to trim the fat in your budget. Look at 
it this way: Eating out in Montréal and Québec City is an entertaining,
potentially evening-long activity. Splurge at the dinner table, and you
won’t need to spend money on entertainment for the rest of the night.
With a little planning, you won’t need to bust the bank to satisfy your
palate, either. I suggest eating a big breakfast, and then cutting back on
lunch, either by grabbing a sandwich at a cafe or picnicking in a park.
You can get inexpensive lunches at many ethnic eateries for, usually,
C$10 (US$8.50) per person. Prices at fast food restaurants are compara-
ble to U.S. prices, so just factor in the exchange rate. See Chapters 10
and 18 for recommendations. In the evening, most fine restaurants offer
a table d’hôte (also called a menu) that’s usually a good deal with prices
ranging from C$20 to C$65 (US$17–US$55.25) for a meal, not including
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
34

drinks. For the higher-end places, expect to spend from C$30 to C$100
(US$25.50–US$85) per person for a complete dinner, including drinks.
Attractions
The adult admission price for most museums and attractions is between
C$10 and C$12 (US$8.50–US$10.25). Pricier attractions, such as La Ronde,
set you back about C$28 (US$24) for adults and C$17 (US$14.50) for kids
under 12. Kids under 6 get into most attractions for free. See Chapters 11
and 19 for exact prices in each city.
Shopping
Shopping in Montréal and Québec City can be hazardous to your 
budget. With so much great stuff to buy — from clothes to art to home
decorations — the abundance of merchandise may make you lose your
perspective, not to mention your senses. I recommend that you give
yourself a shopping allowance before you leave home, either a daily one,
a weekly one, or one that’s for the whole trip (if you’re disciplined and
do your accounting regularly). If shopping isn’t your thing, you can save
big bucks in this department.
Nightlife
Nightlife is another area where money can disappear before you know it.
But you can indulge inexpensively. The cheapest time to visit a bar is
during happy hour, or cinq à sept, as it’s called in Québec. (The expres-
sion “five to seven” refers to the early evening hours, not the number of
drinks you get for one price!) Drinks usually range between C$5 and C$8
(US$4.25–US$6.75).
Tickets for shows seem to start around C$10 (US$8.50) and go up to
C$100 (US$85), or more, for prime seats. The cabaret show (without
dinner) at the Montréal casino starts at C$43 (US$36.50). Movie prices
range from C$9 to C$13 (US$7.75–US$11). For details on the prices of 
outings, see Chapters 15 and 21.
Watching Out for Hidden Expenses
Planning a travel budget is like renovating a house. It always ends up
costing more than you think. Both endeavors are laden with tempta-
tions. Trust me, if you’re setting out to be a spartan traveler, Montréal
and Québec City will test your willpower. To help you stick to your
budget, keep in mind the tips in the following sections.
Taking taxes into account
There’s a price to easy living throughout Québec: steep taxes on sales
and services. Whenever you see a price, except on alcoholic beverages,
add 15 percent.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 35

You can still live it up here with limited damage to your pocketbook. The
secret? Make a travel budget and stick to it.
Non-Canadians can get a refund on the federal Goods and Services Tax,
GST, or Tax Produits et Services (TPS) in French, if it adds up to more
than C$14 (US$12) in tax or C$200 (US$170) in hotel bills. However,
unless you’re an amateur accountant, the paperwork may prove to 
be more of a hassle than it’s worth. Just make sure you keep original
receipts. If you want to go after the refund, pick up a copy of the booklet
“Tax Refund for Visitors to Canada” at duty-free shops, hotels, and
tourist offices. Complete and submit the forms with your original
receipts within a year of the purchases. Note that you have to attach
your original boarding pass or travel ticket to the application. Complete
instructions are available on the Canada Customs Web site (www.
ccra-adrc.gc.ca/tax/nonresidents/visitors).
Tipping
To tip or not to tip, and how much? These are the eternal questions
when you find yourself in a strange land. In Québec, tipping waiters 
15 percent is the norm. You can go higher or lower if you’d like to make
a statement about the quality of the service. Taxi drivers usually expect 
10 percent. For bellhops, C$1 or C$2 (US85¢–US$1.75) per bag does the
trick. For hotel housekeeping, count C$1 (US85¢) per person per day. For
valet parking, plan on C$1 or C$2 (US85¢–US$1.75).
In restaurants, remember that you’re tipping on the total price before
taxes, not the total on the bottom of the bill. There’s an easy trick to cal-
culate a 15 percent tip. Just add up the two taxes, federal and provincial,
that appear above the total on the bill — they equal 15 percent of the
bill’s subtotal, which is how much you should tip.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
A little foresight and planning are all you need to cut down on your basic
travel expenses. Follow these tips so that you can free up some extra
funds for a shopping spree or a wild night on the town.
 Go in the off season. You get better deals when you travel at non-
peak times between November and April. For winter trips, avoid
the Christmas season, New Year’s Eve, and the school March break.
 Travel midweek. Flights are cheaper on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
and Thursdays. When you book your flight, ask which days have
the best rates.
 Check out package tours. You may get airfare, hotel, and even
ground transportation and attractions for less if you buy them all 
at once, through a packager. See Chapter 5 for details on finding
package deals.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
36

 Reserve a room with a kitchen. Doing a bit of cooking is an easy
way to save on your food budget. Grab some basic food items,
cereal, coffee, bread, and milk at a dépanneur (corner store) near
your hotel. Make some sandwiches before you leave in the morning
so that you can afford to splurge on some serious gastronomy in
the evening.
 Ask for discounts. You may be eligible for deals and not know it.
Membership in AAA, frequent-flier plans, trade unions, AARP, or
other groups may qualify you for savings on hotels, airfare, car
rentals, and meals. It never hurts to ask.
 Bunk with your kids. A room with two double beds usually doesn’t
cost more than one with a queen-size bed. Many hotels won’t
charge you extra if you put your little angels (usually under age 12)
in the extra bed. If they do charge a surplus, it’s still cheaper than
renting another room. Fees for rollaway beds are usually C$10 to
C$15 (US$8.50–US$12.75) per day.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. Lunch
tabs usually are a fraction of what dinner costs at top restaurants,
and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties. Chapters
10 and 18 suggest a number of cheap eats — some of the best
meals are at inexpensive ethnic joints.
 Walk. A good pair of walking shoes can save you plenty of money
getting around. Montréal and Québec City were meant for walking —
particularly the historic districts. Both are old cities, so car culture
isn’t as entrenched. Walking — combined with the Métro (subway),
city buses, and the occasional taxi ride — is an unbeatable way to
see either place.
Handling Money
Should you spend cash? Credit? Traveler’s checks? This section explains
the pros and con of the various options.
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying 
or what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home). But, that aside, the
only type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from
home is your personal checkbook.
Understanding the Loonie
The tail-side of the Canadian-dollar coin has an image of a loon, a bird
common to the Canadian north — therefore, it’s called a “Loonie.” It
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 37

seems natural that the two-dollar coin would be called a “Twonie” — and
it is. In Canada, coins come in denominations of $1 (Loonie), $2 (Twonie),
and 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, and 25¢.
Canadian bills are all sorts of different colors, prompting many Americans
to joke about them looking like Monopoly money — and until recently,
there was a lot of truth to that. They come in $5 (blue), $10 (purple), $20
(green), $50 (red), and $100 (brown) denominations.
Converting your greenbacks
As a currency, the Canadian dollar has always lagged behind the U.S.
dollar in terms of its value on the world market. However, as of late, the
Canadian currency has gained on the American; in fact, the Loonie is at
an all-time high against the greenback. This means that Canada is still a
deal — but less so than before.
The Bank of Canada, the country’s central bank, has a currency-converter
feature on their Web site (www.bankofcanada.ca). But Table 4-1 provides
a rough estimate for you.

The figures in Table 4-1 were accurate at the time of writing this guide,
they may no longer be valid by the time of your departure. Check with
your local bank, if you have any doubts. Don’t fret if you can’t score any
Canadian dollars before you leave — there’s an ATM at the airport that
will dispense them at your request.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash when you’re away from home is
from an ATM. The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and
PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe; look
at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, and then
call or check online for ATM locations at your destination.
The major Canadian banks in Montréal and Québec City and the bank-
card system they honor are as follows:
 Bank of Montréal: Cirrus
 Banque Nationale du Canada: Cirrus
 Caisse populaire Desjardins: PLUS
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 39

 CIBC: PLUS
 Royal Bank of Canada: Cirrus and PLUS
 Scotia Bank: Cirrus
Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) and your
daily withdrawal limit before you leave home. You’ll also want to keep in
mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a dif-
ferent bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international transac-
tions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (where they’re rarely
more than $3). On top of these fees, the bank from which you withdraw
cash may charge its own fee. With your bank, check the fees for with-
drawals from foreign ATMs before you leave.
Is there a place on Earth that doesn’t accept or exchange U.S. dollars? 
If there is, I’ve never seen it. But use them only if you’re in a pinch. You
get less bang for your buck when doing a cash exchange in a retail shop,
because on most cash transactions, the exchange rate can be up to 
10 percent higher.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses and generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t know you had one, call the number on the back of your
credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five to
seven business days, though some banks will provide you the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information. If you do opt for a cash advance, remember
that you’re charged interest from the moment of the transaction, rather
than only after your account’s billing date.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most 
banks assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by Visa,
MasterCard, or American Express for currency conversion on credit-card
charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you
factor in things like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check
exchange rates and service fees.
Some credit-card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so they don’t become suspicious when the card
is used numerous times in a foreign location and end up blocking your
card. Even if you don’t call you credit-card company in advance, you can
always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is refused.
But perhaps the most important tip is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip. For any number of reasons, a card may not work, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City

Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that enable you to withdraw small amounts of cash
as needed. However, keep in mind that you probably will be charged an
ATM withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own. So if you’re withdrawing
money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — 
provided that you don’t mind showing the required identification every
time you want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 to 4 percent. You can
also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling
% 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 and 2 per-
cent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000.
Call % 800-732-1322 for more information. AAA members can obtain
Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-
3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for
a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event they are stolen or
lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact your credit-card companies the minute you discover
your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest police
precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a police-
report number or record of the loss. Most credit-card companies have
an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they
may be able to wire you cash immediately or deliver an emergency
credit card within a day or two.
See the appendix for the major credit-card companies’ Canadian toll-free
numbers.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to 
you via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft or fraud is a potential complication of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; they might allow you to board the plane
if you can produce a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a
copy of the police report you filed. (Make copies of all such documenta-
tion and give them to someone you trust before you leave.)

Chapter 5
Getting to Montréal 
and Québec City
In This Chapter
 Making your travel arrangements
 Getting the best airfare
 Traveling to Montréal and Québec City
 Choosing the best package deal
S
o you’re ready to chill in Montréal and Québec City. Even if you’ve
been to another part of Canada before, you’re in for a big surprise,
because, it’s a whole different kind of place. Brush up on your French
pronunciation and get ready to plunge into a distinctive culture. But,
first, you’ll have to decide how to get to either of these great cities. Are
you coming by land, sea, or air?
Flying to Montréal or Québec City
If you’re traveling to Montréal, you’ll arrive at Montréal’s Pierre Elliott
Trudeau International Airport (% 800-465-1213 or 514-394-7377; www.
admtl.com), YUL in airline-speak, in the suburb of Dorval, a 20-minute
drive from downtown.
A number of major airlines serve Québec City’s Jean-Lesage International
Airport (% 418-640-2700), or YQB, but most of the traffic passes through
Montréal first.
Finding out which airlines fly there
In Montréal, passenger airline flights land at Pierre Elliot Trudeau
International Airport. For Québec City, airplanes touch-down at Jean
Lesage Airport. Here’s a brief description of each. For the contact infor-
mation of specific airlines mentioned, see the Quick Concierge at the
back of the book. For how to make your way to downtown Montréal and
Québec City from each airport, see Chapters 8 and 16, respectively.

 Montréal’s Trudeau airport is 20.4km (123⁄4 miles) from downtown.
Getting from the airport to downtown takes about 30 minutes from
door to door — if there’s no traffic. Many North American airline
carriers fly there nonstop from the United States: Air Canada 
(from Boston, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington), American
Airlines (from Chicago, Dallas, Miami, and New York), Atlantic
Southeast (from Atlanta), Continental (from Cleveland and New
York), Delta (from Atlanta), Northwest (from Detroit), United (from
Chicago, Minneapolis, and Washington), and US Airways (from
Philadelphia). Some international airlines also fly to Montreal non-
stop, including Air Canada (from Frankfurt, London, and Paris),
British Airways (from London), Czech Airlines (from Prague), KLM
(from Amsterdam), Olympic Airlines (from Athens), and Royal
Maroc Airlines (from Casablanca).
 Québec City’s Jean Lesage Airport is somewhat smaller. It’s served
nonstop by: Air Canada (from Montréal, Ottawa, and Toronto),
Northwest (from Detroit), and Continental (from New York).
Throughout the year, charter companies like Air Transat offer 
nonstop transatlantic flights from London and Paris.
Getting the best deal on your airfare 
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a coach seat), yet prices can vary by hun-
dreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and want to
get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies pay) the
premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your ticket far 
in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel midweek
(Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least expensive price —
usually a fraction of the full fare. On most flights, even the shortest hops
within the United States, the full fare is close to $1,000 or more, but a 
7- or 14-day advance-purchase ticket might cost less than half of that
amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for sales, usually
in seasons of low travel volume. You almost never see a sale around the
peak summer vacation months of July and August, or around
Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for inter-
national tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in weekend newspaper travel 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City

sections; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 to 75 percent of the ticket price, and
some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Web.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excel-
lent fares worldwide but particularly to that continent. Flights.com also
has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap (% 800-FLY-CHEAP;
www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith
MyTravel and has especially good access to fares for sunny destinations.
Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is
based in Montréal and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for
low fares; it’ll also book trips to places that U.S. travel agents won’t
touch, such as Cuba.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for www.expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different
business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the
same flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will
also send you a notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It’s a
browser add-on that purports to “search 140 sites at once” but, in real-
ity, only beats competitors’ fares as often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly services pro-
vided directly by the airlines. Most of the deals are announced Tuesday
or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only valid for
travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months in
advance. Sign up for weekly alerts at airline Web sites or check mega-
sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials, such as
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com). For last-minute trips,
www.site59.com in the United States and www.lastminute.com in
Europe often have better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service, like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Montréal to
Chapter 5: Getting to Montréal and Québec City 45

Québec City via Ottawa is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m.
or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before
you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have 
to play their “name your price” game. See Bidding for Travel (www.
biddingfortravel.com) for tips on playing the opaque-fare game.
Note: In 2004, Priceline added non-opaque service to its roster. You 
now have the option to pick exact flights, times, and airlines from a 
list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines
through a free E-mail service called E-Savers. Each week, the airline
sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You
can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging onto Smarter
Living (www.smarterliving.com), or you can go to each individual air-
line’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking, and
information on late-breaking bargains.
One more Web site: I’m a bit biased, but I think Frommer’s (www.
frommers.com) is an excellent and comprehensive travel-planning
resource, with daily travel tips and bargains, reviews, monthly vacation
giveaways, and a popular message-board section where readers post
queries and share advice.
Driving to Montréal or Québec City
From the south, you’ll either approach Montréal on Highway 10 or 15; at
the border, these highways are 87 from New York and 89 from Vermont.
When you hit the city limits, follow signs for downtown, or “Centre-ville.”
From both the east and west, you drive into Montréal on Highways 20 or
40. You’re also looking for “Centre-ville.”
Unless you’re crossing the border in Maine, where you’d eventually hit
Highway 73 to Québec City, cars from the United States should drive to
Montréal first, and then follow either highway 20 or 40 east to Québec
City.
Arriving by Other Means
If flying isn’t an option, or if you’re in the mood to see some countryside
panoramas, you can always take the train. It’s slower, but it’s more roman-
tic than air travel and not terribly stressful. Take a book along (we recom-
mend the one you’re reading now), spend hours talking to perfect
strangers, or stare out the window like a 6-year-old on a car trip with his
parents. Montréal’s Central Station is located at 895 rue de la Gauchetière
Ouest (% 514-989-2626). Québec’s Gare du Palais is located at 450 rue
de la Gare-du-Palais (% 418-692-3940).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
46

VIA Rail (% 888-842-7245; www.viarail.ca), Canada’s national pas-
senger rail network, offers significant discounts if you book at least five
days ahead of time. Since there are a limited number of discounted seats
per train, they can sell out before advance offers expire. If you know that
you’re taking the train, try to book early.
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) offers daily departures to
Montréal from New York City, departing in the morning and arriving in
the early evening.
Another option is traveling by bus. Greyhound Lines, Inc. (% 800-661-
8747; www.greyhound.com), travels to Montréal from the United States
and Ottawa. Another bus line operates the route from Toronto. Yet
another company takes care of busing people to and from Québec City.
Regardless, in Montréal, all buses arrive at the Station Centrale, 505 bd.
de Maisonneuve (% 888-999-3977 or 514-842-2281), in the Quartier Latin
neighborhood. In Québec City, the bus station, the Terminus Gare du
Palais, is located at 320 rue Abraham-Martin (% 418-525-3000).
Both Montréal and Québec City are increasingly popular ports for east-
ern seaboard boat cruises. The two cities are usually on St. Lawrence
River and Great Lakes itineraries. Conveniently, the historic districts 
of both, Vieux Montréal and Vieux Québec, both “must-sees” of any
stopover, are on the water, adjacent to the ports.
In Montréal, cruise ships dock in the commercial port. Travelers disem-
bark at the Iberville Passenger Terminal. It’s a short cab ride into town.
Check out the Port of Montréal’s Web site (www.port-montreal.com) for
more info, including a schedule of cruise vessels. Or, call % 514-283-7011.
Cruise-ship visitors stopping in Québec City arrive at the Port de
Québec’s new terminal (% 418-648-3640; www.portquebec.ca). It’s
located beside the Basse-Ville, but I suggest taking a taxi uphill to the
front of the Chateau Frontenac to start your visit. You can walk down 
on your way back.
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs up front, and, in the case
of the tamer tours, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can
take you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of
time with the least amount of hassle. Many escorted tours to Montréal
and Québec City also include other Canadian cities, such as Toronto and
Ottawa, or other regions, such as Eastern Canada.
Chapter 5: Getting to Montréal and Québec City 47

If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay up
front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour opera-
tor doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, you have no reason to believe that the operator will fulfill its insur-
ance obligations, either. Get travel insurance through an independent
agency. (I tell you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in
Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour company cancel 
the trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? What if the
tour group cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to 
fit 25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to
relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 at night sounds like a grind, cer-
tain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and may cancel the tour if it doesn’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close the tour
company is to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in
their answers, but the information may help you select a tour that’s
sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Choosing a Package Tour
Package tours are not the same thing as escorted tours. Package tours
are simply a way to buy airfare, accommodations, and other elements of
your vacation (such as car rentals and airport transfers). Some compa-
nies bundle every aspect of your trip, including tours to various sights.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
48

But most deal only with selected aspects, which allows you to get good
deals by putting together an airfare and hotel arrangement, say, or an
airfare and greens fee (golf) package. Packages tend to leave you a lot of
leeway, while saving you a lot of money.
Follow these tips for doing your due diligence and weeding out the pack-
agers that are duds:
 Do your homework. Read through this guide and decide what
attractions you want to visit and what type of accommodations you
think you’ll like. Compare the rack rates that I list in Chapters 9 and
17 against the discounted rates being offered by the packagers to
see whether you’re actually being given a substantial savings.
 Read the fine print. Make sure you know exactly what’s included 
in the price you’re being quoted and what’s not. Some packagers
include airfare plus lots of extra discounts on restaurants and activ-
ities, but others don’t even include airfare in the price.
 Know what you’re getting yourself into — and if you can get
yourself out. Before you commit to a package, make sure that you
know how much flexibility you have. Some packagers require non-
refundable binding commitments, whereas others charge minimal
fees for changes or cancellations. Ask about the packager’s restric-
tions and cancellations policies up front.
 Ask questions. If you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller
packager, check with the Better Business Bureau in the city where
the company is based, or go online to www.bbb.org. If a packager
won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
Finding escorted and package tours
How do you find these deals? Well, every city is different; the tour opera-
tors I mention may not offer deals convenient from your city. If that’s 
the case, check with local travel agents: They generally know the most
options close to home and know how best to put together escorted
tours and airline packages.
The travel section of your local Sunday paper lists many of the deals
available. Check ads in national travel magazines like Travel + Leisure,
National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler. Then call a few
escorted- or package-tour companies and ask them to send you their
brochures.
Big hotel chains and airlines also offer packages. If you already know
where you’d like to stay, call the hotel and ask if it offers land/air pack-
ages. Or contact the airlines themselves — most major airlines offer
air/land packages.
The online travel sites (Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and so on) also do
brisk business in package travel.
Chapter 5: Getting to Montréal and Québec City 49

Package deals to Montréal and Québec City
Some of the following companies offer both package and escorted tours.
Normally, a travel agent books these packages, but you can call or visit
the company Web sites on your own, too. Remember that some agencies
have better reputations than others; your travel agent, if you have one,
can guide you. Transportation to and from airports is often included but
is sometimes optional.
 Air Canada Vacations (% 800-254-1000; www.aircanada
vacations.com) is the largest carrier flying into Montréal. It 
offers lots of options for visiting both cities, separately or together,
including escorted tours, independent packages, fly/drive tours, 
ski holidays, and more. This is a great place to start.
 Collette Tours (% 800-340-5158; www.collettetours.com) offers
three-, four-, and five-day getaways to Québec City, Montréal, or
both cities, including accommodations, dinner at local restaurants,
and city tours. Longer city tours of Eastern Canada also offer stops
in Montréal and Québec City.
 Continental Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.
covacations.com) offers separate packages to Montréal and
Québec City, with hotel and airfare included and car rental
optional. This is a good option if you like fancy hotels, because 
its packages include accommodations in upscale hotels.
 Gogo Worldwide Vacations (% 800-299-2999 or 702-457-1615;
www.gogowwv.com) offers two- or three-night stays in Montréal and
Québec City and cruises that pass through one or both ports. The
short-stay packages do not include airfare, but they offer a good
choice of hotels. Most of the packages are targeted to specific
tastes and preferences, including casino admission, sightseeing,
and admission to historical and cultural attractions, depending on
what you’re into. This company accepts reservations from U.S. and
Canadian travel agents only.
 Yankee Holidays (% 800-225-2550 or 978-922-4819; www.yankee-
holidays.com) offers vacation packages of mainly the two-day/
three-night variety to both cities. Packages are targeted toward spe-
cific interests and can include museum passes, show tickets, gour-
met meals, sightseeing tours, and festival admissions. The activity
options are more limited in Québec City. Airfare is not included.

Needs or Interests
In This Chapter
 Surviving the trip with your pint-sized travelers
 Savoring refined pleasures if you’re a senior traveler
 Overcoming disabilities on the road
 Living it up in gay Québec
M
ontréal and Québec City are about as open-minded and welcom-
ing as cities get. The fun factor is spread out across all groups,
whether you’re traveling with a family, you qualify for senior discounts,
you travel with a disability, or you’re a gay or lesbian traveler.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Montréal is a safe, clean, relatively inexpensive city full of fun things 
for kids to do. While Québec City is hardly Disney World, you can find
plenty of activities and sights that interest kids, and the city is well
organized to accommodate families.
Here are a few tips to keep in mind when you’re planning your kid-friendly
trip:
 Find out what your kids want to do. Look for kid-friendly activities
before you travel, and let the kids get in on the action by having
them check Web sites, read brochures, and, well, dream of adven-
tures to come.
 Surf the Web for ideas. Check out www.montreal.com for lists of
kids’ activities. The Montréal-based site www.yikeskids.com has
an “Ask the Experts” link, where you can ask a local expert about
entertaining little ones. Québec City’s tourism site (www.quebec
region.com) doesn’t have a specific kids section, but ask your kids
to let you know what appeals to them.

 Play up the history. From bayonets and epic battles to fancy frocks
and horse-drawn carriages, Montréal and Québec City have plenty
of historical aspects that set kids’ imaginations on fire.
 Locate kid-friendly establishments. Throughout this book, I iden-
tify kid-friendly hotels, restaurants, and attractions with the Kid
Friendly icon.
 Visit tourism centers. In Montréal, the Infotouriste Centre is down-
town at 1000 Square-Dorchester (% 800-266-5687 or 514-873-2015).
In Québec City, the Bureau d’information touristique is in the Old
City at 835 av. Wilfrid-Laurier (% 418-649-2608). Both centers dis-
tribute free Official Tourist Guides with special sections on activi-
ties for kids.
 Have a Plan B. As far as the weather goes, the only certainty is
uncertainty. Abrupt rain cancellations can definitely send kids into
a tailspin, so plan activities for rain, shine, heat, and cold. Plan
indoor activities, like museums, on rainy days, for relief from the
cold in winter, or when you need to avoid the noonday heat in
summer. Outdoor activities, such as inline skating or amusement
parks, are best in late afternoon or early evening.
 Have a little talk about language before you leave. Older kids may
be miffed when they don’t understand what people around them
are saying. Explain that most people in Québec speak French, and
teach them a few words. Bonjour and au revoir will probably do (or
check out the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book). You can turn it
into a game and pick up a few words yourself.
Traveling with kids can be a riot, but sometimes it actually turns into
one. If you want to leave the kids behind for a day — in trustworthy
hands — some hotels offer babysitting services. Ask at the front desk.
The Montréal YMCA, downtown on rue Stanley, offers educational day
care for kids 18 months to 5 years (% 514-849-8393; www.ymca.ca).
The books Family Travel (Lanier Publishing International) and How to
Take Great Trips with Your Kids (The Harvard Common Press) are full of
good general advice that can apply to travel anywhere. Another reliable
tome with a worldwide focus is Adventuring with Children (Foghorn Press).
You can also check out Family Travel Times, published six times a year by
Travel with Your Children, 40 Fifth Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY 10011 
(% 888-822-4FTT or 212-477-5524; www.familytraveltimes.com). It
includes a weekly call-in service for subscribers. Subscriptions are 
US$39 a year. A free publication list and a sample issue are available 
upon request.
Familyhostel (% 800-733-9753; www.learn.unh.edu/familyhostel)
takes the whole family, including the kids ages 8 to 15, on moderately
priced international learning vacations, with lectures, field trips, and
sightseeing guided by a team of academics.

directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Montréal and Québec City are both great cities for refined pleasures like
fine dining and visiting museums and galleries. And, of course, if you’re
not in the mood for culture, you can always head to the Montréal Casino.
Several Canadian tour companies offer organized holidays for seniors. In
Montréal, Prométour Cultural Tours is located in Vieux-Montréal (% 514-
848-0766). In Québec City, Groupe Voyages Québec is located right in the
thick of it on Grande Allée (% 800-463-1598 or 418-525-4585).
If you need help or advice finding senior services, contact the Fédération
de l’age d’or du Québec (Québec Golden Age Federation) in Montréal
(% 514-252-3154).
Most attractions in the city offer senior discounts, as do public trans-
portation and movie theaters. Members of AARP (formerly the American
Association of Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 
(% 888-687-2277 or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on
hotels, airfares, and car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of
benefits, including AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter.
Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the over-50 market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those aged 55 and over (and a spouse or companion of 
any age) in the United States and in more that 80 countries around the
world. Most courses last five to seven days in the United States (two to
four weeks abroad), and may include airfare, accommodation in univer-
sity dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition. ElderTreks (% 800-
741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group tours to off-the-
beaten-path adventure-travel locations, restricted to travelers 50 and
older. INTRAV (% 800-456-8100; wwwintrav.com) is a high-end tour
operator that caters to the mature, discerning traveler—not specifically
for seniors—with trips around the world that include guided safaris,
polar expeditions, private-jet adventures, and small-boat cruises down
jungle rivers.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures

Advice for Travelers with Disabilities
Canada is a world leader in promoting the rights of people with disabili-
ties. If you or someone in your party is traveling with a disability, you
can find loads of resources and services to make your trip as hassle-free
and fun as possible.
Worldwide resources
Check out A World of Options, a 658-page book with resources for disabled
travelers. It is available from Mobility International USA, P.O. Box 19767,
Eugene, OR 97440 (% 541-343-1284 voice and TTY; www.miusa.org).
Visit the Web site of Access-Able Travel Source (www.access-able.com),
which provides names and addresses of travel agents who specialize in
disabled travel, as well as information on accessible destinations around
the world. The Web site www.disabilitytravelexperts.com also has
recommendations.
Vision-impaired travelers should contact the American Foundation for
the Blind, 11 Penn Plaza, Suite 300, New York, NY 10001 (% 800-232-
5463).
Canadian resources
While visiting Montréal and Québec City, you may also seek the support
of or information from these national sources:
 Abilities Magazine is Canada’s best magazine on disability
lifestyle issues. The magazine’s Web site (www.enablelink.org)
offers links to a wide range of services in Canada for persons with
disabilities.
 The Active Living Alliance for Canadians with a Disability can
direct you to resources and services in Canada (% 800-771-0663 or
613-244-0052).
Local resources
The best resource for accessible travel in Québec is an organization
called Kéroul. Check out its tourism guide, Accessible Québec, for lists 
of accessible attractions. The group also provides travel packages for
travelers with disabilities and a database of accessible places in the
province (% 514-252-3104; www.keroul.qc.ca).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
54

Québec’s Recreation Association for People with Disabilities (Associa-
tion Québécoise pour le Loisir des Personnes Handicappées) also
provides information on accessible leisure activities (% 514-252-3144;
www.aqlph.qc.ca).
Most large hotels in both cities have some accessible rooms, so call
around. The Hyatt Regency Montréal (formerly the Wyndam Hotel),
1255 Jeanne-Mance (% 514-285-1450), in downtown Montréal, provides
information on its facilities for disabled travelers.
Also consider:
 Montréal Association for the Blind (% 514-488-0043).
 Office for Persons with Disabilities (Montréal: % 888-873-3905;
Québec City: % 800-567-1465).
 West Island Association for the Intellectually Handicapped
(% 514-694-7722).
 Québec Society for Disabled Children (% 514-937-6171).
 Access to Travel (www.accesstotravel.gc.ca): This organization
provides information on wheelchair-accessible transport in Québec.
Support while traveling to either city
In this section, I include the organizations to call while traveling to and
from Montréal and Québec City:
 Air Canada (% 899-247-2262) and Air Transat (% 877-872-6782)
offer wheelchair-accessible service.
 Greyhound (% 800-661-8747) and Orléans Express (% 514-395-

and Québec City.
 Via Rail offers wheelchair-accessible service on some of its routes,
but you have to reserve in advance (% 888-842-7245).
Support while traveling within cities
Montréal’s transit commission has 456 low-floor, wheelchair-accessible
buses on over 40 routes in the city (% 514-280-5100). Despite the good
intentions of the public-transport system, however, the buses are not
actually that accessible, especially during peak periods.
Paratransit in Montréal offers free wheelchair-accessible minivan 
service, but you have to apply for the right to use it (% 514-280-8211).
You can get the application from its Web site at www.stcum.qc.ca/
English/t-adapte/a-index.htm. Apply two months in advance. For
wheelchair-accessible taxis, call Taxi Boisjoli (% 514-255-2815).
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 55

In Québec City, Paratransit (% 418-687-2641) also offers free wheelchair-
accessible minibus service, but, as in Montréal, you need to reserve in
advance. Call several days before your departure to register for services.
Note that these are public transportation services, and you may wait up
to eight hours for your minibus.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers extensive

and Hospitality) (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org; annual membership
fees: US$45 adults, US$30 seniors and students), which offers a wealth of
travel resources for all types of disabilities and informed recommenda-
tions on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehi-
cle rentals, and companion services; and the American Foundation for
the Blind (AFB) (% 800-232-5463; www.afb.org), a referral resource for

Out and About: Advice for Gay 
and Lesbian Travelers
Québeckers have an extremely tolerant attitude toward gay and lesbian
travelers. This is a country where gays and lesbians can legally marry,
after all. The gay community in Montréal is one of the largest in the
world, and the city even has its own Gay Chamber of Commerce and a
Gay Village Merchants Association. For a list of gaycentric activities,
events, and accommodations, go to www.montrealplus.ca. In Québec
City, you find fewer services and resources for the gay and lesbian com-
munities, but that’s because it’s a smaller city, not because people are
uptight.

The Montréal scene
According to Tourism Québec, Montréal’s gay tourism industry is the
third biggest draw to the city, after the Grand Prix and the Jazz Festival.
With its circuit of bars, clubs, restaurants, boutiques, antiques shops,
discos, bathhouses, and more, there’s plenty of action. Montréal’s Gay
Village runs along rue Ste-Catherine between rue Berri and rue Papineau,
in gritty-but-vibrant south-central downtown.
Places to stay
Gay Village offers plenty of gay-friendly hotels and inns. For lesbians,
there’s Pension Vallières, 6562 rue de Lorimier (% 514-729-9552), an all-
women hotel. For men, there’s the Auberge Cosy, 1274 rue Ste-Catherine
Est (% 514-525-2151; www.aubergecosy.com), Bed & Breakfast du
Village, 1281 rue Montcalm (% 888-228-8455 or 514-522-4771; www.bbv.
qc.ca), or Le Chasseur B&B, 1567 rue St-André (% 514-521-2238; www.
lechasseur.com).
Places to eat
Gay Village also has no shortage of great restaurants. I recommend Area,
1429 rue Amherst (% 514-890-6691), for fine French cuisine, and Bazou,
1310 bd. de Maisonneuve Est (% 514-526-4940), for refined fare in a
quirky “haute” flea-market setting, where you can bring your own wine.
Check out La Piazetta, 1101 rue Ste-Catherine Est (% 514-526-2244), for
good thin-crust pizza.
Bars and clubs
The hot spots of the moment in the Gay Village are Unity II, 1171 rue Ste-
Catherine Est (% 514-529-6969); Club Parking, 1296 Amherst (% 514-
282-1199); and Stereo, 858 rue Ste-Catherine Est (% 514-286-0300),
which opens late and carries on until the next morning. You can also find
dozens of clubs and bars just by walking around the Village at night.
Special events
The big yearly events in the gay and lesbian community are Montréal’s
Gay Pride Parade (% 514-285-4011; www.diverscite.org/anglais/
index.htm), which takes place at the beginning of August; the gay and
lesbian film festival, Image+Nation (www.image-nation.org), in
September; and the Black and Blue Festival (www.bbcm.org), the
world’s largest gay and lesbian benefit event, in October.
The Québec City scene
In Québec City, the gay community is centered on rue St-Jean, between
rue Dufferin and rue St-Augustin, just outside the walls of the Old City.
For accommodations, the most famous inn is Le 253, 253 rue de la Reine
(% 418-647-0590). Other good options are Le Coureur des Bois, 15 rue
Ste-Ursule (% 418-692-1117), and Guest House 727, 727 rue d’Aiguillon
(% 418-648-6766).

know before you leave.
Getting a Passport
In this day and age, a valid passport is best when traveling to interna-
tional destinations. Having one means that you can pick up and go at 
a moment’s notice, which is really exciting, very jet-set. What’s more,
some airlines now require you to present a valid passport at check-in for
international flights — which goes above and beyond the actual entry
requirements.
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. In most cases, you can’t cross an international border without
one. Until December 31, 2007, Americans don’t need a passport to come
to Canada — still Canadian border officials strongly recommend having
one (and starting 2008, they’ll be required). Otherwise, you will need
proof of citizenship and a government-issued photo ID, such as a birth
certificate and driver’s license combo. If you’re not a U.S. citizen, but are
a permanent resident of the United States, bring your green card.
Getting a passport is easy, but the process takes some time. For an up-
to-date country-by-country listing of passport requirements around 
the world, go to the “Foreign Entry Requirements” Web page of the U.S.
Department of State at http://travel.state.gov/visa/americans1.
html.

Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office. To find
your regional passport office, either check the U.S. Department of
State Web site, http://travel.state.gov, or call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated
information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship. (Bringing
along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social Security
card also is a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2 x 2 inches
in size. You often find businesses that take these photos near a pass-
port office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine
because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and older, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs US$97. For those 15 and younger, a passport is valid for
five years and costs US$82.

Dealing with a lost passport
Always pack a photocopy of the inside photo page of your passport separate from
your wallet or purse. In the event your passport is lost or stolen, the photocopy can
help speed up the replacement process. While traveling in a group, never let one
person carry all the passports. If the passports are stolen, obtaining new ones can be
much more difficult, because at least one person in the group needs to be able to prove
his or her identity so the others can be identified.
If you’re a U.S. citizen and you either lose your passport or have it stolen, go to the
Consulate General of the United States of America, 1155 rue St-Alexandre, Montréal
(% 514-398-9695; http://montreal.usconsulate.gov). Australians need to
contact the Australian High Commission, in Ottawa (% 888-990-8888 or 613-236-0841;
www.ahc-ottawa.org). New Zealanders should contact the New Zealand High
Commission, also in Ottawa (% 613-238-5991; www.nzembassy.com/canada).
U.K citizens should contact the British Consulate-General, 1000 rue De La Gauchetière
Ouest, Suite 4200, Montréal (% 514-866-5863; www.britainincanada.com). In
Québec City, an Honorary Consulate, Le Complexe St-Amable, 1150 Claire-Fontaine,
Suite 700 (% 418-521-3000; www.britainincanada.com), provides a more lim-
ited array of services for British Nationals, but it is still the first call to make upon losing
your passport in Québec City.

Make sure that you allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a
passport; processing normally takes three weeks, but it can take longer
during busy periods (especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name and issued within the past
15 years (and you were older than 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $67. Whether you’re applying in person
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S.
Department of State Web site at http://travel.state.gov. For gen-
eral information, call the National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518).
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. Department
of State Web site or call the National Passport Information Center’s toll-
free number (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia, New
Zealand, and the United Kingdom:
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how
and where to apply.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download one from its Web site. For
information, contact the Passports Office (% 0800-225-050 toll-
free in New Zealand or 04-474-8100; www.passports.govt.nz).
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 61
Traveling with minors
Having plenty of documentation always is wise when traveling with children in today’s
world. Keep up to date on details of the changing entry requirements for children trav-
eling abroad by going to the U.S. Department of State Web site (http://travel.
state.gov/visa/americans1.html).
To prevent international child abduction, governments in some countries require doc-
umented evidence of your relationship with your children and permission for their
travel from any parent or legal guardian who isn’t present. Having such documenta-
tion in hand, even if not required, facilitates entries and exits. All children must have
their own passports. To obtain a passport, the child must be present — that is, in
person — at the center issuing the passport. Both parents must be present as well if
the child is younger than 14. If one or both parents cannot be present, then a notarized
statement from the absent parent is required.
For more information about passport requirements for your children, call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) Monday to Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. east-
ern standard time.

 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children younger than 16)
at passport offices or travel agencies. For information, contact the
United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410; www.ukpa.
gov.uk).
Renting a Car — and Understanding 
Why You Shouldn’t
If you plan to spend most of your time visiting Montréal within city
limits, a car is probably more trouble than it’s worth. In Québec City,
driving is even less advisable. And Vieux-Québec is so small that you 
can walk anywhere you want to go.
Parking in either city can be tough. Although you find lots of metered
parking in downtown areas, competition for those spaces is fierce. In
Montréal’s residential neighborhoods, a system of reserved parking
zones still has many locals baffled; you get the added handicap of trying
to figure out the signs in French. To get out of the downtown core of
Montréal, take the subway (known as the Métro) or any number of bus
lines. Ask for a public transportation map at your hotel or at the ticket
booth of any Métro station. You can also easily flag taxis in both cities.
Still want to drive? Well, the truth is, finding your way around Montréal
is easy in a car, and renting one is a snap (see the appendix for agencies
in both cities). Just remember that traffic signs are in French. Some
other peculiarities to keep in mind are as follows:
 It’s legal to turn right on a red light everywhere in Québec except in
Montréal.
 At many lights in both cities, the greens start out as green pointing
arrows. For their duration, you can travel through the intersection
only in the directions they are pointing.
 Gas is more expensive in Canada than the United States. You’ll pay
around C$50 (US$42.50) to fill the tank of a midsize car.
Finding the car you need at the price you want
The rates at most major car rental companies are about the same in
both cities, but the rates among local competitors can vary some. The
following tips may help you save a significant amount of money:
 Weekend rates are cheaper. This may mean picking up the car
Thursday afternoon or Friday morning and returning it Monday
morning. If you rent for five days or more, the daily rate is cheaper.
 Drop-off charges may apply. There’s often a fee for returning the
car to a different location than where you rented it. Allegedly,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
62

they’re the ones who have to drive it back. Ask if this is the case
when you’re shopping around.
 At the airport, check if the rates are cheaper downtown. There
may be a difference at some car rental agencies between the rates
they offer at the airport and those at other locations. Investigate
whether this is the case and whether you can save by picking up
your vehicle downtown.
 Mention who you are. Be up front about the fact that you have a
membership with AAA, AARP, a trade union, professional associa-
tion, or anything else that may seem relevant. It could land you dis-
counts ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Often, frequent-flier programs
offer discounts with certain car rental companies. In addition, most
car rentals add 500 miles to your account.
 Check your car-insurance policy at home. You’re probably insured
for rental cars, so you don’t need to buy extra insurance when you
rent — just make sure you take your policy number with you.
 Shop around. Even within one company, rates vary between agen-
cies. Rates are higher during the tourist season (May–Sept). Local
rental agencies may offer better rates than national chains. Ask at
the front desk of your hotel.
 Estimate your driving distance. When you rent, the rates for unlim-
ited mileage are higher. Plan where you’re going — if your mileage
will be low, don’t pay any extra for unlimited mileage.
Using the Internet to find deals
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can make
comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier. You can check rates
at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. (Double-check to make sure
you are on the Canadian [.ca] versions of the car-rental company’s Web
site.) Plus, all the major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.
com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), for example — have search
engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just enter the car
size you want, the pickup and return dates, and the location, and the
engine returns a price. You can even make the reservation through any
of these sites.
Understanding additional charges
In addition to the standard rental prices (C$30–C$50/US$25.50–US$42.50
a day in Montréal and Québec City), other optional charges, discussed in
the two following sections, can add up.
The Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for
damage to the car in a collision, costs up to US$15 a day. Many credit-
card companies cover this fee; ask your credit card company before you
sign up.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 63

Car rental companies also offer liability insurance (if you harm others in
an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm yourself or your
passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your possessions are
stolen from the car). Your car insurance policy at home probably covers
these situations as well, so check before you leave. You can probably
safely skip the personal effects insurance (unless you’re driving around
with a stack of CDs, which petty thieves in Montréal love to steal), but
you should definitely be covered for harm to yourself and others.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for
your initial full tank of gas up front and can return the car with an empty
gas tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you
don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this
option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car
with a full tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a gallon (C$1 per liter) for any
shortfall. If you usually run late, and a fueling stop may make you miss
your plane, you’re a perfect candidate for this refueling option.
Taxes on purchases are steep in Québec. The General Sales Tax (on 
your bill, in French, this shows up as the TPS) is 7 percent. Then, the
Provincial Sales Tax (TVQ) is 7.5 percent. Québec squeezes an extra bit
of provincial sales tax out of each purchase by calculating the TVQ on
the total of the original price plus the TPS. I’m not sure how they get
away with it, but no one seems to complain.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here’s my advice on all
three.
Trip-cancellation insurance
Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you have
to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your travel sup-
plier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can range from
sickness to natural disasters to the U.S. Department of State declaring
your destination unsafe for travel.
A good resource is Travel Guard Alerts, which supplies a list of compa-
nies considered high risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
guard.com). Protect yourself further by paying for your trip with a
credit card. By law, consumers can get their money back on goods and
services not received if they report the loss within 60 days after the
charge is listed on their credit-card statement.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
64

Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to remote or
high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip or can arrange
insurance policies through a partnering provider, a convenient and often
cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain insurance. Make sure the
tour company is a reputable one. Some experts suggest you avoid
buying insurance from the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with.
They say buying from a third-party insurer is better than putting all your
money in one place.
Medical insurance
For international travel, most medical-insurance health plans (including
Medicare and Medicaid) don’t provide coverage, and the ones that do
often require you to pay for services up front, reimbursing you only after
you return home. Even if your plan covers overseas treatment, most out-
of-country hospitals make you pay your bills up front and send you a
refund only after you’ve returned home and filed the necessary paper-
work with your insurance company. As a safety net, you may want to
buy travel medical insurance, particularly if you’re traveling to a remote
or high-risk area where emergency evacuation is a possible scenario. 
If you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance
(% 888-MEDEX-00; www.medexassist.com), Travel Assistance
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com), or
Worldwide Assistance Services, Inc. (% 800-777-8710; www.world
wideassistance.com).
Lost-luggage insurance
Lost-luggage insurance isn’t necessary for most travelers. On domestic
flights, checked baggage is covered up to US$2,500 per ticketed passen-
ger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of international
trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately US$9.07 per pound,
up to approximately US$635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
more valuable than the standard liability, see if your homeowner’s policy
covers your valuables, get baggage insurance as part of your compre-
hensive travel-insurance package, or buy Travel Guard’s “Bag Trak”
product. Don’t buy insurance at the airport — it’s usually overpriced. 
Be sure to take any valuable or irreplaceable items with you in your
carry-on luggage because many valuables (including books, money, 
and electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the airport
detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must report delayed,
damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The airlines are
required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your house or destina-
tion free of charge.

ers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com),

Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.
com), or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.
travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it, of
course.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour 
hot line.
Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT) (% 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries
you’re visiting, and lists of local, English-speaking doctors.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-
311-3435; www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health 
hazards by region or country and offers tips on food safety.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
Just because your cellphone works at home, doesn’t mean it will work
elsewhere on the continent — due to North America’s fragmented cell-
phone system. Canadian cellphone networks support the following stan-
dards: GSM, TDMA, and CDMA. Chances are, if you’re in a city and your
phone’s compatible, you’ll pick up a signal.
If you’re not from North America, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach of
the GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used by
much of the world. Your phone will probably work in most major cities,
but it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. And you may or may 
not be able to send text messages home — something North Americans
do less of anyway for various cultural and technological reasons.
(International travelers like to send text messages home because it’s
much cheaper than making overseas calls.)
Some cellphone companies offer an “international roaming” package
that reduces the per-minute rate of your calls while abroad. Savings
range between 25 and 50 percent. Of course, this feature comes at a
price, a monthly fee on your bill. It’s usually under $5, and you can
remove it from your plan upon your return. Depending on whether your
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
66

phone will work and how much you actually plan to use it while travel-
ing, temporarily opting in for this feature could be a worthwhile move.
Assume nothing. Call your cellphone provider to get the full scoop on
picking up a signal, current rates, and possible discounts.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. (Even world-phone owners
have to rent new phones whenever they’re traveling to non-GSM
regions.) Although you can rent a phone from any number of usual spots
in foreign countries, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental agen-
cies, consider renting the phone before you leave home. That way, you
can give loved ones and business associates your new number, make
sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever you go. Phone
rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus airtime
fees of at least a dollar a minute.
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-290-1606;
www.intouchusa.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1601 or 905-272-5665;
www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll tell you what
wireless products you need.
Travelers have any number of ways to check their E-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, 
you can still access your E-mail, and even your office computer, from
cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although no definitive directory exists for cybercafes — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer you can use to get to the Internet. And most public
libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small
charge. Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbi-
tant rates.
Most major airports have Internet kiosks scattered throughout their
gates. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping malls, hotel lob-
bies, and tourist information offices around the world, give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. The clunkiness and high price mean these kiosks should be a 
last resort.
To retrieve your E-mail, ask you Internet service provider (ISP) whether
it has a Web-based interface tied to your existing E-mail account. If your
ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web serv-
ice (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home E-mail. For
more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based E-mail account
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your E-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has
an always-on connection to the Internet. The service offers top-quality
security, but if you’re worried about hackers, use your own laptop
rather than a cybercafe computer to access the GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer access
to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more and more
hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless “hotspots” where
you can get a high-speed connection without cable wires, networking
hardware, or a phone line. You can get a Wi-Fi connection one of several
ways. Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in Wi-Fi capability (an
802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners have their own net-
working technology called Apple AirPort. For those with older comput-
ers, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be plugged into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and
coffee shops. T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves
up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee shops 
in the United States. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.
wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel 
lobbies. IPass providers also give you access to a few hundred wireless
hotel-lobby setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four
Seasons to use the hotel’s network — just set yourself up on a nice
couch in the lobby. The companies’ pricing policies can be complex,
with a variety of monthly per-connection and per-minute plans, but in
general, you pay around $30 a month for limited access — and as many
more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to
get even more competitive.
You can also find places that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personal
telco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi isn’t available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and a good
number now offer free high-speed Internet access using an Ethernet net-
work cable. You can bring your own cables, but most hotels rent them
from around $10. Call your hotel in advance to see what your options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
enabling you to go online simply by placing a local call. Check your ISP’s

Web site or call its toll-free number, and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home and how much it will cost. If you’re travel-
ing outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has a dial-up number
in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass
provider, which then tells you how to set up your computer for your
destination. For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click
“Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209
or 920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — 
or find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight. If you show up late, alert an 
airline employee and he’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID ready to show at check-in, the security check-
point, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 don’t need 
government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for inter-
national flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using the airport’s electronic kiosks or even online check-in
from a home computer. Online check-in involves logging on to your air-
line’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out your board-
ing pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so. If
you’re using an airport kiosk, bring the credit card you used to book the
ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your boarding pass from the
kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint with your pass and
a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-row seat,
you will be able to do so from most airline kiosks. Even the smaller air-
lines are employing the kiosk system, but always call your airline to
make sure these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is also a
good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-
in; again, call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter, but some doozies still
remain. If you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an air-
line employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by
not wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got metal-
lic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat with
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

security screeners. Keep in mind, only ticketed passengers are allowed
past security except for folks escorting disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay, and
food and beverages must be passed through the X-ray machine — 
however, security screeners can’t make you drink from your coffee cup.
Bring food in your carryon rather than checking it because explosive-
detection machines used on checked luggage have been known to mistake
food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the
United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item” such as
a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still
considered a personal item. The TSA has issued a list of restricted items;
check its Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp) for details.
Look for Travel Sentry certified luggage locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage
inspectors with a special code or key. For more information on the locks
visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.
Making Dinner Reservations in Advance
If you’re counting on attending any of the big shows at festivals — 
particularly the Jazz Festival or the Just for Laughs Festival — 
purchase your tickets in advance. In the summer, try to book your room
at least several weeks in advance — on the weekend of Montréal’s Gay
Pride Parade (early Aug), for example, there isn’t a room to be had in
town. The following sections give you some tips for advance planning.
Surfing ahead of time
The Web is the best and cheapest way to find out what’s going on in
Montréal and Québec City, make reservations, and buy tickets before
you leave home. Here are my favorite sources for Montréal:
 Events: To find out what’s going on in Montréal, visit the Montréal
Plus Web site (www.montreal-plus.com) or Tourism Montréal
(www.tourism-montreal.org).
 Sports: Get schedules and reserve tickets for Montréal Alouettes,
Canadiens, or Impact, through the Admission Network (www.
admission.com).
 Entertainment: The best sources are the sites of Montréal’s weekly
cultural magazines, the Montréal Mirror (www.montrealmirror.
com) and Hour (www.hour.ca), and Montréal’s English-language
daily paper, The Gazette (www.montrealgazette.com).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Montréal and Québec City 
70

And for Québec City:
 Culture: Voir (voir.ca) is a free weekly cultural magazine, with a
Québec City edition. The site covers special events and concerts,
as well as film and dining.
 A little bit of everything: Québec Plus (www.quebecplus.ca),
operated by the phone company’s Internet arm, has directories of
entertainment, accommodations, shopping, dining, and nightlife,
bolstered with profiles and seasonal features. Bonjour Québec
(www.bonjourquebec.com), operated by the Province’s Ministry of
Tourism, contains pages on the entire province but has a section
devoted to Québec City and the surrounding area. Québec City’s
official site, www.quebecregion.com, is run by the Québec City
and Area Tourism and Convention Bureau.
Reserving a table for dinner
Québeckers eat late. In the summer, restaurants in Montréal and Québec
City fill up at 9 p.m. and serve until 11 p.m. or later. If you want to be 
in the thick of the eating action, don’t make dinner reservations before
7:30 p.m. On the flip side, if you want to get a table at a popular restaurant
at the last minute, tables are almost always available at 6 p.m. or earlier.
Weekends are the only time you have trouble making same-day reserva-
tions at most restaurants. In Chapters 10 and 18, I tell you which restau-
rants require reservations. If all my suggestions are booked, don’t despair.
Ask for alternatives at the front desk of your hotel. Neither city suffers
from a shortage of culinary choices.
Getting a Few Packing Tips
Think you can visit Montréal and Québec City in a sweat suit and sneak-
ers? Think again. Both cities are slightly more stylish and formal than
the North American norm; you really won’t feel comfortable walking
around in a jogging suit. Make sure you have at least a decent pair of
slacks, a nice shirt, and clean shoes.
After you set your style standards, think practically. The weather is
always unpredictable, so make sure you have at least one warm sweater,
plus sunscreen, a sun hat, and an umbrella. For winter, bring a warm
coat, mitts, hats, gloves, and boots — sorry, there’s no way around it.
Travel lightly. I know I just told you to be stylish and prepare for rain or
shine, but don’t break your back over it. One large, preferably wheeled,
suitcase and a carry-on bag is the way to go.
What not to bring
You probably don’t need formalwear, so don’t bog down your bags 
with fancy suits or satin pumps. For women, one dressy — preferably a
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71

knit — outfit will do. For men, one jacket and tie combo will suffice. The
best idea is always to have something versatile.
What to bring
Your airline can tell you how much luggage you can bring. Usually you
are allowed to check two pieces and carry one small bag with you, but
many charter airlines allow only one checked piece of luggage and a
carry-on bag. Airlines have become fairly strict about baggage limita-
tions in the last couple of years, so if you plan to take a lot with you, call
the airline for specific weight and size limitations. You don’t want any
unpleasant surprises at check-in.
Your carry-on bag should contain whatever you can’t afford to lose, and
whatever you need to get by for a day in case your luggage gets lost (if
they lose your bag, most airlines locate it quickly). Return tickets, vital
documents, toiletries, an extra pair of underwear, something to read, a
small bottle of water, and a light sweater or jacket does the trick.
Don’t pack any sharp objects (scissors, tweezers, and so on) in your
carry-on bag. These items are strictly prohibited. Pack them in your
checked luggage, instead, or leave them at home.
In addition, think about the following when packing:
 Leave your new shoes at home. Even if your old ones are a little
scuffed, you’ll be far happier walking around in them instead of
nursing bruises and blisters.
 Find a color scheme. When packing, choose colors that comple-
ment each other. Black, white, gray, and navy work wonders, as do
beige and brown. Remember: Most of the people who see you
while traveling will probably never see you again.
 Stick to knits. They don’t wrinkle. Leave your linen shirts at home.
They’re not worth it.
 Bring along a little laundry soap. A small bottle of laundry deter-
gent weighs a lot less than those three extra shirts you were going
to bring along just in case you dribble truffle juice down your
collar. Do a little hand washing in the hotel sink.
 Save up small bottles. Pour into them only as much shampoo or
shower gel as you need for your stay. You won’t believe how much
space and weight you save. Pharmacies also sell miniature travel
versions of everything from toothpaste to hand cream.
 Find an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka-dot . . . umbrella.
These days they make umbrellas that practically fit into your fist.
An umbrella is a must for any trip to Montréal or Québec City; a
compact version takes some weight off your shoulders.

Settling Into and
Exploring Montréal

Montréal and guide you through its highlights, its best
hotels and restaurants, and its hottest attractions. You can
follow one of my itineraries for visiting the city on foot. And
in case you want to swap urban landscapes for mountains,
lakes, and rivers, I offer a few recommended daytrips around
Montréal.

M
ontréal is an island with a mountain in the middle. Well, sort of.
Mont Royal is a 761-foot-high hill, topped by a crucifix, that every-
one calls “the Mountain.” It looms large over several Montréal neighbor-
hoods. And unless you’re near the water, like in Vieux-Montréal, it’s 
not obvious that you’re on an island in the mighty St. Lawrence River.
Suburban Montréalers who creep over the bridges and snake through 
the tunnels on their daily commutes never forget it, though. This chapter
explains how to get to Montréal and how to get around after you arrive.
Navigating Your Way through 
Passport Control and Customs
Canadians are such welcoming folks. We’re well known for being particu-
larly nice, saying “sorry” all the time, and, generally, not wanting to offend.
Our Customs officials, thankfully, are sterner individuals, charged with
protecting our borders. The drill here, as at any border crossing, is to
answer the officer’s questions: no more, no less. If you think about it, this
usually brief exchange just before beginning your vacation is like the
opposite of a job interview, but you should treat it seriously just the same.
Customs officers usually ask where you’re from, how long you plan to
stay, and maybe, whether you have anything to declare. Your answer to
this last question is “no,” unless you’re importing goods or an incredibly
large sum of cash. Just answer politely and don’t take the interrogation
personally.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented in Montréal 77

In this day and age, you should really have a valid passport for any inter-
national travel. See Chapter 7 for how to go about getting one.
However, U.S. citizens and permanent residents don’t require passports
or visas to enter Canada. Americans can provide proof of citizenship and
a government-issued photo ID (a citizenship or naturalization card, or a
birth certificate with a valid photo identification, like a driver’s license).
If you’re not a U.S. citizen, but are a permanent resident of the United
States, also bring your green card.
All other foreign travelers visiting Canada need at least a passport —
and maybe a visa. Before you go, find out what you need to enter Canada
by visiting the Canada Border Services Agency Web site at www.
cbsa-asfc.gc.ca.
See Chapter 12 for Customs regulations regarding how much loot you
can take home.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
After you make it through Customs (see the preceding section), you’re
almost there. Now you have to drop your bags where you’ll be staying. A
good, hot shower can be worth several hours of sleep for weary travelers.
Changing your socks is the next best thing. (Don’t believe me? Try it.)
Depending on how you traveled to Montréal, these are the different
options for finding your way downtown to your hotel room. After you’re
settled, your visit can begin.
If you arrive by plane
You will arrive at Montréal’s recently renovated and renamed Pierre
Elliott Trudeau International Airport (% 800-465-1213 or 514-394-7377;
www.admtl.com), formerly known as Dorval. After clearing Customs and
claiming your checked baggage, you may want to exchange money. A
currency exchange counter, open between 4:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., and
a 24-hour ATM are located on the Arrivals level of the airport — which is
where you’ll be. Car-rental agencies are also located at this level, but you
have plenty of other ways to get downtown.
Getting to your hotel by taxi
Taxis and limousines are available curbside, immediately upon exiting
the Arrivals level of the terminal. Airport limousines are not the stretch
brand favored by Paris Hilton and Co., but black, tinted-window, leather-
interior sedans of the type used for whisking around international digni-
taries. The cabs are metered, and a trip downtown costs about C$30
(US$26); limousines charge a flat fee of C$70 (US$60) plus tip (10 to 
15 percent is customary) from Trudeau.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
78

Getting to your hotel by shuttle
The Aérobus (% 514-399-9877) is a shuttle bus that runs frequently
between the airport and downtown. This is the best value for getting
downtown as quickly and hassle-free as possible, at C$12 (US$10) from
Trudeau. However the coach service isn’t door to door. It makes two
stops, first downtown at 777 rue de la Gauchetière, behind the
Fairmount Queen Elizabeth Hotel, and then at Montréal’s bus station,
Station Central, in the Quartier Latin, adjacent to the Berri-UQAM Métro
stop. From de la Gauchetière, a free minivan takes travelers to any hotel.
If you’re not staying in a hotel, you may try asking for a lift anyway.
You’re bending the rules, but it’s worth a try.
Getting to your hotel by public transportation
For a mere C$2.50 (US$2.25) you can get downtown by public trans-
portation, but it’s a bit of a schlep, requiring two buses and a subway
(Métro) ride. To me, it’s worth the extra bucks for the shuttle, especially
if you have lots of luggage. If you arrive with only a carry-on bag, how-
ever, you can save some money going this route. Catch the city-bound
bus No. 204 on the island across the first lane of traffic on the lower level
in front of the terminal. It takes you on a short ride to Dorval Station,
where you transfer to a second bus, No. 211, that goes directly to the
Lionel-Groulx Métro (Orange Line). Hold on to your transfer stub —
which the first driver extends in exchange for your fare — because 
you’ll need it to get on the second bus and then onto the subway.
Getting to your hotel by rental car
I discourage renting a car, mainly because Montréal is such a great walk-
ing city and because its traffic, one-way streets, and scarce parking are
maddening. However, at Trudeau airport, a gauntlet of booths belonging
to the usual suspects of car-rental agencies are near domestic arrivals on
the lower level. After you have your keys in hand, you can drive into town.
From Trudeau Airport, follow the signs for Autoroute 20 Est (Highway 20
East). You encounter many sharp turns exiting the airport, so be careful.
Eventually, you come to a light and a traffic circle going through an over-
pass. Follow it around and get on the highway ramp on the other side —
going eastbound. Follow the signs for Montréal, and Centre-Ville, and
this highway takes you right into the heart of the city.
For tips on getting the best car-rental rates and information on car-rental
insurance options, see Chapter 7. For names and contact information for
car-rental agencies see the appendix.
If you arrive by car
From the Canada–U.S. border, allow an hour to get to Montréal.
Depending on where you crossed, you approach Montréal’s South Shore
on either Autoroute 15 or Autoroute 10. To get to Montréal proper, you
must traverse the river onto the island via one of the bridges; look for
the Pont Jacques-Cartier.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented in Montréal 79

From Ontario, you’re about an hour away, depending on traffic, after
you cross into the province of Québec going east along the Trans-
Canada Highway. To remind you that you’re no longer in Ontario, an
extravagant, three-dimensional, illuminated sign-cum-monument stands
on the border. You’ll find an Infotouriste Centre at the first rest area, but
you can always wait until you get to town. Eventually, the highway splits,
so take Autoroute 20 and follow it straight into downtown, or Centre-
ville, in French. At one point, Autoroute 20 breaks down into a slower
road with a series of traffic lights and strip malls on either side. Do not
despair, the highway starts again, after a mile or two.
From Québec City, travel west along Autoroute 20 or 40; either takes
you through Montréal. Autoroute 40 runs along the top of the island, and
Autoroute 20 along the bottom.
If you arrive by train
In these ultra-fast times, rail travel has an undeniable romance. All trains
bound for Montréal arrive at the downtown Gare Centrale, 895 rue de la
Gauchetière Ouest (% 514-989-2626). After you disembark and claim
your luggage, you have several options. The Gare Centrale connects to
the Bonaventure Métro station through a twisting network of store-lined
corridors, part of the city’s fabled “underground city.” Follow the signs
for the Métro. The subway system’s logo is an eye-catching blue circle
with a downward pointing arrow. Closer at hand, you’ll find a taxi stand
on the same level as the main hall. In addition, several excellent, though
pricey, hotels are within walking distance. The Infotouriste Centre, a good
place to begin your visit, is at the north end of nearby Square Dorchester.
See the “Finding Information after You Arrive” section for hours.
If you’ve ever wanted to know the words to Canada’s national anthem,
they are inscribed along the bottom of the bas-relief sculpture on the
upper walls around Gare Centrale’s main hall.
Traveling between Montréal and Québec City
You have several options to get to Québec City from Montréal’s main 
airport.
By rental car
All of Québec’s major car-rental companies have counters in the arrivals
area of Trudeau Airport. For tips on getting the best rental deals, see
Chapter 7. For telephone numbers of rental companies, see the appendix.
By bus
Autocars Orléans Express (% 514-842-2281) serves the Montréal-
Québec City corridor. Express buses leave every hour on the hour from
Montréal’s Central Bus Station (% 514-842-2281), located at 505 bd. de
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
80

Maisonneuve Est, to Québec City. The trip takes about three hours, and
a round-trip ticket costs C$71 (US$60.25) plus taxes. See earlier in this
chapter for details on how to get from Trudeau Airport to the Central
Bus Station in Montréal.
By train
Trains leave four times daily from Montréal’s Central Station, 895 rue 
de la Gauchetière Ouest (% 514-989-2626), to Québec City’s Gare du
Palais, 450 rue Gare-du-Palais (% 418-692-3940). If you reserve five days
ahead of time, a round-trip ticket costs C$124 (US$105). The trip takes a
little over three hours.
See Chapter 16 for more information on arriving in Québec City.
Figuring Out Montréal’s Neighborhoods
Although a map comes in handy, Montréal’s central neighborhoods are
so different from each other that you can orient yourself just by looking
around. You can walk them all in a single day, if you’re an athlete. If
you’re a normal person, take your time. Depending on your interests,
you can walk through each neighborhood in a matter of minutes, spend
an afternoon visiting, or take the whole day exploring its different parts.
Vieux-Montréal
This is the oldest part of the city and the crown jewel of Montréal’s neigh-
borhoods. Travelers flock here to soak up the European flavor from the
well-preserved remains of the French and English colonial periods. Just
exploring the neighborhood’s nooks and crannies is a treat. Walk down
an interesting-looking street and then another; find a secret courtyard,
fountain, or square; ride in a horse-drawn carriage; or stop for drinks in
the heart of it all: at an outdoor terrace along Place Jacques-Cartier.
Montréal boasts plenty of historic sites, museums, tours, shops, gal-
leries, cafes, and other attractions, but just being here is the real trip.
You can fancy yourself in a European capital or on the back lot of a
Hollywood studio. In fact, Vieux-Montréal often passes as Paris in televi-
sion and film productions shooting on location.
Downtown
Rue Ste-Catherine is the downtown main commercial artery. It is
crowded all day long with businesspeople, tourists, shoppers, and all
varieties of Montréal street creatures. In the morning, office types wield-
ing aluminum mugs of caffeine dodge delivery trucks. After lunch, the
shoppers are out in full force, hitting the street’s boutiques, department
stores, and shops. The foot traffic is especially heavy after work as the
two crowds mingle. By dark, the mobs thin, leaving behind couples rush-
ing to catch a movie or packs of friends carrying on into the night.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented in Montréal 81

There’s plenty more to downtown than the bright lights of rue Ste-
Catherine. If you’re a culture vulture, you can get your fix at the Centre
Canadien de L’architecture (Canadian Center for Architecture), the
Musée des Beaux Arts (Fine Arts Museum), and McGill University’s
gated campus.
Chinatown
Dim sum, dragon-beard candy, bubble tea, exotic fruits, herbal remedies,
and curio shops — Montréal’s Chinatown reveals many treasures to 
the adventurous traveler. The red, imperial arches along boulevard 
St-Laurent mark the neighborhood’s northern and southern borders.
Halfway in between and to the west, you can stroll along rue de la
Gauchetière, which is closed to cars and has a good concentration of
Chinese shops and restaurants.
Quartier Latin
Rue St-Denis, south of rue Sherbrooke, spills into Montréal’s lively 
Latin Quarter. Serviced by the city’s largest Métro station, Berri-UQAM,
and squeezed between downtown, the Plateau, the Gay Village, and
Chinatown, this neighborhood’s central location makes it a crossroads
of sorts. By evening, it fills with friends looking for a spot to rendezvous
over drinks. During the warmer months, the same friends are hanging
out on the numerous terraces that run the length of the street. The Bar
St-Sulpice is a choice destination for such occasions, with its huge beer
garden that’s extremely popular among university students.
Gay Village
Montréal is an extremely gay-positive city. The stretch of rue Ste-Catherine,
east of rue Amherst and as far east as avenue Papineau, is the epicenter of
Montréal’s vibrant and colorful gay community. Gay couples wander along
the restaurant- and boutique-lined street hand-in-hand, and life goes on in
a perfectly banal way.
Plateau
For a long time, this has been Montréal’s trendiest neighborhood. In the
early ’90s, the low rents of this formerly working-class neighborhood
attracted artists and other creative types, and hip boutiques, restau-
rants, bars, and cafes soon followed. Now the very people who made the
Plateau what it is are fighting tooth and nail to keep their rent-controlled
apartments, as the Plateau’s absentee landlords look to cash in with the
condo crowd.
Despite the recent gentrification, everyone here still has their look and
plenty of swagger. It’s a great neighborhood for people-watching, shop-
ping, and eating. The main streets with all the action include avenue
Mont-Royal, boulevard St-Laurent, and rue St-Denis.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
82

Mile End
Mainly a residential area, a mix of artists, writers, students, young cou-
ples, and immigrant families — predominantly Greek, Orthodox Jew, 
and Italian — inhabit this idyllic neighborhood. The shops along rue 
St-Viateur reflect the community’s varied tastes and backgrounds. For
several blocks, between avenue du Parc and boulevard St-Laurent, rue
St-Viateur is full of appealing, yet quaint, health-food stores, cafes,
restaurants, booksellers, gourmet shops, and the like. Café Olympico
is the neighborhood hangout, with some of the best coffee in town.
One block north, on rue Bernard, you find a similar scene, but every-
thing becomes decidedly more upscale west of avenue du Parc, which 
is the neighborhood of Outremont. Although only open seasonally,
Bilboquet, at the westernmost point on this commercial strip, serves up
scoops of homemade ice cream in a wide variety of interesting flavors,
including maple taffy, or tire (pronounced teer), which is available only
for a few fleeting days in the spring.
Mile End is also bagel country. Montréal’s bagels are even better than
those in New York City; some say that they’re the best in the world!
Scrawnier and chewier than their Big Apple cousins, the dough of a
Montréal bagel is thinner, so the inner circle is much bigger, making it
more difficult to schmear with your favorite topping. St-Viateur Bagel
and Fairmout Bagel, a block south on rue Fairmount, are the city’s two
most famous factories, churning out the bagels 24/7, and Montréalers
keep up a perennial debate as to which bagel is best.
Little Italy
Boulevard St-Laurent north, way north, is the heart of Montréal’s Italian
community. This is where to go to catch up on European soccer league
scores, challenge elderly men to bocce ball games in Parc Martel, or sip
cappuccino and munch on biscotti at a sidewalk cafe. The loyal patrons of
the ’50s-style Café Italia claim that the coffee here is the best in Montréal.
At the strip’s northern end, and a couple of blocks east of the intersec-
tion of boulevard St-Laurent and avenue Jean Talon, the immense Marché
Jean Talon (Jean Talon Market) is at the geographical center of the city.
It’s packed on weekends. Formerly filled with new Canadians foraging for
deals on produce, the crowd these days consists also of culinary high-
brows searching for terroir items — quality local ingredients — and frugal
gourmets of all stripes shopping for produce, cheeses, meats, and spe-
cialty items from Québec’s bountiful regions, like ostrich meat from
Salaberry de Valleyfield.
Finding Information after You Arrive
Québec’s Ministry of Tourism runs Montréal’s Infotouriste Centre, 1001
Square Dorchester (www.bonjourquebec.com), a block south of rue 
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented in Montréal 83

Ste-Catherine, between rue Peel and rue Metcalf, and at the north end of
Square Dorchester. It’s the city’s main resource for travel information on
Montréal and the surrounding regions, and it’s chock-full of free flyers
and booklets. The keen and knowledgeable staff can answer almost any
query you can muster. During the high tourist season, from the begin-
ning of June through early September, the center is open daily from 
8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. After Labour Day until the end of May, it operates
daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. You can also reach the center by phone 
(% 877-266-5687 or 514-873-2015), should you need some roadside
assistance while out and about. With different hours from the actual
information center, lines are open April through September, Monday to
Friday 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. (except for Wed, when they don’t open until 10
a.m.), and from October through March Monday through Friday 9 a.m. 
to 7 p.m. (except for Wed, when they don’t open until 10 a.m.). On week-
ends, all year round, you can reach the center from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The Tourist Information Centre of Vieux-Montréal (www.tourism-
montreal.org) is at 174 rue Notre-Dame Est, at the northwest corner of
Place Jacques-Cartier, an immense sloping square in honor of the city’s
founder. This is an excellent resource with a helpful staff, maps, and
brochures.
Directory Assistance is free from Bell pay phones. If you’re looking to find
a local number, dial % 411, just like in the United States. Doing so from a
hotel room isn’t such a hot idea. The usual charge from a land line is 75¢
but it’s common practice for hotels to add on a hefty premium for con-
necting you to directory assistance. If you’re looking for an address or a
number and have access to the Internet, go to www.canada411.ca.
Getting Around Montréal
However you choose to get around Montréal, keep in mind that it’s a
large city with all the modern conveniences and headaches caused by
the sheer volume of people on the move. In other words, getting around
the city has its pros and cons.
On the plus side:
 The city’s central neighborhoods are compact and well served by
bike paths and an extensive public transport system that includes
four subway lines and a network of buses.
 Taxis are plentiful and reasonably priced.
On the minus side: 
 Driving in the city can be a hassle, because of an inordinate number
of narrow, one-way streets. Chances are, you’ll spend some of your
time in a taxi stuck behind a garbage or recycling truck, with only
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
84

Montréal’s mediocre English-language radio programming to help
you pass the time.
 Parking and rush hours are the same nightmares you get in any big
city.
By foot
Walking is one of the best ways to travel in Montréal (see Chapter 13 for
suggested walking itineraries). With the occasional support of public
transportation and taxis, you can get everywhere you need to go on
foot. Along the way, you experience much more of what Montréal has to
offer. Even in the cold weather, a couple layers of clothing and a brisk
pace go a long way toward combating the elements. So, don gloves, a
warm hat, and a scarf.
Compared to most of the continent, where suburban attitudes are the
rule, Montréal feels urban. Montréal’s spirit is on the sidewalks of the
neighborhoods, not in malls in the outlying areas. The sights and smells
of the rapidly changing streetscapes are a feast for the senses.
The city’s streets are inordinately safe by North American standards.
Although a modicum of street smarts is a must, there’s no mood of fear
and imminent danger on Montréal’s streets. In fact, it’s quite the con-
trary. The general population of stylish pedestrians is laid back, friendly,
and usually glad to offer directions.
By public transportation (Métro and bus)
Completed for Expo ’67, Montréal’s Métro stations were built with a
futuristic vision that has yet to materialize above ground. Today, the
look is retro, maybe a little kitschy. Even the orange interiors of the
trains are reminiscent of something out of Stanley Kubrick’s film 2001: 
A Space Odyssey.
Run by the Sociéte de Transport de Montréal, or STM (% 514-288-6287;
www.stcum.qc.ca), the Métro has 65 stops. The lines extend to the far-
thest reaches of the city. The downtown core is serviced by the Green
and Orange lines, between Lionel-Groulx in the west and Berri-UQAM in
the east. The trains run from 5:30 a.m. until about 12:30 a.m. See the
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book for a tear-out map.
Ask the ticket collector at any Métro station for a free map of the Island
of Montréal’s entire transit system, which includes all the bus routes.
(The map is very handy, even if you never board public transport during
your stay.) Near the ticket booths, schedules and routes of individual
buses departing from that station are available. Most bus stops around
the city have a departure schedule. The buses on some of the city’s
major arteries run 24 hours a day; other schedules vary. During the day,
the service, both above and below ground, is regular, so you won’t need
to plan around it, but just in case, you can also get transit schedules by
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented in Montréal 85

calling the STM or visiting its Web site. (See Chapter 6 for information on
public transportation for the disabled.)
A single fare is good for one transfer, or correspondence, between the
Métro and the buses. The rule is that you have to take a transfer at your
point of origin, not ask for one later. In the Métro stations, silver mecha-
nized dispensers just beyond the turnstiles spit transfers out at the
press of a button. Bus drivers automatically extend one to you when you
pay the fare, and they’re valid for an hour and a half. Should you forget
to grab one before getting on the subway, you can get it on your way 
out, and buses usually accept them. If the driver questions you, tell him
you’re a tourist and he’ll probably let you on. You must also produce a
valid transfer when switching between buses.
The STM charges C$2.50 (US$2.25) for a single ride, but if you plan to use
public transit several times while in Montréal, buying in bulk may prove
more economical. A strip of six tickets costs C$11.25 (US$9.50), a single-
day pass is C$8 (US$6.75), a three-day pass is C$16 (US$14), and a weekly
pass (from Mon–Sun) runs you C$18 (US$15). Monthly passes are also
available for C$61 (US$52). You can buy any of these at a Métro station’s
ticket booth and at some dépanneurs (convenience stores) and drug-
stores throughout the city.
By bicycle
Montréal is North America’s bicycling capital. Despite the harsh winter
climate that sends most cyclists into hibernation for four months,
Bicycling Magazine rated Montréal tops in North America for its cycling
infrastructure and culture.
A bike is great way to get around Montréal when the weather’s not too
nasty, although doing battle in traffic with aggressive drivers can be a
hair-raising experience. Luckily, the city has an extensive network of
bike paths, 240 miles in all, which provides a less harrowing ride
through much of the city, including stretches through parks and along
the waterfront.
You can rent a bicycle at several places in Montréal. These are the best:
 Cycle Pop et Pop Tours, 1000 rue Rachel Est (% 514-526-2525;
www.cyclepop.ca)
 La Cordee Plein-Air, 2159 rue Ste-Catherine Est (% 800-567-1106
or 514-524-1106; www.lacordee.com)
 Montréal on Wheels, 27 rue de la Commune Est (% 514-866-0633;
www.caroulemontreal.com)
By car
If there were no cars in the streets, Montréal would be an easy city to
navigate. Unfortunately, the driving culture here is somewhat distinct
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
86

from the rest of Canada. Drivers don’t ask; they take. For example, in
other cities, drivers request a lane change by using their turn signals.
Montréalers don’t really wait for an answer, they just signal and squeeze
right in, often simultaneously — that is, if they bother to signal at all.
There’s more. You can’t turn right on a red light in Montréal (a fine rule
when you consider that many drivers here are still learning to associate
red lights with full stops). A green arrow means you can turn only in that
direction; a solid green means you can go in any direction. Advanced
(flashing) green lights can occur either at the beginning or at the end of
a green light’s phase. On a flashing green, the oncoming traffic has a red
light, pedestrians are supposed to stay put, and drivers with the light
can turn right and left at will.
And then there are the turning signs. Rather than say where you can’t go
at an intersection, Québec’s traffic signs tell drivers where they can go.
Most intersections have a white sign with a green circle around a set of
black arrows. These black arrows indicate the directions a car can
legally turn at that intersection. A sign with an arrow pointing straight
ahead and an arrow pointing to the right means you can’t turn left. Go
figure. If you don’t see a sign with green arrows, you can turn in any
direction.
Filling up
In Canada, car owners buy their gasoline or diesel fuel by the liter, which
is roughly equivalent to a quart. Canadian gas prices are somewhat more
expensive than in the United States but are still considerably cheaper
than European fuel. Multiply the per-liter price by four for an approxi-
mate gallon comparison.
Parking tips for the brazen
Like any big city, parking in Montréal is a hassle. Deciphering the park-
ing signs is probably the most difficult part. You need not only a keen
eye but a firm grasp of the days of the week in French. (Beginning with
Monday, they are: lundi, mardi, mercredi, jeudi, vendredi, samedi, and
dimanche.) Most of the time, these words appear in their abbreviated
form on the signs, which is just the first three letters of each. You also
need to familiarize yourself with 24-hour (military) clock times.
One plus to driving is that Montréal has lots of metered parking down-
town and in the commercial areas of the city. You can also find free 
parking in the residential neighborhoods just north of rue Sherbrooke;
though, to be honest, you may spend half the evening looking for a spot.
Montréal residents with parking permits add to the confusion, hogging
much of the residential curbsides. Arrows delineate the extent of their
permit parking zones. If you see two empty spots in a row, chances are,
you’re staring at a restricted zone.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented in Montréal 87

The downtown area has plenty of parking lots. They hit you up for C$12
to C$15 per day (US$10.25–US$12.75) — not bad compared to other large
cities, but it still hurts.
By taxi
Montréal taxis don’t sport bold color schemes or patterns like cabs in
other cities. A white light mounted on its roof is the only indication that
a vehicle is a taxicab. When the light is on, the cab is available. Getting
around in one of them is a reasonable proposition as long as you don’t
get snarled in traffic. At that point, your ride can begin to get expensive.
The meter starts at C$3.15 (US$2.75) and climbs at a rate of roughly
C$3.00 (US$2.50) per mile of driving or C55¢ (US50¢) per minute of wait-
ing in traffic. Trips across the downtown core usually range between C$5
and C$15 (US$4.25–US$13). The city’s chauffeurs are a mixed bag, from
career cabbies, who can tell you that boulevard René-Levesque used to
be called rue Dorchester, to recently arrived immigrants, sometimes sit-
ting on their PhDs in chemistry. Hailing a cab is easy. Just stick out your
hand, and cabs swarm you like gadflies. Late at night, the more enter-
prising chauffeurs sometimes honk gently at pedestrians to remind you
of their presence.
If you aren’t near a main artery or don’t feel like waiting for a taxi to
pass, you can call for one. These are the two big local cab companies: 
 Taxi Co-op, % 514-725-9885
 Taxi Diamond, % 514-273-6331

Checking In at Montréal’s
Best Hotels
In This Chapter
 Checking into Montréal’s best hotels
 Choosing small inns as alternatives
W
ith more than 25,000 rooms, Montréal has the highest proportion
of hotel rooms per capita in North America. Options run the full
gamut, giving you loads of choices for your stay. You can opt for the
cinder block austerity of a college dorm room, the opulent luxury of a
penthouse suite, and anything in between. However, booking a room on
short notice can be a problem, especially during weekends or any time
during the high tourist season (May–Sept). To get the room you want,
plan ahead. Making your reservations well in advance can save you
money, too.
Getting to Know Your Options
Prices for double rooms at the most lavish hotels begin around C$250
(US$213) a night. That may sound steep, but compared to elsewhere in
the world, it’s a steal. The weak Canadian dollar sweetens the deal, so
Montréal may be the place to splurge on lap-of-luxury accommodations
if that’s what you’re into. If that’s not what you want, Montréal offers
loads of affordable options, too.
Boutique hotels
Step into a world of design-forward surroundings and attentive care.
Because boutique hotels usually offer fewer than 100 rooms, you receive
the conscientious hospitality that has long since disappeared from the
hustle and bustle of larger hotel operations. The good feng shui and the
Zen-like service make you feel like you’ve stumbled into a futuristic utopia.
Luxury hotels
The classic elegance and grandeur of these hotels make them the pinna-
cle of luxury accommodations. The committed staff in dapper uniforms

buzz about seeing to the guests’ every desire (well, almost). The rooms
are top-notch, and the amenities usually include a pool, a spa, and a gym.
Chain hotels
A familiar name can be comforting when you’re away from home.
International hotel chains, such as Hilton, Holiday Inn, Marriott, Novotel,
and Sheraton, offer guests a similar product the world over, so you know
more or less what to expect. Most of these large, somewhat anonymous
hotels are downtown and cater to business travelers and convention-
goers. The rooms are well kept, and the décor is usually subdued and
inoffensive.
Independent hotels
The rooms and services can vary greatly among independently owned
and operated establishments. They tend to be smaller, offer more per-
sonalized service, and exude greater amounts of local character and flair
than large chain hotels.
Bed-and-breakfasts
Bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs) can be anything from one to half a dozen
rooms in a private house. The home usually has a separate bathroom for
guests, but you may have to share it if other guests are at the B&B. In-
room bathrooms are available at some B&Bs but usually at a premium.
As the name indicates, the deal includes breakfast — either continental
or full. The proprietors are usually welcoming, helpful types, brimming
with interesting perspectives and insider recommendations. Although
they don’t offer the amenities of a large hotel, these places can some-
times be a surprisingly inexpensive way to travel.
In Montréal, several agencies broker the available rooms at the bed-and-
breakfasts in the city:
 B&B Downtown Network (% 800-267-5180)
 Bienvenue B&B (% 800-363-9635 or 514-844-5897)
 Montréal Oasis (% 514-935-2312)
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The timing of your trip dictates how much you end up spending on
accommodations. Hotel room prices are higher during the tourist
season, which is from early May through September. During the summer,
Montréal hosts a variety of festivals and special events, and rooms can
be scarce during the festival season. Check what’s going on during your
stay, and then book well in advance if you plan to arrive during a major
event. (See Chapter 3 for Montréal’s festival and events schedule.)
During the rest of the year, expect to pay between 10 and 15 percent 
less than during the summer peak.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
90

Finding the best rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate that a hotel charges for a room. It’s
the rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the
night. Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you almost
always can do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate
is surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You
may be pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them is how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward the hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than by calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the
central reservations number may not know about discount rates at spe-
cific locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group
rate for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell their
central booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and
the toll-free number and see which one gives you a better deal. If the
telephone operator tries to steer you to the reservations call center,
trump her move by asking to speak with the front desk.
If you’re staying only for a couple days in the middle of the week, be sure
to ask for the mid-week rate.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention memberships (AAA, AARP, unions, professional
associations, and so on).
In order to make a meaningful price comparison between room rates,
always ask whether the quoted price includes sales tax. If it doesn’t,
count on paying 15 percent more at checkout. Ask about any other
hidden charges that you may encounter during your stay, like parking.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Gleaning impressions from the Internet can be helpful when you’re
choosing accommodations. Through the pictures on a hotel’s Web site,
you can get a feel for its lobby, facilities, rooms, and neighborhood 
location — invaluable information.
Remember that unless you see an advertised discount for booking
online, the prices on the Web are the rack rates. So much for trying the
back door. At best, you get a ballpark figure that you can use to haggle
for a better price.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Montréal’s Best Hotels 91

However, you can use the Web in other ways to hunt for discounted
rooms. Of the “big three” travel booking sites, Expedia (www.expedia.
com) offers a long list of special deals and “virtual tours” or photos of
available rooms so you can see what you’re paying for (a feature that
helps counter claims that the best rooms are often held back from bar-
gain booking Web sites). Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) posts
unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Also reliable are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An
excellent free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you
search multiple hotel sites at once — even ones you may never have
heard of — and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including
taxes and service charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.
travelweb.com), is partly owned by the hotels it represents (including
the Hilton, Hyatt, and Starwood chains) and is, therefore, plugged
directly into the hotels’ reservations systems — unlike independent
online agencies, which have to fax or E-mail reservation requests to the
hotel, a good portion of which get misplaced in the shuffle. More than
once, travelers have arrived at the hotel, only to be told that they have
no reservation. To be fair, many of the major sites are undergoing
improvements in service and ease of use, and Expedia, for example, will
soon be able to plug directly into the reservations systems of many
hotel chains — none of which can be bad news for consumers. In the
meantime it’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a
printout of any online booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares. With both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline seems much better at getting 5-star accommodations for 3-star
prices, rather than anything at the bottom of the scale. Be sure to go to
the BiddingForTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before
bidding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay up front and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels don’t
provide loyalty-program credits or points or other frequent-stay ameni-
ties when you book a room through opaque online services.
Reserving the best room
To ensure you get peace and quiet in your room, request one on an
upper floor, away from the hotel’s meeting areas, dining rooms, and
other noisy amenities like the pool. Also ask that your room be away
from any scheduled renovations. In addition, more and more hotels 
distinguish between smoking and nonsmoking rooms. If you feel
adamant about getting one room or the other, be sure to tell every
person handling your reservation about your preference.
Corner rooms are often big and bright, and sometimes one is available at
the same rate as a standard room. If you’re traveling as a family or small
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
92

group, consider asking about a suite, which may sleep as many people
but usually costs less than two separate rooms. If you’re not happy with
your room, tell the front-desk staff immediately. Most hotels will exchange
your room if another is unoccupied.
Arriving without a Reservation
If you’re trundling around at dusk with no place to stay, call one of
Tourism Québec’s Infotouriste Centres (% 877-266-5687) or stop in. The
centers are open from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. In Montréal, the office is located
downtown at 1001 Square Dorchester, near the corner of rue Peel and rue
Ste-Catherine. Look for the blue-and-white question-mark sign. The staff
there can get you situated for one night or for the duration of your stay.
Tourism Québec’s member hotels set aside rooms for a proprietary data-
base spanning every price range and star rating. Friendly bilingual repre-
sentatives tell you whether any are available in places that may
otherwise claim to be sold out. They can also book B&Bs, condos,
chalets, and university dormitories. The latter are available only during
the summer season.

At this price, you should want for nothing 
or above
in terms of your stay. Expect a great
view, an in-room hot tub, a CD player,
thick terry-cloth bathrobes, and even
flowers. Highly deferential, personalized
service is included, as well.
Rack rates merely provide a rough guideline, so don’t be afraid to inves-
tigate an interesting choice even if it seems pricey. Most of the time, a
better rate is available, so make sure to ask.
Auberge Bonaparte
$$–$$$
Vieux-Montréal
Located in Vieux-Montréal, this gem of a hotel has 30 rooms on 5 floors
decked out in early-19th-century antiques, while the bathrooms are
modern and shaped out of marble slabs. Hardwood floors, exposed brick
walls, large windows, and views of the Basilique Notre-Dame (ask for a
room at the back) are some of the charming features that visitors can look
forward to when they step inside this centuries-old building. The rooms
here are neither fancy nor modern, like the bigger hotels. No, the brand
power at work here is the simplicity and elegance of old-world refinement.

Auberge de La Fontaine
$$$
The Plateau
Staying at this inn on Montréal’s third-largest park lets you be a temporary
resident of the uber-trendy Plateau neighborhood. Two attached, reno-
vated town houses contain 21 rooms. An elaborate and healthy continen-
tal breakfast is served in the lobby, which has large windows for gazing at
lovely La Fontaine Park, across the street. Two suites with hot tubs that
overlook the park are extremely popular among guests. Stroll along nearby
avenue Mont-Royal and rue St-Denis to your heart’s content.

Auberge du Vieux Port
$$$
Vieux-Montréal
This 27-room hotel in a late-19th-century building in Vieux-Montréal was
once a warehouse and general store. Consequently, the rooms have a
decidedly period-loft feel: stone and brick walls; high ceilings with huge,
wooden pillars and beams; hardwood floors; and wrought-iron beds. The
rate includes a breakfast and evening cocktail, the latter allowing hotel
guests a rare opportunity to socialize. The streets surrounding the hotel
are continually streaming with daytime tourists or nighttime revelers,
which can be noisy for light sleepers. Many of the rooms look out over the
St. Lawrence River and Old Port area. If yours doesn’t, the rooftop terrace
provides an eye-popping panorama. The pricey in-house restaurant serves
market cuisine featuring terroir ingredients and an extensive wine list.

Auberge Les Passants du Sans Soucy
$$
Vieux-Montréal
An extremely personable and engaging staff, wonderful breakfasts, and a
unique setting will make your stay at this small inn a memorable part of
your visit to Montréal. Book early, particularly during high season. Just
nine rooms makes landing one on short notice nearly impossible. The
would-be lobby is actually a street-front art gallery. The rooms are in a
19th-century warehouse building, so they’re somewhat raw and rustic:
stone walls and bare wooden beams. The fireplaces have been updated

from logs to gas-burning hearths. The breakfasts feature fluffy omelets,
French toast, croissants, and other baked goods. Copious quantities of
fresh fruit and a variety of juices accompany these morning feasts.

Best Western Hotel Europa
$$
Downtown
Although the lobby resembles the far-off land of Atlantis, the Europa pro-
vides the familiar comforts of the Best Western hotel brand. Located just
south of rue Ste-Catherine, the Europa has 180 rooms, on 6 floors. Each
room contains a king-size, queen-size, or two double beds; contemporary,
European wood furnishings finish the room. The white bathrooms have no
frills but seem particularly clean. You find plenty of English-language serv-
ice in this part of the city.

Crowne Plaza
$$–$$$
The Plateau
Well located near the Plateau, Quartier Latin, and the Gay Village, this 24-
story converted apartment building has spacious rooms and excellent
views and is a good foothold for exploring the trendy neighborhoods east
of boulevard St-Laurent. It is also adjacent to the Sherbrooke Métro sta-
tion. Painted vines climb along the low archways of the marble-floored
lobby. Stark landscape murals, plants, and flower arrangements give it a
winter garden feel. The rooms are quite large and include a sitting area and
a large desk but come with a standard-size bathroom.

Delta Centre-Ville
$$–$$$
Downtown
This 28-story glass tower is part of a Canadian chain of corporate hotels
and is of no relation to the airline. Its spacious rooms offer great skyline
and river views and all the amenities that today’s weary business travel-
ers demand. When it opened in 1977, this hotel was state-of-the-art. Today,
the Delta still has the city’s only revolving restaurant on its top floor, amus-
ingly named, Tour de Ville.

Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth
$$$–$$$$
Downtown
Built atop the Gare Centrale, the Queen E is the grande dame of Montréal’s
hotels. It’s also where John and Yoko did their nude rendition of “Give
Peace a Chance” in 1969, while they were on their honeymoon. Now a
Fairmont property, the Queen was cited on Condé Nast Traveler’s 2002 Gold
List. The hotel’s Beaver Club restaurant is one of the best places for fine
Continental cuisine in Montréal. You’ll find several grades of accommoda-
tion, but even the so-called moderate rooms are pretty lavish. The down-
town location is convenient, but there’s lots of traffic.

Hilton Montréal Bonaventure
$$$
Downtown
A serene penthouse perched above Place Bonaventure — 17 floors up —
this two-story Hilton comprises a perimeter of modular, concrete-walled
rooms that surround an immense, landscaped parkland inspired by the
Canadian wilderness. The emphasis here is on quiet. All the hotel’s serv-
ices are in a central hub, away from the rooms, which are spacious and
come with bathrooms finished in marble. The hotel makes children feel at
home by giving them a welcoming gift and stocking the concierge desk
with games to loan.

Holiday Inn Select Montréal Centre-Ville
$$
Downtown
From the Chinese pagoda-like exterior to the central atrium lobby, feng shui
principles influence the design of this 235-room hotel. For example, the hotel
has no fourth floor because the Chinese consider the number bad luck.
Conveniently located in Chinatown, the hotel’s décor is Asian throughout,
from the framed Chinese prints to the emerald bedspreads. On the whole,
it’s refreshing and unusual. The décor and the large rooms make this a
select-level Holiday Inn, a notch above the brand’s usual level of hospitality.

Elegance, location, and particularly large rooms are what recommend this
hotel, a former 20-story apartment building. With 135 rooms in all, each

100

floor offers a choice of nine different units, all of which have modern bath-
rooms with separate tub and shower. All rooms have balconies facing east
or west and provide great views of downtown. The back of the hotel fronts
rue Crescent, a vibrant nightlife strip. If you’re a particularly light sleeper,
you may want to request a room on the other side, away from the action.

Hôtel Gault
$$$–$$$$
Vieux-Montréal
The immense rooms of this 30-room boutique hotel feel like loft apartments.
The floors are of polished concrete, and the rooms are furnished with
mobile, custom cabinetry made from white oak. Rooms include a wooden
trellis at the door for increased privacy. Some rooms have secret terraces
and ornate 19th-century wrought-iron detailing in the windows. Most
impressive are the bathrooms, with large tubs and heated floors. The fur-
niture in the lobby, with a bar, seating area, and reading room, are all repro-
ductions of design classics, like Harry Bertoia chairs and Artemide lamps.

Hôtel Godin
$$$–$$$$
The Plateau
At the foot of all the action on boulevard St-Laurent, just steps away from
avenue St. Denis, and not far from the festivals, this 146-room boutique
hotel is an ideal pied-à-terre for a fabulous weekend on the town. The calm
atmosphere at the Godin seems just right for rejuvenating a hung-over rock
star. The lighting is soft, almost moody, and the interior’s textures are rich
and its lines dramatic. The rooms are a thrilling example of how less can
be more, with sparse, yet functional, custom furnishings and ledges. A lux-
urious, well appointed, white bed is the centerpiece. The imposing ceil-
ings are of exposed concrete and set the tone for the rest of the color
scheme: dark browns and charcoal grays. Despite the muted tones, the
rooms are warm and inviting. The concrete, see, is a theme. The hotel
occupies a heritage building, the first ever in North America to be made
out of poured concrete.

Hôtel Le Germain
$$$–$$$$
Downtown
According to the concierge, “Art Deco minimalism with a touch of Zen” is
what awaits you at this 99-room boutique hotel. Outside, the color scheme
is dark and earthy, but inside it’s clean and contemporary. The smaller
scale of this hotel operation allows the staff to be meticulous in its serv-
ice and upkeep. Fresh flowers, a sumptuous seating area, and a wood-burn-
ing fireplace greet guests in the subdued lobby. Perhaps the most
intriguing detail is that each bathroom has a glass wall. The architects
envisioned it as a way of allowing natural light into the bathroom.

Hôtel Le St-James
$$$$
Vieux-Montréal
The last time the Rolling Stones were on tour in Montréal, they booked
this entire hotel. The 61 units, many of them suites, are among the most
deluxe and expensive accommodations in Montréal, with huge marble
bathrooms and working fireplaces. The lobby and guest rooms are ornate
and decorated with art and antiques. At night, the building’s Second
Empire facade lights up and looks spectacular. Its Vieux-Montréal location
is away from much of the tourist melee and slightly closer to downtown
than other hotels in this neighborhood.

Hôtel Nelligan
$$$–$$$$
Vieux-Montréal
This 63-room boutique hotel was named after Québec poet Emile Nelligan,
whose verses are sprinkled on its interior walls. Located in two historic
buildings on rue St-Paul, one of Vieux-Montréal’s main strips, Hôtel
Nelligan is filled with galleries, cafes, and boutiques. Originally built in
1850, the premises have exposed stone and brick walls that create a warm
and welcoming aura. Guest rooms feature dark woods and leather fur-
nishings along with high ceilings, fireplaces, and hot tubs. Nightly wine-
and-cheese gatherings welcome hotel guests in the lobby’s central atrium,
which is also a popular restaurant and bar.

For a central downtown location, the Omni can’t be beat. You can walk just
about anywhere, and the Peel Métro station is close at hand. Be sure to ask
for a room facing Mont-Royal for an excellent view. Plus, the rooftop pool is
heated year-round. However, for the money, some guests feel that Montréal’s
Omni leaves something to be desired, with standard-size rooms that have a
somewhat tired feeling, particularly in the ’80s vintage bathrooms.

Hotel Place d’Armes
$$$–$$$$
Vieux-Montréal
This 44-room boutique hotel, located near the Basilique Notre-Dame and
the Montréal Convention Center, has a rooftop terrace overlooking the
many patina copper rooftops of Vieux-Montréal. The architects harnessed
the beauty of the facade and carried it over into the design of the interior.
The result is a welcoming environment that’s cozy, contemporary, and
comfortable. Brick walls and wood furnishings add to the warmth. Many
of the black-and-white marble tiled bathrooms have a hot tub built for two.

Hôtel St-Paul
$$$
Vieux-Montréal
Despite an imposing exterior, the inside of this 120-room boutique hotel is
ephemeral and ultra-modern, making a good case for the less-is-more argu-
ment. The lighting is almost theatrical — definitely moody — from the mys-
terious hearth hovering in alabaster in the lobby to the knee-level, colored
floodlights in the halls. The dark, 100-year-old wooden floors of the rooms
are warm and welcoming. The rooms are sparsely furnished — intention-
ally, of course. Along with other custom pieces, a television screen in each
room displays the room-service menu, which changes on a daily basis.

Montréal’s Sheraton is in an excellent downtown location: across the street
from the Bell Centre, a block from rue Ste-Catherine, and a quick amble
from the nightlife and restaurants on rue Crescent. All the rooms have all
the latest amenities, including the Sheraton’s own Sweet Sleeper bed (also
for sale), minibars with infrared sensors, and automated billing systems.
Built in 1982, the marble bathrooms lack nothing — except hot tubs.

Vieux-Montréal
Near Basilique Notre-Dame in the heart of Vieux-Montréal, this spacious
and classy 108-suite hotel is splendid and lavish without being gaudy. Each
condo-style suite, between 51 and 139 sq. m (550 and 1,500 sq. ft.), has a
full kitchen, a living room with leather seating, and French doors that open
to a courtyard or the streets of Vieux-Montréal. Many have their own fire-

have large showers. The staff is helpful, energetic, and well trained in the
art of pampering.

Downtown
A fancy name for a fancy hotel, the Versailles walks the walk with its under-
stated elegance. Located in the western part of the downtown core, this
106-room hotel is at the end of a long stretch of antiques shops, art gal-
leries, and designer boutiques on rue Sherbrooke. The lobby is small and
cozy, just a front desk and a seating area. The rooms are large and taste-
fully finished in neutral tones and lush textures.

Montréal Marriott Château Champlain
$$$
Downtown
This 36-floor high-rise, halfway down the hill between downtown and
Vieux-Montréal, offers standard-size rooms, but with all the amenities and
services of a first-class hotel. The north-facing view is the best, with a
close-up of the other buildings in the downtown core. Inspired by glorious
Windsor Station next door, the Moorish-style, semicircular, floor-to-ceiling
windows are particularly remarkable. Otherwise, the look and level of com-
fort are what you expect from a Marriott property.

Novotel Montréal Centre
$$
Downtown
You detect subtle differences in this hotel’s approach to hospitality from
the minute you enter the lobby until you depart. For example, rather than
a long front counter, guests check in at individual islands. The service is
considerate but expedient. The rooms have a modern feel with clean lines,
warm tones, and accents of primary colors. It is just steps away from shop-
ping on rue Ste-Catherine and the restaurants and bars of rue Crescent.

Ritz-Carlton Montréal
$$$–$$$$
Downtown
Opened in 1912 and recently refurbished, Montréal’s Ritz-Carlton, the only
Ritz in Canada, remains a bastion of elegance — the crown jewel of down-
town’s Golden Square Mile that’s filled with art galleries, swank boutiques,
and antiques shops. The quality of service is high; the staff seems to
remember each guest’s name. Surprisingly, it is not the most expensive
hotel in town — although it is definitely the grandest. High tea is served
daily, and in the summer you can sit in the garden. The rooms and suites
are spacious with large closets, chandeliers, and marble bathrooms. Some
have working fireplaces. Liz Taylor married Richard Burton here, many
moons, and perhaps even more husbands, ago.

Sofitel Montréal
$$$–$$$$
Downtown
This 258-room hotel offers its guests modern European elegance and
refinement on a grand scale in a part of downtown known as the Golden
Square Mile. Owned by a French hotel group, the Sofitel is a well-known
brand throughout Europe. The hotel is allegedly designed on the princi-
pals of the art de vivre — something like a French version of feng shui.
Despite its minimalist and understated décor, the luminous lobby’s 18-foot
ceilings make it an imposing space. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the
rooms are only half as high and offer spectacular views of the downtown
core. The rooms, with soft tones of taupe and rust, have original artwork
on the walls and teak furniture. Large bathrooms of ocher marble and
black granite countertops feature a glass-walled shower and a deep tub.

W Montréal
$$$
Vieux-Montréal
After much anticipation, in November 2004 the W finally opened in the con-
verted Bank of Canada Building on Victoria Square on the western fringe
of Vieux-Montréal. Overnight, the building went from a drab financial insti-
tution to an institution of cool. A W, to some extent, sanctifies a city as
being a world capital of global culture. You have to want the W experience,
because it is somewhat over the top by regular hotel standards — from
the gargantuan front doors to no less than three 12-foot waterfalls in the
lobby area. You never escape the feeling of being in a nightclub, be it the
futuristic lounge areas, house music in the elevators with green lighting, or

the actual throb of bass from the wildly popular bar below. Ask for a park-
facing, upper-floor room for the most peace and quiet. There’s so much
eye candy and mood lighting here that it’s hard to imagine ever shutting
your eyes. The rooms are predominantly in black and white and have elec-
tric blue accents throughout, from the glowing night tables to a sheet of
blue-tinted glass, which is all that separates the bathroom and shower
from the rest.

Dining and Snacking 
in Montréal
In This Chapter
 Understanding the ins and outs of dining in Montréal
 Finding Montréal’s top dining spots
 Locating the best snacks and light meals
Your options are staggering when dining in Montréal, one of 
the world’s great restaurant cities and a food-lover’s paradise.
Montréalers eat out often, so the city is brimming with contenders
hoping to be the next “it” restaurant with the “in” crowd. But don’t be
intimidated. Eating in Montréal doesn’t have to be an ordeal. Many
restaurants offer tasty and diverse options at a good price, and the city
has an endless variety of ethnic eats. In fact, Montréalers looking to
score a quick bite are likely to choose a shish-taouk (Lebanese souvlaki),
a samosa (meat or veggie Indian pastry), or sushi over a burger and
fries. Don’t fret: You can find burgers and fries, too.
In this chapter, I attempt to simplify your choices by offering a represen-
tative selection of Montréal’s best places to eat, including fine dining,
trendy spots, and some neighborhood gems. After that, I tell you where
to find the best picnic food, coffee, BYOB restaurants, and more.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Montréal’s real specialty, of course, is French food. Although the better
French restaurants tend to be a little on the expensive side, I think
they’re worth every penny. If you leave Montréal without eating at least
one great French meal, you’ll miss out on one of the best things about
the city.
Your terroir is my local ingredient
Many of Montréal’s best restaurants offer some variation of French or
contemporary continental cuisine. What’s particularly new and exciting
is the trend toward terroir, the French word describing high-quality,

locally produced, seasonal ingredients. (Actually, the trend started in
France about ten years ago.) Menus of finer restaurants are cluttered
with names of specialty ingredients from Québec’s bountiful rural
regions. Thankfully, most of the best kitchens go beyond obvious
Canadian staples like salmon and maple syrup and some offer items
you’ve probably never heard of before.
The brunch bunch
Does anyone in Montréal have the makings of a sensible breakfast in
their fridge anymore? Not if you judge by the action in the Plateau neigh-
borhood. On weekends, Montréalers flock here looking for somewhere
to land a late-morning or midday brunch. Lines are common at the
better places, and new spots specializing in all-day breakfasts are pop-
ping up at an amazing rate. Brunch patrons are a mixed bag, a poten-
tially volatile combination of chipper morning people and groups of
extremely hung-over friends. Everyone’s happy, though, as waiters
arrive with elaborate breakfasts on oversized plates accompanied by
fresh juice and hot coffee. See “The big breakfast bonanza” section later
in this chapter for locations.
Tasty tapas for fast friends
Tapas refers to the small plates Spaniards use to cover the carafes of
wine so that flies don’t get into the drink. Bars there serve them topped
with bite-sized appetizers to accompany the alcohol, rounding out the
experience some and allowing patrons to linger longer. They’re ideal for
sharing between busy friends with competing schedules, who can just
manage to meet for drinks. They provide sustenance without having to
sit down for a formal meal. In Spain, it’s a specific culinary tradition with
dishes like garlic shrimp, chorizo and dates, seared scallops, frittata,
and ham Serrano. Several places in Montréal carry on in this vein, while
other tapas joints cast a wider net, offering starters from around the
globe. So the term has been diluted some. Basically, if you see a tapas
menu, it means there’s food available to go with your drinks and you can
expect, hopefully, something above and beyond the traditional pub grub
of nachos, chicken wings, pies, and so on.
Super-fun supper clubs
This recent restaurant category blurs the line between dinner, party, and
celebrity. You sit down at a table for dinner and when you get up the
restaurant has transformed into a full-on nightclub, with a picky door
man and an expensive cover — which helps keep the riff-raff out. When
the second part of the night has begun, the only way to secure a table is
to buy a bottle of liquor. Then, out comes a tray with cranberry and
orange juice as mixers, a bucket of ice and a stack of glasses. You get to
play Mr. Magnanimity and host your own little party making drinks as
strong as you’d like and giving them to whomever you’d like. Much min-
gling ensues. You don’t have to buy a bottle to go to these raucous dens,
but if you don’t, you have to line up at the busy bars. The food portion
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Montréal 109

of the evening usually features contemporary and daring dishes served
by leggy waitresses culled from local modeling agencies.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Eating is not particularly expensive in Montréal, especially when you
consider how good the food generally is. Still, you can find a few ways 
to cut corners on your food budget without sacrificing too much:
 Pack a picnic. This obviously isn’t an option in mid-winter, but
during the summer months, it makes sense. With plenty of parks
across the city where you can find a shady corner to have a light
meal, even if you splurge on some fancy cheese or pâté, you’ll still
save.
 Enjoy a French breakfast. An economical breakfast, which is typi-
cally French and easy enough to reconstruct in Montréal, is a crois-
sant or two and a bowl of café au lait. Jam and dipping are optional.
See my picks for the best croissants in the “Coffee and pastries”
section later in this chapter.
 Eat your big meal at lunch. Lunch menus are considerably
cheaper than their equivalent at dinner. Check the lunch table
d’hôte, a fixed menu including a starter and dessert, which is often
a very good deal.
 Check your memberships. You may be eligible for discounts of 
10 to 15 percent off your restaurant bill if you’re a member of clubs
like AAA. Always ask.
 Eat in your own kitchen. If your hotel room has a kitchenette, you
can store some milk, bread, and a few staples. Eat in for breakfast,
pack a picnic lunch, and save your dining dollars for the evening.
 Bring your own wine. Montréal has many BYOB restaurants. Taste-
wise, you may have difficulty deciding on a wine when you have yet
to look at the menu. But budget-wise, you’ll come out ahead.
Homing In on Dining Etiquette
Here are a few do’s and don’ts for dining out:
 Dressing: In Montréal, people look together when they go out to
eat, but they don’t really dress up. For both men and women, a nice
pair of pants or even jeans (nice jeans) and a decent top make you
feel comfortable almost anywhere.
 Deciphering the menu: Don’t worry about language barriers
between you and your plate. In most restaurants, the menu is avail-
able in English. When it’s not, waiters are used to translating. Just
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
110

take note of one common trap to spare you from some confusion:
an entrée in French actually means a starter. A main course, there-
fore, is not an entree but a plat principal.
 Dining hours: Montréalers typically eat later than other North
Americans. Many restaurants don’t fill up until 10 p.m., especially
on weekends. That’s good news if you’re an early eater and want 
a table at a popular restaurant: You can almost always find some-
thing available around 6:30 p.m. or so. The restaurant may be 
dead, but the food will taste the same as it does at 10 p.m.
 Cigarettes: Smoking in restaurants and bars became illegal in
Québec, as of May 31, 2006. Now people craving a cigarette have 
to go outside.
 Cellphones: As a matter of common courtesy, annoying ring tones,
no matter how soft, should be off during dinner at a restaurant. If
you absolutely need to be reached, put your phone on vibrate.
When the time comes, excuse yourself from the table and scout out
an appropriate location to have your conversation. Outside with
the smokers is a safe bet. Otherwise, afford yourself the time to
enjoy the food and company — uninterrupted.
 Reservations: Reservations guarantee you a table at a particular
time. If your schedule’s tight or you’re dead set on a meal at a cer-
tain spot, by all means, call in advance so they’ll have a table wait-
ing for you. Reserving is also a good practice when it’s a large
group, a special occasion, or on Thursday through Saturday, the
busiest nights of the week. However, except for in the poshest of
places, you usually don’t need to reserve in advance to get a table.
So, just walk in. Actually, this is an excellent tactic for getting a
table at a restaurant where you couldn’t get a reservation over the
phone. If you’re no more than two people, you can usually snag
something by just showing up. If you do try this, have a Plan B in
case things don’t work out.
 Tipping: The standard is 15 percent, and you can give more or less
depending on your appreciation of the service. A good way to come
up with this amount is to add up the two sales taxes (the TVQ and
TPS). They also equal 15 percent of what you ordered.
Montréal’s Best Restaurants from A to Z
To simplify your choices, I give you two ways to evaluate how expensive
each place is. The first way is a dollar-sign rating. This represents the
price of one complete meal (appetizer, main course, and dessert) includ-
ing tip; the dollar signs correspond with the price ranges in Table 10-1.

Au Pied de Cochon
$$$–$$$$
Plateau
FRENCH CONTEMPORARY
In 2002, En Route, Air Canada’s in-flight magazine, named Au Pied de
Cochon one of the ten best new restaurants in Canada. Chef-owner Martin
Picard is the man behind the inspired and upscale French cooking. But a
word to the wise: Delicate and decorative nouvelle cuisine this is not.
Instead, the kitchen’s forte is hearty, almost peasantlike comfort food, pre-
pared with the finest ingredients and the greatest of care. Come hungry. As
the name suggests, the restaurant specializes in pork and even serves pigs’
feet. You also find a choice of excellent venison, lamb, and duck plates.
Foie gras (goose liver) is a bit of a fetish item on the menu, appearing in
several new and unusual places, like in a foie gras burger and foie gras pou-
tine. (See the “Eating like a local” section, later in this chapter, for more
info about this local delicacy.) The restaurant is nonsmoking.

Beaver Club
$$$$
Downtown
FRENCH
Don’t be put off by the dated, old-money feel of the Fairmont The Queen
Elizabeth’s restaurant, which actually was an exclusive men’s club dating
back to the 18th century. Beaver Club, a restaurant since 1959, ranks among
the top ten hotel restaurants in the world. Star chef Alain Pignard, hired to
rework the menu in 1999, offers an absolutely delectable range of classic
French dishes, many made with Canadian ingredients, including Québec
veal, lobster, caviar, foie gras, and more. The French sommelier is a great
fan of Canadian wines and will gladly find a way for you to taste as many as
possible. Service is warm, congenial, and beyond reproach. Prices are sur-
prisingly reasonable, considering the level of artistry you experience.

$$$–$$$$
Plateau
SUPPER CLUB
This snazzy, contemporary Italian restaurant is a fixture on boulevard St-
Laurent and a popular destination for A-list celebrities like Bono, Jim
Carrey, and Jacques Villeneuve. Check out the wall of signed plates at the
back of the restaurant for proof of their passing through. Buona Notte has
been one of the city’s trendiest spots practically since it opened in 1992,
thanks at least in part to the exceptionally statuesque and leggy waitresses
that saunter about the quasi-industrial space. But the place doesn’t get by
on good looks alone: The kitchen is meticulous about its cuisine, serving
fresh takes on classic Italian ingredients. Along with delicate starters and
fresh pasta dishes, the menu offers main courses of meats and fish. For
three consecutive years, the restaurant’s wine cellar, stocked exclusively
with Italian wines, has won coveted awards from Wine Spectator magazine.

Chez L’Épicier
$$$$
Vieux-Montréal
FRENCH CONTEMPORARY
At first sight it’s hard to figure out exactly what this establishment is. The
first thing you see when you walk in are rows of jams and preserves on
shelves. However, if the name — which means “grocery store” — suggests
the everyday and banal, wait until you taste. Plates are inventive and fun,
like the oh-so-French foie gras glazed with tandoori sauce or the dessert
club sandwiches. Whimsical as it sounds, the food is top notch.

Café du Nouveau Monde
$$$
Quartier Latin
FRENCH BISTRO
Mingle among Québec’s cultural elite in a restaurant reminiscent of a
Parisian grand café. It’s attached to the province’s premier French-language
theater and the main-floor dining room bleeds into the lobby. There can
be a crush of people at the bar before and after a show, so the traffic keeps
things lively. Busy waiters bustle about attending to the clientele’s various
demands, yet stopping long enough to provide considerate advice about
the menu. Upstairs is a more sedate and intimate dining room with a heav-
ier menu. The same kitchen cooks for both, and the menus have several
items in common; however, the downstairs one includes paninis, club

sandwiches, and the like, whereas upstairs the selections tend toward
braised meats and duck. Both have an excellent wine list with several
selections by the glass. The eye-catching, undulating, green roof housing
the downstairs cafe, on the corner of rues Ste-Catherine and St-Urbain, has
large, floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto the street. During the
warmer months, when the festival season is in full swing, it’s an ideal perch
for people-watching. Closed, the windows’ yellow stain adds warmth to
the interior.
84 rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest (Corner rue St-Urbain). % 514-866-8669. Reservations

Cube
$$$$
Vieux-Montréal
FRENCH CONTEMPORARY
In the mood for a truly slick dining experience? The minimalist décor and
rich-artist clients that linger about the tables at this hotel restaurant in
Vieux-Montréal make you feel as though you’re eating among the gods of
cool. Young as it feels, though, you have to be old enough to pay for it —
this place is pricey. But like many fine-eating destinations in Montréal, it’s
worth it. Cube offers a (need I say?) minimalist menu of modernized
French classics, items such as oysters, foie gras, and warm goat salad for
appetizers followed by fish, seafood, venison, and veal main dishes. Try
some endives cooked in grapefruit juice, sample some fine Québec
cheeses on raisin bread and hazelnut toasts, or nibble on scallops dressed
in a mousse of Jerusalem artichoke. Everything is imaginatively conceived,
exquisitely prepared, and immaculately presented.

Euro Deli
$
Plateau
ITALIAN AMERICAN
The campy approach of this cafeteria-style pizza and pasta spot attracts
boulevard St-Laurent hipsters at all hours of the day. No one seems to mind
the bright-red plastic trays, paper plates, and disposable cutlery, proba-
bly because the fresh pasta is so amazing. In terms of being seen on boule-
vard St-Laurent in the summer, there is nothing quite cooler than sipping
an espresso on Euro Deli’s marble stoop. Open later on weekends, there’s
often a mad rush of revelers chowing down late-night until it closes. During
the day, it’s perfect for a quick lunch. The pesto tortellini, the Caesar salad,
and the plain cheese pizza are all good choices. Otherwise, you can select
a type of pasta and sauce from a list or get a slice of pizza or panzerotti
(pizza pockets) on display.

What better way to kick back with a friend than by dunking morsels of
bread, meat, or veggies into a pot of fondue? If you crave fondue and a fun
time, this is where it’s at, right in the thick of the action on stylish rue St-
Denis. Fondumentale’s laid-back, slightly rumpled atmosphere makes it a
perfect place to let your hair down. Fondue is not fine dining, but
Fondumentale’s cheese, broth, and oil fondues have kept locals coming
back for years. Make an evening of it.
4325 rue St-Denis. % 514-499-1446. Reservations essential. Main course: C$16–C$27

Golden Curry House Restaurant
$–$$
Plateau
INDIAN
Locals call this place the Golden Closet, but that’s exaggerating a little. It’s
actually a narrow hallway packed with tables. In spite of the severe space
restrictions — one table is even squished behind the front door, where you
would normally expect to see a plant — this place is almost always packed.
I can’t say with absolute certainty that this is the best Indian food you’ll
find in Montréal, but popular opinion ranks it highly; the locale is great,
and the prices are very reasonable, so it’s hard to knock. The menu is clas-
sic Indian fare: nan bread; samosas; beef, lamb, and chicken curry; tan-
doori chicken; agaloo peas; and more. Wash it down with a pint of
Guinness. Waiters are polite and do their job well with, literally, very little
breathing room, so don’t complain if service is on the perfunctory side.
5210 bd. St-Laurent. % 514-270-2561. Reservations recommended on weekends.

Il Piatto Della Nonna
$$–$$$
Mile End
ITALIAN
It sure is fun to find truly traditional Italian cooking in the Mile End, a neigh-
borhood where most traditions are giving way to the yuppie tastes that
are taking over the neighborhood. Il Piatto Della Nonna is a family-run
establishment that offers fresh, homemade pasta and hearty dishes like
grilled Italian sausage, chicken legs stuffed with cheese and bread crumbs,
and veal shank. This is a good place to fill up if you’re on a budget. The
menu, which changes regularly, is a table d’hôte (appetizer, main course,
dessert, and coffee) posted on a chalkboard. Service is warm and informal
(the owner’s little girl lends a hand to the wait staff every now and again).
The coffee and biscotti are excellent.
5171 bd. St-Laurent. % 514-843-6069. Reservations recommended on weekends.

Isakaya
$$$
Downtown
JAPANESE (SUSHI)
First things first: Isakaya has the best sushi in town. That said, isakaya is
the generic word for Japan’s informal eateries, so, true to form, this restau-
rant features a wide variety of what amounts to Japanese pub-fare
favorites. Of course, these popular Japanese dishes are much more deli-
cate than their Western counterparts, and they’re healthier, too. Start with
an order of edamame, steamed and salted pods of baby soybeans, which
go well with beer. Gyoza (browned dumplings of pork and cabbage) and
yakitori (barbecued skewers of chicken) are also good starters. If you
really want to wow your date with your sushi savoir faire, ask for a spot at
the bar. Gently lean into the sushi chef and ask for, “a selection of what he
thinks is best,” some sashimi, some nigiri, and some maki rolls. A delight-
ful parade of sushi will follow.

La Croissanterie

Outremont
FRENCH
There’s always a bit of action at La Croissanterie. People flow in and out
as they please — for a late-morning coffee and croissant, a light midday
meal, a late-night snack of French onion soup, or a glass of wine any time
of the day. That’s probably what makes it so charming — that, and the
breezy, quiet, expansive outdoor terrace, which is a jewel in the hot
summer months. If you’re not feeling up to a full-force French feast, but
you still have a hankering for something Gallic, not too pricey, and a place
you can rest your hind quarters for a while without remorse, La
Croissanterie is your destination. Soups and sandwiches are served all day
long, and dishes like filet mignon, chicken breast, and fish are available in
the evening.

FRENCH CONTEMPORARY
This rue St-Denis restaurant is a long-time favorite among Montréalers in
the know, because it’s consistently good. The menu offers bistro classics,
contemporary dishes with unique twists, and a good wine list. The kitchen
excels at steak frites, duck confit, pasta carbonara, and seared tuna steak,
served on a bed of exotic fruits. The chatty crowd creates a lively atmos-
phere, which becomes almost electric on a busy night, as everyone clam-
ors over the colorful and attractively presented plates. The ever-changing
nightly specials, such as salmon filet wrapped in nori and flash-fried in
tempura batter, tend to get the most “oohs” and “aahs.” The décor is based

on early-20th-century air-travel motifs, like black-and-white photos of pro-
peller planes.

Plateau
PORTUGUESE GRILL
Le Roi du Plateau has a reputation for the best chicken, among the
Portuguese grills that dot the several blocks on either side of “The Main”
(boulevard St-Laurent) between avenue Duluth and rue Marianne. They’ll
baste your half chicken with a spicy sauce that adds zest but no real heat.
The house specialty is grilled meat, all forms of it, braised over the embers
of a charcoal fire, from squid and sardines to steak and lamb. On a busy
evening, families and boisterous groups of friends who flock there create
a loud din over carafes of red wine. Snapshots adorn the wood-paneled
walls and ledges are adorned with trinkets and souvenirs from Portugal.

Mile End
FRENCH BISTRO
Looking for a good authentic French meal at a decent price? In Montréal,
it takes a Greek to deliver this perfect formula: George Paradisis, a cook-
entrepreneur who opened this place 15 years ago. Vaudeville is a super-
quaint bistro on the northern tip of the Plateau neighborhood. A
quasi-diner revamped with white cotton lampshades and walls speckled
with the work of local artists (for sale), you feel like you’re hiding out in
some obscure town in France. On the small menu, there are hearty serv-
ings of variations on classics such as duck confit, warm goat cheese salad,
and steak frites.

FRENCH BISTRO
You may have heard the term brasserie floating around to describe a cat-
egory of French cuisine and wondered whether it’s a food or a place. The
answer: It’s both. L’Express, a Montréal landmark since 1979, is brasserie
in the purest form — or at least in the purest North American form. A
bustling restaurant-bar complete with black-and-white tiled floors and a
zinc bar, L’Express serves steak frites, duck confit, and other French com-
fort food with a jar of pickles and basket of baguettes on the table. The

white tablecloths and bow-tied waiters may trick you into thinking that for-
mality is de rigueur here, but don’t be fooled. Brasseries are high-quality
but casual eating. Whether you want to linger over a leisurely meal or wolf
down a swift lunch, the waiters will figure it out and cater to you accord-
ingly. Just don’t expect them to spend hours talking to you. They’re busy!

CHINESE
Located in central downtown, this four-floor restaurant with a pared-down
décor may feel a bit cold at first, but the food will definitely warm you up.
Don’t come here looking for inexpensive, buffet-style Chinese food.
L’Orchidée de Chine has been one of Montréal’s most popular Chinese
restaurants for years because of the sophistication and refinement of its
fare. The uniform sea of soy sauce that plagues so much Chinese food is
not to be seen here. Sauces are light and subtle. Don’t miss the juicy five-
flavored spare ribs and perfectly crispy fried spinach.

Moishe’s Steak House
$$$–$$$$
Plateau
STEAK
A revered restaurant that has been in business for 65 years, Moishe’s is
Montréal’s steak mecca, hands-down. A recent face-lift has given the estab-
lishment a modern allure, but it is still very much a remnant of the days
when “The Main” (boulevard St-Laurent) was the heart of Montréal’s
Jewish community. The Lighter brothers, who inherited this place from
their father, consider the quest for quality meat a high art. Their steaks
come exclusively from corn-fed beasts raised on a hand-picked ranch in
Colorado, and the best cuts will melt in your mouth. Accompanying pota-
toes and vegetables are also top notch, and the walls are stocked with bot-
tles of fine wine. Career waiters are knowledgeable and friendly, glad to
entertain even the most obscure questions. Come with an appetite. English
speakers feel very comfortable here.

this is where urbanites in their late 20s and 30s stop in for a late dinner. It’s
a great place for Greek tapas, the restaurant’s specialty. Service is friendly
and expedient as the waiters rush about the main dinning room. Two other
spaces, one upstairs, the other down, are more intimate and less noisy.

DINER
Quirky is the word for this little fish andchips and burger joint on boule-

chair diner into a miniscule new 12-chair diner. They whip up tasty, fresh
fast food behind the counter while you watch — breading the fish, tossing
the salad, and frying the burgers before your eyes. The entertainment
value is great, but the food is even better. Don’t scrimp on the skinny fries,
even if you’re on a diet. Homemade brownies also hit the spot.

GREEK
Avenue du Parc, just north of Parc Mont-Royal, is Montréal’s traditional

this busy avenue and the smaller side streets nearby. Philinos stands out
for its solid, satisfying food and inviting atmosphere. It’s usually full of
Greek customers, which is always a good sign. You can order from a selec-
tion of tapas-style appetizers, like szatiki, or go for generous plates of
kebabs. Don’t miss the divine dessert of thick yogurt drizzled with honey.

SUPPER CLUB
During the summer, the long narrow terrace with immense, black, canvas
parasols in the front is a major draw for the suits from downtown office
buildings. They arrive for after-work drinks, and then linger for a big-ticket
dinner. It’s usually money well spent as Dave McMillan, the restaurant’s
executive chef, devises contemporary yet refined dishes. Appetizers
include a foie gras (goose liver) sundae and salmon tartare with mixed
greens. The main courses feature a variety of meats, such as pork, fish,

duck, sweetbreads, and rabbit, and come in robust and flavorful sauces.
The restaurant’s contemporary yet serene interior can best be summed
up as retro-Scandinavian, with lots of wood, chrome, and black leather
seats and banquettes. The pleasant sommelier can help you choose from
the extensive wine list.

Rôtisserie Italienne

Downtown
ITALIAN
Don’t let the counter service, bright lighting, plastified check tablecloths,
and lackluster dinning room faze you — the pasta dishes are irreproach-
able. Excellent Italian fare at a great value is the trade-off for the odd set-
ting. There’s a disproportionate amount of oblivious, lovey-dovey couples
doing their own version of the scene from Disney’s The Lady And The
Tramp. Perhaps the fresh pasta and house wine here have a quickening
effect on the evening. A wall of signed hockey sticks is testament that it’s
also a mecca of sorts for out-of-town hockey players. They flock to this
eatery looking to load up on carbs and protein before the big game. The
pizzas have thin, crunchy crusts and come in individual-sized pans. The
convivial cooks dressed in white behind the counter beckon you to
approach. The menu is at the front, above the refrigerated display. Don’t
forget to consider the daily special, scrawled on a whiteboard, it’s often
what everyone’s eating. They’ll call your name when your order’s ready. In
the meantime find a seat or engage the willing staff in pleasantries.

MIDDLE EASTERN
For atmosphere, this Middle Eastern cafe–style restaurant is hard to beat.
The interior is warm, spacious, and comfortable, decorated with oriental
trimmings. The sidewalk terrace, spanning half a block on the corner of
two quiet streets, is one of the most relaxing in the city. A haven of peace,
Rumi is a good place to put an end to a busy day. Tapas-style portions of
Middle Eastern standards include hummus and marinated red peppers, as
well as more substantial plates like veal kebabs and seasonal fish. In the
summer, arrive before 7 p.m. if you want a spot on the terrace, or you can
call to reserve a table.

Plateau
SMOKED MEAT
This cramped deli, staffed mainly by surly seniors, is a fixture on boule-
vard St-Laurent and positively the best place to sample Montréal’s famous
smoked meat. While you’ll find little else on the menu, order these juicy
slices of beef brisket, cured, smoked, spiced, then heaped on rye bread
and served with mustard. The sandwiches or plates come in lean, medium,
or fatty varieties. The medium-fatty is my favorite. French fries, pickles,
roasted red peppers, and coleslaw sides are available separately. Tradition
dictates a black cherry soda to wash it all down. Most days bring a long
line outside, but it’s definitely worth the wait.

Taquéria Mex offers the usual selection of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and
more — all in beef, chicken, and vegetarian versions, with a choice of
salad, rice, or chips. The ingredients are fresh. The salad is never wilted
and is always accompanied by perfectly ripe avocados. The fresh toma-
toes even taste good year-round. We’re not sure how they do it, actually,
but we’ve never been disappointed. Kids will find familiar fare here, like
tacos and tortilla chips. This place is hard to beat if you want a satisfying
meal for under C$10 (US$8.50) a head.

FRENCH CONTEMPORARY
If you’re willing to lay down some big money for a serious gastronomic
experience, don’t miss this high-end French restaurant, considered one of
the best in the province. Québec celebrity chef Normand Laprise uses as
many fresh local ingredients as possible to make dishes like veal, scallops,
red snapper, risotto, guinea hen, and delectable French desserts. The food
is wildly imaginative, but it’s dished out in small portions. The atmosphere
is chic and intimate, and the same can be said about the crowd. Don’t
worry about dressing up, but most of all, don’t be intimidated by the
snobby-looking waiters. Many are chefs-in-training, along with decent
types who know a lot about their vocation. They magically lose their atti-
tude if you ask a straightforward question. Reserve a week ahead to get a
table on the weekend and don’t plan anything else for the evening.

Trattoria Trestevere
$$–$$$
Downtown
ITALIAN
This inconspicuous locale, on southern Crescent, below rue Ste-Catherine,
serves some of the city’s best Italian food. It has a strong base of regular
clientele, happy to be back for another authentic meal. Middle-aged, career
waiters welcome guests and make them feel at home with warm and know-
ing smiles. The service is discreet and reassuring — the wait staff feels like
a band of Italian uncles you never had. The semi-basement has stucco
walls and Roman arches, the whole scene is vaguely reminiscent of a wine
cellar or grotto. If you’ve never felt strongly about gnocchi, a pasta
dumpling made from potatoes, you can make up your mind after trying it
here. It’s mind-boggling. You can have it with any of the sauces on the
menu. In fact, you can also mix and match the sauces with any of the fresh,
homemade pastas. Ask your waiter what’s best, if you can’t make up your
mind. The pastas are velvety and melt-in-your-mouth — al dente, not over
cooked. However, pasta and sauces aren’t the only thing on the menu. As
you gaze over the other choices of old-world, Italian classics, rest assured
that you’ll get a true rendition of whatever you’re craving.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
In Montréal, fast food doesn’t equal tasteless — not even close. If you
don’t want to go out for fine dining every night, don’t despair. Montréal’s
food festival carries on in every corner of the city’s dining experience,
from pizza and picnicking to poutine.
Pizza and burgers
Almost everything you eat in Montréal has a distinct local twist, includ-
ing these fast-food staples. Like the French, many Montréalers prefer
pizzas with very thin crusts. If you want to try one, hit a Pizzadélic, with
various locations around town: 1250 av. Mont-Royal Est (% 514-522-
2286) and 1641 rue St-Denis (% 514-499-1444). An Italian butcher cum
gourmet shop cum pizza parlor a block away from the Marché Jean
Talon is one this town’s best kept pizza secrets: Boucherie Jos & Basile,
6995 av. Casgrain (% 514-274-6358).
If you like the thicker-crust variety of pizza, try Pizzeria Napolitana, 189
rue Dante (% 514-276-8226), in Little Italy; or Amélio’s, 201 rue Milton
(% 514-845-8396), right downtown. The tastiest delivery pizza in the
city comes from Tasty Food Pizza, 6660 bd. Décarie (% 514-739-9333),
as its name suggests. An Arab bakery, Al-Taib, 2125 rue Guy (% 514-
931-1999), holds the title of best pizza in the west end of downtown. It’s
open 24 hours and broadcasts a live satellite feed of Al-Jazeera.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Montréal 125

Montréal isn’t a big burger town, but if you get a craving, a few places
seem to have perfected the genre. Downtown, try La Paryse, 302 rue
Ontario Est (% 514-842-2040). On boulevard St-Laurent, there’s Shed
Café, 3515 bd. St-Laurent (% 514-842-0220), and La Cabane, 3872 bd. 
St-Laurent (% 514-843-7283). Hurley’s Irish Pub, 1225 rue Crescent 
(% 514-861-4111), has garnered quite a reputation for its fine burgers.
Feel like bison? Try a bison burger at Mckibbins Irish Pub, 1426 rue
Bishop (% 514-288-1580).
The best bagels
A war rages on over who bakes the best bagels: New York or Montréal. 
(I don’t have to tell you whose side I’m on.) But even inside Montréal,
there’s a civil war of sorts between bagel lovers who love one of two
major bagel bakeries in Montréal. Don’t show your colors to locals until
you know which side they’re on.
St-Viateur Bagels, 102 rue St-Viateur Ouest (% 514-272-6548), is my
favorite. Bagels come piping hot out of a wood-burning oven, drawing a
faithful following from all corners of the city. From the fridges beside the
counter, you can buy cream cheese, smoked salmon, and other toppings.
Fairmont Bagels, technically the Bagel Factory, 74 rue Fairmount Ouest
(% 514-272-0667), offers several variations on its famous sesame-seed
bagel. Here, you can try bagels with raisins and cinnamon or even olives
and sun-dried tomatoes, plus a variety of toppings.
Sandwich, anyone?
Montréalers love good bread — in particular, long, thin, crusty baguettes,
and that’s good news for anyone looking for a sandwich. Whether you
grab one on the run or settle into a cafe for a bite, this section gives you
some options.
Le Cartet Boutique Alimentaire, 106 rue McGill (% 514-871-8887) is 
a mega-mall for your stomach, disguised as a hip gourmet shop and
bustling lunch counter, the walls are chock-full of upmarket, gourmet
grocery items, like spring water from Japan. It’s a foodie’s delight. The
sandwiches are made fresh and go quickly with all the Vieux-Montréal
office workers cramming in a quick bite. The kitchen also makes rather
elaborate main courses. The choices are scrawled on a blackboard
above the kitchen. There’s always a pasta, a meat, a fish — but what
they are changes on a regular basis.
Cluny, 257 rue Prince (% 514-866-1213), tucked away in an up-and-
coming warehouse district adjacent to Vieux-Montréal, this daytime 
cafe shares its locale with an artists’ cooperative in a former foundry.
Sandwiches, antipasto, and a more substantial daily special are what the
“in” crowd of new media professionals comes for.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
126

Olive and Gourmando, 351 rue St-Paul Ouest (% 514-285-1000), has
some of the best sandwiches in town. Choose from the sausages and
cheese or more-exotic ingredients, like portobello mushrooms. The
bread is always fresh.
Titanic, 445 rue St-Pierre (% 514-849-0894), in Vieux-Montréal, is also
considered one of the city’s best lunch spots. Sandwich-wise, it serves
rather exotic combinations of ingredients on delicious crusty bread.
Homemade soups, daily specials, and heaping antipasto plates are all
delicious.
Au Pain Doré, one of Montréal’s major bakery chains, has locations
throughout the city. Each sells very respectable prewrapped sand-
wiches — classics like ham and cheese or smoked salmon. This is a good
place to stop, if you need to grab something on the run. Popular down-
town locations include 556 rue Ste-Catherine Est (% 514-282-2220) and
1415 rue Peel (% 514-843-3151). In the Plateau, head to 1145 av. Laurier
Ouest (% 514-276-0947).
Ditto Première Moisson, which also has several outlets throughout 
the city. Some stores have cafes with many choices of sandwiches and
salads and other market-inspired, ready-to-eat lunchables. One is in 
the promenade of the Gare Centrale, the downtown train station, at 
895 rue de la Gauchetière Ouest (% 514-393-6540). Another is at 1490
rue Sherbrooke Ouest (% 514-931-6540), near the Montréal Museum of
Fine Art.
The big breakfast bonanza
Montréalers are extremely fond of working off their morning blues (or
hangover) over a plate of eggs and bacon. Join a citywide ritual and load
up at one of the following renowned breakfast joints. You can have it
fancy, surrounding yourself with stylish locals and fruit smoothies, or 
go in for classic, greasy-spoon formula.
Le Cartet (see the preceding section) and Le Reservoir, 9 rue Duluth 
Est (% 514-849-7779), deserve special mention here. These are the
Johnnys-come-lately to the city’s brunch scene yet they’ve upped the
ante in terms of what to expect. Although the brunch places first distin-
guished themselves by serving copious quantities of fresh fruit — and
have largely stuck to that formula — Reservoir and Cartet turned this
weekend ritual into a gastronomic adventure of carefully matched fla-
vors and breathtaking presentations. Cobalt, 312 rue St-Paul (% 514-
842-2960), is another popular brunch destination that’s made a recent
splash. Here, live jazz accompanies your meal.
L’Avenue, 922 av. Mont-Royal Est (% 514-523-8780), located in the heart
of the hip Plateau neighborhood, has been extremely popular for years.
Trendy denizens line up for the breakfasts; to beat them, aim to arrive
before 11 a.m.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Montréal 127

Mont-Royal Hot Dog, 1001 av. Mont-Royal Est (% 514-523-3670), is 
one of the few remnants of this neighborhood’s working-class past.
Breakfasts are generous and cheap, the gum-smacking waitresses give
you exactly what you want, and you don’t have to listen to any jazz
while you’re eating.
Eggspectations, 98 av. Laurier Ouest (% 514-278-6411) and 1313 bd. 
de Maisonneuve Ouest (% 514-842-3447), as well as other locations
around the city, is a chain that serves eggs any which way, all day long.
It’s on the fancier side of the greasy-spoon scale, and so are the prices.
Chez Cora, another chain of breakfast spots, has restaurants all over the
city. For the basic variations on eggs, bacon, baked beans, and potatoes,
you can’t go wrong here. Downtown locations include 3465 av. du Parc
(% 514-849-4932) and 1425 rue Stanley (% 514-286-6171).
Cosmos Snack Bar, 5843 rue Sherbrooke Ouest (% 514-486-3814), is a
tiny, family-owned, Greek restaurant that serves only breakfast. Sit at the
counter and listen to the family at work. It’s My Big Fat Greek Breakfast:
a kind of comic-tragedy set in a greasy spoon. Breakfast here gets you
through a lumberjack’s day.
Chez Clo, 3199 rue Ontario Est (% 514-522-5348), is a Montréal landmark.
Authentic, Québec-style breakfast and lunch at absurdly low prices.
Picnicking and markets
The best place to picnic in Montréal, by far, is Parc Mont-Royal (see
Chapter 11 for details). Prime spots are the slope in front of Beaver
Lake, or the slope facing avenue du Parc. To pick up some bread,
cheese, pâté, or cold cuts, visit nearby PA Supermarché, 5029 av. du
Parc; La Veille Europe, 3855 bd. St-Laurent; or Épicerie Latina, 185 rue
St-Viateur Ouest.
Montréal’s two major outdoor markets are also great places to pick up
some light fare and explore among the locals. Both are conveniently
located next to Métro stops. To get to the Atwater Market in the west
end of downtown, get off either the orange or green line at Lionel-Groulx
station. To get to the Jean Talon Market in Little Italy, go to Jean Talon
station, at the intersection of the blue and orange lines.
These are great places to taste locally grown Québec terroir products.
Both markets begin carrying local produce by mid-June and are usually
going strong well into October. At the Jean Talon Market, don’t miss the
Marché des Saveurs, 280 place du Marché-du-Nord, one of the best spe-
cialty food stores in the city, which carries Québec wines, cheese, maple
syrup products, and more.
As an added bonus, municipal authorities remain convinced that drink-
ing wine in a park with a meal poses no greater danger to public morality
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
128

than drinking wine at a sidewalk restaurant. As long as you’re eating a
meal, drinking wine and beer in parks is legal.
Eating like a local
Like the French, Québeckers love fine cuisine. But in the dietary staples
here — notably steamies (steamed hot dogs), bines (baked beans), and
poutine (fries served with gravy and cheese curds) — Québeckers distin-
guish themselves as a totally separate gastronomic race. These regional
favorites are true fuel. Loaded with fat and dripping with grease, this is
the kind of food that sticks to your stomach and keeps you warm on
winter nights, although, come to think of it, people eat it all year round.
Give local delicacies a try, ideally on a very empty stomach. The leg-
endary La Binerie Mont-Royal, 367 av. du Mont-Royal Est (% 514-285-
9078), is Québec’s spiritual home of baked beans. Casse-Croûte La
Banquise, 994 rue Rachel Est (% 514-525-2415), is reputed to make the
best poutine in Montréal, and has more varieties than you can shake a
stick at. Restaurant Lafleurs, 3620 rue St-Denis (% 514-848-1804), also
makes a noteworthy poutine. At Chez Clo, 3199 rue Ontario Est (% 514-
522-5348), you can move up the habitant (Québec native) food chain a
little and eat Québec specialties like pea soup, meat ball ragoût (stew),
or toutière (meat pie).
The vegetarian scene
Most Montréal restaurants are enlightened enough to offer at least one
vegetarian option on their menus. But most of the time, the vegetarian
choice seems like an afterthought. Luckily, some restaurants around
town cater exclusively to Montréal’s vegetarians, who are no longer 
considered just patchouli-scented, placard-bearing, long-haired social
activists.
Right in the heart of the Quartier Latin, Le Commensal, 1720 rue St-
Denis (% 514-845-2627), was the first venue of what’s now a vegetarian
chain with several restaurants around the city. Its downtown location,
1204 av. McGill-College (% 514-871-1480), is extremely popular at lunch
with the business crowd. Food is sold by weight, and both spots offer
three different buffets at three different rates: hot, cold, and dessert. An
average meal costs about C$20 (US$17).
Cafe Santropol, 3990 rue St-Urbain (% 514-842-3110), occupies the first
floor of a house at the corner of avenue Duluth. The restaurant has a won-
derful back garden with rocks, trees, and a babbling fountain, making it an
urban oasis on a hot summer day. Inside, it’s a cozy place to warm up over
a bowl of vegetarian chili after walking up the mountain on a blustery fall
day. Sandwiches of thick sliced bread, stuffed with fresh and original
flavor combinations (cream cheese is a staple) are the main attraction. 
A couple of sandwiches include meat, so you can bring your carnivore
friends, but the rest of the menu is all vegetarian.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Montréal 129

Pushap Sweets, 5195 rue Paré (% 514-737-4527), is nirvana for vegetari-
ans and Indian-food lovers, and it’s not a bad deal either. Excellent
samosas make good starters. Delicious and affordable thalis are what
everyone’s eating. These are combo platters that vary from day to day,
usually featuring two different curries and served with a choice of flat-
breads. Pushap also makes traditional Indian baked goods, which are
very sweet.
Spirite Lounge, 1205 rue Ontario Est (% 514-522-5353), is an outlandish
dining experience by any standard. Located in a sort of no-man’s-land
between the Quartier Latin and the Gay Village, its walls are covered
with crumpled aluminum foil. This is deep-vegetarianism with a fascist
bent. At the beginning, a waiter brandishing a riding crop lays down the
exact rules. There is no menu, but a meal is three courses, each consist-
ing of a dizzying list of ingredients, organic whenever possible. Choose
your portion-size wisely, because if you don’t finish your main course 
or starter, you don’t get dessert . . . plus you have to pay a fine of C$2
(US$1.70). The restaurant matches the fine and gives it to charity. If you
don’t finish your dessert, you’re banned from the restaurant for life. If
you use your cellphone, you’re thrown out on your other ear.
BYOB
One thing that makes Montréal’s dining landscape unique in Canada is
the availability — abundance, even — of restaurants that don’t serve
alcohol but allow you to Bring Your Own Bottle (BYOB) of wine to
accompany your meals. This arrangement is ideal. It allows you to save
substantially on alcohol or afford a better bottle of wine than you would
normally order. I recommend striving to do both.
Unfortunately, in an attempt to compensate for its nonexistent liquor
sales, the majority of Montréal’s BYOB restaurants, particularly those
concentrated along the pedestrian part of rue Prince-Arthur, try to turn
tables quickly. Quality and care can suffer, and the wham-bam approach
to service can ruin your appetite as you begin to feel you’re part of a
giant, feeding herd. L’Academie, spanning three floors on the corner of
rue St-Denis and avenue Duluth, packed most nights, is the worst
offender in this regard.
However, a select few BYOBs are owned by artful restaurateurs, rather
than proprietors blinded by their bottom lines. These are the hidden
gems of Montréal’s restaurant scene. Because they are usually small and
extremely popular, you may need to reserve a couple of days in advance
in order to get a table. Walking in on a weekend night is a gamble, but
you may get lucky if you’re looking only for a table for two. At these
places, you can expect to pay between C$20 and C$30 (US$17–US$25.50)
per person, before tip and taxes, for a three-course meal.
Somewhat far-flung, Yoyo’s, 4720 rue Marquette (% 514-524-4187), is
located in the northeastern reaches of the Plateau, on an otherwise
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
130

mainly residential street. It is considered one of the best BYOBs in town.
The most serious gastronomes among the clientele bring magnums of
cherished vintages from their own cellars for decanting, because they
are confident that the kitchen will come through with food to match.
Named after an active volcano, Piton de la Fournaise, 835 av. Duluth Est
(% 514-526-3936), is the only restaurant in town that serves Creole cui-
sine from Reunion Island, a former French colony in the Indian Ocean.
The flavorful dishes are a combination of French, African, and Indian
influences. They are heavily seasoned, but not necessarily spicy. Bring 
a light red, slightly chilled wine.
La Colombe, 554 av. Duluth Est (% 514-849-8844), is a French BYOB
that incorporates North African influences. Fish first, and then meat 
are the specialties here. Of the four main courses, two are usually fish,
although the menu items change daily based on what the chef finds on
his morning shop at the market.
Reserve a table for the second of the two seatings (at 7 p.m.) at Le P’tit
Plateau, 330 rue Marie-Anne Est (% 514-282-6342). The first seating, at
5:30 p.m., can feel a tad rushed. But no matter — when you dine here,
the classic French is first rate. The chalkboard menu changes regularly
but usually features beef, pork, fish, and game.
Coffee and pastries
Montréalers who are serious about their coffee regularly trek to the
northeastern reaches of the city to get their fix. In Mile End, Café
Olympico, at the corner of rue Waverly and rue St-Viateur, is a neighbor-
hood hangout for young couples, artsy types, grad students, and a sup-
porting cast of colorful characters. A fair number of regulars hang out
here, and everyone acts as though they’re nonchalantly in the know.
Further up boulevard St-Laurent, in Little Italy, Café Italia, 6840 bd. 
St-Laurent (% 514-495-0059), is also reputed for its coffee. Here, too,
the café au lait comes in a glass. You can also order a cappuccino or an
espresso. The remnant 1950s décor and the elderly Italian men give the
place an old-world feel.
Downtown, near rue Crescent, the Montréal Museum of Fine Art, and
Concordia University’s downtown campus, Nocochi, 2156 rue Mackay
(% 514-989-7514), makes a curious selection of delicate Middle Eastern
pastries, cookies, and treats.
If you’re trippin’ about how French everything is, you may have a han-
kering for a croissant to top it off. The best in the city are baked at the
Duc de Lorraine Patisserie Francaise, 5002 Cote-des-Neiges (% 514-
731-4128). They’re good enough to give a Frenchman pause.

Basilique Notre-Dame (Notre-Dame Basilica)
Vieux-Montréal
Basilique Notre-Dame is a new-world version of Paris’s Notre Dame
Cathedral, a grandiose church overlooking a broad place, or square, in the
heart of the historic city. Okay, so the style is Gothic Revival, not Gothic,
and it was built in the 19th century, not the 12th. But still, this Catholic
church is a feast for the eyes, from the intricately carved altar to the gilded
ornamentation throughout. The effect is so moving that the basilica’s
Protestant architect, James O’Donnell, actually converted to Catholicism
when it was completed. You can explore on your own or take a guided tour
(available in English) at various times, starting at 9 a.m. Sound and light

Biodôme de Montréal (Montréal Biodome)
East Montréal
Built to fill the velodrome from the 1976 Olympics, Montréal’s Biodôme is
like a zoo and an indoor nature walk combined. You start at the penguin
pool, a universal favorite among kids and grownups. Then you follow the
trail through four different ecosystems: a Laurentian forest, the St.
Lawrence marine system, a tropical rain forest, and a polar environment,
each complete with its own plants and animals. You spend your visit
largely in temperate surroundings, but you may want to bring a pullover
for the Polar World segment. Kids go nuts here. Allow one hour.
4777 av. Pierre-de-Coubertin (next to Stade Olympique). % 514-868-3000. www.
biodome.qc.ca. Admission: Adults C$11.75 (US$10), seniors and students $9
(US$7.75), children 5–17 C$6 (US$5), children under 5, free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
(until 6 p.m. in summer). Métro: Viau.
Boulevard St-Laurent
Plateau
“The Main,” as it is known to English Montréalers, is the city’s oldest north-
south artery. It extends up from Vieux-Montréal through Chinatown and
beyond Little Italy and the Jean Talon Market to the farthest reaches of the
island. It also divides the city’s street addresses between Est and Ouest.
There are many interesting parts to boulevard St-Laurent. The most col-
orful and liveliest stretch runs between rue Sherbrooke and avenue Mont-
Royal, where the foot traffic is heavy all day and well into the night; a
multitude of cafes, boutiques, delis, restaurants, and shops are frequented
by a cosmopolitan clientele. By night, boulevard St-Laurent is one of the
city’s booming nightlife strips. It’s a major destination and quite a scene for
debonair dons and flesh-bearing divas who cram behind velvet ropes and
crowd burly bouncers looking to get into the spot. The eternal big question
is, “Are you on the list?” Just say that you are.

Casino de Montréal (Montréal Casino)
Vieux-Montréal
The Casino de Montréal opened in 1993, occupying the French and Québec
pavilions built for Expo ’67 on the banks of Île Notre-Dame. Lit up at night,
it looks like a remnant building from Superman’s home planet of Krypton.
Minutes from downtown, past Habitat ’67, another architectural gem from
the World’s Fair, and over Pont de la Concorde, the casino’s chiming

machines and velvety gaming tables span five floors. Every year, six million
guests pass through its doors to gamble, to catch a show at the cabaret
theater, or to dine at one of the four restaurants. One of them, Nuances,
nestled away on the fifth floor and offering spectacular views of the St.
Lawrence and the downtown skyline, is one of two five-star restaurants in
Montréal. You can also join the all-night cronies and early-morning gam-
blers — who must be quite a sight to behold — for brunch on Saturdays
and Sundays starting at 9:30 a.m.

Centre Canadien d’Architecture (Canadian 
Center for Architecture)
East Montréal
Tucked away on the southwestern edge of the downtown neighborhood,
the impressive grounds of the CCA occupy a whole city block. The two
buildings — one austere and contemporary, the other a grandiose late-19th-
century home — combine to make up the 12,077 sq. m (130,000 sq. ft.) of
exhibition galleries, a library and study center, a theater, and a bookstore,
all devoted to the understanding, appreciation, and betterment of archi-
tecture. As museum-going goes, the photography, blueprints, and three-
dimensional models can be a refreshing change from the paintings and
sculptures of most art museums. The CCA’s exhibits focus on architecture,
urban planning, and landscape design. While CCA attracts architecture
enthusiasts from around the globe, it is usually interesting and accessible
enough for regular folk, too. Across boulevard René-Levesque, to the south,
the CCA Garden is a unique sculpture garden — ideal at sunset.
1920 rue Baile (between rue du Fort and rue St-Marc). % 514-939-7026. www.cca.
qc.ca. Admission: Adults C$10 (US$8.50), seniors C$7 (US$6), students C$5 (US$4.25),
children aged 6–12 C$3 (US$2.50). Open: June–Sept Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 9
p.m. on Thurs); Oct–May Wed–Fri 11 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. on Thurs), Sat–Sun 
11 a.m.–5 p.m. Métro: Atwater, Georges-Vanier, or Guy-Concordia.
Jardins Botanique (Botanical Garden)
East Montréal
Montréal’s Jardins Botanique offers a respite from the concrete jungle
within the city’s limits. By combining a visit here with the nearby Biodôme
and Insectarium (see the “Finding More Cool Things to See and Do” sec-
tion), you can make nature the theme of this daylong urban excursion.
Spread over 72 hectares (178 acres) just north of the Stade Olympique, the
gardens contain more than 22,000 plant species and offer a different treat
for every season. In May, expect acres of fragrant lilac trees. Roses bloom
from mid-June until fall. In winter, ten greenhouses shelter bonsai and trop-
ical plants. In the fall, don’t miss the Magic of Lanterns, a cooperative effort

Lachine Rapids
Vieux-Montréal
La chine is French for China, which is where early French explorers
thought they were when first thwarted in navigating this impressive
stretch of rapids in the St. Lawrence River south of Montréal. Montréal has
done a lot of work on its waterfront areas in recent years, and more
improvements are planned. It’s still hard to believe that Montréal is sur-
rounded by so much moving water, but you’ll see for yourself strolling,
cycling, or inline skating down the riverside path along the rapids. The
rapids look tame from a distance, but watch for the odd, brave kayaker
bobbing at breakneck speed and you’ll get the gist. Several companies
offer rafting trips through the rapids. Lachine Rapids Tours (% 514-
284-9607) has 90-minute jet boat trips leaving from Vieux-Montréal. Call
for prices, schedules, and locations.
Métro: De l’Église station and walk south several blocks south to boulevard LaSalle.
La Ronde
Vieux-Montréal
Located on the former grounds of Expo ’67, this amusement park is the pin-
nacle of a Montréal kid’s summer fun. Six Flags recently bought La Ronde,
and then renovated the grounds to the tune of C$90 million (US$76.5 
million) — and it shows. It’s clean, slick, and packed with 35 rides. If you
have a sturdy stomach, give Le Monstre, a classic wooden roller coaster, a
try. Or venture onto Le Cobra, a stand-up roller coaster that reaches speeds
of 60 mph and will definitely bring your last meal to mind. There’s only one
catch: La Ronde is packed in the summer, especially on weekends.
According to my ten-year-old source, who waited an hour to get onto Le
Monstre, the lines can almost take the fun out of the whole experience.
Luckily, though, waits are short for kiddy rides like the Tchou Tchou Train.
If you need to take a break between rides, try the rock-climbing wall or car-
nival booths galore.
22 MacDonald Way (on Île Ste-Hélène). % 514-397-2000. www.laronde.com.
Admission: Grounds C$28 (US$23.75); rides ages 12 and over C$35 (US$29.75), ages
3–11 C$24 (US$20.50); parking C$12 (US$10.25). Open: Last week in May, Sat–Sun
only; June–Aug and Labor Day weekend 10 a.m.–9 p.m. Métro: Papineau, then bus

Marché Bonsecours (Bonsecours Market)
Vieux-Montréal
You’ll be sorely disappointed if you come expecting the vibrant market
that closed in 1963. Today, the inside of the market building is a slick mall
selling up-market tourist trinkets, mainly Québec jewelry, native crafts,
and contemporary shelf furnishings. Yet, the Marché Bonsecours is an
impressive neoclassical building in its own right, with many columns and
a silver dome. It remains an important Vieux-Montréal landmark and one
of the top ten heritage buildings in Canada. Since its completion in 1847,

Musée d’Archéologie et d’Histoire de Montréal (Montréal Museum
of Archeology and History)
Vieux-Montréal
If you visit just one museum while in Montréal, this is my choice. And
because it’s a great introduction to Montréal’s history, for the benefit of
the rest of your stay, visit this superb and unusual museum first. Officially
opened on the city’s 350th anniversary in 1992, this museum is located in
the Point à Callière building, an uber-modern construction by Montréal
architect Dan Hanganu. It was built on the site of the original French set-
tlement of 1642 — what would become today’s Montréal. After a brief mul-
timedia presentation, a self-guided tour takes visitors underground to
discover, literally, layers of artifacts from the centuries of civilization and
the partially excavated ruins of the city’s first buildings, canal system, and
cemetery. Along the way, five historical figures engage the willing in a vir-
tual conversation. A cafe on the third floor is popular for lunch among the
office workers in Vieux-Montréal.
350 place Royale (at rue de la Commune). % 514-872-9150. www.pacmusee.qc.ca.
Admission: Families C$23 (US$19.50), adults C$11 (US$9.35), seniors C$8 (US$6.75),
students C$6.50 (US$5.50), children ages 6–12 C$4 (US$3.50). Open: Sept–June
Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.; July–Aug Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–6 p.m.,
Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m. Métro: Square-Victoria or Place-d’Armes.
Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal (Montréal 
Museum of Contemporary Art)
Downtown
Everything about this new museum is light and airy, as if it were custom-
designed for daydreamers and escapists. Situated just off the sprawling
plaza of Place des Arts, it’s a great place to take a breather from the bustle
of downtown. About 60 percent of the museum’s permanent collection com-
prises works by contemporary Québec painters. There are also works from
international painters such as Jean Dubuffet, Max Ernst, Jean Arp, Larry
Poons, and Antoni Tàpies, as well as photographers Robert Mapplethorpe
and Ansel Adams. The museum is a little light on explanations, but it does
offer a few of the guiding principles of the major schools of modern art.

Musée des Beaux-Arts de Montréal 
(Montréal Museum of Fine Arts)
Downtown
Since Toronto took over as Canada’s business center 20 years ago,
Montréal has been repositioning itself as the nation’s cultural and artistic
capital. Hence, the role and profile of the Montréal Museum of Fine Arts
(MMFA) continues to grow. The permanent exhibit features an excellent
survey of modern and contemporary Canadian art, including works by the
Group of Seven and Emily Carr. It also displays paintings and sculptures by
a number of the art world’s international heavyweights, like El Greco,
Renoir, Monet, Picasso, and Cézanne. In 1991, the completion of a modern-
looking wing, directly across the street from the original neoclassical build-
ing, tripled the exhibition floor space. Throughout the year, the MMFA
hosts temporary exhibits of an international caliber.
1380 rue Sherbrooke Ouest (at rue Crescent). % 800-899-6873 or 514-285-2000.
www.mmfa.qc.ca. Admission: Entrance to the permanent collection is by dona-
tion; tickets for temporary exhibits vary but are half-price Wed 5:30–9 p.m. Open:
Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m., Wed until 9 p.m. Métro: Guy-Concordia.
Musée McCord d’Histoire Canadienne (McCord 
Museum of Canadian History)
Downtown
In the mood for some local history? This is the place to discover the past
of Canada, Québec, and Montréal. The displays of clothing and artifacts
may feel a little hokey by today’s slick museum standards, but the collec-
tions are intelligently planned and well presented. Moderate history buffs
will leave the museum with a concrete idea of how Québec’s native popu-
lation lived and how early settlers survived in hostile conditions with few
comforts. Actually, you may leave wondering what kind of crazed, ice- and
snow-loving souls decided to come here in the first place. Texts are in
English and French. There’s a cafe by the entrance and a great gift shop
with books and work from local artisans, including jewelry, scarves, and
other souvenir-friendly items.

Parc Jean-Drapeau
Vieux-Montréal
Let the expansive green spaces and varied leisure activities offered by
these two islands in the St. Lawrence River take you away from the stop
and go of the downtown. Directly south of Vieux-Montréal and minutes
away by ferry, Métro, or bridge, Île Notre-Dame and Île Ste-Hélène make
Chapter 11: Discovering Montréal’s Best Attractions 141

up the park, recently renamed after the mayor who built them. Mayor
Drapeau’s city workers constructed Île Notre-Dame entirely out of the land-
fill excavated from the tunnels for the Métro. They also enlarged Île Ste-
Hélène. The two islands were the site for the ’67 Expo, widely considered
the best World’s Fair of the last century. Now, the parklands of the islands
have some of the city’s main attractions, like Casino de Montréal, the
Biosphère, and La Ronde, but they are also a haven for swimming, canoe-
ing, sailing, cycling, inline skating, picnicking, and strolling through the
landscaped gardens. In the winter, for three successive weekends in
February, Île Ste-Hélène is the site for Montréal’s winter carnival, the Fête
des Neiges.

Parc Mont-Royal
Plateau
Montréalers from all walks of life agree that Parc Mont-Royal is a gem. Built
125 years ago, the park is the brainchild of Frederick Law Olmsted, who
also designed New York’s Central Park. If you follow the wide trail that
starts at the monument, you circle around the mountain all the way to the
top. It’s an easy walk, and you won’t feel like you’re climbing; although
there’s not much to see except trees and other walkers until you get to the
top. From there, the lookout onto the city and the river is spectacular.
There’s a chalet where you can rest and buy refreshments. Keep following
the trail until you reach Montréal’s famous cross, a huge, lit cross on the
top of the mountain that’s visible from the east side of the city. The whole
walk takes about two hours. Although not particularly dangerous, the park
is not lit, so plan to be out before sunset. Watch out for the odd mountain
biker who springs out of the woods onto the trail.
Access from avenue du Parc. % 514-843-8240. www.lemontroyal.qc.ca.
Métro: Place-des-Arts, then take bus 80 and get off at the Monument Sir George-
Étienne Cartier.
Stade Olympique (Olympic Stadium)
East Montréal
Known locally as the Big O, the facilities of the 1976 Olympics are consid-
ered either a feat of architectural prowess, an enormous concrete debt, or
perhaps both, depending on which local you ask. Built by French architect
Roger Taillibert, the gigantic, 60,000-to-80,000-capacity, white dome-shaped
stadium topped by a sloping Eiffel-like tower is an impressive structure.
And no matter what your tastes, it’s worth seeing up close. Okay, so the
retracting roof has never worked and parts of the sloping tower ceded to
the combined forces of time and gravity. The grounds of the complex still
give you a distinct back-to-the-future experience, and the view of the city
from the tower is incredible. The tour gives some highlights of the ’76
Games and explains the municipal drama of preparing for the Montréal
Olympics.

The Underground City
Downtown
Eighteen miles of underground corridors, passageways, galleries, and atria
full of shops, boutiques, food courts, an indoor ice rink, Métro stations,
and movie theaters comprise Montréal’s ville souterraine, the largest net-
work of its kind in the world. It all began innocently enough in 1962, with
the completion of the Ville-Marie skyscraper, which boasted as much retail
space underground as the total square footage of its 47 stories of office
space above. Other downtown buildings soon followed suit, converting
their lower levels into retail malls. Over time, they began to connect hap-
hazardly. The Infotouriste Centre has a good map of what’s not much
more than a maze of stores. It’s handy as a scenic alternate route or as a
hideout from any harsh weather, because it’s always warm in the winter
and cool in the summer. Ideal conditions = a shopper’s paradise.
Vieux-Montréal
Settled in the 17th century, much of Vieux-Montréal’s magic is due to its
European flair, unique in North America. You feel eons away from the rest
of the city’s 21st-century hubbub. Today, Vieux-Montréal is at once a port,
a waterfront park, and a financial district, chock-full of cafes, boutiques,
art galleries, and hotels. After you’ve explored rue St-Paul, Place Jacques-
Cartier, and rue des Artistes, head down to the waterfront. This narrow
parkland stretches down several peers, along the St. Lawrence River, and
eventually gives way to a network of bike paths. One leads to the Formula
One track on nearby Île Ste-Hélène. Inline skates and bikes are available
for rent from several shops along rue de la Commune and the boardwalk.

guaranteed to amuse.
Chapter 11: Discovering Montréal’s Best Attractions 143

Centre des Sciences de Montréal (Montréal Science Center)
Vieux-Montréal
Who said learning isn’t fun? Not the kids who go to the Montréal Science
Centre. First of all, a trip to a museum where you can actually touch every-
thing is way far-out. Room after room of interactive displays will keep them
engaged and running between exhibits. Each zone contains experiments
and games about a particular theme or is geared to a particular age group.

La Biosphère (The Biosphere)
Parc Jean-Drapeau

nature museum is much more focused on ecology than the Biodôme. With
exhibits on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River ecosystem, this
museum explains the effects of pollution and other environmental issues.

Best city parks
If people-watching or just plain hanging out is on your agenda, don’t
miss these green spaces.
Parc Lafontaine
Plateau
Lovers loll about the shaded, grassy slopes of this park, while ducks and
paddle-boaters swirl about its large kidney-shaped pond. Parc Lafontaine
is a very European-style park, as idyllic as it sounds. A great spot for a
picnic or even a nap. Throughout the summer, the open-air theater,
Théàtre de Verdure, presents many free music concerts and modern-
dance performances in the evenings from the end of June through August.
Between rue Sherbrooke and rue Rachel, on avenue Parc-Lafontaine. Métro:
Sherbrooke.
Parc Maisonneuve
East Montréal
Near the Stade Olympique, this former golf course is now one of the most
popular and vibrant parks in Montréal, so score a point for the good guys.
It’s always buzzing with action, from inline skating, cycling, and Ultimate
Frisbee to cultural festivals and the annual celebrations of Québec’s
national holiday, June 24 — St-Jean-Baptiste Day. The remains of the golf
course’s 19th hole now serve as the park’s restaurant and facilities.
4601 rue Sherbrooke Est. Métro: Pie-XI or Viau.
Museums
Museum-wise, Montréal has much more than just art. Get your fill of nat-
ural history, local history, or even some humorous history while you’re
at it. (Note: Many of the museums and galleries are closed on Mondays.)
Chapter 11: Discovering Montréal’s Best Attractions 145

Look into scoring a Montréal Museum Pass, which works in 25 of the
city’s gated attractions. It’s valid for two days, over a three-day span.
Meaning you can skip a day and do something else. The pass costs C$39
(US$33.25) and includes a pass for the subway and buses. You can buy
them at the participating museums, the Infotouriste office on Dorchester
Square, or at many hotels.
Centre d’Histoire de Montréal (Montréal History Center)
Vieux-Montréal
Find out about Montréal’s First Nations residents and the early European
settlers, who started arriving in the 17th century. The museum tells about
famous historical figures and gives you a pretty good idea of what every-
day life was like over the past four centuries.
335 place d’Youville (at rue St-Pierre). % 514-872-3207. Admission: Adults C$4.50
(US$3.75), seniors, students, and children $3 (US$2.50). Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–
5 p.m. Métro: Square-Victoria.
Musée Château Ramezay (Château Ramezay Museum)
Vieux-Montréal
Built in 1703, this medium-sized flagstone house with gated grounds is an
anomaly smack in the middle of the otherwise chock-a-block historic dis-
trict. Back then it was the palatial residence of Québec’s governor, the
king’s representative in the New World. In 1775, Benjamin Franklin crossed
the threshold of this building, but he was unsuccessful in convincing locals
to fight the British in the American Revolution. (During his visit, he helped
found the Montréal Gazette, which is still Montréal’s oldest paper and the
only English daily.) The château’s exhibits reveal the early days of colo-
nial life, through art, costumes, popular artifacts, and coins. During the
summer months, don’t miss the French garden at the back; it is one of only
three in Montréal, and the only one accessible to the public.
280 rue Notre-Dame Est (across the street from City Hall, at the top of Place Jacques-
Cartier). % 514-861-3708. www.chateauramezay.qc.ca. Admission: Adults C$7

June–Oct 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Nov–May 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., closed Mon during the winter
season. Métro: Champ-de-Mars.
Musée Redpath (Redpath Museum)
Downtown
This small natural-science museum may seem quirky by today’s slick stan-
dards, with its old-school museology style, but it happens to have
Canada’s second largest collection of artifacts from ancient Egypt. If fossils
and geological fragments are your cup of tea, check it out.

Musée Stewart (Stewart Museum)
Vieux-Montréal
The year is 1758, and costumed interpreters go about the daily chores of
the era at this military and maritime museum in Montréal’s last standing
fort, including making bread, repairing weapons, telling stories, and recruit-
ing. Built after the War of 1812 between the Americans and the British, this
fortification even has a moat. The permanent collection features artifacts
from the colonial period, including soldiers’ uniforms, rifles, cannons, early
navigation instruments, portraits of historic figures, and household finer-
ies brought over in cross-Atlantic trade. It’s a fascinating look at 300 years
of North American and European history. During the summer months
(June–Aug), a garrison of soldiers parade around the grounds and reenact
various military drills at various times throughout the day.
Vieux Fort, Chemin Tour de l’Île (Île Ste-Hélène). % 514-861-6701. www.stewart-
museum.org. Admission: Families C$16 (US$13.50), adults C$8 (US$6.75), seniors

Oct–Apr 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Métro: Île Ste-Hélène.
Churches
Montréal’s religious heyday is long gone, but, luckily, many of the city’s
glorious church buildings remain. Here are a few of the best.
Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours
Vieux-Montréal
Originally built in the 17th century, this church is known as the Sailor’s
Church, thanks to its proximity to Montréal’s port. Enjoy excellent views
of the harbor and the Old City from the church’s tower.
400 rue St-Paul Est (near the Bonsecours Market). % 514-282-8670. www.
marguerite-bourgeoys.com/index_new_en.html. Admission: Free for
praying and attending mass; otherwise, adults C$6 (US$4.50), seniors and students
C$4 (US$3), children 6–12 C$3 (US$2.25), children 5 and under are free. Open:

10:30 a.m. Métro: Champ-de-Mars.
Christ Church Cathedral
Downtown
Located on one of the busiest, most commercial streets in the city, this
graceful, 19th-century, Gothic-style cathedral has an elegant interior that’s
worth exploring. Local musicians give concerts here year-round.
635 rue Ste-Catherine Est. % 514-843-6577. www.montreal.anglican.org/

Métro: McGill.
Chapter 11: Discovering Montréal’s Best Attractions 147

Oratoire St. Joseph du Mont Royal (St. Joseph’s Oratory)
Outremont
Located on the far side of the Mountain, dividing the neighborhoods of
Outremont and Westmount, the green, copper dome of this oratory and
basilica pierces the Montréal skyline. It’s worth the trip for the devout —
the late Pope John Paul II thought so in 1982, as do many pilgrims who
climb the hundreds of steps on their knees. What lies inside is the crypt of
Brother André, a local monk said to have healing powers. The pope’s bless-
ing elevated him to a status just under sainthood in the Catholic realm.
3800 Chemin Queen Mary (corner of avenue Côte des Neiges). % 514-733-8211.
www.saint-joseph.org. Open: Daily 6 a.m.–9 p.m. Métro: Côte des Neiges.
Spectator sports
Hey, sports fans! Montréal is a great sports town and currently home to
professional hockey, football, and soccer teams. Montréal is, first and
foremost, a hockey town, and the Montréal Canadiens are the most sto-
ried team in the history of the game. Since 1929, the Canadiens have
won a record 24 Stanley Cup Championships while playing in the
National Hockey League.
Canadiens (hockey)
The relationship between the team and its city runs deep and is infi-
nitely complex. The red, white, and blue jerseys are part of Montréal’s
cultural fiber.
Every season, from mid-September to the beginning of April, the
Canadiens play about half of their 82-game schedule downtown at the
Bell Centre, also called the New Forum or the Phone Booth. The original
Montréal Forum, at the corner of rue Atwater and rue Ste-Catherine, is
now a movie megaplex.
If you’re in town for a Canadiens home game, definitely check it out.
Buying a ticket on game day isn’t easy, though; try buying them in
person at the Bell Centre Ticket Office, 1260 rue de la Gauchetière
Ouest, or phone the Admission Ticket Line at % 800-361-4595 or
514-790-1245. You can get also your seats on the Web at either www.
admission.com or www.canadiens.com. If the game is sold out, on
most nights you’ll find people outside the Bell Centre with extra tickets,
and some may be willing to negotiate a price.
Alouettes (football)
Canadian football is like the football played in the United States, but 
the field is longer and wider. Also, on offense, teams only have three
tries to advance ten yards for a first down. The season, including exhibi-
tion games and playoffs, runs from early June to mid-November.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
148

The Canadian Football League’s Montréal Alouettes returned in 1996 to
roost in Montréal. The previous flock folded because of financial trou-
bles about a decade earlier. The Alouettes weren’t much of a draw for
some time. Their recent move to McGill University’s Percival Molson
Stadium downtown revitalized the franchise, and they now sell out
games on a regular basis. In 2002, the Montréal Alouettes won the Grey
Cup Championship, so they’re enjoying an all-time high in popularity
and their tickets are hot. The Alouettes’ home field is at the top of
avenue University, halfway up Mont-Royal.
Watching the Als and their gentille cheerleaders can be a pleasant outing
on a Saturday afternoon in the late summer or fall. The Alouettes’ Ticket
Office (% 514-871-2255) is downtown at 646 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest.
You can also purchase tickets by phone (% 800-361-4595 or 514-790-
1245) or on the Web at www.admission.com.
Impact (soccer)
The new kids on the sports block, the Montréal Impact (% 514-328-
3668; www.montrealimpact.com), started in 1992 by a local cheese
company, are already perennial contenders in the American Professional
Soccer League (APSL). Soccer, not hockey, is currently Canada’s fastest-
growing sport in the amateur ranks, which translates into capacity
crowds packed into the 7,500-seat Claude Robillard Stadium, 1000 av.
Émile-Journault (Métro: Crémazie), for the Impact season, from late 
April to early September.
Buy tickets by phone (% 800-361-4595 or 514-790-1245) or on the Web
at www.admission.com.
Seeing Montréal by Guided Tour
Will a guided tour give you a better excursion than going it alone? It
depends on what you want. If you want specialized explanations of
neighborhoods or themes, or you want to see sights that are difficult to
access on your own, a guided tour is hard to beat. Someone else takes
care of the planning and answers your questions, to boot. If meeting and
talking to locals is your thing, you can take a pass on the guided tours.
No matter how good it sounds on paper, call ahead to find out if the tour
is right for you. Ask how long the tour lasts, what you’ll see, how much it
costs, what’s included (and not), how many people will be on it, whether
the tour is in English, and whether there is anything you should bring
along. Call a day ahead to reserve a spot.
Walking it
Montréal is a great city for walking because it’s full of interesting neigh-
borhoods with their own architecture, history, and flavor. Most of the
walking tours available in Montréal focus on particular neighborhoods.
These are the most popular ones.
Chapter 11: Discovering Montréal’s Best Attractions 149

End neighborhood, and a tour of Montréal’s Métro system. Tickets
are adults C$12 (US$10.25), seniors and students C$10 (US$8.50).
Riding it
Feel like a break from the walking? Want to sit back and let someone else
run the show for a while? Because Montréal is such a great walking city, 
I don’t recommend bus tours. However, bus tours do have their merits,
especially if you have trouble walking long distances. Here are your
options:
 Gray Line (% 514-934-1222; www.grayline.com) operates 11 
different sightseeing tours, departing from the tourism office on
Square Dorchester. The basic city tour lasts about an hour and a
half and costs C$35 (US$29.75) for adults and children; children

 Impérial Autocar (% 514-871-4733; www.autocarimperial.com)
offers narrated trips on open-top double-decker buses. Tours last
six hours. Tickets are adults C$35 (US$29.75), students C$32
(US$27.25), and children ages 5 to 12 C$28 (US$23.75). Buses depart
from Square Dorchester. On some tours, you can get on and off the
buses as you please.
 Amphi-Bus (% 514-849-5181) offers tours of Vieux-Montréal with 
a twist: At the end of the tour, the bus waddles into the harbor.
Reservations required. The basic one-hour tour costs adults C$16
(US$13.50), seniors and children under 12 C$15 (US$12.75).
Boating it
Nothing beats the view of the city from the waters of the St. Lawrence.
These companies offer short tours and longer dinner cruises:

barges (like the ones on the Seine in Paris) leaving the Jacques
Cartier Pier mid-May through mid-October daily at 10 a.m., noon,

students C$20.50 (US$17.50), children 6 to 17 C$9.50 (US$8); free 
for children under 5. Call for information on dinner cruises.
 Croisières du Port de Montréal/AML Cruises (% 800-667-3131
or 514-842-3871; www.croisieresaml.com) offers Montréal harbor
cruises from May to October daily, departing from the Clock Tower
Pier (at the foot of rue Berri). This company also cruises from
Montréal to Québec City. Call for departures times and rates. Fares
are adults C$25 to $40 (US$21.25–US$34), seniors and students C$22
to C$35 (US$18.75–US$29.75), children 12 and under C$22 to C$38
(US$18.75–US$32.25), families of two adults and two children C$10
to C$20 (US$8.50–US$17). The higher prices are for dinner cruises.
Hoofing it
You can also tour around Vieux-Montréal or Parc Mont-Royal in a horse-
drawn carriage, known as a calèche. No need to reserve. You see them
along rue de la Commune in the Old Port, and they line up at Place-
d’Armes (corner rue Notre-Dame and rue St-Sulpice). Count on spending
C$35 (US$29.75) per half hour or $60 (US$51) per hour. Carriages take four
or five people, and drivers usually explain historic and architectural sights
along the way. In winter, horse-drawn sled-carriages are also available.

unearth unique treasures, or bring home something special for
friends and family, Montréal is something of a shopper’s horn of plenty.
From the thriving fashion industry, vibrant gallery scene, and numerous
shopping malls to the underground city, Montréal has your shopping
needs covered.
Surveying the Scene
Shopping hours in Montréal are similar to those in the rest of Canada.
Stores generally open at 9:30 or 10 a.m. and close at 5 or 6 p.m., Monday
through Wednesday. On Thursdays and Fridays, most stores stay open
until 9 p.m. On Saturdays, the hours swing back to 9 or 10 a.m. to 5 or 6
p.m. Most stores are also open on Sundays: Hours vary, but you can usu-
ally count on finding stores open from noon to 5 p.m.
These are the standard hours for stores in commercial areas. In neigh-
borhoods like Westmount along rue Sherbrooke Ouest, which have
many small boutiques, the hours can vary from one store to another,
and owners of small shops sometimes close without warning to take a
coffee break.
In Montréal, you can find pretty much any major brand-name item avail-
able anywhere else in North America. But you can also find a lot of items
you probably can’t find elsewhere. If you’re looking for something
unique, the following are Montréal’s areas of strength:

 Clothes: The city’s fashion industry gets better practically every
season, and you can often buy clothing directly from the designers
themselves. Rue St-Denis (between rue Sherbrooke and avenue
Mont-Royal) are full of boutiques of local designers, with unique,
quality fashion at reasonable prices. Boulevard St-Laurent special-
izes in extremely cool clothes for a youthful clientele, while down-
town has a great mix of homegrown clothing chains for both men
and women, plus big-name shops of major designers. More and
more new designers are also setting up shop in Vieux-Montréal.
 Antiques: French-speaking Québeckers don’t actually care much
for the old, rustic look, which means that tons of antiques and vin-
tage pieces are available to you at good prices. (Antiques dealers
from New York flock to the city to skim off the best of them.) Rue
Notre-Dame, way west, is Montréal’s Antiques Alley, with dozens of
shops to pick through, whether you’re looking for furniture, home
accessories, or memorabilia.
 Art: Several high-quality fine arts schools supply Montréal with
what seems like a never-ending source of new talent. In addition,
established painters sell their work in the city’s traditional gallery
strip on rue Sherbrooke around rue Crescent. The Plateau neigh-
borhood has many smaller galleries featuring younger, more afford-
able artists. Vieux-Montréal has several galleries, as well as an
artists’ cooperative featuring drawings, lithographs, etchings, 
and more.
 Home décor: If you like knickknacks and cool home accessories,
you’ll be in heaven. Boutiques specializing in household decora-
tions can be found all over the city, including downtown, but espe-
cially on rue St-Denis and avenue Laurier.
 Specialty foods and liquor: The last decade in Québec has seen a
surge of interest in local culinary specialties — from maple syrup
and blueberry liqueurs to fine chocolates and Québec cheeses. The
Jean-Talon and Atwater markets are good places to pick up local
delicacies, as is avenue Laurier. Look to get your hands on some
local unpasteurized cheese. Although wine and spirits are sold by a
provincial liquor board, their offerings are anything but standard
issue. The Société des alcools du Québec (SAQ) (look for the
maroon and blue signage) offers an impressive selection of wines
from France and other wine-producing nations. Québec’s climate
doesn’t grow good grapes, but there’s an increasing amount of pro-
ducers of iced ciders, Québec’s knee-jerk reaction to the neighbor-
ing province of Ontario’s recent success with ice wine.
 Books: Not one other place in North America comes close to offer-
ing the quantity and variety of books in French that Montréal does.
And the selection in English is good, too. Montréal has even man-
aged to hold on to several independent English-language book-
sellers. Most of the English scene is downtown, while French
bookstores are practically everywhere.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Montréal Stores 153

 Music: What I say about books is also true of music in Montréal.
Compared to New York or even Toronto, Montréal can hardly be
called CD city, but after Paris, this is probably one of the best
places in the world to sample French-language music. Several large
chains, mostly downtown, pretty much dominate the market.
Sounds great, but how much stuff can you bring home?
If you spend more than two days in Canada, you’re entitled to bring back
US$800 worth of goods duty-free. Included in that price, you’re allowed
to take home 33.8 fluid ounces of alcohol and 200 cigarettes. You may
bring back tinned goods, but no fresh foods. For more info on what you
can and cannot take back to the United States, visit the Customs and
Border Protection Web site at www.customs.ustreas.gov.
If you’re a citizen of Australia, the United Kingdom, or New Zealand,
check out the regulations on what you can bring back by contacting the
following agencies:
 Australian Customs Services: % 02-9213-2000, www.customs.
gov.au
 HM Customs and Excise (UK): % 0181-910-3744, www.hmce.
gov.uk
 New Zealand Custom Services: % 09-4-359-6655, www.customs.
govt.nz
Hold on to your receipts in case you have to prove your case at the
border. Actually, hold on to your receipts so you can keep track of your
spending and count up the cost of your loot before you get to the border.
Customs agents aren’t known to provide calculators to frenzied travelers.
If you bring more than US$800 in goods back to the United States with
you, don’t worry — no one is going to throw you in jail. You just have to
pay a small tax on your purchases. And if you stay less than 48 hours in
Canada, your duty-free limit drops to US$200 per person.
Taxes, taxes. They’re rather steep in the Great White North. Don’t forget
that almost 15 percent will be tacked on to your purchases. For more
information on taxes and how to get a refund, see Chapter 4.
Checking Out the Big Names
Department stores have taken a beating over the last decade, but down-
town Montréal still has several venerable old stores that sell goods the
old-fashioned way:
 Holt Renfrew, 1300 rue Sherbrooke Ouest (% 514-842-5111), is a
luxury clothing store for the well-heeled and label-conscious.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
154

 La Baie, 585 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-281-4422), also
known as the Hudson’s Bay Company, is a three-centuries-old
Canadian institution. The Montréal store sells everything from cos-
metics to clothing to kitchen appliances, and it’s a great place to
pick up crystal, china, and bedding.
 La Maison Simons, 977 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-282-1840),
originally a Québec City chain, is the new kid in town. Great for
clothes, coats, and accessories.
 Ogilvy, 1307 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-842-7711), is an
upscale department store that feels like a collection of rather fancy
boutiques.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
Montréal is a great shopping city, but like all cities of plenty, you need to
know where to go to get the goods. The following sections show you the
prime stomping grounds of the city’s consumer culture.
Downtown
You can always go — downtown. The noise and the hurry can help your
worries. And so can a little retail therapy at the shops, boutiques, and
department stores along Montréal’s main shopping drags. You’ll feel
better and look great in no time at all.
Rue Ste-Catherine
Montréal’s downtown area is definitely not the most charming or quaint
part of the city; parts of rue Ste-Catherine are actually pretty crass. Still,
although it’s not really a neighborhood for strolling among unique bou-
tiques, it’s the place to find the city’s big department stores (see the
“Checking Out the Big Names” section earlier in this chapter). It’s where
you find most of the shopping centers, movie theaters, and large book-
stores. You also get a great concentration of chain stores of all sorts,
although most are Canadian.
The downtown core is also home to Montréal’s famous underground
city, with over 1,500 boutiques. The 18-mile underground complex links
up many of the major hotels, major shopping complexes, and most of the
downtown Métro stations. You’re likely to happen upon underground city
shops as you pop in and out of it via a shopping center, Métro station, or
hotel. The underground city is full of chain stores and cheap outlets for
everything from shoes to electronics. Very few Montréalers actually shop
in the underground city, because better stores exist above ground.
Unless the weather is particularly vicious (making the underground city
particularly attractive), your best bet for downtown is shopping on rue
Ste-Catherine, between rue Guy on the west and avenue du Parc on the
east. Here are the shopping complexes you’ll find there:
Chapter 12: Shopping the Montréal Stores 155

 Centre Eaton, 705 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-288-3708;
Métro: McGill): Eaton’s used to be Canada’s main mid- to high-end
department store. It went out of business several years ago, but
this five-floor shopping complex with 175 shops, cinemas, and
eateries has retained the name.
 Cours Mont-Royal, 1455 rue Peel (% 514-842-7777; Métro: Peel):
The shops in this center are a little more chic, and the whole effect
is slightly more elegant than at the Centre Eaton. It’s the place to go
if you’re looking for items from upmarket fashion labels.
 Les Ailes de la Mode, 677 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-282-4537;
Métro: McGill): Montréal’s newest shopping complex is also the
sleekest and the priciest. When it opened in 2002, it was hyped as 
a “new concept in shopping.” Unfortunately, most shoppers report
that they just can’t find their way around the place.
 Les Promenades de la Cathédrale, at the corner of avenue
University and rue Ste-Catherine (% 514-849-9925; Métro: McGill).
Located right next to the Centre Eaton, this shopping center is vir-
tually indistinguishable from it.
Also of note are some Montréal shops worth mentioning on their own.
For contemporary Canadiana — leather, shoes, bags, clothes, and acces-
sories — check out the sporty classic Roots, 1035 rue Ste-Catherine
Ouest (% 514-845-7995). For home décor and stylish modern kitchen-
ware, try the new lifestyle store, Caban, 777 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest 
(% 514-844-9300), a spin-off of the clothing chain Club Monaco.
Chapters Bookstore, 1171 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-849-8825), 
is Canada’s largest chain bookstore. The Montréal store is four floors
high and includes an Internet cafe. A few blocks west, Indigo, 1500 av.
McGill-College (% 514-281-5549), is part of the same chain and has a
huge selection of books and a comfortable cafe. If you prefer a more inti-
mate environment, check out the independent bookseller Paragraphe
Bookstore, 2220 av. McGill-College (% 514-845-5811). For the best selec-
tion of French books, check out one of the Renault Bray stores, either at
4380 rue St-Denis (% 514-844-1781) or at 5117 av. du Parc (% 514-276-
7651).
For CDs, visit HMV, 1020 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-875-0765). For
a better selection of French CDs, try the big Archambault store near
Place des Arts at 500 rue Ste-Catherine Est (% 514-849-6201).
Rue Crescent
If you head west along rue Ste-Catherine, away from the department
stores and malls, you soon hit rue Crescent, which has a handful of chic
shops and upscale stores, including art galleries, antiques stores, and
clothes stores. Shan Boutique, 2150 rue Crescent (% 514-787-7426), is
where to go for designer bathing suits. Aqua Skye, 2035 rue Crescent
(% 514-985-9950), is fun for fashionable jewelry. And Formes Femme

Chapter 12: Shopping the Montréal Stores 157

Enceinte, 2185 rue Crescent (% 514-843-6996), is a locally designed line
of maternity wear that will flatter forms of expectant mothers. Olam,
1374 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-875-9696), is every pretty girl’s
favorite shop, with the latest designs of locals, such as Myco Anna, as
well as international names like Miss Sixty, Killah, and Muchacha.
This neighborhood is a nice one in which to stroll about after visiting the
Montréal Museum of Fine Art, and you can also find plenty of cafes and
bars to choose from.
Continuing west along rue Ste-Catherine, look for more fun stores on both
sides. Fly Boutique, 1970 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest (% 514-846-3324), is
the strip’s last outpost of cool, just before rue du Fort. Hipsters will find
that it’s worth the trek west for the store’s many urban styles.
Mile End/Outremont (avenue Laurier)
This upscale shopping street, the playground of Montréal’s well-heeled
Outremont residents, was hit hard by the recession that gripped the city
in the early 1990s, but it’s making a remarkable comeback at the moment.
West of avenue Parc, you find great gourmet food stores like Gourmet
Laurier, 1042 av. Laurier Ouest (% 514-274-5601), and Anjou Québec,
1025 av. Laurier Ouest (% 514-272-4065). The boutiques between avenue
du Parc and boulevard St-Laurent sell upscale goods ranging from cloth-
ing for an older, more conservative shopper to kitchenware and home
furnishings.
For a wide choice of travel supplies, like bags, suitcases, sun hats, money
pouches, electricity converters, and more, visit Jet-Setter, 66 av. Laurier
Ouest (% 514-271-5058).
The Plateau
If you’ve noticed that Montréalers are a particularly fashionable bunch,
this is where they come to perfect their look. Although you find more
familiar offerings at the big stores downtown, the Plateau is the best
place to go native.
Boulevard St-Laurent
South of rue Sherbrooke, boulevard St-Laurent is home to Montréal’s
small, slightly run-down Chinatown. Walk north on boulevard St-Laurent,
cross rue Sherbrooke, and St-Laurent turns into one of the hippest streets
in the city — chock-full of trendy hair studios; even trendier clothes
stores; and fashionable lounges, bars, and restaurants that recruit their
wait staffs from local modeling agencies. For cosmetics, check out the 
St-Laurent store of the Canadian blockbuster makeup company MAC
Cosmetics, 3487 bd. St-Laurent (% 514-287-9297). Fidel, 3525 bd. St.
Laurent (% 514-296-5151), is a small shop featuring clothes by a local
designer. Fidel’s T-shirts have reached cult status, especially among
Montréal men, who seem to deem them fit for all occasions. Boutique
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
158

Scandale, 3639 bd. St. Laurent (% 514-842-4707), always has eye-catching
outfits in its windows; if you step inside, you’ll see that this boutique
keeps its promise with an eclectic yet irresistible selection of clothes.
Head north on St-Laurent, and your shopping opportunities diversify,
and food options abound until just before avenue Mont-Royal. There,
you find yourself smack in the middle of Montréal’s up-and-coming furni-
ture and interior-design neighborhood, including popular stores like
Montauk, 4404 bd. St-Laurent (% 514-845-8285), and Biltmore, 5685 bd.
St-Laurent (% 514-844-3000). Farther north, you find antiques, frame
stores, clothing stores, galleries, and more.
For used CDs, vintage clothes, and more clothes designers, head east 
on avenue Mont-Royal from boulevard St-Laurent. This former working-
class neighborhood is reaching the peak of a decade-long colonization
process led by students and young professionals. The result is tons of
interesting little boutiques and shops.
Rue St-Denis
The stretch between rue Sherbrooke and avenue Mont-Royal is the spiri-
tual home of Montréal’s bourgeoisie and the location of several higher-
end, more established Montréal fashion designers. Rue St-Denis is a
great shopping street featuring elegant clothing and unique home acces-
sories. Alas, the last few years have been a little hard on the area, with
stores coming and going a little faster than normal. It remains a lovely
street to stroll, with many inviting cafes.
Check out the big Mexx store at the corner of rue Rachel, 4190 rue St-
Denis (% 514-843-6399). Farther north, don’t miss the increasingly pop-
ular Boutique Do, 4439 rue St-Denis (% 514-844-0041), with reasonably
priced, local designs for women. Révenge, 3852 rue St-Denis (% 514-
843-4379), is another great store with local designs. Artéfact, 4117 rue
St-Denis (% 514-842-2780), has lovely and unusual suits and dresses by
Québec designers.
For home décor and gourmet kitchenware, check out Arthur Quentin,
3960 rue St-Denis (% 514-843-7513).
St-Henri (rue Notre-Dame)
Although it looks a little downtrodden at first sight, the western strip of
rue Notre-Dame, between rue Guy and avenue Atwater, is Montréal’s
Antique Alley, with dozens of shops selling collectible furniture and
memorabilia.
Check out Lucie Favreau Antiques, 1904 rue Notre-Dame Ouest (% 514-
989-5117), for crazy collectibles; Les Antiquités Grand Central, 2448
rue Notre-Dame Ouest (% 514-935-1467), for more-elegant pieces; and
Lussier Antiques, 3645 rue Notre-Dame Ouest (% 514-938-2224), for
bargains on lamps, chests, and fixtures.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Montréal Stores 159

David S. Brown Antiques, 995 rue Wellington (% 514-844-9866), carries
European and North American antiques from the 18th and 19th centuries.
And Obsession Antiques, 1886 rue Notre-Dame Ouest (% 514-933-6375),
is one of the more reputable dealers on the Antique Alley strip.
At avenue Atwater, just to the south, is the Atwater Market, with farm-
ers, butchers, fishmongers, and gourmet shops.
Further north on av. Atwater, at the corner of rue St-Antoine, look into
the showroom of Harricana, 3000 rue St-Antoine Ouest (% 877-894-
9919), which makes warm things for winter out of secondhand fur. Note:
As of a couple of seasons ago, to everyone’s collective surprise, fur
made a big comeback on the catwalks showing their winter collections.
Vieux-Montréal (rue St-Paul)
Until several years ago, Vieux-Montréal was not considered much of a
shopping area, unless you were in the market for cheesy tourist sou-
venirs. Large cash injections over the last decade changed all that, and
rue St-Paul in particular has profited from the renaissance. This is the
street to scout for arts and crafts. Check out La Guilde Graphique, 9 rue
St-Paul Ouest (% 514-844-3438), where more than 200 artists display
their work, or visit a craftspeople’s collective L’Empreinte, 272 rue 
St-Paul Ouest (% 514-861-4427).
For modern-art galleries, try Gallery 2000, 45 rue St-Paul Ouest (% 844-
1812); Galerie Parchemine, across the street at 40 rue St-Paul Ouest 
(% 514-845-3368); or Galerie St-Dizier, 20 rue St-Paul Ouest (% 514-
845-8411).
Westmount (rue Sherbrooke Ouest)
Rue Sherbrooke Ouest around avenue Greene is very much the tradi-
tional English area of the city. You can find the usual selection of upscale
clothing, shoes, and home furnishings. Over the last few years, perhaps
because more and more French-speakers are moving into the neighbor-
hood, stores in this district have taken on a more European flavor. In
particular, don’t miss L’Occitane, a popular French cosmetics chain, full
of luxurious soaps, moisturizers, and perfumes from Provence at 4972
rue Sherbrooke Ouest (% 514-482-8188).
Lululemon Athletica, 1394 av. Greene, on the corner of Sherbrooke 
(% 514-937-5151), sells Canadian-designed, uber-trendy yoga gear,
made of high-tech fabrics that breathe and wick away sweat. Scarpa,
4901 rue Sherbrooke Ouest (% 514-484-0440), is the best place for
shoes in the city; there’s another location at 4257 rue St-Denis (%
514-282-6363). James, 4910 rue Sherbrooke Ouest (% 514-369-0700), 
is a boutique selling trendy looks by famous labels.

Following an Itinerary: 
Five Great Options
In This Chapter
 Seeing the best of Montréal no matter how much time you have
 Discovering what makes Montréal a city like no other
T
he Montréal experience is greater than the sum of its architecture,
shopping, entertainment, dining, and attractions. There is something
quintessentially Montréal happening in the city’s streets all the time,
whether you’re on commercial strips, landscaped parks, outdoor ter-
races, or among the festival crowds. You feel the city’s attitude and
spend your whole holiday trying to put in words just what it is — and
that’s je ne sais quoi.
Residents and visitors alike spend many an hour contemplating that
question. (Answer: It’s many things.) If you’re in a car, though, chances
are, Montréal’s ephemeral nature will pass you by. If you’re on foot and
still don’t know what I mean, go for a drink on the back patio of Bar 
St-Sulpice on rue St-Denis on a busy summer night. Experience, wonder,
discuss.
What follows are five suggested itineraries that will let you experience
the city like a Montréaler. They’re less about getting around among vari-
ous attractions, and more about exploring neighborhoods and indulging
in experiences and rituals that are favorites here.
Montréal in Three Days
Three days is an ideal block of time for an excellent introduction to
Montréal, say, over a holiday long weekend. Sleep could become a real
issue, depending on how late you’re willing to stay up. Or, you can take it
slow and have a relaxing time not doing anything in particular, wander-
ing through Montréal’s street scenes, which can be entertainment
enough; there’s always something to behold.

The following is a medium-paced itinerary with suggestions for stringing
together several of the attractions and other worthwhile destinations
mentioned in this guide.
Day 1
If you’re just in for 24 hours, here’s what to do. The idea is to get a quick
taste of some quintessential experiences. It’s Vieux-Montréal in the morn-
ing; start at Métro Square-Victoria (the exits open onto avenue McGill).
Wind your way south and east, willy-nilly, through the streets, until you hit
the rue de la Commune and the waterfront. Don’t go too far east or you’ll
have to backtrack. As a more direct alternative, you can also walk straight
down McGill and turn left when you hit the end. You’re looking for the
Musée d’Archéologie et d’Histoire de Montréal located on the same site
as the first European settlement. If you arrive before the museum opens,
find a coffee shop with fresh baked goods and café au lait. If you’ve
already located the museum, nearby, Olive and Gourmando, at the
corner of rues St-Paul and St-Pierre is just the spot.
You can sip your coffee over a copy of one of the local papers — The
Montréal Gazette (English) or La Presse (French). It’s not only a good way
to catch up on local affairs but the “Arts” and “Life” sections (or equiva-
lent sections) often have a calendar of events that lists what’s going that
same day. The free-press weeklies, the Mirror and the Hour in English and
Ici and Voir in French, cover the city’s cultural calendar from Thursday to
Wednesday. Even in the French papers, it’s pretty easy to decipher the
what, when, and where of an event.
Or, you can head back out into the street with your coffee and croissant
and watch the neighborhood waking up. Vieux-Montréal is filled with
office spaces, so the streets will already be bustling with people rushing
to work.
After visiting the museum, reward yourself with some shopping by
taking a stroll along rue St-Paul, Vieux-Montréal’s busiest street, jam-
med with galleries, restaurants, boutique hotels, and more. It runs just
behind the Old Customs House on Place Royale. Walking north, from de
la Commune, turn right on St-Paul and continue for about 5 blocks until
you hit Place Jacques-Cartier. This sloped square, bearing the name of
the explorer who first made landfall here, is the main gathering point for
people in the neighborhood. Touristy restaurants with terraces and
touts posted out front line both sides. Continue past Place Jacques-
Cartier until you hit Marché Bonsecours, which has been everything
from a market and a city hall, to Canada’s legislature. In its current role,
it is an upscale mall selling Québec-designed decorative arts, Native
Canadian crafts, jewelry, and other potential souvenirs. Time permitting,
after this shopping run you can head to the waterfront and witness the
mighty currents of the St. Laurent, from the boardwalk or atop a clock
tower at the end of a pier in the Old-Port.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
162

Make your way back to Place Jacques-Cartier and head for the street at
the top (rue Notre-Dame). In front and just to the right is Montréal’s
Hôtel-de-Ville or City Hall. In 1967, French president Charles de Gaulle
fanned the flames of Québec separatism, by shouting “Vive le Québec
libre!” from the balcony, which roughly translates into, “Long live a free
Québec!” Across the street from city hall, on the same side as Place
Jacques-Cartier is Château Ramsey, a museum about the colonial his-
tory of New France. During the summer and early fall, it’s worth a stroll
in their French garden at the back. If you don’t feel like entering the
museum, you can access the garden free from behind the museum, just
off of Place Jacques-Cartier.
Back on rue Notre-Dame, turn left and walk several blocks until the
Basilique Notre-Dame. This is where Céline Dion’s wedding was. If you’re
enchanted with Vieux-Montréal and would like to come back, around
sunset, take note of the horse-drawn carriages parked in front of the
church, which you can hire to take an extended tour at a romantic pace.
Now it’s time for lunch. See Chapter 10 for my recommendations: Le
Cartet and Cluny are good choices at this point, but they’re back near
rue McGill where you started your day. You can continue along rue
Nortre-Dame to get there, or wander willy-nilly once again. Or if you’re
feeling adventurous, from the basilica, head north into Montréal’s
Chinatown, boulevard St-Laurent between rue Viger and avenue Réne
Lévesque.
After lunch, it’s time for some shopping. Surface at the Mont-Royal
Métro station. Turn left on avenue Mont-Royal and go to rue St-Denis. An
ambitious but rewarding retail circuit would be a left turn down St-Denis;
right when you hit Carré St-Louis, a small square with a fountain in the
middle, cross the square; take rue Prince-Arthur, a pedestrian mall, and
turn right on boulevard St-Laurent; carry on until avenue Mont-Royal,
where you make a right. Soon you’ll wind up back in front of the Métro
station where you started. This lap will take you past some of the city’s
best boutiques and along several hot stretches of the Plateau neighbor-
hood. Take a look at a map beforehand to gauge how far this really is. Of
course, you can bail at any point, depending on what you see and how
long you take in the stores. This is your afternoon activity.
Return to your accommodations, drop your loot, freshen up for dinner,
and it’s out the door for a pre-dinner glass of wine. If it’s summer, find a
terrace. The action will be liveliest there. See Chapter 15 for some of my
recommendations. In terms of picking a neighborhood for a drink, check
out the Quartier Latin, there are a multitude of choices and it will leave
you in a good position for a variety of dinner destinations. Or perhaps
you scouted something on your walk around town and would rather 
go there.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 163

After dinner, it’s time to step out into the night. If you’re looking for
some live music, check out the schedules at Montréal’s larger venues, 
Le Spectrum, Metropolis, Club Soda, and Le Cabaret. See Chapter 15
for details and a slew of other nightlife recommendations.
Day 2
Start by following the “Brunch, Tam-tams, and Beyond” itinerary later in
this chapter. Grab breakfast, or brunch, at Café Souvenir on rue Bernard
or wait until rue St-Viateur and grab a coffee at Café Olympico and a
bagel at St-Viateur Bagels. If it’s not a Sunday or during warm weather,
Tam-tams, a weekly drum circle and catch-all pagan gathering in Parc
Mont-Royal won’t be happening. So your last stop for this first segment
is avenue Laurier and the several blocks of charming shops and bou-
tiques on either side of avenue du Parc.
Jump in a cab or hop on a bus and head downtown; bus 80 runs along
avenue du Parc. If you hailed a cab, tell the driver that you’re off to the
Canadian Centre for Architecture. By bus, grab a transfer and get off at
the Place-des-Arts Métro. Duck underground. Take the subway (direction
Angrinon to Métro Guy-Concordia); the CCA is a short walk from there.
By now it’s lunch. You’re downtown and starving. A great choice nearby
is Rotisserie Italienne. Or there is a strip of pan-Asian, stir-fry places
along rue Ste-Catherine just north of the CCA that are popular. One of
the more notable choices is 59 Bangkok, which has the best pad thai.
After lunch, stroll east along rue Ste-Catherine, in the same direction as
the car traffic, until rue Crescent. Turn left and walk up this busy strip.
Crescent above and below Ste-Catherine is a hopping nightlife district,
but by day the boutiques and galleries, north of boulevard Maisonneuve,
are of greater interest. At the top of the street, on your left, is Musée des
Beaux-Arts de Montréal. The permanent collection is free, but the
museum requests a donation. They charge admission to see the tempo-
rary exhibitions, which usually feature international-caliber artists.
When you emerge from the museum, take a walk east along rue
Sherbrooke. In 2 blocks on the same side, there’s an Art Deco building
housing Holt Renfrew, Canada’s answer to Bloomingdale’s. You can either
stop here for some chic shopping or continue along several more blocks
and visit the gated campus of McGill University. The university bookstore
is on rue McTavish, 1 block before the main gates to the campus.
Walk through the gates and the building you see in the middle; at the top
of the road, is the Arts Building — the oldest of the bunch. This central
quadrangle is usually filled with collegiate activity; sports or campus
events on the playing field; and students going to class, sitting outside,
or loitering in front of the library. The Musée Redpath, a natural history
museum, is to the left, beyond the soccer field. If it’s still before 5 p.m.,
it’s a fun, free visit to round out this portion of the day.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
164

When you’re done on campus, exit by the Milton Gates, which are to the
right of the Arts Building. Walk east along avenue Milton to boulevard St-
Laurent, you’re passing through the “McGill Ghetto” — don’t worry, it’s
perfectly safe — it’s named this way because so many McGill students
live around here. It’s several blocks through mainly residential streets.
Halfway, you’ll cross avenue du Park. Hungry, now? Isakaya, the best
sushi in town, is a couple doors down from Milton. Otherwise, carry on
just a little bit farther to the glitz and glamour of “The Main.”
You can spend the rest of the evening on boulevard St-Laurent shopping
for the remaining business hours, having dinner, and going out after.
Don’t worry: It will all become perfectly clear when you get there. The
action is dense, the hip quotient off-the-chart, so you can freestyle your
evening from here. If you’re too tired and just want to sit down, or you’re
looking for something more sedate, catch a film at Excentris, a rep
cinema with extra-comfy seats. If you’re looking for more specific recom-
mendations, see Chapter 10 for dining, Chapter 12 for shopping, and
Chapter 15 for your nightlife options around here. Instead of reading
through the entries, start by looking at the maps, seeing what’s nearby,
and then going from there.
Day 3
Start your day by hopping on the Métro’s green line (direction Honoré
Beaugrand) and get off at Pie IX. You’ll spend the first part of today tour-
ing around the Olympic Village of the 1976 Summer Games. The Stade
Olympique, once home to Major League Baseball’s Montréal Expos, was
built by French architect Roger Tallibert, at a cost of over C$1 billon,
which Montréal taxpayers just finished paying off in 2006. The “Big O,”
as it is known among sports fans (or the “Big Owe” among its critics),
has a tower that is the world’s tallest leaning structure. (Take that,
people in Pisa!) It was designed as a crane to retract the stadium’s roof
but the idea never really worked. There’s an observatory with great
views of the city’s skyline at the top and you can tour the stadium,
which remains a daring architectural feat.
The Biodome de Montréal, in an adjacent building, amounts to an
indoor zoo. You can walk through different ecosystems. The penguins
are everyone’s favorite.
Depending on what you want to do for lunch you can either grab a snack
from the concessions on-site or head downtown for something more
meal-oriented. From Olympic Stadium in the east end you’re not really
close to anything, so find something in Chapter 10 that sounds appealing
and head there.
A reason to stay in the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium would be a visit
to the Jardins Botanique, which is a peaceful green space, with over
22,000 species of plants. On the grounds of the Botanical Gardens is the
Insectarium, which can be “cool” or “gross” depending on which kid you
ask. Every second year they have “insect tastings,” which allows overly
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 165

curious visitors to eat specially prepared insects. Dishes in the past
years included Atta ants in a tortilla, roasted crickets served on a
cucumber canapé and bruschetta with olive tapenade and bamboo
worms (I’m not kidding).
After lunch, a choice: two more museums or a hike up “The Mountain” 
in Parc Mont-Royal. The hike is an alternate outdoor activity, say, if you
didn’t already go to the Botanical Gardens. The two museums to round
out your three days of attractions are the Musée McCord d’Historie
Canadienne (Métro McGill) and the Musée d’Art Contemporain (Métro
Place-des-Arts), both downtown and within a short walk of each other.
To get to the top of “The Mountain,” start at the Monument Sir George-
Étienne Cartier (for its exact location see the directions and map in the
“Brunch, Tam-tams, and Beyond” itinerary later in this chapter), and
follow the gravel paths to the top. You’ll eventually reach the summit
with a lookout and a chalet.
Montréal in Five Days
So you’ve fallen in love and decided to postpone your return, at least for
a couple of days. Or, for whatever reason, you just have more time, here’s
are another two days’ worth of suggested ways to go about seeing the
best of Montréal.
Remember, many of these activities are interchangeable on different
days. Mix-and-match the mornings and afternoons that suit you best. 
Or, return to your favorite places several times.
Day 4
By now you should have your bearings, you can begin to explore further
into the city or circle back for a double-take, looking for things you
missed or want to see again. You may have certain morning rituals, a
favorite place for coffee or a bakery where you like to start your day.
Today, when you’re ready to go, head to Marché Jean Talon (Métro:
Jean-Talon), for a morning stroll through the busy aisles lined by chatty
merchants behind bountiful stalls of fruits and vegetables. Don’t miss
the cheese shops and gourmet boutiques in the surrounding buildings
and streets. It’s a hive of activity and a feast for the senses.
When you’re done exploring the different corners of the market, take a
walk, south, down boulevard St-Laurent. This is the main strip of the
Little Italy neighborhood, between rues Jean Talon and Beaubien.
There’s a high concentration of cafes, gourmet shops, fashion boutiques,
and stores selling imported shoes, all with an Italian flair.
Around lunch, some good options are Boucherie Jos & Basile and
Pizzeria Napolitana, or stop in for an espresso at Café Italia.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
166

This afternoon, perhaps consider one of the options you missed on 
Day 3: the McCord museum, the Montréal Museum of Contemporary Art,
or a hike up “The Mountain”. If you choose the latter, be sure to stock a
backpack with goods from the Jean Talon market for a spontaneous,
mid-afternoon picnic.
If you’re looking for a kid-friendly activity, head to the Vieux for the
IMAX Theatre and the Centre des Sciences de Montréal.
Any of these afternoon activities will leave you well placed to make your
way to Chinatown for dinner. Kung Kee on rue de la Gauchetière is a
great bet. Also look for the stall, on the south side, just east of rue Clark,
selling “Dragon Beard” candy. “Bubble tea” is a neighborhood curiosity:
It’s tea, hot or cold, flavored and served with tapioca beads in the
bottom, which are the “bubbles.” L2 Lounge, 71A rue de la Gauchetière
Est, is an Internet cafe and youth hangout, and it’s where to go for this
sweet delicacy.
After dinner, how about a night of big money and high stakes at the
Casino de Montréal? It’s on the Île Notre-Dame, so a cab is probably 
your best bet at this point in the evening. The casino is open 24 hours 
so you can also go after the bars close, depending on your habits. From
Chinatown head north to the boulevard St-Laurent and rue Prince Arthur
hub for frenzied nightlife action or south to Vieux-Montréal where the
bars are more intimate and sedate, for a more tranquil evening.
If gambling’s not your thing, but you’re still a sporting type, you may
want to catch a game with one of Montréal’s professional sports teams.
The Montréal Canadiens are by far the most popular, so tickets are the
most difficult to come by (on short notice try the scalpers outside the
Bell Center). The Montréal Alouettes (football) and Impact (soccer) also
have legions of fans. Join in cheering on the home team or support the
visiting team at your own risk.
Day 5
So it’s your last day in town? It’s time to get down to the essentials. What
quintessential experiences are you missing: Have you been to Schwartz’s
for a smoked meat sandwich? Café Olympico for a café au lait? Have you
tried the bagels from St-Viateur Bakery? Did you stroll the cobblestoned
streets of Vieux-Montréal? The boardwalk of the Vieux-Port? If it’s a
Sunday, you must drop by Tam-tams in Parc Mont Royal. Whatever festi-
val is going on during your stay, did you catch any of the free program-
ming? Shopping on rue St-Denis? Have you sat on one of the crowded
outdoor terraces for the always-busy cinq à sept, the after-work cocktail
hours? Jello Bar or Salon Daome on a Thursday night? Did you splurge
at a supper club, yet? If you’re missing any of these, please add them to
your to-do list.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 167

If you feel your Montréal experience is complete, head for the hills on a
day trip to the outlying regions, the Laurentians or Eastern Townships.
In the winter, these are both popular destinations for skiers and snow-
boarders alike; in the summer, mountain-bikers and hikers abound.
Many of the ski hills are within an hour’s drive of Montréal. There are
also coach buses from the Station Centrale that offer round-trips to the
most popular ones.
Nearby Ottawa and Québec City are also two good options for day trips.
Both are significantly smaller than Montréal so you can cover a lot of
ground, seeing the major attractions, in a single day. For art lovers,
Ottawa’s National Gallery of Canada is often worth the trip alone.
Francophiles who want to get deeper into the French-speaking part of
the province can opt for Québec City.
Connecting with Your French Roots
The term “two solitudes” describes coexisting universes of English 
and French in the province of Québec — and the abyss between them.
Despite anyone’s best efforts toward bilingualism in Montréal, two sepa-
rate camps remain. They are not exclusive clubs, but they remain dis-
tinct for their differing senses of humor and ways of living the city life.
Assuming you’re more comfortable in English than in French, you’re
going to experience the city as an Anglophone (English speaker). But
keep in mind, there’s a whole Francophone (French-speaking) world out
there, with its own politicians, city officials, celebrities, rock stars,
hockey players, biker gangs, talk radio, newspaper tabloids, sitcoms,
music videos, and workplace humor.
You can visit Montréal and remain blissfully unaware of the French
around you, partly because everyone in the service and tourism indus-
tries speaks very passable, if not impeccable, English. There’s also
plenty of English spoken around town, and most menus are bilingual.
But, at any one time, the majority of the Montréalers surrounding you
(over 60 percent) are French speaking and lead somewhat different lives
from the English minority.
After Paris, Montréal is the second-largest French-speaking city in the
world, so it stands to reason that there’s plenty going on in French as
well. This itinerary is a gentle introduction to Montréal’s French side,
guiding you on a stroll among the many shoppers and denizens on the
Plateau’s main commercial streets. There are no real destinations along
the way, just suggested landmarks to guide your journey.
If you’re a true Francophile (lover of all things French) and want to
dabble further in this part of the city’s cultural calendar, try to decipher
the listings in either of the two free French weeklies, Voir and Ici, which
come out on Thursdays. Their English counterparts, the Mirror and the

Hour, also list some of the Francophone community’s events, but they
are not as thorough.
Most of this itinerary runs along the orange line of the Métro, between
Mont-Royal and Champs-de-Mars stations. You can use it at your discre-
tion to get between the most interesting parts of the different segments I
describe. You can walk this whole route quickly, in about two hours, or
stretch it out into an afternoon and evening.

Starting at the Mont-Royal Métro station, turn right and walk along the
central artery of the trendy Plateau neighborhood, once a hotbed for
bohemian artists and now a hot real-estate market and shopping district.
Avenue Mont-Royal is packed with every kind of merchant imaginable.
Small, locally owned businesses rule the blocks. Used-book and -CD
stores, designer-clothing boutiques, small grocers, health-food shops,
salons, outdoor-sports outfitters, bakeries, restaurants, cafes, and bars
all cater to the locals, who justifiably feel that they are in the center of it
all. Meander until you’ve had your fill and then return in the direction of
the Métro.
Continue past the Mont-Royal Métro station and pause on the corner 
of rue St-Denis. If you’re into vintage clothing, you may want to make a
detour at this point by continuing straight on avenue Mont-Royal, past
rue St-Denis. For several blocks up a slight grade, shops on both sides of
the street sell retro clothing and some of their own designs.
Depending on the hour, this may also be time for refreshment. Both bars
I recommend here are typically French Montréal but completely differ-
ent. The first spot represents a somewhat dated mentality in Montréal,
while the second is all about Montréal today. Le Quai des Brumes,
located around the corner on the left at 4481 rue St-Denis (% 514-
499-0467), is a smoky and dark place festering with anti-Federalist senti-
ment and known as a hangout for staunch, but graying, separatists. Do
try to start a conversation, but I suggest not opening with a line about
the late, former Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau. Bily Kun, 354
av. Mont-Royal Est (% 514-845-5392), is a block to the west. It’s popu-
lated with good-looking but casual 20- and 30-somethings, engaged in
animated chatter over microbrewery beer and light snacks. Ostrich-head
trophies high on the walls overlook the scene.
Back on rue St-Denis, you’re faced with a similar scene to where this walk
started on Mont-Royal, but the storefronts are glitzier, the foot traffic
heavier, and the pace faster. It goes on at this rate for 4 long city blocks.
At the bottom of this strip, there’s a break in the action, but soon, on
your right, you see the illuminated yellow sign of Restaurant Lafleurs,
3620 rue St-Denis (% 514-848-1804) — the place to sample poutine, a
local delicacy of French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. Lafleurs is the
benchmark for all poutines.
Poutine, while delicious, is best consumed in small quantities. Finishing 
a small poutine at Lafleurs is a feat in itself. Sharing is probably a good
idea. Do not order the familiale size — ever, under any circumstances.
If the weather is pleasant, you may as well ask for your poutine to go and
enjoy it in nearby Carré St-Louis, where 19th-century town houses sur-
round and enhance an already beautiful square with a multilayered, bird-
bath fountain as its core. Benign loafers of all kinds hang out on the
benches and on the ledge of the fountain.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
170

Continue south on rue St-Denis. After crossing rue Sherbrooke, you
descend into the Quartier Latin. I suggest you plan your arrival for the
early evening, after the shops close on upper St-Denis. That’s when the
night starts to get going in the streets below, surrounding the Université
de Québec à Montréal (UQAM). The neighborhood’s central location
makes it a favorite destination for locals heading out for libations. It is
jammed with choices, but the Bar St-Sulpice, 1680 rue St-Denis (% 514-
844-9458), is the most popular place to meet up for pitchers of beer or
sangria, particularly in the summer, when the bar opens its immense
back patio.
At this point, you may want to take the Métro at the Berri-UQAM station.
The entrance is just a bit farther down rue St-Denis on the same side,
just across boulevard Maisonneuve. You take it for only one stop, to
Champs-de-Mars, but the walk isn’t scenic — actually, it’s a bit of a hike,
and it goes through something of a no-man’s land. Plus, you may be feel-
ing a tad sluggish after all that poutine. If you still want to walk, keep
going straight down St-Denis for several blocks until you come to rue
Notre-Dame, and turn left.
Out of the Champs-de-Mars Métro station, follow the arrows to Vieux-
Montréal, walk up the hill to rue Notre-Dame, and turn right.
On the right, you pass City Hall, and on the left is Place Jacques-Cartier,
which bustles in the summer with street performers and bands of
tourists. Cross the square diagonally and aim for 2 blocks down, at rue
St-Paul. A couple of doors farther west, you hit your final destination. By
now it should be late at night, and Les Deux Pierrots, 104 rue St-Paul Est
(% 514-861-1270), is in full swing. This is a traditional boîte à chansons,
where legions of French Montréalers gather to sing and clap along to
Québec folk favorites. The songs won’t be familiar, but they’re catchy
nonetheless. You’ll be tapping your feet in no time, but it may take you
considerably longer to learn the lyrics.
The English Establishment
The historic conflict between the French and English in Québec was 
not only about two separate languages, religions, and identities, but 
also about two social classes. After 1759, when the English took over
Montréal and the city began to industrialize, an increasing divide grew
between the blue-collar French and the white-collar English. By the
1800s and early into the next century, much of Canada’s wealth was 
concentrated in the Golden Square Mile, what’s now the western part
of Montréal’s downtown.
Canada’s post-industrial economy has gone a long way toward leveling
the playing field, but the stately, 19th-century, gray stone town houses of
the Golden Square Mile have thankfully stood the test of time and can be
seen in and among the city’s modern office buildings.

Begin at the corner of avenue McGill-College and rue Ste-Catherine
(Métro: McGill), one of the downtown’s major intersections. McGill
College is usually the recipient of the city’s best landscaping efforts,
including outdoor photo exhibits in the summer and millions of white
Christmas lights during the winter.
Walk north up the slight grade on avenue McGill-College; at the top you
see huge wrought-iron gates. Along the way, on the right-hand side of the
street, you pass a sculpture that looks like it’s made out of butter. The
numerous near life-size figures stand together making up The Illuminated
Crowd, a 1979 sculpture by Raymond Mason.

At the top of the street, you’re at the main entrance to McGill University,
a gated campus and a serene and scenic retreat, right in the downtown
core. You’re welcome to go in and walk around. Go up the central drive,
which comes to a fork after the playing field. Hang a left. The building on
your right is the Musée Redpath. Admission is free.
From the museum, continue traveling in the same direction (west)
through a smaller set of gates. Turn left, down rue McTavish, and walk
past the university’s student union and bookstore.
At rue Sherbrooke, turn right. Then take a left at the first light, onto rue
Peel. The red-brick building that dominates the right-hand side of the
block is the Montréal Amateur Athletic Association. Now a posh sports
club, it’s a holdover of the era of English-speaking private men’s clubs.
Almost at the end of the next block is the Seagram House, a 1929 castle-
like structure and former headquarters of the Bronfman family, who
built a liquor empire during Prohibition.
Brunch, Tam-tams, and Beyond
Summer Sundays are still sacred in Montréal but are no longer a strictly
Catholic affair. The day’s main events are brunch (whenever) and Tam-
tams, an all-afternoon drum-circle with dancers and a hippie crafts
market at the Monument Sir George-Étienne Cartier at the foot of 
Mont-Royal.
Weekend brunch spots do brisk business on Saturday and Sunday. Most
places serve breakfast specials until late in the afternoon, so there’s
absolutely no rush to get out of bed. And no one does. You see plenty 
of mussy-haired, rosy-cheeked couples grinning sleepily at each other
and their menus.
This itinerary begins on rue Bernard in Mile End. From downtown, hop
on bus 80 at Place-des-Arts Métro, heading north up avenue du Parc.
After brunching at one of the hidden spots I recommend, you crisscross
avenue du Parc several times as you explore its cross streets, while
working your way south. You end up amid the masses in Parc Mont-
Royal. The city blocks in between are particularly long in this part of
town, but the route is really not that far. At any point, you can catch bus
80 going south to get between the different stops I suggest.
Ideally, attempt this itinerary on a sunny Sunday, beginning by late
morning or in the early afternoon, before scoring breakfast. You can
even follow this route on a Saturday or on weekends during the winter,
but no one will be beating drums at the last stop.
Start by taking bus 80 up avenue du Parc to rue Bernard. You’ll be in
front of the Théâtre Rialto, 5723 av. du Parc, with its striking Art
Nouveau facade and marquee. Take your pick of excellent brunch

choices along rue Bernard: You can turn right and go a block to the east
to the Brazilian Restaurant Senzala, 177 rue Bernard Ouest (% 514-274-
1464), for a tropical brunch. I like the Tropicana: poached eggs in avo-
cado or mango halves topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese,
served with fried plantains and grilled fruit. Or, from the starting point 
in front of the Rialto, turn left and go west to Café Souvenir, 1261 rue
Bernard Ouest (% 514-948-5259), which is several blocks down. Its
menu is clever: Within each item are more choices, allowing you to cus-
tomize, to a certain extent, what will appear on your breakfast plate. It’s

a small, neighborhood spot that also harks of faraway destinations,
because dioramas of European capitals adorn the walls. During the
summer, the seating spills out onto a sidewalk terrace.
After your nth refill of coffee, make your way back to the intersection of
rue Bernard and avenue du Parc. Turn south on avenue du Parc and
walk toward downtown.
At the next intersection, avenue St-Viateur, you find Le Petit Milos, 5551
av. du Parc (% 514-274-9991), a gourmet shop selling Greek specialty
items, like fine olive oils. Around the corner, to the left, is St-Viateur
Bagels, 263 av. St-Viateur Ouest (% 514-276-8044). Although food may
be the farthest thing from your imagination after a big brunch, tasting
one of this bakery’s famous bagels, fresh out of the oven, is a must — at
least, I strongly suggest it. If you can’t do another bite, pick some up for
a light picnic that you’ll unveil at Tam-tams, the last stop along your
route.
You can also find lots of small shops farther along avenue St-Viateur, on
both sides of the street. At the next corner, Epicerie Latina, 185 av. St-
Viateur Ouest (% 514-273-6561), is a gourmet grocery store, specializ-
ing in Italian ingredients. The market has produce as well as butcher 
and cheese counters. If you’re even slightly curious about any of their
cheeses, the grocer slices you off a sample taste.
At this point, you may already be saturated with coffee and seeking a
bathroom, instead of looking for more. But if you can stand another cup,
the coffee at Café Olympico, 185 av. St-Viateur Ouest (% 514-273-6561),
is as good as it gets in Montréal. The scene there is worth taking in, if
only for a moment.
Now, turn back and walk a block toward avenue du Parc. Turn left, going
south along avenue de l’Esplanade. The town houses on this street are
some of the prettiest and most typical in the neighborhood. When you
reach the next street, avenue Fairmount, jog to your right, by turning
first to the right, and then immediately to the left, continuing down rue
Jeanne-Mance, until avenue Laurier.
This street, to the east and west of avenue du Parc is an upscale shop-
ping district, with clothing boutiques, cafes, restaurants, and magazine
and video stores, mainly at the service of the sedate and upscale clien-
tele who putter in from the uber-affluent neighborhood of Outremont.
It’s where they go when they don’t want to fight the traffic and riffraff
downtown.
If you’re coming all the way from rue Bernard, you can window-shop
along avenue Laurier to your heart’s content. You can also locate several
brunch options around here, offering an abridged version of this itiner-
ary. You’ll be right beside Pâtisserie De Gascogne, 237 av. Laurier Ouest
(% 514-490-0235), a French bakery with bread, pastries, a coffee bar,
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 175

and seating. Across the street, Toi Moi et Café, 244 av. Laurier Ouest 
(% 514-369-1150), roasts its own coffees and serves a brunch menu
that’s consistently good.
When you’re ready to leave avenue Laurier, head south along avenue du
Parc, once again. After 3 blocks, you come to avenue Mont-Royal (“The
Mountain”) on your right. A bit farther, beyond the lights, you come to
the Sunday ritual of Tam-tams, which has grown to such an extent that
tour buses now stop to gawk.
Beginning at 2 p.m., drummers and percussionists from all over Montréal
converge on the Monument Sir George-Étienne Cartier, on avenue du
Parc at the foot of “The Mountain” — you’re in Parc Mont-Royal. After
they begin, their beats roll up “The Mountain’s” slopes and drone on for
the rest of the afternoon. A crowd of dancers forms in front of them, and
the whole thing gathers momentum. People keep coming from every
direction armed with blankets, Frisbees, dogs — the works — and they
set up camp on the grassy hills surrounding the monument, which are all
within earshot of the incessant drums. It is a veritable circus, and every-
one gets in on the act, including children. Out on the fringes, there’s even
a group of Dungeons and Dragons kids whacking each other with foam
and duct-tape swords.

Chapter 14
Going Beyond Montréal:
Three Day-trips
In This Chapter
 Stretching your legs beyond the city limits
 Visiting Ottawa, the nation’s capital
 Day-tripping into rural Québec
“P
aris is Paris, but it’s not France,” goes the French expression.
The same holds true for Montréal, which is not quite represen-
tative of the rest of the province of Québec. Montréal is Babylon by com-
parison. Beyond the bright lights of the big city, the province of Québec
is a vast landscape, at times rural, at times rugged, dotted with many
charming small towns, whose inhabitants are, by and large, French
speaking, and where hockey and Catholicism are still the predominant
religions.
Depending on how much time you have, you may want to escape
Montréal and explore its surrounding regions. A jaunt into the hills of
the countryside can be especially magical from late September to mid-
October, when the leaves change colors. Ditto for anytime it snows,
although the driving can be treacherous in heavy snowfall.
Of course, the first place you want to check out after Montréal is Québec
City (see Part IV of this book). And it’s doable in a day. You may want to
stay longer, though; Québec City is perfect for an overnight visit — very
romantic. I strongly recommend fitting this historic capital into your
travel itinerary, if at all possible. It’s very different from Montréal.
In this chapter, I present three other trips you can do in a day. For each, I
also provide lodging information, should you decide to stay overnight. All
three trips are between an hour and two hours by highway from Montréal.
For the first day-trip to Ottawa, you can get there by bus, train, or air-
plane, but renting a car is probably the most practical route. You don’t
need a car, however, because taxis and an extensive bus system can get
you around. For the other two more rural destinations, a car is also the
best option — for mobility’s sake.

Ottawa, the Nation’s Capital
Ottawa is so Canadian. After all, it’s the nation’s capital. But Ottawa,
which is in the province of Ontario, is completely different from
Montréal and more like the rest of Canada. The difference is palpable.
Getting there
By car, Ottawa is about two hours, or 190km (118 miles), away from
Montréal. Be sure to get an early start, especially if you’re visiting only
for the day. From Montréal, travel west on Autoroute 40, which runs
along the top of the Island of Montréal. Stay on the 40 until the 417,
which goes to Hull and Ottawa.
When you’re in Ottawa proper, take exit 119, Metcalfe Street, and follow
it as it twists and turns to the downtown area. After several blocks, the
street ends smack in front of Parliament Hill, Ottawa’s crown jewel and
the seat of Canada’s legislature.
Seeing the sights
Across from the Parliament Buildings is a tourist information center
called the Capital Infocentre, 90 Wellington St. (% 800-465-1867; www.
canadascapital.gc.ca). It’s open daily 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. from May to
September, and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. the rest of the year. The people at the
center can help you round out the recommendations I provide here.
Because you’re in Ottawa only for a short visit, don’t feel pressured to
see everything. In this section, I include the best of the Canadian capital,
which makes for a full day of sightseeing. Ottawa’s downtown is small,
compact, and ideal for walking around. And you may be surprised by
how much of the city you can cover on foot.
Ottawa’s main attraction is Parliament Hill, 1 Wellington St. (% 613-
239-5000; www.parl.gc.ca), set on a bluff overlooking the Ottawa
River. It is mecca for civic-minded Canadians and an interesting window
into the nation’s inner workings.
You can take a free, half-hour guided tour, which runs throughout the
day. For a self-guided tour, pick up the “Discovering the Hill” booklet.
Take the elevator to the top of the Peace Tower for a 360-degree view 
of the city and the Ottawa River.
On the grounds during the summer, you find plenty going on. At 10 a.m.,
a Changing of the Guard ceremony with dapper and unflappable sol-
diers in fur hats is just like the ones in England! By night, you can watch
free sound and light shows. To the left of the central Parliament Building
and behind the library is a peculiar cat sanctuary. And when parliament
is in session (about 137 days per year), you can attend question-and-
answer periods in the public galleries of either the Senate or the House
of Commons.

Sparks Street runs parallel to Wellington Street and is a block south of
Parliament Hill. It’s a pedestrian mall with plenty of shops, boutiques,
restaurants, and bars. During the summer, many Sparks Street establish-
ments open sidewalk terraces. If you feel so inclined, a walking tour of
the mall departs from the intersection of Elgin and Sparks every Saturday
at 2 p.m. It lasts an hour and a half and costs C$5 (US$4.25).
Just east of Parliament Hill are the Ottawa Locks, which make up the
north entrance of the Rideau Canal. The waterway, built in 1827, starts
with eight flights of locks and runs all the way to Kingston on Lake
Ontario. Originally built for strategic purposes and employed mainly as
a trading route, the canal is now an 11km (63⁄4-mile) parkland that runs
through the city like a ribbon. In the winter, it becomes the world’s
longest ice rink, and office workers and students alike use it to skate 
to work and class.
The Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography, 1 Rideau Canal
(% 613-990-8257; http://cmcp.gallery.ca), housed in a recon-
structed railway tunnel, displays photos from its large permanent collec-
tion and also hosts traveling exhibitions. The museum’s own collection
spans from the 1960s to the present. Admission is free.
The striking National Gallery of Canada, 380 Sussex Dr. (% 613-990-
1985; www.gallery.ca), opened in 1988. The glass and granite structure
was designed by Moshe Safdie, the same architect behind Montréal’s
Habitat ’67 and the Museum of Fine Arts. Light shafts and reflective
panels make the most of natural light, which floods into the galleries, but
in a way that’s doesn’t damage the art. The long, inclined walkway to the
Grand Hall, an impressive landmark on its own, provides a dramatic view
of the Parliament Buildings above the churning Ottawa River. The gallery
has the country’s most extensive collection of Canadian art, but it also
features important works by artists from other countries and from peri-
ods throughout the ages.
Between Parliament Hill and the National Gallery and to the east of
Sussex Drive is the ByWard Market (% 613-244-4410; www.byward-
market.com) area. A two-story market building, formerly a farmers’
market, is at the center of this neighborhood. The surrounding streets 
of 19th-century brick-and-stone buildings are filled with trendy shops,
restaurants, pubs, and bars. During the summer, vendors at all kinds of
outdoor stalls hawk their wares, while street performers do their thing.
Across the Alexandra Bridge — that is, over the Ottawa River and back
in Québec province — is the Canadian Museum of Civilization, 100 rue
Laurier (% 800-555-5621 or 819-776-7000; www.civilization.ca),
housed in a futuristic, riverfront building. The permanent exhibits cele-
brate Canada’s aboriginal people and the evolution of this young coun-
try. Extensive artifacts are on display from native Canadian cultures; of
special note is the Grand Hall, which features 43 authentic totem poles
from the West Coast. Other exhibits document various aspects of
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
180

Canada’s history, culture, and development. Also on premise are an
IMAX theater and a children’s museum with “hands-on” displays.
For something completely different, you can try your luck at the Casino
du Lac Leamy, 1 bd. du Casino (% 800-665-2274; www.casino-du-lac-
leamy.com). Also in Québec province, it’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 
4 a.m. To get there from downtown Ottawa, take the Macdonald-Cartier
Bridge, which becomes Highway 5, and get off at Exit 3.
Where to stay
You may decide to have dinner in Ottawa, and dinner may turn into
drinks. Suddenly, staying the night seems like a clever idea. Here are my
choices for accommodations. All are centrally located, close to the
places you’re touring.
The Fairmont Château Laurier, 1 Rideau St. (% 800-441-1414 or 613-
241-1414; www.fairmont.com), adjacent to the Rideau Canal and steps
away from Parliament Hill, is the city’s grandest hotel, in the same tradi-
tion as the Château Frontenac in Québec City and the Queen Elizabeth in
Montréal. The Lord Elgin Hotel, 100 Elgin St. (% 800-267-4298 or 613-
235-3333; www.lordelginhotel.ca), overlooks Confederation Park in
downtown Ottawa, which is home to many seasonal events like the Jazz
Festival. Les Suites Hotel, 130 Besserer St. (% 800-267-1989 or 613-232-
2000; www.les-suites.com), offers a few more amenities than the aver-
age hotel room and is adjacent to Rideau Centre’s 180 shops as well as
the restaurants of the ByWard Market area. The Carmichael Inn & Spa,
46 Cartier St. (% 613-236-4667; www.carmichaelinn.com), is a heritage
home in a quiet neighborhood, but it’s still close to the action and offers
spa treatments. Lastly, Novotel Ottawa, 33 Nicholas St. (% 800-668-
6835 or 613-230-3033; www.novotelottawa.com), is a sure bet. This 
outpost of the French hotel chain is centrally located. In the typical
European tradition, the rooms are efficient and compact but appointed
for its business-traveler clientele.
Where to dine 
If you’re looking for a place to eat, here’s the insider track. In 2003,
Beckta Dining and Wine, 226 Nepean St. (% 613-238-7063), ranked 
as the fourth-best new restaurant in Canada in a biannual survey by
EnRoute Magazine. It’s the first Ottawa restaurant to break the top ten.
Beckta serves seasonal cuisine in a modern and intimate setting. MTL &
Co., 47/49 William St. (% 613-241-6314), seems like a fitting recommen-
dation, given that MTL is short for Montréal, and true to its name, the
restaurant becomes a lively club after dinner. On the menu are reason-
ably priced fusion dishes. Savana Café, 431 Gilmour St. (% 613-233-
9159), serves dishes inspired by the traditional ingredients of the
Caribbean and the Pacific Rim.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Montréal: Three Day-trips 181

The Laurentian Mountains
For the quickest and easiest day-trip around Montréal, drive 45 minutes
north to the Laurentian Mountains. These are rolling hills, not breathtak-
ing peaks, but the Laurentians are impressive all the same.
Getting there
The Laurentian Highway, or Autoroute 15, takes you directly to the
Laurentians and gives you the scenic route to boot. You can reach
Autoroute 15 by driving north from downtown Montréal (along boule-
vard St-Laurent is fine) and catching Autoroute 40 West (you drive about
ten minutes until the Autoroute 15 interchange). Then follow signs to 
St-Jérôme. Autoroute 15 takes you through some urban sprawl for about
15 minutes, but the scenery is pretty after that.
If you have a little extra time, exit at St-Jérôme and pick up old Route 
117. St-Jérôme is a small town with a quaint main street, a couple of pubs,
and some gifts and craft shops. It’s remarkable more so for its charm
than its substance. This takes you to the village of Ste-Agathe des Monts
and through some typical older towns of the region along the way.
A good visitor information center covering the Laurentians area is in 
St-Jérôme: La Maison du Tourisme des Laurentides, 14142 rue de la
Chapelle (% 800-561-6673 or 450-436-5309; www.laurentides.com).
Take Exit 39 off Autoroute 15 and follow the signs. The tourist office is in
a red-roofed stone cottage. It’s open daily in the summer from 8:30 a.m.
to 8:30 p.m.; from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the rest of the year.
Orleans Express buses leave regularly from Montréal’s Central Bus
Station, 505 bd. de Maisonneuve (% 888-999-3977 or 514-842-2281),
with stops at Ste-Agathe, Ste-Adèle, St-Jovite, and Mont-Tremblant. 
For schedules, call the bus station or visit www.orleansexpress.com.
The express bus to Ste-Adèle takes about an hour and a half; the trip to
St-Jovite and Mont-Tremblant takes about two hours.
Seeing the sights
The Laurentians boast a number of interesting villages; each one can be
a day-trip in itself, depending on what you want to do and how much
time you want to spend doing it. Driving from Montréal, your first stop is
Saint-Sauveur-des-Monts, a popular ski resort town with lots of restau-
rants and street activity. In summer, the water park, Parc Aquatique du
Mont-St-Sauveur, 350 rue St-Denis (% 800-363-2426 or 450-227-4671;
www.parcaquatique.com), is a popular attraction because of its wave
pool and mountain water slide.
Next stop is Ste-Adèle (Exit 67 off Route 117), a pretty village whose
main street, rue Valiquette, is lined with cafes, galleries, and bakeries.
The popular Chantecler ski resort here has 22 trails. For information,
call the town’s Centre Municipal at % 450-229-2921. For more downhill

skiing, continue along Route 117, and then take Route 327 to Mont-
Tremblant, the highest peak in the Laurentians and an hour-and-a-half
drive from Montréal. The commercial center that serves the area is St-
Jovite, whose main street, rue Ouimet, is lined with cafes and shops.
For information on skiing and summer activities in this popular resort
area, contact the Bureau Touristique de Mont-Tremblant on rue du
Couvent in Mont-Tremblant (% 819-425-2434).
Where to stay
Most of the accommodations in the Laurentians are resorts.
In Saint-Sauveur-des-Monts, the Relais St-Denis, 61 rue St-Denis (% 888-
997-4766 or 450-227-4766), offers quite luxurious rooms and suites with
fireplaces in a country club atmosphere, complete with a heated out-
door pool and a nearby golf course. The Manoir Saint-Sauveur, 246
chemin du Lac-Millet (% 800-361-0505 or 450-227-1811), is a large resort
hotel with year-round activities, including racquetball, squash, and in-
house movies.
In Ste-Adèle, the Hotel Alpine, 1440 chemin Pierre Péladeau (% 877-
257-4630 or 450-229-1545), offers different types of accommodations 
in rustic log structures with meals served at communal tables. The
Chantecler resort, 1474 chemin Chantecler (% 800-363-2420), has
rooms and suites, many with fireplaces and hot tubs.
Popular resorts in Mont-Tremblant include the deluxe motel Auberge La
Porte Rouge, 1874 chemin Principale (% 800-665-3505 or 819-425-3505),
with rooms to accommodate up to ten people, and Gray Rocks, 525
chemin Principale (% 800-567-6767 or 819-425-2771), a family-friendly
resort that offers horseback riding, boating, tennis, and golf.
Where to dine
Rue Principale in Saint-Sauveur-des-Monts has many restaurants. One 
of the best known is Les Oliviers, 239 rue Principale (% 450-227-2110),
which serves what you can probably call French country cuisine, includ-
ing beef, duck, and salmon dishes.
In Ste-Adèle, L’Eau à la Bouche, 3003 bd. Ste-Adèle (Route 117) (% 450-
229-2991), serves a changing menu with seasonal fish, meats, and veg-
etables, plus a selection of Québec cheeses.
In St-Jovite, try Antipasto, 855 rue Ouimet (% 819-425-7580), for Italian
cuisine, including individual pizzas cooked in a brick oven. For carefully
prepared traditional Québec cuisine, try La Table Enchantée, 600 Rte.
117 Nord (% 819-425-7113), considered one of the best dining spots in
the Laurentians area.
In Mont-Tremblant, Aux Truffes, 3035 rue Principale (% 819-681-4544),
serves upscale contemporary French cuisine.

The Eastern Townships
The Eastern Townships are one of Québec’s best-kept tourism secrets. 
A beautiful landscape of rolling hills, mountains, farms, and small vil-
lages, the area has several quaint villages that are frequented mainly 
by Québec tourists. Much of the townships were originally settled by
British loyalists who fled to the region during the Revolutionary War,
and although 90 percent of the people speak French as their first lan-
guage, you can see traces of English presence everywhere. Many towns
and villages have English names or names that combine the original
English name with that of a Catholic saint (given by the French-speakers
who later moved into the region).
For tourist information about the Eastern Townships, contact Tourism
Cantons-de-l’Est, 20 rue Don-Bosco Sud in Sherbrooke (% 800-355-5755;
www.cantonsdelest.com).
Getting there
To head to the townships, count on two hours of driving. I suggest visit-
ing either the small city of Magog (Lac Memphrémagog) or the quaint
village of North Hatley (Lac Massawippi), which is about half an hour
from Magog. Leave Montréal on the Champlain Bridge, which becomes
Autoroute 10. Then follow directions toward Sherbrooke. Autoroute 10
goes directly to Magog. If you want to get there along a more scenic
country road, leave the Autoroute 10 at Exit 37 and follow Route 112
East. To get to North Hatley, take Autoroute 108 east from Magog for
about 20 minutes.
Buses for Magog and Sherbrooke leave Montréal’s Central Bus Station,
505 bd. de Maisonneuve (% 888-999-3977 or 514-842-2281), roughly
every two hours during the week. Call for daily schedules.
Seeing the sights
Small and mainly industrial, the city of Magog is not where you want 
to spend a lot of time. Head straight to the waterfront area on Lac
Memphrémagog, with its cafes and bars. You can take a lake cruise
aboard the Aventure cruise ships. Call % 819-843-8068 for information
or contact the Bureau d’Information Touristique Memphrémagog at 
55 rue Cabana in Magog (% 800-267-2744 or 819-843-2744). Near Magog,
visit the popular provincial Parc National du Mont Orford, which offers
a golf course and 48km (30 miles) of skiing and hiking trails. To get there,
take Exit 115 north off the Autoroute 10. For information, call % 819-
843-9855. Admission is C$8.75 (US$7.50) for adults, C$6.50 (US$5.50) for
seniors, and C$4.25 (US$3.50) for children 6–17 years old.
North Hatley is a tiny, beautiful village on the shore of Lac Massawippi.
A former resort town for rich Americans, it is now the place well-to-do
Québeckers come to relax and buy paintings in the village’s many art
galleries. The village’s main street, rue Principale, is also full of cute

cafes, restaurants, and boutiques selling crafts and clothing. There
aren’t many tourist attractions here per se. Instead, people come here
for the exceptional atmosphere, beautiful lakefront scenery, and all-
’round New England feel. The Gallerie Jeanine Blais, 100 rue Principale
(% 819-842-2784), has lovely, fanciful folk art, and Au Grenier de Gife,
330 chemin de la Rivière (% 819-842-4440), sells painted furniture and
works by local artists.
Where to stay
Lodging in Magog is neither plentiful nor very nice. If you want to stay
the night, I suggest the Relais de l’Abbaye, 2705 chemin Gendreau 
(% 450-847-3721), a luxurious mansion-style guesthouse with elegant
rooms.
But you’ll probably be happier staying in North Hatley. Le Tricorne,
50 chemin Gosselin (% 819-842-2692; www.manoirletricorne.com), 
is an impeccably decorated, 125-year-old guesthouse. Rooms start at
about C$125 (US$106), and some include hot tubs. If you’re interested in
something more luxurious, the famous Auberge Hatley, 325 rue Virgin
(% 819-842-2451), has rooms decorated with antiques and cre com-
pleted with hot tubs and fireplaces; on-site is a gastronomic restaurant.
Serendipity, 680 chemin de la Rivière (% 819-842-2970), is a reasonably
priced B&B with nice views.
Where to dine
The upscale inns in North Hatley offer exceptional dining choices. The
Auberge Hatley serves fine, gourmet meals based on local ingredients
like duck, venison, and bison and has a wine cellar with more than 10,000
bottles. Table d’hôte (complete meal) menus start at C$60 (US$51). The
Auberge Ripplecove, 700 chemin Ripplecove (% 800-668-4296), has a
reputation for serving creative dishes based on local delicacies, like cari-
bou. For less expensive but still tasty food, Pilsen, 55 rue Principale 
(% 819-842-2971), has a publike atmosphere and serves quick food like
nachos, burgers, and pasta. This is a great place to indulge in a large
selection of locally brewed beers. Another good choice is the Café
Massawippi, 3050 chemin Capelton (% 819-842-4528), for inventive 
but reasonably priced meals.

Living It Up after Dark:
Montréal Nightlife
In This Chapter
 Watching performing arts for a dose of culture
 Figuring out where the beautiful people go at night
 Dancing the night away
 Hitting the right bars and clubs in the right order
I
n this chapter, I open the curtains on Montréal’s vibrant performing
arts scene. Montréal’s performing arts scene tends to be on the edgy
and daring side. I also organize the nightlife scene by category, giving
you my top choices for each type of nightlife pursuit, regardless of
where they’re located.
Applauding the Cultural Scene
Besides the many festivals, Montréal has a bevy of performing arts
troupes that put on shows during their annual seasons, which usually
run from the beginning of fall into the late spring. There’s cirque, theater,
symphony and opera, just to name a few of the most popular. Really,
these are only the tip of Montreal’s cultural iceberg.
Getting the inside scoop
The Montréal Gazette, the city’s only English daily newspaper, as well
as the Hour and the Mirror, two free English weeklies, cover the city’s
cultural calendar. These publications list films, art venues, events, music
shows, and more. The weekly publications come out on Thursday morn-
ings and preview the coming week. You can find them in the entrance-
ways of many boutiques, cafes, restaurants, and bars and in Montréal’s
neighborhoods.
Attending the performing arts these days is a surprisingly casual affair.
People seem to go in all sorts of dress — whatever makes them most
comfortable. You should, too, although you won’t be out of place if you
dress up for the occasion.

Although much of Montréal’s cultural scene is conducted in French, you
can find plenty in English; besides, music and dance need little transla-
tion. Check the free weekly newspapers for listings.
Raising the curtain on the performing arts
Deserving special mention, partly because it defies quick and easy cate-
gorization, is Québec’s own Cirque du Soleil (www.cirquedusoleil.
com), a performance spectacle under a big top, but eons and galaxies
beyond the corny entertainment that people sometimes associate with a
circus. Founded in Québec, now an international entertainment empire,
a Cirque du Soleil performance is a human zoo of acrobats, contortion-
ists, singers, dancers, and musicians all taking part in an elaborate fan-
tasy. Although the show tours the world, a troupe usually returns home
to Montréal every year in the spring.
Theater
Most of Canada’s English-language television and film productions, as
well as the Broadway musical performances, happen in Toronto. This
leaves Montréal’s Anglophone (English-speaking) actors to fill the roles
of the city’s small-scale, short-run stage productions. But this situation
can be a recipe for excellent theater. Before Mambo Italiano was a mod-
erately successful movie, it was a hit play in Montréal, written by a local
playwright.
Here are some of the best venues for Montréal theater today:
 Centaur Theatre Company, 453 rue St-François-Xavier, Vieux-
Montréal (% 514-288-3161), occupies a 1903 building, once the
city’s first stock exchange. Over the course of a season (end of
Sept–end of May), Montréal’s premier English-language theater
company presents several plays on its two stages, including pro-
ductions of modern classics, works of contemporary Canadian
playwrights, and foreign adaptations. Métro: Place-d’Armes.
 Geordie Theatre Productions (% 514-845-9810), a professional
children’s theater company, stages a season’s worth of kids clas-
sics. Intended for grade- and high-school audiences, the company’s
main stage is the D.B. Clarke Theatre, 1455 bd. de Maisonneuve
Ouest (% 514-848-4742), on Concordia University’s downtown
campus. Métro: Guy-Concordia.
 Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts, 5170 Côte Ste-Catherine,
West Montréal (% 514-739-2301), has a full season of plays that
runs from late fall to early summer. This multidisciplinary arts
center, which includes a gallery and fine-arts school, presents 
dramatic works from around the world, both contemporary and
modern. Métro: Côte-Ste-Catherine.
Chapter 15: Living It Up after Dark: Montréal Nightlife 189

Dance
Following is a selection of Montréal’s best dance offerings:
 L’Agora de la Danse, 840 rue Cherrier, Plateau (% 514-525-1500),
is a part of the Department of Dance at the Université de Québec à
Montréal (University of Québec at Montréal). Le Studio, its 256-seat
venue, is the center of Canada’s modern-dance community. Métro:
Sherbrooke.
 Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal, 3450 rue St-Urbain, fourth floor,
Plateau (% 514-982-6771), is a contemporary dance troupe that
tours internationally. Its reputation is solidly established for trans-
lating the latest artistic trends into dance. Métro: Place-des-Arts.
 Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal, 4816 rue Rivard 
(% 514-849-8681), produces four shows throughout its season 
and welcomes several visiting companies. The company adds fresh
choreography to this classic ballet. Métro: Laurier.
 Tangante, 840 rue Cherrier (% 514-525-5584), bills itself as inti-
mate laboratory theater. Dedicated to contemporary dance and
experimental performance art, Tangante attempts upward of 90
performance projects during its September-to-June season. Métro:
Sherbrooke.
Classical music and opera
Classical music and opera are the pinnacle of highbrow cultural con-
sumption. For some, the challenge is to stay awake; for the true connois-
seurs, it’s a waking dream. Consider the following options:
 L’Opera de Montréal, 260 bd. de Maisonneuve Ouest, Downtown
(% 514-985-2258), marries music, singing, plot, costumes, and 
set design in six elaborate productions per season. Métro: Place-
des-Arts.
 L’Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal (OSM), 260 bd. de
Maisonneuve Ouest, Downtown (% 514-842-9951), one of Canada’s
major orchestras, performs in the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier of the Place-
des-Arts. The OSM performs regularly at New York’s Carnegie Hall.
Métro: Place-des-Arts.
Hitting the Clubs and Bars
Whether you prefer a quiet cocktail at a jazz club or a night on the town
flitting from one hot spot to the next, Montréal delivers an awesome
nightlife — you can paint the town whatever color you choose. Activities
peak between Thursday and Sunday, but something’s always going down.
It all begins at quitting time on Thursday with the cinq à sept (the hours
from 5 to 7 p.m.), the unofficial opening ceremonies of the weekend,
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
190

when Montréal’s office workers flock to their favorite watering holes to
drink and snack, commiserate and socialize, and, of course, see and be
seen. The party then carries on in the bars, cafes, pubs, restaurants, live-
music venues, and dance clubs well into the night. Saturday is definitely
the pinnacle of Montréal’s frenzied nightlife activities. If it’s a long week-
end (a Monday holiday), concerts and all-night dance parties continue
on Sunday, too.
True to its Latin spirit, Montréal’s nocturnal activities start later and end
later than other cities in North America. Last call is at 3 a.m., so don’t be
surprised if the pace doesn’t really pick up until after 11 p.m. — many
people are just finishing dinner at that hour — and peak around 1 a.m.
Québec’s legal drinking age is 18.
So where are the city’s hot spots? Great spots are everywhere, but many
can be found on rue Crescent and boulevard St-Laurent, the city’s two
main nightlife strips. You don’t need to be excessively concerned about
safety in these neighborhoods. Montréal’s streets are relatively safe at
night, partly because so many people are out. Everyone’s very friendly,
as people tend to be after a drink or two.
The cost of a night out can vary greatly. Many bars and clubs charge a
cover, which ranges from C$5 to C$25 (US$4.25–US$21.25). Drinks can
cost anywhere from C$5 to C$8 (US$4.25–US$6.75), depending on how
snazzy the bar deems itself to be.
With four university campuses scattered around the downtown core,
students rule the night and set the tone. Everywhere you go, all night,
you’re bound to see packs of students staggering about. Don’t worry,
though. Few bars in Montréal cater exclusively to students, so you don’t
risk stumbling into a scene from Animal House.
In fact, stepping out in Montréal requires a touch of class. No one in
Montréal really dresses up at night, but people are still pretty chic on
the whole. You won’t see any baseball caps, fraternity sweatshirts, or
running shoes. Some places even enforce a dress code. If you’re not sure
what to wear, just don black.
In terms of music, rock is almost dead and DJs rule the city. But you can
find great live music if you like funk, jazz, world beat, Latin, bluegrass,
blues, or punk. A number of venues host big-name acts passing through
on the northeastern legs of their North American tours. The free week-
lies are the best place to find out about who’s playing where and when.
Heck, you can spend the night as a groupie.
NightLife, a free glossy magazine with articles in both English and
French, is also a good source. Each issue includes an exhaustive 
nightlife directory for the whole city, with a series of icons describing
each establishment.

Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
194

Also keep your eyes open for the events and acts advertised via guerilla
marketing techniques: flyers and posters littering the downtown core,
left on windshields, taped to poles, or pasted to the plywood barriers
surrounding a construction site. For environmental reasons, I don’t sanc-
tion them. But when you’re looking for the latest nightlife happenings,
they’re hard to beat.
Shaking your groove thing: The best dance clubs
The following sections list venues where the dance floor is the main
attraction.
The hottest clubs
DJs rule the night at these clubs, where the bold and beautiful clientele
dance the night away. So go ahead: Strut your stuff and make the scene.
 Blizzart, 3956-A bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-843-4860), is a
long, narrow spot that feels like a cafe and oozes with street-cred.
Each night of the week, local DJs play a different sound: dance hall,
reggae, drum ’n’ bass, and so on. Open: Daily 9 p.m.–3a.m. Cover:
Wed–Sat C$3–C$5 (US$2.50–US$4.25). Métro: Sherbrooke.
 Club 1234, 1234 rue de la Montagne, Downtown (% 514-395-1111),
pronounced twelve thirty-four, located in a beautiful Victorian man-
sion, is something of a phenomenon as of late. The main-room
dance floor is packed and sweaty. The drinks are expensive and 
the bouncers rude — yet no one seems to mind. In front, there’s a
lineup several people deep and it’s impossible to make sense of 
the chaos after 11 p.m. Forget it! You’re not getting in. To see the
mayhem unfold on the inside, arrive before 10:30. The clientele
seems to enjoy pitching stacks of napkins in the air like confetti —
how festive. By the end of the night, everyone’s wading through
them, almost ankle-deep. Open: Thurs–Sat 10 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover:
C$10–C$15 (US$8.50–US$12.75). Métro: Peel.
 At Funkytown, 1454 rue Peel, Downtown (% 514-282-8387), an
older clientele gathers to reminisce to a medley of remixed disco
classics. When a ’70s anthem plays, everyone rushes to the dance
floor, where they sing along at the top of their lungs. Open: Fri–Sat
10 p.m.–3.a.m. Cover: C$6–C$8 (US$5–US$6.75). Métro: Peel.
 Mile End Bar, 5322 bd. St-Laurent, Mile End (% 514-279-0200), north
of the main St-Laurent strip, has become a fixture of Thursday’s cinq
à sept landscape. Droves of flirting office workers, fresh from a hard
day on the job, jam the bar downstairs. The action later moves to 
the nightclub upstairs, where there’s a lofted seating area and a sus-
pended catwalk. Open: Thurs–Fri 5 p.m.–3 a.m., Sat 7 p.m.–3 a.m.
Cover: Usually C$5 (US$4.25) Fri–Sat. Métro: Laurier.
 Salon Daome, 141 av. Mont Royal Ouest, Plateau (% 514-282-8777),
is an upstairs hideaway for lovers of funky and soulful music. The
second-floor loft space feels more like an apartment than a nightclub,
Chapter 15: Living It Up after Dark: Montréal Nightlife 195

but it gets packed nonetheless. Tuesdays are a happening tech-
house night, if you’re looking for somewhere to go at the beginning
of the week. Wednesdays are salsa. Thursdays through Saturdays 
a DJ spins funk, rare groove, and Afro-Latin-influenced sounds.
Occasionally someone beats on a jembe as accompaniment. Open:
Tues–Sat 8 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: C$5–C$10 (US$4.25–US$8.50). Métro:
Mont-Royal.
 Society of Art and Technology (SAT), 1195 bd. St-Laurent, Quartier
Latin (% 514-844-2033), is the leader of the underground music
scene. Its main room features video projections that play along
with the music. The SAT often hosts parties in association with
new-media, and also hosts music, festivals, and events, which
makes nights here varied and eclectic, as is the clientele. The
schedule is erratic, but there is usually something going on. Call 
or check its Web site (www.sat.qc.ca). Métro: St-Laurent.
 Time Supper Club, 997 rue St-Jacques, Downtown (% 514-392-
9292), is wildly popular after dinner, when the chairs are cleared
from the main floor and everybody gets up to dance. The party car-
ries on at a feverish pace, as people crowd the bar, mingle in the
walkways, and take turns dancing on the island in the middle of the
dining room. Open: Thurs–Sat 7 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: C$20 (US$17).
Métro: Bonaventure.
 Zoobizare, 6388 St-Hubert, Rosemont (% 514-270-9331), is a
recent addition to Montréal’s nightlife map in the northern reaches
of the city. If you’re into a kitsch brand of cool, it’s worth the trek
for electro clash and synth punk sounds. On the second floor,
above some stores, is a stone-walled room with arched ceilings. It
feels like a wine cellar or a dungeon and makes for an offbeat set-
ting. It’s actually the reincarnation of a bar in Bordeaux, France.
Open: Thurs–Sat 9 p.m.–3 a.m.; schedule varies during the rest of
the week. Cover: C$5–C$10 (US$4.25–US$8.50). Métro: Jean Talon.
Salsa, swing, and tango
Ever since disco bottomed out in the ’80s, there’s been a growing nostal-
gia for couples dancing, in Montréal as everywhere else. These days,
swing is not the only dance in town. Salsa and tango are also extremely
popular. Whichever style you opt for, couples dancing makes for a great
night out. You can dance, watch, or learn — I hope a bit of each.
Most of the following places give free lessons or crash courses earlier in
the evening, before the real party starts. So you can walk in a complete
beginner and tango home like a pro. Well, sort of. Call to find out when
the sessions are on.
 Cactus, 4461 rue St-Denis, Plateau (% 514-849-0349), Montréal’s
other salsa hot spot, is on two floors of a town house just around
the corner from the Mont-Royal Métro station. It’s a little less intim-
idating than La Salsatheque, perhaps because the setting is more
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
196

intimate. Beginners try out their moves on the upstairs dance floor,
while the regulars tear it up front and center. Open: Thurs 9 p.m.–
3 a.m., Fri–Sat 10 p.m.–3 a.m., Sun 4–8 p.m. Cover: C$5 (US$4.25).
Métro: Mont-Royal.
 Ecole de Danse Swing Cat’s Corner, 486 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest,
Suite 303, Downtown (% 514-874-9846), hosts the biggest swing
night in Montréal on Fridays, with a crash course from 8:30 to 
9:30 p.m., and then dancing until whatever hour. Open: Fridays 
8:30 p.m.–1 a.m. Cover: C$7 (US$6). Métro: Place-des-Arts.
 La Salsatheque, 1220 rue Peel, Downtown (% 514-875-0016), is
Montréal’s oldest Latin club. The décor is somewhat dated, but no
one seems to mind. The action’s on the steel dance floor as couples
shimmy and spin to a variety of Latin rhythms, predominantly salsa,
merengue, and bachata. Open: Thurs–Sat 10 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover:
Fri–Sat C$5 (US$4.25). Métro: Peel.
 Mocha Dance, 5175-A av. du Parc, Mile End (% 514-277-5575), is a
dance studio with a bar and cafe, serving drinks and a light menu.
Throughout the week, the space hosts evenings of tango (Tues, Fri,
Sun) and salsa (Thurs, Sat). Sunday’s Tango Brunch is from 1:30 to
7:30 p.m. Even if you have no intention of dancing, it’s a romantic
spot to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. Open: Tues 9 p.m.–3 a.m.,
Thurs 9 p.m.–1 a.m., Fri 10 p.m–3 a.m., Sat 9 p.m.–3 a.m., Sun
1:30–7:30 p.m. Cover: C$5–C$8 (US$4.25–US$6.75). Métro: Laurier.
 Tango Libre, 1650 rue Marie-Anne Est, Plateau (% 514-527-5197),
an intimate dance floor tucked away on a mainly residential street,
has tango evenings beginning at 9:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday
(Cover: C$7/US$6). Supervised practice sessions are Thursday and
Sunday (Cover: C$6/US$5). In summertime, this tango studio organ-
izes Sunday evening dances at parks around the city. Métro: Mont-
Royal.
Grooving to live music
DJs may rule the city, but you can still find plenty of live, local music in
the bars and clubs around town. And the summer festivals supercharge
Montréal’s concert schedule, drawing top talent and delighted crowds to
city venues.
Intimate settings
Do you feel like live music for a change? This doesn’t necessarily mean
rocking out at a concert in a stadium. Instead, here are several spots
around town where live music is the main draw — where you can hear
up-and-coming talent or an offbeat sound.
 Barfly, 4062-A bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-284-6665), is a tiny
spot on one of the city’s main nightlife strips with a pool table and
a stage. An eclectic mix of local talent plays lively and boisterous
sets of folk music. Some nights are more brooding, when speakers
Chapter 15: Living It Up after Dark: Montréal Nightlife 197

and poets take the stage. Open: Daily 4 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: Fri–Sat
C$3–C$5 (US$2.50–US$4.25). Métro: Sherbrooke.
 Casa Del Popolo, 4873 bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-284 3804),
bills itself as a vegetarian hot spot. During the day it’s a cafe; by
night, it’s an intimate bar and live-music venue. Along with the
musical acts, the owners book a variety of performances, which
can be broadly categorized as urban folk and include DJ nights,
traveling video road shows, and spoken word. Casa also runs La
Sala Rosa, a space across the street at 4848 bd. St-Laurent, which is
for larger happenings. Open: Daily noon–3 a.m. Cover: Occasional,
C$5–C$10 (US$4.25–US$8.50). Métro: Laurier.
 La Maison du Jazz, 2060 rue Aylmer, Downtown (% 514-842-8656),
formerly called Biddle’s, was the haunt of late Montréal jazzman
Charlie Biddle. Live jazz is played nightly on a small stage, with sev-
eral tiers of seating in an Art Nouveau setting. Dinner is available
and includes La Maison’s famous ribs. The lounge and bar are just
far enough removed to allow for quiet conversation. Open: Sun 
6 p.m.–midnight, Mon–Wed noon–midnight, Thurs noon–1 a.m., Fri
noon–2:30 a.m., Sat 6 p.m.–2:30 a.m. Cover: C$5 (US4.25) added to
your bill. Métro: McGill.
 Le Divan Orange, 4234 bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-840-9090),
is the latest bar to open on St-Laurent that features a vibrant live-
music scene. It’s a resto-cafe-showbar that has comfortable, cozy
couches at the front; a long bar down the left-hand side; and a stage
at the back. The vibe is laid back, deconstructed, and convivial.
Open: Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–3a.m. Cover: Occasional, C$3–C$5
(US$2.50–US$4.25). Métro: Sherbrooke.
 Le Quai des Brumes, 4481 rue St-Denis, Plateau (% 514-499-0467),
is a dark and smoky bar frequented by an older, mainly French-
speaking clientele. The brick walls and wood paneling give it a
warm ambience. Jazz, blues, or rock bands play on a small stage in
the back every Wednesday and Saturday. Open: Daily noon–3 a.m.
Cover: Depending on the talent, cover can vary from C$3–C$8
(US$2.50–US$6.75). Métro: Mont-Royal.
 Les Pierrots Boite à Chansons, 104 rue St-Paul Est, Vieux-Montréal
(% 514-861-1270), is the premier spot to hear traditional Québec
folk music, from Thursday through Saturday, when the place is usu-
ally rockin’. If you don’t speak French, you won’t be able to sing
along, but you can still clap. For most of the crowd, the night is
highly sentimental and emotionally charged as they sing along to
the ballads they learned growing up. It’s a memorable night out.
Open: Daily 9 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: C$5–C$6 (US$4.25–US$5). Métro:
Champ-de-Mars.
 Sofa, 451 rue Rachel Est, Plateau (% 514-285-1011), a lounge with
a cigar humidor and many bottles of port, has live acts, usually of
the funk, soul, or R&B varieties, Thursday through Sunday. The 
bar is an island in the middle of the establishment. In front of it, a
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
198

narrow space creates a sort of gauntlet for mingling 25- to 35-year-
olds. Behind, groups of friends chill in the large alcoves with
booths. Open: 4 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: C$4–C$9 (US$3.50–US$7.75).
Métro: Mont-Royal.
 Upstairs, 1254 rue Mackay, Downtown (% 514-931-6808), also
offers jazz nightly, but in a more intimate setting. The stage seems
no more than a windowsill, as ensembles of up to six musicians 
jam together in close quarters. Mondays and Tuesdays are “Fresh
Jazz” nights, featuring the latest talent of McGill University’s music
students. Shows start at 9 p.m. Dining available. Open: Mon–Fri
12:30 p.m.–3 a.m., Sat–Sun 5 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: Fri–Sat C$15–C$20
(US$12.75–US$17), Sun C$10 (US$8.50). Métro: Guy-Concordia.
Concert venues
The clubs, or show bars, discussed in this section net a surprising
amount of top talent on tour. They open only when there’s a show, but
that seems to be most nights. So, who’s playing while you’re in town?
Find out by browsing Montréal’s free weeklies, calling the box offices, or
visiting the clubs’ Web sites. You can also book your tickets in person,
by phone, or on the Web. Be sure to check out the following:
 Club Soda, 1225 bd. St-Laurent, Quartier Latin (% 514-286-1010;
www.clubsoda.ca; Métro: St-Laurent)
 Le Cabaret, 111 bd. St-Laurent, Quartier Latin (% 514-845-2014;
Métro: St-Laurent)
 Le Spectrum, 318 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest, Downtown (% 514-861-
5851; www.spectrumdemontreal.ca; Métro: Place-des-Arts)
 Metropolis, 59 rue Ste-Catherine Est, Quartier Latin (% 514-844-
3500; www.metropolismontreal.ca; Métro: St-Laurent)
Hopping between hot spots: Montréal’s cafes and bars
Montréal’s nightlife begins early, carries on at a torrid pace, and ends
late. Seasoned denizens look to hit at least two or three spots over the
course of an evening. Choreographing the perfect night out is all about
timing, variety, and keeping your options open.
Montréalers like to mix-and-match. The city’s cafes and bars are perfect
for this: meeting friends before a night of dancing or sharing impressions
after a live show. Rather than clubs and concerts, where music is the
main draw — and usually too loud for sustained conversation — the
city’s cafes and bars are definitely more social. This is also the best
place to meet and mingle with the locals.
The expression in French is M’as tu vu? (pronounced mah too voo,
and literally meaning “Have you seen me?”). The following places are
very that:
Chapter 15: Living It Up after Dark: Montréal Nightlife 199

 Baldwin Barmacie, 115 av. Laurier Ouest, Outremont (% 514-276-
4282), serves up concoctions to a loud and flirtatious crowd seek-
ing strong antidotes for its angst. The hallway entrance is like a cat-
walk due to its several large windows that open onto the bar. The
long layout of the two rooms, one down a half-flight of stairs, is
somewhat disconcerting. If you want to order a drink from the
upper level, you must hail the bartenders who are several feet
below where you are. Makes for an interesting conversation starter.
Open: Mon–Fri 5 p.m.–3 a.m., Sat–Sun 8 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
Métro: Laurier.
 Cafeteria, 3581 bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-849-3855), is really
a restaurant. However, it is increasingly becoming a destination for
drinks among the young and fashionable set. True to its name, the
tables of the dining room are packed together, allowing for plenty
of social mingling. Others mill around the bar. It’s quite a scene that
goes late into the night. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
Métro: Sherbrooke or St-Laurent.
 Club 737, 1 Place Ville-Marie, Downtown (% 514-397-0737), atop
Montréal’s tallest skyscraper, is easy to locate: Just find the source
of the spotlights that stretch across the night’s sky. On the ground
floor, patrons line up for an elevator to shuttle them to the club on
the 42nd and 43rd floors. Undeniably, the vistas of Montréal by
night are spectacular! The experience is even better during the
summer months, when the club allows patrons out onto one of 
the observation decks. I think the view is the main attraction here;
otherwise, the two floors are dark, hot, and sweaty. Open: Fri–Sat
10 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: C$10–C$15 (US$8.50–$12.75). Métro:
Bonaventure.
 Edgar Hypertavern, 1562 av. Mont-Royal Est (% 514-521-4661), is
several blocks east of St-Denis, in the heart of the Plateau. It’s a pop-
ular destination for an attractive crowd of 20- and 30-somethings,
dressed casually, yet at the height of fashion. The cramped quarters
make the mingling rather intense. Large sculptures of sailfish tro-
phies with hooks dangling from their bodies evoke thoughts of hunt-
ing and fishing, and perhaps set the tone of the evening. Open: Daily
3 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Mont-Royal.
 Newtown, 1476 rue Crescent, Downtown (% 514-284-6555), bears
the nickname of its owner, former Formula One driver Jacques
Villeneuve. It is a literal translation of his last name and what his
pals called him on the F1 circuit. The three floors of his establish-
ment include a restaurant and terrace upstairs and a club in the
basement. The main-floor bar draws an older clientele than most
other places on rue Crescent. The décor is sleek and sophisticated.
Open: Daily noon–3 a.m. Cover: Fri–Sat C$10 (US$8.50). Métro: Guy-
Concordia.
 Versus, 106 rue St-Paul Ouest, Vieux-Montréal (% 514-788-2040), is
the bar of the Hotel Nelligan. It’s particularly popular for after-work
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
200

drinks among slick professionals working in the area. Plus, Hotel
Nelligan seems to be the boutique hotel of choice among visiting A-
list celebrities, which adds further mystique to the contemporary,
yet warm, décor. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–1 a.m. Cover: None. Métro:
Place-d’Armes.
Lounging like lizards
Sipping cosmopolitan martinis and other candy-colored concoctions —
this has been “in” for a terribly long time. In the mid-1990s, even before
the lounge scene became a widespread trend in North American urban
centers, Montréal had already started opening places with comfy seat-
ing, retro décor, and long drink lists of elaborate cocktails with fancy
names, all served in martini glasses.
 Go Go Lounge, 3682 bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-286-0882), is
mayhem. It’s, at times, so crowded that girls resort to dancing on the
bar. Some of the staff are “in character” — with decked out wigs and
disco fashions, their get-ups are inspired by Go Go’s full-on retro
décor. There’s no cover, but the line out front is notoriously slow; so,
get there early or prepare to be patient. Open: Mon–Fri 5 p.m.–3 a.m.,
Sat–Sun 7 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Sherbrooke.
 Java U, 191 rue St-Paul Ouest, Vieux-Montréal (% 514-849-8881),
serves cafe snacks during the day and a dinner menu in the
evening, but by 11 p.m. (Tues–Sat), it’s just drinks and DJs. Yes,
here you can get martinis — both the classic and newfangled ver-
sions. It’s probably the most legit spot in Vieux-Montréal — sleek,
but not necessarily packaged for tourists, unlike many of the other
places in the city’s historic district. Open: Tues–Sat 11 a.m.–3 a.m.,
Sun 11 a.m.–midnight. Cover: None. Métro: Place-d’Armes.
 Jello Bar, 151 rue Ontario Est, Quartier Latin (% 514-285-2621),
was one of the forerunners of Montréal’s martini movement. Its suc-
cess in re-creating a ’70s lounge environment coincided with the
public’s sudden and insatiable appetite for all things retro and a
newfound and considerable thirst for sophisticated-looking drinks.
DJs and live bands enhance the ambience in the form of jazz, Latin,
funk, soul, R&B, and other lounge-friendly musical tangents. Open:
Tues–Fri 5 p.m.–3 a.m., Sat 9 p.m–3 a.m. Cover: C$5–C$8 (US$4.25–
US$6.75). Métro: St-Laurent.
 Laika, 4040 bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-842-8088), is centrally
located, so it’s an ideal place for friends to meet throughout the
day, and particularly popular in the evening. A different local DJ of
some repute spins sets throughout for the denizens bobbing their
heads and chatting away, sitting at the cocktail tables in the front.
At the back, the space narrows only leaving room for a long,
wooden bar. Large windows open onto boulevard St-Laurent,
poorly disguised rubbernecking from both sides of the pane is
common practice. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro:
Sherbrooke.
Chapter 15: Living It Up after Dark: Montréal Nightlife 201

 Pub Quartier Latin, 318 rue Ontario Est, Quartier Latin (% 514-
845-3301), located just off of St-Denis. Its inconspicuous location
makes it hard to just happen upon. They play funk and rare groove,
supposedly the variety of stuff you’d find pressed on 45 rpm records.
A central bar anchors the first room surrounded by intimate ban-
quettes along the wall. The second room is somewhat larger. An ele-
vated area at the back is a makeshift stage for the funk and world
music bands that play there. Open: Daily 3 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
Métro: Sherbrooke, Berri-UQAM.
Dropping into neighborhood bars
At the establishments in this section, you’ll find plenty of locals and not
many tourists. But don’t be shy: Belly up to the bar, order a drink, and
strike up a conversation with a regular.
 Barraca Rhumerie & Tapas, 1134 av. Mont-Royal Est, Plateau 
(% 514-525-7741), offers up a potentially volatile mix of booze and
food, an extensive menu of aged rums, and a shorter list of tasty
appetizers. Rich tones of stained wood, wrought-iron accents, and
parchment lampshades, contribute to the boudoirlike atmosphere.
The long and narrow space is often crowded, making it extremely
difficult to reach the small terrace in the back. Open: Daily 3 p.m.–
3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Mont-Royal.
 Bily Kun, 354 av. Mont-Royal Est, Plateau (% 514-845-5392), is a
dimly lit and somewhat cavernous room, finished with bold lines, 
a beautiful tile floor, and ostrich-head trophies on the walls. It is a
modern-day pub that attracts a hip but unpretentious clientele in
their mid-20s and up. Order your drinks from the waiter; ask the
busboy about the menu of light snacks. Open: Daily 3 p.m.–3 a.m.
Cover: None. Métro: Mont-Royal.
 Cobalt, 312 rue St-Paul Ouest, Vieux-Montréal (% 514-842-2960), is 
a single room with stone walls; exposed, wooden beams running
across the ceiling; and beautiful, period windows. The understated
furniture and dim lighting accentuate these historic features — the
room feels both ancient and timeless. Music from a jamming live jazz
trio, a wide selection of beers and scotches, and a respectable menu
served late draws a mixed crowd: young and old, couples eating
dinner, friends out for drinks. It’s laid back and comfortable — cozy,
even. Open: Daily 11:30 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Square
Victoria.
 Else’s, 156 rue Roy Est, Plateau (% 514-286-6689), is a comfortable,
intimate spot that seems like a well-kept secret, with its inconspicu-
ous location, soft lighting, and the constant murmur of conversa-
tion. Actually, it is quite popular. The bar’s liquor license is such
that you have to buy a token snack with your alcohol. On tap is an
interesting selection of beer from Québec’s microbreweries, as well
as cider. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Sherbrooke.
Part III: Settling Into and Exploring Montréal 
202

 Le Ste-Elisabeth, 1412 rue Ste-Elizabeth, Quartier Latin (% 514-
286-4302), is hidden away, just off a seedy stretch of rue Ste-
Catherine. But, put any apprehension aside and persevere, and you
will be rewarded. It’s a real gem on a summer night: an intimate out-
door terrace with tables and chairs on two levels, surrounded by ivy-
covered walls, several stories high. In addition, it is right between
the downtown’s two festival sites, Place des Arts and rue St-Denis.
Monday, all year around, the bar has a special: C$3 (US$2.50) for
pints of Boreal beer. Open: Daily 3 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro:
Berri-UQAM.
What’s brewing in Montréal?
If you take your obligations as a tourist seriously, you should try as
many of the locally brewed beers as possible. Not only are there a wide
variety of suds brewed by the provinces’ microbreweries, but several
brewpubs also craft their own beer, which is not available anywhere
else. Here are my recommendations:
 Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel!, 9 av. Laurier Ouest, Mile End (% 514-490-
9555), features over 30 house recipes brewed on-site. The bar is
dark and cozy, ideal for a quiet time on a cold night. A window
allows patrons to peer down into the basement to see where the
beer’s made. Open: Daily 3 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Laurier.
 Brutopia, 1219 rue Crescent, Downtown (% 514-868-9916), con-
sists of three bars and several rooms spread over three floors. 
By the main bar, there’s a small stage for the nightly, live music.
Sundays are a popular open-mic. During the warmer months, the
brewery offers seating outside, both in back and out front. Brutopia
brews its house beers in large brass barrels in the room behind the
bar; try Indian Pale Ale, Raspberry Blonde, or Apricot Wheat. Open:
Daily 3 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Guy-Concordia.
 Le Cheval Blanc, 809 rue Ontario Est, Quartier Latin (% 514-522-
0211), was the first brewpub in Montréal and is responsible for
launching this segment of bars, which has now matured into all-
the-rage. The unpretentious crowd is a mixed bag. Serious beer afi-
cionados come for the ales on tap, neighborhood-types are drawn-
in by the red glow of the Asian lanterns. Open: Daily 3 p.m.–3 a.m.
Cover: None. Métro: Berri-UQUAM.
 Le Reservoir, 9 av. Duluth Est, Plateau (% 514-849-7779), has a
window on its brewing operation to the right of the bar. Groups of
friends and couples chat, seated at tables with votive candles.
During the summer, the main-floor windows open onto the street,
and the second-floor terrace is in full swing. Open: Mon–Fri noon–
3 a.m., Sat–Sun 10:30 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None. Métro: Sherbrooke.
Racking up in a pool hall
You don’t have to be a shark or a rounder to frequent a pool hall these
days. In Montréal, they’re practically chic. You can play for rounds of
Chapter 15: Living It Up after Dark: Montréal Nightlife 203

drinks, but be sure to size up your competition before making such a
suggestion — lest you get fleeced. Here are two of the more popular
places to play pool:
 Cafe Saint Laurent Frappe, 3900 bd. St-Laurent, Plateau (% 514-
289-9462; Open: Daily noon–3 a.m.; Métro: Sherbrooke)
 Sharx, 1606 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest, Downtown (% 514-934-3105;
Open: Daily 11 a.m.–3 a.m.; Métro: Guy-Concordia)
Yucking it up at comedy clubs
As the annual Just For Laughs Festival continues to grow, Montréal is
increasingly a mecca for stand-up and improv comedians. They say it’s
the hardest profession in the world. Here are two places to try:
 Comedy Nest, 2313 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest, Downtown (% 514-
932-6378; Open: Thurs–Sat, shows at 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.;
Métro: Atwater)
 Comedyworks, 1238 rue Bishop, Downtown (% 514-398-9661;
Open: Mon–Fri 4 p.m.–3 a.m., Sat–Sun 7 p.m.–3 a.m.; Métro: Guy-
Concordia)
Being out and proud in Gay Village
Montréal is quickly becoming the hottest gay destination in North
America, and the city’s gay community has a thriving nightlife scene. Gay
Pride and the Black and Blue weekends are annual highlights on the city’s
nightlife calendar. Rue Ste-Catherine, east of rue St-Hubert, is packed with
innumerable restaurants, cafes, bars, and clubs that are always hopping
throughout the year. Following are some of the hottest spots.
 Cabaret à Mado, 1115 rue Ste-Catherine Est, Gay Village (% 514-
525-7566), has drag queens strutting in cabaret shows on some
nights. The rest of the time they emcee for karaoke, stand-up
comedy, and theme parties. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover:
C$3–C$6 (US$2.50–US$5). Métro: Beaudry.
 Sky Complex, 1474 rue Ste-Catherine Est, Gay Village (% 514-529-
6969), is a pub, restaurant, cabaret, male strip club, mega-dance
club, and rooftop terrace in one. For gay men, it’s a sort of one-stop
shop. Open: Mon–Tues 2 p.m.–1 a.m., Wed–Sun 2 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover:
Fri–Sat C$3 (US$2.50). Métro: Papineau.
 Unity II, 1171 rue Ste-Catherine Est, Gay Village (% 514-523-2777),
is a mega-club in the Village spread over three floors and topped 
by a terrace on the roof. Take advantage of the two-for-one specials
every day from 4 to 8 p.m. Open: Wed, Fri, Sat 10 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover:
C$3–C$5 (US$2.50–US$4.25). Métro: Beaudry.

Québec City

In this part . . . 
A
couple of hours downriver from Montréal is Québec
City, a place that makes you feel as though you’ve
stepped into another age. In this part, I explain where to go
and what to do to get the most out of your visit. I tell you
where to ﬁnd the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions. 
I even give you a handy historical tour of Québec’s Old City,
so that you can see all the highlights in one afternoon.

Chapter 16
Arriving and Getting
Oriented in Québec City
In This Chapter
 Getting to Québec City
 Figuring out the city’s neighborhoods
 Traveling around the city
You’re likely to spend almost all your time in Québec City in the Old
City, which is divided into a fortified Haute-Ville (Upper City), built
behind walls on a cliff overlooking the St. Lawrence River, and a Basse-
Ville (Lower City), at the foot of the cliff running along the riverfront, to
the south and east. You can easily get lost in the winding cobblestone
streets in either neighborhood, but don’t worry if you do. The whole
point of Québec City is strolling around and soaking up the unbelievable
atmosphere. This chapter explains how to get to Québec City and how
to get around after you arrive.
No matter how you get to Canada from abroad, you have to pass through
Customs. See Chapter 8 for details on what to expect from the stern-faced
Customs agents you encounter at the border.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
Whatever you may have thought of your trip so far, get ready, Québec
City will charm your pants off. Getting to your hotel will feel like traveling
back in time: from the suburban outskirts littered with modern-looking
malls to the historic, walled city. You’ll feel the centuries peeling away.
You may feel younger, too: The setting seems to appeal to the long-lost
romantic in everyone.
If you arrive by plane
If you arrive in Québec City by air, you will land at the small Jean Lesage
International Airport, 500 rue Principale Sainte-Foy (% 418-640-2700).
No shuttles are available to downtown Québec City. A taxi ride costs a

fixed rate of C$25 (US$21.25). If you want to rent a car, the following
major agencies have desks at the airport:
 Avis: % 800-879-2847 or 418-872-2861
 Budget: % 800-268-8900 or 418-872-9885
 Hertz Canada: % 800-654-3131 or 418-871-1571
 Thrifty: % 800-367-2277 or 418-877-2870
You may land at the province’s main international airport, which is actu-
ally in Montréal: Trudeau International Airport (% 800-465-1213 or
514-394-7377). See Chapter 8 for more details about arriving here and
traveling by land between Montréal and Québec City.
If you arrive by car
From New York City, follow I-87 to Highway 15 to Montréal, and then
pick up Autoroute 20 to Québec City. To get into the city, take Autoroute
73 Nord (Highway 73 North) across the Pierre-Laporte Bridge (Pont
Pierre-Laporte) and exit on boulevard Champlain. Turn left at rue Parc
des Champs-de-Batailles and follow it to Grande-Allée. When you get to
Grande-Allée, turn right, and head straight into the Old City.
From Boston, take I-89 to I-93 in Montpelier, Vermont, which connects
with Highway 55 in Québec to link up with Autoroute 20. Follow the pre-
ceding directions.
From Montréal, you can take either Autoroute 20, which follows the
south shore of the St. Lawrence River or the more scenic, less-trafficked
Autoroute 40, which follows the north shore. Either way, the trip takes
about two and a half hours.
If you arrive by train or bus
Trains pull into Québec City train station, Gare du Palais, 450 rue Gare-
du-Palais (% 418-692-3940). Via Rail handles all passenger train travel
in Canada (% 888-842-7245; www.viarail.ca).
Adjacent to the train station is the bus station, Terminus Gare du
Palais, 320 rue Abraham-Martin (% 418-525-3000). There are several dif-
ferent lines that serve the region but, for Québec City, they all stop here.
Figuring Out Québec City’s Neighborhoods
Québec’s Old City is really quite small, but it’s so dense and packed with
interesting sites, shops, museums, cafes, restaurants, and other attrac-
tions that you can spend a lot of time wandering its winding streets and
still be surprised by new sites and curiosities. The only neighborhood
that you’ll likely want to visit outside the Old City is the Grande-Allée, a
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
208

long, wide street running west of the St-Louis Gate that’s lined with
restaurants, boutiques, and bars. During the summer evenings, this
street is hopping, and its terraces are packed with revelers.
Haute-Ville (Upper City)
This is the biggest part of the Old City, a neighborhood entirely sur-
rounded by thick ramparts. Most of Québec City’s main attractions can
be found here, including the Château Frontenac, the Place d’Armes, the
Basilique Notre-Dame, the Québec seminary and museum, and the ter-
rasse Dufferin (a long promenade with a view of the St. Lawrence River
below). Most of the buildings are at least 100 years old, some much
older. The city was not built on a grid, so it can be disorienting, but don’t
worry — sooner or later, you’ll arrive at a wall, a cliff, or a gate, and
you’ll be able to figure out where you are on a map.
Basse-Ville (Lower City)
Historically, this part of the city was reserved mainly for poor families
that worked in the docks. Now, it’s pretty much a continuation of the
Haute-Ville. In the Basse-Ville, you find similar architecture, many restau-
rants, some small inns, and several major attractions, including the spec-
tacular Musée de la Civilisation (Museum of Civilization). Rue St-Paul is
a lovely strip with many art galleries and antiques stores and some very
cute accommodations.
Take the elevator or the stairs down from the terrasse Dufferin or Place
d’Armes, and you wind up on the delightful rue Petit Champlain, a
pedestrian alley full of shops of varying quality. Don’t forget to stroll
along the port area. Recent development and an interest by the cruise
industry have made the area more attractive and festive. You’ll be in awe
of the massive cruise ships from around the world that dock at the port.
Grande-Allée
If you exit the Haute-Ville at the St-Louis Gate and keep walking west past
Québec’s Parliament Buildings, you end up on Grande-Allée. Although this
street offers a lot of hotels and accommodations, it is known mainly for its
many restaurants and bars with sidewalk terraces. It’s a meeting point for
the city’s young, and it’s lively all summer long. Keep heading west for
about 15 minutes on foot and you’ll reach avenue Cartier on your right —
another lively street with many B&Bs, restaurants, shops, and bars.
Finding Information after You Arrive
Québec City has two good tourist information centers in handy loca-
tions. The main office is Centre Infotouriste, 12 rue Ste-Anne, just oppo-
site the Château Frontenac at Place d’Armes (% 800-363-7777 or 418-
692-2608). The office is well stocked with tons of brochures and is well

staffed with bilingual employees who help you find information or book
hotel rooms and tours for you. The Greater Québec Area Tourism and
Convention Bureau, 835 av. Laurier, near the Plains of Abraham and not
too far from Grande-Allée (% 418-649-2608), offers the same services
but tends to be a little less busy.
Getting Around Québec City
Québec City’s small size makes it a snap to get around. By foot is best;
however, at some point, you have to contend with the steep hill between
the Haute-Ville and Basse-Ville. This is when the funiculaire (elevator)
comes in handy.
By foot
If you’re in reasonably good shape and have comfortable walking shoes,
you can probably dispense with all motorized transport while in Québec
City, especially if your hotel is in the Old City. Walking is definitely the
best way to travel; the only challenge on foot is getting between the
Upper and Lower cities. To do so, you have to climb the steep stairs that
join Côte de la Montagne (near the Petit Champlain) to the Dufferin
Terrace. If you want, you can take the funiculaire that leaves from the
head of rue Petit-Champlain and also arrives on the Dufferin Terrace. In
the north part of the Old City, near rue St-Jean, you can take advantage
of a more gradual decline to get to the Basse-Ville by following rue Côte-
du-Palais down a gentle slope to rue St-Paul.
By public transportation
I have only one exception to the rule of walking: if you’re staying too 
far away from the Old City to make the trip in by foot. In that case, sev-
eral buses run frequently into the Old City. Bus 7 runs up and down rue
St-Jean; bus 11 runs along Grande-Allée and rue St-Louis. Both take you
into the Old City, making stops all the way to Place d’Youville, just out-
side the walls on the north side of town. These buses pass about every
ten minutes. Fares are C$2.25 (US$2) of exact change, or you can pur-
chase tickets at a dépanneur (convenience store) for C$1.90 (US$1.50).
By taxi
Taxis are plentiful in Québec City, and they’re pretty easy to flag down
around the big hotels and outside the gates of the Old City. Inside the
Old City, you can find taxi stands at Place d’Armes and in front of the
Hôtel-de-Ville (City Hall). The fares are the same as in Montréal, which
can be a little expensive for short distances. The starting rate is C$2.50
(US$2), and then C$1.20 (US$1) per kilometer. To call a taxi, try Taxi
Coop (% 418-525-5191) or Taxi Québec (% 418-525-8123).
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
212

By car
Trying to get around Québec City by car really makes no sense. You’ll
have great difficulty parking on the street in the Old City, which is so
compact that you can walk everywhere easily on foot. That said, if you
arrive at your hotel by car, you can find plenty of places to leave it while
you stroll about the city. Hotels either have parking lots or have worked
out deals with parking lots nearby, and most will be able to direct you
where to go to find a spot. For most parking lots, expect to pay around
C$10 to C$12 (US$8.50–US$10.25) per day. Some lots even allow you to
come and go during the day at no extra charge.
By bicycle
Given how hilly and dense the Old City is, cycling isn’t a very attractive
option. Still, you can rent bikes for the day at several locations. Try
Cyclo Service, 160 rue St-André in the Basse-Ville (% 418-692-4052), 
or Vélo Passe-Sport Plein Air, 22 rue Côte-du-Palais, near rue St-Jean
(% 418-692-3643). The cost is around C$20 (US$17) for 12 hours.

 Finding the best accommodations in Québec City
 Knowing how much you’ll pay
B
ecause Québec City is so small, accommodations can book up
quickly for the high season (roughly May–Oct), so I suggest calling
well in advance. If you’re shopping around for a room before your trip,
or if you need to find something at the last minute, check out my tips in
Chapter 9 on how to get the best deal.
Each hotel listing in this chapter includes a $ symbol indicating the price
range of the rooms. Prices included are the rack rates, the standard rate
for a double room for one night, before taxes. Table 17-1 fills you in on
what the $ signs represent.

Less than C$100 (US$85)
Simple and inexpensive, these accom-
modations should offer all the basics: a
room with a lock, a firm bed, and clean
towels and sheets. A light continental
breakfast may be included. Hotels
offering rooms at these prices proba-
bly don’t have an extensive catalog of
services to cater to your every whim,
but the front-desk clerks are usually
delighted to point you in the right
direction for whatever you want.

Price Range
What to Expect
$$
C$100–C$199 
Many of the rates offered by the chain 
(US$85–US$169)
hotels fall into this price range, as do
the rates of the fancier independents.
You can already expect the amenities
to be better, such as bathrooms with
hair dryers, coffeemakers with compli-
mentary coffee, and Internet access.
Some hotels in this category may have
kitchens that provide late-night room
service or a breakfast cart. Some even
have swimming pools.
$$$
C$200–C$299 
Along with the upper-end of the chain 
(US$170–US$254)
hotels, boutique hotels and luxury
hotels begin competing in this price
bracket, with fine bed linens, feathery
pillows, fluffy towels, and bathtubs
built for two. The first-class hotels
seem to differentiate themselves by
striving for regal scale and elegance,
while boutique hotels are strikingly
modern. Expect high-speed Internet
access in your room.
$$$$
C$300 (US$255) or above
At this price, you should want for noth-
ing in terms of your stay. Expect a
great view, an in-room hot tub, a CD
player, thick terry cloth bathrobes, and
even flowers. Highly deferential, per-
sonalized service is included, as well.

the living room has an available Internet connection, as well as piles of

Auberge St-Pierre
$$–$$$$
Basse-Ville
This new-ish hotel in the heart of the Basse-Ville does an almost magical
job of looking and feeling antique, from the distressed painted furniture to
deliberately scratched hardwood floors, high ceilings, exposed brick-and-
stone walls, and old-fashioned hot-water radiators. But the rooms are
utterly modern in term of amenities and convenience; the spacious bath-
rooms, for example, are generously equipped, right down to the built-in
hair dryers. One luxurious suite has a hot tub and king-size bed.

Au Château Fleur De Lys Hôtel
$
Haute-Ville
The “Château” in the name may be a bit misleading; this quaint, family-run
hotel occupies a stately, urban mansion built in 1876 on the uppermost
part of the Haute-Ville. Perhaps it’s most castlelike feature is a gorgeous
spiral staircase with a wooden banister leading to 18 rooms over three
floors. Otherwise it tends towards run-down, in a romantic sense, more
reminiscent of a European inn. The rooms themselves are basic with com-
fortable beds and clean bathrooms. It’s perhaps not the polish and pam-
pering you were dreaming of, but the location and value of this Château
are hard to beat.

Château Bellevue
$$–$$$
Haute-Ville
At first sight, you may mistake this small hotel for one of the oodles of
B&Bs and guesthouses that surround it, all facing the peaceful Jardin des
Gouverneurs park. Château Bellevue actually has 58 rooms, small (but not
overly quaint), quiet, and equipped with basic amenities like phones and
cable TV. Unlike many accommodations in the Old City, this place has an
elevator, so you have no steep stairs to climb. The staff is very helpful.
Some of the pricier rooms face the park, and in winter they have a view of
the St. Lawrence River.

Château Cap-Diamant
$$
Haute-Ville
The idyllic enclosed garden behind this Victorian guesthouse, with its
crumbling rock walls, flower-filled porch, and fountain, is almost worth the
price of a room itself. Each room in this quaint inn is different. All are dec-
orated with antiques, and the place feels something like a work in
progress. Bathrooms are tiny. Although most rooms are accessible by
steep narrow stairs, there’s a small elevator to lift luggage to the upper
floors. Whew! Rooms have cable TV, and Internet access is available in the
reception area. The owners are inviting and helpful. Ask for a room over-
looking the rooftops of the Old City.

Château de Pierre
$$
Haute-Ville
A European-style inn on a quiet, elegant street packed with small B&B-style
hotels, the Château de Pierre distinguishes itself in the details: polished
banisters, pretty wallpaper, a chandelier in the reception area, and a small
patio for summer lounging. The owners want you to take your time here,
relax, and stay in bed late. All 15 rooms are nonsmoking, and most have
bathtubs. The only drawback of this place is very steep staircases that you
have to climb to get to most of the rooms.

Château Laurier
$$–$$$
Grande-Allée
Facing the elegant Place George V, this recently renovated, 154-room hotel
keeps you in European-style comfort while putting you just a few minutes’
walk from Vieux-Québec. The main reception area features a grand piano
and sumptuous leather couches. Some rooms have working fireplaces, CD
players, king beds, and Jacuzzis. Basic rooms are spacious and tastefully
appointed. It’s a family-owned establishment, but it feels like an upscale
chain hotel. The hotel caters to tour groups, which yields a bustling atmos-
phere, but can also be a bit noisy. Ask for a room in the new wing (they’re
bigger) and facing the park.

This small B&B feels something like a nicely worn-in dollhouse, with its
winding staircase and brightly painted, eclectic décor. It offers only three

rooms, but each is large and handsomely renovated, with wood floors and
lovely painted antique furniture. You’ll find plenty of comfortable space
for relaxing, but only one bathroom, and no TV or telephones in the rooms
(both are available in the living room downstairs). Due to the presence of
the family dog, no other animals are allowed. Call well ahead to reserve a
room.

Couettes et Café Toast
$
Avenue Cartier
Located outside the walls of Vieux-Québec, this bed-and-breakfast is
reputed as a linguistic guest home and encourages guests to immerse
themselves in the French language and Québec’s culture. Breakfast, over
a large, communal table, is a group affair and mostly in French. There’s a
reading room with lots of Francophone magazines and other media to flip
through to round out your experience. Otherwise the rooms are cozy and
elegant. The neighborhood is a tucked-away commercial strip which has
lots of charming boutiques and cafes — and it’s really not that far away
from the attractions in the historic district.

Delta Québec
$$
Boulevard Rene-Levesque
This upscale, well-located hotel delivers comfortable rooms with all the
trimmings — including a heated outdoor pool. Surprisingly easy to miss,
it is actually connected to the Centre des Congrès, Québec City’s conven-
tion center. The reception area is two floors up from the front entrance,
and the maze of escalators and mezzanines are a little confusing, but you
get the hang of it. Spacious, rustic-style rooms with pine furniture come
with small desks equipped with ergonomic chairs and Internet connec-
tions. You’re about a ten-minute walk from the Parliament Buildings and
Vieux-Québec, making this a good choice for business or pleasure.

Fairmont Le Château Frontenac
$$$$
Haute-Ville
A tourist attraction in itself, the 100-year-old Château Frontenac is defi-
nitely the place to stay if you want the full Vieux-Québec experience (and
you pay for the privilege, of course). Perched on the terrasse Dufferin, it
looks like a castle from the outside and feels like one on the inside — from
the elaborate wood paneling of the reception area to the parking valets

dressed in period costumes. The 618 rooms vary enormously, with every-
thing from luxurious suites to standard, good-size rooms that are actually
a decent value for the money. Prices vary a lot depending on season and
availability, and you get the best rates, by far, in package deals. There’s
plenty to keep kids amused, from the pool to kids’ programs and a video
arcade.

Gite Côte de la Montagne
$$
Basse-Ville
Just three large rooms, one more like a loft, make up this bed-and-break-
fast with spectacular views of the river and the Château Frontenac from a
rooftop terrace. This intimate hideaway would be well suited for a roman-
tic weekend. Best of all, you get to set the time when they serve breakfast.
The nearly 300-year-old freestone building is halfway up the hill and backs
onto the “Breakneck stairs” for climbing up and down between the Haute-
and Basse-Ville. The furnishings in the rooms are simple and rustic, but
comfortable.

Hilton International Québec
$$–$$$
Boulevard Rene-Levesque
In addition to all the comfort and pampering you expect from the name,
Québec City’s Hilton offers a simply amazing view of Vieux-Québec. In fact,
you’re probably better off staying here and looking at the stately Château
Frontenac, than staying in the Frontenac itself. All the rooms are spacious
and offer a view of the Old City. This Hilton is especially kid-friendly, with
gifts, special kids’ programs, and discount coupons for the hotel’s restau-
rant, where, among other things, you can indulge in an all-you-can-eat lob-
ster dinner. Added amenities include a health center with trainers, a
heated outdoor pool open year-round, and high-speed Internet connec-
tions in every room. Plus, it’s just a five-minute walk from the walls of
Vieux-Québec and some 20 nearby gastronomic restaurants. Good rates
are available off season.

Holiday Inn Select
$$–$$$
St-Roch
Up until recently, this hotel’s location may have been a disadvantage.
Suddenly, it’s in the middle of the city’s hottest action in terms of shop-
ping, dining, and nightlife. St-Roch used to be roughneck, but now it is

decidedly upmarket (the Hugo Boss boutique isn’t far). An 18-story con-
crete skyscraper, tall by Québec City standards, houses the 240 rooms.
They tend to be large and outfitted with all the basics — no-frills but com-
fortable — typical of the Holiday Inn brand. Perhaps atypically for a larger
chain, the front-desk staff are keen and helpful, eager to point out the
neighborhood’s different destinations.

Hôtel Belley

Basse-Ville
This is a fun and funky place to stay if you’re looking for reasonably priced
accommodations within walking distance of the art galleries and antiques
stores along rue St-Paul. The Hôtel Belley has eight bright, if sparsely dec-
orated, rooms; some with added touches such as exposed beams and
brick walls and skylights. All rooms are nonsmoking. Bathrooms are
extremely compact. Several rooms have extra pullout beds for kids, and
one family-size room has a queen and two single beds. Light meals are
available at all hours in the small tavern on the first floor of the hotel.

Hôtel Clarendon
$$–$$$
Haute-Ville
This elegant, well-maintained Art Deco–style hotel is one of the oldest
hotels in Vieux-Québec and has even maintained its original, wicket-style
reception desk. Located in the heart of the Haute-Ville, it couldn’t be better
situated, and you’ll definitely feel as though you’ve been transported back
in time. Rooms are rather dark and claustrophobic, but bathrooms are
modern. There’s a lively pub, known for its jazz evenings, right off the
reception area. The hotel’s restaurant, Le Charles Baillargé, offers excel-
lent French food. Facials, body scrubs, and massages are available on loca-
tion. Nonsmoking rooms are available.

In 2005, Condé Nast Traveler’s readers rated this hotel tops in all of Canada.
It also landed a spot in Travel + Leisure’s Top 500. It’s located in Québec
City’s first skyscraper. The nine-story, 1912 structure now houses an ele-
gant, 60-room, boutique hotel. Inside, the lobby’s centerpiece is a black,

marble fireplace surrounded by plush, shabby-chic couches for guests to
lounge in and sip complimentary coffees and hot chocolate. The décor
throughout is decidedly modern with a muted palette of black and grays.
The high ceilings and large windows give many rooms on the upper floors
spectacular views of the St. Lawrence River. The assured and competent
staff are attentive and considerate and provide an elevated level of serv-
ice. As is the case with boutique hotels, you can buy many of the items in
the rooms.

Housed in a century-old brick manor, the Hôtel du Vieux-Québec offers a
cool, comfortable ambience, including spacious rooms and a cozy living
room, where you can rest after a busy day of sightseeing. This place is pop-
ular with families because many of the doubles have extra sofas. Extra
guests stay for C$15 (US$12.75) per day. Kids stay for free in the winter,
and significant rate reductions are available off season. The staff is friendly
and helpful. The hotel is close to shopping, nightspots, and restaurants.

Basse-Ville
This 26-room hotel occupies a three-story, 19th-century town house in the
Basse-Ville, along a street dotted with antiques shops and cafes. It may feel
out of the way, but rue St-Paul, the hotel’s namesake, is the place to be in
this part of town. The rooms tend to be on the large side with elegant Art
Deco–inspired furnishings. The bathrooms are modern and some have
large hot tubs. Throughout, the features of the old building add charm, but
the amenities are completely up-to-date in the well-appointed rooms.

bathrooms with marble counters. The hotel has a gym and a pool. A
revolving restaurant at the top, L’Astral, serves excellent French food while
offering a panoramic view of the city. Meanwhile, you’re only an elevator
ride away from cafes and restaurants galore down below on Grande-Allée.

Just a block away from the now bustling rue St-Joseph, the Royal William
is in the up-and-coming district of St-Roch — somewhat removed from Old
Québec and the concentration of the tourist attractions. However, when
you discover this new commercial strip, you’ll be glad your hotel is only
a few steps away. The Royal William, named after the first steamship to
cross the Atlantic Ocean, is a business-class hotel of 44 rooms with many
amenities to satisfy this travel set.

This clean and convenient B&B is perched above the boutiques, restau-

and airy, although basic, and not all have bathrooms attached. A living area
on the first floor has a microwave, a fridge for guests’ use, telephone and
TV, a big comfy couch, and a small balcony that looks over avenue Cartier.
The only drawbacks include two flights of stairs to climb to the rooms and
slightly indifferent service. Breakfast is served in the cafe downstairs,
where decent food and coffee are served at reasonable prices all day.

Grande-Allée
The small, somewhat luxurious Manoir Lafayette puts you very close to
Vieux-Québec while affording you some room to breathe. You get more of
a big hotel feeling here than in the many small inns along the Grande-Allée.
The elegant reception area is decorated with nice antiques, while rooms
are of a decent size, modern, and offer queen or double beds.

Haute-Ville
The formal lobby of this small hotel, with its fireplaces, antique armchairs,
and elegant dining room done up in dark burgundy and blue, projects an
old-world feel. The 145 rooms are classic in style, but modern and spa-
cious, with two double beds. The hotel offers all the perks and services
you’d expect in a larger hotel, including valet parking, an indoor pool,
sauna and fitness center, Internet lounge, and even babysitting. This end
of the Haute-Ville is convenient, with restaurants of all types for all budg-
ets, and lots of shopping on nearby rue St-Jean. In the low season, it’s pop-
ular among the corporate crowd.

A cool, peaceful, and meticulously kept inn close to the Plains of Abraham,
this is one of the best deals along the Grand-Allée and a regular hangout

Old City. The 24 guest rooms are bright, spacious, and recently renovated,

rench, French, and more French. That’s what you can expect to eat
in the heart of historic New France — and, fortunately, Québec City
has plenty of great French restaurants. But if you’re not a fan of frogs’
legs, don’t worry: Québeckers are enthusiastic about all categories of
culinary delights. You can find everything to satisfy your palate, from
sushi to pizza and pasta.
You can find great places to eat all over the city, but in this chapter, I
give you the best choices in and around the Old City and Grande-Allée. 
I just figure that’s where you’ll probably be when you get hungry.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
If you think locals avoid Québec City’s touristy areas, think again. Many
of the city’s finest restaurants are in the Old City and on the Grande-
Allée, and locals come here to indulge in a good meal.
The Old City
Both the Upper and Lower cities are full of quaint and charming eating
spots that serve some variation of French food, from cafe fare to bistro
meals and formal dining. Most of these serve quite traditional cuisine —
you know, French onion soup; crêpes (in crêpe places); mussels and
fries; steak frites; and lamb, pork, and fish dishes.
Prices at restaurants in the Old City aren’t astronomically high, as you
may have suspected, but you can save money by shopping around a
little. Almost all restaurants in the Old City display menus in the window
with prices. Check them out before you enter. Many offer a complete

meal menu (table d’hôte), and they’re usually a good deal. Many also
offer a special lunch menu, and these are usually a very good deal.
Grande-Allée
As you step outside the Porte St-Louis and head down Grande-Allée, the
restaurants get a little more modern. In the summer, after just a five-
minute walk outside the gate, you see a broad boulevard lined with rows
of tables on each side. It looks like one huge terrace, but it’s actually the
combined effect of patios of dozens of different restaurants, crammed
together for blocks.
You can find just about every type of food here, from fine French dining
to traditional Québec cooking, plus Italian restaurants, burger joints,
bagel and sandwich spots, sushi restaurants, pizzerias, and seafood and
steak places. Stroll along and read the menus, which are usually dis-
played near the sidewalk. Or just cut to the chase and head to the places
I recommend in this chapter.
Québec City’s Best Restaurants
In this section, you find my top choices for dining in Québec City.
The dollar sign ratings represent the price of one dinner (appetizer,
entree, and dessert), including drinks and tip, and correspond with the
price ranges in Table 18-1.

You can cut your dining costs in a variety of ways. I explain these tech-
niques in Chapter 10, and a lot of them apply to Québec City, as well.
In the heady tourist atmosphere of Québec City at high season, the best
restaurants fill up quickly. Make your dinner reservations at least in the
afternoon of the same day, and preferably the night before. In the off
season (Oct–Apr) — when the tourist frenzy in Québec City cedes to an
atmosphere of barely discernible activity in the streets — you can get a
table in most establishments on the spot. And they’ll be happy to see you.

Asia
$$–$$$
Grande-Allée
ASIAN
This extremely popular restaurant is a great place to turn if you’re getting
tired of French food (not likely, but it happens). Asia offers a wide variety
of dishes with Thai, Vietnamese, and Indochinese influences. Its specialty
is grilled meats, but the restaurant also offers seafood plates, an excellent
red curry chicken, and marinated shrimp and sautéed pork, plus Thai soup
and pad thai. Asia has a second location in the Basse-Ville.

(% 418-692-3799). Reservations recommended. Table d’hôte: C$24–C$26 (US$20.50–
US$22). AE, MC, V. Open: Lunch Mon–Fri, dinner daily.
Aux Anciens Canadiens
$$$
Haute-Ville
QUÉBEC
This restaurant brings historic Québec all together. It’s housed in the
oldest private dwelling in the Haute-Ville, the Maison Jacquet, built in 1690.
Aux Anciens Canadiens is named after one of its early owners’ novels. It
translates into Canadians of Old. The food is authentic Québec cuisine,
from old standards like pork and beans, ham, tourtière (meat pie), caribou,
and blueberry pie to more recently discovered delicacies, such as duck,
from the Eastern Townships (see Chapter 14). The servers are dressed in
period costumes to complete the effect. If the price makes you hesitate,
try it out at lunch, when the price of the table d’hôte is quite reasonable.
34 rue St-Louis (corner of rue Haldimand). % 418-692-1627. Reservations recom-
mended. Main courses: C$27–C$40 (US$23–US$34). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Lunch and
dinner daily.
Buffet de l’Antiquaire
$–$$
Basse-Ville
QUÉBEC
Strolling by the antiques shops along rue St-Paul, you may not even notice
this closet-sized restaurant at first. It’s worth a stop, though. This is where
locals go to eat authentic Québec specialties like poutine (fries with gravy
and cheese curd) and fèves au lard (Québec’s version of pork and beans:
all lard, no meat). Meat dishes, like steak frites, or lighter meals, such as
soup, sandwiches, and salads, are also on the menu. This place is definitely
off the tourist track — yet right in the middle of the action — plus it’s
cheap.
95 rue St-Paul (near rue Sault-au-Matelot). % 418-692-2661. Main courses: Under
C$8–C$14 (US$6.75–US$12). AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Lunch and dinner daily.
Café de la Paix

Haute-Ville
FRENCH
It looks small and unpresuming from the street, but if you want high-qual-
ity, classic French cooking in a totally classic setting, this is the place.
Chapter 18: Dining and Snacking in Québec City 231

You’ll find frogs’ legs, as well as beef sirloin, chateaubriand, rabbit, scal-
lops, steak tartare, lobster, duck, and (need I say it?) French onion soup.
The atmosphere is dark and cozy. Service is not genteel, but the career
waiters — mostly surly older men — do know their stuff. You feel like
you’re in France.
44 rue des Jardins (between Donnacona and rue St-Louis). % 418-692-1430.
Reservations recommended. Main courses: C$15–C$50 (US$12.75–US$42.50). AE, DC,

Café du Monde
$$–$$$$
Basse-Ville
FRENCH BISTRO
This legendary Québec City bistro recently moved from its small, Parisian-
style digs on rue Dalhousie to a big, new, glamorous location in the térmi-
nal des croisières (cruise liner terminal) facing the port. The two walls
facing the river are made entirely of glass, so the river view is exceptional.
And, I’m happy to say, the food is as good as ever. Famous for brasserie
fare like mussels, steak frites, sausage, and duck confit, Café du Monde
also serves up sandwiches, salads, and seafood selections. Service is
friendly, but waiters don’t have time to linger at your table. Reservations
are not taken for the terrace (with river views), so get there early if you
want to eat outside.
84 rue Dalhousie (near the cruise liner terminal on the Old Port). % 418-692-4455.
Reservations required; not accepted for the terrace. Main courses: C$12–C$32

9:30 a.m.–2 p.m.
Casse-Crêpe Breton
$–$$
Haute-Ville
CRÊPES
This little place on rue St-Jean is extremely popular — both with locals
and tourists — and you almost always encounter a line at lunchtime. It’s
worth the short wait. The crêpes are perfect and very filling, and you can
have them as a main course, dessert, or both. A long list of potential main
course fillings includes ham, cheese, mushrooms, asparagus, eggs, and
more, and dessert options range from chocolate to fruit to plain sugar. You
can watch them being prepared in the open kitchen. Service is friendly,
but don’t dawdle: Other people are waiting for your seat!
1136 rue St-Jean (near rue Garneau). % 418-692-0438. Reservations not accepted.
Main courses: C$5–C$9 (US$4.25–US$7.75). MC, V. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–1 a.m.
Conti Caffe
$$–$$$
Haute-Ville
ITALIAN
With its stone walls and fashionable modern décor, this new Italian bistro
definitely stands out among the more traditional eateries on rue St-Louis.
It’s a great spot for lunch — you can have a three-course meal here with
coffee for C$10 (US$8.50). At night, the menu gets a little more sophisticated,

with additions like veal medallions, beef sirloin, and even escargot to the
pasta and pizza selections. Pizza is of the thin-crust variety, with imagina-
tive toppings.
26 rue St-Louis (next to its owner, Le Continental Restaurant, which has the same
address). % 418-692-4191. Main courses: C$17–C$26 (US$14.50–US$22). AE, MC, V.
Open: Lunch and dinner daily.
Initiale
$$$$
Basse-Ville
FRENCH
This is the place to go in Québec City for fine French cuisine in an elegant,
rather formal setting. Located in a former bank building, its décor is clas-
sical and modern, with high ceilings and decorative moldings. Like most
skilled, up-to-the-minute chefs these days, Yvan Lebrun focuses on local,
seasonal ingredients. Plates range from French classics, such as grilled
salmon, lamb, lobster, and filet mignon, to slightly more adventuresome
dishes such as foie gras and pigeon. Give the Québec cheeses a try
between your main course and dessert. Expect service to be attentive and
none too quick. And the point here is savoring, not saving.
54 rue St-Pierre (corner of Côte de la Montagne). % 418-694-1818. Reservations rec-
ommended. Main courses: C$36–C$45 (US$30.50–US$38.25). AE, DC, MC, V. Open:
Lunch Mon–Fri, dinner daily.
L’Ardoise
$$–$$$
Basse-Ville
FRENCH BISTRO
The dishes served in French bistros are what the French consider comfort
food. That’s what you’ll get at L’Ardoise, which caters equally to locals and
tourists with its welcoming casual atmosphere and hearty dishes.
Specialties include mussels and fries — with seconds of mussels for free —
grilled blood sausage, veal liver, rib steak, and fish selections. Fish lovers
with an appetite should try the Royale de la mer (Royal Sea) dish of salmon,
shrimp, mussels, and scallops in a rich sauce. This is a nice place to hang
out and sip an after-dinner espresso.
71 rue St-Paul (near rue des Navigateurs). % 418-694-0213. Reservations recom-

Open: Lunch Mon–Sat, dinner daily, brunch Sun.
Largo

St-Roch
MEDITERRANEAN
If Québec City on the whole feels somewhat sedate, this hidden-away
restaurant and jazz bar brims with brio. Jazz ensembles Wednesday
through Saturday and a Mediterranean menu make it a hopping destina-
tion for dinner among a smartly dressed, middle-aged clientele. Despite
the hushed tones and refined textures of the dining room’s décor, the din
of conversation indicates that everyone is delighted to be a part of the
urbane atmosphere. A crush of patrons mingle at the bar, often having to

wait for a table. “In the zone,” waiters ferry large plates with inventive 
presentations of favorites from Provence and beyond: bowls of bouilla-
baisse and dishes of lamb, veal, fish, and pasta.

Grande-Allée
FRENCH
With a capacity for a thousand guests, this rotating restaurant on top of
the Loew’s hotel on the Grande-Allée is obviously not the place to come for
intimacy. But the view is as good as it gets, stretching dozens of miles
across the Plains of Abraham and the Old City all the way to the Laurentian
Mountains. For such a huge place, the food is, surprisingly, very good —
a mix of mainly French-based plates with Asian and Cajun touches. Prices
are reasonable and if you calculate the view, the whole experience is pretty
easy on your wallet. Sunday brunches here are quite lavish. Just make sure
the weather is clear before you go.
1225 cours du Général-de-Montcalm (corner Grande-Allée). % 418-647-2222.

Daniel Vézina is Québec City’s premier chef who hosts one of the
province’s TV cooking shows. His restaurant is one of the city’s grand
tables, a category of restaurant meaning the best. A native of the Île
d’Orleans, a fertile island of farming communities just downriver, his
market cuisine reflects his intimate knowledge of the region’s seasonal ter-
roir ingredients. Jean-Pierre Viau, a renowned Montréal designer, was
behind the sharp lines, muted tones, and rich materials of the establish-
ment’s C$1 million makeover, including a large “peek-a-boo” window look-
ing right into the kitchen. You can also sign up for a cooking course or visit
the boutique showcasing the work of local producers and artisans.

Basse-Ville
FRENCH BISTRO
This is one of the slicker French bistros in the Basse-Ville, with its checker-
tiled floor, zinc bar, and Art Deco décor. The food, however, is very good
and reasonably priced. Specialties include grilled meats, bouillabaisse
seafood stew, fish selections, steak and salmon tartare, steak frites, and

Haute-Ville
CONTINENTAL
One of the oldest restaurants in Québec City, Le Continental has been a
hangout for Québec’s political class for the last five decades. Don’t expect
any great surprises, and you won’t be disappointed — you get a classic
menu with an atmosphere to match. Plates range from crab in hollandaise
sauce to steak tartare and duck à l’orange. Waiters are attentive, courte-
ous, and discreet — as they should be when they spend their days inad-
vertently listening in on gossip among Québec’s political elite.

Grande-Allée
CONTEMPORARY ITALIAN
This modern-feeling restaurant has a trattoria feel and offers sophisticated
Italian cooking with an emphasis on fresh ingredients — definitely not one
of those places serving huge portions of pasta with stick-to-your-ribs meat
sauce. Instead, you choose from eight California-style thin-crust pizzas
with dressing like marinated chicken and sun-dried tomatoes; pasta selec-

Le Paris-Brest
$$$–$$$$
Grande-Allée
CONTEMPORARY FRENCH
Considered one of the best tables in Québec City, this fashionable restau-
rant offers French food with modern flair. The menu includes fancy items
such as Dijon rib of beef and milk veal with Brie cheese, but it also includes
higher-brow French classics, like lamb cutlets, scallops, steak tartare, and
sweetbreads. Lighter selections include pasta dishes with seafood.
Atmosphere is fairly informal, but neat.

Le Saint-Amour
$$$$
Haute-Ville
CONTEMPORARY FRENCH
Tucked in among the many B&Bs along rue Ste-Ursule, Le Saint-Amour
offers a truly gastronomic experience. The décor is elegant and romantic,
with lace curtains, flickering candles, and a glass roof for star-gazing
lovers. Award-winning chef Jean-Luc Boulay presents delicacies with a
regional flavor, like lobster from Québec’s Gaspé area, caribou steak, and
duck from the Eastern Townships (discussed in Chapter 14), and tops it
off with selections like foie gras, served with fig compote and caviar.
Expect the meal to move slowly — the waiters assume you want to take
your time. If you’re in a hurry, let them know.
48 rue Ste-Ursule. % 418-694-0667. Reservations recommended. Main courses:
C$34–C$48 (US$29–US$40.75). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Lunch Mon–Fri, dinner daily.
Les Frères de la Côte
$$–$$$
Haute-Ville
ITALIAN
This lively pizzeria-cafe on rue St-Jean is a favorite of locals and a great
place to bring kids. With 17 kinds of pizza — cooked in wood-burning
ovens — plus pasta dishes and platters of meat and fish brochettes, you’re
sure to find something for even the pickiest pint-sized eater. The music is
loud practically all the time, but the high spirits that reign here are infec-
tious. Also open for Sunday brunch.
1190 rue St-Jean. % 418-692-5445. Reservations recommended. Main courses: C$10–
C$23 (US$8.50–US$19.50). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Lunch and dinner daily, brunch Sun.
L’Utopie
$$$$
St-Roch
FUSION
When many guests leave here, their heads are slightly woozy thinking of
superlatives to describe their experience. Smack in the middle of the rue
St-Joseph renaissance, this is one of the destinations that’s driving the
action to this long overlooked and recently remodeled section of town.
Monthly, the kitchen devises a special four-course menu around a partic-
ular ingredient, which appears in each dish. There’s also another set menu
of five-courses, each paired with a different glass of wine. All of the dishes
are contemporary and ambitious, with a main course including selections
of beef, duck, game, and several kinds of fish. Their wine list has several
exclusive importations and an alarming number of choices by the glass.
2261⁄2 rue St-Joseph (near rue Carron). % 418-523-7878. Reservations recommended.
Main courses: C$25–C$32 (US$21.25–US$27.25). AE, MC, V. Open: Lunch Tues–Fri,
dinner Tues–Sat.
Péché Véniel
$$–$$$
Basse-Ville
FRENCH BISTRO
For good food in a warm and inviting atmosphere, this informal little
corner bistro off rue St-Paul is hard to beat. The menu consists of classic
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
236

French brasserie food, such as steak frites and mussels, and some tradi-
tional Québec cuisine, including smoked meat sandwiches and a very fill-
ing and satisfying version of Québec’s famous Lac St-Jean meat pie. Lunch
specials (around C$10/US$8.50) include soup, a main course, dessert, and
coffee and are an excellent deal. Service is just what it should be. A nice
place for a leisurely lunch that won’t break the bank.
233 rue St-Paul. % 418-692-5642. Main courses: C$14–C$36 (US$12–US$30.50).
Reservations recommended. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Lunch and dinner daily.
Poisson d’Avril
$$–$$$
Basse-Ville
SEAFOOD
One of the few seafood restaurants in Québec City, the décor is straight
out of Cape Cod: nautical motifs, hanging model ships, and marine prints.
The expansive menu includes starters of mussels, crab, and smoked
salmon, escargot, oysters, and fish soup. Main courses include combo
plates with scallops and seasonal fish. The restaurant also serves mussels
and shrimp; straightforward salmon, cod, and tuna plates; southern
French bouillabaisse; and, of course, lobster. Prices are probably compa-
rable to what you’d pay in Cape Cod, too: not cheap, but not outrageous.
115 quai Saint-André (in the Old Port, near rue St-Thomas). % 418-692-1010.
Reservations recommended. Main courses: C$12–C$40 (US$10.25–US$34). AE, DC,
MC. V. Open: Lunch and dinner daily.
Sushi Taxi
$$–$$$
Grande-Allée
SUSHI
Québec City is not exactly a sushi town, but this small chain has garnered
a loyal following of locals for its good, reasonably priced offerings. The
avenue Cartier restaurant recently expanded to add some atmosphere to
the menu with 30 tables (30 more on the terrace in the summer) in a Zen-
like décor. If you’re unfamiliar with the art of eating raw fish, Sushi Taxi
has a Discovery Plate with a bit of maki, nigiri, temaki, and sashimi.
813 av. Cartier. % 418-529-0068. Table d’hôte: Lunch C$17 (US$14.50), dinner C$26
(US$22). AE, MC, V. Open: Lunch Mon–Fri, dinner daily.
Voodoo Grill
$$$–$$$$
Grande-Allée
ASIAN/FRENCH
Quite a hot spot on Grande-Allée, this restaurant adds a bar atmosphere
to its lounge look, which results in a restaurant with a post-modern Middle
Eastern décor with African and designer influences. The menu is as vari-
ously inspired, with everything from Singapore chicken and Bangkok soup
to volcano steak, with plenty of grilled fish selections and some sushi
tossed in for good measure. Although the concept may sound a little unfo-
cused, the food is surprisingly good, well prepared, and beautifully pre-
sented. Just be ready for some entertainment of dubious quality and
mysterious origin — like belly dancers — and count on loud music.
Servers were evidently hired more for looks than skill, but they do the job.

Yuzu Sushi
$$$–$$$$
St-Roch
FUSION
If you’ve grown tired of the traditional Japanese restaurant experience,
Yuzu is the place to refresh your palate. Modern, daring, and unusual, the
dishes on the menu are in the same vein as the dining room’s décor. The
name refers to a Japanese citrus flavor — a widely used, secret ingredient
of sorts in a variety of Japanese sauces. Besides the standard sashimi (raw
fish), nigiri (raw fish on a rice ball), and maki (raw fish and rice rolled in
seaweed paper) sushi, the menu boasts a section of Yuzu maki, original
combinations devised by the chef. The main courses are fusion and com-
bine ingredients from East and West. There are several other options as
well: oyster shooters, dishes for sharing, or a five- or seven-course “dis-
covery menu.”
438 rue de l’Église (near rue St-Joseph). % 418-521-7253. Reservations recom-
mended. Main courses: C$11–C$36 (US$9.25–US$30.50). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Lunch
Mon–Fri, dinner daily.
Québec City’s Best Snacks
As a tourist town, Québec City is loaded with eating opportunities of all
types and qualities. You’re more likely to feel the anxiety over the abun-
dance — rather than a lack — of eating options packed into this small
area. The following sections list snacks and light food and should help
you narrow the field when you want to grab a coffee, a sweet, or a bite 
to eat.
Cafes for coffee and more
Cafes aren’t just for coffee, although you can usually get an excellent cup
of joe at the following recommended places. You can often get light
meals at these cafes, too, including soups, salads, and sandwiches.
 Brulerie Tatum, 1084 rue St-Jean (% 418-692-3900), specializes in
its own roasts of coffee and serves tasty snacks like croque mon-
sieurs (a toasted roll with ham, tomato, and cheese).
 Café Buade, 31 rue de Buade (% 418-692-3909), serves coffee and
lighter meals, such as pizza and pasta, in a classic French cafe
atmosphere.
 Café Krieghoff, 1091 av. Cartier (% 418-521-3711), serves light
tasty meals including salads, quiche, and soup in a down-to-earth,
French-style cafe. In summer, a covered terrace offers pleasant
street views.
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
238

 Café Le St-Malo, 75 rue St-Paul (% 418-692-2004), with its charm-
ing sidewalk terrace and nautical décor, is a great place for a drink
and a light bite.
 La brûlerie de café de Québec, 75 rue St-Jean (% 418-529-4769),
promises a good cup of joe from the moment you step inside. Wafts
of roasting coffee greet customers at the door.
 Le Hobbit, 700 rue St-Jean (% 418-647-2677), has a cafe on the
first floor that serves coffee, while meals are served on the second
floor.
 Les Cafes du Soleil, 143 rue St-Paul (% 418-692-1147), is another
roaster, but in Basse-Ville. This tucked-away place will feel like a
find. There’s a light menu and a strong base of regulars dropping in
and out.
 Java Java, 1112 av. Cartier (% 418-522-5282), is a fun place for
coffee or snacks, such as panini sandwiches or burgers and fries.
Pizza and burgers
Québec is even less of a burger town than Montréal, so I have only two
good burger joints to recommend, but they really are great, despite being
members of a rare species. If you’re looking for a quick meal, you’ll find
more choices in the pizza category.
 Chez Victor, 143 rue St-Jean (% 418-529-7702), comes up with new
and imaginative types of burgers every day.
 Cosmos Café, 575 Grande-Allée Est (% 418-640-0606), right in the
thick of the Grande-Allée action, serves respectable burgers and
very good breakfasts.
 La Piazzetta, 707 rue St-Jean (% 418-529-7489), a Québec chain,
was one of the forerunners in the local trend toward European-style
pizza. Pizzas have interesting toppings and very thin crusts.
 Pain, Pizza & Dolce Vita, 519 rue St-Jean (% 418-653-2741), has 
a wide variety of fresh-baked goods in the Italian tradition: pizza,
panini, and foccacia to name but a few. Nothing too fancy — square
slices, delicious foccacia, and panini on homemade bread.
 Pizzédélic, 1145 av. Cartier (% 418-523-7171), puts a psychedelic
spin on the thin-pizza concept, offering one-serving pizzas with
original toppings. Salads are great.
 Pizza Mag, 363 rue St-Paul (% 418-692-1910), offers 20 different
types of more traditional, thick-crust pizza, some with unusual top-
pings, such as leeks, escargots, and smoked fish.
 La Pointe des Amériques, 964 rue St-Jean (% 418-694-1199),
serves gourmet pizza, with all the combinations of toppings you
can imagine.
Chapter 18: Dining and Snacking in Québec City 239

For chocolate lovers
If you have a hankering for something tastier than the convenience-store
quality of your favorite brown substance, you have two excellent places
to go for chocolate in the Old City. You can find French, Belgian, and
Swiss varieties at Chocolatier Cupidon Château, 1 rue des Carrières,
behind the Château Frontenac (% 418-692-3340). At Choco-Musée
Erico, 634 rue St-Jean (% 418-524-2122), high-quality chocolate comes
in some very interesting forms.
All crêpes, all the time
It’s hard to imagine visiting Québec City without eating crêpes at least
once. They’re a great option for lunch, because they’re cheap and rela-
tively quick. And no worries — you can really fill up on them, especially
if you order them for your main course and dessert. I give you my top
choices in this section, but honestly, crêpes are pretty hard to screw 
up (unless you order them in a place that doesn’t specialize in them).
They’re just stuffed pancakes, after all.
My first choice is the Casse-Crêpe Breton, 1136 rue St-Jean (% 418-692-
0438), both for its bustling atmosphere and delicious fresh dishes. In the
shadows of the Château Frontenac, sits Le Petit Château, 5 rue St-Louis
(% 418-694-1616), yet another good bet with a wide selection of sweet
and savory crêpes.
A vegetarian outpost
Vegetarians are not exactly in the promised land in this town of blood
sausage and veal scallops. There is really only one restaurant in the Old
City that caters exclusively to vegetarians. Le Commensal, 860 rue St-
Jean (% 418-647-3733), serves excellent buffet-style vegetarian food
that is sold by weight.

Exploring Québec City
In This Chapter
 Exploring Québec City’s best attractions
 Seeing the city by guided tour
 Discovering Québec City’s historical highlights
Québec City’s most interesting attractions are conveniently packed
together in an area that you could probably cross by foot in half an
hour if you walked straight without stopping. Of course, you have many,
many reasons to stop, so you’re likely to linger a bit longer than 30 min-
utes. Half a day will give you a good overall impression, but several days
still won’t be enough to see absolutely everything. In this chapter, you
find the top sights you want to try to hit.
Exploring Québec City’s Top Sights from A to Z
There’s plenty to do in Québec City. The past comes alive here because
many of the attractions recount the history of this fortified city — the
only one in North America.
Basilique Notre-Dame-de-Québec 
(Notre-Dame-de-Québec Basilica)
Haute-Ville
The site of the oldest Christian parish north of Mexico, Québec City’s
founder Samuel de Champlain originally chose this spot for a chapel back
in 1633. Over the centuries, the Basilique Notre-Dame was built, torn down,
burned, and expanded into roughly its present, neo-baroque style in the
1920s. The light inside is quite inspiring, combining the effects of candle-
light and two floors of stained-glass windows depicting scenes of evan-
gelists, arch angels, saints, and the Virgin Mary. Opinions are mixed about
Feux Sacrés (Sacred Fire), a 30-minute light and sound show on five cen-
turies of Québec history that plays outside the basilica during the summer.
Some say it’s impressive; others say it’s tacky. You be the judge.
20 rue Buade (at corner of Côte de la Fabrique). % 418-694-0665. Admission: Free;
guided tours C$2 (US$1.70) adults, C$1 (US85¢) children. Open: Daily 7:30 a.m.–5 p.m.,
until 4 p.m. Oct–Apr.

Chapelle/Musée des Ursulines (Ursuline Convent and Museum)
Haute-Ville
The French nun Marie de l’Incarnation founded the Ursulines order in
Québec when she arrived in 1630; the convent was built in 1642. The
chapel came much later, in 1902, but much of what you see in the interior
dates to 1732. The museum and chapel interior are packed with artifacts,
including Louis XIII furniture, a painting that was removed from Paris
during the French Revolution, and altar cloths and church robes that the
Ursuline nuns wove with gold thread. General Montcalm, who led the
French troops when they lost Québec to the English in 1759, was originally
buried here.
12 rue Donnacona (corner rue des Jardins). % 418-694-0694. Admission: Chapel free;
museum C$6 (US$5) adults, C$5 (US$4.25) seniors, C$4 (US$3.50) students, C$3
(US$2.50) children 12–16, children under 12 free. Open: Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–noon and
1–5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m., but hours vary seasonally.
Château Frontenac
Haute-Ville
If one piece of architecture symbolizes Québec City, this is it. In Chapter
17, I recommend that you stay at this castlelike hotel, but in case you can’t
afford to actually spend the night, take a few minutes to wander inside.
You really can’t miss it. Just look for the pointy, green, copper roof rising
above the cliff overlooking the St. Lawrence River. The château was built
by the Canadian Pacific Railway in the early 1890s, and although it was
inspired by the châteaux of the Loire Valley in France, it was designed by
an American architect, Bruce Price. The inside is truly regal, with wood
paneling, imposing antiques, and dainty boutiques surrounding the recep-
tion area. Guided 50-minute tours are given from May to October.
1 rue des Carrières (facing the terrasse Dufferin). % 418-692-3861; for reservations
418-691-2166. Admission: Free for a peek; tours (reservations required) C$8 (US$6.75)
adults, C$7.25 (US$6.25) seniors, C$5.50 (US$4.75) children 6–16, free for children 5
and under. Tours daily on the hour 10 a.m.–6 p.m. 
La Citadelle
Grande-Allée
Much of Québec City’s history is dominated by the battles various empires
waged to get control of this prime trading port on the St. Lawrence River.
La Citadelle gives you a taste of the stormy military past — even though
it was never actually used during a war. Still, you get an idea of the stakes
of a possible enemy attack when you visit this star-shaped fortress com-
prising 25 separate buildings. First built by the French in the late 1700s,
then rebuilt by the English in the 1830s, La Citadelle now houses a French
Canadian regiment of the Canadian army. Notable features include a
powder house and a prison. The guided tour is a little dry and perhaps
better suited to military-history buffs, but the changing of the guards, usu-
ally once a day, is pretty cool.

1 Côte de la Citadelle (enter off rue St-Louis, leaving the St-Louis Gate in the direc-
tion of Grande-Allée). % 418-694-2815. www.lacitadelle.qc.ca. Admission:
C$8 (US$6.75) adults, C$7 (US$6) seniors, C$4.50 (U$3.75) children 7–17, free for per-
sons with disabilities and children 6 and under. Open: July 1–Labor Day daily 9 a.m.–
6 p.m.; off-season hours vary. Guided tours leave on the hour.
Musée de la Civilisation (Museum of Civilization)
Basse-Ville
If you have time for only one major museum outing, this is the place. It
won’t teach you the most about the specific history of Québec City, but
the permanent exhibits on daily life in the history of the province of
Québec (called Memoires, or Memories) and on Canada’s First Nations
(called Nous, les Premiéres Nations) are totally captivating. Though light
on written explanations, the exhibits have objects displayed beautifully
and sensibly. They draw in visitors and satisfy all their senses (except
maybe smell), while doing a good job of illustrating two distinct cultures.
Plan on spending about two hours here. An added bonus: On the second
floor, there’s a lovely, bright, and modern visitors lounge with computers
where you can check your E-mail for free.
85 rue Dalhousie (corner of rue St-Antoine). % 418-643-2158. Admission C$8
(US$6.75) adults, C$7 (US$6) seniors, C$5 (US$4.25) students 18 and over, C$3
(US$2.50) children 12–17, free for children 11 and under. Open: Late June–Labour
Day daily 9:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; Sept–June Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Musée de l’Amérique Française (Museum of French America)
Haute-Ville
Housed in a former seminary built in 1663, this museum is an excellent
place to get a French perspective on history. The museum is dedicated to
showing the evolution of French culture and civilization in North America
through the history of all seven French communities in the New World.
The five floors of the museum contain 450,000 artifacts in all — everything
from silverware and scientific instruments to paintings, engravings, parch-
ments, old and rare books, and even the first Egyptian mummy to be
brought to North America. Descriptions are in both English and French.
2 Côte de la Fabrique. % 418-692-2843. Admission: C$5 (US$4.25) adults, C$4 (US$3.50)
seniors, C$3 (US$2.50) students 16 and over, C$2 (US$1.70) children 12–16, free for chil-
dren 11 and under. Open: Late June–Labour Day daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sept to mid-
June Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Guided tours available; call for information.
Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec 
(Québec National Museum of Fine Art)
Grande-Allée
Not too far from the Parc Champs-de-Bataille, this museum houses the
largest collection of Québec art in North America, including over 23,000
pieces dating from the 18th century to the present. Eight galleries are
Chapter 19: Exploring Québec City 245

spread over three buildings. The Great Hall has a reception area and
attached auditorium. The Gérard Morrisset Pavilion houses permanent
exhibits, including works from the early colonial period, African masks and
carvings, and musical instruments. The Baillargé Pavilion, a former prison
built in 1867, holds temporary exhibits.
1 av. Wolfe-Montcalm (near Place George V). % 418-643-2150. www.mnba.qc.ca.
Admission: Permanent collection free; special exhibitions C$10 (US$8.50) adults, C$9
(US$7.75) seniors, C$5 (US$4.25) students, C$3 (US$2.50) children 12–16, children 11
and under free. Open: June 1–Labor Day daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Wed till 9 p.m.;
Sept–May Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Wed till 9 p.m.
Parc des Champs-de-Bataille (Battlefield Park)
Grande-Allée
If the Château Frontenac stands as a symbol of Québec City, this park is the
symbol of tension between Canada’s English and French populations.
Québec’s Battlefield Park is where General Montcalm led the French
against General Wolfe and the English in the famous battle of the Plains of
Abraham in 1759 (the English won; both generals died). Although it’s
famous for a battle, the 108-hectare (267-acre) park is actually a rather idyl-
lic place to stroll (with some 5,000 trees), not too far from the Grande-Allée.
Locals like to cross-country ski here in the winter and Rollerblade and bike
in the summer. Summer also brings theater and musical performances.
The park’s Maison de la Découverte (Discovery Pavilion) explains the
significance of the Plains of Abraham to Québec.
Discovery Pavilion, 835 av. Laurier. % 418-648-4071. www.ccbn-nbc.gc.ca.
Admission: Free. Open: Park 24 hours; Discovery Pavilion daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Place-Royale
Basse-Ville
This quaint cobblestone square, located on the spot where Champlain
founded Québec in 1608, feels like a microcosm of Vieux-Québec. Right at
the bottom of the Breakneck stairs, Place-Royale is dominated by the
Notre-Dame-des-Victoires church, the oldest church in Canada built in
1688, which is small and rather plain but contains some lovely paintings
and a large model boat suspended from the ceiling. This was a town mar-
ketplace during the 17th and 18th centuries. Now you can see a bust of
French King Louis XIV, a copy of the original bust erected in 1686. All the
buildings around the square have been restored, and you can souvenir
shop to your heart’s content in this part of the Basse-Ville. The Centre
d’Interpretation de Place-Royale (Interpretation Center) explains the his-
tory of the square.
Centre d’Interpretation de Place-Royale, 27 rue Notre-Dame (walk down the
Breakneck stairs and take Côte de la Montagne to rue Notre-Dame). % 418-646-3167.
Admission: C$4 (US$3.50) adults, C$3.50 (US$3) seniors, C$3 (US$2.50) students 17
and over, C$2 (US$1.70) children 12–16, children 11 and under free. Open: Late
June–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sept–June Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
In this section, you find suggestions for following a specific interest,
whether you want to keep the kids entertained; get your fill of wars, bat-
tles, and armory; make your teenagers happy; stroll some lovely streets;
or take a tour.
Kid-pleasing places
Kids are sure to be enchanted by Québec City, whether it’s the fairy-tale-
castle effect of the Château Frontenac or the real (but not in use!) can-
nons and armory scattered around the city. The best museum for kids 
is the Musée de la Civilisation, which has great exhibits plus loads of
room to run around. Following are a few other suggestions for entertain-
ing children.
Centre d’Interprétation de la Côte-de-Beaupré (Côte-de-Beaupré
Interpretation Center)
Outside Québec City
Set in an entirely restored convent — about 40 minutes out of town — kids
get to peek at a period classroom and some of the other hardships of life
in New France. The staff is in costume and “in-character,” which is also a
hoot. An animated diorama tells the history of the region — the site of
Québec’s earliest rural communities. Popular archaeological and religious
artifacts exhibited throughout the convent make up the permanent col-
lection, shown off by one of the guides.
7976 av. Royale (in the town of Château-Richer). % 418-824-3677. http://pages.
globetrotter.net/cicb. Admission: C$5 (US$4.25) adults, C$4 (US$3.50) seniors
and students, free for children 16 and under. Open: May–Oct daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.;
Nov–Apr Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m.
Ferry Ride
Old Port
Not very expensive, but usually a thrill for the little ones, you can cross
the river from Québec City over to Lévis in about ten minutes. The view of
Québec City from the river is quite spectacular, especially at night. There’s
not much to do in Lévis, but take a stroll around anyway. The ferry leaves
close to Place-Royale. Buy tickets at the Société des Traversiers du Québec
building, right on the port.
Société des Traversiers du Québec, 10 rue des Traversiers. % 418-644-3704. Tickets:
C$2.50 (US$2.25) adults, C$2.25 (US$2) seniors, C$1.75 (US$1.50) children 5–11, free for
children 4 and under. Departs from Québec three or four times per hour.
Chapter 19: Exploring Québec City 247

Musée de Cire (Wax Museum)
Haute-Ville
Pop in to this 17th-century house to see wax renditions of major personal-
ities in Québec history. There are 60 individuals in all, in 16 settings. From
pop stars to military heroes, you get your fill of tackiness, and then some.
22 rue Ste-Anne. % 418-692-2289. Admission: C$4 (US$3.50) adults, C$3 (US$2.50)
seniors and students, children 11 and under free with adult. Open: May–Oct daily 
9 a.m.–9 p.m.; rest of year daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Observatoire de la capitale (Observation Deck)
Grande Allée
Kids go dizzy with vertigo on this observation deck, which is Québec City’s
highest point. By modern-day, skyscraper standards this government
building is an unimpressive 31 floors, but the views of this historic city
and the St. Lawrence River are really worthwhile. The otherwise large-
looming Château Frontenac doesn’t seem that big from here. It’s the river
that’s so impressive.
1037 rue de la Chevrotière. % 888-497-4322 or 418-644-9841. www.observatoire
capitale.org. Admission: C$5 (US$4.25) adults, C$4 (US$3.50) seniors and stu-
dents, free for children 11 and under. Open: Mid-June to mid-Oct daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.;
mid-Oct to mid-June Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Parc Aquarium du Québec (Québec Aquarium)
Ste. Foy
All kids leave this place wanting to be marine biologists, which is proba-
bly a good thing. Various-windowed tanks and glassed-tunnels lead visi-
tors through several underwater ecosystems. Polar bears, penguins, and
seals cavort as a scuba diver in the deep-sea tank show visitors, up close,
some examples of the over 650 different species.
1675 av. des Hôtels (15 minutes from Vieux Québec; bus 13). % 418-659-5264. www.
spsnq.qc.ca. Admission: C$15.50 (US$13.25) adults, C$14.50 (US$12.25) seniors,
C$12.75 (US$10.75) students 13–17, C$10.50 (US$9) children 6–12, C$5.50 (US$4.75)
children 3–5, free for children 2 and under. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Oct–Apr until
4 p.m.
Parc de la Chute-Montmorency
Outside Québec City
A labyrinth of paths and wooden staircases leads to a suspended bridge
for daredevils to cross the frothy mouth of this 272-foot waterfall — 
significantly higher than Niagara Falls. Summer or winter it’s a dramatic
outdoor adventure. At the top are spectacular views of the river and sur-
rounding area. The Manoir Montmorency, an enormous English country
house with a reputed kitchen serves regional cuisine with local, or terroir,
ingredients. It’s a touch of civilization in an otherwise rugged place. Those
who don’t feel like making the climb can take a cable car to the top.
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
248

2490 ave. Royale. % 800-665-6527 or 418-663-3330. Admission: Round-trip on the
cable car C$8 (US$6.75) adults, C$4 (US$3.50) children 6–16, free for children 5 and
under. Parking: $8 (US$6.75). Open: Hours vary seasonally; call ahead.
Terrasse Dufferin
Haute-Ville
Head straight to this square looking out onto the St. Lawrence River for a
kind of one-stop children’s entertainment package. Within a short walking
distance (even shorter running distance), you have coin-operated tele-
scopes for a look across the river. In the summer, street entertainers
abound, from living “statues” to mimes to musicians playing wine glasses.
If you want to burn off some serious steam, try tackling the Breakneck
stairs, leading down to the Basse-Ville. For a real thrill, take the kids to
nearby Place d’Armes and pick up a horse-drawn carriage ride
(C$60/US$51 for a 35-minute ride).
For military and history buffs
Kids aren’t the only ones fascinated by epic battles. If you like stories
about warfare, this section gives you few places to find them.
Assemblée nationale du Québec (Québec Legislature)
Grande Allée
Heckle the ministers of Parliament from the gallery in Québec’s legislature.
Just kidding — don’t. Instead, watch democracy in action and brush up
on your knowledge of parliamentary procedure. Most of the law-making is
done in French so it can be rather opaque, but not understanding some-
how adds to the spectacle. You can take a free guided tour in English of
this imposing 18th-century building inspired by the Louvre in Paris or eat
breakfast or lunch in the restaurant among Québec’s political elite. Access
can vary depending on the official events of the day.
45 rue des Parlemaentaires (just outside the walls of the Haute-Ville). % 418-
643-7239. www.assnat.qc.ca. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round Mon–Fri 
9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; June–Sept Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Musée du Fort
Haute-Ville
For explanations of sieges and battles fought in Québec City, this small
museum just off Place d’Armes is hard to beat. Battles are retold using
sound and light, in both English and French.
10 rue Ste-Anne. % 418-692-1759. Admission: C$7.50 (US$6.50) adults, C$5.50
(US$4.75) seniors, C$4.50 (US$3.75) students. Open: Apr–Oct daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.;
Oct–April Thurs–Sun 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Chapter 19: Exploring Québec City 249

Musée Naval de Québec (Naval Museum of Québec)
Basse-Ville 
The flow of the mighty St. Lawrence River is a constant reminder of
Québec’s naval history — both military and merchant. Did you know that
there were German U-boats in the St. Lawrence River during World War II?
This new museum’s unique collection of over 1,000 objects reveals the dif-
ferent boating eras over the last century, but it focuses on the Battle of the
St. Lawrence during WWII. It features several recovered items from torpe-
doed boats that sank nearby. The museum looks at the historical, social,
and even environmental consequences that were at stake.
170 rue Dalhousie (near Promenade de la Pointe-à-Carcy). % 418-694-5387. www.
mnq-nmq.org. Admission: Free. Open: May–Sept daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Oct–Apr
Tues–Fri 1–4 p.m.
Parc de l’Artillerie (Artillery Park)
Haute-Ville 
Near the Porte St-Jean, this enormous military installation was the French
military headquarters starting in 1747. Later, it housed the British garri-
son, and then became a munitions factory, which was in use until 1964.
Now it serves as an interpretative center. Don’t miss the scale model of
Québec City, showing what the city looked like in the 1800s.
2 rue d’Auteuil (near St-Jean Gate). % 418-648-4205. Admission: C$4 (US$3.50) adults,
C$3.50 (US$3) seniors, C$2 (US$1.70) children 6–16, free for children 5 and under.
Open: May–Sept daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m; Oct–Apr by reservation.
Fortifications de Québec (Fortifications of Québec)
Haute-Ville
If the wall around Québec City — built to protect the city from marauding
invaders — is still standing, it’s because it was restored and remains a pro-
tected site. You can walk the complete 3-mile circuit starting at the kiosk of
terrasse Dufferin or take a 90-minute tour and discover the wall’s history.
Tour tickets available at kiosk at terrasse Dufferin. % 418-648-7016. Tour: C$10
(US$8.50) adults, C$7.50 (US$6.50) seniors, C$5 (US$4.25) kids 6–16, free for children
5 and under. Open: June–Sept daily.
Teen-tempting areas
Québec City is a popular destination for school trips, especially for the
early teen demographic. If you happen to find yourself accompanied by
members of that select group, this section tells you where you can take
them.
Rue St-Jean
This street has shops galore. The busy commercial street on the north
end of the Haute-Ville has souvenir boutiques, clothes stores, inexpensive
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
250

cafes, bookstores and CD shops, and plenty of action to keep your
teenagers engrossed for hours.
Place-Royale
Perhaps your teenagers aren’t that interested in the history of early
French colonialism. Not a problem. This little area has plenty of distrac-
tions for them, including cute boutiques and even cuter cafes. They’ll go
nuts. Just make sure each kid has a map.
The best strolling streets
There’s really no such thing as just “strolling around” Québec City.
Vieux-Québec is so packed with things to see and do, you’re sure to get
sidetracked. But whether you have some specific purchases in mind or
you just want to stretch your legs, the walking suggestions in this sec-
tion should do the trick.
Le Petit Champlain
Basse-Ville
This narrow pedestrian alley tucked into the base of the cliffs right below
the Château Frontenac gets A’s for atmosphere. One of the oldest streets
in Québec City, opened in 1685, Le Petit Champlain originally housed
artists, and then became the home of poor Irish immigrants in the 1800s.
These days, it’s packed with quaint, mostly high-quality souvenir shops,
cafes, and restaurants. It’s a good place to pick up items such as jewelry
made by Québec designers, unique toys, clothing, and French kitchen
implements. Take the Breakneck stairs, and then keep following Côte de
la Montagne down the hill. You hit another set of stairs, and Le Petit
Champlain starts at the bottom of them.
Rue St-Paul
Basse-Ville
Slightly off the beaten track — off the beaten tourist track, anyway — this
street running parallel to the Bassin Louise has an authentic port feel to it.
It’s also packed with antiques shops, has a number of good art galleries, and
boasts quiet little eateries where you can have a leisurely drink or coffee.
Take Côte du Palais (just off rue St-Jean) and walk down past the city wall
and down rue des Vaisseaux-du-Roi and you’ll hit rue St-Paul. Turn right.
Rue St-Joseph
St. Roch
This is by far the most happening part of Québec City, and, unlike the rest,
this strip is only a couple of years old. It already features several destina-
tion boutiques, some of the city’s hottest restaurants, and a handful of
nightlife options. The street was always there but recently it became the
target of an urban renewal scheme. It feels trendy but not touristy, which
could be a welcomed relief after a day of seeing the sights.
Chapter 19: Exploring Québec City 251

Promenade de la Pointe à Carcy
Old Port
The cruise-ship business in Québec City’s port has really taken off over
the last decade, and the port area has benefited from the increased activ-
ity. Unlike in Montréal, though, there is no commercial street running along
Québec City’s port (rue Dalhousie is the closest one). Instead, city author-
ities have transformed this area into a kind of urban park, with a bike trail,
fountains, and scrupulous security guards who make sure tourists don’t
get too close to the edge. It’s a great place to park on a bench and read or
just wander around gazing at the river traffic.
Rue du Trésor
Haute-Ville
This little street runs between rue St-Louis and rue de Buade and is a ver-
itable outdoor art market, with artists lined up the whole length of the
street selling paintings, sketches, and engravings of various styles and
qualities. More for shopping than walking, it’s still worth checking out, just
for the atmosphere. Head here if you want your caricature drawn.
Seeing Québec City by guided tour
If you’re short on time, a guided tour is a good option for seeing a lot of
Québec City with minimum effort. Walking is my first choice and should
be yours (as long as you’re able), but you can also get around by bus
tours, horse-drawn carriages, or even river cruises. This section gives
you my recommendations.
Walking tours
Walking is the best way to see the nooks and crannies of Québec City —
and there are many of them. With a walking tour, you get history, hear
insider info, and have areas of interest pointed out to you that you prob-
ably wouldn’t normally notice on your own. Most walking tours leave
from the terrasse Dufferin. The best idea is to see what’s being offered 
at the nearby Centre Infotouriste at 12 rue Ste-Anne just opposite the
Château Frontenac at Place d’Armes (% 800-363-7777). Or call the
Association des guides touristiques de Québec (% 800-208-1463 or
418-683-1591), which provides guides for any length of time, on foot, or
in your car or theirs.
Here are two other good tour companies:
 La Compagnie des Six Associés (% 418-802-6665) also offers the-
matic tours. “Vice and Drunkeness,” explaining the underbelly of
the history of Québec, is a popular one. Book your tour at the main
tourist office opposite Place d’Armes. Tours cost C$12 to C$15
(US$10.25–US$12.75) per person.
 A new initiative, Québec Trail, is a series of over 40 stops on an
audio tour. For around C$10 (US$8.50) travelers can buy a set of
headphones at tourist offices as well as some stores, hotels, and
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
252

restaurants around town. They come with a special adapter that
allows you to plug in to the recording at each stop. It gives you the
ultimate flexibility in seeing the sites — you can pick up on another
day or just at random whenever you happen upon a listening post.
Best of all, you get to keep the earphones when you’re done.
Bus tours
If you’re not up to walking, or if it’s extremely hot (or cold) and you want
to escape the elements (while not missing the sites), bus tours are a good
solution. Two good companies offer tours year-round:
 Les Tours du Vieux-Québec (% 800-267-8687 or 418-664-0460)
offers guided tours in small comfortable buses, both inside the city
and in surrounding areas like Île d’Orléans. Québec City tours last
about two hours and cost C$30 (US$25.50) per person.
 Les Tours Dupont (% 888-558-7668 or 418-694-9226; www.
tourdupont.com) offers more-luxurious tours in bigger buses,
both of the city and the surrounding area. Tours last about two
hours and cost C$27 (US$23) per person.
Horse-drawn carriage tours
Get a tour of Québec City the old-fashioned way and experience not only
the sights and sounds but also the smells of yesteryear. You can visit
Vieux-Québec by calèche all year round. Rides cost C$75 (US$63.75) 
for 40 minutes. You can pick one up on the fly at Place d’Armes or call
Calèches du Vieux-Québec (% 418-683-9222) or Balade en Caleche et
Diligance (% 418-624-3062).
River cruises
You won’t get the most out of seeing Québec City by boat, but if you like
cruises, Croisières AML (% 800-563-4643 or 418-692-1159) offers 90-
minute cruises aboard a renovated 1930s ferry, departing three times
daily from Quai Chouinard, 10 rue Dalhousie, near Place-Royale in the
Lower Town. The show comes with bilingual guides, and full dining facili-
ties and a bar are right on the boat. Evening cruises last two and a half
hours with dining and dancing included. Prices for day cruises start at
C$30 (US$25.50) for adults, C$28 (US$23.75) for seniors, and C$13
(US$11) for kids, and go up in the evening. You can buy tickets at the
kiosk on terrasse Dufferin.
Hitting the Historical Highlights 
of Vieux-Québec
Québec City is history. Step through any gate leading in to the Old City,
and you see that for yourself. The walking tour in this section stops at
some of the top historical sites and shows you some other nice things to

Historical Highlights of Vieux-Québec
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
254

see (and eat) along the way. You can wander along the itinerary at your
own leisure or do the whole thing backward, if you like. Some sights are
bound to interest you more than others, so pick and choose as you go
along.
Start by entering Vieux-Québec at the Porte St-Louis, which you reach
either by walking along the Grande-Allée or by turning left onto rue 
St-Louis from avenue Honoré-Mercier. The gate was designed to bring to
mind medieval castles and horsemen, but it’s actually Victorian — the
work of an Irish architect that was completed in 1878.
A few steps inside the gate, on your left, is the Fortifications of Québec
National Historical Site, where you can learn about the history of the
wall that surrounds the Old City. The wall, originally wooden, was first
erected by the French in 1693. The same French started working on the
stone wall in 1745, but they had to hand the job over to the English when
the Brits conquered the city in 1759.
Continue along rue St-Louis until your reach rue du Parloir, turn left and
you’ll see the museum and the monastery of the Ursulines, the first
order of French nuns to set up shop in Québec, around 1630.
At the end of rue du Parloir, turn right on rue Donnacona, and then left
on rue des Jardins. Follow this street to rue Ste-Anne. On your left, you’ll
see the Hotel Clarendon, the oldest hotel still operating in Québec City,
built in 1870. Wander in and check out the Art Deco entrance. If all this
history is exhausting you, the L’Emprise cafe/bar inside the hotel is a
great place to stop for a coffee or beer.
Continue along rue des Jardins, and you’ll see Québec City’s old Hôtel-de-
Ville (City Hall), built in 1895. If you’re interested in knowing more about
the history of urban planning in Québec, the Centre d’Interprétation de
la Vie Urbaine de la Ville de Québec (City Hall Interpretation Center) is
in the basement.
Continue along rue des Jardins to the end of the Place de l’Hôtel-de-Ville,
turn right on Côte de la Fabrique and you’ll see the Basilique Notre-
Dame, first built in 1647, and then destroyed and built again about five
times over until it took its final form around the end of the 1700s. (Well,
actually, they were still putting finishing touches on it in 1959.) On the
same street, you’ll see the Musée de l’Amérique Française (Museum of
French America), where you can get a thorough history of French colo-
nization in the New World, in Québec, and beyond.
Time for another coffee break? Or maybe some lunch or a light snack?
You’re not too far from rue de Buade where the Café Buade, 31 rue Buade
(% 418-692-3909) offers pizzas, sandwiches, coffee, and the like at a rea-
sonable price.
Keep going along rue de Buade until you reach rue du Trésor. The name
(which means “treasury”) dates from the French regime, when colonists
Chapter 19: Exploring Québec City 255

used to pass along this street on their way to pay their taxes. Now it’s a
great little walkway where artists hang their paintings, sketching, etch-
ings, and more.
Rue du Trésor takes you to rue Ste-Anne right in front of Place d’Armes.
Turn left, and you’ll see the Infotouriste Center. Cross Place d’Armes,
and you’ll be standing in front of the majestic, castlelike Château
Frontenac, built in 1893 by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
If want to see the Basse-Ville from here, walk to the lookout area in front
on the Château Frontenac. On your left are the Breakneck stairs, there
since 1682. Take the stairs down to Côte de la Montagne, and then keep
going down on this street until you reach the next set of stairs. These
take you to Le Petit Champlain, one of the oldest streets in the city,
where the houses date to the 17th and 18th centuries — a shopper’s
delight, to boot.
Your last stop should be the Place-Royale, down the hill from Le Petit
Champlain (toward the river). This is where it all started. It’s the spot
where the French explorer Samuel de Champlain founded New France 
in 1608.

Chapter 20
Shopping the 
Québec City Stores
In This Chapter
 Checking out shopping opportunities in Québec City
 Finding the big-name stores
 Discovering Québec City’s best malls and shopping neighborhoods
O
n the whole, people in Québec City like things a little classy. Of
course, given that tourism is a mainstay industry here, not-so-classy
trinket boutiques abound, especially in the Old City. But don’t be fooled
by the trashy souvenir shops. Unique, high-quality items are available
throughout Québec City, from Inuit art to antiques and clothing. Just
don’t go looking for bargains — you’re likely to be disappointed.
Surveying the Scene
Souvenir stores aside, Québec City is probably best known as a place 
to buy antiques, art, and crafts. The antiques stores keep their tourist
clientele in mind and tend to specialize in smaller, more portable items
like lamps, china, and bedside tables and stools. Prices for antiques are
reasonable, partly because Québeckers on the whole are not especially
drawn to antiques (leaving plenty left over for you).
For a small city, Québec has a lot of art galleries. They run the full gamut
of price and style, offering both traditional and abstract works done by
new and established artists at both steep and affordable prices. Most —
but not all — of the works for sale are from Québec artists. If you don’t
feel up to investing in art, the city has plenty of stores featuring less
expensive crafts and creations from local artisans.
If shopping for clothes, books, or CDs is more your style, you’ll find
plenty of ways to spend your cash — believe me. Québec City residents
are known for stylish dressing, and while you won’t find the quantity of
local designers available in Montréal, the clothing selection here reflects
Québeckers’ flair. Most books for sale in the city are French, but plenty

of English books are available, as well. The city has a decent selection of
music, but if you’re looking in particular for French music, the selection
is excellent.
Outside of the Old City, stores’ hours in Québec City are similar to those
throughout Canada. Most stores open at 9 or 10 a.m. and close at 5 or 
6 p.m., Mondays through Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Thursdays and
Fridays, stores usually stay open until 9 p.m. Many stores open Sunday
from around noon until 5 p.m. In the Old City, however, hours are very
seasonal. During the high season, you’re likely to find shops open long
hours, pretty much every day.
Remember to keep track of your purchases. You have to come clean at
the border and fork over the details of your purchases to Customs
agents before you leave. If you stay in Canada more than two days, you
can bring back US$800 in goods without paying duty. This includes 200
cigarettes, 100 cigars, and 1 liter of an alcoholic beverage. If you stay
less than two days, your limit drops to US$200. If you buy more than
this, no one will throw you in jail — you’ll just have to pay a tax that’s 
a small percentage of the amount that surpasses your limit. Check out
Chapter 12 for more details.
Before you commence your Québec City shopping frenzy, don’t forget
the Canadian tax man (or tax woman; these are modern times). You
must pay taxes adding up to roughly 15 percent of your purchases. For
information on how to get a refund on the Goods and Services Tax
(which is about half the 15 percent), see Chapter 4.
Checking Out the Big Names
Downtown Québec City has only one big-name store, and that’s Simons
at 20 Côte de la Fabrique (% 418-692-3630). This slightly upscale
department store, which opened in 1840, offers a good selection of cloth-
ing and accessories for men, women, and children, plus fine bed linens.
This is the place to come if you unexpectedly find yourself in the middle
of a cold spell and need a hat, scarf, and gloves — not a likely event until
at least mid-October, but you never know.
The other big department store you find in Québec City is La Baie (The
Bay, short for the Hudson’s Bay Company), but you have to leave the
confines of the downtown area and head out to the shopping malls in
the ’burbs. You can find La Baie stores at Galeries de la Capitale, Place
Fleur de Lys, and Place Laurier.
Going to Shopping Malls
People really like to shop here, and for a small city, Québec has an
impressive roster of shopping malls. Maybe the winter weather drives
Québeckers into these indoor havens of consumption.
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
258

You have two shopping mall options within walking distance of the 
Old City:
 Les Promenades du Vieux-Québec, 43 rue de Buade (% 418-692-
6000): This small complex is just a few steps away from the Château
Frontenac and has 12 upscale boutiques, where you can find jewelry,
furs, perfumes, gifts, candies, fine art, arts and crafts, and more.
 Place Québec, 880 av. Honoré-Mercier (% 418-529-0551): A multi-
level shopping complex attached to the Delta Hotel, this mall has
30 boutiques and is a ten-minute walk from the Old City.
Trouble is (for visitors, anyway), the biggest and best of the malls are a
fair distance from the Old City. But if mall crawling is what you want (not
a bad alternative when the weather works against you), catch a cab and
take off to one of the following:
 Galeries de la Capitale, 5401 bd. des Galeries (% 418-627-5800): 
A 20-minute drive from the Old City, this mall has 250 shops and a
small amusement park with games, rides, an IMAX theater, 12
movie theaters, and assorted restaurants.
 Place Fleur de Lys, 552 bd. Wilfrid-Hamel (% 418-529-8128):
Winner of the Canadian Maple Leaf Award for the most beautiful
shopping interior design, Place Fleur de Lys is a five-minute drive
from downtown Québec City and has 250 boutiques plus major
chains.
 Place Laurier, 2700 bd. Laurier (% 800-322-1828): A good 20-
minute drive from the Old City, this is the mother of all shopping
centers. It’s the largest shopping center in Eastern Canada with
some 350 stores.
 Place Sainte-Foy, 2450 bd. Laurier (% 418-653-4184): This is a
fashionable mall, featuring 130 stores and boutiques; a 20-minute
drive from the Old City.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
You can find loads of great shopping in Québec. I assume you want to
spend most of your time in the Old City, or not too far from it, maybe
venturing out, at most, to Grande-Allée for a change of scenery. So, for
your shopping ease and pleasure, I break the city down into six shop-
ping areas, discussed in the six following sections. Like almost every-
thing else I recommend in the Québec City part of this book, all these
areas are within walking distance of each other.
For antiques and art, you can’t beat the rue St-Paul area in the Basse-
Ville. For souvenirs, arts and crafts, and even clothes, I recommend the
area around Le Petit-Champlain in the Basse-Ville, including Place-
Royale and the area around the Château Frontenac in the Haute-Ville.
Chapter 20: Shopping the Québec City Stores 259

For less touristy types of shops, rue St-Jean is the place to go, with its
books, CD, and clothes stores (and plenty of cafes and restaurants to
rest between your shopping sprints). Finally, if you really want a break
from the Vieux-Québec experience, I recommend strolling down Grande-
Allée to avenue Cartier, where you find a small concentration of shops
with items like clothes, outdoor items, and home décor. Yet, rue St-
Joseph is perhaps the most exciting shopping street of them all. It is
away from Vieux-Québec, somewhat, but here’s where you’ll see a more
authentic version of the city.
Rue St-Paul
You can get to rue St-Paul in the Basse-Ville by following rue St-Pierre
from Place-Royale. Or, you can start at the other end of the street. On
rue St-Jean, take Côte du Palais. You pass through the city walls, and
then walk down the slope to the Basse-Ville via rue des Vaisseaux-du-Roi.
This is where you find the biggest concentration of antiques stores in
the city. But these aren’t the kind of dusty, cluttered antiques stores you
find on rue Notre-Dame in Montréal (see Chapter 12). Instead, most are
neat places that specialize in a certain type of antiques. There’s defi-
nitely something for everyone. This section lists a few places to visit on
your stroll down rue St-Paul.
For old and rare books, check out Argus Livres Anciens, 160 rue St-Paul
(% 418-694-2122). If Victorian and Edwardian furniture, silver, porce-
lain, and paintings are your thing, stop by Boutique aux Memoires
Antiquités, 105 rue St-Paul (% 418-692-2180). For authentic Québec
pine furniture, I recommend Gérard Bourguet Antiquaire, 97 rue St-Paul
(% 418-694-0896). The store offers many 18th- and 19th-century pieces,
but you can expect to pay a fair penny for them. L’Héritage Antiquité,
110 rue St-Paul (% 418-692-1681), also specializes in Québec furniture
and sells clocks, oil lamps, and ceramics. For engravings, prints, and
maps, the best place is Les Antiquités du Matelot, 137 rue St-Paul 
(% 418-694-9585). And if you’re more interested in curiosities from 
the 1960s and 1970s, don’t miss Décennie, 117 rue St-Paul (% 418-694-
0403), for retro chairs, lamps, and décor.
Rue St-Paul’s other specialty is art galleries, although you’d be wise to
wander off along some of the neighboring streets like rue Sault-au-Matelot
or rue St-Pierre to get the full experience. Galerie Madeleine Lacerte, 
1 Côte Dinan (% 418-692-1566), is one of the best-known galleries of the
neighborhood. It sells contemporary paintings and sculpture. Galerie
d’art Alain Lacaze, 131 rue St-Paul (% 418-692-4381), sells oils and
watercolors.
Other noteworthy boutiques along rue St-Paul fall outside of the art and
antiques category. Vitrine, 329 rue St-Paul (% 418-694-7384), special-
izes in furniture and other objects made by local designers. For one of
the best selections of fur coats in the Old City, visit Les Fourrures du
Vieux-Port, 55 rue St-Pierre (% 418-692-6686).
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
260

Rue St-Jean
Rue St-Jean is probably the least quaint, yet most practical, of the shop-
ping areas in the Old City. A busy commercial street, here you find a
number of Québec chain stores. It’s also a good place to head if you
want specialty food items, books, CDs, clothes, or a comfortable pair of
walking shoes. I include rue de la Fabrique in this area, which is a contin-
uation of rue St-Jean uphill toward the Hôtel-de-Ville. The same bustling
commercial spirit reigns on both streets.
This is the destination for clothes. For comfortable but elegant men’s
and women’s fashions, Québec chain America, 1147 rue St-Jean (% 418-
692-5254), is a good place to start. Bedo, 1161 rue St-Jean (% 418-692-
0623), another chain, carries edgier, urban women’s and men’s fashions.
Another good option for sportswear is NRJ, 1121 rue St-Jean (% 418-
694-0086). Louis Laflamme, 1192 rue St-Jean (% 418-692-3774), carries
stylish menswear. If you’re looking for something to keep your feet com-
fortable (or warm), the Canadian chain Roots, 1150 rue St-Jean (% 418-
692-2000), sells high-quality leather shoes at decent, although not bar-
gain, prices. A little more into the “interesting” category of clothes,
Artisans du Bas-Canada, 30 Côte de la Fabrique (% 888-339-2109 or
418-692-2109), offers a wide selection of outdoor garments, gifts, and 
collectibles.
Food-wise, if you’re a chocolate fanatic, you’ll love Choco-Musée Érico,
634 rue St-Jean (% 418-524-2122), where, with two days’ notice, choco-
latier Éric Normand sculpts whatever you like out of chocolate. You can
get good ice cream here, too. For maple products and Québec wines and
beers, visit the Marché Je-An-Dré, 1097 rue St-Jean (% 418-692-3647).
You can find plenty of bookstores along rue St-Jean. Although many are
principally Francophone (French-speaking), you can find English books
and magazines at Archambault, 1095 rue St-Jean (% 418-694-2088), 
and at the Maison de la Presse Internationale, 1050 rue St-Jean (% 418-
694-1511).
For gifts, souvenirs, and jewelry, check out Abaca, 54 Côte de la Fabrique
(% 418-694-9761), and Collection Lazuli, 774 rue St-Jean (% 418-525-
6528).
Le Petit-Champlain/Place-Royale
Although extremely touristy, Place-Royale and Le Petit-Champlain are
still your best bets for souvenirs. Although cheap trinkets abound, most
stores offer high-quality items, and many specialize in handmade and
Québec-made clothing and jewelry. Plus, a number of reputable art gal-
leries are located here.
If you’re in the market for one of those striped French nautical shirts,
you can find it at the nautical store Le Capitaine d’à Bord, 63 Petit-
Champlain (% 418-694-0624). Into leather? Peau sur Peau, 85 Petit-
Champlain (% 418-692-5132), offers leather clothing, shoes, luggage,
Chapter 20: Shopping the Québec City Stores 261

and accessories from Québec and international designers. Ibiza, 57
Petit-Champlain (% 418-692-2103), also carries leather goods by
Québec designers. Zazou, 31 Petit-Champlain (% 418-694-9990), sells
clothes made by Québec designers.
For wines and spirits, stop at the Maison des Vins, 1 Place-Royale 
(% 418-643-1214). Maple products, a true Québec specialty, abound 
at the Petit Cabane à Sucre, 94 Petit-Champlain (% 418-692-5875).
Le Jardin de l’argile, 51 Petit-Champlain (% 418-692-4870), carries
Québec-made porcelain, pottery, bronze works, and more.
Château Frontenac
Most of the nicer boutiques in and around the Château Frontenac in the
Haute-Ville carry objects best qualified as “upscale souvenir.”
Among these, don’t miss the boutiques that sell Inuit art. Aux Multiples
Collections, 69 rue Ste-Anne (% 418-692-1230), offers a wide selection
of Native Canadian carvings in stone, bone, and tusk. You can also find a
great choice of Inuit carving at Brousseau et Brousseau, 35 rue St-Louis
(% 418-694-1828). Kulik Art Inuit, just inside the Château Frontenac at
1 rue des Carrières (% 418-692-6174), has a wide range of Inuit prints
and sculptures.
Two other boutiques worth checking out in this area include the highly
specialized Boutique de Noël de Québec (Québec Christmas Boutique),
47 rue de Buade (% 418-692-2457), which is open all year long. It’s defi-
nitely a good spot to pick up a souvenir for that somebody who has
everything. La Maison Darlington, 7 rue de Buade (% 418-692-2268),
specializes in imported woolen garments including merino and cash-
mere sweaters, caps, ties, scarves, and gloves for children and adults.
If you want to bring back some locally made beer or Québec liqueurs
made out of blueberry or maple syrup, the SAQ Signature spirits bou-
tique has them. It’s located just inside the Château Frontenac at 1 rue
des Carrières (% 418-692-1182).
Avenue Cartier
As nice as the Old City is, its intensely touristy and cramped shops can
make you feel claustrophobic. Avenue Cartier is a great place to go for a
little breathing space. Leave the Old City from the St-Louis Gate and walk
along rue St-Louis until it turns into Grande-Allée. Continue walking west
for ten minutes and until you reach avenue Cartier on your right.
Avenue Cartier, with its many boutiques, feels like a pedestrian prome-
nade even though cars are allowed to drive through. It’s a nice place to
stroll about and has plenty of interesting cafes and restaurants where
you can take a break. For practical (but stylish) clothes, Chez Boomer,
970 av. Cartier (% 418-523-7047), carries items for children and adults;
Paris Cartier, 1180 av. Cartier (% 418-529-6083), has elegant clothes for
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
262

women. For home décor items, check out Zone, 999 av. Cartier (% 418-
522-7373), a great store that’s loaded with extremely tempting stuff for
the kitchen, bathroom, or living room. Azimut, 1194 av. Cartier (% 418-
688-7788), is an excellent outdoors store that sells tents, sleeping bags,
and hiking boots. A good spot for CDs is Sillons le Disquaire, 1149 av.
Cartier (% 418-524-8352).
Rue St-Joseph
Rue St-Joseph is a brand new Main Street for Québec City’s residents. It’s
somewhat removed from the tourist sites. You’d never cross it just wan-
dering around unless a local steers you straight. It’s not far at all, just
hidden away to some extent.
Rue St-Joseph may seem like an odd place for an upscale shopping dis-
trict filled with “destination boutiques.” This is mainly due to the fact
that, as a visitor, your perception of the city, with the Château Frontenac
in the middle, is somewhat skewed.
At the end of the 20th century, Québec City was a doughnut, meaning
that most of the population lived in the surrounding areas, leaving the
middle empty. And admittedly, Vieux-Québec can feel deserted at times.
In recent years, municipal authorities have taken it upon themselves to
reverse this demographic trend and the once dingy rue St-Joseph is now
at the heart of a major urban renewal project. It’s rapidly becoming a
glitzy strip filled with shops, restaurants, cafes, and bars attractive to
both tourists and residents alike.
The buildings are larger in scale than in Vieux-Québec, the town-house
architecture more recent; still, most of it dates from the late 19th cen-
tury. Yet, rue St-Joseph feels light years away from the colonial smarmi-
ness of the historic district. It’s a more day-to-day reflection of
contemporary Québec City, hip and tuned into global culture.
Rue St-Joseph’s recent makeover is far from complete. Yet already
there’s plenty of buzz and momentum. It’s definitely the most exciting
place to go in Québec City outside the traditional tourist agenda.
So, what do large European fashion houses think about the potential 
of this street? Well in November 2005, Hugo Boss, 505 rue St-Joseph Est
(% 418-522-4444), opened its first “all-brand” store in North America.
Unlike other Hugo Boss outlets on the continent, this one promises to
carry every line made by the German designer. Swedish athletic outfit-
ters, Peak Performance, 565 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-525-5003), chose
to open its first North American store just down the street.
Other stylish boutiques include Flirt, 525 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-529-
5241), for lingerie, sexy undergarments, and boudoir apparel. Québec
City is such a romantic place that you’ll want to get into the act. They
carry different lines imported from Europe, some on an exclusive basis.
Chapter 20: Shopping the Québec City Stores 263

Don’t be shy: The store prides itself on offering a selection that flatters
many different silhouettes.
Next door, Mademoiselle B, 541 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-522-0455),
has unique jewelry designs from New York and Paris. De Nîmes, 557 rue
St-Joseph Est (% 418-523-4848), carries a tight selection of European
fashion lines for both men and women, like Nolita and Rare.
The hills surrounding Québec City are alive with all sorts of outdoor
possibilities. Gear up at Mountain Co-Op Equipment, 405 rue St-Joseph
Est (% 418-522-1200), a one-stop-shop for stuff like hiking boots and
rock climbing harnesses to kayaks and bicycles, and almost everything
in between.
If you’re looking for more-refined pleasures, try Plaisirs de Provence,
529 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-524-4114), a store packed with imports
from France, fine tableware, and small decorative items. Or, Villa, 600
rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-524-2666), sells larger imports, luxury furni-
ture for your chalet or vacation home — supposedly. Baltazar, 461 rue
St-Joseph Est (% 418-524-1991), has an inventory of more contempo-
rary and urban objets.
Benjo, 543 St-Joseph Est (% 418-640-0001), must be the largest toy
store closest to the North Pole. And everyone knows what that means!
Yes, this is where Santa shops. Kids get preferential treatment at the
glassed entrance with small central doors covered by an elegant awning.
Big people, please use the regular doors on the sides. The scale of the
store is such that there’s even a small train helping young, gleeful shop-
pers on their commute between the stuffed animals and superhero
action figures.
Although most of these stores are new kids on the block, Mode Laliberté,
595 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-525-4841), has been in this neighborhood
through thick and thin. It is a longstanding, local, family-run department
store. It’s not as high fashion as the rest of the boutiques on the street,
but, for affordable furs, it is a good place to look.
Tons of food outlets are on rue St-Joseph — and not all of them are sit-
down and formal. De Blanchet, 435 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-525-9779),
is a brightly lit bakery and gourmet shop that stands out for its modern
décor and long display case of cheese. This is an excellent place to pick
up a sampler of Québec’s different varieties. The smaller La Boîte à
Pain, 289 rue St-Joseph (% 418-647-3666), is an artisan bakery with
long lines spilling out the door. It makes innumerable kinds of bread,
some of which are only available on Fridays and Saturdays (so that’s the
time to go). Camellia Sinensis, 624 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-525-0247),
named after the scientific name for tea, has an astounding variety of
leaves from around the world. There is a small sitting area for tastings,
and the knowledgeable staff can help you make an intriguing choice.

Rue St-Joseph used to have a roof covering the whole street. The east-
ernmost portion still does. Passing through the doors, you enter what
amounts to a gloomy and run-down mall. Actually, this is what the whole
strip used to be like before the city demolished most of the roof to initi-
ate the neighborhood’s renewal. Still, chocolate lovers who venture into
this less scenic part will be glad they did when they eventually find
Champagne Le Maitre Confiseur, 783 rue St-Joseph Est (% 418-652-
0708). It’s on the right. This candy factory makes all sorts of chocolate
and treats. Empty boxes are waiting to be filled with truffles from the 
display case. For something out of the ordinary, try the larme du diable
(“the devil’s tear”), a chocolate with zing, made with hot peppers. Peek
through the door into the large kitchen in the back — it’s a scene
straight out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

n the end, Québec City is quite a small town, and staunchly French.
This limits the cultural opportunities, to a large extent, for English-
speaking visitors. Mimicking Montréal, there’s a yearlong festival sched-
ule with diverse programming. I cover the main highlights in Chapter 3.
Québec City also lacks a homegrown performing arts scene, in part,
because the most talented artists move to big-time Montréal, the
province’s largest city. Culture vultures would be wise to follow this
migration to satisfy cravings such as opera, ballet, symphony, cirque
theater, as well as other forms of performance and spectacle. See
Chapter 15 for my recommendations after you get there.
However, for a place its size, Québec City has a booming nightlife. Inside
the walls of the Haute-Ville, the scene has a resortlike feel, like a mis-
placed Yesterdayland from a Disney theme park. Numerous watering
holes line the maze of main streets within the walls. The majority of
them are small, dimly lit, and intimate places, often with acoustic acts
and flickering candles, exposed stone walls, and wooden beams. Folk
music of all sorts suits the setting and is, indeed, the norm.
The Grande-Allée is Québec City’s most popular nightlife strip, with
clubs and bars on a larger scale. Many occupy more than one floor of
the converted town houses where they often dwell, which seem to sway
to the music spilling out of their windows. Most places offer a DJ and
dance floor, but a few showcase live music.
Basse-Ville offers lots of action, but it’s spread out, extending to the
west along the cliffside and into the blue-collar neighborhood of St-Roch.
Because the rents are cheaper, it’s where many of Québec City’s edgier,
more interesting bars have popped up — away from the colonial razzle-
dazzle of the tourist areas. Rue St-Joseph, in St-Roch, is the site of a

major urban renewal project, which already boasts several essential 
destinations.
In this chapter, I tell you about Québec City’s most popular nightlife des-
tinations; some lesser known, but equally great spots; and some places
frequented only by locals. Some are outside the main tourist districts
but are definitely worth checking out. Of course, I do point out the best
spots in the Upper and Lower cities, as well as along the Grande-Allée.
On the whole, you spend less money going out in Québec City than in
Montréal. Drinks are cheaper, distances between hot spots shorter, and
cover charges less frequent. Last call is at 3 a.m., most places don’t get
going until 11 p.m., and the night peaks at 1 a.m. The legal drinking age is
18. Because of Québec City’s quaint size, the dress code is less cosmo-
politan than in Montréal. Lots of clubbers dress in jeans and comfy
sweaters, but don’t let that stop you from looking your best. Ideally, you
want to wear something that gets you through a variety of settings, from
a cozy pub to a swinging dance club.
Finding Out What’s Going On 
Unfortunately, Québec City’s free nightlife listings magazines are in
French. But you don’t really need to know French to decipher event list-
ings, so if you want to find something in particular, go ahead and take a
look. Le Soleil and the Journal du Québec are the two French dailies,
and their Arts and Entertainment sections may prove helpful. Le Guide
Québec Scope is a free cultural magazine, partially in English, with restau-
rant reviews, neighborhood profiles, theater, shopping, and nightlife fea-
tures, as well as event and show listings. Québec City also has an edition
of Voir, a free weekly that comes out on Thursdays, and probably has the
most comprehensive coverage of the city’s cultural calendar.
When deciphering French listings, know that they appear, more often
than not, in the 24-hour clock notation. An easy technique is to subtract
12 if the number is over 12h (noon). So 8h30 is 8:30 a.m., but 20h30, is
8:30 p.m. Also, the days of the week are listed in French. They are:
 dimanche (Sun)
 lundi (Mon)
 mardi (Tues)
 mercredi (Wed)
 jeudi (Thurs)
 vendredi (Fri)
 samedi (Sat)
Chapter 21: Living It Up after Dark: Québec City Nightlife 267

Checking Out the Scene
“No coats; no cover” sums up the action in the winter. Shivering teens
scurry between the city’s nightlife destinations, dressed merely in scant
club-wear and no coats. Many of the bars and clubs have no cover
charge, so many of these brazen partygoers opt to leave their warmer
gear behind, despite the sub-zero temperatures. This way, they avoid the
hassle of coat check at the front door and can head straight to the dance
floor or the bar and bop between as many places as they choose. Other
spots around town offer a more authentic and less rowdy experience,
like neighborhood spots where clamorous patrons talk and laugh over
the music and pints of locally brewed draft beer.
Musically speaking, you hear more songs played by live bands than
dance music tracks spun by DJs. You’re likely to hear lots of live blues,
rock, Celtic, and French folk music. In the city’s popular boîtes a chanson
(literally, singing boxes), you hear Québec folk songs in the chansonier
(or folk) tradition.
For each place in this chapter, if you have to pay a cover charge, I tell you
how much, but these clubs are few and far between. I also include the
opening nights for an establishment, if they’re not open all week long.
Dancing the Night Away: 
Québec City’s Best Clubs
Although your choices may be limited, most clubs play a mix of Top 40,
hip-hop, R&B, techno, and all the requisite anthems from the ’70s and
’80s. Here are my top picks to get you moving:
 Boudoir, 441 rue de l’Église (% 418-524-2777), is, hands down, the
city’s hottest nightlife destination. Other places are somewhat
quaint, but Boudoir feels jet-set and plugged into global culture.
During the summer months there’s a sprawling terrace out front
with heavy mingling action. The main room offers the sharply
dressed and smart-looking clientele several seating arrangements
in warmly lit, Zen décor, with Buddhist and Far East influences. The
downstairs dance-club portion features a vibrating floor. Open:
Daily 3 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Cartier de la Lune, 799 av. Cartier (% 418-523-4011), attracts a 30-
plus crowd, who cut loose and rock out to retro-classics Wednesday
through Saturday nights. Everyone gets down without any pretense
or even a second thought. Attitude? Who needs it? Sunday evenings
are a popular blues night. Open: Daily 2 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover (includes
coat check): Fri–Sat C$2 (US$1.70); blues evenings C$7 (US$6).
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
268

 Chez Dagobert, 600 Grande-Allée Est (% 418-522-0393), is Québec
City’s most famous nightclub and always a good bet. Le Dag has a
stage on the main floor for live performances. Upstairs, an immense
steel dance floor is enveloped by pounding bass, blinding lasers,
and swiveling, colored spotlights. The whole setup is really quite
elaborate. Open: Daily 9 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Chez Maurice Night Club, 575 Grande-Allée Est (% 418-640-0711),
has a main room with several bars that surround a dance floor
packed with a dapper clientele that’s between 18 and 30 years old.
During the summer, there’s plenty of action on the front terrace,
which is right on the Grande-Allée. Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 p.m.–3 a.m.
Cover: Wed–Sat around C$5 (US$4.25).
 Le Beaugarte, 2600 bd. Laurier (% 418-659-2442), in Ste-Foy, is a
cab ride away from Québec City’s historic downtown in the suburb
of Ste-Foy. If you’re looking for that frenzied disco feel with a more
mature crowd, it’s worth the trip. This is the city’s mega-club for
30-somethings and up. Open: Tues–Fri 11:30 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover:
None.
 Le Soñar, 1147 av. Cartier (% 418-640-7333), a basement tapas 
bar with a small dance floor, is an intimate but decidedly modern
lounge. The bar glows like a white cube and is the centerpiece in an
otherwise dark setting; the DJ spins a variety of electronic beats,
ranging from ambient to deep house. Le Soñar is a refreshing
change from the otherwise large spaces, indistinguishable décor,
and music of Québec City’s other dance clubs. Open: Daily 5 p.m.–
3 a.m. Cover: Occasionally Fri–Sat about C$5 (US$4.25).
 Turf Pub, 1179 av. Cartier (% 418-522-9955), is where many 20-
somethings stake out some territory and engage in elaborate
mating rituals. By night, the main floor of this pub is a disco — and
a bit of a meat market. A sports bar is downstairs in the finished
basement. Open: Daily 9 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
Grooving to Live Music: Where to Catch
Québec City’s Best Acts
Live music seems to be Québec City’s raison d’être in terms of nightlife,
especially within the confines of the Haute-Ville. The scale and mood of
the establishments seem best fit for lone balladeers and their guitars or
small acoustic acts. On most nights, you can find rock, blues, and folk,
but not much jazz.
 Bistro Scanner Multimédia, 291 rue St-Vallier Est (% 418-523-
1916), is a bar with oodles of street-cred and plenty of urban edge.
Local indie-rock acts play on a small stage up front and a central
bar divides the room. At the back, you’ll find a pool table and a

computer terminal with free Internet access. Upstairs has more
seating and pool tables. Open: 3 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Charlotte Lounge, 575 Grande-Allée Est (% 418-640-0711), above
the main room of Chez Maurice Night Club, has live music most
nights. Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday feature a Latin band. On
Thursday, it’s a ’70s rock cover band. But on Saturday, a DJ takes 
to the decks. Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: C$3–C$4
(US$2.50–US$3.50).
 Chez Son Père, upstairs at 24 rue St-Stanislas (% 418-692-5308), is
one of the more popular boîtes à chansons, where solo guitarists
belt out ballads from a traditional Québec repertoire, as well as the
occasional Bob Dylan cover. The chansonier takes the stage nightly
at 9 or 10 p.m. The crowd sings, sways, and dances along. Open: 
8 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Galerie Rouge, 228 rue St. Joseph Est (% 418-688-4777), is in a
run-down space with a bric-a-brac bar that serves a pared-down
drink selection, but none of the artsy and eclectic types seem to
mind. Most come for the live acts in the large room at the rear,
which stages up-and-coming bands as well as DJs. Open: Wed–Sun
noon–3 a.m. Cover: Occasionally C$5–C$15 (US$4.25–US$12.75).
 Kashmir, 1018 rue St-Jean (% 418-694-1648), near the Porte St-
Jean, within the walls of the Haute-Ville, is a popular venue among
20- to 30-year-old Québeckers. It has erratic programming, which
ranges from hip-hop and electronica to alt-rock and punk. Open:
Wed–Sun 9 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: Usually between C$5 and C$10
(US$4.25–US$8.50).
 Le Chantauteuil, 1001 rue St-Jean (% 418-692-2030), has been a
venue for traditional folk singers and pub-theater since 1968. This
low-key spot attracts an artsy clientele of writers, musicians,
painters, poets, and photographers, who gather to commiserate
over pints of beer. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: Occasionally
C$5–C$10 (US$4.25–US$ 8.50).
 L’Emprise du Clarendon, 57 rue Ste-Anne (% 418-692-2480), off
the lobby of the snazzy Hôtel Clarendon, is the one spot where hep-
cats can swing to live jazz six days a week (closed Mon). It is a
small space, with the seating arranged around a grand piano, which
also accompanies two or three other musicians sitting in for the
set. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Le Pape Georges, 8 rue du Cul-de-Sac (% 418-692-1320), is a small
place with a tiny terrace in the Basse-Ville, serving a menu that fea-
tures many reds and whites by the glass, cheeses, and cold-cuts. It
closes early during the week (at 9 p.m.), but on the weekend, blues,
cabaret, and folk performers play late into the night. Open: Daily
noon–3 a.m. Cover: None.
Part IV: Settling Into and Exploring Québec City 
272

 Les Voûtes Napoléon, 680 Grande-Allée Est (% 418-640-9388), this
boîte à chansons, set in a downstairs cellar, is very popular for its
warm and friendly atmosphere and entertainers who get the crowd
singing along. Open: Daily 8:30 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
Drinking In the Local Flavor: Québec City’s
Neighborhood Bars and Pubs
The following are the neighborhood watering holes where you’re likely
to find Québeckers — lots of local flavor and character, but not many
tourists:
 La Barbarie, 310 rue St-Roch (% 418-522-4373), a brewpub oper-
ated as a co-op, makes its own beers. You can get a sampler of eight
fine brews, each glass held in a special slot of a wooden carousel. It
is a small, cozy pub, with dangling Christmas lights around the bar.
Open: Daily noon–1 a.m. Cover: None.
 Le Sacrilège, 447 rue St-Jean (% 418-649-1985), is a neighborhood
bar along rue St-Jean but outside the gates, to the west of the walled
Haute-Ville. It is a long and narrow establishment with a beautiful
and verdant back terrace during the summer. It’s crowded — groups
of friends sit down wherever there’s space. Sometimes, this means
joining another table and meeting new people. No worries, though;
everyone is very friendly. Open: Daily noon–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Les Salons Edgar, 263 rue St-Vallier Est (% 418-523-7811), is larger
than a typical neighborhood bar, frequented by a young and hip
clientele. It has two rooms with extremely high ceilings. The front
room has different seating options, along with a long deconstructed
bar where patrons mill about. The back room has five pool tables,
which you can rent on an hourly basis. Open: Daily 4:30 p.m.–3 a.m.
Cover: None.
 L’Inox, 37 quai St-André (% 418-692-2877), is a Québec City brew-
pub that makes about a dozen beers. There is plenty of seating in
the bar and outside on the terrace May through September. This
establishment enjoys a steady flow of regular patrons and hard-
core beer lovers. Open: Daily noon–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Mo Taverne Urbaine, 810 bd. Charest Est (% 418-266-0221), is a
good spot for after-work drinks among a crowd of young urban pro-
fessionals relaxing in this updated tavern décor. In an interesting
twist, there are beer taps at each table. Patrons serve themselves
and pay by the ounce. There’s a tapas menu which offers small
snacks to accompany your drinks. Open: Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–3 a.m.
Cover: None.
Chapter 21: Living It Up after Dark: Québec City Nightlife 273

 Pub St-Patrick, 45 rue Couillard (% 418-694-0618), a former muni-
tions store during the French colonial period, has a warm atmos-
phere, made so by the stone hearth and Celtic musicians who
almost sit among the clientele as they play. This pub has more than
a dozen varieties of beer on tap. If you’re feeling homesick, this
may be a good place to hear some slurred English. Ah, that’s better.
Open: Daily 11:30 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Taverne Jo Dion, 86 rue St-Joseph Ouest (% 418-525-0710),
located in working-class St-Roch, is the oldest tavern in the city.
You know you’re in Deep Québec by the bright fluorescent lighting,
the moose-head trophy above the bar, other dated memorabilia,
and the stern-faced regulars. Currently, this place is enjoying a
revival in popularity among the younger crowd, as the rest of the
neighborhood becomes an increasingly hip nightlife destination.
Open: Daily 8 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
Being Out and Proud in Québec City
The first few blocks of rue St-Jean, to the west of the walled city, just
after crossing Côte d’Abraham, is Québec City’s Gay Village. Along with
gay-run cafes, restaurants, and shops, you also find a growing number of
nightlife establishments, which also cater to a gay clientele. Two of the
best are the following:
 L’Amour Sorcier, 789 Côte Ste-Geneviève (% 418-523-3395),
started out as a lesbian bar, but is now popular for gay men, too.
Whatever your orientation, check your attitude at the door. This
bar is comfortable and unpretentious. It has two rooms, one decid-
edly more modern and minimalist, finished with corrugated metal
as trim. Open: Daily 2 p.m.–3 a.m. Cover: None.
 Le Drag, 815 rue St-Agustin (% 418-649-7212), is Québec City’s
largest gay club with two stories, a drag show, and a dance floor from
Thursdays to Sundays. Something for everyone, really. Men cram
into the main bar to take in the performances, featuring lip-syncing
transvestites. Those who cannot squeeze in can watch the proceed-
ings on closed-circuit TV monitors in the establishment’s other
rooms. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–3 a.m. Cover: Around C$3 (US$2.50).

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
I
t’s just le fun to end with Top Ten lists. Le fun is a catchall
expression — a cute mix of French and English meaning
“good times” — and is a major phrase in Québec. In fact, it’s
so widely used that its meaning is somewhat vague — like
“cool” in English. Go ahead, try it in a sentence, drop it on a
local. They’ll know exactly what you mean. Saying English
words in a French accent seems to inevitably change them
somehow. This part lists some essential items that are le fun
to seek out during your visit.

Chapter 22
Ten Terroir Ingredients and
Local Specialties to Look
for on Your Plate
In This Chapter
 Figuring out when the sap flows from the maple trees
 Sipping microbrewery beers and ice cider
 Playing Duck, Duck, Duck . . . Lamb!
 Seeking the best and most authentic versions of tourtière and poutine
Québec is passionate about its food. This mania probably comes
from the province’s French roots. By now, numerous other immi-
grant communities have also made their mark on the culinary land-
scape, evidenced by the dazzling array of restaurants in both cities and
the large inventory of exotic ingredients available from Montréal’s inde-
pendent grocers.
However, Québec produces many delicacies of its own, from cheeses
and berries to seafood and game. This bountiful land is filled with differ-
ent specialty ingredients that you’ll want to fill up on during your stay —
if you’re adventurous.
Instead of having to trek out into the woods and fetch dinner yourself
(the way it was done around here until not so long ago), Québec has 
an increasing number of restaurants specializing in cooking with local
ingredients. Some of them call this type of menu “market cuisine.” Going
to the markets yourself is another way to get your hands on, and mouth
around, Québec’s terroir. Buying locally is an often-overlooked part of
the eating-organic and “slow-food” activism.

Maple Syrup
Although many in Québec don’t care much for the maple leaf on the
Canadian flag as a national symbol, this province is the world capital of
maple syrup production. Ironic, eh? During the great spring thaw, sap
flows in the maple trees, which sugar bush farmers tap and boil down
into this liquid gold. There are sugar bushes all over Québec, but the
maples are thickest in the region of Montérégie, southeast of Montréal. In
March and April, packs of urbanites trek to sugar shacks for a traditional
maple-syrup-bathed feast. It’s a rite of spring known as “sugaring off.”
Unpasteurized Cheese
Part of what makes Québec distinct from the rest of Canada is the
province’s laissez-faire attitude. This is a good thing when it comes to
cheese — and Martha Stewart would agree. Québec has an outstanding
variety of local, specialty cheeses. Many of the best are made from
unpasteurized milk, giving them extra flavor and richness. This encour-
ages small dairy farmers to make new varieties from the milk of a single
herd — a practice taboo in the rest of Canada because of food-safety
concerns. So, vive la difference! Some of Québec’s more notable unpas-
teurized varieties include: Pied de Vent from the Îles de la Madeleine and
Chateau Mailloux from Charlevoix. Riopelle cheese from Île-aux-Grues,
named after Québec’s late contemporary artist who was most often com-
pared to Jackson Pollock, is the most recent variety to create a buzz
among foodies here.
Microbrewery Beer
Although Molson and Labatt are the two major Canadian beer compa-
nies, locals in Montréal and Québec City often opt for microbrewery
products instead. There are a number of these beers in the province of
Québec, available on tap in bars and in bottles from stores. Unibroue
makes several popular kinds, including Blanche de Chambly and Fin 
du monde. The latter has a high alcohol volume of 9 percent. Its name
means, “The end of the world.” McAuslan brews Griffon, St-Ambroise,
and also an Apricot Wheat Ale. The Brasseurs du Nord make Boreal,
which is probably the most popular microbrew province-wide.
Cidre de Glace
Unable to match “ice wine” from Ontario, Québec’s beverage industry
recently answered by producing “ice cider” from apples. This remark-
ably similar golden and syrupy alcoholic beverage is also meant to
accompany cheese or dessert. It’s gaining in popularity, mainly as a
cheaper alternative to ice wine, which is very trendy at the moment.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
278

Québec’s harsh climate makes it a hostile land for vineyards and produc-
ing a palatable wine. Most of the ice cider comes from the Montérégie, a
region rich with orchards.
Duck from Lac Brôme
Lake Brôme ducks are shipped around the world. The lakefront duck
farm is the oldest in the country. Started in 1912, it remains one of the
largest employers in the region. They breed Peking ducks, which have
delicious meat. In Montréal, there are a large number of restaurants that
have duck, usually a confit de canard or a magret de canard. If Lac Brôme
is not mentioned on the menu, ask the waiter where the kitchen gets its
ducks.
Lamb
Québec has two regions that are renowned for their lamb. On Île-Verte,
in the lower St. Lawrence River, the lambs are “pre-salted,” because they
graze on marshes flooded by brackish water. This makes their meat
extra tasty. In Charlevoix, the government granted the lamb producers
of this region a special designation for their meat. It is the first agricul-
tural product in the province to be protected in such a way. For produc-
ers to be able to label their lamb as de Charlevoix, they must abide by
strict rules for raising their small herds.
Blueberries from Lac St. Jean
After maple syrup, blueberries from Lac St. Jean are perhaps the second-
most-famous agricultural crop in Québec. Blueberries are loaded with
antioxidants and make excellent pies. They’re in season in August. You’ll
see two kinds in the Québec’s markets: wild and farmed. The most
worthwhile are the smaller, wild blueberries, intense and flavorful. The
people from this region are renowned for their warm hospitality — the
region is seen as the province’s heartland of sorts.
Strawberries from Île d’Orléans
The St. Lawrence River widens beyond Québec City. Just downriver, lies
the Île d’Orléans, an island filled with fields, wooded glades, and rural
farming communities. It’s said to be the birthplace of French America,
because it’s where the explorers first settled. The island is also referred
to as “Québec City’s garden,” because it supplies the capital with much
of its seasonal fruits and vegetables. Visitors can go fruit picking all
summer long; many come for the strawberries, in mid-July, which are
particularly delicious.
Chapter 22: Ten Terroir Ingredients and Local Specialties 279

Tourtière
Nutmeg, clove, allspice, and pepper are the four essential seasonings 
for this traditional meat pie, a recipe that dates back to 17th-century
France. The name refers to a special pot with legs used for baking the
pie over the embers of an open fire. There are as many different versions
of tourtière as there are willing cooks in Québec. A lively province-wide
debate rages on between entire regions and extended families about
whose tourtière is best.
Poutine
Two cities in Québec, Drummondville and Victoriaville, claim to be the
birthplace of poutine. This local fast-food delicacy, consisting of French
fries, brown gravy, and cheese curds, is a favorite at snack bars across
the province. Fancier restaurants make upscale versions, with seared
foie gras and the like.

Ten (or So) T-Shirts 
with Tons of Montréal
Street-Cred
In This Chapter
 Wearing a T-shirt as a fashion statement
 Picking popular tees out of the crowd
 Discovering different local designers
 Digging up memorabilia of defunct sports franchises
M
ore so for men, but in general, today, it seems you can get
“dressed up” merely by wearing your best T-shirt. As a fashion
item the tee is often about making a statement, which shows that the
wearer is somehow “in the know.”
So, if you’re looking to take souvenirs back home, but you want to do
better than a T-shirt from the Hard Rock Cafe (“ho-hum”) or something
generic from a souvenir shop on rue Ste-Catherine (“blah”), this chapter
offers some creative suggestions.
These tees are locally designed or inspired, and they’re all the rage on
Montréal’s busy streets. They’re the T-shirts that stand out if you look 
at the streaming crowds long enough. For different reasons, each has
attained a level of cult status among locals.
Fidel Clothing
These fashion tees by a local designer are iconic in Montréal. Everyone
seems to have one, and over the course of a night out you’re likely to
spot at least two or three people wearing theirs. Fidel makes several dif-
ferent series, including a Zodiac series with one of the 12 signs embla-
zoned across the chest in one of four colors. The jury’s still out as to

whether a Zodiac tee makes for a good icebreaker. But Fidel’s so popular
among the high-cheekboned, boulevard St-Laurent crowd that visitors
may wonder if they’re standard issue.
Plateau
A group of friends from this uber-trendy neighborhood came up with
these in response to the rash of “Brooklyn” T-shirts that were somewhat
of a North American fad a couple of years ago. Montréal needed to do 
its own thing, they thought. Now, their T-shirts come in several color
combos, with just “Plateau” across the front in cursive writing. Many
wear it to “represent.” More than just a neighborhood, it’s representative
of a mentality and lifestyle. You can say, “Oh, that’s very Plateau,” and
people will know exactly what you mean.
Nordiques/Expos
For local sports fans, there’s a ton of nostalgia wrapped up in wearing 
T-shirts or other memorabilia from Québec’s now defunct professional
sports teams: the Québec Nordiques (hockey) and the Montréal Expos
(baseball). For those keeping score, these sports franchises are now the
Colorado Avalanche in the National Hockey League and the Washington
Nationals of Major League Baseball.
Baseball fans are rabid for any Expos shirt with 27 on it — it was the
number worn by star player Vladimir Guerrero. A Québec Nordiques
equivalent would be Joe Sackic’s number 19.
McGill/Concordia
A T-shirt from one of Montréal’s two English universities also makes 
for an out-of-the-ordinary souvenir. It’s the red and white of the McGill
Redmen versus the burgundy and gold of the Concordia Stingers. A wide
selection of styles is available at the bookstores of each university on
their centrally located downtown campuses. An increasing number of
U.S. students are enrolling in these schools, due in part to their low
tuition fees. McGill also has quite a reputation: In 2005, it cracked
Playboy magazine’s list of the top ten party schools.
Piknic Electronik
Every Sunday from May to September there’s an outdoor dance party on
Île Ste-Hélène in Parc Jean-Drapeau featuring some of Montréal’s most
innovative electronic music producers and DJs. They play under a gar-
gantuan statue — Man, by Alexander Calder — with stunning views of
Part V: The Part of Tens 
282

Chapter 23: Ten (or So) T-Shirts with Tons of Montréal Street-Cred 283
the city’s skyline. It’s an idyllic setting that draws a mixed crowd in vari-
ous states of leisure: from bouncing revelers to groups of friends loung-
ing in the grass to young families. There’s a T-shirt for the event, and
some revelers have such a good time that they feel compelled to buy
one. You can spot an increasing number of people wearing them about
town — testament to the event’s growing popularity.
Bily Kun
This bar at the main crossroads of the Plateau is also emblematic of this
neighborhood’s signature brand of cool. An evening there will immedi-
ately expose you to a variety of shabby-chic characters who like to drop
by this lively den. The name means “White Horse” in Czech, after the
local microbrewery they seem to favor on tap. They also serve absinthe,
imported direct from Prague. It’s a special place. The T-shirt is for its
most ardent fans.
Wolf Parade
At the end of 2005, Wolf Parade was the latest local band to make a
splash on the alt-rock music scene. Other acts as of late include Arcade
Fire, the Sam Roberts Band, the Stills, the Dears, and the High Dials.
Earlier in 2005, Spin magazine dubbed the Montréal scene as a next-
Seattle of sorts. You’ll find the T-shirt of your favorite Montréal group at
one of the many “head-shops” that sell rock paraphernalia. Several of
these shops are located along rue Ste-Catherine between rue Almyr and
avenue de Blurry. Farther east, another concentration of similar store-
fronts is located between boulevard St-Laurent and rue St-Denis.
St-Viateur Bagels
Fresh, steaming bagels usually get devoured in seconds. They just don’t
last as long as a T-shirt. Perhaps you’ll want to remember the experience
of eating one of these fresh out of the oven bagels with a T-shirt from
this Mile End bakery. Although the other tees on this list intend to be
fashionable, one from St-Viateur bagel is completely unselfconscious,
retro without meaning to be, pure kitsch.
Onetop.ca
Onetop.ca is an annual design competition for Québec illustrators,
graphic designers, and other visual-media artists. A jury selects 40 win-
ners from among the submissions, and the designs show on T-shirts in 
a gallery for two months during the summer (June–July-ish). They’re
slightly more expensive than something store-bought, but a good cut of

the price goes to the artists. So, you can look good in a new T-shirt and
feel comfortable that you’ve done your share in supporting the local arts
scene.
Montrealite.com
The people behind Montrealite.com have really taken the T-shirt-as-a-
blank-canvas idea to heart. This site is the source of many of the cool
images you see on tees around town, inspired by different peculiarities
including the well known Métro/Retro design, which is an apt parody of
the symbol for the ’70s-looking subway system.
Three Monkeys
At this street-couture boutique, located in Cours Mont-Royal, the sou-
venir T-shirt and the fashion tee become one. Three Monkeys commis-
sions Montréal artists to design graphics for their “local series.” The
T-shirts feature landmarks and icons from the city’s streets and skyline,
like Habitat ’67; the rooftop, milk-bottle, water tank somewhere down-
town; the sign above the Five Roses flour mill; and the Biosphere. All 
of these urban snapshots are indeed a part of Montréalers’ collective
imagination.

411.com, which provides small maps
of locations along with the usual listing
information.
In Montréal, the Infotouriste office is at
Dorchester Square (see “Information,”

Dial 911 for emergencies. There are three
types of officers in Québec: the municipal
police, the Sûreté du Québec (comparable
to state police or highway patrol), and the
RCMP (like the FBI) that handles cases
involving federal laws. RCMP officers are
required to speak English. The Montréal
and Québec City police provide service in
English.
To reach the Sûreté du Québec in Montréal,
dial % 514-310-4141. In Québec City, call
% 800-461-2131.
Radio Stations
CISM (89.3 FM) is the University of
Montréal’s radio station, while CKUT (90.3)
is McGill University’s. The two offer a wide
variety of community-based programming
and are great sources for hearing about
upcoming events in the immediate future.
CJAD (AM 800), an English-language talk-
radio station, covers news, sports,
weather, and traffic. Canada’s National
Public Radio equivalent is the CBC
(Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).
Their Radio One (88.5 FM) is mainly news,
while CBC Radio Two (93.5 FM) plays clas-
sical music and has various shows on arts,
news, and current events. For popular
music, try Mix 96 at 95.9 FM, or CKOI at
96.9 FM.
Restrooms
You can find clean restrooms in hotel lob-
bies, museums, and shopping malls.
In Montréal, that includes Centre Eaton,
705 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest; Cours Mont-
Royal, 1455 rue Peel; Les Promenades de
la Cathédrale, corner of rue Université and
rue Ste-Catherine Ouest; and Les Ailes de
la Mode, 677 rue Ste-Catherine Ouest.
There are public washrooms at La Baie
department store, 585 rue Ste-Catherine
Ouest.
In Québec City, the Tourist Information
Centre, 12 rue Ste-Anne, has clean and
spacious washrooms in the basement.
Safety
Montréal is much safer than many U.S.
cities of the same size. However it does
have its seedy parts, like around the red-
light district on rue Ste-Catherine Est,
between boulevard St-Laurent and rue St-
Denis. It doesn’t mean you can’t go there,
just stay alert to your surroundings, and
use the usual urban precautions that are
part of city life.
Québec City, still under a million people, 
is a small town by comparison. The main
guideline here is to avoid leaving valuable
possessions in full view in your car.
They’re best “out-of-sight-out-of-mind” 
in a trunk.
Smoking
As of May 31, 2006, smoking indoors in
public places became illegal throughout
Québec. Now, smokers have to go outside.
Taxes
Canada’s Goods and Services Tax (Taxe de
produits et services or TPS in Québec) is 7
percent and applies to everything but alco-
holic beverages. Québec’s Provincial
Sales Tax (TVQ) is 7.5 percent, calculated
on the price plus the GST.

Taxis
In Montréal, you’ll find taxis lined up in
front of downtown hotels and busy street
corners. At all times, you can hail one
passing by. You can also call a taxi com-
pany directly and usually have a ride
within five to ten minutes. Two major com-
panies are Taxi Co-op (% 514-725-9885)
and Taxi Diamond (% 514-273-6331).
In Québec City, hailing a cab is somewhat
more difficult; however, most businesses
will be happy to call one for you. If you
need to do so yourself, Québec City’s 
two main taxi companies are Taxi Coop
(% 418-525-5191) and Taxi Québec 
(% 418-525-8123).
Telephone
Bell Canada operates the phone system 
in Québec. To get the operator, dial 0 (the
operator will answer in both French and
English). For information or directory assis-
tance, call 411.
Pay phones require C25¢ for a local call,
and you can use any combination of coins
(except pennies). Pay phones are usually
located in glass telephone booths on busy
streets, in grocery stores, or in hotel 
lobbies. Shopping centers usually have
pay phones near the restrooms.
Time Zone
Montréal, Québec City, and the daytrip
destinations mentioned in Chapter 14 are
all in the Eastern time zone. Daylight
saving time is observed from late April
through late October.
Tipping
The standard for waiters is 15 percent.
Cabbies seem to expect 10 percent, even if
you don’t have any luggage. For bellhops,
tip C$1 or C$2 (US85¢–US$1.70) per bag.
For hotel housekeeping, count C$1 (US85¢)
per person per day. For valet parking, tip
C$1 or C$2 (US85¢–US$1.70).
Transit Information
In Montréal, call the STM (Société de
transport de Montréal) (% 514-786-4636)
for information about the Métro, city buses,
or parabuses for disabled passengers. 
For airport transportation, call L’Aérobus
(% 514-931-9002).
Québec’s transit authority is the RTC 
(% 418-627-2511).
