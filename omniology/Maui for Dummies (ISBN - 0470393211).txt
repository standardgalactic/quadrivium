About the Author
Cheryl Farr Leas may live on the mainland, but she’s a Hawaii 
girl at heart. She fell in love with Diamond Head, aloha wear, and
mai tais in 1994 and has had trouble staying away ever since.
Whenever she’s not on the islands, she and her husband, Rob,
make their home in Phoenix, Arizona, where they love to hike the
desert mountains with their German Shepherd, Caleb.
Before embarking on a writing career, Cheryl served as senior
editor at Macmillan Travel (now Wiley), where she edited the
Frommer’s Hawaii travel guides for the better part of the 1990s.
Now happy to be a globetrotting branding consultant and writer,
Cheryl also writes Hawaii For Dummies.


Dedication
This book is for Rob, for loving Maui as much as I do.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks to Lisa Renaud for her encouragement and assistance through-

Introduction
I
have excellent news if you’re planning a trip to Hawaii: Maui really
does live up to the hype. Considered to be among the finest beach
vacation destinations in the world, Maui can fulfill everyone’s unique
island dream, whether you’re 6 or 60, single or with family in tow, the
Survivor type or a newly minted millionaire. Enjoyment is just a matter of
knowing what you want from your Maui vacation and how to make it
happen.
Planning a trip to Maui is easy — too easy, in fact. Far too many people
head off blindly, without bothering to tailor a one-size-fits-all vacation to
their own needs, tastes, and desires. So just knowing that you want to
look before you leap puts you well ahead of the pack.
And picking up this guidebook shows that you have the right instincts
about your vacation planning.
About This Book
Maui For Dummies, 4th Edition, separates the wheat from the chaff — or
the husk from the pineapple. An island vacation, after all, is supposed to
be relaxing and fun. Your trip planning should be easy and fun, too.
I’ve done all the legwork for you, and your vacation will benefit accord-
ingly. I’m not afraid to share my honest opinions, so you can make easy,
informed decisions about what to include in your island vacation — and,
even more important, what not to include. You work hard to set aside a
few precious weeks of vacation time, and I don’t want you wasting it.
Chances are good that you don’t want to waste it either.
Everyone’s tastes and needs differ, of course. In the following pages, I
give you the tools — just what you need, not too much — so that you
can make smart decisions about where to spend your hard-earned time
and money. I try to give you the clearest picture of your choices and
options so you can make informed decisions easily and efficiently.
Because this book is a reference guide, you don’t need to read it from
cover to cover — unless you want to, of course. Instead, start at any
point and flip to the parts that specifically address how you want to
spend your vacation time and money. This way, you can concentrate on
finding exactly what you want to know at any given time.
Think of building your Maui vacation like assembling a jigsaw puzzle.
This book helps you find just the right puzzle pieces so that they inter-
lock smoothly. The finished product will reflect the vacation you and

your family want, not somebody else’s image of what your island para-
dise should be.
Conventions Used in This Book
The structure of this book is nonlinear: Feel free to dig in anywhere. I list
hotels and restaurants alphabetically, with actual prices and frank evalu-
ations to make your search easy and well-informed.
I also include general pricing information to help you decide where to
unpack your bags, where to dine, and what activities to enjoy, although
keep in mind that those prices are subject to change. Still, even if prices
do change during the lifetime of this edition, the information you have at
your fingertips gives you a good idea of what to expect.
In order to help you find accommodations, restaurants, and activities
within your budget, I use a system of dollar signs that you can quickly
scan. These symbols show a general range of costs for one night in a
hotel or one meal at a restaurant (including appetizer, entree, dessert,
one drink, taxes, and tip). Use the following table as your guide to deci-
phering the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant

Less than $150
Less than $20
$$
$150–$224
$20–$34

$225–$324
$35–$49

In addition, I use these abbreviations for credit cards:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
To make pertinent information — such as attractions and main tele-
phone numbers — stand out, I put them in bold typeface.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and your
needs as a traveler:
Maui For Dummies, 4th Edition 
2

 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Maui and how to plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Maui or its beaches. You want expert advice when you
finally do get a chance to enjoy them.
 You’re not looking for a book that overwhelms you with all the
information available about Maui. You don’t have time to wade
through a gigantic list of every single hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion out there. Instead, you want to zero in on the very best places
or most unique experiences on Maui.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Maui For Dummies, 4th Edition, is the
book you’ve been waiting for!
How This Book Is Organized
Maui For Dummies, 4th Edition, is divided into five parts, plus an 
information-packed appendix called the Quick Concierge. You can read
each chapter or part without reading the preceding chapter, but as you
read, I may refer you to other chapters for more information on certain
subjects.
Part I: Introducing Maui
This first part gives you an overview of what Maui is like, so you can
start getting excited about all the fun that lies ahead. It includes
 An easy-to-scan list of the very best of the best — my personal picks
of Maui’s top hotels, restaurants, beaches, golf courses, and more
 A quick overview of Hawaiian history and culture
 An introduction to Hawaiian foods and traditions (How else do you
know whether you want the saimin, the poke, or the opakapaka —
and whether you want to save room for a little haupia for dessert?)
 Time-tested advice on how to divide your time so that you see the
best of Maui without sacrificing that all-important beach and relaxation
time
 The details on when to go: A complete calendar of events, tips on
avoiding the crowds, and the lowdown on Maui’s weather patterns

Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. If Parts I through IV are the
meat of a travel meal, think of these fun top-ten-list chapters as dessert.
Chapter 18 gives you the lowdown on Maui’s fabulous dining scene. You
find a menu guide to Hawaii’s incredible seafood, tips on what to expect
at a luau, and hints on how to enjoy authentic local foods and traditions.
Chapter 19 tells you how to ditch the tourists in order to look and act
like a local, with tips on everything from how to pronounce those
tongue-twisting place names to getting to know a few points of island-
style etiquette.
Chapter 20 focuses on everybody’s favorite topic — romance! I provide
some tips to make your romantic getaway unforgettable.
Quick Concierge
The Quick Concierge puts facts about Maui at your fingertips, from the
lowdown on taxes to Web sites with accurate online weather forecasts
and everything in between. You also get toll-free numbers and Web
addresses for major airlines, car-rental agencies, and hotel chains for
easy reference. And, in case you want more information, I give you 
the contact numbers for all the local visitor bureaus you may want to
consult.

Part I
Introducing Maui

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book introduces you to the wonders of
Maui. You’ll discover why so many people are drawn to
the magical Valley Isle, and you’ll begin to shape the basic
outlines of your trip. I’ll help you ﬁgure out when to go, with
information on Maui’s climate, its least crowded (and least
expensive) seasons, and a full calendar of special events.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of Maui
In This Chapter
 Scoping out Maui’s top-notch accommodations
 Uncovering the top dining establishments and luaus
 Marveling at Maui’s most unforgettable places and experiences
I
n Maui, every day can be a slice of paradise. Here, everybody can feel
like royalty: A simple beach apartment can be your castle; a fresh
papaya and a cup of robust Maui-grown joe, your princely breakfast; a
joyous aloha shirt, your royal robe.
Each of the places and experiences listed in this chapter are bound to
have you exclaiming, “No ka oi!” (“It’s the best!”). This chapter gives you
a sneak peek at the absolute best that Maui has to offer — the cream of
the crop. Skim them all and whet your appetite. And keep your eyes out
for the Best of the Best icons throughout this book.
The Best Luxury Accommodations
Even if you want a different type of accommodations, such as a luxury
condo or bed-and-breakfast, Maui’s luxury scene can accommodate you.
The following are a few of my favorite luxury accommodations:
 Fairmont Kea Lani: Not only is this fanciful Moorish palace on the
sand one of the finest, most romantic, and most relaxing hotels in
the islands, but it gives you much more for your money than Maui’s
other luxury resorts do. For the same price as a standard hotel
room at other places — and sometimes less — here you’ll enjoy a
large one-bedroom suite with a luxurious living room, a complete
entertainment system (including stereo and DVD player), and a
huge marble bathroom. And there’s hardly a better place to
unwind. See Chapter 10.
 Four Seasons Resort Maui: This resort isn’t my favorite on Maui —
the Grand Wailea is grander and the Fairmont Kea Lani is a better

value in the luxury category — but there’s no arguing with the star
power of this ultradeluxe hotel. The guestrooms are oversized,
service is exceptional, and don’t be surprised if you recognize a
famous face or two lounging by the pool. However, beware of those
“oceanview” rooms that overlook the driveway — they can put the
kibosh on your island-perfect mood. See Chapter 10.
 Grand Wailea Resort & Spa: Many tout the reserved understate-
ment of the neighboring Four Seasons, but I’m underwhelmed.
Instead, I prefer this grand beach palace, with its exclusive, tropi-
cal, theme-park vibe; playtime ambience; and over-the-top treats at
every turn. Hawaii’s best pool complex awaits your (very lucky)
kids, and you can indulge in the islands’ finest spa. The ultradeluxe
Napua Tower offers extra amenities, such as personalized
concierge service. See Chapter 10.
 Hooilo House: Perched on a breezy hill above the West Maui 
coast is this elegant Balinese-style bed-and-breakfast, with six
custom-designed suites and graceful open-air public spaces for
romance-seeking couples who can afford to enjoy them. I have a
few quibbles — why no hot tub? — but there’s no denying the tran-
quility of this intimate, romantic retreat. See Chapter 10.
 Hotel Hana-Maui: Rejoice, for the Hotel Hana-Maui is glorious once
again. After years in the doldrums, this breathtaking resort at the
end of the heavenly Hana Highway has been reborn as a luxurious
haven of genuine Hawaiiana, thanks to the folks behind Big Sur’s
Post Ranch Inn. This easygoing yet elegant hideaway on 62 expan-
sive oceanfront acres is reason enough to cruise to the remotest
end of the island. Book a Sea Ranch Cottage for a few days if you
really want to slow down and recharge. The intimate Honua Spa
only adds to the ecstasy. See Chapter 10.
 Kaanapali Alii: Luxury condo living hardly gets better than this
high-rise beachfront condo complex — and with princely sizes
between 1,500 and 1,900 square feet, the whole family can make
themselves at home. Prices are high, but so is quality; and you’ll
get far more luxury for your money than you would if you and the
kids are shoehorned into a pricey hotel room or two. An excellent
choice for families and couples alike. See Chapter 10.
The Best Good-Value Beachfront
Accommodations
Maui is full of wonderful expensive hotels on the sand. However, you can
also find plenty of good-value beachfront accommodations on this
diverse island:
 Kaanapali Beach Hotel: This charming, older, beachfront hotel is
the last hotel left in Hawaii that gives you a real resort experience
Part I: Introducing Maui 
10

at a moderate price. The resort brims with genuine aloha spirit and
good value — and the on-the-beach location can’t be beat. See
Chapter 10.
 Koa Lagoon: This delightful condo complex just may be the top
bargain of the Kihei coast. This midrise building has 42 units — all
with a breathtaking oceanfront setting, with views that most visi-
tors have to pay much more to enjoy. See Chapter 10.
 Mauian Napili Beach Hotel: This family-run hotel may not be fancy,
but it sure is a great deal for the money. And there’s no arguing the
quality of the location — on a fabulous half-mile-long stretch of
white-sand beach with great swimming and snorkeling. See 
Chapter 10.
 Napili Bay: These petite studios on the sand are among Hawaii’s
best beachfront bargains — and they’re an even better deal consid-
ering their prime location. The beach is gorgeous; the snorkeling,
prime; the units, thoughtfully outfitted; and the value, even better.
See Chapter 10.
 Noelani Condominium Resort: This top-notch, oceanfront condo
complex is both an excellent value and a really enjoyable place to
stay. Every unit boasts an ocean view and all the comforts of home.
See Chapter 10.
 The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach: This well-maintained, 1970s
luxury condo complex sits front and center on golden Kaanapali
Beach, making it the ideal island home for travelers who want
home-style comforts. The individually owned condos are comfort-
able, quiet, and wonderfully located, and a much better value than
your average oceanfront hotel room. See Chapter 10.
The Best Restaurants
The increasingly sophisticated Valley Isle rivals Oahu as the fine-dining
island of choice for vacationing gourmands. Whether you want a casual
burger or a lavish meal with fine wine, Maui’s got just the ticket.
The island’s waters are so pristine that the wealth of fabulous seafood
on Maui’s menus should come as no surprise. What you may not have
expected is the degree to which Maui’s chefs celebrate the bounty of
this fertile island, showcasing its fresh produce and tropical fruits.
Maui’s location at the crossroads of the Pacific also guarantees that you
can enjoy an incredible culinary adventure, sampling an authentic taste
of Japan, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia.
Whether you’re looking to celebrate a special occasion or mapping out a
culinary calendar for the length of your stay, don’t overlook these fabu-
lous restaurants:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Maui 11

 Haiilimaile General Store: Star chef Bev Gannon, the queen of
Hawaii Regional Cuisine, continues to deliver one of Hawaii’s finest
all-around dining experiences — top-quality, island-style cooking
joyfully presented in a refreshingly casual and pretension-free set-
ting. A delight from start to finish and well worth the drive
Upcountry. See Chapter 12.
 Lahaina Grill: This Lahaina mainstay still shines as one of most
glorious dining experiences in the Hawaiian Islands. Lahaina Grill
gets it all just right, from the pretty sophistication of the dining
room to the beautifully prepared, generously portioned dishes to
the first-rate service that perfectly fuses personal warmth and pro-
fessionalism. Special-occasion restaurants hardly come finer than
this. See Chapter 11.
 Mama’s Fish House: My absolute favorite choice on Maui is this
delightful seafood house, which offers a magical combination of
food, ambience, and service. Sure, prices are high — but the tiki-
room setting is an archetype of timeless Hawaii cool, the beach-
front setting is glorious, and fresh island fish simply doesn’t get any
better than this. See Chapter 11.
 Roy’s Kahana Bar & Grill/Roy’s Kihei: Nobody should miss the
opportunity to eat at one of the restaurants of Roy Yamaguchi, king
of Hawaii Regional Cuisine. This liege is still at the top of the heap
in the Pacific culinary world, and his food still shines. No matter
which dining room you choose, you’ll find a casual ambience,
friendly service, and an oversized menu of dim sum, appetizers,
imu-baked (underground luau-style) pizzas, and creative main
courses that allow you to eat as special-occasion or affordably as
you want. See Chapter 11.
 Sansei Seafood Restaurant & Sushi Bar: Maui chef D. K. Kodama’s
two superstar sushi bars offer some of the finest dining in the
islands. Choose from an adventurous sushi menu, or opt for 
family-style dining on a slate of D. K.’s palate-stimulating, Euro-
Asian, signature creations. Best of all, the restaurants are casually
comfortable, service is always a delight, and it’s easy to keep the
bill within reason. You can’t go wrong with Sansei. See Chapter 11.
The Best Beaches
Maui boasts an array of wide, breathtaking beaches — more than 80 in
all. Luxurious, golden sands stretch beside calm, turquoise waters, while
palm trees sway in the wind. These settings are what make great vaca-
tions. Even in the most crowded months, you can easily stake out your
own little slice of paradise.
And not that you need any more incentive, but Maui’s best resort coasts
face west, so you can mosey over to a beachfront bar right on the sands
and conclude your day by toasting a Technicolor sunset.
Part I: Introducing Maui 
12

 Baldwin Beach Park: This off-the-beaten-path beach is the perfect
place to spend the day away from the crowds. Pick up a picnic
lunch, bring a blanket, and stretch out on the sand — you’ve found
the perfect place to bask in the Maui sun. Heed the lifeguard warn-
ings, though — the surf can get rough here, especially in the winter.
See Chapter 12.
 Hamoa Beach: This remote, half-moon-shaped beach near the end
of the Hana Road is one of the most breathtakingly lovely in all of
Hawaii. The beach is generally good for swimming and wave-riding
in the gentle seasons, but stick close to the shore because you’re in
open, unprotected ocean. Stay out of the water entirely in the
winter. See Chapter 12.
 Hookipa Beach Park: Come to watch the world’s best windsurfers
pirouette over white-capped waves at this glorious North Shore
beach. Surfers have eminent domain in the mornings; the colorful
windsurfers take over in the afternoons. The action is equally
breathtaking at any time of day, especially when the winter waves
are in top form. See Chapter 12.
 Kaanapali Beach: This fabulous, crescent-shaped beach is reminis-
cent of the Waikiki of yesteryear, before the entire world made it
their destination of choice. There’s something for everyone here:
crystal-clear snorkeling, thrilling wave-jumping, golden sands invit-
ing hours of sunbathing, even beachfront bars for that perfect,
middle-of-the-day mai tai. See Chapter 12.
 Oneloa (Big) Beach: Oneloa means “long sand” in Hawaiian, and
locals call it Big Beach. It comes by both names honestly, for this
gorgeous crescent of white sand is 3,300 feet long, more than 100
feet wide, and is a beautiful spot for swimming, sunbathing, surfing,
body-boarding, or just hanging out and strolling along the picture-
perfect shoreline. See Chapter 12.
The Best Activities and Attractions
The sheer variety of watersports available — diving, surfing, body-
boarding, kayaking — is astounding. What are you waiting for? Go on,
get out and explore the great blue ocean.
 Diving Molokini: This sunken volcanic crater is one of Hawaii’s top
dive spots thanks to calm, clear, protected waters; an abundance of
marine life — from reef dwellers to manta rays — and exciting view-
ing opportunities for every level of diver, even first-timers. You
don’t dive, and you’re not ready to learn? No worries — Molokini
offers excellent viewing for snorkelers, too. Molokini is only reach-
able by boat, so see Chapter 12 for recommended outfitters.
 Driving the Heavenly Road to Hana: Hawaii’s most spectacular
drive is well worth a day of your vacation. For 52 winding miles,
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Maui 13

this blissful highway takes you past flowering gardens, spectacular
waterfalls, and magnificent ocean vistas. Start early and keep in
mind that it’s all about the drive, not about getting to the end of the
road. Rent a convertible for maximum effect. See Chapter 13.
 Exploring otherworldly Haleakala on horseback: The best way to
experience this desolate, otherworldly canyon — painted in hues
of blue and green and red — is to delve deep into the crater with
Pony Express Tours, which leads excellent and informative trail
rides along Sliding Sands Trail into the heart of the volcano on well-
trained and well-cared-for horses. See Chapter 13.
 Exploring Upcountry Maui: Discover the Valley Isle’s bucolic side
on the slopes of Haleakala, where beaches, condos, and tourists
give way to verdant fields dotted with purple-flowering jacarandas
and grazing cattle; rambling, plantation-style ranches; rural towns;
and friendly, local-style warmth. You can experience the inner
workings of Maui’s agricultural heartland at such Upcountry attrac-
tions as Alii Kula Lavender Farm and Surfing Goat Dairy. See
Chapter 13.
 Getting a bird’s-eye view: Touring Maui by helicopter gives you a
whole new perspective as you swoop over the island’s otherwise
inaccessible heartland, where nature has been unspoiled by
modern man. You’ll scale the desolate peak of Haleakala National
Park and enjoy a breathtaking view of the road to Hana that takes
an hour instead of a day. It’s expensive but worth it. See Chapter 13.
 Hitting the links: If you love golf, don’t miss the opportunity to
play at least one of Maui’s premier courses. Glorious Kapalua is the
best, but you have a bounty of quality courses to choose from, duf-
fers. See Chapter 13.
 Learning to surf: Believe it or not, surfing is easier than it looks —
and there’s hardly a feeling finer than conquering a wave. A number
of good surfing schools guarantee that you’ll be hanging ten in a
single two-hour lesson. My Maui favorite is the Nancy C. Emerson
School of Surfing. See Chapter 12.
 Saying “aahh . . .” at the spa: What’s the icing on the cake of any
vacation? A pampering spa day, of course. On Maui, nobody does it
bigger and better than Spa Grande, a temple to the good life, where
the hydrotherapy circuit is reason enough to come. For something
different, try the petite but magical Maui Spa Retreat, a hidden
Upcountry gem that made me finally understand the magic of aro-
matherapy. See Chapter 13.
 Shopping the Valley Isle: Maui has become a premier shopping
destination, especially for those who eschew traditional chains for
boutiques that are artful, offbeat, or unique. The charming, funky
surf town of Paia and sophisticated, cowboy-infused Makawao are
best for creative spirits, while Kaanapali’s Whaler’s Village and the
Shops at Wailea offer creative choices and art-filled galleries in el-
egant, open-air environments. See Chapter 14.
Part I: Introducing Maui 
14

 Snorkeling: Even if you’re not usually the sporting type, you don’t
want to miss the chance to try snorkeling on Maui. The waters off-
shore are so clear that snorkelers are guaranteed to see clouds of
tropical fish in every color of the rainbow, and possibly even a
green turtle or two. You can see a stunningly beautiful underwater
world. See Chapter 12.
 Visiting Haleakala National Park: The massive, 10,023-foot-high
dormant volcano that sits at the heart of the Valley Isle is Maui’s
biggest natural attraction. Its crater looks like a barren moonscape;
no wonder NASA’s astronauts have used it for space-exploration
training. Haleakala is best known for its mystical sunrise vistas, as
crowds of visitors arrive in the dark at predawn hours to watch the
spectacle of dawn breaking over the crater. But take heed, early-
morning-phobes: You can enjoy this wondrous park at any time of
day. See Chapter 13 for details.
 Whale-watching with the Pacific Whale Foundation: Whale-
watching is a premier activity in the islands from mid-December to
mid-March; in some lucky years, the great humpbacks remain in
Hawaii’s warm waters into April. Boats are available to take you
whale-watching, but I love the Pacific Whale Foundation for its
excellent naturalist guides and its commitment to protecting these
gentle giants. The foundation also operates a Whale Information
Station on the road to Lahaina, where you can spot humpbacks
from shore, with an expert, for absolutely free. The Pacific Whale
Foundation can also take you out on terrific snorkel cruises year-
round, even when the whales aren’t in town. See Chapter 12.
The Best Luaus
The best luaus are in high demand, so book your spots before you leave
home to ensure access:
 The Feast at Lele: The folks behind the Old Lahaina Luau (see 
the following bullet) also operate this interesting twist on a tradi-
tional luau. The Feast at Lele is an excellent alternative for romance-
seeking couples or anyone who would prefer a luau with a more
upscale demeanor, a more intimate setting, and/or a fine-dining twist.
The multicourse meal and thrilling performance troupe reach
beyond the Hawaii tradition to celebrate the food and culture of 
the South Seas as well, and the beachfront setting can’t be beat. 
See Chapter 11.
 Old Lahaina Luau: Hawaii’s most authentic and acclaimed luau is
justifiably celebrated and a real treat to experience. Come early to
watch craftspeople at work in the lovely oceanfront setting; you
can also watch as the luau pig is unearthed from its underground
oven, where it’s been slow-cooking all day. The live hula show is
dazzling. You simply can’t do better than this. See Chapter 11.

Chapter 2
Digging Deeper into Maui
In This Chapter
 Discovering the fascinating story of Hawaii’s past
 Experiencing the joys of island-style dining
 Mastering a few key Hawaiian words and phrases
You’ve had a stressful day at the office. The kids have been driving
you crazy, and you realize that everybody in the family needs a
break. Or maybe you’ve just had it with gray skies and gloomy weather.
Then the idea comes, and it’s a gem: Maui. Ah, Maui.
Just thinking about a Maui vacation warms the soul, doesn’t it?
Turquoise ocean, white sand, toasty sun. Surfers riding crested waves as
emerald-green cliffs rise up to meet a sweet, blue sky. Palm trees sway-
ing in the breeze as the strum of a slack-key guitar carries you into tropi-
cal reverie. . . .
Vacation is the ultimate antidote to the stresses and strains of daily 
life — and no destination is more relaxing and restorative than Maui. On
this exquisite and exciting island, days of soaking up the sun are inter-
woven with adventure and plenty of friendly aloha (an all-purpose greet-
ing meaning “hello,” “welcome,” or “goodbye”).
Introducing the Valley Isle
The Hawaiian Islands are just a hair’s breadth larger, in total landmass,
than the state of Connecticut — but oh, what glorious square miles they
are. The islands are actually the summits of underwater volcanoes that
have grown tall enough, in geologic time, to peek above the waves. (All
the volcanoes are dormant except for two on the Big Island.) A volcanic
core gives each island a breathtakingly rugged, mountainous heart.
Most of the island development is at sea level, along the sunny coastal
fringe of each island. Thanks to Hawaii’s proximity to the equator, those
coastal areas experience near-perfect weather year-round: temperatures
in the low 80s, clear skies, and gentle trade winds.

The eight main islands are Oahu (oh-wa-hoo), the hub of the Hawaii
island chain, and the “neighbor” islands: Maui (mow-ee); Hawaii, or 
the Big Island, as it’s commonly called; Kauai (ka-wah-ee); Molokai 
(mo-lok-eye); Lanai (la-nah-ee); Niihau (nee-ee-how); and Kahoolawe 
(ka-hoo-o-la-we). These islands make up more than 99 percent of the
state’s landmass.
Oahu is the most populous of the islands, but Maui is the most popular,
hands down. When people think Hawaiian paradise, they usually think
Maui. Almost everyone who comes to Maui falls in love with the island,
and for good reason: The Valley Isle offers the ideal mix of unspoiled 
natural beauty and tropical sophistication, with action-packed fun and
laid-back island style.
Here are just a few breathtaking facts about this wondrous isle: Maui has
81 accessible beaches — with more miles of swimmable beaches than
any other Hawaiian island. At the island’s heart sits a national park —
featuring Haleakala, the world’s largest dormant volcano. About 3,000
humpback whales visit Maui every winter — out of the 8,000 that popu-
late the entire planet. It’s no wonder that the readers of Condé Nast
Traveler vote Maui “Best Island in the World,” year after year after 
year — 13 out of the past 14 years. That same poll even crowned Maui 
as the “World’s Best Travel Destination” in 2005.
Maui does have a few caveats, however. The Valley Isle is more like the
mainland than any other place in Hawaii (yes, even Honolulu, Hawaii’s
capital and biggest city). There’s even some L.A.-style traffic. (Because
Maui generally has only one main road going in each direction, traffic
can be worse at times in the Valley Isle’s prime resort areas than it is on
Oahu.) The highways and minimalls look comfortingly familiar, or annoy-
ingly so — it all depends on your perspective.
Although hotels have a bit more breathing room on Maui than they do in
Waikiki, the shoulder-to-shoulder resort development is far more urban
than what you find on the Big Island or Kauai. Maui also has the highest-
profile population of relocated mainlanders. A quicker pace of living pre-
vails, which can make Maui feel more like Southern California than
Hawaii, especially in the resort areas. Touristy cheesiness has invaded
the old whaling town of Lahaina, and Kihei’s dominant architectural
style is high strip mall.
Still, nothing can dull the sheen on Maui, which oozes sex appeal. There’s
enough excitement and activity to keep even the most go-go-go travelers
constantly on their toes. And the mainland-style development doesn’t
detract from the island’s natural beauty.
Maui really is a tropical paradise, with golden beaches, misty tropical
cliffs, and countless waterfalls along the Heavenly Road to Hana, one of
the most spectacular drives in the United States. Offshore are two of
Hawaii’s finest snorkel and dive spots. Onshore, at the summit of one of
the island’s two great mountains (between which lies the valley for

Maui pros and cons
Here are some of Maui’s pros, with just a few cons that you should be aware of:
 The Valley Isle boasts abundant, wide, breathtaking beaches.
 Maui wows with its sheer variety of great snorkel, dive, and learn-to-surf spots.
One caveat: Molokini, a sunken offshore crater that’s world famous for snorkeling
and diving, has lost a great deal of its appeal because of shoulder-to-shoulder
snorkel boats and a worn-down reef. The Big Island’s Kealakekua is a much better
snorkel-cruise destination.
 Despite its popularity and high resort rates, Maui has a decent number of beach-
front bargains. If you don’t want to go condo, which is probably your best value-
for-dollar bet, try the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, one of my midrange faves. Still,
you’re likely to pay more for accommodations here than you do on other islands.
 Maui has enough world-class golf courses to keep club-wielders happy for a
good, long time.
 The windsurfers at Maui’s Hookipa Beach are a blast to watch.
 Maui is the humpbacks’ favorite place to hang offshore. If you show up during
prime whale season (Jan–Mar), you’re bound to see them, even if you don’t head
out to sea.
 This action-packed island wins for its wealth of kid-friendly condos and
beaches, plus family activities galore. Your kids will wonder why you haven’t
come here before.
 Outdoor fun is the name of the game here. There’s something new to do around
every corner, from riding a bike down a volcano to taking a snorkel cruise.
 If you have a yen to frolic among waterfalls, head straight to Maui. The drive to
Hana is chock-full of fabulous falls, and at the end of the road is the granddaddy
of ’em all, Oheo Gulch.
 Maui boasts an innovative dining scene, from casual to chic — and with a
wealth of beautifully situated oceanfront restaurants to boot.
 Attention, shoppers: Maui has an increasingly excellent specialty boutique and
gallery scene, especially in Paia and Upcountry.
 Maui has surpassed Oahu as the nightlife capital of Hawaii. A party mood char-
acterizes Lahaina town; the resorts offer lots of after-dark fun; and the Old Lahaina
Luau is Hawaii’s absolute best. This island even boasts the state’s best live theater
in the form of the Cirque du Soleil–goes-to-the-islands show ’Ulalena, plus a
couple of excellent ongoing magic revues.
 Traffic can be a bear on occasion, especially in the prime resort areas. But the
other neighbor islands are catching up quickly, so it’s increasingly difficult to single
out Maui on this front.

which the island is nicknamed), is Haleakala National Park, a wild, other-
worldly place that’s hugely popular with hikers, bicyclers, and sunrise-
and sunset-watchers.
Sixteen golf courses enthrall duffers, while a bounty of Food & Wine–
worthy dining keeps sybarites satisfied. In fact, Maui is a close second to
Oahu as a fine-dining destination. Hawaii’s finest luau, some excellent
theatrical entertainment, and an energetic party vibe in Lahaina make
Maui the best choice for travelers who enjoy after-dark activities. With
so much to do, you can easily fill a week or ten days — and you’ll be
ready to come back for more.
Maui’s attractions are no secret — so expect to battle a few crowds and
pay for the privilege of visiting. I’ve heard an increasing number of com-
plaints about overdevelopment in the last few years. And thanks to the
rules of supply and demand, Maui’s resorts tend to be more expensive
than resorts on the other islands. Booked-to-capacity hotels can be less
than willing to reduce rates; high demand for car rentals often push
rates north of what you’ll find on the other islands; restaurants are
pricey, even at the casual end of the spectrum; and the high cost of all
those available activities doesn’t help matters either. You can drop a
bundle if you choose to splurge.
But you can find good values, too; you just have to know where to look.
And that’s where this book comes in. It’s your key to discovering Maui’s
best: the island’s best values, its loveliest beaches, its most unforget-
table experiences, and its authentic spirit of aloha. In the pages that
follow, I steer you away from the overpriced and overcrowded and help
you design the island getaway that’s right for you.
Maui Nui: Molokai and Lanai
Geologists believe that, sometime around 1,000,000 B.C., the summit of
Haleakala volcano broke the surface of the ocean. Flows from this vol-
cano and adjoining ones joined to form a large prehistoric underwater
land mass called Maui Nui, or “Big Maui.” Encompassing Maui Nui was
not only the island of Maui, but the neighboring islands of Molokai and
Lanai, plus the unpopulated island of Kahoolawe.
Today, Maui County comprises Maui and its two sister islands, Molokai
and Lanai. In prehistoric tradition, the tripartite island group is often
called Maui Nui. Both Molokai and Lanai are covered in distinct chapters
near the end of this book and can be visited on day trips from the Valley
Isle or on extended stays. I recommend visiting one or both of these
islands if you have the time and a yen to explore off the beaten path.
The most Hawaiian isle: Molokai
Sleepy Molokai is a rural island that’s largely untouched by modern
development (although, as residents like to boast, they do have KFC
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Maui 21

now). This lean, funky, unspoiled little island is often called the most
Hawaiian of the Islands because it’s the birthplace of the hula and it has
a larger native Hawaiian population than any other in the chain. Although
it offers some gorgeous, secluded beaches and a few adventure-style
activities, don’t expect any luxury hotels or dining. Now that the Molokai
Ranch has shut down, taking the island’s best hotel and best restaurant
with it, facilities for visitors are minimal. Still, the vibe can be pure magic
for travelers who want a genuine, off-the-beaten-path experience. The
island’s most famous site is Kalaupapa National Historical Park, a world-
famous, 19th-century leper colony that can only be reached by mule,
prop plane, or helicopter. (See Chapter 16 for complete coverage.)
The private island: Lanai
Staying on Lanai (population 3,500) is less a Hawaiian experience and
more a generic, park-yourself-at-a-resort vacation. There’s little to do
here beyond what you can four-wheel-explore in a day, which is the
entire idea of this getaway island. Just about everything that is here is
completely handled through the two ultraposh, mega-expensive resorts
that have taken over this humble little place: the English manor house–
style Four Seasons Resort Lanai and The Lodge at Koele, which sits on
the cool, misty peak of the island, while the Four Seasons Resort Lanai
at Manele Bay sits on the beach, Hawaii-style. Lanai’s fans love the total
pampering and utter solitude. Bill Gates booked the entire island so that
he could get married here, beyond the prying eyes of the media and
public, a few years back. (See Chapter 17 for complete island coverage.)
History 101: The Main Events
Hawaii’s historic tapestry is far richer than the story that can be shared
in these few pages. If you’d like to immerse yourself in the whole story,
pick up Shoal of Time: A History of the Hawaiian Islands, by Gavan Daws
(University of Hawaii Press). Both definitive and delightful to read, Shoal
of Time is the ideal, one-volume history of Hawaii. From the geologic for-
mation of the islands through statehood, the Hawaii story is so well told
that it reads like a novel. It’s so rich with detail that the characters who
shaped Hawaiian history come alive in its pages.
A.D. 700: The first Hawaiians arrive
The first Hawaiians arrived by canoe from Tahiti and the Marquesas
Islands, some 2,500 miles to the south, as part of a greater Polynesian
migration. They likely came ashore first at the southernmost Big Island,
where they found a pristine and blessedly empty island, roiling with fire
from the volcanoes at its heart.
An entire Hawaiian culture grew from these first settlers. As islanders
migrated throughout the chain, each island became its own distinct 
kingdom. The inhabitants built temples, fish ponds, and aqueducts to
Part I: Introducing Maui 
22

irrigate taro plantations. Sailors became farmers and fishermen. The alii
(high-ranking chiefs) created a caste system and established taboos.
Ritual human sacrifices were common. Life was both vicious and 
blissful — just like the islands’ breathtaking landscapes. Piilani was
crowned as Maui’s first king in the late 1300s.
1778: The “modern” world arrives
For more than a thousand years, no Hawaiian imagined that an outsider
would ever appear in these remote “floating islands.” But in 1778,
Captain James Cook sailed into Waimea Bay on Kauai on his ship
Resolution, where he was welcomed as the Hawaiian god Lono.
Cook stumbled upon the Hawaiian Islands quite by chance. He named
them the Sandwich Islands, for the Earl of Sandwich, a great friend and
first lord of the British admiralty, who had bankrolled the expedition.
The Big Island would ultimately be the death of the world-famous
explorer, but not before stone-age Hawaii entered the age of iron, and
the West forged a permanent foothold in these virgin islands. Gifts were
presented and objects traded: nails for fresh water, pigs, and the affec-
tions of Hawaiian women. The sailors brought syphilis, measles, and
other diseases to which the Hawaiians had no natural immunity.
Cook never made it to Maui before his unfortunate demise. Captain Jean
François de Galaup de La Perouse docked at Makena in 1787, becoming
the first foreigner to set foot on Maui soil.
La Perouse ignored the King of France’s orders to claim Maui for France,
but Maui’s days as an independent island were numbered anyway. In
1790, King Kamehameha I defeated the forces of Maui’s last king, Kahekili,
using guns seized from a British ship to establish his iron-fisted rule. By
1810, all the Hawaiian Islands were united as one kingdom, and the new
Hawaiian monarchy welcomed the west with open arms. In 1819, the
first whaler arrived from Massachusetts, establishing Lahaina’s reputa-
tion as the whaling capital of the Pacific. The first New England mission-
aries were not far behind: They arrived on Maui in 1823. Victorian mores
overtook island style, and eventually subsumed it; hula was abolished in
favor of reading and writing, and neck-to-toe dress became the norm.
The first sugar mill began operations in 1828, bringing industry to Maui.
The same year, the first high school west of the Rocky Mountains, Maui’s
Lahainaluna High, opened, which firmly established Western-style edu-
cation in the islands.
At the same time, missionaries also played a key role in preserving
island culture. They created the 13-character Hawaiian alphabet and
began recording the islands’ history. Until this time, history was only
passed down from generation to generation orally, in memorized chants.
The children of the missionaries became the islands’ business and politi-
cal leaders. They married Hawaiians and stayed on the islands, causing
one astute observer to remark that the missionaries “came to do good
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Maui 23

and stayed to do well.” More than 80 percent of all private land was
owned by non-natives within two generations. Sugar cane became big
business, and planters imported immigrants by the thousands to work
the fields as contract laborers. The first Chinese came in 1852, followed
by Portuguese in 1878, and Japanese beginning in 1885. These immi-
grants would have a lasting and influential impact on island culture that
persists to the present day.
King David Kalakaua — known as the Merrie Monarch for the elaborate
parties he threw — ascended to the throne in 1874, marking the begin-
ning of the end of the short-lived Hawaiian monarchy. He performed a
couple of acts of note, however: He built Iolani Palace in 1882, lifted the
prohibitions on the hula and other native arts, and gave Pearl Harbor to
the United States. In 1891, King Kalakaua visited chilly San Francisco,
where he caught a cold and died. His sister, Queen Liliuokalani, assumed
the throne.
1893: Paving the way for tourism and statehood
On January 17, 1893, a group of American sugar planters and missionary
descendants, with the support of the U.S. Marines, imprisoned Queen
Liliuokalani in her Honolulu palace, where she penned “Aloha Oe,” the
famous song of farewell. The monarchy was dead. Hawaii was now a U.S.
territory ruled by the powerful sugar-cane planter Sanford Dole. He and
his cohorts, known as the “Big Five,” controlled the entire economic,
social, and political life of the islands, including Maui. Sugar was king,
and the native Hawaiians became a landless minority.
The first tourists to the islands were hard-core adventure travelers —
among them Mark Twain — who came to the Big Island in the late 1800s
to see the roiling Kilauea volcano. But the new industry didn’t stick until
transportation improved and the sugar industry became too expensive
to support.
In 1901, W. C. Peacock built the elegant Moana Hotel (now the Sheraton
Moana Surfrider) on Waikiki Beach. After a concentrated marketing
effort in San Francisco, 2,000 tourists came to Waikiki in its first big
tourism year, 1903. Tourists came by steamship; the sailing took four-
and-a-half days. By 1936, visitors could fly to Honolulu from San
Francisco on the Hawaii Clipper, a seven-passenger Pan Am plane; the
flight took 21 hours, 33 minutes. Modern tourism was born and was
doing brisk business — until the Japanese arrived, that is.
On December 7, 1941, a Japanese air raid wreaked havoc on the
American warships parked at Pearl Harbor, drawing the heretofore reti-
cent United States into World War II. Martial law was declared through-
out Hawaii for the duration of the war.
Part I: Introducing Maui 
24

1959: Setting the stage for today’s Hawaii
The harsh realities of war gave way to the lighthearted culture of Blue
Hawaii, Trader Vic’s, and Arthur Godfrey. Hotels sprouted along the cur-
vaceous beach at the foot of Diamond Head, known as Waikiki. Resorts
finally arrived on Maui in 1946, when the Hotel Hana-Maui (now glori-
ously restored) opened its doors.
In 1959, this blossoming paradise became the 50th state of the United
States. That year also saw the arrival of the first jet airliners. Postwar
Americans had disposable cash, and now Hawaii was an easy flight
away. Visitors began to arrive in droves, and tourism as we know it was
off the ground, surpassing sugar as the premier industry of the islands.
Kaanapali — Hawaii’s first master-planned resort — debuted on Maui’s
curvaceous northwest shore in 1961.
Tired of the plastic aloha that had supplanted genuine island culture,
Hawaiian elders started making a concerted effort to integrate tradi-
tional hula, chant, visual arts, and values into the experience of visitors.
In 1976, the Hokulea, a replica of an ancient Polynesian voyaging canoe,
set sail from Maui for Tahiti, reversing the ancestral journey and reestab-
lishing ties to the ancient past. Tourism and hospitality employees are
now educated in Hawaiian history, culture, and genuine aloha spirit. The
culture that was once clipped at the roots has now come back in full
bloom — and, thankfully, it’s stronger than ever.
Building Blocks: Local Architecture 
and Design
Thanks to blessedly mild weather that includes cooling year-round trade
winds and temperatures that don’t vary by more than 15°F from January
through July, Maui thrives on open-air living. A seamless blend of
indoors and out is the prevailing architectural style. Why put up a wall
when there’s no reason to keep out the weather — or the dazzling view?
The local architectural style is called kamaaina, or “native born.”
Kamaaina is a style rich in beautiful simplicity and island tradition. True
kamaaina architecture is generally open plan, in keeping with the impor-
tance of multigenerational family living and the strength of the commu-
nity spirit — and to capitalize on those gentle ocean breezes. Decoration
is simple but beautiful, generally focused on the shapes, materials, and
hues of nature.
The finest homes are fitted with natural woods, such as ohia floors and
gleaming koa furnishings. Koa is a gorgeous, slow-growth hardwood that
has been a favorite of local artisans for centuries, thanks to its deep
palette and rich grain. Crafts and furnishings made from the wood are
increasingly expensive, simply because koa is a slow-growth wood that
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Maui 25

takes decades to replenish. If you can afford a piece to take home — 
perhaps a jewelry box or a hand-turned calabash — you’ll likely treasure
it as a family keepsake for generations to come, as island families do.
Not all native materials must necessarily be expensive, however. Some of
the most beautiful and tropically evocative home furnishings are crafted
of simple, light materials, such as bamboo and rattan. Most floor cover-
ings are woven mats, soft and cool on bare feet. The finest are tightly
woven lauhala, crafted from pandanus leaves by talented artisans.
The beautiful shapes and hues of Hawaii’s bold fauna have woven their
way into the island’s favorite fabrics, too. Boldly hued tropical bark
cloths — nubby cotton fabrics that wear well and say “Old Hawaii” with
their large-leafed tropical and storytelling patterns — are famously
suited to the islands. Fabric shops on Maui and throughout the islands
can be located at www.thestateofhawaii.com/fabric.
Despite its glitz and glamour as a tourist destination, Hawaii is funda-
mentally a farming and fishing community — and the story is abundant
in its streetscapes. Simple plantation cottages were built to house the
workers brought in from all over the world to farm the islands’ abundant
sugar, pineapple, and taro fields; now, plantation style is the most perva-
sive architectural style in the islands, especially on the still-rural neigh-
bor islands. With their single-story style, bright facades, and sloping
roofs (many still crafted of corrugated aluminum), plantation cottages
embody the simple beauty of island life. A more elaborate, multistoried
style originated as the plantation manager’s home. Lahaina’s Best
Western Pioneer Inn (see Chapter 10) offers a charming example of this
design style, albeit with a seafaring bent. Ranch life predominates in the
cool Upcountry of Maui, where plantation life gives way to paniolo
(cowboy) style. Paniolo style is built for somewhat cooler weather; as a
result, you’re likely to find it to be a bit more familiar. Expect ranch-style
homes with island touches such as brightly painted exteriors and broad
porches, best evidenced in the Haleakala foothills in and around the
town of Kula. Grander buildings take on Victorian details and the aura of
the Old West. The storefronts of Makawao, in Upcountry Maui, have a
distinct cowboy feel, as do the western-style storefronts of old Wailuku
town and Paia, the funky cowboy-turned-surf town on the road to Hana.
The whaling town of Lahaina was a missionary bulkhead, as the town’s
architecture evidences. Wailuku’s Baldwin Home Museum (see Chapter
13), built in 1831 and Maui’s oldest surviving house, is the best example
of imported Victorianism on the islands.
Maui is roughly halfway between Asia and the mainland United States, 
so the Asian influence is pervasive in island architecture and design.
Pagoda-style influences are evident in residential and commercial archi-
tecture throughout the islands, especially in areas that absorbed the
wealth of Chinese and Japanese immigrants who came to work in the
fields generations ago, and stayed.

A Taste of Maui: Local Cuisine
About 15 or so years ago, Hawaii Regional Cuisine was born. Local chefs
were tired of turning out a stodgy menu of continental fare that was
unsuited to Hawaii living. So they began to celebrate the bounty of the
islands, emphasizing the use of fresh, locally grown (often organic) pro-
duce; tropical fruits; the freshest seafood; and island-raised beef. Their
light, creative combinations often feature Asian accents as a nod to
Hawaii’s multicultural heritage.
This type of cuisine is often disguised under other names — Euro-Asian,
Pacific Rim, Indo-Pacific, Pacific Edge, Euro-Pacific, Island Fusion, and so
on — but it all falls under the jurisdiction of Hawaii Regional Cuisine.
Although there are variations, you can expect the following keynotes: lots
of fresh, island fish; Asian flavorings (ginger, soy, wasabi, seaweed, and so
on) and cooking styles (searing, grilling, panko crust, wok preparations)
galore; and fresh tropical-fruit sauces (mango, papaya, and the like).
Maui has lured some of the world’s finest chefs to its kitchens. Thanks to
its proximity to the Pacific Rim and its large Asian population, the island
boasts a wealth of Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese restaurants.
And, if Asian fare isn’t your thing, you’ll find plenty of other options,
from the French classics to good ol’ ranch-raised, fire-grilled steaks.
Maui’s cooks have even managed to put their own spin on some of the
world’s most revered foods — pizzas, burgers, and burritos — with 
rousing success.
Seafood lovers, rejoice: Maui offers you an astounding array of fresh-
caught fish. In fact, you may find yourself puzzling over lists of unfamil-
iar fish on island menus. (See Chapter 18 for a handy list of definitions
that help you decide what to try.)
Lest all this unfamiliar food talk makes you think otherwise, remember
that the majority of Hawaii islanders are red-blooded, flag-waving
Americans — and they love a good burger just as much as your average
mainlander.
Real local food is generally starchy and high in calories, so the Atkins
crowd will want to skip the traditional plate lunch, which usually con-
sists of a main dish (anything from fried fish to teriyaki beef), “two
scoops rice,” an ice-cream-scoop serving of macaroni salad, and brown
gravy, all served on a paper plate. Plate lunches are cheap and available
at casual restaurants and beachside stands throughout the islands.
Chapter 18 takes a more in-depth look at the diversity of wonderful taste
sensations just waiting to be discovered on Maui.

A Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
Everyone on Maui speaks English, of course. But a number of Hawaiian
words and phrases regularly pop up in everyday conversation.
You probably already know the Hawaiian word aloha (a-lo-ha), which
serves as an all-purpose greeting — hello, welcome, and goodbye. It’s a
warm and wonderful word that expresses the sense of peace and hospi-
tality that epitomizes the islands.
You’ll definitely need to learn the word mahalo (ma-ha-low), which means
“thank you” and is used extensively throughout Hawaii. If you want to say
“Thanks very much!” or “Thank you so much,” say mahalo nui loa (ma-ha-
low noo-ee low-ah). Not only will the locals be impressed with your
efforts to learn, but they’ll be flattered by your graciousness, too.
Islanders don’t like “goodbye” to be so permanent. So to really sound
like a local, part from others warmly with a hui hou (ah hoo-ee ho),
which means “until we meet again.”
Here’s a handy list of other words you may encounter:
 Hale (ha-lay): House
 Haole (how-lee): Foreigner or Caucasian (literally “out of breath” —
pale, or paleface); a common reference, not an insult (usually)
 Hula (hoo-lah): Native dance
 Kamaaina (ka-ma-eye-nah): Local person
 Kapu (ka-poo): Anything that’s taboo, forbidden
 Keiki (keh-kee): Child
 Lanai (lah-nigh): Porch or veranda
 Lei (lay): Garland (usually of flowers, leaves, or shells)
 Luau (loo-ow): A celebratory feast
 Mana (ma-na): Spirit, or power
 Muumuu (moo-oo-moo-oo): A loose-fitting dress, usually in a tropi-
cal print
 Ono (oh-no): Delicious
 Pau (pow): Finished or done
 Pupu (poo-poo): Starter dish, appetizer
The Hawaiian language has only 12 characters to work with — the five
vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) plus seven consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, and w).
Consequently, Hawaiian words and names tend to be long and difficult,
with lots of repetitive syllables.
Part I: Introducing Maui 
28

The vowels are pronounced like this:
a
ah (as in father) or 
o
oh (as in vote)
uh (as in above)
e
eh (as in bed) or ay 
u
oo (as in too)
(as in they)
i
ee (as in police)
Almost all vowels are sounded separately, although some are pro-
nounced together, as in the name of Maui’s county seat, Wailuku, which
is pronounced “Why-loo-koo.”
The simplest way to pronounce a Hawaiian word or name is to approach
long words or names as a collection of short syllables. Accents almost
always fall on the second-to-last syllable. All syllables end with vowels,
so a consonant will always indicate the start of a new syllable.
The Hawaiian language actually has a 13th character: the glottal stop,
which looks exactly like a single opening quotation mark (’) and is meant
to indicate a pause. I’ve chosen not to use the glottal stop throughout
this book; it’s often left out in printed Hawaiian and on such things as
store and street signs. Although serious Hawaiian-language students
insist on using the glottal stop, you don’t need to worry about it as a 
visitor; just ignore it when you see it.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Studying up on Hawaii can be one of the most fun bits of “research”
you’ll ever do. If you’d like to learn a bit more about the islands before
you go — which I encourage — these books and movies are an enjoyable
way to do it.
Books
In addition to Shoal of Time (see the “History 101: The Main Events” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter), one of my all-time favorites is Hawaii, by
James Michener (Random House), the epic Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist
who loved the island’s heart and soul. Michener’s novel charts a similar
course as Daws’ book, but this fictionalized account has the style — and
the can’t-put-it-down appeal — of a beach read. The missionary chapters
are focused on Lahaina, so Hawaii is especially suited to a Maui visit.
Another intriguing work of fiction that tells the story of Hawaii, albeit on
a smaller scale, is Kiana Davenport’s Shark Dialogues (Plume).
Fortunately for us, one of Hawaii’s first tourists was also one of litera-
ture’s greatest and most insightful wits. Mark Twain’s Letters from Hawaii
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Maui 29

(University of Hawaii Press) chronicles Twain’s four months in Hawaii in
1866 while on assignment as a journalist for the Sacramento Union. This
entertaining collection captures truths about Hawaii’s past that no third-
party history could. The letters are also available on audio CD (Audio
Partners Publishing Corporation).
The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai (Scribner)
tells the fascinating, harrowing, and insightful history of Molokai’s
Kalaupapa leper colony. This 2006 title from John Tayman, a former
Outside magazine editor, is so thrillingly written that it reads like a page-
turning novel.
Want to learn the stories of Pele, Maui, and the other gods and super-
natural creatures, both fiery and benevolent, that comprise Hawaii’s
mystical back story? Check out Hawaiian Mythology, by Martha Warren
Beckwith and Katharine Luomala (University of Hawaii Press). Steven
Goldberry’s Maui the Demigod (University of Hawaii Press) is a well-
regarded historic novel focused on the multifaceted character who
slowed the sun in order to dry his mother’s tapa cloth, as legend has it.
Hundreds of books tell the personal stories of the great figures of
Hawaiian history. One of my favorites chronicles the life — and bloody
Big Island death — of the great, devastating seafarer who introduced
Hawaii to the western world: Farther Than Any Man: The Rise and Fall of
Captain James Cook, by Martin Dugard (Simon & Schuster). Only a sliver
of the book is about Hawaii, but it articulates the British colonial mind-
set beautifully.
University of Hawaii Press’s richly illustrated Atlas of Hawaii is a fasci-
nating source for everything you ever wanted to know about Hawaii’s
physical geography, weather patterns, population, and the like. It’s an
ideal gift for natural-science buffs who want to delve deeper.
Albert J. Schutz’s All About Hawaiian (University of Hawaii Press) is a
great pocket-size reference for those who want to know just a bit more
about the Hawaiian alphabet and language, including how to pronounce
all those funky place names.
Want to bask in the glory of Hawaii as innocent vacationland, in the days
of Matson Cruise Lines, Duke Kahanamoku, and Don Ho crooning “Tiny
Bubbles,” when Waikiki really was paradise? Leis, Luaus and Alohas: 
The Lure of Hawaii in the Fifties, by Fred E. Basten and Charles Phoenix
(Island Heritage), is the book for you. This vibrant coffee-table book will
really put you in the mood for a mai tai.
Some beautifully illustrated books tell the story of the aloha shirt in all
its silky, full-color glory. Best of the bunch is The Aloha Shirt: Spirit of the
Islands, by Dale Hope and Gregory Tozian (Beyond Words Publishing).
Broader in its reach — but no less beautiful — is Linda B. Arthur’s Aloha
Attire: Hawaiian Dress in the 20th Century (Schiffer Publishing).
Part I: Introducing Maui

Both craft and horticulture fans will find Ronn Ronck’s A Pocket Guide to
the Hawaiian Lei: A Tradition of Aloha (Mutual Publishing) to be an easy-
to-carry reference to Hawaii’s most visible and popular creative ritual:
lei making and wearing.
If you can manage to find it, no book exudes the genuine spirit of living
in Hawaii like Jocelyn Fujii’s Under the Hula Moon (Crown Publishing
Group), a gorgeous blend of photos and text with an introduction by
Paul Theroux.
Hawaii culture is predicated on the wisdom of its elders, passed down
through the generations. Voices of Wisdom: Hawaiian Elders Speak,
by M. J. Harden (Booklines Hawaii, Ltd.), features interviews with 24
respected island elders, gorgeously illustrated with black-and-white por-
traits by photographer Steve Brinkman. This beautiful and easy-to-read
book is a perfect primer for anyone who wants to embrace Hawaii’s rich
heritage and the cultural renaissance that the islands have experienced
over the last two decades.
Chicken Soup from the Soul of Hawaii, by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor
Hansen, Sharon Linnea, and Robin Stephens Rohr (HCI), really captures
the magic of the island in one slim volume featuring some of the islands’
most beloved stories. This book is a delightful introduction to the spirit
and substance of Hawaii life and culture for those who want to set the
tone but don’t care to dig too deep.
Rita Ariyoshi’s Maui on My Mind (Mutual Publishing) is a gorgeously
written and illustrated coffee-table book focused on the beauty and
magic of the Valley Isle. If you have a reluctant traveler in your group,
this enticing collection of text and photos will change his tune.
In 2004, Honolulu Magazine put together a panel of experts and named
The 50 Greatest Hawai’i Music Albums, by Roana Bolante and Michael
Keany (Watermark). This gorgeous full-color book is a must for music
lovers who want to learn about the best island sounds, from the hip
atomic-age sounds of Martin Denny to the finest songsters of today, such
as the Brothers Cazimero and Keali’i Reichel.
If you have a hard time finding any of these books — or if you want addi-
tional suggestions from Hawaii’s rich library — two Big Island book-
stores serve as particularly good resources: Basically Books (% 800-
903-MAPS [6277] or 808-961-0144; www.basicallybooks.com) and the
Kohala Book Shop (% 808-889-6400; www.kohalabooks.com). Both
offer online catalog browsing and ordering services.
Movies
Gorgeous Hawaii has served as a backdrop for countless TV shows and
movies, from Hawaii Five-O (“book ’em, Dano”) to Pearl Harbor. Here are
just a few of my favorite movies starring the islands, all available on
DVD. Unfortunately, few star Maui, but all the movies listed here will give
you a good feel for the islands.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Maui 31

The epic Academy Award winner From Here to Eternity (1953), starring
Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, and a bevy of other
Hollywood big names, tells the story of the attack on Pearl Harbor with
gravity and intimacy. The location shots are gorgeous, even in black-and-
white.
Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970), is a fascinating, fictional-yet-documentary-style
depiction of the attack on Pearl Harbor from both the U.S. and Japanese
perspectives. It was filmed on location on both Oahu and Japan.
Blue Crush (2002) is a silly surf movie that nevertheless captures the
genuine heart of Oahu’s North Shore surf culture. The stunning photog-
raphy alone is worth putting up with the plot — you’ll feel like you’re
riding the waves yourself. (Note: Although the movie was filmed on
Oahu, its original working title was Surf Girls of Maui.)
50 First Dates (2004), starring Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler, is a
real island gem. This funny and romantic movie was filmed on North
Shore and Windward Oahu and exudes warm island spirit.
Breathtaking Kauai hosts the dinosaur-dotted jungle of Jurassic Park
(1993). Of course, Spielberg didn’t exactly discover Kauai; Hollywood
had discovered the Garden Isle’s silver-screen magic decades before. For
the best retro views, check out Blue Hawaii (1961) starring Elvis and
South Pacific (1958), filmed on the north shore of Kauai, whose stunning
Bali Hai mountains shape the film’s incredible backdrop. And even flying
Elvises can’t upstage the gorgeous scenery when Honeymoon in Vegas
(1992), starring Nicolas Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker, moves to Kauai.
One of my absolute favorite movies about Hawaii is the little-seen Picture
Bride (1994), which tells the story of a young Japanese girl who sails to
Hawaii in 1918 to marry a man — a laborer in the sugar-cane fields —
whom she has never met. This stirring and beautiful movie is well worth
seeking out.
You and the kids may want to check out George of the Jungle (1997), star-
ring Brendan Fraser, which was partially filmed on Maui. Maui is also fea-
tured in Die Another Day (2002), starring Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.
Garry Marshall’s movie version of the Anne Rice novel Exit to Eden
(1994), starring Rosie O’Donnell and Dana Delaney, was filmed largely on
Maui and Lanai, but I’m not sure that’s a worthwhile reason to rent this
unfortunate film.
Molokai: The Story of Father Damien (2000) is true story of Molokai’s
leper colony, now preserved as a national historical park. The star-
studded supporting cast includes Derek Jacobi, Sam Neill, Peter O’Toole,
and Kris Kristofferson.

Deciding When to Go
In This Chapter
 Decoding the secrets of the travel seasons
 Understanding Maui’s climate
 Avoiding the crowds
 Zeroing in on special events
M
aui enjoys fabulous weather year-round. Winter is virtually nonex-
istent. Severe storms are a rarity. Even the off-season — spring
and fall — is gorgeous, meaning you can save a bundle with the right
travel dates.
Still, some times are better than others. This chapter reveals when
everybody else comes to Maui so that you can either join the party or
steer clear and avoid the crowds.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Maui’s high season is during the winter months, from the second half of
December through mid-April, when people flee the cold, snow, and gray
skies of home for Hawaii’s warm sun and bathing-suit temperatures.
During this winter high season, prices go up, and resorts can be booked
to capacity, particularly during the holiday season. Book far in advance
for a trip during this period, and expect to pay sky-high prices. Although
not nearly as bad as Christmastime, Easter week can also be crowded
with West Coast families flocking to the islands for a few days of fun in
the sun over spring break.
Summer (mid-June through Aug) is a secondary high season. You won’t
find the bargains of spring and fall, but you may still do better on accom-
modations, airfare, and packages than in the winter months.
Maui’s slowest seasons have traditionally been spring (mid-Apr to mid-
June) and fall (Labor Day to mid-Dec) — which, paradoxically, also
happen to be the best seasons in Maui in terms of reliably great weather.
Herein lies the secret of the seasons: In late spring and fall, hotel rates
traditionally drop, package deals abound, airfares are often at their
lowest rates of the year, and you can expect consistently clear days after
you arrive.

Truth be told, the weather is relatively constant year-round. You can bet
that no matter what time of year you arrive, you can enjoy prime condi-
tions. Your decision really boils down to how much you want to spend,
how important it is for you to escape winter back home, your willing-
ness to deal with crowds, and what’s available.
Understanding Maui’s climate
Maui lies at the edge of the tropics, so it really has only two seasons:
warm (winter) and warmer (summer). Temperatures generally don’t
vary much more than 15°F or so from season to season, depending on
where you are on the island. The average high is 88°F at the height of
summer, while the average winter high is 80°F at its coldest — not much
difference. Nighttime lows drop about 15 degrees, give or take a couple
of degrees, year-round. August and September are usually the warmest
months; January is generally the coolest. Almost-constant trade winds
bring a cooling breeze in even the hottest weather.
The island’s leeward side (the west and south shores) tends to be hot
and dry; the windward side (the east and north shores) is generally
cooler and wetter. For desertlike weather, visit South Maui or West Maui.
The driest and sunniest areas of Maui are the communities of Kihei and
Wailea, on Maui’s south coast. When you want lush, junglelike condi-
tions, go windward toward Hana on the northeastern shore.
Locals say that if you don’t like the weather, just get in the car and 
drive — you’re bound to find something different. That’s because the
island has many microclimates, which are highly localized weather pat-
terns based on a region’s unique position and topography.
The mountain communities of Upcountry Maui are much cooler than 
the coastal areas, and the higher you go, the cooler it gets. If you visit
Haleakala National Park, for example, you climb from sea level to 10,000
feet in just 37 miles. Don’t be surprised if the temperature is 30 to 35
degrees cooler at the summit than at the beach.
In general, November through March or April (depending on the year)
marks Maui’s rainy season; rainfall averages between 2 and 3 inches
during these months. Summer, when average rainfall generally drops
below 1 inch per month, is considered the dry season. The weather can
get gray during the rainy season — but, fortunately, it seldom rains for
more than two or three days in a row. Winter isn’t a bad time to go to
Maui — the sun’s just a little less reliable, that’s all.
Good news about Maui’s rainy season — it’s almost never raining every-
where, even in winter. So if it’s raining on your parade, just get in the car
and drive — you’ll likely reach a sunny spot in no time.
Charting sea changes
Maui’s ocean waters stay warm year-round. The average water tempera-
ture is a warm 75°F, and reaches a jump-right-in 83°F or so in summer.
Part I: Introducing Maui 
34

Wave action, though, varies greatly between winter and summer, and
from coast to coast. Maui’s beaches tend to be as placid as lakes in the
summer and autumn months. In winter, swells hit the north-facing
beaches and the surf goes wild (attracting daredevil surfers, who are fun
to watch, even if you’re not brave enough to face monster curls your-
self). South-facing beaches generally remain calm and friendly to swim-
mers and snorkelers of all ages and abilities throughout winter, although
spring and early summer bring south swells right about the time North
Shore waves flatten out.
If the waves are too powerful for you, seek calmer conditions by taking a
short drive to another beach that’s more sheltered. In Chapter 12, I rec-
ommend the best local beaches, including the safest for inexperienced
swimmers. When in doubt, ask at your hotel or call the local tourist
office for recommendations — and watch for warning flags and posted
conditions at the beach.
A few important words about ocean safety: Never turn your back on the
ocean when you’re at the beach. A big wave can come out of nowhere
before you can say “aloha.” Always watch the surf, even if you’re just
taking a casual stroll along the shoreline. Also, ocean conditions can
change dramatically in a matter of hours; surf that was safe for swim-
ming one day can develop a dangerous undertow the next. Get out of the
water when the big swells come. And red flags hoisted on the beach are
your warning that unsafe conditions are present. And last, don’t be shy
about wearing floaties or a life jacket if it makes you feel more comfort-
able in the water.
Avoiding the crowds
Yes, coming to Maui during certain times is a bad idea if you’re allergic
to crowds. At the very least, you should know what you’re getting into.
The entire nation of Japan basically shuts down over Golden Week,
which falls annually in late April or early May. (Oahu is more crowded,
but Maui fills up, too.) Book hotels, interisland air reservations, and car
rentals well in advance.
Halloween in Lahaina is a major event; up to 20,000 people come for the
festivities. Booking your Lahaina hotel room a year or more in advance
isn’t too early. You shouldn’t have a problem elsewhere on the island,
though.
And keep in mind that the islands are at maximum capacity during the
Christmas holidays; spring break and Easter week can also be crowded.

In addition to the following listings, I encourage you to check the active
events calendar at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center in Kahului, where
events run the gamut from art exhibits, local entertainers, and film
screenings to international entertainers, such as David Sedaris and the
Who. Go online at www.mauiarts.org, where you can also buy tickets,
or call the box office at % 808-242-7469.
January
’Tis the season for world-championship golf in paradise. The season
kicks off with the first PGA event of the year, the Mercedes Champion-
ships at Kapalua Resort (% 877-527-2582; www.kapalua.com/hawaii-
golf/pga-tournament), starring the previous year’s tournament
champs. Next up is the Wendy’s Champions Skins Game at Kaanapali 
or Wailea, Maui, depending on the year and the deal struck. Expect top-
ranked talent at both events. Check www.pgatour.com for complete
details on each event, including how to purchase tickets. January and
February.
January through April is Maui’s prime whale-watching season, when
humpback whales — the world’s largest mammals — make their way
from frigid Alaska to the balmy waters of Hawaii. Maui is the best spot in
Hawaii for whale-watching because the giants love to frolic in the channel
separating the Valley Isle from Molokai and Lanai. Because whales prefer
water depths of less than 600 feet, these endangered gentle giants come
in relatively close to shore. You can see them regularly from the beach in
prime season, spouting and spy-hopping (peeking above the waterline to
“spy” on what’s going on). They often prefer the west, or leeward, sides
of the islands. The best onshore vantage is West Maui’s MacGregor 
Point, a large pullout on the ocean side of Highway 30, halfway between
Maalaea and Lanai. The nonprofit Pacific Whale Foundation operates a
Whale Information Station there that’s staffed by friendly naturalists
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. from December through April. Just stop
by — they even have high-powered binoculars you can use — or call 
% 800-942-5311 or 808-249-8811 for more details. If you happen to be in
the islands during whale season, you don’t want to miss seeing these
remarkable behemoths. You can often spot them from land, but I also rec-
ommend the best whale-watching cruises in Chapter 12.

Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 41

Maximizing Your Time
As you plan your itinerary, keep the following tips in mind:
 Fly directly from the mainland to Maui. Doing so can save you a
two-hour layover in Honolulu and another plane ride on an inter-
island carrier — a process that can add four or five hours to your
total travel time. Multiple direct flights from the mainland serve
Maui. Mainland flights to the neighboring islands may be more
expensive, although they tend to be comparably priced these days;
still, be sure to price-compare if money matters.
 Spend a week or ten days vacationing on Maui. A week or ten days
allow you to explore the island at your leisure while still enjoying
plenty of time just lazing on the beach. I wouldn’t advise anything
shorter than a week for folks traveling from farther away than
California. If you want to hop to one or two other Hawaiian islands as
well, you really need a full two-week vacation to make it enjoyable.
 Don’t overplan your itinerary or try to do everything. If relax-
ation is number one on your agenda, work plenty of do-nothing
time into your travel plans. Keep your days loose. A Maui vacation
is about going with the island flow — and a big part of the experi-
ence is just taking things as they come. Don’t feel guilty that you’re
not doing or seeing enough; you do enough the other 50 weeks of
the year, don’t you?
 Leave at least one day to chance. Don’t book a big activity for
every day of your vacation. Leave at least one day for whatever
strikes your fancy, whether it’s sightseeing or shopping or just sit-
ting on your condo’s oceanfront lanai, soaking up a beach read and
the laid-back vibe. Make the most of this carefree week in your life.
 Make mornings your ocean time, if you’re dividing your day
between land and sea activities. Beaches tend to be less crowded
and the surf and winds tend to be calmer in the morning hours —
especially in winter. Always take the first snorkel and dive cruise of
the day, when conditions are calmest and clearest; you’ll under-
stand why outfitters offer discounts on their afternoon sails should
you choose to wait until later in the day.
 Keep an eye on the weather and plan accordingly. Don’t be a
slave to your schedule — watch the local weather reports and keep
your plans flexible enough to make the most of great weather.
 Book extra-special activities before you leave home so that you
don’t miss out. Many of Maui’s best activities can book up weeks in
advance. Do some plan-ahead reading and call to reserve a few
select adventures — such as the best luau or a snorkel trip to Lanai
you just don’t want to miss — before you leave home. After all, you
don’t get to Maui just every day, and I don’t want you to miss out
on the best it has to offer. (For tips on those activities you may
want to book before you arrive, see Chapter 8.)

Chapter 4
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Thinking about your major expenses
 Zeroing in on cost-cutting tips
 Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
“S
o, how much is this trip going to cost me, anyway?”
It’s a reasonable question, regardless of your income. Vacation can be
expensive — and, as destinations go, Maui is a relatively pricey one.
Planning ahead keeps your budget on track. In this chapter, I tell you
what to expect and offer tips that can save big bucks on major expenses.
Planning Your Budget
The good news is that you can easily structure a Maui trip to suit any
budget. Airfare and hotels probably end up being your largest cash out-
lays. Other items, such as rental cars, are relatively affordable, although
rentals tend to be pricier on Maui than they are on some of the other
Hawaiian Islands.
Activities also affect the budget: Relaxing on the beach or taking in
Maui’s natural beauty generally doesn’t cost a dime. But guided tours
and organized activities, such as snorkel trips and helicopter rides,
luaus and dinner cruises, can carry surprisingly heavy price tags.
Transportation
The cost of your flight to Maui will be one of your top two expenses (the
other being your hotel). The key is to plan ahead and do your research
before booking transpacific and interisland flights. (For details on flying
to Maui and getting the best airfare, see Chapter 5.)
Transpacific flights
Airfares at any time of year are almost impossible to predict and can
change at the drop of a hat, especially as oil prices continue to rise. 
Still, here’s a rough idea of what to expect: If you’re going to Maui in the

off-season — say, May or maybe October — you may be able to snag a
round-trip ticket for as little as $500 from San Francisco or Los Angeles,
or $700 from the East Coast. If you’re traveling in the high season (late
Dec to Apr, or in summer), you’ll pay more — probably in the $600 to
$900 range from the West Coast and $800 to $1,400 from back East. Your
best bet is to shop carefully at any time of year.
Expect to pay more if you’re departing from a city without a major air-
line hub. If you’re traveling over the holidays, expect to pay full fare.
You can score any number of money-saving deals, especially if you 
consider an all-inclusive package. (See Chapter 5 for more details on
travel packages. I tell you more about how to save on airfares in that
chapter, too.)
Interisland flights
If you plan to visit more than one island during your stay, you will likely
need to take an interisland flight. Fares for one-way trips between the
islands, which are operated by Hawaiian Airlines and recent market
entry go! Airlines, average about $160 in the high season. However, you
often don’t need to pay full fare. Numerous sales and special Internet-
only fares are frequently available; one-way fares were available for
around $109 at press time, with sale fares as low as $53 per flight in the
off season. (See Chapter 5 for details.)
Ferry service is also available from Maui’s Lahaina Harbor to its sister
islands of Molokai and Lanai. Fares to Molokai are generally $40 per
adult, with fares to Lanai only about $25 at press time. However, with the
current airfare wars going on, it’s worth price-comparing with the air-
lines before you book. (See Chapter 5 for details.)
Car rentals
Rental cars are fairly affordable on Maui, especially if you avoid the holi-
day season. Weekly rates almost always save you a bundle. You can
often get a compact for as little as $35 to $45 a day, less if you book a
weekly rental. If you need a family-size car, expect to pay more like $45
to $65 per day. Of course, everybody wants a convertible in the islands,
so expect to pay upwards of $75 a day in season for one, although
weekly rentals can sometimes be scored for about $400. You can some-
times wheel and deal for one at the rental counter in the off season,
when business is slower. (For more information, see Chapter 8.)
Do yourself a favor and book a rental car with unlimited mileage. You’ll
appreciate the freedom, and you don’t want to end up paying for your
rental on a per-mile basis. Trust me, you’ll end up with the short end of
this stick. Most of the major car-rental companies rent on an unlimited-
miles basis — just be sure to confirm this policy when you book.
And because you’ll probably cover a good deal of ground, don’t forget to
factor in gas, which is typically more expensive on Maui than it is on the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
46

mainland. Despite rising gas costs, the gap between mainland and
Hawaii prices has closed; at press time, island gas was only about 40¢
more per gallon. However, gas has been known to be as high as a dollar
more per gallon in Hawaii than it costs on the mainland.
Also remember to account for any additional insurance costs, which
generally run an extra $15 to $21 a day, depending on the coverage you
select. Parking, thankfully, is generally free (except at some luxury
resorts, so be sure to check for daily parking fees when you book).
You seldom save by waiting to rent your car; generally, prices only go up
as your pickup date approaches — especially in the busy travel seasons.
Book as far in advance as possible for the best rate. Also see the section
“Cutting Costs, But Not the Fun,” later in this chapter, for additional
money-saving tips.
You may not have to worry about shopping around or wrangling a lower
rate on a car rental. Often, rental cars and interisland flights are part of a
package deal. In many hotel and airline packages, they’re thrown in for a
nominal fee or for free. (See Chapter 5 for more details.)
Lodging
Maui has a wealth of luxury hotels and resorts, but it also offers plenty
of affordable choices — especially in the condo market. Still, although
you can find decent hotel rooms or budget condo rentals for $125 or so
a night, you really shouldn’t expect to pay much less than that. After you
start adding on amenities, such as kitchenettes, room service, ocean
views, and so on, you can expect room rates to climb.
You can score reasonable rates on a per-person basis if you’re traveling
in a group or with your family. Maui boasts plenty of apartment-style
condos that sleep four or more at moderate prices — between $125 and
$225 per night on the lower end, and $250 or more for quite luxurious
digs. Of course, if you stay at a condo, you likely miss out on resort-style
amenities and services, such as a concierge, room service, kids’ pro-
grams, and the like. But it may be worth it to you if you want to have
more room to spread out, enjoy the convenience of having a kitchen,
and keep costs down, because dining is quite expensive on Maui —
especially when you start feeding a family. (For more on rates, including
details on how to get the best rate, see Chapter 6.)
I’ve taken care to recommend a range of lodging choices on Maui, so
you’ll have plenty to choose from, no matter what your needs or budget.
And remember: Although I’ve listed standard rack rates for every hotel,
these tend to be the maximum. You’ll rarely have to pay full price; you
can find numerous ways to save. (For one thing, booking a package deal
can be a huge money saver when it comes to hotels; for more informa-
tion on packages, see Chapter 5.) For additional cost-cutting measures,
see “Cutting Costs, But Not the Fun,” later in this chapter.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47

So that you don’t encounter any unwanted surprises at payment time,
be sure to account for the 11.42 percent tax that will be added to your
final hotel bill when planning your budget.
Dining: How to save, when to splurge
Maui has become quite a culinary mecca in the last few years, boasting
an increasing number of top-quality restaurants, often charging top-
dollar prices. So think about your bottom line. Many people look for-
ward to sampling the island’s finest restaurants and don’t mind paying
for the privilege. But if you want to spend your vacation dollars on other
activities, Maui offers opportunities to dine on the cheap: If you choose
carefully, you can spend as little as $5 to $10 for breakfast (a continental
breakfast may even be included in your hotel deal), grab a quick-and-
easy lunch for $10 to $15, and enjoy a casual dinner for $15 to $30. Still,
thanks to the high cost of transpacific transport, island real estate and
labor, you’re likely to pay more even for casual food here than you do at
home. Of course, extra niceties, such as wine or cocktails, will drive up
dinner costs quickly.
Restaurant bills can add up fast, so if you want to save in this category, I
strongly suggest booking a room or condo with kitchen facilities. By
preparing a few daytime meals yourself (breakfast, in particular, can be a
big money saver, and it’s often convenient to make sandwiches to take
to the beach), you’re in a better position to splurge on a great dinner.
Kitchen facilities are a virtual must if you’re traveling with kids.
Sightseeing and activities: See 
it all without going broke
With sightseeing and other activities, the bills can really start to pile up,
especially for families. Ultimately, though, it depends on what you want
to do. If you’re coming to Maui to simply kick back at the beach and
leave your mainland worries behind, you don’t have to budget much in
this category; going to the beach is free, and even snorkel gear rentals
are cheap. (See Chapter 12 for more information.)
But if you’re planning to schedule some organized activities and tours —
which I strongly suggest you do, especially if it’s your first visit to 
Hawaii — budget ahead because they can get pricey. Expect to pay $70
to $95 per person for your average snorkel cruise, and even more for
your average luau. Helicopter rides can easily run more than $175 a
head. Budget-minded golfers may want to think twice before they tee up,
because tee times at Maui’s top courses don’t come cheap. Greens fees
commonly run close to $200. However, wallet watchers can often take
advantage of twilight rates, which generally hover around $100.
This book lists prices for activities, entertainment, tee times, admission
fees, and the like so that you can budget your money realistically. If you
can snag a bargain, I include that information, too.

Shopping and nightlife
These two areas are the most flexible parts of your budget. Shopping, in
particular, is a huge temptation in Maui. But if money is an issue, do
yourself a favor and bypass the souvenirs.
Maui is one of the liveliest islands in terms of after-dark diversions, but
the islands aren’t overloaded with nightlife options. You can easily avoid
racking up the bills in these categories if shopping and/or evening enter-
tainment isn’t a high priority for you.

Cutting Costs, But Not the Fun
I don’t care how much money you have — I know you don’t want to
spend more than necessary. In this section, I give you tips that can help
you save your hard-earned money.
Getting the best airfares
Landing the best airfare is so huge that I dedicate the better part of a
chapter to it. Before you even start scanning for fares, see Chapter 5,
which also discusses how to find money-saving package deals.
How to avoid paying full price for your hotel room
There’s often a huge gap between hotels’ official “published” (full-price,
or rack) rates and what you actually pay, so don’t be scared off at first
glance. What’s more, savvy travelers can further widen the margin.
More often than not, the best way to score a cheap hotel room is to buy
an all-inclusive travel package that includes airfare, hotel, and car, and
sometimes other extras, in one low price. (For details on scoring a good-
value package, see Chapter 5.)
The second-best way to avoid paying the full rack rate when booking
your hotel is stunningly simple: Just ask the reservation agent for a
cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised — I’ve
been, many times. But you have to take the initiative and ask because 
no one is going to volunteer to save you money.
Here are a few more potential money-saving tips:
 Rates are generally lowest in spring and fall. The time of year you
visit may affect your bargaining power more than anything else.
During the peak seasons — basically mid-December through mid-
April and summer — when a hotel is booked up, management 
is less likely to offer discounts or package deals. In the slower 
seasons — generally mid-April through mid-June and September
through mid-December — when capacity is down, they’re often
willing to negotiate. In fact, many places drop rates by 10 percent
to 30 percent automatically in the less busy times of year. (If you
haven’t decided when you want to visit Maui yet, see Chapter 3.)
 Membership in AAA, AARP, or frequent-flier/traveler programs
often qualifies you for discounted rates. You may also qualify for
corporate or student discounts. Attention, seniors: You may qualify
for discounts even if you’re not an AARP member (although I highly
recommend joining; see Chapter 7 for details). Members of the mili-
tary or trade unions or those with government jobs may also qual-
ify for price breaks. Be sure to mention membership in these
organizations and in any corporate rewards programs you can
think of — or your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an hon-
orary inductee, for that matter — when you call to book. Even
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
50

Costco membership has been known to pay off. You never know
when an affiliation may be worth a few dollars off your room rate.
 Inquire about the hotel’s own package deals. Even if you’re not
traveling on an all-inclusive package (see Chapter 5), you may be
able to take advantage of value-added packages offered directly by
hotels, resorts, and condos, which includes such extras as free
rental car, champagne and in-room breakfast for honeymooners,
free dinners, discounted tee times or spa treatments, room
upgrades, an extra night free (sometimes the fifth, sometimes the
seventh), or some other freebie. I note what kinds of discounts are
typically available in my hotel reviews. Properties often list these
deals on their Web sites, but not always, so it never hurts to ask.
 If you’re booking a hotel that belongs to a chain, call the hotel
directly in addition to going through central reservations. See
which one gives you the better deal. Sometimes the local reserva-
tionists know about packages or special rates, but the hotel may
neglect to tell the central booking line.
 Surf the Web to save. A surprising number of hotels advertise
great packages via their Web sites, and some even offer Internet-
only special rates.
In addition to surfing the hotel’s own sites, you may want to try
using general travel booking sites, such as Expedia (www.expedia.
com), Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Hotels.com (www.
hotels.com), Kayak.com (www.kayak.com), or Orbitz.com (www.
orbitz.com) to book your hotel, or a pay-one-price package that
also includes airfare. Acting much like airline consolidators, these
sites can sometimes offer big discounts on rooms as well. However,
always price-compare against the hotel’s own Web site; these days,
virtually every major hotel chain offers price parity with the online
distributors through their own Web sites. Often, you’ll save a few
bucks through the hotel’s own site and/or end up with a better room
for the same money, because the hotel doesn’t have to pay high dis-
tribution fees if you book direct. (See Chapter 6 for a more complete
discussion of how to use the Web to find a great hotel bargain.)
 Ask innkeepers for a break. B&Bs are generally nonnegotiable on
price. Sometimes, however, you can negotiate a discount for longer
stays, such as a week or more. You may also score a price break if
you’re visiting off-season. And some do offer AAA and senior dis-
counts. Remember: It never hurts to ask, politely.
 Look for price breaks and value-added extras when booking
condos. Condos can sometimes be pretty flexible on rates. They
tend to offer discounts on multinight stays, and many throw in a
free rental car to sweeten the deal. Some condo properties have
units handled by multiple management companies; if that’s the
case, inquire through both companies and see where you get the
better deal. You may also want to check with Hawaii Condo
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 51

Exchange (% 800-442-0404 or 323-436-0300; www.hawaiicondo
exchange.com), which acts as a consolidator for condo properties
throughout the islands.
 Reserve a hotel room with a kitchenette or a condo with a full
kitchen and do your own cooking. You may miss the pampering
that room service provides, but you can save plenty of money
because restaurant prices are high on Maui, even for casual eats.
Even if you prepare only breakfast and an occasional picnic lunch
in the kitchen, you still save significantly in the long run. (I’ve had
some memorable island meals by simply buying fabulous fresh fish
in the local supermarket and throwing it on the barbecue grill at an
oceanfront condo.) Plus, if the beach is right outside your door, you
don’t ever have to leave it to go on restaurant runs.
 Skip the ocean views, or stay away from the ocean altogether.
Being steps away from the surf is wonderful, but you pay through
the nose for the privilege: Oceanview rooms are the most expen-
sive rooms in any hotel, especially those on the upper floors.
Mountain or garden views are usually much cheaper, and you prob-
ably don’t plan on hanging out in your room much anyway. A stay
in a hotel that is located slightly inland from the beach can be even
cheaper. (For more on this subject, see Chapter 6.)
 Ask whether the kids can stay in your room. Or, better yet, book a
condo with a sleeper sofa in the living room or a separate bedroom.
A room with two double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than
one with a king-size bed, and most hotels don’t charge an extra-
person rate if the additional person is a child.
If that’s a bit too much togetherness for you, book one of the many
one-, two-, or three-bedroom condos that are available on Maui.
These full apartments are often no more expensive than your stan-
dard hotel room, and they’re always cheaper than having to book
two or more hotel rooms. Furthermore, they solve the expensive
eating-out-at-every-meal problem, too.
 And remember, you don’t need much luxury to make Maui feel
like paradise. To find true Hawaii happiness, the rule is always
this: the simpler, the better. You won’t need a 27-inch TV, 24-hour
butler service, or a telephone in the bathroom to be happy. So
when reserving your accommodations, don’t overdo it by booking
a place that taxes your budget too much. Save that extra dough for
having fun!
Tips for cutting other costs
Here are a few more useful tips to help you enjoy your Maui vacation
without breaking the bank:
 Consult a reliable travel agent. A travel agent can sometimes
negotiate a better price with certain hotels and assemble a better
valued complete travel package than you can get on your own. In
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
52

fact, in a recent Condé Nast Traveler investigation, travel agents
could always price out Hawaii resort vacations more cheaply than
any other outlet (including airline packagers). Even if you book
your own airfare, you may want to contact a travel agent to price
out your hotel.
On the other hand, hotels, condos, and even B&Bs are sometimes
willing to discount your rate as much as 30 percent — the amount
they’d otherwise pay an agent in commissions — if you book
direct.
 Surf the Web to save on your rental car. In addition to surfing
rental-car agencies’ own sites, try comparing rates through general
travel booking sites, such as Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Kayak.
com, or Priceline. This one-stop-shopping method can save you
more than money — it can save you time, too. However, always
price-compare against the car company’s own site, because most
companies are now combating online booking agencies with on-par
(or lower) pricing. (See Chapter 8 for more money-saving tips to
keep in mind while booking your island wheels.)
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot (an especially important point, because gas
prices are always higher in Hawaii than on the mainland). Unless
you’re traveling with a large group, don’t go beyond the economy
size.
 Skip the souvenirs. I’ve heard it more than once: “That whale print
that looked so right in the art gallery was all wrong back in my
living room in Cincinnati.” Spend your money on memories, not
tchotchkes.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do, and you may
let your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash while away from home is from 
an ATM. The MasterCard, Maestro, or Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.
mastercard.com) networks and Visa PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.
visa.com) network span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to
see which network you’re on and then call or check online for ATM loca-
tions at your destination. Be sure you know your personal identification
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 53

number (PIN) before you leave home and don’t forget to find out your
daily withdrawal limit before you depart.
Also, keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time your card is
used at a different bank’s ATM. On top of this fee, the bank from which
you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. (To compare banks’ ATM
fees within the United States, use www.bankrate.com.) To beat these
fees (and to avoid wasting precious vacation time running errands), it
makes sense to withdraw larger sums instead of relying on lots of
smaller withdrawals.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and for foreign visitors, they generally
offer relatively good exchange rates.
You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit cards at banks or
ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten yours, or didn’t
even know you had one, call the number on the back of your credit card
and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five to seven business
days, though some banks will provide the number over the phone if you
tell them your mother’s maiden name or some other personal informa-
tion. But keep in mind that cash advances are a bad idea, only to be
used in case of emergency. Your issuing bank will start charging interest
from the day you make the withdrawal, usually at significantly higher
rates than you’re charged on regular purchases.
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip so that they don’t become suspicious when the card is
used numerous times in a new destination and block your charges. Even
if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you can always
call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is refused — 
a good reason to carry the phone number with you.
Carrying more than one card with you on your trip is a good idea; a card
may not work for any number of reasons, so having a backup is the
smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, it’s so easy to find a 24-hour ATM that traveler’s checks are
becoming obsolete. Furthermore, the popularity of credit cards means
that businesses are less and less interested in accepting them. Still, if
you like the security of traveler’s checks, and you don’t mind locating a
bank and/or showing identification every time you want to cash one,
you may prefer to stick with the tried-and-true.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
54

You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent
(which negates any money you may have saved by avoiding ATM fees
while you’re on the road). You can also get American Express Travelers
Cheques over the phone by calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and
platinum cardholders who use this number are exempt from the fee.
Travelers Cheques can also be ordered online at www.american
express.com.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can pick
up Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-
339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920
for a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks — safely, with a relative or
friend back home. If the checks are stolen or lost, you’ll get a refund
faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover that your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the
nearest police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may
require a police report number or record of the loss. Most credit card
companies have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost
or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following
emergency numbers in the United States:
 American Express: % 800-268-9824 or 800-528-4800 (for card-
holders) and % 800-221-7282 (for Travelers Cheque holders)
 MasterCard: % 800-307-7309 or 800-627-8372
 Visa: % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-555-
1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft or fraud is a potential complication of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 55

credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-685-1111; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com).
Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your airline and explain
the situation. You may be allowed to board the plane if you have a copy
of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police report
you’ve filed.

 Stretching your accommodations dollars
G
etting to Maui may not really be half the fun, but it’s a necessary
step — and a big part of the planning process. How can you beat
the high cost of transpacific airfares? Should you reserve a package deal
or book the elements of your vacation separately?
In this chapter, I give you the information to make the decisions that are
right for you.
Flying to Maui
These days, nearly as many transpacific flights arrive at Maui’s Kahului
Airport as arrive at Oahu’s Honolulu International Airport.
The following major airlines fly between mainland North America and
one or more of Hawaii’s major airports, including Maui’s Kahului Airport:
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.com).
 Alaska Airlines (% 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com).
 American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com).
 Continental Airlines (% 800-523-3273; www.continental.com),
which offers nonstop flights from Newark to Honolulu, among many
other options; all flights to Maui connect with an interisland flight
at Honolulu’s airport.
 Delta Airlines (% 800-221-1212; www.delta.com).
 Hawaiian Airlines (% 800-367-5320; www.hawaiianair.com),
which offers interisland flights in addition to transpacific service
from the mainland and international destinations.
 Northwest Airlines (% 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com).
 United Airlines (% 800-864-8331; www.united.com).

 US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com).
 WestJet (% 888-937-8538; www.westjet.com), which offers direct
flights to Maui from Vancouver, Canada.
These days, an increasing number of airlines are charging all travelers
except their elite customers $15 to $25 per bag to check luggage.
Therefore, I recommend checking with your airline to understand its
checked-baggage policy so you can prepare accordingly and avoid any
unwanted surprises when you arrive at the airport.
No matter where you’re coming from, it’s bound to be a long haul to
Maui. So help yourself choose the best seat available to you with
SeatGuru (www.seatguru.com), which features cabin diagrams for just
about every carrier, with individual seat ratings, details on ergonomics,
entertainment options, power outlet accessibility, and more.
Getting the best airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product, yet prices can
vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need to purchase their tickets at the last minute,
change their itinerary at a moment’s notice, or get home before the
weekend pay the premium rate, known as the full fare. Passengers 
whose travel agenda is more flexible — who can book their tickets far in
advance; who don’t mind staying over Saturday night; or who are willing
to travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday — pay the least, usually
a fraction of the full fare. On most flights to Hawaii, even the shortest
hops, the full fare is more than $1,000, but an advance-purchase ticket
from the West Coast can sometimes be had for as low as $400. Obviously,
I can’t guarantee what the fares will be when you book — especially as
oil prices continue to reach record highs and competition has tightened
after two transpacific carriers (Aloha Airlines and ATA) folded their
wings for good in early 2008 — but you can almost always save big by
planning ahead.
Keep an eye out for newspaper, Internet, and TV airfare sales. Sale fares
carry advance-purchase requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but
the price is usually worth the restrictions. The sales tend to take place
in seasons of low travel volume (usually spring and fall). You’ll almost
never see a sale around the peak summer vacation months or in the
winter high season.
Here are a few tips that can help you save on airfares:
 Travel on off days of the week. Airfares vary depending on the 
day of the week. Everybody wants to travel on the weekend. If you
can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, you may find
cheaper flights to Maui. When you inquire about airfares, check to
see whether you can get a cheaper rate by flying on a different day.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
58

Remember, too, that staying over on a Saturday night can lower
your airfare.
 Reserve your flight well in advance. Take advantage of advance-
purchase fares. Sometimes you can snag a last-minute bargain, but I
wouldn’t count on it. Airfares only get higher as the planes fill up.
More often than not, the farther ahead you book, the lower your
airfare is likely to be.
 Fly direct to Maui to save on interisland airfares. Although it all
depends on the transpacific carrier you choose and your origina-
tion point, it’s increasingly easy to fly across the Pacific directly to
Maui. Maui is served by direct flights from the mainland, usually for
comparable prices to flying to Honolulu. (See the list of carriers in
the preceding section.) Compare the cost of flying to Honolulu plus
an interisland fare with the cost of flying directly to Maui. Flying
direct also saves you a few hours on each end, and time can be a
more valuable commodity than money when your vacation time is
limited.
 Book online. In an effort to encourage you to book on their Web
sites, most of the major air carriers will charge you a fee — any-
where from $5 to $20 per ticket — to buy your tickets over the
phone or in person at ticket offices. Therefore, booking your ticket
online at the airline’s Web site is usually going to be the cheapest
way to buy direct.
Booking your flight online
The big one-stop online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com), and Yahoo! Travel (http://travel.
yahoo.com) — are excellent sources for one-stop price comparing
across all the major airlines. (Canadian travelers should try www.
expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents can go for www.
expedia.co.uk, www.travelocity.co.uk, and www.opodo.co.uk.)
Each has different business deals with the airlines and may offer differ-
ent fares on the same flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and
Travelocity will also send you e-mail notifications when a cheap fare
becomes available to your favorite destination. All these online travel
agencies also purport to save you money with pay-one-price packaging,
but I suggest comparing the prices of each piece before you assume that
you’re saving.
Kayak.com (www.kayak.com) is also gaining popularity; it uses a sophis-
ticated search engine, developed at MIT, to search the widest breadth of
online resources available to find the best available fare. Kayak.com is a
search engine, not an online travel agency, so after you identify the best
fare, it links you directly to the source to book it. It also has a Fare Alert
tool that will allow you to track fare prices through an e-mail notification
system. SideStep (www.sidestep.com) works in a similar fashion and
gets good reviews from users.
Chapter 5: Getting to Maui 59

Newest on the scene is Farecast (www.farecast.com), an online travel
agency designed to help you buy your tickets with confidence, knowing
that you’re getting the best deal available. Farecast’s airfare prediction
tool tracks whether fares are rising or dropping; based on these predic-
tions, the site will let you know whether to buy now or wait. It also com-
pares its prices to those available on such sites as Expedia and Hotwire.
With these valuable features, it’s no wonder that Time magazine has
named Farecast one of its “50 Coolest Sites.”
Attention, spontaneous travelers: Great last-minute deals are sometimes
available through Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), which
compiles a comprehensive list of bargain-basement fares available from
the airlines and the online agencies looking to fill those final empty
seats.
Of course, some of the best fares are available through Priceline (www.
priceline.com) especially if you’re willing to play its “Name Your Own
Price” game in which you “bid” for a rock-bottom price — and it’s yours
if an airline accepts it. You won’t know who the carrier is until after you
buy, and you may have an out-of-the-way connection (or two). However,
the mystery airlines are all major, well-known carriers, and the possibil-
ity of being sent from Phoenix to Honolulu via Tampa is remote. Still, the
inconveniences can be minimal compared to the savings. Priceline now
offers standard online airfare shopping services as well.
Although third-party sites, such as Expedia and Travelocity, sometimes
offer the best airfares, never assume. Also remember to check the air-
lines’ own Web sites. These days, many major carriers are offering 
similar — or even cheaper — airfares through their own Web sites in
order to avoid paying costly commissions to the online agencies. Even if
you find a good fare from one of the services listed in this section, you
can often shave off a few bucks by booking directly through the airline.
Many airlines have special Internet-only fares that their phone agents
don’t even know about.
Attention Upromise members: If you use this online rewards service to
save for your kids’ college education (or to pay your own bills), you can
earn cash back (usually 1 percent to 2 percent of the purchase price) by
booking airfares and other travel reservations via Expedia, Travelocity,
and a wealth of other travel partners when accessed through the
Upromise portal (www.upromise.com). If you’re not a member but
there’s someone in your life paying for college, visit the site to sign up.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, can be a good place to find
low fares, sometimes below even the airlines’ discounted rates.
Basically, these companies are just big travel agencies that get discounts
for buying in bulk and pass some of the savings on to you. These days,
however, it’s a rare day to get a fare through a consolidator that you
can’t get through mainstream sources, such as Expedia — or even the
airlines themselves — so be sure to compare prices. Bucket-shop tickets
are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancellation penalties, and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
60

some put you on charter airlines you’ve never heard of; be sure you
know all the ins and outs before you buy.
Some of the most reliable consolidators include the following:
 AirSaver (% 800-325-2175; www.airsaver.com): AirSaver is an
online consolidator that sometimes offers very good deals on
transpacific round-trips.
 Cheap Tickets (% 800-504-3249; www.cheaptickets.com): I usu-
ally do better by calling than I do by pricing out fares on its Web
site.
 STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com): STA Travel is
the world’s leader in student travel, but it offers good fares for trav-
elers of all ages.
Flying between the Hawaiian Islands
With the exception of limited ferry service between Maui and the islands
of Molokai and Lanai (see the following section), the only real way to
travel from island to island today is by airplane.
An interisland high-speed catamaran ferry service called Hawaii
Superferry (% 877-443-3779; www.hawaiisuperferry.com) was intro-
duced between Maui and Oahu in 2007. In theory, the service is a great
idea, allowing locals and visitors alike to ferry between the islands with
their cars and luggage. However, service has been intermittent at best
since launching, and it was temporarily suspended as of this writing.
Even when it resumes, only one ferry a day is slated each way between
Oahu and Maui. For now, until service can get on a steady track, I recom-
mend sticking with the airlines.
Despite the fact that it’s a short and easy shuttle hop between islands —
even the longest island-to-island flight clocks in around 45 minutes —
booking in advance is vital. The airlines request that you show up at
least 90 minutes before your flight to allow for security inspections, and
I’ve found that to be good advice.
Three interisland carriers serve the islands: Hawaiian Airlines and go!,
the upstart carrier operated by Mesa Airlines, carry the bulk of travelers
between the islands, while Island Air offers supplemental service, usu-
ally between Hawaii’s smaller airports. (Aloha Airlines filed for bank-
ruptcy and halted all service in early 2008, citing skyrocketing fuel and
predatory pricing by go! as the pressures that forced its hand.) Both
Hawaiian and go! offer similar schedules — flights between the major
islands every hour or so — at competitive prices.
Hawaiian Airlines (% 800-367-5320; www.hawaiianair.com) offers
interisland jet service aboard Boeing 717-200s; the entire fleet was
Chapter 5: Getting to Maui 61

replaced with brand-new aircraft in 2001, making this the youngest fleet
in the Pacific.
Hawaiian is mileage partners with American Airlines, US Airways,
Continental, Delta, Northwest, and Virgin Atlantic airlines, which gives
you plenty of mileage earning potential. They don’t make it easy to enter
another airline’s frequent flier number online, however, so you may need
to call to get the appropriate credit.
An upstart airline called go! (% 888-IFLYGO2 [888-435-9462]; www.
iflygo.com), a subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, entered the market for
interisland flights in June 2006 and has caused quite a ruckus since.
They have fueled an ongoing price war by offering flights for as little as
$49 per segment, forcing Hawaiian to also offer competitive sale fares in
the face of increased competition. At the end of the day, we consumers
are benefiting from fares that are staying low (for now, anyway) even as
oil prices rise.
Island Air (% 800-652-6541 or 808-484-2222; www.islandair.com)
operates deHavilland DASH-8 and DASH-6 aircraft and serves Hawaii’s
smaller interisland airports on Maui (Kapalua Airport), Molokai, and
Lanai, as well as both Hilo and Kona on the Big Island. You may find
yourself on a code-share flight operated by Island Air if you head to
Molokai or Lanai, even if you buy through Hawaiian.
At press time, the full interisland fare was about $109 per one-way seg-
ment, depending on the dates and routes you want to fly. (At this writ-
ing, experts were forecasting price increases in the wake of lightened
competition resulting from Aloha’s disappearance, so don’t be surprised
if you see higher fares.) Booking more than 14 days in advance gives you
the best shot at a bargain fare. I recommend comparing prices for the
best deal.
If you’re traveling on a package, you probably don’t have to worry about
any of this — your interisland flights are most likely included in your
package deal, on whichever interisland carrier the packager is affiliated
with. (For more on all-inclusive travel packages, see “Choosing a Pay-
One-Price Package,” later in this chapter.)
Ferrying between Maui and 
the Other Maui Nui Islands
If you’re traveling between Maui and its sister islands of Molokai and
Lanai, you might consider the ferry. Ferry service is available from
Maui’s Lahaina Harbor to Molokai and Lanai, which can really minimize
interisland transport costs.
Molokai Ferry (% 866-307-6524; www.molokaiferry.com) offers ferry
service twice a day, Monday through Saturday, in each direction,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
62

between Lahaina and Molokai on the Maui Princess and the Molokai
Princess. Travel time is approximately 90 minutes, and the one-way fare
is $40 for adults, $20 for kids 4 to 12. One-day golf and guided sightsee-
ing tours of Molokai are also available.
Expeditions Lahaina (% 800-695-2624; www.go-lanai.com) offers
service between Lahaina and Lanai’s Manele Harbor five times daily;
there’s also twice-daily service from Maui’s Ma’alaea Harbor, north of
Kihei on Maui’s neck. The one-way fare is $25 for adults, $20 for kids 2 to
11. The ferry is extremely popular with golfers who choose to spend the
day playing Lanai’s two spectacular championship courses. A variety of
golf and sightseeing packages are also available.
Choosing a Pay-One-Price Package
Comprehensive, pay-one-price travel packages can be the smart way to
go when booking your Hawaii vacation. Besides the convenience of
having all your travel needs taken care of at once, a package can often
save you lots of money. In many cases, a package that includes airfare,
hotel, and transportation to and from the airport costs less than the
hotel alone if you book it yourself.
One reason for this savings is that components of the packages are sold
in bulk to tour operators, travel agents, and resellers, who bundle and
sell them to the public. Even after the packager takes its cut, you may
still realize substantial savings.
Package trips can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels than
others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book
flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters.
Every destination, including Maui, usually has a few packagers that are
better than the rest because they buy in even bigger bulk. The time you
spend shopping around is likely to be well rewarded.
Finding a package deal
Online is probably your best source for package deals. Check out
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Yahoo! Travel (http://travel.yahoo.com), Hotwire (www.hotwire.
com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), which have become some of the
most sophisticated and easy-to-access pay-one-price packagers in the
market.
Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one 
of the biggest packagers in the Northeast. Liberty frequently offers
excellent-value packages, with or without air, to all the Hawaiian 
islands — and its agents are willing to help you construct a multi-island
trip. Calling the toll-free number immediately connects you to the
Liberty Travel store nearest your home.
Chapter 5: Getting to Maui 63

Pleasant Holidays (% 800-742-9244; www.pleasantholidays.com),
the biggest and most comprehensive packager to Hawaii, has more than
40 years of experience and offers tons of package options. Pleasant can
arrange just about any kind of vacation you want, including fly/drive
packages and land-only deals. And because it buys airfares and hotel-
room blocks in such bulk, its deals are often excellent (although it offers
better bargains on some properties than others). Another plus is that
Pleasant maintains service desks on all the major islands; its employees
can help you book activities and answer any questions you may have.
These guys can even finance your vacation for you — but be sure to
check the interest rates.
If you want to work with a travel agency that specializes in booking
packaged Maui vacations, offers a more personalized shopping experi-
ence, and really knows its stuff, contact Melissa McCoy’s Valley Isle–
based Aloha Destinations Vacations (% 800-256-4280 or 213-784-6143;
www.alohadestinations.com).
The big online travel agencies — including Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com), and Yahoo! Travel (http://travel.
yahoo.com) — specialize in pay-one-price vacation packages these days.
As with any packager, the best way to cover yourself — to insure that
you’re really getting the best price — is to price each piece individually
and compare against the pay-one-price tag that any online or three-
dimensional packager is offering.
Some travel packagers, such as Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays, are likely to
book you on their own charter flights rather than on commercial flights
on major airlines. Flying on a charter doesn’t really make a difference,
unless you have a particular allegiance to a specific airline (or to collect-
ing miles in a frequent-flier program). Be sure you know what airline
you’re flying when you book. And if you really do want to fly with a spe-
cific airline, that doesn’t rule out a packager. In fact, Pleasant has estab-
lished relationships with major carriers, such as Delta, United, and
Hawaiian — and just about any packager will be happy to book you a
land-only vacation that lets you book your own airfare separately (even
the airline packagers will do this; see the following section).
Uncovering an airline package
Many major airlines also offer travel packages to Maui, either directly 
or through a trusted package partner. I always recommend comparison
shopping, but you may want to choose the airline that has frequent serv-
ice to your hometown or the one on which you accumulate frequent-flier
miles; you may even be able to pay for your entire package using miles.
The following airlines offer travel packages to Maui as part of their 
services:

Choosing between a travel agent and a packager isn’t an either/or propo-
sition; in fact, your travel agent can be your best source in sorting
through the various deals that are available. If you’re an Amex customer,
you may consider going through American Express Travel Service,

Weighing your options
With the multitude of packages on the market, you may need some help
weighing the various merits of each one. Follow these tips as you sift
through the options:
 Read up on Maui. Read through the hotel listings in this book (see
Chapter 10) and select the places that sound interesting. Compare
the rates that I list with the packagers’ prices to gauge which opera-
tors are really offering a good deal and which have simply gussied
up the rack rates to make their full-fare offer sound like a smart buy.
Remember: Most packagers can offer bigger savings on some prop-
erties than on others. For example, Liberty Travel may give you a
better rate on the Grand Wailea than Pleasant Holidays can, but
Pleasant may offer you a substantial savings on the condo you want.
Chapter 5: Getting to Maui 65

 Compare apples to apples. When comparing packages, make 
sure that you know exactly what’s included in the quoted price 
and what’s not. Don’t assume anything: Some packagers include
everything — including value-added extras, such as lei greetings,
free continental breakfast, and dining discounts — while others
may not even include airfare. Additionally, when considering pack-
age prices, factor in add-in costs if you’re flying from somewhere
other than Los Angeles or San Francisco; some operators price
packages directly from your hometown, and some require addi-
tional premiums for airfares from your hometown to their Los
Angeles or San Francisco gateway.
 Before you commit to a package, make sure you know how much
flexibility you have. Some packagers require iron-clad commit-
ments, while others charge only minimal fees for changes or cancel-
lations. Consider the possibility that your travel plans may change,
and select a packager with the degree of flexibility that suits your
needs. And if you pay up front for a complete vacation package that
carries stiff cancellation penalties, consider buying travel insurance
that will reimburse you in case an unforeseen emergency prevents
you from traveling. (See Chapter 8 for more on this topic.)
 Don’t believe in fairy tales. Unfortunately, shady dealers and fly-
by-night operations are out there. If a package appears too good to
be true, it probably is. Any knowledgeable travel agent can help
you determine whether a specific packager is reputable.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Figuring out which type of lodging is right for you
 Finding luxury accommodations for less
 Getting your room at the best rate
M
aui’s resort hotels are notoriously expensive. So prepare yourself
for the fact that accommodations may take up a larger portion of
your total travel budget than you might expect. That said, don’t forsake
Kaanapali for the Jersey Shore just yet. Maui boasts plenty of excellent
values for every budget if you just know where to look, and I’ve included
lots of reasonably priced options in Chapter 10.
Before you book your accommodations, you need to figure out what
kind of place you want. You find five types of accommodations on Maui:
resorts, hotels, condos, bed-and-breakfasts, and vacation rentals.
Getting to Know Your Options
In Maui, your accommodations options range from ultraposh luxury
resorts to no-frills vacation rentals. Your choice depends on your travel
needs and your budget. Though an expensive resort may be a great
option for that romantic getaway, you may prefer to rent a condo if you
have the kids in tow. Table 6-1 gives you an idea of what you can expect
to pay in each price category.

* Each range of dollar signs, from one ($) to five ($$$$$), represents the median rack-rate
price range for a double room per night. This system applies to each resort, hotel, condo,
B&B, or vacation rental.
Relaxing at a resort
Most resorts (or resort hotels) are multi-acre, multibuilding complexes
located directly on the beach. Some are sophisticated (sometimes too
sophisticated for laid-back Maui, if you ask me), ultraluxury affairs
geared to monied adults; others are theme park–like spreads that cater
largely to families with kids. More than a few fall somewhere in between.
A resort (or resort hotel) offers everything that your average hotel
offers, plus much more. Each one is different, of course, but you can
expect such amenities as direct beach access with beach cabanas and
chairs, and often beach-toy rentals and ocean activities as well; pools
(often more than one) and a Jacuzzi, often with poolside bar service; an
activities desk; a fitness center and often a full-service spa; a variety of
restaurants, bars, and lounges; a 24-hour front desk; concierge, valet,
and bell services; twice-daily maid service (which can come in handy
after you’ve dragged sand in your room and used all your towels by 
4 p.m.); room service; tennis and golf (including some world-class
courses); a business center; extensive kids’ programs; and more.
Rooms may be in high-rise towers, but they’re often scattered through-
out the property in low-rise buildings or clustered cottages. They tend
to be done in the same safe, mass-market style throughout the resort —
generally, room no. 101 is going to look exactly like room no. 1901. As
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
68

travelers increasingly demand more, however, many newer properties
(and savvy new renovations) feature smart, high-style concepts that are
intended to heighten the resort’s unique setting, concept, or personality.
Standards tend to be high, and rooms are usually outfitted with top-
quality furnishings and linens. Many luxury resorts also boast an
increasing slate of in-room extras, such as flat-screen TVs with Nintendo
or other gaming systems, iPod docking units for in-suite music, and DVD
players. Internet access is usually present throughout the property, but
often you’ll find wireless only in the public areas; expect to pay a charge
more often than not.
Being the best outfitted, and usually the best located, of Maui’s accom-
modations options, resorts are also the priciest choices on the market,
although you can find a few midrange resorts. That said, you can some-
times score attractive rates, even at some of the island’s most luxurious
resorts. You may hit pay dirt by booking through a packager (see Chapter
5), or by just calling or checking a resort’s Web site at the right moment,
because many resorts host special offers and package deals on their
own sites.
Hanging at a hotel
Hotels tend to be smaller and have fewer facilities than resorts — you
may get a swimming pool, but don’t expect a golf course or tennis
courts, more than one or two restaurants and/or bars, and everything
else that comes with a full-fledged resort.
Hotels are often a short walk from the beach rather than actually on the
sands. Generally, a hotel offers daily maid service and has a restaurant
and/or coffee shop, a bar or lounge, on-site laundry facilities, a swim-
ming pool, and a sundries- or convenience-type shop (rather than
designer shopping arcades). Top hotels also have activities desks,
concierge and valet services, limited room service, a business center,
and in-room Internet access (more often than not for a daily charge).
Boutique hotels are smaller — maybe 40 or 50 rooms rather than 200 or
more — and more intimate than your average Doubletree or Hilton. The
rooms are often more stylish, less cookie-cutter, and usually have more
amenities. They tend to cater to adults rather than families.
Hotels run the gamut from very expensive to downright cheap. But even
the priciest ones (usually boutique hotels) tend to be less expensive
than fully outfitted resorts.
Staying in a condo
Condominium apartments make up a large percentage of Maui’s accom-
modations. They’re a great option for everyone because they’re outfitted
like a fully operational home and can accommodate anywhere from two
to eight vacationers in one, two, or three bedrooms. You can’t pick a
better way to travel as a family or in a group, but even couples enjoy the
extra space and home-style amenities.
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 69

Condos are usually apartments in either a single high-rise or a cluster of
low-rise buildings, often on the beach, though sometimes not. Because
they’re real apartments, condos almost always come complete with a
fully outfitted kitchen, a living room with pullout sofa (which usually
means that one-bedroom condos can easily accommodate four guests;
two-bedroom condos can accommodate six), a private phone line, and a
washer/dryer (usually), as well as other home-style amenities, such as a
TV and DVD player in the living room (and usually an extra in the master
bedroom). Two-bedroom condos often (but not always) have a second
bathroom; in fact, a good number of one-bedroom condos in Maui also
have a second bathroom. Internet access, either wireless or wired, is
often available, but not always; usually, there’s a daily charge, just as at a
hotel. (Never assume anything; always ask when you book.)
On-site you usually find a swimming pool, laundry facilities (if units
aren’t in the apartments), tennis courts (sometimes), a front desk or
property manager to deal with any questions you may have, and some-
times an activities desk to book snorkel cruises, luaus, and the like.
Don’t expect the kind of service in a condo complex that you’d get at a
hotel. If you prefer room service to your own kitchen, or you want some-
body else to schlep your bags or wash your laundry, go with a hotel or
resort instead.
More often than not, rental condos are individually owned vacation
apartments that the owners use maybe a month or two out of the year.
When the apartments aren’t owner occupied (which is most of the time),
a management company or agent manages and cares for the units and
rents them out. You may book a condo through any number of individ-
uals: an on-site agent or manager, an off-site agent or manager, or an off-
site individual owner. At some condo complexes, more than one manager
may represent units at any one time. In this book, I recommend units
that are all managed by reputable companies with good track records.
(In the cases where more than one agent represents a property, I list the
one I feel will give you the best deal and the best service.)
Because they’re privately owned homes, condo apartments are almost
always individually decorated. However, the management company
always requires a certain standard of décor and certain amenities, so the
rental agent you use should be able to tell you exactly what to expect.
Be sure to ask the specifics on your unit when you book, including the
last time it was renovated or refurnished. If you’re not happy with the
answers you get, inquire about more recently refurbished units in the
same complex; sometimes they may be more expensive, but not always.
Condos range in price from bargain basement to ultraluxury, with the
majority falling on the affordable end of the continuum. I find that
condos are the best values on Maui, hands down, no matter what your
price range. You almost always get more for your money than at a com-
parable resort. Also, because competition between condo properties is
so tight, many good properties offer extras, such as a free rental car and
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
70

the seventh night free, to lure you in. Packagers are a great source for
bargain rates on condos (see Chapter 5).
Most condos offer some kind of maid service. Some have the kind of full
daily service that you get in a hotel; others merely offer a basic weekly
linen change. During my own stays, I’ve found minimal maid service to be
just fine, even pleasant — I like not having the daily intrusion, and I don’t
mind rinsing my own breakfast dishes. But it can be an entirely different
story if you’re traveling with a big brood. Also, most properties that offer
daily or midweek maid service include it in the rate, but a few charge
extra for it. Be sure to ask for specifics when inquiring about a condo.
I list some great condo choices in Chapter 10, but many more options
exist. For additional choices, contact the Hawaii Condo Exchange 
(% 800-442-0404 or 323-436-0300; www.hawaiicondoexchange.com), a
Southern California–based agency that acts as a consolidator for condo
properties throughout the islands, including a number of excellent
choices on Maui. The Exchange works to match you up with the place
that’s right for you and tries to get you a good deal. In addition, most
companies that offer all-inclusive travel packages to Maui can book you
into any number of condos, as can your travel agent.
For a complete selection of upscale condos throughout sunny, luxury-
minded Wailea, reach out to Destination Resorts Hawaii (% 866-384-
1365 or 808-891-6249; www.destinationresortshi.com). Destination
Resorts generally handles first-class properties boasting plenty of
deluxe amenities. Prices start as low as $225 per night for a one-
bedroom unit and go up for a spacious oceanfront four-bedroom. 
Value-added packages, such as fifth-night-free and car-condo deals, 
are regularly available.
Though all of their condos make pleasing choices, Destination Resorts’
Wailea Beach Villas (% 866-901-5207 or 808-891-4500; www.wailea
beachvillas.com) has set a brand-new standard for condominium
luxury on Maui. New to the market in June 2006, these 98 glorious villas
and penthouses blend luxe, home-style comforts with first-class resort
services (even fully stocked kitchens and personal-chef services, should
you wish) and a wonderful Wailea Beach location. Rates run $880 to
$3,000 nightly for the 1,900- to 3,100-square-foot residences, with a five-
night minimum.
If you like the sound of the tranquil Kapalua resort (see Chapter 10), but
the luxury hotel rates are out of your league — or you simply prefer
home-style amenities and privacy — consider renting an elegant condo
or vacation home at Kapalua Villas (% 800-545-0018, 800-227-6054, or
808-665-5400; www.kapaluavillas.com). Nightly rates range from $279
for a one-bedroom apartment with a fairway view to $759 for an ocean-
front three-bedroom apartment — not bad, considering you enjoy the
same delicious perks and spectacular views of your much-higher-paying
neighbors (including Kelsey Grammer, who owns his own Kapalua spread).
Three- to five-bedroom freestanding luxury vacation homes are also
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 71

available, as are golf, tennis, rental-car, and romance packages. Whether
you go large or small, you’re sure to be pleased with your first-class
accommodations.
If you’re looking for affordable sleeps on the South Maui coast, contact
Bello Realty (% 800-541-3060 or 808-879-3328; www.bellomaui
vacations.com). Bello represents affordable condos throughout the
Kihei/Wailea area, with prices starting as low as $99 in the low season,
$115 in the high season. Be sure to check out Koa Resort and Koa
Lagoon, two of Maui’s best bargains (see Chapter 10). I’ve received
plenty of good feedback from vacationers who’ve used Bello and come
away with an excellent beachfront bargain and good service results, so
I’m quite confident about the quality and values that Bello offers.
Condominium Rentals Hawaii (% 800-367-5242 or 808-879-2778; www.
crhmaui.com) also books condos throughout Maui, with a concentra-
tion in Kihei. The car-and-condo packages and other regular specials can
really add to the value of these units.
Maui Beachfront Rentals (% 888-661-7200 or 808-661-3500; www.maui
beachfront.com) can book you into a range of good-value apartments
along West Maui’s condo coast. The studios at the Napili Bay, which
start as low as $145 to $167, are an excellent value for budget-minded
couples. You may even be able to save a few dollars at two of my favorite
Kaanapali Beach condo complexes: The Whaler and Kaanapali Alii.
(See Chapter 10 for more on these three properties.)
You can cut out the middleman and rent directly from the owner at a
number of quality condo resorts throughout the islands by visiting
Aloha Condos Hawaii (www.alohacondos.com), an online cooperative
of owner-managed units; links on the site will connect you directly to the
owner.
Also check out the resources listed under “Making yourself at home in a
vacation rental,” later in this chapter, many of which also offer a variety
of condo rental options.
Enjoying the comforts of a B&B
Staying in a bed-and-breakfast is a very nice way to discover Maui’s genu-
ine aloha spirit. More often than not, B&Bs offer a more intimate, and
often more romantic, setting than your average impersonal resort, and a
host who’s more than happy to help you get to know Hawaii as it really is.
If you want to experience a real slice of island life, B&Bs are the way to go.
B&Bs vary widely in size, style, and services. Generally speaking, they’re
usually comprised of several bedrooms in a home or several cottages or
suites scattered about a property, each of which may or may not have a
private bathroom. (All the B&Bs that I recommend in Chapter 10 have
units with private bathrooms.) Most offer Internet access to laptop
toters, but I’ve found that their networks are not as reliable as those at
the big hotels, so book with a name brand if you must be online.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
72

When you book a B&B, be sure that you fully understand its policies
regarding deposits, cancellations, and method of payment. Because a
B&B is a small business and has a harder time filling last-minute cancel-
lations than a big hotel does, it may have more rigid policies. Despite the
name, B&Bs also vary in whether breakfast is actually included in the
rates, so ask ahead of time. And inquire about any other quirks or poli-
cies that may matter to you, such as whether smoking is allowed (it usu-
ally isn’t) or whether the owners like to have guests take off their shoes
when they enter (they usually do).
You may want to contact one or more of the following agencies if you’re
considering a stay at a B&B:
 Tops in the state is Hawaii’s Best Bed & Breakfasts (% 800-262-
9912 or 808-263-3100; www.bestbnb.com). The owners and staff are
committed to representing only quality B&Bs, inns, and vacation
rentals, and they’re not afraid to say “no” to any property that 
doesn’t meet their standards. They represent only accommodations
with private bathrooms, and all are nonsmoking. Some of their units
are free-standing cottages that resemble vacation homes more than
B&Bs; they even represent a few really nice condos. Note that their
bed-and-breakfasts generally have a three-night minimum stay, and
vacation rentals tend to require a seven-night minimum stay.
 Bed & Breakfast Hawaii (% 800-733-1632 or 808-822-7771; www.
bandb-hawaii.com) can also book you into a range of vacation
homes and B&Bs throughout the islands, with prices starting
around $75 a night.
 You won’t get the same personal service from the Web, but you can
find lots of useful resources there. InnSite (www.innsite.com) fea-
tures B&B listings in all 50 states, including Hawaii, and around the
globe. Find an inn on the island of your choice, see pictures of the
rooms, and check prices and availability; text is included only when
the proprietor submits it. (It’s free to have an inn listed.) The
innkeepers write the descriptions, and many listings link to the
inn’s own Web sites. What’s more, you may be able to score an
additional discount by booking your reservation through InnSite.
Other sites that are worth surfing for Hawaii B&Bs are Bedand
Breakfast.com (www.bedandbreakfast.com) and Bed & Breakfast
Inns Online (www.bbonline.com).
Making yourself at home in a vacation rental
Vacation rental usually means that you have a full cottage or house all to
yourself. You may never even see an owner, agent, or manager after you
pick up the keys. This option is great for families or people who like their
space and privacy or don’t want to eat every meal out at a restaurant —
but if you prefer a full-service experience, it may not be for you.
The rental may be a studio cottage in a residential neighborhood, a
condo, or a huge beachfront multibedroom house — or anything in
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 73

between. They usually have some sort of kitchen facilities, laundry facili-
ties, at least one TV, and at least one phone (ask when booking).
Because vacation rentals are often privately owned homes, they also
may come with such bonuses as extra TVs, DVD players, and stereos
(never assume; always ask if it matters to you). Like condos, they usu-
ally come outfitted with the basics, such as sheets and towels.
Vacation rentals vary greatly in price, depending on their size, location,
and amenities. They tend to be much better values than similarly priced
resort or hotel accommodations, especially if you’re trying to accommo-
date a group or you plan a long stay (a week or more). Just make sure
that you get a 24-hour contact person for those times when the toilet
won’t flush or you can’t figure out how to turn on the air-conditioning.
Hawaii’s Best Bed & Breakfasts is useful for statewide vacation rentals.
A statewide source that’s also worth checking out is Hawaii Beachfront
Vacation Homes (% 808-247-3637; www.hibeach.com).
Contact Hawaii Condo Exchange (% 800-442-0404 or 323-436-0300;
www.hawaiicondoexchange.com), a Southern California–based agency
that acts as a consolidator for condo properties on Maui and throughout
the islands. They’ll work to match you up with the place that’s right for
you and try to get you a good deal.
Also check with Vacation-Maui.com (% 800-676-4112 or 808-661-3484;
www.vacation-maui.com) for vacation rentals of all styles and types,
from affordable to luxury. Kihei Maui Vacations (% 888-568-6284;
www.kmvmaui.com) offers affordable rentals on condos and homes in
the sunny South Maui area.
If you’d like a rental house that’s slightly off the beaten path — either in
Upcountry Maui or in one of the charming communities along the road
to Hana — contact Hookipa Haven Vacation Services (% 800-398-6284
or 808-579-8282; www.hookipa.com), which also offers West Maui beach
houses for lease.
See A Maui Vacation Rental Directory (www.amauivacationrental.
com) if you’d like a one-stop-shopping list of vacation rentals available
direct from their owners. Vacation Rentals by Owner (www.vrbo.com)
offers a similar service.
Landing the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost 
always do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
74

surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may
be pleasantly surprised. But you have to take the initiative and ask,
because many hotels bank on the fact that you’ll just accept the first
rate you’re quoted. You should also chat with the reservations agent
about which rooms are the best and which units match your needs. You
never know what kind of insider advice or upgrade can be won just by
asking a question and turning on the charm.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. That’s because the hotel
may give the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel. However, these days, you can usually do just as
well yourself as long as you’re willing to spend some time online and
investigate your options.
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number or Web site may
also result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other
hand, the central reservations number may not know about discount
rates at specific locations. Your best bet is to call both the local number
and the toll-free number and see which one gives you a better deal, and
then check it against the rate available online.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy rates
rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are subject to
change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different
from the actual rate you receive when you make your reservation.
Don’t automatically shy away if a hotel’s rack rates seem out of your
range at first glance. A hotel’s official “published” (full-price, or rack)
rates usually represent the upper end of what they charge when they’re
full to capacity, but most hotels routinely offer better prices. And special
deals abound in Hawaii, so in each hotel listing throughout this book, I
note what kind of bargains you can typically snag.
Often the best way to get a great deal on a hotel room is to book it as
part of an all-inclusive travel package that includes airfare, hotel, and
car, and sometimes other extras, in one low price. (For details on how to
find the best package deals, see Chapter 5.)
You can find a big list of money-saving strategies in Chapter 4.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or by going through an independent
booking agency.
Expedia (www.expedia.com) offers a long list of special deals, as well 
as “virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so that you can see 
what you’re paying for. Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) posts
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 75

unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Also reliable are Hotels.com (a division of Expedia,
so they often offer the same deals), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Yahoo!
Travel (http://travel.yahoo.com), and Quikbook
(www.quikbook.com).
Keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing are usually there for
no other reason than that they paid money to get the placement.
Always price-compare the rate you get through an online travel agency
against the hotel’s own Web site. These days, virtually every major hotel
chain offers price parity with the online distributors through its own
Web sites. Often, you’ll save a few bucks through the hotel’s own site
and/or end up with a better room for the same money because the hotel
doesn’t have to pay high distribution fees (usually a whopping 25 per-
cent of the rate you pay) if you book direct. If you do book through a
third-party online agency, don’t be surprised if you end up next to the
ice machine or with a view of the parking lot. Hotels generally give their
best rooms to guests that generate the most revenue for them. This
practice shouldn’t prevent you from using online agencies; it simply
means that, unless you’re saving money by booking through a third-
party agency, you’re likely to be better off booking your room direct with
the hotel (or its parent hotel chain).
You may also want to check out TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com)
when you’re considering a hotel. TripAdvisor isn’t a booking site, per se
(although it does offer links to sites that allow you to make bookings),
but it does offer untainted, straight-from-the-customer’s-keyboard
reviews of hotels. Now, I don’t recommend putting too much stock in a
single review — most people have unrealistic expectations, or just plain-
old, bad-luck experiences, now and again — but trends in positive or
negative experiences can become apparent. Also, I love the candid trav-
elers’ photos, which show you what the hotel rooms really look like
(and, often, how small they really are).
An excellent free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help
you search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you may never have
heard of — and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including
the taxes and service charges.
It’s always important to get a confirmation number and make a print-
out of any online booking transaction to avoid any potential issues when
you arrive at the hotel.
In the bidding Web site category, Priceline (www.priceline.com) and
Hotwire (www.hotwire.com) are even better for hotels than for airfares;
with both, you’re allowed to pick the neighborhood and quality level of
your hotel before offering up your money. On the downside, many hotels
stick Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to
BiddingForTravel (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bidding on a
hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of hotels that
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
76

Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay
upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels don’t provide
loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-stay amenities when
you book a room through opaque online services.
Reserving the Best Room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure that you get the best room
in the house. Most Hawaii hoteliers are very friendly and willing to take
the time with you, so don’t be shy — try to find out which units are the
nicest. If the reservations agent doesn’t have any specific recommenda-
tions, try asking for a corner room. In some (but not all) cases, they may
be larger and quieter, with more windows and light than standard
rooms, and they don’t always cost more.
Also ask whether the hotel is renovating, or if any construction is taking
place nearby; this is especially important in Hawaii, where rampant 
renovation has taken hotels by storm in recent years (and will continue
to do so for a few more). If it is, request a room away from the renova-
tion work. Inquire, too, about traffic and the location of the restaurants,
bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise.
And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the
front desk firmly but nicely. (Don’t get emotional — your mom’s old
saying about attracting more flies with honey than with vinegar really
was good advice.) If another room is available, the front desk should be
happy to accommodate you, within reason.
Choosing a room with a view
If you want to see the ocean from your room or condo, expect to pay for
the privilege. Oceanview rooms usually cost substantially more than
rooms with no view or only a partial view, to the tune of $100, $200, or
even $300 more per night than the rate for a similar room without the
view.
Deciding whether to pay for a view isn’t a clear-cut issue. In fact, what
constitutes oceanview is far from an agreed-upon industry standard.
Witness these variations on the theme:
 Oceanfront rooms: Only hotels or condo complexes that sit
squarely on the beach can have oceanfront rooms or apartments.
Positioned directly over the sand and a stone’s throw from the
waves, these units are the best in the house and usually the most
expensive. You may still have to walk through the lobby to get to
the water, but you have an unblocked view of the beach. Keep in
mind, however, that you hear the waves only from lower-floor
rooms; these rooms are often my favorites.
Chapter 6: Booking Your Accommodations 77

 Oceanview rooms: Watch out — some hotels and resorts don’t dis-
tinguish between oceanfront rooms and oceanview rooms, which
also have a full view of the ocean. Oceanview rooms, however,
don’t have to be directly over the sand. They may sit farther 
back — or even across the street — from the beach, or they may
look over the rooftops of other buildings. These units are still fabu-
lous, and generally still expensive.
 Partial oceanview rooms: Partial oceanview is subject to a whole
host of interpretations, depending on who’s doing the offering. It
can be almost as good as full oceanview, or it may mean that you
see a razor-thin slice of blue between two high-rise mountains of
concrete. Ask plenty of questions about any unit offered as “partial
oceanview” and know exactly what you’re paying for before you
book.
 Mountain or gardenview rooms: Most non-oceanview rooms are
called mountainview, meaning that they face the island’s inland
mountains, or gardenview, which means they face an inner court-
yard or grounds. The view can be good or bad, depending on the
location and the layout of the grounds; again, your best bet is to
ask plenty of questions when you reserve. These rooms are usually
the least expensive in a hotel or condo complex. They’re not usu-
ally of poorer quality — they just don’t have the million-dollar
views that those guests on the other side of the building or grounds
have (and are paying for!).
The big question, then, is, “Is it worth it to pay for an oceanview room?”
Before my first visit to Maui, I was convinced that the answer was cut
and dried: no way — too expensive. I’m not going to Maui to hang out in
my room, so why should I pay through the nose for the privilege of
seeing the water from it?
Then I stayed in an oceanfront room, and I was hooked. Letting the
rhythmic sound of the waves and the caress of the ocean breeze lull you
to sleep, and waking to gorgeous ocean views, are unforgettable experi-
ences. You know you’re in Maui — and that fabulous ocean is why you
came all this way in the first place.
I highly recommend staying in an oceanfront (or oceanview) room if you
can afford it. But don’t blow your whole budget just to make it happen.
First, choose the hotel or condo you want based on your needs. Make
sure that the accommodations style suits you, that the space sleeps
your travel companions comfortably, and that the property features all
the amenities and services you need to be happy. To me, these consider-
ations are much more important than the view. After you choose your
property, see whether you can afford to book oceanfront, especially if
the hotel or packager is offering you a nice deal on an upgrade. If you
can, great! But if staying in an oceanfront room means you have to skip
activities or skimp on meals, then go with a cheaper room with a lesser
view. Having an oceanview room isn’t worth compromising the rest of
your trip.

Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem insurmount-
able. But family travel can be immensely rewarding, giving you new ways
of seeing the world through smaller pairs of eyes.
Maui is the perfect ohana (family) vacation destination. You and the
keiki (kids) will love the beaches and the wealth of kid-friendly activities.
Lots of families flock to the islands every summer, as well as at holiday
time and during the spring-break season.
Most hotels and condo complexes, from luxury to budget, welcome the
entire family. Virtually all the larger hotels and resorts have great super-
vised programs for kids 12 and under — which means that you can have
plenty of relaxation time to yourself, as well as playtime with the kids.
Most hotels can also refer you to reliable baby sitters if you want a night
on the town sans youngsters.

By Hawaii state law, hotels can accept only kids between the ages of 5
and 12 into their supervised activity programs.
Condos are particularly suitable for families who want lots of living
space in which to spread out. Parents also appreciate having a kitchen
where they can prepare meals for fussy young eaters and save signifi-
cantly on dining costs. One drawback of condo complexes is that they
typically don’t have the extensive facilities (like kids’ activity programs)
that you’d get in big resorts.
If you want to pack light, Baby’s Away (www.babysaway.com) rents car
seats, cribs, strollers (including jogging strollers), highchairs, playpens,
room monitors, and even toys. It serves Maui (% 800-942-9030 or 808-
875-9030), plus Honolulu (% 800-496-6386 or 808-685-4299) and the Big
Island (% 800-996-9030 or 808-987-9236). Give Baby’s Away a call, and
it’ll deliver whatever you need to wherever you’re staying and pick it up
when you’re done. I suggest arranging your rentals before you leave
home to ensure availability.
Any hotel or condo should be able to refer you to a reliable baby 
sitter with a proven track record. If yours can’t, contact Happy Kids
(% 888-669-1991 or 808-667-5437; www.happykidsmaui.com), The
Nanny Connection (% 808-875-4777 or 808-667-5777; www.thenanny
connection.com), or Nana Enterprises (% 888-584-6262 or 808-879-
6262; www.nanaenterprises.com).
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
such sites as the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com),
a comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family
Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning
site that offers travel features, deals, and tips; Travel with Your Kids
(www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site that offers cus-
tomized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.thefamilytravel
files.com), which offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-
beaten-path tours and tour operators for families. BabyCenter (www.
babycenter.com/travel) has terrific recommendations for planning
baby’s first trip, as well as advice on traveling while pregnant.
Here are a few tips for family travel planning:
 Don’t try to do too much. I can’t say it too strongly. You’ll all con-
sider it the trip from you-know-where if you spend too much time in
the car or on interisland flights.
 Take it slow at the start. Give the entire family time to adjust to a
new time zone, unfamiliar surroundings, and just being on the road.
The best way to do so is to budget a few days in your initial desti-
nation without strict itineraries or lots of moving around.
 Book some private time for yourself. Most, if not all, hotels are
prepared to hook you up with a reliable baby sitter who can enter-
tain your kids while you enjoy a romantic dinner for two or another

adults-only activity. To avoid disappointment, ask about baby-
sitting when you reserve. Local visitor centers can also usually 
recommend licensed and bonded baby-sitting services in their
areas; see the Quick Concierge for contact info.
 Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. I use
it to highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are particu-
larly welcoming to families traveling with kids. Zeroing in on these
listings can help you plan your trip more efficiently.
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
One of the many benefits of getting older is that travel often costs less.
Many hotels and package-tour operators still offer deals for seniors.
Senior discounts are also available at most major Hawaiian attractions,
and occasionally at restaurants and luaus. So when you’re making reser-
vations or buying tickets, ask about senior discounts. Keep in mind,
though, that the minimum age requirement can vary between 50 and 65.
(It’s usually between ages 55 and 65.) Always carry an ID card with you,
especially if you’ve kept your youthful glow.
The statewide Outrigger (% 800-OUTRIGGER [800-688-7444]; www.
outrigger.com) and Ohana (% 800-462-6262; www.ohanahotels.com)
hotel chains offer all travelers over age 50 substantial discounts.
Members of AARP (% 888-687-2277 or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org)
get discounts on hotels, airfare, and car rentals. AARP offers members a
wide range of benefits, including AARP: The Magazine and a monthly
newsletter. Anyone 50 or over can join.
YMT Vacations (% 800-922-9000; www.ymtvacations.com) and Grand
Circle Travel (% 800-959-0405; www.gct.com) are just two of the hun-
dreds of travel agencies that specialize in vacations for seniors, includ-
ing trips to Hawaii. But beware: Many of these outfits are of the tour-bus
variety, with free trips thrown in for those who organize groups of 20 or
more. If you’re the independent type, a regular travel agent may be
better for you.
Elderhostel (% 800-454-5768;www.elderhostel.org), a nonprofit
group that offers travel and study programs around the world, offers
excellent low-cost trips to Hawaii for travelers ages 55 and older (plus a
spouse or companion of any age). Trips usually include moderately
priced accommodations and meals in one low-cost package.
U.S. citizens or permanent residents 62 or older who want to visit
Hawaii’s national parks — including Haleakala National Park on Maui —
can save sightseeing dollars by picking up an America the Beautiful
National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass for Seniors from
any national park, recreation area, or monument. This lifetime pass has
a one-time fee of $10 and provides free admission to all the parks in the
Chapter 7: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 81

National Parks system, plus 50 percent savings on camping and recreation
fees, for the cardholder and all passengers (no more than four adults
total). You can get one at any park entrance as long as you have a proof-of-
age ID on hand. For details, visit www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm.
Travel resources and discounts for seniors include the quarterly maga-
zine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.travel50andbeyond.com); Travel with
a Challenge online magazine (www.travelwithachallenge.com);

by Alison Gardner (Avalon); and Unbelievably Good Deals and Great
Adventures That You Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50, by
Joann Rattner Heilman (McGraw-Hill).
Accessing Hawaii: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
A disability shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. The Americans with
Disabilities Act requires that all public buildings be wheelchair accessi-
ble and have accessible restrooms. Hawaii is very friendly to travelers
with disabilities. Most hotels throughout the islands are on the newer
side and boast wheelchair ramps, extra-wide doorways and halls, and
rooms dedicated to accessibility with extra-large bathrooms, low-set fix-
tures, and/or fire-alarm systems adapted for deaf travelers.
Your best bet is to contact the local visitor bureaus. They can provide
you with all the specifics on accessibility in the community; see the
Quick Concierge at the back of this book for contact info.
Some excellent resources for information on accessible travel are:
 An excellent resource for trip planning assistance is Access Aloha
Travel (% 800-480-1143 or 808-545-1143; www.accessaloha
travel.com). This Hawaii-based travel agency has been planning
accessible trips for travelers with disabilities for decades — and it
donates half its profits to the disabled community. Inquire with
these folks about renting an accessible van during your stay.
 Moss Rehab ResourceNet (% 800-CALL-MOSS [800-225-5667],
215-456-9900, or 215-663-6000; www.mossresourcenet.org) and
Access-Able Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.
com) are comprehensive resources for travelers with disabilities.
Both sites feature links to travel agents who specialize in planning
accessible trips to Hawaii. Access-Able’s user-friendly site also fea-
tures relay and voice numbers for hotels, airlines, and car-rental
companies, plus links to accessible accommodations, attractions,
transportation, tours, and local medical resources and equipment
repairers throughout Hawaii, making this site an invaluable
resource.

work of travel connections. The organization provides information
sheets on destinations and referrals to tour operators that special-
ize in accessible travel. Its quarterly magazine, Open World, is full
of reliable information and resources.
 Vision-impaired travelers who use a Seeing Eye dog can usually
bypass Hawaii’s animal quarantine rules (which were dramatically
loosened in 2004). You can arrange for your guide or service dog to
be inspected in the terminal at Honolulu International Airport if
you notify Animal Quarantine (% 808-483-7151) at least 24 hours
in advance. Call or visit www.hawaii.gov/hdoa for specifics on
rules and fees. Contact the American Foundation for the Blind 
(% 800-232-5463; www.afb.org) for further travel information.
Gammie HomeCare (% 888-540-4032 or 808-877-4032 on Maui, 808-
632-2333 on Kauai; www.gammie.com) rents a wide variety of mobility
aids, bathroom safety devices, and wheelchairs — including beach
wheelchairs that can navigate sand. It’ll deliver to any hotel on Maui or
Kauai. You can reserve the equipment you need up to a year in advance.
Hawaii’s Disability and Communication Access Board has a roundup of
travel tips, with information on arriving, air travel, and where to find
local support services. Visit its Web site at www.state.hi.us/health/
dcab/home, and click on Community Resources in the scroll bar on the
left. Before you book any hotel room, always ask lots of questions based
on your needs. After you arrive, call restaurants, attractions, and thea-
ters to make sure that they’re fully accessible.
Avis has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services as a dedi-
cated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-331-2323; www.avis.com) for
customers who are hearing impaired. Special car features, such as
swivel seats, spinner knobs, and hand controls, and accessible bus serv-
ice are available through the main customer service number (% 800-
352-7900). Many of the big car-rental companies, including Avis, Hertz
(% 800-654-3131 or 800-654-2280 for hearing-impaired travelers; www.
hertz.com), and National (% 800-227-7368, 800-328-6323 for hearing-
impaired travelers, 888-273-5262 for travelers with medical-related
requests; www.nationalcar.com), rent hand-controlled cars for drivers
with disabilities at Hawaii’s major airports. At least 48 to 72 hours’
advance notice is a must, but do yourself a favor and book further in
advance to guarantee availability.

I Do! I Do! Planning a Hawaiian Wedding
No question about it: Maui is the perfect place to get married, which is
why so many couples from around the country, and the world, tie the
knot here every year. What better place to start your life together? And
the members of your wedding party will most likely be delighted because
you’ve given them the perfect excuse for their own island vacation.
For a rundown of the legalities, visit www.hawaii.gov/doh and click
Getting a Marriage License. There you can find all the details, including a
downloadable license application. You can also call % 808-586-4545 for
license information.

Using a wedding planner or coordinator
Wedding planning is a thriving industry in Hawaii. Whether your heart is
set on a huge formal affair at a luxury resort or an informal beachside
ceremony, you won’t have any trouble finding assistance.
Many wedding planners are also marriage-licensing agents, which means
that they can take care of the legalities for you, with only minimal effort
on your part, and then arrange everything else — from providing an offi-
ciate to ordering flowers. A wedding planner can cost $500 or more,
depending on how involved you want her to be and what kind of wed-
ding you want.
Your best bet for finding a reputable wedding planner is to choose one
endorsed by the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, whose Web
site features a complete list of wedding planners to suit any budget; go
to www.gohawaii.com and click Plan a Wedding or Honeymoon. You can
also call the center for recommendations at % 800-GO-HAWAII [800-
464-2924], or — even better — contact the Maui Visitors Bureau
(% 800-525-6284 or 808-244-3530; www.visitmaui.com) for local 
recommendations.
In addition, virtually all the big resorts employ full-time wedding coordi-
nators. Arranging your nuptials directly through a resort may be pricey,
but it’s a relatively worry-free option. The hotel coordinators are
experts, they’ll take all the pesky little details off your hands, and they’ll
usually offer the whole event to you as a pay-one-price wedding pack-
age, including accommodations. What’s more, the hotels generally offer
prime locations for both the ceremony and the reception, whether it’s
for 2 or 200 guests.
Great choices include the Four Seasons Maui, the Grand Wailea, the
Fairmont Kea Lani, the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua, and the Hotel Hana-Maui
(see Chapter 10).
Keep in mind that more affordable hotels and condos, and even some
B&Bs, can often recommend wedding coordinators who have a proven
track record with them. The Kaanapali Beach Hotel, for example, makes
a great affordable option (see Chapter 10). The setting is magical, the
hotel works with a very reliable local planner, and the on-site food-and-
beverage director can arrange a pleasing reception. Don’t hesitate to
contact any property that strikes your fancy; most have wedding experi-
ence or can offer recommendations.
Do-it-yourself planning
When you arrive in Hawaii, you and your intended must appear together
to a marriage licensing agent (basically, a local official who helps you
wrap up the legalities) when applying for the license. A marriage license
costs $60 (payable in cash) and is good for 30 days from the date of
issue. Both parties must be at least 18 years of age (16- and 17-year-olds
must have written consent of both parents, legal guardian, or family
Chapter 7: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 85

court) and can’t be first cousins or more closely related. You’ll need a
photo ID, such as a driver’s license; a birth certificate is necessary only
if you’re 18 or under. No blood tests, citizenship, or residency minimum
is required.
To locate a marriage licensing agent on Maui, call % 808-984-8210; on
Molokai, call % 808-553-3663; or on Lanai, call % 808-565-6411. Or
contact the Honolulu Marriage License Office, State Department of
Health Building, 1250 Punchbowl St., Honolulu (% 808-586-4545 or
808-586-4544), which can direct you to a marriage-licensing agent closest
to where you’ll be staying in the islands. The office is open weekdays
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Local marriage-licensing agents are usually friendly, helpful people who
can steer you to someone who’s licensed by the state of Hawaii to per-
form the ceremony, whether you’re looking for an officiate of a certain
denomination or a plain ol’ justice of the peace. These marriage perform-
ers are great sources of information; they usually know picturesque
places to have the ceremony for free or at a nominal fee.
Some marriage-licensing agents are state employees, and, under law,
they cannot recommend anyone with a religious affiliation; they can give
you phone numbers only for local judges to perform the ceremony. Ask
first what their limitations are, if it matters to you. If you’re interested in
arranging a church ceremony, inquire with the visitor center to locate an
appropriate venue.
You can have a ceremony at any state or county beach or park for free,
but keep in mind that you’ll be sharing the site with the general public.
For a genuine Hawaiian experience, get married at Keawali Congre-
gational Church (% 808-879-5557; www.keawalai.org), a vintage 1831,
oceanfront, coral-block church in picturesque Makena. The gorgeous
grounds — with palm trees and exotic tropical flowers — make a perfect
backdrop for your wedding photo.
Another great site is D. T. Fleming Beach Park, just north of Kapalua in
West Maui. This crescent-shaped beach is generally empty on weekdays,
so you can enjoy a quiet wedding on the beautiful beach as sailboats
skim along offshore.
On Maui’s North Shore is lovely, uncrowded Baldwin Beach Park, a long
ribbon of powdery white sand backed by swaying palms and fringed by
white-crested turquoise waves — perfect for an oceanfront ceremony.

to packing the appropriate gear.
Renting a Car
Maui has so many fabulous things to see and do that it would be a real
shame for you to miss out. The more you want to see, however, the more
you’ll be moving around. In order to maximize your time, you need to
rent a car.
Unfortunately, traffic has increased on Maui in recent years, especially in
the prime resort areas. This is a result of a number of factors — most
notably, the increase in direct neighbor-island flights from the mainland
and the return of cruise-ship traffic to the islands. Throughout this book,
I tell you how to best avoid traffic hot spots whenever possible.
The following companies rent cars on all the major Hawaiian Islands,
including Maui:
 Alamo: % 800-GO ALAMO [800-462-5266]; www.alamo.com
 Avis: % 800-331-1212; www.avis.com
 Budget: % 800-527-0700; www.budget.com
 Dollar: % 800-800-4000; www.dollar.com

 Enterprise: % 800-261-7331; www.enterprise.com
 Hertz: % 800-654-3131; www.hertz.com
 National: % 800-CAR-RENT [800-227-7368];
www.nationalcar.com
 Thrifty: % 800-THRIFTY [800-847-4389]; www.thrifty.com
Be sure to book your rental cars well ahead. They’re almost always at a
premium on Molokai and Lanai, and they may be sold out on all the
islands on holiday weekends.
For tips on renting hand-controlled cars or vans equipped with wheel-
chair lifts, see Chapter 7.
Getting the best deal
Rental cars are relatively affordable in Hawaii, although they do vary
from island to island and from season to season. Because of its popular-
ity, rental cars on Maui tend to be more expensive than the other
islands. Of course, I can’t guarantee what you’ll pay when you book, but
you can often get a compact car for between $160 and $250 a week. If
you want a family-size car — or a convertible — expect to pay anywhere
from $225 to $450 a week, which is pretty reasonable, especially if you
can score a deal. Book ahead for the best rates, because cars tend to get
more expensive as bookings increase.
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, how long you keep it, where and when you pick it up
and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors. Asking a
few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars.
 Book your rental car at weekly rates when possible. Weekly
rentals will almost always save you money over daily rates.
 Mention membership in AAA, AARP, and frequent-flier programs
when booking. These memberships may qualify you for discounts
ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Ask the reservations agency that books your hotel or your inter-
island air travel if it also books rental cars. Many hotels, condo
rental agents, and even B&B owners can book rental cars at seri-
ously discounted rates; ditto for the interisland air carriers,
Hawaiian and Aloha. Often, you can save as much as 30 percent 
off the standard rate. And many Maui hotels and condos offer
excellent-value room-and-car packages that make your rental 
essentially free!
 Shop online. As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the
Internet can make comparison-shopping for a car rental much easier.
You can check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus,
all the major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), Priceline
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
88

(www.priceline.com), Hotwire (www.hotwire.com), Kayak.com
(www.kayak.com), and Yahoo! Travel (http://travel.yahoo.
com), for example — have search engines that can dig up and book
discounted car-rental rates for you.
 If you see an advertised special, ask for that specific rate when
booking. The car-rental company may not offer this information
voluntarily. Be sure to remind the staff; otherwise, you may be
charged the standard (higher) rate.
 Get some friendly help from the locals. AAA Aloha Cars-R-Us
(% 800-655-7989; www.hawaiicarrental.com) is a Hawaii-based
travel agency that specializes exclusively in car rentals on all the
islands. These folks are dedicated to the task of getting you the
cheapest rate from the major car-rental firms — and making it 
one-stop-shopping easy to boot. They combine custom Internet
searches using any available discounts you may be eligible for
(including association and program memberships) with their exclu-
sive wholesale contract rates to find you the best rate possible.
Best of all, there’s no fee for using their service.
 Consider booking your car as part of a complete travel package.
Package deals save you money not only on airfare and accommoda-
tions but also on your rental cars, too. This one-stop shopping can
help streamline the trip-planning process. For more on package
deals, see Chapter 5.
 Scrutinize your rental agreement when you pick up your car. And
check your receipt carefully when you return the vehicle. Make
sure you got the rate you were originally quoted, and straighten out
any discrepancies on the spot.
 Don’t forget to ask about frequent-flier mileage. Most car rentals
are worth at least 500 miles on your frequent-flier account. Be sure
to find out which airlines the rental-car company is affiliated with
so that you can earn mileage. Bring your card with you and make
sure that your account is credited at pickup time.
 Join the rental company’s preferred customer program. Most
companies offer such promotions. You may be able to snag a bar-
gain rate or have a better shot at an upgrade if you’re a member.
Some companies make the process of picking up your car more
hassle-free for members, too. And membership can work just like
the airlines’ frequent-flier plans: Renting from the same company
several times can land you a free day or other perks.
 Make sure that you’re getting free unlimited mileage. Thankfully,
most of the major car-rental companies rent on an unlimited-miles
basis, but you should confirm this policy when you book. Even on
an island, the miles you drive can really add up.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car-rental companies add
on a fee for drivers under 25, while some don’t rent to them at all.
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 89

In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes). The
Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for damage
to the car in a collision, is automatically covered by many credit card
companies. Check with your credit card company before you leave
home so that you can avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 or $25
a day). In any event, make sure that you’re covered. (See “Following the
rules of the road,” later in this chapter; Hawaii is a no-fault state, which
has important insurance implications.)
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your car insurance policy back home proba-
bly covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, don’t assume —
be sure to check before you leave home, and tote your insurance card
with you.
If your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals, or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage. (Ask your car-
rental agent for more information.) Unless you’re toting around the Hope
diamond — and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk anyway —
you can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around
without liability coverage is never a good idea. Note that credit cards
don’t cover you for liability, even if they cover you for collision.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas up front and can return the car with an empty gas
tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you don’t
get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this option, you
pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car with a full
tank or face charges of $6 or more per gallon for any shortfall. If you usu-
ally run late and a fueling stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a
perfect candidate for the fuel-purchase option, but for most people, it’s
not much of a hardship to top off your tank on the way to the airport.
Hawaii how-to: Renting convertibles
Renting a convertible is a lot like booking an oceanview room. It’s a great
idea if you can afford it, but not worth it if it’s going to put a strain on
your budget. The cost of going topless can be double or more than what
you’d pay for a regular car. Expect to pay between $50 and $90 a day for
a convertible, compared with $30 or $40 a day for a better-equipped
midsize car (with such extras as power windows and power locks that
don’t usually come with convertibles).
If you really want to rent a convertible for your island driving but you’re
worried about cost, consider the following:
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
90

 Rent a convertible for just part of your trip. If you’re going to be
visiting two or three islands, book a convertible on just one of
them. And Maui is the place to do it — cruising the road to Hana
with the top down really is the ultimate Hawaii vacation dream.
 Ask about upgrades when you pick up your rental car. This ques-
tion may prove especially beneficial if you’re visiting in the off-
season. Sometimes, if a rental-car branch has a few idle convertibles
sitting around, you may be offered an on-the-spot upgrade for $15
to $25 more a day. If you negotiated a decent compact or midsize
rate when you booked, the total should come out to substantially
less than the convertible rate offered over the phone.
Following the rules of the road
Know these driving rules and common practices before you get behind
the wheel on Maui:
 Hawaii is a no-fault insurance state. If you drive without collision-
damage insurance, you’re required to pay for all damages before
you leave the state, regardless of who’s at fault. Your personal auto
policy may provide rental-car coverage; read your policy or check
with your insurer before you leave home, and be sure to bring your
insurance ID card if you decline the rental-car company’s optional
insurance. Some credit card companies also provide collision
damage insurance; check with yours.
 Seatbelts are mandatory for everyone in the car, all the time. The
law is strictly enforced, so be sure to buckle up. All children under
age 4 must be strapped into car seats.
 You can turn right on red unless a posted sign specifies other-
wise. Make sure that you make a full stop first — no rolling.
 Pedestrians always have the right of way. This is true even if
they’re not on a crosswalk.
 Use your horn judiciously. Honking your horn to express your
anger at another driver is considered the height of rudeness in
Hawaii. Don’t do it unless you’re alerting someone to immediate
danger. Horns are used to greet friends in Hawaii.
Do not use your rental car as a safe in which to store valuables. Don’t
leave anything that you don’t want to lose in the car or trunk, not even
for a short time. Be especially careful when you park at beaches, where
thieves know that you’re going to leave your car for a while (and you’re
likely to leave goodies in the glove compartment).
Maui is very easy to negotiate, and all the rental-car companies hand out
very good map booklets on each island. If all you have is what National
or Hertz gives you, you’ll do just fine.
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 91

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. Check your existing
homeowner’s and auto insurance policies and your credit card coverage
before buying any additional insurance. You may already be covered.
The cost of travel insurance varies widely, depending on the cost and
length of your trip, your age and health, and the type of trip you’re
taking, but expect to pay between 5 percent and 8 percent of the cost of
the vacation itself. You can get estimates from various providers through
InsureMyTrip.com, which compares more than a dozen companies.
Here are some tips on each of the three kinds of travel insurance and
whether to buy:
 Trip-cancellation insurance may make sense if you’re paying for
your vacation up front — say, by purchasing a cruise, package deal,
or escorted tour. Coverage will help you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the Department of State
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually don’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in October 2001 because they were wary of
flying.)
A good resource is “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies 
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
guard.com; click on Customer Service to find the alerts, which fea-
tured a fair number of in-trouble airlines in 2008). Protect yourself
further by paying for the insurance with a credit card; by law, con-
sumers can get their money back on goods and services not
received if they report the loss within 60 days after the charge is
listed on their credit card statement.
Note: Many tour operators include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for travelers to obtain
insurance. Make sure that the tour company is a reputable one.
Some experts suggest that you avoid buying insurance from the
tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying it’s safer to
buy from a third-party insurer than to put all your money in one
place.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip 
doesn’t make sense for most travelers. Most existing health poli-
cies cover you if you get sick away from home — but check before
you go, particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
92

 Lost-luggage insurance is also not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, see
whether your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy,
get baggage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-
insurance package, or buy Travel Guard’s BagTrak product. Don’t
buy insurance at the airport — it’s usually overpriced.
The best advice is simple: Don’t pack anything vital in your checked lug-
gage. Be sure to take any expensive or irreplaceable items with you in
your carry-on luggage, because many valuables (including books,
money, and electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
Always make sure you hold onto your luggage claim ticket until you
reclaim your bags. If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage
claim at the airport, detailing the contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival.
The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your
house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended in-
surers: Access America (% 800-284-8300; www.accessamerica.com),
AIG Travel Guard (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com), Travel
Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.com), 
or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-
insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time I checked, germs weren’t listening to me any more than
they probably listen to you.)
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour 
hot line.
Be sure to consult Chapter 12, which contains lots of important advice
on ocean safety and avoiding sunburn.
In the unlikely event that you do get sick in Hawaii, keep the following in
mind:
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 93

 By law, all employers in Hawaii must provide health insurance for
their employees, and almost all islanders have insurance. As a
result, some doctors simply won’t see patients who aren’t insured.
If you don’t have insurance (or you don’t have insurance that 
travels with you) and you need to see a doctor while you’re in
Hawaii, be sure to inform him when you call to make an appoint-
ment. Check the Quick Concierge at the back of this book to find a
doctor or medical-care clinic that regularly caters to visitors.
 Longs Drugs, which has branches throughout the islands, accepts
most national prescription cards, such as PCS — so if you have a
card, bring it with you. If you get sick and need to fill a prescription
during your trip, chances are good that you’ll only have to pay a
co-pay. To find a Longs near you, call % 800-865-6647 or visit
www.longsdrugs.com.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
If you’d like to stay connected with your real life while you’re in the
islands, then the following sections are for you.
Using your cellphone across the United States
Most major cellphone networks have great coverage in Hawaii. However,
don’t just assume that because your cellphone works at home that it’ll
work in the islands. Take a look at your wireless company’s coverage
map on its Web site before getting on the plane. You should also check
your cellphone contract, because coverage varies depending on the par-
ticular package you’ve purchased. If you need to stay in touch at a desti-
nation where you know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that does
from InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com).
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach
of our Global System for Mobiles (GSM) wireless network, which is
used by much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work 
in most major U.S. cities, but rural coverage tends to be haphazard; 
the good news is that Hawaii is well covered. (To see where GSM 
phones work in the United States, check out www.wireless.att.com/
coverageviewer.) You may or may not be able to send text messages
home. Assume nothing — call your wireless provider and get the full
scoop. In a worst-case scenario, you can always rent a phone; InTouch
USA delivers to hotels.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of options to access the Internet on the
road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA, pocket PC, or
Web-compatible cellphone — gives you the most flexibility. But even if
you don’t have a computer, you can still access your e-mail and even
your office computer from cybercafes and hotel business centers.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
94

It’s hard these days to find a destination that doesn’t have a few cyber-
cafes. Although there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes, two places
to start looking are at www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Almost all but the most budget-basic hotels offer wireless or wired
Internet access that you can plug right into; the price of access can
range from complimentary to $15 or $20 a day. Even most (but not all)
bed-and-breakfasts offer Internet access these days. Check with your
hotel in advance to see what your options are.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates, as well as wireless Internet access for laptop toters. Some
airports charge, while others provide free service. Kiosks give you basic
Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe
prices. Most Hawaii airports offer limited access for a cost through
Boingo.com.
To retrieve your e-mail, check with your Internet service provider (ISP)
to see if it offers a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail
account. Virtually all do these days. If your ISP doesn’t have such an
interface, you can use the free mail2web service (www.mail2web.com)
to view and reply to your home e-mail. Or open a free, Web-based e-mail
account with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). Microsoft’s
Windows Live, formerly known as Hotmail (http://mail.live.com), is
another popular option.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided your target PC is on and has
an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with a Road Runner
cable). The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried
about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe computer to
access the GoToMyPC system.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
Even after the federalization of airport security, security procedures at
U.S. airports tend to be uneven. But generally you’ll be fine if you arrive
at the airport at least 90 minutes before a domestic flight (transpacific or
interisland) and at least two hours before an international flight. Be sure
to allow extra time if you’re traveling on a high-volume holiday getaway
day, or if the terrorism alert level has been raised.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 don’t need
government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for inter-
national flights to most countries.)
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 95

E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with 
E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic
kiosks or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-
in involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing your boarding pass; this is usually allowable 24 hours
in advance of flight time. If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the
credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print
your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security
checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or
looking to snag an exit-row seat, you’ll be able to do so using most air-
line kiosks. Curbside check-in can also be a good way to avoid lines, if
it’s available.
Security checkpoint lines have become more efficient as the Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA) has staffed up and streamlined the
process, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can
prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
passengers with disabilities or children.
The TSA dictates what you can carry on and what you can’t. The gen-
eral rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are okay. Food and
beverages are not allowed in containers larger than 3 ounces. Liquids or
gels — that is, most toiletries — must be 3 ounces or smaller, and must
be placed in a clear quart-size plastic, zip-top bag and screened sepa-
rately from your other luggage. All other toiletries must be transported
to your destination in your checked luggage.
Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “per-
sonal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders
can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in
it, it’s still considered a personal item. The TSA has issued a list of
restricted items; I highly recommend checking its Web site
(www.tsa.gov) for up-to-the-minute details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone and TravelSmith stores. (You can buy them online at
www.brookstone.com or www.travelsmith.com.) These locks,
approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors with a spe-
cial code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.travel
sentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-approved locks, your
lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to hand-search
your luggage.

Making Reservations before You Leave Home
In addition to buying your airfare, booking your accommodations, and
reserving a rental car, you may want to make a few plans before you
leave home.
You don’t have to call ahead to reserve most activities until you arrive
on Maui. Most snorkel cruises, guided tours, and the like can be reserved
a day or two in advance. Even high-profile restaurants can usually get
you in within a few days of the day you call.
Still, planning is never a bad idea — especially if you’re traveling over
spring break or the holidays. I recommend booking anything you
absolutely do not want to miss before you leave home to ensure that
you’re not disappointed. And it’s an absolute necessity for certain spe-
cial events and activities, including the following:
 Luaus: Maui’s Old Lahaina Luau is the best luau in the islands; it
always sells out at least a week in advance, often more, as does its
sister luau, The Feast at Lele. It’s never too early to reserve your
seats; see Chapter 11 for contact information.
 Snorkel cruises: Maui’s finest snorkel-cruise operator is Trilogy
Excursions. These cruises are hugely popular, so you may want to
book your trip to Molokai or Lanai, both red-hot snorkel spots,
before you leave home (see Chapter 12).
 Special guided tours: I highly recommend making advance book-
ings for Maui’s excellent Pony Express horseback rides into
Haleakala National Park’s crater to guard against disappointment
(see Chapter 13).
 Special events: Certain special events require advance planning or
arrangements, such as the Kapalua Wine & Food Festival. Check
Chapter 3 to see what will be on while you’re traveling, and
whether it requires advance planning. You may also want to 
check www.visitmaui.com.
 Special-occasion or holiday meals: These should always be
reserved in advance to avoid disappointment. This is especially
true on holidays, when the nicer restaurants are overrun with
locals and visitors alike. Take it from me on this one — I couldn’t
get a same-day table at a decent restaurant on Mother’s Day to save
my life.
 Scuba classes: First-time scuba divers may want to look into the
various resort courses that are available, because they differ 
from outfitter to outfitter. See Chapter 12 for reputable local dive
instructors.
Consider taking scuba certification classes before you leave home;
that way, you don’t waste time learning in some resort swimming
pool and can dive right in as soon as you get to Maui. A great way
Chapter 8: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 97

to find a local scuba instructor near your home is via the
Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) Web site; go
online to www.padi.com and click on Dive Centers and Resorts.
 Tee times: If you’ve got your heart set on playing a particular
course, it’s a good idea to call ahead to book your tee time. This
advice is especially true on Lanai, where the two resort courses
insist that you reserve 90 days in advance.
 Molokai mule ride to Kalaupapa National Historic Park: Riding a
mule down Molokai’s towering sea cliffs to visit this remote and
poignant site is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. (Even if you’re not
planning to stay on Molokai, you can do it on a day trip from Maui.)
Making reservations well in advance of your visit is important as
space is limited on these unique tours. See Chapter 16 for complete
details.
Planning a few of your activities in advance is often the best way to guar-
antee that you won’t miss out on an event or a restaurant that you’ve
been counting on. That way, if a group suddenly decides that it’s going
to take over a snorkel boat for a full day, or a restaurant is planning to
close down for a week to install a new stove in the kitchen, you have the
opportunity to amend your plans accordingly. Besides, you don’t want
to spend your valuable Maui time on the phone in your hotel room, 
do you?
Packing Smart
Now that airlines are charging for checked bags, it’s more important
than ever to leave anything you really don’t need at home. To start your
packing, set aside everything that you think you need to take. Then get
rid of half of it.
Even if the airlines will let you take it all (with some limits), carting loads
of stuff around Hawaii is a big fat drag. You really can do without that
sixth pair of sandals. Besides, suitcase and duffel-bag straps can be par-
ticularly painful on sunburned shoulders, and you’ll probably spend all
day in your bathing suit anyway. What’s more, almost all hotel and
condo complexes have on-site laundry facilities, lest you actually run
out of clothes or spill a mai tai on your favorite sundress.
Here are the essentials that you should pack:
 More than one swimsuit: Finding out that yesterday’s swimsuit
isn’t dry today is a real bummer. You’ll use the extra, I swear.
 Sunglasses, a sun hat, and high-SPF sunscreen: Take SPF 15 at 
minimum; 30 is better. The Hawaiian sun is very strong.
 Beach sandals: I don’t want you to scorch your feet on the sand.
Inexpensive flip-flops do the trick.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Maui 
98

 A sweater or light jacket: The evenings can get breezy.
Windbreakers come in particularly handy for active travelers.
 Good, comfortable walking shoes: Bring sturdy tennis shoes or
hiking boots if you plan to hike, especially if you’re going to visit
Haleakala National Park.
 A warm jacket and long pants: You really need these if you plan to
visit Haleakala National Park or some other Upcountry location
that gets cool even in summer. Basically, count on the temperature
dropping 31⁄2 degrees for every 1,000 feet you climb, which means
that it can be 35 degrees cooler atop Haleakala’s peak than it is at
the beach.
 Rain gear: A waterproof jacket with a hood is always a good idea if
you’re visiting Maui between November and March.
 Binoculars: These come in handy during whale-watching season or
to spot dolphins, birds, or other critters at any time of year.
 Dramamine or nausea-prevention wristbands: These can save the
day on a snorkel or sunset cruise. (If you plan to rely on Dramamine
to prevent car- or seasickness, be sure to take it before you set 
out — it’s too late after you’re already on the curving coastal road
or rough open seas.)
 A cellphone: It can be an invaluable lifeline in the event that you
get a flat or your rental car breaks down.
 An extra pair of eyeglasses or contact lenses: Always a good idea
to prevent an inconvenient “Ack — I can’t see!” emergency.
Maui is a very easygoing place, so leave the pantyhose and pumps and
the jacket and tie at home. A casual dress or a polo shirt and khakis will
get you by in most dining rooms in the islands — even the expensive
ones. One or two ultrafancy resort restaurants may require a jacket, but
that’s all wrong for Maui, so I don’t recommend them.
Hawaiian-print aloha wear is acceptable throughout the islands. I tell
you where to buy Maui’s best-quality and most beautiful aloha clothes in
Chapter 14. You say that you’ll never wear it again after you get home?
You should — aloha wear looks great everywhere!
Bring all your prescription meds, of course, but don’t bother hauling a
half-dozen bottles of saline solution or 16 rolls of film from home. Maui
has a fine collection of drugstores. If you forget anything, it’s generally
not a problem. You can buy everything you need, and lots of stuff you
don’t.

M
aui is slightly more difficult to navigate than the other Hawaiian
Islands. Instead of circling the island, all the major roads meet
and crisscross on the flat land between the island’s two volcanoes. Still,
getting around isn’t overly complicated. With a good map in hand,
you’re golden.
In this chapter, I give you a quick and easy overview of Maui’s geogra-
phy, with a thumbnail sketch of the island’s major hotel districts. This
information can help you decide where you want to base yourself.
Arriving at Kahului Airport
You’ll most likely arrive at the island’s centrally located main gateway,
Kahului (ka-hoo-loo-ee) Airport, in Central Maui.
Kahului Airport (% 808-872-3893; www.state.hi.us/dot/airports/
maui/ogg) is conveniently located 3 miles from the town of Kahului,
Maui’s main community, at the end of Keolani Place (just west of the
intersection of Dairy Road and the Haleakala Highway).
Flying directly between the mainland and Maui is quite easy these days.
Hawaiian Airlines provides interisland and direct mainland services to
Kahului. American, Air Canada, Continental, Delta, United, and US
Airways all serve Kahului directly from the mainland as well. And, in
addition to Hawaiian, recent entry go! Airlines also connects Maui with
Hawaii’s other islands. (See Chapter 5 for complete details on contacting
the airlines and scoring the best airfares.)

THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Around 105

Open-air Kahului Airport is easy to negotiate. The airport is relatively
small, and the route from your gate to baggage claim is clearly marked.
Nearly all the island’s highways are accessible just outside the airport,
ready to whisk you to wherever you’ll be staying.
Although nearly everyone arrives at Kahului Airport, Maui does have
two single-strip airports served by commercial propeller carriers — one
in Kapalua (in West Maui) and another in Hana. If you’re interested in
avoiding busy Kahului altogether, contact Island Air (% 800-652-6541
or 808-484-2222; www.islandair.com) or Pacific Wings (% 888-575-
4546 or 808-873-0877; www.pacificwings.com).
Getting from the Airport to Your Hotel
All the major auto-rental agencies have cars available at Kahului, and I
suggest that you arrange for one in advance. (For more on this subject,
see Chapter 8.) If you’d rather not drive yourself, I give you some alter-
native transportation options in this section. But if you’re willing to
drive, having your own rental car is really the way to go.
Driving yourself
Step outside to the curbside rental-car pickup area at the ocean end of
the terminal (to your right as you exit the building). Go over to the
counter, if your rental company is represented, or wait for the appropri-
ate shuttle van — they circle the pickup area at regular intervals — to
take you a half-mile to your rental-car checkout desk.
All the rental-car agencies offer map booklets that are invaluable for get-
ting around the island.
Getting from the airport to your hotel can be a bit of a trial because
Kahului is Maui’s main business district and Maui’s main highways inter-
sect just outside the airport.
If you’re heading to West Maui, take the Kuihelani (koo-ee-hay-la-nee)
Highway (Highway 380) to the Honoapiilani (ho-no-ah-pee-ee-la-nee)
Highway (Highway 30). The Honoapiilani Highway curves around the
knob that is West Maui, leading to Lahaina, Kaanapali, Kahana, Napili,
and finally Kapalua. To pick up the Kuihelani Highway, exit the airport at
Keolani Place and turn left onto Dairy Road, which turns into the high-
way you want. Expect it to take 30 minutes to reach Lahaina, 40 minutes
to reach Kaanapali, and 50 to 60 minutes to reach Kapalua, maybe a little
longer if the traffic’s heavy.
If you’re heading to South Maui, exit the airport at Keolani Place, turn
left onto Dairy Road, and then left onto Puunene (poo-oo-nay-nay)
Avenue (Highway 350), which takes you immediately to the Mokulele
(mow-koo-lay-lay) Highway (Highway 311), leading directly south. Just
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
106

north of Kihei, the Mokulele ends; you can choose to continue on the
highway — now called Piilani (pee-ee-la-nee) Highway (Highway 31) —
which takes you through Kihei and to Wailea along the speediest route,
with frequent exits along the way. If you’re staying at the north end of
Kihei, though, exit the Mokulele Highway onto South Kihei Road, Kihei’s
main drag.
Taking a taxi
As long as you arrive before 10 p.m., you don’t need to make arrange-
ments before you leave home to have a taxi pick you up at the airport.
Just go out to the well-marked curbside area and hop into the next avail-
able cab.
If you want to arrange for pickup ahead of time, call Maui Airport Taxi
(% 808-281-9533; www.nokaoitaxi.com), Kihei Taxi (% 808-879-3000),
Wailea Taxi (% 808-874-5000), or Maui Taxi Service (% 808-276-9515;
www.mauipleasanttaxi.com).
The mandated fare on Maui is $3 per mile, accommodating one to six
people. Expect to pay $65 to $105, depending on your West Maui destina-
tion, and about $42 to $55 to the Kihei/Wailea area. Don’t forget to tack
on a 10 percent to 15 percent tip, of course.
For limousine service, contact Star Limousine (% 877-875-6900 or
808-669-6900; www.limohawaii.com) or Maui Executive Transportation
(% 800-833-2303; www.mauishuttle.com).
Catching a shuttle ride
If you’re not renting a car, the cheapest way to get to your hotel is via
airport shuttle. SpeediShuttle (% 877-242-5777 or 808-242-7777; www.
speedishuttle.com) can take you between Kahului Airport and any 
of the Maui resort areas between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily. Rates vary
depending on your destination, but figure on $38 to Wailea (one way)
and $54 to Kaanapali. (Rates also vary depending on the number of
people riding with you.) You can set up your airport pickup in advance
(which allows you to snag a 10 percent online-booking discount on your
return trip) or use the courtesy phone in baggage claim to summon a
van (dial % 65).
When you’re ready to leave Maui and fly home, call at least 24 hours
before your departure flight to arrange pickup.
Choosing Your Location
The commercial hub of Maui is Kahului (ka-hoo-loo-ee). Just east of
Kahului is Wailuku, Maui’s appealingly funky county seat (and a bur-
geoning antiques center). These two Central Maui communities are
Maui’s largest, but despite their central-to-everything convenience, they
aren’t really vacation destinations.
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Around 107

Instead, most visitors stay on one of the two major resort coasts: West
Maui and South Maui. Each one is made up of a series of smaller beach
resorts and communities and offers its own distinct personality.
West Maui
Look at a map of Maui — the island faintly resembles the head and
shoulders of a person in left profile. If you go with this geographical
inkblot test, the West Maui coastline serves as the island’s forehead (and
Kahului is on Maui’s “neck”). In winter, this coast is a little greener —
and a little wetter — than the South Maui coast. Some of the best beaches
on the island fringe West Maui; eastward, the beautifully jagged moun-
tain peaks of the West Maui Mountains rise in the distance.
Of the coastal communities, only Lahaina is a real town; the others are
really just collections of condos and hotels, each targeted to a different
audience and anchored by a few fancy resorts or a high-end minimall.
The following communities start at the southern end of West Maui and
head northward along the Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30):
 The port town of Lahaina still has a historic heart, but it equals
Oahu’s Waikiki as a tacky tourist center. The blocks are lined with
bustling waterfront restaurants, touristy (but increasingly upscale)
galleries and shops, and activities centers with employees that beg
to book your activities (or, if they can, talk you into sitting through
a timeshare presentation). The predominant vibe is that of one big
surf-oriented street party. Many people love the freewheeling ambi-
ence, lively energy, and oceanfront setting; others, who prefer a qui-
eter or more genuinely local vibe, don’t. Lahaina also has three
main advantages: some of Maui’s best accommodations values, an
extremely convenient location, and proximity to some very good
restaurants and night spots. Lahaina boasts a couple of beaches
that will do in a pinch, but if you stay here, you should expect to
drive a bit to reach the best ones.
 Three miles north of Lahaina is Kaanapali (ka-ah-na-pa-lee),
Hawaii’s first master-planned family resort, and a real favorite of
mine. Kaanapali’s string of resort hotels and condos fronts a gor-
geous golden beach and exudes a nice sense of continuity. A land-
scaped parkway and a walking path along the sand, with a very
nice shopping and dining complex sitting at their midpoint, link
them all together. Kaanapali is pricey, but not quite as expensive as
Kapalua or Wailea. In fact, it’s home to my favorite midrange resort,
the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, and some of Maui’s best midrange and
upscale condos, including Kaanapali Alii. See Chapter 10 for more
details.
 Two condo communities, Kahana and Napili, sit off the highway a
few minutes north of Kaanapali, offering great deals for those trav-
elers who want an affordable place to stay and a nice oceanfront
setting. Apartment-style units offer a good value for families or
anyone who wants homelike amenities that give you the freedom to
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
108

cook a meal for yourself or wash your own socks. Some very good
restaurants and supermarkets also are nearby. The only downside
is a lack of personality — expect homogeneous, bulky, and bland
condo complexes. (Who can complain, though, when the ocean is
just a hop, skip, and a jump away?)
 North of Kahana is Hawaii’s most beautiful master-planned commu-
nity, Kapalua, the exclusive domain of a gracious Ritz-Carlton as
well as some luxurious condos, fabulous gold-sand beaches, and
world-class golf. Kapalua is a marvelous place to settle in and
unwind, if you enjoy a gorgeously manicured resort setting and
have the big bucks to do so. But because it’s situated at the north
end of the Honoapiilani Highway, Kapalua isn’t the most convenient
base; even Lahaina is a 20-minute drive to the south. Still, the glori-
ous setting can be well worth the tradeoff. Kapalua also tends to
get more rain than other Maui resorts, even those a few minutes
south on the West Maui coast.
South Maui
South Maui is the island’s hottest, driest, and most dependably sunny
coast. Actually western-facing, but well-protected from the elements by
peninsula-like West Maui, South Maui receives only about 15 inches of
annual rainfall, and temperatures stay around 80°F year-round.
If you drive south from Central Maui along Piilani Highway (Highway 31)
or Kihei Road (Highway 310), you first reach Kihei and then Wailea;
which one you choose depends entirely on your budget.
 Centrally located Kihei (key-hay) is Maui’s bargain coast. Its main
drag is South Kihei Road, which is bordered by a continuous string
of condos and minimalls on one side and a series of sandy beaches
on the other. Kihei isn’t charming or quaint — it feels more like
Southern California than Hawaii at times, especially when Kihei
Road has bumper-to-bumper traffic — but ongoing renovation is
improving its appeal. And what Kihei lacks in physical appeal it
more than makes up for in sunshine, affordability, and convenience.
 Just a few minutes south of Kihei, Wailea (why-lay-ah) is upscale all
the way. This ritzy, well-manicured neighborhood is home to Maui’s
best luxury resort spreads, a host of championship golf courses,
five outstanding beaches, the elegant Shops at Wailea for dining
and shopping, and the Wailea Tennis Center (known as Wimbledon
West). The strip is well developed and tightly packed, and my
favorite Wailea resorts remain worlds unto themselves. Even
though Kapalua is more beautiful, Wailea is no slouch — and I
prefer its more accessible location and wider range of hotel
choices. You even find some midrange and upscale condos in this
appealing neck of the woods.
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Around 109

Upcountry Maui
Cool, agricultural, inland Upcountry Maui puts you away from the
beaches (which are a 15- to 30-minute drive away) but closer to
Haleakala (ha-lay-ah-ka-la) National Park. That proximity can save you
hours of sleep if you want to see the sunrise over the crater. You also
can visit the park from the beach resort areas, but you have to get up in
the middle of the night to make the drive in time for the first rays of
dawn.
Upcountry offers a beautiful glimpse into rural Maui. Most accommoda-
tions are quiet, intimate, isolated affairs (B&Bs or vacation rentals) that
are perfect for those travelers who love solitude, wonderful views, and
romance. Upcountry Maui is a little funkier and local-minded than the
beach resorts, and more prone to cool weather and rain.
If you want easy access to sun and surf, plenty of action, and tons of
services and facilities, Upcountry isn’t for you. It is, however, reachable
as a day trip from the West and South Maui resorts — and you may
enjoy staying there for a couple of nights after you’ve had your fill of
baking on the sands. Even if you decide not to stay there, I highly recom-
mend that you at least take a drive Upcountry.
If you’re considering a visit or a stay in Upcountry, check out Chapter 10.
East Maui and Hana
The gateway to east Maui is the funky-charming Paia (pa-ee-ah), a hip
little surf town about ten minutes east of Kahului that has three main
draws: some hip and artsy boutiquing, some of the island’s best-value
restaurants, and the best windsurfing beach in the world, Hookipa Beach
Park, which I discuss in Chapter 12.
A few visitors like to stay way out in Hana, in easternmost Maui, for the
ultimate escape. In Chapter 10, I review a handful of B&Bs and vacation
rentals on the road to Hana or in this lovely town itself. In Hana, you can
relax in a lush, green, rural setting with access to wonderful beaches.
Hana tends to receive more rain than the dry South Maui coast, but as
compensation, the vegetation is green, and it boasts a luxuriant rain
forest — think giant ferns, vibrant tropical flowers, and swaying palms.
Hana is a sleepy area, where the accommodations tend to be intimate
and exquisite, but not laden with facilities. If you want to get away, a stay
in Hana is just the ticket; if you want to be in the thick of things, stay in
West or South Maui.
You can see this beautiful area on a day’s drive from the major resort
coasts, but that tends to be a rushed experience. I highly recommend
doing the drive at a leisurely pace and staying overnight in Hana if you
can. If you have the time — and the wallet — I recommend doing the
drive and staying overnight at the gloriously renovated Hotel Hana-
Maui (reviewed in Chapter 10). More affordable, B&B-style options are
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
110

also available if your pockets aren’t quite so deep. Hana is a wonderful
departure from the bustle of South and West Maui — a step back 
into Hawaii’s simpler days before tourism spawned such intense 
development.
If you’re contemplating a visit or a stay in Hana, check out Chapter 10.
Finding Information after You Arrive
After you land at Kahului Airport, stop over at the state-operated Visitor
Information Center while you’re waiting for your luggage. Pick up
copies of This Week Maui, 101 Things to Do on Maui, and other free
tourist publications, including ones on Maui dining and the arts scene. If
you forget, don’t worry — you can find these publications at malls and
shopping centers around the island.
In addition, all the big resort hotels are overflowing with printed info.
Even if your hotel or condo doesn’t have a dedicated concierge, the staff
can point you in the right direction, make recommendations, and give
advice. They’re usually happy to help — it’s part of Maui’s spirit of
aloha.
The Maui Visitors Bureau is located in Central Maui at 1727 Wili Pa
Loop, Wailuku (% 800-525-6284 or 808-244-3530; www.visitmaui.com),
but it’s not really designed as a walk-in office. Call before you leave home
to order your free Maui travel planner or check the Web site for a wealth
of useful information. The office can also offer visitor information on the
islands of Molokai and Lanai.
The Honolulu Advertiser (www.honoluluadvertiser.com) and the
Honolulu Star-Bulletin (www.starbulletin.com) are the two statewide
dailies. Maui’s own daily paper is the Maui News (www.mauinews.com).
You can also check out Maui Weekly (www.mauiweekly.com) for news.
Getting Around Maui
To really see the Valley Isle, you have to drive it yourself. Maui has only
a handful of major roads, but they all meet in a complicated web in the
island’s center, and untangling them can take some effort. Be sure to
study a good island map and know exactly where you’re going before
you set out.
Maui is growing by leaps and bounds, with new housing developments
going up in almost every direction. As a result, traffic can be challenging
at times. Try to allow yourself extra time to get where you’re going at
rush hours, especially in Central Maui and the resort areas.
Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Around 111

Navigating your rental car around the Valley Isle
If you get in trouble on Maui’s highways and you don’t have your cell-
phone with you, look for the flashing blue strobe lights on 12-foot poles;
at the base are emergency call boxes (programmed to dial 911 as soon
as you pick up the handset).
Starting out in Central Maui
Kahului, in Central Maui, is where you’ll land at the island’s major air-
port. Kahului isn’t a vacation destination, but a real town with Wal-
Marts, parking lots, malls, and so on. Still, you may occasionally find
yourself in Kahului as you head to other areas of the island because this
is where all of Maui’s highways intersect.
Kahului’s main drag is Kaahumanu (ka-ah-hoo-ma-noo) Avenue
(Highway 32). If you’re heading to the town of Wailuku, either for some
antiquing or to visit scenic Iao Valley (see Chapter 13), just follow
Kaahumanu Avenue west for about ten minutes and — voilà! — 
you’re there.
Reaching the West and South Maui resorts
If you’re heading to any of Maui’s beach resort areas, either in West Maui
or South Maui, you first have to head south through the Central Maui
corridor (often referred to as Maui’s “neck”).
To reach West Maui, you take the Kuihelani Highway (Highway 380)
south from Kahului to the Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30). The
Honoapiilani Highway actually starts in Wailuku (it meets up with the
end of Kaahumanu Avenue to make a neat inverted L) and runs directly
south to Maalaea (ma-ah-lay-ah), a windy harborfront village at the
south end of Central Maui — where you may be picking up a snorkel
cruise to Molokini or visiting the state-of-the-art Maui Ocean Center
aquarium (see Chapter 13 for details). Past Maalaea, the southbound
Honoapiilani Highway begins to follow the curve of the land, turning
abruptly west and north along the coast toward Lahaina.
West Maui’s resort communities lie directly off the Honoapiilani Highway
on the ocean side of the road. As you go from south to north, you first
reach the old whaling town of Lahaina; then Kaanapali, Hawaii’s first
master-planned beach resort; then two quiet beachfront condo commu-
nities, Kahana and Napili; and, at the end of the road, the Kapalua
Resort, a stunning manicured beauty. The road is about 30 minutes of
easy highway driving from Lahaina to Kapalua.
Be extra careful as you drive the Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30)
because the road is rather winding, and drivers who spot whales in the
channel between Maui and Lanai sometimes slam on the brakes in awe,
precipitating tie-ups and accidents.
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
112

From Kahului, you basically drive a straight shot to South Maui, the
island’s hottest, driest, and sunniest resort coast. The Mokulele
Highway (Highway 311) heads straight south across the Central Maui
corridor from Kahului to the north end of Kihei, west of the Kuihelani
Highway, Highway 380.
At the end of the Mokulele Highway, you have two choices. You can pick
up South Kihei Road, Kihei’s main drag, which is what you should take if
you’re heading to a destination in the northern portion of Kihei or if
you’re looking for a supermarket or gas station. If you’re on your way to
the southern portion of Kihei — to Wailea for a round of golf, or to
Makena, farther south, to hang out on a quiet beach or go snorkeling —
stick to the right, as the Mokulele ends, and pick up the Piilani Highway
(Highway 31), which continues south to Wailea. Near the end of the
Piilani Highway, veer right onto the coastal road to reach the Wailea
resorts or Makena.
The Mokulele Highway (Highway 311) is often the scene of crashes
involving intoxicated and speeding drivers, so be extra careful.
If you’re traveling from South Maui to West Maui, or vice versa, you
don’t need to travel all the way back to Kahului to pick up the appropri-
ate road. Highway 310 (North Kihei Road) connects the Mokulele
Highway (Highway 311, the road to South Maui) to the Honoapiilani
Highway (Highway 30, the road to West Maui), running east–west at the
south end of Maui’s “neck.”
Going Upcountry and to East Maui
The giant volcanic crater that dominates the main body of the island is
Haleakala (ha-lay-ah-ka-la), officially preserved as Haleakala National
Park. The road is only about 38 miles from Kahului to the summit of
Haleakala, but the drive takes about 90 minutes because of its curving
nature and steep ascent (to about 10,000 ft.). The drive, naturally, is
called the Haleakala Highway, which is Highway 37 as it passes through
open flatlands, past turnoffs for groovy rural towns, such as Haliimaile
(home to Haliimaile General Store, one of Maui’s finest restaurants; see
Chapter 11) and Makawao (a charming shopping stop). Then, just past
Makawao Avenue, the Haleakala Highway becomes Highway 377 — so
don’t miss the turn for it. After you pass through the little town of Kula,
turn onto Haleakala Crater Road (Highway 378), which delivers you to
the summit.
If you don’t take the Haleakala Crater Road turnoff, you continue south
on Highway 377, which soon connects up with Highway 37 again, called
the Kula Highway. If you stay on this road, it eventually takes you all the
way to Hana, the small, isolated town at the east end of the island.
But the more popular route to Hana is the Hana Highway (Highway
360), which hugs the north cliffs of Maui for about 52 miles east of
Kahului. The Heavenly Road to Hana, as it’s often called, is a winding

drive that borders on treacherous in each direction, crossing more than
50 one-lane bridges in the process. Still, the drive is one of the most
spectacular scenic drives you’ll ever take in your life. I guide you
through it, mile by mile, in Chapter 13. Even if you don’t head all the way
to Hana, consider making a visit to charming Paia (pa-ee-ah), a hip little
surf town about ten minutes east of Kahului that has two main draws:
some hip and artsy boutiques, and the best windsurfing beach in the
world, Hookipa Beach Park, which I cover in Chapter 12.
The south route to Hana — which is officially Highway 31, but most folks
call it the Kaupo (cow-po) Road — was closed at press time due to 2006
earthquake damage. If you’re interested in checking it out, check with
your hotel or rental-car company regarding potential reopening and cur-
rent road conditions. It’s usually fine if the weather has been clear, but
stay away if it’s been raining, because unpaved sections of the road can
wash out. And check with your rental-car company before you set out;
many rental contracts actually forbid customers from driving their cars
on Kaupo Road, so if you get stuck, the cost for the tow will be your
responsibility.

Chapter 9: Arriving and Getting Around 115
Getting around without wheels
Your options are limited if you’re not going to rent a car, because the
island has a limited public transportation system.
Operated by Roberts Hawaii, the Maui Bus public transit service 
(% 808-871-4838; www.co.maui.hi.us/bus) runs 11 bus routes among
Kahului, West Maui, South Maui, Paia, Haiku, and Upcountry Maui. Both
the Upcountry and Paia/Haiku routes stop at the Kahului Airport; how-
ever, keep in mind that only one medium-size suitcase is allowed per
passenger. The fare is $1 per boarding. Routes run generally from 5 a.m.
to 10 p.m., but you should call or check the online route map to figure
out your most suitable route and schedule.
Maui does have island-wide taxi service. The meter can run up fast, 
but a taxi will get you where you need to go if you don’t have your own
wheels. (See “Taking a Taxi” earlier in the chapter for more information.)
Taxis also cruise Lahaina in the evening — good to know, in case you
have an extra tipple or two and require a sober driver to take you back
to the condo.
If you’re going to skip renting a car on Maui, a good bet is to base your-
self in Lahaina, where restaurants, shops, and attractions are right at

hand. Your beach enjoyment will be limited, though, because even
though Lahaina has a beach, it’s not the greatest.
An even better alternative for auto-free visitors is basing yourself in
Kaanapali. The beach is excellent, and restaurants and shops are right at
hand in Whaler’s Village. A free resort shuttle connects hotels, golf, and
other attractions within the resort, but most of Kaanapali’s attractions
are within walking distance of one another. Ask the concierge or front
desk staff at your hotel for details on the Kaanapali Resort Shuttle,
which provides free transportation throughout the resort daily from 9
a.m. to 11 p.m.; everyone in Kaanapali is well-versed on the shuttle.
Kapalua and Wailea also have local resort shuttles that you can rely on
to transport you between destinations within the resort — to the golf
course, to local restaurants, and to resort shops. This option is, how-
ever, very limited.
If you’re coming to Maui and not renting a car, ultimately your best bet
may be to call your hotel’s concierge before you leave home. He can give
you a clear heads-up on how convenient the hotel or resort is to nearby
restaurants, shopping, and the beach, as well as what kinds of trans-
portation are readily available for you to get to other destinations on the
island. See Chapter 13, which fills you in on taking bus tours that can
pick you up and drop you off at your hotel.

Chapter 10
Checking In at Maui’s 
Best Hotels
In This Chapter
 Deciding where to stay
 Discovering a fabulous romantic getaway
 Uncovering the best family-friendly options
 Finding an affordable choice
M
aui boasts a terrific crop of resorts. But it’s such a popular desti-
nation that resort hotels and condos both can — and often do —
garner ridiculously high rack rates.
But take heart: You can find some good bargains, especially in the condo
market. I reviewed some of the best values in this chapter. You can find
additional condo options by going through one of the rental agencies
listed in Chapter 6.
In fact, Chapter 6 has lots of advice geared to help you book the hotel of
your dreams on Maui. It includes a handy overview of the various types
of lodging available on the island that can help you choose the option
that’s right for you. It also features the best money-saving strategies and
a discussion about whether to splurge on a room with a view.
You may save a bundle on Maui by purchasing an all-inclusive package
deal, especially if you’re looking for an upscale vacation. In this case,
Maui’s popularity may work in your favor: Packagers scoop up huge
numbers of Maui hotel rooms, and because they’re buying in bulk, they
can negotiate substantial price breaks — passing the savings on to you.
Of course, I can’t guarantee what the prices will be when you book, but
checking out what’s available is worth the extra effort, even if you’re
booking the rest of your vacation on your own. (Some packagers can
arrange land-only vacations if you already have your plane tickets cov-
ered.) See Chapter 5 for tips on finding the package deal that’s right for
you. An all-inclusive package can save you big bucks on accommoda-
tions and airfare alike, and sometimes car rentals and activities, too.

Maui’s Best Accommodations
In the following listings, each resort hotel, condo, or B&B name is fol-
lowed by a number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$).
Each represents the median rack-rate price range for a double room per
night, as outlined in Table 10-1. (The rack rate is the listed full price for a
hotel room.)
Table 10-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs
Symbol
Meaning
$
Cheap — less than $150
$$
Still affordable — $150–$224
$$$
Moderate — $225–$324
$$$$
Expensive but not ridiculous — $325–$449
$$$$$
Ultraluxurious — $450 or more
Don’t be scared off by the rack rates listed in these hotel reviews. You
almost never need to pay the asking price for a hotel room. Check out
Chapter 6 for tips on how to avoid paying the rack rate.
Don’t forget that the state adds 11.42 percent in taxes to your hotel bill.
Aloha Cottage
$$–$$$
Upcountry Maui
Ron and Ranjana Serle, refugees from Philadelphia who made Upcountry
Maui their permanent home some years ago, have crafted a jungle oasis on
the slopes of Haleakala for romance-seeking couples in search of a one-of-
a-kind place to stay. They’ve built two gorgeous, studio-style vacation cot-
tages on their lush Upcountry acreage, which is dense with eucalyptus,
bamboo, banana trees, and fragrant tropical blooms. Ron and Ranjana
have transported their love of Thai and Southeast Asian architecture to
the cottages — literally. The Thai Tree House is a copy of a Chiang Mai
river house, reinvented for jungle living. The spacious vaulted-ceiling cot-
tage is outfitted with imported furniture and materials. Authentic Thai
details are everywhere, from the teak floors to the kitchen cabinetry to the
carpets. The luxuriant king-size bed, with its leaded glass headboard, is
steps away from a small but comfortable sunken living room.
Your other option is the Bali Bungalow, an octagonal cottage with a rich
Balinese-detailed interior. There are some lovely details in this newer cot-
tage, including a silk bedspread, overhead skylight perfect for bedtime
stargazing, a marble shower with a dual-head shower system, and Asian-
style dining on sofas with a low table. Both beautiful cottages feature full,
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
118

well-outfitted kitchens that stock everything you need to prepare and
serve romantic meals (the Bali Bungalow’s is the larger kitchen of the two);
a large lanai with a soaking tub for two; TV with VCR; and plenty of privacy
(each cottage is a comfortable distance from the main house and the other
cottages). Really, it’s hard to get more romantic than this — perfect for
honeymooners. In fact, Ranjana can host small weddings on the idyllic
grounds, cater romantic meals for two in the Lotus House meditation cot-
tage, arrange for an in-cottage massage, or teach a private yoga session
for two (with a certified instructor); ask about these and other add-on in-
house services, if you’re interested in exploring the exotic possibilities.
See map p. 120. 1879 Olinda Rd., Makawao (5 minutes uphill from town). % 888-
328-3330 or 808-573-8500 Fax: 808-573-2551. www.alohacottage.com. Parking:
Free. Rack rates: $260–$295; $215–$230 for stays of 7 nights or more. Additional maid
service charge for stays of less than 7 nights. MC, V.
Best Western Maui Oceanfront Inn
$$–$$$$
South Maui (Kihei)
Want to stay on the beach without paying the exorbitant prices that usu-
ally tag oceanfront hotels? This well-maintained small hotel is a fine option.
Like the neighboring Mana Kai Maui (see review later in this chapter), the
Oceanfront Inn is located at the quietest south end of Kihei, just north of
ritzy Wailea, on the golden sands of Keawakapu Beach, which offers excel-
lent snorkeling and swimming. The Oceanfront Inn offers smaller rooms
and suites than the Mana Kai’s roomy apartments — making this a better
choice for couples than families — but it compensates with fresh furnish-
ings. Each smallish standard hotel room offers a queen-size Tempur-Pedic
bed, minifridge, coffeemaker, and individually controlled air-conditioning;
ceramic tile floors, plantation shutters, and ceiling fans add gentle island
flair. Each of the two-room suites has a pleasing tropical-style sitting room
and a microwave; the extra space is well worth the cost if you can afford
it. On-site Sarento’s on the Beach offers a splurge-worthy dining experi-
ence, especially for romance-seeking couples. Blue Hawaii Water Sports
offers all the water toys and dive equipment you need — including PADI-
certified instruction and boat dives — making this an excellent choice for
wallet-watching divers and snorkelers. On-site laundry adds to the con-
venience. Not fancy or spacious — don’t stay here if you’re planning to
hang out in your room — but a reasonable on-the-beach bargain.
See map p. 120. 2575 S. Kihei Rd., Kihei. % 800-263-3387 or 808-879-7744. Fax: 808-
874-0145. www.mauioceanfrontinn.com or www.bestwestern.com. Parking:
Free. Rack rates: $159–$169 double; from $395 2-room suite. Deals: Excellent oppor-
tunities for discounts, including BestRates, AAA, military discounts, and senior rates;
from $118 at press time. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.

a winning combination. Rooms are small and on the dark side, but they’re
cool, pretty, and comfortable, with modern tiled bathrooms and cof-
feemakers. Deluxe rooms also have wet bars with minifridges, and suites
add an additional Murphy bed. The quietest rooms face the garden court-
yard pool or the massive banyan tree next door. A few have harbor views
that heighten the maritime experience. Front Street–facing rooms are noisy,
but shaded and furnished lanais give you a ringside seat for the sidewalk
party. The hotel has an appealing indoor-outdoor restaurant and bar on
site; the beach is a drive away, but the town couldn’t be more convenient.
All in all, the Best Western Pioneer Inn isn’t Maui’s roomiest or quietest
place to stay, but it’s a real charmer. This is best for those who prefer walk-
able access to in-town conveniences such as dining, shopping, and nightlife.

Fairmont Kea Lani Maui
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
This fanciful Moorish palace is just as pricey as Maui’s other luxury
resorts, but it gives you so much more room for your money. Spread out
and enjoy a giant one-bedroom suite, complete with a gorgeous living
room with a full entertainment center (CD and DVD players, plus a second
TV in the bedroom); a wet bar with coffeemaker and microwave; a mam-
moth marble bathroom with a soaking tub big enough for two, double
sinks, separate shower, and terrific toiletries; and a furnished lanai that’s
ideal for an alfresco breakfast. The two- and three-bedroom villas are even
more luxurious, each boasting a gourmet kitchen; a washer and dryer; a
gas barbecue and plunge pool on the private patio; and a prime, on-the-
sand location. Amenities include three swimming pools (one for adults
only), two Jacuzzis, an excellent spa (second only to the neighboring
Grand Wailea’s), a fitness center, a full beach activities center, and a wealth
of daily activities and kids’ programs. The hotel’s excellent dining options
include the ultraromantic Nick’s Fishmarket (see p. 171). It’s a first-rate
choice on every level.

Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
I personally prefer the neighboring Fairmont or Grand Wailea, but there’s
no doubting the Four Seasons brand for a premier luxury experience.
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
126

Averaging an extra-large 640 square feet (although the Kea Lani’s suites are
even more spacious), the guest rooms here are done in soft, warm tones
and feature cushy furnishings, grand and gorgeous bathrooms (among the
best in Hawaii), and big lanais. About 80 percent have ocean views, but
beware those that overlook the driveway — it’s a real mood killer. You’re
better off with a gardenview room overlooking the lovely sculpture gardens
and waterfalls (and most of these have a bit of an ocean view anyway). The
mountainview rooms are a good value for pricey Maui, considering the
cream-of-the-crop quality of the accommodations and service. The gor-
geous grounds overflow with first-rate facilities — including the only Hawaii
branch of Wolfgang Puck’s legendary Spago restaurant (p. 176) and a sub-
lime spa offering yoga, Pilates, and a wide variety of pampering treatments.
The beach is one of Maui’s finest, and the service is exceptional. If you
prefer to lounge poolside, you can recline in comfort under a shaded
cabana or on a grassy lawn; a pool attendant will even bring you chilled
towels and spritz you with Evian if you break a sweat. Don’t be surprised if
you see Misha, Jessica, Cameron, or another big star lounging poolside —
this resort is a big-time Hollywood favorite. The kids will be duly pampered
in an excellent activities program.

Grand Wailea Resort & Spa
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
Now part of the prestigious Waldorf=Astoria collection of luxury hotels,
this palatial resort is just too glorious to deny. This monument to monied
excess won me over with its lush, art-filled grounds (boasting works by
such masters as Botero, Legér, Picasso, and Warhol) and its exclusive 
tropical-theme-park vibe. The fantastic 50,000-square-foot Spa Grande is
the island’s ultimate temple to the pampered life, whereas the pool com-
plex is Hawaii’s best water playground, a fantasy of falls, rapids, slides,
grottos, hidden hot tubs, and swim-up bars, plus the world’s only water-
powered elevator. Rooms are huge and elegantly appointed, with luxuri-
ous marble bathrooms. If you can afford it, stay in the Napua Tower; this
exclusive 100-room hotel-within-a-hotel offers personalized concierge serv-
ice plus free continental breakfast. Restaurants, shops, and lounges
abound. What’s more, both food and service are first-rate, making this
resort the place to stay if you can afford to live large. And bring the kids —
they’ll think that they’ve died and gone to heaven, especially after they
see the whopping 20,000-square-foot kids’ camp. But despite the resort’s
grandness, you’ll still feel comfortable roaming around in your beach togs.
This elegant fantasyland is an ideal place to tie the knot, too, because it’s
home to a picture-perfect seaside wedding chapel. Minimalists, on the
other hand, should book elsewhere.

Hana Oceanfront Cottages
$$$
Hana
Housed in two plantation-style buildings built by friendly California
refugees Dan and Sandi Simoni, these two marvelous one-bedroom units
are fully outfitted for Hana living. Each comes complete with a living room,
a fully appointed gourmet kitchen (no worrying about that pesky where-to-
dine problem), super-comfortable furniture (including artfully made beds),
a full bath, a TV with VCR and DVD player, a CD player, and a big lanai with
ocean views. The Beach Suite gives you a bit more space, while the Beach
Cottage gives you a bit more privacy and puts you closer to the surf. The
property boasts lush, mature tropical grounds. Best of all, paradise-like
Hamoa Beach, East Maui’s finest swimming spot — which James Michener
called “the most beautiful beach in the world” — is just steps away. Enjoy
a simply delightful place to stay, whether or not you can afford the luxuri-
ous Hotel Hana-Maui down the road. Be sure to say “hello” if you see Dan
and Sandi’s next-door neighbor (Oprah Winfrey owns the adjacent 4 acres).

Heavenly Hana Inn
$$–$$$
Hana
This gorgeous Japanese-style inn was originally built in the 1950s and com-
pletely renovated in the ’90s — with no dollar or detail spared. It’s utterly
beautiful, luxuriously comfortable, and totally serene. Every room exhibits
stunning woodwork and the impeccable taste of the innkeepers. The suites
boast sitting rooms, little lanais, big baths with deep soaking tubs, and
platform beds adorned in lavish textiles and deep, cushy futons. The two
outside acres are landscaped Japanese-style, with a bamboo fence, tiny
bridges over a meandering stream, and lava-rock paths. The $16 two-
course continental breakfast is an expanded gourmet feast served kaiseki
style, and picnic lunches and afternoon tea service can be prepared to
order with advance notice. Though the inn is impeccable, I have received
a few complaints that the innkeepers are a bit remote and the rules can
feel strict, so don’t expect a warm-and-fuzzy experience. Note that no chil-
dren under age 15 are accepted. Following Japanese and Hawaiian tradi-
tions, the owners ask that you remove your shoes when entering. A
friendly cocker spaniel and two cats live on the premises.

Hooilo House
$$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
Perched on a breezy hill above the West Maui coast is this elegant bed-
and-breakfast, coined Hooilo House by its innkeepers, who sought refuge
from the colder climes of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and chose Maui
as their ultimate escape (hooilo means “winter”). The house was built as
a bed-and-breakfast, so all of the six suites have been designed with guests
in mind. Each features a comfortable, custom, king-size bed, an extra-large
marble bathroom with a tub, a private outdoor shower lined in lava rock,
and a lanai furnished for lounging with tranquil garden or ocean views.
The house is designed and decorated Balinese-style. Practically every wall
is a window that opens to the breeze; the hallways are open-air bridges
that cross koi-filled streams, and each guest room is entered through an
imported Balinese door inlaid with mother-of-pearl that sets the mood for
something special, including such creative details as showerheads crafted
from stone-carved masks and bamboo. The owners live in an adjacent cot-
tage, so guests feel free to lounge or play a board game in the house’s
common area, which overlooks a lovely 4-foot-deep pool with panoramic
ocean views. This is the site for the morning buffet spread, which you can
enjoy at your leisure. I also like the full daily maid service, which isn’t a
given at all home-style accommodations. However, I do have a few quib-
bles: The bedrooms are a hair’s breadth smaller than I wish they were. The
outdoor shower is delightful, except when the wind kicks up and then I
wish I had a shower option indoors. In a place with this much attention to
detail, I don’t understand why the small TVs have VCRs rather than DVD
players. In a luxury B&B designed for romance, there should really be a
hot tub, as well as a pool designed for more than dipping. And I think the
innkeepers are a bit too aloof — but you may actually prefer the hands-off
approach. Still, Hooilo House is a tranquil, romantic retreat, and a con-
venient drive to beaches and the restaurants and nightlife of Lahaina. Not
suitable for children.

Hotel Hana-Maui
$$$$$
Hana
The Hotel Hana-Maui, a breathtaking oceanfront property that had lan-
guished in disrepair for too many years, was gloriously reborn a few years
ago, I’m happy to report. The same folks behind Big Sur’s amazing Post
Ranch Inn have transformed this property into one of Maui’s most magical
resorts, making it reason enough to cruise to the end of the road to Maui’s
remote eastern shore. The small hotel has just 66 rooms and suites nestled
Chapter 10: Checking In at Maui’s Best Hotels 129

in one-story Hawaiian-style cottages; its expansive and meticulously land-
scaped grounds slope gently down to glorious Hana Bay, allowing for
plenty of privacy and quiet relaxation. Both the setting and the warm-
hearted staff exude an old-Hawaii feeling. Accommodations, on the other
hand, boast only the most luxe comforts: warm and welcoming interiors
featuring indigenous island materials, textiles, and patterns. These gener-
ously apportioned units are at once designer-stylish and sigh-inducingly
comfortable. The duplex Sea Ranch cottages are the most luxurious, with
cathedral ceilings, gorgeous oversize bathrooms, and private lanais; about
half have patio Jacuzzis. But you can’t go wrong with the low-rise Bay View
suites, a little farther up the slope, if your wallet is tighter. A lack of TVs,
radios, and air-conditioning (you don’t need it out here) suits the mood
perfectly; no one travels to the end of the road in Hana to watch CNN. (The
common Club Room has a giant-screen TV and Internet access if you really
need a fix.) A wealth of marvelous outdoor activities — from cultural walks
and horseback riding to sunbathing at — will keep you content, as does
the utterly pampering and peaceful Honua Spa. The one downside is that
you may get tired of the cuisine after a time — there are no other restau-
rants in Hana besides the hotel’s own.

Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa
$$$$–$$$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
If you like the idea of a fantasy megaresort but can’t swing the price tag at
the Grand Wailea, also consider this often-less-expensive alternative,
located on 40 oceanfront acres at the quieter south end of Kaanapali
Beach. This opulent fantasyland is dotted with a riot of tropical foliage,
rushing waterfalls, sparkling lagoons, and exotic wildlife. Though not quite
as fab as the Grand Wailea’s, the half-acre pool complex is no slouch here,
either; there’s a lava tube slide and a rope bridge for the kids, and even a
man-made beach, in case the spectacular sands out front are too crowded.
The spacious guest rooms are warmly decorated in rich colors, floral
prints, and Asian accents (a welcome change from the chain-standard
beiges that often plague Hawaii resorts), and feature separate sitting areas
and furnished lanais. The Hyatt is an excellent choice for restless vaca-
tioners, because activities include a rooftop astronomy program, tennis,
world-class golf within walking distance, beach and ocean activities, and
a nightly luau complete with fire dancers. When it’s time to relax, give your-
self over to the soothing oceanfront Spa Moana (reserve your treatments
well in advance). Cascades features marvelous views and superb sushi,
while the romantic Son’z Maui at Swan Court offers innovative cuisine, an
extensive wine list, and impeccable service. Although it’s not exactly an
intimate experience — how could it be with 806 guest rooms? — it’s a very
satisfying choice nonetheless.

The Inn at Mama’s Fish House
$$
East Maui (On the Road to Hana)
These tropical cottages on one of Maui’s most gorgeous oceanfront lots
are ideal for those who want a quiet but still-central location. Nestled in a
coconut grove on secluded Kuau Cove — just a ten-minute drive from the
airport — six beautifully furnished vacation rentals feature rattan fur-
nishings, lovely local artwork, terra-cotta floors, and complete kitchens
(even dishwashers). Extras like big TVs with DVD players, CD players,
Weber gas barbecues, laundry facilities, and tons of beach toys make this
a great place to stay with friends or family. The one-bedrooms can sleep up
to four — two on the queen-size bed in the bedroom, two on the sleeper
sofa. The two-bedrooms can sleep up to six: One bedroom has a queen-
size bed, and the second has a full bed or two twin beds, plus a sleeper
sofa in the bedroom. Two-bedrooms also benefit from a prime beachfront
location, and the one-bedrooms are just steps from the beach, nestled in
colorful tropical foliage. Service is thoughtful, friendly, and efficient. The
divine Mama’s Fish House — my favorite Maui restaurant (see p. 168) —
is next door, and inn guests benefit from discounts at lunch and dinner.
Just down the road is hip-as-can-be Paia, the fun and funky surf town that
serves as the gateway to the road to Hana. The only downside? Despite
the on-the-beach location, only the luxury beachfront cottage benefits
from an ocean view.

Kaanapali Alii
$$$$–$$$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
If you want luxury living and condo conveniences, this high-rise beachfront
complex is the place for you. These condos are Maui’s finest, and they’re
well worth the high price tag. Each is privately owned, so décor varies, but
owners are held to a high standard. The one- and two-bedroom apartments
are universally large (1,500–1,900 sq. ft.); each comes with a fully equipped
gourmet kitchen, huge living room and dining room, two TVs and VCR
and/or DVD player, two full bathrooms (even in the one-bedrooms),
washer/dryer, and private lanai. The luxuriant grounds feature a fitness
room, tennis courts, a smallish heated pool with hot tub and poolside snack
service, plus a separate kids’ pool, a beach activities center, and poolside
gas grills for fun family meals. Among the resortlike amenities are daily

maid service; concierge, bell, valet, and room service; complimentary kids’
club activities in summer; yoga classes; on-the-beach cabana rentals; and
even grocery delivery and a resident tennis pro. Service is friendly and
accommodating. Best of all, the location — oceanfront at the southern end
of fabulous Kaanapali Beach — simply can’t be beat. An excellent choice on
all fronts, and one of my all-time Hawaii favorites.

Kaanapali Beach Hotel
$$–$$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
The Kaanapali Beach Hotel is the last hotel left in Hawaii that gives you a
real resort experience in this price range. It’s older, and it’s not luxurious,
but it boasts a genuine spirit of aloha that’s absent in so many other hotels.
Set beachfront around a wide, grassy lawn with a whale-shaped pool, three
low-rise wings house spacious, well-maintained rooms. They may be rather
motel-like, but they’re perfectly comfortable and feature all the conven-
iences, plus lanais overlooking the pretty yard or beach. Tiki torches, hula,
and music create an irresistible Hawaiian ambience every evening, and the
service is some of the friendliest around. An extensive Hawaiian program
goes beyond the standard hula lessons to include lauhala weaving, lei
making, and cultural tours. A kids’ program, three just-fine restaurants,
and coin-op laundry are also on-site. It’s one of my all-time favorites. Travel
+ Leisure agrees with me: The magazine has dubbed this Hawaii’s top hotel
for value, and second-best hotel in the world for less than $200 a night.
Unfortunately, rates have begun to climb, but they remain relatively afford-
able considering the excellent location and warm spirit of aloha.

Kahana Sunset
$$–$$$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
These oceanfront condos are an excellent value, one of Maui’s best. The
attractive wooden complex stair-steps down pretty terraced grounds to 
a petite but perfect swimming cove fringed with white sands. The 
apartments are roomy enough to accommodate families (especially if you
book one of the two-bedroom units, which boast two full bathrooms). Each
unit has nice island-style furniture; a complete kitchen with a dishwasher,
a microwave, and a refrigerator with an ice maker; washer/dryer; air-
conditioning and ceiling fans; a DVD player and sleeper sofa in the living

room; and a big lanai with a terrific view. Nestled between the coastline
and the road above, the complex is much more private than many on this
condo coast. On-site is a lovely heated pool and Jacuzzi, a separate kids’
pool, barbecues, and beach showers. Furthermore, daily maid service (not
a given in condos) makes it actually feel like you’re on vacation.

Koa Resort
$
South Maui (Kihei)
These unfancy but nice condos sit right across the street from the ocean
and make a good choice for active families on tight budgets. There are two
on-site tennis courts, a very nice swimming pool, a hot tub, and an 18-hole
putting green. The spacious, privately owned one-, two-, and three-bed-
room units are fully equipped and have plenty of room for even a large
clan. Each comes with a full kitchen — complete with dishwasher,
microwave, and coffeemaker — and a large lanai with ceiling fans, and
washer/dryer. The majority of two- and three-bedroom units have multi-
ple bathrooms. The smaller units have showers only, so ask for one with
a tub if it matters to you. Also, for maximum peace and quiet, ask for a unit
removed from Kihei Road.

Koa Lagoon
$$
South Maui (Kihei)
This delightful condo complex just may be the top bargain of the Kihei
coast. This midrise building has 42 units — each with a breathtaking
oceanfront setting with views that most visitors have to pay much more to
enjoy. Each large one-bedroom (700 sq. ft. plus lanai) or two-bedroom (975
sq. ft. plus lanai) apartment is nicely decorated and smartly outfitted and
includes a large, furnished lanai; a full all-electric kitchen with dishwasher
and microwave; washer/dryer; TV with VCR or DVD; a sofa bed in the living
room; and air-conditioning (not the best, but you’re unlikely to need it).
Unlimited free local calls and free high-speed Internet access are nice
pluses. On the impeccably maintained grounds, you’ll find a heated pool
and gas barbecues to share with your fellow residents — plus those won-
derful ocean views, which come alive during the day, with winter whale
sightings, and nightly year-round at the sunset hour (the building is west-
facing). Unit no. 503 is particularly popular thanks to its spectacular sight-
lines. The whole place is consistently clean and well taken care of, with
Chapter 10: Checking In at Maui’s Best Hotels 133

friendly and professional service. I also like the location at the north end
of Kihei, which is relatively quiet and convenient to the rest of the island’s
sights and attractions. All in all, one of Maui’s finest values.

Lahaina Shores Beach Resort
$$–$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
This dated but pleasant plantation-style complex of studios and one-
bedroom suites sits right on the sand at the quiet end of Lahaina, within
easy walking distance of restaurants, shopping, and entertainment, but
nicely out of the noisy fray. The hotel is more basic than stylish, but the
units are comfortable and decently outfitted, and the price is right, espe-
cially considering the on-the-beach location. Even the smallest unit is a
spacious 550 square feet. Each one comes with a fully equipped kitchen
(with microwave), a sitting and dining area, and a furnished lanai.
Obviously, those units overlooking the waves and the island of Lanai
across the channel are best, but the mountain views aren’t shabby either;
still, given the all-around good value, splurge on an ocean view if you can.
Do know, however, units are individually owned and can vary in quality;
some have been recently updated, while others need renovation attention.
When you book, inquire about the specific quality and features of your
unit. Outside is a lovely grassy lawn with a small pool, hot tub, and lounge
chairs; just beyond it is a narrow stretch of swimming beach. (First-time
surfers often learn on the low-riding waves here.) Other amenities include
on-site laundry facilities, and tennis courts just across the street. This in-
town, close-to-conveniences location is best for those wanting a good
price. Note that units can be rented through two different brokers (see the
following paragraph), so I highly recommend that you price compare.

Mana Kai Maui
$–$$
South Maui (Kihei)
Situated on a beautiful white-sand beach with excellent snorkeling, this
eight-story hotel-condo hybrid is one of my favorite affordable choices.
About half of the units are hotel rooms, which are smallish but offer great
value. The larger one- and two-bedroom apartments feature up-to-date full
kitchens, nice island-style furnishings, well-maintained bathrooms, and
open living rooms that lead to small lanais with ocean views. These are
older units, but they’re clean and comfortable, thanks to daily maid serv-
ice. A coin-op laundry is located on each floor, a restaurant and lounge is
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
134

downstairs, and a nice pool and a grassy lawn with beach chairs comple-
ment that fabulous beach. Management is friendly and conscientious. But
the Mana Kai’s real ace in the hole is its location: It lies on Wailea’s
doorstep, on the prettiest, quietest end of Kihei, away from the strip-mall
fray. Maui Yoga Path operates an open-air studio on the Mana Kai grounds,
offering daily classes by the ocean.

Mauian Napili Beach Hotel
$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
These simple studio units have a pleasing old-fashioned Hawaiian style.
The family-run Mauian is perched above a beautiful half-mile-long, white-
sand beach with great swimming and snorkeling. It has a pool with lounge
chairs, umbrellas, and tables on the sun deck, and the verdant grounds
are bursting with tropical color. The rooms feature hardwood floors,
Indonesian-style furniture, full kitchens with fridges and coffeemakers (in
most units), and big lanais with great sunset views. The rooms don’t have
phones or TVs (this place really is about getting away from it all), but the
large ohana (family) room does have a TV with a VCR and an extensive
library of videos, plus free Wi-Fi access. Complimentary coffee, coin-op
washer/dryers, and phones and fax service are available. Great restaurants
are just a five-minute walk away, and Kapalua Resort is up the street. All in
all, this is an excellent beachfront choice for the price.

Maui Coast Hotel
$$
South Maui (Kihei)
This affordable hotel is recommended for its good package deals, and its
central (if rather less-than-pretty) location, about a block from the beach
and a short walk away from restaurants, shopping, and nightlife. This isn’t
the Four Seasons, so don’t expect luxury — but the clean, modest rooms
feature good-value extras, including sitting areas, coffeemakers,
minifridges, Nintendo game systems, and furnished lanais. The one-room
alcove suites are a bit larger; each has a separate sitting area with a cafe
table and chairs for enjoying your morning coffee. Add a fairly good restau-
rant, room service, free use of laundry facilities, a nice pool (plus one for
the kids) with poolside service, two Jacuzzis, a restaurant, and tennis

courts (with lights for night play), and you end up with a full-service hotel
at a bargain price. The suites offer families excellent value, especially if
you can find a package to suit you.

Maui Guest House
$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
This appealing and professionally run bed-and-breakfast is an excellent
value and offers more amenities than many of the “full-service” hotels just
down the road in Kaanapali. The spacious home offers four guest accom-
modations, all mostly suited to couples looking for romance at a budget rate.
All rooms have queen beds (three have an extra twin bed if you’re traveling
with a child or a friend), plus a private bathroom, a large plasma TV with
DVD player, air-conditioning, a fridge, and — the crowning glory — a private
lanai with its own private Jacuzzi. You’re welcome to make yourself at
home throughout the house, which boasts parquet floors, floor-to-ceiling
windows, a large and lovely swimming pool with comfortable lounging
chairs and a hammock, a well-outfitted kitchen and barbecue grill for your
use, a 300-plus DVD library, and laundry facilities (no quarters needed).
The house even has a wireless network throughout for laptop toters, plus
a computer you can use if you just want to check your e-mail once or twice
during your trip. A generous continental breakfast is laid out each day, and
the owners can help you arrange just about every island activity. The near-
est beach is about a block away. Here you’ll enjoy a clean, quiet, and
utterly charming place to stay.

Maui Spa Retreat
$$
Upcountry Maui
Boasting a majestic perch on the slopes of Haleakala, this hidden gem can
reward you with one of the finest spa days you’ll ever enjoy, as well as a
comfortable place to stay. The sloping property is a beautifully manicured
aromatherapy farm, and the proprietor blends all her own body scrubs,
wraps, and healing oils from the garden for use during the spa treatments.
There are two simple, charming cottages to rent for a complete Upcountry
experience. Best is the spacious one-bedroom, two-story cottage, which
features a comfortable and nicely furnished living room, a fully equipped
kitchen with gorgeous koa cabinetry, a king-size Tempur-Pedic bed in the
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
136

upstairs bedroom, a nicely outfitted bathroom, and sensational views from
both levels. Up to four guests can be accommodated on futons in the living
room. A petite, octagonal-shaped, studio-style cottage is also available for
rent. This unit features a king bed, a nice studio-style kitchen with granite
countertops, a dining area for two, a TV with DVD player, a rustic but pleas-
ant bathroom with an open shower, and a nicely furnished deck where you
can enjoy a morning cup of Hawaii’s famous Kona coffee. Since this is a
vacation rental, no breakfast is provided, and services are minimal, but
the cottages are well outfitted and nicely maintained. On-site is a saltwater
lap pool and a hot tub, both with panoramic views. Restaurants are just a
short drive down the hill in Makawao, and beaches are another 15 min-
utes beyond that. You’ll truly be away from civilization at this pleasant get-
away. Check the Web site for details on spa packages available.

Napili Bay
$–$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
This excellent bargain sits on Napili’s beautiful, half-mile white-sand beach.
This small, two-story complex is perfect for an affordable romantic get-
away; the sound of the waves creates a comfortable and relaxing atmos-
phere. The studio apartments are definitely small, but still, you have a full
kitchen (with fridge and coffeemaker), a queen-size bed, a queen-size
sleeper sofa that lets you sleep two more (if you don’t mind lots of togeth-
erness), a TV with DVD, a CD player, and a spacious lanai where you can
sit and watch the sun set. Each unit is individually owned, so furnishings
can vary, but the quality is consistently good. Louvered windows and ceil-
ing fans keep the units cool during the day. You have plenty of restaurants
and a convenience store within walking distance, and you’re about 10 to
15 minutes away from Lahaina and some great golf courses. Coin-op
washer/dryers and a barbecue are nice features. The beach right out front
is one of the best on the coast, with great swimming and snorkeling right
at your door. Book early, because this place fills up fast. Note that you have
two sources for booking: Maui Beachfront Rentals and Aloha Condos both
allow you to book directly through the owners. Both Web sites feature pic-
tures of available units so you can choose the one you like. If your idea of
paradise does not include being unplugged from e-mail or the Internet, be
aware that only a few units have high-speed Internet access, so ask for one
if you want it.

Napili Kai Beach Resort
$$$–$$$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
Make yourself right at home at this complex of bright one- and two-story
units embracing its own wonderful white-sand snorkeling beach. There are
a handful of basic hotel rooms with minifridges and coffeemakers, but
most units have lovely tropical-modern décor, large lanais, DVD players,
and kitchenettes (all with microwave, some with dishwasher). The one-
bedrooms have sleeping accommodations in both rooms — usually a king-
size bed in one room, two twin beds in the other — making this a great
configuration for families; some even have a second bathroom. The two-
bedroom units can sleep as many as six or seven, and all have a second
bathroom. The Khaka suites unite two or three adjoining hotel rooms or
studios in one value-priced package for families or shares. Most, but not
all, units offer air-conditioning, so ask if you want it (you’ll need it only in
summer); otherwise, ceiling fans do the trick. The complex has a restau-
rant and bar with a great view; however, I’ve heard too many complaints
that it’s overpriced for what you get, and most guests don’t dine here more
than once. The beach pagoda serves daytime snacks and drinks and doles
out snorkel gear for your free use. You also get daily maid service, four
pools and a hot tub, barbecues, a fitness room, an 18-hole putting green,
and a basic spa. During family seasons (Easter/spring break, summer, and
Christmas), kids 6 to 10 can enjoy the supervised Keiki Club, with two
hours of activities daily (except Sun), plus Wednesday-night movies. All in
all, a nice place to stay, if not a bargain.

Noelani Condominium Resort
$–$$
West Maui (Kahana/Napili)
I stand by all my recommendations, but that doesn’t mean I don’t get a
teensy bit nervous when my boss says that she’s going to take me up on
one. So I was thrilled when she came home from Maui confirming my own
observations — that this top-notch oceanfront condo is a stellar value and
a great place to stay. All the well-maintained apartments sport kitchens,
VCRs, ceiling fans (no air-conditioning), and spectacular ocean views; all
but the studios have dishwashers and washer/dryers, too (self-service
laundry facilities are available for studio dwellers). Best is the Antherium
building, where apartments have ocean-facing lanais just 20 feet from the
surf. Concierge and midweek maid service, two freshwater pools (one
heated for night swimming), and an oceanfront Jacuzzi round out the good
value. You’re invited to a continental breakfast orientation on the first day
of your stay. Don’t miss mai tai parties in the evenings; oceanfront barbe-
cues are ideal for family outings. Next door is a sandy cove that’s popular
with snorkelers, but you may find yourself driving to a prettier beach — at

The Old Wailuku Inn at Ulupono
$$
Central Maui (Wailuku)
If you’re charmed by the notion of old-time Hawaii, book into this 1920s
home, located in the historic town of Wailuku. Innkeepers Tom and Janice
Fairbanks have restored the house (a cross between Craftsman and plan-
tation style) very nicely, although a few negatives — such as yellow safety
tape on the hardwood stairs — undermine the ambience. Janice has used
her impeccable eye to fill the home with island-style bamboo and Asian
antiques. Each of the seven guest rooms in the main house is decorated
with a Hawaiian heirloom quilt and top-quality everything, including an
oversize luxury bathroom; unfortunately, housekeepers took the gorgeous
quilt off the bed the first time they made up my room, folded it inside out
and stored it for the duration of my week’s stay, so I never got to enjoy it.
Though the bathrooms are large, they tend to lack storage space. Still, the
furnishings are oversize, cushy, and invite you to kick back and make your-
self at home.
Three units occupy a modern annex called the Vagabond’s House (named
to honor Don Blanding, the “vagabond poet laureate” of Hawaii). Sig Zane,
Hawaii’s premier fabric designer, created custom linens inspired by
Hawaiian flowers for each of these wonderful rooms. These units are a
better option for light sleepers, because noise can travel a bit in the main
house. The beach is a drive away, but the central location puts Maui within
easy reach — plus, for people in an acquisitive mood, Wailuku is lined with
antiques shops.

West Maui (Lahaina)
Run by Outrigger, the value-minded, Hawaii-based hotel chain, this well-

when you can score a good deal (which you usually can). The newly rede-
veloped property offers petite studios and more spacious one- and two-bed-
rooms with fresh, contemporary island-style décor that is more attractive
than you might expect; Outrigger did a very nice job here. Studios have a
microwave and minifridge; all other units have fully outfitted kitchens. All
Chapter 10: Checking In at Maui’s Best Hotels 139

units have lush garden views, air-conditioning, and video games. The one-
and two-bedroom apartments have dishwashers, sofa beds and their own
washer/dryers. Note that bathrooms have showers only, no tubs. The well-
manicured grounds feature barbecues, a hot tub, and a nice pool. The larger
units are perfect for families; your kids will love the heart-of-Lahaina loca-
tion, and you’ll appreciate the tranquil ambience that results from a peace-
ful side-street location (a rarity in Lahaina). The complex is generally very

Outrigger Maui Eldorado Resort
$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
These spacious condos — all with full kitchens, washer/dryers, and daily
maid service — were built back in the good old days when land in
Kaanapali was cheap, contractors took pride in their work, and visitors
expected spacious accommodations with views from every window. It may
be of late-’60s vintage, but the Outrigger chain keeps quality and mainte-
nance high. This resort is a wonderful choice for families, with big, comfy
units, grassy areas that are perfect for running off all that excess kid
energy, and a shoreline that’s usually safe for swimming. Three pools, bar-
becue areas, shops, and a coin-op laundry round out the appeal.

Discounts also available for seniors and military personnel. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Outrigger Palms at Wailea
$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
This villa-style apartment complex is a very nice choice if a sunny Wailea
location appeals to you, but you just don’t want to shell out for one of
those ridiculously expensive resorts. The smart and pleasing complex
boasts contemporary Southwestern-style buildings spread over tidy
greens. The modern apartments are well-furnished and feature all the
expected amenities, including a fully outfitted kitchen, furnished lanai,
VCR, and washer/dryer. On-site is a very nice pool and hot tub, and cham-
pionship Wailea golf and tennis facilities are right at hand. Daily maid serv-
ice and concierge-style desk service are part of the package. The only
downsides are that it’s about a 10- to 15-minute walk to a good swimming

beach, and air-conditioning is in the master bedroom only; you’ll have to
pay extra for a portable unit in the other spaces. You won’t normally need
it, but it can get warm in summer. The elegant, open-air Shops at Wailea is
also a short walk away.

Plantation Inn
$$–$$$
West Maui (Lahaina)
This charming Victorian-style hotel in the heart of Lahaina offers both in-
town convenience and old-fashioned romance. It’s actually of 1990s vin-
tage, but modern extras like soundproofing (a plus in downtown Lahaina),
VCRs, fridges (a few have kitchenettes), and private bathrooms (some with
shower only) don’t detract from the period appeal. Deluxe rooms in the
Lanai category are the way to go for romance-seeking couples, because
this is where the décor really starts to have distinctive detail and person-
ality; tell the reservationist your tastes and she’ll likely be able to match
you with one that best suits your style. The lower-category rooms are a
bit more budget-basic. The inn wraps around a nice, large tiled pool and
deck with a hot tub. On-site are coin-op laundry facilities and Gerard’s, a
top-notch French restaurant. The staff is excellent. You’ll have to drive to
a good beach, but Lahaina Harbor is a walk away (great for early-morning
snorkel cruises). Guests here have full privileges at the Kaanapali Beach
Hotel, a sister property reviewed earlier in this section. Not perfect, but a
good choice for travelers who want both wallet-friendly rates and accom-
modations with personality.

Punahoa Beach Apartments
$$
South Maui (Kihei)
With the best location in Kihei, this friendly little complex is a bona fide
beachfront bargain. The setting — off noisy, traffic-congested Kihei Road,
on a quiet side street that faces the ocean — is fabulous: A grassy lawn
extends down to the sand, where great offshore snorkeling awaits, and a
popular surfing spot sits just next door. A coin-op laundry is on-site, and
markets and restaurants are but a stroll away. The apartments aren’t fancy,
but they’re nicer than you’d expect for the money; each has a fully
equipped kitchen and a lanai with great ocean views. Studios have

Murphy-style queen-size beds, one-bedrooms have king beds, and corner-
unit two-bedrooms have a queen-size bed in the master and twin beds in

Making yourself at home: Condos
Condominium apartments are some of Maui’s most appealing and cost-effective
accommodations options. They’re outfitted like a full-service home and can accom-
modate anywhere from two to eight vacationers in one, two, or three bedrooms. Even
couples enjoy the extra space and home-style amenities.
Well-developed Maui abounds with condo developments. I review my favorites in this
chapter, but there are more. Real-estate agencies tend to manage individual units
throughout an area’s assorted complexes. Expand your choices by contacting one of
the following agencies, which can match you with the unit that meets your needs and
budget.
In addition to those already listed — including the Kaanapali Alii, ResortQuest at the
Maui Banyan, and The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach, just to name a few — a number
of booking agencies offer one-stop shopping for condo rentals all over the island.
The Hawaii Condo Exchange (% 800-442-0404 or 323-436-0300; www.hawaiicondo
exchange.com) is a Southern California–based agency that acts as a consolidator
for condo properties throughout the islands, including a number of excellent choices
on Maui. The Exchange works to match you up with the place that’s right for you and
tries to get you a good deal.
For a complete selection of upscale condos throughout sunny, luxury-minded 
Wailea, contact Destination Resorts Hawaii (% 866-384-1365 or 808-891-6249; www.
destinationresortshi.com). Destination Resorts generally handles first-class
one-, two-, and three-bedroom condos boasting deluxe amenities, including daily maid
service, concierge service, grocery delivery service, and preferential rates at the
area’s first-class tennis facilities and championship golf courses. Prices start as low
as $225 for a one-bedroom. Value-added packages, such as fifth-night-free and car-
condo deals, are available regularly.
Destination Resorts’s Wailea Beach Villas (% 866-901-5207 or 808-891-4500; www.
waileabeachvillas.com) have set a new standard for condominium luxe on
Maui. Since around June 2006, these 98 glorious villas and penthouses blend luxuri-
ous, home-style comforts with first-class resort services (even fully stocked kitchens
and personal chef services) and a wonderful Wailea Beach location. Rates run $880

ResortQuest at the Maui Banyan
$$–$$$
South Maui (Kihei)
Skip the standard hotel rooms, if you can, and go straight for a condo 
unit — which offers much more value for your dollar — at this very nice
apartment-like complex situated across Kihei Road from Kamaole (kam-a-
oh-lay) Beach Park II. The roomy, open-plan one- and two-bedroom units
are all decently outfitted and well maintained; a few three-bedroom units
Chapter 10: Checking In at Maui’s Best Hotels 143
to $3,000 nightly for the 1,900- to 3,100-square-foot residences, with a five-night mini-
mum stay.
If you like the sound of the tranquil Kapalua resort but the Ritz-Carlton is out of your
price range (or your style), consider renting an elegant condo or vacation home at
Kapalua Villas (% 800-545-0018, 800-227-6054 or 808-665-5400; www.kapalua
villas.com). Nightly rates range from $279 for a one-bedroom apartment with a
fairway view to $759 for an oceanfront two-bedroom apartment — not bad, consid-
ering you enjoy the same delicious perks and spectacular views of your much-higher-
paying neighbors (including Kelsey Grammer, who owns his own Kapalua spread).
The three- to five-bedroom freestanding luxury vacation homes run from $1,700 to
$7,500 nightly. Whether you go large or small, you’re sure to be pleased with your first-
class accommodations.
Bello Realty (% 800-541-3060 or 808-879-3328; www.bellomauivacations.com)
represents affordable condos throughout the Kihei/Wailea area, with prices starting
as low as $99 in the low season and $115 in the high season. I’ve received plenty of
good feedback from vacationers who’ve used Bello and come away with an excel-
lent beachfront bargain and good service results, so I’m quite confident about the
quality and values that Bello offers. Be sure to check out Koa Resort and Koa Lagoon,
two of Maui’s best bargains (reviewed earlier in this chapter).
Condominium Rentals Hawaii (% 800-367-5242 or 808-879-2778; www.crhmaui.
com) has moderately priced condos throughout Maui, with a concentration in Kihei,
and handles the Mana Kai (reviewed earlier in this chapter). The car-and-condo pack-
ages and other regular specials can really add to the value of these units.
You can choose from a range of good-value apartments along West Maui’s condo
coast through Maui Beachfront Rentals (% 888-661-7200 or 808-661-3500; www.maui
beachfront.com). The best deal for budget-minded couples is at the Napili Bay,
which start out between $145 and $167. Two of my favorite Kaanapali Beach condo
complexes are The Whaler and Kaanapali Alii (reviewed earlier in this chapter). Ask
about packages that include a free night or a rental car.
You can cut out the middleman and rent directly from the owner at a number of qual-
ity condo resorts on Maui, including the terrific Napili Bay, The Whaler, and a few
other good-quality condo resorts, by visiting Aloha Condos Hawaii (www.aloha
condos.com), a cooperative of owner-managed units.
Most companies that offer all-inclusive travel packages to Maui can book you into
any number of condos, as can your travel agent. See Chapter 5 for details on booking
a pay-one-price travel package.

are also available. They’ve all feature contemporary island-style furniture,
full kitchens with microwave, washer/dryers, and furnished lanais. Light
daily maid service is included, and two pools, tennis courts, and a Jacuzzi
are on-site. The building sits perpendicular to the coast, so partial ocean
views are the best you can do; most upper units overlook the parking
structure or the building next door. Still, this complex is a good value,
especially if you can score one of the many price breaks.
ResortQuest offers a number of additional good choices in West Maui and
Kihei, in South Maui, for travelers looking for reasonably priced accom-
modations. For information on additional choices, call % 877-997-6667 or

Ritz-Carlton Kapalua
$$$$$
West Maui (Kapalua)
Situated at the end of the road in glorious Kapalua, Maui’s most gorgeous
planned community, the Ritz is a destination resort by virtue of its location
alone. But you won’t need to hop in the car every day in search of fun,
because everything is right at hand: a small but fabulous beach and activ-
ities galore, including Kapalua’s 54 holes of world-class, tournament-
quality golf, as well as its justifiably renowned art school for vacationers
who want to feed a creative appetite. The natural setting — on 50 terraced
oceanfront acres, surrounded by century-old Norfolk pines and ironwood
trees — is breathtaking.
Thanks to a multimillion-dollar renovation completed in early 2008, the
hotel is more glorious than ever. Designed to look like a grand plantation
house, it’s airy and graceful, with a gracious pool area, two hot tubs, and a
professional croquet lawn. The spacious and tropically gorgeous rooms
surpass the chain’s usual high standard with heavenly featherbeds, extra-
large marble bathrooms and gorgeous island-inspired décor. The dining is
excellent, especially the superb sushi bar, Kai, and the gorgeous, Asian-
inspired Banyan Tree restaurant). The amenities are extensive (including a
full-service spa that was dramatically expanded and upgraded as part of
the renovation, a new state-of-the-art fitness center, the outstanding Ritz
Kids program as well as an environmental education center for kids and
teens, and a full-time cultural advisor who imbues the service and pro-
gramming with genuine respect for the culture), and the service is unsur-
passed. Still, some may find it a tad too formal for Hawaii. Furthermore, you
might expect an on-the-beach location for these prices, but the hotel is 
situated slightly uphill. You may find it worthwhile to spend a few extra dol-
lars for a club-level room; club guests enjoy individualized concierge 
service and five — yes, five — complimentary food presentations

Sheraton Maui
$$$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
This expansive resort hotel boasts the ideal location on Kaanapali Beach:
on a spectacular stretch of sand at the foot of Black Rock, one of Maui’s
best offshore snorkel spots. Much like its Kauai sister, this Sheraton is
great for those who don’t care for the forced formality or over-the-top
excesses that often go hand-in-hand with resort vacations. The Sheraton
Maui has an easygoing, open style, and great facilities for families and
active types, including a nice fitness center and an open-air spa. The
lagoonlike pool features lava-rock waterways, wooden bridges, and an
open-air whirlpool. You’re greeted with a lei upon arrival, and then the
valet takes you and your luggage straight to your room so you don’t need
to stand in line — a smooth, personalized touch. The big, island-style
rooms are attractive and comfortable, with such nice features as the aptly
named Sheraton SweetSleeper bed, flat-panel TVs, minifridges, coffee-
makers, and private lanais. Building 6 is the place to be during whale-watch
season; the rooms directly overlook one of the whales’ favorite playpens.
A class of oversized two-room Ohana suites is designed with families in
mind; the junior suites can also suit families well, or make a great splurge
for couples looking for room to spread out in luxury. Restaurants and bars
(including the fun and flavorful Teppan-yaki Dan’s for Japanese hibachi-
style dining), a nightly torch-lighting and cliff-diving show, a terrific year-
round kids’ program, a spa, tennis courts, and lots of other extras further
the appeal, and the location just can’t be beat. A terrific hotel from start
to finish — it’s no surprise that this was Sheraton’s North American “Hotel
of the Year” in 2007.

Wailea Beach Marriott Resort & Spa
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
This appealing property has an airy, comfortable feel, and it’s looking
better than ever after a $60-million total renovation was completed in 2006.
Eight buildings, all low-rise except for an eight-story tower, are thought-
fully spread over 22 gracious acres, with lots of open parklike space and a
half-mile of prime oceanfront. The spacious guest rooms have all been
completely redecorated with a sleeker and more elegant look. There’s a
comprehensive kids’ program for keiki ages 5 to 13, plus five pools —
including a kid-friendly water-activities playground complete with a pair of
water slides — and a terrific beach out front. A good indoor/outdoor
restaurant and nightly Hawaiian entertainment, a coin-op laundry, a fitness
center, and the full-service Mandara Spa and salon make life easier for the
grown-ups in your group, too. My biggest complaint is that the resort fee
is too high, and it irks me to have to pay extra to access the Internet —
but if you leave your computer at home, you won’t notice.

Westin Maui Resort & Spa
$$$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
This hotel isn’t quite as fabulous as the Grand Wailea (reviewed earlier in
this chapter), but it’s often cheaper, and your kids will be in water-hog
heaven here, too, thanks to an 87,000-square-foot “Aquatic Playground,”
complete with swim-through grottos, waterfalls, and a 128-foot water slide.
(There’s also an adults-only pool and a secluded Jacuzzi.) Rooms are on the
smallish side, but they’re stylishly contemporary in the W Hotels mode.
Each and every one boasts a truly celestial Heavenly Bed, which keeps me
coming back to Westin every time. The Heavenly Shower adds to the luxury
in the bathroom, while your youngest ones can enjoy Westin’s own plush-as-
can-be Heavenly Cribs. A prime stretch of Kaanapali Beach and a wealth of
facilities are on hand, including a well-outfitted fitness center with an array
of classes, a gorgeous 13,000-square-foot spa, and a full children’s program.
The stylish Tropica restaurant isn’t the best on Maui, but the innovative fare
is just fine, and the oceanfront setting is designer-sleek and romantic at the
same time. Beware the timeshare salesperson in the lobby — and if you get
suckered in, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

The Whaler on Kaanapali Beach
$$$–$$$$$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
Not only would I stay at this beachfront midrise condo complex again, but
I’d move in here if I could. The Whaler was built in the ’70s and still sports
a few “Me Decade” hallmarks, but in a good way — it feels like the kind of
place where Jack Lord would keep his neighbor island bachelor pad. The
relaxing atmosphere starts in the clean-lined open-air lobby and contin-
ues in the impeccably kept apartments. They’re privately owned and indi-
vidually decorated, but all have fully equipped kitchens, VCRs, marble
bathrooms, and big, blue-tiled lanais. Many one-bedrooms have two full
bathrooms, making them great for small families or shares. Most units
have some kind of ocean view, but the garden views are also pleasant.
Luxuries include daily maid service, plus bell and concierge services. The
grounds are private and well-manicured, and on-site extras include an
oceanfront pool and spa, five tennis courts, an exercise room, and great
dining and shopping at neighboring Whalers Village. Both property man-
aging agents are reliable, so go with the best rate; I often find that
ResortQuest has the best deals.

Dining Out around Maui
In This Chapter
 Choosing among Maui’s best restaurants
 Finding the finest luaus if you’re in the hula mood
M
aui’s dining scene is excellent, with amazing scope and innova-
tion. The lovely and charismatic Valley Isle has attracted so many
top chefs from around the globe that it’s tough to choose among their
outposts. But be prepared to pay for the privilege of dining on Maui. The
island is overflowing with restaurants, so choice isn’t a problem — but
you have to navigate a minefield of overpriced, mediocre-quality restau-
rants in order to get value for your dollar. The listings in this chapter
offer a recommendable course of action, whether you’re looking for a
splurge-worthy special-occasion restaurant or a satisfying casual meal
that relieves the pressure on your wallet.
Lahaina, on Maui’s west shore, sits at the heart of the island’s dining
scene. Luckily, it’s quite convenient — no more than a half-hour drive or
so from any of the beach resorts (45 minutes from Wailea). Many of its
restaurants — even the affordable ones — boast front-row, on-the-water
seats for spectacular sunset-watching. But nowhere is the minefield of
mediocrity more explosive, so choose carefully.
Chapter 18 gives you a fun and easy overview of Maui’s dining scene,
with tips on local specialties and the astounding variety of seafood on
island menus.
Maui’s Best Restaurants
In the restaurant listings that follow, each restaurant name is followed by
a number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). The dollar
signs are meant to give you an idea of what a complete dinner for one
person — with appetizer, main course, a drink, tax, and tip — is likely to
cost. The price categories are outlined in Table 11-1.

Table 11-1
Key to Restaurant Dollar Signs
Dollar Sign(s)
Price Range
$
Cheap eats — less than $20
$$
Still inexpensive — $20–$34
$$$
Moderate — $35–$49
$$$$
Pricey — $50–$74
$$$$$
Ultraexpensive — $75 or more
Of course, how much you spend depends on how you order, so stay
away from the surf and turf or the north end of the wine list if you’re
watching your wallet. To give you a better idea of how much you can
expect to spend, I also include the price range of main courses in the
listings. (Prices can change at any time, of course, but restaurants usu-
ally don’t raise their prices by more than a dollar or two at any given
time.)
The state adds roughly 4 percent in taxes to every restaurant bill. The
percentage may vary slightly depending on the county you’re in, and
may be embedded in the total purchase price or shown as an independ-
ent line item on your bill. A 15 percent to 20 percent tip for the server is
standard, just like back home.
At the end of the chapter, I index the restaurants in three different ways:
by location, cuisine, and price. Also, use the maps in this chapter to get
a more specific fix on where each restaurant is located in relation to
your accommodations.
Aloha Mixed Plate
$
West Maui (Lahaina)
LOCAL HAWAIIAN
This charming, cheap patio restaurant specializes in traditional pan-cultural
foods of Hawaii: great saimin (ramen noodle soup), teriyaki chicken, finger-
lickin’ Korean-style kalbi barbecue ribs, coconut shrimp, mahimahi sand-
wiches, stir-fry, and other local staples, plus burgers (both taro and beef)
and a kalua pig sandwich. Succulent roast duck, stir-fry, and chow fun
noodle dishes reveal the Chinese influence. Most dishes are served as com-
plete meals (a style called plate lunch), accompanied by “two scoop” rice
and a scoop of macaroni salad; they can be ordered mini, regular, or sumo-
size to customize to your appetite. Brought to you by the people behind
the Old Lahaina Luau (the top luau in the islands, described later in this
chapter), this colorful place serves up the best local food around. Don’t
expect gourmet — this is Hawaii’s version of paper-plate eats, and the set-
ting is super-casual but island colorful and friendly. Aloha Mixed Plate offers
real value — and in an oceanfront setting to boot! The restaurant even has

your hearty meal with an ice-cold beer, as long as you take a seat on the

Café des Amis
$–$$
Central Maui (Paia)
MEDITERRANEAN AND INDIAN
This charming indoor/outdoor cafe in the heart of Paia town is a local
favorite; at least three islanders recommended it to me in the course of
my recent visit to Maui. I can see why: Café des Amis delivers a satisfying
trifecta of quality, creativity, and value. It’s casual indoors, with a baker’s
counter and colorful chalkboard menus on the walls, plus a lovely outdoor
seating area alongside. The menu is an interesting cross-section of
Mediterranean and Indian cuisines; Indian curries reside alongside Greek
salads, Italian antipasti, and crepes, making for a small but highly satisfy-
ing menu. The morning starts with both egg and sweet crepes. Lunchtime
brings savory crepes, such as ham and gruyere, or brie and avocado with
apple and black pepper; flavorful Indian curries with beef and mushrooms,
chicken, or mahimahi for an island flair; and a bountiful Mediterranean
plate, with such goodies as house-made hummus, olives, feta, and fresh
pita bread with a variety of salads and dips. The beverage menu runs the
gamut from smoothies in Indian lassi yogurt drinks to wine and beer.
Service is attentive and friendly.

Capische
$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
MEDITERRANEAN-ITALIAN
Nestled in a little-known hilltop resort that caters largely to Japanese
guests, this dreamy hideaway is one of Maui’s true hidden gems. Capische
boasts majestic coastal vistas, an ultraromantic ambience, and service
that’s both friendly and professional. The menu showcases the culinary
delights of the Mediterranean. Book a table on the lanai or the lovely
alfresco terrace, and come for sunset to maximize the views and your
enjoyment. I find the starters to be the stars of the menu; begin with the
delectable quail saltimbocca wrapped in apple-smoked bacon, the to-die-
for kabocha pumpkin gnocchi in sage brown butter, or a garden-fresh cap-
rese salad of buffalo mozzarella, sweet baby basil, and local Kula tomatoes.
Follow with a seafood-rich cioppino, a gorgonzola-crusted filet mignon
with Maui onion jus, or one of the delightful daily specials. A pianist often
adds to the ambience, sometimes accompanied by a sultry jazz singer.
There’s also a sexy martini lounge if you’re in the mood for something
Chapter 11: Dining Out around Maui 155

shaken or stirred. Winner of the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence for four
years running, Capische also received Chef of the Year for owner-chef Brian
Etheredge and Most Romantic restaurant kudos from readers of the Maui
No Ka Oi magazine in 2008. This really is the most romantic spot on Maui.
If you’re in the mood for the ultimate splurge, consider a private dining,
personal chef and wine pairing experience at Il Teatro at Capische; call for
details.

Casanova
$$–$$$
Upcountry Maui
ITALIAN
Located in the cowboy-boutique town of Makawao, Casanova is a spa-
cious, casual spot with great Italian food and music beloved by both locals
and visitors looking for something different. Look for a tiny veranda with
a few stools next to a deli at Makawao’s busiest intersection. The restau-
rant contains a stage, dance floor, and long bar; it’s the setting for some of
Maui’s liveliest nightlife (see Chapter 15 for details).
The pasta is homemade, and the selections are first-rate — try the zesty
spaghetti fra diavolo, the spinach gnocchi in a fresh tomato–Gorgonzola
sauce, or the tagliolini al salmone (thin pasta sautéed in a saffron cream
sauce with naturally smoked salmon, leeks, and green peas). Other choices
include a huge and satisfying pizza selection, both traditional and creative;
grilled lamb chops in a porcini mushroom marinade; Cornish game hen
marinated in citrus, grilled under a brick, and served with fresh Kula-
grown veggies; nightly fish specials with an Italian flair; and Maui’s best
tiramisu. It’s easy to modulate your bill depending on how you order. The
pleasant deli serves soups, salads, hot panini, pizza by the slice, pastries,
espresso, and that terrific tiramisu all day, for eat in or take out.
See map p. 125. 1188 Makawao Ave. (at Baldwin Avenue), Makawao. % 808-572-

11:30 a.m.–2 p.m. and 5:30–9:30 p.m., Sun 5:30–9:30 p.m.; deli daily 7:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Charley’s Restaurant & Saloon
$–$$
Central Maui (Paia)
AMERICAN/INTERNATIONAL
Before I set out on any drive to Hana, I always make time for a hearty break-
fast at Charley’s (which was named after the owner’s Great Dane). This
casual restaurant is my favorite breakfast place on Maui, thanks to over-
stuffed breakfast burritos, fluffy omelets, macadamia-nut pancakes, and
eggs Benedict with perfectly puckery hollandaise. Lunch and dinner bring
burgers, kiawe-smoked ribs and marlin, calzones baked fresh to order, and
a variety of vegetarian delights, from veggie lasagna to bounteous salads
and stir-fry. Expect nothing in the way of ambience, but service is friendly
and prices are low, making Charley’s worth the half-hour drive from Kihei,
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
156

for an affordable and unpretentious meal, even if you’re not heading to
Hana. The adjacent roadhouse-style bar serves up a good selection of
microbrews.

Cheeseburger in Paradise/Cheeseburger Island Style
$–$$
West Maui (Lahaina)/South Maui (Wailea)
AMERICAN
This oceanfront burger joint (not affiliated with singer Jimmy Buffett’s
mainland chain, but with sister locations in Waikiki) is a perennial favorite
thanks to an always-lively atmosphere, consistently good food, and 
million-dollar views, all at bargain-basement prices. At the original Lahaina
location — the first in the burgeoning minichain — the second-level open-
air room offers a prime ocean view from every seat. The Wailea outpost is
set back farther from the surf, but an upstairs location gives it its own ter-
rific ocean vistas, and the retro-hip décor sets just the right mood. No
matter which location you choose, the tropical-style burgers are big, juicy
mounds of natural Angus beef, served on fresh-baked buns and guaran-
teed to satisfy. Chili dogs, fish and chips, crispy onion rings, and spiced
fries broaden the menu. Dieters and vegetarians can opt for the excellent
garden and tofu burgers, a lean chicken breast sandwich, or a meal-size
salad. Two full bars boast a festive, first-rate menu of tropical drinks
(including one of the best piña coladas in the islands). There’s lively music
every night to round out the party-hearty appeal at both locations. You
can even launch your day oceanside with hearty omelets, French toast,
eggs Benedict, and other morning faves. Beware: The Lahaina location has
been plagued by a report or two of uneven food and service of late.

Cilantro Fresh Mexican Grill
$
West Maui (Lahaina)
MEXICAN
Cilantro Grill promises “a fresh take on Old Mexico,” and delivers at incred-
ible prices. Here’s living proof that fast food doesn’t have to be unhealthy
and overprocessed. Chef Paris Nabavi has re-created authentic recipes
from Mexico’s heartland, and reinvented them with local island ingredi-
ents (for example, combining a dash of grilled pineapple salsa with the
succulent adobo roasted pork found in the tacos al pastor). Each dish is
bursting with flavor. Tired of plain old guacamole? Then try Cilantro Grill’s
guacamole tom-tom, which combines chopped tomatoes and tomatillos
with avocados and onions, and then livens things up with the zing of lime,
cilantro, and Serrano chile. The clean-lined, zesty-hued interior is a step up
from other quick-service restaurants, too.

CJ’s Deli & Diner
$
West Maui (Kaanapali)
AMERICAN
“Comfort food at comfort prices” — that’s the motto at CJ’s, and this
cheap-chic diner keeps its word. An extensive chalkboard menu hangs
from the brightly colored wall above the open-air kitchen. Menu items
include generous, farmer-style breakfasts; hearty, veggie-packed salads;
half-pound burgers; classic Reubens; roasted chicken; pot roast; and fresh-
grilled fish. There’s a pleasing local flair to the offerings, including a host
of homemade baked goodies. Don’t miss the hot malasadas, a light and
flaky sweet pastry, sort of like a powdered-sugar-covered doughnut hole,
which is one of the islands’ favorite sweet treats; CJ’s can be downright
addictive. Food can be prepared for takeout or plated to enjoy in the
casual, colorful dining room; you can even order one of their “chefs to go”
meals that’s completely prepped to be thrown on the grill when you get
back to the condo. There’s even an Internet-connected computer so you
can check your e-mail while you wait. Stop by for a box lunch to go if you’re

Da’ Kitchen
$
South Maui (Kihei)/Central Maui (Kahului)
LOCAL HAWAIIAN
Da’ Kitchen is the place to come for local grinds. The simple but comfort-
able Kihei closet is the original; come for the food, not the mood. Place
your order at the counter and then grab one of the handful of tables to
chow down on the extra-hearty eats. All the classic Hawaiian plate lunches
come with two scoops of rice, plus potato and macaroni salad (you can
request a green salad instead) — trust me, you won’t leave here hungry.
Good choices include pulled kalua pork, slow-cooked until tender and sea-
soned with Hawaiian salt; chicken katsu, breaded in panko crumbs and
served with Japanese barbecue sauce; and loco moco, a hamburger patty
grilled, topped with two fried eggs, and smothered in gravy (a dieter’s
delight!). Also recommended are a yummy lemon chicken and a couple of
teriyaki dishes for more mainstream tastes, plus big Asian-style noodle
bowls, hamburgers, and a better-than-you’d-expect Chinese chicken salad.
Some locals complain that this is local food “for tourists,” but I continue
to see plenty of locals here, especially at the Kahului location. The color-
ful Kahului location is more cafe-style, with full table service.

The Flatbread Company
$–$$
Central Maui (Paia)
PIZZA
This utterly delightful new entry to the Maui dining scene is well worth
the drive to Paia (about ten minutes east of Kahalui, along the Hana
Highway) for its terrific value, excellent fare, and all-around satisfying
dining experience. As you might expect, the Flatbread Company special-
izes in pizza. Its all-natural, wood-fired pizzas are baked right in the center
of the colorful, high-rafted open dining room, in a massive clay oven. You
can watch the night’s baker (a small chalkboard announces his name —
ours was Bob) nurture the flatbreads and other dishes to kiawe-charred
perfection. All ingredients that can be organic and/or island grown are,
including free-range and chemical-free meats; the dough is even made
fresh daily from 100 percent organically grown wheat.
The menu features two main sections: salads and flatbreads. However, the
wide variety of combinations will keep everyone in your party engaged.
You can choose from one of the creatively designed pizzas — such as
Mopsy’s Kalua Pork, topped with smoked free-range pork shoulder, home-
made organic mango barbecue sauce, organic red onions, Maui pineapple,
local Surfing Goat Dairy chèvre, Maui Sprout Farm scallions, premium moz-
zarella, imported parmesan, and herbs — or design your own. Pizzas come
12- and 16-inch, while salads can be built appetizer or entree size, depend-
ing on what you dress yours with. I’ve found that a salad with a few add-
on items and a 16-inch pie are plenty for two hungry diners.
Both the room and service is colorful and very friendly, with a contempo-
rary, surfer-hippie vibe that’s just right for Paia. There’s a full, very com-
petent bar that makes a convivial place to sit if you have to wait a few
minutes for your table, plus an affordable list of wines by the bottle or
glass. Great for families, too. From start to finish, my new favorite spot on
Maui.

This traditionalist’s haven boasts an ultraromantic setting that includes a
charming, slightly frilly dining room, tables on the lanai, and a lovely
garden patio. A regular winner of the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence
and named “Maui’s little French jewel” by Bon Appétit magazine, Gerard’s
offers refined cuisine that seldom disappoints, as long as you’re not paying
too much attention to price. Gerard Reversade excels at seeking out the
freshest local ingredients and preparing them in traditional Gallic style.
My favorite among the starters is the shiitake and oyster mushrooms in
puff pastry, but the foie gras terrine is a must for those who indulge. A
wealth of meat and poultry dishes is at hand (including a terrific rack of
lamb in mint crust), plus divine daily fresh fish preparations that depend
on what the boats bring in. Inventive desserts provide a memorable finale,
unless you opt for a cheese plate, served with toasted country bread and
poached pears. Service is appropriately attentive. Very expensive, but a
nice choice for special-occasion diners who prefer the classics over con-
temporary dining experiences.

Upcountry Maui
HAWAII REGIONAL
This attractive plantation-style restaurant continues to be one of the best
not only in Maui, but in all of Hawaii — and my top recommendation for
those who prefer to sample top-quality, island-style cooking in a refresh-
ingly casual and pretension-free setting. Star chef Bev Gannon, the queen
of Hawaii Regional Cuisine, presents a heartier-than-average Hawaii
Regional menu full of American home-style favorites prepared with an
island spin and a few generous dashes of fun. I love to start with the rock
shrimp tempura, served in a Chinese “to go” with popcorn (popcorn
shrimp — get it?), and accompanied by a trio of dipping sauces that
include a heavenly truffle honey. On the main-course menu, look for such
signature satisfiers as succulent barbecued pork ribs; long-simmering
coconut fish and shrimp curry; and New Zealand rack of lamb prepared

Hunan-style. No matter what you order, you won’t be disappointed. The
desserts — created by Bev’s daughter Teresa Gannon, now a well-known
chef in her own right — are better than Mom used to make; I never miss
the light and tangy lilikoi (passion fruit) tart. The keiki menu even comes
complete with kid-friendly “cocktails.” Well worth the 45-minute drive
Upcountry; Bev never disappoints. (If you’re in South Maui, you can head
to sibling restaurant Joe’s Simply Delicious Food for a different type of

Going for a post-Haleakala-
sunrise breakfast
Rising at o’dark thirty to drive two hours Upcountry to catch the glorious sunrise from
atop Haleakala Crater is one of Maui’s greatest pastimes (see Chapter 13). But the real
treat comes after, in the form of a hearty, country-style breakfast. Two wonderful
breakfast stops sit at the base of the mountain, in a tiny town called Kula that you’ll
pass through on your way back to the beach.
Kula Sandalwoods Cafe, 15427 Haleakala Highway ($; Highway 377; % 808-878-3523;
www.kulasandalwoods.com; see map p. 125), is a family-run restaurant that starts
serving home-baked pastries, omelets prepared with fresh-from-the-chicken-coop
eggs and garden-fresh veggies, and eggs Benedict topped with hollandaise sauce
(made from scratch) every day at 7:30 a.m. All the home-style breakfasts and lunches
are hearty and delicious; I especially like the French toast made from home-baked
Portuguese sweetbread. You can choose to eat in the large dinerlike room or out on
the lanai if it’s not too chilly. It’s open Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and

award-winning chef James McDonald — and awarded a gold award in 2006
as one of Maui’s best restaurants by Honolulu magazine — I’o is a multi-
faceted joy, with winningly innovative fusion cuisine, first-rate service, and
a top-notch wine list that has won the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence.
The seafood-heavy menu features copious Pacific Rim accents, plus a few
creative twists, courtesy of the Western hemisphere: Maine lobster tails
are stir-fried and served with sweet potatoes flambéed in a dark rum and
mango Thai curry sauce; the grilled lamb chop is spiced with madras curry
and topped with a pineapple demi-glace; and the fresh catch gets a crust
of foie gras for the ultimate decadence. Each dish is paired with a recom-
mended wine for easy ordering. Skip the silken purse appetizer, though —
it’s an overrated signature. A full, friendly bar (including a tempting array
of specialty martinis) makes this restaurant an all-around terrific choice.

This lovely sushi bar just off the lobby at the tony Ritz-Carlton is a hit for
its fresh-off-the-boat fish lovingly prepared by Chef Tadashi Yoshino and
his team of well-trained sushi chefs. If Sansei is a bastion of sushi creativ-
ity, Kai is a temple to traditionalism. Usually at least 20 varieties of raw fish
are on the menu, depending on what’s freshest and best that day. On my
last visit, we enjoyed dense, rich, buttery hamachi (yellowtail) and melt-
in-your-mouth toro (fatty tuna), which is always worth the splurge if it’s on
the menu. The chef breaks tradition on the creative appetizer menu; the
braised short-rib potstickers were a delectable delight. There’s a full menu
of classic and creative martinis and margaritas, as well as a fine selection
of wine, beer and sake. The room is spacious, bright and modern, warmed
by natural fibers and glowing woods, and service is everything you should
expect from Ritz-Carlton. Well worth the trip to Kapalua for those who love
quality sushi.

Kaahumanu was born in 1768), the restaurant marries fresh island ingre-
dients with sophisticated, contemporary preparations. Chef Cox works
closely with local farmers and fishermen in a never-ending quest to pro-
cure the finest ingredients on Maui, and the menu changes daily to reflect
what’s fresh and in season. The very good cuisine is a perfect match for
the simple elegance of the dining room, with gleaming hardwood floors,
well-spaced tables, and glorious ocean views. The room is graced with
original island-inspired art that includes the breathtaking Red Sails paint-
ing, with its imagery of the first Hawaiians voyaging to the islands.

Breakfast is much better than in needs to be, with such yummy dishes as
a Heirloom spinach omelet dressed with Big Island goat cheese, Maui
onions, and Pohole fern salad, or Brioche French toast served with chicken
mango sausage that’s its own savory treat. Lunch brings a fine grilled Kobe

good half-dozen), hefty sirloins served with garlic mashed potatoes, and
such island favorites as Koloa pork ribs with plum barbecue sauce. With
Caesar salads and sides included, dinners make for a very good deal, and
there’s nightly entertainment to boot. Dessert lovers should save room for

stuffed breakfast burrito with black beans and rice or fluffy Portuguese
sweetbread French toast. Lunch on one of the tropical pizzas (I love the
Evil Jungle Pizza, with grilled chicken and spicy Thai peanut sauce), or per-
haps a grilled portobello mushroom sandwich on focaccia bread. The
fresh fish tacos or the homemade pastas are satisfying dinner choices, or
maybe you’ll just opt for cheap draft beers and affordable pupus like the
crispy calamari. The full dinner menu is served until midnight (tropical

larly named it as their Maui favorite since it opened its doors in 1990 —
and I’m thrilled to report that even though David Paul’s name is no longer
on the door, it’s still as divine as ever. In actuality, David Paul hasn’t been
involved in the restaurant for nearly a decade now; chef/owner Jurg Munch

The dining room is one of Hawaii’s prettiest. It’s stylish yet delightfully
homey, with high pressed-tin ceilings, elegantly dressed tables, golden
wood floors, vibrant original art by spirited Maui colorist Jan Kasprzycki,
and a generous bar at the center of the room that adds just the right
amount of lively bustle to the scene. The kitchen excels at distinctive fla-
vors that are bold without being overpowering. Signature dishes remain
the stars of the menu, including kalua duck — a duck confit leg bathed in
reduced plum wine sauce — which is rich, fork-tender, and greaseless. I’m
also wowed by the Kona coffee–roasted rack of lamb, dressed in a light

cabernet demi-glace. Lahaina Grill also shines with seafood; start with the
Cake Walk, a delectable trio of Kona lobster crab cake, zesty Louisiana rock
shrimp cake, and seared ahi cake. The celestial seared ahi and foie gras
pairing with fig compote will prove that foie gras is far from passé. The
wine list is excellent, and the all-pro waitstaff offers welcome relief from

with grilled bacon-wrapped scallops; macadamia nut–crusted mahimahi
dressed in a mango beurre blanc; and a range of steaks and lamb chops.
The food is good if not great; my favorite part of the meal was the well-
prepared fresh ahi poke and fresh raw oysters from the oyster bar, which
flies in mollusks from around the world. You can also sit in the inside
dining room and bar, where a less expensive menu is available, featuring
good burgers, fish and chips, and other casual dishes, as well as oysters,
sushi, ceviche, and other specialties from the oyster bar. We experienced
perfectly satisfactory service, but word is that it can be spotty.

similar to that at the Hula Grill’s Barefoot Bar. Upstairs is Leilani’s, a spa-
cious and comfortable open-air dining room that’s dressed in dark woods

the necessary window dressing. On my last visit, I was extremely pleased
with the quality of my filet mignon, which was crusted in cracked Hawaiian
sea salt and pepper, flash-grilled to keep the juices in, and served with a
delectable papaya béarnaise. My husband, a prime-rib connoisseur, was
equally pleased with his slow-roasted version, with accompanying au jus

European-style waitstaff, who serve every dish with a professional flourish,
regularly win the annual “Best Service” and “Best Seafood” awards from
the Maui News. A half-dozen fresh catches — delivered straight off the boat
from local fishermen — are usually on hand, and you can choose the
preparation you’d prefer. Your choices include a la meunière; baked and
stuffed with Alaskan king crabmeat; Provençal style (sautéed with olives,
peppers, and tomatoes in garlic and olive oil); and Cajun spiced. But my
absolute favorite is the en Bastille, in which the fish is “imprisoned” (get
it?) in grated potato and sautéed, and then crowned with scallions, mush-
rooms, tomatoes, and meunière sauce — yum! Meat and poultry are on
hand for non–seafood eaters, including a well-prepared steak Diane and
slowly simmered pork osso buco. The bread comes with a delectable beer
cheese spread (how retro is that?), and your server prepares your Caesar
salad tableside if you ask. Book a table on the lanai before sunset for pretty

HEALTHY ECLECTIC
The Valley Isle has applauded the return of hometown chef Mark Ellman to
the gourmet dining fold. After shutting the doors on Avalon a few years
back, Ellman focused his energy on expanding his successful Maui Tacos
quick-service chain, and otherwise stayed out of sight. In 2006, he reen-
tered the full-service restaurant business with a bang. Mala means
“garden” in the Hawaiian language; it’s an apt moniker thanks to the restau-
rant’s bounteous menu, which bursts with exciting choices. The menu is
built around small plates and sharing, so you can enjoy a variety of taste
sensations in the course of your meal. The focus is on healthy eating, so
expect whole grains and organic whenever possible. This won’t dull your

pleasure; highlights from the regular menu include a divine Kobe beef
cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon and Maytag blue cheese, a
wok-fried moi (a fish once reserved for Hawaiian royalty) sautéed in a
delectable black-bean sauce, and an exotic Indonesian stir-fry with fresh
island fish. However, the real treat is the daily specials menu, where Mark
puts his creativity to full use, making the most of what’s market fresh that
day. Vegetarians will feel well cared for.
Mala boasts a delightfully casual-contemporary setting where you can feel
perfectly comfortable showing up in your shorts; with its over-the-water
location and waves crashing just below, the tiki torch–lit lanai is one of
Maui’s most thrilling open-air dining rooms. Start your meal with a house
special mojito or sangria, and the evening is yours. Weekend brunch is its
own delight.

Mama’s Fish House
$$$$$
Central Maui (Paia)
SEAFOOD
Okay, it’s true: Mama’s Fish House is just slightly touristy, and you’ll have
to pay through the nose. Despite those caveats, Mama’s is my hands-down
top choice on Maui and one of my all-time favorite Hawaii restaurants —
and one of its most popular, too. The tiki-room setting is an archetype of
timeless Hawaii cool. The beach-house dining room has ambience in
excess, with lavish tropical floral arrangements, sea breezes ruffling the
tapa tablecloths, soft lighting, and gorgeous views galore. Fresh island fish
simply doesn’t get any better than this; it’s all caught locally, with the
provenance indicated on the menu (“Opakapaka caught by Earle Kiawi
bottom-fishing outside his homeport of Hana Bay”). The day’s catches are
the stars of the show, and you choose from four preparations. My favorite
is the Pua Me Hua Hana, two of the day’s fresh catches steamed gently and
served traditional luau style, with purple Molokai sweet potato, baked
banana, fresh island fruit, and a fresh young coconut — plates just don’t
get prettier than this. The service is sincere if a bit serious (“And what will
the lady have?”), but somehow it suits the mood. A lengthy list of tropical
drinks (dressed with umbrellas, of course) completes the tropical-romantic
picture. A kids’ menu is on hand for families. A real island-style delight!

clean, with a few cafe tables and chairs outside. The rotisserie chicken
(prepared traditional, teriyaki, or my favorite, the teriyaki citrus style) is
moist and delicious, as are the slow-cooked pork ribs — not greasy or fatty,
painted with tangy, but not spicy, house-special sauce. All dinners come

becue baked beans. The only misstep is the coleslaw made with raisins

Central Maui (Kahului)
LATIN AMERICAN
Locals and visitors alike flock here from all corners of the island, drawn
by the winning indoor/outdoor setting and creative, nicely prepared Latin
American cuisine that scores on all fronts. The boldly colored restaurant
can be described as retro-industrial — it’s cute and fun — but the groovy
patio is the place to be. Paying for chips and salsa is a drag, but all is for-
given after the basket arrives with its trio of zesty “samba” salsas.
Everything just gets better. At lunchtime, I like the adobo barbecued duck
and sweet potato quesadilla, mildly spiced with delicate green chilies, and
the classic pressed Cuban sandwich. At dinner, you may start with green
tomatoes, fried just right with smoked mozzarella and slivered red onions,
or zesty ceviche, made with fresh island fish. For your main course, con-
sider the citrus-jalapeño-glazed salmon, a black-pepper-rubbed New York
strip steak grilled with chipotle-wine demi-glace, or the skewered jumbo
prawns glazed with pineapple rum and served with mashed sweet pota-
toes. You can’t go wrong with anything on the menu; every pan-Latin dish
sings with flavor. No wonder Rachel Ray named Mañana Garage a Maui
favorite on her Food Network “$40 a Day in Maui” show. A real winner!

Maui Brewing Company
$$$
West Maui (Kahana)
STEAK/SEAFOOD
This restaurant has all the style of a bad toupee (luckily, a mid-2008
remodel will be complete by the time you arrive), but I like it anyway —
part brewpub, part sports bar (with live nightly music), and part clubby
restaurant. The fare is straight-ahead seafood and grill fare. Start with a
half-dozen oysters on the half-shell or maybe the kiawe-grilled brewer’s
sausage, and then move on to a first-rate fresh catch or something meatier,
if you’ve eaten your fill of seafood in Hawaii. The kitchen prepares fish to
your taste, one of four ways: blackened Cajun style, habanero-cornmeal
crusted, seven-spiced with soy mirin glaze, and “just plain” grilled. Beware
of the seven spices — five of them are peppers. I like the “just plain” best
because it lets the quality of the fish shine. The 10-ounce kiawe-smoked
prime rib is a high-quality cut and beautifully prepared. The rotisserie also
produces a lovely herb-rubbed chicken with a golden crust. You can also
opt for more casual fare, such as pizzas and burgers. All the house-made
beers are terrific — particularly the amber-hued Plantation Pale Ale and
the dark, robust Wild Hog Stout — and the service is easygoing but atten-
tive. A kids’ menu is on hand for family meals, plus there’s a late-night
menu of casual bar fare in case the munchies strike between 10 p.m. and
1 a.m. Look for great happy-hour deals on drinks and appetizers from 3 to

MEDITERRANEAN/SEAFOOD
This expensive Mediterranean-accented seafood restaurant is just gorgeous.
It’s not on the beach, but the ambience is ultraromantic anyway; I prefer the
vine-covered terrace with its sparkling lights, but the gorgeous, dimly lit
dining room (which features a spectacular aquarium and a 2,000-bottle wine
display) doesn’t disappoint, either. The straightforward preparations let the
clean, fresh flavor of the top-quality seafood shine: Kona-raised lobster is
perfectly steamed and shelled at your table; mahimahi is kiawe-grilled and
dressed with a cabernet sauce and white truffle oil; and an elegant opaka-
paka (pink snapper) is sautéed with meaty rock shrimps and lightly dressed
with lemon butter and capers. The young, elegantly dressed servers have
been schooled as pros, and it shows; you’ll want for nothing here. The wine
list is pricey but excellent. One caveat: I’ve had only excellent experiences
here, but lately I’ve heard quibbles about unevenness. A nice kids’ menu is
at hand if an upscale family dinner is in your plans.

postmodern in terms of décor, while Pacific’o is more middle-of-the-road
contemporary. Pacific’o’s menu has a more distinct Asian influence and
features more red-meat and fowl dishes for non–fish eaters. The
Hapa/Hapa Tempura is a don’t-miss for ahi tuna lovers. There’s an excel-
lent wine list (with many selections available by the glass), but tropical

This hugely popular restaurant serves some of the freshest and best-
prepared seafood on the island. It’s nothing fancy — colorful and crowded,
with happy diners elbow to elbow at picnic tables, chowing down on what-
ever’s fresh off the day’s boat, served on disposable dishware. But what-
ever you order, it’s bound to be fresh, well prepared, and delicious. Place
your order at the counter, and then find a seat. The mahimahi fish and chips
is always lightly breaded and perfectly crisp, and the generous portion is
a bargain at $13. The charbroiled fish is always what it should be; if ono is
in season, don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy this firm and moist local fish.
Even though the house specialty is seafood, the chicken selection or burger
(also locally supplied, by the Maui Cattle Company) are also well prepared
if there’s a fish-phobe in your group — a testament to this place’s commit-
ment to serving quality food. There’s a good beer and wine selection, too.
Well worth the drive, especially if you’re tired of resort prices.

sive or overly fussy. As you might expect, the specialties of the house are
beautifully prepared homemade pastas, which have always been perfectly
cooked on my visits. I like the slow-simmered penne puttanesca in Mark’s

his team have crafted a one-of-a-kind Asian-Mediterranean fusion menu
that changes frequently to take advantage of fresh seasonal produce.
Expect to find such dishes as a Tuscan-style rib-eye steak with garlic
mashed potatoes and goat’s milk Gorgonzola cheese; macadamia nut and
goat cheese salad with Kula greens, Kalamata olives, and passion-fruit

Chef D.K. Kodama’s superstar sushi bars offer some of Maui’s finest

the bill within reason. Composed primarily of pan-Asian seafood dishes
with multicultural touches, Sansei’s innovative menu has won raves from
fans around the globe. Entrees are available, but I recommend assembling
an adventurous family-style meal from the sushi rolls and small plates: The
rock shrimp cake in ginger-lime chili butter, topped with crispy Chinese
noodles, and Thai ahi carpaccio in a red pepper–lime sauce are both stand-
outs. You really can’t go wrong with anything. I love the beautifully pre-
sented flower sushi; don’t miss it if you’re a fish head. For premier sushi
service, cozy up to the bar at the bustling Kihei location; you won’t be dis-
appointed. For more creative taste-testing, head to the Kapalua location,
where wunderkind chef Ivan Pahk brings his own innovative spin to the
nightly specials. Even the desserts are divine at this easy-going, Japanese-

late-night dining and live karaoke from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Thursdays and

HAWAII REGIONAL/PACIFIC RIM
Kudos to the Hyatt Regency for adding this genuinely inspired restaurant
to the Kaanapali dining scene. Sonz occupies the resort’s attractive Swan
Court, where soaring ceilings, dim lighting, generously spaced tables ter-
raced to maximize appreciation for the swan-filled pond, and impeccable
service that falls refreshingly shy of formal set a romantic tone. (I saw not
one but two wedding parties here on my last visit.) But the real draw is
the first-rate cuisine, which focuses on using local delicacies and Maui-
grown produce in artful, often European-inspired dishes. Consider start-
ing with the Surfing Goat cheese ravioli, stuffed with “Purple Rain” cheese
from the local Surfing Goat dairy (see Chapter 13) and delicately dressed
in Kula corn, Hamakua mushrooms, edamame, prosciutto and a sherry
vinegar pan sauce, or opt to begin with the escargot profiterole, whose alii
oyster mushrooms add a genuinely Hawaii flair. Move on to the Hawaiian
opakapaka picatta, a flaky local pink snapper adorned in fresh veggies and
a slow-roasted tomato puree; a beef tenderloin from the Maui Cattle
Company, marinated in Maui coffee, beautifully grilled and accompanied
by crispy parmesan-garlic fries and “Mauishire” steak sauce; or the steak-
like ahi “prime rib,” seared medium rare, drizzled in lemongrass “au jus,”
and paired with green beans, wasabi potatoes, and a popover. With 3,000
bottles and an insightful staff, the wine cellar won’t disappoint either.

$$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
CALIFORNIA/HAWAII REGIONAL
America’s first celebrity chef, Wolfgang Puck, goes Hawaiian at this Maui
outpost of his world-famous Beverly Hills restaurant. Puck’s signature 
cutting-edge, California style showcases fresh, local Hawaii ingredients.
The fabulous dining room is a sleek, modern open-air setting overlooking
the blue Pacific. The menu features a heavenly coconut soup with local
lobster, kefir, chili, and galangal; a whole steamed fish served with chili,
ginger, and baby choy sum; and an incredible Kona lobster with sweet-and-
sour banana curry, coconut rice, and dry-fried green beans. Spago has an
extensive and thoughtful wine list. Save room for dessert (perhaps a warm
chocolate truffle purse with Big Island vanilla bean ice cream). Be prepared
for super-high prices and a sleek, L.A.-inspired attitude.

$32–$52. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Daily 5:30–9:30 p.m.
If you’re in the mood for an elegant dinner in South Maui but suspect
that Spago is a bit too style-conscious for you, opt instead for the Four
Seasons’ sister restaurant, Ferraro’s Bar e Ristorante ($$$$; % 808-
874-8000; www.fourseasons.com/maui). South Maui’s only outdoor
beachside restaurant turns into a twinkling seaside paradise in the
evening. Ferraro’s has built a deserved buzz with authentic Italian cucina
rustica (the scrumptious focaccia is baked over a wood fire). It’s a gor-
geous sunset setting, with live evening entertainment. Casual poolside
fare dominates during the daytime.
Stella Blues Cafe
$$–$$$
South Maui (Kihei)
NEW AMERICAN
Stella Blues began life as a Deadhead-themed deli, but it has reinvented
itself in recent years as a stylish and sophisticated grown-up restaurant.
The rock-’n’-roll memorabilia still dresses the walls, but now it adds a
pleasingly funky touch to an airy dining room dressed in rich colors and
warm woods, with an open, stainless-steel kitchen and a big, backlit bar.
Tiki torches add romance to the outdoor patio after dark. But the great
thing about Stella Blues is that it’s still friendly, unpretentious, and afford-
able. You’d be hard-pressed to find another restaurant in the islands that
offers this much panache and good cooking at such affordable prices.
Start your day with a hearty create-your-own omelet and then move on to
a French dip or another hefty sandwich at lunch. The place really comes
alive at dinner: Start with the surprisingly good Caesar salad, the delec-
table homemade hummus served with hot pita, or the funky nachos (blue
and yellow corn chips layered with mahimahi, ahi, jalapeños, Jack cheese,
and guacamole). Choose from a range of creative pizzas, pastas, and big
plates for your main course; the New York steak (homegrown by the Maui
Cattle Company) is as good as most cuts of beef that are twice the price.
Late-night dining (until midnight weekdays, to 1:30 a.m. Fri and Sat nights)
is another plus. Good job, Stella — you go, girl!

Tommy Bahama’s Tropical Cafe
$$$$
South Maui (Wailea)
CARIBBEAN
Housed in the Tommy Bahama’s fashion emporium at the Shops at Wailea,
this delightful restaurant perfectly embodies the tropical haberdasher’s
breezily sophisticated style. The open-air room is a mélange of bamboo,
rattan, and tropical prints that come together in a postmodern plantation
style. Although the food is very well prepared, it’s too expensive — but
Chapter 11: Dining Out around Maui 177

that’s the story of this pricey resort coast. I love Tommy Bahama’s best for
cocktails, which are some of the island’s most creative and satisfying, or a
relaxed lunch, when the menu focuses on Caribbean-inspired sandwiches
and bounteous entree-size salads. Pleasing choices include the Habana
Cabana pulled-pork sandwich, finished with the restaurant’s own black-
berry brandy barbecue sauce; and the Aruba Arugula salad, tossed in a
tamarind vinaigrette and garnished with Caribbean-zested shrimp and scal-
lops. Dinner brings more substantial fare, such as maple-brined and char-
grilled pork tenderloin topped with a dried-berry merlot chutney, and
pan-seared sashimi-grade ahi dressed in sweet chili oil, cilantro, and lemon-
grass. All in all, a really satisfying dining choice, if you can overlook the tab.
As good as the food is, Tommy Bahama’s Tropical Cafe is really about soak-
ing up the carefree mood, along with a few fruity cocktails. Come early for
dinner, because the second-level setting enjoys gorgeous sunset views.

South Maui (Kihei)
INTERNATIONAL
This cheerful new spot has brought welcome color, flavor, personality, and
dining value to the Kihei scene. It’s situated in a cute plantation-style cot-
tage, with most of the restaurant residing on the covered patio. The setting
is ultracasual and pleasant, dressed in a cute, island-modern style and a
vibrant palette. Place your order at the inside counter, take a seat, and
your food will be brought to you by an attentive waitstaff. The menu is
comprised of an international array of noodle bowls, from an Indonesian
peanut stir-fry — freshly sautéed veggies in a spiced peanut sauce with
thick egg noodles, topped with cilantro and sprouts — to a great version
of the local favorite saimin — chow mein noodles in a miso broth, topped
with barbecued pork, fried Spam (an island favorite, and tastier than you’d
think), fish cake, and boiled egg. I also like the Maui fried rice, a local ver-
sion of the classic with sweet onion and island pineapple, and the yummy
Thai red curry. Beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, or tofu can be added to any
dish. You can start your meal with chicken satay or pan-fried potstickers,
and follow with banana jaffel, an Indonesian toasted sandwich with toasted
peanut butter, banana, and honey on Hawaiian sweet bread. Breakfast jaf-
fels means you can start your day here, too.

Luau!
Maui is Hawaii’s hands-down winner in the luau department. These
lavish feasts are a splurge, but they’re an only-in-Maui experience.
Part III: Settling Into Maui 
178

You need reservations for the luaus that I list in this section. Make reser-
vations as far in advance as possible — preferably before you leave
home — because all these first-rate beach parties are often fully booked
a week or more in advance, sometimes two.
Don’t give up if you’re trying to make last-minute plans, though; it never
hurts to call and ask whether a few spots have opened up due to cancel-
lations. Also, if you’re booking at the last minute or you want more
island luaus to choose from, check with Tom Barefoot’s Tours (% 888-
222-3601; www.tombarefoot.com), a very reliable Maui-based activities
center that can hook you up with a number of other luaus on Maui, and
sometimes even save you a few bucks in the process.
The Feast at Lele
This partnership between the folks behind the stellar Old Lahaina Luau
and star chef James McDonald of I’o and Pacific’o (see earlier in this chap-
ter) is a winning concept. It’s ideal for those diners who don’t mind paying
extra for a more intimate oceanfront setting and a private table. An excel-
lent five-course meal is prepared by a skilled chef and served at your own
table (no standing in line at an all-you-can-eat buffet). You’ll experience a
lovely flower-lei greeting but no traditional imu ceremony or craft demon-
strations (as at the Old Lahaina Luau). The performance troupe is smaller,
but they’re held to the same exacting standards.
This feast celebrates not only Hawaii but also three more Polynesian
islands — Tonga, Tahiti, and Samoa — so the structure diverges from your
standard luau. Each course is dedicated to an island culture — comprised
of gourmet versions of foods from the native cuisine, followed by a native
song-and-dance performance. Not only does this creative approach offer
you the opportunity to sample plenty of well-prepared dishes — steamed
moi (island trout) from Hawaii; lobster, octopus, and ogo salad from Tonga;
steamed chicken and taro leaf in coconut milk from Tahiti; and so on — but
it also highlights the nuances among the unique but related Polynesian
groups. Furthermore, because Samoa is represented, the dazzling show can
both stay culturally correct and feature crowd-pleasing fire-knife dancers.
Although the Feast at Lele welcomes all visitors, it tends to cater to a more
sophisticated, kid-free grown-up crowd than most luaus, making it an ideal
choice for romance-seeking couples or anyone wanting a more refined
experience. You can choose from a full wine list and tropical cocktail menu
in addition to the included well cocktails; and you can expect your two
dedicated servers to be friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.
See map p. 154. 505 Front St. (on the ocean at Shaw Street), Lahaina. % 866-244-5353
or 808-667-5353. www.feastatlele.com. Open: Nightly at 6 p.m. (at 5:30 p.m.
Oct–Mar). Admission: $110 adults, $80 kids 2–12. Prices include cocktails, but not tax
and tip.
Old Lahaina Luau
Old Lahaina Luau is Hawaii’s most authentic and acclaimed luau and my
absolute favorite. The oceanfront luau grounds provide a stunning setting,
Chapter 11: Dining Out around Maui 179

both the luau feast and riveting entertainment serve as a wonderful intro-
duction to genuine island culture, and the staff exudes aloha. When you
book, choose between Hawaiian-style seating on mats and cushions set at
low tables at the foot of the stage or traditional seating at generously pro-
portioned common tables with comfortable wooden chairs; all tables have
great views, but earlier bookings garner the best seats.
You’re welcomed with a fresh flower lei (the yellow plumeria is the fragrant
one) and greeted with a tropical cocktail. Arrive early so that you have
plenty of time to stroll around the grounds — watching craftspeople at
work and taking in the gorgeous views — before the imu ceremony, in
which the luau pig is unearthed from the underground oven. The tradi-
tional buffet spread is excellently prepared and well labeled, so you know
what you’re eating (although the sit-down Feast at Lele, which I describe
earlier in this section, should be the choice for gourmands).
Following dinner, the luau’s excellent show begins, featuring authentic hula
and traditional chants accompanied by an intelligent narrative charting
the history of Hawaii from the first islanders to modern day. Don’t mistake
this narrative for a deadly-dull history lesson — it’s compelling entertain-
ment, and the male and female dancers are all first-rate performers. (Don’t
expect fire dancers, though, because ancient Hawaiians didn’t play with
fire.) It’s well worth the money, a joy from start to finish, and an excellent
choice for families, groups, and couples alike.
See map p. 154. 1251 Front St. (on the ocean side of the street, across from Lahaina
Cannery Mall), Lahaina. % 800-248-5828 or 808-667-1998. www.oldlahainaluau.
com. Open: Nightly at 5:45 p.m. (at 5:15 p.m. Oct–Mar). Admission: $92 adults, $62 kids
2–12. Prices include cocktails, but not tax and tip.
Old Lahaina Luau is now offering a special three-hour daytime event
called Ho’omana’o, which brings the authentic luau experience to the
morning meal. You’ll enjoy a Hawaiian-style breakfast, an aloha welcome
chant followed by a hula show, and interactive cultural encounters —
poi pounding, hukilau (throw-net fishing), kapa-cloth making, and much
more — in three villages styled after ancient Hawaii. Ho’omana’o is
offered on the Old Lahaina Luau grounds on Tuesday and Friday morn-
ings at 9 a.m. The cost is $69 adults, $49 kids 2 to 12. As with all Old
Lahaina Luau offerings, advance reservations are recommended.

his part is just what you need for your introduction to
Maui’s famous beaches. I’ll show you how to enjoy the
waves, and provide you with the lowdown on the best water-
sports, snorkel spots, cruises, and much more. You’ll also dis-
cover the island’s top adventures: watching the mystical
sunrise at Haleakala National Park, cruising the Heavenly
Road to Hana, and splashing in tropical waterfalls along the
way. (I have all the best golf courses listed here, too, of
course.) I’ll also show you where to shop, where to toast the
perfect sunset, and where to party the night away. As if this
weren’t enough, a whole world of adventure is waiting for 
you on Maui’s closest neighbors, unspoiled Molokai and
upscale Lanai.

St. (at Wakea Street, south of the Hana Highway), Kahului (% 800-621-
3601 or 808-661-1246; www.tombarefoot.com), which may be able to
save you a few valuable dollars on many of Maui’s activities on land and
sea. Unlike most other so-called “activity centers” on Maui, this profes-
sional operation has nothing to do with timeshares — activities are their
business, and their reps are pros who really know their stuff. I’ve found
the salespeople’s recommendations to be consistently good ones. You’re
welcome to visit the store, but you don’t have to; all business can be
conducted over the phone or online, even before you arrive in the
islands (which I recommend, to ensure that you don’t miss out on an
activity that matters to you).

Tom Barefoot’s offers a 10 percent discount on select activities when
you pay with cash, personal check, or traveler’s checks, or a 7 percent
discount if you pay by credit card. However, if you tell Tom Barefoot’s
that you want the top-of-the-line snorkel cruise or luau, they’ll freely rec-
ommend and book you with Trilogy or Old Lahaina, even though they
can’t offer you a savings and won’t make a dime — because they figure
that a happy customer is a returning customer. You can book discounted
activities from home via their Web site or toll-free number.
Another recommendable activity booker is Trilogy Ocean Sports, which
maintains a kiosk on Kaanapali Beach in front of the Kaanapali Beach
Hotel (% 808-661-7789). A sister business to Trilogy Excursions —
which is universally regarded as the finest snorkel-sail operator on Maui
(read more about Trilogy Excursions’ offerings later in this chapter) —
Trilogy Ocean Sports can book you not only onto Trilogy cruises but
also with other activity providers they endorse, whether you’re looking
for a backcountry four-wheeling excursion or a beginning surfing lesson.
They’ve handpicked a top-flight group of activity providers to represent.
Do yourself a favor and avoid those activities bookers that are trying 
to sell you a timeshare. Believe me, you don’t want to spend a half-day 
of your precious vacation time warding off a salesperson’s hard-sell
advances to buy a timeshare you don’t need in exchange for a “free”
snorkel cruise on a cut-rate operator.
Hitting the Beaches
Maui wouldn’t be such a glamour girl without its breathtaking array of
beaches. All of Maui’s fabulous beaches (even those in front of exclusive
resorts) are open to the public. Hawaii state law requires all hotels to
offer public right-of-way access (across private property) to the beach,
along with public parking. So just because a beach fronts a hotel doesn’t
mean that you can’t enjoy the water. However, the hotel may restrict cer-
tain areas of private property for guests’ use only. Hotels are generally
happy to rent you beach gear or sell you refreshments.
Never leave valuables in your rental car while you’re at the beach.
Knowledgeable thieves like to prey on tourists, and they know how to
get into your interior, trunk, and glove box in no time flat. Be especially
diligent about leaving your stuff behind at your condo or in your hotel
safe when you’re heading off to a remote beach.
Also, when it comes to safe swimming conditions, do your homework:
Check out the following beach descriptions and, after you’re on Maui,
make inquiries about local surf conditions. At beaches without life-
guards, keep an eye out for posted signs warning of dangerous currents
or conditions. If you see a red flag hoisted at any beach, don’t venture
into the water because it indicates that conditions are unsafe for swim-
mers. Even if the waves look placid, trust the warning. And never turn
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
190

your back on the ocean; big waves can come out of nowhere in a matter
of minutes. See the end of this chapter for more on water safety.
Snorkelers should also check out the Snorkeling section under
“Discovering Water Fun for Everyone,” for some additional recommenda-
tions on great snorkel spots.
In West Maui
These fine beaches are easily accessible from the Honoapiilani Highway,
which connects the island’s commercial heart, Kahului, to Lahaina,
Kaanapali, and Kapalua. Each one offers excellent opportunities for whale-
watching in humpback season and for sunset viewing at any time of year.
Honolua/Mokuleia Bay Marine Life Conservation District
Snorkelers love this gorgeous cove for its smooth surf, clear waters (which
are protected as a marine-life conservation district), excellent coral for-
mations, and abundance of tropical fish, especially on the west side of the
bay. The beige-sand crescent is lovely and never too crowded. In winter,
stay out of the water — it’s too rough and dangerous. Instead, watch dare-
devil surfers ride the finest breaks in the islands.
Sorry, this beach has no facilities. But nearby D. T. Fleming Beach Park
has restrooms, showers, picnic tables, and barbecue grills. This quiet,
crescent-shaped cove north of the Ritz-Carlton starts at the 16th hole of
the Kapalua golf course (Makaluapuna Point) and rolls around to the sea
cliffs at the other side. Ironwood trees provide shade. The waters are gen-
erally calm enough to offer good swimming and snorkeling.
See map p. 192. At the northernmost end of Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30),
about 2 miles past Office Road (the turnoff for Kapalua); park with the other cars in
the available spaces or along the roadside and walk 200 yards down the stairs and
to the beach.
Kapalua Beach
This gorgeous, golden crescent bordered by two palm-studded points is
justifiably popular for sunbathing, swimming, and snorkeling. The sandy
bottom slopes gently to deep water that’s crystal-clear. Well-protected
from strong winds and currents, Kapalua’s calm waters are usually great
for swimmers of all ages and abilities year-round, and waves come in just
right for easy riding. The rocky points offer good fish-viewing opportuni-
ties for snorkelers and offshore divers alike. The beach is also great for
offshore whale-watching in winter, too. A shady path and cool lawns edge
the beach’s inland side. Facilities include showers, restrooms, a rental
shack, and outdoor showers. The small parking lot is limited to about 30
spaces, so arrive early.
See map p. 192. On Lower Honoapiilani Road at the south end of Kapalua, just before
the Napili Kai Beach Club. To get there: From Honoapiilani Highway, turn left just past
mile marker 30, go 1⁄10 mile to Lower Honoapiilani Road, turn left, and go 8⁄10 mile to the
access point.

Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 193

Kahekili (Old Airport) Beach
This smallish but extremely attractive beach is one of Maui’s best snorkel
spots for beginners and families with small kids because its waters are
shallow, clear, and well protected by an expansive offshore reef that teems
with colorful fish. The nice facilities — including very clean restrooms with
showers, plus picnic tables — make it a good place to come and spend the
day. Don’t be surprised if you see groups of divers, because Kahekili is a
popular instructional dive spot.
See map p. 192. Off Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30) at the north end of Kaanapali,
just across from the Sugar Cane Train. To get there: From Honoapiilani Highway, turn
left at the northernmost access to Kaanapali; look for public beach access and park-
ing on your right.
Kaanapali Beach
Maui’s first resort developers were drawn to build on this beach for a good
reason: It’s absolutely fabulous. Hotels and condos (almost approaching
the density of Waikiki) now line Kaanapali’s 4 miles of grainy, gold sand,
but the not-too-wide beach tends to be populated only in pockets; you can
usually find an uncrowded area to spread out your towel even when the
hotels are at capacity. Swimming and wave jumping are excellent, but
beware of the rough winter shorebreak (where the waves break on the
shore), which can really kick up.
At the beach’s north end, in front of the Sheraton, is Black Rock, the best
offshore snorkel spot on Maui. The water is clear, the area is well-protected
from rough surf (most of the time), and the clouds of tropical fish are used
to finned folks. Well worth seeking out; mornings tend to be calmest and
clearest.
A paved beach walk links the hotels and the open-air Whaler’s Village
shopping and dining complex, a great place to cure the midday munchies
or sip a tropical cocktail while scanning for whales or watching the sun
set over the Pacific. Lifeguards and beach boys from the resorts man the
beach, beach-gear rental shacks are set up right on the sand, and most
hotels have outdoor showers (and sometimes restrooms) you can use;
restrooms are also available at Whaler’s Village.
The only downside is that parking is difficult for those who are not stay-
ing in the area. Whalers Village has a paid lot, but beachgoers are dis-
couraged from using it by a NO BEACH PARKING sign; if you do, be sure not to
be unloading a giant cooler, beach umbrella or set of chairs from your car,
and be sure to buy lunch (or at least some sunscreen) from one of the ven-
dors in the center to count as a shopper. Park with care here, lest you be
towed. Another alternative is to pay to park as a visitor at one of the
resorts, and do so legitimately by starting your day with a meal there.
There is a small free parking lot for public beach access in the Sheraton
Maui’s parking structure. Follow the main resort road down to the north
end; the entrance is right before the main entrance to the resort itself, on
the lower level of the structure at its south end (nearest to the Kaanapali
Beach Hotel). Look for the sign that says BEACH ACCESS PARKING, park, and
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
194

follow the beach access path between the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and the
Sheraton. The lot is open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; come early to snare
your spot in this tiny lot.
See map p. 192. Kaanapali Parkway, off Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30),
Kaanapali.
Along the South Maui Coast
These fabulous beaches are located along Maui’s sunny southwest-facing
shore, where you find the resort areas of Kihei and Wailea.
Kamaole III Beach Park
Three popular beach parks — Kamaole I, II, and III — face the waves across
from South Kihei Road in mid-Kihei. The biggest and best is Kamaole III (or
Kam-3, as the locals call it), which boasts a playground and a grassy lawn
that meets the finely textured, golden sand. Swimming is generally safe,
but parents should make sure that little ones don’t venture too far out
because the bottom slopes off quickly. Families may prefer the beach’s
grassy end with shade trees, where the ocean bottom has a fairly gentle
slope. Both the north and south ends have rocky fingers that are great for
snorkelers, and the winter waves attract bodysurfers. This west-facing
beach is also an ideal spot to watch the sun go down or look for whales off-
shore in winter. Facilities include restrooms, showers, picnic tables, bar-
becues, volleyball nets, and lifeguards. Food and beach-gear rentals are
available at the malls across the street — but be careful crossing busy
Kihei Road!
See map p. 192. On South Kihei Road, just south of Keonekai Street (across from the
Maui Parkshore and Kamaole Sands condos), Kihei.
Mokapu and Ulua Beach Parks
Situated at the north end of Wailea, these lovely, side-by-side sister
beaches boast pretty, golden sand, grassy areas for sandless picnicking,
and clean facilities, including restrooms and a freshwater shower pole. The
ocean bottom is shallow and gently slopes down to deeper waters, making
swimming generally safe; snorkelers find Wailea’s best snorkeling at the
rocky north end. When the surf kicks up, the waves are excellent for body-
surfers. Although these beaches are popular with the nearby upscale
condo crowd, the sand rarely gets too crowded. The parking lot is tiny,
though, so come early.
See map p. 192. On Wailea Alanui Road at Hale Alii Place, between the Wailea
Marriott to the south and the Wailea Ekahi Village condos to the north (directly across
from the Palms at Wailea condos), Wailea.
Wailea Beach
This ultrafine gold-sand beach is long, wide, and protected on both sides
by black lava points with a sandy and sloping bottom, making the clear
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 195

waters excellent for swimming (and okay for snorkeling, too). The year-
round waves are just right for easy board-riding or bodysurfing, but trade
winds can kick up in the afternoon, so come early. The view out to sea is
gorgeous, with the islands of Kahoolawe and Lanai framing the view. This
site is ideal to watch for humpback whales in winter. This stretch of shore-
line may feel like it belongs to the ultradeluxe resorts that line it, but it
doesn’t; just look for the blue SHORELINE ACCESS signs for easiest entry points.
Restrooms and showers are available.
See map p. 192. Fronting the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons resorts, Wailea. To get
there: The blue SHORELINE ACCESS sign is between the two resorts on Wailea Alanui
Drive.
Maluaka (Makena) Beach
This wonderful beach park fronting the Maui Prince Hotel offers a pleas-
ing off-the-beaten-path experience for people in search of first-rate snor-
keling, or anybody who wants a break from Maui’s ever-present crowds.
Short, wide, and palm-fringed, this unspoiled crescent of golden, grainy
sand is set between two protective lava points and bounded by big, grassy
sand dunes. Snorkelers find surprisingly colorful coral and an impressive
array of vibrantly hued reef fish at the beach’s rocky south end, past the
lava point. Sunbathers and casual swimmers stick to the beautiful strand
closer to the hotel, which is virtually empty on weekdays. Facilities include
restrooms and showers.
See map p. 192. Makena Road, Makena (south of Wailea). To get there: Follow Wailea
Alanui Drive south through Wailea to Makena (where it becomes Makena Alanui Road);
go past the Maui Prince Hotel, turn right on Makena Road (where it wraps around) and
look for the SHORELINE ACCESS sign near the hotel for public access parking.
Oneloa Beach (Big Beach)
Oneloa means “long sand” in Hawaiian, and locals call it Big Beach. It
comes by its name honestly, for this gorgeous crescent of white sand is
3,300 feet long and more than 100 feet wide. Oneloa is a beautiful spot for
swimming, sunbathing, surfing, bodysurfing, and body boarding, or just
hanging out for the day and strolling along the picture-perfect shoreline.
And, true to its nickname, Oneloa is so big that even when it’s crowded, it
doesn’t feel crowded — so bring your beach chair and plan to stay a while,
playing in the gorgeous surf and light waves. Snorkeling is a bit better
down the road, but you’ll find decent fish-watching near the north. In
winter storm season, beware of fierce waves and a strong rip current that
sweeps the sharp drop-off. The area has no facilities except portable toi-
lets, but plenty of parking is available. Well worth seeking out for a picture-
perfect Maui day.
See map p. 192. Off Makena Rd., 11⁄3 miles south of the Maui Prince Hotel. To get there:
Drive past the Maui Prince Hotel 11⁄3 miles, where a paved road leads to the parking
lot and beach. A second parking lot is available just to the north.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
196

Hanging out at a perfect spot like Oneloa all day can sure make a vaca-
tioner hungry. If you find yourself in such a state, head south on Makena
Road just a bit to Makena Grill, a simple lunch cart on the inland side of
the road serving up fantastic fish tacos with pineapple salsa, beautifully
wood-grilled chicken and beef kabobs dressed in a pineapple-teriyaki
glaze, and one or two other lunch plates, depending on what’s fresh and
available. The proprietor is a bit Soup Nazi–ish, but her food is great —
supposedly, Tony Hawk calls this the best food on Maui. I don’t know if
I’d go that far, but it’s sure good. There’s a small but pleasant picnic area
where you can enjoy your eats. Makena Grill is usually open daily from
11 a.m. to “4-ish” — but it’s a lady with a cart and a few propane tanks,
so don’t blame me if she’s taken the day off.
The Dumps
It’s not a sexy name, but the Dumps makes a great spot for serious snor-
kelers in search of an off-the-beaten-path experience. This locals’ favorite
is part of the Ahihi-Kinau Natural Area Reserve, the Dumps isn’t a beach,
really. Instead, it’s an exposed cove with a bit of black sand, lots of lava
rock, and a wealth of mature coral offering some great snorkeling when
the winds are down and the turquoise water is clear.
Only confident swimmers should explore the Dumps, and then only early
in the day, when winds are down and visibility is best. Don’t get in the
water if the winds are kicking or there’s rough surge near the shoreline
(folks have been blown out to sea on windy days). Also, be sure to wear
reef shoes or other sturdy footwear for your walk out to the shoreline.
See map p. 152. Off Makena Road, just south of Ahihi Cove, just before the lava fields
begin; park along the roadside if there’s no space in the small lot.
Central and East Maui
These glorious sands are accessible from the Hana Highway, which runs
along the island’s lush North Shore.
Baldwin Beach Park
Despite the beauty of this gorgeous North Shore beach park — a long
ribbon of powdery white sands backed by swaying palms and fringed by
white-crested turquoise waves — it’s not usually crowded, except on week-
ends when local families come. The beach stretches for a good mile, so it
has plenty of room for everybody, especially because only locals and
intrepid visitors generally end up here. This is a terrific spot for swimmers
and body boarders, because the water is silky, warm, and gorgeous. But be
careful before venturing into the water and always heed the lifeguard,
because the undercurrent can be strong at times; it’s best to stay out of
the water altogether in the rough winter months. The winter water’s not
for inexperienced swimmers, but everybody can enjoy the beautiful set-
ting at any time of year. Facilities include restrooms and showers.
See map p. 192. On the Hana Highway (Highway 36), just east of Paia.
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 197

Hookipa Beach Park
Possibly the most famous windsurfing beach in the world, this small, gold-
sand beach at the foot of a grassy cliff attracts top windsurfers and wave
jumpers from around the globe with hard, constant winds and endless
waves that result in near-perfect wave-riding conditions. Come on weekday
afternoons to watch the local experts fly over the waves with their color-
ful sails; winter weekends host regular competitions. When the winter
waves die down, snorkelers and divers explore the reef. Even then, be
extremely careful because these waters are rough year-round; summer
mornings are best. Facilities include some rustic restrooms and showers,
plus pavilions, picnic tables, and barbecues. The lower parking lot is gen-
erally reserved for windsurfers and their equipment, so park in the upper
lot (see the following directions), where the high, grassy bluff offers a
better perch for watching the action anyway.
See map p. 192. Off Hana Highway (Highway 36), 2 miles east of Paia, about 6 miles
east of Haleakala Highway (Highway 37). To get there: Drive past the park and turn
left at the entrance at the far side of the beach, at the Hookipa Lookout sign.
Hamoa Beach
This remote, half-moon-shaped beach near the end of the Hana Road is
one of the most breathtakingly lovely in Hawaii, celebrated in writing by
no less than James Michener for its singular beauty. The Hotel Hana-Maui
likes to maintain the beach is its own, but it has to share, so feel free to
march right down the steps from the lava-rock lookout point and stake out
a spot on the open sand. Even if you don’t want to swim or sunbathe, come
to peek at this stunner from above: You’ll find surf that’s the perfect color
of turquoise, golden-gray sand, and luxuriant green hills serving as the
postcard-perfect backdrop. The beach is generally good for swimming and
wave-riding in the gentle seasons, but stick close to the shore at any time
of year, because you’re in open, unprotected ocean. Stay out of the water
entirely in winter. The hotel maintains minimal facilities for nonguests,
including a restroom.
See map p. 192. Off the Hana Highway (Highway 36), about 21⁄2 miles past Hana town.
To get there: Turn at the small white sign that says HAMOA BEACH and go about 11⁄2 miles
to the lava-rock lookout point; you can park on the roadside or in the dirt area across
the road. The stairs are just beyond the lookout point. (If you reach the steep serv-
ice road to the beach, you’ve gone too far.)
Discovering Water Fun for Everyone
If your hotel or condo doesn’t provide beach gear or beach toys, you
won’t have a problem finding a place to rent these items. In addition to
offering top-quality snorkel gear, Snorkel Bob’s (see contact information
in the next section) also rents body boards, beach chairs, coolers, and
umbrellas at its three Maui stores. Rental shacks on such popular
beaches as Kaanapali and Kapalua can also hook you up.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
198

Snorkeling
Maui is justifiably famous for its snorkel cruises to Molokini and Lanai,
both of which offer first-class fish-spotting, some of the best in the state
(see the “Ocean cruising to Molokini and Lanai and other on-deck adven-
tures,” later in this chapter). But anybody who’s already perused the
“Hitting the Beaches” section earlier in this chapter knows that Maui
offers a wealth of terrific snorkel spots that are accessible from shore.
Probably the best of these spots is Black Rock, at the north end of
Kaanapali Beach; also excellent are Honolua Bay, north of Kapalua;
Mokapu and Ulua beach parks, in Wailea; one of my lesser-known
favorites, Maluaka (sometimes called Makena) Beach, south of Wailea
in Makena; and the unsexily named The Dumps, a nice choice for experi-
enced snorkelers who want an off-the-beaten-path experience. (See
“Hitting the Beaches,” earlier.)
In addition, for those staying in West Maui, Napili Bay is worth seeking
out for its generally well-protected snorkeling and convenient access.
Take Highway 30 to mile marker 29, where you’ll see the Napili Center;
turn left and proceed to Lower Honoapiilani Highway; turn right and pro-
ceed a half-mile to the BEACH ACCESS signs on Napili Place and Hui Drive.
Park along the streets and take one of the beach access pathways to the
golden sand. No facilities.
In South Maui, Makena Landing, a popular spot for kayak launching, is
also a good spot for snorkelers who want to enjoy easy access. The best
offshore snorkeling is around the lava point on the right (north) side; if
you’re lucky, a short swim will reward you with sea turtles. There’s not
much beach here, but there are good facilities, including toilets, showers,
a small parking lot, and a pretty grassy area. To get there, follow Wailea
Alanui Drive until it turns into Makena Alanui Road; bear right at Makena
Road and park where you see the vans with the empty kayak carts.
In addition to Makena Landing and The Dumps, there is more good snor-
keling worth seeking out to the south. South of Oneloa Beach and The
Dumps, you’ll cross into black lava fields that mark the beginning of the
Ahihi-Kinau Natural Area Reserve. The best snorkeling in this area is
aptly named Fishbowl, a tiny but rich cove off Cape Kinau. It takes some
work to get there, however. The trailhead begins about a half-mile past
the parking area for the Dumps, where you’ll need to park. Walk along the
road to the trailhead, and then follow the mile-long lava trail to the shore-
line; wear good shoes, not flip-flops, because you’ll need toe protection.
Go early, before the winds kick up, and stay within the protected cove.
If you drive through the lava fields to the end of the road, you’ll eventu-
ally reach La Perouse Bay, whose black-sand beach and gorgeous
turquoise waters are well worth seeking out, even if just for a look.
Intrepid snorkelers can swim out to the outer coves for wonderful fish
viewing — some of the best on the island, in fact. However, don’t bother
getting in the water if you’re not able or willing to swim out, as the
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 199

underwater viewing at the end of the road is poor. Go early in the morn-
ing, and stay out of the water once the winds kick up. A few portable toi-
lets comprise the extent of the facilities.
Additionally, many of the island’s hotels and condo complexes sit on
coves excellent for snorkeling — and not just the super-expensive ones.
The affordable Mana Kai Maui in Kihei, for example, fronts a snorkeling
gem. Your hotel staff is sure to have recommendations.
For the most comprehensive guide to the best snorkel spots around the
island, stop into the Maui Dive Shop and pick up a copy of the free pub-
lication Maui Dive Guide. In the centerfold of the magazine-style guide 
is a map to all the best snorkel spots, with information on level of diffi-
culty, best water access points, facilities information, and all the details
you need to get there. Maui Dive Shop has four locations in West Maui,
including the new Lahaina Gateway Mall (% 808-661-5388) and Whaler’s
Village at Kaanapali (% 808-661-5117), and four locations in South Maui,
including Maalaea Harbor Village (% 808-244-5514) and the Shops at
Wailea (% 808-875-9904). To find the location nearest you, call % 800-
542-3483 or % 808-879-1775, or visit www.mauidiveshop.com.
If you want to take advantage of Maui’s offshore snorkeling opportuni-
ties, you probably need to rent some gear. My favorite rental-gear sup-
plier in Hawaii is Snorkel Bob’s; it rents the best-quality gear, with
friendly service and a refreshing dose of snarky humor thrown in for
good measure. Snorkel Bob’s maintains four Maui locations, with two in
West Maui. One is at Dickenson Square, at the corner of Dickenson and
Wainee streets, in Lahaina town (% 808-662-0104). The other West Maui
store is almost to Kapalua, in Napili Village, 5425 Lower Honoapiilani
Hwy. (% 808-669-9603). In South Maui, find Bob’s at Azeka Place 2, 1279
S. Kihei Rd. #310, North Kihei (% 808-875-6188), and at the Kamaole
Beach Center at Kihei Marketplace, 2411 S. Kihei Rd., between Rainbow
Mall and Dolphin Plaza, across from Kamaole I Beach Park and not too
far from Wailea (% 808-879-7449).
The best-quality gear — the “Ultimate Truth” — rents for $8 a day, or 
$32 a week ($22 per week for kids) for the mask/snorkel/fins set. For $12
more, nearsighted snorkelers can opt for prescription masks (including
snorkel and fins set). On the other hand, budget travelers can rent basic
gear for just $9 per week. If you can afford it, do yourself a favor and rent
the highest-quality gear. Spending the extra bucks is worth getting a mask
that doesn’t leak and a snorkel that doesn’t clog. Wetsuits and life vests
are also available. You don’t need to reserve gear in advance, but you’re
welcome to book your gear over the phone at % 800-262-7725 or online
at www.snorkelbob.com. The shops are open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
When you rent gear from Snorkel Bob’s, you can pick up a set of snorkel
gear at the start of your trip, carry it with you as you travel throughout
the islands, and then return it to another Snorkel Bob’s location on Oahu,
the Big Island, or Kauai. (All shops offer 24-hour gear return service.)
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
200

Any snorkel cruise or kayak outfitter supplies you with gear, but I highly
recommend renting your own set and bringing it aboard. Free gear is
almost universally bad — and can you think of anything worse than not
being able to see sea turtles or other cool creatures because of a crappy
mask? Spending the few extra dollars to rent a quality mask and snorkel
and fins that fit is worth every penny.
Keep these snorkel tips in mind as you head into the water:
 Make mornings your offshore snorkel time on Maui, because the
winds often start to kick up around noon, making surf conditions
rougher and less conducive to fish-spying.
 Always snorkel with a friend and keep an eye on each other.
 Look up every few minutes to get your bearings, check your posi-
tion in relation to the shoreline, and check for any boat traffic.
 If you’re not a strong swimmer, don’t be embarrassed to don a life
jacket while you snorkel.
 Don’t touch anything. Not only can your fingers and feet damage
coral, but also the coral can give you nasty cuts. Moreover, camou-
flaged fish and spiny shells may surprise you.
 Before you set out, check surf conditions by calling one of the local
dive or snorkel shops, such as Snorkel Bob’s, which can give you
the latest on local conditions and recommend alternative spots if
the prime ones are too rough for snorkeling.
Ocean cruising to Molokini and Lanai 
and other on-deck adventures
Maui boasts two top day-cruising destinations: the sunken offshore
crater Molokini, which is hugely popular among snorkelers and divers;
and the island of Lanai, terrific for snorkelers and sunbathers alike.
(Note that only Trilogy and Paragon take their guests onshore at Lanai;
other operators just anchor offshore for snorkeling in the surrounding
waters.) Both options offer excellent snorkeling opportunities, but I’d
choose a Lanai cruise in whale-watching season (from mid-Dec through
Apr), because the channel that separates Maui from Lanai is a favorite
hangout for wintering humpback whales.
Dramamine or nausea-prevention wristbands are an excellent idea 
if you’re prone to seasickness. A very important tip: If you opt for
Dramamine, be sure to take it with plenty of time for it to work, including
before the boat gears up for the return trip to Maui. After the return sail
is underway, it’s too late for the drug to do any good.
The outfitters listed in this section hardly scratch the surface of the glut
of cruise operators that sail from Maui. I consider these to be the best. If
you want additional options, contact the island’s most reliable activity
center, Tom Barefoot’s Tours, 250 Alamaha St. (at Wakea Street, south of
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 201

the Hana Highway), Kahului (% 888-222-3601 or 808-661-1246; www.
tombarefoot.com), which can also save you a few bucks by booking
you with some of the operators that I list.
All the sail-snorkel cruises I recommend are family-friendly, but Trilogy
boasts the kid-friendliest crew of them all.
Blue Water Rafting
Blue Water’s cruises are distinct for four reasons. First, this outfit takes
small groups of guests (no more than 24) out on fast-flying, rigid-hulled
inflatable boats for an exciting ride. Second, its Molokini Express cruises
arrive at Molokini in between the big boats’ trips, so passengers have the
perpetually overpopular crater largely to themselves. Third, the speed and
extra-maneuverability of its boats allows Blue Water to take you to South
Maui’s otherwise untouristed Kanaio Coast beyond Makena, where you’ll
visit sea caves and snorkel in pristine areas favored by sea turtles and
spinner dolphins on both Kanaio-only and Molokini-combination tours.
And lastly, the low-to-the-water boats put you as close as possible to tur-
tles and dolphins, as well as humpback whales in winter. This cruise is an
excellent choice for adventure-seekers in search of something different.
Cruises depart from Kihei Boat Landing, on South Kihei Road just south of Kamaole
III Beach Park (between Keonekai Street and Kilohana Drive), Kihei. % 808-879-7238.
www.bluewaterrafting.com. 2- to 51⁄2-hour raft cruises: $55–$119 adults,
$45–$99 kids 11 and under. Prices include deli lunch, plus continental breakfast on the
51⁄2-hour tour.
Maui Classic Charters
This company can offer you Molokini snorkel-sail experiences on two great
boats: The Four Winds II, a modern 55-foot, 149-person-capacity catama-
ran featuring a glass-bottom hull for on-ship viewing, a water slide, three
swim ladders, and barbecues; and the Maui Magic, a super-fast state-of-
the-art 54-foot, 71-passenger power catamaran with similarly cool features
in a more intimate environment. The Maui Magic cruises also include some
dolphin spotting on most trips. A naturalist accompanies the whale-
watching trips in season.
Cruises depart from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea. 
% 800-736-5740 or 808-879-8188. www.mauicharters.com. 31⁄2- to 5-hour cruises:
$42–$99 adults, $30–$79 kids 12 and under. Prices include continental breakfast and
barbecue lunch on longer cruises; beer, wine, and soda on all cruises. 15 percent
online discount available at press time for booking at least 7 days in advance.
Pacific Whale Foundation Eco-Adventures
If you consider yourself to be ecologically minded, you can’t do better than
to give your snorkel-cruise dollars to the Pacific Whale Foundation. This
nonprofit organization has been at the forefront of Maui-based whale
research, education, and conservation since the 1970s, and it also happens
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
202

to host very fine cruises. Its first-rate modern catamaran fleet offers some
of the best tours of Molokini and offshore Lanai. Its five-and-a-half-hour
Lanai snorkel-sail takes in the island’s less visited bays and includes a
search for wild dolphins in its regular itinerary. The five-hour Molokai trip
is as fine as any and includes a visit to a second snorkel spot, Turtle
Arches. Not only is a naturalist (at least one) always onboard, but the
entire crew is knowledgeable, ecoconscious, and friendly; the boats (each
of which carries 100 people maximum) even burn ecofriendly fuel. What’s
more, the cruises are great for beginning snorkelers because guides lead
fish talks and reef tours, and a wide variety of flotation devices are avail-
able. The winter whale-watching cruises are unparalleled, of course. You
simply can’t go wrong with these folks.
Departures from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea, and
Lahaina Harbor, on Front Street, Lahaina, depending on cruise. % 800-942-5311 or
808-249-8811. www.pacificwhale.org. Cruises: $50–$110 adults, $40–$70 kids
3–12. Kids 2 and under sail free, except on dinner cruise. Some cruises include con-
tinental breakfast and/or deli lunch.
Paragon Sailing Charters
Paragon is noted for its state-of-the-art, high-performance catamarans, inti-
mate gatherings (only 24–38 passengers, depending on the trip), and land-
ing rights at Manele Bay, which give the Lanai trip a special edge. (Trilogy
is the only other outfitter that lands on Lanai, and the only one that takes
you on an island tour.) This quality outfitter is a nice choice if you want to
embark on a Molokini cruise, an easy afternoon snorkel cruise, or a cham-
pagne sunset sail from Lahaina, too.
Departures from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea, and
Lahaina Harbor, on Front Street, Lahaina, depending on cruise. % 800-441-2087 or
808-244-2087. www.sailmaui.com. Cruises (which include drinks and hors d’oeu-
vres or full meals, depending on the outing you choose): $55–$154 adults, $28–$104
kids ages 4–12. Usually free for children 3 and under, but $20 fee applies to some
cruises. 15 percent online advance-booking discount available at press time.
Trilogy Excursions
Book these trips in advance, because Trilogy — the Mercedes of Maui
snorkel-sail operators — offers the island’s most popular snorkel-sail trips,
hands down. They’re the most expensive, too, but the quality is high. The
trips feature first-rate catamarans, top-quality equipment, great food, and
the best crew in the business. What’s more, Trilogy is the only Lanai cruise
operator other than Paragon (earlier) that’s allowed to land on the island’s
Hulopoe Beach, a terrific marine preserve that’s one of the best snorkel
and dolphin-watching spots in Hawaii, for a fun-filled day of sailing and
snorkeling. It’s also the only operator that can offer a ground tour of the
island (as part of the deluxe Ultimate Seafari). Certainly a quality experi-
ence, but I’ve heard some complaints recently that Trilogy has become a
little too slick and commercial for some tastes; book with a smaller opera-
tor, like Paragon, if you want a more intimate experience.
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 203

Trilogy also offers terrific half-day snorkel-sail trips to Molokini and unique
snorkel-sail trips off Kaanapali Beach. No matter which trip you take, you’ll
find that the Trilogy crews are knowledgeable (they always have a natu-
ralist on board), and the state-of-the-art boats are comfortable, well-
equipped, and meticulously maintained. All trips include a continental
breakfast (with home-baked cinnamon buns) and a very tasty barbecue
lunch (shipboard on the half-day trip, ashore on the Lanai trip). You should
know, however, that they may make you wear a flotation device no matter
how good your swimming skills are; if wearing a life jacket is going to
bother you, ask when you book.
Scuba upgrades are available for first-timers and certified divers alike on
most Trilogy excursions to Molokini ($59–$69).
Departures from Maalaea Harbor (at the Highway 30/130 junction), Maalaea; Lahaina
Harbor, on Front Street, Lahaina; or Kaanapali Beach, Kaanapali, depending on
cruise. % 888-225-6284 or 808-874-5649. www.sailtrilogy.com. Full-day Lanai
cruises: $208 adults, $104 kids 3–15, including barbecue lunch and island tour. (Deluxe
Ultimate Seafari version with Jeep safari and champagne return sail: $219 adults,
$110 kids.) Half-day Molokini or Kaanapali cruise: $121 adults, $61 kids. Scuba add-
ons available. Shorter Kaanapali sunset cruise: $65 adults, $33 kids; 2-hour Kaanapali
whale-watching cruise: $43 adults, $22 kids. 10 percent online-only 7-day advance-
booking discount available at press time.
Scuba diving
Molokini is one of Hawaii’s top dive spots thanks to calm, clear, pro-
tected waters and an abundance of marine life at every level, from clouds
of yellow butterfly fish to white-tipped reef sharks to manta rays. This
crescent-shaped crater has three tiers of diving: a 35-foot plateau inside
the crater basin (used by beginning divers and snorkelers), a wall sloping
to 70 feet just beyond the inside plateau, and a sheer wall on the outside
and backside of the crater that plunges 350 feet below the surface.
Other top dive spots include the pristine waters off the island of Lanai,
whose south and west coasts are a dream come true for divers looking
for a one-of-a-kind setting.
You need to book a dive boat to get to Molokini or Lanai. Lahaina Divers
(% 800-998-3483 or 808-667-7496; www.lahainadivers.com) is a five-
star PADI facility that such publications as Scuba Diving magazine have
lauded as one of Hawaii’s top dive operators. The company can take cer-
tified divers to Molokini or Lanai aboard one of its big, comfortable dive
boats for two- to four-tank dives ranging in price from $109 to $209; West
Maui dives start at $109. Instruction is available for divers of all experi-
ence levels, and the Discover Scuba package for beginners starts at just
$139 (check for Internet specials). Full open-water training packages are
also available, as well as specialty training in deep diving, underwater
photography, and more. Lahaina Divers is happy to take divers with dis-
abilities, too. They’ll also direct experienced, certified divers to Maui’s
best beach dives.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
204

Or contact Ed Robinson’s Diving Adventures (% 800-635-1273 or 808-
879-3584; www.mauiscuba.com/erd1.htm), which caters to certified
divers from a South Maui base. A widely published underwater photog-
rapher, Ed is one of Maui’s best; most of his business is repeat cus-
tomers. Ed offers personalized two-tank dives, three-tank adventures,
Lanai trips, and sunset and night dives; prices start at $130. Custom
dives are also available, plus discounts for multiday dives.
For two-tank boat dives to Molokini and nearby Maui waters, I also rec-
ommend Mike Severns Diving (% 808-879-6596; www.mikeseverns
diving.com), which takes 12 divers at a time out from Kihei in two
groups of six for a quiet and crowd-free experience. The price is $145,
including gear, with discounts available if you have your own equipment
or schedule multiday dives. Private charters are also available.
If you’ve never been scuba diving before but want to discover how, con-
tact either Lahaina Divers or Bobby Baker’s Maui Sun Divers (% 877-
879-3337 or 808-879-3337; www.mauisundivers.com). This outfit special-
izes in training beginners in small groups, and it offers introductory two-
tank dives for $110 and multiple-day starter and certification programs.
Ocean kayaking
My favorite kayaking trips are offered by Maui Eco Tours (% 808-891-
2223; www.mauiecotours.com), which offers a range of wonderful
guided kayak tours for beginning and more experienced kayakers and
snorkelers alike. I’ve found their guides to be some of the best out there;
ours got in the water with us at snorkel time and knowledgably narrated
our underwater tour, for a genuinely rich experience, instead of just
leaving us to our own devices to look-see. The three-hour Discovery
tour, which departs from South Maui’s Makena Landing, is ideal for first-
time kayakers and first-time-to-Maui kayakers alike. It’s $74 for adults
and $37 for kids under 12; there’s also an advanced adults-only Makena-
area tour called the Xplorer for $84 per person. Summer visitors might
consider the terrific Escapade trip, which explores gorgeous Honolua
Bay in Kapalua; this adults-only trip is $89 per person. Whale-watching
trips are also offered in winter — and there’s no getting closer to the
magnificent mammoths than on a kayak. Check online for Web specials
and on-sale dates, which can save you as much as 25 percent.
Another good kayaking outfitter for beginners and accomplished kayak-
ers alike is South Pacific Kayaks & Outfitters (% 800-776-2326 or 808-
875-4848; www.southpacifickayaks.com). South Pacific offers a range
of kayak tours that launch from both South and West Maui and incorpo-
rate whale-watching in winter. The excellent guides are all very knowl-
edgeable and ecology minded. What’s more, single and double kayaks
are both available, which is not always the case when you take a guided
tour (doubles are most common); let them know your preference when
you book. Tour prices run from $65 to $139 per person, with custom
options available.
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 205

If you’re an experienced kayaker capable of setting out on your own,
South Pacific can rent you single or double kayaks for $40 or $60 a day,
respectively. They’ll meet you at Makena Landing in South Maui at 7
a.m., and be there at noon to pick your kayak back up from you; call at
least a day in advance to reserve. Weekly rates and islandwide delivery
(for an additional charge) are also available.
If you’re hanging out in East Maui, contact Hana-Maui Sea Sports (% 808-
248-7711 or 808-264-9566; www.hana-maui-seasports.com), which offers
guided kayak and snorkel tours to one of the healthiest, most vital reefs 
in Hawaii daily at 11 a.m. for $120 per person. Tours leave from Hana Bay.
Advance reservations are highly recommended, because no more than six
to eight people are taken out at once. Reservations are also available
through the Hotel Hana-Maui activities desk.
Winter whale-watching
From January through April, the world’s largest mammals migrate from
frigid Alaska to balmy Hawaii. More than any other Hawaiian Island,
Maui is your best perch for spotting Pacific humpback whales in winter.
Because whales prefer water depths of less than 600 feet, these endan-
gered gentle giants come in relatively close to shore. You can see them
regularly from the beach in prime season, spouting and spyhopping
(peeking above the waterline to “spy” on what’s going on). They often
prefer the west, or leeward, sides of the islands.
From December through April, virtually all boats that operate from Maui
combine whale-watching with their regular adventures, and a good
number offer dedicated whale-watching cruises in season. Most notable
among the outfitters offering dedicated whale-watching cruises is the
Pacific Whale Foundation Eco-Adventures (% 800-942-5311 or 808-
249-8811; www.pacificwhale.org). (See the section “Ocean cruising 
to Molokini and Lanai and other on-deck adventures,” earlier in this
chapter.) The channel separating Maui from Lanai and Molokai is a
whale-watching hot spot, so Lanai cruises, in particular, are always an
excellent bet.
You don’t have to shell out the bucks for a pricey cruise to see whales.
In season, you can spot them right from shore. Just look out to sea —
just about any west-facing beach offers you a prime whale-watching
opportunity.
Follow these tips to increase your humpback-spotting chances:
 After you see a whale, keep watching in the same vicinity. They
travel in groups and often stay down for 20 minutes or so and then
pop back up to take in some air and play a little. Be patient, and
you’re likely to see several.
 Bring your binoculars from home. You see so much more with a
little magnification.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
206

 Pick a spot nearly anywhere along the West Maui coast for whale-
watching. Whales love to frolic in the channel separating the Valley
Isle from Molokai and Lanai. A great place to park yourself is
McGregor Point Scenic Overlook, a scenic lookout at mile marker
9 on the Honoapiilani Highway (Highway 30), on the way to Lahaina
from Maalaea. Another good West Maui whale-watching perch is
the straight part of Honoapiilani Highway, between McGregor Point
and Olowalu. However, do yourself and everybody else a favor, and
pull over to the side of the road before you look out to sea; whale-
spotting along the highway has caused more than a few accidents.
 The Pacific Whale Foundation (see earlier in this section) operates
a Whale Information Station at McGregor Point that’s staffed by
friendly and knowledgeable whale-expert naturalists, daily from
8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. from December through April. Just stop by —
they even have high-powered binoculars you can use, and they’re
happy to share whale-watching tips and facts galore. Call % 800-
WHALE-1-1 (800-942-5311) or 808-249-8811, or visit www.pacific
whale.org for more information.
Surfing
If you’ve always wanted to surf, Maui is a great place to fulfill the dream.
Surfers know Maui has the easiest surf in all Hawaii, making it an excel-
lent spot for many first-timers to learn.
The motto at the Nancy C. Emerson School of Surfing (% 808-244-
7873; www.mauisurfclinics.com) is, “If a dog can surf, so can you!” —
a dubious challenge, but a surprisingly comforting one, too. A pro inter-
national surfing champ, an instructor since 1973, a stunt performer in
movies like Waterworld, and a surf teacher to such celebs as Kiefer
Sutherland and Beau Bridges, Nancy has pioneered the technique of
teaching completely unskilled folks to surf in one two-hour lesson. You
can, really — I’ve seen it happen firsthand. The instructors are profes-
sional and personable; you’ll probably have your lesson on the beach
behind 505 Front St., in Lahaina, where the surf breaks are big enough
for beginners but not overwhelming. A beginning lesson starts at $100
per person for a one-hour private lesson, $165 for two hours, or $78 per
person for two hours with a group; I recommend going for the group
option. Experienced surfers can take full- and multiday private lessons
and group clinics with Nancy’s skilled instructors.
Action Sports Surf School (% 808-871-5857; www.actionsportsmaui.
com), with one location near the Kahului airport and one in Kihei, offers
everything from kiddie lessons to extreme tow-in and strap surfing les-
sons for experienced board riders; beginning lessons start at a very rea-
sonable $69 for a two-hour lesson. If you’re hanging out in East Maui,
contact Hana-Maui Sea Sports (% 808-248-7711 or 808-264-9566; www.
hana-maui-seasports.com). In addition to their excellent kayak and
snorkel tours, this terrific outfitter also offers surfing lessons by an
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 207

experienced surf instructor and certified lifeguard. Beginners are wel-
come. Reservations are also available through the Hotel Hana-Maui
activities desk.
Book your surfing lesson for early in your stay. That way, if conditions
aren’t right on your scheduled day, you have plenty of time to reschedule.
Expert surfers visit Maui in winter, when the surf’s really up. The best
surfing beaches include Honolua Bay, north of Kapalua; Maalaea, just
outside the breakwall of the Maalaea Harbor; and Hookipa Beach Park
in Paia, where surfers get the waves until noon, when the windsurfers
take over. If you have a bit of experience but don’t want a serious chal-
lenge, head to the 505 Front Street Beach, next to Lahaina Harbor in
Lahaina, where even long-surfing locals regularly catch the easy waves.
Second Wind Sail & Surf, 111 Hana Hwy. (between Dairy Road and
Hobron Avenue), Kahului (% 800-936-7787 or 808-877-7467; www.second
windmaui.com), has the best fleet of rental boards on the island ($20 per
day, or $110 for a week), and friendly service to boot.
For daily reports on wind and surf conditions, call the Wind and Surf
Report at % 808-877-3611.
Windsurfing and kiteboarding
Expert windsurfers will want to head to Paia’s world-famous Hookipa
Beach, known all over the globe for its brisk winds and excellent waves
in the afternoons. When the winds turn northerly, Kihei is the spot to
be; some days you can see whales in the distance behind the wind-
surfers. The northern end of Kihei is best. At Ohukai Park, the first
beach along South Kihei Road, the winds are good, the water is easy to
access, and a long strip of grass is available on which to assemble your
gear. If you have enough experience to head out on your own but you
want manageable waves, head to Kanaha Beach Park near the airport 
in Kahului, which is where all the top schools take their students.
You can find top-quality rental gear for windsurfing and kitesurfing from
Second Wind Sail & Surf, 111 Hana Hwy. (between Dairy Road and
Hobron Avenue), Kahului (% 800-936-7787 or 808-877-7467; www.
secondwindmaui.com). The company is also an excellent contact if you
want to arrange windsurfing lessons, for beginners and experienced
windsurfers alike, as well as kiteboarding lessons for experienced wave
riders. Action Sports Maui (% 808-871-5857; www.actionsportsmaui.
com) also offers lessons in windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as
paragliding for high-soaring adventurers.
Book your windsurfing or kiteboarding lesson for early in your stay. That
way, if conditions aren’t right on your scheduled day, you have plenty of
time to reschedule.

Sportfishing
Are you ready to head out on the open waves in search of big-game fish,
such as marlin, tuna, and wahoo? Hawaii Fishing Adventures and
Charters (% 877-388-1376; www.sportfishhawaii.com) can book a
first-class charter for you out of Maalaea or Lahaina harbors on Maui.
Half-day private charters start at $600.
Playing Safely in the Ocean
Even people with ocean experience should know a few things before
they plunge into Maui’s waters.
 Never, ever turn your back to the ocean. Big waves can come
seemingly out of nowhere and travel far upshore in a matter of min-
utes. Always keep one eye on the waves, even if you’re just beach-
combing or taking a casual stroll along the water’s edge. Never let a
younger child go into the ocean alone and always keep an eye on
your older children.
 Get out of the water when the swells come. Ocean conditions can
change in a few hours. Surf that was placid and safe for swimming
one day can be dangerous the next.
 Use the buddy system. Always swim with a partner.
 Swim at beaches with lifeguards. When swimming at an unfamiliar
beach, ask the lifeguard about the current conditions, and where
the safest place to swim is. If the beach doesn’t have a lifeguard,
ask other beachgoers, some of whom are likely to be locals. If no
one is around to ask, stay out of the water: Hidden rip currents,
undertows, and submerged rocks may turn a pleasant dip into a
disaster.
Shark!
Sharks aren’t a big problem in Hawaii. In fact, they’re so seldom seen
that locals actually look forward to spotting one. Since 1882, Hawaii has
only had 113 shark attacks, around 15 of which have been fatal (the last
one, at this writing, in 2004). When you realize that about 7.5 million visi-
tors play in Hawaii’s waters every year (not to mention the locals), that
number is infinitesimal.
Still, just to be on the safe side, use these good shark-avoidance tips:
 Don’t swim at sunrise, sunset, or where the water is murky.
Sharks may mistake you for lunch.
 Don’t swim alone. It’s never a good idea.
 Refrain from excessive splashing.
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 209

 Don’t swim with open wounds, or where bloody fish are in the
water. Surprise, surprise: Sharks become aggressive around blood.
 Get out of the water if turtles and fish are fleeing the area. As you
might expect, they’re pretty savvy about these things.
Avoiding things that sting
Most people manage to hang out in tropical waters without incident. But
if you do happen to run into a jellyfish, the pointy spine of a sea urchin,
or some sharp coral, take the following advice.
According to Hawaiian folklore, in order to treat certain ocean injuries,
the injured party should — I’m not making this up — urinate on the
wound. However, urinating on any sort of ocean wound (or probably any
wound, for that matter) won’t help, so don’t let anybody talk you into it.
Portuguese man-of-war
Portuguese man-of-war stings are painful and a nuisance but rarely
harmful; fewer than one in a thousand requires medical treatment. The
best prevention is to watch for these jellyfish as you snorkel or swim:
They’re a bluish-purple floating bubble with a long tail (look for the
hanging tentacles below the surface). Get out of the water if anyone near
you spots one because they tend to hang out in clusters. Also pay atten-
tion when walking near the water because even beached man-of-wars
can deliver a nasty sting.
Reactions to stings range from mild burning and reddening to severe
welts and blisters. Pick off any visible tentacles with a gloved hand, a
stick, or anything handy, rinse the sting with saltwater or fresh water,
and apply ice to prevent swelling and fight pain. Most man-of-war stings
disappear in 15 to 20 minutes. If pain persists or a rash or other symp-
toms develop, see a doctor.
Box jellyfish
These transparent, square-shaped bell jellyfish are nearly impossible to
see in the water. Fortunately, they seem to follow a monthly cycle: Eight
to ten days after the full moon, they appear in the waters on the leeward
side (the side away from the wind) of each island and hang around for
about three days. Also, they seem to sting more in the morning hours,
when they’re on or near the surface. The best prevention is to get out of
the water if you spot one.
Stings range from no visible marks to red hivelike welts, blisters, and
pain (a burning sensation) lasting from ten minutes to eight hours. To
treat a sting, start by pouring regular household vinegar on the affected
area; this action stops additional burning. Don’t rub the area with any-
thing. Then pick off any vinegar-soaked tentacles with a stick and apply
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
210

an ice pack for pain. Most box-jellyfish stings disappear by themselves
without any treatment, but see a doctor if you experience shortness of
breath, weakness, palpitations, muscle cramps, or any other severe
symptoms.
Punctures
Most sea-related punctures come from stepping on or brushing against
the needlelike spines of sea urchins. Be careful when you’re in the water;
don’t put your foot down (even if you have booties or fins on; the sea
urchin’s spines can puncture a wetsuit) if you can’t clearly see the
bottom.
A sea-urchin sting can result in burning, aching, swelling, and discol-
oration (black or purple) around the area where the spines broke off.
Pull out any protruding spines; the body absorbs any spines within 24
hours to three weeks, or the remainder of the spines will work them-
selves out. Again, if people recommend vinegar or urine, ignore them.
Cuts
The most common cuts are from corals. Take seriously any cut you get
in the ocean. Contrary to popular belief, coral can’t grow inside your
body; however, bacteria can — and very often does. The best way to
prevent cuts is to wear a wetsuit, gloves, and reef shoes. Never, under
any circumstances, should you touch coral. And never walk on coral,
even when you are wearing reef shoes. Not only can you cut yourself,
but also you can damage a living organism that took decades to grow.
The symptoms of a coral cut can range from a slight scratch to severe
welts and blisters. Gently pull the edges of the skin open and remove
any embedded coral or grains of sand with tweezers. Rinse the cut well
with fresh water (not ocean water). If the cut is bleeding, press a clean
cloth against it until it stops. If bleeding continues or the edges of the
injury are jagged, find a doctor.
Landlubbers’ curse: Seasickness
You’re not alone: Some 90 percent of the population tends toward sea-
sickness. The waters in Maui can range from calm as a lake to downright
frightening (in stormy conditions), but they usually fall somewhere in
between. Generally, expect rougher conditions in winter than in summer.
Afternoon seas can be very choppy year-round; the channel between
Maui and Lanai has caused at least a few snorkelers to upchuck their
barbecue lunch.
If you’ve never been out on a boat before, or if you’ve found yourself
seasick in the past, take the following precautions:
Chapter 12: Enjoying Maui’s Best Beaches and Watersports 211

The day before . . .
 Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and citrus and other acidic juices, as well
as greasy, spicy, or other hard-to-digest foods.
 Get a good night’s sleep.
That day . . .
 Use whatever seasickness prevention works best for you — pills, a
patch, an acupressure wrist band, ginger-root tea or capsules, or
any combination — before you board. After you set sail, using these
preventive measures generally isn’t going to help.
 After you’re onboard, stay as low and as near the center of the boat
as possible. Avoid the fumes (especially if it’s a diesel boat); stay in
the fresh air and watch the horizon. Don’t read.
 If you start to feel queasy, drink clear fluids like water and eat
something bland, such as a soda cracker.

M
aui is home to two of Hawaii’s most renowned attractions:
Haleakala National Park, a remarkable, otherworldly crater at the
heart of the island that offers an incredible, mystical view of sunrise and
sunset (not to mention one-of-a-kind hiking and biking fun); and the
Heavenly Road to Hana, one of the most scenic drives in the United
States.
Visiting Haleakala National Park
Haleakala (ha-lay-ah-kah-la) — the House of the Sun — is the massive
10,023-foot-high mountain that forms the core of Maui. It’s also one of
Hawaii’s two U.S. national parks (the other is the Big Island’s Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park), designated as such in 1961, and Maui’s biggest
natural attraction. Each year, some 2 million people drive to the summit
of Haleakala to peer down into the crater of the world’s largest dormant
volcano. (Its official status is “active but not currently erupting,” even
though Haleakala has remained dormant since 1790.) The crater is
impressive. At 3,000 feet deep, 71⁄2 miles long by 21⁄2 miles wide, and
encompassing 19 square miles, it could hold half of Manhattan. More
than anything, it resembles a barren moonscape.
This stark, rugged place is breathtakingly beautiful in its own way: a 
desolate, otherworldly canyon painted in hues of blue and green and
red. Just driving up the mountain is an experience in itself: The road
climbs from sea level to 10,000 feet in just 37 miles, and the views are
magnificent along the entire route. At first glance, the landscape looks
like nothing more than a dry and barren wasteland. But soon, a fascinat-
ing, multihued geologic world emerges — a surprisingly fragile one that
supports a number of the world’s rarest examples of flora and fauna.

Among the rare endangered species that call Haleakala home are the
nene (nay-nay), a gray-brown Hawaiian goose that doesn’t migrate,
prefers rock-hard lava beds to lakes, and is now protected as the state
bird, and the silvery-green, porcupiney silversword plant, which grows
only in Hawaii, lives for about 50 years, blooms once in a beautiful
purple bouquet, and dies.
Nene like to hang out around park headquarters, so you can spot one or
two there — if you don’t hear their distinctive call (“Nay! Nay!”) first.
Kalahaku Overlook (see the “Driving back down the mountain” section,
later in this chapter) is a good place to see silverswords. Please don’t
feed the nene and leave the silverswords where you see them.
Haleakala is best known for its mystical sunrise vistas. Crowds of visi-
tors drive here in the dark, predawn hours to watch the spectacle of
dawn breaking over the crater. If you decide to join the early-morning
crowds, stick around after sunrise for some excellent hiking opportuni-
ties. Or do what a lot of people do: Hop on a bike and coast down the
switchback road to the base of the mountain, enjoying magnificent views
as you go.
Sunrise at Haleakala has become so popular that the park was experienc-
ing theme-park crowds and L.A.-style gridlock in the predawn hours, seri-
ously damaging both the mood and the protected natural environment. In
response, the National Park Service instituted policies in late 2005 that
limited the number of vehicles allowed into the summit parking lots. You
should know that if lots are too crowded, there’s a chance — albeit a
small one — that you may be turned away at the entrance gate.
That’s the bad news. The good news is that the premium value of getting
up in the middle of the night to greet sunrise atop Haleakala is largely a
myth. Many — including yours truly — believe that sunset is actually
Haleakala’s finest hour. The crater is in shadow at sunrise; by sunset, it
has positioned itself to bring the colors of Haleakala into their full,
vibrant hues. Many consider Haleakala to offer the finest sunsets in
Hawaii — and sunset doesn’t offer the risk that sunrise holds, since the
cloud cover that might block a sunrise view can be difficult to evaluate
under cover of darkness. And best of all, you won’t be too exhausted 
to enjoy the fabulous views. (Another option is go up at night, when
stargazing from the summit can be spectacular. You might bring your
binoculars or rent a pair, and make the ascent if the sky is clear.)
The park actually contains two separate and distinct destinations:
Haleakala Summit and the Kipahulu Coast. Lush, green, and tropical,
Kipahulu is a world apart from the summit — and accessible only from
the east side of the island, near Hana. No road links the summit and the
coast, so Hana is a completely separate outing. I concentrate solely on
the summit-related info in the following sections. For a discussion of
Kipahulu and its biggest attraction, Oheo (oh-hay-oh) Gulch, see
“Driving the Heavenly Road to Hana,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 215

Preparing for your visit to Haleakala
For information before you go, contact Haleakala National Park at 
% 808-572-4400 for information on the Haleakala-summit (main) area of
the park (dial % 808-248-7375 for information and the ranger station at
the park’s Kipahulu district, near Hana, which is a completely separate
outing discussed in the section “Driving the Heavenly Road to Hana,”
later in this chapter). Or point your Web browser to the park’s official
Web site at www.nps.gov/hale. You can call to have camping and hiking
information sent to you in advance. You also can find plenty of useful
information at an unofficial but excellent site, www.haleakala.
national-park.com.
For the sunrise time and viewing conditions at Haleakala summit, call 
% 808-877-5111.
The summit of Haleakala is 37 miles, or about a one-and-a-half-hour
drive, from Kahului in Central Maui. To get there, take the Haleakala
Highway (Highway 37 and then Highway 377) to wiggly Haleakala Crater
Road (Highway 378), the heavily switchbacked road that leads you to
the 10,000-foot summit. Allow two hours to reach the summit if you’re
driving from Lahaina or Kihei, two and a half hours if you’re arriving
from Wailea or Kaanapali, and 15 minutes more if you’re coming from
Kapalua.
Admission to the park is $10 per car, which allows you to come and go
as you please for seven days. It’s $5 per person for individual walk-ins.
Keep these tips in mind as you plan your visit to Haleakala National
Park:
 If Maui is the first Hawaiian island you’re visiting, schedule your
sunrise visit for the first full day of your trip. Your body clock
won’t be on Hawaii time yet, so it shouldn’t be too hard to get up at
3 a.m. — because your body will still think that it’s anywhere from
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
216
The legend behind the House of the Sun
The name Haleakala actually means “House of the Sun.” The story of how this wild-
looking volcano got such a magnificent name goes like this: One day, a mom com-
plained that the sun sped across the sky so quickly that her tapa cloth didn’t have
enough time to dry. So in the predawn hours of the next morning, her thoughtful son,
the demi-god Maui, climbed to the top of the volcano. When the sun rose above the
horizon, Maui lassoed it, bringing it to a halt in the sky.
The sun begged Maui to let go. Maui said he would, on one condition: That the sun
slow its trip across the sky to give the island more sunlight. The sun agreed. In honor
of the agreement, islanders dubbed the mountain “House of the Sun.”

5 to 9 a.m. if you’re from the mainland. If Maui is the last island on
your itinerary, schedule your sunrise visit for the final day of your
trip, because you need to start reacclimating yourself to your at-
home hour anyway. Or, as I recommend earlier, simply opt for a visit
later in the day, so as not to disturb your normal sleep patterns.
 Dress warmly, in layers, no matter what time of year you visit.
Temperatures at the summit usually range between 40°F and 65°F
but can drop below freezing any time of year after you factor in the
wind chill, especially in the predawn hours. Wear a hat and sturdy
shoes and bring a blanket if you don’t have a warm jacket. The
weather is unpredictable at the summit, so be prepared for wind
and rain in winter, no matter what the time of day. Don’t be fooled
by the coastline conditions. Call % 808-877-5111 for the summit
forecast.
 Bring drinking water. You need plenty of water on hand, especially
if you plan on hiking.
 Remember that this locale is a high-altitude wilderness area. The
thinness of the air makes some people dizzy; you may also experi-
ence lightheadedness, shortness of breath, nausea, headaches, and
dehydration. The park recommends that pregnant women and
people with heart or respiratory problems consult a doctor before
ascending to high elevations.
 Fill up your gas tank before you head to Haleakala. The last gas
station is 27 miles below the summit at Pukalani. Fill up the night
before if you’re going for sunrise, because finding an open gas sta-
tion at 4 a.m. is nearly impossible.
If you want to explore the park thoroughly, you may want to consider
booking a Haleakala day hike with Hike Maui, Maui Eco-Adventures or
Maui Hiking Safaris; see the section “Enjoying Guided Nature Hikes,”
later in this chapter. If you’re interested in a stay near the park for a few
nights so that you can explore it more fully, you’ll find some accommo-
dations that fill the bill in Chapter 10.
Arriving at the park and making 
the drive to the summit
About a mile from the entrance is the Park Headquarters Visitor
Center, open daily from 8 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. It’s a great place to pick up
park information, including the latest schedule of guided walks and
ranger talks. If, however, you arrive before dawn, all you can do here is
use the round-the-clock restrooms; the ones here are much nicer than
the ones at the summit, so I highly recommend making a pit stop on the
way up. Drinking water is also available.
Traveling along Haleakala Crater Road, you pass two scenic overlooks
on the way to the summit. Stop at the one just beyond mile marker 17,
Leleiwi Overlook, if only to get out, stretch, and get accustomed to the
Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 217

heights. From the parking area, a short trail leads to a panoramic view of
the lunarlike crater. (The other overlook, Kalahaku, is most easily acces-
sible on the descent. Check out the “Driving back down the mountain”
section, later in this chapter.)
Continue on, and you’ll soon reach Haleakala Visitor Center, 11 miles
from the park entrance (open daily 6:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m.), which offers
spectacular views and some bare-bones restrooms. Park rangers also
offer excellent, informative, and free naturalist talks daily throughout the
day from the center. (Call ahead to confirm the next day’s schedule.)
The actual summit — and the ideal sunrise-viewing perch — is beyond
the turnoff for the visitor center, at Puu Ulaula Overlook (Red Hill). At
Puu Ulaula, a triangular glass building serves as a windbreak and the
best sunrise-viewing spot. After the spectacle of sunrise, you can often
see all the way to the snowcapped summit of Mauna Kea on the Big
Island if it’s clear. Haleakala Observatories (nicknamed Science City),
which isn’t open to the public, is also located there. This is also one of
the park’s best sunset-viewing perches.
Hitting the park’s trails
If you want to hike the park, I strongly suggest going with a guide. The
park is an outlandishly huge, empty place. You can view it better with
someone who can lead you in the right direction and help you under-
stand what you’re seeing. Park rangers offer a range of free guided hikes;
call for the latest schedule (% 808-572-4400) and to find out what to
wear and bring. (Sturdy shoes and water are musts.)
Also consider taking one of the guided Haleakala Crater hikes offered by
Hike Maui, Maui Eco-Adventures, and Maui Hiking Safaris. I really like
the extended views of the crater that professional guides offer on these
private tours. See the section “Enjoying Guided Nature Hikes,” later in
this chapter.
If you’re a regular hiker and you’re prepared for a challenge, consider
the Sliding Sands Trail. Its Hawaiian name is Keoneheehee Trail, but
this arduous trail is better known for its powdery cinder sands. The trail
starts at the bulletin board by the entrance to the summit parking lot.
It’s a 4-mile hike, descending a steep 2,800 feet to the valley floor. Your
best bet for a challenging but rewarding day hike is to take the trail 
21⁄2 miles in to Ka Luu o ka Oo, the first cinder cone along the trail, where
the shifting sands illuminate with vibrant color. This is a difficult trail
and weather shifts dramatically at the summit, so be sure to come pre-
pared with good hiking shoes, layered clothing (including rain protec-
tion), and plenty of sun protection and water.
If you don’t want to bother with a serious hike but just want a glimpse of
the park’s peculiar brand of natural beauty, take a half-hour walk down
the half-mile Hosmer Grove Nature Trail, which anybody can do. The
trail is well-marked, with placards that point out what you’re seeing
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
218

along the way. Ask the ranger at the visitor center to direct you to the
trailhead.
If you want to strike out on your own along the park’s more serious
trails, you can preview your options online at www.haleakala.
national-park.com (click on Hiking Guide) or call ahead. Rangers 
are always happy to provide you with complete trail information.
Driving back down the mountain
Put your rental car in low gear on the way down so that you don’t ride
your brakes.
Around mile marker 24 is Kalahaku Overlook, the best place to spot the
spiky, alien-like silversword plant, and to take in some fabulous
panoramic views.
At the mountain’s base, where you turn onto Haleakala Crater Road from
the Haleakala Highway, is Kula, the closest resemblance to a gateway
town that Haleakala has. Kula is most notable for its two restaurants,
Kula Sandalwoods Cafe and the Kula Lodge & Restaurant, both of which
serve great post-sunrise breakfast and lunch. (See Chapter 11 for more
information.)
Exploring the volcano by horseback
My absolute favorite way to explore Haleakala Crater is with Pony
Express Tours (% 808-667-2200; www.ponyexpresstours.com), which
offers guided trail rides down the crater’s Sliding Sands Trail, which
descends from the crater rim 2,500 feet to the crater floor, for a majestic
71⁄2-mile round-trip ride. The guides are friendly experts, and the horses
are good natured and extremely well taken care of; mine was an agree-
able red-haired boy named Leo, and my day exploring Haleakala with him
was the highlight of my last trip to Maui. These all-day Haleakala trail
rides are $182 per person, and require you to have at least minimal riding
experience; this is strictly a nose-to-tail ride, so as long as you know the
basics, you’ll be in good shape. Rides start daily at 8:30 a.m., with a
second ride offered on days that demand it. A two-hour paniolo ranch
ride is also offered for $110. Book well in advance — ideally, before you
leave home — in order to secure your spot on this terrific trip.
At press time, Pony Express was offering 10 percent off for those who
booked their trips online.
Biking down the volcano
Another great way to experience Haleakala is to cruise down it, from
summit to base, on a bicycle. The guided ride is quite an experience,
with stunning views the entire way. And you don’t need to be an expert
cyclist to do it; you just have to be able to ride a bike. In fact, you barely
have to pedal — you’ll coast down at a nice, leisurely pace. (The con-
stant switchbacks keep you from picking up too much speed.)
Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 219

These tours used to be offered from Haleakala’s summit at sunrise and
throughout the day, but the National Park Service has suspended all
tours from within Haleakala National Park following a glut of increased
traffic. As of this writing, most bike tours start at 6,500 feet elevation,
just outside the park entrance. The trips are still quite fun, but you have
to start the day atop Haleakala on your own. I’m sure that the big outfit-
ters will reinstate full service as soon as the National Park Service
allows; check the outfitters’ Web sites or call for further information.
Maui’s oldest downhill company is Maui Downhill (% 800-535-2453 or
808-871-2155; www.mauidownhill.com). Maui Downhill offers a variety
of guided Haleakala bike “safaris” at sunrise, midday, and sunset, run-
ning from $125 to $195 per person. Other reliable companies include
Maui Mountain Cruisers (% 800-232-6284 or 808-871-6014; www.maui
mountaincruisers.com) and Mountain Riders (% 800-706-7700 or
808-242-9739; www.mountainriders.com). Prices usually include hotel
pickup, transport to the top, all equipment, meals, and drop-off.
Generally, riders have to be at least 12 and at least 4'10" tall. Younger
kids and pregnant women can usually ride along in the van.
At press time, you could save a bundle on most of these tours by book-
ing in advance via most of these companies’ own Web sites (for example,
Maui Downhill was offering $30-per-person discounts on its $125 tours!).
Coasting down Haleakala can be an incredible ride, and thousands of
people come home from Maui every year claiming that it was the high-
light of their trip. Still, you should know a few things before you book
one of these trips. I’m not trying to discourage you, by any means; I just
want you to know exactly what to expect:
 Virtually all the outfitters advertise these trips as safe, no-strain
bicycle rides that anyone can do, even Grandma. However, these
downhill bike tours do require some stamina, particularly in winter.
Conditions can be harsh, and you have to stay in line and keep
pace with the other riders as cars go by. (Drivers are usually quite
respectful, so you don’t have to worry about dodging traffic.) Even
from 6,500 feet, the trip makes for a quite a long day.
 Summer and fall — when drive conditions and relatively mild tem-
peratures usually prevail — are the best seasons for Haleakala
downhill rides. Even though the better outfitters provide you with
slick jumpsuits and headgear to protect you from the rain that
you’ll almost inevitably encounter at some point, count on getting
cold and wet in winter and spring.
Driving the Heavenly Road to Hana
No road in Hawaii is more celebrated than the Hana Highway (Highway
36), the supercurvaceous, two-lane highway that winds along Maui’s
northeastern shore, offering some of the most scenic natural sightseeing
in the entire state.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
220

The Hana Highway winds for approximately 52 miles east from Kahului,
in Central Maui, crossing more than 50 one-lane bridges, passing greener-
than-green taro patches, magnificent seascapes, gorgeous waterfalls,
botanical gardens, and rain forests before passing through the little town
of Hana and ultimately ending up in one of Hawaii’s most beautiful tropi-
cal places: the Kipahulu section of Haleakala National Park. Kipahulu is
home to Oheo Gulch, a stunning series of waterfall pools that tumble
down to the sea. (See the section “Venturing beyond Hana: Hamoa Beach
and Oheo Gulch,” later in this chapter.)
Despite the draws at the end of the road, this drive is about the journey,
not the destination. The drive from end to end takes at least three hours,
but allow all day for it. If you race along just to arrive in Hana as quickly
as you can, you’ll be as perplexed as so many others who just don’t
understand all the hype. Start out early, take it slow and easy, stop at the
scenic points along the way, and let the Hana Road work its magic on
you. It will — I promise.
Take these points into consideration as you plan your Hana Road trip:
 Leave early. Get up just after dawn, have an early breakfast
(Charley’s in Paia opens at 7 a.m.; see Chapter 11), and hit the road
by 8 a.m. If you wait until midmorning to leave, you’ll get stuck in
bumper-to-bumper Hana Road traffic, you won’t have enough time
to enjoy the sights along the way, and you’ll arrive at Oheo Gulch
too late in the day to take a hike or a dip. To make the most of the
daylight hours, leave early, particularly in the winter when days are
shortest.
 Consider booking a place to stay in Hana if you really want to
take your time. If you book a room, you can head out to Hana
against the traffic in the afternoon, stay for a couple of nights so
that you have a full day to enjoy East Maui’s attractions (including
an abundance of peace and quiet), and meander back at your own
pace (once again avoiding the traffic) on the morning of the third
day. (See Chapter 10 for recommendations.)
 Fill up on gas before you set out. If all else fails, make sure that
you stop in Paia, just east of Kahului, because the next gas station
is in Hana — 44 miles, 50-some bridges, and 200-plus hairpin turns
down the road.
 Don’t bother if it’s been raining heavily. The Hana Highway is well
paved and well maintained but can nevertheless be extremely dan-
gerous when wet — and you can easily get stuck in muddy shoul-
ders and pull-offs.
 Bring your bathing suit in warm weather. You’ll find a number of
waterfall pools along the way that are ideal for a refreshing dip, and
folks love to swim in Oheo Gulch’s placid summer pools.

Part IV: Exploring Maui 
222
 Only enter waterfall pools in the calmest ranger-approved condi-
tions. A mainland visitor was washed away to sea during a seemingly
innocuous Oheo Gulch photo op in 2002. Always check with the
rangers before you go in the pools. And if water seems to be running
between the pools at all, stay out.
 Bring mosquito repellent. Lush East Maui is a buggy place.
 Leave your road rage on the mainland. Practice aloha as you
drive the Hana Road: Give way at the one-lane bridges. Wave at
passing motorists. Let the locals who drive this road with jaw-
dropping speed and who pass on blind curves have the right-of-
way. If the guy behind you blinks his lights, let him pass. And don’t
honk your horn — it’s considered rude in Hawaii.
There’s one exception to the no-horn-honking rule: If you reach a blind
curve, do honk your horn to indicate that you’re coming around the
bend — and proceed slowly.

Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 223
If you want some narration to accompany what you’re seeing along the
road to Hana, pick up a Hana CD Guide on your way out of town. The
90-minute CD is $20 at the Hana Cassette Guide Shop in Kahului on
Dairy Road (Highway 380), next to the Shell service station just before
the Hana Highway (% 808-572-0550). It also comes with an accompany-
ing detailed map of the coast and a flora guide that’s worth the value of
the purchase alone. I highly recommend using it in tandem with the text
in this chapter because it covers many more sights and gives much
more background than I have the space to include. Along with the
recorded tour, you get the Hana Road map and flower guide. The Hana
CD Guide Shop also has a recorded guide to Haleakala available; it opens
daily at 3 a.m. to accommodate the earliest risers.
Try this route-reversal strategy: Drive directly to Oheo Gulch, at the end
of the road, without stopping. Explore Hana and Oheo Gulch in the
morning. Head out of Hana right after lunch and do your meandering on
the way home, against traffic. The disadvantage of this strategy is that,

for some, the gorgeous scenery can lose some of its magic by afternoon:
You’re tired, and you’ve been in the car a long time — you know how 
it goes.
The south route to and from Hana — which is officially Highway 31, but
most folks call it the Kaupo (cow-po) Road — was closed at press time
due to 2006 earthquake damage. If you’re interested in checking it out as
a route back to the resorts from Hana, check with your hotel or rental-
car company regarding potential reopening and current road conditions.
It’s usually fine if the weather has been clear, but stay away if it’s been
raining because unpaved sections of the road can wash out. And check
with your rental-car company before you set out; many rental contracts
actually forbid customers from driving their cars on Kaupo Road, so if
you get stuck, the cost for the tow will be your responsibility.
If you want to see the Hana Road but you just don’t want to drive it your-
self, consider taking a guided van or bus tour. See the section called
“Taking a guided van or bus tour on the road to Hana,” later in this chap-
ter, for recommended tour operators.
Setting out from Kahului
A half-dozen miles east of Kahului on the Hana Highway is Paia (pa-ee-
ah), a former mill town that’s now a neohippie, boutique-dotted surf
spot. Charley’s Restaurant & Saloon, at Baldwin Avenue in the heart 
of town, makes an ideal stop for a hearty breakfast (see Chapter 11).
Afterward, you can bop around the corner to 30 Baldwin Ave., where
Café Mambo (% 808-579-8021) offers sandwiches and box lunches for
you to take on the road. Another excellent stop for a morning muffin,
coffee, or a lunch to take with you is Moana Bakery & Cafe, 71 Baldwin
Ave. (% 808-579-9999). I enjoy the heavenly mango-blueberry scones
here, but the whole Moana menu is delightful.
After you leave Paia, the road bends into an S-turn, where you see the
entrance to Mama’s Fish House, marked by a restored boat with Mama’s
logo on the side. Mama’s is one of my favorite Maui restaurants, even
though it’s pricey; see the review in Chapter 11. Mama’s also has an inn
(see Chapter 10).
Just beyond Paia is Hookipa Beach Park, one of the greatest windsurf-
ing spots on the planet; see Chapter 12. World-championship contests
are held there, but on nearly every windy afternoon, you can watch
dozens of colorful windsurfers dancing in the breeze. To watch them,
don’t stop on the highway, but go past the park and turn left at the
entrance on the beach’s far side. You can park on the high, grassy bluff
or drive down to the sandy beach and park alongside the pavilion. The
park also has restrooms, a shower, picnic tables, and a barbecue area.
The road narrows to one lane in each direction and starts winding around
mile marker 3. But at mile marker 16, the curves really begin, one right
after another. Slow down and enjoy the bucolic surroundings.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
224

Following the road to Hana
After mile marker 16, the highway number changes from 36 to 360 and
the mile markers start again at 0 (I have no idea why). I follow suit and
include the 0 in this section.
At mile marker 2: The first great place to stop is Twin Falls, on the
road’s inland side; the Twin Falls Fruit Stand marks the spot. Hop over
the short ladder on the right side of the red gate and walk about 3 to 
5 minutes to the waterfall off to your left, or continue on another 10 to
15 minutes to the second, larger waterfall. You may notice a NO TRESPASS-
ING sign at the gate, but the sign doesn’t seem to bother the crowds. If it
bothers you, skip Twin Falls altogether; you have plenty more to see
that’s not so marked farther down the road.
Just before mile marker 4: On a blind curve, look for a double row of
mailboxes on the left-hand side by the pay phone. Down the road lies
the remote, rural community of Huelo, embraced by Waipo and Hoalua
bays. This fertile area was once home to a population of 75,000. Today,
only a few hundred live in this serene small town, where you find a few
B&Bs and vacation rentals (see Chapter 10).
After mile marker 4: The vegetation grows lusher as you head east. This
area is the edge of the Koolau Forest Reserve, where the branches of 
20- to 30-foot-tall guava trees are laden with green (not ripe) and yellow
(ripe) fruit, and introduced eucalyptus trees grow as tall as 200 feet.
The upland forest gets 200 to 300 inches of rainfall annually, so you
begin to see waterfalls around just about every turn as you head east
from here. The one-lane bridges start, too; so drive slowly, and yield to
oncoming cars.
After mile marker 6: Just before mile marker 7 is a forest of waving
bamboo. Bamboo was originally brought to Hawaii by the early
Polynesians for construction purposes; during the plantation era,
Chinese laborers used bamboo for food and construction alike. The
sight of this grove is so spectacular that drivers are often tempted to
take their eyes off the road, so be very cautious. Just after mile marker 7,
you can pull over at the Kaaiea Bridge, which offers a terrific view of the
bamboo grove.
At mile marker 8: Mountain Apple trees grow along the ocean side of
the road near here. Don’t be surprised if you see locals fishing ripe fruit
from the trees with long poles. In the summer months, the trees shed
their flowers, covering the surrounding ground in a deep red hue.
There’s another grove on the ocean side of the road near mile marker 11.
At mile marker 9: The sign says Koolau State Forest Reserve, but the
real attraction is the Waikamoi Ridge Trail, an easy and well-marked 
3⁄4-mile loop. This place is great to stretch your legs; look for the turnout
on the right. There’s another picturesque grove of bamboo just before
this mile marker.
Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 225

At mile marker 10: Park at the bridge and take the short walk up the
stone wall–lined trail to 30-foot Puohokamoa Falls, tucked away in a
fern-filled amphitheater surrounded by banana trees, colorful heliconias,
and fragrant ginger. It isn’t always running, but the gorgeous pool is a
great place to take a plunge.
As you continue on the Hana Highway, the road winds through banana
patches, cane grass blowing in the wind, vibrant ferns, and forests of
guava trees, avocados, kukui trees, palms, and Christmas berry.
Between mile markers 10 and 11: At the halfway point, on the road’s
inland side, is the Garden of Eden Arboretum and Botanical Garden
(% 808-572-9899; www.mauigardenofeden.com), with more than 500
exotic plants, flowers, and trees from around the Pacific (including sev-
eral wild ginger plants and an impressive palm collection) on 26 acres.
You can drive through the garden in about five minutes, walk its main
loop in about 20 minutes, or stay a bit longer and follow any number of
nature trails. The garden is open daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., and admis-
sion is $10 per person. A fruit and smoothie stand offers refreshments at
the gate.
Just beyond mile marker 12: Kaumahina State Wayside Park has
portable toilets and picnic tables at the large parking area, plus a gor-
geous view of the rugged coastline across the road.
Near mile marker 14: One of my favorite stops on the entire drive is
Honomanu Bay, a stark rocky beach popular with net fishermen that
faces a beautiful bay. Tear your eyes away, and you find incredible
golden-green cliffs forming an intense backdrop as you look inland and
up. The turnoff is on the left, at the stop sign just after the mile marker;
don’t attempt the rutted and rocky road if it has been raining recently.
Swimming is best in the stream inland from the ocean because of strong
rip currents offshore.
Between mile markers 16 and 17: Farther along the winding road,
between mile markers 16 and 17, is a cluster of bunkhouses composing
the YMCA Camp Keanae (% 808-242-9007; www.mauiymca.org). The
bunkhouses, which sleep 4 to 60, are available to budget travelers; there
is also an affordable oceanview cottage available for rent. A quarter-mile
down is the Keanae Arboretum, an excellent spot to experience the
tropical flora of the islands. The region’s botany is divided into three
parts: native forest; introduced forest; and traditional Hawaiian plants,
food, and medicine. You can swim in the pools of Piinaau Stream or walk
a mile-long trail into Keanae Valley, where a lovely tropical rain forest
waits at the end.
If you have time to spare, the old Hawaiian village of Keanae stands
frozen in time, one of the last coastal enclaves of native Hawaiians. They
still grow taro in patches and pound it into poi (the staple of the old
Hawaiian diet), pluck opihi (limpet) from tide pools along the jagged
coast, and cast throw nets at schools of fish. The turnoff to the Keanae
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
226

Peninsula is on the left, just after the arboretum. The road passes by
farms and banana bunches as it hugs the peninsula. Where the road
bends, you notice a small beach where fishermen gather to catch dinner.
A quarter-mile farther is the Keanae Congregational Church, built in
1860 of lava rocks and coral mortar, standing out in stark contrast to the
green fields. Beside the church is a small beachfront park, with false
kamani trees against a backdrop of black lava and a rolling turquoise
ocean.
Just beyond mile marker 17: Keanae Overlook is a wide spot on the
road’s ocean side where you can see the entire Keanae Peninsula jutting
out into the sea, with its checkerboard pattern of green taro fields and
its ocean boundary etched in black lava. If time is precious, though, wait
to stop after mile marker 19, where the view from the Wailea Valley
viewpoint is even better.
Between mile markers 17 and 18: The road widens, and fruit and flower
stands begin to line the road. Many of these operate on the honor
system: You select your purchase and leave your money in the basket. I
recommend stopping at Waianu Fruit Stand, on the mountain side of
the road just past Keanae Arboretum, or Uncle Harry’s Fruit Stand, just
beyond the old Keanae School on the ocean side of the road. Harry
Kunihi Mitchell was a legend in his time, an expert in native plants who
devoted his life to the Hawaiian-rights and nuclear-free movements.
A quarter-mile after mile marker 19: For the best view of the Wailua
Peninsula and its verdant taro fields, stop at the Wailua Overlook and
parking area on the road’s ocean side, where sun-dappled picnic tables
serve up great views.
A bit farther down the road, just before the bridge on the inland side, is
a pretty waterfall view.
Between mile markers 22 and 23: At Puaa Kaa (poo-ah-ah ka-ah) State
Wayside Park, the splash of waterfalls provides the soundtrack for a
small park area with restrooms and a picnic area. On the opposite side
of the road from the toilets is a well-marked and paved path that leads
through a patch of sweet-smelling ginger to the falls and a swimming
hole.
At mile marker 24: A pretty waterfall on the mountain side of the high-
way offers a nice roadside photo op.
After mile marker 25: After the mile marker, turn toward the ocean at
the steep turnoff just before the one-lane bridge and follow the well-
paved but winding road 21⁄2 miles down to the Old Nahiku Lookout, one
of the very few points along the entire route that lets you get close to
the ocean, and the finest picnic spot on the entire route. A small, grassy
lawn faces rocky lava points and crashing turquoise surf for a breathtak-
ing, up-close view. Don’t swim there, but you can walk down to the rocky
beach at the backside of the parking lot.
Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 227

Near mile marker 29: A series of locally operated open-air shopping
stalls sit alongside the Nahiku Ti Gallery, on the ocean side of the high-
way. The gallery is rife with low-cost, nothing-special souvenirs and a
small take-away cafe, but the shopping stalls contain some real gems.
You’ll find fruit stands with fresh-from-the-trees tropical bounty, plus
homemade coconut candy coated in pure Hawaii cane sugar; this local
sweet treat is simply delicious. There’s also an island taco stand featur-
ing yummy fresh-caught fish, chicken, and slow-cooked kalua pig tacos
(open daily except Thurs).
At mile marker 31: Turn toward the ocean on Ulaino Road and go a half-
mile to Kahanu Garden, one of four National Tropical Botanical Gardens
in Hawaii (% 808-248-8912; www.ntbg.org). Surrounded by a native pan-
danus forest (the leaf that lauhala products are woven from), the garden
features a remarkable collection of ethno-botanical plants from the Pacific
islands (with a particular concentration on plants of value to the people of
Polynesia and Micronesia), plus the foundation of Poolanihale Heiau, the
largest Hawaiian temple in Hawaii. The self-guided walking tour is $10
(free for kids 12 and under) and takes 30 to 40 minutes to complete; it’s
open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The road that leads to
the garden entrance is rough and unpaved, but not bad; still, don’t bother
if it’s been raining.
At mile marker 32: The turnoff for 122-acre Waianapanapa (why-ah-na-
pa-na-pa) State Park, on the ocean side of highway, leads to shiny black-
sand Waianapanapa Beach, overlooking Pailoa Bay, whose bright-green
jungle backdrop and sparkling cobalt water make for quite a stunning
view. On hand are picnic pavilions, restrooms, trails, and fruit stands
lining the road, so come down to take a peek. The beach isn’t for swim-
ming, though. A blowhole appears when the winter surf kicks up. This
natural hole in the rocks is configured so that when harsh surf kicks up,
water shoots through the hole like a spout — quite an interesting sight.
There’s also a nice little loop trail leading to Waianapanapa Caves.
Arriving in Hana
Postage stamp–size Hana is a lush and charming little hamlet, but
frankly, the town doesn’t have much to see. As I state elsewhere in this
chapter, the drive to Hana is more about the drive and less about Hana.
The few attractions include the Hana Coast Gallery, on the Hana
Highway adjacent to the Hotel Hana-Maui (% 808-248-8636; www.hana
coast.com), an excellent showcase for fine arts and island-made prod-
ucts hewn by master craftspeople, including gorgeous woodworks. The
quirky Hasegawa General Store (% 808-248-8231) is worth stopping in
for kicks (look for the Spam sushi vending machine near the entrance)
or to use the ATM, but the prices on practical items and munchies are
better across the road and up the hill at the Hana Ranch Store (% 808-
248-8261). If you want a meal, there’s the casual Hana Ranch Restaurant
or the gourmet Ka’uiki, the main dining room at the Hotel Hana-Maui
(for details, see Chapter 11).

Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 229
Across the street from the Hotel Hana-Maui is a cattle pasture dominated
by a hill. Crowning the hill is a majestic stone cross known as Fagan’s
Cross. The cross was built in honor of Paul Fagan, who saved the Hana
economy following the death of the sugar industry by introducing cattle
ranching to the region. A paved path leads across the pasture and
around the hill to the summit, offering a cardio-stimulating walk and a
captivating view over Hana as a reward. This hotel is on Hana Ranch
land, so hikers are welcome to cross the gate to reach the path. The
walk takes brisk hikers about an hour round-trip; be sure to bring water
and wear a hat, because the sun can get harsh, even on mild days, and
there’s little cover along the path.
History buffs may want to head toward Hana Bay; overlooking the bay is
the Hana Cultural Center and Museum, 4974 Uakea Rd., near the turnoff
to Hana Bay (% 808-248-8622; www.hookele.com/hccm), open daily
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (most of the time). This charming museum is dedi-
cated to preserving the history of Hana, with exhibits showcasing tradi-
tional Hawaiian quilts and such implements of life as poi boards and fish

hooks carved out of the tusks of wild pigs. Also on-site are the Old Hana
Courthouse and Jailhouse and four hale (living structures), where you
can see what it was like to live in the style of Hana’s earliest settlers.
Admission is $2 (free for kids 12 and under).
Hana Bay is a favorite playground of locals, although visitors tend to
prefer prettier Hamoa Beach, a bit farther down the road. Protecting the
far east side of the Hana Bay is Kauiki Head, an ironwood-covered hill
that also marks the birthplace of Hawaii’s Queen Kaahumanu in 1768.
If you want to see more of what’s available in town, pick up a copy of the
Hana Visitors Guide, a foldout map and pamphlet that’s available free
around town. If you don’t run across one, stop into Hasegawa’s to pick
one up.
If you’re spending some time in these parts, you’ll be glad to know that a
number of active adventures are available:
 Hang Gliding Maui (% 808-572-6557; www.hangglidingmaui.
com) offers tandem instructional flights aboard its engine-powered
ultralight aircraft. Prices are $130 for a 30-minute lesson, $220 for
an hour-long lesson.
 Hana Lava Tube (% 808-248-7308; www.mauicave.com) offers the
chance to take a 30- to 45-minute self-guided tour ($12 adults, free
for kids 5 and under) through Hana’s ancient underground lava-tube
system. Open Monday through Thursday 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. No
reservations are needed, but call a day ahead just to confirm that
the caves will be open; occasionally, they’re open on Sunday, too.
 If you’re in Hana on a Monday or Thursday afternoon and you fancy
organically grown fruits, consider a tour of Ono Organic Farms
(% 808-248-7779; www.onofarms.com). This certified organic farm
offers guided tasting tours of its fruit orchards and coffee farm
twice a week (usually Mon and Thurs) at 2:30 p.m. The cost is $35
per person; kids 9 and under visit for free. Reservations are required.
Taking a guided van or bus tour on the road to Hana
If you’ve rented a car and can get around easily on your own, driving
around the island is definitely the preferable way to go.
But you may want to hook up with a guided tour if your mobility is lim-
ited, if you’re traveling solo and don’t want to make the drive to Hana on
your own, or if you just want to kick back and let somebody else take the
wheel.
The downside of taking a guided tour is that you have little or no control
over where you go and how long you stay, and your time communing
with nature at some of Hawaii’s finest natural spots may be limited. Still,
for some people, a guided tour is the best way to see Haleakala National
Park or take in the glories of the Heavenly Road to Hana.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
230

For small-scale, local-led van tours of the Heavenly Road to Hana and
Haleakala National Park, book your guided trip with family-owned Ekahi
Tours (% 888-292-2422 or 808-877-9775; www.ekahi.com). One of the
great advantages of its Hana tour is that it’s a circle island tour when
weather permits; if the going’s good, you’ll not only drive the road to
Hana, but also experience the desert landscape of the little-traveled
back road on the return trip, which takes you along the south coast and
around the back side of the Haleakala volcano. Ekahi can take you not
only to Hana but also to hidden Keanae, a halfway-to-Hana tour that
offers an insightful look at Maui’s rural past and present. Sunrise tours of
Haleakala Crater are also on offer. Ekahi tour prices range from $101 to
$130 adults, $75 to $99 kids 10 and under, depending on the tour you
choose; prices include a deli lunch. Discounts are available for seniors
61 and over.
Now offering guided bus tours statewide, Polynesian Adventure Tours
(% 800-622-3011 or 808-877-4242; www.polyad.com) was the first to
offer guided tours along the Heavenly Road to Hana and is still going
strong. In addition to the Hana option, it offers both Haleakala sunrise
and Iao Valley tours in minivans, big-windowed minicoaches, and full-
size luxury buses. Prices run $76 to $99 for adults, $52 to $60 for kids
ages 3 to 11. Book your Polynesian Adventure Tour online to get a 10
percent price break.
Venturing beyond Hana: Hamoa Beach 
and Oheo Gulch
About 21⁄2 miles past Hana is the turnoff for Hamoa Beach, one of the
most gorgeous beaches in all Hawaii — and great for swimming, to boot
(in summer, anyway). For details, see Chapter 12.
About 10 luxuriant miles past Hana along the highway is Oheo Gulch, a
dazzling series of waterfall pools cascading into the sea. Some folks call
this the Seven Sacred Pools, even though it has more like two dozen.
This area is the Kipahulu district of Haleakala National Park (www.nps.
gove/hale), and a ranger station located at the back of the unpaved
parking lot (% 808-248-7375) is staffed daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Restrooms are available, but no drinking water, so pick some up in Hana
if you’re out. You don’t have to pay a fee to visit the park.
The easy, half-mile Kuloa Point Loop Trail leads to the lower pools,
where you can take a dip when the weather is warm and the water is
placid. This well-marked 20-minute walk is a must for everyone.
Stay out of the Oheo Gulch pools in winter or after a heavy rain, when
the otherwise placid falls can wash you out to sea in an instant, to the
waiting sharks below. (No kidding — they actually do hang out in the
brackish water at the foot of the falls.) No matter what the season, if you
do take a dip, always be extra vigilant; keep an eye on the water in the
streams. Even when the sky is sunny near the coast, upland rain can
cause floodwaters to rise in minutes, so if the water seems to be running

between the pools at all, stay out. As I mentioned earlier, a mainland visi-
tor was washed away to sea from Oheo Gulch in May 2002. Don’t let this
terrible tragedy be repeated; always check with the rangers before you
go in the pools. The 2-mile (each way), moderate Pipiwai Trail leads
upstream to additional pools and 400-foot Waimoku Falls. The often
muddy but rewarding uphill trail leads through taro patches and
bamboo, guava, and mango stands to the magnificent falls. The trail is
unmarked but relatively easy to follow. Wear sturdy shoes, bring water,
and don’t attempt the trek in the rain.
A mile past Oheo Gulch on the road’s ocean side is Lindbergh’s Grave.
First to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, Charles Lindbergh found peace in
Hana, where he died of cancer in 1974. The famous aviator is buried
under river stones in a seaside graveyard behind the 1857 Palapala
Hoomau Congregational Church, where his tombstone is engraved with
his favorite words from the 139th Psalm: “If I take the wings of the morn-
ing and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea. . . .”
Heading back to the resorts
Before departing Hana, don’t forget to check your gas gauge no matter
which road west you’re traveling. There’s nowhere to fill up along either
route back to civilization. If you need gas, stop at one of the town’s two
service stations, Chevron and Hasegawa’s Hana Geko Gas, which sit
nearly side by side on the right side of the Hana Highway as you leave
town. (Prepare for sticker shock at the pump, though!)
Seeing the Sights in Central Maui
These attractions are located in and around the commercial heart of the
island, Kahului, and nearby Wailuku, the charming county seat. Wailuku
offers a few funky places to shop for antiques and Hawaiiana (see
Chapter 14).
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
234
Horseback riding in Kipahulu
If you want to explore the lush Kipahulu District on horseback, contact Maui Stables
(% 808-248-7799; www.mauistables.com), which offers a genuine island experi-
ence, rich with history and culture, as you explore the gorgeous scenery from your
mount. Choose a morning or afternoon three-hour tour; prices are $150 per person,
including a deli lunch; discounts are available for kids and seniors. Reservations are
a must, as are closed-toed shoes and long pants. The stables are accessible from the
Haleakala Highway (Highway 37) from the west side of the island, along the dry south-
ern route to Hana about 25 miles past Tedeschi Winery, as well as directly from Hana.
Expect the drive to take about two and a half hours if you’re coming from the west side
of the island.

Bailey House Museum
This 19th-century missionary and sugar planter’s home — built in 1833 on
a royal Hawaiian site — is a treasure trove of Hawaiiana that includes a
notable collection of precontact Hawaiian artifacts as well as items from
post-missionary times. Excellently curated, island-themed temporary
exhibits are also part of the mix. This little museum is well worth a half-
hour stop for history buffs. It boasts lovely gardens and a wonderful gift
shop, neither of which require admission.
2375-A Main St., just west of the Kaahumanu Avenue/Honoapiilani Highway (Highway
32/30) intersection, Wailuku. % 808-244-3326. www.mauimuseum.org. Admission:
$5 adults, $4 seniors, $1 kids 7–12. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Hawaii Nature Center — Iao Valley
Before heading into Iao (ee-ow) Valley, families may want to stop into this
small, kid-centered interactive science center, which features great hands-
on exhibits and displays relating to the park’s natural history. The center
also has a nice gift shop if you’re in the market for nature-themed toys.
Call ahead to reserve a spot on Hawaii Nature Center’s daily Rainforest
Walk through Iao Valley, offered Monday through Friday at 11:30 a.m. and
1:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Your guide can
offer historical, cultural, and natural insight that you just can’t gain on a
self-guided tour. The price is $30 for adults, $20 for kids (prices include
museum admission; children must be at least age 5 to join the Rainforest
Walk). Be sure to wear closed-toe shoes suitable for an uneven trail.
At the gateway to Iao Valley State Monument, 875 Iao Valley Rd. % 808-244-6500.
www.hawaiinaturecenter.org. Admission: $6 adults, $4 kids 11 and under.
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Iao Valley State Monument
As you head west to Iao Valley, the transition between town and wild is so
abrupt that most people who drive up into the valley don’t realize they’re
suddenly in a rain forest. The walls of the canyon rise, and a 2,250-foot
needle pricks gray clouds scudding across the blue sky. The Iao Needle is
an erosional remnant of rock. This is Iao Valley, a place of great natural
beauty and a haven for Mauians and visitors alike.
You can see everything in an hour or two, though it’s a lovely place to
bring a picnic and linger. Two paved walkways loop the 6-acre park; a
leisurely 2⁄3-mile loop walk takes you past lush vegetation and lovely views
of the fabulously impressive Iao Needle (called Kukaemoku in Hawaiian),
a fabulously impressive spire jutting 2,250 feet above sea level. This is the
spot of the battle of Kepaniwai, where Kamehameha I conquered the Maui
army in 1790 as part of his unification of the Hawaiian islands. An archi-
tectural park of Hawaiian heritage houses — including a Japanese tea-
house with a lovely koi pond, a Chinese pagoda, a New England–style
mission house, a Hawaiian hale, and a Portuguese garden — stands in har-
mony by Iao Stream at Kepaniwai Heritage Garden, near the park’s
entrance; it makes an excellent place for a picnic, because tables are at
Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 235

hand. You’ll see ferns, banana trees, and other native and exotic plants in
the streamside botanic garden.
On Iao Valley Road (at the end of Main Street/Highway 32), Wailuku. www.hawaii
stateparks.org. To get there: From Kahului, follow Kaahumanu Avenue 
east directly to Main Street and the park entrance. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 
7 a.m.–7 p.m.
Exploring Lahaina Town
You may not believe it, seeing today’s Lahaina overrun with contempo-
rary tourist schlock, but anyone who has read James Michener’s Hawaii
knows that back in the whaling and missionary days, Lahaina was the
capital of Hawaii and the Pacific’s wildest port. Now Lahaina is a party
town of a different kind and has lost much of its historic vibe, but history
buffs with an interest can unearth a half-day’s worth of historic sites.
Your best bet is to start at the Baldwin Home Museum, a beautifully
restored 1838 missionary home at the corner of Front and Dickenson
streets, where the Lahaina Restoration Foundation (% 808-661-3262;
www.lahainarestoration.org) is headquartered in the adjacent
Master’s Reading Room. Stop in any day between 10 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
to pick up the free self-guided walking tour brochure and map of
Lahaina’s most historic sites. All are within easy walking distance of 
one another. Stops include the Brig Carthaginian II, a replica of the 
19th-century whaling ship that brought the first missionaries to Hawaii,
docked at Lahaina Harbor; the banyan tree, planted as a sapling in 1873
and now a massive 60 feet high and spanning two-thirds of an acre; an
1850s prison, the inside of which the rowdiest whalers no doubt saw on
a regular basis; and a number of other interesting sites, including some
lovely Buddhist missions and temples.
History aside, Lahaina is the real center of tourism on the island, with
hotels, B&Bs, restaurants, T-shirt shops, and a gallery on nearly every
block. Expect the town to be rather congested and expect to battle for 
a parking spot. Paid lots abound, but you can usually find an available
free lot at the far south end of town, near the 505 Front St. shops on the
mountain side of the street.
Touring South Maui
These terrific attractions are located in Maalaea Harbor Village, at the
northernmost end of South Maui.
Maui Ocean Center
This state-of-the-art aquarium is way too pricey for its own good — it’s no
Monterey Bay Aquarium, after all. If you can overlook the cost, it’s a pretty
cool place. All exhibits feature the creatures that populate Hawaii’s waters.

Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 237

Start at the surge pool, where you’ll see such shallow-water marine life as
spiny urchins and cauliflower coral, and then move on to the reef tanks
and a turtle lagoon (where you’ll meet some wonderful green sea turtles).
A “touch” pool features tide-pool critters, and a stingray pool is populated
by graceful bottom dwellers; the whale discovery exhibit (no live crea-
tures) is disappointing, though. Then you get to the star of the show: the
600,000-gallon main tank, which features tiger, gray, and white-tip sharks,
as well as tuna, surgeon fish, triggerfish, and other large-scale tropicals.
The neatest thing about the tank is that it’s punctured by a clear acrylic
tunnel that lets you walk right through it, giving you a real idea of what it
might be like to stand at the bottom of the deep blue sea. Allow about two
hours for your visit.
In Maalaea Harbor Village, 192 Maalaea Rd. (at the triangle between Honoapiilani
Highway [Highway 31] and Maalaea Road), Maalaea. % 808-270-7000. www.maui
oceancenter.com. Admission: $24 adults, $21 seniors (65-plus), $17 kids 3–12.
Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. July–Aug).
Maui Golf & Sports Park
This first-class miniature golf playland boasts two courses that have been
designed with both fun and duffing precision in mind. It also has bumper
boats with water cannons (great on a hot day), a rock climbing wall, and
an “xtreme” trampoline; all activities carry separate charges, or you can
bundle them into a package deal. Tiki torches set the mood after dark, and
the staff is very friendly. The park is ideal for both family fun and an after-
dinner date.
In Maalaea Harbor Village (at the triangle between Honoapiilani Highway [Highway
31] and Maalaea Road; the entrance is on Maalaea Road), Maalaea. % 808-242-7818.
www.mauigolfandsportspark.com. Activity prices: $15 adults, $12 kids for
unlimited miniature golf; other activities $9 adults, $7 kids. Package rates available.
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–9 p.m.
Going Upcountry
The biggest attraction in Upcountry (the area on the slopes of Maui’s
10,000-foot Haleakala volcano) is, of course, Haleakala National Park,
which is so huge that it’s discussed in a separate section at the begin-
ning of this chapter. The rural Upcountry also has a handful of other
appealing features, most notably Maui’s only commercial winery (see
the listing later in this section) and some interesting shops in the
cowboy-turned-boutique-town of Makawao (see “Upcountry Maui:
Makawao and Kula” in Chapter 14 for more information).
Alii Kula Lavender Farm
This tranquil, lovely farmstead is the brainchild of “Lavender Engineer”
Alii Chang, who figured out that Maui boasted the perfect growing condi-
tions for myriad varieties of the world’s lavender (despite the fact that no
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
238

varieties are native to the island). The expansive, rolling, gorgeously kept
gardens now boast some 45 types of lavender, some of which bloom
nowhere else on the planet on a year-round basis. The business has grown
into a booming enterprise, with a slate of tours and a wealth of lavender-
flavored, -scented, and -infused products; in addition to being an inspired
horticulturist, Ching has also proven to be a masterful entrepreneur, part-
nering with some of the islands’ finest product manufacturers to create
custom lavender products.
The most common tour is the 30-minute guided garden walking tour, which
are offered five times daily; afterward, you’re welcome to enjoy lavender-
scented tea and scones complemented with lavender-infused honey,
served on the charming terrace of Chang’s home. The guide-led tour really
immerses visitors in the beauty and fascinating horticulture of growing
gorgeous global collection of lavender. You can also combine your guide-
led tour with a lunch basket reserved in advance, filled with lavender-
seasoned treats that you’re welcome to enjoy on the grounds; the kind
folks in the shop will even lend you a picnic mat. For a more in-depth explo-
ration of the garden, reserve a spot on an exclusive cart tour with Alii
Chang; the lavender grower escorts up to five guests across a wide swath
of the garden on his golf cart, educating and talking story. Or just come on
your own for tea and scones at your leisure, pick up a self-guided walking
tour map and explore the gardens of your own. A charming shop sells a
lovely range of beautifully packaged lavender goods, from spice rubs to
creamy hand lotions. Special tea services and seasonal tours — including
fun, arts-and-craftsy wreath-making tours — are bookable for small groups.
1100 Waipoli Rd., Kula. % 808-878-3004. www.aliikulalavender.com. To get
there: From the Hana Highway (Highway 36), turn right onto Haleakala Highway
(Highway 37 south); in about 30 minutes, you will pass Kula Elementary School on
the right, and then Rice Memorial Park; take the second left after the park and drive
about 1⁄4 mile; after you round the bend, take a quick right up Waipoli Road; turn right
immediately before the cattle guard. 30-minute lavender garden guided tours ($12
per person) daily at 9:30, 10:30, and 11:30 a.m., and 1 and 2:30 p.m. Reservations for
tour recommended at least 24 hours in advance, required if you want to reserve a
luncheon basked ($37 per person, guided tour included). Exclusive cart tour with Alii
Chang ($25 per person) usually offered daily at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.; reservations are
required. Open: Teahouse and store daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
Surfing Goat Dairy
This delightful place is a must on any foodie’s tour of the Valley Isle.
German expatriates Thomas and Eva Kafsak came to Maui, purchased 42
verdant acres on the sunny slopes of Haleakala volcano, and opened the
finest goat dairy in the Pacific, with 11 national cheese awards under its
belt (and counting). The Surfing Goat Dairy is now a thriving business with
a herd of 80 goats that Eva, Thomas, and their small staff care for as if they
were their children; the result is some of the finest goat cheese you’ll ever
taste. The farm is also home to three friendly dogs, three cats, and one
large, and very spoiled, potbellied pig. Eva and Thomas open their bliss-
ful farm to visitors, who come to learn about the practice of goat farming
Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 239

and the craft of artisan goat-cheese making — and, above all else, to pet
the utterly charming goat kids, each of whom has its own personality and
cute name.
The casual 20- to 30-minute tour is offered every day, generally about every
half-hour; just show up during the open hours, and Eva or a tour guide will
show you around, give you a brief overview of the process, and introduce
you to the goats; the fun culminates in a cheese tasting. For a more
detailed experience — including an opportunity to feed and milk the goats
and an extended play period with the kids — sign on for the three-hour
Grand Tour, which is available on most weekend mornings by appoint-
ment. There’s also a delightful Evening Chores tour offered three times a
week — usually Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday afternoons.
You can also enjoy a simple farm-style lunch while you’re at the farm,
and/or order some of the gourmet goat cheeses — which come in a vari-
ety of hard, soft, and herb-infused flavors — to carry out or send home.
Surfing Goat’s cheeses are European style — lighter, more delicate than
most domestic goat cheeses — making them appealing to a wider range
of palates. The unbaked, German-style lilikoi cheesecake is a delightful
sweet treat. Don’t miss this wonderful spot if you can manage it; if you
can’t, you can also order cheeses and other goodies online.

Maui pineapples: No ka oi! (The best!)
Everybody thinks of the pineapple as a genuine Hawaiian treat, but the sad fact is that
not many pineapples are grown in Hawaii these days. However, the Maui Pineapple
Company — one of the last real vestiges of Hawaii’s plantation era — still harvests
some of the world’s sweetest, most succulent pineapples in the rich uplands of Kapalua.
On the Pineapple Express Tour, you can tour this 23,000-acre working plantation in the
company of the company’s own field workers, learning about the history of the pineap-
ple in Hawaii and the unique cultivation of these sun-sweet fruits. You even have an
opportunity to pick your own luscious fruit to take home. This tour isn’t a touristy, faux
plantation experience — it’s the real deal for folks who are genuinely interested in
Hawaii’s pineapple history. The two-hour tours are offered weekdays at 9 and 11:45 a.m.;
tickets are $40, $32 for children under 12. A three-and-a-quarter-hour Pineapple
Experience Signature Tour includes a short hike and lunch at either the Plantation House
or Pineapple Grill restaurants in Kapalua; tickets are $65 adults, $58 kids 11 and under.
Kids must be at least 5 years old to attend, and everyone should wear closed-toe shoes.

Tedeschi Vineyards at Ulupalakua Ranch
Maui’s only winery is worth visiting less for its wines — which aren’t going
to cause the Napa Valley to lose sleep anytime soon — and more for the
stunning mountain drive it takes to get there, and the pretty pastoral view
you find after you arrive. Sitting on the little-visited south slopes of
Haleakala at 2,000 feet elevation, these rolling, golden-hued ranchlands are
like no other place you’ll find on the island. The ranch dates back to the
mid-19th century (the tasting room is housed in a lovely 1874 stone cot-
tage built for a visit by King David Kalakaua), so it has a wonderful historic
feeling and well-established grounds that are fine for picnicking; buy a
bottle — red, white, or sparkling — to accompany lunch, but skip the silly
pineapple wine. Allow an hour each way for the drive from most resorts.
Free tastings and guided tours (daily at 10:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3 p.m.)
make this destination surprisingly popular.

Hitting the Links: Maui’s Best Golf
If you love golf, don’t miss the opportunity to play on Maui. The Valley
Isle boasts a wealth of championship courses designed to make 18-hole
memories.
Always book your tee times well in advance (a week or even more) on
popular Maui, especially in high season. Weekdays are best for avoiding
the crowds and securing the tee times you want. Note that golf carts are
required on all Maui golf courses.
The Maui Golf Shop, 357 Huku Lii Place, Kihei (% 800-981-5512 or
808-875-4653; www.golf-maui.com), can book discounted tee times 
for you at many of Maui’s finest courses (including, at press time, the
Dunes, Kaanapali, and Makena, all in the following section). If you want
to schedule your tee times before you leave home, you can submit your
requests online (where you also find information and insider tips on
playing a wealth of Maui links) up to 30 days in advance. After you
arrive, the shop is the best place on the island to rent clubs and stock
up on gear; you can find it just off the Piilani Highway (Highway 31) at
Ohukai Road (behind Tesoro Gas Express).
You can also check out discounter Tee Times Hawaii.com (% 888-675-

Play in the afternoon, when discounted twilight rates are in effect. I can’t
guarantee that you’ll get 18 holes in, especially in winter when it’s dark
by 6 p.m., but you’ll have an opportunity to experience these world-
famous courses at half the usual fee. I note discount times in the listings
that follow.

Maui-based golfers who would also like to experience the celebrated

Lanai ferry over to the private island for a day of world-class golf.
Expeditions Maui-Lahaina (% 800-695-2624; www.go-lanai.com)
offers service between Lahaina and Lanai’s Manele Harbor five times
daily; there’s also twice-daily service from Maui’s Maalaea Harbor, north
of Kihei on Maui’s neck. The one-way fare is $25 for adults; golf packages
are available for $260 per golfer, including greens fees and round-trip
ferry service; 6:45 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. departures are available from
Lahaina, and there’s a 7 a.m. departure from Maalaea. For more on
Lanai’s two terrific courses, see Chapter 17.
The Dunes at Maui Lani
This dramatic British links-style course was completed in 1997, but it plays
like an old pro. Inspired by the old-growth links of Ireland, Honolulu-based
course architect Robin Nelson built this public course on the former home
of a sand-mining operation, which has allowed the fairways to mature in
record time. Several blind and semiblind shots give this all-around, enjoy-
able course an edge. Considering the course’s quality, the rates are 
a veritable bargain. Private lessons and half-day schools at the PGA
pro–taught golf school even make improving your swing a comparatively
affordable endeavor.

Kaanapali Golf Resort
Both of these popular, rolling resort courses pose a challenge to all golfers,
from high handicappers to near pros. In December 2006, the Tournament
North Course emerged from a major renovation that has slightly retooled
the layout and left the course looking better than ever. It’s a true Robert
Trent Jones, Jr., design (one of only two in Hawaii), with an abundance of
wide bunkers; several long, stretched-out tees; the largest, most contoured
greens on Maui; and one of Hawaii’s toughest finishing holes. The par-70,
6,400-yard Resort South Course is an Arthur Jack Snyder design that was
renovated in 2005 by renowned course architect Robin Nelson, who
designed new deep bunkers and landscaping. Although the course still
demands challenging shots, the refreshed layout brings the short game
and shot selection into play — including a series of forward tees for
women, juniors, and beginners — making it a satisfying outing for a wide
spectrum of players. Trade winds tend to add an extra level of challenge
later in the day. The course is fun to play and boasts great panoramic
views, including lovely views of Molokai, Lanai, and even Oahu on clear

Kapalua Golf Club
These three spectacularly sited championship courses are worth the sky-
high greens fees for the magnificent ocean views alone. Resort golf hardly
gets finer — Hawaii magazine regularly names the Bay and the Plantation
courses two of the top nine courses in Hawaii. An Arnold Palmer/Francis
Duane design, the par-72, 6,600-yard Bay Course is a bit forgiving thanks to
generous and gently undulating fairways, but even the pros have trouble
with the 5th, which requires a tee shot over an ocean cove. The breath-
taking — and breathtakingly difficult — Ben Crenshaw/Bill Coore–designed
Plantation Course is prime for developing your low shots and precise chip-
ping; this 7,263-yard, par-73 showstopper is home to the PGA’s annual
Mercedes Championship. The par-71, 6,632-yard Village Course, a
Palmer/Ed Seay design and the most scenic of the three courses, suits
beginners and pros alike, but winds can make for a challenging day among
the Cook and Norfolk pines. Facilities include locker rooms, a driving
range, and a restaurant.
The first-rate Kapalua Golf Academy (% 877-527-2582 or 808-665-5455),
designed with the input of golf legend Hale Irwin, just may be Hawaii’s best
place to improve the swing of beginner and almost-pro alike.

Makena Golf Courses
Robert Trent Jones, Jr., was in top form when he designed these 36 holes.
The par-72, 7,017-yard oceanside South Course is considered the more for-
giving of the two but has a couple of holes you’ll never forget: Running par-
allel to the ocean, the par-4 16th has a two-tiered green that slopes away
from the player, while the par-5, 502-yard 10th is one of Hawaii’s best driv-
ing holes. With tight fairways and narrow doglegs, the par-72, 6,914-yard
North Course is more difficult and more spectacular because it sits higher
up the slope of Haleakala. Facilities include a clubhouse, driving range,
two putting greens, a pro shop, lockers, and lessons. Additional bonuses
include a gorgeous rural setting and spectacular views.

Pukalani Country Club
This par-72, 6,962-yard course (at a cool elevation of 1,100 feet) offers a
break from the resorts’ sky-high greens fees, and it’s really fun to play. The
3rd hole offers golfers two different options: a tough iron shot from the tee
(especially into the wind), across a gully to the green; or a shot down the
side of the gully across a second green into sand traps below. (Most people
choose to shoot down the side of the gully; it’s actually easier than shoot-
ing across a ravine.) High handicappers love this course, and more-
experienced players can make it more challenging by playing from the
back tees. Facilities include club and shoe rentals, practice areas, lockers,
a pro shop, and a restaurant.

Wailea Golf Club
Most difficult among Wailea’s courses is the par-72, 7,070-yard Gold
Course, home of the Wendy’s Championship Skins Game. This classic
Robert Trent Jones, Jr., design boasts a rugged layout, narrow fairways,
several tricky dogleg holes, daunting natural hazards, and only-in-Hawaii
features, such as lava outcroppings and native grasses. Both the Old Blue
and the Emerald are easy for most golfers to enjoy, but the par-72, 6,407-
yard Emerald Course — another Trent Jones, Jr., design — is both the pret-
tiest and easiest for high handicappers to enjoy. The par-72, 6,700-yard Old
Blue Course, an open course designed by Arthur Jack Snyder, has wide
fairways that also appeal to beginners, but bunkers, water hazards, and
undulating terrain make it a course that all can enjoy. Facilities include two
clubhouses, two pro shops, restaurants, lockers, club rentals, and a com-
plete training facility.

Enjoying Guided Nature Hikes
Maui Eco-Adventures (% 877-661-7720 or 808-661-7720; www.ecomaui.
com) was recognized as Hawaii’s Eco-Tourism Operator of the Year in
2005, and deservedly so. This well-run operation specializes in guided
cultural and hiking adventures that explore unspoiled areas of the Valley
Isle — including the little-known Maunalei Arboretum; Kahakuloa Village,
a rare vestige of old Hawaii; and Nakele Point, the northernmost point
on Maui — on a variety of compelling journeys for intrepid travelers of

all hiking abilities. A selection of wonderful waterfall hikes can make
your island dreams come true; the six-hour Rainforest/Waterfall hike is
my favorite for the access it provides into the breathtakingly lush, other-
wise hidden heart of Maui. A Haleakala crater hike really brings the
majestic yet barren landscape to life. Hike/kayak combos are also avail-
able for those who want a multifaceted experience, as are custom-
designed tours that can add helicopter tours, sailboat adventures, and
four-wheeling into the mix. Prices run $80 to $160 per person, including
continental breakfast, lunch, a day’s supply of water, and pickup from
West Maui hotels (expect to pay more for a custom-designed tour). It’s
an excellent way to see Maui at its natural best.
Maui’s oldest guided hiking company is Ken Schmitt’s Hike Maui (% 866-
324-MAUI [866-324-6284] or 808-879-5270; www.hikemaui.com). Hike
Maui has been universally lauded for the quality of its hikes. The expert
guides are all trained naturalists who really know their stuff. Hike Maui
offers an array of outings from easy to strenuous, but most fall in the
moderate category. Two rain-forest and waterfall hikes are available, as
well as two Haleakala Volcano hikes that offer an excellent way to see
this splendid national park, which can be difficult to appreciate if you
don’t know what you’re seeing. If you’re an accomplished hiker and fit
for it, don’t miss the longer hike. It takes you all the way to the crater
floor — which looks so much like the moon that the lunar astronauts
trained here — for an otherworldly experience. Outings range from $75
to $154 per person, including equipment and transportation from the
company’s Central Maui headquarters and a simple, healthy lunch of
sandwiches and fruit. You can book as late as a couple of days in
advance, but your best bet is to call before you arrive on the island.
Maui Hiking Safaris (% 888-445-3963 or 808-573-0168; www.maui.net/
~mhs), another reputable company, offers guided hikes for all levels,
including waterfall hikes and guided hikes of Haleakala. Prices run from
$59 to $139 per person.
Maui Hiking Safaris extends 10 percent discounts to hikers who book
online and to groups of six or more.
Getting a Bird’s-Eye View: Helicopter Tours
Flightseeing is an excellent way to explore Maui’s stunning, untouched
natural areas — some magical parts of the island simply can’t be seen by
any other means. Maui-based helicopter tours also offer you the opportu-
nity to see a neighbor island — Molokai, Lanai, or even the Big Island —
from the air, in addition to the Valley Isle.
There are, however, some considerations. Although the company I rec-
ommend in this section features skilled pilots and helicopters with
excellent safety records, the truth is that flightseeing can be a risky busi-
ness. A few dozen people have died in commercial helicopter crashes in
Chapter 13: Exploring the Island 245

Hawaii over the last decade. Of course, just getting into your rental car
and driving to dinner — or even getting into the shower in your condo
with a renegade bar of soap — is far more dangerous than catching a
copter ride. Still, you should make informed decisions.
When reserving a helicopter tour with any company, check to make sure
that safety is its first concern. The company should be an FAA-certified
Part 135 operator, and the pilot should be Part 135 certified as well. 
The 135 license guarantees more stringent maintenance requirements
and pilot-training programs than those programs that are only Part 91
certified. And any time weather conditions look iffy, reschedule. You 
can certainly make arrangements before your vacation begins, but it
isn’t necessary. The concierge at your hotel can help you make an
appointment.
Blue Hawaiian Helicopters
This top-notch flightseeing company is my Hawaii favorite. Family-run by
David and Patti Chevalier and a loyal, long-employed staff, Blue Hawaiian
flies a fleet of superb American Eurocopter AStar 350 helicopters that
carry six passengers, providing each with a 180-degree view and a Bose
noise-cancelling headset that lets you enjoy a surprisingly quiet ride. A
world leader in the flightseeing industry, Blue Hawaiian also flies Hawaii’s
only EC-130B4 Eco-Stars. These cutting-edge copters lower noise pollution
with a superquiet design and maximize comfort and views with state-of-
the-art design, technology, and materials. These copters offer one phe-
nomenal ride. (You can choose which kind of copter you’ll fly; the Eco-Star
tours are more expensive, but they offer a slightly better viewing range
through their bubblelike windows.)
A range of available flight options include some or all of the following spec-
tacular sights: the misty, green West Maui Mountains; otherworldly
Haleakala Volcano; luxuriant, unspoiled East Maui and Hana; and Molokai,
where you fly by the highest sea cliffs in the world. The various tours run
from 30 to 90 minutes.
If you can afford it, I suggest booking the fantastic 90-minute Maui
Spectacular, which includes a complete island tour as well as a midflight
landing at an exclusive perch at the Ulupalakua Ranch, on the grassy
slopes of Haleakala. The view is simply stunning, as is the landing and take-
off from this remote spot. This trip was one of my best outings in Hawaii
ever — and I’ve spent plenty of time in Hawaii. But don’t miss out if you
can’t quite swing the grand tour; opt for a West Maui/Molokai combo, or
a Hana/Haleakala tour (especially if you’re not going to have time to hit
the road to Hana).
Honored annually by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with its
Certificate of Excellence, Blue Hawaiian boasts an excellent safety record,
as well as a fleet of other top safety and customer-satisfaction certifica-
tions and awards. The pilots (mostly decorated veterans) boast thousands
upon thousands of flight hours. The pilots are also well-trained and certi-
fied tour guides who are extremely knowledgeable narrators. A state-of-
the-art, in-flight video is on board in case you want to preserve the sights

ture, sure, but money well spent.

the 300-acre Mendes Ranch, a real working ranch complete with water-
falls, palm trees, coral-sand beaches, lagoons, tide pools, a rain forest,
and its own volcanic peak. Allan Mendes, a third-generation wrangler,
takes you from the rain forest’s edge out to the sea. On the way, you
cross tree-studded meadows where Texas longhorns sit in the shade and
pass a dusty corral where Allan’s father, Ernest, a champion roper, may
be breaking a wild horse. The two-and-a-half-hour Aloha ride, which
leaves at 8:15 a.m. or 12:15 p.m., costs $110; it includes snacks, and you
can add on a barbecue lunch for $20.

Serving Up Some Tennis
Most resorts and nicer condo complexes in Maui offer private tennis
courts.
If you need a court in West Maui, contact the Kapalua Tennis Garden,
Kapalua Resort (% 808-665-9112; www.kapalua.com), which features
ten Plexipave courts for day and night play ($16 for nonresort guests,
$14 for resort guests), plus group and private instruction.
In South Maui, book a court at the Wailea Tennis Club (% 808-879-
1958; www.waileatennis.com). Consistently chosen as one of the finest
tennis facilities in the country, Wailea has 11 hard courts available for
$15 per person, or a maximum of $60 per court for nonresort guests,
plus a full calendar of lessons, clinics, round robins, and the like. The
club also rents racquets, shoes, and ball machines.
Relaxing at a Spa
What’s the icing on the cake of any vacation? A pampering spa day, of
course. Hawaii’s spas have raised the art of relaxation and healing to a
new level, showcasing Hawaiian products and traditional treatments
available only in the islands.
They simply don’t come any finer than the luxurious Spa Grande at the
Grand Wailea Resort (% 800-888-6100 or 808-875-1234; www.grand
wailea.com), which is regularly recognized as one of the top ten spas in
the United States. This 50,000-square-foot temple to the good life boasts a
massive East-meets-West spa menu, a first-rate army of therapists, and 40
individual treatment rooms (many with ocean views). There’s a full Termé
hydrotherapy circuit consisting of a variety of healthful baths (including
mud, seaweed, aromatherapy, tropical enzyme, and mineral salt, each
with its own rejuvenating powers), Roman pools, and Swiss-jet showers
that are worth the treatment price of admission alone. (They’re included
with every treatment, so I recommend coming a full hour or more before
your appointment.) For a one-of-a-kind experience, don’t miss the celestial
Coconut Euphoria bath, a multistep moisturizing treatment that makes
you feel like a piña colada–scented queen for a day. Honestly, you can’t go
wrong anywhere on this menu. Book a full day’s package for the ultimate
indulgence — you deserve it. Reserve well ahead.
The Spa at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea (% 808-874-8000;
www.fourseasons.com/maui) is another good place to spoil yourself
with pure pampering. The intimate and sophisticated facility features 13
indoor treatment rooms, a state-of-the-art gym, a healing garden, and
three outdoor hale with idyllic ocean views. Imagine the sounds of the
waves rolling on Wailea Beach as you’re soothingly massaged in the pri-
vacy of your own thatch-roofed hut, tucked into the beachside foliage.

local character is the Awapuhi Limi (Ginger Lime) massage, which fea-
tures whipped aloe butter infused with ginger and lime essential oils 
and seaweed extracts applied using the Hawaiian lomilomi massage
technique.
In West Maui, your top choice is Spa Moana at the Hyatt Regency Maui

center on the island.
Kaanapali’s Westin Maui boasts the Heavenly Spa by Westin at Westin
Maui (% 808-661-2588; www.westinmaui.com), with 13,000 square feet
of celestial pampering and relaxation. Many treatments are infused with
island scents, including Maui-grown lavender.
If you’re in Lahaina and in the mood for some storefront pampering, visit
Lei Spa Maui, in the 505 Front St. complex, at the far south end of Front
Street (% 808-661-1178; www.leispa.com), which carries a wonderful
line of fragrant and rejuvenating Hawaii-made bath-and-body products,
and therapists offer massages, body wraps, and facials.
For the ultimate in Upcountry relaxation, contact Maui Spa Retreat 
(% 808-573-8002; www.mauisparetreat.com). Boasting a majestic
perch on the slopes of Haleakala, this hidden gem can reward you with
one of the finest spa days you’ll ever enjoy. The petite spa is also an aro-
matherapy farm, and the proprietor blends all her own body scrubs,
wraps, and healing oils. If you book the spa as a couple, you’ll have it 
all to yourself; I recommend a three-hour spa package for two, which
includes private use of the outdoor spa, sauna, and outdoor showers. A
divine day spent here is like having your own private spa and pampering
at the hands of the finest therapists on the island. If you’re a spa afi-
cionado, don’t miss it. There are also two simple, charming cottages to
rent for a complete Upcountry experience (see Chapter 10 for details).
In Paia, if you’re looking for an excellent, low-key, and affordable mas-
sage, visit Northshore Chiropractic and Massage, 16 Baldwin Ave. 
(% 808-579-9134), on the west side of the main street, a few doors 
from the highway. They charge a mere $65 an hour and have fabulous
therapists.

T
he shopping scene on Valley Isle is the reigning king among the
neighbor islands. Shoppers may really find themselves in paradise.
Central Maui: Wailuku and Kahului
Although Kahului is the island’s hub and the place to go for practical
items, the historic town of Wailuku, immediately to its west, offers rea-
sonably good hunting grounds for antiques hounds. Like most Maui
shopping destinations, Wailuku is a mixed bag — it has never really
taken off like some had hoped — but you can find a few quality shops
featuring both new and used treasures on North Market Street. To get
there, simply go west from Kahului on Kaahumanu Avenue and turn right
when you reach Market, in the heart of Wailuku.
Highlights include Brown-Kobayashi, 38 N. Market St. (% 808-242-
0804), a treasure trove of graceful Asian antiques (mostly large pieces,
but affordable prices make the shipping worth it for committed collec-
tors); Gottling Ltd., 38 N. Market St. (% 808-244-7779; www.gottling
ltd.com), for an elegant collection of furnishings and antiques; Bird of
Paradise Unique Antiques, 54 N. Market St. (% 808-242-7699), for a
jumble of collectible glassware, pottery, and Hawaiiana; and If the Shoe
Fits, 12 N. Market St. (% 808-249-9710), for unique footwear.
If you’re in the island music mood, Mele Ukulele, before the old Wailuku
bridge at 1750 Kaahumanu Ave. (% 808-244-3938; www.meleukulele.
com), carries Hawaii’s largest selection of new and used ukes.
In Kahului, stop by Hawaiian Island Surf and Sport, 415 Dairy Rd.,
Kahului (% 800-231-6958 or 808-871-4981; www.hawaiianisland.com),
for all your surfing, body-boarding, and water-play needs.

West Maui: Lahaina, Kaanapali, and Kapalua
Shopping in West Maui consists of two main areas: Lahaina and Kaanapali.
The following sections give you the lowdown on these areas, as well as
one worth-seeking-out site if you’re in the Kapalua area.
Lahaina
Lahaina’s main drag, Front Street, overflows with surf-wear shops, con-
temporary art galleries, trendy boutiques, cheesy T-shirt shops, and
much more; you’ll tire of browsing well before you run out of places to
flex your credit card.
Your best bet is to just start at one end of Front Street and browse.
Highlights include Serendipity, 752 Front St. (% 808-879-7100; www.
serendipitymaui.com), for casual women’s wear in comfortable, loose-
fitting island styles. Honolua Surf Co., 845 Front St. (% 808-661-8848;
www.honoluasurf.com), carries its own fabulous line of surf wear and
gear (you’ll find additional locations in Whaler’s Village, the Lahaina
Cannery Mall, Kihei, and the Shops at Wailea). Another excellent stop for
surf wear and gear is Tropix, 790 Front St. (% 808-661-9296), Maui’s
homegrown surf company. For a wide selection of swimwear, visit Maui
Water Wear, 850 Front St. (% 808-667-2761); there’s a second Lahaina
location at Lahaina Cannery Mall.
Célébrités, 764 Front St. (% 800-428-3338; www.celebrityfineart.
com), features art by and about celebrities; expect original art and num-
bered lithographs by such second-careerists as John Lennon and the
Rolling Stones’ Ron Wood, plus a wealth of autographed headshots and
platinum albums. Vintage European Posters, 744 Front St. (% 808-662-
8688; www.europeanposters.com), boasts a fantastic array of original
poster art from 1890 to 1950, mostly European and all in mint condition.
(There’s a second branch at Whaler’s Village at Kaanapali Beach.)
The Art of Peter Max Gallery, 716 Front St. (% 808-661-7979; www.
petermax.com), specializes in the vibrant, multimedia, cartoon-style art
of this icon of the 1960s and ’70s. The Bella Vitri Gallery, 744 Front St.
(% 808-661-4646; www.mauiartglass.com), features a glorious collec-
tion of studio-art glass from such master artists as Dale Chihuly, James
Nowak, and Hiroshi Yamano; this one’s a dazzler.
Another excellent choice for original art is Martin Lawrence Galleries,
Lahaina Market Place, at the corner of Front Street and Lahainaluna
Road, in the heart of town (% 808-661-1788; www.martinlawrence.
com). Famous-name artists, from Rembrandt to Warhol, make this collec-
tion so fine that window-shopping alone is a joy. You’re welcome to
browse, even with no intent to buy.
Also worth checking out are the vibrant, three-dimensional natural
panoramas of globetrotting photographer Peter Lik, whose Peter Lik
Chapter 14: Shopping the Local Stores 251

Gallery, 712 Front St. (% 808-651-6623; www.peterlik.com), is defi-
nitely worth a browse.
An island of artistic integrity in the sea of Lahaina kitsch is Na Mea
Hawaii Store, in the Baldwin House, 120 Dickenson St., at Front Street
(% 808-661-5707), which sells only fine-quality, island-made crafts and
gifts. That doesn’t mean expensive, though; you can find a surprising
number of affordable prizes among the bounty.
For marine-themed goods and educational gifts for kids, you can’t do
better than the surprisingly nice nonprofit Pacific Whale Foundation
store, 612 Front St. (% 808-667-7447; www.pacificwhale.org).
Members save 15 percent off all whale- and eco-themed goodies, as well
as whale-watching cruises and snorkel tours, which can be booked right
at the shop, so consider joining up for a good cause.
Old Lahaina Book Emporium, 834 Front St. (% 808-661-1399; www.old
lahainabookemporium.com), is a wonderful haunt for used and new fic-
tion, nonfiction, music, and videos.
At the far-south end of Front Street, in the 505 Front St. complex, is Lei
Spa Maui (% 808-661-1178; www.leispa.com), which carries a wonder-
ful line of fragrant and rejuvenating Hawaii-made bath and body prod-
ucts, while therapists offer massages, body wraps, and facials.
At the opposite, north end of Front Street are a couple of shopping cen-
ters, including Lahaina Cannery Mall, 1221 Honoapiilani Hwy. (% 808-
667-0592; www.lahainacannerymall.com), for practical items. The
Lahaina Center, 900 Front St. (% 808-667-9216; www.lahainacenter.
com), is a pleasant open-air mall that boasts Hilo Hattie, Hawaii’s biggest
name in affordable aloha wear, and a multiscreen movie theater — 
perfect for rainy days.
Newest on the scene is Lahaina Gateway (% 808-893-0300; www.lahaina
gateway.com), a sprawling new complex on the highway, featuring such
big names as Barnes & Noble and Outback Steakhouse. Also on the
highway is Lahaina Music, 910 Honoapiilani Hwy, on the mountain side
(% 808-661-7625; www.lahainamusic.com), which features Lahaina’s
largest selection of ukuleles as well as guitars and accessories.
Kaanapali
On the beach, in Kaanapali, Whaler’s Village, 2435 Kaanapali Pkwy. 
(% 808-661-4567; www.whalersvillage.com), has blossomed into
quite an upscale shopping and dining complex, offering an appealing
open-air shopping experience (once you get past the ordeal of parking).
Although it has become a chic shopping stop in recent years — with
Coach, Louis Vuitton, and Tommy Bahama all represented — it also 
has some surprisingly excellent midrange boutiques, including three
branches of Honolua Surf Co. — including one for kids — whose stylish
surf gear and wear I just love; Sandal Tree, for an excellent collection of
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
252

women’s footwear, sun hats, and handbags; The Walking Company, for a
wide selection of the most comfortable shoes out there for men and
women; Blue Ginger for relaxed and comfortable batik-print resort wear
for women and kids; Na Hoku, for quality Hawaii-themed and local-style
jewelry, including Hawaiian heirloom jewelry; Totally Hawaiian Gift
Gallery for an artful collection of island-made gifts; Dolphin Galleries, for
high-quality, island-themed, and locally designed jewelry, including a 14-
carat collection designed in a clever petroglyph style; David & Goliath,
home to the most delightfully snarky collection of cartoon-print tees for
the kid and kid wannabe in your life; Maui Water Wear for a fine collection
of women’s swimwear; a branch of Reyn’s, the Hawaii-based company
that makes my second-favorite contemporary aloha wear (after Sig Zane;
see Wailuku, earlier in this section); Lahaina Printsellers for antique
prints, maps, and engravings; and Martin & MacArthur for island crafts.
Meeting your practical needs are such stops as The Body Shop, in case
you need to stock up on ecofriendly sunscreen; Ritz Camera; Maui Dive
Shop; and Borders Express, in case you need a fresh beach read.
Kapalua
In Kapalua, stop by the freshly renovated Honolua Store, 502 Office Rd.
(% 808-665-9105), the resort’s beloved plantation store, a lone holdover
from when this region grew sugar cane and pineapple rather than golfers
and sunbathers. In business since 1929, the new Honolua Store has recap-
tured its vintage feel, marrying it with an ultramodern selection of wine
and locally made gourmet food and gift products. There’s also an espresso
bar and plate lunch counter. Well worth a stop if you’re in the area.
South Maui: Wailea
The lovely open-air Shops at Wailea, 3750 Wailea Alanui Dr. (% 808-
891-6770; www.shopsatwailea.com), has been a great addition to the
Wailea resort, bringing in much-needed practical retailers and elegant
gift outlets alike. Stores run the gamut from Tiffany & Co., Fendi, St.
John, Louis Vuitton, Betsey Johnson, Guess, and Gucci to The Gap,
Banana Republic, and White House/Black Market. Specialty stores
worth seeking out include Footprints, for an excellent selection of san-
dals for men, women, and children; the gorgeous Tori Richard and
Reyn’s, for high-quality aloha wear in prints that range from subtly
sophisticated to fun and funky; Martin & MacArthur and Elephant
Walk, for hand-crafted koa and other Hawaii crafts and gifts; Na Hoku,
for fine jewelry done in the Hawaiian heritage style, plus beautiful
Tahitian pearls; Blue Ginger, which has brought batik into the 21st cen-
tury with its bold prints and flowing modern cuts for women and kids;
Maui Water Wear, for an excellent collection of swimwear for women,
from sexy to sedate; the Tommy Bahama Emporium, with tropically
sophisticated clothing (also boasting a winning oceanview cafe and bar —
see Chapter 11); and much more. Art lovers can find a wealth of upscale
art galleries, including outlets of such Lahaina favorites as Célébrités,
showcasing art by and about, yes, celebrities; and Ki’i Gallery, whose
Chapter 14: Shopping the Local Stores 253

large-scale treasures include the monumental art glass of Dale Chihuly;
plus Eclectic Image Gallery for high-quality photographic art. You find
all this and much, much more in a pleasant oceanview setting.
On the Road to Hana: Paia
The hip little surf town of Paia (pa-ee-ah), just 15 minutes east of Kahului
on the Hana Highway (Highway 36), has evolved into one of my favorite
Maui shopping stops of late. It makes an eclectic but appealing stop for
shoppers looking for funky, fun, and fashion-forward goods. The bou-
tiques sprawl in a T-shape from the intersection of the Hana Highway and
Baldwin Avenue, and the choices range from the sublime to the ridiculous.
On the sublime end is Maui Crafts Guild, on the ocean side of Hana
Highway at no. 43 (% 808-579-9697; www.mauicraftsguild.com), an
artist-owned cooperative that represents some of the finest artists and
craftspeople on Maui; you find artworks and gifts in all price ranges
there. Maui Hands, 84 Hana Hwy. (% 808-579-9245; www.mauihands.
com), also specializes in locally made art and crafts.
Also on the Hana Highway, across the street from Maui Hands at no. 83,
is Tamara Catz (% 808-579-9184; www.tamaracatz.com), the first bou-
tique from the Argentine-born, New York–educated Catz, who is married
to world windsurfing champ Francisco Goya. The designer specializes in
sleek, sexy fashion with a feminine flair, designed for confident women
who love body-conscious wear; her store has launched Paia as a bur-
geoning hub of cutting-edge chic in the islands.
Moonbow Tropics, 20 and 36 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-579-8592; www.
moonbowtropicsmaui.com), offers the finest contemporary aloha-wear
lines available for men and women alike; Moonbow offers what is
arguably the best local-style clothing collection on the island. Nuage
Bleu, 76 Hana Hwy. (% 808-579-9792; www.nuagebleu.com), specializes
in cutting-edge clothing and accessories for women and children, carry-
ing such brands as Juicy Couture, Miss Sixty, Diane von Furstenberg, and
others; Lucky magazine recently named Nuage Bleu its favorite Maui bou-
tique, bar none. Another wonderful fashion stop is Imrie, 71 Baldwin Ave.
(% 808-579-8303); a New York City transplant from sisters Tamsin and
Caitlin Imrie, fashionistas who have successfully blended urban chic with
casual island style for women who like a funky-fun yet fabulous look.
Fashion seekers might also check out Biasa Rose, 104 Hana Hwy. (% 808-
579-8602), for chic, casual clothing for men and women from such
brands as Betsey Johnson, James Perse, AG, Calypso, Tart, and more.
The island’s sexiest bikinis can be found at Maui Girl Beachwear, 12
Baldwin Ave. (% 800-579-9266 or 808-579-9266; www.maui-girl.com),
which is probably the finest swimwear shop in the islands. There’s
plenty more good stuff; just park and browse.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
254

If you’d like to bring a special Hawaii-themed gift home to Fido or Fluffy,
visit Birken & Bailey’s Pet Boutique, 21 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-579-
9805), an ultracharming stop for pet lovers in the heart of Paia town.
Upcountry Maui: Makawao and Kula
Just because you’re off the beaten path, doesn’t mean you won’t find
great shopping. Shopping fanatics can have a ball in Maui’s verdant
Upcountry.
Makawao
From Paia, drive on Baldwin Avenue (Highway 390), toward the mountain,
and in 7 miles, you reach Makawao (ma-ka-wow), a cowboy town–turned–
New Age village that’s another petite shopper’s paradise, especially in the
local arts category.
The shopping is so good in Makawao that the whole town is a highlight.
Serious shoppers should definitely save an afternoon to explore. Seek
out Hurricane, 3639 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-572-5076), a wonderful split-
level boutique that carries a well-displayed selection of fine casuals for
women, including such fine labels as Sigrid Olsen; and Tropo, next door
at 3643 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-573-0356), Hurricane’s boutique for men.
Pink by Nature, 3663 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-572-9576; www.pinkby
nature.com), specializes in lovely contemporary fashions for women
and children.
The Courtyard, at 3620 Baldwin Ave., houses a number of interesting
craft shops of varying quality, including Maui Hands (% 808-352-4278;
www.mauihands.com); Hot Island Glass Studio & Gallery (% 808-
572-4527; www.hotislandglass.com), a fascinating glassblower’s
studio that’s worth a peek; and the Garcia Studio Gallery, 3660 Baldwin
Ave. (% 808-573-5972; www.garciastudiogallery.com), specializing
in island-themed art, plus the compellingly multilayered koi portraits of
Terry Gilecki.
Altitude, 3660 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-573-4733), specializes in high-
quality, high-spirited clothing and accessories for women from such
brands as Eileen Fisher, Glima, and Hobo; and much, much more. You’ll
find another beautifully curated, casually elegant collection of women’s
wear at Isabelle Buell’s Holiday & Co., located in the historic K. Matsui
Store, at 3681 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-572-1470).
Maui Master Jewelers, 3655 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-573-5400), specializes
in gold, silver, platinum, and semiprecious and precious beaded jewelry
by some of the state’s finest jewelry designers. Definitely worth a look
are the bamboo designs by Carol and Michael Schwartz, as well as the
collection of New Zealand jade pieces.
Chapter 14: Shopping the Local Stores 255

I highly recommend simply parking and browsing Baldwin and Makawao
avenues to realize the full creative bounty of this charming town.
The true gem of Makawao is the Hui Noeau Visual Arts Center, a mile
outside of town, at 2841 Baldwin Ave. (% 808-572-5194; www.huinoeau.
com). A tree-lined driveway leads to the 1917 estate that houses the
island’s most renowned artists’ collection and features rotating exhibits
plus an excellent shop. The center has a $2 suggested donation for the
exhibit gallery.
Kula
Want to send some of those gorgeous Maui flowers back home to some-
one special — maybe yourself? Head Upcountry to the slopes of
Haleakala, to the Upcountry Harvest Gift Shop, on Haleakala Highway
(Highway 377; % 800-575-6470; www.upcountryharvest.com), adja-
cent to the Kula Lodge & Restaurant (see Chapter 11). The stunning
protea — those oversized flowers that look like they came to Maui from
another planet — are grown on the owners’ own Sunrise Protea Farm.
The shop also features a nice collection of island-style gifts and local
crafts.
For a hand-painted original, visit the Curtis Wilson Cost Gallery, at the
Kula Lodge & Restaurant, off Highway 377 on the way to Haleakala
Crater (% 800-810-2678 or 808-878-6544; www.costgallery.com); the
Maui-based painter is a landscape traditionalist; his islandscapes are
luminescent and alive with detail.
Even if you don’t take the tour, you might want to visit Alii Kula
Lavender Farm, 1100 Waipoli Rd., off Haleakala Highway (Highway 377;
% 808-878-3004; www.aliikulalavender.com), for high-quality 
lavender-themed gifts fragranced with locally grown versions of the
violet herb.
East Maui: Hana
If you make the trip to the far end of the Hana road, don’t miss the Hana
Coast Gallery, on the Hana Highway, adjacent to the Hotel Hana-Maui
(% 808-248-8636; www.hanacoast.com), a gorgeous showcase for
island-made art and products hewn by master craftspeople, including
gorgeous furniture and woodworks.
The quirky Hasegawa General Store (% 808-248-8231) is worth stop-
ping in for kicks (look for the Spam sushi vending machine near the
entrance) or to use the ATM, but the prices on practical items and
munchies are better across the road and up the hill at the Hana Ranch
Store (% 808-248-8261).

M
aui’s nightlife certainly doesn’t rival the after-dark scene on the
island of Oahu. Many of Maui’s restaurants — particularly the
oceanfront ones — do double duty as post-dinner hot spots, often host-
ing lively bar scenes, live music, and dancing. The epicenter of island
nightlife is lively Lahaina.
Finding Your Way Out in the Dark
For the most complete calendar of what’s happening while you’re on
Maui, pick up a copy of the weekly MauiTime Weekly newspaper, avail-
able for free at kiosks all over the island. The week’s live music and DJ
entertainment is featured in easy-to-scan grid form near the back of the
paper. Current movie listings and showtimes are also listed in the paper.
If you’re interested in the more refined performing arts, look for a copy
of Centerpiece, the free bimonthly magazine published by the Maui Arts
and Cultural Center, the finest cultural venue in the islands; hotel
concierges usually have copies. You can also call the center, which is
located in Kahului, at % 808-242-7469, or visit the Web site at www.
mauiarts.org for a current schedule. The Maui Arts and Cultural
Center dominates the performing-arts scene on the island, featuring a
visual-arts gallery, an outdoor amphitheater, a 300-seat theater for ex-
perimental performances, and a 1,200-seat main theater. The diverse 
calendar sometimes features such big names as Melissa Etheridge, 
David Sanborn, or George Winston; Maui Film Festival screenings; or 
performances by Hawaii’s most renowned musicians. (Don’t miss beauti-
ful island songstress Amy Hanaialii Gilliom if she’s on the calendar.)

The island’s best sunset cruises are offered by Paragon Sailing Charters
(% 800-441-2087 or 808-441-2087; www.sailmaui.com). From Lahaina
Harbor (on Front Street), you’ll sail into the sunset on a state-of-the-art,
high-performance catamaran. These two-hour sails are intimate affairs
(only 24 passengers). Prices are $56 adults, $39 kids 4 to 12, with hors
d’oeuvres and beverages (including champagne, wine, and beer).
Departure times vary seasonally, and cruises aren’t offered every day, 
so call ahead. Discounts are sometimes available if you book online.
And, of course, don’t forget that Maui is home to the finest examples of
the ultimate island form of after-dark entertainment: the luau! I highly
recommend planning to participate in one while you’re on the Valley
Isle, because it’s home to the best commercial luaus in all of Hawaii. For
details, see Chapter 11.
Partying in West Maui
West Maui is the Valley Isle’s party central. Lahaina, in particular, takes
on a festive atmosphere as sunset nears. The restaurants along ocean-
front Front Street boast stellar views and energetic bar scenes, some
with live music. Just stroll the street and join whatever party suits your
fancy.
Among the best spots to join the party are Cheeseburger in Paradise/
Cheeseburger Island Style, 811 Front St. (% 808-661-4855), a regular
forum for live-and-lively music; the Hard Rock Cafe, 900 Front St. 
(% 808-667-7400); Kimo’s, 845 Front St. (% 808-661-4811); and Moose
McGillycuddy’s, 844 Front St. (% 808-891-8600). Mulligan’s on the
Wharf, upstairs at the Wharf Cinema Center in the heart of town, at 658
Front St., across from the banyan tree (% 808-661-8881; www.mulligans
ontheblue.com), offers rollicking live music and Guinness on tap in its
casual Irish pub setting. In the same complex is Cool Cat Cafe (% 808-
667-0908; www.coolcatcafe.com), a charming ’50s cafe with great bur-
gers and live music nightly.
Every Friday from 7 to 10 p.m., as part of Friday Night Is Art Night in
Lahaina, the town’s dozens of art galleries open their doors for special
shows, demonstrations, and refreshments; you can even enjoy strolling
musicians wandering the streets.
Lahaina is also home to two nightly shows that are well worth seeking
out. Don’t pass up an opportunity to see ’Ulalena at the Maui Myth &
Magic Theatre, in Old Lahaina Center, 878 Front St. (% 877-688-4800
or 808-661-9913; www.ulalena.com or www.mauitheatre.com). This
incredible, Broadway-quality, 75-minute live show interweaves the natu-
ral, historical, and mythological tales of the birth of Hawaii using a near-
perfect mix of original contemporary music and dance, ancient chant
and hula, creative lighting, gorgeous costumes, visual artistry (including
some mind-blowing puppets), and live musicianship. This universally
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
258

lauded production is bold, mesmerizing, and like nothing Hawaii has
ever seen before — sort of like Laurie Anderson hooks up with Cirque 
du Soleil in Hawaii. The show is staged at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday through
Saturday; additional shows may be added in high season. Tickets are $60
to $100 adults, $40 to $70 kids ages 3 to 12 — yes, they’ll love ’Ulalena,
too. Don’t miss it! Packages that include dinner and/or VIP access to go
backstage and meet the performers are now also available.
For something completely different, spend an evening at Warren &
Annabelle’s, 900 Front St., in Lahaina (% 808-667-6244; www.hawaii
magic.com). This genuinely fun and surprisingly not cheesy mystery-
and-magic cocktail show stars illusionist Warren Gibson and “Annabelle,”
a ghost from the turn of the 20th century who plays a grand piano — and
even takes your requests. Expect the requisite audience participation, of
course. Tickets are $56 per person (with food and drinks available for an
additional charge); you must be at least 21 to enter. Dinner packages
range from $95 per person. The show is very popular, so book at least a
few days in advance to avoid disappointment; no shows are performed
on Sundays.
An early-evening family-friendly show is sometimes added to the Warren
& Annabelle’s schedule during major school-holiday periods; call for
details.
Kaanapali has its own family-friendly entertainment as well. Kupanaha is
the terrific magic show at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel (% 808-667-0128;
www.kbhmaui.com), starring husband-and-wife illusionists Jody and
Kathleen Baran and their daughters, child-prodigy magicians Katrina
and Crystal. The dazzling show interweaves illusions, Hawaiian hula and
chant, and the stories and myths of ancient Hawaii into a show that the
whole family will love. No kidding — the show has been a huge hit.
Shows are offered Tuesday through Saturday at the family-friendly hour
of 4:45 p.m.; dinner is included, and you’ll be out by 7:30 p.m. Tickets are
$79 to $89 adults, $55 ages 13 to 20, $39 kids 6 to 12, including a three-
course dinner; a kids’ menu is available. Free for kids 5 and under.
For live music in Kaanapali, head to Whaler’s Village, on Kaanapali
Beach, at 2435 Kaanapali Pkwy., where you can take an open-air seat
facing the ocean at the bar at Hula Grill (% 808-667-6636), which fea-
tures Hawaiian music and hula. With tiki torches flickering and the waves
rolling in, you can’t go wrong here. For a slightly quieter vibe, head next
door to Leilani’s on the Beach (% 808-661-4495), where the Beachside
Grill specializes in satisfying tropical cocktails and casual dining; live
music sets the tone on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday afternoons.
In Napili, every Wednesday evening comes alive with traditional and
contemporary Hawaiian music thanks to the Masters of Hawaiian Slack
Key Guitar Concert Series. The weekly event hosts the islands’ finest
musicians, including such local luminaries as Ledward Kaapana, Cyril
Pahinui, Dennis Kamakahi, and others, who come to play music and talk
story in genuine local style. It’s an event not to be missed, especially if
Chapter 15: Living It Up after the Sun Goes Down 259

you’re a live-music fan. Shows take place in the pavilion at the Napili Kai
Beach Resort every Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Check www.slackkey.com
for the current performance calendar; call % 888-669-3858 or 808-669-
3858 for reservations. Tickets are $45.
In Honokowai, stop by Java Jazz & Soup Nutz, 3550 Lower Honoapiilani
Hwy. (% 808-667-0787; www.javajazz.com), a friendly, artsy cafe and
coffee bar offering cocktails and great live jazz in the evening until 9 p.m.,
plus an affordable fine-dining menu. This is a colorfully laid-back place to
hang with locals and visitors alike.
Sipping a Beverage in South Maui
South Maui is quieter overall, but boasts a couple of hopping joints.
Lively Life’s a Beach, 1913 S. Kihei Rd. (next to Foodland), Kihei (% 808-
891-8010; www.mauauibars.com), serves up live music nightly, usually
starting at 10 p.m.
The casual, easygoing South Shore Tiki Lounge, in Kihei Kalama Village,
1913 S. Kihei Rd. (% 808-874-6444; www.southshoretikilounge.com),
specializes in first-class mai tais and affordable food in a fun ’n’ funky tiki
setting; DJs set a party atmosphere most nights.
In the mood for a taste o’ the Emerald Isle while you’re on the Valley
Isle? Head on over to Mulligan’s on the Blue (% 808-874-1131; www.
mulligansontheblue.com), located on the Wailea Blue Golf Course on
Wailea Alanui Drive, across from the Fairmont Kea Lani. Mulligan’s is an
authentic Irish pub, complete with Guinness on tap, traditional pub fare
(in case you’re in the mood for bangers and mash or a potato boxty
while you’re in the islands) and seven TVs complete with satellite sports
channels, plus the kind of panoramic ocean view that only Maui can
offer. Pubgoers enjoy high-quality live music nightly, with a Celtic spin
on Sundays. It’s an all-around excellent place to hang out!
With a 10-foot jumbo screen and 30 TV screens around the room, Moose
McGillycuddy’s, 2511 S. Kihei Rd. (% 808-891-8644), makes a great
place to catch the game.
Hitting the Dance Floor Upcountry
Somewhat unexpectedly, one of the hottest party spots on the island is
Upcountry, in the cowboy town of Makawao. The party never ends at
Casanova, 1188 Makawao Ave., at Baldwin Avenue (% 808-572-0220;
www.casanovamaui.com), a popular Italian restaurant (see Chapter 11).
After the dinner hour on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (plus the
occasional Thurs and Sun), attention turns from the good Italian food to
socializing around the stage and dance floor. Wednesday is traditionally
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
260

a ladies’-night disco; Fridays and Saturdays bring DJs or live music.
Expect good blues, rock, reggae, jazz, Hawaiian, and the top names in
local and visiting entertainment, which generally starts at 9:45 p.m. and
continues to 1:30 a.m.
East Maui Entertainment
Out in quiet Hana, your best place for entertainment is the Hotel Hana-
Maui, where the Paniolo Bar (% 808-248-8211; www.hotelhanamaui.
com) hosts excellent live Hawaiian music daily, except Friday, from 6:30
p.m., plus hula on Thursday and Saturday nights. On Fridays, the enter-
tainment moves to the hotel’s main dining room, Ka’uiki (% 808-248-
8211), which hosts an entertaining hula show and buffet dinner on
Friday nights from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Tickets are $50 adults, $35 kids 
12 and under; advance reservations are recommended.

Chapter 16
Taking a Side Trip 
to Molokai
In This Chapter
 Introducing Molokai
 Deciding where to stay and dine
 Knowing what to see and do
B
orn of volcanic eruptions 1.5 million years ago, Molokai remains a
sleepy Hawaiian time capsule at the dawn of the 21st century. It
has no glitzy resorts, no stoplights, no Starbucks, and no buildings taller
than a coconut tree. Molokai is the least developed, most “Hawaiian” of
all the islands, making it especially attractive to adventure travelers and
those who are willing to venture off the beaten track to find genuine
peace and tranquility.
Molokai lives up to its reputation as the most Hawaiian island chiefly
through its lineage — more people of Hawaiian blood live here than any-
where else. This slipper-shaped island is the cradle of Hawaiian dance
(the hula was born here) and the ancient science of aquaculture. An
aura of mysticism clings to the land, and the old ways still govern life.
The residents survive by taking fish from the sea, hunting wild pigs and
axis deer on the range, and subsistence farming on 40-acre farmstead
plots bestowed by the government to residents with pure Hawaiian
blood. Some folks even still catch fish in throw nets and troll the reef 
for squid.
Not everyone loves Molokai. It’s a rustic, rural place — you won’t find
any sophisticated resorts or restaurants, or much in the way of shop-
ping and organized diversions. This is especially true now that the
Molokai Ranch — the sole source of luxury-style accommodations and
dining on the island, not to mention most of its activities, including the
island’s main golf course and sole movie theater — is shuttered. Instead,
visiting Molokai is all about communing with nature. Molokai rewards
you with Hawaii’s highest waterfall and its greatest collection of fish-
ponds, its longest barrier reef, and the world’s tallest sea cliffs, plus
sand dunes, rain forests, hidden coves, and gloriously empty beaches.
The slow-paced, simple life and the absence of modern development

attract people in search of the “real” Hawaii, which is quickly disappear-
ing on the other islands, if not already gone. If you want rockin’ nightlife,
you’re in the wrong place; Molokai shuts down after sunset. The only
public diversions are softball games under the lights of Mitchell Pauole
Field and a few restaurants that stay open after dark, often serving local
brew and pizza.
Rugged, red-dirt Molokai isn’t for everyone, but anyone who likes to
explore remote places and seek their own adventures should love it. If
that sounds like you, the funky “friendly island” just may enchant you as
the real Hawaii of your dreams.
Getting to Know Molokai
Rural, small-town Kaunakakai (ka-oo-na-ka-keye) is the closest thing
Molokai has to a business district. Rabang’s Filipino Food posts bad
checks in the window; antlered deer-head trophies guard the grocery
aisles at Misaki’s Market; and Kanemitsu’s, the town’s legendary bakery,
churns out fresh loaves of onion-cheese bread daily. Set on a flat, dusty
plain, with its Old West–style storefronts laid out in a three-block grid,
Kaunakakai is a town from the past. At the end of Wharf Road is Molokai
Wharf, the local place to fish, photograph, and just hang out. Kaunakakai
is the dividing point between the lush, verdant East End and the dry,
arid West End: On the west side of town stand cactuses, while on the
east side there’s thick, green vegetation.
Molokai’s top attraction is Kalaupapa National Historic Park, where
Father Damien established his famous leper colony. Touring this remote,
poignant site is a memorable journey best made on the back of a trusty
mule, who will safely carry you down a spectacular, steep trail. It’s an all-
day adventure, and the trip of a lifetime. Even if you’re not staying on
Molokai, the mule ride can be done as a day trip from Maui. If you’re only
visiting Molokai briefly, don’t miss it. See “The legacy of Father Damien:
Kalaupapa National Historic Park,” near the end of this chapter, for com-
plete details. Read about it and decide if you’d like to sign up before you
arrive; it’s important to make reservations well in advance of your visit.
On the North Coast, upland from Kaunakakai, the land tilts skyward 
and turns vibrantly green, lush with scented plumeria and glossy coffee
trees, until it blooms into a true forest — and then abruptly ends at a
great precipice, falling 3,250 feet to the sea. The green sea cliffs are
creased with five deeply veined V-shaped crevices. The North Coast is a
remote, forbidding place, with a solitary peninsula — Kalaupapa — that
was once the final stopping point for exiled lepers. It’s now a national
historical park that commemorates the peninsula’s cruel fate as well as
the courageousness of those who were exiled there. This region is easy
on the eyes but difficult to visit. It lies at a cool elevation, and rain
squalls can blow in from the ocean. In summer, the ocean is calm, pro-
viding great opportunities for kayaking, fishing, and swimming; however,
during the rest of the year, giant waves come rolling onto the shores.
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 263

The West End of the island is largely comprised of stark desert terrain,
bordered by the most beautiful white-sand beaches in Hawaii. Here is
where the 53,000-acre Molokai Ranch once operated the island’s pre-
mier guest facilities, but everything is boarded up now. The rugged
rolling land slopes down to Molokai’s only resort development,
Kaluakoi, a cul-de-sac of condos clustered around a seafront hotel (built
three decades ago, but also now empty and shuttered) near 3-mile-long
Papohaku, the island’s biggest beach. On the way to Kaluakoi, you find
Maunaloa, a 1920s-era pineapple-plantation town that was in the
process of being transformed into a master-planned community before
the Molokai Ranch’s Singapore owners pulled out in the face of staunch
local opposition to proposed luxury development. It hardly ever rains
on the dry West End, but when it does (usually in the winter), expect a
downpour and plenty of red mud.
The area east of Kaunakakai becomes lush, green, and tropical, with
golden pocket beaches and a handful of affordable cottages and condos.
With this voluptuous landscape comes rain. However, most storms are
brief (15-minute) affairs that blow in, dry up, and disappear. Winter is
Hawaii’s rainy season, so expect more rain from January through March;
but even then, the storms usually are brief and the sun comes back out.
Beyond Kaunakakai, the two-lane road curves along the coast past pig
farms, palm groves, and a 20-mile string of fishponds as well as an
ancient heiau (sacred Hawaiian religious site), Damien-built churches,
and a few contemporary condos by the sea. The road ends in the glori-
ous Halawa Valley, one of Hawaii’s most beautiful valleys.
Settling Into Molokai
The Molokai Visitors Association is located in the Moore Center, 2
Kamoi St., Suite 200, in Kaunakakai (% 800-800-6367 from the mainland
and Canada, 808-553-3876, or 808-553-5221; www.molokai-hawaii.com).
The staff can give you all the information you need on what to see and
do while you’re on the island. Feel free to stop by their office; it’s open
Monday through Friday. Also check out www.visitmolokai.com for
comprehensive visitor information.
Arriving on Molokai
Visitors arrive at Hoolehua Airport, also known as the Molokai Airport
(MKK). It’s on a dusty plain about 6 miles from Kaunakakai town.
Multiple flights land daily from the neighbor islands, although there is
no direct service to Molokai from the mainland. For interisland service,
contact Island Air (% 800-652-6541 or 808-565-6744; www.islandair.
com); you can also book your Island Air flights via codeshare, through
Hawaiian Airlines (% 800-367-5320; www.hawaiianair.com). You can
also book interisland flights with go! Airlines (% 888-IFLYGO2 [888-
435-9462]; www.iflygo.com).

Molokai’s Top Attractions
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 265

You can also get to Molokai by taking a ferry from Maui. Molokai Ferry
(% 866-307-6524; www.molokaiferry.com) offers ferry service twice a
day, Monday through Saturday, in each direction between Lahaina and
Molokai on the Maui Princess and the Molokai Princess. Travel time is
approximately 90 minutes, and the one-way fare is $40 adults, $20 kids 4
to 12. One-day golf and guided sightseeing tours of Molokai are also
available.
Molokai day-trip packages from Maui
In addition to daily ferry service, the Molokai Princess ferry (% 877-
500-6284; www.mauiprincess.com) also offers two different package
options for Molokai island exploration from Maui: a Cruise-Car package,
which includes round-trip passage and a rental car for $191 for the
driver, $76 per additional adult passenger, and $38 for children; or the
Alii Tour, a guided tour in an air-conditioned van plus lunch for $191
adults, $134 children.
Molokai Outdoors (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-
outdoors.com) can also arrange day or overnight packages via air and
ferry, including daylong Kalaupapa fly, hike, and mule-ride packages.
Getting around
Getting around Molokai isn’t easy if you don’t have a rental car, and
rental cars are often hard to find. On holiday weekends, car-rental agen-
cies simply run out of cars. Book before you go.
Molokai doesn’t have any municipal transit or shuttle service, but a 
24-hour taxi service is available (see the section “Taking a taxi or tour”
later).
Renting a car
Rental cars are available from Budget (% 800-527-0700 or 808-567-6877;
www.budget.com) and Dollar (% 800-800-4000, 800-342-7398, or 808-
567-6156; www.dollar.com); both agencies are located at the Molokai
Airport. Molokai Outdoors (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.
molokai-outdoors.com) may be able to get you special rates through
Dollar; it’s worth price-comparing.
Island Kine Auto Rental (% 866-527-7368 or 808-553-5242; www.
molokai-car-rental.com) often has cheaper rates than the national
brands. Barbara Shonely and her son, Steve, will meet you at the
Molokai Airport, take you to their office in Kaunakakai, and recommend
specific outfitters for your activities. Their used cars are in very good
condition and are air-conditioned. Vans and pickup trucks are also avail-
able. You don’t need a four-wheel-drive vehicle unless you’re planning
some specialized hiking, but if that’s the case, Island Kine has what
you’re looking for.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
266

Taking a taxi or tour
Molokai Off-Road Tours & Taxi (% 808-553-3369; www.molokai.com/
offroad) offers regular taxi service, an airport shuttle, and a full slate 
of island tours, including a one-day island tour from Maui for $211 per
person, including airfare ($154 per person from Oahu). An island high-
lights tour is $49 per person.
Molokai Outdoors (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-
outdoors.com) also offers taxi and shuttle services, plus guided island
day tours on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays for $167 per person,
including a sit-down lunch at the Hotel Molokai. Shorter and custom
options are also available; check the Web site for the full suite of offers.
Finding a Place to Stay
Molokai doesn’t offer many places to stay, but it’s Hawaii’s most afford-
able island when it comes to accommodations. And because few restau-
rants are on the island, most hotel rooms and condo units come with
kitchens, which can save you a bundle on dining costs. If you require
anything beyond basic accommodations, you’re better off on another
island.
In the following listings, each hotel’s name is followed by a number of
dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). Each represents the
median rack-rate price range for a double room per night, as follows:
Symbol
Meaning
$
Cheap — less than $150 per night
$$
Still affordable — $150–$224
$$$
Moderate — $225–$324
$$$$
Expensive but not ridiculous — $325–$449
$$$$$
Ultraluxurious — $450 or more per night
Don’t forget that the state adds 11.42 percent in taxes to your hotel bill.
But parking is free at all of these easygoing properties.
In addition to the choices below, Molokai Outdoors (% 877-553-4477 or
808-553-4477; www.molokai-outdoors.com) offers access to a range of
vacation rentals around the island; check the Web site or call for details
on what’s available to suit your needs.
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 267

A’ahi Place
$
Kaunakakai
Just outside the main town of Kaunakakai and up a small hill lies this
simple cedar vacation cottage, complete with a wicker-filled sitting area,
a full kitchen (with microwave, coffeemaker, and toaster, but no dish-
washer), and two full-size beds. Two lanais make great places to just sit
and enjoy the stars at night. Tropical plants, flowers, and fruit trees sur-
round the entire property. For $10 more per night (for two), get all the fix-
ings for a continental breakfast (homegrown Molokai coffee, fresh-baked
goods, and fruit from the property) placed in the kitchen so that you can
enjoy it at your leisure. A’ahi Place is rather dated and not fancy by any
means, but if you want a quiet getaway with no phone or TV to distract
you, this is the place. And for people who want to really explore Molokai,
the central location is perfect.
If your budget is really tight, ask about the separate no-frills “backpacker’s
cabin.” It’s tiny and rather spartan, but you can’t argue with a price tag of
only $35 per night.

fast. Extra person $20. 3-night minimum stay (or $30 cleaning fee). 7th night free. No
credit cards.
Aloha Beach House
$$$
The East End
Nestled on the lush East End, this pretty Hawaiian-style beach house sits
right on the white-sand beach of Waialua. Perfect for families, this impec-
cably decorated two-bedroom, one-bathroom, 1,600-square-foot beach
house can sleep up to five people. The huge living/dining/kitchen area
opens out to an old-fashioned porch for meals or just sitting in the comfy
chairs and watching the clouds roll by. It’s fully equipped, from the com-
plete kitchen (including a dishwasher) and washer/dryer to satellite TV,
VCR (plus a library of videos), and CD player to all the beach toys imagi-
nable. Outdoor amenities include a barbecue and outdoor hot shower.
Pleasing through and through, and well located near the Neighborhood
Store.
See map p. 269. Located just after mile marker 19. % 888-828-1008 or 808-828-1100.
Fax: 808-828-2199. www.molokaivacation.com. Rack rates: $290 per night or
$2,135 weekly for 2 people, plus $175 cleaning fee. Extra person $20 per night (up to
5 total), with $225 cleaning fee; $2,325–$2,605 per week. 3-night minimum stay. No
credit cards.

secluded beach that’s good for swimming and snorkeling — you feel like
you’re on your own private island. The Puunana Cottage has a king-size
bed and two twin beds; it sits atop a bluff and has beach access via a single
flight of steps. The Pauwalu has a queen-size bed and two twin beds; it sits
at beach level, which makes it a better choice for families with small chil-
dren or anyone with access issues. Each has a full kitchen with microwave,
VCR, ceiling fans, a washer and dryer, comfortable tropical furniture, large
furnished deck (perfect for whale-watching in winter), outdoor barbecue,

Hotel Molokai
$$
Kaunakakai
If you love midcentury tiki architecture, the Hotel Molokai is for you. This
nostalgic Hawaiian motel complex is gloriously frozen in time. Reminiscent
of an old-school Polynesian village, it’s composed of a series of modified
A-frame units, nestled under coco palms along a narrow but lovely gray-
sand beach with a great view of Lanai. The rooms are basic (ask for one
with a ceiling fan) but offer lanais. The friendly, caring management has
lovingly renovated the hotel. Don’t expect luxury, by any means, but you
can expect fresh paint, tropical fabrics and furnishings. Every room has
cable TV, high-speed Internet, a fridge, a clock radio, and a coffeemaker;
few have kitchenettes. A half-dozen still bear the upgraded décor from
their days as privately owned units; ask if any are available while you’re on
the island. The casual Hula Shores dining room has surprisingly good food
and cocktails, plus a prime location on the sand. The hotel is the only place
on Molokai with nightly entertainment, making this the liveliest spot on
the island; Friday nights are especially worth seeking out. There’s a petite

Jack and Cheryl Corbiell offer a spacious and private 900-square-foot,
ground-floor apartment in their home that makes a pleasant and afford-
able place to stay for couples or families. Their home is located in a normal
middle-class neighborhood not far from Kaunakakai town. The simple but
pleasant suite boasts a fully equipped kitchen with microwave, a com-
fortable living room, a kitchen and dining area, a double bedroom, and a
full bathroom; the living room can accommodate kids on two daybeds. The
unit is outfitted with cable TV and CD player. A large lanai furnished for

dining overlooks a fragrant tropical garden and orchard; you’re welcome
to pick from the bounty for your meals, or simply watch the birds that flut-
ter through the garden. Picnic and beach gear is on hand for guests.
Breakfasts are hearty, country-style affairs accompanied by fresh fruit, and
served on the lanai by your hostess. Cheryl is extremely friendly and full
of helpful information for visitors, and the home’s central location makes
a convenient base for exploring the island. If you’re allergic to pet dander,
you’ll want to keep in mind that there is a cat in residence (though not in
the rental unit).

Ke Nani Kai Resort Condominiums
$–$$
The West End
This place is great for families, who appreciate the space. The large apart-
ments are set up for full-time living with real kitchens, washer/dryers,
VCRs, attractive furnishings, and breezy lanais. You also have access to a
huge pool, a hot tub, a volleyball court, and tennis courts. These condos
are farther from the sea than other local accommodations, but still just a
brief walk from the beach. Parking and garden areas surround the two-
story buildings. The only downside: Maid service is only every third day.
In addition to handling Ke Nani Kai and Paniolo Hale (see later), Tropical

Paniolo Hale
$$
The West End
The Paniolo Hale is one of Molokai’s most charming lodgings and proba-
bly its best value. The two-story, old Hawaiian ranch-house design is airy
and homey, with oak floors and walls of folding-glass doors that open 
to huge screened verandas, doubling your living space. The one- and 
two-bedroom units come with two bathrooms and easily accommodate
three or four people. Some units have hot tubs on the lanai. All are spa-
cious, comfortably furnished, and well equipped, with full kitchens and
washer/dryers. The whole place overlooks the now-shuttered Kaluakoi
Golf Course, a green barrier that separates these condos from the rest 
of Kaluakoi Resort. Out front, Kepuhi Beach is a scenic place for walkers
and beachcombers, but the seas are too hazardous for most swimmers;
swimmable Papohaku Beach is just a few minutes away. A pool, paddle

tennis, and barbecue facilities are on the property, which adjoins open
grassland. As with most condominiums in a rental pool, the quality and
upkeep of the individually owned units can vary widely. When booking,
spend some time talking with the friendly people at Tropical Island
Properties so that you can get a top-quality condo that has been renovated
recently.

Pu’u O Hoku Ranch
$$
The East End
Escape to a working cattle ranch! Pu’u o Hoku (“Hill of Stars”) Ranch, which
spreads across 14,000 acres of pasture and forests, is the last place to stay
before you reach the wild Halawa Valley; it’s at least an hour’s drive along
the shoreline from Kaunakakai. The main lodge building, which sleeps 22,
hosts large groups, including retreats, seminars, and family reunions. But
you’re more likely to be interested in booking the separate cottage or the
Grove House.
Two acres of tropically landscaped property circle the ranch’s rustic cot-
tage, which boasts breathtaking views of rolling hills and the Pacific Ocean.
The 1,050-square-foot wooden cottage features comfortable country fur-
niture, a full kitchen, two bedrooms (one with a double bed, one with two
twin beds), two bathrooms, and a separate dining room on the enclosed
lanai. The 2,100-square-foot Grove House has four bedrooms (two with
queen-size beds and two with two twin beds). It also features a fully
equipped kitchen, a fireplace, and an inviting lanai.
You can stargaze at night, hike miles of trails in the afternoon, or relax on
a secluded white-sand beach 2 miles down the road. (And, of course,
horseback riding is available at the ranch.) TVs and VCRs are available in
both units, and guests are usually welcome to use the pool at the main
lodge. Both cottages boast stunning views of Maui and marvelous whale-
watching in winter.

Dining
Molokai is all about adventure, the outdoors, and getting away from it
all. When it comes to dining, the offerings are sparse. Mom-and-pop
eateries dominate the scene. They’re nothing fancy — most of them are
fast-food or takeout places, and many feature simple, hearty home cook-
ing. Molokai doesn’t cater to food and wine connoisseurs, especially
now that the ranch is closed.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
272

Molokai’s restaurants are inexpensive or moderately priced, and several
of them don’t accept credit cards. Regardless of where you eat, you cer-
tainly don’t have to dress up. In most cases, I list just the town rather
than the street address — street addresses are as meaningless on this
island as fancy cars and sequins. Reservations aren’t accepted unless
otherwise noted.
In the restaurant listings that follow, each restaurant name is followed by
a number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). The dollar
signs are meant to give you an idea of what a complete dinner for one
person — with appetizer, main course, a drink, tax, and tip — is likely to
cost. The price categories go like this:
Symbol
Meaning
$
Cheap eats — less than $20 per person
$$
Still inexpensive — $20–$34
$$$
Moderate — $35–$49
$$$$
Pricey — $50 or more
To give you an even better idea of how much you can expect to spend, I
also include the price range of main courses or items in the listings.
(Prices can change at any time, of course, but restaurants usually don’t
raise their prices by more than a dollar or two at any given time.)
Note: The restaurants reviewed here are plotted on the “Molokai
Accommodations and Dining” map on p. 269.
Hula Shores
$$$
Kaunakakai
AMERICAN/ISLAND
This is my favorite place to dine on Molokai. This open-air dining room
with the warm tropical vibe sits right on the ocean — the waves practi-
cally lap at your toes — with a view of Lanai, torches flickering under palm
trees, and tiny fairy lights lining the room and the neighboring pool area.
It’s a casual setting for dinner or cocktails, with the most pleasing ambi-
ence on the island. Lunch choices stick to hearty island basics, such as
salads prepared with Big Island organic greens and sandwiches, from roast
beef to grilled mahimahi. I like the Asian salad wrap with char-sui pork. As
the sun sets and the torches are lit for dinner, the menu turns to more sub-
stantial meats, ribs, fish, and pasta. Try the fresh catch or the Korean kalbi
ribs. All in all, the food is surprisingly good, as are the tropical cocktails;
don’t miss the li hing mui margarita for a real island treat. This is the only
place on the island with live entertainment nightly; Friday night is the most
festive night of the week.

purple color, made from Okinawan sweet potato), haupia, mango, and
many other tropical — and traditional — flavors. Schoolchildren and their

Kanemitsu’s Bakery & Restaurant
$
Kaunakakai
BAKERY/DELI
Morning, noon, and night, this local legend fills the Kaunakakai air with
the intoxicating aroma of fresh-baked bread. Taro lavosh and Molokai
bread (developed in 1935 in a cast-iron, kiawe-fired oven) are the hot 
sellers. Flavors range from apricot-pineapple to mango (in season), but the
classics remain the regular white, wheat, cheese, sweet, and onion-cheese
breads. The bread mixes are a great way to take a taste of Molokai home
with you. In the adjoining coffee shop/deli, all sandwiches come with their
own freshly baked buns and breads. The hamburgers, egg-salad sand-
wiches, mahi burgers, and honey-dipped fried chicken are popular and
cheap. Ask the locals about the nighttime bread line, which is among the
island’s finest after-dark activities.

$$
En route to north coast
AMERICAN
An old wagon in front of a former plantation house marks this down-home
takeout spot, which some consider to be the best food on Molokai now
that that Molokai Lodge restaurant is closed. I’m hard pressed to disagree.
Local residents flock here, not only for the family atmosphere but also for
the oversize servings. Breakfasts feature giant omelets, homemade corned
beef hash, and, for diners who dare, The Works — buttermilk pancakes,
eggs, and home fries (you’ll either be fueled for the day or ready to take a
nap). Lunch can either be a burger or sandwich, or one of their humon-
gous plate lunches of pork katsu or chicken, served up with rice, of course.
Prime-rib Thursdays are worth planning for. No alcohol is served, but
you’re welcome to bring your own.

PIZZA
The excellent pizzas and sandwiches make this a major gathering place
for locals. The best-selling pies are the Molokai (pepperoni and cheese),
the Big Island (pepperoni, ham, mushroom, Italian sausage, bacon, and
vegetables), and the Molokini (plain cheese slices). Pasta, sandwiches, and
very good daily fish specials round out the menu; the fresh-baked subma-
rine and pocket sandwiches and the gyro pocket with spinach pie are hits.
Sunday is prime-rib day, Wednesday is Mexican, and Hawaiian plates are
sold on Thursdays. Coin-operated cars and a toy airplane follow the chil-
dren’s theme, but adults feel equally at home with the very popular bar-
becued baby-back-rib plate and the fresh fish dinners. Children’s art and
letters in the tiled dining room add an entertaining and charming touch.

The East End
AMERICAN
The Neighborhood Store is nothing fancy, and that’s what folks love about
it. This store/lunch counter appears like a mirage near mile marker 16, in
the Pukoo area, en route to the East End. Picnic tables under a royal poin-
ciana tree are a wonderful sight, and the food doesn’t disappoint. The place
serves omelets, Portuguese sausage, and other breakfast specials (brunch
is very popular) and then segues into sandwiches, salads, mahimahi plates,
and varied over-the-counter lunch offerings. Favorites include the mahi-
mahi plate lunch, the chicken katsu, and the Mexican plate, each one with
a tried-and-true home-cooked flavor. The Neighborhood Store offers daily
specials, ethnic dishes, and some vegetarian options, as well as burgers
(including a killer veggie burger), saimin, and legendary desserts. Made-on-
Maui Roselani ice cream is a featured attraction, and customers rave over
the Portuguese doughnut dessert, a deep-fried doughnut filled with ice
cream. A Molokai treasure, the Neighborhood Store is also the only gro-
cery store on the East End.

herbs, potatoes, watermelon, and other local produce, complementing its
selection of vitamins, cosmetics, and health aids, as well as bulk and shelf
items. But the real star is the closet-size lunch counter. The salads, 
burritos, tempeh sandwiches, vegetarian potpie, tofu-spinach lasagna, and
mock chicken, turkey, and meatloaf (made from oats, sprouts, seeds, and
seasonings) are testament to the fact that vegetarian food need not be
boring. It’s a must for health-conscious diners and shoppers.

Having Fun on and off the Beach
With imposing sea cliffs on one side and lazy fishponds on the other,
Molokai has little room for beaches along its 106-mile coast — but the
beaches that are accessible certainly provide an array of watersports.
There’s plenty of action on dry land, too, including golf and biking.
If you want to see the most Hawaiian island with a knowledgeable guide,
contact Molokai Outdoors (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.
molokai-outdoors.com). Molokai Outdoors offers the most compre-
hensive suite of guided activities on the island, from biking, hiking, and
horseback riding adventures to ocean kayaking and deep-sea fishing
adventures; they even offer packaged Kalaupapa sightseeing. Check out
the Web site to review its full slate of adventures.
Discovering Molokai’s beaches
A big gold-sand beach awaits on the West End, in addition to tiny pocket
beaches on the East End. The emptiness of Molokai’s beaches is both a
blessing and a curse: The seclusion means no lifeguards on any of the
beaches.
At the foot of scenic Halawa Valley is Halawa Beach Park, a beautiful
black-sand beach with a palm-fringed lagoon, a wave-lashed island off-
shore, and a distant view of the West Maui Mountains across the Pailolo
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
276

Channel. The swimming is safe in the shallows close to shore, but where
the waterfall stream meets the sea, the ocean is often murky and unnerv-
ing. A winter swell creases the mouth of Halawa Valley on the north side
of the bay and attracts a crowd of local surfers. Facilities are minimal;
bring your own water. To get there, take King Kamehameha V Highway
(Highway 450) east to the end.
Golfers see Kepuhi Beach, a picturesque golden strand in front of the
closed Kaluakoi Resort and Golf Course, as just another sand trap, but
sunbathers like the semiprivate grassy dunes; they’re seldom, if ever,
crowded. Beachcombers often find what they’re looking for there, but
swimmers have to dodge lava rocks and risk riptides. Oh, yes — look out
for errant golf balls. The beach doesn’t have any facilities or lifeguards,
so be sure to pack in anything you might need.
Murphy Beach Park was formerly Kumimi Beach Park, and some old-
timers still call it Kumimi Beach, but, just to make everything more con-
fusing, some people call it Jaycees Park. No matter what you call it,
ironwood trees line this white-sand beach and shade the small, quaint
park. Swimming is generally safe. On calm days, snorkeling and diving
are great outside the reef. You may spot some fishermen there, looking
for papio and other island fish.
One Alii Beach Park, a thin strip of sand, once reserved for the alii
(chiefs), is the oldest public beach park on Molokai. You find One (o-
nay) Alii Beach Park by a coconut grove on the outskirts of Kaunakakai.
Safe for swimmers of all ages and abilities, it often draws crowds of fami-
lies on weekends, but it can be all yours on weekdays. Facilities include
outdoor showers, restrooms, and free parking.
Nearly 3 miles long and 100 yards wide, gold-sand Papohaku Beach is
one of the biggest in Hawaii. It’s great for walking, beachcombing, pic-
nics, and sunset-watching year-round. The big surf and riptides make
swimming risky except in summer, when the waters are calmer. Go early
in the day, when the tropical sun is less fierce and the winds are calm.
The beach is so big that you may never see another soul except at
sunset, when a few people gather on the shore in hopes of spotting the
elusive green flash, a natural wonder that takes place when the horizon
is cloud free. Facilities include outdoor showers, restrooms, picnic
grounds, and free parking.
Sandy Beach is Molokai’s most popular swimming spot — it’s ideal for
families with small kids. The beach is a roadside pocket of gold sand pro-
tected by a reef, with a great view of Maui and Lanai. You’ll find it off the
King Kamehameha V Highway (Highway 450) at mile marker 20. The beach
doesn’t have any facilities — just you, the sun, the sand, and the surf.
Enjoying the water
The best places to rent beach toys (snorkels, body boards, beach chairs,
fishing poles, kayaks, and more) is Molokai Outdoors, in the lobby of
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 277

the Hotel Molokai, just outside Kaunakakai (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-
4477; www.molokai-outdoors.com). Here you’ll find everything you
need for a day at the beach, plus advice on where it’s safe to swim or
where the waves are breaking. Another good place to check out is
Molokai Fish & Dive, Kaunakakai (% 808-553-5926; www.molokaifish
anddive.com), a mind-boggling store filled with outdoor gear. You can
rent snorkels, fishing gear, and even ice chests. This place is also a hot
spot for fishing news and tips on what’s running where.
Body boarding and bodysurfing
Molokai has only three beaches that offer rideable waves for body
boarding and bodysurfing: Papohaku, Kepuhi, and Halawa. Even these
beaches are only for experienced bodysurfers due to the strength of the
rip currents and undertows.
You can rent body boards with fins for $5 a day or $20 a week at Molokai
Outdoors, in the lobby of the Hotel Molokai, just outside Kaunakakai 
(% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-outdoors.com).
Ocean kayaking
During the summer months, when the waters on the North Shore are
calm, Molokai offers some of the most spectacular kayaking in Hawaii.
However, most of Molokai is for the experienced kayaker. You must be
adept in paddling through open ocean swells and rough waves.
Molokai Outdoors, in the lobby of the Hotel Molokai, just outside
Kaunakakai (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-outdoors.
com), has several different kayak tours, including routes that explore the
ancient Hawaii fishponds and the inshore reefs. The standard Down-
winder Kayak Adventure is suitable for kayakers from beginning to
advanced; you’ll paddle about 6 miles inside one of the U.S.’s most pris-
tine reefs for magical snorkeling. The per-person rate is $89, plus $10 if
you’d like lunch to be provided.
Molokai Fish & Dive (% 808-553-5926; www.molokaifishanddive.
com) also offered guided ocean kayaking tours for all levels of kayakers;
their six-hour adventure is $89 per person, including lunch. Kayak
rentals are available as well; single boats are $26 per day or $113 per
week, while doubles are $39 per day or $167 per week. (Double renters
will need to rent an extra paddle for $5 per day or $24 per week.)
Scuba diving
Want to see turtles or manta rays up close? How about sharks? Contact
Molokai Fish & Dive, Kaunakakai (% 808-553-5926; www.molokaifish

along the longest fringe reef in the islands, using top-of-the-line equip-
ment. Two-tank dives are $135, three-tank dives are $275, and Discover
Scuba outings for beginners are $195.

Snorkeling
Molokai offers excellent snorkeling. You’re like to spot a wide range of
butterfly fish, tangs, and angelfish. Most of the island’s beaches are too
dangerous for snorkeling in winter, when big waves and strong currents
are generated by storms that sweep down from Alaska. From mid-
September through April, stick to Murphy Beach Park (also known as
Kumimi Beach Park) on the East End. But in summer (roughly May to
mid-Sept), the Pacific Ocean takes a holiday and turns into a flat lake. In
these calmer months, the whole west coast of Molokai opens up for
snorkeling.
Molokai Outdoors (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-
outdoors.com) offers the least-expensive snorkel gear for rent ($6 a day
or $24 a week). You can also rent prescription masks in case you have
less than 20/20 vision.
For snorkeling tours, contact Bill Kapuni’s Snorkel & Dive, Kaunakakai
(% 808-553-9867), which charges $65 for a two-and-a-half-hour trip. Bill
also rents snorkeling gear for $10 a day (see “Scuba diving,” earlier).
Walter Naki of Molokai Action Adventures (% 808-558-8184) offers
leisurely snorkeling, diving, and swimming trips in his 21-foot Boston
Whaler for $100 per person for a four- to six-hour custom tour. Molokai
Fish & Dive (% 808-553-5926; www.molokaifishanddive.com) also
offer excellent snorkel tours from its 31-foot twin-hull Power Cat for $69
per person.
Sportfishing
Molokai’s waters can provide prime sporting opportunities, whether
you’re looking for big-game sportfishing or bottom fishing. When cus-
tomers are scarce, Captain Joe Reich, who has been fishing the waters
around Molokai for decades, goes commercial fishing, so he always
knows where the fish are biting. He runs Alyce C. Sportfishing out of
Kaunakakai Harbor (% 808-558-8377; www.alycecsportfishing.com).
A full day of fishing for up to six people is $500, three-quarters of a day is
$450, and a half-day is $400. You can usually persuade him to do a whale-
watching cruise during the winter months.
For fly-fishing or light-tackle reef-fish trolling, contact Walter Naki 
at Molokai Action Adventures (% 808-558-8184). Walter has been 
fishing his entire life and loves to share his secret spots with visiting
fishermen — he knows the place for bonefishing on the flats. A full-day
trip in his 21-foot Boston Whaler is $350 for up to four people. You’re
welcome to call Walter even if you don’t feel like fishing; he’s happy to
take you out snorkeling, whale watching in winter, or just sightseeing
from the sea. He’ll even take you bow or rifle hunting on private land for
axis deer, wild boar, or Spanish goats.
For deep-sea fishing, Captain Mike Holmes’s Fun Hogs Hawaii (% 808-
336-0047; www.molokaifishing.com) has fishing excursions on a 
27-foot, fully equipped sportfishing vessel. For six passengers, both
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 279

near-shore and deep-sea fishing trips are $428 for four hours, $535 for
six hours, and $642 for eight hours. Whale-watching outings are avail-
able in season.
If you just want to try your luck casting along the shoreline, Molokai
Outdoors, located in the lobby of the Hotel Molokai, just outside
Kaunakakai (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-outdoors.
com), rents fishing poles for $5 a day or $24 per week and can tell you
where the fish are biting.
Hitting the links
Now that the Ted Robinson–designed Kaluakoi Golf Course is closed, 
the island’s best option is the Ironwood Hills Golf Course, off Kalae
Highway (% 808-567-6000), Hawaii’s very first golf course. You can
locate it just before the Molokai Mule Ride Mule Barn, on the road to the
Lookout. Del Monte Plantation built Ironwood Hills (named after the two
predominant features of the course, ironwood trees and hills) in 1929 for
its executives. This unusual course, which sits in the cool air at 1,200
feet, delights with its rich foliage, open fairways, and spectacular views
of the island. If you play there, use a trick developed by the local resi-
dents: After teeing off on the 6th hole, just take whatever clubs you need
to finish playing the hole and a driver for the 7th hole and park your bag
under a tree. The climb to the 7th hole is steep — you’ll be glad that
you’re only carrying a few clubs. Greens fees are only $18 for 9 holes and
$24 for 18 holes. Twilight specials are available from 3 p.m.; call for twi-
light rates.
Exploring the island on two wheels
Molokai is a great place to tour by bicycle. The roads aren’t very busy,
and you can always pull off the road and take a quick, refreshing dip.
Molokai Outdoors, in the lobby of the Hotel Molokai, just outside
Kaunakakai (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-outdoors.
com), offers a combination bike-kayak tour of the East End, taking in a
healthy dose of local culture and history as you make your way to a
spectacular waterfall. If you’d prefer to set out on your own, bike rentals
are $26 a day or $113 per week, including a helmet and a bike rack for
your car.
Seeing the Sights
Molokai has plenty of history and beauty that you don’t want to miss.
Let’s get started exploring each region of the island. Note: The following
attractions are plotted on the “Molokai” map on p. 265.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
280

In and around Kaunakakai
Kapuaiwa Coconut Grove/Kiowea Park
This scruffy but still-royal grove — 1,000 coconut trees on 10 acres planted
in 1863 by the island’s high chief Kapua’iwa (later, King Kamehameha V) —
is a major roadside attraction. The shoreline park is a favorite subject of
sunset photographers and visitors who delight in a hand-lettered sign that
warns: DANGER: FALLING COCONUTS. In its backyard, across the highway, stands
Church Row: seven churches, each a different denomination — clear evi-
dence of the missionary impact on Hawaii.
See map p. 265. Along Maunaloa Highway (Highway 460), 2 miles west of Kaunakakai.
Post-A-Nut
Postmaster Margaret Keahi-Leary can help you say “Aloha” with a dried
Molokai coconut. Just write a message on the coconut with a felt-tip pen,
and she’ll send it via U.S. Mail over the sea. Coconuts are free, but postage
starts at $4.95 for a mainland-bound 2-pound coconut.
See map p. 265. At the Hoolehua Post Office, Puu Peelua Avenue (Highway 480), near
Maunaloa Highway (Highway 460, a half-mile from the Molokai Airport). % 808-567-
6144. Open: Mon–Fri 7:30–11:30 a.m. and 12:30–4:30 p.m.
Purdy’s All-Natural Macadamia Nuts (Na Hua O’Ka Aina)
The Purdys have made macadamia-nut buying an entertainment event,
offering tours of the homestead and giving lively demonstrations of nut-
shell cracking in the shade of their towering trees. The tour of the 70-year-
old nut farm explains the growing, bearing, harvesting, and shelling
processes, so that by the time you bite into the luxurious macadamia nut,
you’ll have more than a passing knowledge of its entire life cycle. This is a
great place to purchase gifts — not only delicious macadamia nuts, but
also macadamia blossom honey and macadamia honey-mustard.
See map p. 265. Lihi Pali Avenue (2 miles west of Kualapuu, behind Molokai High School),
Hoolehua. %808-567-6601. www.molokai-aloha.com/macnuts. Admission: Free.
Open: Mon–Fri 9:30 a.m.–3:30 p.m.; Sat 10 a.m.–2 p.m. Closed on holidays.
The North Coast
Even if you don’t get a chance to see Hawaii’s most dramatic coast in its
entirety — not many people do — don’t miss the opportunity to glimpse
it from the Kalaupapa Lookout at Palauu State Park. On the way, I’ve
listed a few diversions, arranged in geographical order en route to the
North Coast.
Coffees of Hawaii
The defunct Del Monte pineapple town of Kualapuu is rising again — only
this time, the crop is coffee, not pineapples. Coffees of Hawaii grows coffee
beans on 600 acres of former pineapple land in the cool foothills, irrigating
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 281

the plants with a high-tech, continuous water and fertilizer drip system.
The whole process is designed to be ecologically friendly; you can see it
on a somewhat pricey, 90-minute mule-drawn wagon tour or walking tour
(call 24 hours in advance to confirm the schedule and reserve a spot).
Harvest season, from November through January, makes for a fun visit;
the flowering coffee trees are a particularly pretty sight in March and April.
Feel free to stop by even if you pass on the tour. The lovely gift shop sells
a variety of coffees, plus arts and crafts from Molokai. Stop by the friendly
Espresso Bar for breakfast, lunch, or a delicious coffee concoction, such
as the Mocha Mama (Molokai coffee, ice cream, and Ghirardelli chocolate).
It’ll keep you going all day — maybe even all night.
See map p. 265. 1630 Farrington Hwy. (Highway 480, near the junction of Highway
470). % 877-322-FARM (877-322-3276) or 808-567-9490. www.coffeesofhawaii.
net. Admission: Morning Espresso walking tour $20; mule-drawn wagon tour $35,
$10 kids 5–15 (free for kids 4 and under). Also inquire about afternoon hiking adven-
tures offered most weekdays at 3 p.m. Gift shop and espresso bar open daily.
Molokai Museum and Cultural Center
En route to the California Gold Rush in 1849, Rudolph W. Meyer, a German
professor, came to Molokai, married the high chieftess Kalama, and began
to operate a small sugar plantation near his home. Now on the National
Register of Historic Places, this restored 1878 sugar mill, with its century-
old steam engine, mule-driven cane crusher, copper clarifiers, and red-
wood evaporating pan (all in working order), is the last of its kind in
Hawaii. The mill also houses a museum that traces the history of sugar
growing on Molokai and features special events, such as wine tastings
every two months, taro festivals, an annual music festival, guided hikes,
and occasional classes in ukulele making, loom weaving, and sewing. Call
for a schedule.
See map p.265. Meyer Sugar Mill, Highway 470 (just after the turnoff for the Ironwood
Hills Golf Course, and 2 miles below Kalaupapa Overlook), Kalae. % 808-567-6436.
Admission: $2.50 adults, $1 students. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–2 p.m.
Palaau State Park
This 234-acre piney-woods park, 8 miles from Kaunakakai, doesn’t look like
much until you get out of the car and take a hike, which literally puts you
between a rock and a hard place. Go right, and you end up on the edge of
Molokai’s magnificent sea cliffs, with its panoramic view of the well-known
Kalaupapa leper colony. Go left, and you come face to face with a stone
phallus.
If you have no plans to scale the cliffs by mule or on foot, I highly recom-
mend visiting the Kalaupapa Lookout, the only place from which to see
the former place of exile. The trail is marked, and historic photos and inter-
pretive signs explain what you’re seeing.
The ironwood forest is airy and cool — perfect for a short uphill walk to
Molokai’s famous Phallic Rock. Six feet high, pointed at an angle that
means business, Phallic Rock is a legendary fertility tool. According to
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
282

Hawaiian legend, a woman who wants to become pregnant need only
spend the night near the rock and, voilà! It’s probably just a coincidence,
of course, but Molokai does have a growing number of young, pregnant
women.
Phallic Rock is at the end of a well-worn uphill path that passes an iron-
wood grove and several other rocks that vaguely resemble sexual body
parts. There’s no mistaking the real thing, though. Supposedly, it belonged
to Nanahoa, a demigod who quarreled with his wife, Kawahuna, over a
pretty girl. In the tussle, Kawahuna was thrown over the cliff, and both
husband and wife were turned to stone. Of all the phallic rocks in Hawaii
and the Pacific, this rock is the one to see. The rock is also featured on a
postcard you might see around town with a tiny, awestruck Japanese
woman standing next to it.
See map p. 265. At the end of Highway 470.
The legacy of Father Damien: Kalaupapa 
National Historic Park
An old tongue of lava that sticks out to form a peninsula, Kalaupapa
became infamous because of the inhumanity unleashed upon victims of
a once-incurable contagious disease.
King Kamehameha V sent the first lepers — nine men and three 
women — into exile on this lonely shore, at the base of ramparts that
rise like temples against the Pacific, on January 6, 1866. By 1874, more
than 11,000 lepers had been dispatched to die in one of the world’s most
beautiful — and lonely — places. They called Kalaupapa “The Place of
the Living Dead.”
Leprosy is actually one of the world’s least contagious diseases, trans-
mitted only by direct, repetitive contact over a long period of time. A
germ, Mycobacterium leprae, which attacks the nerves, skin, and eyes,
causes leprosy. The germ is found mainly, but not exclusively, in tropical
regions. American scientists found a cure for the disease in the 1940s.
Before science found a cure, Father Damien intervened. Born to wealth
in Belgium, Father Damien (born Joseph de Veuster) traded a life of
excess for exile among lepers; he devoted himself to caring for the
afflicted at Kalaupapa. Father Damien volunteered to go out to the
Pacific in place of his ailing brother. Horrified by the conditions he found
in the leper colony, Father Damien worked at Kalaupapa for 11 years,
building houses, schools, and churches, and giving hope to his patients.
He died on April 15, 1889, in Kalaupapa, of leprosy. He was 49.
A hero nominated for Catholic sainthood, Father Damien is buried not 
in his tomb next to Molokai’s St. Philomena Church but in his native
Belgium. (Well, most of him anyway: His hand was recently returned to
Molokai and was buried at Kalaupapa as a relic of his martyrdom.)
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 283

This small peninsula is probably the final resting place of more than
11,000 souls. The sand dunes are littered with grave markers, sorted by
the religious affiliation — Catholic, Protestant, Buddhist — of those who
died there. But because so many are buried in unmarked graves, no
accurate census of the dead exists.
Kalaupapa is now a National Historic Park (% 808-567-6802; www.nps.
gov/kala) and one of Hawaii’s richest archaeological preserves, with
sites that date from A.D. 1000. Only a tiny handful of former patients
chose to remain in the tidy village of whitewashed houses with statues
of angels in their yards. The original name for their former affliction, lep-
rosy, was officially banned in Hawaii by the state legislature in 1981. The
name used now is Hansen’s disease, for Dr. Gerhard Hansen of Norway,
who discovered the germ in 1873. Remaining residents of Kalaupapa still
call the disease leprosy, although none are too keen on being called
lepers.
Kalaupapa welcomes visitors who arrive on foot, by mule, or by small
plane. Father Damien’s St. Philomena church, built in 1872, is open to
visitors, who can see it from a yellow school bus driven by resident tour
guide Richard Marks, an ex-seaman and sheriff who survived the dis-
ease. You can’t roam freely, and you can only enter the museum, the
craft shop, and the church.
Visitors must be 16 years of age or older; you can’t bring the kids along
for this adventure.
Taking a mule ride to Kalaupapa
Riding a mule to Kalaupapa is quite memorable. The first turn is a gasp,
and it’s downhill from there. You can close your eyes and hold on for
dear life, or slip the reins over the pommel and sit back, letting the mule
do the walking down the precipitous path to Kalaupapa National Historic
Park.
Even if you have only one day on Molokai, spend it on a mule. This ride
is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. The cliffs are taller than a 300-story 
skyscraper, but Buzzy Sproat’s mules go safely up and down the narrow
3-mile trail daily, rain or shine. Starting at the top of the nearly perpendi-
cular ridge (1,600 ft. high), the surefooted mules step down the muddy
trail, pausing often on the 26 switchbacks to calculate their next move —
and always, it seems, veering close to the edge. Each switchback is num-
bered; by the time you get to number four, you’ll catch your breath, put
the mule on cruise control, and begin to enjoy Hawaii’s most awesome
trail ride.
The mule tour starts Monday through Saturday at 8 a.m. and lasts until
about 3:15 p.m. The tour costs $175 per person for the all-day adventure,
which includes the round-trip mule ride, a light picnic lunch, a guided
tour of the settlement, a visit to Father Damien’s church and grave,
lunch at Kalawao, and souvenirs. To go, you must be at least 16 years
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
284

old, physically fit, and less than 245 pounds. (Wear closed-toe shoes and
longer pants.) Contact Molokai Mule Ride, 100 Kalae Highway, Suite 104,
on Highway 470, 5 miles north of Highway 460 (% 800-567-7550 or 808-
567-6088 between 8 and 10 p.m.; www.muleride.com). Note: Advance
reservations (at least two weeks ahead) are required, because space is
limited to 18 visitors. They also offer complete packages from Maui that
include round-trip airfare, overnight stay, airport transfers, lunch, and
the mule tour; inquire about options and prices. Complete packages are
also available from Honolulu.
Seeing Kalaupapa by ferry/hiking
From Maui, you can take the Molokai Princess ferry to Molokai (% 866-
307-6524 or 808-662-3355 on Maui; www.mauiprincess.com), where a
van meets you and transports you to the top of the 1,700-foot sea cliffs.
You then hike down the 3-mile trail to the Kalaupapa National Historic
Park. At the park, Damien Tours meets you and gives you a van tour of
the peninsula, during which you visit Father Damien’s St. Philomena
Church and hear the stories of struggle and courage of Kalaupapa’s resi-
dents. Then you’ll have to hike back up the 1,700-foot cliffs, where the
van picks you up and returns you to the ferry dock for the trip back to
Maui. It takes about an hour hiking down and another 90 minutes to hike
back up; it’s a serious challenge, so you have to be in good shape to join
this tour. The cost for ferry, transportation, tour, and lunch is $277. (As
with all the other tours, participants must be 16 years and older. Call
ahead to reserve, as the tour is only offered three times a week in
season.)
On the northwest shore
Undisturbed for centuries, the Moomomi Dunes, on Molokai’s northwest
shore, are a unique treasure chest of great scientific value. The area may
look like just a pile of sand as you fly over on the final approach to
Hoolehua Airport, but Moomomi Dunes are much more. Archaeologists
have found quarries, ancient Hawaiian burial sites, and shelter caves;
botanists have identified five endangered plant species; and marine biol-
ogists are finding evidence that endangered green sea turtles are coming
out from the waters once again to lay eggs there. The greatest discovery,
however, belongs to Smithsonian Institute ornithologists, who have
found bones of prehistoric birds — some of them flightless — that
existed nowhere else on Earth.
Accessible by Jeep trails that thread downhill to the shore, this wild
coast is buffeted by strong afternoon breezes. It’s hot, dry, and windy, so
take water, sunscreen, and a windbreaker.
At Kawaaloa Bay, a 20-minute walk to the west, you find a broad golden
beach that you can have all to yourself. Warning: Due to the rough seas,
stay out of the water. Within the dunes, you find a 920-acre preserve
accessible via monthly guided nature tours led by the Nature Conser-
vancy of Hawaii; call % 808-553-5236 or 808-524-0779 for an exact
schedule and details.
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 285

To get there, take Highway 460 (Maunaloa Highway) from Kaunakakai,
turn right onto Highway 470, and follow it to Kualapuu. At Kualapuu,
turn left on Highway 480 and go through Hoolehua Village; it’s 3 miles to
the bay.
The East End
The East End is a cool and inviting green place that’s worth a drive to
the end of King Kamehameha V Highway (Highway 450). Unfortunately,
the trail that leads into the area’s greatest natural attraction in Halawa
Valley, the Hipuapua Falls, is off-limits because it’s located on private
property.
For ranch rides on the vast east side, contact Molokai Outdoors 
(% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-4477; www.molokai-outdoors.com), which
offers two- and four-hour ranch rides as well as half-day beach adven-
ture rides for $78 to $130 per person, depending on the adventure you
choose.
Riding horseback to Iliiliopae Heiau
On horseback (where the elevated view is magnificent), you bump along
a dirt trail through an incredible mango grove, bound for an ancient
temple of human sacrifice. This temple of doom — right out of Indiana
Jones — is Iliiliopae, a huge rectangle of stone made of 90 million rocks,
overlooking the once-important village of Mapulehu and four ancient
fishponds. The horses trek under the perfumed mangoes, and then head
uphill through a kiawe forest filled with Java plums to the heiau (temple),
which stands across a dry streambed under cloud-spiked Kaunolu, the
4,970-foot island summit.
Hawaii’s most powerful heiau attracted kahuna (priests) from all over
the islands. They came to find out the rules of human sacrifice at this
university of sacred rites. Contrary to Hollywood’s version, historians
say that the chosen victims were always men, not young virgins, and
that they were strangled, not thrown into a volcano, while priests sat on
Lauhala mats watching silently. Spooky, eh?
After the visit to the temple, your horse takes you back to the mango
grove. Contact Molokai Horse & Wagon Rides, King Kamehameha V
Highway (Highway 450), at mile marker 15, Kaunakakai (% 800-670-6965
or 808-558-8132). The tour and horseback ride are $40 adults, $18 kids 2
to 11. The hour-long ride goes up to the heiau, and then beyond it to the
mountaintop for those breathtaking views, and finally back down to the
beach.
Kamakou Preserve
The nearly mile-high summit receives more than 80 inches of rain a 
year — enough to qualify as a rain forest. The Molokai Forest, as it was
historically known, is the source of 60 percent of Molokai’s water. The
Nature Conservancy, which has identified 219 Hawaiian plants that grow
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
286

there exclusively, owns nearly 3,000 acres, from the summit to the low-
land forests of eucalyptus and pine. The preserve is also the last stand
of the endangered Molokai thrush (olomao) and Molokai creeper
(kawawahie).
To get to the preserve, take the Forest Reserve Road from Kaunakakai.
The road is a 45-minute, four-wheel-drive trip on a dirt trail to Waikolu
Lookout Campground. From there, you can venture into the wilderness
preserve on foot across a boardwalk on a one-and-a-half-hour hike. For
more information, contact the Nature Conservancy (% 808-553-5236).
En route to Halawa Valley
No visit to Molokai is complete without at least a passing glance at the
island’s ancient fishponds, a singular achievement in Pacific aquacul-
ture. With their hunger for fresh fish and lack of ice or refrigeration,
Hawaiians perfected aquaculture in 1400, before Christopher Columbus
“discovered” America. They built gated, U-shaped stone and coral walls
on the shore to catch fish on the incoming tide; they then raised them in
captivity. The result: a constant, ready supply of fresh fish.
The ponds, which stretch for 20 miles along Molokai’s south shore and
are visible from Kamehameha V Highway (Highway 450), offer insight
into the island’s ancient population. Approximately a thousand people
tended a single fishpond, and more than 60 ponds once existed on this
coast. All the fishponds are named; a few are privately owned. Some are
silted in by red-dirt runoff from south coast gulches, while some folks,
who raise fish and seaweed, have revived some.
A 3-foot-high, 2,000-foot-long stone wall surrounds the largest, 54-acre
Keawa Nui Pond. You can spot Alii Fish Pond, reserved for kings,
through the coconut groves at One Alii Beach Park. From the road, you
can see Kalokoeli Pond, 6 miles east of Kaunakakai on the highway.
The last stop on the way to Halawa Valley is Mana’e Goods & Grindz,
located at mile marker 16 (% 808-558-8498), a local-style convenience
store on the mountain side of the road featuring a lunch counter and
deli; it makes a great place to pick up bottled water and a snack or
picnic lunch.
Smith Bronte Landing Site
In 1927, Charles Lindbergh soloed the Atlantic Ocean in a plane called The
Spirit of St. Louis and became an American hero. That same year, Ernie
Smith and Emory B. Bronte took off from Oakland, California, on July 14,
in a single-engine Travelair aircraft named The City of Oakland, and headed
across the Pacific Ocean for Honolulu, 2,397 miles away. The next day, after
running out of fuel, they crash-landed upside down in a kiawe thicket on
Molokai but emerged unhurt to become the first civilians to fly to Hawaii
from the U.S. mainland. The 25-hour, 2-minute flight landed Smith and
Bronte a place in aviation history — and on a roadside marker on Molokai.
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 287

See map p. 265. King Kamehameha V Highway (Highway 450), at mile marker 11, on
the makai (ocean) side.
Halawa Valley
Of the five great valleys of Molokai, only Halawa, with its two waterfalls,
golden beach, sleepy lagoon, great surf, and offshore island, is easily
accessible. Unfortunately, the trail through fertile Halawa Valley —
which was inhabited for centuries — and on to the 250-foot Moaula Falls
has been closed for some time. The best way to visit the fertile valley is
on a guided hike with Molokai Outdoors (% 877-553-4477 or 808-553-
4477; www.molokai-outdoors.com). Molokai Outdoors offers the excel-
lent six- to eight-hour East Molokai Tour and Halawa Cultural Hike, which
includes a 21⁄4-mile hike that is rated moderate to advanced thanks to two
river crossings and some rocky areas along the trails. The fee is $188 per
person, including pickup at the airport, harbor, or your hotel, plus a
picnic lunch.
You can spend a day at the county beach park (see earlier in this chap-
ter), but don’t venture into the valley on your own. The valley’s private
landowners, worried about slip-and-fall lawsuits, have posted NO TRES-
PASSING signs on their property.
To get to Halawa Valley, drive north from Kaunakakai on Highway 450 for
30 miles along the coast to the end of the road, which descends into the
valley past Jersalema Hou Church. If you want to catch a glimpse of the
valley on your way to the beach, take a moment at the scenic overlook
along the road: After Puuo Hoku Ranch, at mile marker 25, the narrow
two-lane road widens at a hairpin curve, and you find the overlook on
your right; the drive is 2 miles more to the valley floor.
Shopping the Local Stores
Because many visitors stay in condos or vacation rentals, it’s especially
important to find the local grocery stores, so I have included them in
this section. But serious shoppers won’t find much to do on Molokai.
In downtown Kaunakakai, most of the retail shops sell T-shirts, muumuus,
surf wear, and informal apparel. The Imamura Store (% 808-553-5615)
is a jumble of Hawaiian-print tablecloths, Japanese tea plates, ukulele
cases, and even coconut bikini tops. Molokai Surf, 130 Kamehameha V
Hwy. (% 808-553-5093), offers a broad range of clothing, gear, and
accessories for life in the surf and sun.
You can’t miss the salmon-colored wooden storefront of the Friendly
Isle Market Center (% 808-553-5595), on the main drag of Kaunakakai,
which has an especially good range of produce and healthy foods —
better than standard grocery-store fare. Locals call the Friendly Isle the
most affordable stop for groceries on the island, too.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
288

Across from the Friendly Isle Market is Bamboo Pantry, 107 Ala Malama
St. (% 808-553-3300; www.bamboopantry.com), one of the island’s more
sophisticated shopping stops, specializing in aloha-style housewares
and gifts for home.
Next door to the Molokai Visitor Center is the Molokai Fine Arts
Gallery, in the Moore Business Center, 2 Kamoi St. (% 808-553-8520;
www.molokaifinearts.com). This unassuming but appealing gallery
shop offers the best original art and crafts on the island. The bounty
runs the gamut from original oil paintings and photography to raku pot-
tery, Hawaiian quilt, Niihau shell leis, and Hawaiian heirloom jewelry.
Prices are reasonable.
You can also stock up your kitchen at Misaki’s Grocery and Dry Goods
(% 808-553-5505), established in 1922. You’ll find fresh produce, Boca
Burgers, a good fish counter, and more. Molokai Wines & Spirits (% 808-
553-5009) is your best bet on the island for a decent bottle of wine.
And don’t forget to treat yourself to a loaf of hot bread from Kanemitsu
Bakery’s, 79 Ala Malama St., Kaunakakai (% 808-553-5855). It’s a late-
night ritual for local residents, who line up at the bakery’s back door
beginning at 10 p.m. You can order your fresh bread with butter, jelly,
cinnamon, or cream cheese, and the bakers will cut the hot loaves down
the middle and slather on the works so that it melts in the bread.
En route to the North Coast, Coffees of Hawaii, Highway 480 (near the
junction of Highway 470), Kualapuu (% 877-322-FARM [877-322-3276] or
808-567-9490), is a combination coffee bar/store/gallery. You’ll find great
gifts, including local arts and crafts and island music CDs, as well as a
wide variety of excellent coffee and gourmet goodies, such as chocolate-
covered coffee beans. A stone’s throw away is the Kualapuu Market 
(% 808-567-6243), where you can pick up wine, food, and necessities.
On the West End, the standout store is the Big Wind Kite Factory in
Maunaloa (% 808-552-2364; www.molokai.com/kites). Not only can
you purchase beautifully designed kites (and take free kite-flying classes
when conditions are right), but the adjoining gallery features local and
Balinese handicrafts and Hawaiian-music CDs. Factory tours are offered
daily.
On the East End, the only place for groceries is The Neighborhood Store
’N Counter, in Pukoo (% 808-558-8498), where you can enjoy a solid
breakfast or lunch at the counter, too.
Enjoying Molokai after Dark
Hula Shores at the Hotel Molokai, in Kaunakakai (% 800-367-5004 or
808-553-5347; www.hotelmolokai.com), offers live entertainment from
local musicians, poolside and in the dining room. With its South Seas
ambience and poolside setting, the hotel has become the island’s premier
Chapter 16: Taking a Side Trip to Molokai 289

venue for local and visiting entertainers. Aloha Fridays are especially
festive, with a torch-lighting ceremony and traditional artisans on hand.
No cover.

Banks
Molokai has several banks, including the
Bank of Hawaii, 208 Ala Malama St.,
Kaunakakai (% 808-553-3273; www.boh.
com) and American Savings Bank, in the
Molokai Center, 40 Ala Malama St., Kauna-
kakai (% 808-553-8391; www.asbhawaii.

both offer ATMs.
Emergencies/Hospitals
Molokai and Lanai are both part of Maui
County. For local emergencies, call % 911.
For nonemergencies, call the police at 
% 808-553-5355 or 808-244-6400; the fire
department at % 808-553-5601; or Molokai
General Hospital in Kaunakakai at % 808-
553-5331. You can also find medical care at
the Molokai Family Health Center, 39 Ala
Malama St., Kaunakakai (% 808-553-5353),
which is open during regular business
hours on weekdays, plus Saturday 
mornings.
Internet Access
Molokai is not exactly on the cutting edge
of cyberspace. The island’s only spot for

Chapter 17
Taking a Side Trip to the
Island of Lanai
In This Chapter
 Introducing Lanai
 Deciding where to stay and dine
 Knowing what to see and do
H
ardly more than a former pineapple patch, the petite island of
Lanai (lah-nigh-ee) now claims to be one of the world’s top tropical
destinations. It’s a bold claim, primarily because there is so little there
there. Don’t expect much, especially when it comes to dining, lodging, or
sightseeing options. In fact, Lanai is so quiet that it makes Molokai look
like a bustling hub of social activity. Lanai has no stoplight and barely 30
miles of paved road; its biggest draw is its simple serenity.
For generations, Lanai held little more than a small farming community,
owned and maintained by the Dole pineapple company for its agricul-
tural workers, surrounded by acres of pineapple fields. Life was virtually
untouched by modern civilization throughout much of the 20th century.
But all that changed in 1990, when the Lodge at Koele, a 102-room hotel
resembling an opulent English Tudor mansion, opened its doors in the
island’s misty Upcountry, followed a year later by the 250-room Manele
Bay Hotel, a Mediterranean-style beach resort overlooking sparkling
Hulopoe Bay.
Overnight, the isolated island was transformed: Corporate jets streamed
into tiny Lanai Airport, former plantation workers were retrained in the
art of dressing pillow-top beds and orchestrating first-class service ex-
periences, and the population swelled to about 3,500 residents. Lanai
won a permanent mark on the luxury map when Microsoft billionaire Bill
Gates and his bride, Melinda, chose the island for their lavish wedding,
buying up every one of its hotel rooms to fend off the media hordes.
In the intervening years, celebrities have opted for more hopping destina-
tions. However, now that the formidable Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts
are in charge of the island’s two luxury resorts, discriminating travelers
are, once again, turning their attention to this otherwise unassuming isle.

The juxtaposition between the big luxury resorts — the island’s sole
economic engine these days — and the rest of the island’s plantation-
style, small-town coziness can be a bit jarring. Residents are overwhelm-
ingly friendly, and fishing and working in the garden are considered
priorities in life. Lanai is not exactly a cultural destination; rather, it’s
worth appreciating for its dramatic beauty, quiet, solitude, and commu-
nal experience with nature. It’s a far cry from the action and develop-
ment found on Maui. Come to Lanai if you crave the chance to escape in
a peaceful tropical setting. The sights can be seen in a day or two; I rec-
ommend a short stay unless you’re looking to indulge in a real do-
nothing vacation.
Getting to Know Lanai
Inhabited Lanai is divided into three parts: Lanai City, Koele, and
Manele. The coastal climate zone is hot and dry, while the Upcountry
region is cool and misty.
Postage stamp–size Lanai City sits at the heart of the island, at 1,645
feet above sea level. It’s the only place on the island with any services.
Built in 1924, this plantation village is a tidy grid of quaint, tin-roofed cot-
tages in bright pastels, with roosters penned in tropical gardens of
banana, lilikoi, and papaya. Many of the residents are Filipino immi-
grants who worked the pineapple fields and imported the art, culture,
language, food, and lifestyle of the Philippines. Their colorful clapboard
homes seem as if they have been stuck in a time warp.
Norfolk and Cook Island pines line Dole Park Square, where plantation
buildings house general stores that sell the basic necessities. Here you’ll
also find a U.S. Post Office, two banks, and a police station with a jail
that consists of three outhouse-size cells with padlocks.
In the nearby, cool, upland district of Koele is the Lodge at Koele, stand-
ing alone on a knoll overlooking pastures and the sea at the edge of a
pine forest, like a grand European manor. The island’s other luxurious
cocoon, the Manele Bay Hotel, is on the sunny southwestern tip of the
island at Manele. You get more of what you expect from Hawaii here,
including a gorgeously tranquil beach, swaying palms, and poolside mai
tais.
If you’re not planning to stay on Lanai, you can visit the island on a day
trip from Maui. See Chapter 12 for complete details on the highly recom-
mended snorkel cruises to Lanai offered by Trilogy Excursions. It’s a
great way to go, with a stop at Lanai’s Hulopoe Beach; for an extra fee,
you can add on guided tours of the island as well. Note that these trips
are very popular, so you’ll need to book your spot well in advance.
Golfers can also ferry over to the private island from Maui for a day of
world-class golf. Expeditions Maui-Lanai (% 800-695-2624 or 808-661-
3756; www.go-lanai.com) offers daily ferry service between Maui’s
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
292

Lahaina and Lanai’s Manele Harbor, plus golf packages for $296 per
golfer, including greens fees and round-trip ferry service; 6:45 and 9:15
a.m. departures are available. See “Hitting the Links,” later in this chap-
ter, for complete descriptions of the island’s two championship chal-
lenges. Sightseers can also take the ferry over for the day for $25 adults,
$20 kids 2 to 11; shuttle service is available to the Dollar Rent-a-Car
counter in Lanai City, where you can rent a Jeep for the day (reserva-
tions required; see “Getting around,” later in this chapter).
Settling Into Lanai
The Lanai Visitors Bureau (% 800-947-4774 or 808-565-7600; www.
visitlanai.net) and the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau
(% 800-GO-HAWAII [800-464-2924] or 808-923-1811; www.gohawaii.
com) provide brochures, maps, and island guides. You can also get infor-
mation on Lanai from the Maui Visitors Bureau (% 800-525-6284 or
808-244-3530; www.visitmaui.com).
Arriving on Lanai
There are no flights to Lanai from the mainland — only from Honolulu or
Kahului, Maui. From either of these airports, it’s a 25-minute trip to Lanai
Airport (LNY). Island Air (% 800-652-6541 or 808-565-6744; www.island
air.com) offers several flights a day. You can also book your flights
through Hawaiian Airlines (% 800-367-5320; www.hawaiianair.com).
In addition, you can book interisland flights with go! Airlines (% 888-
IFLYGO2 [888-435-9462]; www.iflygo.com). From the airport, it’s about
10 minutes by car to Lanai City and 25 minutes to Manele Bay.
If you prefer traveling by boat, round-trip excursions on Expeditions
Lahaina (% 800-695-2624 or 808-661-3756; www.go-lanai.com) take
you between Maui and Lanai for $25 adults, $20 kids 2 to 11 (each way).
The ferry service runs five times a day between Lahaina and Lanai’s
Manele Bay harbor, plus two times a day from Maalaea Harbor, north of
Kihei on Maui’s neck. The ferry leaves Lahaina at 6:45 a.m., 9:15 a.m.,
12:45 p.m., 3:15 p.m., and 5:45 p.m.; the return ferry from Lanai’s Manele
Bay Harbor leaves at 8 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 2 p.m., 4:30 p.m., and 6:45 p.m.
Maalaea ferries depart at 7 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., and leave Manele Bay for
Maalaea at 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. The 9-mile channel crossing takes 45
minutes to an hour, depending on sea conditions. Reservations are
strongly recommended.
Getting around
With so few paved roads on Lanai, you’ll need a four-wheel-drive vehicle
if you plan on exploring the island’s remote shores, its interior, or the
summit of Mount Lanaihale. Even if you have only one day on Lanai, rent
a four-wheel-drive and see the island.
Chapter 17: Taking a Side Trip to the Island of Lanai 293

Four-wheel-drive Jeeps are available at the Dollar Rent-A-Car desk at
Lanai City Service/Lanai Plantation Store, 1036 Lanai Ave. (% 800-
588-7808 or 800-800-3665 for Dollar reservations, or 808-565-7227 for
Lanai City Service; www.dollar.com). Expect to pay up to $139 a day for
a four-wheel-drive Jeep; hardtops and convertibles are both available.
The kind and knowledgeable staff will provide you with a four-wheeling
map and clear guidance as to what sights are accessible while you’re on
the island.
Don’t bother to rent a standard car, because you won’t be able to drive
anywhere but between town and the resorts. The big resorts offer fre-
quent shuttle service. If you stay at the Lodge at Koele or the Manele
Bay Hotel, you need to rent a Jeep only for your sightseeing day. If you
stay elsewhere, just rent a Jeep.
Adventure Lanai Ecocentre (% 808-565-7373; www.adventurelanai.
com) also has four-wheel-drive Jeeps for rent (complete with towels,
masks, fins, snorkel, ice chest, and an island map), usually for $129. You
can also arrange two- or four-hour off-road adventure tours with them.
Whether or not you rent a car — which you should — sooner or later
you’ll find yourself at Lanai City Service/Lanai Plantation Store. This all-
in-one grocery store, gas station, rental-car agency, and souvenir shop
serves as the island’s Grand Central Station. Here’s where you can pick
up information, directions, maps, and all the local gossip.
Finding a Place to Stay
Above Lanai City is the luxurious Lodge at Koele, while down the hill at
Hulopoe Bay is the equally luxurious Manele Bay Hotel. Most accommo-
dations are located “in the village,” as residents call Lanai City.
In the following listings, each hotel’s name is followed by a number of
dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). Each represents the
median rack-rate price range for a double room per night, as follows:
Symbol
Meaning
$
Cheap — less than $150 per night
$$
Still affordable — $150–$224
$$$
Moderate — $225–$324
$$$$
Expensive but not ridiculous — $325–$449
$$$$$
Ultraluxurious — $450 or more per night
Don’t forget that the state adds 11.42 percent in taxes to your hotel bill.

Lanai City
This quaint plantation house is tucked away among papaya, banana, lemon,
and avocado trees in the heart of Lanai City, at 1,620 feet. Hosts Susan and
Michael Hunter have filled their house with Southeast Asian antiques col-
lected on their travels. Both are jewelers; they operate a working studio on
the premises. Each unit has an Italian marble bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub.
Guests are welcome to use the full kitchen and the laundry room. 
The common area looks out on the garden (which is filled with bountiful
Chapter 17: Taking a Side Trip to the Island of Lanai

tropical fruit trees) and is equipped with a TV and VCR. The Hunters are
happy to provide beach toys and help guests arrange for transportation
and excursions; the owners themselves offer diving, snorkeling and kayak-
ing tours.

Hulopoe Beach
Located on a sun-washed southern bluff overlooking Hulopoe Beach, one
of Hawaii’s best stretches of golden sand, this U-shaped hotel steps down
the hillside to the pool and then fans out in oceanfront wings separated
by gardens with lush flora, man-made waterfalls, lotus ponds, and streams.
A tiki torch–lined path leads to the gorgeous, wide-open sands, while, on
the other side, golf greens on a hillside of dry scrub border the hotel. The
place is a real oasis against the dry heat of Lanai’s arid South Coast.
The hotel is undeniably luxurious but, otherwise, nothing special. The
oversize guest rooms are done in the style of an English country house on
the beach: sunny chintz fabrics, mahogany furniture, down duvets,
Audubon prints, huge marble bathrooms with deep soaking tubs, and
semiprivate lanais. Each room features high-speed Internet access, voice
mail, CD and DVD players, a coffeemaker, and a refrigerator; the special
highlights are the fragrant, French-made L’Occitane toiletries.
This resort is much less formal than the Lodge up the hill. It attracts more
families, and shorts and T-shirts are the wardrobe of choice. The small spa
offers a variety of massages, facials, and wraps. There’s also a fitness
center with cardio equipment, free weights, a multistation gym, and yoga
classes. Additional amenities include a children’s program, 24-hour room
service, business services, and twice-daily housekeeping. Several differ-
ent dining rooms promise variety, though the choices are all upscale and
the food is not much more than fine. There’s an open-air sports bar with
a giant-screen TV and a game room, along with a lounge that features live
nightly entertainment.

Lanai City
Guests come here looking for relaxation in the cool mist of the mountains.
Relax on the porch and watch the turkeys mosey across the manicured
lawns; stroll through the Japanese hillside garden; or watch the sun sink
into the Pacific and the stars light up at night. The Lodge, as folks here call

it, stands in a 21-acre grove of Norfolk Island pines at 1,700 feet above sea
level, 8 miles from any beach.
The venerable Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts brand undertook a major
upgrade of this hotel in 2006, which included a complete renovation of all
guest rooms, the creation of a new game room, and the installation of a
Chinese pagoda on the grounds. The result of all this investment is an
amazing Upcountry luxury experience for Lanai visitors and substantially
lower rack rates than you’ll pay just down the hill at the beach.
The resort boasts the look and feel of an elegant country estate. The Great
Hall sports heavy timbers, beamed ceilings, and the two huge stone fire-
places, along with overstuffed furniture, richly patterned rugs, and
museum-quality art. The atmosphere is informal during the day, more
formal after sunset.
You have plenty of activities to choose from at the Lodge and at its sister
resort down the hill, Manele Bay; guests are treated to the best of both
hotels. There’s a complimentary shuttle to the acclaimed golf courses, the
beach, and the Manele Bay Hotel. Guests also enjoy an on-site swimming
pool, plus croquet lawns, horseback riding, Upcountry hiking trails, a
sport shooting and archery range, lawn bowling, and a putting green. In
keeping with the Four Seasons tradition of outstanding service, the staff
will happily help you arrange any kind of adventure outing your heart
desires.

Hotel Lanai
$$
Lanai City
This moderately priced hotel is full of old-fashioned aloha. Built in the
1920s for VIPs, this long, lean, plantation-era, clapboard relic has retained
its quaint character and lives on as a simple, charming country inn tucked
among the Norfolk pines. The hotel reopened in 2007 after a month of 
renovations, which included the debut of the new Lanai City Grille, under
the direction of Maui celebrity chef Bev Gannon. The ten guest rooms are
extremely small, but clean and freshly decorated, with Hawaiian quilts,
wood furniture, and ceiling fans (but no air-conditioning or televisions).
The most popular are the lanai units, which feature a lanai shared with the
room next door. All rooms have ceiling fans and private, shower-only bath-
rooms. The small one-bedroom cottage, with a TV and bathtub, is perfect
for a small family.

Dining on Lanai
Lanai is a curious mix of innocence and sophistication, with strong
cross-cultural elements that liven up its culinary offerings. The tony
hotel restaurants require deep pockets (or bottomless expense
accounts), and you have only a handful of other options.
In the restaurant listings that follow, each restaurant name is followed by
a number of dollar signs, ranging from one ($) to five ($$$$$). The dollar
signs give you an idea of what a complete dinner for one person — with
appetizer, main course, a drink, tax, and tip — is likely to cost. The price
categories go like this:
Symbol
Meaning
$
Cheap eats — less than $20 per person
$$
Still inexpensive — $20–$34
$$$
Moderate — $35–$49
$$$$
Pricey — $50 or more
To give you a further idea of how much you can expect to spend, I’ve
also included the price range of main courses or items in the listings.
(Prices can change at any time, of course, but restaurants usually don’t
raise their prices by more than a dollar or two at any given time.)
Blue Ginger Cafe

Lanai City
FRESH LOCAL
Famous for its mahimahi sandwiches and inexpensive omelets, Blue Ginger
is a local, casual, and inexpensive alternative to Lanai’s fancy hotel restau-
rants. The four tables on the front porch face the cool Norfolk pines of Dole
Park and are always filled with locals who “talk story” from morning to
night. The tiny cafe is often jammed from 6 to 7 a.m. with construction
workers on their way to work. The offerings are solid, no-nonsense, every-
day fare: fried saimin (no MSG, a plus), very popular hamburgers on home-
made buns, and mahimahi with capers in a white-wine sauce. Blue Ginger
also serves a tasty French toast made with homemade bread, vegetable
lumpia (the Filipino version of a spring roll), and Mexican specials. The stir-
fried vegetables — a heaping platter of freshly cut, perfectly cooked veg-
gies, including summer squash and fresh mushrooms — are a hit. Dinner
brings such no-nonsense specialties such as a beautifully prepared pork
chop with shrimp and yummy chicken katsu, a pounded and panko-crusted
breast, pan fried to tender perfection. Resort guests are generous with
kudos for this simple, charming place. No alcoholic beverages are served.

This mom-and-pop joint has been a landmark since the 1920s. In those
days, the tiny storefront (originally called Tanigawa’s) sold canned goods
and cigarettes; the ten tables, hamburgers, and Filipino food came 
later. This hole-in-the-wall built its reputation by serving local-style break-

Hulopoe is more casual than the Manele Bay Hotel’s fine dining room, Ihilani

palanquin in the adjoining lower lobby, the Asian accents, the tropical
murals by gifted Lanai artists, and the vaulted ceilings add up to an eclec-
tic ambience, capped off by marvelous ocean views. The menu ventures
throughout the Pacific Rim for inspiration, showcasing island ingredients
such as Maui asparagus, hearts of palm, and locally caught fresh fish. The
gourmet breakfast options include fresh-baked pastries, tropical fruit, Kona
coffee, and an impressive buffet with omelets made to order. At dinner, the
roast duck with soba noodles and a ginger-plum sauce and the crispy whole
Pacific snapper with a chili-soy dipping sauce are excellent choices, but try
to save room for the chocolate macadamia-nut cheesecake, drizzled with
caramel sauce. Service is excellent, as you might expect.

The most lavish and elegant dining venue at the Four Seasons at Manele
Bay is a stunner, with rich wood paneling, sparking chandeliers, and ocean
views. It’s an ultraromantic setting for contemporary Italian cuisine that’s
complemented by a fine wine list. Local island ingredients often steal the
show in traditional Italian recipes, as with the fresh-caught onaga in a zesty
puttanesca sauce. You’ll find homemade pastas (such as the spinach gnoc-
chi) and hearty, intense dishes such as the slow-braised osso buco and the

HAWAII REGIONAL
The new owners of the Hotel Lanai have done a great job reinventing the
hotel’s main dining room. Their boldest and most impactful stroke was
choosing Hawaii Regional Cuisine champion chef Bev Gannon, of Maui’s
Haliimaile General Store and Joe’s Bar and Grill, to design the menu. Expect
a contemporary American menu with plenty of vibrant Pacific fusion
accents, but not too much fuss. The barbecued ribs and slow-cooked rotis-
serie chicken suit the Upcountry vibe, while local-caught fish is well pre-
pared for those who want a lighter choice. The restaurant is justifiably

popular and always full; even Manele Bay resort guests regularly migrate
up the hill for dinner, escaping the high prices and fanciful resort fare for
heartier, down-home cooking. The décor has a pleasing, almost retro sim-
plicity, with warm wood paneling and cozy fireplaces in both rooms; a 
renovation has lightened the ambience without losing its charm. A friendly
bartender mans a fine full bar; ask for a Lanai Tai for a local twist on the
mai tai. Service is friendly and accommodating to locals and visitors alike.
You can count on live music with dinner on Fridays. All in all, it’s my
favorite place to dine on the island.

Oahu’s popular Ward Warehouse coffeehouse has opened a branch in

tion of pastries. It’s Lanai City’s gathering place, a tiny cafe with tables and
benches on a pleasing wooden deck surrounded by tall pines, and a
stone’s throw from Dole Park. Formerly a plantation house, the structure
fits in with the surrounding plantation homes in the heart of Lanai City.

AMERICAN/STEAK AND SEAFOOD
At the most casual restaurant in the Four Seasons at Manele Bay, you’ll

DELI/PIZZERIA/JUICE BAR
This popular Lanai City eatery, featuring a patio with umbrella tables out-

picnic baskets to go — perfect for a day at the beach. (You can also buy
deli meats, cheeses, and salads by the pound.) At lunch, the first-rate
pizzas, sandwiches, and wraps are popular. Daily soup and menu specials,
excellent pizza, fresh organic produce, fresh juices, and special touches,
such as top-quality black-bean burritos, roasted red peppers, and stuffed
grape leaves, are some of the features that make Pele’s Other Garden a
must. Sandwiches are made with whole-wheat, rye, sourdough, or French
bread, baked on the island and delivered fresh daily; the turkey is free-
range. In the evening, the place becomes a full-fledged bistro-style dining
room where you can also order pastas (butterfly pasta with garlic shrimp,
fettuccine with smoked salmon), a great chicken parmesan, and robust
salads incorporating local-grown greens. Beer, wine, and specialty cock-

AMERICAN
Located next to the Formal Dining Room in the Lodge at Koele, between
the 35-foot-high Great Hall and a wall of glass looking out over manicured
English gardens, the Terrace is far from your typical hotel dining room.
The menu may be fancy for comfort food, but it does, indeed, comfort.
Hearty breakfasts of waffles and cereals, fresh pineapple from the nearby
Palawai Basin, poached eggs and lobster hash with chive hollandaise, and
Kauai Shrimp Benedict (sautéed Kauai shrimp, grilled taro bread, and
wilted spinach with poached eggs and blue crab hollandaise) are a grand
start to the day. Dinner choices are the American classics such as roasted
veal chop on herb mashed potatoes with fava beans and carrots; pepper
roasted rib-eye steak with blue cheese mashed potatoes; and seared
organic chicken breast accompanied by sautéed baby spinach, double-
smoked bacon lardoons, and glazed pearl onions and leeks. I like this
choice better than the more formal main dining room, and the food is
equally fine.

Having Fun on and off the Beach
If you like big, wide, empty, gold-sand beaches and crystal-clear, cobalt-
blue water full of bright tropical fish — and who doesn’t? — then go 
to Lanai. There is something for everyone and plenty to see and 
experience.
Relaxing on Lanai’s best beach
With 18 miles of sandy shoreline, Lanai has some of Hawaii’s least
crowded and most interesting beaches. Lanai’s best, bar none, is
Hulopoe Beach, a perfect playground for spinner dolphins and human
visitors alike. Black-lava fingers, protecting swimmers from the serious
ocean currents that sweep around Lanai, border this big, palm-fringed,
gold-sand beach. In summer, Hulopoe is perfect for swimming, snorkel-
ing, or just lolling about; the water temperature is usually in the mid-70s.
Swimming is usually safe, except when swells kick up in winter. This bay,
located at the foot of the Four Seasons Resort Lanai at Manele Bay, is a
protected marine preserve, and the schools of colorful fish know it. So
do the spinner dolphins who show up almost daily to frolic in the surf,
as well as the humpback whales that cruise by in winter. Hulopoe is also
Lanai’s premier beach park, with a grassy lawn, picnic tables, barbecue
grills, restrooms, showers, and ample parking. Resort guests enjoy cov-
ered beach chairs and towel service.
You can find some of Hawaii’s best lava-rock tide pools along Hulopoe
Bay’s south shore. These miniature underwater worlds are full of strange
creatures, including asteroids (sea stars), holothurians (sea cucumbers),
spaghetti worms, Barber Pole shrimp, and Hawaii’s favorite local deli-
cacy, the opihi, a tasty morsel also known as the limpet. Youngsters
enjoy swimming in the enlarged tide pool at the bay’s eastern edge.
When you explore tide pools, do so at low tide. Never turn your back on
the waves. Wear tennis shoes or reef walkers because wet rocks are slip-
pery. Collecting specimens in this marine preserve is forbidden, so don’t
remove anything from its natural habitat.
Enjoying the water
Lanai has Hawaii’s best water clarity because it lacks major develop-
ment and has low rainfall and runoff. Its coast is also washed clean daily
by the sea current known as “The Way to Tahiti.” But the strong currents
pose a threat to swimmers, and the waters have few good surf breaks.
Most of the aquatic adventures — swimming, snorkeling, and scuba
diving — are centered on the somewhat-protected south shore, around
Hulopoe Bay.
The main outfitter for watersports are Adventure Lanai Ecocentre
(% 808-565-7373; www.adventurelanai.com).
Chapter 17: Taking a Side Trip to the Island of Lanai 303

Body boarding, bodysurfing, and board surfing
When the surf’s up on Lanai, catching the waves is a real treat. Under
the right conditions, Hulopoe and Polihua are both great for catching
waves. Body boards ($10 a day) are available through Adventure Lanai
Ecocentre (% 808-565-7373; www.adventurelanai.com). The beach
shack at Hulopoe Beach provides complimentary boogie boards for
guests of the Four Seasons Resort at Manele Bay and the Lodge at Koele.
Ocean kayaking
The Adventure Lanai Ecocentre (% 808-565-7373; www.adventure
lanai.com) offers half-day sea kayak/snorkel adventures (as well as
kayak/scuba trips) aimed at introducing beginners to the world of ocean
kayaking. The center provides state-of-the-art kayaks (with lightweight
graphite paddles and full back-support seats), life vests, the latest in
snorkel equipment, dry bags, towels, water, and snacks. After receiving
instruction on how to kayak, your group will set off to explore the waters
around Lanai, with stops for snorkeling, snacks, and beachcombing. The
four-hour trip costs $129. Rental kayaks are also available, starting at
$32 a day for a single kayak or $54 a day for a double kayak.
Catchin’ a wave
Everyone, from small kids to grandparents, can learn to surf with the
Lanai Surf School & Surf Safari (% 808-306-9837; www.lanaisurf
safari.com), which offers two-hour, two-person private lessons for
$185 per person, or group lessons for $155 per person. The lesson can
be customized to your experience level. Lessons include guided four-
wheel-drive transport to a great surfing beach. If you’re an experienced
surfer who’d rather set out on your own, you can rent long or short
boards for $58 per day, body boards for $30, or stand-up board and 
paddles for $75. A range of sizes is available to suit different sized 
riders and styles.
Also contact Adventure Lanai Ecocentre (% 808-565-7373; www.
adventurelanai.com). The four-hour Surf Safari is $129, and surfboard
rental is $45 a day. It also offers lessons in surf kayaking, if you’d rather
ride the waves sitting down.
You can find two of Hawaii’s best-known dive spots in Lanai’s clear
waters, just off the south shore: Cathedrals I and II, so named because
the sun lights up an underwater grotto like a magnificent church.
Trilogy Lanai Ocean Sports (% 888-MAUI-800 [888-628-4800]; www.
visitlanai.com) offers several diving trips, some of which take in the
Cathedrals. Call the Maui office for details on current offers.
The Adventure Lanai Ecocentre (% 808-565-7373; www.adventure
lanai.com) is a PADI Adventure Dive Center. Its instructor can teach
you to dive, or if you’re already certified, you can join them on a variety
of outings around Lanai.
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
304

Guests of the Four Seasons resorts can also arrange for group and pri-
vate diving charters through the concierge.
Snorkeling
Hulopoe is Lanai’s best snorkeling spot. Fish are abundant and friendly
in the marine-life conservation area. Try the lava-rock points at either
end of the beach and around the lava pools. The beach shack provides
free snorkel gear to guests of the two Four Seasons resorts. You can also
rent for $10 a day from the Adventure Lanai Ecocentre (% 808-565-
7373; www.adventurelanai.com), which also offers ocean kayaking/
snorkeling trips.
Sportfishing
Spinning Dolphin Charters of Lanai (% 808-565-7676; www.sport
fishinglanai.com), owned and operated by longtime Lanai resident
Captain Jeff Menze, will take you out on the Fish-n-Chips in search of
marlin, ono (wahoo), ahi, spearfish and mahimahi. A four-hour charter
for up to six people costs $700. Individuals can also join a regular
Sunday- or Wednesday-morning charter for $150 (you’ll be with other
travelers, but there’s still a maximum of only six people).
Hitting the links
The Challenge at Manele, next to the Four Seasons Resort Lanai at
Manele Bay at Hulopoe Bay (% 808-565-2222; www.fourseasons.com/
manelebay; greens fees: $225, $210 for guests), is a target-style, desert-
links course designed by Jack Nicklaus. Following a recent facelift, it’s
now one of the most challenging — and rewarding — courses in the
state. Check out the local rules: “No retrieving golf balls from the 150-
foot cliffs on the ocean holes 12, 13, or 17,” and “All whales, axis deer,
and other wild animals are considered immovable obstructions.” If that
doesn’t give you a hint of the uniqueness of this course, maybe the fact
that you must reserve tee times 90 days in advance will confirm it.
Facilities include a clubhouse, a pro shop, rentals, a practice area, 
lockers, and showers.
The Experience at Koele, next to the Lodge at Koele in Lanai City 
(% 808-565-4653; greens fees: $225 for nonguests, $210 for guests) is a
traditional par-72 course designed by Greg Norman with fairway archi-
tecture by Ted Robinson. The course has very different front and back 9
holes. All goes well until you hit the signature hole, no. 8, where you tee
off from a 250-foot elevated tee to a fairway bordered by a lake on the
right and trees and dense shrubs on the left. To level the playing field,
you can choose from four different sets of tees. Facilities include a club-
house, a pro shop, rentals, a practice area, lockers, and showers. Book
tee times a minimum of 90 days in advance.
Chapter 17: Taking a Side Trip to the Island of Lanai 305

Bicycling around Lanai
Mountain bikes are available for rent through the Adventure Lanai
Ecocentre (% 808-565-7373; www.adventurelanai.com). They rent 24-
speed aluminum-frame front-suspension bikes, and rentals come with
helmet and an island bike trail map. Call for current rates.
The Lodge at Koele (% 808-565-7300) also has mountain bikes to rent
for $8 an hour, $35 for four hours, and $40 to $55 for eight hours.
Clay shooting
Experience Lanai’s hunting culture at Lanai Pine Sporting Clays and
Archery (% 808-559-4600). Nestled in a 200-acre pine-wooded valley,
this verdant complex offers a fresh challenge for beginners and experts
alike. First-timers are fitted with a shotgun that minimizes recoil, and
instructors provide clay shooting pointers and safety tips. Fourteen sta-
tions are available, simulating movement patterns of duck, quail, pheas-
ant, and even rabbit. An archery range and an air rifle gallery broaden
your target-practice options, but clay shooting is certainly the highlight.
An introductory lesson is $80, including 25 cartridges and targets, and
runs 45 minutes to an hour; a 50-cartridge package for experienced clay
shooters is $110. A 45-minute introductory archery lesson is $50, while a
45-minute air-rifle session is $50. Advanced lessons are also available.
Seeing the Sights
You need a four-wheel-drive to reach all the sights that I list in this sec-
tion. Renting one can be an expensive proposition on Lanai, so I suggest
that you rent one just for the day (or days) you plan on sightseeing; oth-
erwise, you can easily get to the beach and around Lanai City without
your own wheels. For details, see the section “Getting around” earlier in
this chapter.
For a guided four-wheel-drive tour, contact Adventure Lanai Ecocentre
(% 808-565-7373; www.adventurelanai.com), which offers four-hour
off-road tours for $129 per person.
If you decide to rent a four-wheel-drive, be sure to visit some of the fol-
lowing sights.
Garden of the Gods (Keahi Kawelo)
This is Lanai’s most compelling sightseeing stop. A dirt four-wheel-drive
road leads out of Lanai City and the Lodge at Koele, through the now
uncultivated pineapple fields, past the Kanepuu Preserve (a dry-land
forest preserve teeming with rare plant and animal life), to the so-called
Garden of the Gods, out on Lanai’s North Shore. This place has little to
do with gods, Hawaiian or otherwise. It is, however, the ultimate rock
garden: a rugged, barren, beautiful place full of rocks strewn by volcanic
Part IV: Exploring Maui 
306

forces and shaped by the elements into a variety of shapes and colors —
brilliant reds, oranges, ochers, and yellows. Being out here in this
barren, beautiful, otherworldly place will really bring home the truth
that you’re in the middle of nowhere. Don’t be surprised if you see axis
deer striding across the boulder-strewn landscape. Go early in the morn-
ing or just before sunset, when the light casts eerie shadows on the mys-
terious lava formations. Drive west from the Lodge on Polihua Road; in
about 2 miles, you see a hand-painted sign that points you in the right
direction — left, down a one-lane red-dirt road, through a kiawe forest,
and past sisal and scrub to the site.
Kanepuu Preserve
This fragile ancient forest on the island’s western plateau has 49 species
of plants unique to Hawaii, and it survives under the Nature Conser-
vancy’s protective wing. Botanists say the 590-acre forest is the last dry
lowland forest in Hawaii; the others have all vanished, trashed by axis
deer, agriculture, or “progress.” Among the botanical marvels of this dry
forest are the remains of olopua (native olive), lama (native ebony), mau
hau hele (a native hibiscus), and the rare aiea trees, which were used for
canoe parts. The self-guided tour takes about 10 to 15 minutes to walk;
the trail, open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., is accessible from the Garden of the
Gods. Guided hikes must be arranged in advance. Contact the Nature
Conservancy field office at % 808-572-4508 to reserve.
Shipwreck Beach
The remote, 8-mile-long, windswept Shipwreck Beach, located on Lanai’s
northeastern shore, is named for the rusty ship Liberty stuck on the
coral reef — a sailor’s nightmare and a beachcomber’s dream. The
strong currents yield all sorts of flotsam, from Japanese handblown-
glass fish floats and rare pelagic paper nautilus shells to plenty of junk.
This place is also great for spotting whales from December through
April, when the Pacific humpbacks cruise in from Alaska to winter in the
calm offshore waters. The road to the beach is paved most of the way,
but you really need a four-wheel-drive to get to this deserted beach at
the end of Polihua Road; the road ends at the turnaround about 11⁄2 miles
form the end of the pavement. It’s a short hike from here to see the ship-
wreck from the old cement lighthouse foundation. An easy desert trail
leads south from the foundation to some ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs.
Keomoku Village
Visiting Keomoku Village, on Lanai’s east coast, is really getting away
from it all. All that’s in Keomoku, a ghost town since the mid-1950s, is a
1903 clapboard church in disrepair, an overgrown graveyard, an excel-
lent view across the 9-mile Auau Channel to Maui’s crowded Kaanapali
Beach, and some very empty beaches that are perfect for a picnic or a
snorkel. This former ranching and fishing village of 2,000 was the first
non-Hawaiian settlement on Lanai, but it dried up after droughts killed
off the Maunalei Sugar Company. The village is a great little escape from
Chapter 17: Taking a Side Trip to the Island of Lanai 307

Lanai City. Follow Keomoku Road for 8 miles to the coast, turn right on
the sandy road, and keep going for 53⁄4 miles.
Luahiwa Petroglyph Field
With more than 450 known petroglyphs in Hawaii at 23 sites, Lanai is
second only to the Big Island in its wealth of prehistoric rock art, but
you have to search a little to find it. Some of the best examples are on
the outskirts of Lanai City, on a hillside site known as Luahiwa Petro-
glyph Field. The characters you see incised on 13 boulders in this grassy
3-acre knoll include a running man, a deer, a turtle, a bird, a goat, and
even a rare, curly-tailed Polynesian dog. To get there, take the road to
Hulopoe Beach. About 2 miles out of Lanai City, look to the left, up on
the slopes of the crater, for a cluster of reddish-tan boulders (believed to
form a rain heiau, or shrine, where people called up the gods Ku and
Hina to nourish their crops). A cluster of spiky century plants marks the
spot. Look for the Norfolk pines on the left side of the highway, turn left
on the dirt road that veers across the abandoned pineapple fields, and,
after about a mile, take a sharp left by the water tanks. Drive for another
half-mile and then veer to the right at the V in the road. Stay on this
upper road for about a third of a mile until you come to a large cluster of
boulders on the right side. Take a short walk up the cliffs (wear walking
or hiking shoes) to the petroglyphs. Exit the same way you came. Go
between 3 p.m. and sunset for ideal viewing and photo ops.
The Munro Trail
In the first golden rays of dawn, when lone owls swoop over abandoned
pineapple fields, hop into a four-wheel-drive and head out on the two-
lane blacktop toward Mount Lanaihale, the 3,370-foot summit of Lanai.
Your destination is the Munro Trail, the narrow, winding ridge trail that
runs across Lanai’s razorback spine to the summit. From there, you may
get a rare Hawaii treat: On a clear day, you can see all the main islands in
the Hawaiian chain except Kauai. Note: The Munro Trail was inaccessi-
ble at press time, so you should call the visitors bureau before you set
your heart on this trip.
Shopping the Local Stores
There’s not much shopping on such a tiny island, but there are a handful
of treasures you won’t want to miss.
Central Bakery, 1311 Fraser Ave., Lanai City (% 808-565-3920), is the
mother lode of the island’s baked delights. Although Central Bakery isn’t
your standard retail outlet, you can call in advance, place your order,
and pick it up. The staff prefers as much notice as possible, and it’s
worth it. The guava chiffon and chocolate chantilly cakes are in great
demand, and the breads are legendary. The bakery also sells a delec-
table assortment of cookies, brownies, muffins, and breakfast pastries.
Part IV: Exploring Maui

Gifts with Aloha, Dole Park, 363 Seventh St., at Ilima Street (% 808-565-
6589; www.giftswithaloha.com), sells fabulously stylish hats and hat-
bands, T-shirts, swimwear, quilts, dresses, children’s books and toys,
Hawaii-themed books, pareus (long, wrap-around skirts usually made
from a colorful or decorative fabric), candles, aloha shirts, and much
more. The fragrant soaps and bath products made on Maui make won-
derful gifts to bring home. If you fall in love with a minigarden, fountains,
or lamp, you can have it shipped back to the mainland.
The Local Gentry, 363 Seventh St., behind Gifts with Aloha, facing Ilima
Street (% 808-565-9130), is a wonderful boutique with clothing and
accessories that rise above the standard resort-shop fare. Everything
has a relaxed island flair. Expect brands such as Tommy Bahama,
Putumayo, and other casually sophisticated brands.
Also overlooking Dole Park, in the heart of Lanai City, is Dis ’n Dat, 418
Eighth St. (% 808-565-9170; www.suzieo.com), housed in a charming
1928 plantation cottage and specializing in its own fun and affordable
island-themed jewelry, which has been featured in Us Weekly, People,
InStyle, and Teen Vogue magazines.
The Mike Carroll Gallery, 443 Seventh St. (% 808-565-7122; www.mike
carrollgallery.com), a working gallery and studio featuring the origi-
nal island art of mainland transplant Carroll, who captures the spirit and
beauty of Lanai and Maui in his gorgeous oils. The best shopping stop
on the island, bar none.
Stop by the International Food & Clothing Center, 833 Ilima Ave. 
(% 808-565-6433), for groceries, housewares, T-shirts, fishing supplies,
over-the-counter drugs, wine and liquor, paper goods, and hardware.
There’s even a takeout lunch counter.
A local landmark for two generations, Pine Isle Market, 356 Eighth St.
(% 808-565-6488 or 808-565-6775), specializes in locally caught fresh
fish, but you can also find fresh herbs and spices, canned goods, ice
cream, toys, zoris, and other basic essentials of work and play. The fish-
ing section is outstanding, with every lure imaginable.
Lanai Plantation Store (% 808-565-7227) tends to be the center of news
and activity on the island, and a great stop for necessities and affordable
souvenirs. The Dollar Rent A Car counter is attached, so this is a good
place to pick up water and snacks for a day exploring the island in your
four-wheel-drive. The Plantation Store is also the island’s gas station.
At the Lanai Marketplace on Dole Square, farmers sell their dewy-fresh
produce, home-baked breads, plate lunches, and handicrafts from 7 to
11 a.m. or noon on Saturday.

Enjoying Lanai after Dark
Except for special programs, such as the annual Pineapple Festival
in May, when some of Hawaii’s best musicians arrive to show their sup-
port for Lanai, the only regular nightlife venues are the Lanai Theater
(% 808-565-7500), which screens first-run movies in a charming setting
at the corner of Seventh and Lanai avenues in Lanai City, and the two
resorts, the Four Seasons Lodge at Koele and Four Seasons Resort Lanai

enjoy a convivial evening cocktail. And don’t forget the friendly bar at
the Lanai City Grille, open Wednesday through Sunday.

Ten Steps to Incredible
Island Dining
In This Chapter
 Knowing what you’re eating
 Maximizing your dining experiences
E
ating well on Maui isn’t a problem. Hawaii has lured some of the
world’s finest chefs to its kitchens and managed to cultivate some
stars of its own in the process — and the largest and finest bunch of
them has chosen the Valley Isle as muse. Anyone who loves quality
seafood, fresh-grown veggies, sweet tropical fruits, and even artisan-
crafted cheeses will think he’s died and gone to heaven, because Maui is
the bounteous breadbasket of the Hawaiian Islands.
But that’s far from the end of the bounty. Maui’s melting-pot society sets
a global table. Although Asian flavors and cooking styles are most preva-
lent, island menus travel the globe, from old-world European culinary
classics to good ol’ (local) ranch-raised, fire-grilled steaks. Hawaii’s cooks
have even managed to put their own spin on some of the world’s most
revered foods — pizzas, burgers, and burritos — with rousing success.
However, you may want to know a few facts about island dining before
you sit down to a meal — the first being that Hawaii has two brands of
homegrown cuisine. Local food is the traditional everyday eats of the
locals, while Hawaii Regional (or Hawaii Island) Cuisine is the gourmet
version. But both are hybrid cuisines, informed by European and Asian
influences. This chapter tells you more about island cuisine and what
else to expect on the culinary front.
Savoring Maui’s Freshest Foods
If you love seafood, you’ve come to the right place. In fact, Hawaii’s
seafood may be the best in the world — some of the world’s finest chefs
think so — and the selection is generally much more diverse than what
you find in your average mainland supermarket. And Maui’s chefs defi-
nitely know how to select, prepare, and serve the fruits of the sea. (For

details on the variations you may find on island menus, see the section
“Working Your Way around the Menu: A Translation List for Seafood
Lovers,” later in this chapter.)
But Maui’s bounty isn’t limited to the sea. A wealth of fresh-grown 
vegetables — including leafy lettuces, vine-ripened tomatoes, and sweet
Maui onions — thrives in the lava-rich soil.
Maui’s verdant Upcountry plays host to Surfing Goat Dairy, which crafts
some of the finest goat cheeses in all the land. The hard and soft chèvres
come in a range of creatively ripened and herbed varieties. If you spot
one of these extraordinary chèvres on a local menu, don’t pass it up.
The charming goat farm has even developed into a tourist attraction in
its own right, so you can also go right to the source (see Chapter 13).
Maui has also raised its profile in the herbs market. Upcountry’s Alii
Kula Lavender Farm has learned that Maui has just about perfect grow-
ing conditions for fragrant lavender. Alii Kula has also had the business
sense to partner with some of Hawaii’s premier food purveyors in order
to generate some uniquely flavorful food products, such as aromatic
lavender tea and flavorful lavender scones, which can be found at mar-
kets, on restaurant menus, and at the farm’s own store (see Chapter 13).
And fruits are Maui’s real forte. All you need to do is head to the local
supermarket to discover a whole new world of citrus, more varieties of
banana than you ever knew existed, and other colorful tropical treats.
(See the section “Shopping at a Maui Supermarket,” later in this chapter,
for more details.)
Tropical fruit comes as no surprise, of course — but who knew that
Hawaii offered so much island-raised meat? The Big Island is home to
the largest privately owned cattle ranch in the United States: Parker
Ranch, covering 225,000 acres, including more than 50,000 cattle, and
serving as the heart of Hawaii’s paniolo (cowboy) country. Ranch-raised
beef and lamb appear on fine-dining menus all over the state. In fact,
although Maui doesn’t boast nearly the bounty of island-raised meat
that the Big Island does, you may get lucky enough to find a Maui-raised
steak on a menu or two when you’re on the island.
Tasting Traditional Island Eats
Local food is a casual, catch-all affair. As evidenced by the list of food
terms that appears later in this chapter (see the section “Mastering
More Everyday Hawaiian Food Terms”), outsider influences on the local
cuisine arrived in Hawaii from all over the map, from Portugal to Japan
and just about everywhere in between.
Lomilomi salmon is the perfect example of local food as a hybrid 
cuisine. Islanders didn’t have natural access to the cold-water fish, 
but they accepted it in trade from globetrotting explorers and traders.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
314

Discovering how to prepare it seviche-style for short-term preservation,
they quickly became accustomed to accepting it in trade and incorpo-
rated it into their diet as a staple.
Local food is generally starch heavy and high in calories, so don’t 
expect it to have a positive impact on your waistline. Local food is most
commonly served as a plate lunch, which usually consists of a main
dish (anything from fried fish to teriyaki beef), “two scoops rice,” an 
ice-cream-scoop serving of macaroni salad, and brown gravy, all served
on a paper plate. Plate lunches are cheap and available at casual restau-
rants and beachside stands. An excellent place to indulge in this local
tradition is Maui’s Aloha Mixed Plate, located in a wonderful waterfront
spot in Lahaina; if you’re based elsewhere on the island, check out 
local favorite Da’ Kitchen, with locations in Kahului and Kihei. Gazebo
Restaurant, in Napili on Maui’s west shore, is a great place to try break-
fast with local flavor, such as Portuguese sausages. (See Chapter 11 for
details on all three restaurants.)
Another great place to try local food is at a luau, a traditional feast that’s
not a tourist trap but a genuine part of island culture, thrown to celebrate
everything from a baby’s birth to a college graduation. (For more on
luaus, see “Knowing What to Expect at a Luau,” later in this chapter.)
Finding Maui’s Gourmet Side
About a dozen or so years ago, Hawaii’s kitchens underwent a culinary
revolution: the birth of Hawaii Regional Cuisine (HRC). Island chefs were
tired of preparing stodgy continental fare that was unsuited to Hawaii
living, so they created a new standard of gourmet cuisine using fresh
local ingredients in creative combinations and preparations.
Hawaii Regional Cuisine is often disguised under other names — 
Euro-Asian, Pacific Rim, Indo-Pacific, Pacific Edge, Euro-Pacific, Island
Fusion, and so on — but it all falls under the jurisdiction of Hawaii
Regional Cuisine. Although it has variations, you can expect the follow-
ing keynotes: plenty of fresh island fish, Asian flavorings (ginger, soy,
wasabi, seaweed, and so on) and cooking styles galore (searing, grilling,
panko crust, and wok preparations), and fresh tropical fruit sauces
(mango, papaya, and the like).
Hawaii Regional Cuisine has really matured in recent years, with the
finest HRC chefs putting clever multicultural spins on the established
canon, based on their training and heritage. You may already know of
Roy Yamaguchi, who has installed outposts of his Roy’s Restaurant
chain not only on each island but also around the world, from New York
to Guam. Maui stars include Beverly Gannon, of Haliimaile General
Store and Joe’s Bar & Grill. Even though David Paul is no longer at 
the helm, Lahaina Grill remains a faultless outpost of Hawaii Regional
Cuisine.
Chapter 18: Ten Steps to Incredible Island Dining 315

In 1999, the next generation of island chefs banded together under the
label Hawaiian Island Chefs, taking their craft to the next level — and
they’ve succeeded in spades. Instead of emphasizing broad-based fusion
in island cuisine, these upstarts generally start from an ethnic or the-
matic base, incorporating Hawaii ingredients and adding their own indi-
vidual stamp. The stellar James McDonald works his magic at chic sister
seafood restaurants I’o and Pacific’o, while D.K. Kodama, who reinvented
sushi for adoring gourmands at Maui’s Sansei Seafood Restaurant and
Sushi Bar, has continued to expand his empire. Although eating at some
of these restaurants may be a splurge, I encourage you to treat yourself
to a gourmet island meal at least once during your trip. (See Chapter 11
for reviews of these establishments and more of Maui’s top choices.)
Working Your Way around the Menu: 
A Translation List for Seafood Lovers
Even savvy seafood eaters can become confused when confronted with
a Hawaiian menu. Although the mainland terms are sometimes included,
many menus only use the Hawaiian names to tout their daily catches.
Furthermore, some types of seafood that make regular appearances in
Hawaii’s kitchens simply don’t show up on mainland menus.
You’re likely to encounter many of the following types of seafood while
you’re in Maui:
 Ahi: This dense, ruby-red bigeye or yellowfin tuna is a Hawaiian
favorite — and it may be one of yours, too, as popular as it has
become on the mainland. Ahi is regularly served raw, as sushi and
sashimi, or panko-crusted and seared in Hawaii Regional Cuisine.
Yellowfin is the beefier of the two.
 Aku: This meaty, robust skipjack tuna is also known as bonito
(which may be familiar to sushi fans). Aku is best as raw sushi,
because it can get too dry if not expertly cooked.
 Au (ow): This firm-fleshed marlin or broadbill swordfish sometimes
stands in for ahi in local dishes. Pacific blue marlin is sometimes
called kajiki, while striped marlin often shows up as nairagi.
 Hebi (heh-bee): This mildly flavored, almost lemony, spearfish is
sometimes the day’s catch in upscale restaurants.
 Mahimahi: Like ahi, this white, sweet, moderately dense fish is
likely to also be familiar to you; it’s Hawaii’s most popular fish and
shows up regularly on mainland menus.
 Monchong (mon-chong): This exotic fish boasts a flaky, tender tex-
ture and a simple flavor. It’s best served broiled, sautéed, or steamed.
 Onaga (o-na-ga): This mild, moist, and tender ruby-red snapper is
served in many fine restaurants; sample it if it’s available.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
316

 Ono (oh-no): Ono means “good to eat” in Hawaiian, and this 
mackerel-like fish sure is. Also called wahoo, it’s similar to snapper,
but firmer and drier. You should have multiple opportunities to try
this popular, distinctly flavored fish; it’s often served grilled and in
sandwiches.
 Opah (oh-pa): This rich, almost creamy moonfish is good served
just about any way, from sashimi to baked.
 Opakapaka (oh-pa-ka-pa-ka): Either pink or crimson snapper, this
light, flaky, elegant fish is very popular on fine-dining menus.
 Shutome (shuh-toe-me): This fish is what mainlanders call swordfish.
It’s a sweet and tender steaklike fish that is great grilled or broiled.
 Tombo: Tombo is albacore tuna, but this firm, flavorful whitefish
surpasses the canned stuff by miles when prepared appropriately.
 Uku (oo-koo): This gray — pale pink, really — snapper is flaky,
moist, and delicate.
 Ulua (oo-loo-ah): Ulua is large jack trevally, a firm-fleshed, flavorful
fish also known as pompano.
Demand for fish has driven down the populations of certain fish species,
such as Chilean sea bass and Hawaiian grouper (hapuupuu), to danger-
ously low levels. If you’d like to know which fish are relatively abundant
and which ones are overfished before you make your menu choices, you
may want to pack a copy of the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch 
Pocket Guide. The printable guide — available at http://montereybay
aquarium.com/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_regional.aspx?region_
id=3 — makes it easy to make the environmentally correct choice at a
glance. The color-coded card indicates which menu-common species are
abundant and relatively well managed, which are not currently in danger
but are under watch, and which are in danger of severe depletion.
Many of Maui’s restaurants serve top-notch seafood from local waters,
and I recommend a whole slew of them in Chapter 11. My absolute
favorite place to enjoy the fruit of the island’s waters is the splurge-
worthy Mama’s Fish House in Paia.
Mastering More Everyday 
Hawaiian Food Terms
All the following foods are common in plate lunches and at luaus. A
number of them also pop up on gourmet menus — usually with expen-
sive ingredients and prepared with a twist, of course:
 Bento: A Japanese box lunch.
 Haupia (how-pee-ah): Creamy coconut pudding, usually served in
squares. A favorite luau dessert.
Chapter 18: Ten Steps to Incredible Island Dining 317

 Kalua pork: Pork slow-cooked in an imu (underground oven); listed
on menus as luau pig on occasion. Sometimes it’s served in a pulled
kalua pork sandwich, much like barbecue pork in the Southeast or
Texas.
 Kiawe (kee-ah-vay): An aromatic mesquite wood often used to fire
the wood-burning ovens.
 Laulau: Pork, chicken, or fish wrapped in ti leaves and steamed.
 Lilikoi (lil-ee-koy): Passion fruit.
 Lomilomi (low-mee-low-mee) salmon: Salted salmon marinated,
seviche-like, with tomatoes and green onions.
 Lumpia (lum-pee-ah): The Portuguese version of a spring roll, but
spicier, doughier, and deep-fried (and usually stuffed with pork and
veggies).
 Malassada (mah-lah-sah-da): The Portuguese version of a dough-
nut, usually round, deep-fried, and generously sprinkled with pow-
dered sugar.
 Manapua (man-ah-poo-ah): A bready, doughy bun with sweetened
pork or sweet beans inside, like Chinese bao.
 Ohelo (oh-hay-low): A berry very similar to a cranberry that com-
monly appears in Hawaii Regional Cuisine sauces.
 Panko: Japanese bread crumbs, most commonly used to prepare
katsu (deep-fried pork or chicken cutlet). Creative chefs often use it
for other purposes, most commonly as a tempura-like crust on
sushi-grade ahi rolls.
 Poi: The root of the taro pounded into a purple, starchy paste; a
staple of the island diet, but generally tasteless to most outsiders.
 Poke (po-kay): Cubed raw fish — usually ahi or marlin — seasoned
with onions, soy, and seaweed.
 Ponzu: A soy-and-citrus dipping sauce popular with Hawaii
Regional Cuisine chefs.
 Pupus: Appetizers or hors d’oeuvres.
 Saimin (sai-min): A brothy soup with ramenlike noodles, topped
with bits of fish, chicken, pork, and/or vegetables. Saimin is served
almost everywhere in Hawaii, from plate-lunch stands to museum
cafes to McDonald’s.
 Shave ice: The island version of a snow cone, best enjoyed with ice
cream and sweet azuki (red) beans at the bottom.
 Taro: A green leafy vegetable grown in Hawaii; the root is used to
make poi (see earlier in this list), while the leafy part of the veg-
etable is often steamed like spinach.

Enjoying Other Local Favorites
Lest all this unfamiliar food talk makes you think otherwise, remember
that the majority of Hawaii islanders are red-blooded, flag-waving
Americans, and they love a good burger just as much as your average
mainlander.
My favorite burgers on Maui are served at Cheeseburger in Paradise/
Cheeseburger Island Style, while the island’s best pizza is served at
Paia’s colorful and creative Flatbread Company. (See Chapter 11 for all
the juicy details.)
Hawaii has also co-opted Mexican cuisine and made the burrito its 
own, most successfully at Lahaina’s Cilantro Fresh Mexican Grill and
Mañana Garage, in Kahului, where island-grown ingredients and fresh-
caught fish provide top-quality, surf-style filling. (Again, see Chapter 11
for details.)
Discovering Maui’s Ethnic Eats
Thanks to its proximity to the Eastern Hemisphere and its large, multi-
faceted Asian population, the Hawaiian Islands boast a wealth of fabu-
lous Asian restaurants — Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Indonesian,
and so on. With the exception of Japanese, most Asian restaurants tend
to be very affordable. Furthermore, because island palates are more
accustomed to dining Asian style, you find that dishes aren’t Americanized
for a mainland population; flavors are bold and strong, ingredients fresh
and crisp. While dining out on Maui, you may just find yourself enjoying
the finest ethnic food you’ve ever eaten.
Maui’s ethnic standout is A Saigon Cafe (see Chapter 11), whose
piquant flavors and friendly service make it well worth seeking out in 
off-the-tourist-track Wailuku. I never miss it when I’m on the island. 
Also consider WokStar, in Kihei, for a fresh take on noodle dishes from
Indonesia and around the world; and Café des Amis, in Paia, for savory
Indian curries as well as well-prepared Mediterranean fare.
Shopping at a Maui Supermarket
Whenever I’m in a foreign country, I always take the time to visit the local
supermarket. And even though Hawaii is part of the United States, its gro-
cery stores are a world apart — a trip to the market is an entertaining
culinary adventure. If you’re staying in a condo or a vacation rental,
you’ll want to stock the pantry, but even if you’re not, I highly recom-
mend an excursion to your local Safeway, KTA, Star Market, or Foodland.
Hawaii supermarkets offer a number of treats that you don’t find at your
average mainland supermarket. Poi (taro root mixed with water and
Chapter 18: Ten Steps to Incredible Island Dining 319

pounded into a paste — similar to polenta in consistency), for example,
comes in instant, premade, and make-your-own forms; I defy you to find
poi in any form in your hometown supermarket.
The bounty in the seafood case is much more diverse than what you see
at your local Safeway back home. Hawaii refrigerator cases regularly
contain such taste treats as sushi-grade tuna, fresh Pacific octopus, and
whole squid (insert “yum!” or “yuck!” here, depending on your taste
buds). If you have access to a barbecue at your hotel or condo complex,
grilling up a fresh fish filet is a simple but magnificent dinner.
Just about any Hawaii supermarket has multiple aisles devoted to Asian
foods, from noodles to bizarre candies. The juice refrigerator case is
also a treat, so don’t be afraid to try something new. My husband never
misses an opportunity to chug POG (passion fruit–orange–guava juice)
when he’s in the islands.
Java lovers, rejoice. Maui’s local brew is available in just about any aver-
age market. All Hawaii-grown coffees are delicious, but the world-famous
Kona coffee, grown on the Big Island, is the top of the heap (and it makes
a great, affordable gift to bring home to your favorite caffeine addict).
You can find the greatest bounty among the fresh fruits, where you
uncover such tropical treats as mangoes, guava, star fruit, litchi, lilikoi
(passion fruit), and much more. Whenever I go to Hawaii, I eat as much
papaya as I can. (Mainland imports just don’t equal the island-grown
fruits.) Cut your papaya in half, dig out the seeds, and serve with a
squirt of lime — island breakfast doesn’t get any better than this.
Pineapples are another Hawaii taste treat; the small white pineapples are
sweetest, and you usually find them clearly labeled at the market. The
Big Island’s lava-rich soil produces extra-flavorful citrus fruits; Kau
oranges, for example, are legendary for their sweetness. Even water-
melon is an extra-special treat; Molokai-grown watermelons are the best
in the world — full of seeds, but fabulous.
Among Hawaii-grown vegetables, Maui onions are the ultimate treat.
They’re very sweet, like Vidalias, but with a distinctive flavor all their
own. Slice ’em thick and throw ’em right on the barbecue. Dense, purple,
Molokai-grown sweet potatoes are another of my favorites.
Don’t shy away from tropical fruits or other foods just because you’re
unfamiliar with them. Islanders are friendly and talkative folks.
Supermarket attendants — or even your fellow shoppers — can advise
you on how to cut or clean island fruits. Just ask, and you’re likely to
find yourself on the receiving end of some friendly conversation.
Hawaii shopping does have a downside — namely, high prices. Although
you can save quite a few bucks by stocking up and cooking for yourself
back at the condo instead of eating in restaurants for three meals a day,
you still have to be prepared to pay more for staples than you would
Part V: The Part of Tens 
320

back home. The general rule is: Expect anything that has to wing its way
across the Pacific to cost more than you usually pay.
Unfortunately, Maui’s supermarket prices are high all across the board.
Fish is about the same price as on the mainland, and the quality is gener-
ally better, but pick up some ground beef for burgers and expect to pay
$3 a pound. Your average breakfast cereal goes for $5 or $7 a box. At first
glance, you may think the prices of milk and bread are a joke: Expect to
pay about $6 a gallon for milk, and around $4.50 or $5 for a loaf of bread.
Sipping a Tropical Cocktail
California entrepreneur Vic Bergeron — more popularly known as Trader
Vic — may have been responsible for the birth of the mai tai, but it’s
practically the official state cocktail in Hawaii. The classic mai tai is a
magical sweet-tart concoction of Jamaican rum, fresh lime juice, and
chunky ice, generally served in a tumbler and topped with a fresh sprig
of mint.
A mai tai is a simple blend, and any bar worth its salt in Hawaii can 
mix you a well-balanced drink. But score an out-of-sorts bartender on
the wrong night, and you end up with either a sickly sweet syrup that
couldn’t do justice to a stack of flapjacks, or a thick, face-distorting
blend strong enough to power up an SUV.
For the perfect blend of ideal mai tai–making and only-in-Maui ambience,
the bar at any of the big resorts can satisfy your sunset cravings. In
Lahaina, Cheeseburger in Paradise is the place to go for the top con-
coction (see Chapter 11).
Of course, mai tais may not be your drink of choice. If that’s the case,
don’t worry, you can find plenty of other ways to toast your time in para-
dise. Personally, I’m a big fan of the piña colada — not a Hawaii cocktail,
sure, but it never fails to put me in the tropical mood, especially when a
colorful paper umbrella and a generous slice of pineapple are included.
Again, Cheeseburger in Paradise makes the island’s best, but you can’t
go wrong at most of the island’s finer restaurants, either.
Microbrews are serious business on the islands. The finest wear the
Kona Brewing Company label.
Knowing What to Expect at a Luau
A luau is the ideal place to experience island traditions — but only to a
degree, of course. Any commercial luau (read: any luau you’re likely to
attend) will be tainted by its commercialism. But a few luaus do a great
job of bringing genuine island culture into the mix.
Chapter 18: Ten Steps to Incredible Island Dining 321

The best luaus — offering the best mix of good food, amenities, setting,
and authentic culture — are on Maui. The Old Lahaina Luau and the
Feast at Lele are the best luaus Hawaii has to offer, hands down; Old
Lahaina Luau now offers a morning fete complete with a local-style
breakfast feast and entertainment two days a week, called Ho’omana’o.
Be sure to reserve right away (see Chapter 11).
What should you plan for when attending a luau? Luckily, most luau
feasts are self-sufficient, idiot-proof ventures, so after you make your
reservations, all you need to bring is your appetite and aloha spirit.
Dress for the festivities in bright, bold colors, even if you don’t own any
aloha wear — bright colors really suit the mood. Other than that, just
wear what’s comfortable for you, and bring a sweater if the weather is
expected to cool down after dark. (All luaus take place outdoors, most in
breezy oceanfront settings.)
When you make your reservations, you’re usually told when the gates
open and when you should plan to arrive. Come in plenty of time to
wander the grounds because the best luaus feature authentic craft
making, games, and the like in the hour before the festivities formally
begin. The luau pig, which has been baking all day in its imu (under-
ground oven), is also unearthed early in the program, and unless you’re
squeamish, you don’t want to miss it.
Upon arrival, the Hawaiians typically greet you with a lei, made of either
fresh flowers or shells, and a cocktail, often a mai tai (or fruit juice, if
you’re too young or a teetotaler). They lead you to your assigned seat,
usually at a communal table with chairs (although the Old Lahaina Luau
now features some traditional seating, on cushions facing low-slung
tables).
Cocktails are usually included in the pay-one-price admission fee to a luau.
Open bars are common, but some luaus limit you to a certain number or
kind of drink. If it matters to you, be sure to ask when booking.
After the luau pig is unearthed from the imu, you’ll be asked to take a
seat and then invited to fill your plate from the buffet luau spread; the
best luaus clearly mark the dishes so that you know what you’re sam-
pling. In addition to the kalua pork (shredded from the bone after the
luau pig is unearthed), you can expect traditional dishes, such as poi,
the tasteless purple paste that’s the staple starch of Hawaii. Poi is worth
trying for its iconic status, but you’re unlikely to become a fan. People
usually don’t eat poi alone, but with other starches; ask an attendant
what’s best in the night’s feast for poi dipping. You’re likely to prefer
such dishes as lomilomi salmon, poke, and haupia (see “Mastering More
Everyday Hawaiian Food Terms,” earlier in this chapter). If you’re a less-
than-adventurous diner, don’t worry — you can find plenty of familiar
dishes on hand, including chicken teriyaki, long rice, and salad. You can
refill your plate as often as you like. After dinner, the evening’s entertain-
ment begins, usually a hula show that lasts an hour or so before the
evening winds down.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
322

Most luau food is satisfactory at best, so don’t expect a gourmet feast
(the exception being the Feast at Lele, which eschews the standard set-
ting for intimate seating, food prepared by one of Hawaii’s best chefs,
and full table service). Top-notch luaus like the Old Lahaina Luau serve
well-prepared fare, but remember that they’re still cooking in bulk for
hundreds. Come for the party and plan to have a first-rate dinner at a
standard restaurant on another night.
The kind of luau that’s right for you is your call; some luaus are more
suited to couples, for example, while others are great for families with
kids. Some luaus feature wholly authentic Hawaiian entertainment (pri-
marily chanting and dancing), while others blow the wad on glitzy Vegas-
style extravaganzas with glittering costumes. (Note: Any luau that calls
itself authentically Hawaiian shouldn’t have fire-knife dancers, which is a
Samoan tradition.)
Luaus are pricey — usually $50 to $105 a head, depending on the fete —
so choose carefully. Before you commit, see Chapter 11 and ask your
reservations agent to make sure that you end up at the party that’s right
for you.

H
awaii may be the 50th state, but it’s an ocean — and a world —
apart from its 48 mainland brethren. In fact, because it didn’t join
the star-spangled party until 1959, Hawaii came into the Union as an
adopted adult, complete with its own unique personality, fully formed
(indeed, ancient) culture, and distinct worldview.
Maui sits closer to Tokyo than it does to Washington, D.C. — or even
Chicago. The islands don’t always share the Eurocentric perspective
that many Americans have of the world.
Even the population is dramatically different. Unlike the rest of the
United States, no one ethnic group forms a majority in Hawaii. Although
Caucasian and Japanese are the two largest ethnic groups (each
accounts for roughly 22 percent of the population), nearly 35 percent of
islanders consider themselves of mixed ethnicity. Hawaii’s residents, as
a group, don’t consider race a factor in marriage; they’re just as likely to
marry someone from a different race as not.

instead of advertising your status as a malihini (ma-li-hee-nee; new-
comer), read on.

Mastering the Three Most Important 
Phrases in the Hawaiian Language
Everyone in Hawaii speaks English, of course, but a few Hawaiian words
and phrases have made their way into the common vernacular, and regu-
larly pop up in everyday conversation.
You probably already know the Hawaiian word aloha (a-lo-ha), which
serves as an all-purpose greeting — hello and welcome, goodbye as well.
Aloha is a warm and wonderful word full of grace, compassion, and good
feeling, so use it liberally. I can’t think of a better way to get caught up in
Hawaii’s true spirit.
Islanders don’t like “goodbye” to be so permanent. So to really sound
like a local, part from others warmly with a hui hou (ah hoo-ee ho),
which means “until we meet again.”
Another word that every visitor needs to know is mahalo (ma-ha-low),
which means “thank you” and is used extensively throughout Hawaii. If
you want to say “Thanks very much!” or “Thank you so much,” say
mahalo nui loa (ma-ha-low noo-ee low-ah). You’ll impress the locals with
your efforts, and you’ll flatter them with your graciousness, too.
Discovering More Hawaiian Words
Take a few minutes to study the following list. That way, when you’re in a
restaurant and the waiter offers your little ones a keiki menu, describes
today’s lunch special as particularly ono, or asks you if you’re pau when
he comes to clear your plate, you’ll feel like a regular kamaaina:
 Alii (ah-lee-ee): Hawaiian royalty
 Halau (ha-lau): School
 Hale (ha-lay): House
 Haole (how-lee): Foreigner or Caucasian (literally “out of breath” —
pale, or paleface); a common reference, not an insult (usually)
 Heiau (heh-ee-ow): Hawaiian temple
 Hui (hoo-ee): A club, collective, or assembly (for example, an
artists’ collective is an artists’ hui)
 Hula (hoo-lah): Native dance
 Imu (ee-moo): Underground oven lined with hot rocks that’s used
for cooking the luau pig
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Lose the Tourist Trappings 325

 Kahuna (ka-hoo-nah): Priest or expert
 Kamaaina (ka-ma-eye-nah): Local person
 Kane (ka-nay): Man (you may see this word on a restroom door)
 Kapu (ka-poo): Anything that’s taboo, forbidden
 Keiki (keh-kee): Child
 Kupuna (koo-poo-nah): An elder, leader, grandparent, or anyone

Pronouncing Those Pesky Hawaiian 
Words and Place Names
Because the Hawaiian language has only 12 characters to work with —
the five vowels (a, e, i, o, and u), plus seven consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p,
and w) — Hawaiian words and names tend to be long and difficult, with
plenty of repetitive syllables that can really twist your tongue. Master just
a few basic rules, however, and Honoapiilani Highway and Haliimaile will
be rolling off your tongue like Main Street and Anytown, USA, in no time.
Half the letters in the Hawaiian language — h, k, l, m, n, and p — sound
just as they do in English. The one consonant that sounds different in
Hawaiian is w. W usually carries the v sound when it follows i or e; for
example, the Oahu town of Haleiwa is Ha-lay-ee-vah. At the beginning 
of words and after a, u, and o, though, it’s usually your standard w
sound — hence Wailea (why-lay-ah) and Makawao (mah-kah-wow), two
Maui destinations.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
326

The vowels are pronounced like this:
a
ah (as in father) or uh (as in above)
e
eh (as in bed) or ay (as in they)
i
ee (as in police)
o
oh (as in vote)
u
oo (as in too)
You sound almost all vowels separately, although you do pronounce
some together, as in the name of Waikiki’s main thoroughfare, Kalakaua
Avenue, which is pronounced kah-lah-cow-ah.
Remember this tip when trying to pronounce a Hawaiian word or name:
Get into the habit of seeing long words or names as a collection of short
syllables, and you’ll find them much easier to say. (Accents almost
always fall on the second-to-last syllable.)
The trick is to know where to put on the breaks. That leads me to impor-
tant tip number two: All syllables end with vowels, so a consonant
always indicates the start of a new syllable. An example: The tongue-
twisting Kealakekua Bay (the famous marine preserve off the Big Island’s
Kona coast), which throws nearly everyone for a loop. Break the sylla-
bles down by reading the consonants as red flags, though, and see how
easy it becomes: kay-ah-lah-keh-koo-ah.
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Lose the Tourist Trappings 327
Discovering more about the 
Hawaiian language
If the vocabulary list and pronunciation key in this chapter whet your appetite for the
Hawaiian language, a few Web sites can help you discover more. Probably most com-
prehensive — and the best place to start — is the Hawaiian Language Web site
(www.geocities.com/~olelo), which is great for beginners.
If you want to translate specific words or terms, use the searchable online dictionar-
ies at the Coconut Boyz’ Hawaiian Dictionary (www.hisurf.com/hawaiian/
dictionary.html) and Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library (www.
wehewehe.org).
If you prefer a hard-copy Hawaiian-language reference or dictionary, you can find
several at online bookstores, including Arthur Schultz’s pocket-size All About
Hawaiian, and the comprehensive New Pocket Hawaiian Dictionary, published by
the University of Hawaii and generally considered the standard; you can order it online
at www.uhpress.hawaii.edu.

The Hawaiian language actually has a 13th character: the glottal stop,
which looks exactly like a single opening quotation mark (’) and is meant
to indicate a pause. I’ve chosen not to use the glottal stop throughout
this book; it’s often left out in printed Hawaiian and on store and street
signs. Although serious Hawaiian-language students study volumes
about the glottal stop and its equal importance to its fellow consonants
and vowels, you don’t need to worry about it for your purposes; you can
basically ignore it when you see it.
I lay out these basics so that you can understand how the language
works, but don’t expect to become an expert at pronouncing Hawaiian
words anytime soon. Whenever I return to Hawaii, I always feel that it
takes me a day or two to get my tongue back in working order — and I
know this stuff. Still, I have fun practicing — and with these basic tools
under your belt, you’ll quickly get the hang of it. Practice with aloha and
mahalo and you’ll really impress the locals when you get to Maui.
Knowing How to Give and Take Directions
Leave your compass at home, because islanders have a different sense
of direction than mainlanders do. Even though locals think of the islands
as having north shores and south shores, west coasts and east coasts,
seldom does anybody direct you using the most common directional
terms.
Instead, they send you either makai (ma-kai), a directional meaning
toward the sea, or mauka (mow-kah), meaning toward the mountains.
Because each island is basically a volcano with a single coastal road cir-
cling it, those two terms are often all you need to know. When makai and
mauka don’t do the trick, locals are likely to invoke relative terms rather
than north, south, east, or west.
Remembering That You’re in the United States
Don’t say “back home in the U.S.” when you’re talking to folks in Maui.
This tip seems like a real no-brainer, but that long flight across the
Pacific and the one-of-a-kind Hawaii ambience and culture can really play
tricks with your mind. Islanders are, by and large, a patriotic bunch, so
they don’t take kindly to being left off the national map. Refer to the con-
tinental United States as the mainland, which is what they do.
Another very important point in the same vein: Locals are always called
islanders, never Hawaiians, unless they’re of native blood, which not that
many islanders are. (Hawaiian is an ethnic label.) Many families who
have made their homes in the islands for centuries are of Chinese,
Japanese, South Pacific, or even Portuguese decent — or usually some
rich generational combination of ethnicities.

Wearing Sunscreen
You don’t need a trained eye to spot the newest arrivals — they’re 
lobster-red from their excruciating sunburns. Way too many newcomers
fry themselves on day one of their vacations in an overzealous quest to
tan, putting a major damper on their trip — and, sometimes, their long-
term health — in the process.
Hawaii’s sun-loving population has achieved the dubious distinction of
having the highest incidence of skin cancer in the United States, and as a
result, has developed quite an attachment to sunscreen. Deep-tanning
Coppertone days are a thing of the past, so islanders will merely look on
in horror rather than admiration if you whip out a bottle of SPF 8 to
spread on your just-flown-in virgin skin.
Most locals I know use SPF 25 or SPF 30 sunscreen on a daily basis; you
should, too. Never go out in the sun, not even for ten minutes, wearing
anything less than SPF 15. Stick with an SPF 30 or SPF 45 if you have a
light complexion.
You don’t need a high-ticket brand. In fact, I’ve had some of the best luck
with garden-variety drugstore brands (although I do love the California
Tan Heliotherapy line). Just find something that works for you and stick
with it. Conversely, if you find that a certain sunscreen doesn’t jibe with
your skin’s chemistry, don’t lament the $8 you spent; simply toss the
bottle and switch to something else before you find yourself burned.
Your best bet is to apply sunscreen — liberally — first thing in the morn-
ing, before you get dressed (to avoid missing those inch-below-the-cuff
spots, which can result in nasty burns). Apply more sunscreen before
you head to the beach, and do regular reapplications (every hour or two)
as you sit on the sand, no matter how high the SPF. Don’t throw on a 
T-shirt and consider yourself covered; the average white T-shirt only offers
coverage equal to SPF 6 sunscreen. And ignore all claims of “waterproof” —
always give yourself a fresh coat immediately after swimming.
Always make sure you apply sunscreen under bathing-suit straps, on the
tops of your feet, on the back of your neck, and on your ears and lips —
all spots that are the easiest to forget but the most sensitive to painful
burns. To prevent sunscreen from dripping into your eyes, use a waxy
sunscreen stick around your eyes and a high-SPF lip balm; both are avail-
able at just about any Hawaii convenience store.
Additionally, sunglasses and a hat are two more important weapons for
fending off the island sun. Throw away those $5 shades and splurge on 
a decent pair with UV filters to protect your corneas from sunburn and
to prevent cataracts. Wear a hat with a wide brim that goes all the way
around because baseball caps leave some of your most vulnerable 
areas — your ears and neck — exposed to the sun’s harsh rays.
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Lose the Tourist Trappings 329

Infants under 6 months should not be directly exposed to the harsh
Hawaii sun. Older babies need zinc oxide to protect their fragile skin,
and kids should be slathered with high-SPF sunscreen every hour. They
also need shades, hats, and other protective gear.
Dressing the Part
You probably can’t think of anything more tacky-touristy than a bold
tropical-patterned aloha shirt, right? Wrong!
Invented by an enterprising Honolulu tailor looking for a new way to
drum up business in 1936, the aloha shirt has spawned a whole wardrobe
of bright, tropical-print clothing for men, women, and children, collec-
tively known as aloha wear. In the process, aloha wear has developed
into a way of life in the Hawaiian Islands. Spirited, beautiful, easy to wear,
and comfortable, aloha wear is the embodiment of the Hawaii lifestyle.
Aloha wear is acceptable just about anywhere in Hawaii, from the beach
to the boardroom to the best table at a four-star restaurant. Of course,
the key to wearing aloha wear well is understanding the line that sepa-
rates sublime from goofy — or, in plainer terms, how to tell good aloha
wear from bad aloha wear.
You can find aloha wear in any shape, from traditional aloha shirts (wear-
able by men and women alike) to generous women’s muumuus or sexy
minidresses. Basically, the key is quality. Silk is top of the line, and great for
evening, but skip it for daywear on warm days (when you may perspire).
Quality rayon and cotton are terrific alternatives for day and evening.
Look for beautiful, well-designed prints with strong colors and no bleed-
ing. Look for quality buttons (coconut or wood are best but not a must)
and pattern matching at the seams and pockets. Excellent brands that
offer consistently top-quality aloha wear include Kahala Sportswear,
Kamehameha Garment Co., and the Paradise Found and Diamond
Head labels, all of which have revived vintage designs; Reyn’s, which
boasts beautiful patterns in a range of flattering styles, especially for
women; Tommy Bahama’s, whose top-quality clothing lines are generi-
cally tropical but suit the Hawaii mood perfectly; and, one of my all-time
favorites, Tori Richard, which employs some of Hawaii’s finest artists to
design its patterns. Sig Zane’s all-cotton aloha wear and accessories are
the height of subdued sophistication and nature-inspired beauty. Hilo
Hattie is the largest manufacturer and distributor of aloha wear (produc-
ing more than 300,000 shirts annually); although Hilo Hattie’s stuff isn’t
the height of aloha fashion, its quality has increased substantially in
recent years and it remains very affordable.
The cardinal rule of wearing aloha wear like a local rather than a 
tourist? No matching. No themed husband-and-wife shirts, no mother-
and-daughter muumuus, no two garments on one person in the same
pattern. Period.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
330

At some of the high-end resorts or fancier restaurants — the big-money
places, the kind that would require a jacket and tie if you were on the
mainland — they request that you wear “resort attire.” For women, resort
attire generally means a long or short dress or coordinating pants and 
top — more dressy-casual than full dressy, if you know what I mean. For
men, it generally translates to pants (not shorts) and a collared shirt.
Neatly presented aloha wear always does the trick, of course. (A tiny
handful of Maui’s most expensive resort restaurants do require men to
wear a jacket, but I don’t recommend them. Go to Europe if you want to
pack a blazer.)
Don’t let a flower lei outstay its welcome. Fresh-flower leis are a short-
term treat, enjoyed at the height of their fragrance and beauty and dis-
posed of after the moment has passed. So don’t wear old, dying leis;
nothing will peg you as a tourist with a capital T quite so blatantly. Most
leis only last a day — which provides you with the perfect excuse to find
a fresh one tomorrow!
Remembering Your Island-Style Manners
In many Eastern cultures, the common practice is to remove your shoes
when you enter a private home. Hawaii homeowners follow the same
practice — which is one reason why flip-flops and other slip-on-style
shoes are so common in the islands. You find that this practice is almost
always upheld in bed-and-breakfasts, and even condos may request that
you leave your shoes at the door. No one is policing you, of course, but
be sure to honor the request.
Islanders pride themselves on their laid-back manner and friendliness,
and they really show it in their driving habits — so leave your need for
speed at home. Take it easy, don’t be in a hurry, and don’t honk your
horn to chastise other drivers, which islanders consider the height of
rudeness. If the car in front of you isn’t moving quickly enough or some-
one cuts you off, just let it slide. Use your car horn to greet friends in
Hawaii.
Leaving Your Laptop at Home 
Islanders tend to take life nice and easy. The clock doesn’t rule them,
and they don’t like to rush. They call it “island time.” Buy into it — lock,
stock, and barrel — while you’re there. Do as the locals do: Take life as it
comes, don’t stress if things don’t happen with the utmost timeliness,
and leave plenty of space in your day to do nothing but appreciate the
beauty that surrounds you.
Smiling a Lot and Saying “Aloha” to Strangers
Who knows? You may even get yourself mistaken for a local.

Ten Ways to Enjoy 
Maui’s Romance
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how to relax and let the island vibe take over
 Making magical memories together
M
aui is the place to leave it all behind. Relax and bask in the
romance. In this chapter, I give you the ten best ways to forget it
all and find Hawaiian happiness no matter how you define romance.
Luxuriating in the Lap of Luxury
Sometimes you just have to indulge yourself — especially if this trip is
your honeymoon. Theoretically, you only do this once, so you may as
well do it right. If staying in an oceanfront room that lets the sound of
the waves lull you to sleep and the caress of the ocean breeze kiss you
awake is important to you, or if you’ve found the luxury B&B of your
dreams tucked away in a rain-forest hideaway, don’t visit Maui on the
cheap. Spend the extra money and make memories.
If you really want to splurge on that ultradeluxe beach resort or a zippy
convertible sports car but you’re worried about the cost, consider splurg-
ing for just part of your trip. Book the oceanfront suite or red convertible
Mustang for a few days (cruising the road to Hana with the top down is
the ultimate Hawaii vacation dream), and make more budget-friendly
choices during the rest of your stay (perhaps by moving to a still-romantic
but more affordable B&B in Upcountry Maui). You won’t regret it, nor will
you feel quite so guilty about it after you add up your total costs.
Making Maui Feel Like Paradise 
at Any Budget
But maybe your budget just doesn’t allow for a big splurge. Don’t
despair — despite all those luxury resorts, Maui doesn’t have to be a
super-expensive destination.

To find true Hawaii happiness, follow this rule: The simpler, the better.
You don’t need a flat-screen TV, 24-hour butler service, or a telephone in
the bathroom to be content. Some of my happiest times on Maui have
been spent sitting on the lanai of a budget condo, watching the sunrise
as I sipped home-brewed, Maui-grown coffee and nibbled on fresh
papaya bought from a farm stand. Room service and Frette bed linens
wouldn’t have improved the moment one iota. So you don’t have to
overdo it — save the extra dough for having fun!
Planning Your Time before You Leave Home
After you’ve booked your airfare, accommodations, and rental car,
you’re set until you get to Maui — unless you’re dying to partake in
some specific activity after you arrive.
If you have your heart set on dining at a particular special-occasion restau-
rant, catching a highly recommended snorkel cruise, or attending a certain
live performance, special event, or luau, make your reservations from
home; otherwise, you may miss out, which would be a crying shame.
Certain popular activities, such as the terrific Old Lahaina Luau or
Trilogy snorkel cruises, book up weeks in advance, as do tee times at the
top golf courses and tables at in-demand restaurants. Make any can’t-
miss plans before you leave home. See Chapter 8 for more details.
Setting Aside Time for Relaxation
Work plenty of do-nothing time into your plans. Keep your time loose
and go with the flow; don’t plan your days in the same detailed way
you’d map out your itinerary on a grand tour of Europe, with its myriad
museums and historical sites.
A romantic getaway to Maui is less about seeing everything and more
about leaving the conventions of regular life — including a hard-core
commitment to time management — behind. Don’t feel guilty that you’re
not doing or seeing enough. You do enough the other 50 weeks out of
the year, don’t you?
Enjoying a Heavenly Drive
No Hawaii road is more celebrated than the “heavenly” Hana Highway
(Highway 36), the super-curvaceous road that winds along Maui’s north-
eastern shore, offering some of the most stunning natural sightseeing in
the entire state.
The Hana Highway winds for some 52 miles east from Kahului, crossing
more than 50 one-lane bridges, passing greener-than-green taro patches,
magnificent seascapes, waterfalls, botanical gardens, and rain forests
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Enjoy Maui’s Romance 333

before passing through the little town of Hana and ultimately ending up
in one of Hawaii’s most beautiful tropical places: the Kipahulu section of
Haleakala National Park. Kipahulu is home to Oheo (oh-hay-oh) Gulch, a
series of waterfall pools that tumble down to the ocean. Just past the
town of Hana is romantic Hamoa Beach. (Learn more about Hamoa in
the section “Spending a Day at Maui’s Most Romantic Beach.”)
Despite the draws at the end of the road, remember that this drive isn’t
so much about the destination as it is about the journey. The drive takes
at least three hours, but allow all day to do it. If you race to arrive in Hana
as quickly as you can, you’ll be as perplexed as so many others who just
don’t understand the drive. Start out early, take it slow and easy, stop at
scenic points along the way, and let the Hana Road work its magic on
you. It will — I promise. In fact, for the ultimate romantic getaway, I sug-
gest staying overnight in Hana (see Chapter 10 for recommendations).
See Chapter 13 for full coverage of the drive, including great stops along
the way.
Making Mornings Your Ocean Time
Maui’s beaches tend to be less crowded, and the surf and winds tend to
be calmer, in the morning hours — particularly in winter. Always take
the day’s first snorkel and dive cruise, when conditions are calmest and
clearest; outfitters don’t offer discounts on their afternoon sails either.
Romancing a Day at the Beach
Off the Hana Highway (see earlier in this chapter), about 21⁄2 miles past
the town of Hana, Hamoa Beach is a remote, romantic spot. This half-
moon-shaped beach at Maui’s easternmost point is breathtakingly
lovely, with surf the color of turquoise, golden-gray sand, and verdant
hills providing a postcard-perfect backdrop. The Hotel Hana-Maui likes
to maintain the beach as its own, but it has to share, so even if you’re
not staying at the hotel, feel free to make your way down the steps from
the lava-rock lookout point and stake out your spot. If you are staying at
the hotel, you’ll enjoy a free shuttle ride down the hill and waveside
service. The beach is generally good for swimming and wave-riding in
the gentle seasons, but stick close to the shore because the ocean is
open and unprotected. Stay out of the water entirely in winter, but come
to enjoy the glorious setting anyway. The hotel maintains minimal facili-
ties for nonguests, including a restroom.
Toasting the Sunset Every Evening
You can’t get closer to the ocean than the alfresco tables at I’o, 505
Front St., Lahaina (% 808-661-8422; www.iomaui.com; $$$$). Overseen
Part V: The Part of Tens 
334

by the award-winning chef James McDonald, I’o is a multifaceted joy,
with a winningly innovative, mostly seafood menu, first-rate service, and
a top-notch wine list.
My favorite casual Kaanapali restaurant, the Hula Grill Kaanapali, in
Whaler’s Village, 2435 Kaanapali Pkwy. (% 808-667-6636; www.hulapie.
com; $$$), serves an excellent steak-and-seafood menu and overflows
with quintessential Hawaii charm. The indoor/outdoor setting on the
sand is ideal for sunset-watchers; tiki torches make the after-dark hours
magical as well. Diners on a budget can stick to the bar menu ($) without
losing out on ambience.
Despite the high prices, I just love Mama’s Fish House, just off the Hana
Highway, at 799 Poho Place, Paia (% 808-579-8488; www.mamasfish
house.com; $$$$$). The fresh fish is as fabulous as it can be, and the
beachfront tiki-room setting is quintessential romantic Hawaii. The
lengthy list of tropical drinks (with umbrellas!) puts you right in the
mood. My favorite restaurant on the island, hands down.
Mala, an Ocean Tavern, 1307 Front St., Lahaina (% 808-667-9394; www.
malaoceantavern.com; $$$–$$$$), makes sunset a somewhat more
affordable, but no less spectacular, celebration. The tiki torch–lit terrace
is so close to the surf that you may just feel the sea spray kiss your
cheek when the wind kicks up. This is such a marvelous spot that green
sea turtles regularly hang out in the shallows here — apparently, they
know how satisfying the food and ambience are, too.
Sarento’s on the Beach, 2980 S. Kihei Rd., Kihei (% 808-875-7555; www.
tristarrestaurants.com; $$$$–$$$$$), seamlessly fuses white-linen
elegance and white-sand romance, making this sophisticated Italian-
Mediterranean outpost a wonderful place to celebrate the majesty of a
Maui sunset every evening. If you don’t want to splurge on dinner, take a
seat in the sexy bar to revel in a pair of perfectly poured cocktails and
stupendous sunset views.
Dining in Style
Dubbed “Maui’s little French jewel” by Bon Appétit, Gerard’s, in the
Plantation Inn, 174 Lahainaluna Rd., Lahaina (% 808-661-8939; www.
gerardsmaui.com; $$$$$), is an excellent choice for couples in love.
Gerard’s may be the perfect special-occasion restaurant; the garden
patio tables are the prime place to woo.
Lahaina Grill, 127 Lahainaluna Rd., Lahaina (% 808-667-5117; www.
lahainagrill.com; $$$$–$$$$$), is consistently voted “Best of Maui”
for good reason; it repeatedly offers a faultless dining experience. (Last
time I was here, a honeymooning couple sitting next to me reported that
they loved Lahaina Grill so much that they dined here three times in the
week they were on Maui.) Expect distinctive New American flavors that
Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Enjoy Maui’s Romance 335

are bold without being overpowering. The dining room is stylish yet
delightfully homey, and the expert service is a nice change of pace from
the usual Maui surfer style.
Sonz Maui at Swan Court, at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa, 200
Nohea Kai Dr., Kaanapali (% 808-667-4506; www.sonzmaui.com; $$$$$),
is a welcome recent addition to the West Maui dining scene, thanks to its
warmly romantic setting, first-rate service, and genuinely innovative
Hawaii Regional Cuisine that makes the most of Maui’s local bounty.
Classic European twists add both heartwarming comfort and delightful
surprises. One of the island’s finest wine lists is the cherry on this very
pleasing cake.
Haliimaile General Store, 900 Haliimaile Rd., Haliimaile (% 808-572-
2666; www.bevgannonrestaurants.com; $$$$), continues to deliver
one of Hawaii’s finest all-around dining experiences. The top-quality,
island-style cooking of Chef Bev Gannon, the queen bee of Hawaii
Regional Cuisine, is joyfully presented in a refreshingly casual and 
pretension-free, plantation-style setting. A delight from start to finish, 
it’s well worth the drive Upcountry for couples in search of a casually
romantic experience. See Chapter 12.
Capische?, in the Diamond Hawaii Resort & Spa, 555 Kaukahi St., Wailea
(% 808-879-2224. www.capische.com; $$$$$), is my first choice for
romance in South Maui. This top-quality Mediterranean-Italian spot is in
a fabulous alfresco setting with dreamily panoramic views of the South
Maui coast, plus a delightfully indulgent menu that will make you feel as
though you’ve dined somewhere truly special.
Joe’s Bar & Grill, at the Wailea Tennis Center, 131 Wailea Ike Dr., Wailea
(% 808-875-7767; www.bevgannonrestaurants.com; $$$$), is another
wonderful South Maui choice. Joe’s serves a pleasing menu of upscale
American home cooking with island twists, and low lighting and well-
spaced tables make for a surprisingly romantic ambience after dark.
For a complete listing of all the restaurants I recommend, see Chapter 11.
Mellowing Out Like a Local
Islanders tend to take life nice and easy. A clock doesn’t rule them, and
they don’t like to rush. They call it “island time.” While you’re in Maui,
do as the locals do: Take life as it comes. Don’t stress if things don’t
happen with the utmost timeliness. And leave plenty of space in your
day for you and your beloved to do nothing but appreciate the beauty
that surrounds you.
You probably already know the Hawaiian word aloha, which serves as an
all-purpose greeting — hello, welcome, or goodbye. But what it really
Part V: The Part of Tens 
336

means is “love” — and that’s the whole purpose of your visit to Hawaii,
isn’t it? Aloha is a warm and wonderful word, full of grace, compassion,
and good feeling, so use it liberally; I can’t think of a better way to get
caught up in Hawaii’s true spirit.

Area Code
All the Hawaiian Islands are in the 808 area
code. Note that if you’re calling another
island from Maui, you must dial 1-808 first,
and you’ll be billed at long-distance rates
(which can be more expensive than call-
ing the mainland, so be sure to use a long-
distance calling card if your cellphone
package doesn’t come with free long dis-
tance). You can leave off the area code
when you’re on Maui and calling another
Maui number.
ATMs
All the major resort areas on Maui have
plenty of ATMs. Branches of Hawaii’s most
popular banks are plentiful, and all are
connected to the major global ATM net-
works. Most supermarkets also have
ATMs inside (though these may charge a
higher fee). Do yourself a favor and don’t
set off for a remote area (say, Upcountry or
Hana) without stocking up on cash first: I
also recommend taking the same approach
if you visit the islands of Molokai or Lanai.
These areas do have ATMs, but why waste
your precious vacation time tracking them
down?
One of Hawaii’s most popular banks, with
branches throughout the state, is Bank of
Hawaii, which is linked with all the major
worldwide networks. To find the one near-
est you, call % 888-643-3888 or point your

Emergencies
Dial % 911 from any phone, just like back
home.
Etiquette
Hawaii’s customs are much like those on
the mainland, but take notice of a few
small differences.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 339

In Hawaii, remove your shoes before
entering anyone’s home. Most bed-and-
breakfasts are likely to make the same
request of you.
Aloha wear is perfectly acceptable (and
wonderfully festive) formal wear in the
islands. There’s no need to bring more
formal wear to the islands. If you prefer
something more subdued, resort casual
(such as a polo shirt and trousers for men,
warm-weather dresses or pants and top
for women) is appropriate even in the
finest resorts and restaurants.
When you’re driving, don’t honk your horn
in frustration. Chill out like the locals; honk-
ing to hurry someone along or to express
anger is considered rude. Islanders only
honk to greet friends.
Don’t say, “Back home in the U.S. . . .”
Most folks refer to the lower 48 as the
mainland.
Holidays
In addition to the same national holidays
observed in the rest of the United States,
Hawaii celebrates a few other special
days: Prince Kuhio Day (Mar 26), King
Kamehameha Day (June 11), and
Statehood Day, sometimes called
Admission Day (the third Fri in Aug). All
government offices are closed, and some
local businesses may close as well, so
plan accordingly. See the calendar of
events in Chapter 3 for a full rundown of
Maui’s special celebrations.
Hospitals
Around-the-clock emergency care is avail-
able from Maui Memorial Medical Center,
221 Mahalani St., Wailuku (% 808-244-
9056; www.mmmc.hhsc.org), in Central
Maui. This is the island’s only full-service
hospital.
Information
The Maui Visitors Bureau is located in
Central Maui at 1727 Wili Pa Loop, Wailuku,
HI 96793 (% 800-525-6284 or 808-244-3530;
www.visitmaui.com), but it’s not really
designed as a walk-in office. Call before
you leave home to order your free Maui
travel planner or check the Web site for a
wealth of good information.
Some of Maui’s resort areas have dedicated
visitor associations that provide information,
including the Kaanapali Beach Resort Asso-
ciation (% 808-661-3271; www.kaanapali
resort.com) and the Kapalua Resort 
(% 800-527-2482; www.kapaluamaui.
com). For official national park information,
contact Haleakala National Park (% 808-
572-4400; www.nps.gov/hale).
After you land at Kahului Airport, stop over
at the state-operated Visitor Information
Center while you’re waiting for your bag-
gage and pick up a copy of This Week
Maui, 101 Things to Do on Maui, and other
free tourist publications, many with great
maps of the island. If you forget, don’t
worry — you can find them at malls and
shopping centers around the island.
In addition, all the big resort hotels are
overflowing with printed info. Even if your
hotel or condo doesn’t have a dedicated
concierge, the staff can point you in the
right direction, make recommendations,
and give advice.
For information on the island of Molokai,
contact the Molokai Visitors Association,
located at the Moore Center, 2 Kamoi St.,
Suite 200, Kaunakakai, HI 96748 (% 800-
800-6367 or 808-553-3876; www.molokai-
hawaii.com). 
For information on the island of Lanai, con-
tact Destination Lanai (% 800-947-4774;
www.visitlanai.net).

Internet Access
Almost all hotels offer wireless or wired
Internet access that you can connect to
using your personal computer; the price of
access can range from complimentary to
$15 or $20 a day. Most bed-and-breakfasts
and condos even offer Internet access
these days. Check with your hotel in
advance to see what your options are.
Brand-name hotels usually have business
centers where you can check your e-mail on
one of their computers; often access is free
unless you want to print, but call ahead to
confirm if it matters, as a few still do charge.
Liquor Laws
The legal drinking age in Hawaii is 21.
Beer, wine, and liquor are sold in grocery
and convenience stores at any hour, seven
days a week. It’s technically illegal to have
an open container on the beach. Bars stay
open until 2 a.m.; places with cabaret
licenses are able to keep the booze flow-
ing until 4 a.m. Grocery and convenience
stores are allowed to sell beer, wine, and
liquor seven days a week.
Maps
AAA supplies excellent free maps of Hawaii 
to members only. For more information on
becoming a member, see Chapter 4.
All rental-car companies hand out good
free map booklets of Maui to navigate your
way around, as do the free visitor publica-
tions available around the island.
If you want more complete topographic
maps of each island, the best are printed
by the University of Hawaii Press. They’re
available from just about any bookstore in
the islands. If you want to order them
before you leave home, contact Basically
Books, 160 Kamehameha Ave., Hilo, HI
96720 (% 800-903-6277 or 808-961-0144;
www.basicallybooks.com). Or go
straight to the source and order them
directly from the UH Press (www.
uhpress.hawaii.edu).
Newspapers/Magazines
The Maui News (www.mauinews.com) is
the island’s daily paper; the Web site can
provide you with a great source of infor-
mation before you leave home. Additionally,
a number of free newspaper weeklies,
such as Maui Time and the Maui Weekly,
are available from racks around town.
If you’re interested in the performing arts,
look for a copy of Centerpiece, the free
bimonthly magazine published by the Maui
Arts and Cultural Center. Hotel concierges
usually have copies.
Hawaii magazine is a glossy monthly that’s
targeted to visitors; it offers a good intro-
duction to the islands. You can usually find
the current issue in the travel magazine
section at your local branch of the big
chain bookstores, such as Borders and
Barnes & Noble.
The Honolulu Advertiser (www.honolulu
advertiser.com) and the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin (www.starbulletin.com)
are the two statewide daily newspapers.
Ocean Safety
Keep these snorkel tips in mind as you don
your fins and head into the water:
Always snorkel with a friend and keep an
eye on each other.
Look up every few minutes to get your
bearings. Check your position in relation to
the shoreline and check whether there’s
any boat traffic.
Don’t touch anything. Not only can your fin-
gers and feet damage coral, but it can give
you nasty cuts. Moreover, camouflaged
fish and spiny shells may surprise you.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 341

Before you set out, check surf conditions
by calling one of the local dive or snorkel
shops, which can give you the latest on
local conditions and recommend alterna-
tive spots if the prime ones are too rough
for snorkeling.
Pharmacies
Longs Drugs (www.longs.com), 
Hawaii’s biggest drugstore chain, has a
branch in Central Maui at the Maui Mall,
70 Kaahumanu Ave. (between Puunene
Avenue and the Hana Highway), Kahului
(% 808-877-0041). If you’re in West Maui,
head to the branch at Lahaina Cannery Mall,
1221 Honoapiilani Hwy. (between Kapunkea
and Kenui streets), Lahaina (% 808-667-
4384). In South Maui, head to Longs Kihei
Center, 1215 S. Kihei Rd. (just north of Lipoa
Street), Kihei (% 808-879-2259).
Police
The main headquarters of the Maui Police
Department is in Wailuku at 55 Mahalani
St., near Maui Memorial Medical Center
(% 808-244-6300). District stations are
located next to the Lahaina Civic Center,
1760 Honoapiilani Hwy., on the mountain
side of the highway, just north of Lahaina
(% 808-661-4441), and in Hana on the Hana
Highway, near Ua Kea Road (% 808-248-
8311). Of course, if you have an emergency, 
dial % 911 from any phone.
Post Offices
In West Maui, a big branch office is 
next to the Lahaina Civic Center at 1760
Honoapiilani Hwy. between Kaanapali and
Lahaina (on the mountain side of the high-
way; it’s easy to spot; % 808-661-8227),
and in downtown Lahaina adjacent to the
Lahaina Shopping Center, 132 Papalaua St.
(between Front and Wainee streets; 
% 808-661-0904).
In South Maui, you find a post office at
1254 S. Kihei Rd., across the street from
Longs Kihei Center (% 808-874-9143).
Satellite post offices are located around
the island, as well as on Molokai and
Lanai; to find the one nearest you, call 
% 800-275-8777 or visit www.usps.com.
Safety
Although Hawaii is generally quite safe,
visitors have been crime victims, so stay
alert. The most common crime against
tourists is rental-car break-ins. Never
leave any valuables in your car, not even in
your trunk. Thieves can be in and out of
your trunk faster than you can open it with
your own key.
Be especially careful at high-risk areas,
such as beaches and remote areas. Never
carry large amounts of cash with you. Stay
in well-lighted areas after dark. Don’t hike
on deserted trails alone.
See Chapter 12 for tips on ocean safety
and more. Chapter 8 has additional tips on
staying healthy when you travel.
Smoking
In Hawaii, smoking is against the law in all
enclosed public spaces, period, including
bars and restaurants. In addition, no smok-
ing is allowed within 20 feet of doorways,
windows, or ventilation intakes. Hotels are
allowed to reserve 20 percent of their
rooms for smokers, as long as they’re clus-
tered on the same floor; notable excep-
tions include Westin and Marriott hotels,
which are now 100 percent smoke free, as
are most B&Bs. Car-rental agencies also
have mostly smoke-free cars; if you want a
car you can smoke in, it’s best to note it
when you make your reservation.

Taxes
Most purchases in Hawaii are taxed at
roughly 4 percent; the exact amount will
vary depending on the county you’re in and
may be embedded in the total purchase
price or shown as an independent line item
on your bill. Expect taxes of about 11.42
percent to be added to your hotel bill.
Taxis
Call Maui Airport Taxi (% 808-281-9533;
www.nokaoitaxi.com), Kihei Taxi 
(% 808-879-3000), Wailea Taxi (% 808-
874-5000), or Maui Taxi Service (% 808-
276-9515; www.mauipleasanttaxi.
com). The mandated fare on Maui is $3 per
mile, accommodating up to six people.
Time
Hawaii standard time is in effect year-
round. Hawaii is two hours behind Pacific
standard time and five hours behind east-
ern standard time. In other words, when
it’s noon in Hawaii, it’s 2 p.m. in California
and 5 p.m. in New York during standard
time on the mainland. 
Hawaii doesn’t observe daylight saving
time, so when daylight saving time is in
effect on the mainland, Hawaii is three
hours behind the West Coast and six hours
behind the East Coast — so in summer,
when it’s noon in Hawaii, it’s 3 p.m. in
California and 6 p.m. in New York.
Hawaii is east of the International Date
Line, putting it on the same day as the U.S.
mainland and Canada, and a day behind
Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.
For the exact local time, call 
% 808-643-8463.
Traffic Laws
Hawaii is a no-fault insurance state. If you
drive without collision-damage insurance,
you’re required to pay for all damages
before you leave the state, regardless of
who is at fault. Your personal auto policy
may provide rental-car coverage; read
your policy or check with your insurer
before you leave home and bring your
insurance ID card if you decline the rental-
car company’s optional insurance. Some
credit-card companies also provide colli-
sion damage insurance; check with yours.
Seatbelts are mandatory for everyone in
the car, all the time, and children under 4
must be strapped into car seats.
You can turn right on red unless a posted
sign specifies otherwise.
Pedestrians always have the right of way,
even if they’re not in a crosswalk
