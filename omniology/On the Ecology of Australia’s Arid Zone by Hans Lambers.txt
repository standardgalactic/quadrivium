Introduction
Hans Lambers
Australia is the flattest and driest vegetated continent on Earth. More than two-­
thirds of the land is considered arid, and half is desert, which supports an amazingly 
adapted flora and fauna (White 1994). The iconic Red Centre of Australia broadly 
corresponds with the driest part of the continent, the Australian Arid Zone, suggest-
ing that redness is related to aridity. However, the history of redness in Central 
Australia is longer than that of the Australian Arid Zone (Pillans 2018). The arid 
zone is Australia’s largest biome, occupying approximately 70% of the entire conti-
nent. It hosts a variety of vegetation types from shrub woodlands, acacia and mallee 
eucalypt shrublands, spinifex grasslands, tussock and hummock grasslands and 
chenopod shrublands, with a complex evolutionary history in both plants and ani-
mals (Byrne et al. 2018).
Australia’s arid zone has an amazing flora and fauna. The plants not only have to 
cope with low and erratic rainfall (Grigg et al. 2008a, b) but also with nutrient-­
impoverished soils (He et al. 2018). The suite of marsupials now found inhabiting 
the arid zone is nowhere near what the first European settlers in the late eighteenth 
and early nineteenth centuries would have seen (Woinarski et  al. 2015). Early 
explorers of the arid zone described how they needed to erect barriers around their 
tents to prevent marauding ‘rat kangaroos’ from raiding their stores of biscuits and 
other provisions. The situation is vastly different today. In the Little Sandy Desert 
in Western Australia, for example, there were 43 mammal species present at the 
time of European settlement. Of those, 19 are still present, but a further 19 marsu-
pial species and six rodents once collected there are now regionally extinct 
(Bradshaw 2018). The arid zone may seem an unusual location for frogs, but to 
date, 52 species have been recorded (Roberts and Edwards 2018). It has a reptilian 
fauna that is at least three times as rich in number of species as that of other desert 
regions of the world. Yet, their ecophysiology has been little studied, and we only

have ­speculations and hypotheses to account for reptile abundance and diversity 
(Bradshaw 2018).
The Australian terrestrial invertebrate fauna is highly diverse, with many 
immense radiations as well as archaic, relictual elements. However, the arid zone 
fauna has arguably received considerably less attention, and many discoveries can 
still be made in this area (Majer et al. 2018). A remarkable component of the inver-
tebrate fauna lives belowground, either aquatic in groundwater or air-breathing in 
the unsaturated zone from depths of a metre or so below the ground surface down to 
the water table (Halse 2018).
Although fire is widespread and a major ecosystem disturbance throughout 
Australia, it is a relatively rare event in much of the arid lands, because rainfall and, 
therefore, productivity are generally too low to support the dense vegetation needed 
to sustain fires (van Etten and Burrows 2018). However, landscapes dominated by 
xerophytic perennial grasses, where infrequent periods with above-average rainfall 
can result in exceptional grass and herb growth, may experience fire more fre-
quently. Climate change and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations have also 
been linked to increased fire activity in arid zones (van Etten and Burrows 2018).
A book on Australia’s arid zone is not complete without a chapter on its archaeol-
ogy, given the very long time humans have occupied this part of Australia. First 
occupation occurs between 51,100 and 46,200 years ago (Veth et al. 2017). The 
archaeological evidence for animal depictions from the North West arid zone reveals 
a long figurative tradition, which spans the Last Glacial Maximum and continues 
throughout the Holocene. Species depicted include large-range fauna, species out-
side their current distributions or extinct, e.g., bandicoot and thylacine. While depic-
tions may have been executed to inform dietary, regenerative, totemic and 
mythological narratives, there is a precision in anatomical detail in some classes 
which allows attribution to genus and species levels. The painting and engraving 
traditions of the North West arid zone clearly have a significant naturalistic compo-
nent, which is significant for studies of human and natural ecology (Veth et al. 
2018).
The book ends with three chapters discussing the threats to Australia’s arid zone. 
These include weeds, over 400 alien plant species making up less than 9.7% of the 
flora, depending on the region. Most of these introductions are not genuinely inva-
sive species, and only a small proportion have a negative impact on their local eco-
system. However, the negative impacts that do occur are far-ranging and difficult to 
manage, because of the distances and remoteness of the area, a lack of economic 
incentives for control and contention regarding the economic, environmental and 
social benefits and costs of some species. Management will need to respond to 
changes in climate with research required into adaptive responses (Scott et al. 2018). 
Following European settlement, Australia also experienced an invasion of exotic 
animals, either deliberately introduced for transport, livestock, as companion ani-
mals or for recreational hunting. Many of these became feral pests and quickly 
spread across the continent, occupying a diversity of habitats including the semiarid 
and arid regions. In an environment naïve to their ecology, they have caused and 
continue to cause substantial adverse economic and environmental damage. The 
H. Lambers

extent of damage is largely a function of the density of the feral animal species. In 
order to manage feral animals in a cost-effective manner that reduces impact on 
values, it is necessary to understand and quantify the relationships between densi-
ties of feral animals and the damage they cause (Burrows 2018). A third threat is 
climate change. There is very high confidence in projections that average, maxi-
mum and minimum temperatures will continue to increase to the end of the century. 
Average annual temperature and average maximum and minimum temperatures 
across central Australia are projected to increase by 0.6–1.4 °C by 2030 under inter-
mediate- and high-emission scenarios, compared with average conditions from 
1986 to 2005. We can gain some appreciation of the significance of these changes 
from comparison with the change in temperature already observed. Mean annual 
temperature has increased by about 1 °C over the past 100 years, while the middle 
of the range for intermediate emissions is 1 °C by 2030. That represents a fivefold 
increase in the rate of warming (i.e. 0.1 °C per decade since 1910 compared with 
0.5 °C per decade to 2030) (Foster 2018).
We dedicate this book to the memory of Alan Louey Yen (1950–2017). After 
completing his PhD at LaTrobe University and a postdoctoral research post at 
Monash University, he joined the National Museum of Victoria (now Museums 
Victoria) in 1981 where he served as Curator of Invertebrate Survey for two decades. 
Alan then held a joint appointment with the Victorian Department of Economic 
Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources at AgriBio and La Trobe University in 
Melbourne, holding the position of Research Leader for Invertebrate Sciences. 
Alan’s research focussed on insects and other terrestrial invertebrates, especially 
regarding their conservation and biosecurity (Yen 2015). He was also passionate on 
humans using insects as a food resource (Yen 2012). He published several books 
and peer-reviewed papers and made a contribution to the chapter on terrestrial inver-
tebrates in this volume (Majer et al. 2018). We will sorely miss his humour, wit and 
unpretentious attitude to life.

Seeing Red: Some Aspects 
of the Geological and Climatic History 
of the Australian Arid Zone
Brad J. Pillans
Introduction
“Old, flat and red” is how the Australian landscape has been described by Pain et al. 
(2012). In this chapter, I will focus on the last of these three descriptors – red – in 
the context of the geological and climatic history of the Australian arid zone. This 
narrative of redness is not a standard geological history, describing events in each 
geological period. Rather, it seeks to examine the major boundary conditions or 
controls on the evolution of the Australian arid zone and some of its defining fea-
tures. Of necessity, this requires reference to events that occurred millions, and 
sometimes billions of years ago, and to refer to periods of time that are named as 
part of the international geological timescale (see Fig. 1).
Let’s start with “old”. As I have previously pointed out (Pillans 2007), based on 
palaeogeographic reconstructions, parts of the Australian continent may have been 
subaerially exposed for hundreds of millions of years (Fig. 2). A similar conclusion 
had been reached almost 100 hundred years earlier, by Jutson (1914, p.92), when he 
stated that “the land surface of Western Australia is one of the oldest land surfaces 
on the globe, and that it has not been below the sea for many geological ages”. In 
contrast, for much of the twentieth century, the prevailing view of many northern 
hemisphere geomorphologists was that little of the Earth’s topography was older 
than the Cenozoic and most was no older than Pleistocene (e.g. Thornbury 1954). 
Such a view was based on the conclusion that ongoing erosional processes ensure 
the destruction of ancient landforms, perhaps unsurprising given that large areas of 
the Northern Hemisphere had been overrun and reshaped by Pleistocene ice sheets 
and glaciers. In contrast, mainland Australia was little affected by Pleistocene gla-
ciation, except for a small area around Mt. Kosciuszko (Barrows et al. 2001). Thus, 
we might expect ancient landforms to be preserved in Australia.

Now we turn to “flat”. Australia is the flattest and lowest continent, with an 
­average elevation of only 325 m (Pain et al. 2012). Overall, the continent is bowl-­
shaped – low in the centre (as low as −16 m elevation in Lake Eyre) and high around 
the edges (up to 2228 m on Mt. Kosciuszko) – a function of having three rifted pas-
sive margins (west, south and east coasts) and being located in the centre of a litho-
spheric plate, remote from active plate margins. The Australian plate is moving 
north at a rate of 6–7 cm year−1 (fingernails grow at about the same rate!), and tilting 
downwards to the north, perhaps by as much as 300 m since the Miocene (Sandiford 
2007) – not enough to have a major effect on the flatness of the continent. With no 
major orogenic events in the last 250 million years, coupled with low rates of long-­
term erosion, flatness has been perpetuated!
Then there is “red”, which will be the major narrative thread of this chapter. The 
Australian arid zone or major parts thereof are variously referred to as the “The Red 
Centre”, “The Outback”, “Central Australia”, “The Back of Bourke”, etc. The town 
of Alice Springs is close to the centre of Australia, regardless of how it is measured 
[there are several ways, including calculating the centre of gravity of Australia’s 
irregular continental shape or measuring the maximum distance from the sea]. The 
area stretching some 250 km west and south of Alice Springs to Uluru is usually 
described as the Red Centre in tourist information brochures and includes iconic red 
landforms such as Uluru, Kata Tjuta, the West MacDonnell Ranges and Kings 
Canyon. However, equally iconic red landforms are much more widespread, includ-

ing the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert and the gorges of Karijini National Park 
in Western Australia.
Why is the central core of Australia red? The red colour primarily comes from 
the iron oxide hematite (Fe2O3), formed by the oxidation of ferrous (Fe2+) iron. The 
Red Centre is broadly encompassed by the modern-day 500 mm mean annual rain-
fall isohyet (Fig. 3), suggesting that redness is related to aridity. However, as we will 
see, aridity came late to Central Australia, and some of the red pigmentation was 
formed, by weathering, at much earlier times when the climate was significantly 
wetter than present (Pain et al. 2012). The history of atmospheric oxygen is also an 
important factor influencing the red colours that occur in rocks, soils and sediments 
of Central Australia, and this will be discussed to highlight the long history of 
“redness”.
Modern Setting
Byrne et al. (2008) defined the Australian arid zone as the region of Australia having 
a moisture index of less than 0.4 (mean annual rainfall divided by evaporation). 
With an area comprising some 40% of the Australian continent, it is one of the

largest deserts in the world. The Australian arid zone stretches from the northwest 
coast of Western Australia, through the southern half of the Northern Territory and 
northern and central South Australia, to western New South Wales and Queensland 
in the east (Fig. 4).
Jennings and Mabbutt (1967) recognised three major physiographic regions in 
Australia – the Eastern Uplands, Interior Lowlands and Western Plateau, the latter 
two of which include the Australian arid zone. These regions are well expressed in 
the digital elevation model (DEM) shown in Fig. 4. They are also broadly coincident 
with the three major geological subdivisions of Australia – the eastern fold belts, 
central basins and western shields.
The geological history of the Australian arid zone is both long and complex, with 
many different kinds of rocks being represented in the modern landscape. The west-
ern and northern parts are dominated by Archean and Proterozoic igneous and meta-
morphic rocks, while the eastern and southern parts are dominated by Mesozoic and 
Cenozoic sedimentary rocks (Fig. 5).
A striking feature of the Australian continent, which sets it apart from all other 
continents, is the large percentage of its land surface that is internally draining, i.e. 
drainage basins with no outlet to the sea (Fig. 6). The Lake Eyre Basin is the largest

of these, comprising about 1.2 million km2 or some 16% of the continent. Only on 
the western margin of the Australian arid zone do rivers reach the coast today, and 
most of these only do so seasonally. In contrast, in the early Cenozoic, large 
southward-­flowing rivers drained into the Great Australian Bight and westwards to 
the west coast of Western Australia (Hou et al. 2008; Bell et al. 2012), so internal 
drainage came late in our geological history, a consequence of increasing aridity 
(the rivers dried up) and northward tilting (rivers don’t flow uphill).
The red colour of the Australian arid zone which is clearly seen in satellite imag-
ery (Fig. 7) comes from the regolith. The term “regolith” describes the weathered 
skin of the Earth’s crust – everything from fresh air to fresh rock – including what 
we refer to as soil. Australian regolith, particularly in the Australian arid zone, is 
often described as old, highly weathered and nutrient-poor (McKenzie et al. 2004), 
all the result of the long history of subaerial exposure to weathering processes that 
have acted in a low-relief landscape. In large open pit mines, the depth to fresh rock 
may be more than 100 m, and the red colour of surface regolith can be seen to 
extend many metres below the present ground surface (Fig. 8).

Two major categories of regolith can be recognised:
	1.	 Transported regolith includes detrital (fragmented) and dissolved materials that 
have been carried varying distances from their source, including by water, wind, 
ice and gravity. Typical deposits include sand dunes, river and lake sediments. 
Linear sand dunes, salt lakes, ephemeral streams and stony plateaus characterise 
much of the Australian arid zone (Fig. 9)
	2.	 In situ regolith forms by weathering of the rocks immediately beneath – the 
material that remains in place after losses from weathering and erosional trans-
port. The deeply weathered rocks that are exposed in mine pits are in situ rego-
lith, called saprolite. Sometimes, when deep saprolite is eroded, residual masses 
of less weathered and more resistant rock remain – the Devil’s Marbles near 
Tennant Creek are residual granite corestones formed in this way (Fig. 10).
Wilford (2012) developed a weathering intensity index across the Australian 
continent, at a 100 m resolution, based on regression models of airborne gamma-ray 
spectrometry imagery and elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography 
Mission (SRTM) – see Fig. 11. Intensely weathered regolith is typical of landscapes 
that have been exposed to weathering for long periods of time which is particularly

true of many low-relief regions in Central Australia. In these areas, intensely weath-
ered regolith is characterised by residual elements such as Fe and Al (ferricretes and 
bauxitic profiles, respectively), often occurring as erosion-resistant caps on mesas, 
such as at Balgo in the far north of Western Australia (Fig. 12). In contrast, in higher-­
relief areas, erosion rates are faster, and both the depth and intensity of bedrock 
weathering are lower, although regolith redness can persist (e.g. Pilbara region).
Measuring Redness
The measurement and significance of redness has been the subject of much research 
(and debate) in the earth sciences. There are two main ways of measuring regolith 
colour, either qualitatively, by visual comparison with standard colour charts (e.g. 
Fig. 7  Composite cloud-free Landsat 8 satellite image with bands 4, 3, 2 (RGB), showing reddish 
surface colours dominating Central Australia. (Source – NASA: Geoscience Australia, courtesy of

Munsell Color Company 1975), or by quantitatively measuring spectral reflectance 
(Bullard and White 2002; Viscarra Rossel et al. 2006).
The redness of regolith is largely a function of iron oxide mineralogy, which var-
ies with environmental conditions such as pH, Eh, temperature and moisture. In 
particular, red colours are associated with hematite. Viscarra Rossel et al. (2010) 
measured the reflectance spectra of more than 4000 surface soil samples from across 
Australia to generate RGB true colours that could be converted to Munsell param-
eters of hue, value and chroma (spectral colour, lightness and brightness, respec-
tively). Mapped according to hue, Fig. 13 shows that the Australian arid zone is 
indeed dominated by “red” hues.
Actually, not all hematite looks red – coarsely crystalline hematite is often a 
dark-grey metallic colour. Geologists have long used what is called the “streak test” 
to distinguish hematite from other, similar looking minerals which involves scratch-
ing a white, unglazed porcelain surface – the resulting powder scratch or streak is 
characteristically red for hematite, suggesting that, in part, the red colour is depen-
dent on the presence of fine particles, which the streak test creates. Similar links 
between fine-grained (<2 μm) hematite and its red colour have been noted in a range 
of geological studies (e.g. McBride 1974; Walker 1979; Morris et al. 1985; Blodgett 
1988). Laboratory studies have also demonstrated a link between magnetic proper-
ties and redness (Morris et al. 1985; Rossman 1996).

Atmospheric Oxygen
Formation of red-pigmenting hematite requires free oxygen, the primary source of 
which is photosynthesis. Oxygen forms some 21% of the modern atmosphere, but 
for much of Earth history, it was very much lower – low enough to inhibit oxidation 
of Fe to form hematite (Fig. 14).
Atmospheric oxygen levels during the Archean (4–2.5 billion years ago) were 
extremely low, probably less than 0.001% of the present atmospheric level, as evi-
denced by the widespread occurrence of redox-sensitive detrital siderite (FeCO3), 
pyrite (Fe2S) and uraninite (UO2) in Archean sediments (Catling and Claire 2005). 
In Archean fluvial sediments from the Pilbara region in Western Australia, these 
detrital minerals show evidence of rounding consistent with prolonged transport in 
well-aerated waters and with very low atmospheric oxygen concentrations 
(Rasmussen and Buick 1999). Such minerals are very rare to absent in modern river 
sediments, because modern atmospheric oxygen levels ensure their complete oxida-
tive destruction.

Between 2.4 and 2.1 billion years ago, atmospheric oxygen appears to have 
increased dramatically – usually referred to as the Great Oxygenation Event. Red 
weathered sediments (red beds) appear in the geological record, detrital pyrite dis-
appears, and atmospheric oxygen probably rose to around 1–3% of the present 
atmospheric level (Catling and Claire 2005). The Great Oxygenation Event could 
have been a response to emergence and proliferation of photosynthetic organisms, 
the earliest of which were probably cyanobacteria. However, fossil evidence sug-
gests that cyanobacteria may have arisen before 3.5 billion years ago, perhaps as 
early as 3.7 billion years ago (Nutman et al. 2016), so why the billion-year delay to 
the Great Oxygenation Event? Opinions vary, but it may have been a balance 
between oxygen sources and oxygen sinks (e.g. carbon, sulphur and iron com-
pounds) that took time to overcome (Lyons et al. 2014).
During the Proterozoic, atmospheric oxygen likely remained well below modern 
levels, until it increased to approximately modern levels about 600 million years 
ago, coeval with the rise of animals (Canfield et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2015; Brocks 
et al. 2017). Subsequently, atmospheric oxygen has fluctuated between about 0.75 
and 1.75 of the present atmospheric level (between 15% and 35% oxygen in the 
atmosphere, respectively), which is the so called “fire window”, constrained by the 
occurrence of fossil charcoal since the latest Silurian, 419 million years ago 
(Glasspool and Scott 2010).

Early History (Precambrian)
Some of the oldest rocks on Earth occur in Western Australia, including the world’s 
oldest known minerals – zircons dated to 4.4 billion years (Valley et al. 2014). 
Indeed, large areas of Western Australia comprise rocks from 4 to 2.5 billion years 
old, belonging to the Archean Eon (Fig. 1). Evidence of some of the earliest life 
forms also comes from these rocks – laminated carbonate structures known as stro-
matolites (e.g. Hofmann et al. 1999; Allwood et al. 2006). Although there has been 
a long debate about whether Archean stromatolites are of microbial (biogenic) ori-
gin or whether they are abiogenic, Allwood et al. (2006) have demonstrated that 
stromatolites in the 3.43 billion-year-old Strelley Pool Chert in the Pilbara region 
are “most plausibly interpreted” as microbially formed structures – very similar to 
living examples in Shark Bay, Western Australia, today. Stromatolites are aptly 
described as “living fossils”, because they were known from the fossil record before 
living examples were recognised, for the first time, in Shark Bay in 1954 (Playford 
et al. 2013).
Spectacular banded red rocks, of similar antiquity to the Strelley Pool Chert, 
occur as a prominent rock bar across the Coongan River at Marble Bar, in Western 
Australia (Fig. 15). The rock bar gave its name to the nearby town of Marble Bar, 
but, despite the name, the rock is not marble, it is a type of jasper or chert. The 
Marble Bar Chert consists of alternating layers of silica and hematite, interpreted by

Hoashi et al. (2009) to have been deposited in partly oxygenated ocean water 3.46 
billion years ago. They suggested that the hematite crystals formed from hydrother-
mal fluids, rich in ferrous iron, at temperatures greater than 60 °C. According to 
Hoashi et al. (2009), the hematite is detrital, meaning that it was deposited as sedi-
mentary particles, not formed by post-depositional weathering – in other words, it 
was red from the start. If correct, this represents the oldest known occurrence of red 
rocks in Australia, and probably the world. Subsequently, Rasmussen et al. (2014a) 
undertook a detailed petrographic study of the Marble Bar Chert and concluded that 
the hematite was not primary, but rather it formed after sediment deposition. Key 
observations supporting a secondary origin of the hematite included the presence of 
magnetite cores in some hematite grains, lateral transitions in mineralogy within 
individual sediment layers and the occurrence of hematite in fractures and veins. In 
contrast, Hoashi et al. (2009) observed hematite crystals in the cores of many mag-
netite crystals, but not on the outside, indicating that the magnetite formed later than 
the hematite. Perhaps some of the hematite is primary, and there was a whiff of 
oxygen 3.46 billion years ago!
The spectacular red gorges of Karijini National Park (Fig. 16), in the Pilbara 
region of Western Australia, are cut through red rocks including Banded Iron 
Formations (BIFs) – sedimentary rocks comprising alternating layers of iron-rich 
and silica-rich minerals that were deposited from anoxic, iron-rich sea water during 
the Archean. With the rise of atmospheric oxygen around 2.4 billion years ago, 
ocean waters became more oxygenated, and Banded Iron Formations became much

less common (Rasmussen et al. 2012). However, like the Marble Bar Chert, the 
Banded Iron Formations contain significant amounts of hematite which is inconsis-
tent with formation in an anoxic environment. Rasmussen et al. (2014b) concluded 
that the hematite was formed as a secondary mineral after deposition of the BIFs, 
perhaps as a distal signature of the processes that formed the giant iron ore deposits 
in the Pilbara – which involved hematite replacement in unmineralised Banded Iron 
Formations, via deep infiltration of oxygenated meteoric fluids.
Palaeomagnetic studies of Banded Iron Formations and associated sediments 
(Schmidt and Clark 1994; Abrajevitch et al. 2014; Schmidt and Williams 2017) 
indicate several episodes of iron mineralisation, from the Paleoproterozoic through 
to the Cenozoic. Multiple episodes of hematite formation are also confirmed by U/
Pb dating of xenotime (YPO4) and monazite (CePO4) that formed concurrently with 
the hematite (Rasmussen et al. 2007; Sheppard et al. 2017). Thus, if the hematite in 
Banded Iron Formations came later, they were not red from birth but acquired their 
red colouration at various times subsequent to the Great Oxygenation Event.
Burrup Peninsula, near Karratha, is a landscape dominated by red boulder-­
covered ridges and rocky hills (Fig. 17a). It is also home to the world’s largest gal-
lery of rock art (Bird and Hallam 2006). The rocks are mostly Archean granophyre 
(2.7 billion years old), and while the red colour would appear to be pervasive, it is 
actually only “skin deep”. Broken rocks reveal an outer weathered zone, no more 
than about 1 cm thick (called a weathering rind), which contains the red colour, 
whereas the interior is a dark grey colour (Fig. 17b). Many rock surfaces also have 
a thin layer of ferruginous rock varnish, overlying the weathering rind. How long 
the rocks have been red is uncertain, but clearly not from birth. Long-term surface

erosion rates, as measured by cosmogenic nuclides, are in the range 0.15–1 mm per 
1000 years (Brad and Keith Fifield 2013), which would remove a 1-cm-thick weath-
ering rind in less than 60,000 years, so the red colour that we see today must be 
younger than that. Of course, chemical weathering processes continue to act on the 
rock surfaces and a balance is reached between surface erosion and inwards move-
ment of the weathering front. Just how many centimetres of weathering have been 
removed in this way is unknown, so we cannot really say how long the rocks have 
looked red on the Burrup.
Summary: From the three examples above, we can conclude that while the rocks 
are very old (2.5–3.5 billion years), much of their red colour has likely been acquired 
at various times since the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4–2.1 billion years ago.
Middle History (Palaeozoic and Mesozoic)
Uluru, a 348-m-high inselberg (Fig. 18) and one of the most famous landforms in 
Australia, lies close to the centre of the Australian arid zone. It is a massive outcrop 
of red sandstone of latest Proterozoic to earliest Cambrian age – 550–540 million 
years (Sweet et al. 2012). Some 30 km west of Uluru is Kata Tjuta (Fig. 19), an 
equally impressive outcrop of red conglomerate of similar age to Uluru. The sand-
stone and conglomerate were originally deposited as alluvium by rivers that drained

from rapidly eroding mountains in the area of the modern-day Petermann Ranges. 
The sandstone is rich in feldspar, and is called an arkose sandstone, but this is not 
why Uluru is red. As with the older rocks, described above, the red colour comes 
from iron oxides that were formed much more recently. Just how recently is open to 
conjecture. Beneath the sand plain between Uluru and Kata Tjuta, there are sedi-
ments containing fossil spores and pollen of Late Cretaceous age (Harris and 
Twidale 1991). Thus, by the late Cretaceous, Uluru and Kata Tjuta must already 
have been high points in the landscape, though ongoing weathering and erosion has 
changed their size and shape since that time. The red colour of Uluru and Kata Tjuta 
is a surface weathering feature, much like the rocks on Burrup Peninsula (see 
above). Within caves around the base of Uluru, fresh rock (of grey colour) is 
exposed. Similarly, exposures at Kata Tjuta reveal that the unweathered conglomer-
ate is a pale colour.
Kings Canyon (Fig. 20), some 300 km southwest of Alice Springs, is a spectacu-
lar 100-m-deep gorge, cut through red weathered Palaeozoic sediments within the 
Amadeus Basin (Bagas 1988). The upper gorge walls are formed of Mereenie 
Sandstone, deposited in shallow marine conditions sometime during the Silurian to 
Devonian Periods (the age is uncertain). Like Uluru, the red colour is a surface 
weathering feature, much of which must have been acquired after the gorge was 
cut – iron oxides coat the surface but the unweathered sandstone is pale coloured.

During the late Carboniferous and Early Permian (c. 320–280 million years ago), 
Australia was part of the Gondwana supercontinent, which also included India, 
Africa, South America, New Zealand and Antarctica. Gondwana was situated at 
high southern latitudes, and much of the continent was affected by glaciation. 
Indeed, a large continental ice sheet, several kilometres thick, may have covered the 
Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia (Crowell and Frakes 1971). Along the eastern 
margin of the Yilgarn Craton, there are glacial landforms and sediments consistent 
with glacial meltwater discharge eastwards into the Officer Basin (Eyles and de 
Broekert 2001). At Lancefield, glacial till is red weathered and yields a palaeomag-
netic pole consistent with oxidation during the Late Carboniferous. This was also a 
period of increased atmospheric oxygen, perhaps 50% higher than present (Berner 
et al. 2003). Thus, the combination of deep regolith oxidation and extensive ice 
sheets may have no modern analogue (Pillans 2007).
During the Cretaceous Period, much of Central Australia was flooded by a series 
of marine transgressions, the most extensive of which (between 120 and 110 million 
years ago) covered some 40% of the Australian continent (Frakes et al. 1987). The 
sediments that were deposited during that time have undergone little subsequent 
deformation and remain relatively flat-lying to this day, producing a characteristic 
landscape dominated by extensive plains and low plateaus (Fig. 21). Although the 
Cretaceous is generally regarded as a period of extended global warmth, the 
Australian continent lay at high southern latitudes, and the world’s only known 
Cretaceous glacial deposits are recorded at the northern end of the Flinders Ranges 
(Alley and Frakes 2003). There are also glacially rafted dropstones in Cretaceous 
marine sediments in the southern Eromanga Basin. Much of the area covered by 
Cretaceous seas in the eastern Australian arid zone is in the area now known as the

this area, likely formed by acidic oxidative weathering during the period 100–60

From Greenhouse to Icehouse in the Cenozoic
Major river systems characterised the Australian arid zone in the Cenozoic, pre-
served as large interconnected paleovalleys that are buried beneath the modern arid 
landscape (Fig. 22). These paleovalley systems, which are important groundwater 
aquifers today, formed under a humid temperate climate, with higher rainfall, lower 
evaporation and a temperate rainforest vegetation (English et al. 2012).

To understand the dramatic change from humid to arid climate in Central 
Australia during the Cenozoic, we need to look at global climatic changes – in par-
ticular the build-up of the Antarctic ice sheet since the Oligocene (Fig. 23). From 
about 55 million years ago, the Southern Ocean began forming as Australia sepa-
rated from Antarctica and the Australian continent has moved some 30 degrees 
north since that time. With opening of the Tasmanian Gateway, which connects the 
Indian and Pacific Oceans, and the opening of Drake Passage between the Atlantic 
and Pacific Oceans, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current was established around 30 
million years ago (Lawver and Gahagan 2003; Lagabrielle et al. 2009; Scher et al. 
2015). Onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current thermally isolated Antarctica, 
preparing the way for growth of the Antarctic ice sheet (Zachos et al. 2001, 2008). 
It was also associated with major changes in the global ocean circulation system and 
may have contributed to subsequent lower levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide 
(Scher et al. 2015).
During the Palaeocene and Eocene Epochs (65–35 million years ago), Earth was 
essentially ice-free, with global warmth reaching a peak around 50–55 million years 
ago (Early Eocene Climatic Optimum). Atmospheric CO2 was probably signifi-
cantly higher than today (Zachos et al. 2008). Warm to cool temperate rainforest 
covered much of Australia (Martin 2006), including Nothofagus (southern beech), 
which is today restricted to high-rainfall areas in southeast Australia, New Zealand, 
New Caledonia, New Guinea and southern South America. Near-tropical warmth 
was experienced in Tasmania, with mangrove palms (Nypa) growing at 65 °S (Pole 
and Macphail 1996; Carpenter et al. 2012). The spectacular paleovalley systems 
(Fig. 22) were active, with major rivers feeding water and sediment to the Eucla 
Basin, where massive coastal sand barriers formed, during the middle Eocene (38–
34 million years ago), containing heavy mineral deposits that are mined today (Hou

et  al. 2008). Palaeomagnetic dating indicates that extensive deep weathering of 
regolith also occurred in the Palaeocene, including mobilisation of Fe to form fer-
ricretes (Idnurm and Senior 1978; Smith et al. 2009).
Middle Eocene pollen and macrofossil assemblages from the southern Lake Eyre 
Basin (Alley et al. 1996; Greenwood 1996) indicate a dominance of Casuarinaceae 
(Casuarina and Gymnostoma), rather than Nothofagus, but including some taxa 
with monsoon forest affinities. The evidence suggests a mosaic of riverine rainfor-
ests and interfluve sclerophyllous plant communities, with seasonal rainfall. The 
macrofossils are preserved in silcrete (silica-cemented sediment), with silicification 
occurring soon after the plant remains were deposited. Further evidence of a signifi-
cant sclerophyll component in Eocene vegetation comes from paleovalleys in south-
ern Western Australia, including the diverse presence of members of the Proteaceae 
and Myrtaceae (Carpenter and Pole 1995; Carpenter et al. 2014; Mack and Milne 
2015).
Palaeoenvironmental evidence from the Oligocene Epoch (34–23 million years 
ago) is scarce in Central Australia. In the Lake Eyre Basin, the interval appears to 
have been one of prolonged weathering, erosion and silicification (Alley and Pledge 
2000). Vertebrate faunas preserved in the lowest part of the Etadunna Formation 
may be latest Oligocene in age, around 24–25 million years ago, based on magneto 
and biostratigraphy (Woodburne et  al. 1994), with ages adjusted to the latest 
Oligocene timescale (Gradstein et al. 2012). The faunas include numerous birds, 
including the giant flamingo, Phoeniconotius eyrensis, and many aquatic species 
(fish, crocodiles, turtles, and dolphins), indicating substantial permanent lakes. 
Fossils of terrestrial taxa also include browsing marsupials and arboreal animals 
(Woodburne et al. 1994; Alley and Pledge 2000).
Three other sites that have yielded silicified leaf fossils in Central Australia, 
Stuart Creek (northern South Australia), Glen Helen (Northern Territory) and 
Lightning Ridge (New South Wales), are poorly dated but likely to be late Oligocene 
to Miocene in age (Greenwood et al. 2001; Carpenter et al. 2011). The sites are 
significant, because they contain leaf impressions of banksias (Proteaceae), consis-
tent with drier climates than in the Eocene (but still significantly wetter than today). 
At two of the sites (Stuart Creek and Glen Helen), there are also taxa, which are 
closely comparable to extant Brachychiton and are broadly indicative of a seasonally-­
wet tropical to subtropical climate. Based on the floral assemblage at Stuart Creek, 
mean annual rainfall may have been around 1000 mm (Greenwood et al. 2001).
By the early to mid-Miocene (23–12 million years ago), regular flows in the 
paleovalley systems in Western Australia had ceased, and rainforest was probably 
restricted to small pockets (Martin 2006). Rainfall was still significantly higher than 
today, but the first major step towards aridity had been taken.
The period from 17 to 14 million years ago was globally the warmest part of the 
Neogene and is usually referred to as the Miocene Climatic Optimum (Fig. 23), 
with woody vegetation growing in Antarctica (Ashworth and Cantrill 2004). From 
around 14 million years ago, the Antarctic ice sheet expanded rapidly, with global 
cooling and drying in the Late Miocene eventually culminating in the Pleistocene 
ice ages. Recent U/Pb dating of spectacular fossil sites in the Riversleigh World

Heritage Area, in north Queensland (Woodhead et  al. 2016), provides a precise 
chronology for palaeoecological reconstructions in the range 18.2–13.5 million 
years ago (early to middle Miocene). The diverse faunal assemblages at Riversleigh 
are indicative of temperate lowland closed forest habitats in the early and middle 
Miocene, with more open forest habitat in the late Oligocene and late Miocene 
(Travouillon et al. 2009; Woodhead et al. 2016).
Ferricrete and silcrete are more resistant to erosion than most other regolith 
materials, and they therefore occur as cappings on mesas and plateaus throughout 
the Australian arid zone. A common type of ferricrete is Fe-cemented alluvial sedi-
ment, that originally formed in valley floors, but subsequent stream incision has 
lowered the surrounding landscape to create what is often termed “inverted relief” 
(Pain and Ollier 1995), resulting in alluvium in high parts of the landscape (Fig. 21). 
In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, a major source of iron ore is Channel Iron 
Deposits, which infill large meandering paleochannels, now preserved as inverted 
relief (Ramanaidou et al. 2003). The Channel Iron Deposits are typically composed 
of pedogenically derived pisoliths with hematite nuclei and goethite cortices, as 
well as abundant mineralised charcoal/wood fragments cemented by goethite-rich 
matrix (Morris and Ramanaidou 2007). Diffusion-corrected (U-Th)/He ages 
(Danisik et al. 2013) indicate the following mineral formation ages in the Yandi 
paleochannel:
	1.	 Formation of pisolith cores between 18.3 ± 3.5 and 14.3 ± 3.7 million years ago 
(Early to Middle Miocene)
	2.	 Formation of goethite cortex at 11.6 at 11.6 at 11.6 ± 3.0 million years ago (late 
Middle to early Late Miocene)
	3.	 Ferruginisation of wood fragments in the Channel Iron Deposits matrix 10–7 
million years ago (Late Miocene).
At another Channel Iron Deposits site (Lynn Peak), 40Ar/39Ar dating of authigenic 
Mn oxides and (U-Th)/He dating of associated goethite cement (Vasconcelos et al. 
2013) yield somewhat older ages than at Yandi, in the range 33–14 million years 
ago. Also, at Lynn Peak, dating of detrital MnO grains from the Channel Iron 
Deposits yields ages in the range 44–63 million years ago, indicating erosion from 
a pre-existing, intensely weathered landscape, and broadly similar to ages from a 
potential source weathering profile at Roy Hill (Vasconcelos et al. 2013). These 
combined results, from two Channel Iron Deposits, indicate a long and complex 
history of Channel Iron Deposit formation during the Oligocene and Miocene 
epochs.
Basal clays in the Yandi paleochannel have yielded an early Oligocene pollen 
flora (Macphail and Stone 2004) dominated by one or more of Casuarinaceae, 
Myrtaceae, Proteaceae, Nothofagus and Podocarpus/Prumnopitys and suggesting 
that the palaeovegetation included a mixture of dry forest and rainforest communi-
ties. Climate was significantly wetter than present but seasonally dry. The abun-
dance of fossil wood in Channel Iron Deposits suggests wildfires in well-wooded 
catchments (Morris and Ramanaidou 2007). Hydrogen isotope analyses of goethite

pisoliths, dated to 7 million years ago, imply that Late Miocene rainfall was derived 
mainly from summer season tropical cyclones (Yapp and Shuster 2017).
The Nullarbor Plain, on the southern margin of the Australian arid zone, became 
emergent from about 14 million years ago, partly in response to tectonic uplift and 
partly in response to a major sea-level fall associated with increased Antarctic ice 
(Miller et al. 2012). The middle Miocene Nullarbor Limestone forms the upper sur-
face of the plain and records a long and complex history of subaerial weathering. 
Pollen assemblages extracted from dated speleothems (cave deposits such as stalag-
mites and flowstones) provide a vegetation and climate record for the latest Miocene 
to mid-Pliocene (5.6–3.5 million years ago). The data show that from 5.6 to 5 mil-
lion years ago, the vegetation was a sparse shrubland or woodland; mean annual 
rainfall was around 480 mm, slightly higher than today (180–270 mm), indicating 
that a semiarid climate had already developed in the Nullarbor region by the latest 
Miocene. However, around 5 million years ago (earliest Pliocene), there was an 
abrupt change to forest vegetation (with Eucalyptus, Corymbia/Angophora, Banksia 
and Doryanthes), associated with an increase in rainfall to around 1200 mm, that 
persisted until 3.5 million years ago (Kale Sniderman et al. 2016). There is a gap in 
the speleothem pollen record after 3.5 million years, but by 400,000 years ago (mid-­
Pleistocene), rainfall had decreased to close to present levels, consistent with an 
arid-adapted fauna dated to between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago in Nullarbor 
caves (Prideaux et al. 2007). Similarly, evidence from the Adelaide region (Pillans 
and Bourman 2001) indicates a marked change from an oxide-dominated weather-
ing regime to the modern carbonate-dominated weathering regime around 500–
600,000  years ago, inferred to represent a major mid-Pleistocene arid shift in 
climate.
Geomorphic Evidence of Late Cenozoic Aridity in Central 
Australia
Direct evidence of aridity comes from four principal sources:
	1.	 Stony deserts. A common arid landform in Central Australia is stony desert sur-
faces (Figs. 9 and 24) composed of a layer of stones, commonly known as gibber. 
Many of the clasts are composed of silcrete, with a surface coating of rock var-
nish. They can occur as a lag deposit on rocky pavements, or as surface floaters 
on alluvium or aeolian silt (Mabbutt 1977). Unlike sand dunes, stony desert sur-
faces are less susceptible to erosion and are therefore more likely to persist as 
landscape features. Fujioka et al. (2005) used cosmogenic 21Ne-10Be exposure 
dating to show that stony desert surfaces in northern South Australia have ages 
in the range 2–4 million years, broadly coinciding with global cooling that led to 
the Quaternary ice ages. Stony deserts are very similar in appearance to some 
stony surfaces on Mars (Thomas et al. 2005; West et al. 2010).
Seeing Red: Some Aspects of the Geological and Climatic History of the Australian…

	2.	 Sand dunes. Aeolian dune building in Central Australia was presumably initiated 
in response to heightened aridity and devegetation of previously stable sand 
plains. The most widespread dunes are linear dunes, spectacularly visible on 
satellite imagery (Fig. 25). Cosmogenic nuclide burial dating indicates that the 
oldest dunes in the Simpson Desert began accumulating around 1 million years 
ago (Fujioka et al. 2009), significantly later than the development of stony des-
erts. Dunes in the Simpson Desert also contain palaeosols, indicating episodic 
dune building. Luminescence dating indicates that the two youngest major dune-­
building phases, broadly corresponded to the last two glacial periods.
	3.	 Salt lakes. Lakes in the Australian arid zone are typically saltwater discharge 
playas that hold water only intermittently. Stratigraphic drilling reveals a

31
­common pattern – that there was a major change from wetter to drier conditions 
in the early to mid-Pleistocene and that this change was time transgressive 
between about 1 million and 500,000 years ago. The critical chronologic marker 
is the last major reversal of the Earth’s magnetic field, dated to 0.78 million years 
(the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal). The earliest dated change from lacustrine to 
saline sediments occurred prior to the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal, around 1 
million years ago at Lake Amadeus (Chen and Barton 1991), whereas at nearby 
Lake Lewis the change occurred well after the Matuyama-Brunhes reversal, 
around 400,000 years ago (English et al. 2001). Similar changes are recorded at 
Lake Lefroy, in southern Western Australia (Zheng et al. 1998), and in palaeo-
Lake Bungunnia in the western Murray Basin (An et al. 1986). The differing 
times of lake drying are largely explained by the differing hydrologic thresholds 
of each lake basin (Bowler 1981). For example, Lake Amadeus has a much 
smaller catchment/lake area ratio than Lake Lewis and would therefore be 
expected to dry out earlier in response to intensifying aridity.
	4.	 Wind-blown dust (loess). Major dust storms can transport dust hundreds to thou-
sands of kilometres downwind from source areas within the Australian arid zone 
(Hesse 2003). Aeolian dust has been identified in sediment cores from the 
Tasman Sea (Hesse 1994) and shows that significant dust transport began around 
350,000 years ago, with highest dust fluxes during glacial periods. A similar pat-
tern is evident in sediment cores off northwest Western Australia extending back 
to 550,000 years (Stuut et al. 2014), consistent with relatively arid glacials and 
relatively humid interglacials.
In summary, the geomorphic evidence reveals that aridity progressively intensi-
fied during the last 4 million years, beginning with the initiation of stony deserts, 
followed by the development of salt lakes and sand dunes from about 1 million year 
ago and increasing dust transport from around 350,000 years ago.
Red colours are pervasive in these arid landforms and associated regolith. Folk 
(1976) studied red sands in the Simpson Desert (Fig. 26) and demonstrated that the 
red colour comes from a hematitic clay coating on the dominantly quartz sand 
grains. He concluded that the coating was the product of intense Pleistocene weath-
ering, enhanced by the passage of time as iron oxides dehydrate to form hematite. 
Wopfner and Twidale (1988) reached a similar conclusion, noting that dune redness 
tended to increase with distance from source. In contrast, Wasson (1983) concluded 
that reddening of dune sand in the Simpson and Strzelecki Deserts largely occurred 
prior to dune construction and that variation in dune sand colour was controlled by 
the colour of the sediment sources. Pell and Chivas (1995) found that most sand 
grains were poorly rounded and irregular in shape, with a predominance of chemi-
cally produced surface features, including grain coatings, leading them to conclude 
that the majority of dunes are currently stable, and that the sand has not been trans-
ported over long distances during its sedimentary history. Pell et al. (1999, 2000) 
also favoured derivation from local sources but showed, using zircon U/Pb ages, 
that the ultimate sources of local fluvial sediments were basement rocks hundreds 
of kilometres away. All researchers concur with Folk (1976) – the red colour was

derived from hematitic clay coatings on otherwise pale-coloured sand grains, 
acquired through a combination of in situ weathering and inheritance from local 
source rocks.
Drivers of Australian Aridity
The progressive aridification of Central Australia over the last 4 million years is 
plausibly linked to the growth of the Antarctic ice sheet, coupled with northwards 
movement of the Australian continent. Bowler (1982) constructed an elegant model 
of Australian aridification which recognised the changing latitudinal position of the 
subtropical highs relative to the Australian continent (Fig. 27). At the present time, 
the hot subtropical deserts in both hemispheres are largely controlled by subtropical 
high pressure cells centred about 30°north and south of the equator. Flohn (1973) 
showed that the position of the subtropical highs was controlled by the equator-pole 
temperature gradient (ΔT) – when ΔT is low, the subtropical highs are located at 
higher latitude, and when ΔT is high, the subtropical highs move closer to the equa-
tor. Thus, Bowler argued, during the Miocene, when the Antarctic ice cap was much 
smaller and ΔT was much lower than present, the subtropical highs may have been 
anchored around 50°S. Even allowing for the northwards movement of Australia, 
this would place the subtropical highs belt to the south of Australia, and the continent

would have been under a summer rainfall regime. As the Antarctic ice sheet grew, 
ΔT increased and the subtropical highs moved north, overtaking the Australian con-
tinent from the south (at a faster rate than the continent was moving north). An alter-
native scenario, which assumes that the subtropical highs remained at 30°S and that 
the continent drifted north into the subtropical highs zone, would mean that northern 
Australia would have become arid first – for which there is no evidence.
A second major control on aridity may come from gradual tectonic uplift of the 
so-called Maritime Continent (the islands of Indonesia and surrounding area), over 
the last 5 million years, as a consequence of crustal shortening associated with the 
northwards movement of the Australian tectonic plate (Molnar and Cronin 2015). 
Uplift of the Maritime Continent caused progressive constriction of warm surface 
currents (Indonesian Throughflow) from the western Pacific to the Indian Ocean, 
resulting in cooler surface ocean temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean, includ-
ing a weakened Leeuwin Current from around 3.3 million years ago (Karas et al. 
2011). Lower sea surface temperatures in turn lead to seasonally drier conditions in 
northwest Australia (Christensen et al. 2017).
A third major control on aridity is linked to global climate changes that are mod-
ulated by variations in Earth’s orbital parameters – eccentricity, obliquity and pre-
cession – which play a major role in driving glacial-interglacial climate changes on 
103–105 year timescales. In broad terms, in Australia, glacial periods are typically 
cold and arid, while interglacial periods are warm and wet. In northern Australia, the 
moisture balance is dominated by the Australian monsoon, which is a component of 
the Asian monsoon. Magee et al. (2004) reported a 150,000-year record of water 
level fluctuations in Lake Eyre, as a proxy for Australian monsoon intensity, and 
showed that, within the limits of dating uncertainties, wet phases correlated with 
Northern Hemisphere winter insolation minima. Furthermore, they showed that, 
despite similar, strong insolation forcing, lake levels in the Holocene were signifi-
cantly lower than those during the Last Interglacial, implying a failure of the 
Australian monsoon in the Holocene. Miller et  al. (2005, 2016) attributed this 
­failure to a major change in vegetation and hydrological boundary conditions, as a

consequence of regular Aboriginal burning and the extinction of the Australian 
megafauna from around 50,000 years ago (see also Johnson et al. 1999). Fu et al. 
(2017) extended the Lake Eyre record beyond 200,000 years and, with improved 
luminescence dating, concluded that insolation forcing was not the primary driver 
of long-term water levels in Lake Eyre and the strength of the Australian monsoon. 
Regardless of the underlying cause(s), the progressively decreasing water levels in 
Lake Eyre over the last 200,000 years are a clear indication of further, progressive 
aridification in Central Australia during that time.
Landscape Evolution
The survival of ancient landforms and regolith in Australia presents something of a 
paradox to geomorphologists. On the one hand, prolonged tectonic stability and 
slow rates of denudation in an arid environment are seen as promoting their preser-
vation. On the other hand, while measured rates of long-term weathering and ero-
sion in Australia are low by world standards (Bierman and Caffee 2002; Heimsath 
et al. 2010), they are not low enough to explain the survival of pre-Cenozoic land-
forms and regolith at or near the surface. Even at rates of 1 m per million years, at 
least 100 m would be stripped from surfaces formed more than 100 million years 
ago – sufficient to ensure their complete destruction.
A powerful technique for measuring long-term denudation on timescales of mil-
lions of years is apatite fission-track thermochronology. The technique utilises the 
linear damage zones (called fission tracks) caused by spontaneous fission of trace 
amounts of radioactive 238U nuclei in the crystal lattice of apatite (chemical for-
mula Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH)). The number of fission tracks preserved in an apatite 
crystal depends on the U concentration, elapsed time and temperature and can be 
used to constrain the thermal (burial) history of a rock and hence its denudation 
history. Kohn et al. (2002) compiled apatite fission-track data to demonstrate that 
kilometre-­scale denudation had occurred across much of Australia over the last 
250 million years (Fig. 28), with an average continent-wide denudation rate of 
~10 m per million years. At such average rates, preservation of ancient regolith and 
landforms would seem to be impossible and would certainly preclude the survival 
of Cambrian river terraces as persisting near-surface landforms, as claimed by 
Stewart et al. (1986).
A solution to the paradox of ancient landform survival, in the face of ongoing 
erosional destruction, is burial and exhumation (Kohn et  al. 2002; Belton et  al. 
2004; Pillans 2007). Nowhere is this more clearly evidenced than with the Western 
Australian Shield, where remnants of late Carboniferous to early Permian regolith 
and landforms are widely preserved (Eyles and de Broekert 2001). Weber et al. 
(2005) derived a model, based on apatite fission-track and geological data, the key 
elements of which were surface exposure and weathering during the late 
Carboniferous, followed by rapid burial by up to ~3 km of Permian sediments and 
then slow exhumation until re-exposure in the late Cretaceous (Fig. 29).
B. J. Pillans

35
However, while burial and exhumation may be necessary to explain the survival 
of pre-Cenozoic landforms and regolith, it does not need to be invoked to explain 
the survival of Cenozoic features in the modern landscape. As discussed by Twidale 
(1976), factors that favour the survival of ancient features include resistant rocks 
(and regolith), low rainfall and tectonic stability. Furthermore, erosion can be quite 
localised, allowing the preservation of ancient features in certain parts of the land-
scape, for example, as relict upland surfaces remote from incising rivers. In the 
Australian arid zone, plateaus and mesas, capped by resistant silcrete or ferricrete, 
are typical end products of this process (Figs. 12 and 21). Clearly, the progressive 
aridification of Central Australia in the late Cenozoic has aided such preservation.
Aridity and Redness in Central Australia: Some Concluding 
Remarks
The progressive development of the Australian arid zone has its origins in the 
breakup and dispersal of the continental blocks that comprised the great southern 
continent of Gondwana – India, South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia and 
Zealandia (Mortimer et al. 2017). Separation of Australia from Antarctica, to enable

establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the late Oligocene, around 30 
million years ago, reinforced the thermal isolation of Antarctica, promoting the 
growth of the Antarctic ice sheet, eventually leading to establishment of the modern 
ocean and atmosphere circulation patterns. The simultaneous northwards drift of the 
Australian continent and growth of the Antarctic ice sheet led to gradual juxtaposi-
tion of Central Australia with the belt of subtropical high pressure systems and 
intensifying aridity.
While palaeobotanical evidence suggests seasonal dryness from the Eocene 
onwards, the first truly arid landscapes, the stony deserts, did not develop until the 
Pliocene, some 3–4 million years ago (Fujioka et al. 2005), while sandy desert land-
forms came later, starting around 1 million years ago (Fujioka et al. 2009).
What then of Australia’s Red Centre? Red regolith, both in situ and transported, 
is widely characteristic of the Australian arid zone, suggesting a strong link between 
aridity and redness. This is certainly true of the red sand dunes that occur through-
out the Australian arid zone. However, the red pigment in regolith which comes 
from fine-grained hematite can be shown, in some cases, to predate aridity. Hematite 
acquires a stable magnetic remanence when it crystallises, and palaeomagnetic 
measurements indicate crystallisation ages that predate the formation of desert land-
forms by tens of millions, sometimes by hundreds of millions of years (e.g. Idnurm 
and Senior 1978; Smith et al. 2009; Abrajevitch et al. 2014; Schmidt and Williams 
2017). A strong boundary condition on the formation of red pigmentation in rocks

and regolith is atmospheric oxygen concentration, which has been at or above mod-
ern levels for the last ~600 million years. Even at very low atmospheric oxygen 
concentrations, the formation of hematite by oxidative weathering is feasible, and 
the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4–2.1 billion years ago, when atmospheric oxy-
gen was only 1–3% of modern, is widely viewed as allowing red pigmentation to 
form. Whether there were “whiffs” of oxygen much earlier remains contentious, but 
the red hematite layers in the 3.5 billion-year-old Marble Bar Chert are one possible 
example.

Introduction
Australia is a vast continent with a range of environments broadly differentiated 
into three major biomes. The best studied of these, the mesic biome, is confined to 
the eastern coast and the southeast and southwest corners and has pockets of ever-
wet rainforest along the east coast. The monsoon tropics biome occurs in the north-
ern part of the continent including Cape York Peninsula in the east, and the arid-zone 
biome covers the vast central and western parts of the continent, generally west of 
the Great Dividing Range. The arid zone is Australia’s largest biome, occupying 
approximately 70% of the entire continent (Fig. 1a) and broadly corresponding to 
the Eremaean and northern desert regions of the Australian Bioregionalisation Atlas 
(Ebach et  al. 2015) (Fig.  1b). It covers a range of environments such as sandy

deserts, gibber deserts and steppes, ranges and coastal plains and hosts a variety of 
vegetation types, shrub woodlands, acacia and mallee eucalypt shrublands, spinifex 
grasslands, tussock and hummock grasslands and chenopod shrublands. On aver-
age, the arid zone is only 300 m above sea level with low relief and a broad flat plain 
covering most of the central western area (Williams 1984; Pain et al. 2012; Pillans 
2018).
Although the arid zone covers a vast area of often inhospitable environments, the 
diversity of plants, animals, birds, reptiles and invertebrates that make up the biota 
of this biome is reasonably well understood (Barker and Greenslade 1982; Cogger 
and Cameron 1984; Cracraft 1986, 1991; Dawson and Dawson 2006; Schodde 
1982; Stafford Smith and Morton 1990). Assessments of species diversity have 
revealed greatest diversity in the reptiles and invertebrates; 43% of the continent’s 
reptiles and a similar proportion of termites and ants inhabit arid environments 
(Byrne et al. 2008), the majority of Australia’s 7500 ant species occurring in the arid 
zone (Andersen 2016). The diversity of other groups is less; only 15% of birds and 
10% of plant species are endemic to the arid zone (Barker and Greenslade 1982; 
Schodde 1982, 2006). Analysis of turnover of species from six groups of vascular 
plants and three groups of non-vascular plants identified major change in vegetation 
communities within the arid zone and specified nine phytogeographical subregions, 
the western, central and eastern deserts, the Pilbara and Great Sandy Desert inter-
zone, the Central Queensland area and the Nullarbor, Eyre Peninsula and Adelaide 
areas (Ebach et al. 2015).
The current arid zone is defined here as having a moisture index (mean annual 
rainfall divided by evaporation) of 0.4, annual rainfall that is generally below 
250 mm and unpredictable, and little seasonality (Stafford Smith and Morton 1990). 
Byrne et al. (2008) provided a detailed summary of the environmental history of 
arid Australia, based on a review of evidence from plant macro- and microfossils, 
sedimentology, fossil faunal assemblages, palaeodrainage, geomorphology and iso-
tope analyses. We provide a short contextual summary here and in Fig. 2.
The arid zone is considered to be younger than the mesic zone. This is because 
the rainforest vegetation of the Australian continent in the Eocene (55–35 million 
years ago) reflects far more mesic conditions historically than currently (Hill 1994; 
Schodde 2006). Geomorphological evidence indicates that the whole of Australia 
was warm and wet in the Early to Mid-Miocene (23–20 million years ago) (Alley 
and Lindsay 1995; Martin 2006). Progressive aridification of the Australian environ-
ment occurred from the Mid-Miocene (~20 million years ago), the first signs of 
aridity evident in cessation of regular flows in western palaeodrainage channels 
(Bowler et al. 2006). Pockets of arid environments may have been present in the 
current arid zone in the Mid-Miocene, but the stony and sandy desert environments 
did not fully develop until the Pliocene (6–2.8 million years ago) and Mid-­Pleistocene 
(~1 million years ago) respectively (Fujioka et al. 2009, 2005). The Nullarbor Plain, 
a large limestone plateau in the central southern region of Australia, was subject to 
marine inundation in the Mid-Miocene (~15 million years ago) (McGowran et al. 
2004), effectively separating the mesic environments of the southwest and southeast

(Crisp and Cook 2007). At this time, the sea level fell around Southern Australia, 
and the ocean’s incursions into the south-eastern marine basins retreated (Murray, 
Otway and Gippsland), leaving repeated shoreline ridges evident in the Murray 
Basin (Bowler et al. 2006).
As highlighted in an earlier review (Byrne et al. 2008), the environmental changes 
of the Late Miocene (10–6 million years ago) remain poorly understood. A major 
termination of the previous warm, wet environments and very high levels of erosion 
indicate destabilisation of vegetation cover. Fossil evidence shows that rainforest con-
tracted, and sclerophyllous taxa like Eucalyptus and Casuarina expanded, as did dry, 
open woodlands and chenopod shrublands (Martin 2006). Conditions in the Pliocene 
(6–2.6 million years ago) showed a temporary return of warmer, wetter conditions 
than those of the Late Miocene, but not to the extent of the Early Miocene (Sniderman 
et al. 2016). Depositional activity in the Pliocene is indicative of drier conditions 
(Bowler et al. 2006), and the vegetation comprised sclerophyllous forest and wood-
lands and development of shrublands and grasslands (Martin 2006; Sniderman et al. 
2007). Development of the first stony desert pavements in Central Australia occurred 
3–2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene (Fujioka et al. 2005).
The onset of the Pleistocene heralded the development of glacial and interglacial 
cycles of 20,000–40,000 years duration in the northern hemisphere (Williams et al. 
1998). In Australia, these were manifest as arid-mesic cycles. These climatic oscil-
lations became more intense, having major increases in amplitude and periodicity of 
100,000 years from the Mid-Pleistocene, concomitant with the development of the 
sandy deserts (Fujioka et al. 2009). The last 400,000 years saw major change in 
hydrological conditions, such as drying of inland lakes and widespread erosion and

wind-blown dust (Bowler et al. 1998; Revel-Rolland et al. 2006). Conditions at the 
Last Glacial Maximum (~25–15,000 years ago) were extremely arid. Sea level was 
~120 m lower than present, freshwater lakes dried out or became saline, streams 
showed large sand and gravel flows, mobile dune systems were activated, and large 
areas were treeless or devoid of vegetation (Williams 2000, 2001). Analysis of iso-
topes in emu eggshells shows evidence for a peak in aridity between 30,000 and 
15,000 years ago (Miller et al. 2016).
The environmental changes throughout the Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene 
led to development of the current arid zone and contraction of mesic environments 
to the southwest and southeast, eastern seaboard and northern areas of Australia 
(Byrne et al. 2011). These environmental changes must have had significant impact 
on the plants and animals inhabiting these areas, and they led to the evolution of the 
current arid-zone biota. Modern approaches to understanding the evolutionary his-
tory of these plants and animals complement a rich, earlier literature built on mor-
phological data. They are based on molecular genetic data and analysis of 
phylogenies and phylogeographic studies of the biota. Further, they are conducted 
in the context of historical climatic and geological events and so can reveal signifi-
cant, novel insights into the response of the biota to changing environmental condi-
tions. Byrne et al. (2008) reviewed the phylogenetic and phylogeographic evidence 
for the development of the arid-zone biota and found two broad phases of develop-
ment. First, there is evidence for diversification and radiation of lineages through 
the Miocene and Pliocene when arid environments were forming throughout Central 
Australia. Second, there was a phase of maintenance of species diversity through 
the Pleistocene, when extreme aridity occurred through cyclic climatic conditions. 
Here, we assess molecular analyses published since 2008 to test and explore the 
generality of these conclusions.
Origins and Diversification of the Arid-Zone Biota
In their review of the origins of the arid-zone biota, Byrne et al. (2008) found evi-
dence of both adaptive diversification in situ from ancestral forms present in Central 
Australia prior to the Miocene and for multiple independent divergences from 
mesic ancestors over time. Assessment of molecular phylogenies showed origin of 
arid lineages from mesic ancestors in plants and in animals (Fig. 3). A pattern of 
sister arid-mesic lineages showing divergence of arid lineages was present in plant 
phylogenies of Tetratheca (Crayn et  al. 2006), Calotis (Watanabe et  al. 2006), 
Lepidium (Mummenhoff et al. 2001) and Halosarcia (Shepherd et al. 2004) and in 
the agamid lizards (Hugall et  al. 2008), the Egernia whitii complex of skinks 
(Chapple and Keogh 2004), diving beetles, amphipods (Cooper et al. 2007; Leys 
et al. 2003; Rix and Harvey 2012; Schmidt and Walter 2014) and Artamus wood-
swallows (Joseph et al. 2006). More recent studies have found further evidence for 
this, as phylogenetic analysis of the large plant family Goodeniaceae suggests a 
most likely south-­western Australian origin, with the Goodenia clade diversifying

within the arid zone as it developed and the Dampiera/Lechenaultia clade diversi-
fying mainly in the southwest (Jabaily et al. 2014). Eucalypts diversified from the 
Early Miocene with south-western Australia resolving as the most ancestral area 
(Ladiges et al. 2011a). Area phylogenetic analysis in the plant genus Nicotiana 
shows older taxa in peripheral mesic areas and derived taxa in arid inland areas 
(Ladiges et  al. 2011b). Biogeographic and phylogenetic analysis of the Hakea 
shows multiple biome shifts, but the majority of arid diversification arises from 
mesic biomes, particularly south-­western Australia (Cardillo et al. 2017), and arid-
adapted species of Callitris have diversified from mesic ancestors (Larter et al. 
2017). Similar patterns have been observed in sawflies (Schmidt and Walter 2014), 
flightless weevils (Toussaint et al. 2015b), Delma geckoes (Brennan et al. 2016) 
and several birds such as the nectarivorous lorikeets and budgerigar (Schweizer 
et al. 2015; Wright et al. 2008), platycercine parrots (Schweizer et al. 2012), hon-
eyeaters (Joseph et  al. 2014), Cinclosoma quail-thrush (Toon et  al. 2012),

whipbirds and wedgebills (Toon et al. 2013) and malurid fairy wrens (Driskell et al. 
2011; Lee et al. 2012). Among marsupials, Mitchell et al. (2014) found a pattern of 
mesic-adapted lineages evolving to use more arid and open habitats that is broadly 
consistent with regional climate and environmental change. Additionally, several 
mammal groups, including Dasyuromorphia, Vombatiformes, Trichosurini and 
Peramelemorphia, appear to have made the transition to open environments prior to 
the onset of widespread Miocene aridification, possibly reflecting lineages that sur-
vived from drier periods in the Oligocene (34–23 million years ago) when limited 
open forest habitats may have been available (Kear et al. 2016; Travouillon et al. 
2009). Phylogenies show multiple radiations into the arid zone during the Miocene 
in the Pauropsalta complex of cicadas (Owen et al. 2017), the spiny trapdoor spi-
ders (Rix et al. 2017) and the Melophorus ants (Heterick et al. 2017). Phylogeny of 
the truffle-like fungi also shows radiation of arid-zone species from mesic ancestors 
(Sheedy et al. 2016). Evidence from multiple stygobiont invertebrates suggests that 
microallopatric speciation within individual calcretes is significant and that the 
fauna may total to almost 3,000 species (Guzik et al. 2009, 2011a, b). In contrast, 
some amphipods, isopods and copepods appear to have entered the underground 
environments through separate colonisation events (Bradford et al. 2010; Finston 
et al. 2009; Javidkar et al. 2016; Karanovic and Cooper 2012; King et al. 2012).
While many arid lineages are derived from mesic ancestors (e.g. Pepper and 
Keogh 2014), there is also evidence of divergence from tropical ancestors in the 
plant genera Gossypium (Liu et al. 2001; Seelanan et al. 1999) and Flindersia (Scott 
et al. 2000). More recent studies have identified similar divergence from tropical 
ancestors in the plant genus Atriplex (Kadereit et  al. 2010); in the frog genera 
Uperoleia (Catullo et al. 2011, 2014; Catullo and Keogh 2014), Platyplectrum and 
Litoria (Pyron and Wiens 2011) (Fig. 4); and in the Heteronotia, Diplodactylus, 
Oedura and Strophurus geckoes (Fujita et al. 2010; Oliver et al. 2016; Oliver and 
McDonald 2016; Laver et al. 2017).
Broad estimates of the relative timing of divergence events can be determined 
through molecular dating of phylogenies. In their review Byrne et al. (2008) found 
that in general, lineages that diversified in situ tended to occur at the genus and 
subgenus level and showed older diversification times during the Mid- to Late 
Miocene, e.g. Gossypium (Liu et al. 2001; Seelanan et al. 1999), Ctenophorus liz-
ards (Melville et al. 2001) and elapid snakes (Sanders et al. 2008). Similar patterns 
have been found more recently in the plant genera Triodia (Toon et  al. 2015), 
Atriplex (Kadereit et al. 2010), and Eucalyptus (Ladiges et al. 2011a) and the che-
nopods (Kadereit and Freitag 2011), in Uperoleia frogs (Catullo et al. 2011, 2014; 
Catullo and Keogh 2014) and in Diporiphora agamids (Edwards and Melville 2011; 
Smith et al. 2011) and Oedura geckoes (Oliver et al. 2014). While most arid species 
of Oedura geckoes diverged in the last 5 million years, an early diverging lineage 
over 10 million years was also recently identified (Oliver and McDonald 2016). The 
vacronini Tenebrionidae beetles of arid Australia have closest relatives in North 
America, originated in the Early Cretaceous (~145 million years ago), and may 
have inhabited coastal dune systems before the Australian arid biome developed 
(Kergoat et al. 2014; Matthews 2000). Warramaba grasshoppers diverged in the

Pliocene; northern sexual lineages persisted in local refugia in the Pleistocene, but 
parthenogenetic lineages expanded in the Pleistocene, suggesting that habitats 
became unsuitable in the north (Kearney and Blacket 2008).
While many phylogenies show patterns of divergence of major lineages as dis-
cussed above, Byrne et al. (2008) also found a second pattern of individual arid 
species or lineages present throughout phylogenies indicating multiple origins of 
arid species in the large plant genus Acacia (Ariati et al. 2006; Murphy et al. 2003), 
dasyurid marsupials (Crowther and Blacket 2003; Krajewski et al. 2000), the sphe-
nomorphine skinks (Rabosky et  al. 2007) and Neobatrachus frogs (Mable and 
Roberts 1997). This pattern has also been found more recently in the plant genera 
Dampiera and Lechenaultia (Jabaily et al. 2014), and Hakea and Grevillea (Mast 
et al. 2015; Cardillo et al. 2017), as well as in pseudoscorpions (Harrison et al. 
2014) and the Pauropsalta complex of cicadas (Owen et al. 2017). Among birds, the 
radiation of the iconic Australo-Pacific family of honeyeaters, Meliphagidae, neatly 
illustrates the independent evolution of several arid-zone genera in the Mid- to Late 
Miocene (20–6 million years ago). These include a number of monotypic genera of 
the arid and semiarid zones (Sugomel, Purnella, Certhionyx, Acanthagenys, 
Epthianura, Ashbyia, Grantiella, Plectorhyncha) (Joseph et al. 2014). In general, 
most groups show diversification of species or lineages in the Late Miocene to

Pliocene, e.g. Acacia (Ariati et al. 2006; Murphy et al. 2003), Hakea (Cardillo et al. 
2017) and the dasyurid marsupials (Krajewski et al. 2000), and there is less evi-
dence for species divergence in the Pleistocene. Byrne et al. (2008) only found three 
cases of Pleistocene speciation that had been documented, Australian species of 
Lepidium (Mummenhoff et al. 2004); the geographically restricted shrub, Acacia 
sciophanes (Byrne et al. 2001); and a number of gall-forming Kladothrips species 
associated with Acacia (McLeish et al. 2007). More recent studies have revealed 
more cases of Pleistocene speciation (Fig.  5). Ingham et  al. (2013) found that

species, diverged approximately 1.08 million years ago, much later than the diver-
gence of the south-western and south-eastern mesic species of the genus; and diver-
gence of two arid-zone species of Livistona from monsoon tropical congeners 
occurred in the Late Pleistocene (Crisp et al. 2010). Divergence among species in 
Nicotiana section Suaveolentes began 6 million years ago but accelerated in the 
Pleistocene from 2.6  million years ago (Clarkson et  al. 2017). Two species of 
Granulomen land snails are widespread in the arid zone and diverged in the Mid-­
Pleistocene (Criscione and Köhler 2016), and there is evidence of in situ speciation 
between river systems in the Pilbara Craton and the Gascoyne drainages in Uperoleia 
frogs (Catullo and Keogh 2014). Species within the Ctenophorus maculatus species 
complex further show rapid divergence throughout the Pleistocene, coincident with 
the diversification of sand plain and dune habitats (Edwards et al. 2015); similar 
sand habitat diversification has likely been involved in the diversification of other 
species-rich arid clades (e.g. Lerista (Lee et al. 2013)). Diversification of lineages 
of golden perch in upland basins from coastal areas is believed to represent specia-
tion during the Upper to Middle Pleistocene (Beheregaray et al. 2017).
The above examples illustrate diversification of arid lineages and species from 
mesic and tropical ancestors. So it is interesting to see that more recent work has 
revealed the converse of diversification of some species or lineages into mesic 
and tropical biomes from ancestral arid groups. Phylogenetic analysis of Triodia 
indicates that the arid zone is ancestral in this group, with multiple shifts and 
range expansion of species into the tropical savannah and into the southern mesic 
biomes during the Mid–Late Miocene and Pliocene (Toon et al. 2015). Similarly, 
diversification of mesic species is evident within the mainly arid plant genera 
Scaevola and Goodenia (Jabaily et al. 2014) and in the paper daisies Leucochrysum 
(Schmidt-­Lebuhn and Smith 2016). Derived mesic species from arid ancestors 
are evident within Ctenophorus lizards (McLean et al. 2013, 2014) and Strophurus 
geckoes (Nielsen et al. 2016). Analysis of pygopodoid geckoes shows diversifi-
cation of arid species along with some transition of species back to mesic biomes 
(Brennan and Oliver 2017). Area phylogenetic analysis led Ladiges et al. (2011b) 
to propose that Nicotiana section Suaveolentes had a widespread ancestral distri-
bution with diversification in the arid zone as aridification progressed from the 
Mid-Miocene, along with persistence in peripheral mesic areas. Nyari and Joseph 
(2012) identified instances in the acanthizid bird genus Gerygone, where ances-
try of tropical mangrove endemics may have involved arid-zone ancestors. In 
marsupials, some instances of lineages reverting from drier to more mesic habi-
tats are apparent in several clades and individual species of Macropodidae and 
Dasyuridae (Mitchell et  al. 2014). Several reptile groups confirm complex 
dynamic patterns between mesic, tropical and arid biomes, whereby all groups 
likely had a tropical or mesic ancestor, followed by derived arid lineages and 
then repeated recolonisation of mesic and tropical environments, including the 
lygosomine (Skinner et al. 2011) and Lerista (Lee et al. 2013; Skinner and Lee 
2009) skinks; carphodactyline (Oliver and Bauer 2011), diplodactine (Oliver 
et  al. 2009, 2010) and gekkotan (Sistrom et  al. 2009, 2014) geckoes; and 
Tympanocryptis (Shoo et al. 2008), Ctenophorus (Edwards et al. 2015; Melville 
M. Byrne et al.

55
et  al. 2016) and Lophognathus/Amphibolurus (Melville et  al. 2011) agamids. 
Mesic species of Pseudophryne frogs appear to have been derived from an arid 
lineage (Donnellan et al. 2012).
Analysis in the plant Nicotiana section Suaveolentes shows marked radiation 
into arid environments (Clarkson et al. 2017), and species differentiated into the 
northern desert before they did in the central desert, suggesting that aridification 
occurred earlier in the northern desert than in the central western and eastern deserts 
(Ladiges et al. 2011b). Biogeographical analysis of Acacia also indicates a break in 
species turnover between the northern and southern regions of the arid zone, corre-
sponding with the summer-winter rainfall divide (Gonzalez-Orozco et  al. 2013; 
Foster 2017).
Although rigorous analysis of diversification rate is not possible for most stud-
ies, evaluation of phylogenies shows diversification rates can be relatively constant 
such as in the salt lake-adapted tiger beetles over the past 4 Ma (Pons et al. 2006), 
or rates can differ by mediation through different ecological contexts. Comparison 
of diversification rates between arid lineages and their mesic sister lineages shows 
some cases of similar diversification rates, such as in the Egernia whitii group 
(Chapple and Keogh 2004), in the Pauropsalta complex of cicadas (Owen et al. 
2017) and in gall thrips (Kladothrips) that specialise on arid species of Acacia sec-
tion Juliflorae (McLeish et al. 2007), but increased diversification in arid lineages 
compared with mesic lineages in the plant genus Tetratheca (Crayn et al. 2006) and 
Nicotiana section Suaveolentes (Clarkson et al. 2017) and in the sphenomorphine 
skinks (Rabosky et al. 2007) and the pygopodoid geckoes (Brennan et al. 2016; 
Brennan and Oliver 2017). In contrast, a slower rate of diversification is evident in 
the arid lineage of Gossypium compared with its tropical sister lineage (Liu et al. 
2001; Seelanan et al. 1999). More recent analysis has found similar variation in 
rates and diversification in arid lineages having increased compared with mesic 
lineages in the plant genus Ptilotus (Hammer et al. 2015) and in the arid lineages 
of Strophurus geckoes compared to tropical sister lineages (Laver et al. 2017), but 
a slower rate in arid lineages of Scaevola compared with mesic lineages (Jabaily 
et al. 2014). Onstein et al. (2017) found a higher rate of diversification in open 
vegetation compared to the ancestral state of closed vegetation in Proteaceae, and 
Goldie et al. (2010) tested mutation rate in the internal transcribed spacer in mesic-
arid pairs of woody species and found higher substitution rates in the majority 
(76%) of mesic species. Lineage through time plots of the arid genus Triodia shows 
progressive increase in diversification rate from the Mid-Miocene, consistent with 
rapidly intensifying aridification, and then decreasing diversification in the 
Pliocene (Toon et al. 2015). Surface and subsurface sister lineages of diving bee-
tles show declining and variable diversification rates, respectively, related to the 
availability and distribution of their epigean and hypogean habitats (Toussaint 
et al. 2015a). Mesic lineages of allodapine bees experienced acceleration radiation 
during the Hill Gap (10–6 mya), but xeric groups did not (Chenoweth and Schwarz 
2011). The genus Pseudotetracha of nocturnal tiger beetles also appears from 
molecular data to have undergone speciation and divergence among individual

lakes or palaeodrainage basins in response to their isolation in turn produced by 
aridification of Australia (López-López et al. 2016), consistent with the findings of 
Pons et al. (2006) on Rivacindela tiger beetles.
Adaptation to Aridity
The question of whether adaptation occurred in conjunction with aridification or 
whether lineages were preadapted to arid conditions is difficult to answer. The 
divergence of lineage radiations during the Mid- to Late Miocene when the arid 
zone was emerging suggests preadaptation may have enabled rapid colonisation of 
arid environments by some plant and animal groups. Early dispersal into Australia 
from arid and semiarid areas facilitated large radiation of the Maireana/Sclerolaena 
tribe during the Pliocene (Cabrera et al. 2011) (Fig. 6). The development of aridifi-
cation was not constant and was punctuated by development of more arid conditions 
during the “Hill Gap” (10–6 million years ago), followed by more mesic conditions 
before a return to arid conditions in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. So, this early 
development of aridity may have enabled evolution of adaptive traits that facilitated 
life under the arid conditions of the Pliocene and Pleistocene (Fig. 7). Phylogenetic 
clustering seen as lower levels of phylogenetic diversity in Australian angiosperms 
in arid regions compared to mesic and tropical biomes has been interpreted as indi-
cations of fewer clades having adaptation to arid conditions (Thornhill et  al. 
2016). In a study of community structure across six arid lineages of squamates and 
marsupials, Lanier et al. (2013) showed that each group displayed distinct patterns 
of phylogenetic structure suggesting that neither current climate nor historical habi-
tat stability resulted in a uniform response by arid assemblages, and that 
taxaon-­specific history is important in determining patterns of phylogenetic com-
munity relatedness.

Evidence of adaptations to aridity in plants is considered to have occurred in the 
evolution of deeply encrypted stomata that has occurred 11 times in species of 
Proteaceae in arid environments compared to other stomatal features that have 
evolved in species present in both arid and wet environments (Jordan et al. 2008) but 
may contribute to effective gas exchange rather than reducing transpiration 
(Hassiotou et al. 2009; Roth-Nebelsick et al. 2009). Adaptations to low-nutrient

environments are found in many sclerophyllous plant groups (Hill 1994), dense 
indumentum on stems and leaves in Ptilotus (Hammer et al. 2015) are thought to 
increase reflectance and reduces heat load, and the salinity tolerance of cheno-
pods enabled them to colonise saline habitats (Cabrera et al. 2011). Evolution of 
embolism resistance in xylem hydraulic function facilitated the diversification of 
the Callitris into arid environments (Larter et al. 2017), and increased leaf thickness 
and leaf venation in eucalypts are considered to be an adaptation in arid environ-
ments (de Boer et al. 2017). Similarly, the low metabolic requirements and toler-
ance to heat and desiccation of many reptiles can be considered preadaptations to 
aridity. The presence of specialised groups in specific environments within the arid 
zone suggests specific adaptations to changing conditions, for example, the diversi-
fication of halophytic chenopods appears related to the emergence of saline water 
bodies through arid regions during the Late Pliocene (Shepherd et al. 2004), and the 
divergence of hydrobiid snails is related to development of freshwater springs in the 
Great Artesian Basin (Perez et al. 2005). Similarly, the transition from primarily 
surface-dwelling organisms to groundwater dwelling in diving beetles, amphipods 
and isopods between 11 and 3 Ma appears to be correlated with a reduction in per-
manent surface water (Cooper et al. 2007, 2008; Leys et al. 2003; Toussaint et al. 
2015a). In contrast, more recently, Toon et al. (2015) considered the loss of abaxial 
stomata in the largely arid zone genus Triodia to represent an adaptation that devel-
oped after radiation into the arid zone rather than a trait conferring preadaptation to 
arid conditions. The domiciles of arid-zone gall thrips protect against desiccation 
(Gilbert 2014), and these gall thrips diversify through drift in allopatry due to the 
paucity of host species, in contrast to mesic-zone species that diversify ecologically 
in sympatry through host shifting (McLeish 2011; McLeish et al. 2011). The heleine 
Tenebrionidae lack the physiological adaptations to reduce water loss that charac-
terise day-active desert tenebrionid beetle species, so they have become nocturnal 
(Duncan and Dickman 2009), and adaptations to phragmotic burrow-plugging have 
evolved multiple times in arid taxa of spiny trapdoor spiders (Rix et  al. 2017). 
Physiological adaptation to heat stress and evaporative water loss along with transi-
tion to nocturnality are considered to be preadaptations to aridity facilitating diver-
sification (Brennan and Oliver 2017). In birds, the ancestor of the familiar budgerigar 
may well have been preadapted morphologically and in social structure to life in the 
arid zone. The budgerigar is the sister group to lorikeets (Joseph et al. 2011), which 
have a streamlined morphology for rapid and sustained flight required to search for 
food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time. Genomic approaches 
to understanding adaptation to aridity in birds are exemplified by two recent studies 
in birds. McElroy et al. (2018) found strong evidence for purifying selection across 
all codons in the mitogenome of the mulga parrot Psephotellus varius, a species 
widespread across the arid zone. Lamb et al. (2018) studied mitochondrial DNA 
variation in 17 oscine passerines (songbirds) and found that climate was a signifi-
cant predictor of mitochondrial variation in 8 species.
Ancestral polyploidy and hybridisation in Nicotiana section Suaveolentes may 
have facilitated adaptation to arid environments, because polyploids are considered 
to be well adapted to aridity (Winterfeld et al. 2009), and other Australian plant 
M. Byrne et al.

59
genera that are common in the arid zone are polyploid (e.g. Cassia, Eremophila, 
Senna) (Barlow 1981). Two tetraploid frogs are common in the arid zone (Anstis 
2013; Mahony and Robinson 1980), but many other arid-zone frogs are diploid, and 
polyploid species also occur widely in mesic areas (Roberts and Edwards 2018), 
suggesting ploidy levels have not provided additional advantage in arid ­environments. 
Within the Ctenophorus maculatus species complex, rapid (0.3–1.5 million years) 
adaptive diversification in both ecomorphological and social signalling traits sug-
gests complex interactions between adaptation and species interactions may have 
driven speciation in response to dynamic shifts in arid habitats (Edwards et  al. 
2015). Traits that reduce water loss in frogs, such as waterproof cocoons and bur-
rowing, may enable persistence of frogs in the arid zone, but these traits are not 
exclusive to arid-zone frogs (Roberts and Edwards 2018).
Species Persistence and Intraspecific Divergence
The previous review of the arid-zone biota (Byrne et al. 2008) found two key points 
concerning intraspecific divergences. First, most arid-zone lineages and species had 
radiated within the biome by the end of the Pliocene, and, second, the Pleistocene 
was a time of maintenance of lineages and phylogeographic structuring in response 
to environmental changes. The dramatic climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene 
have led to major redistribution of species throughout the world (Hewitt 2001, 
2004), particularly leading to major contraction and expansion of species in temper-
ate biomes. Byrne et al. (2008) found evidence of intraspecific diversification in 
many arid lineages with three main patterns of genetic structure, reflecting multiple 
localised refugia, broad expansion and hybridisation or contraction and persistence 
of mesic relicts.
Many phylogeographic studies of arid-zone species have shown a common pat-
tern of high diversity, but deep divergences among geographically structured intra-
specific lineages (Byrne et al. 2008), and the divergence most commonly traced to 
the Mid-Pleistocene, which correlates with increased aridity and development of 
sandy deserts (Fujioka et al. 2009). The high diversity, but divergent lineages, sug-
gests persistence of species during the climatic changes of the Pleistocene through 
localised contraction and expansion and presence of multiple localised refugia 
throughout the distribution of species (Fig. 8). Retention of localised refugia through-
out species distributions would facilitate rapid colonisation of habitat under suitable 
climatic conditions. Application of Approximate Bayesian Computation methods to 
bird populations from a range of species supported a model of most of the popula-
tions showing a signal of a single co-expansion in the period just prior to the LGM 
when aridity was at a peak (Chan et al. 2014) indicating similar responses to envi-
ronmental conditions. In further work, Dolman and Joseph (2012, 2015, 2016) 
explored the number of divergence events that have shaped present-day phylogeo-
graphic structure in Australian birds, especially those of the arid zone, and linked 
phylogeographic patterns to the birds’ natural history and ecological diversity. The 
Evolutionary History

60
earliest event identified by Dolman and Joseph (2012), from the Middle to the Early 
Pleistocene explains the divergence of mesic populations of two species groups in 
south-eastern and south-western Australia, consistent with the increased aridifica-
tion identified by McLaren and Wallace (2010). Conversely, the most recent diver-
gence of semiarid south-eastern and south-western population pairs had its upper 
limit at the Mid-Pleistocene, but including the Last Glacial Maximum, and may be 
related to changes in plants with palatable leaves and fleshy fruits that were present 
in the Nullarbor Region between 180,000 and 400,000 years ago but now are found 
in remnant stands on the fringes of the Nullarbor Plain (Prideaux et  al. 2007). 
Similarly, Hocknull et al. (2007) noted extinction of mesic fauna in central eastern 
Australia within this timeframe. Phylogeographic analysis of southern hairy-nosed 
wombat identified six lineages across the southern arid region (Alpers et al. 2016).
In contrast to the majority pattern of diverse but divergent lineages, there is evi-
dence for a second pattern of widespread, low-diversity lineages in more vagile 
species (e.g. birds, snakes, lizards, freshwater fish, crayfish) (Bostock et al. 2006; 
Byrne et al. 2003; Joseph and Wilke 2006, 2007; Joseph et al. 2002, 2006; Kearns 
et al. 2008; Kuch et al. 2005; Nguyen et al. 2004; Strasburg and Kearney 2005; Toon 
et al. 2007), and this was also found more recently in pied butcherbirds (Kearns

et  al. 2010), variegated fairy-wren (McLean et  al. 2017) and clam shrimps 
(Schwentner et al. 2012). This pattern is indicative of widespread recent expansions 
across all or part of the arid zone, a characteristic being little phylogenetic structur-
ing and little evidence of specific refugia. Several lineages were identified in 
­blacksnakes using multilocus nuclear genes (Maddock et al. 2017) where no mito-
chondrial diversity was previously identified (Kuch et al. 2005), indicating several 
expansion events. Evidence for refugia was noted for some birds in inland south-
eastern Australia (Joseph and Wilke 2006; Kearns et al. 2008) and in northern and 
western regions (e.g. the galah, Eolophus roseicapilla) (Engelhard et  al. 2015). 
Phylogeographic data from the galah (Engelhard et al. 2015) may well be consistent 
with the idea advanced in Byrne et al. (2008) that refugia for some species may have 
been linear, that is, in riparian woodland. In some species, rapid expansion of lin-
eages has occurred following hybridisation, parthenogenesis and polyploidisation, 
as these processes produce instant reproductive isolation (Coyne and Orr 2004). 
This has resulted in diverse and widespread lineages of Neobatrachus frogs (Mahony 
et al. 1996), Heteronotia and Menetia lizards (Adams et al. 2003; Fujita et al. 2010; 
Moritz 1993), insects (Sipyloidea, Warramaba) and plants (Acacia aneura, Senna 
artemisiodes, Cassia sp.) (Andrew et al. 2003; Holman and Playford 2000; Randell 
1970). Subspecies in the polyploid Atriplex nummularia are proposed to have mul-
tiple origins through hybridisation (Sampson and Byrne 2012). The expansion of 
the lineages in all these species is a result of evolutionary processes, rather than the 
contraction and expansion of species due to glacial cycles in temperate regions of 
the northern hemisphere.
An interesting pattern to have emerged in one species group of birds runs counter 
to the general pattern of reduction to refugia during the Pleistocene and particularly 
in response to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Kearns et al. (2014) integrated 
palaeomodelling of the Last Glacial Maximum (~25–15,000 years ago) distribu-
tions and multilocus phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses to argue that the 
grey butcherbird, Cracticus torquatus, expanded its range in arid, inland Australia 
at the Last Glacial Maximum. This led to introgressive hybridisation with a north-
ern, tropical non-sister species, the silver-backed butcherbird, C. argenteus, and so 
explains an otherwise anomalous pattern of mtDNA diversity in these birds. 
Similarly, the use of past species distribution models shows vast increases in coastal 
sand plain habitats in reptile-plant arid hotspot on the mid-western Australian coast 
in a range of endemic reptile species (Edwards et al. 2012). Using explicit habitat-­
demographic models shows that shifts in suitable habitat explain intraspecific diver-
gence (He et al. 2013).
While the majority of species show high diversity of divergent lineages, and 
some show widespread distribution of low-diversity lineages, there are some spe-
cies that appear to represent species restricted to mesic habitat within the arid zone. 
More mesic environments, such as the springs of the Great Artesian Basin and gran-
ite outcrops, are areas where mesic relicts occur. An early study showed high genetic 
divergence in species of hydrobiid snails (Jardinella sp.) that are restricted to differ-
ent groups of springs (Perez et al. 2005). More recent studies have revealed a suite 
of invertebrate species, including Crustaceae, molluscs and insects, which are

restricted to these desert springs and diverged well before the deserts developed, 
indicating they diverged in these tiny mesic refugia in isolation (Guzik et al. 2012; 
Murphy et al. 2012, 2015). In contrast, the frog Limnodynastes tasmaniensis, which 
also occurs in these spring systems, is broadly distributed through the Flinders 
Ranges and across most of eastern Australia in both mesic and arid systems. The 
arid-adapted fish species, Chlamydogobius, shows little differentiation among Lake 
Eyre waters, indicating periodic connectivity (Mossop et al. 2015). Many species of 
the arid plant genus Goodenia are annuals and are confined to mesic environments 
in the arid zone (Jabaily et al. 2014). Granite outcrops often harbour more mesic 
habitats within the arid zone and have been hypothesised to have acted as mesic 
refugia during extreme aridity (Byrne 2008; Byrne and Hopper 2008). The relictual 
species, Acacia lobulata, has no close relatives and is now restricted to mesic south-­
facing slopes on two granite outcrops (Byrne et al. 2001). In contrast, Eucalyptus 
caesia, which is also restricted to granite outcrops, shows high divergence but 
appears to be adapted to the specific granite rock habitat and does not show evi-
dence of repeated cycles of population expansion and contraction (Byrne and 
Hopper 2008). More recent analysis of two very widespread plant species restricted 
to granite outcrops in both arid and mesic environments showed similar levels of 
high haplotype diversity with divergence among populations, with less diversity in 
more arid populations than in mesic populations (Tapper et al. 2014a, b).
Recent work has also focused on the Banded Ironstone Formation ranges of the 
Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons that are also areas that harbour more mesic environ-
ments. Analysis of species diversity in the western area of the arid zone shows the 
ranges to have higher species diversity than the surrounding lowland areas, and 
those on the arid-zone boundary have higher beta diversity and greater endemism 
and diversity than those further inland (Gibson et al. 2012). Recent studies have 
shown mixed patterns of phylogeographic diversity and structure. Some more 
restricted species, a Grevillea and a millipede, show patterns of persistence and 
divergence between isolated formations (Nistelberger et al. 2014, 2015a), while in 
other plant species, a combination of moderate diversity with persistence of ances-
tral haplotypes suggests maintenance of larger populations with some isolation 
(Binks et al. 2015; Millar et al. 2017; Nistelberger et al. 2015b). In contrast, a rare 
species of Acacia restricted to a localised group of formations shows evidence of 
local connectivity (Millar et al. 2013), as do two other regionally distributed plant 
species, having common haplotypes shared among populations (Millar et al. 2016). 
The arid lineages of the conifer Callitris columellaris, which are restricted to ranges, 
granite rocks and inselbergs, show evidence of strong bottlenecks and range con-
traction over multiple Pleistocene climatic cycles, indicating contraction to mesic 
refugia, in contrast to signals of population expansion in the mesic lineages in south-
ern temperate areas (Sakaguchi et al. 2013). The arid-zone outliers of the mesic 
species of the Egernia whitii complex of skinks have been interpreted as relicts of a 
broader range now contracted to southern mesic areas (Chapple and Keogh 2004).
Ranges in the arid zone were predicted by Byrne et al. (2008) to be refugia for 
species. In a series of studies on reptiles, Pepper et al. (2008, 2011a, b, 2013a, b) 
explored the lineage divergence and the evolutionary consequences of relatively

recent development of widespread sand deserts between these arid-zone ranges. 
Pepper et al. (2011a) used multilocus phylogenetic analyses to show that among 
rock-dwelling Heteronotia geckoes, each range harbours a divergent lineage; 
­substantial intraspecific diversity is likely due to topographic complexity in these 
areas. Old divergences (~4 Ma) among lineages predate the formation of the geo-
logically young sand deserts (<1 Ma), suggesting that Pliocene climate shifts frac-
tured the distributions of biota long before the spread of the deserts. In further 
analyses of multiple mitochondrial DNA datasets from four species complexes of 
Australian geckoes from three genera (Heteronotia, Lucasium, Rhynchoedura), 
Pepper et al. (2011b) found that topographically complex mountain regions harbour 
high nucleotide diversity, up to 18 times greater than that of the surrounding desert 
lowlands. Taxa in topographically complex areas have older coalescent histories 
than those in the geologically younger deserts and that both ancient and more recent 
aridification events have contributed to these patterns. In a later analysis, Pepper 
et al. (2013a) reviewed patterns of diversity in one region of inland ranges, the 
Pilbara, more extensively. While noting some repeated phylogeographic patterns, 
they also highlighted the importance of species-specific ecological differences in 
shaping idiosyncratic elements of these patterns of diversification. Similar high 
divergence between lineages in ranges and presence of two highly divergent lin-
eages in the Central Ranges was observed in Oedura geckoes (Oliver and McDonald 
2016). The plant Triodia basedowii complex occurs across the Pilbara and central 
arid zone, and diversification has been identified within the Pilbara compared with 
that in the deserts (Anderson et al. 2016). In addition, similar to reptiles, substrate 
was hypothesised to be important in diversification within the plant Triodia base-
dowii complex (Anderson et al. 2016). Substrate was also identified as an important 
feature explaining the genetic diversity of reptile communities along the Western 
Australian coast (Edwards et al. 2012). In Uperoleia froglets, species boundaries 
appear correlated with geological and substrate boundaries as well as major drain-
ages between the Pilbara and Gascoyne (Catullo et al. 2011)
Phylogeographic analysis of plant species revealed high diversity in Pilbara ranges 
and lower diversity in the surrounding areas for Eucalyptus leucophloia, consistent 
with the ranges being refugia (Byrne et al. 2017). Although this pattern was not evi-
dent in either a widespread Acacia or its restricted congener that showed differing 
patterns, with high diversity throughout the distribution in the widespread species, 
and low diversity in the species restricted to the ranges, and there was evidence for 
greater genetic connectivity in populations of the widespread species in the ranges, 
suggesting maintenance of larger effective populations size (Levy et al. 2016).
New Insights
Our evaluation of molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies conducted 
since the review of Byrne et al. (2008) has revealed further support for the main 
hypotheses identified there, particularly divergence and diversification of arid-zone

species and lineages derived from both mesic and tropical ancestors, and variation 
in diversification rates. Interestingly, more recent studies have also found evidence 
of mesic and tropical species being derived from ancestral arid groups and also 
some transition back to arid lineages. In addition, while few cases of speciation in 
the Pleistocene were previously noted, more recent studies have identified more 
cases in plants, land snails, frogs and fish. Distinct patterns of phylogenetic struc-
ture in mammals and squamates also suggest that neither current climate nor histori-
cal habitat stability resulted in a uniform response by arid assemblages highlighting 
that idiosyncratic historical and biogeographical aspects of community composition 
are important and that studies of individual taxa are necessary to fully understand 
the responses of species to aridity. Further evidence of adaptation to aridity was 
found in plants and reptiles.
More recent phylogeographic studies have found similar evidence of the two 
broad patterns of diverse but highly differentiated lineages, and widespread low-­
diversity lineages. Further investigations support the hypothesis that mesic habitats, 
such as salt lakes, desert springs, granite outcrops, banded ironstone ranges and 
Pilbara ranges, provide refugia enabling species to persist within the arid zone with 
high diversity and differentiation in these mesic arid-zone habitats. Evidence of 
range expansion after the LGM remains limited but has been identified in a study on 
butcherbirds.
Opportunities and Challenges
The ready availability of molecular tools has seen a huge growth in the number and 
scale of studies investigating evolutionary history in arid-zone species, with over 
three times as many studies available now compared to 2008. These studies high-
light the complexity in patterns and processes of the evolutionary history of the 
arid-zone biota and demonstrate the diversity of responses to aridification across the 
vast Australian environment.
While the large number of studies on arid-zone species has shown commonality 
in a range of patterns, there is much still to learn about specific responses of the 
biota to arid environments. Patterns of refugia within arid environments remain 
enigmatic, beyond the obvious mesic habitats of ranges, inselbergs and mound 
springs, although the concept of linear corridors of habitats being refugia for birds 
appears validated in the galah. Despite sandy habitats dominating arid environ-
ments, there is a great deal we don’t know about the evolution of species specific to 
sand habitats, particularly in reptiles, where there are many species with unique 
adaptations to sandy habitats and evidence that substrate has a role in generating 
intra- and interspecific divergences.
The revolution in molecular technology has facilitated major advances in our 
knowledge of evolutionary history, yet there is now much opportunity to integrate 
molecular techniques with advances in other fields. We are only just beginning to 
see the incorporation of other powerful tools like ecological modelling, hypothesis

testing frameworks, biogeographic model testing and morphological and behav-
ioural analyses, with molecular studies in an integrative approach. We envisage that 
such integrative studies will have much more to reveal about the intricacies of the 
evolutionary history of the arid-zone biota in the years to come.

Mineral Nutrition of Plants in Australia’s 
Arid Zone
Honghua He, David J. Eldridge, and Hans Lambers
Introduction
Australia’s arid-zone soils are highly leached and resorted (Winkworth 1967; Pillans 
2018) and characterised by low levels of available water and nutrients (Orians and 
Milewski 2007). These soils are particularly low in total phosphorus (P) and nitro-
gen (N) (Islam et al. 2000; Bennett and Adams 2001; Grigg et al. 2008a). The dis-
tribution of these and other nutrients is typically heterogeneous, due to the 
development of ‘islands of fertility’ and tight nutrient cycling beneath the canopies 
of long-lived perennial plants (Tongway and Ludwig 1994; He et al. 2011). Nutrient 
cycling and decomposition of leaf litter are largely restricted to periods after rain, 
when bacteria (Skopp et al. 1990; Ford et al. 2007) and cyanobacteria, either free-­
living or as components of biological soil crusts (biocrusts), are active (Austin et al. 
2004). Termites also play an important role in litter decomposition and nutrient 
cycling and contribute to the patchy distribution of nutrients (Tongway et al. 1989; 
Park et al. 1994).

Unlike many ecosystems in which herbivores and detritivores are the primary 
consumers of foliage, fire is the primary consumer of the nutrient-poor and woody 
plant tissues in the arid zone and is a significant recycler of nutrients (Orians and 
Milewski 2007; van Etten and Burrows 2018). Getzin et al. (2016) developed a 
‘Nutrient-Poverty/Intense-Fire Theory’ and postulated that the most unusual char-
acteristics of Australian ecosystems and their organisms are the evolutionary conse-
quences of adaptations to nutrient poverty and the presence of intense fires, which 
tend to exacerbate nutrient impoverishment. Intense fire reinforces nutrient poverty 
by volatilising nutrients such as N and sulfur (S). This produces a temporal pattern 
of either feast or famine in nutrients contained in ash, depleting the soluble fractions 
of nutrients through flooding and leaching. There are also brief nutrient pulses fol-
lowing fires (Orians and Milewski 2007; Getzin et al. 2016).
Nitrogen is continuously lost from the system, predominantly as a result of fire, 
when most N is volatilised (Orians and Milewski 2007). Nitrogen fixation is there-
fore critically important to compensate for these losses. Many plants such as acacias 
can fix N2 through symbiotic associations with rhizobia and are able to replenish N 
depleted by volatilisation (Schortemeyer et al. 2002; Orians and Milewski 2007). 
Some termite species, cyanobacteria and cyanolichens (those containing cyanobac-
teria as one of their partners) can also fix N2. Termites and biocrust organisms such 
as cyanobacteria are likely major contributors of N to this system (Tongway et al. 
1989; Pate et al. 1998).
Most soils in Australia’s arid zone have a low-P availability, due to long-term 
weathering and sorption of P by iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxides and hydrox-
ides (Morton et al. 2011). For example, plant-available P concentrations in some 
soils in the Great Sandy Desert are less than 2 μg g−1; foliage P concentrations of 
most woody plants grown in these soils are less than 1 mg g−1, and those of some 
Triodia (spinifex) species are even lower than 0.2 mg g−1 (Grigg et al. 2008a, b; He 
et al. 2011). In addition to P, concentrations of micronutrient such as zinc (Zn) are 
likely to be low in soils in Australia’s arid zone (Orians and Milewski 2007). Some 
plants, however, are able to accumulate high levels of elements such as manganese 
(Mn) in their foliage, even when the availability of these elements in the soil is rela-
tively low (Fernando et al. 2009). Furthermore, the availability of some micronutri-
ents such as nickel (Ni) in some soils is very high, and certain plants growing on 
such soils become Ni-hyperaccumulators (Severne and Brooks 1972).
Dinitrogen-fixing acacias (Fabaceae) are major components of most vegetation 
types in Australia’s arid zone (Orians and Milewski 2007; Gonzalez-Orozco et al. 
2011). Other major plant species include Grevillea and Hakea (Proteaceae), 
Eucalyptus and Corymbia (Myrtaceae) and Triodia (Poaceae) (Grigg et al. 2008b; 
Goldie et al. 2010). In this chapter, we focus on the mineral nutrition of some major 
plant families in Australia’s arid zone, including the mineral nutrition of Acacia spe-
cies and non-mycotrophic plants (mainly Proteaceae). The role of desert biocrusts, 
and termites and their symbionts, in nutrient cycling, is also discussed, and species 
with high levels of metals such as Mn, Ni and gold (Au) are presented.

Mineral Nutrition of Acacia Species
Acacias are often associated with rhizobia and are therefore capable of N2 fixation 
(Marsudi et al. 1999; Schortemeyer et al. 2002). Acacias play a prominent role in 
the long-term maintenance, or increase, in N stocks across many ecosystems in 
Australia’s arid zone, particularly following fire, when most N is lost (Hingston 
et al. 1982; Orians and Milewski 2007). Mean N concentration in mature phyl-
lodes (i.e. modified petioles that function as leaves) of four Acacia species in the 
Telfer region of the Great Sandy Desert is 14.8 mg N g−1 (He et al. 2011) and that 
of four Acacia species in an area near the Nifty Copper Operation in the Great 
Sandy Desert is 16.7 mg g−1 (Grigg et al. 2008a; A.M. Grigg pers. comm.) (Fig. 1). 
These values are equivalent to or exceed the concentration of N in plant shoot dry 
matter (15 mg g−1), which is sufficient to sustain crop growth (Kirkby 2012). The 
δ15N values of phyllodes of the four species in the Telfer region were between 
−0.8‰ and 1.4‰, and the values of their associated Triodia species ranged from 
0.5‰ to 1.7‰, with three out of the four Acacia species having significantly 
lower δ15N values than their associated Triodia species. This suggests that all but 
one of the four Acacia species fixed N2. The estimated proportion of phyllode N 
derived from symbiotic N2 fixation (%Ndfa) for Acacia ancistrocarpa, Acacia 
stellaticeps and Acacia robeorum was 25%, 40% and 75%, respectively (He et al. 
2011). Some Acacia species in an area near the Nifty Copper Operation of the 
Great Sandy Desert display δ15N values that are less than half those of their non-
fixing neighbours, and their phyllode δ15N values are very close to zero, indicating 
that these Acacia species fix N2 symbiotically (Grigg et al. 2008a). However, the 
δ15N data for Australian mulga ecosystems strongly indicate that symbiotic N2 
fixation by Acacia species is virtually non-existent in these mulga species, as the 
δ15N values for both putative N2-­fixing species (9·1 ± 0·6‰; mean ± SE) and

associated nonleguminous species (9·1 ± 0·5‰) are identical, and there is no evi-
dence of nodulation in these Acacia roots (Pate et  al. 1998). Nitrate-nitrogen 
(NO3
−-N) is present in high concentrations and is the predominant form of avail-
able N in mulga soils. It is likely, therefore, that nodulation and associated symbi-
otic N2 fixation are inhibited by high soil N availability (Erskine et al. 1996; Pate 
et al. 1998).
As acacias are capable of symbiotic N2 fixation, they may have an unlimited N 
supply from the air, thus freeing them from N limitation in N-poor soils. However, 
the energy and P costs of N2 fixation are relatively high. Nitrogen-fixing legumes 
commonly require more inorganic P than nonlegume species reliant on mineral N 
assimilation (Kouas et al. 2009). Phosphorus deficiency has negative effects on the 
growth of the host plant and/or on the growth and functioning of the nodules, thus 
impairing symbiotic N2 fixation (Almeida et al. 2000). Phosphorus concentrations 
in mature phyllodes of four Acacia species growing in P-impoverished soils in the 
Telfer region ranged between 0.31 and 0.44 mg g−1 (He et al. 2011). Those of four 
Acacia species growing in an area near the Nifty Copper Operation varied between 
0.28 and 0.73 mg g−1 (Grigg 2009) (Table 1), being much lower than the average P 
concentration considered sufficient for crop plants (2 mg g−1) (Kirkby 2012).
The high N:P ratios in Acacia phyllodes indicate that P is more limiting than N 
for acacias in Australia’s arid zone. For four Acacia species growing in 
P-impoverished soils in the Telfer region, N:P ratios in mature phyllodes are between 
27 and 55, with a mean value of 44 (He et al. 2011), and those in phyllodes of four 
Acacia species growing in an area near the Nifty Copper Operation are between 23 
and 47, with a mean value of 34 (Grigg 2009) (Table 1). This indicates that these 
species are more severely limited by P than by N (Koerselman and Meuleman 1996; 
Güsewell 2004; Greenwood et al. 2008), consistent with results for species capable 
of symbiotic N2 fixation. These species often resorb P more efficiently than they 
resorb N, with some species resorbing up to 80% P from senescing phyllodes (He 
et al. 2011). Some species can access P from poorly available forms of P such as 
iron phosphate through carboxylate exudation (He et al. 2012a).
A few Acacia species, for example, Acacia robeorum, Acacia bivenosa, Acacia 
ligulata, Acacia didyma and Acacia startii, growing in Australia’s desert environ-
ments accumulate S in their phyllodes at values exceeding 25 mg g−1 dry matter (He 
et al. 2012b; Reid et al. 2016) (Table 2). These species are classified as thiophores, 
i.e. plants with a S concentration in their foliage ranging from 25 to 82 mg S g−1 dry 
matter (Ernst 1998). These species also have higher calcium (Ca) and magnesium 
(Mg) concentrations than other non-thiophore Acacia species growing in nearby 
habitats, and S actually co-precipitates with Ca and Mg and forms biominerals in 
phyllodes, very likely in the form of oxalates and sulfates (He et al. 2012b; Reid 
et al. 2016). The function of these S-rich biominerals is unclear. These gypsum-­
forming thiophores may be adapted to S-rich substrates concomitantly enriched in 
Ca; they do not remobilise S when phyllodes senesce but return S to the soil as 
tissue-­encapsulated and sparingly soluble minerals (Fig. 2). This suggests that they 
do not tightly regulate S uptake or use biomineralisation to immobilise or detoxify 
S (Robson et al. 2017a, b). However, some Acacia species growing in the soils

levels of S in their phyllodes (Hayes et al. 2014), suggesting that S accumulation in 
acacias may be constitutional rather than adaptive.
Non-mycotrophic Plants
The number of non-mycorrhizal species of the Proteaceae type, rather than the 
Brassicaceae type (Lambers and Teste 2013), is greatest when soil P concentrations 
are lowest, whereas mycorrhizal species dominate on less P-impoverished soils 
(Lambers et al. 2006, 2010). Species from the family Proteaceae are almost all non-­
mycorrhizal and most produce cluster (=proteoid) roots when grown in low-P soils 
(Shane and Lambers 2005a). Proteaceae species are abundant on the most severely 
P-impoverished soils in south-western Australia, where plant species diversity is 
greatest (Lambers et al. 2010). They are also found in the arid zone of Australia 
(Fig. 3), but there is very limited work on Proteaceae from the arid zone (Grigg et al. 
2008a). Information on the mineral nutrition of these species comes largely from 
studies conducted outside the arid zone.
Some Grevillea species growing in an area near the Nifty Copper Operation of 
the Great Sandy Desert display low leaf P concentrations, e.g. the average leaf P 
concentration of Grevillea eriostachya, Grevillea stenobotrya and Grevillea wick-
hamii is 0.33, 0.44 and 0.33 mg g−1, respectively (A.M. Grigg, pers. comm.). These 
species also show low leaf N concentrations, with the average N concentration of 
each species being 8.2, 9.0 and 9.8 mg g−1, respectively, and the mean N:P ratio of 
each species is 26, 21 and 29, respectively (A.M. Grigg, pers. comm.), suggesting 
that plant productivity in the habitat of these species is P-limited (Koerselman and 
Meuleman 1996; Güsewell 2004; Greenwood et al. 2008). However, these species, 
like Proteaceae from south-western Australia, likely possess some special charac-
teristics to function at very low soil P availability and show rapid rates of photosyn-
thesis at very low leaf P concentrations, i.e. high photosynthetic P-use efficiency

(Grigg et al. 2008a), just like many south-western Australian Proteaceae (Lambers 
et al. 2012, 2015a).
In south-western Australia, Proteaceae species occur on the most severely 
P-impoverished soils where ‘plant-available’ (e.g. bicarbonate-extractable or resin-­
exchangeable) soil P concentrations are typically less than 1 μg g−1 soil (Lambers 
et al. 2013; Hayes et al. 2014). In this region, they have diversified more than any-
where else (Pate et al. 2001). Several traits related to P nutrition contribute to the 
success of Proteaceae on severely P-impoverished soils in south-western Australia. 
These include (i) releasing carboxylates from ephemeral cluster roots to ‘mine’ P 
that is sorbed onto soil particles to improve the P-acquisition efficiency; (ii) using P 
efficiently for photosynthesis by allocating P to photosynthetic cells and not epider-
mal cells, replacing phospholipids by lipids that do not contain P and investing little 
P in ribosomal RNA (rRNA); (iii) resorbing P very efficiently from senescing 
organs; and (iv) storing a high level of P in seeds (Lambers et al. 2015a; Hayes et al. 
2018).
Cluster roots are ephemeral structures that only function for about 3  weeks 
(Shane et al. 2004a); in south-western Australia, they are predominantly produced 
near the surface, just under the litter layer or an ash bed after a fire in response to 
slightly elevated levels of P, but they are suppressed when P supply is higher (Shane 
and Lambers 2005a). Cluster roots of Proteaceae and Fabaceae release large 
amounts of carboxylates into the rhizosphere in an ‘exudative burst’ under P defi-
ciency (Watt and Evans 1999; Shane et al. 2004a; Delgado et al. 2014). The released 
carboxylates can mobilise both inorganic and organic P that is sorbed onto soil 
particles, via ligand exchange, thus replacing P from the soil matrix and making P 
enter into the soil solution to become available for uptake by plant roots (Lambers 
et al. 2006; Richardson et al. 2011). The developmentally regulated release of sig-
nificant amounts of carboxylates such as citrate at a fast rate has an advantage in 
minimising the chance of microbial degradation of the carboxylates before they can 
mobilise P sorbed onto soil particles (Shane et al. 2004a; Lambers et al. 2015a). 
Phenolic compounds such as isoflavonoids and antifungal cell wall-degrading 
enzymes excreted by white lupin (Lupinus albus) are likely also released by cluster 
roots of Proteaceae (Delgado et al. 2015) to inhibit microbial activity and reduce 
potential citrate consumption (Weisskopf et al. 2006a, b). Protons are often released 
before, or at the same time as the exudation of carboxylates, in order to maintain 
charge balance and result in rhizosphere acidification, which inhibits bacterial 
metabolism (Weisskopf et al. 2006a). Acidification enhances the availability of P in 
alkaline (calcareous) soil (Hinsinger et  al. 2003; Lambers et  al. 2006), but the 
release of protons may result in reduced P availability in acidic soils (Palomo et al. 
2006; Lambers et al. 2008). Interestingly, Proteaceae from south-western Australia 
naturally occurring on acidic soils release other cations, possibly potassium (K+) or 
sodium (Na+), to maintain charge balance (Roelofs et al. 2001); the same has been 
found for white lupin, which releases both protons and other cations from its cluster 
roots (Zhu et al. 2005).
Leaf P concentrations of many Proteaceae in south-western Australia are 
extremely low, being about 0.2  mg  g−1 dry matter (DM) (Denton et  al. 2007a; 
Mineral Nutrition of Plants in Australia’s Arid Zone

86
Lambers et al. 2012), much lower than the average P concentration (2 mg g−1) in 
plant shoot dry matter sufficient for adequate crop growth (Kirkby 2012). The pho-
tosynthetic rate per unit leaf P of these species is among the highest ever recorded 
(Wright et al. 2004; Denton et al. 2007a; Lambers et al. 2012; A.M. Grigg pers. 
comm.). Leaf P concentrations of these species are diluted by the scleromorphic 
structures of the leaves but that is only a small part of the story (Lambers et al. 
2015a). A preferential allocation of P to mesophyll cells, rather than to epidermal 
cells, partly accounts for the high photosynthetic rate per unit leaf P (photosynthetic 
P-use efficiency, PPUE) of Proteaceae in south-western Australia (Shane et  al. 
2004b; Hayes et al. 2018). Furthermore, some Proteaceae species from severely 
P-impoverished soils extensively replace phospholipids with galactolipids and sul-
folipids that do not contain P during leaf development to achieve a high PPUE 
(Lambers et al. 2012). Most importantly, rRNA levels in leaves of Proteaceae spe-
cies growing in their natural P-impoverished habitat are very low; these species also 
show a slow development of their photosynthetic apparatus, and their ‘delayed 
greening’ is associated with extremely low levels of plastidic rRNA in expanding 
leaves (Sulpice et al. 2014).
For many Proteaceae in south-western Australia, loss of P is minimised through 
efficient P resorption from senescing leaves and roots. For example, leaf P resorp-
tion efficiency of Banksia chamaephyton is up to 82% (Denton et al. 2007a), that of 
Banksia attenuata may exceed 90% (Hayes et al. 2014), and P concentrations in 
senesced leaves of Banksia attenuata can be as low as 19 μg P g−1 DM (Hayes et al. 
2014). Some Proteaceae species such as harsh hakea (Hakea prostrata) can highly 
efficiently remobilise (80–90%) of P from senescing cluster roots to further enhance 
their ability to survive on severely P-impoverished soils (Shane et al. 2004a, 2014).
Maximising the allocation of P to seeds is another strategy to use P efficiently. 
Seed P content can comprise a significant proportion of the total aboveground P 
content in some Banksia species, e.g. 48% for Banksia hookeriana, whose seeds 
contain only 0.5% of all the aboveground plant biomass (Witkowski and Lamont 
1996). Unlike the leaves, which contain very low concentrations of P, seeds of many 
south-western Australian Proteaceae species contain remarkably high P concentra-
tions, of which the mean value is 13.2 mg P g−1 DM, with that in seeds of Hakea 
pycnoneura being as high as 36 mg P g−1 DM (Kuo 1982; Milberg and Lamont 
1997; Denton et al. 2007a; Groom and Lamont 2010). In contrast, the mean value 
of a wide range of crop species is 3.5 mg P g−1 DM (Marschner 1995). Concentrations 
of P in seeds of a range of Banksia species are 20–40 times greater than those in 
leaves (Kuo 1982; Denton et al. 2007a). A high seed P content supports seedling 
establishment and early growth in P-impoverished soils, making the initial growth 
of these species largely independent of P acquisition from the severely 
P-impoverished soils in which they grow, thus giving them a strong competitive 
advantage over other species that contain less P in their seeds and/or use the P 
reserve in seeds less efficiently (Milberg and Lamont 1997). The P content of the 
sown seeds of nine Banksia species could have contributed as much as 12–70% to 
the total P content of 8-month-old seedlings, assuming that the transfer efficiency of 
P from seed to seedling was 100% and the potential contribution of seed P content 
H. He et al.

87
to seedling P content was significantly correlated with seed size (Denton et  al. 
2007b). About 87–92% of P in 3-month-old seedlings of Hakea circumalata and 
Hakea psilorrhyncha was estimated to have been transferred from P reserves in 
seeds (Milberg and Lamont 1997).
Proteaceae that are endemic to P-impoverished soils show several traits related 
to their P economy, but many are also extremely sensitive to P toxicity, a common, 
but not universal phenomenon for south-western Australian Proteaceae. Plant 
growth will be disturbed and lethal damage may occur, even when P supply in the 
soil is increased only slightly (Shane et  al. 2004b; Shane and Lambers 2006; 
Hawkins et al. 2008; de Campos et al. 2013). A low capacity of these species to 
downregulate their P uptake system accounts for their P sensitivity; this is correlated 
with a high capacity to remobilise P from senescing leaves (Shane et al. 2004c; 
Shane and Lambers 2006; de Campos et al. 2013).
The P-mobilising carboxylates released by cluster roots of Proteaceae also 
mobilise micronutrients such as Mn; as a result, Proteaceae tend to contain rela-
tively high levels of Mn in their leaves, even when plants grow in soil with low Mn 
availability (Lambers et al. 2015b). Accumulation of Mn in mature leaves of Hakea 
prostrata grown at a high P supply declines as the formation of cluster roots is sup-
pressed (Shane and Lambers 2005b). Therefore, leaf Mn concentration can be used 
as an easily measured aboveground trait to provide an indication of carboxylate 
release related to P acquisition (Shane and Lambers 2005b; Lambers et al. 2015b). 
Concentrations of some other micronutrients also increase when carboxylates are 
released by cluster roots, but not as markedly as that of Mn, whose uptake is rela-
tively poorly controlled (Lambers et al. 2015b). However, concentrations of most 
other micronutrients, except Ni in Banksia leaves are lower than those considered 
sufficient for adequate growth of crops (Denton et al. 2007a; Kirkby 2012; Hayes 
et al. 2014). The average Mn concentration of Grevillea eriostachya and Grevillea 
wickhamii growing in an area near the Nifty Copper Operation of the Great Sandy 
Desert is 328 (ranging between 190 and 420) and 258 (ranging between 160 and 
460) μg Mn g−1 DM, respectively, whereas that of Grevillea stenobotrya growing 
nearby is less, 60 (ranging between 30 and 94) μg Mn g−1 DM. The average Fe 
concentration is 158, 113 and 133 μg Fe g−1 DM for Grevillea eriostachya, Grevillea 
stenobotrya and Grevillea wickhamii, respectively. Among the three Grevillea spe-
cies, Grevillea eriostachya has the highest leaf Cu concentration, which is 11.3 μg 
Cu g−1 DM, followed by that of Grevillea stenobotrya, which is 6.6 μg Cu g−1 DM, 
while the leaf Cu concentration of Grevillea wickhamii is only 3.5  μg Cu g−1 
DM. The leaf Zn concentration of the three Grevillea species is low, with the mean 
value of each species being 3.5, 7.5 and 4.3 μg Zn g−1 DM (A.M. Grigg, pers. 
comm.), much less than the Zn concentration (20 μg Zn g−1 DM) in plant shoot dry 
matter sufficient for adequate crop growth (Kirkby 2012). Zinc is a cofactor for a 
range of enzymes (Broadley et  al. 2012), and since protein levels are low in 
Proteaceae (Sulpice et al. 2014), low Zn levels are to be expected.
The low ribosome abundance in leaves of Proteaceae adapted to low-P soils will 
result in slow protein synthesis rates (Lambers et al. 2015a) and, consequently, a 
low N and S demand (Prodhan et al. 2016, 2017). Despite the low soil N availability 
Mineral Nutrition of Plants in Australia’s Arid Zone

in the areas where the Proteaceae occur, these species have high leaf N:P ratios and 
plant productivity in these habitats is more severely limited by P than by N (Lambers 
et al. 2010; Hayes et al. 2014). Although protein concentrations on a fresh weight 
basis in both young and mature leaves of a few Proteaceae species in their natural 
habitat in south-western Australia are very low when compared with those of 
Arabidopsis thaliana, the concentrations of total free amino acids are only margin-
ally lower (Sulpice et al. 2014). The N and S uptake and metabolism of Proteaceae 
species in Australia’s arid zone may be tightly controlled when P is limiting, similar 
to what has been found for Hakea prostrata (Proteaceae), and such mechanisms of 
constrained N and S acquisition may help arid-zone Proteaceae species to survive in 
P-impoverished environments (Prodhan et al. 2016, 2017).
Non-mycotrophic species other than those releasing P-mobilising carboxylates 
include hemiparasites. Hemiparasitic mistletoes (Amyema, Diplatia and Lysiana 
species; Loranthaceae) in Australia’s arid zone have received significant attention, 
mainly from the perspective of their water relations, which are pivotal to ensure 
movement of nutrients dissolved in xylem sap towards the mistletoe (Hellmuth 
1971; Ehleringer et al. 1985; Ullmann et al. 1985; Reid and Lange 1988). Root 
hemiparasites in the arid zone include Exocarpos aphyllus and Exocarpos sparteus 
(Santalaceae), Santalum acuminatum, Santalum lanceolatum, Santalum murraya-
num and Santalum spicatum (Santalaceae) and Olax sparteus (Olacaceae) (https://
florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/). The mechanism used by these genera to acquire nutri-
ents from the roots of their hosts is based on similar principles as those in mistle-
toes, i.e. a more negative water potential than that of their host (Pate et al. 1990; 
Tennakoon et al. 1997; Radomiljac et al. 1999; Cernusak et al. 2004). Exocarpos 
aphyllus (Fig. 4) is most remarkable in that it has been observed as a stem hemipara-
site (Baird 2014; H. Lambers, pers. obs.), whereas this genus is known to comprise 
only root hemiparasites (Baird 2014).

Australia’s arid zone may seem an unlikely place for carnivorous plants, but fol-
lowing heavy rain, a suitable habitat is available for Drosera finlaysoniana 
(H. Lambers, pers. obs.; Fig. 5). The natural distribution of other sundew (Drosera) 
and rainbow plant (Byblis) species also includes the arid zone ­(https://florabase.
dpaw.wa.gov.au/).
The Role of the Desert Crust in Nutrient Cycling
Biological soil crusts are complex assemblages of mosses, lichens, liverworts, cya-
nobacteria, bacteria and fungi that are intimately associated with surface soils 
(Eldridge and Greene 1994). Biocrusts are a common component of dryland soils in 
southern Australia (Fig. 6), where their distribution is largely driven by rainfall dis-
tribution and soil pH (Eldridge 2003). Crusts mainly occur in the interspaces among 
perennial vascular plants (Weber et al. 2017), where they play substantial roles in 
hydrological function (Eldridge et  al. 2010), soil nutrition (Weber et  al. 2015; 
Barger et al. 2016) and soil stabilisation (Eldridge 1996; Eldridge and Leys 2003). 
In Australia, biocrusts are most strongly developed on highly calcareous soils in 
areas of winter rainfall, and as summer rainfall increases with distance northwards, 
lichen-dominated crusts make way to surfaces dominated by cyanobacteria and cya-
nolichens (Eldridge 2003). Increasing summer rainfall reduces the capacity of the 
lichen component of the crust to photosynthesise at high summer temperatures 
(Rogers 1971).
Biocrusts play substantial roles in the soil carbon (C) and N cycles (Barger et al. 
2016). Their activity is closely linked to soil water availability, particularly during 
wet periods following rainfall when microbes are in contact with suitable substrates 
(Morillas and Gallardo 2015). Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and cyanolichens can 
fix up to 6 kg N ha−1 year−1 in drylands globally, accounting for about 7% of net 
primary productivity by terrestrial vegetation (Elbert et  al. 2012). In Australian

Sandy Desert in Western Australia. (Photos: Hans Lambers)

drylands, rates of N2 fixation by biocrusts are estimated to be about 
1.3 kg N ha−1 year−1 (Williams and Eldridge 2011). Although substantial amounts 
of N are entering the N cycle by N2-fixing vascular plants and atmospheric N depo-
sition, biocrusts contribute almost 50% of the biologically fixed N in global terres-
trial ecosystems.
Cyanobacteria and lichens release the N they have fixed in the form of extracel-
lular compounds and inorganic forms of N comprising NO3
− and ammonium 
(NH4
+), amides, peptides and amino acids (Barger et al. 2016). Many of these N 
products are subsequently available to vascular plants, with shallow-rooted plants 
generally benefiting more from extra N than deeper-rooted ones (Zhang and Nie 
2011). The release of NH4
+ from N2-fixing organisms can result in rapid rates of 
nitrification (Strauss et al. 2012). Ammonium and NO3
− taken up by vascular plants 
may be released from biological soil crusts following rainfall (Veluci et al. 2006; 
Dojani et al. 2007) or the breakdown of biocrust organisms. For example, Williams 
and Eldridge (2011) showed that the deposition of sand over biocrusts during 
droughts leads to cellular autolysis of the cyanobacteria and a flush of N following 
drought-breaking rainfall.
Cyanobacteria, either free-living or associated with crusts, are photoautotrophic 
and therefore contribute significant amounts of C via photosynthesis. Structures 
such as cyanobacterial filaments and trichomes and lichen hyphae secrete C such as 
polysaccharides, which are often used by heterotrophic bacteria (Baran et al. 2015). 
Increased C can reduce C:N ratios and increase decomposition rates, increasing the

91
availability of other nutrients to soil organisms (Kleiner and Harper 1972). Globally, 
photosynthesis is predicted to increase with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide 
concentrations (Maestre et al. 2013), so that net C fixation in drylands is expected 
to increase. Climate projections for south-eastern Australia indicate substantial 
reductions (20–50%) in winter rainfall (Eldridge and Beecham 2016), which will 
likely lead to a shrinking of crust cover and a change in composition from lichens to 
cyanobacteria. This could also affect C fixation, and therefore the capacity of the 
soils to sustain plant growth (Eldridge and Beecham 2016). The impact of these 
changes on C, N and other elements is largely unknown.
Biocrusts also increase the bioavailability of many macro- and micronutrients 
such as K, Mg, Mn and Zn, and this varies across a range of spatial scales (Bowker 
et al. 2005) and can lead to changes in cation-exchange capacity. Biocrusts also 
secrete phosphatases, which release P from organic P sources that can be used by 
vascular plants in P-impoverished environments (Zhang et al. 2016). Other minerals 
such as Cd, Li, Cu, Mo and Sr negatively affect either the abundance or diversity of 
algae (Starks and Shubert 1979).
Termites and Their Symbionts as a Source of N
Termite mounds are an obvious component of the ecosystems in the arid area of 
Australia (Fig. 7) (Coventry et al. 1988; Noble et al. 2009). Termites aid in the 
decomposition of wood and plant litter (Bodine and Ueckert 1975), thereby playing 
a significant role in nutrient cycling and sustaining plant growth in low-fertility soils 
of Australia’s arid zone. Termites have been referred to as ‘keystone species’ due to 
their substantial effects on arid ecosystems (Coventry et al. 1988; Noble et al. 2009).
Termite mounds contain higher concentrations of nutrients such as N, P, K, Mg 
and Ca than the surrounding soil and act as soil nutrient reservoirs (Coventry et al. 
Fig. 7  Termite mounds in the Telfer region of the Great Sandy Desert. (a) Three neighbouring 
termite mounds. (b) A degraded and partly eroded termite mound. (Photos: Honghua He)

1988; de Bruyn and Conacher 1990, 1995; Takeshita and Araya 2004). The nutrients 
temporarily retained in the mounds will eventually be returned to the soil surface by 
erosion of abandoned mound and contribute to the development of ‘Islands of 
Fertility’ (Smith and Yeaton 1998; Takeshita and Araya 2004). Nutrient levels in the 
soil material turned over by termites are two to seven times that of the A1 soil hori-
zon of some low-fertility soils in a semiarid tropical woodland in north-eastern 
Queensland (Coventry et al. 1988). Termites bioaccumulate, defend and gradually 
release mineralised N throughout the colony and contribute a substantial portion of 
the total N turnover in arid ecosystems (Schaefer and Whitford 1981; Takeshita and 
Araya 2004). There is a wealth of evidence that termites and their symbionts are a 
source of N in arid enviroments, including the arid zone of Australia (Barnes et al. 
1992; Melchiorre et al. 2006; Whitford and Eldridge 2013).
The δ15N values of termites and termite-mound material suggest that some ter-
mite colonies are capable of fixing atmospheric N (Pate et al. 1998; Melchiorre et al. 
2006). Gut microbiota of wood-feeding termites are responsible for the N2 fixation 
and compensate for the low availability of N in the diet of these termites (Lilburn 
et al. 2001; Desai and Brune 2012). The newly fixed N is converted to termite tis-
sues and can be distributed throughout the colony by social feeding, thus contribut-
ing to the biogeochemical cycling of N in terrestrial ecosystems (Schaefer and 
Whitford 1981; Coventry et al. 1988; Tayasu et al. 1994). Elevated concentrations 
of NO3
− and 15N occur in groundwater from the arid regions of Australia, due to N2 
fixation by termites. Within a termite mound, NH4
+ is produced by biological N2 
fixation and then bacterially oxidised to NO3
−, which is leached out of the mound 
by rainfall (Barnes et al. 1992; Melchiorre et al. 2006). When the colony dies, a 
greater flux of NO3
− to the substrate and groundwater for plant uptake will result 
from rain-induced erosion and degradation of the termite mounds, and the rate of 
this flux depends on the degree of erosion and on the longevity of mounds (Park 
et al. 1994; Melchiorre et al. 2006). For areas of high termite-mound density, the 
total amount of termite-fixed N is significant over geological time scales (Melchiorre 
et al. 2006).
Soil-feeding termites consume the humus in soil organic matter (Ngugi et al. 
2011). A significant increase in NH4
+ occurs in the nests of soil-feeding termites, 
possibly due to the presence of litter, and also the physicochemical and biochemical 
properties of the digestive system of soil-feeding termites, which can effectively 
catalyse the transformation of refractory soil organic N to a plant-available form 
(Ndiaye et al. 2004; Ji and Brune 2006). The mineralised N can leach out of the 
mounds and accumulate in the surrounding soil during the rainy season (Ndiaye 
et al. 2004). Ammonium tends to become bound to the nest soil and is less mobile 
than NO3
−, which more readily leaches out of the mounds (Park et al. 1994; Ji and 
Brune 2006).
Termites are sensitive to moisture and temperature levels, and they are particu-
larly active after rain (Curtis and Waller 1998; Davies et al. 2015); thus, the N2-­
fixation rates of termites vary seasonally, being fastest at moderate temperatures and 
slowest under both extremes (Curtis and Waller 1998). Therefore, the contribution 
of termites and their symbionts to the N influx into the ecosystems may also show 
H. He et al.

seasonal variation. In some cases, the contribution of termites to nutrient availability 
can be observed through the productivity of plants growing near abandoned termite 
mounds (Schaefer and Whitford 1981).
Metal-Accumulating Plant Species
Manganese
Manganese is an essential plant micronutrient but also one of the most important 
metals that may be hyperaccumulated in plants. Most plants can tolerate Mn well 
above their normal physiological requirements (Fernando et al. 2009). However, 
accumulation of Mn by some plants does not necessarily require high levels of soil 
Mn, and plants in the same family may show a great variation in leaf Mn concentra-
tion (Hocking 1986). As mentioned previously, Grevillea eriostachya and Grevillea 
wickhamii growing in the Great Sandy Desert can accumulate up to 420 and 460 μg 
Mn g−1 DM, respectively (A.M. Grigg, pers. comm.). It is likely that the cluster roots 
formed by these species play a significant role in Mn acquisition and accumulation 
(Shane and Lambers 2005b). However, these Proteaceae in the arid zone of Australia 
are not Mn-hyperaccumulators, according to the criterion of Mn concentrations for 
Mn hyperaccumulation, which is 10,000 μg g−1 (van der Ent et al. 2013). To date, 
almost all identified and potential Mn-hyperaccumulators are tropical rainforest spe-
cies occurring in eastern Australia (Bidwell et al. 2002; Fernando et al. 2009, 2012).
Nickel
Ultramafic (or serpentine) soils typically have a high pH and are rich in Ni. Plants 
growing in serpentine soils are often stunted and have morphologies typical of des-
ert perennials. Serpentine species often accumulate Ni to a very high degree, and 
there are usually clearly defined boundaries between serpentine and adjacent vege-
tation. The plant species can even serve as indicator plants for underlying serpentine 
deposits. Within Australia, the most extensive serpentine deposits are adjacent to the 
eastern goldfields of Western Australia. The Hybanthion floribundii Alliance, which 
is characterised by the Ni-hyperaccumulator Hybanthus floribundus and its associ-
ated species Grevillea acuaria, has been defined to cover the serpentine vegetation 
of Western Australia (Severne and Brooks 1972; Brooks et al. 1977).
The Ni-hyperaccumulator Hybanthus floribundus is a widely distributed dwarf to 
small shrub, native to Western Australia; it often occurs on ultramafic outcrops and 
their drainage areas. For the serpentine vegetation of Western Australia, there is a 
positive correlation between stand density and soil Ni concentration within the 
Hybanthus floribundus shrub communities, particularly on soils where Ni concen-
tration exceeds 880 μg g−1 (Severne and Brooks 1972; Brooks et al. 1977). In the 
Mineral Nutrition of Plants in Australia’s Arid Zone

94
eastern goldfields of Western Australia, Severne and Brooks (1972) found that 
nearly all values for Ni concentration fall within a range of 400–3600 μg g−1 in 
rocks, 240–1200 μg g−1 in soils and 40–160 mg g−1 in leaf ash of Hybanthus flori-
bundus. For plants growing in the soil of which the average Ni concentration is only 
670 μg g−1, the highest Ni concentration is over 230 mg g−1 in leaf ash, being over 
10 mg g−1 (up to 14 mg g−1) on a leaf dry weight basis. Hybanthus floribundus not 
only occurs in Western Australia but is also ubiquitous in Victoria, New South Wales 
and South Australia. However, for a specimen of Hybanthus floribundus growing in 
a substrate of unknown composition in Mildura, Victoria, the Ni concentration is 
only 300 μg g−1, only slightly higher than normal background values, indicating that 
not all specimens of this species hyperaccumulate Ni (Severne and Brooks 1972). 
The specimens investigated in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia may well 
be ecotypes adapted to the particular substrate there (Severne and Brooks 1972). 
Due to its Ni-hyperaccumulating capacity, Hybanthus floribundus is considered a 
promising candidate for use in rehabilitation of Ni tailings and phytoremediation of 
Ni-contaminated soils (Kachenko et al. 2008).
For the Ni-hyperaccumulator Hybanthus floribundus, there are several mecha-
nisms involved in Ni accumulation and tolerance. According to results of gas chro-
matography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods, up to 95% of the Ni in 
leaves of Hybanthus floribundus is bound as an anionic citrate complex, and only 
about 5% is bound as a cationic aquo complex (Kersten et al. 1980). In addition to 
complexation, a significant proportion of the Ni in leaf tissues may be compartmen-
talised in the vacuole and bound to cell wall, where the Ni is made physiologically 
inactive (Bidwell 2001). Studies using histochemical techniques and micro-proton-­
induced X-ray emission (micro-PIXE) spectroscopy show that Ni is preferentially 
localised in epidermal cells in leaves and stems of Hybanthus floribundus (Severne 
1974; Bidwell et al. 2004). Although high tissue Ni concentrations may play a role 
in drought tolerance and herbivore deterrence, the selective advantage for plant 
growth and reproduction from Ni hyperaccumulation is still unclear. Nickel hyper-
accumulation remains an interesting topic in plant physiology and biochemistry 
(Severne 1974; Brooks et al. 1998).
Gold
The presence of gold (Au) in plants has been reported in a few cases, and Au con-
centrations and distributions shown by vegetation generally reflect those in the rego-
lith. At three sites in the goldfields of south-western Australia, Au concentrations 
are <0.5 μg kg−1 in dried plants growing in soils with medium soil Au anomaly, 
poorly mineralised or in background areas but up to 11 μg kg−1 in those growing in 
soils which are well mineralised. However, there is no particular genus outstanding 
as an Au accumulator or indicator of mineralisation (Lintern et al. 1997).
Adjuvants such as thiocyanate- or cyanide-induced (hyper)accumulation of Au 
has been reported, highlighting the potential of using plants to extract Au from 
H. He et al.

95
low-­grade ore and waste products (Anderson et  al. 1998, 1999; Piccinin et  al. 
2007). Some native Australian plants such as blue mallee (Eucalyptus polybrac-
tea), black wattle (Acacia decurrens), red grass (Bothriochloa macra), wallaby 
grass (Austrodanthonia caespitosa) and weeping grass (Microlaena stipoides) can 
grow in an ore body with an Au grade of 1.75 g Au ton−1. When these are treated 
with 0.1 mg g−1 or 1 mg g−1 cyanide as aqueous sodium cyanide (NaCN), plants 
grown in the 1 mg g−1 NaCN treatment generally have higher concentrations of Au 
than those grown in the 0.1 mg g−1 NaCN treatment. Gold concentrations in stems 
and older leaves are higher than those in young leaves. For wallaby grass and red 
grass, the Au concentration is 21.6 and 23.8 g ton−1 in the 0.1 mg g−1 NaCN treat-
ment, respectively. For blue mallee and black wattle, the Au concentration in stems 
is 11.1 and 14.8 g ton−1 in the 0.1 mg g−1 NaCN treatment, respectively (Piccinin 
et al. 2007). The use of adjuvants to induce Au (hyper)accumulation should be 
carefully assessed, as higher amendment levels can negatively affect the survival 
and vitality of plants (Anderson et al. 1998). Furthermore, limited translocation of 
Au from roots to shoots may be a limiting factor for the phytoextraction of Au 
(Piccinin et al. 2007).
Concluding Remarks
Plants in Australia’s arid zone exhibit a range of strategies to survive in nutrient-­
impoverished soils. Acacias are capable of N2 fixation and important for N cycling 
in arid ecosystems; they are more severely limited by P than by N, and can use P 
efficiently by mobilising poorly available forms of P through carboxylate exuda-
tion, and resorbing a significant proportion of P from senescing leaves. Non-­
mycorrhizal species such as Grevillea and Hakea (Proteaceae) are also present on 
P-impoverished soils, and they exhibit a range of strategies to ‘mine’ P, use P and 
resorb P efficiently. Other non-mycorrhizal species include hemiparasitic and car-
nivorous species. Biocrusts play a critical role in maintaining soil fertility and affect 
the distribution of limited nutrients, in particular N. Some termites and their symbi-
onts can also fix N2 and affect N cycling. Some plants can accumulate high levels of 
metals such as Mn and Au, and species such as Hybanthus floribundus can hyperac-
cumulate Ni. More knowledge on mineral nutrition of plants in Australia’s arid zone 
should be gained for better ecosystem management.

Ecophysiology of Australian Arid-Zone 
Marsupials
S. Don Bradshaw
Short-sighted indeed are the Anglo-Australians, or they would long ere this have made laws 
for the preservation of their highly singular, and in many cases noble, indigenous animals: 
and doubly short-sighted are they for wishing to introduce into Australia the production of 
other climes…. Let me then urge them to bestir themselves, ere it be too late, to establish 
laws for the preservation of the large kangaroos, the Emu and other conspicuous indige-
nous animals: without such protection the remnant that is left will soon disappear, to be 
followed by unavailing regret for the apathy with which they have been previously regarded. 
(Gould 1863)
Introduction
The suite of marsupials now found inhabiting the arid zone is vastly reduced com-
pared with that which confronted the first European settlers in the late eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries (Woinarski et al. 2015; Burbidge 2009). Early explorers of 
the arid zone described how they needed to erect barriers around their tents to pre-
vent marauding ‘rat kangaroos’ from raiding their stores of biscuits and other provi-
sions. The situation is vastly different today. In the Little Sandy Desert in Western 
Australia, for example, of the 43 mammal species present at the time of European 
settlement, 19 are still present, but a further 19 marsupial species and 6 rodents once 
collected are now regionally extinct (Start et al. 2013; Burbidge et al. 2007).
The loss of species has not been uniform but focuses on marsupials in what has 
become known as the ‘critical weight range’ (CWR) of 35 g–5.5 kg (Burbidge and 
McKenzie 1989). Why species in this particular weight range are more vulnerable 
than others remains a subject of continued interest and debate, with some arguing 
the correlation reflects simply the fact that the majority of recent Australian mam-

mals fall within this size range (Cardillo and Bromham 2001), with another phylo-
genetic analysis failing to find any effect of body mass on the pattern of decline 
among marsupials (Fisher et al. 2003).
A recent careful analysis has shown that the form of the CWR relationship differs 
for ground-dwelling versus tree-dwelling species and for species from low- versus 
high-rainfall areas (Johnson and Isaac 2009). Australian mainland marsupials in the 
CWR were found to be most extinction prone, and the effect was most pronounced 
in ground-dwelling species from areas with low annual rainfall (i.e. the arid zone). 
This conclusion has also been reinforced by a broad analysis of extinction factors 
showing that faunal losses have been greatest in arid regions and lowest in high-
rainfall areas (McKenzie et al. 2007) and by a recent analysis arguing that the CWR 
is also relevant for species in tropical areas of Australia (Murphy and Davies 2014).
As was the case when considering arid-zone reptiles in Chap. 6 arid-zone marsu-
pials must contend with the same environmental contingencies characteristic of arid 
environments, viz.:
	(a)	 High day temperatures that must be tolerated, regulated or avoided
	(b)	 A shortage of available free water that renders difficult
	(c)	 The regulation of water and electrolyte balance
	(d)	 Seasonal deficiencies of nitrogen (protein) and energy (carbohydrate and fat) 
essential for growth and reproduction
The accepted explanation for the vulnerability of CWR species in the arid zone is 
that they are prime targets for the two major marsupial predators, feral cats and 
foxes (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989). Some or all of the factors listed above, how-
ever, may also be involved, as failure to deal adequately with one of these may 
predispose an individual to enhanced levels of predation. It is thus important to be 
able to discern whether a given species is ever exposed to stressful environmental 
conditions (e.g. heat and drought) that reduce its physiological condition and make 
it an easy target for predators.
The Nature of Stress
Documenting the incidence and measuring the intensity of stress responses in free-­
ranging marsupials should be a conservation priority but is as yet a field in its 
infancy (Bradshaw 2007, 2010, 2017). One of the main difficulties is clarifying 
what is meant by stress after it was first defined, somewhat poetically, by Hans 
Selye as a state of non-specific tension in living matter (Selye 1946, 1952). An 
essential step is to distinguish ‘stressors’, emanating from the environment, from 
‘stress’, which is the impact of these on the organism, thus avoiding meaningless 
contradictions such as ‘the stress of reproduction’.
The medical concept of ‘allostasis’ or ‘maintaining stability through change’ 
(Sterling and Eyer 1988) was adopted by McEwen (1998), who proposed that ani-
mals experience an ‘allostatic load’ divided into three levels: A = baseline cortico-
S. D. Bradshaw

105
steroid levels, B = daily and seasonal changes in levels and C = ‘allostatic overload’ 
leading to chronic stress if not alleviated (McEwen and Wingfield 2003). The use of 
the balance between energy expenditure and intake as a measure of allostatic load 
has been criticised by Walsberg (2003), and Michael Romero has countered with an 
innovative ‘reactive scope model’ of stress (Romero et al. 2009; Romero 2012). 
This is based on the concept that reacting to a stress (reactive homeostasis or level 
B in the allostatic system) involves ‘wear and tear’ and erodes the safety gap 
between B and C, leading with chronic exposure to allostatic overload (Fig. 1).
Whatever system one uses, it is obviously important to be able to discern when 
individuals in natural populations cross the threshold between homeostatic adaptive 
responses to environmental stressors and experience ‘allostatic overload’ or stress. 
A recent review of factors influencing the stress response in Australian marsupials, 
for example, documents studies that have measured either plasma or faecal levels of 
glucocorticoids (Hing et al. 2014). Elevated steroid levels alone, however, are not 
necessarily an index of stress (Johnstone et al. 2012) as they form part of the ani-
mal’s normal adaptive response to the stressor (Angelier and Wingfield 2013). 
Opinion is also still divided on whether total levels or non-protein-bound ‘free’ 
levels of corticosteroids are what should be measured in studies of stress (Breuner 
et al. 2013; Schoech et al. 2013, Desantis et al. 2013).
An Operational Definition of Stress
An early simple operational definition proposed for stress, which avoids some of the 
difficulties referred to above, is ‘the physiological resultant of demands that exceed 
an animal’s homeostatic capacities’ (Bradshaw 1997, 1986, 2003). This allows one 
to both discern the incidence of stress and measure its severity. Inherent in the

definition is the understanding that the animal has maximally deployed whatever 
defences it has against the stressor and that, despite this, its internal state or ‘milieu 
intérieur’ has been significantly perturbed. By simultaneously monitoring the extent 
of the animal’s adaptive response to a stressor (e.g. levels of adrenocortical hor-
mones, antidiuretic hormone) along with measures of its internal state (e.g. total 
body water content, plasma osmolality, body temperature), one can effectively 
detect individuals that are in stress. The primary aim of this review is to use eco-
physiological data to identify, where possible, instances of arid-zone marsupials 
evincing stress response to environmental stressors.
High temperatures and lack of water characterise the arid zone, and when con-
sidering the relative impact of the four environmental constraints experienced by 
marsupials listed above, these two would appear to be the most relevant as loss of 
CWR species has been highest in the arid zone since European colonisation.
Temperature Regulation
‘Adaptive Heterothermy’
There have been few studies of thermoregulation of free-ranging marsupials in the 
Australian arid zone, but adaptive heterothermy, described for eutherian mammals, 
has been suggested as a response helping to ameliorate high diurnal temperatures 
(McCarron and Dawson 1989; Brown and Dawson 1977; McCarron et al. 2001). 
Pioneering research by Knut Schmidt-Nielsen with camels (Schmidt-Nielsen et al. 
1956) and Richard Taylor on East African ungulates (Taylor 1970) established the 
paradigm of large arid-zone mammals using heterothermy to conserve water by 
storing heat in the body during the day, which it then lost by radiation at night 
(Bradshaw 2003). Added to this were studies suggesting that in those species pos-
sessing a carotid rete, such as the eland, selective brain cooling operates to protect 
cerebral function from high core body temperatures (Taylor and Lyman 1972). 
Recent studies, however, incorporating body temperature recording from free-­
ranging animals in desert conditions (bio-logging) have questioned this established 
view. Body temperatures of African antelopes, for example, are higher at night than 
during the day (Mitchell et al. 2002). Selective brain cooling as an adaptive response 
has also been questioned. It has never been observed in free-living mammals and 
may be a response restricted to captive animals exposed to heat or exercising on a 
treadmill (Fuller et al. 2014). In a relatively recent review, the authors comment that 
‘With the possible exception of the camel, we doubt that arid-zone mammals use 
adaptive heterothermy at all.’ (Mitchell et al. 2002).
There have been a number of studies of changes in diurnal body temperatures of 
resting arid-zone kangaroos carried out by Terry Dawson and colleagues at the 
Fowlers Gap research station in northern New South Wales. These enable us to pose 
the question of whether these large macropods ever give evidence of stress resulting 
from high environmental temperatures. Using the operational definition of stress

above, this would mean finding evidence of a significant elevation of the body tem-
perature above what is considered to be the normal range, despite the deployment by 
the kangaroo of its full suite of physiological and behavioural defences (e.g. shade 
seeking, sweating, saliva spreading). Thermoregulatory responses of mesic eastern 
grey (Macropus giganteus) and arid red kangaroos (Macropus rufus), held in small 
pens, to ambient temperatures ranging from –5 to 45 °C were compared by Dawson 
et al. (2000). Both species maintained their body temperature within the normal 
range of 36.5–37 °C; the only difference was the slightly lower rates of respiratory 
evaporative water loss of the red kangaroo at 45 °C. Somewhat different results were 
obtained when the same two species were compared while ‘free-­ranging’ in an 8 ha 
enclosure with access to water (McCarron et al. 2001). Body temperatures of the 
eastern grey kangaroos were approximately 2 °C lower than those of red kangaroos 
during the middle of the day and 0.3 °C higher at night (Fig. 2). The daily body 
temperature range of the mesic grey kangaroos was thus higher than that of red 
kangaroos with access to water (2.76 °C vs 1.72 °C) and much higher when denied 
access to water (4.70 °C vs 2.29 °C). Even so, the mean body temperature of the 
eastern greys when denied access to water was still only 36.55 ± 0.40 °C, which 
would not appear to be above its ‘normal’ range and thus not supporting a case for 
thermal stress. The eastern grey, which is normally thought of as a ‘mesic’ species, 
has recently extended its range into the arid zone (Dawson 1995; Dawson et al. 
2006), but the adequacy of its thermoregulatory response would appear to enable it 
to do this without experiencing stress responses or ‘allostatic overload’.

A major and obvious difference between eutherians and marsupials is that the 
latter, with one exception (the numbat), are essentially all nocturnal, or at most cre-
puscular. This means that they are not normally exposed to the full onslaught of the 
arid situation as they are typically active and forage at dawn and dusk and through-
out the night. Although there are few data on the subject, it seems likely that adap-
tive heterothermy in the ‘classical’ context (i.e. as a response to high diurnal 
temperatures) is absent in arid-zone marsupials, but what is very clear is that hetero-
thermy is very important in the group as a response to low, rather than high, tem-
peratures. Hibernation and daily torpor (i.e. temporal heterothermy) have been 
reported in approximately 15% of all marsupials with data from 41 species included 
in a recent review (Riek and Geiser 2014). Deserts and arid zones are rather cold at 
night, because of the lack of cloud cover and the high levels of radiation to the sky, 
and temperature ranges between night and day may be as high as 60 °C (Monod 
1973). Nocturnal animals, such as marsupials inhabiting the arid zone, must thus 
contend with potential heat losses during their prime activity period.
Torpor
Although it might be thought that mammals do not need to utilise torpor in a ‘warm’ 
country such as Australia, there is in fact a large body of literature on the incidence 
and intensity of torpor in Australian marsupials, and it is clear that arid-zone spe-
cies, especially small insectivorous dasyurids, employ it routinely (Geiser 2004; 
Riek and Geiser 2014). Known heterothermic dasyurids range in body size from 6 g 
planigales (Planigale spp.) to the western quoll, Dasyurus geoffroii, weighing 
almost a kilogram (Geiser and Kortner 2010). Minimum body temperatures during 
torpor range from 11 to 15 °C in the smaller species (<100 g) and from 15 to 23 °C 
in larger species (>100 g) with the metabolic rate typically falling to 30–50% of the 
basal metabolic rate (Geiser 2004). Torpor also has a considerable impact on the 
water economy of arid-zone marsupials, with a reduction in absolute evaporative 
water loss (EWL) from 23.5 to 42.3% of normothermic values reported for the 
stripe-faced dunnart, Sminthopsis macroura, in a recent laboratory study (Fig. 3) 
(Cooper et al. 2005).
It is perhaps not surprising that arid-zone species using torpor are primarily 
small carnivores that depend on food sources such as grasshoppers, termites and 
alates that often fluctuate in availability. In captivity, torpor can be readily induced 
in dasyurids by reducing the ambient temperature but also by withholding food 
(Geiser 2003). Field data from Pseudantechinus macdonnellensis, Planigale gilesi 
and the mulgara, Dasycercus blythi, add weight to this. Long torpor bouts of 20 h 
were initiated in up to 100% of days during winter in these free-ranging desert 
dasyurids when food supplies were low (Geiser and Pavey 2007; Pavey and Geiser 
2008; Kortner et al. 2008b; Warnecke and Geiser 2009). Torpor bouts in the field 
may vary from a little as 2 h to as long as 26 h in the stripe-faced dunnart (Sminthopsis 
macroura) (Kortner and Geiser 2011). Female brush-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus

blythi) employ torpor throughout most of their pregnancy, but not during lactation 
(Kortner et al. 2008a). These studies on free-ranging individuals, equipped with 
temperature-­sensitive radio-transmitters, have shown that daily torpor is a crucial 
survival strategy for small dasyurids in the arid zone during the cold months of the 
year and contributes to their long-term persistence in these habitats (Kortner and 
Geiser 2009; Masters and Dickman 2012; Dickman et al. 2001). A recent study on 
the 27 g kaluta (Dasykaluta rosamondae) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia 
has revealed that, during the colder winter months, animals were essentially diurnal 
and retreated into burrows overnight (Kortner et  al. 2010). Torpor also differed 
between males and females, with females torpid at body temperatures of 21 °C 
throughout the night, whereas males entered multiple short and shallow bouts dur-
ing the night (Fig. 4). The sandy inland mouse, Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, 
also displays an unusual response to low environmental temperatures, falling into 
torpor but apparently lacking the ability to arouse spontaneously (Tomlinson et al. 
2007). As spontaneous arousal forms part of the accepted definition of ‘torpor’ 
(Lyman et al. 1982), this appears to be an instance of ‘adaptive hypothermia’ in an 
arid-zone marsupial, rather than torpor.

Given the substantial change in the milieu intérieur of the torpid animal (i.e. the 
dramatic fall in body temperature and reduced metabolic rate), it is reasonable to 
ask whether torpor is a stress response. Our ‘operational definition’ of stress ‘the 
physiological resultant of demands that exceed an animal’s homeostatic capacities’ 
mandates, however, that the animal is ‘attempting’ to maintain its normal level of 
homeostasis, despite the stressor. In the case of torpor, the animal clearly ‘aban-
dons’ the normal physiological processes that maintain its body temperature within 
a narrow range, allowing it to fall close to ambient levels. Recent work on the endo-
crinological and molecular mechanisms underlying torpor in mammals has identi-
fied leptin as a key factor in initiating recovery from torpor bouts. Leptin, a peptide 
hormone, is produced by lipid tissue and is thought to relay nutritional status from 
peripheral fat stores to sites within the hypothalamus, especially the arcuate nucleus 
(Sahu 2003). The other hormone that has been implicated is ghrelin, secreted by the 
stomach which activates neuropeptide Y neurones (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus, 
leading to increased food intake and rate of metabolism (Swoap 2008). 
Thyroidectomy has also long been known to disrupt torpor in mammals by uncou-
pling mitochondrial heat production (Bechtold and Loudon 2007), and recent 
research has found that type 3 deiodinase reduces the availability of tri-­iodothyronine 
(T3, the active form of the hormone thyroxine) in the hypothalamus, initiating torpor 
in Siberian hamsters (Murphy et  al. 2011). Recent studies implicate the 
­melatonin-­expressing cells in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary as the source of the 
information passed to hypothalamic tanycytes, where the deiodinase is expressed 
(Scherbarth and Steinlechner 2010). All this research has been undertaken in euthe-
rian mammals, but data suggesting that leptin levels may also be involved in the 
initiation of torpor in marsupials is supported by a study with the stripe-faced dunn-
art, Sminthopsis macroura, in which leptin treatment halved the duration of torpor 
bouts in animals deprived of food for 24 h (Geiser et al. 1998).

Torpor in marsupials is thus not a stress response1 but an apparently adaptive 
regulated response to an unfavourable energy balance, whereby normal homeostatic 
maintenance of body temperature by increased metabolism is temporarily uncou-
pled, allowing the body temperature to fall with significant savings in energy expen-
diture. Marsupials also lack brown fat, the metabolically highly active tissue in 
eutherian mammals that is used to restore body temperature from torpor bouts, and 
a number of studies have identified the importance of solar basking and huddling 
behaviour in rewarming of marsupials (Geiser and Pavey 2007; Pavey and Geiser 
2008; Warnecke and Geiser 2009; Tomlinson et al. 2014). Basking during rewarm-
ing from torpor has been reported in at least four small dasyurids (Planigale gilesi 
(8  g), Sminthopsis crassicaudata (10  g), Sminthopsis macroura (15  g) and 
Pseudantechinus macdonnellensis (31 g)) with basking commencing approximately 
3 h after sunrise when their body temperatures range from 13.8 to 19.3 °C (Warnecke 
and Geiser 2009, Geiser and Kortner 2010). The significant saving of energy expen-
diture by these small arid-zone marsupials through the reduction in metabolic rate 
and access to solar energy during passive rewarming from daily torpor has been 
estimated at 80% (Warnecke et al. 2008).
Water and Electrolyte Balance
Low availability of free water is the other primary factor characterising the arid 
zone, and animals living there must contend with this potential stressor. Rates of 
water turnover in free-ranging marsupials have been measured using tritiated water 
(3HHO) in a wide range of species and vary allometrically with body mass (Nagy 
and Peterson 1988; Nagy 1994). The exponent of the relationship in macropodid 
marsupials varies from 0.82 to 0.87 (Green 1997), which is higher than 0.75, the 
exponent for metabolic rate of eutherian mammals, and also much higher than the 
exponent for the field metabolic rate (FMR) of marsupials at 0.69. This means that, 
as body mass increases, water turnover does not decrease on a mass-specific basis 
as rapidly as metabolic rate. This discrepancy between the two exponents, with 
respect to water, means that larger marsupials require relatively more water for a 
given energy intake than smaller animals and thus may have more difficulty obtain-
ing their daily water requirements from their food. This question was explored in an 
early paper with data from two species of kangaroos, the red kangaroo and the euro, 
Macropus robustus, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (Main and Bakker 
1981). Males are twice the size of females in both species, and, with the onset of the 
dry season, males were found to lose body mass in contrast to females, which 
retained their initial mass. The authors interpreted this as evidence of differential 
dehydration in the larger males, which was supported by the first field study of euros 
by Tim Ealey (Ealey 1967; Ealey and Main 1967; Main 1970).

they would be of interest.

The Quokka
Evidence of stress due to lack of water is difficult to establish in these kangaroo 
species, because of the lack of information on regulatory hormonal responses, and 
a case study of a small macropodid wallaby, the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) 
(Fig. 5), is informative as an example, providing details of the nature of the data 
required. The quokka is originally a forest dweller, not an arid-zone species but a 
relictual population that survives on Rottnest Island 20 km off the coast of Perth in 
Western Australia, where there is no free water and the environment is severely 
degraded due to fire and overgrazing (Bradshaw 1983; Pen and Green 1983). There 
are a number of hypersaline lakes on the island, formed by intrusions from the 
ocean, and seeps into these lakes are all brackish. Quokkas living close to the lakes 
drink at these soaks, and a study was undertaken in late summer to determine 
whether this marginal intake of water would benefit lakeside dwellers compared 
with quokkas living on the dry West End of the island (Jones et al. 1990).
Table 1 compares rates of water and sodium turnover of quokkas living in the 
two habitats – both rates are substantially lower in the West End animals. Table 2 
gives information on the body mass and condition of the two populations, along 
with plasma levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, lysine rather than arginine vaso-
pressin in these marsupials), plasma osmolality and urine function. What is evident 
is that the West End animals are in poorer condition, have very high levels of ADH 
and have a significantly elevated plasma osmolality. They thus exemplify our opera-
tional definition of stress: a significant perturbation of the milieu intérieur (raised 
plasma osmolality), despite the maximal deployment of regulatory responses (the

costeroid levels of quokkas in late summer also shows that the HPA axis is chroni-
cally stimulated, with a highly significant negative correlation with body condition 
(Fig. 6) (Miller and Bradshaw 1979).
Barrow Island Macropods
A long-term study of the ecophysiology of a suite of marsupials on Barrow Island, 
some 1400 km north of Perth in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, has pro-
vided valuable insights into the level of adaptation of arid-zone species (Bradshaw 
1992). Barrow Island is Australia’s foremost A-Class Reserve, harbouring 13 mam-
mal species, 8 of them marsupial, of which 4 are either extinct on the mainland of 
Australia or virtually so (Moro and Lagdon 2013). Normally when rates of

water turnover and FMR are measured in free-ranging animals, the study involves 
only single species, with perhaps a seasonal component. The study of Barrow 
Island, however, involved 12 vertebrate species (including a lizard and a bird) all 
measured simultaneously in different seasons over a 4-year period. Rates of metab-
olism in the field can then be used as ‘metabolic currency’ to compare the differen-
tial impact on available resources of the many vertebrates inhabiting this 234 km2 
arid island. Six marsupial species were included in the study, and variation in rates 
of water turnover was assessed using doubly-labelled water. An earlier study on the 
spectacled hare-wallaby, Lagorchestes conspicillatus, on Barrow Island had already 
established that this species has an extremely slow rate of water turnover in the dri-
est part of the year, averaging 47.1 ± 4.1 mL.kg-0.82.day−1, which equates to only 
5.1 ± 0.6% of its total body water content per day (Bakker and Bradshaw 1989).
An allometric comparison of rates of water turnover and FMR of Australian 
marsupials, using the doubly-labelled water method, shows that both parameters are 
substantially lower in arid-zone marsupials than in species inhabiting mesic habi-
tats (Fig. 7) (Nagy and Bradshaw 2000). Rates of water turnover were compared in 
four species of macropodids on Barrow Island in the wet season (summer/autumn 
with cyclonic rains) and the dry winter season over a 5-year period in the 1990s 
(King and Bradshaw 2008). The species were the dwarf Barrow Island euro kanga-
roo, Macropus robustus isabellinus; the spectacled hare-wallaby; the black-footed 
rock wallaby, Petrogale lateralis; and Lesueur’s bettong or ‘boodie’, Bettongia 
lesueur. Water influx rates were highest in bettongs during the dry season at 
79.6 ± 6.1 mL.kg–0.82.day−1 and lowest in the hare wallaby, averaging 28.2 ± 6.1 mL.
kg–0.82.day−1, with the other two species intermediate between these values (Fig. 8). 
The water turnover has also been expressed as the percentage of the animal’s total 
body water content exchanged per day, and the high fraction for the bettongs 
(13.98 ± 0.6%) contrasts with that for the hare wallabies (3.51 ± 0.4%). The latter 
is an extraordinarily slow rate of water turnover for a desert mammal. Rates of 
water turnover in summer in desert rodents from southern Tunisia, for example, 
average between 15.3 and 21.8% of the total body water content per day (Bradshaw 
et  al. 1976). There were no significant differences between plasma osmolality 
recorded in the dry and wet seasons for any of the macropods on Barrow Island; 
urine osmolality, however, was significantly elevated in hare wallabies in the dry 
season, averaging 2256 ­mOsm.kg−1.
In evaluating the impact of the many vertebrate species that inhabit Barrow 
Island, and measuring the way in which they share scarce resources, the FMR can 
be used as ‘metabolic currency’ to compare the environmental cost of different 
lifestyles. If one takes the FMR of a single euro kangaroo (approximately 96 L of 
CO2 per animal per day) as our unit of measurement, then multiplying this by the 
­estimate number of euros on the island2 gives total energy turnover by euros in 
2 There are no accurate population estimates for Barrow Island marsupials, but available data from 
transects have been aggregated and then extrapolated, based on the area surveyed. As this assumes 
that animals are uniformly distributed across the island, the estimates generated are thus upper 
limits. SHORT, J. & TURNER, B. 1991. Distribution and abundance of Spectacled hare-wallabies

dant golden bandicoots have an energetic impact larger than the euros, followed by 
hare wallabies, then the giant varanid lizard, the perentie, and then burrowing bet-
tongs. The energetic impact of other small vertebrates, including native rodents, 
dragon lizards and the spinifex bird, is trivial in comparison.
The Barrow Island Euro
Seasonal variation in water and electrolyte balance were studied over a 5-year 
period in the euro, and plasma levels of ADH (lysine vasopressin) were also mea-
sured for the first time in this species (King and Bradshaw 2008). Plasma ADH 
levels increased with plasma osmolality and were negatively correlated with total 
body water content. Mean concentrations ranged from 2.1 ± 0.6 pg.mL−1 in June 
1995, the wettest year of the study, to 16.7 ± 4.6 pg.mL−1 in November 1994, fol-
lowing an 8-month drought, when total rainfall for that year was only 54 mm. This 
was composed of 50 mm in February and 4 mm in December. The average annual 
rainfall for Barrow Island is 320 mm (Moro and Lagdon 2013).

plasma osmolality, plasma cortisol levels and plasma ADH and a reduced eosino-
phil count (King and Bradshaw 2010). Plasma cortisol levels and eosinophil counts 
were also significantly negatively correlated (Fig. 10), suggesting that the exposure 
was chronic and compromising the euros’ immune capabilities (Sapolsky et  al. 
2000; Davis et al. 2008). Euros suffered from a regenerative normative hypochro-
mic anaemia, not found in mainland animals, compromising their respiratory 
capacities and severely limiting any sustained activity (Billiards et al. 1999). Despite 
their small body size, and high surface/volume ratio, the euros have a low rate of 
water turnover in the dry time of the year and a water economy index (WEI = water 
influx/FMR) characteristic of arid-adapted marsupials (Nagy and Bradshaw 2000).

ing that the increased plasma osmolality may not have been the result of simple 
dehydration. Levels of ADH, although elevated, were nowhere near as high as those 
measured in quokkas from the West End of Rottnest Island, suggesting that the 
euros were experiencing a very high ‘allostatic load’ but had not yet reached ‘allo-
static overload’ (King and Bradshaw 2010).
Desert Wallabies
Seasonal changes in water and electrolyte balance and kidney function have been 
studied in two species of wallabies in the arid Pilbara region of Western Australia: 
the spectacled hare-wallaby, Lagorchestes conspicillatus, again on Barrow Island, 
and Rothschild’s rock wallaby, Petrogale rothschildi, on Enderby Island in the 
Dampier Archipelago (Fig. 11) (Bradshaw et al. 2001). Although both species are 
nocturnal feeders, they differ markedly in the nature of their daytime refugia. The 
hare wallaby shelters in large clumps of spinifex (Triodia spp.) during the day, 
whereas the rock wallaby shelters in caves and rock piles. Temperatures in the spi-
nifex clumps often exceed 40 °C during the summer months, and the air is very dry, 
whereas cave sites are much cooler, with high constant humidity.
Data on rates of water turnover and water and electrolyte homeostasis for the two 
wallabies during the driest part of the year are presented in Table 3. There are no 
significant differences between plasma electrolyte concentrations, plasma osmolal-
ity and total body water content for the two species, indicating that they are both 
effectively maintaining homeostasis at this time. Rates of water influx, however, 
differ substantially, and the figure of 27.5 ± 2.0 mL.kg–0.82day−1 is the lowest rate of 
water turnover yet reported for any mammal worldwide.
A comparison of kidney function in the field during the dry and the wet months 
of the year revealed major differences between the two species (Fig. 12) (Bradshaw 
et al. 2001; Bakker and Bradshaw 1989). Hare wallabies show a pronounced antidi-
uresis in the dry season, accompanied by a large increase in urine concentration (U/
POSM) and a very significant increase in plasma ADH levels. This is a standard 
response from a mammal and what one would expect when challenged by water 
deprivation. The rock wallabies, on the other hand, respond with an antidiuresis (not 
as effective), but there is no change in the concentration of the urine being elabo-
rated (U/Posm) nor any significant increase in plasma ADH levels. A detailed analysis 
of kidney function, involving measurement of rates of glomerular filtration and 
renal plasma flow (RPF), revealed that the rock wallabies in the dry season were 
reducing rates of blood flow to the kidney and hence reducing glomerular filtration 
(GFR) rather than increasing the rate of water reabsorption from the renal tubules 
(Bradshaw et al. 2001). This marked difference in renal function between the two 
species is shown in Fig. 13.

which the lack of a hormonal antidiuretic response to water deprivation has been

detected. Despite this, it is clear that the species is able to deal effectively with the 
challenges of its arid environment and it owes this to the protection provided by its 
cave or rockpile habitat. Its response to water deprivation is reminiscent of that 
often seen in reptiles, with a reduction in glomerular filtration, rather than an 
increase in reclamation of filtered water (Dantzler and Bradshaw 2009; Ford and 
Bradshaw 2006). Lysine vasopressin is present in the plasma of the rock wallaby, 
but further work is needed to establish whether it acts via cyclic-AMP to increase 
water permeability of the renal tubules in this species or whether it has lost this 
primary function (Morel 1983). There is no evidence that either species of wallaby 
experiences ‘allostatic overload’ or stress, even during the longest drought recorded 
in 1994 on Barrow Island. The vital role of habitat in enabling the rock wallaby to 
persist in this arid habitat is paramount, however, and without a cool, humid refuge 
to which it can retreat during daylight hours, it would be unable to survive. By way 
of contrast, the hare wallaby provides another example of the extent to which 
­physiological adaptations can facilitate survival and persistence in challenging envi-
ronments (Bradshaw 1992, 2007).
Seasonal Deficiencies of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Energy
The last of the major factors confronting animals that inhabit the arid zone is the one 
least documented, despite its importance. It is primarily a concern of herbivorous 
species, as the food of carnivores is generally much more nitrogen, phosphorus and 
energy-dense than plant products (Prosser et al. 1950; Withers 1992). Nitrogen in 
the form of protein varies seasonally in most plants, falling to extremely low levels 
in arid-zone species. By reconstituting the diet of free-ranging macropods from fae-
cal analysis of epidermal fragments (Storr 1963), the nitrogen concentration as per-
cent dry weight of the diet of euro (Macropus robustus) and red kangaroos (Macropus 
rufus), for example, was found to range from 1.6 to as low as 0.8% (Main 1970). 
Nitrogen levels in spinifex grasses (Triodia spp.) fall to even lower levels and pres-
ent a major challenge for the maintenance of nitrogen balance and growth in arid-­
zone marsupials.
A series of studies on the energetics of arid-zone kangaroos, carried out at the 
Fowlers Gap research station in New South Wales, has highlighted the large differ-
ence between marsupial and eutherian herbivores. Both the basal metabolic rate and 
field metabolic rate (FMR) of kangaroos are lower than those of similar-sized euthe-
rian mammals, such as sheep, and a ‘dry sheep equivalent’ (DSE) of 0.7 is usually 
used when calculating rates of resource utilisation (Munn et al. 2009; Dawson and 
Munn 2007). This difference has usually been attributed to the significantly lower 
basal metabolic rate of marsupials, compared with that of eutherian mammals 
(Dawson and Hulbert 1970), but has been tempered somewhat by the compilation 
of data on the field metabolic rate (FMR) of free-ranging marsupials. Whereas the 
allometric exponent of FMR with body mass in eutherians is 0.75 (similar to that of 
basal metabolic rate), in marsupials the exponent for FMR is much lower at 0.69 
Ecophysiology of Australian Arid-Zone Marsupials

122
(Nagy 2005; Nagy et al. 1999; Riek and Bruggeman 2013). This means that the 
FMR of small marsupials is higher than that of equivalent-sized eutherian mammals 
but substantially lower in the case of large marsupials, such as kangaroos. A recent 
analysis of FMR in Australian marsupials revealed strong phylogenetic correla-
tions, with macropods having significantly lower FMRs than carnivorous marsupi-
als (Riek and Bruggeman 2013). FMR also scales positively with body mass in 
marsupials, in contrast to the situation in eutherian mammals where total population 
energy use is independent of species’ body mass (Munn et al. 2013).
As well as having lower rates of energy turnover in the field, it has also been sug-
gested that marsupials have lower protein requirements in their diet than eutherians, 
because there should be a close relationship between basal metabolic rate and rates 
of whole-body protein synthesis (Hume 1999). Few species have been studied to 
date, but rates of protein synthesis in the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), the 
Parma wallaby (M. parma) (White et al. 1988), the wombat (Vombatus ursinus) 
(Barboza et al. 1993) and the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) (Bradshaw and 
Bradshaw 2001) are all well below levels reported in eutherians (Waterlow 1984). 
Nitrogen cycling to the fermentative foregut of macropods has also been posited as 
one of the mechanisms employed by arid-zone herbivores to offset the low levels of 
protein in plants available in summer (Kinnear et al. 1979).
Laboratory studies with a number of species of macropods have shown that they 
are resistant to the usual nitrogen-mobilising diabetogenic effect of the steroid hor-
mone cortisol (Griffiths et al. 1969; McDonald and Bradshaw 1981). This is not a 
general marsupial characteristic, however, as cortisol injections increase nitrogen 
excretion and elevate blood glucose levels in brush-tailed possums (Trichosurus 
vulpecula) (McDonald and Than 1976; McDonald 1977). Cortisol is a catabolic 
steroid released in response to stressors, such as starvation, and stimulates gluco-
neogenesis through the breakdown of tissue protein with the release of nitrogen that 
is normally excreted. In the case of arid-zone macropods, however, the nitrogen 
would appear to be reabsorbed through the kidney, rather than excreted, and redi-
rected to the microbial population in the animal’s foregut, where it is synthesised 
into bacterial protein and subsequently digested (Kinnear and Main 1975). This 
would appear to be a very effective adaptation that may have evolved in these spe-
cies to offset the problem of seasonal deficiencies in dietary protein (Kinnear and 
Main 1979). Little is known of the precise mechanism of urea recycling, however, 
although a study of the effects of dehydration and protein deficiency in the specta-
cled hare-wallaby found that relative urea clearance (CUREA/CIN) is positively cor-
related with the rate of urine production (Bakker and Bradshaw 1983). Both 
dehydration and protein deficiency resulted in a decrease in the glomerular filtration 
rate (measured as inulin clearance CIN) and a decrease in urea clearance with a fall 
in nitrogen excretion. Exposure to high-protein diets in this desert wallaby resulted 
in a ‘protein diuresis’, and the authors of the study suggest that urea recycling in this 
macropodid is obligatory and reflects the low level of protein in its spinifex-­
dominated diet (Bakker and Bradshaw 1983).
Another important discovery is the major difference in nitrogen metabolism of 
marsupials compared with that of eutherian mammals involving endogenous urinary 
S. D. Bradshaw

123
nitrogen excretion (EUN). EUN is estimated by regressing urinary nitrogen excre-
tion against truly digestible nitrogen intake and extrapolating the curve to zero 
intake, where the measured loss is taken as obligatory. In eutherian mammals it is 
well established that approximately 2 mg of EUN is excreted for each kcal (4.184 kJ) 
of basal heat production (Smuts 1935), and it has been assumed that the lower EUN 
found in marsupials is a direct consequence of their lower basal metabolic rate 
(Hume 1999). When data from a range of marsupials are examined, however, a 
highly significant, but very different, relationship from that observed in eutherian 
mammals is found (Fig. 14). When expressed per kcal of heat production, marsupi-
als excrete only 0.34 mg of nitrogen, not 2 mg, and this figure is, of course, cor-
rected for the difference in basal metabolic rate (Bradshaw and Bradshaw 2001). 
Such a fundamental biochemical difference between marsupials and eutherian 
mammals is unexpected, and its mechanism and significance remain to be explored, 
but it does suggest that the separate dictates of marsupial evolution have resulted in 
a different balance between energy and nitrogen metabolism from that in 
eutherians.
Conclusion
Ecophysiology is the study of the physiological responses of organisms to the eco-
logical dictates of their environment. It involves the study of animals in their natural 
environment, rather than in the confines of laboratories. An operational definition of 
stress as ‘the physiological resultant of demands that exceed an animal’s

mals. Data for eutherians are taken from Smuts (1935) and data for marsupials from Hume (1999) 
and Bradshaw and Bradshaw (2001). The linear regression equation for eutherians is 
EUN = 0.45BMR + 4.44, r2 = 0.999 and for marsupials is EUN = 0.08BMR + 19.24, r2 = 0.96.

homeostatic capacities’ has been used to search for instances of stress in arid-zone 
marsupials due to high temperatures and lack of water. The recent use of body tem-
perature loggers in free-ranging animals has shown that ‘adaptive heterothermy’ 
and selective brain cooling, first described in camels and African ungulates, do not 
occur in kangaroos, which maintain normothermia over a wide range of ambient 
temperatures. Torpor, on the other hand, is widely employed by arid-zone marsupi-
als, especially those with low body mass, to offset the low night temperatures also 
characteristic of the arid zone. Torpor in marsupials, however, is not a stress but an 
adaptive regulated response to an unfavourable energy balance, whereby normal 
homeostatic maintenance of body temperature is uncoupled, allowing body tem-
perature to fall with significant savings in energy expenditure. Significant perturba-
tions of water and electrolyte balance in arid-zone marsupials are also rare, and, 
even in the driest year ever recorded on Barrow Island, only one species, the Barrow 
Island euro Macropus robustus isabellinus, showed signs of an increased allostatic 
load, but not ‘allostatic overload’, or stress. The spectacled hare-wallaby, 
Lagorchestes conspicillatus, serves as an exemplar of the level of adaptation by 
some arid-zone marsupials, having the lowest rate of water loss yet recorded for any 
mammal worldwide. This contrasts with the Rothschild’s rock wallaby, Petrogale 
rothschildi, which lacks hormonal control over water loss by the kidney but survives 
in a similar habitat to that of the hare wallaby by its reliance during daylight hours 
on cool and humid caves and rockpile shelters to conserve water. Nutritional adapta-
tions are also evident; these aid with seasonal deficiencies of nitrogen and energy in 
herbivorous species. The lower field metabolic rate of arid-zone compared with 
mesic species of marsupials, especially macropods, results in lower levels of food 
intake, and urea recycling helps offset exceptionally low protein levels in the diet. 
Rates of protein turnover also appear to be lower in marsupial than in eutherian 
mammals, and the linkage between obligatory nitrogen loss from the body in the 
form of endogenous urinary excretion and basal energy production is almost six 
times lower in marsupials. Arid-zone marsupials thus appear physiologically and 
behaviourally well buffered to withstand the rigours of their habitat, but the environ-
mental changes wrought by European colonisation of the continent increasingly put 
these adaptations to the test. If the predications of current climate change scenarios 
do eventuate, stress responses seen in species such as the Rottnest Island quokka 
will likely in the not-too-distant future be observed in arid-zone species.

Glossary
CWR  The critical weight range of 35 g–5.5 kg for which Australian marsupials 
have been found most vulnerable to extinction.
Stress  An unfavourable body condition originally defined by Hans Selye as ‘a state 
of non-specific tension in living matter’.
Stressor  An environmental factor that will provoke stress if sustained.
Allostasis  Originally conceived as ‘maintaining stability through change’ and 
introduced into the medical literature to deal with situations, such as fever, where 
the body changes to a new regulated state, with a change in the set point for body 
temperature. The concept has been developed by biologists who have introduced 
the concept of ‘allostatic load’, which can be monitored through changes in cir-
culating levels of adrenal corticosteroids.
Glucocorticoids  Steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands in vertebrates 
that are released under stressful conditions and act to mobilise glucose reserves 
in the body.
Allostatic overload  A condition equivalent to chronic stress.
‘milieu intérieur’  The ‘internal environment’ of animals identified by the French 
physiologist, Claude Bernard in 1878, as the closely regulated condition com-
mon to all vertebrate animals and on which their independence from the external 
environment depends.
Homeostasis (also homoiostasis)  The term introduced by the American physiolo-
gist, Walter Cannon in 1929, to describe the process by which the ‘internal envi-
ronment’ of vertebrates is protected from change.
ADH  Antidiuretic hormone, which is secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary 
gland and, when released into the blood, stimulates reabsorption of water from 
the kidney of vertebrates, reducing urine production and assisting in coping with 
water deprivation and dehydration.
Heterothermy  Significant variation throughout the day in body temperature – as 
opposed to homeothermy in which body temperature is maintained between nar-
row limits.
Adaptive heterothermy  The process originally described in desert camels whereby 
they contend with excessive heat by allowing their body temperature to rise, thus 
storing heat that may then be lost at night by radiation.
Carotid rete  A group of specialised blood vessels in the base of the brain of some 
mammals that operates to cool warmed blood flowing to the brain by countercur-
rent exchange.
Crepuscular  Animals that commence their activity at dawn and dusk.
Torpor  A condition in which an animal ceases activity for a period of time and is 
associated with a significant fall in both body temperature and metabolic rate. 
Torpor may last for hours or days and is truncated by spontaneous arousal of the 
animal with a rapid rise in its body temperature back to normal levels.
Leptin  Often known as the ‘satiety hormone’, is a hormone produced by fat cells 
that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger.
Ecophysiology of Australian Arid-Zone Marsupials

126
Ghrelin  Also called the ‘hunger hormone’ is a peptide hormone, made up of a 
small number of amino acids, that is produced by cells in the intestinal tract and 
acts on the central nervous system to increase appetite.
Arcuate nucleus  A group of nerve cell bodies in the hypothalamus of the brain 
that contain important neurotransmitters involved in controlling hormone release 
from the pituitary gland.
Neuropeptide Y  Neurones (NPY) are also located in the arcuate nucleus and are 
important in the regulation of appetite.
Tanycytes  Special cells found in the brain and on the floor of the fourth ventricle, 
which have processes extending deep into the hypothalamus. It is thought that 
their function is to transfer chemical signals from the cerebrospinal fluid to the 
central nervous system.
Thyroidectomy  Removal of the thyroid gland.
Deiodinase  Specific enzymes that break down the hormone thyroxin (T4) by suc-
cessively removing iodine molecules.
Iodothyronine (T3)  The active form of the hormone thyroxin, which has three mol-
ecules of iodine instead of four.
Pars tuberalis  A group of cells located around the stalk of the pituitary gland that 
contain hormone-secreting cells.
Brown fat  Highly metabolically active tissue found in eutherian mammals that 
produces heat to restore the normal body temperature of torpid mammals. Brown 
fat is not found in marsupials, which recover from torpor by shivering.
ADH (anti-diuretic hormone)  A hormone secreted by the posterior lobe of the 
pituitary gland, which acts on the kidney to enhance reabsorption of water from 
the urine when animals are dehydrated or water deprived.
HPA axis (hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis)  Many of the hormones secreted 
by the pituitary gland (e.g. growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, adre-
nocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), etc.) are controlled by small molecule ‘releas-
ing factors’ elaborated in the hypothalamus of the brain and transported to the 
pituitary gland by a dedicated portal blood supply. Stressors act via the HPA to 
activate secretion of hormones, firstly from the pituitary gland, which then go on 
to stimulate other glands in the body, such as the adrenals.
Doubly-labelled water  This is water where the heavy isotope of oxygen (18O) 
replaces normal oxygen (16O) and hydrogen is replaced by either deuterium (2H) 
or radioactive tritium (3H). When injected into animals, the differential turnover 
of the two isotopes enables one to measure the rate of carbon dioxide production 
in free-ranging animals and hence their field metabolic rate (FMR).
Macropodids  Marsupial species belonging to the family Macropodidae (large 
foot) which includes the kangaroos and wallabies.
Osmolality  The osmotic pressure of a liquid that is a function the number of 
molecular components dissolved in the fluid (e.g. plasma or urine).
Water economy index (WEI)  The ratio of water influx to FMR and a measure of 
animal’s adaptation to low water regimes.
Eosinophil  One type of white-blood cell and one of the immune system’s compo-
nents responsible for combating multicellular parasites and certain infections in 
S. D. Bradshaw

127
vertebrates. Their numbers are often used as a measure of the competence of the 
animal’s immune system.
Anaemia  A reduction in the number of red cells in the blood, and its haemoglobin 
content, resulting in a lowering of the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
U/POSM  The ratio of the osmotic pressure of the urine relative to the plasma is a 
measure of the concentrating capacity of the kidney and increases when animals 
are water deprived.
Renal plasma flow (RPF)  The rate at which blood flows through the kidneys.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  The rate at which blood is filtered in the kidney 
to produce urine. GFR is usually measured by the rate of clearance of inulin, a 
plant polysaccharide, and expressed as CIN.
COSM/CIN  Relative osmolar clearance.
Dry sheep equivalent (DSE)  The amount of energy that a marsupial requires per 
day compared with a similar-sized sheep. The figure of 0.7 is usually quoted and 
reflects the fact that the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of marsupials is approxi-
mately 30% lower than that of eutherian mammals.
‘Diabetogenic’ effect of steroid hormones  So-called because steroids such as cor-
tisol and corticosterone increase blood sugar levels when injected.
CUREA/CIN  Relative urea clearance and the amount of urea cleared from the blood 
relative to the rate of glomerular filtration.

Introduction
The Australian arid zone supports a diverse lizard and snake fauna that is signifi-
cantly more species-rich than that of other arid regions in the world (Pianka 1986; 
Morton and James 1988; Powney et al. 2010). The precise origins of this fauna are, 
however, still the subject of research and some dispute. There is clear evidence for 
a Gondwanan origin for many components of the Australian fauna, e.g., mono-
tremes, marsupials, passerine birds, parrots, ratites and chelid turtles, but the case 
for lizards and snakes is less clear. The arid zone was also not always arid, and it is 
only since the early Miocene that it started to take its present form (Martin 2006). A 
case for the Gondwanan origin of agamid lizards, with a 150-million-year diver-
gence date between Southeast Asian and Australasian agamids based on mitochon-
drial DNA, was made by Schulte et al. (2003). The study was criticised, however, 
for methodological flaws, and a reanalysis of their data, along with the addition of 
nuclear (c-mos) sequences, pushed the date of this implied separation back to 
approximately 30 MYA (Hugall and Lee 2004). This would make an Asian origin 
for the Australian agamids by rafting and island hopping plausible, as the 
Australasian tectonic plate approached the Asian continent. Amongst the Australian 
agamids, two species stand out as being basal to the radiation and much older than 
other groups: the chameleon dragon, Chelosonia brunnea, and the mountain devil, 
Moloch horridus (Hugall et al. 2008), with the latter invading the developing arid 
zone long before any other agamid. The current consensus is in favour of an Asian 
origin for the agamids, dating to the early Miocene, which was followed by an 
extensive adaptive radiation of the group in the arid zone. There is one group of

lizards, however, where a case for Gondwanan origin is compelling: the geckos and 
pygopodids (Oliver and Sanders 2009; Oliver and Bauer 2011). Molecular phylog-
enies indicate that at least five Australian lineages of diplodactyloid gecko, with 
wide distributions in the arid zone, are as old or older than elapid snakes and aga-
mids. The snake-like pygopodids appear to have radiated before Australia was occu-
pied by snakes, and recent research suggest that the Australian elapids have evolved 
from primitive sea kraits (Laticaudia) that may have swum the sea gap from Asia 
and come ashore in a snake-deficient continent (Scanlon and Lee 2004; Underwood 
1957).
A strong case for an Asian, rather than Gondwanan origin, can also be made for 
the varanid lizards (Fuller et al. 1998). Molecular analyses reveal the existence of 
three monophyletic clades: an African, Indo-Asian and an Indo-Australian clade. 
Within the Indo-Australia clade, the endemic dwarf monitors (Odatria) form a 
clade sister to the large Australian monitors (the gouldii group) (Ast 2001). These 
studies thus indicate that the squamate fauna of the Australian arid zone is com-
posed of both old Gondwanan (geckos and pygopodids) and more recent Asian 
elements (agamid lizards, skinks, elapid snakes and varanids).
Despite this wide diversity displayed in their phylogenetic origins, all of the 
reptiles inhabiting the Australian arid zone must contend with the same environ-
mental contingencies that characterise arid environments worldwide, viz.:
	(a)	 High day temperatures through summer that must be tolerated, regulated, or 
avoided
	(b)	 A deficiency of available free water that renders difficult
	(c)	 The regulation of water and electrolyte balance
	(d)	 Seasonal deficiencies of nitrogen (protein), phosphorus and energy (carbohy-
drate) essential for growth and reproduction
Temperature Regulation
Following the pioneering study of Cowles and Bogert on North American desert 
lizards (Cowles and Bogert 1944), early publications on Australian lizards in the 
arid zone focused on thermoregulation. The concept of ‘ectotherms’ with an 
‘eccritic’ or ‘preferred body temperature’ (PBT), resulting from active choice on the 
part of the animal in a thermal gradient, was established, and early surveys com-
pared mean body temperatures of lizards active in the field (MBT) with their PBT 
determined in the laboratory (Licht et al. 1966; Heatwole 1970; Bradshaw and Main 
1968). Although originally thought to be an unvarying and conservative feature of 
the thermal biology of different reptilian taxa, detailed field studies showed that the 
MBT actually represents a compromise between physiological preferences and eco-
logical opportunities (Avery 1982; Cogger 1974). Various studies aimed at measur-
ing the accuracy of thermoregulation of arid-zone species have shown, however, 
S. D. Bradshaw

135
that this can be quite precise. A single specimen of Australia’s largest terrestrial 
reptile, the perentie, Varanus giganteus, which is widespread in the arid zone, was 
radio-tracked for a period of 7 days by King et al. (1989) on Barrow Island. The 
authors found that its body temperature during the day was relatively constant, aver-
aging 35.8 °C when active, similar to that of other varanid species (Pianka 1986). 
The body temperature did not fall below 30 °C at night, however, due to the thermal 
buffering of its large body mass (8.8 kg).
Thermoregulatory precision in monitor lizards was studied by Christian and 
Weavers (1996), who developed an index of thermal exploitation (Ex), based on an 
earlier study on North American reptiles (Hertz et al. 1993). The Ex parameter is a 
ratio calculated by dividing the time that a lizard spends within its set-point range 
by the time available for the animal to exploit this temperature range and describes 
the thermoregulatory characteristics of ectotherms in a heterogeneous thermal envi-
ronment. In their study of three species of varanids, Ex varied from 1.0 (perfect 
regulation) to negative (no thermoregulation) with the most active species, Varanus 
panoptes, being the ‘better’ regulator over all seasons. Varanus gouldii, a species 
whose range also extends into the arid zone, was a perfect regulator in the wet sea-
son of the year, but Ex became negative in the dry season, when all activity ceased 
and they remained in their burrows (Christian and Weavers 1996). A more recent 
attempt to correlate active body temperatures and microhabitat occupation in cen-
tral Australian agamids is that of Melville and Schulte II (2001), with thermal fac-
tors playing a considerable role.
A critical question is whether arid-zone reptiles are ever forced to endure body 
temperatures significantly above their PBT, and, therefore, likely to induce stress 
responses leading to decreased fitness (Bradshaw 1997, 2017). An early analysis 
with a range of agamids of the genus Ctenophorus (then Amphibolurus) established 
that increasing aridity of the habitat was associated with MBTs significantly above 
the PBT, and this was attributed to the greater amount of time more arid-living spe-
cies were forced to spend in high-temperature-avoidance behaviour patterns 
(Bradshaw 1988). This repetitive exposure to higher than ‘preferred’ body tempera-
tures entrained an increased thermal resistance, measured as the critical thermal 
maximum (CTMax), which was lost after acclimation to laboratory conditions. 
Greer (1980, 1990) found that the CTMax of arid-living species of scincid lizards 
was also higher than that of mesic species, assuming these differences to be genetic, 
but the effect of acclimation was not investigated. Today, one also needs to consider 
the possibility of epigenetic effects (Hoppeler 2015). When considered in relation to 
the CTMax for each species, however, the highest body temperatures recorded in 
the field are invariably some 5–6 °C below the CTMax, and lizards (both in Australia 
and in North America) thus experience wide safety margins in the field (Huey 1982; 
Bradshaw 1988). Many reptiles commence ‘panting’ with a gaping mouth when 
apparently suffering from heat stress, and the panting threshold (PT) is positively 
correlated with the CTMax in 14 species of North American lizards (Whitfield and 
Livezey 1973). Panting thresholds for the few species of Australian lizards that have 
been studied are, however, well above the maximum body temperature ever recorded 
in the field (Stebbins and Barwick 1968; Heatwole 1976). Dehydration and increases

in plasma osmolality, however, have a significant impact on the PT of the North 
American desert iguana (Dupré and Crawford 1985a) and also impact on its 
­thermoregulation (Dupré and Crawford 1985b). Hypernatraemia (see glossary) also 
significantly depresses the PBT of the rock-living agamid, Ctenophorus ornatus, 
operating through the pituitary peptide hormone, arginine vasotocin (AVT) 
(Bradshaw et al. 2007).
So far as I am aware, there has been no study to date on the thermoregulation of 
any snake inhabiting the Australian arid zone. It is thus not possible to reach any 
conclusions regarding their thermoregulatory abilities and potential exposure to 
thermal stress. An early paper documented PBTs in a number of Australian snakes 
in the laboratory, ranging from 29.6 to 34.5 °C (Lillywhite 1980). Only one of these, 
the Western brown snake Pseudonaja nuchalis, is common in the arid zone, and its 
PBT was 34.0 ± 1.2 °C. Suggestions in the literature that the PBT of snakes is 
generically invariant (Rosen 1990) have been contested by careful studies involving 
telemetry. A 4-year study, for example, of the Australian blacksnake, Pseudechis 
porphyriacus (not an arid-zone species, however) showed excellent thermoregula-
tory capacities, maintaining a body temperature between 28 and 31 °C over a vari-
ety of seasons (Shine 1987). Available CTMax data for North American snakes also 
show a 6.8 °C differential when compared with maximum-recorded body tempera-
tures in the field (Bradshaw 1988; Huey 1982), suggesting that thermal stress is 
never a problem. The most notable feature about snakes in the arid zone is their 
behavioural use of nocturnality as a means of avoiding high day temperatures (Greer 
2000). Dehydration and hypernatraemia also depress the PBT by some 6–7 °C of 
the Western tiger snake, Notechis scutatus (also not an arid-zone species) operating 
also through AVT and lowering rates of evaporative water loss (Ladyman and 
Bradshaw 2003; Ladyman et al. 2003, 2006). There are some chelid species that 
occur in the arid zone (e.g. the flat-shelled turtle, Chelodina steindachneri), but 
nothing is known of their ecophysiology or how they survive for long periods in dry 
river beds (Kuchling 1999).
Water Turnover and Osmoregulation
Reptiles possess a metanephric kidney but lack the countercurrent multiplier mech-
anism of birds and mammals needed to elaborate an hyperosmotic urine (Dantzler 
and Bradshaw 2009; O’Shea et al. 1993). This renders them particularly vulnerable 
to significant perturbations of their milieu intérieur should they be faced with high 
electrolyte intakes or lack sufficient free water needed to excrete dietary salts 
(Cooper 2017). Some species possess cephalic salt-secreting glands that help in the 
maintenance of osmotic homeostasis (e.g. most varanids and many scincid lizards 
(Bradshaw 1986)), but they are absent in Australian agamids and terrestrial snakes 
(Saint Girons and Bradshaw 1987; Saint Girons et al. 1981).

The increased availability of tritiated water and liquid scintillation counters in 
the 1970s and ‘80s led to the first measurements of rates of water turnover of free-­
living lizards in North America, followed soon after by those of Australian arid-­
zone species. When compared with rates in tropical and subtropical species, those 
in arid-zone species were significantly lower, reflecting their overall enhanced water 
economy (Nagy 1982). Water turnover increases virtually linearly with body mass, 
and Nagy’s regression for arid-zone species of mL.d−1 = 20.5 kg0.91 was updated to 
32.2 kg0.98 by Withers and Bradshaw (1995) and is close to the allometric relation-
ship for free-ranging varanids with mL.d−1 = 38 kg1.19 (Bradshaw 1997). In all three 
cases, the exponent of the equation does not differ significantly from 1.0 (Fig. 1).
Interspecific regression equations such as these, which are based on average val-
ues for a wide range of species, can, however, mask more subtle differences between 
species that may only be apparent when intraspecific regression equations are com-
pared. A comparative study of the relationship between body mass and rate of evap-
orative water loss in several skinks, geckos and an agamid lizard found large and 
significant differences in the values of ‘a’ and ‘b’ in the allometric relationship 
y = axb where y is water loss and x is body mass in grammes (Fig. 2). These data 
from an early preliminary study suggest that there are substantial differences in the 
value of the constant ‘a’, which represents the rate of water loss of a 1 g (or 1 kg) 
animal depending on the scale. The gecko Gehyra variegata has a very high ‘a’ 
value of 8.71 and thus will have a high rate of water loss when small, but the low 
value of the exponent ‘b’ of 0.26 means that its rate of evaporative water loss will 
decrease, relative to its body mass, as it grows  in size. The barking gecko, 
Underwoodisaurus milii, on the other hand, with b = 0.97, does not benefit from any 
relative increase in its water economy as it grows. The agamid, Ctenophorus

(formerly Amphibolurus) ornatus, is the ‘best’ adapted in terms of water economy, 
with a = 3.16 and b = 0.55, and it is evident that lizards such as Ctenotus labillard-
ieri and Diplodactylus vittatus must, if they are to survive, restrict their movements 
to moist habitats because of their coupled high ‘a’ and ‘b’ values and potential for 
desiccation.
In the absence of a renal concentrating system, increases in water economy in 
reptiles can only be achieved by either reducing intake of water or by limiting losses. 
Under extreme conditions of salt loading, some lizards close down kidney function, 
cease filtering and become temporarily anuric (Bradshaw 1997), but reduction in 
rates of respiratory and cutaneous water loss underpins their enhanced water econ-
omy (Lillywhite 2006; Zucher 1980).
The role of the pituitary hormone arginine vasotocin (AVT) in controlling kidney 
function in three species of agamid lizards was investigated by Ford and Bradshaw 
(2006) who posited an ‘adaptationist’ scenario (sensu Gould and Lewontin (1979)), 
testing whether desert species would display enhanced renal responses to dehydra-
tion and salt loading when compared with mesic species. In fact, they found little 
support for this hypothesis, apart from a primarily glomerular rather than tubular 
response to salt loading in the mesic species, Pogona minor. Surprisingly, AVT lev-
els in the desert species, Ctenophorus nuchalis, showed no significant correlation 
with changes in plasma osmolality, although increasing levels of AVT were associ-
ated with a marked antidiuresis that was both glomerular and tubular in nature. This 
study thus supports the conclusion that desert-living reptiles are ‘exapted’ rather 
than adapted to the exigencies characteristic of the arid zone (Bradshaw 1986, 1988).
The Western netted dragon, Ctenophorus nuchalis, is widespread in sandy areas 
of the arid zone in Australia and was the subject of a long-term ecophysiological 
and population study at Shark Bay in Western Australia (Bradshaw 1986). An 
unexpected discovery to emerge from mark-and-recapture data with this large (up

to 60 g), fast-growing lizard is that it is an annual species, along with many other 
species in the genus. Following winter rains, they breed and lay eggs in spring, then 
progressively lose condition and die during summer such that, by autumn, few if 
any adults in the population survive and the young emerge to colonise what is an 
‘empty’ environment (Bradshaw 1981). A detailed study of seasonal changes in 
body condition, with modelling of daily changes in thermoregulatory activity, 
established that coping with high environmental temperatures in summer precludes 
the lizards from feeding adequately (even though food is available) and thus leads 
to their demise (Bradshaw and De’ath 1991). Their gradual slide into negative 
water balance as summer progresses, with a corresponding catastrophic decline in 
field metabolic rate (FMR) and dry matter intake (DMI), measured with doubly 
labelled water, is shown in Fig. 3.
A closely related species, the ringtail dragon, Ctenophorus caudicinctus, is a 
rock-dweller and lives sympatrically with C. nuchalis in the arid Pilbara region of 
Western Australia. This species breeds invariably in autumn, following cyclonic 
rains, and a study of the two species together found that C. nuchalis deferred breed-
ing in spring in some years when winter rains failed, survived the summer period 
and bred in autumn with C. caudicinctus (Bradshaw et al. 1991). This implies that 
the summer death seen with C. nuchalis at Shark Bay is a post-reproductive phe-
nomenon, and both C. nuchalis and C. caudicinctus, like C. fordi (Cogger 1978), are 
thus semelparous species (Henle 1991; Dickman et al. 1999). The reasons why there 
is a breakdown in the ability to maintain homeostasis following reproduction in

these lizards is not clear, although parallels with small semelparous dasyurid mar-
supials are obvious (Bradley 2003). Changes in circulating levels of corticosteroid-­
binding globulin (CBG) and free and bound concentrations of the adrenal steroid, 
corticosterone, have been implicated in stress reactivity studies of the North 
American lizard, Urosaurus ornatus (Jennings et al. 2000), but have yet to be mea-
sured in these Australian species. What has been documented in C. nuchalis is a 
marked change in the normal adrenal response in spring to the stress of confine-
ment, or injections of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), when repeated after 
breeding in late summer at Shark Bay, with the majority of individuals failing to 
respond, whilst others show an aberrant overresponse to the stressor (Bradshaw 
1997, 2017) (Fig. 4).

A number of studies have been conducted in the wet/dry tropics of Australia, 
using doubly-labelled water to document the energetics of agamid and varanids 
lizards which are very informative, linking activity, thermoregulation and foraging 
patterns. Two species of varanid lizards, for example, were studied along the South 
Alligator River in the Northern Territory of Australia and displayed divergent pat-
terns of activity and resource exploitation (Christian et al. 1995). Rates of energy 
expenditure and water turnover were faster in Varanus gouldii than in V. panoptes, 
but levels were higher in both species in the wet/dry tropics than in other varanids, 
such as Varanus giganteus occupying the arid zone (Green et al. 1986). Varanus 
gouldii, for example, with an average water influx of 50.7 mL.kg−1.d−1, was turning 
over approximately 8% of its total body water content per day (TBW), compared 
with only 3.9% for V. giganteus on Barrow Island (King and Green 1999). The 
frilled-neck lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, is a large 600 g agamid that is common 
in the tropical north of Australia. It ceases activity in the dry season of the year, 
spending it perched on tree trunks. Rates of water turnover are rapid, as would be 
expected in the wet season with a mean annual rainfall of 1600 mm in Darwin, but 
water turnover rates fall to 13.6 mL.kg−1.d−1 in the early dry season which is only 
approximately 2% of the TBW per day; later in the dry season, this falls even further 
to 5.6 mL.kg−1.d−1 (2.9 mL.d−1) (Christian and Green 1994). This is, however, still 
substantially greater than the rate of metabolic water production for a lizard of this 
size (ca. 0.3 mL.d−1), showing that whilst apparently inactive, the lizards are still 
feeding sporadically. The only other study of an arid-living varanid is that of the 
small (12 g) arboreal Varanus caudolineatus in the Murchison region of Western 
Australia (Thompson et al. 1997). Water influx in summer averaged 31.6 mL.kg−1.
d−1, and FMR was 0.46 mL CO2.g−1.h−1, which enables a calculation of the ‘Water 
Economy Index’ (WEI) of 0.14 (Nagy and Peterson 1988). This is considerably less 
than that reported for any other varanid species.
There is a single published study of energetics and water flux rates of a free-­
ranging gecko, the marbled velvet gecko, Oedura marmorata, in both tropical 
regions and in central Australia (Christian et al. 1998). As would be expected, both 
FMR and rates of water influx are much lower in the arid population than in the 
geckos from the tropical locations. The FMR of arid geckos in spring was 40.1 kJ.
d−1, compared with FMRs ranging from 109.8 to 148.9 kJ.d−1 for the tropical geckos. 
The authors do raise the possibility that the two populations may not in fact be from 
the one species, and a recent paper on the systematics of the Oedura complex con-
firms this with the arid population currently listed as Oedura aff. Marmorata (P 
Doughty pers. comm.). Rates of metabolism and water flux have been reported in 
the northern death adder, Acanthophis praelongus, again not an arid-zone species, 
with a similar tropical pattern of reduced rates in the dry season compared with that 
in the wet (Christian et al. 2007).

Conclusion
This short review serves to highlight how little we actually know of the ecophysiol-
ogy of arid-zone reptiles in Australia. Despite having a reptilian fauna that is at least 
three times as rich in number of species as that of other desert regions of the world, 
ecophysiology has been little studied, and we only have speculations and hypotheses 
to account for reptile abundance and diversity (Morton and James 1988; Pianka 
1986, 1989, 2014; Byrne et al. 2008). Although rates of water and energy turnover 
of arid-zone species are slower than those occurring in tropical regions of Australia, 
this does not appear to be the result of any specific adaptations of the former. In fact 
some species, such as the semelparous lizard Ctenophorus nuchalis, typically 
‘avoid’ the exigencies of the arid zone by what may be thought of as the bizarre habit 
of breeding and depositing eggs in spring, only to die in the oncoming summer. The

population thus survives during the hottest period of the year in the egg phase, and 
juveniles emerge each autumn to a habitat devoid of adults. Natural selection also 
does not operate to enhance summer survival as the lizards are then post-reproduc-
tive. Longer-living lizards, such as the many varanids, have to survive during the 
summer months and, in most cases, do this by drastically reducing their activity and 
often retreating below ground. In common with reptiles living in other regions of the 
world, the reason for their abundance and diversity in desert areas is linked to their 
ectothermy and slow rates of resource utilisation, compared with those of birds and 
mammals, and better described as ‘exaptations’ (Gould and Vrba 1982), rather than 
adaptations (Bradshaw 1988).
Glossary
Ectotherm  An animal that derives its body heat from an external source, such as 
the sun.
Eccritic or preferred body temperature (PBT)  The mean body temperature 
maintained behaviourally by a reptile when placed in a thermal gradient.
Mean body temperature (MBT)  The average body temperature of a reptile when 
active, which may differ from the PBT because of a lack of thermal resources.
Agamid  A lizard belonging to the family Agamidae, also called dragon lizard, e.g. 
the ornate dragon lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus.
Varanid  A lizard belonging to the family Varanidae, also called monitor lizards, 
e.g. the perentie, Varanus giganteus.
Index of thermal exploitation (Ex)  A ratio calculated by dividing the time that a 
lizard spends within its set-point range by the time available for the animal to 
exploit this temperature range and describes the thermoregulatory characteristics 
of ectotherms in a heterogeneous thermal environment.
CTMax  The critical thermal maximum, or highest body temperature, above which 
the animal is unable to recover.
FMR  Field metabolic rate. The rate of metabolism of a free-ranging animal in its 
natural habitat measured as either the rate of oxygen consumption or carbon 
dioxide production, usually with the doubly-labelled water method.
Scincid  A lizard belonging to the family Scincidae, also called skinks, e.g., the 
bobtail goanna, Tiliqua rugosa.
Vasotocin (AVT, arginine vasotocin)  A peptide hormone released from the poste-
rior lobe of the pituitary gland of reptiles that enhances water reabsorption from 
the kidney and also lowers the PBT.
Hypernatraemia  An increase in the concentration of sodium ions in the blood 
above normal hydrated levels.
PT (panting threshold)  The body temperature at which some lizards open their 
mouth (gape) and increase their respiratory rate (panting).
Metanephric kidney  The structurally more complex kidney of higher vertebrates, 
which in the case of birds and mammals, is capable of producing an hyperos-
motic urine (i.e. one with an osmotic pressure greater than the plasma).
S. D. Bradshaw

145
Cephalic salt glands  Specialised glands found in many reptiles that assist in 
osmoregulation by secreting a concentrated salt solution rich in either sodium 
or potassium. All are located in the head (nose, eye or tongue) and hence called 
‘cephalic’.
Anuric  Ceasing to produce urine; seen in many lizards when feeding on diets rich 
in salt.
Semelparous  Animals, such as salmon, that die after breeding only once. Named 
after the unfortunate Semelae, mother of Bacchus, who succumbed after a night 
of passion with the Greek God Zeus.

Introduction
The Australian arid zone seems like an odd location for a discussion of a frog fauna. 
Aridity and frogs do not obviously mix, as irrespective of developmental mode, all 
anurans are dependent on water for egg and larval development. Even frogs with 
internal or underground egg development (e.g. now extinct Rheobatrachus (gastric-­
brooding frogs) and Myobatrachus (turtle frogs) – both from Australia – see Anstis 
2013) require at the very least moist conditions, if not for reproduction, for adult 
survival. Despite this, the arid-zone frog fauna is diverse. To date, 52 species have 
been recorded in the “Deserts and Xeric Shrublands” Terrestrial Ecoregion (https://
www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra/australias-ecoregions) – the region 
most Australians would consider as desert (Table 1, Appendix 1). That claim and the 
data in Table 1 are based on data records in the “Atlas of Living Australia” database. 
We recognise those data are incomplete compared with sampling in more mesic 
areas (cf. Slatyer et al. 2007), so the data in Table 1 represent a minimum estimate 
of species composition, but likely a fairly complete one given that (a) many species 
are widespread, e.g. Neobatrachus sudelli (Sudell’s frog, Roberts 2010), 
Dryopsophus occidentalis (Western water-holding frog) and D. platycephalus 
(water-holding frog, Anstis et al. 2016), and (b) the restricted species are mostly 
confined to known sites of water availability, e.g. Pseudophryne robinsoni (Central 
Ranges toadlet) in north-western South Australia (Donnellan et al. 2012b).

So why have frogs been so successful in a seemingly inhospitable environment? 
The arid zone is not always dry, and unlike common perceptions of what a desert is, 
in the Australian desert region, water is commonly or occasionally available for 
anuran breeding. Small, permanent water sources can occur in many inland range 
systems (e.g. the McDonnell, Everard and Flinders Ranges). In some regions of the 
arid zone, smaller rock outcrops (e.g. granite outcrops) may also focus drainage into 
quite small, persistent but not permanent, water bodies that support localised frog 
populations. Larger, more permanent river systems also occur within major drain-
age systems of the Pilbara Craton. There are several major western flowing river 
systems in Queensland and South Australia (e.g. Cooper’s Creek) which derive 
water from rainfall as far east as the Great Dividing Range. These river systems may 
also gain sufficient water from local rainfall, as occurred in 2016, to flood normally 
dry, salt lake systems, like Lake Eyre. Sources of water also frequently come from 
locally intense rainfall. For example, during the summer months, cyclonic rains 
cross the Pilbara coast and move inland with ongoing major inland rainfall events. 
These cyclonic events may also move as far south as the Western Australian gold-
fields, and down to the south coast between Esperance and the Nullarbor Plain. In 
addition to cyclonic rain, significant local rainfall may come from local thunder-
storm activity. These storms typically occur during summer and may generate suf-
ficient rain to flood local drainage systems or depressions.
Water is not necessarily a limiting resource for arid-zone frogs in Australia, and 
this is reflected in the diversity of species found across the Australian arid zone. 
Australian frogs fall into two families: Myobatrachidae (ground frogs, with sub-
families Myobatrachinae, Australian froglets or toadlets, and Limnodynastinae, 
Australian ground frogs) and the Hylidae (tree frogs). Species in both families are 
found across the Australian arid zone in a diverse array of habitats. We use the 
“Deserts and Xeric Shrublands” ecoregion as outlined by the IBRA classification of 
Australian ecoregions (https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra/aus-
tralias-ecoregions) as the definition and spatial extent of the arid zone for the

purposes of this review (Appendix 1). We also use the list of frog species compiled 
within the Atlas of Living Australia database to determine which frog species occur 
within the arid zone. These records have been edited to remove obvious errors. For 
example, Global Biodiversity Information Facility records that place many 
Australian localities just north of the Northern Territory/South Australia border, or 
in Western Australia at close to Wiluna – “geographic centres” of the continent or 
state respectively; site descriptions close to the New South Wales coast  – that 
include latitude and longitude data in the arid zone that are incompatible with the 
site description. One Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) 
region, the Flinders Lofty Block, extends into the Mount Lofty ranges near Adelaide, 
well outside arid regions. In this region we excluded records from subregions 
FLB01 and FLB02 and marginal records for Limnodynastes dumerili (Eastern banjo 
frog), Crinia signifera (Common eastern froglet) and Litoria ewingi (Brown tree 
frog) that fall just outside FLB01 and FLB02. These exclusions roughly mark the 
southern margin of the arid zone in South Australia as recognised early by Goyder’s 
Line, demarcated in the early 1860s. North of the line, rainfall is low, unpredictable 
and generally unsuitable for agriculture, and most temperate-zone frog species (see 
http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/goyder.htm)!
None of the frog genera in the arid zone are endemic to the region, with all gen-
era having related, often sister species, in adjacent temperate or tropical regions, but 
rarely both. While, representatives of the two major Australian frog families are 
represented within arid regions, no species from the families Microhylidae (narrow-­
mouthed frogs) or Ranidae (true frogs), both tropical lineages in Australia (Cogger 
2014), have distributions, which extend into desert regions. In summary, Australia 
currently has 241 named frog species and roughly 20% of known frog species occur 
in the arid zone.
The suite of frogs whose distributions occur exclusively within, or extend into 
the Australian arid zone, includes several genera with species whose adults are able 
to persist, but not breed, independent of free water. Many species that live within the 
Australian arid zone have evolved unique adaptations to survive between sporadic 
rain events. Several genera form waterproof cocoons (Neobatrachus, Dryopsophus 
and Platyplectrum), while others rely solely on soil moisture for survival obtained 
by burrowing into moist soils (Notaden). Several other genera survive by using 
available moisture around breeding sites, with no described special adaptations or 
behaviours to reduce water loss (Uperoleia, Pseudophryne, Dryopsophus, Litoria 
and Crinia).
We discuss the Australian arid-zone frog fauna in six contexts. We detail (1) the 
biogeography of arid-zone taxa (what are they related to, how old are they and when 
did they evolve); (2) the physiology of anurans surviving in truly desert regions 
(which adaptations have evolved to reduce or eliminate water loss); (3) how anurans 
avoid water loss in arid regions without special structural adaptations; (4) the natural 
history and population biology of the arid-zone frog fauna (Why so many? Is it what 
they eat?); (5) the evolution of call structures and speciation of arid-zone frogs in the 
genera Neobatrachus and Uperoleia (What does an extra set of chromosomes do to 
a frog’s call?); and (6) what are the conservation issues specific to arid Australian

anurans – why have arid-zone frogs apparently evaded the current global anuran 
decline? Figure 1 gives an introduction to the arid-zone frog fauna and the sites they 
use for breeding.

Biogeographic and phylogenetic studies on the arid-zone frog fauna are limited for 
most groups but, in some genera, are extensive. The discussion that follows is based 
on mostly recent analyses of relationships using a variety of DNA sequence data.

Data for Uperoleia are comparatively robust using both nuclear and mitochondrial 
markers (e.g. Catullo and Keogh 2014). The data for Litoria and Dryopsophus spe-
cies are based on a recent, very extensive data set using multiple markers, the most 
extensive data set accumulated to date, covering all Hylid frogs across the globe 
(Duellman et al. 2016). Some other data sets are based on a single gene, often a 
single mitochondrial DNA marker for a limited set of taxa (e.g. Donnellan et al. 
2012b; Anstis et al. 2016), but we note the potential for “cross species” capture of 
mitochondria that may confound interpretation of this type of data (cf. Catullo and 
Keogh 2014).
Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Uperoleia Species
In the genus Uperoleia, the most species-rich myobatrachid genus with 25 species, 
several species occur in the Pilbara, Western Australia. Uperoleia saxatilis (Pilbara 
toadlet) and U. glandulosa (glandular toadlet) occur widely in the permanently wet 
drainages of the Pilbara Craton but extend onto the Pilbara coastal plain (Catullo 
et al. 2011; Catullo and Keogh 2014). Uperoleia saxatilis occurs on the Ashburton 
and De Grey River drainages, with its sister taxon, U. russelli (Russell’s toadlet), on 
the Gascoyne coast on the Lyndon to Wooramel River drainages. Using molecular 
clocks, Catullo and Keogh (2014) estimated a divergence date of 1.55 million years 
before present (mybp) for this species pair placing it in the mid to early Pleistocene. 
The Pleistocene had multiple “glacial” phases, but the probable impact on the 
Pilbara coast was reduced rainfall, cooler climates and an exposed north-west shelf 
due to lower sea levels, further isolating drainage systems in areas of higher relief 
that were then further inland (Byrne et al. 2008; Pillans 2018). In turn, this species 
pair split from a five species clade that now occurs across northern Australia, with 
divergence amongst species distributed throughout the Kimberley to the Gulf of 
Carpentaria occurring around 5.65 mybp in the late Pliocene during a period of 
declining rainfall, cooling climates but also frequent rapid climate variation between 
wet and dry conditions (Byrne et al. 2008; Pillans 2018).
Uperoleia talpa (mole toadlet) occurs on the Pilbara coast, but its range extends, 
not east into the Pilbara or the Great Sandy Desert, but north along the coast into the 
west Kimberley (Catullo et al. 2011; Catullo and Keogh 2014). Uperoleia talpa is 
widespread in the Broome, Derby and Fitzroy Crossing region but apparently has a 
very narrow, coastal range further south, with records in the Port Hedland area and 
at Mandora further northeast. Uperoleia micromeles (Tanami toadlet) also occurs 
north of Port Hedland, but its range extends not north, but east, into the Great and 
Little Sandy Deserts and the Tanami Desert in central Australia (Catullo et al. 2011; 
Catullo and Keogh 2014; Morton et al. 1993).
The closest relatives of all arid-zone Uperoleia species and lineages in the west-
ern deserts and west coast are in the Kimberley with divergence dates ranging from 
≈ 2.6 to 9 mybp (Catullo and Keogh 2014). The current extensions of species dis-
tributions across the 90 Mile Beach arid gap (between Port Hedland and Broome)

into the coastal Pilbara for some west Kimberley Uperoleia species (see above) 
suggest a simple model for derivation of older, Pilbara-specific species: range 
expansion into wetter drainages in the Pilbara followed by isolation during more 
arid periods leading to the formation of current Uperoleia Pilbara lineages. Desert 
Uperoleia species came out of the tropics. Tropical species are a major part of the 
diversity in this genus, which also has many species along the eastern coast of 
Australia as far south as Gippsland in eastern Victoria. Paradoxically, Uperoleia is 
the sister clade to the south-western Australian, monotypic genus, Spicospina 
(Sunset frog) with a divergence date estimated at 26 million years (Catullo and 
Keogh 2014) reflecting the long isolation of south-western Australia (Rix et  al. 
2015; Pillans 2018). Distribution and relationships of representative Uperoleia spe-
cies occurring in the arid zone are given in Fig. 2.
Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Platyplectrum 
Species
Some arid-zone frog lineages are very old – dating back to the early Paleocene. 
Platyplectrum spenceri (Spencer’s burrowing frog) was named in honour of 
Baldwyn Spencer, an early arid-zone naturalist and foundation Professor of Biology

at the University of Melbourne. This species shares a most recent common ancestor 
with the lineage containing Lechriodus fletcheri (Fletcher’s frog) and Platyplectrum 
ornatum (ornate burrowing frog), the former a rainforest species found on the 
Queensland/New South Wales border region, the latter found across tropical north-
ern Australia and into northern New South Wales (Pyron and Wiens 2011; Cogger 
2014). Pyron and Wiens (2011) showed that L. fletcheri and P. ornatum are sister 
species with the desert taxon, P. spenceri evolving earlier. Forget the confused tax-
onomy (they may well end up in one genus): this spatial pattern shares some clear 
elements with Uperoleia. In both cases the derived taxon has a broad distribution in 
the arid interior with a range from the west coast to central Australia, as for U. 
micromeles, but P. spenceri can also (a) burrow and (b) form waterproof cocoons 
when buried (Lee and Mercer 1967 – see below), and this may have been a critical 
step in surviving a drying continental interior – drying from the middle Miocene 
(Byrne et al. 2008; Pillans 2018) for frogs in a lineage derived in the early Tertiary 
close to 60 million years ago (age discussed as Limnodynastes spenceri by Roberts 
and Maxson 1986).
Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Neobatrachus Species
We know considerably less about the evolution of some arid-zone genera. 
Neobatrachus has a total of nine species: four occur outside the arid zone (N. pictus 
– painted frog): south and south-eastern Australia primarily in areas with a 
Mediterranean climate), or in south-western Australia, N. pelobatoides (humming 
frog), N. kunapalari (Kunapalari frog) and N. albipes (White-footed frog: distribu-
tion maps in Cogger 2014). Three species in this genus are tetraploid, N. sudelli, N. 
aquilonius (northern burrowing frog) and N. kunapalari (Roberts 1997a), but this is 
not associated with arid-zone success. Arid-zone species include three diploids, N. 
sutor (Shoemaker frog), N. wilsmorei (Goldfields bullfrog) and N. fulvus (Tawny 
frog), along with two of the tetraploids (N. aquilonius and N. sudelli, though the 
latter also extends into western Victoria and the south-east of South Australia – well 
outside the arid zone). The range of N. kunapalari is primarily the Western Australian 
wheatbelt – a region with reliable winter rainfall. There is some evidence N. kuna-
palari hybridises with N. sudelli where their ranges meet near Menzies (Roberts 
1997b) and north of Wubin (M.J. Mahony, pers. comm.) in Western Australia.
The genus Neobatrachus has five species occurring exclusively in, or with the 
majority of their range in, the arid zone (N. aquilonius, N. fulvus, N. sudelli, N. 
sutor, N. wilsmorei) but only four largely confined to areas with a Mediterranean 
climate (N. albipes, N. kunapalari and N. pelobatoides in south-western Australia, 
with N. pictus in South Australia and western Victoria). The relationships of 
Neobatrachus species are not well resolved. Neobatrachus sutor and N. wilsmorei 
are sister taxa (Mable and Roberts 1997; Mahony et al. 1996) consistent with 
speciation within the arid zone, but unlike arid-zone speciation in Pseudophryne 
and Crinia, these two Neobatrachus species are broadly sympatric, and both

co-occur with N. fulvus. Neobatrachus fulvus (a diploid species – Northwest Cape 
to about Carnarvon) and N. aquilonius (Pilbara to the Kimberley) are also sister 
taxa, but in this case the tetraploid occurs north of the range of the diploid. In 
some contacts between diploid and tetraploid species, there is evidence of com-
plex patterns of gene exchange and hybridisation (Mahony et al. 1996; Roberts 
1997b).
The impact of polyploidy on call structure evolution and as a contributor to spe-
ciation in this genus is discussed below.
Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Pseudophryne 
Species
Arid-zone species in this genus include P. robinsoni (Central Ranges toadlet), which 
occurs in the Everard and Musgrave Ranges, and P. douglasi (Douglas’s toadlet) in 
the Pilbara and Cape range at Exmouth. These two species are sister taxa to P. 
bibroni (brown toadlet) from south and eastern Australia, but are not directly related 
to either of the Pseudophryne species found in south-western Australia (P. guen-
theri, Günther’s toadlet, and P. occidentalis, Orange-crowned toadlet) (Donnellan 
et al. 2012b). The third arid-zone species, P. occidentalis, occurs from the eastern 
wheatbeIt in south-western Australia into the desert, almost extending to meet the 
range of P. robinsoni, in central Australia (Donnellan et al. 2012b). Pseudophryne 
occidentalis is most closely related to the broadly distributed, south-western spe-
cies, P. guentheri (Donnellan et al. 2012b). This suggests an ancient, widely distrib-
uted lineage that occurred across Australia that left “relict” species in the Pilbara/
Exmouth Cape Range region and in the Musgrave/Everard Ranges in central 
Australia. The separation of these taxa is likely associated with the aridification of 
central Australia that commenced in the early Miocene (20 mybp, Byrne et al. 2008; 
Pillans 2018), with subsequent extensive speciation along the eastern Australian 
coast (Donnellan et al. 2012b). The split between the central-eastern and south-­
western lineages is not seen in any other Australian frog lineage, where south-­
western species groups all have closest relatives in eastern Australia (Rix et  al. 
2015). The split between P. guentheri (confined to south-western Australia) and P. 
occidentalis – a species that ranges from the central wheatbelt in south-western 
Australia into the central deserts – is likely a comparatively recent event. Roberts 
and Maxson (1989) estimated divergence of these two species form south-western 
Australian at 5–6 mybp, with Donnellan et al. (2012b) supporting a later divergence 
date for this species pair than amongst other desert species of Pseudophryne.
Distribution and relationships of Pseudophryne species across Australia are 
illustrated in Fig. 3.

Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Notaden Species
Notaden nichollsi (desert spadefoot toad) occurs in Western and central Australia, 
but N. bennettii (crucifix toad) is found only in eastern Australia. Notaden weigeli 
(Weigel’s toad) is restricted to acid sands in sandstone country in the west and north 
Kimberley, and N. melanoscaphus (northern spadefoot toad) is broadly distributed 
across tropical Australia, but does not occur in the arid zone. The relationships of 
these four species are not defined, but the pattern of an arid form likely derived from 
related “tropical” taxa is shared with several other frog genera.
Fig. 3  Distribution and relationships between arid-zone species of Pseudophryne and their mesic 
relatives. Pseudophryne occidentalis is sympatric with P. guentheri in the central wheatbelt of 
south-western Australia but ranges well into the inland desert (W/D) with an outlier (D) near the 
South Australian border. Pseudophryne douglasi and P. robinsoni are sister taxa related to a nine 
species radiation of species in south-eastern and eastern Australia. “P. bibroni” covers the ranges 
of nine species: P. bibroni, P. semimarmorata, P. dendyi, P. corroboree, P. pengilleyi, P coriacea, 
P. major, P. covacevichi and P. australis. See Donnellan et al. (2012b) for supporting data

158
Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Crinia Species
Three Crinia species occur in the arid zone: C. riparia (streambank froglet) and C. 
flindersensis (Northern Flinders’ Ranges froglet), confined to the Flinders Ranges, 
occurring in permanently wet creek systems (Donnellan et  al. 2012a). Crinia 
­deserticola (desert froglet) occurs across northern, tropical Australia but also has an 
extensive distribution in the Channel Country in south-western Queensland into 
north-eastern South Australia. Cogger (2014) describes its habitats in those regions 
as being permanently moist. In phylogenetic analyses reported by Donnellan et al. 
(2012a), the two Flinders Ranges species are ancient, sister taxa estimated to have 
diverged 11.5 mybp (see also Symula et al. 2008)!
Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Limnodynastes 
Species
Two of the Limnodynastes species, L. lignarius (the woodworker frog) and L. fletch-
eri, are at their distributional limits in the arid zone. The single arid zone record of 
L. fletcheri from 1973 is on the far eastern edge of the Simpson Strezlecki dune field 
bioregion close to where one of us, JDR, also found this species in 1975, south of 
Tibooburra – on the western edge of the Murray-Darling basin: a river basin where 
this species is widespread. Limnodynastes lignarius has a primarily tropical range 
in the Kimberley and western Northern Territory. The only arid zone records of L. 
lignarius are recent, 2014, from a single locality, described as Oscar Range Quarry, 
in the Great Sandy Desert, south of the main Kimberley craton. This site presum-
ably replicates some features of the normal rocky, wet systems where this species is 
found in northern, tropical Australia (cf. Tyler and Doughty 2009).
In contrast to the limited occurrence of L. lignarius and L. fletcheri in the arid 
zone, L. tasmaniensis (spotted grass frog) is widely distributed in the arid zone in 
permanent creek systems in the Flinders Ranges, in mound springs near the South 
Australian, Northern Territory border, and there are extensive records in western 
Queensland in the Channel Country and in river systems draining southwest towards 
lakes Eyre and Frome. No special adaptations to arid environments have ever been 
reported for this species; it appears to depend on available water that happens to 
persist in many of these systems. Range expansion during major flood events was 
reported by Roberts (1993), and flood events may have contributed to the arid-zone 
occurrences of this species or renewed populations that have gone extinct during 
extended periods of drought.

159
Diversity and Biogeography of Arid-Zone Litoria 
and Dryopsophus Species
Dryopsophus species that burrow have historically been placed in a separate genus, 
Cyclorana, because of a shared morphology of squat body shapes and short limbs, 
a morphology shared with burrowing myobatrachid frog species (cf. Vidal-García 
et al. 2014). Tyler (1971) showed that Australian tree frogs (then in the genus Hyla) 
and Cyclorana species shared a derived state of the submandibular musculature and 
synonymised them into a single genus Litoria. Various authors have rejected that 
split and maintained two generic names (e.g. Anstis 2013; Cogger 2014). Frost et al. 
(2006 ) and Pyron and Wiens (2011) maintained a single genus, Litoria, but that 
genus was split recently into Litoria and Dryopsophus with all burrowing species 
previously placed in Cyclorana forming a monophyletic block in Dryopsophus 
(Duellman et al. 2016).
Relationships have been repeatedly analysed in the burrowing Dryopsophus spe-
cies (generally as Cyclorana, e.g. Maxson et al. 1985; Frost et al. 2006; Pyron and 
Wiens 2011; Anstis et al. 2016; Duellman et al. 2016). The derivation of arid-zone 
forms is much less clear than that in in some myobatrachid groups discussed above. 
For example, Dryopsophus occidentalis (western water-holding frog) found in 
western deserts is the apparent common ancestor of nine species, including a strictly 
desert species, D. maini (Main’s frog), and a strictly tropical species, D. manya 
(small frog), found only on Cape York in northern Queensland (Anstis et al. 2016): 
the desert form may represent the ancestral state for this genus. Several species also 
range from near-coastal regions in eastern Australia well into the arid zone, e.g. D. 
alboguttata (striped burrowing frog) and D. cryptotis (Hidden-ear frog), or apparent 
sister taxa are broadly sympatric, e.g. D. platycephala and D. verrucosa (rough 
frog, Anstis et al. 2016). The resolution of phylogenetic trees backing some of these 
arguments may be poor, given they are based on a single mitochondrial gene 
sequence (ND4), but they raise the possibility of very different patterns for the ori-
gins of desert forms in the hylid fauna.
Other non-burrowing tree frog species, including D. caeruleus (green tree frog), 
D. gilleni (Centralian tree frog) and L. rubella (desert tree frog), all occur more or 
less widely in the arid zone. Dryopsophus gilleni is confined to permanently wet 
sites in central Australian range systems but is the sister taxon of D. splendidus 
(magnificent tree frog) from the Kimberley region (Young et al. 2005) or, based on 
a more comprehensive data set, part of a four species clade, D. gilleni, D. splendidus 
(both only found in the Kimberley) and a species pair of D. cavernicolus (cave-­
dwelling frog – also Kimberley only) and D. caeruleus (widespread across north 
and eastern Australia) with the divergences of these lines dated at 7.5 million years 
ago (Duellman et al. 2016).
Litoria rubella has a very broad range, the largest range of any Australian hylid 
species, across inland and northern Australia. Litoria rubella is related to L. electrica 
(Buzzing tree frog: Pyron and Wiens 2011; Duellman et al. 2016); the latter species 
occurs from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Windorah in far western Queensland in the 
The Evolution, Physiology and Ecology of the Australian Arid-Zone Frog Fauna

Channel Country (Anstis 2013). There have been several suggestions that L. rubella 
might be split into more than one species, e.g. Steinborner et al. (1994), S. Donnellan 
(pers. comm.), but based on male advertisement calls JD Roberts has heard or 
recorded in inland Western Australia, near Meekatharra, on the Pilbara coast, in both 
the east and west Kimberley and near Darwin in the Northern Territory, there is little 
evidence that call has differentiated significantly across the broad range of this spe-
cies. Call in anurans is used to attract mates and recognise species, so is a useful clue 
to species differentiation and recognition (Gerhardt and Huber 2002). Determining 
what, if any, patterns of intraspecific differentiation occurred in this species needs 
additional work. By comparison, N. sudelli also has a low level of differentiation in 
call across a comparable, broad geographic range (summarised in Roberts 2010) 
with the bulk of that range in arid Australia.
Arid-Zone Frog Fauna: Overview
There is an extensive arid-zone frog fauna in Australia, and there are recurring pat-
terns of derivation from tropical rather than southern, temperate lineages in several 
genera (Uperoleia, Litoria, Dryosophus, Platyplectrum, Notaden) but also specia-
tion within the arid zone (Pseudophryne, Crinia, Neobatrachus, Dryopsophus). In 
cases where there is reliable dating from molecular clocks, these processes of initial 
lineage splitting and speciation are old, extending well back into the Miocene when 
the consensus view of Australian climates was of an aridifying central continent 
(Byrne et al. 2008; Pillans 2018), shifting from widespread rainforest and sclero-
phyll forest vegetation types at the Oligocene, Miocene boundary (Crisp and Cook 
2013). That is best exemplified by the comprehensive data set on global relation-
ships of hylid frogs and estimated ages of divergence reported in Duellman et al. 
(2016). Explicit geographical patterns have only been investigated comprehensively 
in one genus: Uperoleia. But even in this group, apart from isolation, the processes 
driving differentiation and shifts in structures of male call, a critical character in 
species recognition, and likely also subject to strong sexual selection, are unknown. 
However, the most widely distributed arid-zone species, U. micromeles (Tanami 
toadlet), is a recently derived taxon splitting from its Kimberley and Pilbara coast 
sister taxon, U. talpa (mole toadlet), only 1.22 million years ago (Catullo and Keogh 
2014). Despite severe water deficits and seasonally extreme high temperatures, 
frogs have succeeded in the Australian arid zone.
Importantly, we also note that several genera in the arid zone, Neobatrachus, 
Notaden and Dryopsophus, have a diversity higher or about equal to that in wetter 
warmer and/or cooler regions of the continent. The arid zone may be a source of 
diversity that has spilled over into less arid regions, rather than being derivative or 
surviving as remnants from tropical or temperate lineages as the arid interior formed 
(cf. Byrne et al. 2008, 2011).

Coping with Aridity: Physiological, Morphological 
and Behavioural Adaptations
Arid environments present harsh conditions for the survival of anurans. Conditions 
are usually hot and dry, and rainfall is unpredictable. Anurans living in the arid zone 
have evolved some unique behavioural, morphological and physiological adapta-
tions to coping with such inhospitable conditions including burrowing behaviours, 
cutaneous morphologies, as well as physiological adaptations, which all function to 
control water balance. We detail these specific adaptations in arid anuran genera 
below.
Coping with Water Loss in an Arid Environment 
Without Burrowing
How non-burrowing frogs persist in truly arid environments is largely unknown – 
this includes Litoria and Dryopsophus species, some Uperoleia and all Pseudophryne 
species.
Pseudophryne  P. robinsoni and P. douglasi occur around permanently wet pools 
or streams in rocky systems (Donnellan et al. 2012b; Main 1964), with P. douglasi 
reported as depositing eggs in water (Main 1964) with many of the records of this 
species in permanently wet drainage systems in the Pilbara and Exmouth region. 
These habitats are comparable to those reported for P. robinsoni in the Everard and 
Musgrave ranges (Donnellan et al. 2012b). In other Pseudophryne species, eggs are 
deposited and develop in terrestrial burrows or nests that later flood. Eggs hatch 
when flooded resulting in a conventional, aquatic tadpole (Anstis 2013). One of us 
(JDR) has observed P. occidentalis breeding in terrestrial burrows around road 
verge ponds north of Leonora, Western Australia and in burrows in clay in run-off 
areas around granite outcrops at Hospital Rocks, west of Menzies, Western Australia. 
These areas may have more predictable rainfall or water availability allowing adop-
tion of the more characteristic breeding biology for this genus. No unusual physio-
logical capabilities have been described in Pseudophryne, but JDR has observed 
individual frogs in this genus under rocks above dry gorge systems in the southern 
Flinders Ranges in South Australia. Their occurrence in severely arid environments 
suggests a capacity to cope with dry conditions, but the mechanisms to cope with 
such dry environments are unknown.
For non-burrowing Litoria and Dryopsophus species, we similarly have little 
knowledge of how they persist in such hot and dry environments. Neither D. gilleni 
nor L. rubella have a heightened cutaneous resistance to water loss, but some other 
very small, arboreal, tropical hylid species (L. bicolor, D. gracilentus) do (Young 
et al. 2005; Withers et al. 1984). Young et al. (2005) summarised data on cutaneous 
resistance to water loss in Australian hylids, stating: “Many Australian species of 
The Evolution, Physiology and Ecology of the Australian Arid-Zone Frog Fauna

162
hylids are ‘atypical’ in relation to water loss from the skin … there is a general 
consensus that resistance of Litoria species is intermediate (10–40 s cm−1) between 
that of typical anuran amphibians (∼1 s cm−1) and the waterproof frogs from the 
genera Chiromantis and Phyllomedusa (1100 s cm−1)” (see Young et al. 2005 for 
references; Withers 1992, higher numbers mean greater resistance to water loss). 
However, resistance to water loss may also vary rapidly. Blaylock et al. (1976) 
reported lipid excretion onto the skin surface and subsequent wiping behaviours in 
phyllomedusine tree frogs from semiarid areas in Argentina. These behaviours cov-
ered the skin with a water-impermeable layer accounting for early reports of high 
skin resistance and very low evaporative water loss in these species, comparable 
with some desert reptiles (references in Blaylock et al. 1976).
Desert tree frogs must cope with extreme, high, diurnal air temperatures. Main 
(1968) reported tadpoles of L. rubella in water at 39.2°, and L. rubella was reported 
surviving for more than 8 h at 40 °C in low humidity, laboratory conditions by 
Warburg (1965). The only other species, out of 11 tested by Warburg, noted to sur-
vive in such conditions was N. centralis (or likely N. sudelli, cf. Roberts 2010), a 
burrowing species that can form waterproof cocoons (Lee and Mercer 1967). In 
laboratory studies, L. rubella can marginally reduce water loss by postural and 
colour changes (Withers 1995a), but not at sufficient levels to cope with extreme 
dry/hot conditions. How non-burrowing hylid frogs cope with the combined effects 
of high temperatures and low water availability is unknown, but these laboratory 
observations on L. rubella are matched by field performance of a south-­western 
Australian, temperate-zone hylid, D. moorei (motorbike frog). Dryopsophus moorei 
has been observed voluntarily sitting in elevated air temperatures (averaging 34.4 °C 
from 08.30 to 19.30, shade temperatures peaked at 39.1  °C) with low relative 
humidity with a third of the upper body surface in direct sunlight for 6 h from 13.00 
to 19.00. Based on theoretical models of water loss in frogs, this individual should 
have been dead (Roberts and Roberts 2012). Clearly, we do not know all there is to 
know about how non-burrowing, hylid frogs cope with extreme environments.
Burrowing Behaviour and Associated Morphologies 
as Adaptations to Aridity
Four genera: Dryopsophus, Notaden, Neobatrachus and Pseudophryne all have 
multiple species in the arid zone, with the first three all having species with adapta-
tions to a burrowing habit. Burrowing frogs generally burrow backwards and conse-
quently have relatively short limbs, and that is true for burrowing species of 
Dryopsophus and all Neobatrachus and Notaden species (e.g. Vidal-García et al. 
2014). Pseudophryne species also form shallow breeding burrows (e.g. Anstis 
2013), but are not normally characterised as a burrowing species outside the breed-
ing season.
J. D. Roberts and D. Edwards

163
Burrowing frog species are also found in the Australian myobatrachid genera 
Arenophryne and Myobatrachus where frogs in both genera burrow forwards, with 
more conventional backwards burrowing in the genera Heleioporus, Limnodynastes, 
Notaden, Neobatrachus and Platyplectrum. Burrowing myobatrachid frog species 
are characteristically short-limbed, independent of whether environments are arid 
or more mesic or whether frogs burrow forwards (Arenophryne, Myobatrachus) or 
backwards (Neobatrachus, Heleioporus, burrowing Limnodynastes species), but 
forward burrowing species may have relatively longer arms (e.g. Myobatrachus; 
Vidal-García et al. 2014). The broad morphotype of squat bodies and relatively 
short limbs is shared with burrowing hylid species.
Waterproof Cocoons  Within the range of burrowing frog species, two distinct 
approaches to dealing with maintaining water balance have been described. The first 
includes the formation of water-impermeable barriers generated by repeated slough-
ing of the skin, but, rather than losing or eating the skin as generally occurs in 
anurans, the sloughed skin is kept intact. This accumulation generates multiple lay-
ers of the skin, which harden to form cocoons that cover the whole body, including 
the cloaca and the mouth but not the nostrils. This pattern of cocoon formation was 
first described by Lee and Mercer (1967) and more extensively by Withers (1995b), 
who reported up to 95 “skin” layers forming a cocoon in N. sutor, but with 229 lay-
ers reported on field-excavated frogs, N. aquilonius (Cartledge et al. 2006). Studies 
by McMaster (2006) showed that the mouth, nostrils and cloaca were sealed by an 
invagination of the skin layers into the orifice. Extensive studies on cocooned frogs 
summarised by Withers 1995b, 1998) show that cocoon formation radically reduces 
water loss, and that the reduction in water loss occurs rapidly (< 20 days) and can 
be almost total. For example, D. maini individuals without a cocoon lose an average 
of 81.7 mg of water per gram of body mass per hour, but after 21 days in a cocoon, 
this drops to only 6.2 mg g−1 h−1: a dramatic reduction. Water-loss reductions con-
tinue as cocoon layers are added and become close to zero after 60 days in this spe-
cies. Although a feature of some arid-zone frog species, cocoon formation occurs in 
all Neobatrachus and burrowing Dryopsophus species, including species from more 
temperate areas in south-western Australia (Withers 1995b; Table 1).
Burrowing Species without Cocoons  Some burrowing frog species maintain 
their position in moist soils to eliminate net water loss without forming or with no 
capacity to form waterproof cocoons. Such maintenance of position with respect to 
soil moisture may also be accompanied by frequent or occasional use of available 
moisture at the soil surface, even though that availability may be fleeting after very 
small rain events (Predavec and Dickman 1993; Thompson et al. 2005). Notaden 
species do not form cocoons and are much more likely to be detected active on dune 
systems than Neobatrachus species that occur in the same areas with activity occur-
ring even after very small amounts of rain (< 10 mm; Predavec and Dickman 1993; 
Thompson et al. 2005). Notaden nichollsi has been excavated from sandy soils in 
the Gibson Desert in the same area where N. sudelli was excavated from clay soils 
The Evolution, Physiology and Ecology of the Australian Arid-Zone Frog Fauna

164
between dune ridges (Thompson et al. 2005). Uperoleia micromeles has also been 
found in the same burrows as N. nichollsi. With no reported evidence that Uperoleia 
species form cocoons or are able to burrow (cf. Vidal-García et al. 2014), it is likely 
this species also maintains its water balance by a combination of surface activity in 
conditions where moisture is available, and by going deep enough in loose soils 
formed by Notaden burrowing, to be in contact with moist soils. This pattern of 
nocturnal activity of a burrowing frog species, water loss during the active phase 
and water uptake from moist soil when back underground during the following day, 
is also known in Heleioporus eyrei, which is commonly active on hot, dry summer 
nights in south-western Australia, but actively rehydrates from moist soils during 
the day (Lee 1968). It is not a unique property of desert anurans and likely occurs 
in other burrowing myobatrachid species, e.g. members of the L. dorsalis group 
that primarily occur in eastern temperate and tropical Australia (Martin 1972).
Uperoleia micromeles, widely distributed from the central deserts to the west 
coast (Cogger 2014), has been excavated from deep underground in burrows formed 
by N. nichollsi (Thompson et al. 2005). Frogs in the genus Uperoleia do not have 
any of the general morphological characteristics of other burrowing frog species 
(Vidal-García et al. 2014) and likely go underground as Notaden burrows down-
wards – in a commensal relationship.
Cocoon or No Cocoon?  Although these two strategies involve very different ways 
of coping with water loss, cocooning species, particularly Neobatrachus, may use 
both strategies: only forming extensive cocoons when in very dry soils. McMaster 
(2006) reported Neobatrachus sudelli excavated from sand dune soils that had 
cocoons with only two skin layers despite the last significant rainfall at the collec-
tion site being 6 months earlier. Cartledge et al. (2006) reported excavating N. aqui-
lonius without cocoons from sand dunes where Notaden nichollsi was also found. 
This suggests a common use of moist soils for rehydration and maintenance of 
water balance for all burrowing frog species if water is available, but this is an obli-
gate mechanism in species that cannot form waterproof cocoons, e.g. desert species 
of Notaden and Uperoleia.
Energetics of Dormancy While Waiting for Rain
Water loss may be avoided by burrowing, but extended periods underground gener-
ate another cost, energy depletion, as cocooned or buried frogs cannot feed. 
Associated with cocoon formation in burrowing species is a radical reduction in 
metabolic rate. Aestivating frogs depress metabolic rate by up to 85% of standard 
metabolic rate (Withers 1993; Table 2; see also McMaster (2006) for data showing 
similar metabolic depression in N. nichollsi). This reduction may make a marginal 
contribution to reduced water loss, but its critical role is in allowing cocooned/bur-
ied frogs to survive inactive, underground, without feeding, relying on fat bodies 
and other energy reserves. Van Beurden (1980) measured metabolic rates of 
J. D. Roberts and D. Edwards

165
cocooned specimens of D. platycephalus, measured fat bodies and other energy 
reserves of cocooned frogs and predicted survival rates, assuming no limiting effects 
of water loss. Figure 4 is redrawn from his paper and shows minimal survival times 
at just under 3 years, but maximum survival times at nearly 8 years, without feeding. 
This result is “almost” matched by data for N. aquilonius reported by McMaster 
(2006), where the number of layers in the cocoon from frogs excavated in the field 
was used to back-estimate a duration of time underground based on rates of cocoon 
formation in lab studies. The estimates varied from 83 to 1145 days, based on mini-
mum and maximum rates of cocoon formation, a potential maximum of just over 
3 years without feeding.

Diets of Frogs in the Arid Zone
How can frogs generate energy reserves that might allow a frog to last 8 years or 
more underground? North American frog species in the genus Scaphiopus have very 
strong similarities to the Australian genus Neobatrachus, both contain exclusively 
burrowing species and both have species in arid, desert systems and in more temper-
ate areas. Scaphiopus also spend extended periods underground. Scaphiopus eat 
termites, beetles and an array of other invertebrates but have very fast assimilation 
rates for termites (Dimmit and Ruibal 1980). Based on data on measured metabolic 
rates of dormant Scaphiopus, assimilation rates and known food intake in this spe-
cies (primarily termites), Dimmit and Ruibal (1980) very conservatively estimated 
that an individual S. couchii could ingest enough termites in two nights of feeding 
to form a fat body that would last a dormant frog 15 months. A more realistic esti-
mate by Dimmit and Ruibal (1980) demonstrated only one night of feeding on ter-
mites could generate a fat body that would last a frog 15 months without feeding.
What do arid-zone frogs in Australia eat? Studies on diets of arid-zone frogs in 
Australia are limited, but they do show that termites can be a significant food item. 
Main and Calaby (1957) reported stomach contents from Platyplectrum (then 
Limnodynastes) spenceri and C. cultripes (likely D. maini) as primarily termites 
and ants. Lindgren (1960) reported termites as the primary component of the diets 
of frogs (P. spenceri and N. nichollsi) collected at Jigalong (east of Newman, 
Western Australia), and Calaby (1960) reported two species of termites from D. 
maini and P. spenceri, but also ants, weevils, cockroaches and bugs, and large num-
bers of termites from N. nichollsi with some ant species. Notaden nichollsi from the 
Simpson Desert in southwest Queensland also consumed primarily termites (≈2/3 
of gut contents, Predavec and Dickman 1993) with ants being the only other diet 
item. In comparison with the availability of different food items, both termites and 
ants are heavily over-represented in the diet of N. nichollsi (Predavec and Dickman 
1993). In the same habitat, N. sudelli (reported as N. centralis) preferred ants, ter-
mites and beetles, and Dryopsophus australis ate beetles, and lepidopteran larvae, 
again, with both over-consuming preferred items relative to availability. Calaby 
(1960) noted, rather than being selective feeders, desert frogs may simply be con-
suming what is available during periods of peak surface activity, e.g. termites that 
swarm after major rainfall events. Consistent with that suggestion, one of us (JD 
Roberts) has watched N. nichollsi gorging on termites falling from a lit headlight at 
night at Port Hedland – the frog stopped en route to a breeding pond 15–20 m away 
across a road, 36 h after cyclonic rains fell in the region. However, patterns of sur-
face activity are not always associated with major rainfall events, particularly in N. 
nichollsi, with both Predavec and Dickman (1993) and Thompson et  al. (2005) 
reporting Notaden active after either no rain or very small rain events (≈3 mm, 
Thompson et al. 2005). The strong diet selectivity shown in the study by Predavec 
and Dickman (1993 – see above) also contradicts Calaby’s claim.
J. D. Roberts and D. Edwards

167
Population Density
Anyone who has observed frogs active after cyclonic rains in desert environments 
has seen or heard very, very large numbers of frogs. Despite that experience, there 
are comparatively few but some very impressive reports of frog densities in arid 
environments. The most extreme is by Read (1992), who reported a pit-trapping 
study of terrestrial vertebrates (reptiles, mammals and frogs) at Olympic Dam in 
northern South Australia. In that study, total captures of a single frog species, 
Neobatrachus sudelli (reported as N. centralis), exceeded the combined number of 
all other vertebrates caught in a 5-year study. Read (1992) reported 358 captures of 
6 mammal species, 1257 captures of 37 reptile species but 6243 captures of N. 
sudelli. Those data are matched in the Tanami Desert where Morton et al. (1993) 
reported 422 captures of Neobatrachus spp. (spp. uncertain, either N. aquilonius or 
N. sudelli) over 8 trapping sites and estimated frog densities at 34 to 68 per ha. 
Other frog species were captured but in considerably lower numbers (Cyclorana 
maini, 15; Notaden nichollsi, 12; Uperoleia micromeles, 9). Morton et al. (1993) 
speculated that termites were a critical food source, because of the synchronous 
emergence of frogs and winged termites. However, Neobatrachus can also emerge 
in extremely large numbers after rain events in temperate, non-arid habitats, where 
termites certainly occur but are much less obvious. Davis and Roberts (2004) 
reported 21 females and 35 males of Neobatrachus kunapalari in a 5 m by 30 m 
pond near Narembeen in south-western Australia, an area with reliable winter rain-
fall. On April 1, 2008, after a major rainfall on March 30, 2008, in the central wheat-
belt of Western Australia, JDR observed extremely high densities of N. kunapalari 
over whole landscapes, east of Beverley. Neobatrachus can be very abundant at both 
local and landscape scales outside the arid zone; termites may not be the only deter-
minant of abundance of frogs in this genus.
JD Robert’s experience working after and during cyclonic rains in the coastal 
arid zone near Port Hedland, Karratha and Exmouth is that all frog species in those 
areas that breed in temporary water bodies are abundant after major rain events: 
Uperoleia, Neobatrachus, Platyplectron and Dryopsophus species. That abundance 
has not been quantified, but that is also true of most frog species anywhere in 
Australia!
How Do Frogs in the Arid Zone Speciate?
Call Structure and Evolution by Polyploidy in Arid-Zone Frogs: 
The Genus Neobatrachus
In most anuran species, only males call, and call is a critical element in both species 
recognition and mate choice by females (Wells 2007). Roberts (1997b) discussed 
the evolution of polyploid frogs in the genus Neobatrachus and speculated about 
The Evolution, Physiology and Ecology of the Australian Arid-Zone Frog Fauna

168
their origins based on call structure given that data on mtDNA sequence data (Mable 
and Roberts 1997), karyotype structure (Mahony and Robinson 1986) and allozyme 
data had not clarified their evolution (Mahony et al. 1996). Arguments by Roberts 
(1997) were partly derived from the observation that in tetraploid anuran species 
with known diploid ancestors, the derived tetraploid commonly had calls with a 
lower pulse rate than the ancestral diploid (examples in Keller and Gerhardt 2001). 
Given that pulse rate is commonly used as a metric for species recognition by female 
frogs (Gerhardt and Huber 2002), call structure shifts likely promote speciation 
because tetraploid females are unlikely to mate with the diploid ancestor (and vice 
versa), because of the pulse rate shift. In North America Hyla versicolor is a tetra-
ploid species that has been repeatedly derived from its diploid ancestor, Hyla chrys-
oscelis (Ptacek et al. 1994), with a complex pattern of interbreeding of independently 
derived tetraploid lineages generating a single species (Holloway et al. 2006). Calls 
of H. versicolor have lower pulse rates than the diploid ancestor, and this is a broad 
pattern in several other diploid/tetraploid species pairs (Keller and Gerhardt 2001). 
Generally, tetraploids have a greater nuclear volume than ancestral diploids, and 
experimental studies of artificially generated polyploid frogs generally follow that 
maxim; calls of polyploids (both triploids and tetraploids) have lower pulse rates 
than the diploid parental species (e.g. Keller and Gerhardt 2001). Keller and 
Gerhardt (2001) showed that call structure mirrors ploidy level; calls of diploids 
have higher pulse rates than triploids, and triploids higher than tetraploids – in most 
cases. This effect was assumed to be a specific consequence of ploidy level or some 
combination of ploidy level and nuclear or cell volume as both cell and nuclear 
volume normally increase with ploidy level. However, Keller and Gerhardt (2001) 
generated some triploid embryos by cold shock that had the nuclear and cell vol-
umes characteristic of diploids, but not the expected values of triploid forms. The 
“diploid” nuclear/cell volume triploid frogs had calls with pulse rates characteristic 
of the diploid species, H. chrysoscelis, implying cell or nuclear size properties are 
more important than ploidy level. The mechanism is unknown.
Roberts (1997a) could not find any obvious diploid/tetraploid species pairs in 
the genus Neobatrachus, but the calls of all species were generally distinct in either 
broad structure (single pulse calls: N. sutor and N. wilsmorei) versus multiple pulse 
calls (all other species) or in pulse number, call duration, pulse rate, dominant fre-
quency or some combination of those features. In multivariate space, the calls of N. 
fulvus (diploid), recorded on the Exmouth Peninsula; N. aquilonius (tetraploid), 
recorded near Port Hedland; and N. sudelli (tetraploid), recorded from ­south-­western 
Australia to Queensland, were most similar. The origins of tetraploid species of 
Neobatrachus are poorly resolved (Mable and Roberts 1997; Mahony et al. 1996), 
and the origins of differences in call structure are equally uncertain (Roberts 
1997a).
J. D. Roberts and D. Edwards

169
Hybridisation and Gene Exchange  Roberts (1997b) recorded calls intermediate 
between the calls of N. kunapalari (tetraploid) and N. sudelli (also tetraploid) near 
Menzies in Western Australia. These frogs have a variety of morphological abnor-
malities including malformed feet, bones growing from the chest and reduced testis 
volumes, suggesting strong developmental barriers to gene exchange between arid- 
(N. sudelli) and temperate-zone (N. kunapalari) tetraploid species. In contrast, on 
northern Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, Mahony et al. (1996) showed evidence 
of gene exchange between the temperate diploid N. pictus and the arid-distributed, 
tetraploid N. sudelli based on extensive allozyme data.
Tetraploid Origins: Some Speculation  The origins of tetraploid forms in this 
genus are very unclear, but properties of arid-zone breeding sites may contribute to 
this process. Both cold shock and high-temperature shock during egg development 
can induce polyploidy in anurans (Schmid et  al. 2015). Breeding sites for 
Neobatrachus may be exposed to both temperature extremes. For example, Hyden 
in the eastern wheatbelt of Western Australia has a record high temperature maxi-
mum of 48.6 °C and a record low of −5.6 °C (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/ 
data from location no. 010568). Breeding by diploid species after summer thunder 
storms, or, on clear nights that typically follow the passage of cold fronts producing 
winter rainfall (Main 1968) may expose developing eggs to either heat or cold 
shock. Understanding tetraploid origins is a difficult process (cf. Holloway et al. 
2006 for a well-studied anuran example; Schmid et al. 2015 for Amphibia more 
broadly).
Call Evolution in Non-polyploid, Arid-Zone Frogs  Three factors likely impose 
selection on call structure in anurans: (a) the local acoustic environment where calls 
may adapt to peculiarities of interfering acoustic signals, e.g. calls of other frog spe-
cies and environmental noise (e.g. rainfall, thunder, wind, anthropogenic noise 
sources); (b) interactions between closely related species, e.g. driven by selection 
against hybridisation where hybrids may be infertile or have reduced viability, rein-
forcement or reproductive character displacement; or (c) local patterns of sexual 
selection that drive differences in male call due to shifts in female preference or 
male-male interaction patterns (e.g. Andersson 1997; Gerhardt and Huber 2002; 
Wells 2007).
Studies on acoustic behaviour of Uperoleia laevigata by Robertson (1984, 1986a, 
1986b, 1990) demonstrate a complex set of acoustic behaviours related to defence 
of calling territories, male-male interactions and female attraction. Most interest-
ingly, females prefer to mate with males that weigh 70% of the female’s body mass 
(Robertson 1990), and this maximises fertilisation success. In the Uperoleia species 
reported by Robertson, amplexed pairs make repeated movements to the bottom of 
breeding ponds to deposit eggs, and mass matching ­optimises egg fertilisation  
success. Patterns of sexual selection, both intersexual selection  – female choice  
of mates with a specific body mass  – and intrasexual selection, male-male

interactions that may make certain males distinctive or available as mates (Andersson 
1997; Gerhardt and Huber 2002), may have driven local adaptation in call structure 
in arid-zone Uperoleia species.
There is considerable variation in body and limb length between Uperoleia spe-
cies using multivariate descriptors of morphology (Catullo et al. 2011, 2014; Vidal-­
García et al. 2014) and in male call (e.g. Catullo et al. 2014). Some call variation in 
anurans is related to morphology, e.g. larger species generally have lower dominant 
frequencies in male advertisement calls (Hoskin et al. 2009). Contrarily, in eastern 
and western forms of U. trachyderma well-differentiated acoustically and clearly 
defined by differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data, there is 
little differentiation in morphology (Catullo et al. 2014).
Arid-zone frogs breed in high-density, multispecies choruses. Sexual selection, 
male-male interactions and female choice, the complex acoustic environments gen-
erated by multiple species breeding simultaneously and polyandrous mating sys-
tems where more than one male mates with a female may all impose novel, strong 
selection pressures on male call (Andersson 1997; Gerhardt and Huber 2002; 
Roberts and Byrne 2011).
Conservation Status and Challenges for Arid Australian 
Anurans
In the current listing of threatened Australian frog species under the criteria set out 
by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (listed at 
http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicthreatenedlist.pl), 
no 
frog species found in the arid zone are listed.
Are there threats to arid-zone frogs?
Climate change may pose a threat for arid Australian anurans. Historical rainfall 
and climate reconstructions in both south-western and eastern Australia demon-
strate major rainfall variation over the past ≈ 500–1000 years (Cullen and Grierson 
2009; Palmer et al. 2015; Tozer et al. 2016) with droughts and rainfall highs, similar 
to more recent events in the last 100 years of instrumental record commonly used as 
a baseline in Australia. These reflect El Niño and La Niña events in the Pacific and 
shifts in the Indian Ocean Dipole, with a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, as what 
occurred in 2016, generating high rainfall in inland and eastern Australia. There is 
no published modelling that we are aware of for future climate impacts specifically 
focused on arid-zone frogs. Hotter and drier conditions may impact on some: par-
ticularly species with small ranges, reliant on small, permanent water bodies (e.g. 
Pseudophryne robinsoni, which is confined to the Everard and Musgrave ranges; 
Donnellan et al. 2012b).

Extensive grazing throughout the arid regions may pose challenges for arid-zone 
frogs. In some regions of the Northern Territory, cattle grazing may be reducing the 
distribution and abundance of Uperoleia species (R. Catullo, pers. comm. 2014). 
There are documented, negative impacts of stock grazing on vegetation and fauna in 
relation to water points (e.g. James et al. 1999; Davies et al. 2010) but, paradoxi-
cally, including suggestions that termites may increase in abundance due to higher 
nutrient levels in the soil (James et al. 1999). Higher termite abundance may favour 
arid-zone frog species that often consume them (see diet data discussed above).
Despite being linked to global amphibian declines, the chytrid fungus, 
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is not considered a threat in arid environments – 
temperatures may be too high for the fungus to survive (e.g. Liu et  al. 2013) 
(Table 3).
Conclusions
Arid-zone anurans in Australia are diverse but have a long, complex history whose 
details are only now being unravelled. The combination of an ability to form water-
proof cocoons and reduce metabolic rates or exploit water in moist soils at depth 
may give frogs an unmatched ability to persist at high densities in arid environments 
(Read 1992). The incredible abundance of Neobatrachus sudelli at Olympic Dam in 
South Australia reported by Read (1992) can probably be matched by many other 
desert frog species if researchers were in the right place at the right time – during 
major rain events when the desert is least accessible and, if the rain is cyclonic, most 
dangerous.
There is a lot to learn about the role of anurans in arid zone ecosystems.

Introduction
Life on earth consists of a wondrous array of organisms, from bacteria and viruses, 
to redwoods and whales. But it’s the invertebrates – those animals without a back-
bone – that have diversified most notably. Wilson (1987) called them the ‘little 
things that run the world’ and made a call to arms to bring invertebrate conservation 
to the forefront of our minds.
The Australian terrestrial invertebrate fauna – which we here define as occurring 
in terrestrial and inland-water environments – is highly diverse, with many immense 
radiations as well as archaeic, relictual elements. While the fauna of the Australian 
mesic and tropical zones has been well studied, even if all taxa are not yet named, 
the arid zone fauna has arguably received considerably less attention.

In this chapter we outline the current state of knowledge about terrestrial inver-
tebrates of the arid zone, their origins, how they cope with the conditions in the arid 
zone, their value as food for humans, and their conservation status. Although this 
chapter deals with terrestrial invertebrates, we also consider how the fauna can be 
enriched by surface water manifestations at soaks and mound springs. Some repre-
sentatives of the major invertebrate lineages are depicted in Figs. 1 and 2.
An earlier book entitled Evolution of the Flora and Fauna of Arid Australia (Barker 
and Greenslade 1982) stated that, in contrast to plants and vertebrates, ‘our knowledge 
of the terrestrial invertebrates of the arid zone (and) their representation in collections’ 
is very poor. Although the situation has greatly improved, the relative scarcity of avail-
able information on terrestrial invertebrates, when compared with plants and verte-
brates, still remains. This is probably due to the fact that the majority of our population 
and our research and teaching institutions are situated close to the coast, creating cost 
and time impediments to research and surveys in the arid zone. Furthermore, the work 
that has been performed in the arid zone tends to be confined to brief surveys, rather 
than long-term studies, which is also an inevitable consequence of distance.

History and Scope of Knowledge
The arid zone has been the subject of various forays by generalist and specialist 
scientists since the early days of exploration through to the present time. Historical 
information on invertebrates of the arid regions of Australia is very limited. Although 
most of the Australian continent is semiarid or arid, the invertebrate fauna is hardly 
mentioned in any of the earlier entomology books (e.g. Froggatt 1907; Tillyard 
1926). It does get a brief coverage in Froggatt (1901), and Matthews (1976) pro-
vides a broader ecological discussion.
Information on arid zone invertebrates has accumulated from five different 
sources: (1) explorers; (2) scientific expeditions; (3) plant and vertebrate surveys in 
which some invertebrates were collected; (4) in more recent years, invertebrate bio-
diversity and environmental assessments; and (5) ad hoc collectors. Arid zone inver-
tebrates are both species-rich and abundant, yet the early collections made were

relatively small. This was primarily influenced by the technical aspects of the early 
expeditions (transport by horses and camels), the reliance on a small number of col-
lecting techniques (mainly direct hand collecting or netting), a greater interest in the 
vertebrates, and a lack of realisation of the true diversity of the invertebrate fauna 
and species turnover associated with distance. One significant change in surveying 
invertebrates has been the introduction of pitfall trapping, which, along with light 
trapping and also baiting, results in much more extensive catches.
Explorers
Invertebrates, in particular, were not the main concern of the early explorers. Most 
considered the ants and flies a hindrance (e.g. Sturt 1849; Warburton 1875; Giles 
1889). Sturt (1849) but Tietkens (1891) did, however, relate an occasional observa-
tion on moths and termites, and, along with Giles (1889), they collected a few speci-
mens of butterflies, ants and a scorpion. The fate of these specimens is not known, 
a situation that has happened with many of the expeditions. Sturt (1849) provided a 
bird list that included many insectivorous species (based on observations during that 
expedition). An earlier explorer, John Eyre, actually collected some specimens, and 
descriptions of new species are found in Appendix 1 of Eyre (1845). These include 
Orthoptera, Neuroptera and Hemiptera species described by Adam White and moths 
by Edward Doubleday.
Scientific Expeditions
The arid zone has been the subject of several early scientific expeditions. These 
expeditions had different aims and emphases, and the amount of invertebrate mate-
rial resulting from each expedition varied considerably. One of the better-known 
expeditions was the disastrous Burke and Wills expedition that started from 
Melbourne to the north coast and passed through some semiarid regions of New 
South Wales and Queensland (1860–1861). Ludwig Becker was the zoologist who 
died during the expedition; he made notes on invertebrates and painted a small num-
ber of species (Yen 2011). Becker stated that he collected flies for scientific study, 
but the fate of that collection is not known. Hermann Beckler, who was more inter-
ested in plants and geology, also made notes on invertebrates. Beckler also collected 
specimens that he sent back to Germany (Yen 2011). The collection of specimens 
that were sent to Europe was a relatively common phenomenon in the nineteenth 
century, but the location of much of this material is in many cases unknown.
David Lindsay led the 12-month Elder Scientific Expedition (1891–1892) 
through South and Western Australia. More than 150 new species of invertebrates 
were collected by the naturalist Richard Helms, and these were listed as follows: 
J. D. Majer et al.

185
molluscs (Bednall 1892, 1894), beetles (Blackburn 1892, 1893; Sloane 1893a, b), 
Lepidoptera (Lower 1892) and Hymenoptera (Froggatt 1893).
Incidental insect material was also collected by people while working on other 
disciplines. For example, the South Australian Museum has material collected by 
the palaeontologist Amandus Zietz at Lake Callabonna in 1893, from which Tepper 
(1893, 1895) described Orthoptera and Blattodea, Sloane (1895) identified 
Carabidae and Blackburn included other species of beetles into several papers (e.g. 
Blackburn 1895). Tate (1894) diagnosed some molluscs from Central Australia but 
did not state how the specimens were procured.
In 1894, the Horn Expedition collected material in Central Australia from 
Oodnadatta through to the Alice Springs region and southwest to the Uluru region 
(Spencer 1896a). The expedition members worked on plants, animals, fossils, geol-
ogy and anthropology. With regard to invertebrates, 415 species were collected, 
including 124 new species (Yen 1996). The invertebrates were Mollusca (Tate 
1896), Oligochaeta (Spencer 1896b), Araneae (Hogg 1896), Blattodea, Mantodea, 
Dermaptera, Orthoptera, Phasmatodea (Tepper 1896), Coleoptera (Blackburn 1896; 
Sloane 1896), Lepidoptera (Lower 1896), ants (Froggatt 1896; Kirby 1896), other 
Hymenoptera (Kirby 1896), Isoptera (Froggatt 1898) and Hemiptera (Bergoth 
1916).
White (1910) conducted an ornithological expedition to the Eyre Peninsula that 
resulted in a few minor observations on insects and many comments on insect diet 
of birds, although no insects were apparently collected. Later expeditions included 
the 1913 expedition from Oodnadatta to the Alice Springs region (White 1914); the 
invertebrates collected were Mollusca (Matthews 1914), Crustacea (Baker 1914), 
Arachnida (Pulleine 1914), beetles (Lea 1914b), butterflies (Waterhouse 1914), 
moths (Turner 1914) and Hymenoptera (Froggatt 1914), while Lea (1914a) listed 
the stomach content of birds. The South Australian Museum organised an expedi-
tion to Strzelecki and Coopers Creek in 1916 (Waite 1917), and the invertebrates 
collected were Crustacea (Chilton 1917), insects (Lea 1917b), arachnids (Rainbow 
1917) and stomach contents of birds (Lea 1917a). The Royal Society of South 
Australia organised a 1939 Simpson Desert Expedition to study the flora and fauna. 
The only resulting publications were on spiders and scorpions (Hickman 1944) and 
Hemiptera (Musgrave 1945).
The earlier expeditions were primarily conducted in South Australia, Western 
Australia and the southern part of the Northern Territory. Wells (1993) outlines a 
history of entomologists collecting in the Northern Territory, and it was all con-
ducted in the wetter northern parts of the Territory.
Plant and Vertebrate Surveys (Invertebrates Secondary)
The expeditions up to the end of World War I relied on animal transportation (cam-
els or horses). The introduction of motorised transport resulted in surveys that could 
include repeat visits to selected locations (thus allowing for seasonal differences to

be determined), using different collecting techniques, and as there was development 
in the arid zone, the establishment of field research stations (such as CSIRO in Alice 
Springs and the University of New South Wales at Fowler’s Gap in western New 
South Wales) and experimental locations (e.g. Kunoth Paddock near Alice Springs). 
Research on flora and fauna was transformed from a pure species inventory survey 
approach to more functional and applied approaches. However, the emphasis was 
primarily on plants and vertebrates, land-use issues (often about how land could be 
used for commercial activities such as cropping or grazing) and eventually for land 
management with conservation outcomes. For instance, in Western Australia the 12 
Biological Survey of the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia reports (Biological 
Surveys Committee 1984–1995) all contained chapters on plants and vertebrates, 
but none on invertebrates. A similar situation arose with the Biological Survey of the 
Nullarbor Region, South and Western Australia in 1984, which contained no chap-
ters on invertebrates (McKenzie and Robinson 1987). Invertebrates were not con-
sidered in much of this work, until there was some recognition that many of the 
ecological functions essential in the arid zone involved invertebrates. These include 
seed dispersal (Morton 1982) and the food requirements of insectivorous verte-
brates (Morton and James 1988). The survey situation had improved by the last 
decade, when the Biodiversity of the Carnarvon Basin survey (Burbidge et al. 2000) 
included chapters on aquatic invertebrates, scorpions, mygalomorph spiders, ara-
neomorph spiders and myriapodous groups, as well as a subsequent paper on ants 
(Gunawardene and Majer 2004). Shortly afterwards, the Biodiversity Survey of the 
Pilbara Region of Western Australia, 2002–2007 (George et al. 2010), encompassed 
surveys and papers on aquatic invertebrates, scorpions, spiders, beetles and ants. 
Finally, although not part of a government survey, the Chevron-sponsored surveil-
lance programme on Barrow Island resulted in a book entitled The Terrestrial 
Invertebrate Fauna of Barrow Island, Western Australia (Gunawardene et al. 2013), 
which covered all sampled groups of terrestrial invertebrates.
The vastness of arid Australia, the inaccessible nature of parts of it and the spe-
cies turnover associated with the invertebrates make it difficult to systematically 
conduct a comprehensive species inventory for the region. Early records were 
biased towards larger-bodied and easy to collect and identify insects, but the recog-
nition of the ecological roles of different invertebrate groups revealed the impor-
tance of social insects such as ants and termites. The use of pitfall traps to collect 
ground-active invertebrates significantly increased the number of species collected 
during surveys. Parts of the arid zone are subjected to unpredictable weather and 
climate (droughts and floods) that can result in massive temporal changes in the 
fauna, as we discuss later. To complicate matters further, fire is an important eco-
logical factor, and as we discuss later, how it affects invertebrates is still unclear. 
There have been some preliminary attempts to understand the roles of invertebrates 
without full taxonomic identities in semiarid and arid Australia (Greenslade 1978a, 
b, 1982, 1985a, b; Greenslade and Greenslade 1984, 1989; Matthews 1976; Yen 
1989).
One recent initiative has increased knowledge of the invertebrate species in parts 
of Australia considerably. The Bush Blitz programme, started in 2010, was imple-
J. D. Majer et al.

mented to survey newly established reserves across Australia for flora and fauna. 
Several of the surveys have been conducted in arid Australia, such as Henbury 
Station (NT) (ABRS 2015a), Hiltaba Station (ABRS 2015b), Bon Bon Reserve 
(ABRS 2013a), Witchelina Station (SA) (ABRS 2013b), Credo Station (ABRS 
2015c), Cane River (ABRS 2014a) (WA) and Ned’s Corner (ABRS 2014b) (Vic).
The Uluru fauna surveys initially only collected vertebrates (Reid et al. 1993) but 
included invertebrates in 1995, 1997, 2000 and 2004 (Yen et al. 1996; Yen and 
Wainer 2003). Further south from Uluru, the Anangu Pitjantjatjara lands in South 
Australia were surveyed for both vertebrates and invertebrates (Robinson et  al. 
2003), and further east in the semiarid northwest of Victoria, both vertebrates and 
invertebrates were surveyed in a pitfall trapping programme from 1984 to 1985 
(Robertson et al. 1989; Yen 1987).
The material from expeditions and surveys that was deposited in institutions 
such as the state museums and the Australian National Insect Collection in Canberra 
was used, in conjunction with smaller ad hoc collections for taxonomic research of 
some invertebrate groups. In South Australia, the collections provided material to 
prepare identification guides to ants (Greenslade 1979) and to several families of 
beetles (Matthews 1980, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997; Matthews and Reid 
2002).
In summary, invertebrates have been collected from various parts of arid 
Australia. The collections have accumulated over the last 150 years and resulted 
from ad hoc collections of invertebrates of interest, to flora and fauna surveys, and, 
in more recent years, environmental assessments.
Invertebrates in the Arid Zone: Origins and Diversity
Taxonomic Composition and Phylogenetic Patterns
The vast majority of terrestrial invertebrate orders that occur in Australia (Harvey 
and Yen 1989) also occur in the arid zone. Notable absentees include velvet worms 
(Onychophora), leeches (Hirudinidea), whip spiders (Amblypygi), craterostigmatid 
centipedes (Craterostigmatida), pill millipedes (Sphaerotheriida), sucking milli-
pedes (Siphonophorida), craspedosomatid millipedes (Craspedosomatida) and alder 
flies (Megaloptera), which are all confined to the mesic zones of southern and/or 
eastern Australia. Members of a few other orders are extremely rare or highly 
localised.
While the origins of many taxa are unclear, others show either clear southern or 
northern origins or are at least most closely related to such groups. For example, the 
arachnid order Schizomida (Fig. 1) occurs in the tropics of northern Australia with 
various taxa occurring in subterranean ecosystems in the arid zone (Harvey 1992; 
Harvey et al. 2008). Conversely, the trapdoor spider family Idiopidae is abundant in 
mesic and semiarid zones in southern and eastern Australia, with multiple incur-
sions into the arid zone, particularly of the genus Aganippe (Main 1957). Such 
Terrestrial and Inland-water Invertebrates of the Australian Arid Zone

188
contrasting patterns are not unexpected, of course, and fit similar patterns of non-­
invertebrate groups.
The Australian arid zone includes many relictual taxa, some with naturally small 
distributions that are sometimes known as short-range endemic species (see Harvey 
2002; Harvey et al. 2011; Majer 2009). Most of these relictual taxa are remnants of 
a more widespread mesic zone fauna that was gradually extirpated or displaced by 
aridification processes that commenced in the Miocene-Pliocene (Byrne et al. 2008; 
Rix et al. 2015), and they tend to occupy habitat refugia such as mound springs, 
mountain ranges or subterranean ecosystems (see below), where climatic extremes 
are mollified.
One of the better-studied groups, land snails, is particularly subject to desicca-
tion, and their beta diversity is greatest in mesic environments where constant high 
moisture levels allow for population persistence. Nevertheless, numerous land 
snails occur in the arid zone, particularly where sufficient habitat heterogeneity pro-
vides feeding and aestivation sites. Their activity is usually restricted to rainfall 
events, either during or after monsoonal events or winter rainfall. The three species 
of the camaenid genus Granulomelon occupy upland habitats in Central Australia 
(Fig.  1) and are hypothesised to have diverged during the intensely arid mid-­
Pleistocene (Criscione and Köhler 2016). Another camaenid genus, Rhagada, 
exhibits complex patterns of diversification and shell morphology that are only 
becoming apparent through the use of molecular sequence data (e.g. Johnson et al. 
2004, 2012; Hamilton and Johnson, 2015; Stankowski 2015). Such detailed studies 
are largely lacking for other invertebrate taxa.
Other invertebrate groups, including beetles, ants and other Hymenoptera, plant 
bugs, termites (Fig. 2) and spiders (Fig. 1), show extremely high diversification lev-
els in the Australian arid zone. The prevailing hypothesis of progressive diversifica-
tion since the onset of aridity in the Miocene is supported by molecular phylogenies 
of various plant and animal groups that exhibit post-Miocene radiation patterns (e.g. 
see reviews by Byrne et al. 2008, 2011; Rix et al. 2015). Unfortunately, many taxo-
nomic treatments of hyper-diverse arid zone invertebrate taxa are currently lacking 
complementary molecular treatments which are hampering our understanding of 
the evolutionary origins of the modern Australian arid invertebrate fauna. However, 
notable exceptions include genetic studies of subterranean fauna (see below).
Diversity
The world’s invertebrate fauna is the least known of all multicelled biota, with a 
recent estimate of the Australian fauna comprising ca. 340,000 species, of which 
only ca. 98,000 have been described (Chapman 2009). The largest terrestrial group, 
the insects, comprises ca. 205,000 species, with only ca. 62,000 named. The second 
most diverse group, the Arachnida, has only 6615 named species with an estimated 
total of ca. 31,000 species. In contrast, the Australian flora comprises 26,845 species 
of which 24,716 are named, and the terrestrial vertebrate fauna (excluding fishes) 
J. D. Majer et al.

189
comprises 2470 species of which 2358 are named (Chapman 2009). This lack of 
basic knowledge of the Australian invertebrate fauna, the taxonomic impediment 
(Taylor 1983), is intensified in the arid zone due to large distances from the major 
population centres, although the past 30 years has certainly seen an increase in sur-
vey effort. The lack of taxonomic knowledge is even exemplified at the generic level 
as new genera are being described every year. The lack of formal taxonomic names 
also hampers ecological studies and, most importantly, conservation efforts (Harvey 
et al. 2011).
Coping with Life in the Arid Zone
Aridity and Unpredictability of Rainfall
By its very nature, the arid zone is characterised by its low rainfall (Wyrwoll this 
book), which restricts plant productivity and presents a generally harsh environ-
ment, posing restrictions for invertebrates living in this region. In addition to this, 
rainfall is highly unpredictable in its occurrence, both in terms of the months in 
which it falls and by the amount of rain, which can vary from almost none in a given 
year through to levels sufficient to cause flooding. Despite this, the diversity of 
many invertebrate groups is remarkably high in the arid zone, with the fauna exhib-
iting various responses, both at the individual species and community level.
With few long-term studies being available for the arid zone, community 
responses are not well known. The invertebrate surveys carried out on Barrow Island 
(see Gunawardene et al. 2013), 56 km off the mainland of northwest Australia, pro-
vide a rare opportunity to examine this. As an example, one set of 12 ‘gas plant’ 
(GP) sites was sampled by an array of procedures in the March 2006 wet period and 
resampled by identical methods during the September 2006 dry period (Callan et al. 
2011). A non-parametric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of the 12 
GP sites is shown in Fig. 3a. The distances in ordination space between the wet 
season samples were less than those for the dry season samples, indicating that site 
variability in terms of invertebrate composition was less after rain than during dry 
conditions. The two seasons of sampling are clearly separated, with the two clusters 
being significantly different (global R = 0.979; P = 0.001). The ordering of the sites 
along the second axis is similar for both seasons and appears to be associated with 
other factors such as distance from the coast (global R = 0.166; P = 0.03) and soil 
type (global R = 0.159; P = 0.057) but only weakly and not significantly so with 
vegetation type (global R  =  0.078; P  =  0.174; n.s.). This ordination, therefore, 
­indicates that rainfall has a more profound influence on the composition of the fauna 
than do site factors.
A further set of 13 ‘nonindigenous species’ (NIS) sites was sampled in May

sampling are separated on the first axis, and the 2 years are significantly different 
(ANOSIM global R = 0.687; P = 0.001). This highlights the fact that, with the 
unpredictable rainfall patterns in this climatic zone, the same periods in different 
years cannot be assumed to be equivalent in terms of seasonal phases on the biota.

and sites, the size of the global R statistics indicates that inter-year variation in the 
biota can be almost as great as the variation between wet and dry seasons within a 
given year.
These two surveys highlight the massive turnover of species, with over half the 
species sampled during one survey being absent in the next. So, how do such organ-
isms survive during the intervening periods? Some groups, such as Collembola, 
may have desiccation-resistant anhydric stages or may retreat into moist microsites 
such as under bark (Greenslade 1981) where they are not readily sampled. Many 
other groups may survive arid periods through quiescent egg or pupal stages, only 
emerging when conditions are favourable. Other taxa may use migration as a means 
to avoid arid periods and capitalise on conditions when water becomes available. 
This is exemplified by conditions on Barrow Island, where there are no permanent 
waterbodies and hence no habitat for species that have an aquatic stage in their life 
cycle. Long-term sampling on Barrow Island revealed the presence of dragonflies 
following rain, which presumably arrived from the mainland when water became 
available.
Subterranean Life: The Ultimate Solution to Aridity
Representatives of many invertebrate groups have avoided aridity by colonising the 
subterranean realm, usually evolving morphological traits such as loss of eyes, elon-
gate appendages and reduction of pigmentation (Figs. 1O, P and 2J). The onset of 
arid conditions across Australia during the Miocene was probably responsible for at 
least the initial phases of this colonisation, with impressive radiations, notably in the 
Pilbara and Yilgarn regions of Western Australia and on the Nullarbor Plain.
Notable invertebrate groups with subterranean representatives in the arid zone 
include aquatic worms (e.g. Brown et al. 2015), spiders (e.g. Baehr et al. 2012), 
pseudoscorpions (e.g. Harvey and Edward 2007; Harrison et al. 2014), schizomids 
(Fig. 1; e.g. Harvey et al. 2008), crustaceans such as amphipod and isopods (Fig. 1; 
e.g. King 2009; King et al. 2012; Page et al. 2008; Abrams et al. 2012; Javidkar 
et al. 2015) and hexapods including silverfish, cockroaches and beetles (e.g. Cooper 
et al. 2002; Leijs et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2012).
In a pioneer study titled The Biogeography of Cape Range, Humphreys (1993) 
focused on the cave fauna of this tertiary orogenic karst in north-western Australia, 
and the report includes papers on non-marine molluscs, cavernicolous arachnids 
and myriapods, crustaceans and subterranean biology. It was the prelude to a wave 
of discoveries across Australia of possibly the most diverse subterranean fauna 
globally which, surprisingly, is concentrated in the arid zone. Troglobionts occur in 
all types of subterranean voids including novel systems such as groundwater cal-
cretes and pisolites, i.e. sedimentary rocks made of pisoids, which are concretionary 
grains, often of calcium carbonate. This fauna comprises obligate subterranean lin-
eages with both terrestrial and aquatic habits, respectively, comprising troglobionts 
and stygobionts. Stygobionts predominantly comprise crustaceans belonging to the 
Terrestrial and Inland-water Invertebrates of the Australian Arid Zone

192
bathynellaceans, copepods, ostracods, amphipods and isopods. Troglobionts are 
predominantly slaters, arachnids, myriapods and a rather restricted set of hexapods 
(diplurans, springtails, silverfish, crickets, cockroaches, bugs and beetles; Figs. 1 
and 2). The species richness at any one site (the α-diversity; 54 species in a single 
borehole) is unexceptional to a surface biologist, but in the context of subterranean 
biology, it greatly exceeds subterranean species densities recorded globally. 
Subterranean species have very small distributions, and so β-diversity (between site 
diversity) is also very high, as also is γ-diversity (a measure of differences between 
regions) with an almost complete turnover of genera of stygofauna between the 
contiguous Pilbara and Yilgarn regions (Humphreys 2008).
Initially the arid zone subterranean fauna was studied in caves in typical carbonate 
karst (Nullarbor, Cape Range, Barrow Island) and in alluvial aquifers (Humphreys 
1999). Increasingly, the subterranean fauna in the arid zone is typically accessed down 
boreholes (wells) in areas completely lacking in caves. These include groundwater 
calcretes in the Yilgarn (Leijs et al. 2012) and Northern Territory (Cho et al. 2006) and 
lacustrine and groundwater calcretes in the Pilbara (Poore and Humphreys 1998; 
Finston et al. 2009) and in the fractured rock and goethite pisolite formations derived 
from Precambrian banded iron formations and their derivatives. In the arid zone, the 
overwhelmingly greater part of the subterranean fauna is in areas lacking caves.
The subterranean fauna is poorly described but is best known from the Western 
Shield, and our understanding of it is changing rapidly. Guzik et al. (2010) consid-
ered that 960 species of non-crustacean terrestrial troglobionts awaited discovery, 
mainly in the Western Shield, but this is likely a considerable underestimate, as 566 
troglobiont species were recorded by sampling just ~1% of the area of the Pilbara 
and another 92 species from the Yilgarn (Halse and Pearson 2014). In addition 350 
species of stygobiont were recorded by Halse et al. (2014) from the Pilbara, despite 
only one sample site per 460 km2.
The best-studied subterranean aquatic systems are the calcretes that form from 
groundwater as it approaches the base level at salt lakes, becoming gradually more 
saline owing to evaporation. They have been described as groundwater estuaries and 
likened to anchialine habitats at the coast that also support stygobionts, but largely 
with marine affinities (Humphreys et al. 2009). In the Yilgarn, calcrete aquifers are 
typically salinity-stratified, becoming markedly hypersaline with depth, but with 
water conditions highly variable with both depth and spatially over short distances 
(Watts and Humphreys 2003, 2006). Some stygobionts such as parabathynellids 
(Fig. 1) that are considered freshwater animals occur in situations where the surface 
water is already at typical marine salinity (Humphreys 2006). Conversely, ground-
water in the Pilbara is typically fresh throughout its depth and supports a remarkable 
diversity of ancient lineages. These include two of the four species of 
Spelaeogriphacea (others in South Africa and Brazil), Thermosbaenacea (Fig. 1; 
considered a Tethyan lineage) and Candonini ostracods that occur in groundwater of 
Australia, Africa and South America, indicating a Gondwanan heritage (Humphreys 
2008). The three tribes comprise 13 genera, and all but one of the genera are endemic 
to the Pilbara, with the genus Candanopsis occurring in the Yilgarn and the other 
two continents.

The onset of aridity in Australia has long been proposed as the major driver of 
subterranean colonisation, subsequent isolation and speciation. Hypotheses about 
the ecological processes that led to the diversity of subterranean fauna in the 
Australian arid zone have been derived from our sparse knowledge. The develop-
ment of aridity was proposed at a landscape scale to account for the formation in 
Cape Range of genetic ‘provinces’ within humid forest lineages of terrestrial troglo-
bionts, entirely dependent on high humidity and allochthonous organic carbon 
(Humphreys 1991), for which no close relatives of the cave fauna have persisted on 
the surface in this now arid area (Humphreys 1993; Humphreys and Adams 2001). 
The diving beetles are considered to have had preadaptations, often referred to as 
exaptations ― such as preference for temporary, but seasonally reliable, water and 
preference to live amongst gravel and sand along running water ― that would have 
favoured transitions from surface to subterranean life, but the much smaller body 
size of stygiobiont species due to larger body size limiting the likelihood of success-
ful transitions (Leys and Watts 2008). Populations of stygobiont amphipods have 
become isolated in headwater tributaries in the Pilbara (Finston et al. 2007) consis-
tent with the pattern expected from the changes in flow conditions and water quality 
from the progressive development of aridity (Humphreys 2001), the headwater iso-
lation model. Conversely, the diving beetle faunas of the isolated calcretes distrib-
uted along the length of in the Yilgarn palaeovalleys do not map the drainage pattern. 
Rather, the molecular phylogeny supports a model of multiple independent inva-
sions of calcretes across a wide region (Leys et al. 2003), a model applicable also to 
the parabathynellids, amphipods and isopods inhabiting the calcrete aquifers 
(Cooper et al. 2007, 2008; Abrams et al. 2012; Guzik et al. 2008, 2009; Watts and 
Humphreys 2009). This ‘groundwater island model’, whereby each isolated calcrete 
contains an endemic troglobiont fauna, originally established for stygobionts 
(Cooper et al. 2002) is being extended to terrestrial troglobionts (Javidkar 2014). 
The ecological and geographical context of this fauna is more fully described else-
where (Humphreys 2008, 2012).
Arid Zone Aquatic Invertebrates and the Importance of Refugia
Since arid landscapes are highly water-limited environments, no permanently flow-
ing rivers or deep freshwater lakes are present in the ancient and topographically 
subdued landscapes of arid Australia. The ongoing aridification of inland Australia 
which started in the Miocene has resulted in contraction of once widespread mesic 
habitats and the associated fragmentation and isolation of aquatic habitats (Byrne 
et al. 2008). However, although large volumes of perennial surface waters are not 
present, the arid and semiarid regions of inland Australia contain a diverse array of 
aquatic habitats. These include perennial or near-perennial waterholes in temporary 
river networks, permanent groundwater-fed springs and a range of temporary and 
ephemeral waterbodies fed by infrequent and unpredictable episodic rain events. 
The latter include small rock holes and large shallow freshwater lakes and wetlands, 
Terrestrial and Inland-water Invertebrates of the Australian Arid Zone

194
claypans and salt lakes (Davis et al. 2013a). All of these systems support aquatic 
invertebrates with a range of life history strategies, behaviours and ecological attri-
butes that enable them to persist in these often harsh and sometimes extreme envi-
ronments (Boulton et al. 2014).
Relatively diverse communities of aquatic invertebrates have been recorded from 
the waterholes of the riverine networks of the Pilbara-Hammersley region (in north-­
western Australia) (Pinder et al. 2010), the eastern Lake Eyre basin (Sheldon and 
Puckridge 1998; Sheldon et  al. 2002) and the Finke River in Central Australia 
(Davis 1997; Brim Box et al. 2008, 2014). Complexes of groundwater springs fed 
by the Great Artesian Basin (Fig. 4) represent highly fragmented freshwater ecosys-
tems, ‘aquatic islands of biodiversity in a sea of sand’ and contain a suite of relictual 
and endemic aquatic invertebrates, mainly species of Crustacea (Fig.  1) and 
Mollusca (Murphy et al. 2010). Springs fed by local fractured rock aquifers in the 
Central Australian ranges also support relictual and endemic aquatic invertebrates, 
which are dominated by Insecta (Davis et al. 2013a). The aquatic invertebrate fau-
nas of temporary freshwater pools, claypans and salt lakes, which are largely domi-
nated by Crustacea, are relatively well known through the studies of Timms (2001, 
2006, 2007) and Williams (1998).

Despite a recent increase in studies of aquatic invertebrates (see Brim Box et al. 
2014; Davis et al. 2013b; Murphy et al. 2015a, b; Pinder et al. 2010), understanding 
of the biodiversity and biogeography of Australian arid zone freshwater inverte-
brates is hindered by a lack of taxonomic knowledge for many groups. For example, 
although 83% of the invertebrates collected (95 taxa) from the George Gill Range in 
Central Australia were identified to the level of genus, only 45% were identified to 
species (Davis et al. 1993). Some groups such as the Odonata (Fig. 2) and Dytiscidae 
are relatively well known; however, keys do not exist or are incomplete, for many 
species and distributional records may be misleading, because of lack of sampling 
across entire species ranges. This problem may be rectified as molecular approaches, 
e.g. metabarcoding, become both cheaper and easier to apply.
The origins of many of groups of aquatic organisms are unknown, but most are 
likely to have ancient origins and have ultimately been derived from ancestors inhab-
iting mesic environments. This is especially true of taxa such as the chironomid 
midge genus Archaeochlus whose closest living relatives nowadays exist in southern 
Africa and are most likely Gondwanan in origin (Withers and Edward 1998).
One major order of aquatic insects, the Plecoptera (stoneflies), is notable in its 
absence from Australian arid zone waterbodies. Although stoneflies have been 
recorded from intermittent stream habitats in North America, they are confined to 
the temperate regions of southern Australia and the Queensland highlands (Williams 
1980). It seems likely that their thermal tolerance is exceeded in many inland 
Australian regions (Davis et al. 1993).
Groundwater-fed, perennial spring habitats have long been recognised as impor-
tant refugia for aquatic invertebrates and desert fishes (Myers and Resh 1999; 
Shepard 1993; Ponder 2002; Kodric-Brown and Brown 2007). The global impor-
tance of springs and spring-fed aquatic habitats (groundwater-dependent ecosys-
tems) as biodiversity hotspots was described by Bogan et al. (2014). Many arid zone 
waterbodies have the potential to act as climate refugia. Keppel and Wardell-
Johnson (2012) defined refugia as habitats that biota retreat to, persist in and poten-
tially expand from under changing environmental conditions. Gollan et al. (2014) 
suggested that the presence of microrefugia sites, particularly stable ones, with 
cooler maximum temperatures that are decoupled from the regional climate, has 
been imperative for the persistence of species over many millennia and multiple 
climate change events. These climatically decoupled sites serve as a source for 
recolonisation when the regional climate becomes favourable again (see also 
Dobrowski 2011).
In an investigation of key arid zone climate refugia, Davis et al. (2013a) extended 
the work of Fensham et al. (2011) to consider the importance of perennial, tempo-
rary and ephemeral waterbodies as either evolutionary or ecological refugia, or 
both, for freshwater biota. Based on an understanding of phylogenetic relationships, 
life histories and ecologies of arid zone aquatic invertebrates and fishes, they defined 
evolutionary refugia as perennial waterbodies (groundwater-dependent ecosystems) 
that support short-range endemics or vicariant relicts (species with ancestral charac-
teristics that have become geographically isolated over time). Although these spe-
cies often have very small geographical ranges, their populations are relatively

stable and high levels of genetic diversity are present. Groundwater dominance 
means that not only are these aquatic habitats hydrologically decoupled from 
regional precipitation, they may also provide some thermal buffering from the 
regional climate. In contrast, ecological refugia vary hydrologically in both space 
and time, depending on unpredictable, episodic rainfall events. They are important 
for ‘boom and bust’ species and support aquatic taxa with a range of dispersal traits. 
They range from perennial groundwater-dependent ecosystems and large, deep, 
rainfall-fed riverine waterholes to temporary and ephemeral aquatic systems sup-
ported by local rainfall events. Gnamma holes and rock holes which occur in hard 
rock, particularly granite outcrops in arid Western Australia, not only represent 
important ecological refuges; they were also critical sources of drinking water for 
Aboriginal people moving across the landscape (Bayly 2002).
Clearly, evolutionary refugia play an important role, at the local scale, in protect-
ing arid zone aquatic invertebrates that are unable to disperse widely or adapt to 
environmental change. In contrast, ecological refugia are important habitats at 
larger spatial scales (regional to continental) for organisms with a variety of disper-
sal mechanisms and life history attributes. Recently, Murphy et al. (2015a, b) found 
that despite major life history differences amongst endemic invertebrate taxa that 
inhabit Australian desert spring refugia, they demonstrate remarkable similarities in 
their evolutionary histories. All groups have multiple lineages that extend back to a 
time before the formation of present-day deserts and exhibit significant geographic-­
based diversification since adapting to a refugial habitat. They concluded that their 
results provide further evidence that refugia act as ‘museums of biodiversity’, pre-
serving lineages that would have otherwise gone extinct. However, they also sug-
gested that fragmented refugia provide ideal conditions for the generation of ‘future 
biodiversity hotspots’ based on their findings that isolation in refugia corresponds 
with significant diversification, leading to a recently evolved, novel endemic inver-
tebrate fauna.
There is much that we still need to learn about Australian arid zone aquatic inver-
tebrates, in general, and the role of refugia under global climate change. However, 
we also have a new suite of tools at our disposal, including molecular approaches to 
understanding connectivity and dispersal, remote sensing, geographic information 
systems (GIS) and smart data that can be collected using the Internet of Things. The 
following decades likely provide an unprecedented increase in our knowledge and 
understanding of the diversity, biogeography and ecology of arid zone aquatic 
invertebrates. This information should ultimately result in better management and 
conservation of species, communities, habitats and ecosystems.
Fire
One consequence of aridity is the vulnerability of the vegetation to fire. Lightning-­
caused fires have always been a natural occurrence, although this pattern was modi-
fied with the arrival of the original native inhabitants of Australia, who practiced 
J. D. Majer et al.

197
frequent, low-intensity mosaic burning. This new regime of burning continued for 
at least 40,000 years until the time when Europeans arrived, which led to depopula-
tion of some areas and replacing the mosaic burns with less frequent, but large-scale 
hot fires associated as a result of some of their activities. Whichever the scenario, 
fire has been an evolutionary force to which the biota would be expected to show a 
range of adaptations.
Three invertebrate taxa have been the focus of fire studies in the arid zone: spi-
ders (Langlands et al. 2006, 2011, 2012), scorpions (Smith and Morton 1990) and 
ants (Andersen and Yen 1985; Andersen et al. 2012, 2014 and references therein; 
Gunawardene and Majer 2005). This is a fortuitous combination of taxa, as the for-
mer are largely present above the ground surface, although burrowing species such 
as trapdoor spiders are an exception, whereas many scorpions and ants of the arid 
zone are soil or dead wood nesters, thus allowing comparison of the impact of fire 
on exposed versus more protected organisms.
The first spider study compared the influence of seasonality, inter-year rainfall 
and fire on spider assemblages in the Great Victoria Desert of Western Australia 
(Langlands et al. 2006). Spiders were trapped over a 14-year period from plots with 
a range of fire histories that were part of a before-after-control-impact (BACI) 
experimental fire study including multiple taxa. They found that there was indeed an 
effect of fire, with initial reductions in spider abundance following a fire, but rainfall 
appeared to have the dominant influence, both seasonally and between years. 
Langlands et al. (2011, 2012) followed this study up at Lorna Glen Conservation 
Park, near Wiluna in Western Australia. This time, they used a chronosequence 
approach, with replicated sites representing areas burnt experimentally (0 and 
0.5 years) and areas burnt by wildfires (3, 5, 8 and 20+ years since the last fire). The 
changes in species richness, evenness and composition immediately after the fire 
were equivocal, possibly due to issues associated with the small-scale experimental 
burns in these younger plots (0 and 0.5 years), but large reductions in richness and 
evenness and changes in species composition were evident by 3 years after the fire 
(Fig. 5).There were clear trends in recovery of richness and evenness and species 
composition thereafter, with convergence towards the prefire situation. Both papers 
concerning this study revealed particular spider species that were characteristic of 
certain stages after the fire, indicating the value of having a diversity of fire histories 
to support a greater biodiversity of spiders.
The scorpion study followed scorpion abundance 1, 2, 5 and 8 years after fire in 
the Tanami Desert of the Northern Territory (Smith and Morton 1990). Five species 
were present, but only one species, Lychas alexandrines, was sufficiently abundant 
to allow statistical analysis. Captures were moderate in all postfire stages but were 
significantly greater 2 years after the fire than in the other stages. Scorpions exhib-
ited a better index of body condition 5 years after burning. It was concluded that 
populations reacted to changes in the vegetation and that mid-stages in the postfire 
succession supported more active and relatively larger scorpions.
One of the earliest studies on the effect of fire on ants in the arid zone is that of 
Andersen and Yen (1985), who followed the impact of an intense wildfire in the 
Terrestrial and Inland-water Invertebrates of the Australian Arid Zone

semiarid Mallee region of Victoria. As with spiders, there was an initial reduction in 
the abundance of ants, but this was largely due to reductions of those species that 
previously foraged in high numbers above ground, most notably the dominant doli-
choderine Iridomyrmex spp., and to a lesser extent certain Monomorium and 
Melophorus ants. A seeming paradox was that the number of species falling into the 
pitfall traps doubled after the fire. Although this result could partly be explained by 
sampling biases, as ants are more likely to encounter and fall into pitfall traps in the 
now simplified environment, the authors postulated that much of the increase could 
be due to a relaxation of competition from previously dominant ants, most notably 
the Iridomyrmex species.
A more recent study is that of Gunawardene and Majer (2005), who studied the 
impact of a wildfire in two types of spinifex grassland and a mulga community. As 
with the previous study, there was an apparent increase in number of ant species in 
two of the three vegetation associations. An ordination analysis of species composi-
tion indicated a changed profile in the burnt sites for all three vegetation associa-
tions, with the ant fauna of the three burnt sites becoming slightly more homogenous 
than they were before the fire. Notwithstanding, the authors concluded that the 
impact of fire on ants was not profound and that it was difficult to generalise about 
the effect of fire in different vegetation associations.
The effects of fires in the tropical savannas of northern Australia have been well 
studied. Although this area does not classify as arid Australia in the strict sense, the 
issues are similar and the findings relevant. The group’s findings are collated in two 
recent publications (Andersen et al. 2012, 2014), with the earlier paper also consid-
ering impacts on vertebrates. The motivation for these studies is the notion that 
pyrodiversity has generally been regarded as a means to enhance biodiversity, which 
in turn has led to an interest in patch mosaic burning to create a heterogeneous land-
scape of different fire histories (Parr and Brockett 1999).
To evaluate the notion of fire being used to enhance biodiversity, Andersen et al. 
(2014) evaluated ant abundance, species richness and composition in six experi-
mental fire regimes with varying fire frequency and seasonality. Ants were sampled 
prior to the burns and then annually for 5 years. The authors found no significant 
difference in any of the ant response variables when individual fire treatments were 
compared with each other. It was only when treatments were bulked into two con-
trasting fire frequencies (low – once every 5 years; high every 1 or 2 years) that 
differences could be detected and then only after 3 years of fire treatment. Frequent 
burning seemed to encourage dominant dolichoderine Iridomyrmex spp. and hot-­
climate specialists. By contrast, the increased shade associated with dense plant 
growth in long unburnt areas increased shade-tolerant genera such as Nylanderia, 
Tetramorium, Pheidole and Odontomachus. These results highlight the high degree 
of resilience that ants have to fire and suggest that for ants at least, it is only neces-
sary to create a landscape of two widely contrasting fire regimes, rather than one of 
areas with multiple fire histories.
The results on ants, and perhaps those for scorpions, contrast with those for spi-
ders, which, as mentioned, are much less resilient to fire and exhibit preferences for 
Terrestrial and Inland-water Invertebrates of the Australian Arid Zone

particular phases in the postfire succession. They also align to a much lesser extent 
to impacts on vertebrate fauna that, it is suggested, require less frequent and finer-­
scale fires plus the provision of large, infrequently burnt source areas (Andersen 
et al. 2012). There is also a need for studies on other invertebrate groups, particu-
larly of those that have a greater dependence on the vegetation such as the hemip-
teran orders or butterflies and moths.
Resilience to Other Disturbances in the Arid Zone
In addition to the influence of fire, the arid zone is under the impact of a range of 
human-related activities, such as agriculture, feral animals, tourism pressure and 
mining. It is important to understand how resilient the arid zone is in comparison 
with habitats in more mesic areas. In order to provide the context for this, it is desir-
able to have comparable data from a range of climatic zones. The rate of return of 
insects in rehabilitated minesites provides one example where comparable data are 
available. Using mean number of ant species that have colonised at 3 years as a 
measure of resilience, Majer (1990) found that in areas outside of the arid zone, the 
rate of return of species tends to drop in a linear relationship as rainfall, and favour-
able distribution of rainfall throughout the year, decreased. Although this finding is 
for ants, the richness and composition of ant faunas tend to be a good surrogate for 
other invertebrate taxa (Majer et al. 2007) which suggests that it is not just ants, but 
the invertebrate fauna as a whole, that is less resilient to disturbance in areas of 
lower rainfall.
A series of studies on rehabilitated minesites situated deeper into the arid zone 
has produced some unexpected results, however. For instance, in Pilbara iron ore 
mines, Dunlop et al. (1985) found twice as many ant species in 3-year-old areas than 
would be expected from the linear rainfall-ant resilience relationship described in 
Majer (1990). What is the reason for this apparent anomaly? To understand this it is 
useful to consider the arid zone in terms of Southwood’s (1977) habitat template. 
The template condenses the variety of habitats onto two axes equivalent to their 
favourableness (particularly for breeding) and predictability (Fig. 6). Within each of 
these zones of the template, there is selection for organisms with particular ecologi-
cal strategies. For instance, highly fecund pioneer or opportunistic species, more 
correctly termed r-strategists, are favoured in less predictable environments such as 
temporary pools, transient decomposition habitats and arable land. On the other 
hand, more numerically constant species, whose numbers remain near their carrying 
capacity, are selected for in more predictable and generally favourable environ-
ments such as oligotrophic lakes, rainforest leaf litter and climax forest communi-
ties. These are known as K-strategists. Biological diversity is usually high in these 
habitats, as selection is for specialisation, and mechanisms to ensure individual and 
progeny survival. An adversity, or A-selection strategy, is selected for in habitats

zone. The harshness of these environments leads to low species diversity, so there 
may be little interaction between species. In consequence, selection is for adapta-
tion to the physical environment, for low energy cost resting stages, and for mecha-
nisms to ensure synchrony of activity when favourable conditions resume. It should 
be stressed that the three types of selection intergrade with each other and that there 
are no clear boundaries between them.
So, where does an area of a recently disturbed minesite fall on the habitat tem-
plate? Prior to rehabilitation being carried out, the degraded land is usually charac-
terised by a low spatial complexity, an absence of biological diversity, a harsh 
microclimate and, in biological terms, an extremely unpredictable future. These 
conditions place the degraded area within the r-selecting region of the habitat tem-
plate or, in the case of the arid zone, within or close to the adversity region of the 
template (Fig. 6). The pool of organisms available to colonise the rehabilitated area 
is therefore moulded by the type of surrounding environment in which the disturbed 
land is located. Disturbed land that occurs within an r and/or A selecting environ-
ments should have a large pool of suitably adapted species that can colonise the area 
which is not necessarily the case for more predictable and mesic environments. This 
may explain why resilience of rehabilitated minesites in certain arid zones may be 
much greater than expected from rainfall alone.
The findings from these minesite studies relate to a type of disturbance where the 
succession has been deliberately enhanced by the introduction of seeds and plant

predictability, habitat favourableness, biological diversity and complexity and selection processes. 
The K-, r-, and A-selecting regions are areas in which each type of selection tends to predominate.

propagules. The degree to which areas that have been left to recover naturally, such 
as areas where grazing has been removed, remains to be compared with more mesic 
areas in terms of their resilience.
Edible Insects
A less obvious type of invertebrate information from the arid parts of Australia 
involved Aboriginal use of invertebrates as food, as medicine, or as part of their 
cultural beliefs. This information was generally collected by nonbiologists, explor-
ers, anthropologists and missionaries. Consequently, while information is available 
in publications by these nonbiologists, these claims were rarely backed up by speci-
mens, so the identities of many of them cannot be considered accurate. More accu-
rate information was obtained by a few biologists such as Spencer (1896a) and 
Tindale (1953), who retained specimens.
Insects were a significant component of Aboriginal diet in Australia (Yen 2005), 
possibly of greater importance in the arid regions (Tindale 1981). Eyre (1845) dis-
cusses use of grubs from Xanthorrhoea, some unidentified grubs and white ants 
used as food by the Aborigines as well as honey from native bees. There were obser-
vations on insect foods during the Horn Expedition (Spencer 1896a) and early 
reviews by Froggatt (1903), Campbell (1926), McKeown (1936, 1945) and Tindale 
(1966). In arid Australia, much emphasis is placed on two types of edible insects: 
wood-feeding grubs (commonly called witchetty grubs or bardi grubs) and honey 
ants. There is only one species of honey ant commonly used as food, Camponotus 
inflatus (Devitt 1986), from which the gaster and contained liquid are eaten, but the 
identity of the various edible grubs that are consumed is still to be resolved. Tindale 
(1953) made observations on the witchetty (witjuti) grub Endoxyla leucomorpha, 
but there are many different species of edible grubs from amongst the moths 
(Cossidae, Hepialidae and possibly Sphingidae) and beetles (Cerambycidae). This 
diversity is reflected by the Aboriginal ethnospecies names found across the many 
different Aboriginal languages (Latz 1995; Yen et  al. 1997; Turpin (2013). In 
September 2015, the Bush Blitz programme included Aboriginal edible insects in 
the survey conducted in the Kiwirrkurra Indigenous Protected Area in the Gibson 
Desert, Western Australia (ALYen, unpublished data).
Aboriginal traditional knowledge on edible insects has ecologically important 
information about the host plant identities of the plant-feeding species and the biol-
ogy of the insects including phenology and behaviour. Sustainable utilisation of 
these insects was controlled by cultural practices such as totemism, increase cere-
monies (ceremonies to increase numbers of plants and animals) and appropriate 
firing of the country if required (Yen 2014). There are important dreaming locations 
for insects, both edible and nonedible species. One of the better-known stories is 
about the Yeperenye caterpillar, one of the insect species responsible for the forma-
tion of the ranges around Alice Springs (Brooks 2003).

Status of Biodiversity in the Arid Zone
Since the human population is sparse in the arid zone, decreasing still further towards 
the interior of the country, its impact on biodiversity should be less than elsewhere 
in the country. To quantify this, Majer and Beeston (1996) devised a biodiversity 
integrity index to portray the status of the composition and richness of biodiversity 
in different geographic zones of Western Australia. It first quantified the percentage 
of land covered by each of the major land uses in each geographic zone, namely, 
urbanisation, transport corridors, mining, agricultural clearing and rangeland graz-
ing. It then incorporated the degree to which each of these land uses altered biodiver-
sity of focus taxa. The biodiversity integrity index was then calculated for each zone 
as a product of the area occupied by each land use and the degree to which each land 
use altered biodiversity, with 100 being the pristine state of each geographic zone.
The biodiversity integrity index used ant assemblages as the response group on 
which to base calculations which is fortuitous as ants tend to be good surrogates 
(sensu McGeoch 1998) for the diversity and species composition of other taxa 
(Majer et al. 2007). The geographic zones used were Beard’s (1990) phytogeo-
graphic regions. Figure 7 shows the outcome of this exercise, with darker areas 
indicating progressively more intact biodiversity. It is evident from this that biodi-
versity is more intact in the extreme-arid interior of Western Australia, although it 
declines as we move westwards and northwards with the influence of rangeland 
grazing, mining and a general increase in human activity.
Of course, this only provides a coarse snapshot of the status of biodiversity, as 
there are other degrading influences acting upon invertebrate biodiversity through-
out the arid regions. Influences such as feral animals, altered fire regimes, mine 
exploration and tourist pressure all impact on soil and vegetation, which undoubt-
edly have flow-on effects to invertebrates (Naeem et al. 1995). In addition, although 
Western Australia has clearing bans in place for much of the arid zone, other more 
populous States, such as Queensland, still clear large areas of plant communities 
such as brigalow, so the arid interior there may not necessarily be in the same condi-
tion as in Western Australia. However, as a generalisation, invertebrate biodiversity 
does seem to be in a better state in the less populated arid zones than in the areas 
closer to the coast where the influence of humans is greater.
Concluding Comment
This review of invertebrates in the arid zone has only grazed the surface of our 
knowledge on their diversity and biology. A more comprehensive account would 
merit an entire volume or set of volumes, even though there is still much to be 
learned about the fauna of the arid zone. Nevertheless, we hope that the presentation 
of this information will encourage others to initiate detailed and long-term investi-
gations into this important component of the biota Australia’s arid zone.

Subterranean Fauna of the Arid Zone
Stuart A. Halse
Introduction
Subterranean fauna can be divided into two broad groups – stygofauna are aquatic 
and occur in groundwater, while troglofauna are air-breathing and occur in the 
unsaturated zone from depths of a metre or so below the ground surface down to the 
water table. Defining exactly which species are covered by the term subterranean 
fauna is quite complex, because of the different life histories of many vertebrate and 
invertebrate species, and the habitat differences between caves and the much more 
extensive, but less studied underground matrix outside caves. However, a useful 
starting point for understanding the general characteristics of subterranean species 
is provided by various schemes that categorise species according to their depen-
dence on the underground environment. These schemes are discussed in detail by 
Sket (2008), but, in summary, species occurring only in the aphotic zone of caves or 
deep underground are classified as troglobites or stygobites (Table 1). The terms 
troglophiles and stygophiles are applied to species found in parts of caves where 
there is some penetration of light or to species that use surface habitats for one (usu-
ally short) part of their life history. Occasionally, troglophilic or stygophilic species 
may have some surface populations and some wholly subterranean populations. The 
third category, trogloxenes and stygoxenes, is applied to primarily surface species 
that regularly make use of caves or underground habitats, often as a refugium during 
periods of adverse conditions (such as drought) in their usual surface habitat.
In this chapter, the terms subterranean fauna, troglofauna and stygofauna refer 
principally to troglobites, stygobites, troglophiles and stygophiles (Table  1). 
Species in these categories are clearly dependent on caves and other subterranean 
habitats for their survival. Trogloxenes and stygoxenes are mostly excluded from 
coverage, although there are occasions and situations in which subterranean habi-

tat is ­important for these species. Bats and cave-nesting birds are excluded from 
consideration, largely because this chapter deals with what is happening in the 
broad landscape outside caves. Aquatic invertebrates found in the bed of streams 
are also not treated as subterranean for the purpose of this chapter, although, glob-
ally, much study of stygofauna is conducted in stream beds (Hancock et al. 2005; 
Dole-Olivier et al. 2009). Similarly, there is little consideration of fish and reptiles, 
because nearly all subterranean fauna species in Australia are invertebrates, 
although some stygofauna fish and troglofaunal reptiles do occur (e.g. Aplin 1998; 
Larson et al. 2013).
The major difference between this chapter and most accounts of subterranean 
fauna is the focus on underground habitats other than caves. Globally, most subter-
ranean fauna studies deal with caves. However, the arid zone of Australia has very 
few large caves; in fact, there are arguably only two large cave systems in the arid 
zone. These are on the Nullarbor Plain (Webb and James 2006) and around 
Camooweal, north-west of Mount Isa (Grimes 1988; Eberhard 2003) (Fig.  1). 
Despite their large size, both systems have relatively depauperate subterranean fau-
nas (Richards 1971; Eberhard 2003) which is perhaps unsurprising given the lack of 
wider occurrence of caves. Other cave systems on the edge of the arid zone, such as 
the Judbarra/Gregory karst area in the Northern Territory, are also depauperate 
(Moulds and Bannick 2012) (Fig. 1). Largely as a result of the paucity of cave fauna 
and the traditional emphasis of subterranean fauna studies on caves, it is only during 
the last 20 years that the richness of the Australian arid zone subterranean fauna 
outside caves has begun to be appreciated (Guzik et al. 2010).
This chapter provides a summary of current information on subterranean fauna 
in the Australian arid zone, particularly in the western half of the arid zone where 
most richness appears to occur. Some of the main issues in contemporary subterra-
nean fauna research are discussed, together with issues that are relevant to the con-
servation of that subterranean fauna. A recent account with greater focus on the 
evolution of subterranean fauna in Australia is provided by Humphreys (2016).

Subterranean Fauna Habitats
While many stygofauna species occur in groundwater below stream beds and in 
cave streams and ponds, most of this chapter deals with stygofauna in deeper 
regional aquifers that extend more widely across the landscape. The habitats of 
troglofauna outside caves are less well documented, but in general terms they com-
prise the habitat between the ‘dry’ ground surface and the water table. This habitat 
is often referred to as the vadose zone (e.g. Halse and Pearson 2014), although the 
term ‘unsaturated zone’ is also apt. Juberthie (1983) was the first to pay much atten-
tion to the unsaturated zone, although his focus was on the upper part of the zone, 
and he applied the term milieu souterrain superficial (MSS) to shallow detrital habi-
tats across the landscape that support troglofauna (see also Mammola et al. 2016). 
Culver and Pipan (2008) applied the term shallow superficial habitats (SSH) to a 
wider variety of situations (including near-surface stygofauna habitat) but in doing 
so implied that caves comprised the major deep subterranean habitat. This is not the 
case in the Pilbara and Yilgarn regions of Western Australia, where stygofauna and 
troglofauna may be found tens of metres below the surface in various types of very 
small spaces that are widespread across the landscape. These small spaces are 
mostly what Howarth (1983) termed microcaverns (<5 mm in width) or, less com-
monly, mesocaverns (5–500  mm) (Fig.  2). A variety of other terms are used to 
describe the spaces, with the names often providing some information about their 
genesis [e.g. interstitial spaces in alluvium, vugs (or small spaces) in weathered 
rock, fissures in fractured rock].
The factors determining the occurrence of subterranean fauna are still in the 
early stages of investigation. While the size, pattern and quantity of spaces in a habi-
tat is important for the occurrence of fauna, poor connectivity with the surface may 
constrain the number of species present (Halse et al. 2014), because most energy (as 
carbon) comes from the surface. Studies elsewhere suggest that the chemistry of the 
host substrate is not particularly important in most cases beyond its influence on 
habitat structure (Hahn and Fuchs 2009). The importance of spaces to the occur-
rence of subterranean fauna is most clearly documented for stygofauna, where the 
likelihood of species occurring is related in a positive way to the transmissivity of 
the aquifer (Maurice and Bloomfield 2012). At the same time, studies by Bradford 
et al. (2013) and others have shown there is currently poor understanding of how the 
finer details of habitat structure affect subterranean fauna occurrence. One example 
of fine-scale variation in occurrence, however, is provided by Hose et al. (2017) who 
showed differences in the abundance of stygofauna species in different alluvial sub-
strates over vertical distances of less than 1 m. Such fine-scale control of distribu-
tions probably occurs in many species.
While predictions about the suitability of habitats for subterranean fauna at a fine 
scale tend to be unreliable, existing work enables some general observations to be 
made. Despite subterranean fauna occurring in a wide range of geologies in the arid 
zone, they tend to occur most abundantly in three broad geological units: karst 
(especially calcrete), alluvium and colluvium and mineralised or weathered iron

formations, especially banded iron formation and channel iron deposit. They are 
sometimes abundant in weathered volcanics and ultramafics but mostly occur in low 
numbers in other geologies.
The relationship between large numbers of stygofauna and calcrete bodies in 
palaeochannels in the Yilgarn region of Western Australia is well documented 
(Humphreys 2001, 2008; Guzik et al. 2010), with up to 75 species recorded from a 
single calcrete body (EPA 2016a). Another well-studied relationship is the occur-
rence of large numbers of troglofauna species in mineralised banded iron forma-
tions and channel iron deposits of the Pilbara, with more than 120 species being 
recorded from sections of banded iron formation in the Hamersley Range and up to 
25 species being recorded from individual small mesas in the Robe Valley (Harvey

et al. 2008; G. Humphreys and M. Curran, unpublished data). It should also be 
noted that it is not uncommon for a site to yield high numbers of stygofauna and low 
numbers of troglofauna or vice versa. This is sometimes the result of different geol-
ogies in the unsaturated zone and in the underlying groundwater aquifer; in other 
situations the flow of water may have kept spaces open in the aquifer, whereas they 
have been filled by fine sediment in the unsaturated zone.
Environmental Parameters
While physical habitat structure, connectivity and the extent of surface connection 
are determinants of subterranean fauna occurrence across the broad landscape 
matrix, some of the factors critical to subterranean fauna occurrence in caves are 
equally important across the landscape. These include the absence of light, stable 
temperatures and, in the non-saturated zone, high relative humidity (Culver and 
Pipan 2008). Differences in relative humidity are probably a key factor distinguish-
ing between the habitats of soil fauna and subterranean fauna in the arid zone, with 
subterranean habitats probably usually being very close to saturated (Fig. 3), while 
surface habitats in the Pilbara and Yilgarn are often quite dry as a consequence of 
annual pan evaporation being 3000–5000 mm.
Groundwater in much of the arid zone is saline, and salinity is another factor 
potentially controlling the occurrence of species in groundwater, in the same way as 
it does in surface systems (Pinder et al. 2005). While it has been widely thought that 
stygofauna in the Pilbara and Yilgarn are unlikely to occur at salinities much above 
seawater concentration (35,000  mg  L−1 or 50,000  μS cm−1) (e.g. Watts and 
Fig. 3  Relative humidity through the year at a depth of 15 m in an iron ore mesa in the Pilbara. 
Measuring humidity near saturation is technically difficult, and the data are interpreted as showing 
100% relative humidity throughout the year
S. A. Halse

221
Humphreys 2006), there are recent records of stygofauna in the northern Yilgarn at 
salinities of approximately 100,000 mg L−1 (Outback Ecology 2012). Despite these 
records suggesting some stygofauna species are strongly salt-adapted, most species 
are restricted to salinities of less than 10,000 mg L−1 in the Pilbara (Halse et al. 
2014) and 25,000 mg L−1 in the Yilgarn (Humphreys et al. 2009) (Fig. 4). The 
broader environmental tolerances of stygofauna in Australia have been reviewed by 
Korbel and Hose (2011).
Subterranean Fauna of the Western Shield
Sampling of stygofauna outside caves in the arid zone began only in the late 1990s, 
when Bill Humphreys and colleagues extended their coastal sampling at Cape 
Range into the Pilbara and Yilgarn regions of Western Australia (Pesce et al. 1996; 
Humphreys 1999, 2001). Troglofauna sampling began about 10 years later, with the 
collection of schizomids and other troglofauna in the Robe Valley in the Pilbara 
(Harvey et al. 2008). Examples of the fauna collected are shown in Fig. 5.
As the amount of sampling of both stygofauna and troglofauna has increased, the 
richness of these two groups in arid parts of Western Australia has become ever 
more apparent. For example, Humphreys (2008) reported the occurrence of 560 
stygofauna species on the Western Shield (principally the Pilbara and Yilgarn 
regions) (Fig. 1). This was followed by Eberhard et al. (2009) estimating, based on 
a regional sampling program, that 500–550 stygofauna species occur in the Pilbara 
alone, after which Guzik et al. (2010) estimated that 4140 subterranean fauna spe-
cies, comprising 2680 stygofauna and 1460 troglofauna species, occur in the west-
ern half of Australia, mostly in the arid zone. More recent work suggests that even 
Guzik et al.’s (2010) large figure underestimates the richness of the fauna.
Halse (2015) proposed, based on a combination of sampling results and extrapo-
lation based on the pattern of increasing richness seen with additional sampling, that 
nearly 3000 species of subterranean fauna occur in the Pilbara (Table 2). While they

do not represent systematic sampling, the results of surveys for environmental 
impact assessments suggest that the Yilgarn has similar stygofauna richness to that 
in the Pilbara but fewer troglofauna species. Therefore, it is considered likely that 
more than 4500 stygofauna and troglofauna species occur in the Pilbara and Yilgarn 
and that approximately 5500 subterranean species occur in the western half of 
Australia. By way of context, the known vascular plant richness in the Pilbara is less 
than 1800 species, with approximately 15% of these being endemic to the region 
(Erickson and Merritt 2016). Nearly all stygofauna and troglofauna species in the 
Pilbara (and Yilgarn and elsewhere) are endemic to the region in which they occur 
(Humphreys et al. 2009; Halse et al. 2014).
New comparisons of the richness of subterranean fauna in the Western Shield 
with other parts of the world are not made here, because there are substantial differ-

ences in the habitats that have been sampled in different countries, what species are 
treated as subterranean and the way in which numbers of species have been deter-
mined (Culver et al. 2013). However, both Halse et al. (2014) and Guzik et al. 
(2010) provide some comparisons between the richness of stygofauna in the Pilbara 
and western half of the arid zone and the richness of assemblages in other parts of 
the world. Halse et al. (2014) suggested the Pilbara has higher known density of 
stygofauna species than any other region in the world, except the Dinaric karst in 
south-eastern Europe, while Guzik et al. (2010) suggested arid Australia is uniquely 
rich in stygofauna compared with other areas of the world. Few easy comparisons 
of troglofauna richness can be made, because regional inventories are rarely com-
piled, but, with an estimated 1511 species, the Pilbara is likely to be one of the rich-
est regions in the world for troglofauna. Only 995 troglofauna species have been 
recorded in the well-studied Dinaric karst (Sket et  al. 2004), which is widely 
regarded as an area of global importance for troglofauna.
Stygofauna
A detailed account of the stygofauna of the Pilbara is given by Halse et al. (2014). 
Information on the Yilgarn is less consolidated, and the first moderately comprehen-
sive overview is provided here, although general information is also available in 
Humphreys (2001) and Humphreys et al. (2009).
There is relatively little overlap in composition of stygofauna assemblages below 
the stream bed and in deeper groundwater aquifers of the Pilbara (Halse et al. 2002, 
2014). This is probably because the groundwater associated with the alluvium of the 
ephemeral rivers and creeks of the Western Shield is poorly connected to regional 
groundwater (Dogramaci et  al. 2012). Thus, while some species typical of the 
streambed fauna are found in regional aquifers, such as darwinulid ostracods, the 
candonid ostracod Candonocypris tenuis, many cyclopoid copepods and possibly 
phreatoicid isopods (Knott and Halse 1999; Schön et al. 2010; Pinder et al. 2010), 
the reverse rarely occurs.
The stygofauna assemblages of the Pilbara and Yilgarn show similar patterns at 
higher taxonomic levels, despite some differences in the proportions of the major 
groups (Fig. 6). Further comments on six of the groups are made here. First, based 
on the number of animals collected, copepods dominate stygofaunal communities 
of both the Pilbara and Yilgarn, comprising approximately 60% of the fauna in the 
Yilgarn and 40% in the Pilbara. However, copepod species are often represented by 
large numbers of animals, and, based on species richness, copepods comprise 44% 
of the fauna in the Yilgarn and 20% in the Pilbara (Halse et al. 2014; S. Halse, 
unpublished data). Complementing this overall picture, there appears to have been 
explosive speciation of harpacticoid copepods in some calcretes of the Yilgarn 
(Karanovic and Cooper 2011, 2012), where copepod species may represent almost 
half of the species at a site. As already noted, global comparisons are difficult to 
make, because of differences in habitats sampled and analytical methods, but cope-

225
pods may be regarded as comprising 17% of the species in a typical stygofauna 
community elsewhere (Eberhard et al. 2005) or 20–40% of the species in European 
communities (Galassi et al. 2009). The diversity of copepods in the Pilbara con-
forms to global patterns, while the diversity in the Yilgarn is relatively high.
Ostracods represent 24% and 13%, respectively, of the stygofaunal animals in 
the Pilbara and Yilgarn (Fig. 6) and 30% and 10% of the species in these regions. 
The greater contribution of ostracod species in the Pilbara reflects the enormous 
radiation of candonid ostracods in this region, consisting of 11 described endemic 
genera and more than 108 collected species (Reeves et al. 2007; Karanovic 2007; 
S.A. Halse, unpublished data). By global standards, where ostracods typically con-
stitute about 3% of species in groundwater communities (Eberhard et al. 2005), both 
the Pilbara and Yilgarn are rich in ostracods.

groups. (a) Pilbara species, (b) Pilbara abundance, (c) Yilgarn species, and (d) Yilgarn abundance
Subterranean Fauna of the Arid Zone

226
Another outstanding characteristic of the stygofauna of the Yilgarn is the occur-
rence of more than 90 described species of dytiscid beetle in it and nearby regions 
(Watts and Humphreys 2009; Eberhard et al. 2016). In contrast, there is only one 
described beetle species in the Pilbara (Watts and McRae 2013), and this disparity, 
together with the difference in abundance of candonid ostracods, forms the clearest 
indications of the biogeographic differences between the Pilbara and Yilgarn. 
Despite their diversity, beetles are not a dominant component of the Yilgarn fauna in 
terms of either animal abundance or species richness. Beetles represent 0.01% and 
2.2%, respectively, of the animals in the Pilbara and Yilgarn and 0.01% and 4.5% of 
the species in these regions. (Far more sites, including some outside the Yilgarn, 
have been sampled for beetles than for other stygofaunal groups which is why a 
larger number of species have been described than their proportional representation 
in the Yilgarn suggests.)
Amphipods are common in most stygofauna communities, typically representing 
about 19% of species globally. They represent 16% and 7%, respectively, of the 
animals in the Pilbara and Yilgarn (Fig. 6) and 17% and 20% of the species in these 
regions (Halse et al. 2014; S.A. Halse, unpublished data). Much of the focus of 
Yilgarn and Pilbara stygofauna research has been on amphipods (Finston et  al. 
2004, 2007; Cooper et al. 2007; Bradford et al. 2010, 2013; King et al. 2012), and 
comparisons of the results of this research with that from the northern hemisphere 
provide some insights into the different factors structuring communities in Australia 
and Europe.
Syncarids comprise 3.1% and 4.1%, respectively, of the stygofaunal animals in 
the Pilbara and Yilgarn and 11% of the stygofaunal species in both regions. This is 
a substantially larger proportion of the stygofauna community than is typically rep-
resented elsewhere by syncarids (Eberhard et al. 2005). Despite the relatively high 
number of species present and some recent morphological (e.g. Cho 2005; Cho and 
Humphreys 2010) and genetic work (e.g. Guzik et al. 2008), there is relatively poor 
understanding of the diversity and distributions of syncarids in the Pilbara and 
Yilgarn, especially for the family Bathynellidae (Perina et al. 2018).
Oligochaetes represent 9% and 8%, respectively, of the stygofaunal animals in 
the Pilbara and Yilgarn (Fig. 5) and 11% and 8% of the species, compared with a 
global average of 2% of the species in stygofauna communities (Eberhard et al. 
2005). Many oligochaetes are quite widespread, and the proportion of stygobitic 
species in groundwater communities is often quite low (Creuze des Chatelliers et al. 
2009), which may have affected global calculations. However, the greater number 
of stygal species in the Pilbara and Yilgarn is mostly attributable to the collection of 
relatively large numbers of enchytraeid species, despite phreodrilids and other oli-
gochaete groups also occurring (Pinder 2008; Brown et al. 2015). Only 11% of the 
stygofaunal oligochaete species listed by Creuze des Chatelliers et al. (2009) are 
enchytraeids, which are considered to be a predominantly terrestrial family with 
unstable taxonomy and uncertain ecological attributes, whereas they comprise 31% 
of Pilbara and 50% of Yilgarn oligochaete species.

Troglofauna
Information on the occurrence of troglofauna outside caves comes almost entirely 
from environmental impact assessment surveys associated with mining proposals 
and is strongly biased towards the sampling of hard rock geologies. Areas of cal-
crete have usually been sampled at low intensity, if at all, because of the difficulty 
maintaining open holes without casings of soft substrata. Halse and Pearson (2014) 
have provided an analysis of the taxonomic composition of troglofauna in the 
Pilbara, but the first account of the overall composition of Yilgarn troglofaunal 
assemblages is presented here.
One of the peculiarities of the information on troglofauna in the Pilbara and 
Yilgarn is that there has been no attempt to assess the occurrence of troglofaunal 
mites and collembolans. Both groups occur as subterranean fauna in other parts of 
the world (Ortuño et al. 2013; Kováč et al. 2016) and have been observed in Pilbara 
and Yilgarn samples (Greenslade 2002). Leaving aside mites and collembolans, 
there are substantial differences between the troglofaunal assemblages of the Pilbara 
and Yilgarn, with isopods dominating the Yilgarn fauna and several of the groups 
that are prominent in the Pilbara (cockroaches, schizomids, dipterans) being absent, 
or nearly so, from the Yilgarn (Fig. 7). The occurrence of 10 groups is considered in 
detail.
Based on the number of animals collected, isopods comprise 6% and 43% of the 
troglofauna abundance in the Pilbara and Yilgarn, respectively. The difference 
between the regions is reduced somewhat when species richness is examined, with 
isopods comprising 12% of troglofauna species in the Pilbara and 30% of those in 
the Yilgarn. Comparisons of these proportions with typical troglofaunal communi-
ties elsewhere in the world are difficult to make, because of differences in the habi-
tats sampled (cave or broader unsaturated zone), the completeness of lists and 
whether lists include all troglofauna species or only troglobites. Nevertheless, the 
Yilgarn appears to have an unusually high proportion of isopods compared with 
other parts of the world, such as the Balkan Peninsula and various high-yielding 
sites where, in both cases, 12% of species are isopods (Culver and Sket 2000; Sket 
et al. 2004). On the other hand, in the small fauna of Portugal, isopods occur in 
proportions similar to the Yilgarn (26% of species; Reboleira et al. 2013). More 
than 72 troglofauna isopod species have been recorded in the Yilgarn, including 20 
troglomorphic species listed by Javidkar et al. (2016) that are not included in Fig. 7. 
This is nearly three times as many isopod species as recorded from Brazilian caves 
(Campos-Filho et  al. 2014), albeit that very few Yilgarn isopods are described 
(Taiti 2014).
Hemipterans, mostly belonging to the family Meenoplidae, are very abundant in 
the Pilbara and to a lesser extent the Yilgarn, representing 23% and 10%, respec-
tively, of all animals, but only 3.4% of the troglofauna species in each region 
(Fig. 7). Some troglophilic meenoplid species are widespread in the Pilbara and 
Yilgarn. Other potentially troglobitic species appear to have small ranges, but fur-
ther taxonomic and ecological work is required to confirm their status as troglobitic. 
Subterranean Fauna of the Arid Zone

228
Culver and Pipan (2008) considered troglobitic hemipterans to be more common in 
shallow subterranean habitats than caves, although meenoplid species considered to 
be troglobitic are found in caves of northern Australia (Hoch 1993; Moulds and 
Banninck 2012).
Cockroaches, mostly belonging to the family Nocticolidae, are also very abun-
dant in the Pilbara, where they represent 19% of animals but only 4% of all 
­troglofauna species. However, cockroaches are one of the many groups in which use 
of genetic species concepts is likely to substantially increase the number of species 
recognised (Trotter et  al. 2017). No cockroaches have been collected from the 
Yilgarn. Elsewhere, cockroaches often occur in low numbers (Roth 1991; Moulds 
and Banninck 2012), and their diversity in the unsaturated zone of the Pilbara 
appears to be comparatively high.

229
Millipedes are relatively abundant in both the Pilbara and Yilgarn, representing 
9% and 6% of all troglofaunal animals, respectively, in these regions (Fig.  7). 
However, this is largely the result of the widespread occurrence of the circum-­
tropical, troglophilic Lophoturus madecassus (see Car et al. 2013), and millipedes 
comprise only 3.5% and 1.7% of the species present, respectively, in the two regions. 
In comparison, millipedes comprise 10% of the fauna in the Balkan Peninsula (Sket 
et al. 2004) and 8% of the fauna at selected sites around the world that are rich in 
troglofauna (Culver and Sket 2000).
Schizomids occur moderately often in caves and the unsaturated zone across 
Northern Australia (e.g. Harvey 2001) as well as in the tropics more generally 
(Monjaraz-Ruedas 2013). However, in iron ore ranges of the Pilbara, they are found 
with a diversity that appears to be exceptionally high for the group, and they com-
prise 7% of all animals and 9% of all species in Pilbara troglofaunal assemblages 
(Fig. 7). Some of the diversity of schizomids in the Robe Valley of the Pilbara was 
documented in detail by Harvey et al. (2008), while Harms et al. (2016) have dis-
cussed issues around species delineation in the Hamersley Range. At least in 
Australia, the occurrence of schizomids is indicative of a taxonomically rich troglo-
fauna community. As with cockroaches, schizomids are absent from the Yilgarn.
Diplurans usually comprise a small to moderate proportion of troglofaunal 
assemblages (1.1% in the Balkan peninsula, Sket et al. 2004; 1.4–6% in superficial 
subterranean habitats, Culver and Pipan 2008; 7% in Portugal, Reboleira et  al. 
2013). An unpublished report by Markus Koch in 2009 highlights the richness of 
diplurans in Western Australia, especially in the Pilbara, Yilgarn and Kimberley 
regions. However, troglofaunal dipluran species tend to occur at low abundance and 
comprise only 2.9% and 3.0% of animals in the Pilbara and Yilgarn, respectively,

Subterranean Fauna of the Arid Zone

despite accounting for 13% and 7% of species. In fact, diplurans are the most 
species-­rich troglofaunal group in the Pilbara, although some species are certainly 
troglophiles and the exact proportion of troglobitic species is unclear. The estimated 
median linear range of 4.5 km for Pilbara species (Table 3) suggests the proportion 
of troglobites may be quite high.
Pauropods, symphylans and, perhaps to a lesser extent, palpigrads provide even 
greater difficulty distinguishing troglofauna from surface species, because they 
occur in soil and lack eyes and pigment. While troglobitic palpigrads and sym-
phylans are regularly recorded elsewhere in the world (e.g. Sket et al. 2004), there 
are few records of troglobitic pauropods anywhere (Vandel 1965). However, Halse 
and Pearson (2014) suggested that at least some of the pauropod species collected 
from the unsaturated zone in the Pilbara are likely troglobites, because of their small 
ranges and, more particularly, the hostile surface soil conditions in the hot, arid 
Pilbara. More documentation of the surface soil faunas of pauropods, symphylans 
and palpigrads would help determine the status of species collected in subterranean 
sampling (see Trajano and Bichette 2010). Based on current interpretations of sur-
face and subterranean status, it is considered that all three groups are relatively 
species-rich in subterranean habitats of the Yilgarn and Pilbara. Pauropods, sym-
phylans and palpigrads are thought to comprise 2.8%, 2.3% and 1.5% of all troglo-
faunal animals in the Pilbara and 9%, 9% and 2.0% of Yilgarn animals, respectively 
(Fig. 7). As a result of most species being collected at low abundance, these animals 
represent 4.9%, 5.6% and 2.6% and 6.3%, 13.6% and 2.3% of all troglofaunal spe-
cies, respectively.
Compared with other parts of the world, the low proportions of beetles in the 
troglofauna assemblages of the Pilbara and Yilgarn are quite startling. It is also a 
contrast to the relative richness of stygofaunal beetles in the Yilgarn. Only 6% and 
3% of troglofaunal animals and 10% and 9% of species are beetles in the Pilbara 
and Yilgarn, respectively. Typically, beetles comprise about one-third of the species 
in troglofaunal communities (30% at selected species-rich sites around the world, 
Culver and Sket 2000; 39% in the Balkan Peninsula, Sket et al. 2004; approximately 
40% in Tennessee, Niemiller and Zigler 2013). While further taxonomic investiga-
tions are likely to substantially increase the number of beetles known from the 
Pilbara and Yilgarn (e.g. Baehr and Main 2016; Table 2), beetles are likely to con-
tinue to be poorly represented compared with other parts of the world.
Species Delimitation
In addition to the capacity for study of subterranean fauna in the Pilbara and Yilgarn 
to provide new insights into evolutionary and biogeographic processes (see 
Humphreys 2016), the potential for mining and groundwater abstraction to threaten 
the persistence of subterranean species is an important driver of stygofauna and 
troglofauna research. The process of identifying species as units for conservation 
(whether or not formally described), and, more particularly, the ranges of those

species, is a fundamental step in assessing the likely conservation impacts of mining 
and groundwater developments.
There are challenges for both morphologists and geneticists when it comes to 
delimiting species in subterranean habitats. Identifying species through use of tradi-
tional morphological characters can be difficult, because of the occurrence of both 
convergent evolution on some characters (Ornelas-Garcia et al. 2008) and relaxed 
selection pressure on others that results in phenotypic plasticity, especially in rela-
tion to segmentation and setae on left and right sides of animals (Karanovic et al. 
2013). In addition, the mostly low numbers in which species are collected, and high 
proportions of immature animals, means that the number of suitable specimens for 
morphology is usually very small. Consequently, species descriptions are occasion-
ally based on single immature or damaged animals, making it difficult to achieve 
certainty when trying to align subsequently collected specimens with the described 
species.
Genetic recognition of species can also be challenging, because the likelihood of 
very limited dispersal capacity below ground means genetic structuring within a 
species is to be expected. Consequently, there may be almost as much intraspecific 
as interspecific variation in genes used for species discrimination (e.g. CO1; 
Bradford et al. 2010), which can cause problems in determining the number of spe-
cies present (Ferguson 2002; Ross et al. 2008). The extent of sequence variation 
appears to differ among taxonomic groups, with insects being relatively conserva-
tive (Leys et al. 2003; Guzik et al. 2009), while arachnids and, particularly, crusta-
ceans show greater variation (Harvey et al. 2008; Finston et al. 2007, 2011). Some 
variation in crustaceans in calcrete bodies is likely to be the result of successive 
isolation events for animal populations in refugia within the calcrete, followed by 
expansion events as higher water levels expand the area of saturated calcrete and 
permit wider gene flow. More generally, high intraspecific variability in subterra-
nean fauna is often accompanied by low nucleotide diversity (Guzik et al. 2009; 
Bradford et al. 2013), and it is likely that accurate genetic delimitation of species 
will often require the use of multiple genes (Bazin et al. 2006; Asmyhr and Cooper 
2012; Bradford et al. 2013) and collection of a large number of samples across the 
species’ range (Bergstein et al. 2012). However, adequate sampling is usually dif-
ficult to achieve when access to the species’ habitat is via pre-existing drill holes 
that probably cover only part of the species’ range and, in fact, may often not inter-
sect the species’ preferred microhabitat (Fig. 2).
The way in which sampling and identification effort may affect the recognition 
of troglofauna species was illustrated by Harms et al. (2016), who showed that lim-
ited sampling led to eight species being recognised in the schizomid genus 
Draculoides from a small part of the Hamersley Range. Applying the results of 
barcoding with the CO1 gene and a small amount of additional sampling led to 15 
species being recognised. However, further sampling in the same area and phyloge-
netic analysis using CO1 results reduced this to 12 species. This changing number 
of species highlights the complexity of delimiting species units in the subterranean 
environment, especially when the broad biological characteristics of the environ-
ment are still being investigated and there is a poor ecological and life-history

framework in which to interpret results. Genetic data may provide no clearer guid-
ance about species boundaries than morphological information, and, in such situa-
tions, use of a combination of genetics and morphology likely provides 
better-informed taxonomic decisions (De Queiroz 2007; Javidkar et al. 2016).
Species Distributions
As a group, subterranean fauna species are characterised by small ranges. This is 
especially so for troglofauna species (Halse and Pearson 2014), which in the Pilbara 
appear to have ranges that are mostly at least an order of magnitude smaller than 
those of stygofauna species (Eberhard et al. 2009; Halse et al. 2014). Linear ranges 
of 1–2 km appear to be moderately common among arid-zone troglofauna species 
in Australia (Table 3), while existing data suggest only about 5% of Pilbara stygo-
fauna species are likely to have linear ranges of <30 km (Halse et al. 2014). There 
is probably less difference, however, between ranges of stygofauna and troglofauna 
species in the Yilgarn, particularly in calcretes.
Perhaps the best-known generalisation about the pattern of occurrence of subter-
ranean fauna species is the ‘calcrete island hypothesis’ of Steve Cooper and others 
to explain the restricted distributions of many stygofauna species in calcrete bodies 
of the Yilgarn (Cooper et al. 2002, 2007). It also seems to apply to troglofauna spe-
cies in Yilgarn calcretes (Javidkar et al. 2016). Under this hypothesis, most species 
in calcretes of the Yilgarn region are expected to be restricted to individual calcrete 
bodies that may have linear ranges of only tens of kilometres at most. The area 
between calcrete bodies, which includes intervening sections of the palaeochannel 
valleys hosting the calcretes, is considered to be unsuitable for stygofauna and tro-
glofauna, because of high salinity (Humphreys et al. 2009), lack of suitable voids 
and spaces or otherwise inhospitable habitat for a variety of reasons. A series of 
papers by Tomislav Karanovic on the copepods of the Yeelirrie calcrete illustrate the 
extreme levels of geographic replacement and local endemism that may occur, with 
some species appearing to have linear ranges of <5 km (Karanovic and Cooper 
2011, 2012; Karanovic et al. 2015).
Another apparent generalisation is that mineralised and weathered iron ore for-
mations provide rich troglofaunal habitat. The occurrence of rich troglofauna com-
munities in iron ore ranges in Australia is analogous to the occurrence of troglofauna 
in iron ore mining areas of Brazil (Silva et al. 2011), although in Brazil the animals 
have mostly been collected from caves, rather than from microcaverns across the 
iron ore deposit (Fig. 2). While iron ore formations are used extensively by troglo-
fauna, the factors affecting the extent to which different types of deposits are used 
are still being studied and, for example, the reasons why banded iron formations in 
the Pilbara support greater numbers of troglofauna species than banded iron forma-
tions in the Yilgarn are not understood. Pilbara communities are more complex in 
structure and, as already mentioned, support groups such as schizomids and cock-
roaches that are absent from the Yilgarn.
S. A. Halse

233
In terms of species ranges, the microcaverns comprising most of the spaces in 
vuggy banded iron and other rock formations are unlikely to provide many path-
ways for long-distance lateral dispersal (Fig. 2). Therefore, the troglobitic species 
found in rock habitats would be expected to have smaller ranges than species inhab-
iting various types of detritals (scree and alluvium/colluvium) where the potential 
for dispersal through the matrix is likely greater. Despite this, based on current 
understanding of the habitats occupied by species, the ranges of troglofauna species 
in the Pilbara are not strongly determined by the type of geology in which the spe-
cies occur (Table 3). Probably the most important factor is whether species are tro-
glophilic and have a surface dispersal phase (rather than the lateral below-ground 
dispersal of troglobites), but intrinsic biological differences among groups may also 
affect ranges.
The finding that stygofaunal syncarids in alluvial aquifers in New South Wales 
display some genetic structuring over distances of 50 m in an apparently homoge-
neous alluvial aquifer (Asmhyr et al. 2013) highlights that lateral movement through 
the substrate by subterranean species is limited in many habitats. Furthermore, it 
may be vertically constrained by the physical structure of the substrate or its chem-
istry (Hose et al. 2017). With the limited information about subterranean habitats 
that is available from the surface (albeit often augmented with data from drill holes), 
it is usually difficult to determine whether species ranges are constrained by subtle 
habitat variation acting as barriers to reduce movement (Guzik et al. 2009; Trontelj 
et al. 2009) or innate life-history characteristics. This latter phenomenon is widely 
recognised in trapdoor spiders (Bond et al. 2001; Cooper et al. 2011) and, given the 
considerable variation in species’ ranges between different taxonomic groups, may 
also be important in subterranean fauna.
Conservation Challenges
There are three issues that make it challenging to put together an appropriate pro-
gram for the conservation of subterranean fauna in the Australian arid zone. These 
issues apply in other regions as well. The first issue is that the small ranges of sub-
terranean fauna species make them particularly vulnerable to even single develop-
ment projects where subterranean habitat is removed. The second issue is the limited 
information about the ecology and distribution of subterranean species across the 
arid zone as a whole. There has been only one regional survey to identify the local 
areas of high species richness (Halse et al. 2014), as well as to identify the extent to 
which different geologies are used by subterranean species. The third issue is per-
haps the biggest challenge. It is the low level of awareness of subterranean fauna 
among policymakers and the public at large. There is no impetus to protect species 
that people know little about and which have poorly documented ecological roles.

Species Ranges in Relation to Project Impacts
Large mining operations may have open mine pits that extend 20 km or more, with 
annual dewatering requirements of up to 150 gigalitres and substantially larger 
areas of drawdown than the mine pits themselves (e.g. EPA 2015). In some cases, 
the pits may be hundreds of metres deep (e.g. EPA 2002). There may also be require-
ments for mine processing water or, where dewatering produces more water than 
can be used, the excess may be reinjected below ground. Irrigation projects in the 
arid zone are another potential user of large amounts of groundwater. All of these 
developments may pose a conservation threat to subterranean species. Given that 
many troglofauna and stygofauna species, respectively, have linear ranges of 1–2 km 
and < 30 km (and sometimes <5 km), such developments have the potential to 
threaten significant numbers of species through direct loss of habitat. There is also 
potential for reduction in stygofauna populations, and perhaps even extinction of 
species under some circumstances, as a result of changes in water chemistry associ-
ated with mining and irrigation. Potential changes include increased salinity, 
reduced carbon and nutrient inputs as a result of mining and increased nutrient loads 
as a result of irrigated agriculture (Hancock et al. 2005; Humphreys 2009; Nevill 
et al. 2010).
Documenting Distributions and Managing Threats
While assessments of the potential impacts of development on subterranean fauna 
usually focus on threats to species, another important conservation value to consider 
is the overall richness and biological uniqueness of the subterranean fauna assem-
blage in a development area. Regional surveys provide a framework of information 
that enables the relative value of assemblages to be assessed, as well as enabling 
prediction of the likely values of an area in advance of survey.
Regional surveys also help provide information on the distributional characteris-
tics of species of different taxonomic groups, sometimes enabling a species’ range 
to be predicted from that of related species. This type of information will be refined 
over time as more ecological and life-history studies of species are undertaken. The 
other important aspect of distributions, particularly from the viewpoint of predicting 
and managing impact, is the vertical occurrence of species. This may largely be 
controlled by the geological preferences of the species or, in the case of stygofauna, 
their salinity tolerance. Current sampling methods provide relatively unreliable 
information about the depths at which animals occur, although use of packers and 
other new techniques would improve the quality of information obtained when sam-
pling (Sorensen et al. 2013).
In many situations, the threat to species is likely to be partial, whereby a consid-
erable amount (but not all) of habitat is lost or the quality of the habitat is affected 
by development. If the biology of the species is well understood, then its likely 
S. A. Halse

235
impacts can be reduced or mitigated through management actions. One scenario 
where better information may allow mining to proceed without threat to species is 
where the vertical distribution of suitable habitat for a subterranean species can be 
shown to extend deeper than the mine pit or the extent of groundwater drawdown. 
However, sometimes the process of mining, groundwater abstraction or reinjection 
will alter conditions in the deeper ‘refuge’, rendering it unsuitable for the species. 
Sound ecological understanding is critical to decision-making in such situations.
Awareness of Subterranean Fauna
Of the government agencies in Australia, the Western Australian Environmental 
Protection Authority has responded most strongly to the threats to subterranean 
fauna, with stygofauna featuring in assessments in the arid zone as early as 1997 
(EPA 1997, 1998) and troglofauna in 2006 (EPA 2006, 2007). This is largely a 
reflection of the richness of subterranean fauna on the Western Shield and the large 
amount of mining that occurs in Western Australia.
A series of guidelines on subterranean fauna assessment has been released in 
Western Australia, with the most recent describing the principles of assessment 
(EPA 2016b). Elsewhere in Australia, the Queensland Government released a sub-
terranean fauna assessment guideline in 2014, while South Australia released a dis-
cussion document in 2015 (Goonan et  al. 2015). Subterranean fauna have been 
identified as an issue requiring assessment in many development projects in New 
South Wales (e.g. Eco Logical 2015), but the framework for assessment is less for-
mal than in Western Australia and Queensland.
Maintaining or increasing agencies’ interest in the conservation of subterranean 
fauna would be assisted by clearer demonstration of the ecological services pro-
vided by these animals. There has been greater effort in this regard for stygofauna 
(e.g. Danielopol et al. 2003; Steube et al. 2009; Griebler and Avramov 2015) than 
for troglofauna, where the focus has been more taxonomic and biogeographic. 
However, troglofauna are likely to provide similar ecological services to those pro-
vided by soil fauna (e.g. Lavelle et al. 2006), albeit at greater depth. Plant roots, 
especially of trees, extend much deeper than the zones occupied by soil fauna and 
probably often rely on subterranean fauna to maintain a suitable environment.
Concluding Remarks
In summary, the arid zone of Western Australia contains very significant stygofau-
nal and troglofaunal biodiversity at the global scale. Largely because the animals 
are mostly tiny, and live underground, they have usually been overlooked in conser-
vation planning, and their scientific importance has frequently been underestimated 
compared with surface plants and animals. While the large, iconic Karijini National 
Subterranean Fauna of the Arid Zone

236
Park in the Pilbara is probably uniquely rich in troglofauna, there is no information 
whatsoever about the species within it.
The historical lack of interest in subterranean fauna is currently being redressed 
to some extent by research funding agencies, with many interesting research results 
emerging. In terms of management, both stygofauna and troglofauna provide taxo-
nomic challenges when determining what comprises a species. Legislation for pro-
tecting fauna uses species as the operational unit, which means taxonomy will 
continue to be an important component of subterranean fauna research. New genetic 
techniques, such as environmental DNA, may assist in documenting the ­distributions 
of rare or ‘difficult to collect’ species, while more intensive studies of individual 
species and how particular microhabitats are used by subterranean fauna will pro-
vide the basis for informed management of subterranean fauna and for mitigation of 
threats to them. It is also important that research and reviews focus on providing 
more information about the environmental services provided by subterranean fauna 
and the sensitivity of these services to the loss of different types of species.

Australia’

Introduction
Although fire is a widespread phenomenon and major ecosystem disturbance at the 
global scale, fire is a relatively rare event in much of the arid lands as rainfall and 
productivity are generally too low to support the dense vegetation and continuous 
fuel needed to sustain fires (Pausas and Bradstock 2007; Pausas and Ribeiro 2013). 
There are exceptions to this, such as landscapes dominated by xerophytic perennial 
grasses, where infrequent periods with above-average rainfall can result in excep-
tional grass and herb growth or where invasive species, particularly alien grasses, 
enhance fuel loads (Greenville et al. 2009; Keeley et al. 2012; Balch et al. 2013). 
Changes in land management (e.g. reduction in grazing, land abandonment), cli-
mate change and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations have also been linked 
to increased fire activity in arid zones across the globe (Bond and Midgley 2012; 
Pausas and Fernández-Muñoz 2012; Bachelet et al. 2016).
When they occur, arid-zone fires are predominantly grass fires (Murphy et al. 
2013). However, low-lying flow-on areas may support sufficient shrubby vegetation 
and fuel to sustain fire. At the limits of the arid zone, where rainfall and productivity 
are generally higher (e.g. semiarid transition zones), shrub-dominated vegetation 
can be dense enough to enable crown fires, which are typically intense and ‘stand 
replacing’ (Keeley et al. 2012; Dalgleish et al. 2015). In southern Australia, fire

frequency and extent increase in a southerly direction across the arid to Mediterranean 
climate transition in line with increasing rainfall, productivity and vegetation cover 
(Pausas and Bradstock 2007).
In arid Australia, which comprises around 70% of the entire continent, fire is 
generally a more prevalent and important feature than in drylands of other parts of 
the globe (Morton et al. 2011). One explanation for this is that rainfall, although 
variable, is relatively high, averaging >180 mm per annum (Stafford Smith 2008; 
van Etten 2009). Further, much of arid Australia supports extensive meadows of the 
highly flammable perennial spinifex grass (Triodia spp.), a life form that is unique 
to Australia. Spinifex is well adapted to arid environments and to fire. As a fuel, it 
behaves more like a shrub as aboveground biomass accumulates slowly over time 
(Rice and Westoby 1999; Armstrong and Legge 2011; Nano et al. 2012b).
In this chapter we review fire regimes and some impacts of fire on the flora and 
fauna of arid Australia. The review is structured around the major vegetation types 
in arid Western Australia, described in Table 1 and mapped in Fig. 1 as ‘Spinifex’, 
‘mulga’, ‘Acacia scrub’, ‘eucalypt woodlands’, ‘mallee’ and ‘chenopod shrubland’. 
These types were derived by amalgamating vegetation units mapped at the 1:3 M 
scale (Beard et al. 2013) into major types based on general similarities in their struc-
ture, fuel characteristics and fire regimes. These vegetation types are broadly con-
sistent with the Murphy et al. (2013) classification of vegetation by fire regimes 
based on the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) mapping but with two 
important distinctions for Western Australia: (1) we recognise arid/semiarid euca-
lypt woodlands as being different from temperate woodlands (as per Gosper et al. 
2016); and (2) Acacia shrublands are split into mulga woodlands/shrublands (domi-
nated by Acacia aneura s.l.) and other Acacia shrublands/woodlands (non-mulga), 
which we refer to as ‘Acacia scrub’. The broad vegetation types found in the Western 
Australian arid zone also occur in other arid Australian regions, so we cite relevant 
literature from these areas. We also update recent reviews of arid Australian fire 
ecology (e.g. Nano et al. 2012b; Allan and Southgate 2002) and identify critical 
knowledge gaps and future research priorities.
Determining Fire History in Remote Arid Regions
A firm knowledge of fire history is important for interpreting ecological, economic, 
cultural and social influences of landscape fires and for determining appropriate fire 
management. The remoteness and vastness of Australia’s arid zone make satellite 
products a cost-effective means for near real-time detection of active fires (hotspots), 
for mapping fire footprints (scars) and for reconstructing fire histories (Burrows and 
Christensen 1990; Allan and Southgate 2002; Turner et al. 2008; Avitabile et al. 2013). 
Remote-sensing technology is developing rapidly, and today the most commonly used 
satellites for detecting and mapping fires are Terra and Aqua (carrying the MODIS 
instrument), Landsat and Himawari. Each of these satellites has strengths and weak-
nesses in terms of resolution, bands, frequency of overpass, data accessibility and

cost. Unlike the tropical savannas, fire scars in the arid zone are generally detectable 
for several years or more before the vegetation regenerates. With the exception of 
some military- and special-purpose weather satellites, satellite imagery only became 
available from 1972 following the launch of Landsat 1. Prior to that, black and white 
aerial photography flown at irregular intervals is available for much of arid Australia 
since the 1940s. As well as being of variable resolution and quality, it is costly to 
acquire but of considerable historical value. Burrows and Christensen (1990) used 
early (1953) black and white aerial photography to describe and quantify fire patterns 
in a part of the Western Desert that was occupied by Aboriginal people living a tradi-
tional lifestyle at the time of the photography (Plate 1).
Important changes in ecosystem structure, function and composition can develop 
in the absence of fire over scales of many decades to centuries, especially so for 
those vegetation types which uncommonly experience fire (Gosper et al. 2013a, b; 
Knuckey et al. 2016). Therefore, much recent research has focussed on developing 
methodologies to establish the age of long-unburnt vegetation. Clarke et al. (2010) 
and Gosper et al. (2013c) used allometric relationships between stem diameter and 
plant age of dominant species (mallee and gimlet, respectively) to infer fire age of 
sites, which revealed some as being older than 200 years. More recently, Callister 
et  al. (2016) successfully constructed models between vegetation structure and 
remotely sensed reflectance data to estimate time since fire in mallee vegetation of 
up to 100 years. Trees of the generally fire-sensitive conifer genus Callitris grow 
widely in arid Australia and can be aged by stem ring counts (e.g. O’Donnell et al. 
2010). However this technique has some pitfalls, because Callitris can regenerate 
between fires and survive low-intensity fires, growth rings are not always annual 
and it can be difficult to obtain complete stem cores in very old trees (Cohn et al. 
2011; Pearson et al. 2011; Prior et al. 2011). Carbon dating of charcoal in soil and 
under bark is a promising technique requiring further development. In many remote 
Aboriginal communities, a rich oral history exists of the traditional use of fire which 
gives great insight to prehistorical fire regimes in parts of the arid zone (e.g. Burrows 
et al. 2009; Rangeland NRM 2013).

Fuel Characteristics and Fire Regimes of Arid Australian 
Ecosystems
Spinifex Grasslands
Spinifex grasslands are characterised by the dominance of perennial hummock 
grasses, primarily of the genus Triodia. They cover about 2.1 million km2 (~27%) 
of the continent including pastoral, Aboriginal and conservation lands as well as 
large tracts of unallocated crown land (Allan and Southgate 2002). Spinifex grass-
lands occur on a diversity of landforms including sandplains, dune fields, gibber 
plains and rocky hills in the semiarid and arid regions of the remote and sparsely 
populated parts of Australia. Annual average rainfall ranges from about 225 mm to 
350 mm, the seasonality of which varies from predominantly summer rainfall in the 
north to winter rainfall in the south. This strongly affects the seasonality of fire, with 
most fires in the northern arid zone being confined to August to November (when 
this area is typically dry) compared with the southern arid zone where fires mostly 
occur in spring and summer (Turner et al. 2008; Nano et al. 2012b). Rainfall is 
highly variable and long periods of hot, dry weather are common (van Etten 2009). 
Mature spinifex grasslands are generally structurally simple, with a discontinuous 
ground cover dominated by Triodia hummocks and a diversity of scattered low 
shrubs and trees, including Eucalyptus, Allocasuarina, Acacia, Senna, Callitris, 
Hakea and Grevillea (Beard et al. 2013).
The combination of accumulation of flammable vegetation, the physical struc-
ture of the hummocks and the often extreme fire weather conditions make spinifex 
grasslands highly flammable (Griffin and Allan 1984; Burrows and Christensen 
1990; Gill et al. 1995; Allan and Southgate 2002). Historically, lightning and delib-
erate burning by Aboriginal people were the main causes of fire. Today, most fires 
are started by lightning, although human-caused ignitions are significant near settle-
ments, along vehicle travel routes and on pastoral leases where burning is some-
times carried out to manage browse (Edwards et al. 2008). While many Triodia 
species are fire sensitive (readily killed by fire, regenerate from seed; see section 
‘Response of dominant plant species’), spinifex  grassland communities are fire 
dependent; fires at appropriate temporal and spatial scales are essential for their 
persistence and health (Suijendorp 1981; Latz 1995; Allan and Southgate 2002).
Fuel Loads, Distribution and Dynamics
Spinifex is highly flammable due to its physical structure and, in the case of resin-
ous species, its chemical composition. Burrows et al. (1991) have described it as an 
‘almost perfect’ bushfire fuel. Being desiccation-tolerant, the perennial spini-
fex plant has a remarkable ability to survive under conditions of extreme moisture 
stress. Rather than having a substantial root system that accesses soil moisture at 
depth (as is the case with many woody plants in these environments), when under

moisture stress, spinifex gradually slows down growth and gas exchange, maintains 
cell structure and integrity (i.e. does not wilt) and ‘suspends’ metabolism (Grigg 
et al. 2008). Under water stress the plant is straw-coloured and has the ‘cured’ 
appearance of an annual grass. Within a short time after sufficient rain, the plant 
takes up soil moisture and ‘greens up’. Depending on its age and the proportion of 
dead material in the clump, the moisture content of clumps can range from about 
14% to 75% of oven dry weight (Burrows et al. 2016).
After regeneration following fire and rain, spinifex plants develop through a vari-
ety of structural or architectural forms, starting as a small dome-shaped clump and, 
with age, taking on a ‘donut-’ or crescent-shaped structure as stolons grow more or 
less radially, and older, central parts of the plant die. Dead spinifex can persist 
behind the ‘active growing front’ of the plant for several years. Not only does the 
structure of the plant change with age but so does the proportion of dead material in 
the hummock. Dead spinifex can make a significant contribution to the plant’s fuel 
properties mainly because it remains very dry for long periods on account of the 
very low relative humidity normally experienced in arid environments. Examples of 
how biomass and structure change with time since fire in five Western Australian 
arid bioregions are shown in Fig. 2. The rate of postfire change in biomass and 
structure, hence the minimum fire return interval, as based on fuel characteristics, 
varies depending on cumulative rainfall since the last fire (Allan and Southgate 
2002) and local soil and landform conditions.
Although spinifex hummocks are the major component of the fuel load, the flush 
of annuals (grasses and forbs), which commonly develop between hummocks fol-
lowing wet times, can increase overall fuel loads and fuel continuity and thereby 
contribute to fire spread (Allan and Southgate 2002; Myers et al. 2005; Burrows 
et al. 2009). Consequently, annual variation in the areal extent of fires in spinifex-­
dominated landscapes is strongly and positivity correlated with antecedent rainfall 
in the 2 years prior to fire (Greenville et al. 2009). It is now widely recognised that 
probability of fire in spinifex is not only dependent on time since fire, with short fire 
intervals possible during periods of sustained high rainfall (Wright and Clarke 
2007a; Turner et al. 2008). We note few attempts to formally model the combined 
effects of antecedent rainfall and time since fire in spinifex, although Avitabile 
(2014) showed the cover of T. scariosa growing under mallee in south-east Australia 
increased with time since fire during periods of below-average rainfall but responded 
more to amount of recent rainfall during periods of above-average rainfall.
Fires in spinifex grasslands are surface fires with fire intensity strongly influenced 
by fuel load and fire rate of spread (ROS). Fuel loads at maturity are variable but 
generally range from 10 t ha−1 in inland arid areas to over 20 t ha−1 in higher-­rainfall 
monsoonal areas in northern Australia (Burrows et al. 1991; Russell-Smith et al. 
1998). Burrows et al. (2009) studied spinifex fuel dynamics across several sites in the 
Western Deserts (Great Sandy, Little Sandy and Gibson Deserts) using a space-for-
time approach and showed that fuel loads increased with time since fire, plateauing at 
about 10–12 t ha−1 some 18–20 years after fire (Fig. 2). Flammability of hummocks 
increases in line with the moisture content of their living leaves (which varies widely 
in response to rain), proportion of dead material in the hummock (which increases 
with age) and amount of resinous oils (which varies with species) (Lazarides 1997).

Fire Behaviour
Although a structurally simple fuel, modelling the behaviour of fire in spinifex 
grasslands is challenging for a number of reasons. Spinifex is a perennial plant that 
is able to survive under a wide range of soil and plant moisture content conditions, 
unlike annual grasses that ‘cure’ once soils dry below wilting point. The spinifex

252
grassland fuel array is discontinuous or patchy, giving rise to multiple thresholds to 
fire spread, and the structure and composition, especially the proportion of dead 
material, varies with time since last fire and cumulative rainfall. Notwithstanding 
these challenges, two fire behaviour models have been developed from empirical 
studies, the earliest of which was published by Griffin and Allan (1984). Later, 
Burrows et al. (1991, 2009, 2016) published updated versions of a two-step model 
that firstly determines the probability that thresholds for spread have been met or 
exceeded, and secondly, if they have, rate of spread and flame height can then be 
modelled using a linear relationship linking key fuel and weather variables. Key 
variables are wind speed, hummock moisture content, fuel cover and fuel load. 
Once the cover of  spinifex exceeds about 30% and its biomass exceeds about 
3–4 t ha−1, it has the potential to sustain fire spread. For continuous fuels such as 
forest litter fuels, moisture content of extinction is the only threshold to fire spread 
once a cover of leaf litter has developed. Because of its discontinuity, or patchiness, 
mature spinifex fuels have at least three fire spread thresholds: (1) cover, spinifex 
fires rarely spread when the cover falls below about 30%; (2) fuel moisture content, 
when fully ‘green’, clumps may ignite if there is sufficient dead material present, 
and fire spread will be difficult to sustain when clump moisture content exceeds 
about 40% (Burrows et al. 2016); and (3) wind speed, which is probably the most 
important threshold (Williams et al. 2015). The wind speed threshold varies accord-
ing to cover, moisture content and fuel load but is usually in the vicinity of 
7–10 km h−1 (@ 2 m above ground) once moisture content and cover thresholds 
have been exceeded (Burrows et al. 2016). Fire is capable of spreading between 
0.25 and 10 km h−1 generating intensities up to 30,000 kW m−1. Flame height rarely 
exceeds 6 m, and spotting is not usually associated with spinifex fires, although 
short-distance spotting (up to 100 m) may occur in the presence of a eucalypt over-
storey. Guides to predicting spinifex fire rate spread and flame height are provided 
by Burrows et al. (2016).
Fire Intervals
The minimum possible fire return interval based on fuel characteristics depends 
on cumulative rainfall and local soil and landform conditions that drive vegeta-
tion productivity but is usually in the range 5–10 years and generally shorter in 
northern latitudes, reflecting higher rainfall and conducive growing conditions in 
these regions (Allan and Southgate 2002; Greenville et al. 2009). However, fire 
intervals can be as short as 2–3 years when consecutive seasons of above-average 
rainfall promote rapid build-up of annual herbs and grasses (Wright and Clarke 
2007a). Repeated fires at such short intervals can lead to structural and composi-
tional changes to the vegetation, because some species are likely to be extirpated 
before replenishing their seed banks (refer to section ‘Flora’ below). Topographic 
and vegetation features can isolate and protect some patches of spinifex from 
large landscape fires, with reports of some patches being many decades old 
(Greenville et al. 2009).

Altered Fire Regimes
Following the departure of traditional Aboriginal burning practices, the fire regime 
throughout much of the spinifex grasslands has changed from one of predominantly 
small, patchy cool-season fires to large, intense hot-season fires (Latz and Griffin 
1978; Burrows and Christensen 1990; Latz 1995; Allan and Southgate 2002). For 
example, over the period 2000–2002, ~500,000 km2 of spinifex grassland was burnt 
by wildfire (Wright and Clarke 2007a), and hot summer wildfires commonly exceed 
200,000 ha (Haydon et al. 2000; Allan and Southgate 2002; Burrows et al. 2009). 
This ‘boom and bust’ fire regime is now largely determined by rainfall (Fig. 4), 
which drives the rate of fuel accumulation (Griffin et al. 1983; Allan and Southgate 
2002), with lightning as the dominant ignition source. This changed fire regime has 
been implicated in the decline of mammals and some bird species, as well as the 
contraction of fire-sensitive plants such as cypress pine (Callitris spp.) and mulga 
(Start 1986; Bowman and Latz 1993; van Leeuwen et al. 1995; Ward et al. 2014; see 
section ‘Fire impacts and responses’ below).
Mulga Woodlands
The structure of mulga vegetation typically comprises an open to moderately dense 
overstorey of low (2–10 m) trees of Acacia aneura or its close relatives (Maslin and 
Reid 2012), occasionally mixed with other Acacia species, and an understorey of 
sparse shrubs and herbaceous ground layer (Groves 1994). This ground layer mostly 
comprises grasses (perennial and annual) and forbs, which increase substantially in 
biomass and cover following big rains. This enhanced herbaceous layer, when dry, 
provides sufficient fuel to sustain ground fires. Fire frequency is therefore low to 
moderate, occurring every 20 to 100+ years (Murphy et al. 2013; Friedel et al. 
2014), although Ward et al. (2014) reported return intervals as low as 3–10 years in 
a mulga woodland at Lorna Glen in the Gascoyne bioregion, a situation promoted 
by an extended period of above-average rainfall. There exist large expanses of 
mulga that have no record of fire, based on remote sensing and field observations, 
and are presumably very long unburnt (Hodgkinson 2002; Williams 2002; Turner 
et al. 2008; Ladbrook 2015).
Fires in mulga communities are an integral component of the pulse-and-reserve 
response to major rain events typical of arid lands (Ludwig et al. 1996). Above-­
average rainfall, especially if spread across the seasons, results in rapid biomass 
accumulation, which leads to enhanced consumption (including fire), which, in 
turn, results in efficient resource feedback in terms of nutrient and carbohydrate 
replenishment and storage (which becomes important for driving the next pulse). 
However, the rainfall thresholds in terms of the amount and timing of rain required 
to produce sufficient fuel to enable fires in mulga remain unclear; such information 
would be vitally important to land managers, because it would enable the prediction 
of fire risk based on antecedent rainfall. Spatial redistribution of rainfall is also 
On the Ecology of Australia’s Arid Zone: ‘Fire Regimes and Ecology of Arid Australia’

254
important and will mean such thresholds are unlikely simply a product of the amount 
of rain received. Mulga tend to grow in ‘run-on’ areas, which receive water from 
upslope and where flooding and sheet flow are common following heavy rainfall 
events (Ludwig et al. 1996). Sites receiving abundant surface runoff can be very 
productive and may at times produce large amounts of grassy fuels. Also grove-­
intergrove spatial arrangements, common to mulga on extensive plains, can result in 
highly patchy distributions of fuel following rain (Nano et al. 2012b). These pat-
terns likely strongly influence fire behaviour (also likely to be very patchy; Nano 
et al. 2012b), with fires needing to move between patches of high fuel loads for 
them to be sustained over large areas, something typically only possible after 
exceedingly large rains.
Mulga on pastoral leases with a long history of grazing by domestic stock can 
survive for long periods, because grazing reduces the fuel load and hence the fire 
potential (Hodgkinson 2002; Edwards et al. 2008). Many areas have been so over-
grazed that their perennial grass component has been lost or severely diminished 
(Burnside et al. 1995; Brandis 2008). Increased tree and shrub cover (especially of 
non-palatable species) following high grazing pressure may also suppress ground 
fuels. Beyond the pastoral areas, grazing and browsing by feral and native herbi-
vores may influence the fire regime, especially where their numbers are artificially 
inflated by provision of permanent water points. Interactions between grazing and 
fire are discussed further below (section ‘Fire-herbivore interactions’).
Mulga is readily killed by fire and relies on a soil-stored seed bank for regenera-
tion. The combination of fire and follow-up rain usually results in dense mulga 
regeneration, which can take as long as 15–20 years to reach maturity and up to 
26 years to replenish seed banks (Ward et al. 2014). Fire-sensitive mulga can co-­
occur with flammable spinifex, provided fires in the surrounding landscape are of 
low intensity and occur at the cool time of the year. This is because the fuel load of 
spinifex beneath mulga groves is generally lower than that in the surrounding non-­
mulga landscape, so fire spread in the groves is less likely under cool conditions. 
Aboriginal people recognised this and would often protect valuable mulga groves 
by burning around them in the cool season (Burrows 2014). Where this is not prac-
ticed, regular large hot summer wildfires are extirpating mulga groves (Start 1986; 
Latz 1995; Ward et al. 2014).
Acacia Scrub
These are shrublands (occasionally woodlands) dominated by Acacia species other 
than mulga (although A. aneura can sometimes be a minor component in drier 
regions; Beard et al. 2013). They are typically found on sandplains and generally 
poorer soils compared with mulga and are widespread on the western side of the 
Western Australian arid zone (e.g. Carnarvon bioregion) and in the semiarid transi-
tion zone (e.g. Yalgoo and Coolgardie bioregions; Fig. 1). They are characterised by 
a mix of Acacia species (Table 1) with other shrub genera (Allocasuarina, Melaleuca, 
E. J. B. Etten and N. D. Burrows

255
Hakea, Callitris and Grevillea) also common (Knuckey et al. 2016). Structurally, 
they vary along a rainfall/productivity gradient from very dense shrublands around 
2–4 m high capable of carrying a crown fire at maturity to moderately dense shrub-
lands where crown fires are possible given strong winds, to more open shrubland, 
which only carries ground fire if sufficient fuel builds up following big rains (Fig. 3; 
Ladbrook 2015).
In the dense Acacia scrub of the Yalgoo and Coolgardie bioregions (described as 
‘thicket’ by Beard et  al. 2013), fuel primarily consists of live leaves and fine 
branches/twigs which continually, but slowly, accumulate over many decades as 
shrubs expand laterally and vertically (Dalgleish et al. 2015). Dead leaves and other 
plant material on the ground and in the canopy also slowly build up after fire to 
contribute about 40% of the fuel load after 30–50 years and increase the flammabil-
ity of vegetation at these ages (Dalgleish et al. 2015; Kelso et al. 2015). Total fuel 
load stabilises around 20–25 t ha−1 after 60 years, with some evidence that senes-
cence of shrubs may contribute to more patchy fuel arrays after this time (Parsons 
and Gosper 2011; Dalgleish et al. 2015).
The fire regime in dense Acacia scrub is closely linked to this fuel dynamic with 
burnt areas not recovering sufficiently to carry a subsequent fire for at least 
20–30 years, which is consistent with the reported interval between fires of around 
30–40 years for Acacia sandplain scrub in the Yalgoo bioregion (Parsons and Gosper 
Fig. 3  Shrub/tree density influence on fire behaviour in arid shrubland vegetation. Distances

2011; Doherty et al. 2017). Overall, this suggests the overriding importance of time 
since fire in shaping the fire regime, although the role of pre-fire rainfall in promot-
ing fire (either via extra fuel following deluges or lower fuel moisture following 
drought), as well as the importance of fire weather, needs further exploration. Fires 
tend to be intense crown fires, which are stand replacing (Dalgleish et al. 2015; 
Kelso et al. 2015) and can be large and dangerous. For example, the Boorabbin fire, 
in which three people lost their lives, burnt some 400 km2 of mostly sandplain scrub 
in the 2007–2008 summer (Kelso et  al. 2015); fires south of Mt. Gibson burnt 
800 km2 of mostly dense scrub in 2001–2002 (E. van Etten, unpubl.). Extreme fire 
weather conditions (very hot, dry and windy) prevailed during the Boorabbin fire 
(BoM 2008).
Eucalypt Woodland
Eucalypt woodlands occur along major streams and drainage lines throughout the 
arid zone of Australia but also form extensive stands in the Coolgardie and Yalgoo 
bioregions of Western Australia where species such as Salmon gum (E. salmono-
phloia), gimlet (E. salubris) and York gum (E. loxophleba) dominate on heavier 
soils in broad valley systems (Beard et al. 2013). These woodlands here generally 
have low fuel and exist in clearly delineated landscape mosaics with more flamma-
ble vegetation (e.g. Acacia scrub and mallee). Consequently, fires in these eucalypt 
woodlands are mainly limited to their margins where fires burn in from surrounding 
more flammable vegetation (Kelso et al. 2015; O’Donnell et al. 2011a; Prober et al. 
2012; Gosper et al. 2016).
In contrast to eucalypt woodlands of temperate Australia where tussock grasses 
are the main fuel component (Lunt et al. 2012; Murphy et al. 2013), there are few 
grasses in these semiarid eucalypt woodlands, and fuel comprises mostly a thin, 
patchy cover of leaf litter and fine woody plant debris (Gosper et al. 2016). Such 
ground litter fuel, however, accumulates extremely slowly (O’Donnell et al. 2014) 
and for E. salubris woodland has been reported to peak and then decline after sev-
eral decades (Gosper et al. 2013a). Ground fuels rarely reach a level and continuity 
where fires will readily spread, except perhaps when strong winds move flames 
across patches of ground fuels (O’Donnell et al. 2011a, 2014; Gosper et al. 2016). 
Consequently, fire is rare and of low intensity, with fire return intervals estimated at 
300+ years and largely decoupled from temporal accumulation of fuel (O’Donnell 
et al. 2011a; Gosper et al. 2013c). The low and patchy ground cover in these semi-
arid woodlands has been hypothesised to be due to the intense competition exerted 
by the large eucalypt trees (which have extensive lateral roots) for moisture and 
nutrient resources (Yates et al. 2000) and is unlikely to reflect high grazing pressure 
as many areas are outside of pastoral leases (Prober and Wiehl 2011).
O’Donnell et al. (2011b) demonstrated the importance of a sequence of wet and 
dry years for promoting large fires in a semiarid landscape of eucalypt woodland, 
shrubland and mallee in the Coolgardie bioregion. It is therefore possible that 
E. J. B. Etten and N. D. Burrows

grasses and other herbs will proliferate after flooding rains, which, when dry, would 
increase continuity of fuels and promote fire spread in these woodlands, which 
rarely burn otherwise, but this remains largely conjectural (O’Donnell et al. 2011b; 
Prober et al. 2012). Understanding the relative roles of rain, time and fire weather in 
enabling occasional fires in eucalypt woodlands requires study over long time 
frames to capture a representative amount of climatic variability.
Mallee
Mallee shrublands are characterised by an open overstorey of mallee eucalypts 
(tall, multi-stemmed shrubs resprouting from a large underground lignotuber, 
typically 10–40% cover) with either an open shrubby or grassy understorey (hum-
mock or tussock grasses). On some soil types throughout the arid zone, a spinifex 
understorey can develop beneath the mallees sufficient to sustain fire at relatively 
frequent intervals (15–20 years). More commonly though, it is ground litter, com-
prising mostly eucalypt leaves and other plant debris, built up over many years 
(and sometimes decades) which is all important to sustain fires, although extra 
plant growth (both annual and perennial) following rainy periods will increase the 
likelihood of fire (Bradstock and Cohn 2002). Although most mallee fires are 
ground fires burning through the litter layer, fires do typically flare up and burn 
into the crowns of mallee eucalypts, aided by the accumulation of litter around 
the base of trees and presence of loose bark and dead material in mallee crowns 
(Bradstock and Gill 1993; Cruz et al. 2013). However, it is only where there are 
dense patches of mallee and/or shrubs (more common in southern semiarid parts 
of its distribution) that sustained crown fires tend to occur. Ground litter accumu-
lates slowly after fire, but this accumulation plateaus after 20–30 years (Haslem 
et al. 2011) at around 5–10 t ha−1 (Bradstock and Cohn 2002). Fire return inter-
vals are generally 20–100 years (Murphy et al. 2013), but for mallee of south-
western Australia, these are typically 55–80+ years (O’Donnell et  al. 2011a; 
Gosper et al. 2016).
In the absence of a spinifex-dominated understorey, fire behaviour in mallee is 
relatively complex and unpredictable due to the highly patchy nature of the multiple 
strata of fuel (mallee, shrubs, grasses and ground litter). Due to differences in these 
characteristics across its distribution, fire behaviour models need to be developed 
for different types of mallee vegetation. Cruz et al. (2013) successfully modelled 
fire behaviour in mallee with understorey of shrubs (which they called ‘mallee-­
heath’) and found that litter moisture content and wind are the most important vari-
ables influencing fire spread, with fuel load playing a minor role. Specifically, litter 
moisture needs to be below 7–8% for fire to be sustained in mature mallee stands 
(McCaw 1995; Cruz et al. 2013).
Avitabile et al. (2013) mapped fires over a large area of semiarid south-eastern 
Australia and found that ~40% of the mallee vegetation in this area had burnt over 
a 35-year period, mostly by a few very large fires. Although there was a general

258
link between prior rainfall and these large fires, it could not account for all of them, 
suggesting time since fire also plays a role. Similarly, O’Donnell et al. (2011b) 
reported a weak link between the sequence of wet and dry years on fire probability 
in a semiarid region with mallee in south-west Australia but also demonstrated that 
fire intervals in mallee vegetation of this region moderately depend on fuel age 
(O’Donnell et al. 2011a). Future research should focus on the interactive effects of 
time since fire and rainfall variability in promoting fires in mallee vegetation.
Chenopod Shrublands
Fire is rare or absent in chenopod shrublands (Groves 1994; Murphy et al. 2013; 
Friedel et al. 2014). This is not surprising given the low flammability with most of 
the dominant species being succulent or semi-succulent (being adaptations to saline 
soils). Fires in chenopod shrublands have been reported and are damaging, but most 
seem to be at their boundaries where fires have burnt in from neighbouring fire-­
prone vegetation, especially following rain events when fuel levels may be atypi-
cally high and continuous (e.g. Ladbrook 2015). As fires are not commonplace in 
chenopod vegetation, very little research has been conducted but is required to 
understand the impacts of fire on this ecosystem.
Invasion by flammable exotic and native grasses and forbs has altered composi-
tion and structure of chenopod vegetation in some areas such as the Nullarbor Plain, 
resulting in very large and damaging summer bushfires, especially following above-­
average rainfall. As disturbances such as fire and grazing can promote the invasion 
of grasses, it may be possible that areas of chenopod shrubland are caught in a fire – 
grass cycle (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992) – whereby loss of shrubs by fire results 
in colonisation by more annual grasses which in turn increases the susceptibility of 
these areas to further burning and so on. This appears to be a common situation 
across much of the Nullarbor where grazing by rabbits initiated the loss of shrub 
cover and promoted grass invasion and then large fires (Burnside et al. 1995). Burnt 
chenopod shrubland can experience major changes in composition and structure. 
For example, in the Western Australian Goldfields, vegetation dominated by cheno-
pods such as Maireana and Atriplex spp. changes to a more open vegetation domi-
nated by fire-tolerant species such as Senna spp. and Acacia hemiteles following fire 
(Burnside et al. 1995).
Landscape-Scale Fire Patterns
The extent and scale of landform, soil and vegetation heterogeneity in the arid zone 
is variable within and between bioregions. Today, very large dry-season fires are 
common and invariably involve a range of landforms and associated vegetation

types (Haydon et al. 2000; Kelso et al. 2015). Embedded within the more flamma-
ble matrices of spinifex grasslands or dense Acacia scrub are landforms such as 
rock outcrops, playa lakes, gorges, breakaways and floodplain margins that often 
support sparse vegetation that rarely, or never, burns. These habitats are often refu-
gia for fire-sensitive and fire-independent taxa such as Ficus spp., Brachychiton 
spp., vine thickets and some Callitris spp. (Bowman and Latz 1993). These fire-
sensitive plant communities are often of conservation significance and, presently, 
are threatened by large, intense fires entering from adjoining vegetation types 
(Allan and Southgate 2002; Nano et al. 2012b). Further, if fire is adequately man-
aged in the broader, more flammable landscape matrix, then these low-fuel areas 
can act as natural firebreaks, which help restrict fire size and protect refugia and 
long-unburnt stands of vegetation (O’Donnell et al. 2011a; Knuckey et al. 2016). 
Historically, this would have been achieved via frequent cool-season burning by 
Aboriginal people which resulted in a fine-scale mosaic of burnt patches that would 
have prevented or mitigated the development of large hot-season fires (Burrows and 
Christensen 1990; Bowman 1998). Rainfall drives vegetation growth, which, in 
turn, drives fire, so in the arid zone, large bushfires invariably follow seasons of 
above-average rainfall. At regional scales, large fires in arid Australia tend to be 
confined to wet years, irrespective of fuel dynamics of inherent vegetation (Turner 
et al. 2008; Fig. 4).

Invasive Species and Fire
Invasive plant species can drastically change species composition, habitat structure 
and ecosystem processes, including alteration of fire regimes. Where invasive spe-
cies are promoted by fire and also increase fuel loads and/or flammability, a fire-­
weed cycle can be established, whereby fires lead to greater weed cover, which, in 
turn, promotes more fire, resulting in unnaturally high fire frequencies and loss of 
biodiversity (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). This is a worldwide phenomenon 
affecting many different types of ecosystems and primarily involves invasive C4 
grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992; Brooks et al. 2004). In many arid regions 
across the globe, exotic grass invasion has dramatically increased fuel levels and fire 
incidence, intensity and spread (Balch et al. 2013).
In semiarid and arid regions of Australia, the main invasive grass of environmen-
tal concern is buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.; syn. Pennisetum ciliare), although 
it is valued as fodder by pastoralists (Marshall et al. 2012). Invasion of buffel grass 
in the absence of fire can cause profound changes to vegetation communities (e.g. 
Olsson et al. 2012). However, it often develops sufficient cover and biomass to carry 
fire relatively frequently, altering the natural fire regime to the detriment of the 
native biota (Miller et al. 2010; Clarke et al. 2005). Because it is a perennial species 
capable of surviving droughts, fire incidences become decoupled from the natural 
fluctuations in ground fuels due to rainfall variability (Clarke et al. 2005).
Fires in vegetation dominated by buffel grass are of enhanced intensity 
(McDonald and McPherson 2011) and severely damage overstorey trees and woody 
shrubs, as well as reducing the regenerative capacity of plants from seed and aerial 
buds (Miller et al. 2010; Schlesinger et al. 2013). This, combined with the competi-
tive abilities of buffel grass, results in lowered native plant diversity (Clarke et al. 
2005; Schlesinger et al. 2013). Animals, such as certain reptiles (which use bare 
ground for basking; Eyre et  al. 2009) and ground-feeding birds (Young and 
Schlesinger 2015), are impacted by buffel grass invasion due to its homogenising 
effect on habitat. Buffel grass invasion strongly favours more productive arid eco-
systems such as eucalypt woodland on drainage lines, floodplains and outwash 
plains (Friedel et al. 2014), meaning control efforts should be focussed on these 
areas. Weed and fire management in these areas is complicated as pastoralists rely 
heavily on these areas for livestock production, and in many instances they have 
promoted the establishment of buffel grass at the expense of native species.
Fire Impacts and Responses
Flora
Most perennial plant species in the Australian arid zone are able to regenerate fol-
lowing fire by resprouting, either from buds buried beneath stem bark in the case of 
trees (epicormics) or from belowground organs (Nano and Clarke 2011; Nano et al. 
E. J. B. Etten and N. D. Burrows

261
2012b; Clarke et al. 2015; Table 2). Resprouting species are more commonly found 
in arid environments with higher fire frequency (such as spinifex grasslands) and in 
more productive parts of the landscape, probably because short fire intervals and 
rapid recovery of burnt sites by resprouters disfavour plants regenerating by seed 
(Nano and Clarke 2011). About two-thirds of resprouting woody species studied 
across arid Australia are ‘obligate resprouters’ (depend on resprouting for postfire 
recovery), with the remainder being ‘facultative resprouters’ (i.e. they resprout but 
will also regenerate well from seed). Mallee and eucalypt woodlands are exceptions, 
with the majority of species in these vegetation types being facultative resprouters 
(Table 2), possibly reflecting their proximity to and association with the flora and 
fire regimes of temperate/Mediterranean climatic regions of southern Australia.
Plants that regenerate en masse after fire from seed (‘seeders’) generally account 
for around 40–60% of species (Table 2). However the proportion that are ‘obligate 
seeders’ (rely solely on seed for regeneration and don’t resprout) is generally low 
but varies widely among vegetation types, being greatest in mallee but relatively 
uncommon in spinifex (Table 2; Nano and Clarke 2011). Obligate seeders with long 
juvenile periods are particularly vulnerable to short intervals between fires as there 
is insufficient time to replenish seed stores. Examples of species that have declined 
due to frequent ‘hot’ fires include Callitris (Bowman and Latz 1993) and mulga 
(Start 1986; Ward et al. 2014). Most arid-zone obligate seeders are however rela-
tively short-lived and include small Acacia shrubs, native peas (e.g. Gastrolobium, 
Indigofera, Mirbelia viminalis) and fire ephemerals (e.g. Keraudrenia and species 
in the Gyrostemonaceae) which grow quickly and flower in years immediately after 
fire (Wright and Clarke 2007a; Nano and Clarke 2011; Knuckey et al. 2016). Many 
herbaceous ephemerals also have enhanced recruitment and presence immediately 
after fire (Suijendorp 1981; Wright and Clarke 2007a). These obligate seeders tend 
to build up a seed bank over time (mainly in soil), with seed germination often 
stimulated by the heat and/or smoke of fire (Erickson et al. 2016a, b).
Although synchronous postfire seedling recruitment is observed in many arid-­
zone species, some longer-lived woody species do not appear to accumulate a viable 
seed bank with time since fire but rather have fluctuating seed availability over time 
in response to rainfall events (Nano et al. 2012a, b). Not only are phenology and 
seed production favoured by high-rainfall periods but so is germination, suggesting 
inter-fire recruitment is a relatively common phenomenon for such species (Preece 
1971; Auld 1995; Knuckey et al. 2016). Altogether these characteristics point to the 
prevalence of species with rain-cued recruitment in the Australian arid zone; species 
demonstrating such traits include relatively tall, long-lived and generally resprout-
ing Acacia, as well as eucalypts (Eucalyptus and Corymbia), Senna and Eremophila 
(Wright and Clarke 2009; Nano et al. 2012b; Knuckey et al. 2016). However, more 
research is required on soil seed bank dynamics, seed longevity and recruitment 
bottlenecks for arid plant species as such information is clearly lacking compared 
with other ecosystems in Australia.
The above discussion points to weaknesses in the resprouter-seeder classification 
scheme (Table 2) when applied to the arid zone. The principal one is that it applies 
a dichotomy when there is clearly a range of fire responses from weak to strong 
On the Ecology of Australia’s Arid Zone: ‘Fire Regimes and Ecology of Arid Australia’

262
among species and much within-species variability (Nano et al. 2012b; Clarke et al. 
2015). For instance, resprouting can be ‘weak’ and variable for some species in that 
it tends to occur only in mature plants facing low-intensity fire and then mostly from 
basal buds (Wright and Clarke 2007b). At the other extreme, it can be consistently 
‘strong’ with such plants being able to withstand repeated hot burns via prolific and 
enduring epicormic resprouting (Hodgkinson 1998). Similarly, seed germination 
may be strongly promoted by fire (via heat or smoke compounds) or be more cued 
to ample soil moisture and/or long storage (Erickson et al. 2016a). Overall, fire 
responses appear to be more weakly developed in arid Australia than in ecosystems 
in southern Australia subject to regular fire (e.g. heathland, dry sclerophyll forest); 
however, there appears to be a mix from strong to weak responses in all communi-
ties (Nano et al. 2012b). Future research needs to focus on patterns in the relative 
strengths of fire responses within and across the major vegetation types.
Some studies conducted at local scales in the Western Australian arid zone have 
revealed divergent fire response spectra from those generally found for that vegeta-
tion type (Table 2). For instance, dense Acacia scrub in the Yalgoo bioregion in 
south-western Australia and mulga woodlands in the eastern Goldfields and Pilbara 
have far greater proportions of obligate seeders and fewer obligate resprouters than 
typical Acacia-dominated vegetation (Table 2). This may reflect the more regular 
and hotter crown fires in the Western Australian examples (at least for the Yalgoo 
shrublands; Dalgleish et al. 2015) and a more predictable Mediterranean climate 
(for all except the Pilbara site). Semiarid eucalypt woodland in south-west Australia 
also has far more obligate seeders and fewer obligate resprouters than other euca-
lypt woodlands (which are mainly from tropical and temperate Australia). The prev-
alence of such strongly developed responses is difficult to explain given the rarity of 
fire in the ‘low-fuel’ Western Australian woodlands, but perhaps this is also a 
response to stand-replacing fires, albeit at a very low frequency (Gosper et al. 2016). 
However, misclassification or inconsistencies in assigning response types, as well 
as the different spatial scales, may also have contributed to differences found. Local 
(Western Australian) examples of mallee and spinifex are consistent with the gen-
eral breakdown by response type for these vegetation types (Table 2).
Response of Dominant Plant Species
Triodia species, which dominate a large proportion of the arid zone, can be either 
seeders or resprouters, and species with divergent responses may co-exist at local 
and landscape scales. In the Pilbara, for instance, two very common species, T. base-
dowii (obligate seeder) and T. wiseana (facultative resprouter), can occupy the same 
site (Casson and Fox 1987). There has been no recent attempt to collate fire responses 
of Triodia species across Australia, or regionally, although the much-­disputed and 
uncertain taxonomy in this genus (Hurry et al. 2012; Anderson et al. 2016) means 
that such a compilation would be difficult at present. Within some widespread spe-
cies, there are differing responses between regions (e.g. Rice and Westoby 1999).

Although it has been hypothesised that there will be more resprouting Triodia 
species in higher-rainfall and more productive parts of the arid zone due to high fire 
frequencies disfavouring seeders (Rice and Westoby 1999), this has also not been 
rigorously tested, and may not be the case as many seeders are known from rela-
tively high-rainfall zones (Armstrong and Legge 2011). While some Triodia spe-
cies reach reproductive maturity within 4 years of fire (Craig 1994), other species 
are relatively slow (up to 9 years to reach reproductive maturity; Westoby et al. 
1988) and therefore vulnerable to short fire intervals. Although most Triodia spe-
cies appear to be obligate seeders, with others tending to be facultative resprouters, 
it remains unclear to what degree fire stimulates germination of Triodia seed and 
how much of the soil seed bank may persist following fire. Cohn and Bradstock 
(2000) and Armstrong and Legge (2011) showed that most of the seed bank germi-
nated after fire, whereas Bogusiak et al. (1990) and Wells (1999) found a minor 
effect of fire on seed germination with many seeds remaining ungerminated in the 
soil after fire, suggesting polymorphic germination responses within some species. 
Several studies have demonstrated a positive effect of smoke-derived compounds 
on Triodia seed germination (Wright and Clarke 2009; Erickson et  al. 2016b), 
although the response can be inconsistent and is thought to depend on seed age/
maturity, viability and timing. In many years, there appears to be little seed set with 
florets being empty or containing mainly unviable seed (Jacobs 1984; Erickson 
et al. 2016a,b).
An inconsistent germination response to fire within Triodia species may be a 
hedge-betting strategy as would be expected in regions of high rainfall variability 
and consequent irregular fire regimes. Wright et al. (2014) report on mast seeding in 
several Triodia species of central Australia in response to high-rainfall periods. 
They hypothesised that as fires also follow very wet periods, that mast seeding in 
Triodia is an evolved fire response to ensure abundant seed availability at the site 
during times of highest fire, and hence recruitment, probability. Seed masting in 
Triodia, and potentially other arid-zone species, and its link to rainfall and fire, is a 
phenomenon that requires further study, as it may unlock the key to understanding 
regeneration in these species and how they persist in a mostly dry, but highly vari-
able, environment.
Mulga has been described as both an obligate seeder (R-/S+; Wright and Clarke 
2007a; Ward et al. 2014) and a fire-sensitive ‘avoider’ which predominantly recruits 
within mature stands (R-/S-; Nano and Clarke 2011; Clarke et al. 2015). There are 
reports of resprouting within this species complex (e.g. Fox 1986; Wright and 
Clarke 2007b) but is likely to be limited to low-intensity fires. The variation in fire 
response across this species complex is not surprising given the range of subspecific 
taxa and their widespread distribution across landscapes and regions (Nano et al. 
2012b). Ward et al. (2014) demonstrated that mulga at Lorna Glen (eastern Gascoyne 
region) is detrimentally affected by short fire intervals as it seems to require at least 
20 years to establish an adequate soil seed bank to enable seedling regeneration. 
Others have observed that where fuel is sparser beneath the groves, mulga is able to 
avoid or survive frequent low-intensity ‘cool’ fires, but not ‘hot’ fires (Latz 1995; 
Burrows 2014). Mulga encapsulates the difficulty in classifying species into a single

fire response type, and more study of the reproductive and regeneration ecology in 
this important species complex is needed.
There is little known about the fire response of chenopods, a dominant compo-
nent of many arid shrublands and woodlands. Most species are fire sensitive, dis-
playing no obvious fire adaptations (Hodgkinson and Griffin 1982), so could be 
classified as fire independent – i.e. fire plays no role in their ecology and could be 
harmful. There are a couple of exceptions, including Maireana aphylla and M. sedi-
folia, which are resprouters that tend to increase in dominance in chenopod shrub-
lands following fire (Wilson et al. 1988; Burnside et al. 1995; Friedel et al. 2014).
Vegetation Changes
Distinct boundaries between mulga woodland/shrubland and spinifex grassland 
communities are found in many arid landscapes. Most studies report no or only very 
minor spatial shifts in such vegetation boundaries in response to fire or from the lack 
of it (Bowman et al. 1994; Nano and Clarke 2010; Fensham et al. 2011; Friedel 
et al. 2014). The general stability of these boundaries is believed to reflect soil/
landform discontinuity with spinifex mostly on uplands and surrounding slopes and 
mulga on alluvium in valleys, drainage lines and other ‘run-on’ areas. Runoff 
received from areas upslope is believed to contribute to thickening of mulga vegeta-
tion at the boundary which may render it more stable through grass suppression 
(van Etten 1987).
Although distinct boundaries are often found in range- and basin-type topogra-
phies (such as the Hamersley Ranges in the Pilbara and MacDonnell Ranges in 
central Australia), Nano and Clarke (2008) point out that more complex spatial 
arrangements of mulga and spinifex communities exist, including mosaics, gradual 
transitions and even mixed communities (i.e. mulga with spinifex understorey). 
Some of these patterns cannot be adequately explained by edaphic differences and 
are structural rather than floristic in nature, so it is likely that fire is somehow 
responsible (Nano and Clarke 2008; Bowman et al. 2008). Complex mosaics and 
mixed communities, where two communities with extrinsically different fire 
regimes and responses co-occur (one fire-prone and resilient, the other fire sensi-
tive), are thought to have been promulgated by past Aboriginal patch-burning prac-
tices, which would have promoted and then protected mulga stands from large fires 
(Bowman 1998). However, with the reduction or absence of such burning in many 
parts of the arid zone, conversion of mulga communities into spinifex grassland 
through repeated fires has been reported (Start 1986; Latz 1995; Allan and Southgate 
2002). Understanding and predicting how boundaries and other spatial arrange-
ments of mulga and spinifex become unstable and vulnerable to large fires is an 
important research area.
Some major changes in vegetation in response to altered fire regimes have been 
reported in the Australian arid zone (e.g. Bowman 1998) but little studied. For 
instance, on the Nullarbor Plain, the combined effect of fire and grazing (chiefly by 
On the Ecology of Australia’s Arid Zone: ‘Fire Regimes and Ecology of Arid Australia’

266
rabbits) has reportedly converted large expanses of chenopod shrubland into open 
grassland with sparse shrubs (Burnside et al. 1995), although the evidence appears 
to be mainly anecdotal.
Fauna
The response of fauna to fire is broadly linked to postfire vegetation succession, 
particularly increasing cover and structural complexity of vegetation, attributes 
which tend to slowly recover in arid lands following burning. Fauna species have 
different habitat requirements (shelter, food, breeding sites), and therefore postfire 
vegetation dynamics tend to drive succession in animal species. This is generally 
the case for reptile species in spinifex grasslands (Masters 1996; Pianka 1996), mal-
lee (Nimmo et al. 2012) and dense Acacia scrub (Doherty et al. 2015), and is thought 
to reflect differences in thermoregulatory requirements (e.g. some reptile species, 
such as the dragons, Ctenophorus nuchalis and C. maculatus, need or are able to 
bask in full sun for prolonged periods, common to newly burnt areas, whereas oth-
ers, such as C. isolepis and C. scutulatus, need or prefer some shade). Letnic et al. 
(2004) also showed this is the case for reptiles in central Australian spinifex grass-
land but found the response in small mammals was more influenced by rainfall after 
fire. Consequently, they used a state-and-transition model involving various combi-
nations of rainfall and fire events to explain the dynamics of small mammals.
There are many vertebrate species in arid Australian with seemingly no relation-
ship with postfire seral stage or that have different fire age responses across their 
distributions (Driscoll and Henderson 2008; Nimmo et al. 2012, 2014; Doherty et al. 
2015). This demonstrates that, overall, postfire dynamics in fauna are more complex 
than predicted by successional change in vegetation alone, with some species 
responding to multiple factors (e.g. combinations of grazing, drought, rain, invasive 
species and/or fire). Further, specific habitat features required by fauna may not nec-
essarily change in gradual or predictable ways with fire age (Haslem et al. 2011), and 
some essential habitat features (such as tree hollows, food type, thick bark or dense 
litter) may only reappear after many decades without fire (Woinarski 1999; Haslem 
et al. 2011; Doherty et al. 2017). This points to the need to understand specific habi-
tat requirements of fauna species and how these vary with fire regime, as well as the 
importance of maintaining at least some old vegetation in fire-prone landscapes.
The decline of medium-sized mammals across arid Australia has been attributed 
to several causes, with altered fire regimes regularly put forward as one of these 
(Woinarski et al. 2015). Specifically, this refers to a change in burning patterns since 
the departure of traditional Aboriginal practices which favoured a fine-grain mosaic 
of vegetation at different seral stages. This contrasts with the contemporary regime 
of very large, hot wildfires (refer to section ‘Human use of fire and fire manage-
ment’). Maintaining or reintroducing patch burning has appeal, because it was the 
pattern in place for thousands of years, mitigates against damaging effects of large 
wildfires (Burrows et al. 2009; Latz 1995; Bird et al. 2016) and provides diversity of

seral stages and hence habitat diversity at fine scales. Although the biodiversity ben-
efits of patch burning have been questioned by some (e.g. Parr and Andersen 2006), 
many studies of fauna-fire links at the landscape scale report at least some species 
with preference for vegetation of a particular fire age or a specific mix of fire ages. 
For example, Lundie-Jenkins (1993) reported that for the endangered rufous hare-
wallaby, fine-scale seral diversity in spinifex grasslands is important. Pianka (1996), 
writing about the incredible richness of lizards in Australian deserts, noted that:
One of the most important factors contributing to this is fire, which generates a patchwork 
of habitats at different states of recover, each of which favours a different subset of lizard 
species. Habitat specialised species can go locally extinct within a given habitat patch (fire 
scar) but persist in the overall system by periodic reinvasions from adjacent or nearby 
patches of suitable habitat of a different age. Such spatial-temporal regional processes facil-
itate local diversity.
Masters (1996) reported that a higher number of reptile species were trapped in 
mature spinifex and that fire mosaics maximise reptile diversity because of the pref-
erence by some species for earlier seral states. She also made the observation that 
recently burnt areas act as firebreaks and ensure that mature spinifex patches are 
always present. Langlands et al. (2012) studying the relationship between fire and 
spiders reported similar findings that different spider assemblages preferred differ-
ent postfire states with about 50% of species restricted to a particular state. Similarly, 
Haydon et al. (2000) concluded that the patchwork of habitats at different stages of 
postfire recovery (seral states) played a vital role in the conservation of biodiversity 
in desert landscapes. Smith and Morton (1990), studying scorpions in the Tanami 
Desert, found that one species (Lychas alexandrinus) was caught most frequently 
2–3 years after fire.
The relationship between patch burning and small mammals is similar, but per-
haps not as pronounced. Masters (1993) found that patch-burning spinifex grass-
lands to create a diversity of seral states maximised the species diversity of small 
mammals by ensuring that suitable successional states were always present. She 
concluded that this was particularly important for species that are restricted in their 
distribution such as mulgara (Dasycercus cristicaudata). Letnic and Dickman 
(2005) working in the Simpson Desert found that while some species preferred 
long-unburnt spinifex and others preferred regenerating spinifex, the greatest cap-
ture rates were made at sites that received most rainfall. Like Masters (1996), they 
concluded that recently burnt patches were an important part of the mosaic because 
they reduced the extent of bushfires. Partridge (2008) working in the Purnululu 
National Park concluded that small-scale patchy spinifex fires were very important 
for Pseudomys desertor and P. nanus, which utilised long-unburnt patches for food 
and shelter.
Landscape heterogeneity driven by geomorphic-edaphic-vegetation patterns is 
also important for many animal species with fire potentially further enhancing this 
spatial complexity. For instance, Major Mitchell cockatoos (Lophochroa ­leadbeateri) 
require patches of old woodland with tree hollows for nesting but may also need 
recently burnt shrubland or spinifex nearby as seed of some pioneer plant species 
can provide an important food source (Nano et al. 2012b). Some species have large

268
home ranges, which may need to be catered for in any patch-burning approach (i.e. 
may need to leave large continuous patches of their preferred seral stage). Patch 
burning per se covers a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, as well as a range 
of fire intervals. In addition to understanding traditional Aboriginal burning pat-
terns, more landscape-scale studies are needed for a better scientific understanding 
of scale and biodiversity responses in relation to patch burning. Specifically, we 
need to know more about the patch sizes and spatial configuration of different fire 
ages to best maintain biodiversity within fire-prone arid landscapes.
Birds are a relatively well-studied group in the Australian arid and semiarid 
zones which demonstrates the above principles, with many bird species having dis-
tinct preferences for certain fire ages. In shrubland, mallee and mulga woodland, 
long-unburnt vegetation tends to be favoured by insectivores (such as the splendid 
fairy wren, Malurus splendens; inland thornbill, Acanthiza apicalis; rufous whistler, 
Pachycephala rufiventris; and grey shrike-thrush, Colluricincla harmonica). 
Generally these old patches have the greatest bird species richness, most likely in 
response to their greater within-patch complexity and/or food resources (Leavesley 
et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2012; Watson et al. 2012; Davis et al. 2016). A smaller 
number of bird species, mostly granivores such as the zebra finch, favour recently 
burnt areas. However, there are a number of bird species that do not respond to fire 
age (mostly generalists and/or nectarivores, such as spiny-cheeked honeyeater, 
Acanthagenys rufogularis, and singing honeyeater, Lichenostomus virescens), and 
for some species their fire age preferences can vary throughout their range (Davis 
et al., 2016). At the landscape scale, Taylor et al. (2012) found bird species richness 
increased with proportion of long-unburnt vegetation, rather than the mix of fire 
ages which reflects the relatively large number of bird species favouring old 
vegetation.
Fire Regimes and Climate Change
Climate change, both in the past and future projections, for arid Australia is 
described in chapters ‘Evolutionary History’ and ‘Feral Animals In The Semi-Arid 
And Arid Regions Of Australia; Origins, Impacts And Control’ of this book. 
Predicted higher temperatures in coming decades, including more days with 
extreme temperatures, will directly affect fire weather, resulting in more days of 
high fire hazard. This increase in fire hazard will be compounded by predicted 
declines in humidity and increases in lightning and wind speeds over arid Australia 
(Cary et al. 2012). King et al. (2013) predicted rises in the average daily fire danger 
index of up to 20% by 2070 for central Australia. This may not necessarily translate 
to increases in fire incidence and extent as generally drier conditions will reduce 
fuel loads and connectivity, particularly in more open vegetation such as spinifex 
grasslands, eucalypt woodlands and open shrublands (Bradstock 2010; King et al. 
2013). However, rainfall declines are predicted mainly for the southern arid zone, 
where relatively dense vegetation formations (such as mallee and dense shrublands, 
E. J. B. Etten and N. D. Burrows

269
which tend to carry crown fire) may actually become more susceptible to fire due 
to overall lower fuel moisture levels. The expected increase in rainfall variability in 
the northern arid zone would tend to mean more pronounced and possibly more 
frequent wetter periods which may ultimately result in more fires following these 
times due to enhanced fuel levels. The shift to more variable rainfall therefore may 
mean more pronounced periods of larger fires with intervening times of fewer fires. 
The shifting seasonality of rainfall across arid Australia is also likely to alter sea-
sonality of fires and perhaps fuel loads via changes in species composition. For 
instance, in the southern arid zone, increased incidences of summer rain may mean 
more C4 grasses which would increase fuel loads in woodlands and other open 
vegetation (e.g. Prober et al. 2012).
Fire-Herbivore Interactions
Given widespread pastoralism, especially in the woodlands and shrublands, across 
arid Australia, and the prevalence of medium-sized to large herbivores (both native 
and introduced), surprisingly few Australian studies have investigated the combined 
effects of grazing and fire. This contrasts with arid/semiarid regions of the USA and 
southern Africa where specific studies of interactive effects, including carefully 
designed manipulative experiments, are relatively common (e.g. Valone and Kelt 
1999; Allred et al. 2011). There are two interactions of particular interest to fire 
managers.
Firstly, sustained grazing pressure can suppress fuel levels resulting in fewer and 
smaller fires, but no studies have quantified this impact in arid Australia. Furthermore, 
soil and vegetation degradation through overgrazing likely reduces overall produc-
tivity and the capacity to regenerate following rainfall leading to long-term reduc-
tions in fuel loads. Due to past overgrazing, particularly during times of sustained 
drought, the herbage that sustains livestock in many rangeland areas is now pulses 
of annual herbs following rainfall, with the important perennial grass component 
now missing or reduced (Brandis 2008). Also under high grazing pressure, other 
palatable plants will decrease, while unpalatable species (mostly woody species) 
will increase (Burnside et al. 1995), further changing fuel characteristics. Much of 
the impact associated with overgrazing stems from artificial water points (surface 
dams and bores), which tend to maintain high grazing pressure (combined effect of 
native, domestic and feral animals) well above carrying capacity during dry times 
(James et al. 1999). Judicious management of these watering points is the key strat-
egy for limiting the negative effects of grazing. Over the last 10–15 years, there has 
been considerable change in the tenure and use of pastoral lands in Western 
Australia, with around one-third of leases either (being) converted to conservation 
tenure or now held by mining companies, nongovernment conservation ­organisations 
or Aboriginal groups with minor to no interest in grazing livestock (van Etten 2013). 
There is potential for fuel levels (and hence fire extent) to broadly increase with 
cessation or reduction in grazing on these lands, although this has not yet been

­demonstrated, and in fact it may take several decades of rangeland spelling before 
vegetation productivity and cover is replenished (Frank et al. 2013).
The second important interaction involves the postfire impacts of grazing. Grazing 
pressure on recently burnt areas can be profound, as new growth is often desirable 
and highly nutritious, with herbivores likely to move in from some distance to eat 
recently burnt vegetation (Letnic 2004). Such concentrated grazing likely reduces 
regeneration of grasses and other palatable species, accelerating the shift to woody, 
unpalatable species composition, as well as increasing other impacts of grazing such 
as loss of microbiotic crusts and enhanced erosion (Suijendorp 1981; Letnic 2004). 
Over the longer term, increased cover of woody plants likely further suppresses 
grasses which can lead to fewer fires and ultimately to a situation where fire can no 
longer occur (a state transition in ecological terms; Watson and Novelly 2012). 
Woody thickening is a widespread problem in arid and semi-lands and widely known 
for mulga vegetation, especially in eastern Australia, although this is largely reported 
as an impact of grazing alone (Noble 1997). The severity of grazing impacts on 
postfire regeneration would be expected to broadly decline with increasing fire patch 
size and the availability of other feed in the surrounding area (Allred et al. 2011).
Several authors have made the distinction between the impacts of grazing and 
browsing on vegetation, fuel and, thereby, fire (van Langevelde et al. 2003; Holdo 
et  al. 2009). Grazing reduces grasses and therefore fuel loads; fires, when they 
occur, are of lower intensity and less damaging to woody vegetation. Increases in 
density and cover of trees and shrubs are the likely consequence and may lead to a 
change of state to a tree-dominated system (Fig. 5). Browsing, on the other hand, is 
defined as animals feeding on the leaves of trees and shrubs which can result in an 
increase in grass biomass (i.e. fuel), which, in turn, results in hotter and more fre-
quent fires, which further negatively affects trees and shrubs. Therefore, browsing 
more likely leads to grass-dominant ecosystems, whereas grazing promotes woody 
plant dominance (Fig. 5). In arid Australia there are generally few browsers, although 
sheep may browse woody plants in time of extended drought. However, feral verte-
brates such as goats and camels are predominately browsers and are increasing 
(Edwards et al. 2010). As these feral animals suppress woody plants when their 
densities are high, there is potential for indirect impacts in terms of increased fuel 
loads and fire hazard (Brim Box et al. 2016). However, browsers and grazers (includ-
ing macropods) are usually both present in an area, and the interplay between them 
can be complex but will ultimately determine the impacts on vegetation structure 
and fuel loads (Holdo et al. 2009; Burrows, Chapter Feral animals in the semi-arid 
and arid regions of Australia; origins, impacts and control, this volume).
Although pastoral leases and grazing by cattle and sheep occur generally outside 
of spinifex country, Suijendorp (1981) did look at fire-grazing interactions in the 
west Pilbara where Triodia pungens can be partly palatable to livestock, especially 
when young; consequently, in this region, as in others, they burn this spinifex fre-
quently. The outcome of this, however, has often been an increased dominance by 
hummock grasses and unpalatable shrubs to the detriment of more palatable, co-­
existing grasses and herbs. Deferral of grazing for 1 or 2 years after fire leads to 
re-establishment of these more palatable species (Burnside et al. 1995).

Human Use of Fire and Fire Management
Although lightning is responsible for most of the area burnt in remote areas, Edwards 
et al. (2008) found most fires in central Australia were started by people. Situations 
where humans light fires in the arid zone include pastoralist burning to promote 
palatable plants for livestock or to protect assets; Aboriginal people burning for 
ceremonies and/or resource enhancement; conservation/land managers burning to 
protect cultural or biodiversity assets; and accidental or arson fire, especially along 
access tracks/roads and around towns and infrastructure (Edwards et  al. 2008; 
Turner et al. 2008). Edwards et al. (2008) note that relatively few areas have or are 
meeting formal fire management objectives.
While the pre-European fire regime has not been well quantified for many parts 
of arid Australia, there is sufficient evidence from ecologists (e.g. Jones 1969; Latz 
and Griffin 1978; Kimber 1983), and from Aboriginal people themselves, that fire 
was critical to their physical and spiritual wellbeing and that it was used widely and 
regularly. Using early (1953) aerial photographs from an area of the Great Sandy 
Desert, Burrows and Christensen (1990) quantified the extent of patch burning by 
Aboriginal people, who at the time had not been contacted by Europeans. The pho-
tography revealed a fine mosaic of burnt patches reflecting burning by local 
Aboriginal people prior to European contact (Plate 1). Given varying populations

A decrease in grass 
biomass leads to reduced 
fuel load which makes fire

and circumstances of the Aboriginal people, the extent to which such patterns were 
ubiquitous across this vast area is uncertain. Following European settlement, wild-
fires, mostly caused by lightning, have led to fire sizes of millions of hectares, sizes 
unlikely to have occurred under Aboriginal occupation. Presently, there is a growing 
concern about the threat to assets that such fires pose – for example, the people and 
buildings of remote communities, biodiversity, air quality (as greenhouse gas emis-
sions), cultural artefacts, pastoral properties, tourism and infrastructure associated 
with mining and other industries. To mitigate the threat, land managers are increas-
ingly turning to the cool-season-prescribed burning of these discontinuous fuels. 
The current summer wildfire regime throughout most of the spinifex grasslands is 
likely to be a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, 
methane and nitrous oxide; Burrows 2014). A return to traditional Aboriginal fire 
management, resulting in smaller, patchier fires lit in the cool season, may provide 
an opportunity for remote desert communities to contribute to reducing Australia’s 
greenhouse gas emissions, to increasing carbon stocks, to conserving biodiversity 
and to improving ecosystem health. This is because such mild fires remove less 
stored carbon at both local and landscape scales compared with summer wildfires 
(Murphy et al. 2015; Williams et al. 2015; Plate 2). In addition to environmental 
benefits, substituting wildfires with traditional fire management has significant 
social and cultural benefits. Done at appropriate scales, good fire management can 
also provide training, employment and economic opportunities (Burrows 2014).
Prescribed burning for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, whether done 
via mosaics/patches or narrow strips/firebreaks, can be controversial, but there is 
consensus that such burning is useful as it can prevent or minimise landscape-scale 
wildfires and their impacts (Pastro et al. 2011; Burrows and Butler 2016). Such 
wildfires, which may burn for many days, can burn through and damage fire-­
sensitive vegetation and generally homogenise landscapes in terms of fire age and 
seral stages (Allan and Southgate 2002). The optimal or most appropriate spatial 
and temporal configuration of fire ages to maintain biodiversity in a given landscape 
is still a matter of debate and may not be obtainable in some areas as ideal fire age 
configurations can differ substantially and even conflict between biotic groups 
(Pastro et al. 2011; Kelly et al. 2015; Doherty et al. 2017). Traditional Aboriginal 
burning is believed to have resulted in a complex array of different fire ages, sizes 
and arrangements which did restrict fire extent (Burrows and Christensen 1990; 
Burrows et al. 2006). The call to reinstate Aboriginal burning practices, therefore, 
has merit but may only be achievable where there are ongoing links to land and 
traditional knowledge, as well as willing and adequately resourced participants. 
Pastro et al. (2011) argue that, in the absence of such complex burning practices, the 
best burning strategy may be to protect fire-sensitive vegetation and species via 
burning to maintain low-fuel strips or areas around these assets. This strategy can 
also be used to protect long-unburnt stands or habitat that may harbour unique or 
uncommon species (e.g. Knuckey et al. 2016).
There are many difficulties and constraints in achieving active fire management 
in arid areas, including remoteness, lack of people and resources and difficulties in 
access. Over many types of land tenure across arid Australia, there are no or very

few people living on the land (e.g. unallocated crown land and some pastoral leases), 
a situation that has generally worsened over time. This means a rapid suppression 
response is usually not possible, and so the tendency is to only deal with fires once 
they become major outbreaks and are generally difficult to control.
Conclusions
Three contrasting fire regimes predominate across arid Australia consistent with the 
structure and biomass of broad vegetation types as fuel for a bushfire. Firstly, spinifex 
grasslands are highly flammable and fire-prone and experience relatively regular fires 
(~every 5–15 years) in response to combined effects of fuel accumulation (time since 
fire) and antecedent rainfall. Fire at appropriate temporal and spatial scales is essential 
for their maintenance. They are also relatively well studied in terms of fire effects and 
behaviour, and there is growing evidence that large, hot-season spinifex fires are harm-
ful to biodiversity and the environment with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. 
Fires in dense Acacia scrub and mallee are primarily linked to time since fire but 
experience less frequent burning (~every 30–80 years) because of the porous structure 
of the vegetation. When fires do occur, they are usually crown fires. Lastly, fire in open 
shrublands and eucalypt woodlands is relatively rare, because of the sparse and patchy 
nature of the vegetation and fuel. The role of fire in maintaining these ecosystems is 
questionable. These vegetation types occasionally burn following periods of high rain-
fall, which stimulates vegetation growth and, hence, fuel continuity; while they are 
able to recover from infrequent fire, there is little evidence that fire is essential for 
recruitment. Additionally, there are less common vegetation types which seem to be 
highly sensitive to fire and dramatically change in structure and species composition 
following even one-off burning (e.g. some chenopod shrublands, rocky uplands).
The arid and semiarid zones of Australia experience long periods of often severe 
fire weather. Low rainfall means long periods when the vegetation, especially dead 
material, is sufficiently dry to burn, and long periods of high temperatures, low 
humidity and strong winds ensure a large number of days when the fire danger rat-
ing is extreme, something which is expected to increase with climate change which 
may also increase the size and intensity of fires. Other future threats that are likely 
to alter fire regimes are the further spread and intensification of grassy weeds and 
introduced vertebrate browsers.

Archaeology and Rock Art of the North-
West Arid Zone with a Focus on Animals
Peter Veth, Jo McDonald, and Sarah de Koning
Introduction
In this paper we will focus on the Indigenous archaeology and rock art of the north-­
west arid zone of Western Australia. This includes the Little Sandy and Great Sandy 
Deserts (Western Desert) and the Pilbara uplands and arid coastline and archipela-
gos (Fig. 1). Remarkably, within just the last 5 years, some of the oldest and most 
comprehensive evidence has emerged for early occupation of Australia’s deserts, 
including the use of dietary marine resources and production of figurative art 
(McDonald 2016; Veth et al. 2017a, b; Wood et al. 2016). We provide these new 
understandings of the art and archaeology of the north-west arid zone from the key 
sites of Lake Gregory (Parnkupirti), the Canning Stock Route (Kaalpi), the Dampier 
Archipelago (Murujuga) and Barrow Island. Initial occupation of the desert has 
been extended back to 50 ka, and we now have a better understanding of the fluctua-
tions in arid zone occupation through the Holocene. Following a 15-year recording 
programme, Western Desert rock art provinces can now be contrasted with those 
from the Pilbara and specifically the Dampier Archipelago. We have previously pro-
vided a framework for major changes in art production as part of hunter-gatherer 
responses to climate change in the arid north-west (McDonald and Veth 2013a). 
Here we focus on the importance of desert fauna to people’s subsistence and social 
strategies and describe how these have been depicted in art through time.
The figurative component of the extensive engraved and pigment art bodies 
recorded include endemic fauna, sometimes introduced (post-contact) fauna such as 
horses as well as combinations of human and animal forms – known as therian-
thropic figures. The classes of fauna depicted on the current coastline predictably

reflect marine resources of the Indian Ocean, while hinterland assemblages depict 
faunal suites adapted to interior desert and xeric vegetation landscapes. Where more 
detailed analyses have been completed (e.g. Murujuga), we can illustrate that differ-
ent species are being depicted in the art and that there are changes in species com-
position through time. While absolute dating of rock art is still nascent, multiphase 
models predict at least a terminal Pleistocene age (approx. 20,000 BP) for some of 
these figurative repertoire (McDonald 2015, 2016; McDonald and Veth 2013a; 
Mulvaney 2013). Changes in the dominant species depicted over time are likely due 
to shifts in precipitation and vegetation, the loss of coastal plains with sea-level rise 
and the extinction of species such as the thylacine. Perhaps less well known to the 
natural science community is the inherently dynamic archaeological record of 
Australian desert hunter-gatherers, whereby not only do settlement and mobility 
patterns change, but the rock art shows significant changes in style, theme, subjects 
and key fauna through time (Veth 2006; McDonald 2016).
50,000 Years of Aboriginal Occupation of the Western 
Australian Arid Zone
Sitting at the top of the Canning Stock Route, Lake Gregory (Parnkupirti) repre-
sents the discharge of a large coordinated drainage system into the arid zone from 
the south-east Kimberley. Positioned within the vast linear sand dunes of the Great

Sandy Desert, this wide and shallow basin was up to ten times larger when first 
occupied by people. Excavations along the palaeo-shoreline of Parnkupirti exposed 
a sequence of artefacts from an earlier pluvial phase extending back to 45–50 ka. 
When this was a mega-lake, it was likely full of fish, shellfish and water birds and 
surrounded by grazing macropods (Veth et al. 2009a). At the southern end of the 
Canning Stock Route, Serpent’s Glen (Karnatukul) also demonstrates 50,000 years 
of occupation (McDonald et al. 2018), with changing artefact production and mul-
tiple phases of ochre use from different units. People were still using this shelter in 
the contact period, as documented by glass artefacts in the deposit and the use of 
pencil to outline earlier rock art motifs (O’Connor et al. 1998). This site is also part 
of an important ethnographic complex, indeed of such significance that the 
Birriliburu Native Title determination was held at this site with the Federal Court in 
2008. This is the oldest known site for the Western Desert and one of the earliest for 
desert hunter-gatherers globally (Veth 2005). The most recent phase of pigment art 
here has been dated by plasma-oxidation pretreatment AMS, and this has provided 
a clear picture of art phases being produced in the millennium before contact 
(McDonald et al. 2014, 2018). Episodic and increasing use of this landscape through 
the mid- to late Holocene is documented both in the archaeology and rock art pro-
duction (McDonald 2016; Veth et al. 2007, 2009).
There are now a number of Pilbara sites that record occupation from at least 
45 ka – with ebbs and pulses in habitation coupled to climatic variations (Morse and 
Ryan 2009; Slack 2015). Across the North West Shelf, excavations at the Montebello 
and Barrow Islands have revealed an ancient and continuing reliance on marine 
resources including mangrove and rocky foreshore gastropods, Baler shell as well 
as terrestrial arid zone fauna, beginning from as early as 51.1 to 46.2 ka (Veth et al. 
2007, 2014, 2017a, b). Occupation continues until 6.8 ka when the islands are cut 
off by rising waters, and then they are abandoned. The weakening of the Indonesian-­
Australian monsoon before the Last Glacial Maximum and then amelioration with 
rising sea levels (Field et al. 2017) by 14 ka with the re-initiation of the monsoon, 
and then islandisation by c. 7 ka, marks an evolving landscape with changing faunal 
compositions. Island assemblages show that marine and arid terrestrial faunal suites 
expand from between approximately 12  ka and 7  ka, when evidence for turtle, 
shark, porpoise, pelagic fish as well as over 40 species of dietary shellfish and tusk 
shellfish (Dentalium) beads are registered (Veth et al. 2017b). Located on the same 
plains as the Dampier Archipelago, the limestone caves and shelters here lack art. 
However, these have well-preserved remains of the same fauna as depicted in the 
rock art 100 km to the east (Fig. 1).
The Dampier Archipelago (Murujuga as it is known to its traditional custodians) 
juts into the Indian Ocean on the Pilbara coast. For much of human history, the jag-
ged scree slopes would have represented interior uplands of the Abydos Plains 
between the Pleistocene-aged coastline and Pilbara uplands. Excavations on the 
outer islands (McDonald and Berry 2016) indicate a staggered loss of some terres-
trial fauna and introduction of other marine elements (de Koning 2014). Ongoing 
excavations of a large rock shelter and several large midden and occupation sites on 
the Burrup Peninsula (McDonald field notes 2016; Lorblanchet 1983; Clune 2002)

indicate occupation before the Last Glacial Maximum and then repeated occupa-
tions until contact with European pastoralists, whalers and pearlers.
Rock Art Traditions of the North West: Between the Desert 
and the Sea
Systematic surveys for rock art along the Canning Stock Route through the Great 
Sandy and Little Sandy Deserts have identified an early and extensive desert art 
province with geometric, track and simple figurative engravings followed by mul-
tiple phases of engraved and pigment art production with varying proportions of 
geometrics and figurative motifs (McDonald 2005, 2016; McDonald and Veth 
2006a, b, 2012, 2013a). Within the most recent pigment phases, snakes are a com-
mon motif: this is Jila (water python) country where rainmaking and regeneration 
ceremonies accompany visits to named water sources, including mound springs, 
cisterns and rock holes (McDonald and Veth 2013b).
In the centre of the Canning Stock Route, ancient and continuing figurative art 
production can be found at the Carnarvon (Katjarra), Durba (Jilakurru) and Calvert 
(Kaalpi) Ranges as well as many other smaller sandstone outliers. Many of the more 
recent phases of art production include depictions of animals. The oldest art, which 
is difficult to date by chronometric techniques and which is dated through relative 
superimposition sequences, includes a large number of animal tracks, mainly bird 
(Fig. 2) and macropod, but also insects, such as centipedes, lizards and occasional 
human tracks. They are generally produced on horizontal panels, reflecting their 
‘natural’ position in the landscape. These early tracks are found amongst a largely 
geometric repertoire. Occasionally, human faces, made up of arrangements of cir-
cles and arcs, are depicted. These motifs are always heavily patinated and geologi-
cally altered.
Different rock art phases in the Western Desert have diagnostic graphics 
(McDonald 2016) and represent behavioural systems, which are argued to be cou-
pled with environmental changes. Significant changes in climate of importance to 
hunter-gatherers include pluvial conditions at the time of assumed colonisation 
(Veth et al. 2009), increasing aridity from 30 ka and especially during the Last 
Glacial Maximum between 22 and 18 ka (McDonald 2016; Veth et al. 2016a), and 
climatic amelioration by 14 ka, with warmer and then wetter conditions by the early 
Holocene (Reeves et al. 2013; Williams et al. 2015). Intensification of the El Nino 
Southern Oscillation 4–2 ka may have introduced stress to economic systems, while 
current conditions have prevailed since approximately 1.5 ka.
Desert hunter-gatherers are highly adaptable and will often alter their mobility to 
offset local and even regional resource stress (Veth 1993; Williams et al. 2015). 
Rock art is viewed as a way of socially mediating significant changes in environ-
ment and climate by signalling changing group cohesion, identity and boundary 
conditions (McDonald and Veth 2013a). Large-scale group-identifying behaviour 
may be shown through the depiction of geometric motifs such as concentric circles,

which represent both water sources and totemic sites  – with imagery, which is 
understood – and which links groups over very large distances (McDonald and Veth 
2012). Art produced in more fertile conditions – when groups become more territo-
rially tethered to identified homelands – sees the development of figurative reper-
toires where human and animal motifs (Fig. 3) contain very high levels of social 
information in body design, headdress morphology and so forth (McDonald 2005, 
2016). Animal depictions occupy an intriguing place in that they can represent prey, 
Ancestral Beings from the Dreaming, totems and regeneration sites (known in the 
West Pilbara as Thalu). They are also semiotic – depicted through their tracks – or 
shown with species-specific detail or more schematically (Fig. 4). The amount of 
information encoded in these different types of depictions can provide significant 
insight into the artists who produced them (Davidson 2018).
There are many shared elements amongst the rock art bodies between the Pilbara 
and Western Desert, and cultural connections are evidenced in both early and more 
recent phase art. Some early art, such as the archaic faces and climbing man motifs 
of Murujuga, reveal long-distance stylistic connections in deep time – far into the 
desert. Shared Dreaming narratives in the recent past such as the Two Lizard Men 
(Wati Kutjarra) and Seven Sisters (Minyiburu) demonstrate the chains of social con-
nection (McDonald and Veth 2013a). The rock art of the Pilbara shows more distinct 
boundary-making behaviour, consistent with the presence of distinct language 
boundaries across this highly dissected arid landscape. This sits in contrast to the 
relatively homogeneous art of the desert – where social groups are represented by 
different dialect groups of the one language (McDonald and Veth 2013a; Tindale 
1974; Wright 1968). The arid zone model, which integrates palaeoclimate, occupa-

tion and rock art phases from these different arid landscapes (McDonald and Veth 
2006a, b, 2013a; McDonald 2016), can also be applied to the coastal Pilbara: 
although here there is considerable overprinting by coastal economies, which have 
been in place since 7 ka after stabilisation of sea levels (McDonald 2015). While 
some art phases are shared between the Murujuga and Pilbara art bodies, there are 
also some noticeable differences, such as the low number of early cupules in the 
former (Mulvaney 2013).
The 42 islands of the Dampier Archipelago host one of the world’s largest con-
centrations of engravings estimated at greater than 1  M+ motifs. The National 
Heritage Listed Place (McDonald and Veth 2009) has at least seven art-style phases 
defined by the superimposition sequence (McDonald 2015; Mulvaney 2013, 2014) 
on highly resistant granophyre boulders (Pillans and Fifield 2013). In this locale, 
there is a clear transition from terrestrial fauna in the earliest assemblages to the 
most recent art having distinctively maritime themes (see discussion, below).

The softer calcarenite ridges of Port Hedland also house a major rock art prov-
ince. This is a rich figurative assemblage of largely geometric engravings – but dis-
tinguished by depictions of Ancestral Beings, marine and terrestrial fauna and 
distinct shields and artefacts with desert designs. A recent research project has sur-
veyed several major assemblages and provides high-quality data on faunal depic-
tions within a maritime-desert setting (Harper 2016; McCarthy 1962). Unlike 
Murujuga, all of this art appears to post-date sea-level rise and stabilisation.
Subjects depicted across the Pilbara include multiple phases of engraved and 
painted macropods, lizards, snakes, water birds, tortoise, echidna, moles, quoll, 
bandicoot and the dingo (Fig. 5). Several of the art provinces have thylacine depic-
tions (Fig.  6), and there are a number of provinces, which have remarkable 
therianthropes.
Analysis of Fauna from Rock Art Assemblages in the North-­
West Arid Zone and Proposed Style Phase Model
Where the desert meets the sea – at both Murujuga and Port Hedland – a cornucopia 
of marine fauna are depicted including whale, dugong, shark, turtle, pelagic fish, 
crab, crayfish and stingrays. There are also many depictions of humans in social/
hunting scenes. Some of the associated material culture items depicted, and a vari-
ety of faunal depictions, have never been described in archaeological contexts from 
the Australian arid zone. Rock art assemblages from across the Pilbara and desert 
(see Fig. 7) include naturalistic animal depictions and animal tracks as a significant 
component. The proportional frequency of animals and their tracks range from 28%

on the Pilbara coast and the Canning Stock Route and up to 45% in the Pilbara 
uplands (albeit from smaller assemblages). While there is a strong geometric pres-
ence, the zoomorphic depictions (ranging from 6% to 17%), when combined with 
human depictions, represent a significant figurative tradition amongst the western 
rangelands and arid coastline of north-western Australia. This has not generally 
been appreciated for the Australian arid zone.
X Axis Are Rock Art Study Areas
Western Desert rock art phases (Fig. 8), with projected age ranges (based on archae-
ological signatures), and behavioural correlates have been proposed (McDonald and 
Veth 2013a). These phases provide a chronological framework for diagnostic ani-
mal graphics and faunal depictions amongst these different styles. These are mod-
elled ages which will certainly change with ongoing excavation and future direct 
dating programmes on the art.

The earliest arid zone style (Phase 1, in Fig. 8), comprising engraved tracks of 
various macropods, reptiles and birds, is part of a pan-Australian arid zone tradition 
(Maynard 1979; McDonald 1993, 2016). This early art production shows long-­
range connections across vast tracts of country – and also illustrates the detailed 
knowledge by early settlers of the desert of the different species of kangaroos. 
McDonald’s early work in western New South Wales demonstrated that the key 
macropod species at the site were being depicted by artists – and that this accounted 
for much of the stylistic variability (McDonald 1993). It was also found that many 
of the tracks were narratives of macropod tracking and hunting – with different gaits 
(such as hopping, feeding, resting) often shown (Fig. 9).
A shift towards simple engraved outline fauna is modelled to occur during the 
Last Glacial Maximum and includes macropods, large snakes, large birds (probably 
emu) and reptiles. Post-Last Glacial Maximum engraved decorative infill figures are 
accompanied by a limited animal repertoire of snakes, lizards, quadrupeds and 
striped animals (dasyurids, bandicoot and thylacine) (Fig. 6). Later phases include 
pigment art, with a small number of engraved motifs being produced in the same 
styles (McDonald et al. 2014). This more recent art includes depictions of bush 
turkey (bustard), water birds, lizards, macropods and small quadrupeds. The pig-
ment art produced in the last 1500 years, when climatic conditions approximate the

present, includes depictions of snakes, moles, bandicoot, large water birds and rep-
tiles sometimes in therianthropic form and described as Ancestral Beings (in the 
desert this art is created in thick white pigment and lacks some of the diagnostic 
detail of earlier phases).
The types of fauna depicted illustrate clear differences in ecology and also the 
time spans represented by these art bodies (Table 1). The Murujuga faunal depic-
tions potentially extend back to 40 ka and cover the transition from arid plains to 
islands (McDonald 2015; Mulvaney 2014). This art has many examples, and in rela-
tively equal numbers, of birds and bird tracks (29.8%, N = 1260) and macropods 
and their tracks (23.5%, N = 997) and then turtles (15.5%, N = 659) and fish (10.6%, 
N = 448). In contrast, the Western Desert site of Kaalpi is dominated by birds and 
their tracks (61%, N = 723). Macropods and tracks (15.1%, N = 176) and snakes 
(13.8%, N = 161) are the next most common, followed by a range of quadrupeds 
(5%, N = 58). The post sea-level stabilisation assemblage at Port Hedland is domi-
nated by turtles, fish, stingray and other marine species (66.0%, N = 375). Snakes 
(8.6%, N = 49) and lizards (2.5%, N = 14) are relatively minor components, with 
birds present in very low numbers (0.7%, N = 4) and no macropods recorded within 
this sample.
Tracks and geometric motifs dominate arid zone art provinces, demonstrating 
the continuity of the earliest arid zone graphic traditions through time, as noted by 
many researchers (McDonald and Veth 2010, 2013a; Rosenfeld 1993; Smith et al. 
2008). However, when one examines the details by location, it is apparent that there 
is not only discontinuity, both across space and through time, in motif preferences, 
but where motifs persist, there are other stylistic indicators illustrating changing 
modes of production. Tracks (mostly bird and macropod) and geometric motifs pre-
dominate within the Western Desert provinces; however, zoomorphic motifs, 
cupules and abraded grooves are completely absent from Katjarra. Conversely, 
tracks generally seem to be less important at Murujuga and Wanmanna, while zoo-
morphic motifs are present in higher proportions in both of these complexes, com-
pared with both Port Hedland and the Western Desert sites.
In those provinces where there is pigment art production after the engraved tradi-
tions, distinct changes are witnessed through time. There are much higher propor-
tions of geometric motifs being produced using pigment. Zoomorphs – which occur 
more rarely in the most engraved art phases– contribute to much greater proportions 
in the pigment art repertoires of the Western Desert (McDonald 2016). Interestingly, 
zoomorphic motif types also change from large terrestrial mammals and birds in the 
earlier engraved phases to include smaller mammals, snakes and a range of reptiles 
during the pigment phases.

Murujuga Case Studies: Fauna of the Maritime Deserts 
of the North West
Recent analyses have demonstrated that the prehistoric Murujuga artists distin-
guished between the different species they were depicting in the art. Both macro-
pods and turtles have been found to show species-specific traits – and to demonstrate 
changing foci and styles of production through time (de Koning 2014; Stewart 
2016).
Turtles
Six sea turtle species (Australian flatback, green, hawksbill, leatherback, logger-
head, olive ridley) inhabit the waters around the islands of the Dampier Archipelago, 
where there are significant nesting rookeries. There is also one species of freshwater 
turtle (flat-shelled turtle). Using a zoological approach to create qualitative types for 
each species, de Koning (2014) has determined that species-level identification is 
possible from a large sample of engraved turtle motifs. More than half of a sample 
of 823 engravings from 40 sites could be identified to species (Fig. 10). Quantitative 
and qualitative characteristics were identified, some of which are used by zoologists 
in species description of this animal (Perrine 2003); however, the main criteria used 
by Western science are scute pattern and flipper shape. Other variables – such as 
body ratios – were equally effective in the archaeological analyses, and it is these 
characteristics which seem to have been deployed by Indigenous artists. There is 
morphological precision in the way these engravings were created, and it is sug-
gested that these stylistic choices are a deliberate decision on behalf of the artist to 
represent the multiple species (de Koning 2014).
While the art of the Dampier Archipelago has not yet been directly dated (Mulvaney 
2011; Pillans and Fifield 2013), a stylistic chronology which uses contrast state (a 
relative measure of weathering of the petroglyphs: Mulvaney 2014) and superimposi-
tion analysis has provided the general framework from which we understand how art 
production has changed through time (Fig. 11). This sequence commences during the 
Pleistocene, progresses through the insulation of the islands and formation of the 
Archipelago and continues up until European contact. A cornerstone of this sequence 
has been the observation that the earliest art includes terrestrial species (such as the 
emu), while the more recent art demonstrates a focus on maritime subjects (Mulvaney 
2010, 2014; McDonald 2015; McDonald and Veth 2009). Some earlier faunal depic-
tions, of large kangaroos and emu, almost certainly date to when the islands were 
landlocked during periods of lower sea levels when these range fauna were extant; 
today these larger species do not occur on any of the Pilbara islands.
De Koning’s (2014) study demonstrated that almost 20% of the analysed turtle 
motifs fell within the oldest contrast states (i.e. contrast states 1 and 2). This would 
imply that turtles were already a part of the socioeconomic life across this art prov-

ince during the terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene, when the islands were part of 
an inland range lying some distance from the sea (Ward et al. 2013). It is worth 
noting that the outer islands of the archipelago were proximal to the coastline by 
approximately 10 ka (McDonald and Berry 2016). Given the importance of coastal 
lifeways within Australia, the early maritime competencies demonstrated by the 
Pleistocene occupants of Barrow Island (around 100 kilometres to the west: Veth 
et al. 2014, 2016a, b) and the high mobility of arid zone hunter-gatherers (McDonald 
2015; Veth et al. 2014), it would appear that the earliest coastal hunter-gatherer-­
fisher peoples of the Abydos Plain have depicted this abundant coastal food source – 
many kilometres inland from its maritime source. Marine elements were part of the 
artistic repertoire on the Dampier Archipelago from some of its earliest artistic pro-
ductions. This new evidence agrees well with the emerging understanding of these 
early hybrid desert economies, whereby coastal groups had significant hinterland

estates and portrayed prime resources both at their source and away from them. This 
is a common pattern in the placement of key animals within the northern hemi-
sphere glacial refuges of Europe (e.g. David 2017).
Macropods
Eight species of macropod have been identified in engravings on the islands of the 
archipelago and in archaeological deposits prior to sea-level rise (Manne and Veth 
2015; Stewart 2016). Three hundred engraved macropod motifs were analysed 
(Stewart 2016) to explore the high levels of stylistic heterogeneity identified previ-
ously in the Dampier Archipelago (McDonald and Veth 2009; Mulvaney 2014). 
Macropod motifs can be defined by head, ears, body, arm, paw, leg and tail shapes, 
along with the stance, gait and tail-to-body ratio. Multivariate analyses indicated 
that these attributes could distinguish between the zoological macropod species 
present and could also be used to understand the stylistic conventions that define the 
macropods within Murujuga rock art (Stewart 2016: Chap. 5).
The traits of eight Murujuga macropod types were analysed, and the traits of four 
species (Macropus rufus, Macropus rufus robustus, Petrogale rothschildi and 
Bettongia lesueur) had very strong representation. Traits from a number of lesser 
known species were also detected, but in lower numbers (Table 2). This research 
found that the Murujuga artists depicted both obvious species aspects and subtle 
traits reflecting intimate knowledge of the local macropod species (Stewart 2016: 
p. 127). It was also found that species habitat data could be correlated with climate 
reconstruction (Ward et al. 2013) within the broad temporal periods of the phased 
stylistic model (Table  2). The species representations in the different temporal 
phases have a demonstrable analogue to the faunal data recovered from excavations 
on the Montebello Islands (Veth et al. 1994) and from Barrow Island (Veth et al. 
2016a, b). These results provide further support for the modelled art chronology 
(McDonald 2015; Mulvaney 2014).
Corroborative Archaeological Records for Faunal Depictions: 
The North West Shelf
Excavations on Barrow and Montebello Islands (Veth et al. 2007, 2014, 2016a, b) 
provide a record of northwest faunas from c. 51 ka until the mid-Holocene. Hunter-­
gatherers producing the art bodies from the Pilbara coast to the uplands were likely 
sharing the same cultural landscapes now drowned by rising sea levels (Manne and 
Veth 2015; Ward et al. 2015, 2016). The case for connecting palaeoeconomic and 
rock art records from adjacent areas of the North West is strengthened given the 
high levels of hunter-gatherer mobility deduced from Pleistocene-aged records

(Veth 2005). The likely size of group territories for the Australian arid zone has been 
underestimated in previous archaeological and demographic studies, which have 
uncritically projected ethnographic boundaries into the deep past (Veth 2005; Veth 
et al. 2014). Palaeoeconomic and rock art data sets from the wider North West, and 
certainly from the drowned coastal plains, need to be better integrated. The fauna 
that people hunted and embodied in mythological and religious narratives will be 
visible in both dietary and ornamental remains, as well as symbolic expressions 
such as rock art.
From between 51 and 42 ka, four species of dietary and utilitarian shellfish were 
being transported inland from the Pleistocene shoreline to Boodie Cave on Barrow 
Island. From the same period and prior to the Last Glacial Maximum, terrestrial 
fauna from Boodie Cave and the Montebello Islands are dominated by arid zone 
species, including the spectacled hare wallaby (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) and 
euro (Macropus robustus) (Manne and Veth 2015). These larger macropods are con-
sistent with prey targeted by male hunting parties, who may have used the cave as 
an inland bivouac. Post-Last Glacial Maximum, with rising sea levels and a more 
proximal coastline, the overall diet expands significantly to include 40 molluscan 
and 13 terrestrial species. The latter comprise largely small-to-medium game con-
sistent with foraging by family groups of mixed gender and ages. Assemblages 
dating prior to abandonment of Barrow Island and the Montebellos by 7.0 ka are 
exceptionally rich and contain significant quantities of marine fauna including fish, 
turtle, marine mammal, crab and sea urchin, along with freshwater and marine mol-
luscs. These economic fauna are precisely those depicted in the engravings from 
both Murujuga and Port Hedland, where our archaeological dietary evidence is less 
clear, because of the absence of suitable limestone caves to preserve this type of 
archaeological evidence.
The next step in ongoing analyses is to begin making correlations between suites 
of species represented in the rock art and the economic strategies of prehistoric 
hunter-gatherers of the North West, including innovations in hunting, trapping and 
netting. For example, there are turtle, dugong and fish remains associated with 
cooking hearth stones from Boodie Cave dated to c. 7 ka (Veth et al. 2014). There 
are depictions of people netting dugong, spearing turtle and fish and of course stone 
fish traps from the Dampier Archipelago (McDonald 2015; Veth 1993). Ongoing 
excavation programmes on Murujuga, Barrow Island and the Canning Stock Route 
are pushing back the early occupation sequences, recovering ancient ochres and 
artefacts and, importantly, providing evidence for extended terrestrial and marine 
faunal assemblages from the north-west arid zone.
The archaeological evidence for animal depictions from the north-west arid zone 
reveals a long figurative tradition, which is though to start before the Last Glacial 
Maximum and continues through the Holocene. Species depicted include large-­
range fauna such as emu and plains kangaroo, smaller territorially focused marsupi-
als such as wallabies and quolls and a wide variety of birds and reptiles. Species 
outside their current distributions or extinct include the bandicoot and thylacine. 
While depictions may have been executed to inform dietary, regenerative, totemic 
and mythological narratives, there is a precision in anatomical detail in all analysed

classes (e.g. kangaroos, turtles and fish) which allows robust attribution to genus 
and species levels. Between 28% and 45% of all motifs from the coast, ranges and 
desert lowlands are of animals and tracks. The painting and engraving traditions of 
the north-west arid zone clearly have a significant naturalistic component which is 
of significance for studies of human and natural ecology. This first review of animal 
depictions in the rock art of the arid zone illustrates there are changes in species 
depictions across different habitats and through time. Localised case studies of kan-
garoo and turtle depictions show accurate depictions to species level, and impor-
tantly these match archaeo-faunas recovered from stratified deposits in the wider 
region. Extinctions and changes in range are noted at the local and regional levels 
and include clear depictions of the thylacine across the arid zone, bandicoot and 
possum in the Little Sandy Desert and the nail-tailed wallaby, a species with a more 
tropical distribution today. Emu, large kangaroos and a number of quadrupeds are 
also recorded in the early art of the Dampier Archipelago. Ongoing excavations of 
50 ka sites from the Northwest Shelf and Canning Stock Route provide valuable 
faunal assemblages, which may be compared with, and linked to, zoomorphic rock 
art depictions.
While the rock art of the arid zone is often characterised as predominantly tracks 
and geometric motifs, in fact there is a long tradition of naturalistic, figurative ani-
mal depictions. Artists are clearly displaying familiarity with and detail of animal 
behaviour, tracks, body morphology and decoration to a level that allows accurate 
identification to family, genus and even species level. These understandings provide 
important data for cultural and natural ecology studies and ultimately more informed 
understandings of the values of the Australian deserts.

Weeds in Australian Arid Regions

Introduction
Australia’s arid interior spans some 3100 km in the east-west direction and 1400 km 
north-south covering a largely continuous 3.3 M km2 area across four states and the 
Northern Territory (NT) (Slatyer and Perry 1969; Watterson et al. 2015) (Fig. 1a). 
Although arid relative to the rest of Australia, this region has considerable heteroge-
neity in climate (the proportion of summer rain declines from north to south, the 
south receives mostly winter rain), topography (from ranges to salt lakes) and, 
therefore, vegetation communities (from woodlands to grasslands) (Slatyer and 
Perry 1969; Jessop 1981; Watterson et al. 2015). These landscape characteristics 
have considerable overlap with other arid regions of the world. As such, it is not 
surprising that the inevitable introduction of alien plant species into these regions 
has made novel contributions to the local flora, some of which are now highly inva-
sive and/or threatening.
Set in the arid interior of the NT, the award-winning children’s story of rosy dock 
(Baker 1995) illustrates the introduction of the weed Rumex vesicaria by European 
settlers and its subsequent invasion of the surrounding native vegetation. The story’s 
message is that, while the global redistribution of plants by early European settlers

was largely done with good intentions, the legacy of these actions continues in the 
form of invasive species such as the rosy dock. We are left wondering at the relative 
beauty of the massed invasive plant (the rosy dock) against the timeless appeal of 
the ancient native ecosystem it now occupies and what are the concerning threats 
that this weed now represents. Another legendary pathway for the introduction of 
weeds into arid Australia is via the vegetation-padded saddles of pioneering Afghan 
cameleers. Traversing the arid interior transporting goods, they discarded saddle 
stuffing and distributed seeds, including Cenchrus ciliaris (buffel grass) seed, at key 
waterholes, leaving them to establish and invade.
Understanding the historical context of plant introductions into the arid regions 
of Australia can be informative for guiding current and future management. In some 
cases we have greater certainty over the historical context of weed introductions. 
For example, the subsequent deliberate introduction of Cenchrus ciliaris seed can 
be traced to importations from Afghanistan following the First World War and the 
supply of seed for pasture production in both Western Australia (WA) and eastern 
Australia by the WA Department of Agriculture (Humphreys 1967). For many 
weeds, however, historical information about introductions is scattered through the 
literature and historical records, with no prior effort to synthesise information on 
introduction pathways for weeds in the arid zone of Australia.
For the majority of weeds in these Australian arid regions, the pathway of intro-
duction of most weeds is probably more prosaic than that of Cenchrus ciliaris. 
Albrecht and Rogers (1999) conclude for the Tanami desert region (NT/WA) that 
introduction of alien plant species is associated with the movement of vehicles, 
machinery, animals and deliberate plantings. The rosy dock invasion is illustrated 
by Baker (1995) as originating from a garden plant introduction which is highly 
likely. Indeed some of the more prominent weeds of Australian arid regions are the 
result of deliberate introductions, either as pasture (Cenchrus ciliaris) or as shade 
trees (Tamarix aphylla). At least three Prosopis species, together with their hybrids, 
were introduced as shade and fodder trees and have naturalised in rangelands and 
arid regions of Australia. However, a significant proportion of weeds appear to have 
initially colonised elsewhere in Australia and secondarily dispersed into arid 
regions. The analysis of possible pathways included in Gosper et al. (2015) indi-
cates that almost half (43%) of the 206 alien plant species found in the Great Western 
Woodlands of WA (Fig. 1a) are more geographically widespread in the neighbour-
ing Mediterranean (winter rainfall) climate regions of southwest WA. An additional 
group of alien species also of Mediterranean climate origin (19%) appears to persist 
in the arid zone only due to being associated with watered urban environments (e.g. 
Polygonum aviculare). Smaller percentages of aliens in the Gosper et al. (2015) 
study originated as dry region adapted urban or horticultural plantings (6%; e.g. 
Portulacaria afra) or spread from summer-rainfall arid regions to the north (2%; 
e.g. Argemone ochroleuca).
While there are clear plant dispersal pathways between temperate and tropical 
Australia and comparable regions in other parts of the world, this is not the case 
with arid Australia. This paucity of pathways reduces the likelihood of accidental 
weed introductions. For example, there are few trade or cultural connections 
Weeds in Australian Arid Regions

between Australia’s arid regions and the Saharan or American deserts. In addition, 
trade in Australia’s arid regions is largely one way, with massive amount of minerals 
and cattle being exported, but little being imported, especially without first transit-
ing via another non-arid part of Australia (e.g. Perth WA, Darwin NT). Thus, the 
main ports of entry for arid weeds into Australia can act as bioclimatic filters to the 
immigration of plant species adapted to these landscapes.
The introduction and establishment of alien plants are just the beginning of their 
influence on their recipient landscape (as outlined by the invasion pathway sensu 
Blackburn et al. (2011)). In this chapter we provide the first review of weed species 
in arid regions of Australia and their management. We contextualise some of the 
“good intentions” – introductions such as Cenchrus ciliaris which are now wide-
spread – and explore the often conflicting reasons behind the continued introduction 
of potential new weeds. In our focus on the impacts of these weeds, we also discuss 
the likely influence of anthropogenic global change, such as climate change, and the 
need to devise pragmatic yet robust management options for ecosystems that are 
now completely altered from their earlier states.
Characteristics of the Alien Flora of Australian Arid Regions
The characteristics of alien flora in the arid regions of Australia are best examined 
using the “weed status triplet” (Scott et al. 2014). That is, the properties of weeds 
(i.e. plants not wanted where they are found) can be best described based on (1) 
whether or not they are native or alien, (2) whether they are invasive or non-invasive 
(i.e. rapidly expanding their range) and (3) their level of impact (positive or nega-
tive) and the values associated with this impact. We follow the mapped definition of 
arid given by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Fig. 1a) corresponding to the 
region of western and central Australia where the average annual rainfall is below 
350 mm, although some of the examples we mention (such as the Great Western 
Woodlands, Fig. 1a) are from the edge of the arid region. We define a weed as a 
plant not wanted where it is found, a somewhat subjective status; weeds may include 
both native and alien species (Scott et al. 2014). By alien we mean plant species 
occurring outside their natural past or present range and with dispersal potential in 
the timeframe under consideration (sensu Webber and Scott 2012).
Native or Alien
The percentage of alien species listed in Atlas of Living Australia for the 20 arid 
zone IBRA regions averages 1.77% and has a range of 0–9.67%, the latter being for 
the region that includes the town of Broken Hill (Fig. 1b; 438 alien species). The 
percentages given in Fig. 1b are most likely an underestimate for many of the IBRA 
regions. In an earlier assessment, the flora of central Australia (Fig. 1a) included 6% 
J. K. Scott et al.

311
species alien to Australia out of 1872 flowering plant species (Jessop 1981). The 
only field guide to weeds of arid regions includes 91 species out of 260 recorded 
from southern NT (Dhanji 2009). By comparison, overall the Australian flora of 
17,590 species includes 11.1% species alien to Australia (Orchard 1999).
Up to 47 plant families are represented in the alien flora found in arid regions of 
Australia, the most common in terms of number of species being the Poaceae and 
Asteraceae (Jessop 1981). These two families are the third and fourth most species-­
rich families in the native Australian flora (Orchard 1999); only the Myrtaceae (with 
no alien species in arid regions) and Fabaceae (with few alien species in arid regions) 
have more species that are native to Australia.
One feature of the alien flora of Australia’s arid regions is the relatively low 
numbers of naturalised and invasive succulent species from the families Aizoaceae, 
Crassulaceae and Euphorbiaceae, despite species from these families being intro-
duced widely in Australia as garden plants. In contrast, Australia has already been 
subjected to invasion by members of the Cactaceae in southeast Queensland (QLD), 
where densities before management via biological control were so high that farms 
were abandoned (Hosking 2012). Some 27 Cactaceae species occur as established 
introductions to Australia, and of these, five are regarded as high risk in arid South 
Australia (SA) (Harvey 2009), and at least eight are naturalised outside urban areas 
in the NT (C. Brown, pers. comm. 27/7/2015). Cactaceae represent a serious threat 
to arid regions, and this is recognised in their status as Weeds of National Significance 
(WoNS) (Commonwealth of Australia and Australian Weeds Committee 2012) 
(Fig. 2a).
Native Weeds
Native weeds fall into two general categories. Firstly, plant species may be weedy 
(i.e. unwanted) in the area to which they are native. This includes “bush encroach-
ment” (often also referred to as invasive natives) and plants that are poisonous to 
livestock. The second category is species that are considered to be native to Australia 
but have newly arrived in the area under consideration either accidentally or delib-
erately (e.g. as garden plants). Given that native status implicitly involves spatio-
temporal context, and that Australia has a large area with considerable landscape 
heterogeneity, it is increasingly common for species to be moved within Australia to 
regions where they are not native. Moreover, there is likely to be an increasing inci-
dence of this last category as the climate changes. Webber and Scott (2012) outline 
the issues required to determine if a species is native or alien. Importantly, this 
framework deliberately separates a pre-determined management option from native 
or alien status, facilitating a range of management options for native species that 
have become weedy.
Regarding the first category, encroachment of native vegetation is widely reported 
to be a result of poor rangeland management, although a wide range of factors 
(reduced fire frequency, climate change, removal of predators, increased CO2

favouring C3 shrubs) may be responsible (Eldridge et al. 2011). Thus, plant species 
increasing in abundance are often perceived as having a negative impact and are 
treated and classed as weeds, triggering changed management or control options. 
Some species in arid regions are treated as “weeds” because they are toxic to live-
stock. Indigofera linnaei (Birdsville indigo) and Gastrolobium grandiflorum (desert 
poison bush) in the NT and Euphorbia boophthona (Gascoyne spurge) and 
Gastrolobium laytonii (Breelya) in WA are four examples of native species that can 
kill livestock (Gardner and Bennetts 1956; Mitchell 1979). Management of these 
plants is impractical, so the threat is minimised by avoiding areas where they occur.
The second category of native weeds are species that have extended, or been 
introduced, beyond their original range. For example, Heliotropium foliatum is 
native to northern Australia including the Kimberley and the coastal part of the 
Great Sandy Desert (Craven 1996). However, it appears to have spread southwards 
to the Pilbara in recent times, where there are now a few occurrences in native veg-
etation and mining areas. The native windmill grass, Chloris truncata, appears to 
have extended its range from eastern Australia to SA and invaded WA in the 1900s 
(Michael et al. 2012). Lastly, the legume Cullen graveolens is native to the Pilbara 
rangelands and has spread southwards through livestock transport to the southwest 
of WA (Hussey et  al. 2007). How these weed populations are categorised with 
respect to native or alien status depends on their natural dispersal ability, the dis-
tance dispersed and the time period under consideration (Webber and Scott 2012).
A minor additional category of weeds are those species for which it is not certain 
if they are native or alien. For example, Phragmites australis (common reed) is an 
invasive species of aquatic systems in arid regions (Hocking et al. 1998), where it 
encroaches into water up to 2 m deep, reducing flow and hindering access for people 
and livestock. Its native status in Australia is uncertain, because it has a cosmopoli-
tan distribution (Hocking et al. 1998). However, this does not preclude the need for 
management (Webber and Scott 2012). The application of novel genetic methods 
may provide insight into the historical biogeographic context of species such as 
Livistona mariae palms and their possible introduction by humans into arid Australia 
(biocultural dispersal; Kondo et al. 2012; Trudgen et al. 2012).
Invasive Versus Non-invasive
The presence of an alien plant species in a region does not necessarily mean that it 
is invasive. By invasive we mean a subset of naturalised plants that are undergoing 
or have the potential for considerable and rapid expansion of their geographic range 
(Richardson et al. 2000; Scott et al. 2014). Given the vast size and climatic hetero-
geneity of Australia’s arid region, it is not surprising that no alien species has colo-
nised the entire arid region, although some are already very widespread (e.g. 
Cenchrus ciliaris, Citrullus lanatus, Conyza bonariensis, Sonchus oleraceus). 
There is evidence that some alien species have occupied their maximum potential 
range in Australia and are now not viewed as actively invading. For example,

Carrichtera annua (Ward’s weed) appears to have started its invasion of Australia 
from a single site in SA and then experienced a lag phase of about 30 years before 
rapid spread (i.e. invasion; 20 to over 100 km/year) since the 1960s to reach a range 
limit determined by the requirement for winter rainfall and calcareous soils (Cooke 
et al. 2011).
Tamarix aphylla exemplifies possibly the most rapid weed invasion in arid 
Australia. This species is commonly planted around outback station homesteads. 
Floods along the Finke River, NT in 1974 are thought to have led to a sequence of 
events (including rapid dispersal of seed, disturbance of the river bed and bank with 
uprooting of river bank trees and incursion of saline water) that resulted in the rapid 
colonisation of the riparian ecosystem by Tamarix aphylla (Griffin et  al. 1989) 
(Fig. 2b). Subsequently, spread throughout the entire 600 km length of the river is 
attributed to vegetative reproduction through the dispersal of branch and root frag-
ments during floods (Fuller 1993). Tamarix aphylla has the potential to colonise 
other river systems across inland Australia, and, as such, it represents a significant 
threat to riparian environments in these regions – the community with the highest 
diversity and production in arid Australia. In contrast, some invasions, for example, 
that of Ziziphus mauritiana, have been relatively slow, though inexorable (Grice 
2002).
Flooding and wind dispersal are invoked in the story of the invasion of Rumex 
vesicaria (Baker 1995), while Griffin (1993) and Gosper et al. (2015) attribute the 
spread of Cenchrus ciliaris at Uluru National Park, NT and along the Goldfields 
Highway north of Kalgoorlie, WA, respectively, to the passage of vehicles. 
Favourable roadside microhabitats created by water run-off assist this spread. 
Pathways for weed invasion often depend on people: road maintenance (grading and 
slashing), road and rail corridor development and mining and exploration (sand 
mining in infested areas, transfer of weeds on vehicles (Fig. 2c); (Biosecurity South 
Australia 2012). In the NT, 1970s dust control measures on widely scattered 
Aboriginal communities included introduction of Cenchrus ciliaris. Feral animals, 
especially camels, continue to spread seed into areas remote from roads (Fig. 2d).
Invasion can also be measured in terms of increases in density. Prosopis sp. 
(mesquite) was planted in the 1930s on Mardie Station in northwest Australia 
(Fig. 2e). The historical pattern of invasion shows that the weed was widespread 
within only 35 years of planting, and subsequently it has infilled intervening area, 
indicating that cattle, and not flood events, were dispersing seed (Robinson et al. 
2008). The weed increased its area of cover by about 1% per year, resulting in an 
infestation of some 150,000 ha, 30,000 of which is dense (Robinson et al. 2008).
Known Impacts and Their Value Judgement
The third element for assessing weeds is the level of impact they are having in their 
introduced range and the significance and implications of this impact. Impact is a 
measurable change in the region of invasion that can be attributed, either directly or 
J. K. Scott et al.

315
indirectly, to the addition of an alien species (Scott et al. 2014), although the impor-
tance of the impact is always ultimately subjective. The most significant species in 
terms of impacts are called transformers; this is a subset of invasive plants that have 
impact to the extent that they change the character, condition, form or nature of 
ecosystems over a substantial area relative to the extent of that ecosystem 
(Richardson et al. 2000; Scott et al. 2014).
The most widespread and controversial alien plant in arid Australia is Cenchrus 
ciliaris (Fig. 2f). It is also the most-studied species, with reviews being published by 
Marshall et al. (2012) (as an environmental weed), Kharrat-Souissi et al. (2014) 
(role of polyploidy) and Grice et al. (2012) (the contentious nature of management 
as pasture or weed). Cenchrus ciliaris is widely and deliberately grown as a pasture 
plant in tropical and subtropical arid rangelands of the world, because of its high 
tolerance of drought and capacity to withstand heavy grazing (Fig. 2e). Consequently, 
it is an important economic species in Australian arid rangelands. It is, however, 
associated with significant negative environmental impacts, listed in Friedel et al. 
(2011) and Marshall et al. (2012), including increased fire frequency and intensity 
leading to the loss of trees, displacement of native grasses used by native herbivores 
and decline in richness of plant species and other organisms. Thus Cenchrus ciliaris 
can be viewed as both a negative and positive transformer species, depending on the 
value judgement of the assessing party.
Other weeds with known negative impacts in arid regions of Australia are not as 
controversial. The Weed of National Significance (WoNS) Prosopis spp. (mesquite) 
invasion of Mardie Station in the Pilbara is so dense that cattle are prevented from 
accessing water points (Dodd et al. 2012), and this is resulting in economic impact 
that is locally significant. The impacts associated with the invasion of the WoNS-­
listed weed Tamarix aphylla include increased salinity, reduction in plant and fauna 
species diversity, damage to infrastructure, reduced access to watering points for 
livestock and pasture losses (Griffin et al. 1989; Northern Territory Government of 
Australia 2016a).
Not all invasive species with impact are declared WoNS, although they may be 
declared significant under various state legislations. Orbea variegata (African car-
rion flower) was originally grown as a garden plant in arid regions and has estab-
lished in the chenopod shrub lands of Whyalla, SA (Dunbar and Facelli 1999). It 
impacts native vegetation by reducing growth by restricting water availability to the 
dominant chenopod shrub Atriplex vesicaria and the annual plant community 
(Dunbar and Facelli 1999). Indeed Lenz and Facelli (2003) showed that the native 
chenopod facilitates establishment of the alien species by providing shade and 
reducing temperatures to enhance germination and growth for the weed.
It is important to recognise that being invasive does not necessarily mean that 
there is a significant negative impact. The annual species, Rumex vesicaria, is a 
major invader of mine sites that are being rehabilitated (Schatral et al. 2008) and 
other disturbed areas (Fig. 3a). Rumex vesicaria was previously used as a rehabilita-
tion species (Schatral and Osborne 2002) and, being an annual species, would leave 
areas subject to seasonal erosion. Current practices avoid using alien weeds in res-
toration projects and aim to revegetate with native perennial species. However, the 
Weeds in Australian Arid Regions

316
persistent seed bank of Rumex vesicaria makes it hard to control once established. 
Asphodelus fistulosus (onion weed) is a very widespread, highly visible weed of 
roadsides and can form dense populations in southern parts of the arid and semiarid 
regions. There has been public pressure for biological control of this weed (Cullen 
2012). However, there is no clear evidence of economic or environmental impact in 
studies based in SA (Pitt et al. 2006), and it is likely that the abundance of the plant 
is a symptom of overgrazing. Another widespread species, Carrichtera annua 
(Ward’s weed) (Cooke et al. 2011) (Fig. 3b), also requires further assessment to 
determine if there is any agricultural or environmental impact. While it is poten-

tially toxic to livestock under drought conditions in NSW (Curran 2007), field 
experiments in SA by Harris and Facelli (2003) failed to show any competitive 
effects of Carrichtera annua on annual plant species. Further examples of 
­widespread annual species without obvious impact are Solanum nigrum (Symon 
1982) and Sonchus oleraceus. Both are strongly associated with human activity 
such as increased soil moisture and disturbance, and humans appear to be the most 
important dispersal vectors. Indeed, in Australia’s rangelands, the 70–80% of alien 
species that are annuals probably have little, or more subtle, impacts that remain to 
be measured (Grice 2006). Further research on impact, in particular to see if there is 
a lag phase between invasion and impact starting, is needed especially given the 
widespread distribution of these and similar species.
Some weeds are more a social nuisance, rather than having an economic or envi-
ronmental impact. Tribulus terrestris has spiny burrs that persist for years and are a 
constant nuisance in camping and town sites. Argemone ochroleuca (Mexican 
poppy) is also very spiny and likely to occur in ephemeral waterways in central 
Australia where people camp.
Weed Management
Weed management has to be strategic and carried out within an appropriate policy 
framework. At the national level, the Australian Weed Strategy with its identifica-
tion of 32 Weeds of National Significance (http://weeds.ala.org.au/WoNS/) provides 
an overarching strategy that encompasses the arid regions. Each state has developed 
a weed strategy that complements the national approach. These strategies have been 
the major factor in the development of management approaches for the control of 
Prosopis spp., Parkinsonia aculeata (Fig. 3c), Tamarix aphylla and more recently 
cacti. Each of the Weeds of National Significance has a “Best Practice Manual”, 
which guides management (these can be found on http://weeds.ala.org.au/). The 
only non-WONS weed of arid regions with comparably detailed management 
guidelines is Cenchrus ciliaris (Biosecurity South Australia 2012).
Australia’s Natural Resource Management Regions and Local Government areas 
also impose responsibilities for weed control. A further government requirement is 
for the identification of weeds in environmental impact assessments of potential 
mining activities. This has led to many mining companies having their own Weed 
Management Plans. Individual properties or stations may also have documented 
Weed Management Plans.
Complementing the management strategies is the development in Australia of a 
Weed Risk Assessment System (Pheloung et al. 1999). This provides a framework 
for identifying the plant species that could threaten the target region. Numerous 
plant species have been assessed, usually with a focus on species relevant to a par-
ticular state (examples can be seen at http://weeds.ala.org.au/weedmanagement.
htm). At a finer level, there is a need for risk assessment of cultivars of plants intro-
Weeds in Australian Arid Regions

318
duced to the region, such as if new cultivars of Cenchrus ciliaris are considered for 
importation.
One outcome of risk assessments is the identification of alert weeds (plants that 
currently have a restricted distribution but which could become important threats to 
biodiversity). Examples from the Alice Springs region are Cenchrus setaceus (foun-
tain grass), Prosopis spp. (mesquite) and Vachellia nilotica (prickly acacia) 
(Northern Territory Government of Australia 2016b).
The different strategies of weed management can be grouped along the biosecu-
rity continuum. First, there is the quarantine barrier and then management of incur-
sions by eradication and/or containment, while well-established weeds are subject 
to control through, for example, herbicides, mechanical treatments, fire, grazing, 
integration of two or more of these and biological control.
Quarantine Barriers and Other Preventative Methods
It is well recognised that garden plants are the most likely source of new weed inva-
sions. However, it is very rare (and often controversial) for this threat to be man-
aged. The recent survey of 16 Pilbara towns for cactus species has led to the removal 
of garden plantings and discovery of three new populations that have “jumped the 
garden fence” (Rangelands N.R.M. Western Australia 2015). Likewise, cacti inva-
sions have been detected in the NT (Batchelor Institute 2013). These preventative 
measures also educate the local population about the threat presented by cacti to 
arid regions. There are state-based quarantine barriers at borders and restrictions on 
the movement of plants within some states (e.g. WA), but there are no official quar-
antine barriers specifically in place to protect arid regions of Australia.
Eradication
Eradication means the removal of all individuals of a species, as well as possibilities 
for regeneration (i.e. seedbanks, vegetative parts) from an area into which there are 
limited possibilities of further immigration (Scott et al. 2014). Unfortunately, eradi-
cation programmes often fail, because the incursion is discovered a considerable 
time after it has begun (often more than 10 years); it is difficult to delimit the distri-
bution of the species, and long-lived seed banks compromise control attempts 
(Panetta 2015). Despite this, there are examples of control efforts that could eventu-
ally achieve eradication in the arid regions of Australia.
Nerium oleander (common oleander) is a toxic species with potential to form 
monocultures with impacts on native vegetation and stream flow (Edmunds 2010). 
This alien species has invaded 13 km of a creek in SA’s Flinders Ranges. Over 5 
years, landholders, volunteers and contractors have co-operated to control and 
J. K. Scott et al.

319
remove the plant with a longer-term objective of eradicating the weed from the area 
(Edmunds 2010).
A new infestation of the WoNS, Parthenium hysterophorus (parthenium weed) in 
the NT, is currently under containment with a view to eradication (Northern Territory 
Government of Australia 2016b). Also, Parthenium hysterophorus was detected in 
2011 for the first time in the Pilbara, WA. When detected, the infested area with 48 
plants was about one square metre and obviously at the initial invasion step. An 
eradication programme has started with monitoring assisted by the mine operating 
in the area (Penna and MacFarlane 2012). This eradication is likely to succeed as 
the biology of the weed is well known, and resources are available to survey and kill 
plants.
Containment
Containment is deliberate action to prevent range expansion within a predefined 
area (Scott et al. 2014; Fletcher et al. 2015). The management of an invasive palm 
and mesquite in the Pilbara, WA, are good examples of this strategy. The invasive 
date palm, Phoenix dactylifera, is being contained to the Millstream National Park 
(Department of Environment and Conservation Western Australia 2011) (Fig. 3d) 
by a range of methods. The male plants were left for aesthetic reasons in areas regu-
larly accessed by tourists, whereas female plants were removed. This was done to 
maintain the cultural heritage (oasis) aspect of part of the National Park. When the 
male plants die, they will be replaced with native vegetation. Another unusual aspect 
of palm management at Millstream was the excavation of living specimens that 
were transported to Perth, where the palms are not invasive, for use in urban land-
scaping. The containment of Phoenix dactylifera in the Pilbara needs to be a long-­
term activity, because there is a seed bank that requires management (Department of 
Environment and Conservation Western Australia 2011).
The largest infestation of mesquite (Prosopis species and hybrids) in Australia is 
on Mardie Station, and it is subject to a range of weed management methods with 
containment as a strategic goal. Initially, the plan was to contain the infestation to 
Mardie Station by preventing spread to neighbouring properties. Subsequently, nat-
ural features in the landscape that are unfavourable to the weed such as rocky ridges 
and hills were exploited as containment barriers. Quarantining cattle into holding 
paddocks for a period before movement onto mesquite-free areas is important, 
because cattle eat mesquite pods and are a significant dispersal agent of the seed. In 
addition, all machinery leaving the property is cleaned to prevent seed dispersal 
(Osmond 2003; van Klinken and Campbell 2009).
Weeds in Australian Arid Regions

Biological Control
Australian efforts in biological control across all ecosystems have targeted over 90 
weed species with over 240 agents (arthropods and fungi) being released and result-
ing in significant economic and environmental benefit (Julien et al. 2012). Twelve 
alien weed species found in arid Australia have been considered or targeted.
Preliminary assessment of potential biological control agents has occurred for 
Argemone mexicana and Argemone ochroleuca (Heard and Segura 2012), 
Asphodelus fistulosus (Cullen 2012) and Carthamus lanatus (Morin and Sheppard 
2012), but none have been introduced into Australia. In most cases the projects are 
suspended, because there has not been a sufficiently strong economic rationale for 
continuing the studies. The preliminary assessment of Tribulus terrestris (caltrop) 
found a diverse flora of native Tribulus species in the inland of Australia (Scott 
2012) which makes it difficult (but not impossible) to find host-specific biological 
control agents. An additional three genera of weeds have been targeted for biologi-
cal control, but their main distribution is outside the arid zone (Julien et al. 2012).
Biological control has been partially successful against Prosopis spp. in the 
Pilbara, WA (van Klinken 2012; van Klinken and Pichancourt 2015), the only case 
of some degree of success in arid Australia. Even so, management of this weed 
relies on a combination of biological control, mechanical and chemical control (van 
Klinken 2012), as well as quarantine and containment measures (as outlined above) 
and is an outstanding demonstration of integrated weed control. Parkinsonia acu-
leata (Fig. 3c) is also being targeted, including around Alice Springs, NT and the 
Pilbara region, WA (van Klinken and Heard 2012).
Biological control was considered as a solution to the problem of bush encroach-
ment by native weeds in arid and semiarid regions of QLD and NSW during the 
1970s and 1980s. Targeted species included Eremophila mitchellii, Eremophila 
sturtii, Myoporum deserti, Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustissima (Julien and 
Sparks 2012) and Cassinia sp. (Holtkamp 2012). Not surprisingly, this did not work 
given that the problem was probably due to overgrazing of the understory. Moreover, 
the potential control organisms, being native, would have been expected to have 
already reached ecological equilibrium with the host plants.
In addition to the weed species already discussed, prospective targets for biologi-
cal control of weeds in arid regions include Passiflora foetida (stinking passion 
flower, Fig. 3e, f), which is an invader of wetter microclimates (e.g. riparian ecosys-
tems) in the Pilbara region of WA, and the WoNS, Tamarix aphylla, whose conge-
ners have been successfully targeted by biocontrol in North America (Hudgeons 
et al. 2007). These potential targets, as well as the other mentioned above, where 
some research has occurred, all require better documentation of the impacts on the 
environment and economics, to decide whether the projects are justified and to 
allow any eventual benefits to be measured. Secondly, releases that have already 
been made into arid regions should be assessed, in particular to identify the environ-
mental conditions for success or failure. Thirdly, many populations of target weeds 
J. K. Scott et al.

321
occur in isolated populations, and redistribution of agents, perhaps on a regular 
basis, should be tried.
Chemical Control
Broad-scale application of herbicide does not occur in arid regions, being impracti-
cal across the large areas involved and given the low economic value of land. 
Instead, chemical control of plants in arid regions mostly involves highly targeted 
applications such as direct application to freshly cut stumps or control of weeds 
along water courses. Herbicide use is most appropriate when the infestations of 
shrubs or trees are sufficiently restricted and of sufficiently low density to warrant 
containment. Additional foliar sprays may be required as part of follow-up after 
larger plants have been sprayed, especially for regrowth from stumps, roots or 
stems. Prosopis spp., Parkinsonia aculeata and Tamarix aphylla are three invading 
tree species against which a range of chemical treatments have been applied 
(Osmond 2003; Queensland Department of Natural Resources Mines and Energy 
2004; Northern Territory Government of Australia 2016a).
Herbicide resistance is the most important issue affecting weed control in 
Australian agriculture and occurs in annual weeds of cropping (e.g. Chloris trun-
cata, Conyza bonariensis, Sonchus oleraceus) (Heap 2015) that are also weeds of 
arid regions. However, herbicide resistance has not been reported as originating 
from within the arid regions of Australia, probably because herbicide use is not 
intensive. Indeed, apart from herbicides for control of Weeds of National 
Significance, there are no herbicides specifically registered for general use in des-
erts or arid regions and only two for rangelands (Australian Pesticides and Veterinary 
Medicines Authority 2015). While Cenchrus ciliaris is listed as a pest of numerous 
crops (e.g. cotton), there are no herbicide registrations for weeds in Cenchrus cili-
aris where it is grown as a pasture (Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines 
Authority 2015).
Mechanical Control
Bulldozing, blade-ploughing and deep-ripping are used to open up dense infesta-
tions of Tamarix aphylla so that herbicides can be applied. This approach has been 
applied along over 400  km of the 600  km infestation on the Finke River, NT 
(Northern Territory Government of Australia 2016a). A range of large-scale 
mechanical treatments (e.g. chains, front-mounted blade plough) have been trialled 
for Prosopis control (van Klinken and Campbell 2009).
Weeds in Australian Arid Regions

322
Fire, Grazing and Integrated Weed Management
Depending on the species concerned, weed impacts can be reduced or enhanced by 
fire. Fire was an integral part of arid Australian ecosystems for many thousands of 
years before European settlement. The introduction of livestock, combined with a 
reduction in fire frequency, contributed to the development of “woody weed” infes-
tations in many susceptible areas (Noble 1997) including western NSW (see also 
“Native weeds” above). Provided that adequate fuel can be re-established, fire has 
the advantage of being far cheaper than chemical or mechanical treatments for com-
bating woody weeds (Harland 1993; van Klinken and Campbell 2009). On the other 
hand, fire on its own may encourage the spread of Cenchrus ciliaris (Miller et al. 
2010), but, if combined with follow-up herbicide while regrowth is green, it will aid 
control. Strategic grazing through fencing to soil type and stock water placement 
and management can reduce the growth and reproduction of Cenchrus ciliaris, as 
can integrate weed management involving various combinations of mechanical, 
herbicide, fire and grazing treatments at different spatial scales (Friedel et al. 2011).
Potential Uses
Some novel uses have been proposed for weedy species. For example, Arundo 
donax (giant reed), which presents a weed risk to riparian areas of arid and semiarid 
Australia, as well as much wetter regions, has been proposed as a source of biofuel 
and could be managed outside riparian areas with strict protocols which were 
required to prevent infestation of waterways (Virtue et al. 2010). “Woody weeds” 
could become a source of carbon credits through avoiding clearing of bush-­
encroached land, but questions regarding other values such as future pastoral pro-
ductivity and biodiversity outcomes remain unresolved (Grant and Gavin 2015).
Climate Change
The future climate of Australia’s arid regions (by 2090) is projected to be warmer, 
to have more frequent hot days and to have less frost (Watterson et al. 2015). There 
is likely to be less rainfall in winter (in the south) and in spring (throughout), but 
climatic changes in other seasons are unclear. The intensity of heavy rainfall events 
is projected to increase, but changes to drought frequency and intensity are less 
clear. Tropical cyclones are likely become less frequent, contrasting with an increase 
in the frequency of more intense storms.
More intense storms will likely increase the dispersal ability and invasion poten-
tial of weeds, many of which are associated with watercourses (e.g. Tamarix 
aphylla), and also provide suitable disturbed soil and open habitats for weed 
J. K. Scott et al.

323
­colonisation (e.g. many annual weeds and grasses). However, an increase in the 
number of hot days and less winter rainfall could make the arid regions less favour-
able for species originating in the Mediterranean and temperate climates of the 
south. It is not clear if there will be a lessened threat of weed invasion from the 
north, and responses to climate change are likely to be species-specific.
The assessment of climate change responses by arid-zone species has mostly 
focused on Cenchrus ciliaris. It acclimates to higher temperatures (Dwyer et al. 
2007), increases growth in conditions of increased atmospheric CO2 (Rudmann 
et al. 2001; Bhatt et al. 2007) and maintains competitiveness and response to fire 
under increased CO2 (Tooth and Leishman 2014), conditions expected under global 
climate change. Higher temperatures may favour Cenchrus ciliaris, being a C4 spe-
cies, whereas increased CO2 may favour C3 shrubs over C4 grasses, and declining 
rainfall may disadvantage all grasses (Friedel et al. 2014). Cenchrus ciliaris repre-
sents a major threat to the Great Western Woodlands (GWW), which are found on 
the southern boundary of the WA arid zone (Prober et al. 2012). Bare sandy areas 
characteristically separate vegetated areas, inhibiting extensive fires, but colonisa-
tion of these bare areas by Cenchrus ciliaris following climate change could lead to 
fire-induced transition from forest to grassland. Overall however, the ecological 
impact of climate change on weedy species in arid Australia is unclear.
Cacti are already a threat to Australia’s arid rangelands under current climate. In 
addition, their CAM photosynthetic pathway preadapts them to the projected 
decreased rainfall under climate change. Because of the vast size of the arid zone, 
biological control will be the most likely solution to weed problems. However, the 
impact of the main biological control agent of cacti, Cactoblastis cactorum, may be 
compromised by increased CO2 (Scott et al. 2014; Webber et al. 2014). The issue of 
climate change impacts on the sustained efficiency and effectiveness of existing 
biological control programmes is an urgent one, requiring research and monitoring 
to forewarn of future changes (Scott et al. 2014).
Change in climate may require new approaches to and philosophies for vegeta-
tion management. Significant shifts, expansions and contractions in species distri-
butions, either tracking climate change naturally or via changes to landscape 
connectivity, will require rethinking of what it means to be native (Webber and Scott 
2012). Secondly, our attitude to invasive alien trees may change due to their value 
in providing shade for thermal moderation. For over a century, the gardens around 
station homesteads in the arid region have generally been planted with alien shade 
trees. Some of these (e.g. mesquite, athel pine) have become major weed problems. 
However, there are many other alien trees that have not shown invasive tendencies, 
and perhaps these should be used in managed plantations as a refuge for animals 
under a climate of increasing temperature.
The occurrence of fire will also be affected by climate change. Bradstock (2010) 
argued that while weather suitable for fire might be somewhat predictable, vegeta-
tion responses to fire and lightning ignition rates are less so. Higher CO2 may advan-
tage shrubs over grasses, reducing available litter. On the other hand, it may change 
the carbon/nitrogen ratio and slow decomposition, so that litter remains as a fire 
intensifier in the landscape for longer. Less rain may mean less litter, whereas higher

temperatures may lead to increases in litter production by some invasive grasses. 
The implications for flammable invaders or for control of bush encroachment will 
depend on local conditions including land use (Friedel et al. 2014).
Threats Posed by Australian Species to Arid Regions 
Elsewhere
Very few arid region species native to Australia have become weeds elsewhere in 
the world, and of those that have, it appears that all the global invaders of Australian 
origin belong to the family Chenopodiaceae. At least four species of Atriplex (A. 
eardleyae, A. lindleyi, A. nummularia and A. semibaccata) are established in karoo 
shrublands and other arid biomes in southern Africa (Mucina and Snijman 2011), 
while Atriplex lindleyi and Atriplex nummularia are naturalised in North America 
(Welsh 2015). Maireana brevifolia, a widespread arid region plant in Australia, has 
also been introduced to semi-desert regions of South Africa (Mucina and Snijman 
2011) and is now recorded from Chile, the Middle East and the Canary Islands 
(Mucina and Snijman (2011) and references therein). Another chenopod species 
Salsola australis is a major invader of pasture in North America but was previously 
considered to be Salsola tragus, a Eurasian species (Borger et al. 2008). This spe-
cies has been targeted for biological control in North America, with the search for 
agents being directed to Asia. A future management option for North America 
would be to search for biological control agents in Australia.
We contend that the number of weeds from Australian arid regions is low primar-
ily because there are no crops and very few pasture species (e.g. Atriplex lindleyi) 
that originate from this region. The invasion risk of the recently developed Australian 
pasture legume, Cullen species (Dear et al. 2007), should be assessed. Additionally, 
there is almost no trade to similar climate regions (most trade is with colder regions 
(minerals) or tropical or Mediterranean regions (livestock)), and tourist activities 
are limited (few roads, limited and expensive accommodation), reducing the oppor-
tunity for export of species from the Australian arid regions.
Conclusions
Australia is a global leader in weed management research and implementation, in 
no small part due to the large number of invasive alien plants introduced into the 
country. Arid regions of Australia, however, are under-represented in both propor-
tions of weed species for the continent and relative to native species, as well as the 
awareness of impacts and invasion dynamics for these weeds. While the former 
issue is good news for weed management, it does not remove the need for an 
improved understanding of the weeds that are already there and an awareness of the

threats that weeds, both existing and novel ones, might represent in the future. This 
review represents the first overview of weeds of Australia’s arid regions, and from it 
we can draw the following four insights. Firstly, weeds of arid regions are qualita-
tively different from those in other regions of Australia, with few species involved, 
mainly from the plant families Poaceae and Asteraceae. Secondly, while few species 
have spread and become invasive (Tamarix aphylla, Prosopis spp., Opuntia spp.), 
the impact of a few species can be significant, in particular the grass Cenchrus cili-
aris, a species with the capacity to spread over most of the arid region (Lawson et al. 
2004). Some native species are a threat both to arid regions in Australia and else-
where in the world. Thirdly, management options come from across the biosecurity 
continuum, including the use of chemical and mechanical treatments, fire, grazing, 
combinations of these (integrated weed management) and biological control, and 
have been remarkably effective in some situations. Lastly, future climate change has 
the potential to exacerbate the threat from weeds, creating new opportunities for 
invasion, potentially compromising current control options, and requiring new 
research approaches. What this synthesis also highlights is the need for sustained 
and increased research for improving the management efficiency and effectiveness 
of weeds in arid regions to avoid another case of the rosy dock situation, “spreading 
like a red blanket further than the eye can see” (Baker 1995).

Feral Animals in the Semi-arid and Arid 
Regions of Australia: Origins, Impacts 
and Control
Neil D. Burrows
Introduction
For millions of years, Australia’s terrestrial fauna and flora, driven by climatic oscil-
lations and geomorphological processes, co-evolved in isolation. The result was a 
rich diversity of unusual wildlife, high levels of endemism and, prior to the arrival 
of humans, a pristine wilderness existing in a dynamic equilibrium. Following the 
arrival of Aborigines some 40–60  ka, Australia ceased to exist as a wilderness. 
Largely through hunting and burning the vegetation, Aborigines changed the struc-
ture and composition of the biota (Roberts et al. 1994; Bowman 1998; Flannery 
2002; Gammage 2011; Jurskis 2014). This was further exacerbated by the introduc-
tion of the first feral animal to the Australian continent, the dingo (Canis lupus 
dingo), some 3500–4000 years ago from neighbouring Indonesia or New Guinea 
(Gollan 1984; Clarkson et al. 2015). The dingo established across the entire main-
land, including the arid zone, and asserted itself as a top-order predator (Glen and 
Dickman 2005; Moseby et al. 2012). It is thought to have caused the extinction of at 
least three vertebrates on the mainland: the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), 
the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the Tasmanian native hen (Gallinula 
mortierii) (Corbett 1995; Johnson and Wroe 2003).
European settlement in 1788 saw the beginning of an unprecedented level of 
human-caused disruption to the Australian environment and its biota which included 
the introduction of exotic plants and animals, of which 23 species of mammals and 
26 species of birds successfully established in the wild (Bomford 1991; Forsythe 
et al. 2004). Native wildlife has had to compete with a range of introduced and feral 
animals for habitat, and native fauna has been subjected to highly efficient predators 
such as the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the feral cat (Catus felis), preda-
tors against which they have poorly evolved defences. Many feral animals adapted

well to the Australian environment, and without factors that normally control popu-
lations in their natural environment such as climate, food, habitat availability, preda-
tion and disease, the feral animals quickly populated, spread and occupied suitable 
habitats across the continent, often displacing native wildlife. Feral animals have 
had and continue to have significant ecological, environmental, economic and cul-
tural impacts on Australia. For example, the economic impact on agriculture alone 
is estimated to be in excess of $285 million dollars per annum (Gong et al. 2009) in 
addition to the largely immeasurable damage to other less tangible environmental 
values. Feral animals impact on native wildlife by predation, competition for food 
and shelter, destroying habitat and spreading diseases. Feral cats and foxes have 
contributed to the decline and local extinction of native birds, reptiles and mammals 
(Clarke 2001; Kinnear et al. 2002; Denny and Dickman 2010); herbivores such as 
rabbits, feral goats, horses, donkeys and camels have caused irreversible damage to 
vegetation, habitat, soils and waterways (Mckenzie et al. 2006). The annual envi-
ronmental cost of vertebrate pest animal damage, as difficult as it is to value, is 
estimated to about $350 million (McLeod 2004), and the combined annual environ-
mental, biodiversity and agricultural cost has been estimated at close to $1 billion 
(Saunders et al. 2010).
Introduced and feral animals carry a variety of diseases that can impact domestic 
stock, pets and native animals. Hendersen (2009) reviewed diseases and pathogens 
in feral pigs, foxes, wild dogs, feral cats, feral goats, rabbits, cane toads, rodents and 
European carp and reported this group of animals hosted a range of serious bacte-
rial, viral, fungal and helminth diseases and protozoan pathogens capable of affect-
ing a wide range of native species. Feral animals can also carry and spread diseases 
commonly found in domestic stock, providing a reservoir for diseases and parasites 
that is not readily controllable.
The extent of impact of feral animals on environmental, economic, social and 
cultural values is a function of the species of feral animal, its distribution and den-
sity, there being thresholds below which negative impacts are negligible or immea-
surable (Hone 2007). Cost-effective control measures, therefore, will aim to reduce 
impacts to values to acceptable levels, rather than to eradicate the pest animal per se. 
However, in the absence of good data on the density – damage level relationship, 
setting appropriate control objectives and expenditure is problematic. Given this 
context, this chapter provides an overview of the feral and introduced pest mammals 
that are of most concern to environmental and economic values in the arid and semi-­
arid regions of Australia. An introduced animal is any exotic animal introduced to 
Australia, whereas a feral animal is a species that was originally brought to Australia 
as a domestic animal (as a companion animal or as livestock) but which has escaped 
domestication and become wild. Species such as the European red fox that were not 
domesticated but were introduced into the wild for hunting are technically not feral 
animals but introduced pests; however, for simplicity exotic mammals that have 
adapted to the wild will be referred to here as feral animals.
Following their introduction, many species of feral animals dispersed into the 
harsh climatic environment of semi-arid and arid Australia. For many species, such 
as deer, climate and vegetation were barriers to their establishment, preferring more

mesic forests and woodlands (Hall 2005), but other species were able to persist and 
thrive because of artificial watering points (James et al. 1999) or because they were 
well adapted to arid environments. Of the feral mammals found in Australia, 11 
inhabit various parts of the arid and semi-arid regions of the continent, being cattle 
(Bos taurus), goat (Capra bircus), camel (Camelus dromedaries), donkey (Equus 
asinus), horse (Equus caballus), fox (Vulpes vulpes), cat (Felis catus), rabbit 
(Oryctolagus cuniculus), house mouse (Mus musculus), black rat (Rattus rattus) 
and pig (Sus scrofa). Of these, cattle, goat, camel, horse, donkey, rabbit, cat and fox 
are of most concern with regard to economic and environmental impacts in the 
semi-arid and arid region. Black rats are of conservation concern where they occur 
on arid offshore islands, and there have been some successful eradication programs. 
The origin, basic ecology, impacts and control methods for each of these will be 
considered in the following pages.
Cattle (Bos taurus)
Origin
Six cattle were among livestock that arrived from England with the First Fleet, and 
within months of arrival, they had wandered off and became feral – possibly the 
second species to do so (after the dingo). Over the ensuing years, cattle numbers 
increased with breeding of local herds and further imports. With the expansion of 
pastoralism, herds spread across the continent, including the semi-arid and arid 
region, where the establishment of artificial watering points enabled a beef industry 
to be established. Invariably, cattle escaped from pastoral properties, or evaded 
muster, and lived in a wild state. Cattle need regular access to water, so water avail-
ability has limited their spread. Today, most feral herds in the semi-arid and arid 
regions can be found in the rugged Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western 
Australia in national parks and unfenced pastoral properties where they have access 
to artificial watering points or to pools in river systems and wetlands (Low 2008) 
(Fig. 1, Plate 1).
Impacts
As with almost all feral animals, the extent of environmental and economic impact 
depends on their population density and the resilience of the ecosystems they 
inhabit. If numbers are sufficiently high, feral cattle can interfere with the running 
of pastoral properties by increasing grazing pressure, contaminating the genetic 
quality of domestic herds, and hosting diseases. As with domestic stock, feral cattle 
feed on a range of native grasses, herbs and shrubs. While there are few detailed

studies on the ecological impacts of feral cattle specifically, it is known from obser-
vation that excessive cattle grazing and trampling is particularly damaging to soils, 
riparian zones and wetlands including mound springs, many of which are of high 
conservation significance. Damage to soil and vegetation structure by cattle in cen-
tral Australia can degrade the habitat of reptiles and small mammals, including the 
rare bronzeback snake lizard (Ophidiocephalus taeniatus), the critically endangered 
central rock rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus) and the vulnerable crest-tailed mulgara 
(Dasycercus cristicauda) (Cogger et  al. 1993; Cole 1999; Masters et  al. 2003; 
Crowley 2010; Read and Cunningham 2010).
Control
Maintaining boundary fencing in good condition will reduce the number of stock 
becoming feral. Feral cattle may also be trapped at watering points or caught during 
general mustering operations. If resources are available, feral cattle can be fenced

out of sensitive habitats such as mound springs and riparian zones. In inaccessible 
terrain, aerial shooting is the most effective form of control.
Goat (Capra hircus)
Origin
As with cattle, feral goats arrived with the First Fleet to provide a source of fresh 
meat and milk, and in the 1800s, angora and cashmere goats were imported to South 
Australia from Asia to start a goat fibre industry. With the collapse of the industry in 
the 1920s, herds were set free and became feral. Being ‘hardy’ and a source of fresh 
meat and milk, goats accompanied settlers, miners and railway- and telegraph-­
construction camps throughout Australia’s arid and semi-arid regions in particular 
(Parkes et al. 1996). Today, feral goat populations are largest in the semi-arid and 
arid regions, with about 2.6 million feral goats occurring in a wide range of habitats 
across about 1.21 million km2 (Parkes et al. 1996). The main concentrations are in 
western New South Wales, Midwestern Queensland, central eastern South Australia 
and Midwestern Western Australia (Parkes et al. 1996). These areas are mostly arid 
or semi-arid lands used for pastoralism, primarily for wool sheep. The distribution

336
of feral goats in arid and semi-arid rangelands is limited by availability of water. 
Populations can be sustained where there are artificial watering points or permanent 
natural waters in river systems and mound springs.
During an era when sheep wool was in high demand, feral goats competed with 
the more valued sheep for food, causing an estimated annual loss to sheep produc-
tion of about $17.8 million (Parkes et al. 1996). Because of their damaging impacts 
on the pastoral industry and the environment, feral goats are declared pests in sev-
eral states. Consistent with the legislative requirements for landholders to manage 
pest animals, and because they competed with the more valuable sheep, goat num-
bers in the pastoral regions were controlled to relatively low levels by commercial 
mustering, trapping at watering points or shooting. However, during the 1990s the 
demand for wool, hence its price, fell, resulting in many pastoralists selling their 
sheep flocks and turning to ‘farming’ feral goats as a source of income; some juris-
dictions now refer to feral goats not as declared pests, but as ‘rangeland stock’, 
causing confusion about their legal status (Forsythe and Parkes 2004). Consequently, 
their numbers nationally increased rapidly from about 1.4 million in 1997 to 4.1 
million in 2008 (Pople and Froese 2012). Aerial surveys in 1987 and 1990 of 1.2 
million km2 in the Gascoyne-Murchison region of Western Australia estimated the 
feral goat population at about 363,000 and 596,000, respectively, an 18% per annum 
rate of increase (Southwell and Pickles 1993). Aerial surveys in South Australia 
estimated the feral goat population in 1990 at 200,000 (Pople et al. 1996). In good 
seasons, feral goats can increase by 40–75% per annum (Mahood 1985; Henzell 
2008), highlighting their fast reproductive rate in suitable conditions (water and 
food). However, in 2010 the national feral goat population had declined to about 3.3 
million (Pople and Froese 2012), and recent anecdotal evidence suggests that num-
bers may have declined even further as a result of the fickle market for goat meat 
and an increase in the density and distribution of wild dogs (Fig. 2, Plate 2).
Impacts
As mentioned, feral goats compete with livestock for food, often a scarce resource 
in the semi-arid and arid regions of the country. Where they occur at relatively high 
densities, feral goats are the most destructive pest animal in the semi-arid and arid 
regions. They are highly efficient generalist herbivores, able to eat almost any veg-
etation including foliage, bark, twigs, flowers, fruits, roots, plant litter and seeds on 
the ground (Parkes et al. 1996). Grazing by feral goats can prevent seedling regen-
eration and significantly alter the floristic composition of plant communities 
(Harrington 1986). There are few plants in the semi-arid and arid pastoral regions of 
Australia that goats can’t and don’t eat. Unlike sheep or cattle, goats are sufficiently 
nimble to stand on their hind legs, or partially climb trees to browse. In addition they 
are able to access vegetation in rugged gorges, breakaways and stony ranges, habi-
tats usually inaccessible by other stock but which often support rare assemblages of 
plants and animals (lizards) (Gibson et al. 2012). They are particularly destructive

to vegetation that has not evolved with herbivores such as island vegetation (Parkes 
1990). Unlike other stock and most native herbivores, feral goats can persist during 
drought conditions, provided they have access to water, because they are able to 
survive on low-nutrient fibrous vegetation (Doyle et al. 1984). Unprecedented levels 
of herbivory during droughts can cause irreversible changes to plant communities. 
A number of studies report that removal of vegetation by feral goats, together with 
trampling, increases soil erosion (Henzell 1993; Elderidge 1998; Bayne et al. 2003). 
For example, Green et al. (1998) found that high-intensity grazing by goats near 
Cobar in New South Wales rapidly removed grass, killed most shrubs and damaged 
the soil structure making it highly susceptible to wind erosion. They concluded that 
this would lead to an increase in unpalatable shrubs, a decrease in perennial grasses 
and a reduction in the productivity of these semi-arid lands.
There are few studies quantifying the extent to which feral goats impact on the 
habitat of native fauna, but given their damaging impact on vegetation and soil, it is 
likely severe where grazing pressure is high. The Department of the Environment, 
Water and Heritage (DEWHA) (2008a) lists 57 threatened taxa that could be 
adversely affected by unmanaged goats, including 8 species of birds, 45 plant

­species, 1 insect and 3 mammal species, being the yellow-footed rock-wallaby 
(Petrogale xanthopus), the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (P. penicillata) and the black-­
footed rock-wallaby (P. lateralis) (Gordon et  al. 1993; Sharman et  al. 1995; 
Menkhorst and Hynes 2010; Pearson 2013). The New South Wales Scientific 
Committee also identifies six threatened reptile species and two ecological com-
munities that are likely threatened by feral goats. There is considerable anecdotal 
evidence of the damaging impact of high levels of grazing by feral goats. For exam-
ple, following the removal of almost 30,000 introduced herbivores, including about 
15,000 feral goats, from the Peron National Park in the Shark Bay World Heritage 
Area in Western Australia, over a 10-year period, there was an increase in the recov-
ery of the vegetation and sightings of the threatened thick-billed grasswren 
(Amytornis modestus) (Brown 2001). The build-up of feral goat droppings around 
water holes and springs can degrade and damage habitat through eutrophication, 
thereby affecting freshwater biodiversity (Parkes et al. 1996).
Because of their potential to severely and permanently degrade native vegetation 
and damage soils, competition and land degradation by feral goats are listed in the 
Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 as a ‘Key Threatening 
Process’ to the survival of native species.

Control
As mentioned, in most Australian states, feral goats are classed as pest animals, and 
there is a legal requirement to control and, in some cases, to eradicate them. However 
this is contradicted by economic incentives to retain feral goat herds as an alterna-
tive source of revenue, especially following the decline in wool prices (e.g. Norris 
and Low 2005; Agnew et al. 2010), so the provisions of the law pertaining to the 
pest status of feral goats are rarely enforced.
Notwithstanding this, the most cost-effective feral goat control measures depend 
on a number of factors such as the density of goats, remoteness, accessibility, com-
mercial opportunities and nature of the terrain and whether they are watering on 
artificial or natural watering points (Campbell and Donlan 2005; Agnew et al. 2010). 
Goats have been successfully trapped on artificial watering points during dry peri-
ods when there is no surface water, the preferred option when there is a market for 
the goats (Russell et al. 2011). Where trapping is not feasible or desirable such as in 
rugged or inaccessible terrain, aerial shooting has been successful (Pople et  al. 
1998), although Bayne et al. (2000) reported that aerial culling is relatively expen-
sive (average $61 per goat) and that success is variable depending on whether the 
herd was naïve to aerial culling, in which case culling success was 40% (of the 
herd), or whether the herd had previously experienced aerial culling, when success 
rate fell to 21% as animals exhibited evasive behaviour. Other techniques that have 
been employed with limited success include ground shooting and poisoning of 
water holes with 1080 poison (Brown 2001). Agnew et al. (2010) provide an inte-
grated framework for feral goat control, the elements of which include mustering, 
aerial culling and trapping at water points, with the sale of goats for meat off-setting 
the cost of the control program. Because of the potential for rapid reinvasion, it is 
essential that goat control measures are regionally coordinated across a number of 
adjoining landholders (Pople et al. 1998).
Camel (Camelus dromedaries)
Origin
One-humped camels were first introduced into Australia from Pakistan around 1840 
as a means of transport, both as riding camels and in harnessed teams for hauling 
heavy loads. Their physical and physiological attributes made them ideally suited to 
arid and semi-arid conditions. They were used in preference to horses for exploring 
the dry interior, for hauling heavy loads associated with major infrastructure proj-
ects of the day including the construction of railways, roads, telegraph lines and 
barrier fences, and they were used for hauling agricultural products and mining 
equipment (McKnight 1969). Because of the cost of purchasing and shipping cam-
els to Australia from Pakistan, the largest, strongest animals with good temperament

were chosen, establishing something of a superior gene pool in the Australian camel 
population, which peaked just prior to the rise of motorised transport in the 1920s at 
about 20,000 (McKnight 1969).
Following the introduction of motorised transport, thousands of camels were 
released into the bush to become feral. Today, feral camels are widely distributed 
throughout arid Australia, occupying some 3.3 million km2 of arid Western Australia, 
South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Queensland (Saalfeld and 
Edwards 2010) (Fig. 3). Short et al. (1988) estimated the national camel population 
to be 43,000 in the late 1980s, and Edwards et al. (2004a) estimated a minimum 
population of 300,000 by 2001 and suggested the population was growing at about 
10% per annum. By 2008 following increased aerial survey effort across a number 
of jurisdictions, the population was estimated at about 1 million (Saalfeld and 
Edwards 2010), of which about 50% occur in Western Australia, 27% in the Northern 
Territory and the remainder in South Australia and Queensland. The variability in 
population estimates is not only due to the different times the estimates were made 
but also to the different sampling techniques and assumptions made when extrapo-
lating sample data to the continental scale. Notwithstanding this, the population of

341
feral camels in arid Australia is probably in the vicinity of 750,000 animals, making 
Australia the only country in the world with a significant wild dromedary camel 
population.
Camel population density in the arid zone is highly variable but averages about 
0.3 animals km2 (Ward et al. 2005; Saalfeld and Edwards 2010). There is no indica-
tion that the feral camel population size has stabilised, and in the absence of natural 
predators, disease or coordinated control programs, the population will likely con-
tinue to grow at about 10% per annum for the foreseeable future (Edwards et al. 
2004a) (Plates 3 and 4).
Impacts
Camels are well adapted to the semi-arid and arid regions of Australia. Primarily 
browsers, they can feed on a wide range of plants, go for long periods without drink-
ing water and travel large distances in search for food and water, and their physiol-
ogy is such that they can tolerate the often extreme climatic conditions of the arid 
zone (McLeod and Saunders 2001; Dorge and Heuck 2003; Lethbridge et al. 2010). 
While there are limited detailed studies on the ecological impacts of feral camels, 
there is mounting evidence that they are having significant negative impacts on a

342
range of environmental, economic, infrastructure, social and cultural values 
throughout arid Australia. These impacts have been detailed by Edwards et  al. 
(2010) and include damage to vegetation by browsing, trampling and suppression of 
recruitment; competition with native animals for food, shelter and water; degrada-
tion of wetlands and rock holes important to local Aboriginal people through foul-
ing, trampling and sedimentation; damage to remote community infrastructure 
particularly during drought periods when camels tend to congregate around com-
munities; and damage to infrastructure on pastoral properties including fences and 
watering points. Edwards et al. (2010) estimated the cost of damage by feral camels 
on assets that could be commercially valued at $10.7 million per annum.
Diet studies have shown that camels will eat a broad range of plants, feeding on 
about 80% of available species (Dorge and Heuck 2003). They will selectively and 
heavily browse some species including uncommon plants such as Santalum acumi-
natum, Acacia sessiliceps and Erythrina vespertilio, which is a concern for the con-
servation of these species in landscapes occupied by camels. Other preferred species 
include Santalum lanceolatum, Ventilago viminalis, Atalaya hemiglauca and 
Eremophila longifolia, but these species recover following good rainfall (Dorge and 
Heuck 2003). Edwards et al. (2010) list 43 central Australian plant species that are 
vulnerable to local extinction or depletion as a result of camel browsing. The list 
also includes species that are culturally important to Aboriginal people. Dorge and 
Heuck (2003) reported that in central Australia, significant damage to vegetation 
occurred when camel density exceeded two animals per km2. This is an average 
figure for a particular land system, and it is likely that in some drier habitats such as 
near Lake Eyre, or around water points and rock holes, or for preferred browse

­species, serious damage could occur at lower densities (Lethbridge and Pitt 2009; 
Edwards et al. 2010). The impact of feral camels on fauna habitat is largely unknown, 
although reducing camel density is a recommended action to protect the habitat of 
a number of endangered arid zone mammals including the crest-tailed mulgara 
(Dasycercus cristicauda) (Maxwell et al. (eds.) 1996).
Control
Aside from human intervention, there are no constraints to the population growth of 
camels in the Australian arid zone into the foreseeable future. Outside the pastoral 
zone, non-commercial control efforts have been spasmodic and largely ineffective 
in significantly reducing overall population growth. In the absence of any foresee-
able natural controls to the continued growth of the feral camel population and com-
mensurate increase in negative impacts, it will be the responsibility of landholders 
and managers to reduce the negative impacts of camels to arid zone values. Camels 
are large animals living in an open, exposed landscape, so theoretically could be 
eradicated by aerial shooting. However, given the vast area occupied by camels, this 
is probably unachievable and unnecessary, so targeted control to protect local assets 
is a more feasible strategy. Having knowledge of where the primary assets are in 
relation to the distribution of feral camels, and some knowledge about the relation-
ship between camel density and impacts on assets, enables cost-effective local or 
landscape-scale control programs to be planned and implemented. As a rule of 
thumb, Edwards et al. (2010) recommend that feral camels should be managed to a 
density of 0.1–0.2 animals per km2 or less in order to lessen broad-scale negative 
environmental, economic, cultural and social impacts. In some circumstance, as 
mentioned above, this density threshold may be less. Localised control of camel 
densities to protect identified, local values will require an ongoing control program, 
as camels will continue to reinvade from beyond control zones.
Culling (commercial and non-commercial) is currently the only effective means 
of controlling feral camel populations. Commercial operations are preferable 
because it is ‘self-funding control’, there are some economic benefits to participants 
and the culled animals are utilised. Virtue et al. (2016) reported that 16.5% (27,000) 
of feral camels removed under the Australian Feral Camel Management Program 
were commercial operations where camel meat was utilised, mostly for pet meat. 
Modelling by Zeng and Gerritsen (2013) concluded that in the short to medium 
term, commercial harvesting at these levels would not reduce the feral camel popu-
lation, although they noted there were some social and economic benefits. They 
concluded that initially large-scale culling is necessary to reduce the camel popula-
tion to a level where a growing commercial harvesting industry could provide effec-
tive population control. There are many challenges to commercial culling of feral 
camels including remoteness, the clumped distribution and mobility of feral camels, 
transport costs and the relatively low value of camel meat as pet food (Virtue et al. 
2016). Other commercial opportunities such as harvesting feral camel meat for

344
human consumption and exporting live camels are small markets and, under current 
cost structures, will not enable the establishment of a significant industry in the 
foreseeable future.
Non-commercial culling, or culling to waste, is carried out from the air or on the 
ground. Local or landscape-scale aerial culling programs can be very effective, 
although costly, ranging from $60 to $100 per camel culled. These programs will 
not reduce the overall feral camel population in the long term, but if repeated at suf-
ficiently regular intervals, they can significantly reduce the local density of camels. 
Historically, culling operations have been paid for by governments, so there is 
uncertainty about the level of ongoing funding necessary for regular culling opera-
tions. Occasional ad hoc culling operations that do not have clear asset protection 
objectives, including setting threshold levels of camel densities needed to protect 
assets, or which expend money and effort on operations where camel densities are 
below the ‘threat’ threshold anyway, are ineffective and wasteful. In order to deter-
mine whether a culling operation is warranted, that is, whether animal density 
exceeds the threshold, it is important to carry out a pre-cull aerial survey. Post-cull 
surveys are necessary to enable the success or otherwise of the culling operation to 
be measured in terms of proportion of animals removed and remaining density. The 
measure of successful feral camel management is not the number of animals killed, 
but the number remaining, and the likely impact these will have on valued assets. 
Opportunistic, regular culling from the ground, such as is undertaken by many pas-
toralists, can be effective at maintaining low camel densities (Gee and Greenfield 
2007).
Appropriately robust fencing including electric fencing can be an effective bar-
rier to feral camels. Construction and maintenance of long distances of fencing will 
be cost prohibitive in most situations, but it may be a viable option for relatively 
short distances to protect high-value assets such as cultural values (e.g. rock holes) 
and conservation assets.
There is a need for either controlled studies or the establishment of long-term 
monitoring sites to better quantify the environmental and ecological impacts of feral 
camels in various locations and at various densities. This will help land managers 
make decisions about cost-effective, targeted control strategies.
European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)
Origin
Domestic rabbits for eating arrived from England with the First Fleet in 1788. The 
first feral populations, numbering in their thousands, were reported in south-east 
Tasmania in 1827 (Williams et al. 1995). In addition to domestic rabbits becoming 
feral, rabbits were deliberately introduced into the wild near Geelong, Victoria, in 
1858 for hunting and spread rapidly across the continent. By the 1890s they were

345
well into South Australia and Queensland, by 1900 they had penetrated the deserts 
into central Australia, and by 1910 they had crossed the Nullarbor into Western 
Australia (Williams et  al. 1995). Colonisation of Australia by rabbits has been 
reported as the fastest rate of colonisation by an introduced mammal anywhere in 
the world; the fox followed close behind the rabbit (Caughley 1977). Today, rabbits 
are one of the most abundant and widely distributed wild animals in Australia, 
occurring in almost all habitats south of the Tropic of Capricorn, above which their 
distribution is patchy. Either high temperatures, periods of moisture imbalance, 
shallow soils or poor quality browse limits or prevents rabbits from establishing in 
the north. They are widespread but patchy throughout the semi-arid and arid regions 
of the continent south of the Tropic of Capricorn, favouring more fertile soils on 
run-on areas, by-washes, drainage lines, breakaways and lakes systems. In arid 
environments, their distribution and abundance fluctuates, depending on the seasons 
(rainfall) (Fig. 4, Plate 5).

346
Impacts
Rabbits have had a massive adverse impact on the Australian environment, probably 
more than any other introduced animal. Before the introduction of myxomatosis and 
rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD), they caused significant and, in places, irreversible 
damage to native vegetation, habitat and soils as well as profoundly impacting agri-
cultural production. Prior to the introduction of RCD, annual production losses in 
the agricultural industry attributable to rabbits have been estimated at $600 million 
(McLeod 2004; ACIL 1996). In the arid and semi-arid zone, economic losses due to 
rabbits include decreased livestock carrying capacity as a result of competition, soil 
and pasture degradation and crop losses due to grazing, digging and burrowing. For 
example, on a pastoral property in South Australia, stock carrying capacity increased 
by 40% following rabbit control (Williams et al. 1995).
As well as economic impacts, rabbits have had severe environmental impacts in 
the semi-arid and arid zones. In the absence of controlled experiments, it is difficult 
to isolate the impacts of rabbits on the environment from the combined, cumulative 
impacts of all herbivores including livestock and native animals. However, there is 
well-documented evidence of rabbits competing with native fauna for browse and, 
in some cases, wiping out native plants (Croft et  al. 2002). The rabbit ‘Threat 
Abatement Plan’ (DEWHA 2008d) lists 19 endangered bird species, 13 endangered 
mammal species and more than 100 endangered plant species, many of which occur 
in the arid zone, as threatened by rabbits. Of particular concern is that rabbits can 
destroy seedling regeneration, preventing recruitment and leading to localised extir-
pation of native plant species (Auld 1990; Henzell 1991). In the semi-arid and arid 
regions, there are many relatively long-lived arborescent keystone plant species 
such as a mulga (Acacia aneura), the rare Murchison snakewood (A. burrowsiana) 
and cypress pine (Callitris columellaris) that only recruit episodically, usually

­following exceptional rainfall seasons. Infrequent but otherwise successful germi-
nation of these plants can be destroyed by rabbits and other feral animals such as 
goats, and in the absence of recruitment, these populations eventually senesce and 
die (Lacey 1972; Lang and Graham 1983; Henzell 1991; Cooke 2011). During 
drought, rabbits ringbark shrubs and small trees and completely strip leaves and 
twigs from shrubs, often killing the plants (Williams et al. 1995 citing Hall et al. 
1964). Rabbits have severely damaged chenopod vegetation and caused the extirpa-
tion of several chenopod species in western New South Wales (Beadle 1948). As 
well as severely altering the structure and floristic composition of plant communi-
ties, grazing by rabbits can denude the vegetation, exposing soil to severe erosion 
(Myers et al. 1994; Eldridge and Simpson 2001). Competition for browse by rabbits 
has been implicated in the multifactorial causes of decline and extinction of medium-­
sized mammals in the semi-arid and arid zones (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989), and 
there is evidence that rabbits displaced native burrowing mammals such as the 
boodie (Bettongia lesueur), rufous hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus) and bilby 
(Macrotis lagotis) (Williams et al. 1995). In addition to having direct effects on 
native species through competition, rabbits contribute to the impact of introduced 
predators on native fauna by maintaining higher densities of these predators. 
Possibly the only ecological benefit afforded by rabbits, particularly in the context 
of a declined native mammal fauna in the arid zone, is that they are a significant 
food source for large raptors such as the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) (Olsen 
1995).
Control
Prior to the release of myxomatosis in 1950, attempts at controlling rabbits such as 
shooting, trapping, fencing, poisoning, introduction of exotic predators (such as fer-
rets and cats) and ripping burrows had little long-term impact on the spread, density 
and impact of rabbits (Williams et al. 1995). However, within 6 months of its release, 
the rabbit-specific myxoma virus was reported to have killed 99% of rabbits as the 
virus spread through the temperate regions of Australia (Kerr and Best 1998). 
Within a relatively short time though, the mortality rate reduced to 30–80%, as 
exposed populations developed resistance (Deeker 1992; Best and Kerr 2000). In an 
arid region of South Australia, the introduction of myxoma virus has no effect on 
the local rabbit population, but rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) had a significant 
and lasting impact on the population (Bowen and Read 1998). Mosquitoes and fleas 
transmit the myxoma virus, but because these vectors prefer moist, temperate cli-
mates, the virus has had little impact on rabbit populations in the arid region. 
Consequently, myxomatosis has been effective only when mosquito numbers are 
high following erratic summer rainfall (Bowen and Read 1998).
The other important biological control is the rabbit calicivirus disease which, 
following its escape from quarantine facilities on Wardang Island in 1995, has 
proved to be more effective in dry climates than myxomatosis (Bowen and Read

1998), particularly when rabbits are at medium to high densities; it is less effective 
when rabbits are at low densities (Sharp et al. 2001). Australia currently has only 
one strain of calicivirus, which is relatively stable, and rabbits are developing 
genetic resistance to infection; research is being undertaken to identify new field 
strains to release. Other more traditional methods can be effective at the localised 
level, or when used in conjunction with biocontrol, including poisoning with 1080, 
fumigation of warrens, mechanical destruction of warrens and above-ground shel-
ters, trapping and shooting.
Horse (Equus caballus) and Donkey (Equus asinus)
Origin
Prior to motorised transport, horses were the primary form of transport; they arrived 
in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 (Dobbie et al. 1993). Further shipments of 
working horses from Europe and other parts of the world followed, and settlers soon 
began to breed local herds for personal transport and as work horses, including to 
haul coaches, sulkies and drays and to work on farms and in the bush hauling 
ploughs and timber. Horses were vital to the expansion of farming and pastoralism 
into the arid and semi-arid zones, being used to transport people and equipment and 
for mustering stock. Horses were also crucial for transport and as beasts of burden 
in times of war, and tens of thousands were bred for war service, including the 
iconic ‘Walers’, specially bred horses used by Australian light horse regiments in 
the Middle East campaign during World War I (Yarwood 1989). It is estimated that 
8 million horses died on the Western front alone during World War I (Trueman 
2015). At the end of the war and with the increased use of motorised transport, many 
‘Walers’ were released into the bush, adding to the existing feral population. Even 
after the advent of motorised transport, horses continued to be used for mustering 
stock on outback pastoral properties until recent times. Today, most mustering is 
done using helicopters, motorbikes and ‘buggies’, although some pastoralists still 
prefer to use horses in combination with machines. As machines replaced horses, 
thousands of horses were released into the bush or were simply left in the bush and 
established feral herds.
Unlike camels, horses need to drink regularly, so the distribution of feral horses 
throughout the arid and semi-arid regions is limited by availability of either artificial 
watering points or permanent water in river pools, gorges and wetlands. Today, 
there are about 400,000 feral horses in Australia, making it the largest feral horse 
population in the world (Dawson et al. 2006). Most of these occur in the semi-arid 
and arid regions (Fig. 5, Plates 6 and 7).
Donkeys first arrived in Australia as early as 1793 for use as pack and haulage 
animals, but it wasn’t until after the 1860s that they became more widely used as 
pack animals in the arid and semi-arid regions of South Australia and Western

Australia (Bough 2006). They were imported from a number of countries including 
Spain, Mexico and parts of Asia, but most came from India (Walker 1973). In arid 
environments, donkeys were considered to be superior to horses and bullocks, 
because, being smaller, they ate less, were strong and hardy and could survive better 
on the natural vegetation (Kennedy 1992). They were particularly useful in the 
Kimberley in Western Australia and in the Victoria River region in the Northern 
Territory, where a toxic native plant (Crotalaria crispata) killed and sickened 
horses, but did not affect donkeys (McKnight 1976). In the late nineteenth century, 
during the Western Australian gold rush and the opening up of the arid rangelands 
for pastoralism, donkeys proved invaluable, with large teams used to haul stores, 
wool and other materials (Bough 2006 citing Long 2003). As with horses, donkeys 
were used as transport, haulage and pack animals in war including World Wars I and 
II. The feats of the Australian stretcher bearer Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick and 
his donkey during the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I are legendary (Cochrane 
1992).
As with camels and horses, motorised transport replaced donkeys throughout the 
early 1900s, and donkeys were released into the bush. Provided they had access to

water such as artificial watering points, river pools or wetlands, they not only thrived 
in the wild but quickly multiplied. Bough (2006) provides an example of where a 
team of 60 donkeys was released in the McArthur River area of the Northern 
Territory in 1936 and increased to about 1500 within 6 decades. Choquenot (1990) 
reports that a feral donkey population in the Northern Territory increased by 23–25% 
annually. Significant numbers of feral herds were first reported in the 1920s, and by 
1949, the donkey, an animal once highly valued, was officially declared a pest ani-
mal in Western Australia. It is estimated that today there are between 2 million and 
5 million feral donkeys in Australia (Department of the Environment and Heritage 
2004; Choquenot 2008), but there have been few systematic, nationwide surveys, so 
such estimates are unreliable. In 1964 the Western Australian government estimated 
that at least 100,000 roamed the eastern half of the Kimberley (Bough 2006). 
Relatively recent aerial surveys in the Northern territory estimate feral horse and 
donkey populations of 265,000 and 165,000, respectively (Edwards et al. 2004a, b), 
and given that a significant but unknown proportion of these animals are in the 
Northern Territory, an estimated population of 5 million donkeys would seem very 
high (Fig. 6, Plates 8 and 9).

Impacts
Provided they have access to water, feral horses and donkeys can inhabit a variety 
of land forms and vegetation types throughout the semi-arid and arid zones, although 
their distribution is patchy (Dobbie et al. 1993; Choquenot 1990). They are capable 
of interfering with farming and pastoral operations by competing with stock for 
food, fouling water holes, damaging fences, interfering with mustering operations 
and potentially carrying exotic diseases. A review by Nimmo and Miller (2007) 
found that the documented environmental effects of feral horses include soil loss, 
compaction and erosion; trampling of vegetation; reducing plant species richness; 
inducing mortality of native trees through bark chewing; damage to bog habitat; 
damage to water bodies; facilitation of weed invasion; and altering community 
composition of birds, fish, crabs, small mammals and reptiles. Despite these obser-
vations, the specific ecological effects of feral horses at various densities are poorly 
known (Dobbie et al. 1993; Nimmo and Miller 2007). Similarly, the extent of dam-
age caused by feral donkeys has not been well documented (Bough 2006), although, 
given the somewhat similar ecology of the species, the impacts could be expected to 
be similar. It is likely that feral donkeys and horses per se are no more or less dam-
aging to the environment than domestic stock, but their added numbers on pastoral 
properties add to total grazing pressure and associated impacts. In the conservation

estate where the aim is to protect wildlife values by excluding exotic herbivores, 
they could become serious environmental pests capable of degrading soils, vegeta-
tion and habitat and introducing weeds. Because of a dearth of studies, the relation-
ship between the density of feral horses and donkeys and potential environmental 
damage they may inflict in particular land systems has not been well established. In 
one of the few published accounts of the impact of feral horses on native fauna, 
Matthews et al. (2001) reported that a population of black-footed rock-wallabies in 
the Finke George National Park near Alice Springs increased significantly after feral 
horses were removed.
Control
In the arid and semi-arid regions away from artificial watering points, drought has a 
significant impact on populations of feral horses and donkeys. Where they have 
access to water, trapping, mustering and aerial shooting from helicopter are the 
most effective methods for humanely controlling them over large areas (Dobbie 
et al. 1993). Research into fertility control has been underway for several decades 
(Turner et al. 2001), and despite some promising results (Killian et al. 2004), there 
is no proven cost-effective method, so aerial shooting remains the preferred option.

354
For example, over the period 1978–1987, 180,000 donkeys were shot in the 
Kimberley region, and between 1981 and 1984, 83,000 were shot in the Victoria 
River area (Choquenot 2008). However, in the absence of ongoing control, numbers 
can quickly return to previous levels (Freeland and Choquenot 1990).
Given the long economic, cultural and social association between humans and 
animals such as horses and donkeys, it is not surprising that the culling of these 
animals is highly contentious and can arouse deep emotions. There is the added 
concern by some that in jurisdictions where these animals have been declared pests, 
they are not protected by the same animal welfare legislation that is afforded other 
non-pest animals (Bough 2006; Nimmo and Miller 2007).
Wild Canids: Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Wild Dog (Dingo, Canis 
lupus dingo and Feral Domestic Dog, C. l. familiaris)
Origins
Dingoes (C. l. dingo) were transported to Australia by indigenous people around 
3500–4000 years ago, most likely from New Guinea or Indonesia (Gollan 1984; 
Corbett 1995; McNiven and Hitchcock 2005). While they were initially a compan-
ion and hunting animal, feral packs quickly developed and spread across the 
Australian mainland, occurring in a wide diversity of habitats. Domestic dogs (C. l. 
familiaris) arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 and feral domestic dogs and hybrids 
with dingoes have been present since this time (Fleming et al. 2001; Corbett 1995). 
Dingoes, feral domestic dogs and hybrids are collectively referred to here as ‘wild 
dogs’ on the basis that their ecology in the wild, including their impacts on eco-
nomic and environmental values, and their control, is undifferentiated. Hybridisation 
has resulted in a lower proportion of pure dingoes, especially in south-western and 
south-eastern Australia, where wild dogs are mostly hybrids or feral domestic dogs 
(Newsome and Corbett 1982; Jones 2009; Stephens et al. 2015). However, in the 
semi-arid and arid regions of the continent, and away from human settlements, there 
remains a high proportion of pure dingoes in the wild dog population (Newsome 
and Corbett 1985).
Wild dogs are widely distributed throughout the country and are present in most 
environments. They are mostly nocturnal, highly mobile and elusive, making it dif-
ficult to estimate their actual numbers. For this reason, indirect measures such as 
track counting, measuring frequency of visits to bait stations or trail cameras and 
aerial sightings are used to estimate relative population density and changes in pop-
ulation such as before and after control measures (Allen et al. 1996; Fleming et al. 
2001; Burrows et al. 2003). Estimates of population density in New South Wales, 
for example, range from 0.1 to 0.3 wild dogs per square kilometre (Fleming et al. 
2001), but this will vary greatly across the continent depending on control programs 
and prey availability (Fig. 7, Plate 10).

The European red fox was introduced to Victoria from England for recreational 
hunting in the 1860s and 1870s (Saunders et al. 1995). It spread rapidly, and by the 
turn of the century, it was so widespread and common that some shires in Victoria 
and South Australia declared it a pest and were offering bounties. The fox was in 
New South Wales by 1893, South Australia by 1901, Southern Queensland by 1907 
and Western Australia by 1912 (Saunders et al. 1995). This rapid spread, including 
across the Nullarbor, was aided by human dispersal and the spread of rabbits, a 
primary prey item. Today, foxes occur across most of Australia except the tropical 
north and some offshore islands (Long 1988; Saunders et al. 1995). Until recently, 
Tasmania was thought to be free of foxes but in response to some evidence of a low 
density of foxes, detection and eradication efforts began there in 2002 (Saunders 
et al. 2006). However, the presence of foxes in Tasmania is controversial with some 
suggesting that the evidence may have been an elaborate hoax.
The fox is a highly successful coloniser, an opportunistic predator and scavenger 
and is able to survive in a wide range of habitats including arid and semi-arid 
Australia (Corbet and Harris 1991; Catling and Coman 2008). Its northern distribu-
tion is similar to the distribution of rabbits, although there is some evidence that its 
distribution and density may be affected by the presence of dingoes (Saunders et al. 
Fig. 7  The distribution of dingoes and wild dogs (hybrids) (blue) (Adapted from Van Dyk and 
Strahan 2008). The black line circumscribes the arid zone

356
1995). As with many predators, it is difficult to determine the actual population of 
foxes, because they are mostly nocturnal and elusive, so the actual number of foxes 
in the semi-arid and arid regions is unknown. The author is familiar with an eradica-
tion program on the Peron Peninsula in the semi-arid Sharp Bay region of Western 
Australia conducted in the mid-1990s which removed an estimated 1000 foxes from 
an area of 1000 km2, equivalent to a fox density of one animal per km2. This was 
thought to be a high density for this environment, but the area also supports a high 
density of rabbits, and it has been well established that rabbits are the staple diet of 
foxes in semi-arid pastoral and farming regions (Brooker 1977). Clearly, in the 
absence of control measures, fox density will depend on food availability and com-
petition from other meso-predators. The limited data available suggest fox densities 
of 1–2 animals km−2 in the more productive regions of the semi-arid pastoral and 
farming region (Newsome and Catling 1992). In arid central Australia, fox density 
is generally low but is temporally and spatially variable. Following good seasons, 
fox density increases as prey increases, and density is usually higher around playa 
lakes, riparian zones, breakaways and other more productive systems in the land-
scape that provide refugial habitat for rabbits and other prey species. In a prolonged 
drought, foxes were absent or at undetectably low levels in the Gibson Desert in 
Western Australia, suggesting their presence or absence in the arid interior beyond 
the pastoral zone depends on rainfall, which drives prey abundance (Burrows et al. 
Plate 10  (Photo Neil Burrows)

2003). A crude estimate based on limited density data suggests the Australian fox 
population is about 7.2 million (McLeod 2004) (Fig. 8).
Impacts
Wild dogs have harassed and killed stock including sheep, goats, cattle and other 
stocks since European settlement. Today, they continue to do so, having a signifi-
cant economic impact on farming and pastoralism, including in the semi-arid and 
arid regions of Australia (Fleming et al. 2001; Allen and West 2013). Table 1 sum-
marises estimated annual costs to sheep and cattle producers being $66.3 million 
per annum (McLeod 2004). This is an underestimate of the total economic cost, 
because it does not consider other agricultural industries. For example, there is 
anecdotal evidence that wild dogs have significantly impacted rangeland goat oper-
ations in the Gascoyne and Murchison regions of Western Australia.
In terms of environmental impact, the dingo is suspected of causing the extinc-
tion of at least three native species on the mainland, being the thylacine (Thylacinus

cynocephalus), the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the Tasmanian native 
hen (Gallinula mortierii) (Corbett 1995), although this has been questioned 
(Johnson and Wroe 2003). While it is known that wild dogs prey on a range of 
native wildlife, including the large macropods, it is unclear to what extent this 
impacts on the sustainability of populations of native species today. Unlike other 
introduced species, dingoes arrived a very long time ago and became a ‘natural’ part 
of the ecology of semi-arid and arid Australia. However, together with the more 
recent arrival of other introduced predators (foxes and cats), the cumulative effect of 
predation and other perturbations may be taking a toll on wildlife, especially rem-
nant or isolated populations of endangered fauna (e.g. Robertshaw and Harden 
1986).
There is currently debate about whether the negative impacts of wild dogs on 
native fauna are offset by their suppressive effect on the other introduced predators, 
the fox and feral cat. It has been argued that, consistent with meso-predator release 
theory, controlling or eradicating wild dogs results in an increase in populations of 
foxes and feral cats, therefore an increase in predation pressure on native species 
(Johnson 2006; Dickman et al. 2009). However, there is little scientific evidence to 
support this proposition (Allen et al. 2014). On the other hand, there is evidence that 
wild dogs can reduce populations of other pests including feral goats, rabbits and 
introduced rodents, especially during drought periods (Corbett and Newsome 1987).
After the wild dog, the fox is the largest terrestrial predator in mainland Australia, 
and predation by foxes has significant economic and environmental impacts. The 
main economic impact is on sheep farming where lambing losses due to foxes are 
estimated at about 2%, but in some areas it is as high as 30% (Lugton 1993), amount-
ing to an estimated economic loss of $17.5 million per annum (McLeod 2004). 
Since its introduction, the fox has long been implicated in the decline of native 
fauna (e.g. Christensen 1980). Australia’s semi-arid and arid zones have the highest 
rate of modern declines and extinctions in native fauna in the world, and predation 
by foxes and feral cats is implicated in the decline and extinction of about 33% of 
all arid zone mammals and about 90% of medium-sized mammals (Burbidge and 
McKenzie 1989; McKenzie et al. 2006). The fox is also a threat to many native 
ground-nesting birds such as the mallee fowl and night parrot and reptiles such as 
the green turtle (Saunders et al. 1995) and a serious impediment to native fauna

reintroductions (Kinnear et al. 2002). Consequently, it is listed as a key threatening 
process under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act). Under the EPBC Act, the Australian gov-
ernment, in consultation with the states and territories, has developed the Threat 
Abatement Plan for Predation by the European Red Fox (DEWHA 2008b). Of the 
threatened species listed under the EPBC Act, foxes are considered a threat to 14 
species of birds, 48 mammals, 12 reptiles and 2 amphibians, with the orange-bellied 
parrot (Neophema chrysogaster), spotted quail-thrush (Cinclosoma punctatum), 
herald petrel (Pterodroma heraldica), Gilbert’s potoroo (Potorous gilbertii) and 
western swamp tortoise (Pseudemydura umbrina) listed as critically endangered 
(DEWHA 2008b).
There are a number of well-documented cases where fox removal in various 
locations in Western Australia has resulted in population increases of endangered 
native mammals, many of which once occupied the arid zone. These include rock-­
wallabies (Petrogale lateralis and P. rothschildi), woylie (Bettongia penicillata), 
tammar (Macrotis eugenii), numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), brushtail possum 
(Trichosurus vulpecula) and quenda (Isoodon obesulus) (Christensen 1980; Kinnear 
et  al. 1988; Kinnear et  al. 2002; Friend 1990; Burrows and Christensen 2002; 
Possingham et al. 2004). In New South Wales, fox control increased survival of the 
endangered and iconic semi-arid bird zone the mallee fowl (Leipoa ocellata) 
(Priddel and Wheeler 1990).
The fox could also act as a carrier of rabies, should the disease be accidentally 
introduced into Australia. Rabies mostly affects members of the dog family but can 
also be passed on to humans, livestock and native mammals (Saunders et al. 1995).
Control
Given their distribution over such a vast area of Australia, and limited resources of 
landholders and land managers, eradication of wild dogs and foxes from the conti-
nent is not feasible, although localised eradication is. Neither bounties nor hunting 
have had a broad-scale, lasting impact on these canids, although there is anecdotal 
evidence that intense localised hunting and trapping can have an impact. However, 
such methods are expensive and labour-intensive, require ongoing effort and are 
only effective in limited areas (Saunders and McLeod 2007). Barrier fencing has 
long been a means of controlling the insurgence of pest animals into agricultural 
areas in Australia. The earliest substantial barrier fence, the No. 1 rabbit-proof 
fence, was constructed through Western Australia’s arid zone in 1907 to prevent the 
rabbit invasion from the east. Since then more than 10,000 km of barrier fencing 
have been constructed in various parts of the country, including to prevent incur-
sions by wild dogs (Broomhall 1991). From anecdotal evidence and surveys of pas-
toralists, there is general agreement that barrier fencing, in combination with other 
control measures such as trapping and poisoning, can have economic benefits. 
Feral Animals in the Semi-arid and Arid Regions of Australia: Origins, Impacts…

360
However, the construction and maintenance of barrier fencing is costly, and fences 
can interrupt the migration of native fauna including kangaroos and emus.
Well-constructed predator-proof fenced exclosures can be effective for protect-
ing conservation values such as threatened fauna, and a number of these have been 
built in the semi-arid and arid zones in recent times. They are also expensive but 
could be justified to protect high conservation values (Bode et al. 2012). In some 
regions, poison baiting of canids has been successful in reducing predation pressure 
on native fauna. In south-western Australia, ongoing regular broad-area aerial bait-
ing with 1080 poison baits targeting foxes (Western Shield) has resulted in the suc-
cessful recovery of a number of native mammal species (Kinnear et  al. 2002; 
Armstrong 2004). Burrows et al. (2003) reported virtual eradication of foxes and 
wild dogs for up to 15 months following aerial baiting with 1080 poison baits of a 
1600 km2 area of the Gibson Desert during a drought period. The effectiveness of 
broad-area aerial baiting to control wild dogs is variable and depends on availability 
of alternative food sources but is generally regarded as cost-effective (Thomson 
1986).
The appeal of 1080 as a pesticide is that, in regions of Australia such as South 
West Australia, it is a naturally occurring chemical in a number of native plant spe-
cies (‘poison’ plants), particularly Gastrolobium spp. and Oxylobium spp. Native 
fauna that have co-evolved with these plants show a high resistance to the toxin 
compared with animals that have not, such as dogs, foxes and cats (King et al. 1978; 
Twigg et al. 2003). However, caution must be used because there are regions of arid 
Australia where native fauna have not co-evolved with these plants, and conse-
quently, their resistance to 1080 is relatively low (Twigg and King 1991; Twigg 
et al. 2003; Twigg 2014). Risk to nontarget animals, including small mammals and 
birds, can be minimised by using a bait medium that is non-palatable to nontargets, 
reducing the level of toxin in the baits, reducing baiting density or placing the baits 
away from habitats used by susceptible animals (McIlroy et al. 1968). The animal 
welfare impacts of 1080 poisoning is of concern, but because the toxin acts by inter-
rupting neurological function, it is difficult to know the extent to which animals 
actually feel pain (Twigg and Parker 2010). To mitigate potential suffering, there 
has been some experimentation using analgesics such as diazepam in 1080 baits. 
This reduced the level of anxiety in foxes that had taken baits but extended the time 
to death (Marks et al. 2009). Further research to better understand the effect of 1080 
on target and nontarget animals and to improve the humaneness of 1080 baiting is 
warranted, especially in those regions where native fauna has not co-evolved with 
‘poison’ plants.
Preventing the introduction of foxes to new areas, such as islands, is a high prior-
ity. Islands are often refuges for native animals no longer found on the mainland. 
Fertility control through immunocontraception has been investigated as means of 
fox control (Bradley 1994; Bradley et al. 1998), as has chemical fertility control 
(Marks et al. 1996), but neither technique is sufficiently developed to be safely used 
as a routine control measure.
Despite adverse impact on the livestock industry, there are growing efforts to 
preserve pure dingoes. Under some state and territory legislations, dingoes are

361
­conserved and protected as a native species in areas where they pose no threat to 
livestock. The greatest threat to dingoes is hybridisation with feral domestic dogs, 
and it has been suggested that pure dingoes may become extinct by 2100 (Fleming 
et al. 2001).
Cat (Felis catus)
Origin
Cats first arrived in Australia with European settlers from about 1824 to 1886, and 
being companion animals, they were present wherever Europeans settled. Cats were 
feral on Macquarie Island by 1820, only 10 years after the island was discovered by 
sealers (Brothers et al. 1985). There was likely almost immediate ‘leakage’ of pet 
cats from settlements into the wild, establishing feral populations that spread further 
into the bush. As well as being kept as pets, large numbers of cats were used as a 
biological control agent and released into the wild in Victoria and South Australia in 
the 1880s and in Western Australia on the Nullarbor Plain near Eucla in 1898 to 
control rabbits (Rolls 1969; Abbott 2008). By about 1900, the continent was entirely 
colonised by feral cats (Abbott 2002; Abbott et al. 2014). While it is difficult to reli-
ably census feral cats, it is estimated that today there are about 18 million in Australia 
distributed through all habitats (except some of the wettest rainforests) in mainland 
Australia and Tasmania and on many offshore islands (Pimental et  al. 2001; 
DEWHA 2008c citing McLeod 2004).
Being well adapted to arid environments, cats thrive in the semi-arid and arid 
regions of Australia. Their success as an invasive carnivore is due to their size, 
physiology, athleticism and fecundity. They are highly efficient hunters, being able 
to take prey species almost up to their own body weight; they prey on ground-­
dwelling species as well as arboreal animals; they eat a wide range of prey including 
insects, reptiles, birds and mammals (Jones and Coman 1981; Paltridge et al. 1997); 
and they do not need to drink water, obtaining sufficient moisture from their prey. 
Females can breed as early as 8-month-old and in good seasons and can have two 
litters per year, allowing rapid increases in population (Jones and Coman 1982). In 
the arid and semi-arid regions, based on limited data, cat density estimates vary 
depending on seasonal fluctuations of food supply (prey availability). For example, 
during prolonged drought, densities in the Gibson Desert were about 0.05 animals 
per km2
, but following good seasons (rainfall), this increased to 0.13 per km2 
(Christensen and Burrows 1995). On the other hand, in the Shark Bay area of 
Western Australia with a high density of rabbits, Short and Turner (2005) reported 
a cat density of 2.8 animals per km2 (Fig. 9, Plate 11).

Impacts
The main impact of feral cats is on wildlife conservation rather than agricultural 
economic values. Cats have direct impacts on native fauna through predation but 
can have an indirect effect by carrying and transmitting diseases such as toxoplas-
mosis (Dickman 1996). The predatory impact of cats on native wildlife was raised 
as a concern by early naturalists, including McKeown, who in 1922, observed, ‘that 
cats do not appear to be having an impact on rabbits, but together with the fox, they 
were “exterminating” ground-birds and other species’.
The extent to which the feral cat has been the primary cause of declines of native 
fauna after European settlement is poorly documented and controversial (Dickman 
1996; Abbot et al. 2014), largely because of confounding influences of other factors 
such as foxes, altered fire regimes and disease. However, feral cats have been 
strongly implicated in the extinction of up to seven species of mainland mammals 
as well as regional and island extinctions of native mammals and birds (Denny and 
Dickman 2010; Abbot et al. 2014). It is well documented that feral cats have caused 
the failure of many endangered fauna reintroduction attempts in the semi-arid and 
Fig. 9  The distribution of feral cats (Adapted from Van Dyk and Strahan 2008). The black line 
circumscribes the arid zone

363
arid zones (Short 2016), and they are recognised as the main barrier to reconstruct-
ing and protecting faunal assemblages in these environments (Christensen and 
Burrows 1995). If there is doubt about the impact of feral cats as agents of decline 
and extinction of native fauna, then rather than wait for definitive proof, the prudent 
response is to assume the cat is guilty until proven innocent.
Today, 35 vulnerable and endangered bird species, 36 mammal species, 7 reptile 
species and 3 amphibian species are thought to be adversely affected by feral cats 
(Denny and Dickman 2010). While there is debate about the role of cats in faunal 
extinctions, there is no doubt they are proficient hunters of Australian wildlife. For 
this reason, legislation has been introduced to many jurisdictions that aims to restrict 
the breeding and predation potential of domestic cats and to restrict the number of 
domestic cats becoming feral cats in peri-urban areas. Predation by feral cats was 
listed as a key threatening process under the Federal Endangered Species Protection 
Act 1992 (incorporated in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 
Act 1999). A Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats was produced in 
1999 and amended in 2008 to promote the recovery of vulnerable and endangered 
native species and threatened ecological communities (Environment Australia 1999; 
DEWHA 2008c). It should be noted that in the absence of traditional prey species 
that have declined or become extinct since European settlement, desert Aboriginal 
people hunt feral cats (and rabbits) as a food source, so do not necessarily see them 
as a harmful pest.

Control
Feral cats have colonised the vast and remote semi-arid and arid regions of Australia. 
This, together with their evasive and largely nocturnal behaviour, and their popular-
ity as a companion animal, makes eradication of this harmful pest unachievable on 
the mainland. There have been successful eradication programs on a number of 
offshore islands, where the area is relatively small, and there is no ability for reinva-
sion (Algar et al. 2002). However, on the mainland, the focus of conservation and 
land management agencies is to mitigate the harmful impacts of feral cats in and 
around targeted high-priority, high conservation values. Most common control or 
‘predation-mitigation’ methods include trapping, shooting, poisoning and fenced 
exclosures. Biological control including immunocontraception, gene drive technol-
ogy and the introduction of infectious diseases is technically, operationally and ethi-
cally not feasible at the moment (Bradley 1994). Trapping can be very effective for 
removing animals from a relatively confined area but is not feasible as a broad-area 
control measure. Not only is it labour-intensive, trapping risks harming nontarget 
species, especially if traps are set on the ground. Shooting is equally ineffective, 
because of the relatively low density of feral cats in arid environments and because 
of their evasive nature. Well-designed cat-proof fenced exclosures can be very 
effective at protecting native animals from predation, essentially creating ‘inland 
islands’, or refugia (Somers and Hayward (eds.) 2012; Dickman 2012). Construction 
and maintenance costs limit the number and size of enclosures that can be built, but 
where they exist in the arid zone, they have been very successful. There is likely to 
be an increase in the use of enclosures to provide refugia for threatened arid zone 
fauna into the future.
Baiting using 1080 poison has shown most promise as a method for broad-area 
control of feral cats (and other introduced predators) (Algar and Burrows 2004). 
Following the development of a novel cat bait medium, broad-area aerial baiting 
using the toxin 1080 is now routinely used in targeted areas of the semi-arid and arid 
regions of Western Australia where there are high conservation values at risk of 
predation (Algar and Burrows 2004). Feral cats are reluctant to scavenge, preferring 
live prey. However, there are periods when live prey abundance is low, increasing 
famine pressure on feral cats. Shortage of prey usually coincides with cold, dry 
weather, and operational trials in Western Australian deserts have demonstrated that 
this is the optimal time to deliver cat baits (Algar and Burrows 2004; Algar et al. 
2007). The window of opportunity for effective control by baiting is relatively nar-
row, and the effectiveness of baiting has been variable. Based on a track count index 
(Burrows et al. 2003) and occasional radio tagging of animals before and after bait-
ing, baiting efficacy (knock-down of the pre-bait population) can range from about 
25% to almost 80% (Algar and Burrows 2004). Trials in arid Western Australia 
using biomarkers have shown that there are a few native species including reptiles 
that will consume cat baits. These species have a high resistance to 1080 (Twigg 
et al. 2003; Twigg 2014). Carnivorous marsupials such as mulgara (Dasycercus 
N. D. Burrows

365
cristicauda) consume the cat baits, but the benefit of reduced cat predation due to 
baiting has resulted in a net increase in their numbers (Hamilton et al. 2010).
Conclusion
Following European settlement, Australia experienced an invasion of exotic animals 
deliberately introduced for transport, livestock, as companion animals or for recre-
ational hunting. Many of these became feral pests and quickly spread across the 
continent, occupying a diversity of habitats including the semi-arid and arid regions. 
In an environment naïve to their ecology, they have caused and continue to cause 
substantial adverse economic and environmental damage. For the most part, total 
eradication of feral animals is not feasible, so landholders should aim to manage 
populations at various spatial and temporal scales to reduce the damage they cause 
to values. The extent of damage is largely a function of the density of the offending 
feral animal species, and control measures are usually expensive. In order to man-
age feral animals in a cost-effective manner that reduces impact on values, it is 
necessary to understand and quantify the relationships between densities of feral 
animals and the damage they cause – simply killing feral animals will be expensive 
but will not necessarily deliver a beneficial economic or environmental outcome.
There are a number of control methods available for feral animals including con-
ventional control techniques and, since the 1950s, biological control (Saunders 
et al. 2010). Many of these pest feral animals were at one time, highly valuable to 
humans, and in today’s society, there still exist strong bonds and cultural associa-
tions with these animals, especially those that were used for transport such as horses, 
donkeys and camels (e.g. Decker et al. 2001; Nimmo and Miller 2007). This senti-
ment is summed up by Walker (1973) who wrote:
It seems a tragic reflection on Man and his sense of values that animals that were once 
invaluable – who played such a vital part in the opening up of this great country – should, 
in a generation or two, be thought of as vermin and hunted down in their thousands to be 
killed for the bounty paid on their ears or as pet meat.
As well as being sensitive to these cultural associations with what are now pest 
feral animals, control programs must comply with the animal welfare standards 
enshrined in legislation in all states. Aside from legal obligations, there is a com-
munity expectation that all animals, including pests, are to be treated humanely. 
Therefore, animal welfare issues must be an important consideration when planning 
feral animal control programs. However, there is often tension between conserva-
tion ecology, which focusses on the survival and persistence of populations, species 
and ecological communities and animal welfare, which focusses on the welfare of 
individual animals. In the words of environmental philosopher Mark Sagoff (1984); 
‘Environmentalists cannot be animal liberationists. Animal liberationists cannot be 
environmentalists. The environmentalist would sacrifice the lives of individual crea-
tures to preserve the authenticity, integrity and complexity of ecological systems. 
Feral Animals in the Semi-arid and Arid Regions of Australia: Origins, Impacts…

The liberationist - if the reduction of animal misery is taken seriously as a goal - 
must be willing, in principle, to sacrifice the authenticity, integrity and complexity 
of ecosystems to protect the rights, or guard the lives, of individual animals’. The 
control of pest animals to achieve environmental and biodiversity benefits brings 
this philosophical conflict into sharp focus. The role of science is to inform the 
debate; ultimately, societies and their governments will determine the outcome.

Introduction
On the broadest scale, Australia’s climate can be divided into four classifications:
•	 Summer rain dominant. This covers the tropical north of the continent where 
most rain comes from warm season weather and climate systems such as the 
Australian Monsoon and tropical cyclones.
•	 Winter rain dominant. This covers much of southern, and especially south-­
western, Australia. Weather and climate systems are mostly midlatitude in origin 
and defined by the interplay between midlatitude low-pressure systems and the 
intervening high-pressure cells of the subtropical ridge.
•	 Even rain distribution through the year – on average at least. This covers much 
of eastern Australia, where rainfall can be significant in both winter and summer. 
Interannual rainfall variability can be high, driven largely by El Niño/Southern 
Oscillation events in the Pacific Ocean. Smaller-scale analogous events in the 
tropical Indian Ocean (Indian Ocean Dipole) can be significant rain sources as 
well.
•	 Arid zone, where rainfall is low on average and where significant rain events are 
often few and far apart. This covers most of the inland and represents approxi-
mately half the land area of Australia. Many of the major rain events in this 
region usually originate in tropical weather systems, such as northwest cloud 
bands or tropical cyclones.
For the first three classifications, seasonal and annual rainfall totals increase with 
proximity to the coast. Each of these classifications can be subdivided further, but 
the broad zones are evident, as shown in Fig. 1.

The Australian continent is surrounded by three major oceans – Pacific, Indian 
and Southern – and each basin influences Australian climate in its own way. These 
are variously described as climate influences, climate phenomena or climate drivers 
and reflect typical or recurring modes of variability in the climate dynamics of these 
basins. Each driver affects climate variability by amplifying or supressing the fre-
quency of occurrence of weather systems as they change through the annual cycle.
The annual cycle represents the shift in seasons arising from the tilt in the Earth’s 
axis and the resulting movement of regions’ maximum solar heating. The first mani-
festation is a progression of temperatures from winter through summer and back 
again. Weather systems associated with the annual shift in heating therefore also 
occur seasonally. As Australia occupies a range of latitudes from approximately 
10°S to 40°S, its climate is split between two major centres of action. Northern 
Australia is dominated by tropical weather systems, brought seasonally in summer 
via the Australian monsoon (Bureau of Meteorology 2008a). Southern Australia’s 
climate is dominated by midlatitude low-pressure systems as they extend north-
wards in winter. The south also sits under the prevailing subtropical ridge, whose 
strength and latitude strongly affect rainfall opportunities (Bureau of Meteorology 
2008b). While seasonal rainfall distribution is opposite (i.e. winter-dominant rain vs 
summer-dominant rain), the centres of action share a common attribute of relatively 
low interannual rainfall variability. In contrast, most of inland Australia, located 
between these centres, has very high interannual rainfall variability (Fig. 2).

Meteorology, http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/climate-classifications)

Mean annual rainfall is generally low (less than 300 mm), because the subtropi-
cal ridge is the dominant weather system over inland Australia, and the region is far 
from sources of moisture. Heaviest rain events tend to occur in summer, because 
tropical incursions are usually the only mechanism to transport a large amount of 
water vapour into the inland. Periods of low or no rainfall can extend for many 
months. The subtropical ridge is an extensive band of high pressure that encircles 
the globe at middle latitudes (Bureau of Meteorology 2008b). The position of the 
ridge varies with the seasons, allowing cold fronts to pass over southern Australia in 
winter but pushing them south of the continent in summer. Conditions along the 
ridge tend to be stable and dry. Consequently, southern Australia is characterised by 
dry, hot summers, and winter rainfall occurs mostly with frontal systems (Bureau of 
Meteorology 2007).
In summer, southward movement of solar heating promotes persistent low pres-
sure over northern Australia. This draws moisture from nearby tropical oceans into 
the Australian summer monsoon. The monsoon can be in either an ‘active phase’, 
characterised by stronger winds and rain, or an ‘inactive phase’, characterised by 
lighter winds and less rain. These intra-seasonal phases are associated with passage 
of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events (Bureau of Meteorology 2012). Tropical 
cyclones and monsoon depressions (essentially the same type of system, though 
differing in intensity) usually form during active phases. Southward tracking of 
these weather systems and movement of the monsoon trough itself are major sources 
of significant rain events over inland Australia. As potential evaporation is very high

over arid Australia in summer, rainfall events must be heavy to be effective in accu-
mulating soil water and consequently promoting plant growth. Continuous periods 
of stored soil water are vital and are often a better indication of plant growth than 
monthly or seasonal rainfall totals.
Climate influences are themselves modulated by even larger-scale climate events 
occurring in the ocean basins around the continent. The most prominent impact 
comes from El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. These occur basin-wide 
across the Pacific Ocean at approximately 3–8-year intervals. ENSO events are usu-
ally a coupled phenomenon, where spatial changes in ocean temperatures (El Niño 
and its opposite phase La Niña) interact with tropical winds and clouds to induce 
large changes in atmospheric pressure across the basin (Southern Oscillation). 
There is also a neutral phase of ENSO, when neither El Niño nor La Niña is occur-
ring. Spatial patterns of sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure anoma-
lies are often weak in this phase. Extensive literature exists on ENSO, and readers 
are referred to Bureau of Meteorology (2008c) for an overview.
In general, El Niño events suppress the onset and intensity of the Australian 
monsoon and also of tropical cyclone activity. Tropical cyclones tend to occur fur-
ther away from the coast in El Niño years, and the number of coastal crossings is 
usually less. Opportunities for significant rain over the inland are therefore reduced. 
While the duration of El Niño events can vary, there is a typical cycle over an 
approximately 18-month period. A common pattern is for the event to develop dur-
ing the austral winter, reach a peak over spring and summer and decay in the austral 
autumn of the following year. This breakdown can bring heavy rain and floods over 
much of eastern Australia. Many major Australian droughts or periods of prolonged 
dry conditions are associated with El Niño events (Bureau of Meteorology 2014).
La Niña events tend to do the opposite; commonly enhancing the summer mon-
soon, which in turn usually spawns more tropical cyclones than normal. The times-
cale of occurrence is similar, with events developing in the austral winter and 
peaking over spring and summer. Individual El Niño and La Niña events follow 
their own development and decay timetables, as well as differing in peak intensity.
An analogous coupled event also occurs periodically in the tropical Indian 
Ocean. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined as a difference in sea surface 
temperatures in two regions across the western and eastern Indian Ocean. In its most 
developed form, there is also a coupled atmospheric response across the tropical 
Indian Ocean. Opposite phases of the phenomenon are more prosaically called 
IOD-negative or IOD-positive events.
IOD events develop during the austral winter and peak during spring, usually 
lasting some 4–6 months at most. They can act to either enhance (IOD-negative) or 
suppress (IOD-positive) rainfall over central and eastern Australia during winter 
and spring. Notable IOD-negative events in 2010 and 2016 brought record seasonal 
rains to much of Australia. Driven by warming ocean temperatures around Indonesia, 
northwest cloud bands and other tropical moisture inflow can interact with low-­
pressure systems over southern Australia to bring rainfall inland (Bureau of 
Meteorology 2016a).
I. Foster

379
ENSO and IOD events can occur individually in any one year, or in combination 
to either reinforce or cancel out impacts on rainfall. The resulting time series of 
seasonal rainfall across Australia is accordingly highly variable from year to year. 
As well as these two tropical modes of climate variability, there is also a southern 
higher-latitude mode just to complicate interactions further. This is the Southern 
Annular Mode (SAM) (Bureau of Meteorology 2008d), which describes the strength 
and latitudinal positioning of the string of alternating high- and low-pressure 
weather systems between Australia and Antarctica.
As with the IOD, SAM has positive and negative phases. When SAM is positive, 
the belt of strong westerly winds and low-pressure systems contracts towards the 
South Pole. This results in weaker than normal westerly winds and higher pressure 
over southern Australia. A negative SAM phase describes an equatorward expan-
sion of the belt of strong westerly winds. This results in more storm systems and 
lower pressure over southern Australia. These phases have different impacts on rain-
fall during the year. If SAM is positive, during autumn and winter, rainfall tends to 
be reduced over southern Australia, especially towards the coast. Conversely, a posi-
tive phase over spring in summer can bring more rain to the south-east and inland of 
Australia.
The frequency of weather systems that occur, and seasonal rainfall totals, is the 
result of interactions between the three major climate events discussed above. They 
can occur singly or in combination in any one year. Such complexity of interactions 
is one reason why global climate models are primary tools for investigating current 
and future climate.
Climate Change Modelling
At its most basic level, what is popularly called ‘global warming’ or ‘climate 
change’ is an amplification of a natural atmospheric process. Gases such as carbon 
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (as well as the wider family of chlorofluorocar-
bons) have major impacts on global temperature, despite being in relatively low 
concentrations in the atmosphere. They achieve this by strongly absorbing long-
wave radiation upwelling from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere and then reradi-
ating the energy in all directions. Most energy eventually exits the atmosphere by a 
process of radiative transfer, and some is radiated downwards. The resulting increase 
in longwave radiation reaching the surface increases its temperature until radiative 
equilibrium is reached with the incoming shortwave radiation from the Sun. This 
process occurs on an extreme level on Venus (closer to the Sun, with a thick absorb-
ing atmosphere), as well as to a small extent on Mars (further from the Sun and with 
a thin atmosphere).
The presence of absorbing gases (otherwise called greenhouse gases, GHG) 
keeps the Earth’s global mean temperature some 18 °C warmer than otherwise at 
present concentrations. The concentration of GHGs at any time is the result of a 
dynamic balance between sources of emission (such as respiration, combustion and 
Climate Change

380
geological processes) and extraction from the atmosphere into oceans and plants. 
Over geological timescales, gas concentrations and global temperatures have varied 
widely, driven by interactions between the Earth’s orbit, geology and the biosphere. 
More recently, additional GHGs, especially carbon dioxide, have accumulated in 
the atmosphere since the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1750s. The 
use of fossil fuels (such as coal and petroleum) adds an extra emission component 
to the carbon budget that has not been mitigated by matching extraction and seques-
tration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
To simulate how increasing atmospheric GHG concentrations may affect future 
climate, scenarios describing long-term economical and industrial development are 
used to provide trajectories of future concentrations of GHGs. Four scenarios of 
future emissions have been defined for use in simulations. They are called 
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and cover cases of high-, intermedi-
ate- and low-emission trajectories. Responses of global atmosphere and ocean pro-
cesses to these RCP options are simulated in Global Climate Models (GCMs) to 
assess possible impacts. GCMs simulate the physical relationships behind the major 
weather and climate features (as outlined in Introduction) and how they interact 
with the land and ocean. They are a major tool for understanding the dynamics and 
feedbacks of earth systems (i.e. integrating the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryo-
sphere and biosphere) and sensitivities of responses.
Modelling studies of climate change are commonly run as ensembles of multi-­
model simulations. This is to deal with uncertainties arising from the internal vari-
ability of the oceans and atmosphere and from limitations in the models’ ability to 
simulate all processes in sufficient detail. To account for this variability (or uncer-
tainty) among models, it is usual to present the results from a suite of models and 
present both the range of values and the median projection. Most of the variability 
in near-term climate simulations (e.g. up to 2020) results from differences among 
GCMs, rather than emission trajectories; however, differences in emission trajecto-
ries become increasingly important in determining medium- and longer-term (2050 
and 2070) climate responses (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2015). Differences 
in climate projections reported in the Fifth Assessment Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (providing the beloved acronym IPCC 
AR5) from previous reports largely stem from differences in the emission scenarios, 
rather than outputs from the GCMs.
Current Trends and Projections
Temperature: Current Trends
Between 1910 and 2015, average annual temperature increased by around 1 °C 
across most of the arid zone of Australia (Bureau of Meteorology 2016b State of the 
Climate 2016, Fig. 3).
I. Foster

381
While average annual temperatures have increased, changes in seasonal average 
temperatures have been mixed. Increased rainfall over northern Australia in summer 
has been responsible for a cooling trend in recent years. The number of hot days 
(defined as the number of days over 35 °C) has increased over much of the inland 
(Fig. 4).
While the numbers appear small, a trend of 0.2 days per year means an extra 
12 days with maxima above 35 °C in 2015 when compared with 1957. This type of 
statistic is important as an indicator of severe impacts from high temperatures. Risks 
of wildfire behaviour, heat stress on animals and water stress on plants are strongly 
elevated as temperature rises. A shift in mean temperature of 1 degree may seem 
innocuous (given diurnal changes will be commonly ten times greater) but can 
translate into a greatly increased frequency of extreme events.
The State of the Climate 2016 report has noted increasing frequency of extreme 
fire weather and a longer fire season over inland, southern and eastern Australia 
since the mid-1970s. This has been attributed to a broad trend of increasing tem-
peratures and decreasing rainfall, though in context of large interannual variability 
of the fire danger index.

Temperature: Future Projections
There is very high confidence in projections that average, maximum and minimum 
temperatures will continue to increase to the end of the century (Watterson et al. 
2015). Temperatures increase for all emission scenarios but are greater for higher 
emission scenarios, with a high level of agreement between global climate models. 
Average annual temperature across central Australia is projected to increase by 0.6–
1.4 °C by 2030 under intermediate- and high-emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 
8.5, respectively), compared with average conditions from 1986 to 2005. By 2090, 
average annual temperature is projected to increase by 1.5–2.9 °C and 2.9–5.3 °C 
under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively (Table  1). Average maximum and

minimum temperatures are projected to increase by similar amounts as the average 
daily mean temperature. Some appreciation of the significance of these changes can 
be gained from comparison with the change in temperature already observed. Mean 
annual temperature has increased by about 1 degree over the past 100 years, while 
the middle of the range for RCP4.5 (intermediate emissions) is 1 degree by 2030. 
That represents a fivefold increase in the rate of warming (i.e. 0.1 °C per decade 
since 1910 compared with 0.5 °C per decade to 2030).
Temperature extremes can be expected to increase as projected average tempera-
tures rise (Steffen et al.2014; Moise et al. 2015). Extremes can be manifested as a 
wider temperature range (i.e. record new maximum or minimum temperatures), a 
change in the frequency of occurrence above or below thresholds or as sequences or 
runs of days exceeding temperature thresholds. The intensity of hot spells (daily 
maxima above 35 °C) is projected to increase over most of arid Australia, as is their 
duration. The overall frequency of hot days is also expected to increase.
An inland site such as Alice Springs can expect the average number of days 
above 35 °C to increase from 94 under current climate to 113 days at 2030 under an 
intermediate emissions future (RCR4.5). This continues to rise with time, so that by 
2090, more than a third of the year would experience maxima above 35 °C. Coastal 
areas will not be immune. In Broome, the number of days with maxima over 35 °C 
is projected to increase from 56 currently (1971–2000 average) to 87 in 2030 for 
RCP 4.5, and to 133 in 2090 for RCP 4.5 (Moise et al. 2015).
Higher temperatures and more hot days, coupled with higher evaporation, are 
expected to raise the atmospheric component of bushfire risk by promoting faster 
curing of biomass as well as contributing to stronger fire behaviour. Combined fire 
risk is heavily dependent on fuel availability, and this is determined by rainfall, so 
the overall trend in fire risk remains uncertain over inland Australia.
How mean temperatures and extremes evolve over coming decades will be mod-
ulated by changes in rainfall. If rainfall increases, some easing of warming can be 
expected (as has occurred in recent years; Fig. 2). Given there is little agreement 
among the current generation of climate models on future rainfall trends over inland 
Australia, the overall temperature trajectory remains towards rising temperatures.
Rainfall: Current Trends
Over the last 50  years, annual rainfall has increased over northern and inland 
Australia and declined in the south and far west. It reflects contrasting trends 
between summer and winter rainfall that appear to have intensified in recent decades. 
Rainfall for April to October for the past 20 years has been markedly lower than 
normal over much of southern and western Australia (Fig. 5).
The decline in autumn and winter rainfall over the western Pilbara and south-­
west of western Australia is attributed to the southward shift in the subtropical ridge 
and midlatitude weather systems (Bates et al. 2012; Cai et al. 2012; Charles et al. 
2013; Abram et al. 2014). Consequent rainfall reductions are associated with the 
persistence of high-pressure systems over the region, so while intense rainfall events

still occur, they are often interspersed by longer dry periods. The trend to more 
rainfall over inland and northern Australia during April to October should be taken 
in context that this period is usually dry. Seasonal mean rainfall is mostly under 
200 mm or less. The decline in growing season rainfall over the south-west is con-
sistent with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and cannot be explained 
solely by natural climate variability or changed land use such as land clearing (Bates 
et al. 2012). Increasing rainfall over inland and northern Australia during warmer 
months has been more significant (Fig. 6). Most of this change has occurred in sum-
mer (December to February) and appears to have intensified in the past two decades. 
A recent study of tree growth in the Pilbara found that 5 of the 10 wettest years in 
the last 210 years occurred in the last two decades (O’Donnell et al. 2010, 2011).
Bates et al. (2012) linked increased rainfall in the Kimberley and the Eastern 
Pilbara to an increase in the growth rate of north-west cloud bands and an increase 
in the variability of the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Bates et al. (2012) also sug-
gested that particulate pollution from Southeast Asia might be influencing tropical 
weather patterns, decreasing the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface in 
some regions. An additional climate influence has been increasing sea surface tem-
peratures to the north of Australia (Bureau of Meteorology 2016b State of the 
Climate 2016). Causes are likely to be a combination of global warming and climate 
events (such as ENSO and IOD events). Warmer sea temperatures have been associ-

ated with increasing rainfall during stronger IOD events, such as in 2010 (Lim et al. 
2016). In addition to increased annual rainfall, the seasonality—the difference 
between rainfall amount in the driest and wettest periods—has also increased in 
northern WA (Feng et al. 2013).
Rainfall: Future Projections
On a global scale, climate modelling indicates a general expansion of the tropics, a 
southward shift of the subtropical ridge and a contraction of midlatitude low-­
pressure systems closer to the pole. For southern and south-western Australia, this 
means continuation of the drying trend during autumn and winter as greenhouse gas 
concentrations increase. Southern parts of inland Australia are likely to be similarly 
affected as winter weather systems become either weaker or less frequent. The over-
all increase in average pressure will likely drive a further shift to a more settled 
weather regime, with more high pressure systems persisting for longer (Bates et al. 
2012). There is high confidence that annual, winter and spring rainfall will decline 
in regions dominated by winter-type weather systems. Climate models have been 
consistent in projecting such changes in mid- and high-latitude weather systems. 
Interannual rainfall variability will remain high over inland Australia, and this will 
tend to mask projected rainfall trends. Changes in projected rainfall for the 
Monsoonal North are small compared with current natural variability, and there is 
generally low confidence in projected rainfall changes. This most likely comes from 
Fig. 6  Northern wet season (October to April) rainfall deciles for 1995–2016. (Source: Bureau of 
Meteorology State of the Climate 2016, http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate)

the dominance of interannual climate events such as ENSO and IOD, and climate 
models currently are not consistent in simulating changes in their future variability 
(Table 2).
Warmer sea surface temperatures in the future may be expected to contribute to 
higher daily or seasonal rainfall via increased availability of water vapour. How 
much rain actually occurs will depend on interactions between water availability 
and seasonal weather events. It may mean that when a climate event favourable to 
rainfall occurs (such as a La Niña), higher sea surface temperatures may act to 
enhance rain from that event. There is some evidence of this interaction occurring 
during 2010 (Lim et al. 2016). Projections of future tropical cyclone frequency and 
strength reflect complex interactions between climate influences. While the fre-
quency of occurrence of tropical cyclones could decrease by the end of the twenty-­
first century, the region of cyclone formation and decay could move about 100 km 
southward. On one hand, changes to the frequency of El Niño events may reduce 
cyclone occurrence in the Australian region; on the other hand, warmer ocean tem-
peratures can allow cyclones to form and persist further south. Tropical cyclones 
could increase in size, and the most intense tropical cyclones could become more 
powerful. An increase in the intensity of rainfall associated with tropical cyclones is 
also expected.
Summary
Australia’s climate has changed over the last century, particularly over the last 
50 years:
•	 Average temperature has increased by about 1 °C.
•	 Rainfall has increased slightly over the north and interior but declined along the 
west and south. Rainfall has declined by about 20% over the far south-west.
•	 Fire risk has increased in many areas, especially inland eastern Australia.

These changes are greater than what would be expected from purely natural cli-
mate variability and are consistent with global warming as a result of greenhouse 
gas emissions.
Climate projections suggest:
•	 Average temperatures will be 0.5–1.3 °C higher by 2030, regardless of emission 
scenario, and 1.1–2.7 °C and 2.6–5.1 °C higher at the end of the century under 
intermediate- and high-emission scenarios, respectively, compared with average 
conditions from 1986 to 2005.
•	 The intensity and duration of hot spells are expected to increase.
•	 Annual rainfall in the south-west will be 5–6% less by 2030 and 1–15% and 
5–35% less by 2090 for intermediate- and high-emission scenarios, respectively, 
compared with average conditions from 1986 to 2005.
•	 Annual rainfall will remain relatively unchanged in northern and central regions.
•	 The frequency of rain events will decrease, but storm intensity will increase.
•	 Tropical cyclone frequency may decline, but tropical cyclones may increase in 
intensity and travel further south.
•	 Evaporative demand will increase.
•	 Fire risk according to temperature will increase but be co-determined by fuel 
loads.
