Introduction 
 
The technological advances that we as a
society have made in the last few
decades have been mind-boggling. I
remember my mother telling me that
when she was a child, her father told her
man would never set foot on the moon.
And now, there are plans in place to
colonize Mars!
 
When we look at all the advancements
made, the internet has to take top place
when it comes to the development that
has had the biggest impact on us as a

society.
From very humble beginnings in what
was essentially a messaging system, the
net has grown into a giant, media rich
network with the ability to connect every
person on the face of the earth.
You can find out everything about a
person if you know where to look. All of
our data, photos, videos, etc. in the
personal and business arenas are out on
the web.
And the scary part is that a lot of this
data 
is 
collected 
without 
your

knowledge. The sites you surf, the
searches you do, cookies you install, etc.
all allow a very accurate picture of what
your preferences are. This is why
Google and Facebook show you ads
related to things that you may very well
be interested in – they know what you’re
looking for.
So, it’s not just the bad guys that you
have to look out for. You no doubt try to
protect your personal information from
those who would use it to rip you off –
such as being careful when you your
credit card to pay for goods online, etc.
But not everyone who is looking for
information on you is trying to steal from

you. Granted, they do still want your
money, but this is because they want to
sell you something.
Are you really happy with this kind of
free-for-all when it comes to your
personal information?
I, for one, am not. But for the average
web user it can be tough to get around
this. Every single time you make use of
an application on the web or a piece of
software, they expect you to agree to
their terms upfront.
What most people don’t know, however,

is that part of these terms is to make your
personal data available to the developer.
Google, for example, knows where you
live, where you are hanging out, what
you are looking to buy, etc. Every time
you run a Google search, it is collecting
more information on you.
And it is all perfectly legal. Besides
which, what can you do about it
anyway?
Well, one alternative is to switch up
your search engine to one such as
DuckDuckGo. This is a different kind of

search engine because it does not collect
or store your personal information at all.
For most users, however, Google will
always be the go-to search engine. For
starters, the risk of losing too much
personal data is managed and most of
those using the internet couldn’t care
less.
If you’ve been online for a while, you
have no doubt had something hacked.
Maybe your Facebook account, maybe
your website. Maybe it was just bad
luck and you ran into some top-shelf
hacker who was able to break through

every firewall until they gained access.
After all, it wasn’t your fault, was it?
I hate to break it to you, but a hacker
with the skills to hack any system they
want would be on to bigger and better
things – they are not interested in posting
porn on your Facebook page.
For the most part, most of us are small-
fry that are not worth the hacker’s
trouble.
There are some exceptions, of course,
but we’ll go into that later.

If, however, you do lose your hard-
earned cash to a hacker online, the
chances are that you made a stupid
mistake like failing to log off your
Facebook when using a shared PC or
choosing a password that is easy to
guess.
I once hacked my mom’s Facebook
because it was so easy to do considering
she had chosen such a simple password.
The scary part is that anyone who had
seen her posts on Facebook would have
been able to do the same.
This section here is not about victim-

shaming, please don’t get me wrong. All
I am trying to do is to illustrate a point –
most of the time, a hack is as a result of
a mistake that you have made.
But stop worrying about it – this book
has been designed to make you the
ultimate covert operative online. We are
going to plug the information leaks and
let you surf to your heart’s content
without giving away all your personal
details.
Now, there are many ways to do this, so
many, in fact, that we could write a
whole series of encyclopedias on the

topic. So I will concentrate on just one
for this book – TOR, The Onion Routine
Project.
This was initially developed for military
use but is now open to all.
It puts new meaning to the phrase
“incognito” when surfing the web. When
used properly, TOR can help you keep
your private information to yourself
when surfing the web.
Are you ready to add some layers of
protection?

Chapter 1
 
Staying Anonymous on the 
Deep Web
 
TOR is one of the solutions to keeping
your personal data secure on the deep
web. Let’s have a look at why it’s a
workable solution.
 
This application was initially developed
as a secure military communications
network. Now, however, TOR servers
are available to anyone online. This

system protects your identity by have
several routers that move traffic.
If someone runs a search on who you
are, they will come up with a batch of
TOR servers at random, getting them no
closer to who you actually are.
The reason that the traffic is moved as it
is, is so that the various nodes within the
network are able to hide the person
actually online – you.
This 
will 
enable 
you 
to 
remain
anonymous in the face of the various
services used to track the personal data

of users.

Chapter 2
 
What is TOR?
 
So we understand basically that TOR
helps you to stay anonymous and we
know 
that 
it 
is 
essentially 
a
communications network. To understand
it more fully, we need to understand
what it is used for as well.
 
What is TOR Used For?
 

TOR can prove to be a very handy tool.
These are some of the reason why you
might want to use it:
Maybe you want to look for
information that you are not meant to
be looking for and need to stay
anonymous.
Maybe you need to use a shared PC
and don’t want to risk your data
being compromised.
Maybe you want to keep ISPs,
advertisers, 
websites, 
etc. 
from
tracking your online activity for

marketing purposes.
Maybe you want to work around the
police or you are in a country that
won’t allow freedom of access to all
information on the web.
Perhaps you need to get your
message out there without fear of
recriminations.
Great, But How Does it Work?
The best analogy is an onion here. An
onion is made up of a number of
different layers. Each one protecting the

layer beneath it. You need to work your
way through these various layers in
order to get to the core of the onion.
In TOR, the “layers” are the routers
within the network and those wanting to
find the information at the core must
work their way through each of these
layers.
Let’s put it another way. Let’s say that
you need to ship a vase. You do not want
it to be scratched or damaged, so you
cover it with bubble wrap. You want
more protection so you add a couple
more layers. Then you put it into a box

and place packing peanuts in there as an
extra layer of protection.
The vase is very well protected. No one
looking at the box would be able to see
what was inside because of how it was
packed. Even if someone did get to open
the box and managed to take the vase
out, they still couldn’t see it because of
the bubble wrap. Until someone persists
in unwrapping each layer of bubble
wrap, they are not able to see the full
picture at all.
This is pretty the principle around which
TOR was created. In this case, though,

the vase is your data and your search
history. To prevent the information being
easy to track, TOR sends it through
several nodes on its network. Each
redirection of the traffic is like adding
another layer of bubble wrap.
Nodes can consist of servers and routers
worldwide and so the information can
be passed on endlessly if need be.
It sounds pretty simple and it is. And the
great news is that you don’t have to be a
techie to get the system to work for you.

Is it Secure?
It’s a funny thing – this is always the first
thing that I get asked. The truth is that
nothing online, like in life, is ever going
to be completely secure. You could run
off and live in a cave to try and escape
risk and get bitten on the toe by a
scorpion.
TOR is also not 100% secure. Whilst it
has proven to be an alternative that
outperforms several others, there have
been a number of weaknesses that have
been found in the last few years. I have
given the lists of exploits involving

TOR. (These are items that hackers
make use of to exploit weaknesses in a
system.)
Exploits Involving TOR
AS Eavesdropping: It is possible to
spy on the traffic that moves into and
out of the network. If the hacker is a
pro, they could use this info to find
out where you are.
Exit Node Eavesdropping: This is
the point at which the data exits the
system – where the TOR hands it off

to a server outside of the network.
So, if you are using the TOR network
to sign into a password protected
server 
outside 
the 
network, 
a
sophisticated hacker could get their
hands 
on 
passwords 
or 
other
sensitive data. It is best to use normal
networks to check your emails,
internet banking, etc. Avoid anything
that is password protected on TOR
unless it also resides on the TOR
network.
Traffic Analysis Attack: This is not
such a huge threat but there is a
chance that someone could get
information about what you are

doing. They should not be able to
identify you though.
TOR Exit Node Block: There are
certain sites that will not allow users
on the TOR network to fully access
their 
sites 
without 
providing
identification. Wikipedia is one such
site – you can still view the
information but won’t be able to edit
any of the pages.
Bad Apple Attack: This makes use
of services within the TOR that are
already 
weak. 
This 
includes
BitTorrent clients. The way a around

this is simple – don’t try to use TOR
as a way of keeping downloads via
Torrent sites anonymous.
Any protocol that might expose
your IP address: It’s not just
BitTorrent that jeopardizes your
online anonymity, P2P tracker comms
can also make you vulnerable. Steer
clear of anything that might leave
your IP address exposed.
Sniper Attacks: There is very little
nothing worse than an attack that
leads to a denial of service. This can
be done by a sophisticated hacker.

They force you to use a particular set
of exit nodes by blocking most nodes
in the system. This allows them t0
figure out who you are but it is not
something that amateur hackers are
usually able to do.
Vulnerabilities with Bio Trackers:
User bio trackers can prove to be a
liability within a TOR network.
Volume of Data: If someone is
tracking you, it is possible for them
to match your activity within the TOR
network by the volume of data that
you are using and moving.

To Be Advised: There are no doubt
going to be new exploits and
vulnerabilities identified as time
goes on. It’s not feasible to expect a
system to be 100% secure all the
time.
I realize that this list may make you want
to think twice about the security of using
the Tor network but it should be noted
that there are security issues with any
system. However, It should be noted that
the main benefit derived from the TOR
is 
that 
you 
can 
surf 
the 
web
anonymously. With some additional
safeguards in place, you can increase

your security within the system as well.
Using TOR
Using TOR is not that hard but you do
need to use a browser that will work
with it. You can check the TOR Project
site to get the newest releases of the
tool. It is worth looking into using the
TOR Project browser because it offers a
simple entry to anonymous surfing.
Alternatively, you can choose to add it to
your existing browser if it is compatible.
Mozilla is a browser that is supported

and one that you might be interested in if
you are already a Mozilla user. You
don’t have quite as much functionality as
you would have with the actual TOR
browser but this is an easy option if you
are not all that clued up on computers. It
is as simple as adding the option to
Mozilla.
The Advantages and Disadvantages of
the TOR Browser
The Advantages:
If you want the best when it comes

to anonymity, it is tough to beat the
browser. If you need to be able to
stay private most of the time online,
this is a good option. You can browse
sites without leaving a trail.
Gaining access to the Dark Web.
There is a lot going on in the Dark
Web. It is a zone that search engines
fear to enter. It may seem enticing but
it is a place where a lot of illegal
deals take place. This is the place on
the web where you are most likely to
find things such as child pornography,
murder for hire, etc. Tread lightly if
you venture there because you could
end up in trouble with the law.

You’ll be practically invisible to
prying eyes. Your basic entry-level
hacker is not going to be able to pick
you up. That is not to say that you are
completely safe though. A more
experienced hacker might be able to
find you.
The TOR is a golden standard if you
want to browse in private. It is highly
mobile and allows for access to be
carefully hidden.
The Disadvantages:

If 
you 
are 
a 
stickler 
for
performance, this is not for you.
Things have been improving but it is
still quite a bit slower than normal
browsing. You need to decide if the
increase 
in 
privacy 
is 
worth
sacrificing a bit of speed.
You won’t be completely secure and
you could be monitored. It should be
kept in mind that state agencies
monitor online activity that attempts
to remain hidden. If you stumble onto
a site related to illegal activities
even 
just 
once, 
they 
will 
be
monitoring you. If you are a repeat
customer, they may become very

interested in you. That said, don’t
panic too much if you find an illegal
site in error. As long as you act in the
correct way, you will be okay. That
means that you need to get off the site
as quickly as possible or make a
report about the site to the relevant
authorities. If you do get asked
questions, be open and honest with
your answers.
There have been issues with people
misusing the network because of the
anonymity 
it 
provides.
Reputationally, the TOR network has
taken a beating. That said, not all of
the activity deemed illegal is wrong.

For example, many activists living in
societies where there is a lot of
censorship have made use of the
TOR network to get their message
across.
Latency issues abound on the TOR
network. You are going to need to
suck it up and be patient here or
avoid using this network altogether.
 
 
The Advantages and Disadvantages of 
the Mozilla Add-On
If you decide to go for the Mozilla add-

on instead, here is what you can expect.
Mozilla products are all free and
open-source and anyone can help to
improve them. The developers have
ensured that people are easily able to
check that the system does deliver
what it claims to. Transparency helps
keep the developers honest.
You can customize the add-on as you
like. That means that you can have a
browsing experience that is set to
your own specifications.
You do get access to a very

supportive 
community. 
For 
a
beginner, this is most important. You
can get access to assistance from
various members of the community.
Mozilla works across a range of
platforms and will work with many
different operating systems. If you
upgrade your device in future, you
are able to enjoy continuity of
service because of this – you don’t
have to go and learn a whole new
software version again.
In addition, the add-on is constantly
being improved upon. It supports

HTML5, allows you to sync your
data across different devices, let’s
you set up and manage bookmarks
and has a function that allows for the
quick grab of pages. It features a
lower drain on your computer’s
resources in terms of CPU usage and
memory.
One annoyance is that you need to
restart the system with every new
extension that you install.
The speed of operations is not
consistent over all operating systems.
It is slower when using a Mac than it

would be in Linux or Windows.
The speed at which Mozilla is being
developed could end up leaving the
extension behind. Extensions may not
continue 
to 
work 
with 
newer
versions of the browser.

Chapter 3
 
Will TOR work for you?
 
It is not always appropriate to use the
TOR network. You need to draw the line
between 
maintaining 
safety 
and
anonymity online. The TOR network is
not perfect and is very much still a work
in progress.
 
And whilst the protocol underlying the
TOR remains unbroken, the fact that you
have to use it within a browser

introduces a level of vulnerability. And
browsers are not great a strong link in
the chain of internet security.
Your browser is what allows you to
connect with the network online but it
can be exploited. It has been said that
certain government agencies are able to
identify and track users of the TOR
network.
What that essentially means is that using
the TOR system is not going to
completely protect you if you want to
hide illegal activity. It might make things
harder on the authorities trying to find

you but it won’t stop them forever.
That means that illegal usage of this
system is not recommended. In fact, if
you have nefarious intentions, you
should steer well clear of the system – if
someone else in the community finds
you, they are bound to report you to
maintain the integrity of the online
community using the network.
Avoid doing the following when on the 
TOR network: 
Trying to download big files if you
want to retain anonymity. You will

need to use some kind of torrent
client and this will make it easy to
track what you have downloaded. It
will take longer than normal and
slow the network down for everyone.
And there really is nothing to gain
from it.
Trying to avoid being surveilled by
a government agency. The federal
government agencies are able to
access the network and identify
users. You are not really anonymous
to them, even on the TOR network.
 
Trying to stay safe online while

accessing 
your 
social 
media
accounts. The very act of accessing
your social media means that you
have to move off the TOR network
and 
lose 
anonymity 
anyway.
Furthermore, your access details will
be exposed when you leave the
network. It is not safe to surf sites
that you need password access to on
the TOR network.
Accessing 
official 
websites 
or
system. Every such access is logged
and can be traced. Most people trying
to access such sites are doing so for
nefarious reasons. In addition to
which, it is an offence to attempt

unauthorized access to any site and
you are risking some serious jail time
if you are caught. It might be
tempting, 
considering 
how
anonymous you feel but this is not
what TOR was originally designed
for.
There are lots of reasons to use the
TOR network but you do need to bear
in mind that the very fact that you are
using an anonymous service like this
will 
raise 
red 
flags 
for 
law
enforcement agencies.

Chapter 4
 
Your Step By Step Guide to 
Getting Started with TOR
 
Right, are you ready to start? 
 
Is TOR for You? 
 
We’ve been through the fact that TOR
will not be a good fit for everyone. The
first step anyone should take is to ensure

that TOR is really going to work for you.
We are not going to go through a list of
pros and cons, though. We are going to
look at best practices that you may need
to implement if you want to use TOR.
Changing the Operating System 
Windows is meant to be easy to use,
even for the most unskilled user. A
problem with this approach is that it is
also a lot easier to hack. There are many
exploits out there designed specifically
around Windows.

And remember, TOR only protects your
identity, it does not make your system
more secure. It could pay you to change
over to an operating system that is more
secure, such as Linux. Linux works well
with TOR.
You will also find that Mac has better
security than windows and also works
with TOR. Just keep in mind that the
TOR network is usually slower for Mac
users.
Stay Up to Date

Yes, I know those endless updates are
extremely annoying but you must ensure
that your operating system, browser and
anti-virus 
programs 
are 
regularly
updated. Every update has been put in
place for a reason – and it could be a
security reason.
HTTPS Everywhere
How many sites have you been on that
don’t offer HTTPS? These sites are not
properly 
encrypted 
and 
could 
be
dangerous to visit. An add-on for your
browser 
known 
as 
“HTTPS

Everywhere” can solve that problem for
you by switching to the encrypted
version of the site, where it is supported.
Data Encryption
It seems rather silly to go to all the
trouble of surfing anonymously if you do
not benefit in terms of increased security
as well. If you are running a Linux
system, you can look for TrueCrypt and
LUKS to encrypt your data for you.
TOR Bundle is Not the Best Idea

It might seem as though TOR Bundle
puts together the best in anonymity and
security but this is a misperception that
could cost you dearly.
The bundle does offer an additional
layer but the FBI has pointed out that
there are vulnerabilities here as well. It
is best not to rely on TOR Bundle for all
your security.
No More Java, Java Script and Flash
The problem with these scripts is that
they could be sharing your information

without any consideration about whether
it is what you want to do or not. Turn
these off so that your private browsing
history is not shared.
No More Peer-to-Peer
Yes, I have said this a few times now.
But I really want to stress the importance
of this – when using this type of
connection, you are potentially putting
your information at risk.
Be a Cookie Monster

Cookies are in place to monitor your
behavior on a particular site and store
personal data. If you want to be truly
anonymous, install an add-on such as
Self-Destructing Cookies. These add-
ons will delete the cookies.
Use Fake Accounts
You go to all the trouble of installing
TOR, changing your operating system
and deleting cookies as you go, and then
you use your real email address.
Congratulations, you have now just

announced to everyone who you are. Set
up a fake email account to use while in
the TOR network.
Bye Bye Google
You know when they say, “Big brother is
watching”, they might as well be
referring to Google. Google is one of the
worst offenders when it comes to
collecting data about you personally.
Rather use a search engine that does not
collect data such as StartPage or
DuckDuckGo.

Act Legally
Be sure to stick to the rules when surfing
anonymously. State and federal law
enforcement 
agencies 
monitor
anonymous users and are quick to act
when illicit activities are flagged. Steer
clear of sites that are less than legal.
There are some instances, however,
when it is wiser to use TOR when
conducting “illegal” activities. If, for
example, you are living in a country
where the media is heavily censored and
you want to keep an eye on international

media without being monitored.
Choose Whether to Use the TOR
Browser or an Add-On
So now you have made your decision –
you have decided that TOR will work
well for you.
We have been through the advantages
and disadvantages of either course of
action and so you have no doubt made a
decision as to which is the preferred
option for you. Who knows, maybe
you’ve decided that you’ll make use of

both.
Stepping Behind the Curtain
You are almost ready to step inside
TOR. First of all, make sure that you
have physically logged out of any
applications that you have on your
system. If you do not do this, you run the
risk of them sharing your data whilst in
TOR.
Once you have done that, where do you
start to explore? Here are some
suggestions.

Hidden Wiki
This is the TOR version of Wikipedia.
You can use it to find items that you are
interested in. This site lists what hidden
onion sites there are and lists what
topics are covered. To find Hidden Wiki
is 
simple 
– 
just 
access 
your
DuckDuckGo search engine to search for
it. You’ll find it quite easily that way.
What you could find:
News: Getting uncensored news is

one of the primary, more legitimate
uses of TOR. You are able to find all
the most up to date news. There are
several sites within the TOR network
devoted to giving up to date news.
All you need to do is to find one that
is credible and that is of interest to
you.
Introduction Points: These can be
considered stepping stones. They
bridge the gap between the “normal”
web and the TOR sites. These will
be the first sites that you come across
within the network.

Commercial Services: There are
going to be times when you want to
buy 
something 
completely
anonymously. Bitcoins can be used
here and this makes it possible for
transactions to be conducted entirely
anonymously. The transactions can be
traced but it will take someone with
excellent skills to do so when you are
within the TOR network.
History: Despite what you may
have been taught in school, history
can be more a matter of perspective
than of actual fact. As they say,
history is in the hands of the winners.
If, for example, the Nazis had won

World War II, what would we have
been taught of the Holocaust today?
Searching through TOR, you are
more likely to find actual personal
accounts, etc. that have not been spun
to look good.
 
 
Forums: Are you desperate to
discuss how bad your government is
but scared of recriminations? You
could join an online community
within the TOR system. Google, etc.
has similar forums but it is not nearly
as easy to remain anonymous with
these. The developers of these
forums on the normal web have full

access to your IP address, real user
name and email address (even if
these are hidden from the rest of the
community) 
and 
they 
can 
be
compelled to hand that information
over.
Dangerous Topics: The anonymity
of the TOR system is obviously a
huge drawcard for those who are
conducting illicit activities. There
are many sites that will teach you
how to create viruses, how to hack
systems, create malware, etc. It is
better to steer clear of these sites to
avoid getting into trouble with the
authorities. This may be difficult to

do as some of these sites will pop-up
on your screen. If you do come
across them by accident or by pop-
up, don’t get drawn in - you just need
to close them as quickly as possible.
For most uses, however, the Hidden
Wiki is going to give you all the
information that you need. The lists on
the site may not always be current but it
is still the best source of information
about what is on the TOR network.
Sites within the TOR network are not
always maintained or as long-lasting as
those outside of the network.

It is a good idea to set up bookmarks
when you find a site that you want to
visit again. Unlike the normal web,
URLS on the TOR network are difficult
to remember. In addition, you cannot
always rely on the directories within the
Hidden Wiki either. This might mean
having to do some serious searching to
find a site again. Bookmark it to be on
the safe side.
Onion Chat
Onion Chat refers to anonymous chat
rooms on the TOR network. Because of

the anonymity aspect, they are more
likely to remain in service for longer.
You can even make friends during these
chats.
That said, however, it should always be
a priority to guard your identity – use a
nickname and never reveal information
about yourself that could let them figure
out who you are. It would be unwise to
tell someone which town you live in,
where you work, etc.
New Yorker Strongbox
News agencies often rely on insider

information when it comes to blowing
scandals wide open. The New Yorker
maintains a site on the TOR network to
allow people who want to give them tips
to do so completely anonymously. They
assign you a code name and never force
you to reveal who you actually are.
(Though, if you are hoping to get paid,
you will have to reveal this at some
stage.)
It Can be Lonely In the TOR
TOR is not a network that everyone
knows about and it is not someone that

everyone knows how to use. There is a
sense of being alone on the network
because those who have sites and blogs
may not make regular posts.
Users of TOR are looking for anonymity
and so may not want to interact with you.
In addition, websites within the network
tend to be of a more transient nature.
Unlike the normal web, there is not
going to be someone trying to sell you
something every five minutes and finding
information is not necessarily going to
be quick and easy.

Knowing that upfront means that you
understand that you have to exercise
patience and be more resourceful than
usual. The latency problems with the
system can also cause a lot of irritation.
It is the tradeoff that you make for being
able to surf anonymously.
Best Practices
Here we will go through what you can
do to get the most out of using TOR on a
regular basis, especially when it comes
to 
navigating 
the 
system 
and

communicating within it.
Browsing Safely
TOR will not connect with Google by
design. What it does is to connect to a
page that basically interacts with Google
on your behalf. This prevents Google
from being able to make logs of
whatever you have searched for. (Ever
wonder how you always seem to see ads
that are so on point after Googling
something? Google makes notes of what
you search for and ensures that it
displays ads related to your search

preferences.)
Because the TOR network puts this page
in between you and Google, Google is
not able to attribute the search to any
particular person. It makes it impossible
to trace by simple means accessible to
most users. (Not counting governmental
agencies, of course.)
Where TOR cannot do anything is when
it comes to the sites, scripts and any
extensions that are run. If you are using
the TOR browser, it will disable
information-gathering scripts, etc. by
default. It is not a good idea to mess

with this default setting at all or you risk
exposing your identity.
It should also be realized that, due to the
privacy settings, some applications may
not run as well as they should. For
example, Flash protocols are disabled
on the TOR network and so you might
not be able to watch your favorite
YouTube channel, for example.
Some streaming of YouTube has been
made 
possible 
with 
the 
HTML5
additions YouTube has made but this is
still in the early stages.

Where TOR does excel, however, is in
warning you which files or documents
might compromise your identity. And it
tends to be pretty accurate so it is best to
take such warnings to heart.
Anonymous Messaging
When it comes to the normal web,
anonymous messaging is impossible.
Even if you are using nicknames, all
your personal information, including
your IP address, etc. is on record with
the company offering the service.

In addition, all messaging services log
your chats and monitor them. Which
essentially means that nothing is really
private anymore.
That’s where making use of the TOR
system can also be very effective.
TorChat is a messaging app that can be
used as a simple extension. All you need
to do is to download the app from the
site and run the executable file to install
it.
The app works exactly as your normal
messaging programs do and is very user-
friendly. The primary difference is that

you are assigned a name by the system
that consists of a random number of
characters.
You are able to assign nicknames to
people on your list so that you know
who you are speaking to.
And, because the system runs on the
TOR network, it is not possible to easily
trace your real identity, nor will anyone
else be able to establish who you are
speaking to.
Crypto Messaging

Should you want to go all 007 here, you
can also encrypt your messages and then
send them through the TOR network.
The problem here is that there is a
greater chance that the messages can be
intercepted because the apps that allow
encryption 
won’t 
work 
in 
the
background. 
However, 
because 
the
messages are encrypted, anyone who
intercepts them will find them difficult to
read. A service like Cryptocat is a good
option here and it can be downloaded
from the Cryptocat site.

Emails That are Truly Anonymous
What happens when instant messages are
no good? What if you must send an
email? The TOR network does have a
hidden email service but you have to be
within the network to make use of it.
In order to access it, you just need to go
to the site while on the TOR network
and set it up from there.
The service is very user-friendly and
intuitive to use. It looks similar to your
usual online mail clients. The big

advantage is that it is impossible to
access it or search through the messages
unless you are in the TOR network.
Step-by-Step Guide to TOR
Go to the official site and find the
Browser download page. In Windows,
this is quite easy – you usually just need
to hit the download button and allow it
to be installed. If you are running a
different operating system, you should
follow the developer’s instructions for
that system.

Here is a more technical breakdown of
the process for you:
This is for those who are more
technically minded and who want to run
through the process one step at a time.
TOR Browser Installation with the
Windows Operating System
As mentioned above, it is pretty simple
to install the browser into windows.
1. Close all programs other than your

web browser.
2. Start at the official TOR website
and look for the updated version of
the browser. On the top right-hand
side of the screen you will see a tab
for Downloads. Click on this.
3. Now select the operating system you
are using. The options you can
choose from include Apple, Window,
Source Code, Smartphones and Linux
so you can download it to your
laptop, tablet or smartphone – or all
of your devices if you like.

4. Select your language preference in
order to begin the download. You
will be given the option of also
downloading TOR Bundle – a toolset
aimed at making it easier to improve
your privacy when you are surfing.
(Just remember what I mentioned
earlier about not relying solely on the
TOR Bundle for this. Do take the
other steps to further increase your
safety while browsing.)
5. You will be asked where you want
to save the actual installed files on
your device. This is not a major issue
as it has little effect on how the rest
of the process goes. (Just ensure that

you have enough memory on the
device so that you can install the
files.)
6. As soon as the download is
complete, you can open it so that it
can install the browser. If you decide
to do this later on, you will need to
find the files in the location that you
had chosen earlier.
7. Select the appropriate language that
you want to use and then press the
OK button.
8. You will again need to choose

where the files will run from. Again,
make sure the memory is adequate for
this. (A pop-up window will come up
with a suggested download path,
showing how much memory is
needed and how much is available. If
you want it installed to a different
location, hit the “Browse” button and
choose the location that you want,
otherwise continue as normal.)
9. Leave the installer to do its thing –
this will take a few minutes.
10. You will be asked if you want to
also install a link in the start menu

and if you want to create a shortcut
on the desktop. The decision is yours.
Once that decision is made, the
browser is fully installed and ready
to use.
Using 
TOR 
Through 
BlackBelt
Privacy on Firefox
1. If you would rather use the software
through 
Firefox, 
you 
can 
use
BlackBelt to help you do this. You
will need to have the Firefox
browser as well so if you don’t have
it, download it now.

2. Search for BlackBelt Privacy +
TOR 
and 
download 
the 
latest
version. It won’t take long because
it’s a very small file.
3. Open the file and then choose one of
the following options:
TOR Client Only Operator – this
enables you to use the TOR network
but doesn’t allow others to use you as
a relay.
 
Bridge Relay Operator – This
enables you to use the TOR network

and to also act as a relay so that
others can do the same.
 
Censored User – If you are using this
to avoid censorship at home, this
should be the option that you choose.
 
4. Once you have selected what kind
of TOR user you want to be, you can
carry on with installing the program.
5. As soon as it is installed, you can
start browsing anonymously.
Setting it Up Manually

1. If something goes wrong and the
configuration does not seem to be
working as it should, you can try the
following manual settings.
2. You need to have installed the TOR
browser before starting, so do that
now.
3. Despite the fact that we have
installed the browser, we are not
going to use it to navigate, we are
going 
to 
use 
Mozilla 
instead.
(Mozilla is updated more frequently
than the TOR browser and this means

improved and more up to date
security.)
4. Once TOR is installed, open up
your Mozilla browser and click on
the settings button – you want to
choose Proxy settings.
5. If you want to do the same for
Windows, go to your Menu, select
Options, choose Advanced Options,
find Network and then go to Settings.
6. From there are the process is that
same for both – you are going to
manually set the proxies. Do this as

follows: SOCKS Host: 127.0.0.1;
Port Box: 9150 and, if given the
option, choose SOCKS v5. Check
that the Remote DNS box has been
checked. 
After 
No 
Proxy 
for
introduce: 127.0.0.1.
7. Now check if the TOR is working.
If so, you will receive a message to
say 
that 
you 
are 
navigating
anonymously. If not, you will receive
a message that your IP address is
detectable.
8. If it is still not working, it is better
to deactivate it completely and see if

you 
can 
walk 
through 
the
troubleshooting process.
How to Set Up Hidden Services
Are you intrigued by using hidden
services within the TOR network? Does
it sound like fun? What if you set your
own up?
What is nice is that it is relatively
simple to set up your very own hidden
service within the TOR network.
For this to work, you must first install
the TOR browser on your device.

After that, you need to set up a local
server to use. According the TOR
experts, Windows users should try using
Savant and Max or Linux users should
try using thttpd Web Server.
You can choose a different server if you
like but do keep in mind that this may
open you up to a different set of
vulnerabilities.
Open up the configuration and select
HTTP first, from there select Server
DNS. Type in the word “localhost” and,
where it says “Port # To Serve From”
type in “80”.

Your usual path for Savant in Windows
is: C:\Savant\Root directory. You need
to ensure that the default used by Savant
is 
replaced 
by 
your 
“Index.html”
document.
You can see whether or not things are
running as they should by opening your
browser and typing “localhost” into it.
To check that everything is running
correctly, you just need to type localhost
in the browser. You can use a different
port if you want – set it up by entering
“localhost:[#of the port]”. So, you could

for example, type “localhost:125 for
port # 125”.
You have now brought the local server
up online and can set up your hidden
service.
All that you need to do is to let the TOR
browser know that you have set up a
new server. This can be done by:
Closing your TOR browser as needed;
Typing “torrc” into your computer’s
search function (You can also look to see
if it is in the Tor directory on your
computer); Opening this file using a
simple editor like Notepad; Adding in

some text such as: # Hidden Service;
HiddenServiceDir
C:\Users\Name\tor_service;
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80.
You 
then 
need 
to 
go 
into
C:\Users\Name\tor_service string and
change this to an actual path set on your
computer.
You should not use a website to use as a
directory here. You will have to match
the final number in the new string to the
port you chose earlier when setting up
the local server.

If you do not have a tor_service folder,
create a new folder for it. Save your
changes and then restart the browser
again.
You would then need to check through
your message log to ensure that
everything went smoothly with the
configuration.
There are going to be 2 documents in the
tor_service folder – private_key and
hostname.
These make sure that your service
functions as it should and so should be

kept safe. If someone gets their hand on
the key, they can use it to delete the
hidden service you have set up.
If you open the hostname file, you will
see the hidden address’s onion address.
This is what you can share with those
that you want to be able to use the
service.
You have now set up a TOR site and can
post what you like to it. Visitors to the
site will have to be on the TOR network
in order to use it.
So, it really isn’t too difficult to set up a

service within the TOR network. You
can thus post news, etc. and share as you
like with other TOR users. This is a very
easy way to create a website on TOR. If
you want something that looks great
though, you may need to learn more
about CSS and HTML.
But that is something outside the scope
of this book. Tutorials on creating
websites abound online and so you
should have no problems finding one.
There are also tons of free, generic
templates that can be customized to your
own needs if that is what you are looking
for.

Tips to Make TOR Run Better
No Torrents or Peer-to-peer sharing.
These will work a lot more slowly in
TOR and so you will hold up
everyone. In addition, your IP
address is revealed when doing so
and that kind of makes the whole
anonymity aspect void.
Disable plug-ins for the browser
unless 
you 
have 
personally
developed them. Even when working
within the TOR network, if info-
gathering 
plug-ins 
have 
been
installed, they will continue to

collect data about what you have
been doing.
Always use HTTPS and don’t visit
sites 
that 
don’t 
support 
this
functionality. It is the entry and exit
points to the TOR system that are
most likely to be problematic when it
comes to keeping your identity secret.
Whilst on the network, your identity
is protected, but that is not the case
when moving off or onto the network.
You can counter this through the
proper use of encryption. If you use
the add-on HTTPS Everywhere, you
are going to be able to further protect
your information. Sites that do not

support 
secure 
HTTP 
protocols
should be avoided completely.
Wait until after exiting the TOR
network to read documents that you
may have downloaded. The potential
problem is that many of these
documents are stored in the cloud and
may need user verification to open. A
click will take you to the correct
page 
and 
your 
system 
may
automatically log you in to Adobe
Reader, for example, giving away
your identity. It is best not to click on
links that will open anything while on
the network.

Make use of bridges. The TOR
system allows you to make use of a
number 
or 
relays 
instead 
of
interacting directly with sites. Be
sure that you make use of these to
further protect your identity while
surfing.
Get your friends to come on board.
The more people that use the TOR
network, the stronger it becomes. Tell
people about it and the advantages of
using it and get them to try it out for
themselves.

Chapter 5
 
Where to Go and What to 
See on the Deep Web
 
I just want to preface this by saying that
exploring the deep web can seem
exciting but it’s important to remember
that some of what you will come across
is highly illegal. There are some pretty
sick people out there and you might
come across things that you really don’t
want to see.

In addition, you could end up getting
yourself into a lot of trouble with the
law if you get involved in any of the
illicit activities in the deep web. At
times, such as when it comes to
unintentionally viewing illicit material
such as child pornography, the act of just
seeing the site can get you into trouble
regardless of your intentions. So, even if
you are not actually intending to get
involved with anything illegal on the
deep web, you stand the chance of
getting into trouble.
The best way to protect yourself in
situations such as these is to immediately

get off the site. You should also consider
reporting the matter to the relevant
authorities.
For your own sake, do not use the TOR
network to solicit crimes or commit
crimes. As I have mentioned several
times before, the authorities are on the
lookout for this kind of thing.
Using Hidden Services
Hidden services are regularly used
within the TOR network because they
add another level of privacy. Websites

using such services are not subject to
being spied upon in the same way as
normal sites are.
This makes them less likely to be able to
be blocked or spammed. They can
theoretically run indefinitely because
there is no way for outsiders to take
them down.
Let’s look at a real-world example here.
Say, for example, I am annoyed with a
company and I want to cause them real
harm. If I could get enough people on my
side, we could spam the company’s site
until it crashed.

It would take some effort but it would be
possible to do because, on the normal
internet, their servers, etc. would be
fairly easy to find. It would then be a
matter of throwing enough data at them
to overload their capacity.
If, on the other hand, they could keep
their services hidden, I would not be
able to spam the site and crash it.
With the TOR network, the servers are
anonymous and so less vulnerable to
attack. As a result, you will be able to
use the services every day. Anonymity

can also be valuable to those wanting to
transfer things like Bitcoins in secret.
Making Use of Bookmarks
Where all the anonymity can become
annoying is when you want to find a site
that you have visited before. Sites on the
TOR network don’t have a typical URL.
You are not going to find something like
Amazon.com. Instead, you will find
something more along the lines of
armjagsgdgada.onion.
That makes it pretty hard to remember

the address of sites that you have visited.
In addition, the pages within the deep
web are not indexed as normal web
pages are so keyword searches are not
as helpful.
Finding a site then might actually depend
more on luck. If you do find a site that
you’ll want to visit again, bookmark it.
You can always delete the bookmark
later if you want to.
Finding Information in the Deep Web 
We’ve already spoken a bit about

Hidden Wiki as a means of finding sites
of interest in the deep web. The Hidden
Wiki 
does, 
however, 
share 
only
information that is considered safe for
general consumption.
TorSearch is another way to find
information.
It works similarly to Google except that
it doesn’t track your personal searches.
It has also made it a lot easier to find
things in the deep web.
Issues that You May Encounter

Anonymity is one thing. Online security
is something else. When using the TOR
network you run the risk of being
exposed to vulnerabilities. Experienced
hackers may still be able to track you.
In addition, you might also be exposing
yourself to viruses – after all, not
everyone using the deep web is there
with good intentions, are they?
You also need to assume that you are
being monitored when using the TOR
network. Whilst it may be harder for
normal 
people 
to 
track 
you,

governmental agencies are able to do so.
And are more likely to do so because
you are using the network. This means
that you have to be really careful about
what sites you click on.
Being Careful in the Deep Web
There are some search engines that are
available in the deep web but you do
need to be circumspect about which you
choose.
For example, there is a search engine
called Grams that has garnered a lot of

interest from authorities because of its
relation to drugs and online dealing of
the same.
There are several online markets within
the TOR network as well. These include
Agora, Middle Earth and Evolution to
name but a few.
Middle Earth tends to be more user-
friendly. Evolution and Agora, on the
other hand, tend to be more reliable and
this makes them a more popular choice.
It is very important, before you make any
kind of purchase within the TOR

network that you understand exactly how
it is going to work. You also need to
understand the possible implications of
buying what it is that you are buying,
especially if it is of an illegal nature.
When it comes to paying for goods, one
thing you never want to do here is to
give anyone your personal information.
You can get around this by using
Bitcoins. For this you will need a
Bitcoin wallet and to purchase Bitcoins.
This can be done on the official Bitcoin
site.
Bitcoins are a cryptocurrency and are

the safest way to exchange money in the
TOR network.
It can be just as tough making a decision
about whether or not a site is trustworthy
as it is on the normal internet. Look for
references from other clients before
completing the purchase and, when in
doubt, don’t go through with it.
Concerns About Content
Because of the nature of the content in
the TOR network, a general web search
can be more of a risk than a normal web

search would be.
Here are some of the things that you have
to look out for in the TOR network:
Unlinked Content: There is no indexing
of sites by a search engine. You will not
be able to find links or backlinks on the
sites.
Dynamic Content: These sites will
require you to have some knowledge of
how domains work in order for you to
access them. They might require you to
send queries while navigating.

Private Webs: These are essentially
membership sites. You need to be
circumspect about such sites because
you will be required to give personal
information in order to become a
member. There are fake sites out there
designed to get hold of your personal
information.
Contextual Webs: These sites may
require different access contexts. For
example, they might place reliance on
prior clients here.
Limited 
Access 
Content:
Systematically these sites tend to be

more difficult for search engines to
index. They have CAPTCHAs, etc. in
place to ensure that they are less
vulnerable to robots.
Scripted Content: 
These 
websites
require the use of JavaScript or Flash
software, for example. As mentioned
previously, such scripts can be used to
gather personal information.
Software Driven Content: You need to
have the correct program or app
installed to gain access here.
Web Archives: These will often let you

look 
at 
previous 
incarnations 
of
websites. This can be used to see what
previous versions of sites were in place.
The 
TOR 
network 
contains 
many
different formats online just as your
normal browsing does. The key to
keeping safe here is that you understand
what the different formats are and how
they might affect you.
Just like the regular internet, you don’t
want to download files that can create
changes on your computer or files that
you just randomly come across.

What is the Future of the Deep Web? 
In the last few years, the numbers of
people using the TOR network has been
steadily increasing. There has also been
an uptake of people trying to escape
political censorship, as can be seen
during the events of the Arab spring.
Activism is one large reason for
resorting to the use of TOR but there has
also been an uptake of people who just
want to be able to experience the
internet free of censorship.

The truth is though that there are
unplumbed depths when it comes to the
deep web. How much information there
actually is, is anyone’s guess.
Getting an accurate estimate to the actual
amount of information is difficult
because of the nature of the network
itself. What is known is that the number
of users has increased substantially.
It no longer takes a range of skills to be
able to make use of the deep web – you
can set up your own hidden services in a
matter of minutes. And, if you’re not sure
of how to get more out of the web, you

can easily consult an online tutorial.
More and more people are looking to be
able to surf anonymously – whether that
is in an effort to conceal illicit activities
or in a misguided attempt to feel more
secure online.
It should never be forgotten that as the
system becomes more and more popular,
it will become more of a target for
hackers looking to score personal
information.
There are not the normal safeguards in
place – you are anonymous but that

doesn’t mean you are completely safe. In
fact, it may be more dangerous for the
uninitiated because it is so unregulated –
even if you come across a scamming
website, shutting it down is easier said
than done.
Considering how easy it is for scammers
online already, the deep web can be like
the old wild west – if you’re not careful,
you’ll end up being a victim.
You could end up being scammed
because there are lots of sites out there
itching to take your money. And there is
little to no recourse if you do get

scammed.
But, in the grand scheme of things, is it
really so different in the regular online
world? As long as you are aware of the
potential risk, you are far better able to
keep yourself safe.
It might be safer to stay out of the deep
web but it’s safer in the same way as it
would be to never leave your home.
Sure, if you don’t set foot out the door,
you are not likely to get hit by a bus but
you’re not going to have any fun either.
But, if you set out each day, aware of

how to keep yourself safe, you can have
new and exciting experiences.
Who’s to say that the TOR network is
not the next evolution in the development
of the internet? Who’s to say that in a
few years’ time we won’t all crave the
anonymity that came before Facebook
and Twitter became such a big part of
our lives?
If you told someone fifty years ago that
you could have a face to face
conversation with someone on the other
side of the planet, they would have
thought you were mad but today we have

Skype and video calls.
Our grandparents would never have
imagined a world where just about
everything could be ordered by clicking
on a few sites online. Who knows what
our future will be like and who knows
what role a TOR network might play in
that?
Concerns About Privacy
Privacy is something that is hard to come
by in the modern world. News breaks
instantly across the world and is
discussed many times over. In minutes

news on social media and from there it
spreads virally. This can be a good
thing.
But, on a personal level, our own
privacy 
has 
never 
become 
more
precious. Social media makes it all but
impossible to keep secrets anymore.
I’ll cite an incident from my own life as
an example. My brother and his ex-wife
have a very acrimonious relationship.
The same can be said of her and the rest
of our family. She has blocked all
members of the family from her
Facebook page.

Anyway, the one weekend my nephew
was visiting, I posted a picture of him on
my Facebook page – only to have her
comment on it. I didn’t even realize she
would see it and I didn’t want her
commenting. Now, I have since changed
my privacy settings but it made it very
clear that privacy has taken on a new
meaning now.
Despite the fact that I was not connected
to her on Facebook on a one-to-one
level, she was connected through a third
person and so had access to my news.

So, yes, I can understand the increased
desire for privacy. I can understand why
people would want to work within the
TOR network.
The TOR network is a tool like any
other. It can be used for good or evil,
just like any other. As and of itself, it is
neither good nor evil, it really depends
on how you use it.
Do services like this have a future on the
internet where just about everything is
monitored? Yes, because people do have
some desire for privacy.

Will it be misused? Of course, there are
always people who will look for an easy
answer.
Can it be a tool for great good? The
answer, again, is yes. Think to a few
years ago when Egypt cut off all access
to the internet for its people. Think about
countries where it is illegal to access
general information because of extreme
censorship.
And think of the possibilities for a low
cost communication system that can truly
be deemed private. Think about surfing
the web without worrying about how all

your personal data is being used for
marketing purposes.
The internet has proven to be a source of
great information and the deep web can
help with this. All that is needed is to
introduce some sort of regulation to it so
that those misusing the system can be
brought to book.
Used responsibly, the deep web is a
very powerful tool.

Conclusion
 
The idea of exploring unknown territory
is exciting but there is so much more that
you gain from the TOR network.
Designed 
to 
facilitate 
unfettered
communication, this allows you to truly
experience online freedom.
 
How you use that freedom is up to you
but I hope that you look on this as a great
opportunity.
 
Learning about the TOR network and

having my own forays into the deep web
was an eye-opening experience for me.
And it was all a lot easier than I could
ever have imagined.
I hope that this book has given you the
confidence to explore on your own and
that you are now willing to look around
the deep web for yourself.

Introduction 
 
Have you always wondered about how 
hacking works? In the movies it seems 
so simple. All you need is some basic 
information and some kickass software 
and you can hack any network you like. 
 
In reality, it’s not quite as simple as that. 
Successful hacking is a combination of 
using the right tools, a well-planned 
strategy and applying some basic 
common sense.
 

In this book, we will go step by step 
through strategies that work and over the 
tools you will need to become a 
successful hacker. 
We’ll wade through the lingo used by 
hackers and teach you how you can get 
your hands on the information that you 
need to hack different systems. 
We go through applications and software 
that make the task a lot easier for you 
and how you can determine what 
passwords are being used. 
We end off with a short lesson on 

wireless hacking. 
By the time we are done, you will have 
the skills you need to hack the networks 
that you want to. 
And, what if you don’t want to use these 
newly acquired skills to acquire 
information illegally? Ethical hackers 
are a subset of hackers that utilize their 
skills to pinpoint weaknesses in security 
systems. They can show companies 
whether or not their systems are 
vulnerable. 
Perhaps this is something that you can 

start to do – for yourself or your own 
company. Learning to think like a hacker 
does will help you to ensure that your 
own computer network is as secure as 
possible.

Chapter 1
 
How Hacking Works
 
There is something of a mystique about
hackers that the world finds interesting.
Hackers are portrayed by Hollywood as
the cool kid version of geeks. They are
portrayed as rebels who break into
systems just to prove that they can. As
non-conformists.
 
No information is safe from this
Hollywood portrayal of cool kids. All

they have to do is to run a piece of
software 
or 
to 
punch 
out 
some
commands on the keyboard to gain
access 
to 
even 
the 
most 
secure
information.
The truth is that it is not quite that
simple. Hackers in the real world have
to find ways to exploit weaknesses in the
security systems of the networks that
they are trying to hack.
They have to be able think both laterally
and logically to get around top-flight
security systems.

The good news is that it is not that hard
to learn to become a hacker. You don’t
have to be the Hollywood rebel or the
geeky teenage genius to be able to do so.
You can learn to think like a hacker and
learn what tools they use. You can use
this information to either get up to
mischief on your own or to help secure
your own private network. The choice is
yours.
Understanding Hackers

The first step is to start understanding
what kinds of hackers there are. People
get into hacking for a range of different
reasons. 
The 
first 
step 
towards
understanding hackers is to understand
what kind of hacker they are.
Hackers – A Basic Classification
White Hat Hackers: People who
have no intention of actually causing
harm or stealing information fall
under this category. For the most part,
hackers that fall under this category
will work in the security industry,

testing systems for vulnerability.
They look at how easy a system is to
hack and work out ways to increase
the protection for the system. They
will usually ask for permission from
the owner of the systems that they
plan to hack before they start to attack
it. If you have good intentions when it
comes to hacking, it is important that
you get permission from the system
owners before going ahead. Not
doing so can land you in hot water.
Black Hat Hackers: Hackers that
fall into this category are generally
out 
to 
cause 
harm 
or 
steal
information. They may aim to cause

damage to the system by deleting
important information as a purely
malicious act. They might also look
to steal information that they can
profit from – such as credit card
numbers. One particularly nasty black
hat trick is to take over control of a
system and prevent the rightful users
from accessing it. They then make the
system owners pay them to restore
control. When people say that you
need to protect yourself against
hackers, these are the hackers that
they are referring to.
Gray Hat Hackers: Like everything
else in life, there are various shades

between black and white. This kind
of hacker usually gets into it out of
curiosity or just to prove that they
can. They hack without malicious
intent and without any desire to act in
any manner that is illegal. (Apart
from the hack itself, of course.) These
hackers often also turn their skills
towards 
helping 
system 
owners
protect themselves against black hat
hackers. The lines fudge a little
because they might hack systems
without anyone’s express consent for
reasons of their own.

What Skills You Need as a
Hacker
Skilling yourself as a hacker means that
you need to understand how computer
systems 
operate. 
This 
means 
an
extensive knowledge of programming,
operating systems and networking. It
means getting to grips with the major
operating systems in use, such as
Windows and Linux.
Hackers need to have an above-average
grasp of these topics because hacking
will often mean finding workarounds in

different types of systems.
And you will need to keep up with the
latest developments in the field as well.
Whenever new software comes out, you
will need to understand how it works so
that you can pinpoint a weakness in it
and fully understand how it operates.
Ideally speaking, you need to have a
mind that loves problem-solving and you
also need staying power, curiosity and
perseverance.
Hacking into systems means having to
find loopholes in coding and this can be

a painstaking and incredibly boring
process at times. It could mean poring
over pages of code to find a small
weakness that can be exploited.
Hacking Jargon
Hackers have their own lingo and you
need to learn some of it if you intend to
successfully fit into this world.
Here are some common terms that you
will need to know:

Exploit: Refers to a technology or
tool that helps you to take advantage
of system glitches, bugs and other
vulnerabilities. Essentially an exploit
is an abbreviated code string that lays
the weaknesses in the system bare.
They can be used to give you admin
privileges, 
access 
you 
are 
not
allowed to have, or to cut off access
to authorized users. They are usually
the first step that black hat hackers
will try. Hackers will usually be able
to write their own code in this regard
but don’t worry too much if you
cannot do the same. There are a lot of
programs out there that offer generic
exploits that you can use instead.

Threat: A threat is something that
may be used by a hacker to violate
the security of a digital system.
Hackers who are involved in shoring
up security systems will make a point
of looking out for these. These again
can be highly personalized by the
hacker 
and 
are 
fundamentally
intended to breach a system.
Vulnerability: This is what a hacker
dreams of. A gap in the code, or
glitch in the design that makes it
possible for them to get in. This
could be in the coded software, in the
base design or in the implementation

of 
the 
program 
itself. 
These
vulnerabilities allow hackers to
access the system as and when they
please.
Target of Evaluation: When you
hear this term, it is referring to the
system that is going to be under attack
or that needs to be analyzed. Hackers
evaluate the T.O.E. in order to see if
there are any weaknesses that may be
exploited. They also look for data
that makes it easier to break into the
system or to crack passwords.
Depending on what type of hacker
you are, this could be to obtain
confidential data such as account

numbers, etc. or it could be used to
find ways to repair the system and
make it less vulnerable to attack.
White hat hackers will look for ways
to prevent black hat hackers from
accessing the system.
Attack: If the system is under
attack, it means that it has been
compromised as a result of the
vulnerabilities within it. The hacker
has studied the T.O.E. and found a
vulnerability. They may then have
written and exploit to take advantage
of this error. This is why research is
so important. The research phase is
where the hacker is going to spend

most of their time – they need to
identify vulnerabilities that they can
take advantage of and this can take a
while.
How Do I Get an Exploit to
the Targeted System?
There are basically two different
approaches when it comes to delivering
exploits. These include:
Via Remote Access: In this instance, it
is not even necessary to be in direct

contact with the targeted system. You can
send the exploit to any member within
the network and gain access that way.
This is a remote hack and the type of
hack that we expect most hackers would
use.
Via Local Access: This is a little more
difficult because it means that you need
to have had access to the targeted system
at some stage in time. It is, however, the
method that most seasoned hackers will
employ – it is easier to move around in a
system that you already have had access
to. This is also why people working at
companies have only enough access to
the systems to allow them to do their job

properly. Should they try to change or
delete data that falls outside of their
ambit, they would be unable to do so.
This system can be effective at reducing
the chances of a local exploit. It should
also be stated here that the majority of
hacks end up being traced to individuals
working within the targeted company.
This kind of internal hack means getting
as much access to the systems as
possible, 
and 
even 
building 
your
privilege level so that you have more
access.
