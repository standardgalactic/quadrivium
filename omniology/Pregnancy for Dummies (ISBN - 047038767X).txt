Introduction
I
t’s ironic that this book is called Pregnancy For Dummies, because the 
whole idea behind it is that couples today aren’t dummies (in the tra-
ditional sense) and are quite capable of understanding complex medical 
information when it’s presented clearly. Our goal, in fact, has been to write a 
scientifically correct, comprehensive guide to what is one of the most memo-
rable experiences in anyone’s life — pregnancy. The For Dummies books are 
known for being accurate and informative, yet easy to read. That’s why we 
found this format to be the perfect one in which to present the medical facts 
of pregnancy and still acknowledge, and even encourage, the humor and 
light-heartedness that are part of the miraculous process of having babies.
About This Book
We know from our experience caring for thousands of women at Mount Sinai 
Medical Center in New York City that prospective parents are truly interested 
in and curious about everything related to pregnancy, from when the baby’s 
heart is formed to whether eating sushi or dyeing your hair is okay. In this 
book, we incorporate our responses to many commonly asked questions. 
Our approach to some of the more controversial ones is to provide answers 
based on real, medically based data. We make sure to provide not just the 
party-line answer, or the safe answer, but the response that is based on the 
medical literature. Sometimes, no solid data exist to indicate whether some-
thing is safe or unsafe, and when this is the case, we tell you.
Too often, our patients come to us incredibly worried about something they’ve 
read in another book that is either outdated, lacks any real scientific basis, 
or is exaggerated way out of proportion. Sometimes, other pregnancy books 
present info in such a way as to be alarmist, or they’re not properly in perspec-
tive. The trouble is that pregnant women are, by nature, already anxious about 
whether anything they do or eat may hurt the baby. The guiding principle of our 
approach has been to put all the facts into perspective and not to create need-
less anxiety or fear. Pregnancy should be a joy, not a worry. A big part of our 
philosophy in writing this book is to reassure pregnant women whenever medi-
cally possible, rather than to add to the unnecessary worries they already have.
Our experience has shown us that prospective parents also want to know 
about the real medical aspects of pregnancy. When are fingers developed? 
What blood tests should be done, and why? What options are available for 
detecting various problems? In addressing these topics, we have attempted to 
write a book that is essentially a medical text on obstetrics for the layperson.

2
Pregnancy For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
We are practicing obstetricians who are also board certified in the subspe-
cialty of maternal-fetal medicine (high-risk pregnancies), and we also teach 
residents, medical students, and other doctors about pregnancy and prenatal 
care. So we came into this project with a certain amount of expertise. Also, we 
consulted many of our colleagues in areas of medicine outside obstetrics — in 
pediatrics, internal medicine, and anesthesia, for example. For many topics, we 
conducted comprehensive searches of the medical literature to make sure the 
information we provide is based on the most recent studies available. Working 
with Mary Duenwald on the text has been enormously helpful in making sure 
that the medical information we provide is comprehensible to someone who 
isn’t in the medical field. In addition, as a mother of twins, Mary has been able 
to provide her own unique insight into various aspects of pregnancy.
In most pregnancy books, the father of the baby is, sadly, overlooked. We 
think that’s a shame. Dads are, of course, welcome to read any part of the 
book that interests them (or that the Mom-to-be directs them to), but we also 
include insightful commentary that is intended specifically for dads.
We designed Pregnancy For Dummies, 3rd Edition, to be used gradually, as 
you enter into each stage of pregnancy. Many women are curious about 
what lies ahead and may want to read the whole book right off the bat. But 
the information is organized in such a way that you can take things week by 
week, if you want. You can also consult it as needed if you run into some par-
ticular question or problem.
We trust that you will use this book as a companion to regular medical care. 
Perhaps some of the information in it will lead you to ask your practitioner 
questions that you may not otherwise have thought to ask. Because there isn’t 
always just one answer or even a right answer to every question, you may find 
that your practitioner holds a different point of view than we do in some areas. 
This difference of opinion is only natural, and, in fact, we even occasionally 
disagree with each other. The bottom line is that this book provides a lot of 
factual information, but it is not “gospel.” Remember, also, that many topics we 
discuss apply to pregnancy in general, but your particular situation may have 
unique aspects to it that warrant different or extra consideration.
What’s New in This Edition
Writing this book was very much like giving birth to a baby. It took a lot of 
planning, discovering, labor, and love and resulted in tremendous pride and 
joy for the two of us. However, it has now been four years since the birth 
of our second edition of Pregnancy For Dummies, and we felt it was time for 
another go-round. Medicine, and specifically the field of obstetrics, is chang-
ing constantly. In order to keep up with the latest trends and medical news, 
we have updated and revised the information for this third edition.

3
 Introduction
As in previous editions, the information is organized in trimesters, because 
that’s the traditional way of thinking about pregnancy. But in this edition, we 
have also given you a week-by-week account of what’s going on and what you 
should do.
As in the first two editions, we rely on scientific data rather than opinion 
or hearsay. Recent medical research has answered some earlier questions, 
helping us to give better care to pregnant women. For example, we’ve added 
new information about revised dietary recommendations from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. Societal and cultural trends that affect us all also 
affect pregnant women. Topics like Botox and thimerisol weren’t important 
issues when we wrote the first edition, but we discuss them in this edition 
because they come up more frequently today. Most importantly, we have 
listened to our patients’ comments and suggestions for a third edition, and 
incorporated many of those ideas into this book.
Conventions Used in This Book
Understanding a few conventions that we use in this book can be helpful 
when you’re reading it.
We try to be respectful of the fact that although traditional husband-wife 
couples still account for the majority of expectant parents, babies are born 
into many different circumstances. These circumstances may involve single 
parents, same-sex couples, adoptive parents, or pregnancies that involve sur-
rogacy. The bottom line is that the information we present is pertinent and 
useful to people in many different situations.
We also realize that obstetricians aren’t the only health professionals who 
help women through pregnancy. (See Chapter 2 for specific descriptions of 
the many kinds of professionals who can play a major role in helping women 
through pregnancy and childbirth.) That is why, in many cases, we refer to 
your pregnancy professional as your “practitioner.” In some cases, we do 
specify “doctor,” but usually only when we describe a situation that clearly 
calls for the services of a physician.
What You’re Not to Read
Any text in a sidebar, those lightly gray shaded boxes, or any text preceded 
by a Technical Stuff icon contains information for the very curious and offers 
deeper, usually scientific or (of course) technical explanations of topics. 
These nuggets of information may be of interest to you, or they may not, but 
rest assured that you can safely skip them and still find everything you need 
to know about pregnancy.

Pregnancy For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and what your 
needs may be:
 
✓ You may be a woman who is considering pregnancy, planning to have a 
baby, or already pregnant.
 
✓ You may be the partner of the mother-to-be.
 
✓ You may know and love someone who is or plans to be pregnant.
 
✓ You want to find out more about pregnancy but have no interest in 
becoming an expert on the topic.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Pregnancy For Dummies, 3rd Edition, gives 
you the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
The parts and chapters of this book represent a logical flow of information 
about the pregnancy process. However, you don’t have to read it in order. 
You can pick up this book, thumb through it and read what stands out, or 
look up specific topics in the table of contents or index. Check out the follow-
ing sections for a more detailed overview.
Part I: The Game Plan
Sure, some women still become pregnant “accidentally.” But for many women 
these days, pregnancy is a conscious choice. Planning ahead is a good idea — 
even seeing your practitioner before you conceive. Even if it’s already too late 
to plan that far ahead, this part of the book fills you in on what’s happening to 
your body during the first days and weeks of pregnancy. In this part, you can 
also find out what happens at a prenatal visit. And you can view the general 
scope of what your life will be like for the next 40 weeks.
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts
Like all good narratives, pregnancy has a beginning, a middle, and an end. 
They’re called trimesters. The way you feel and the kind of care you need vary 
with each stage. In this part, you get an idea of how each trimester unfolds. 
You can also find a new chapter where we tell you what is happening on a 
week-by-week basis.

5
 Introduction
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, 
Delivery, and Recovery
After you’ve put in your nine months, it’s time for the flurry of activity that 
results in the birth of your baby. At this point, a lot is going on in a short 
time. Your experience depends heavily on what kind of delivery you have and 
how long it takes. This part covers the basic scenario of labor, delivery, and 
recovery — plus many possible variations on the theme.
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
In a way, it would be nice if we didn’t have to have a section about problems 
that come up during pregnancy. Ideally, every woman’s experience would 
be perfectly trouble-free. On the other hand, many of the difficulties that can 
arise need not develop into full-blown problems if they are properly taken 
care of. For this reason, we offer information about how to deal with anything 
that may come up. This part is the one to consult if you think you’re having 
any kind of difficulty, from the serious to the mundane. Here you find informa-
tion about all kinds of special concerns that you may have as new parents — 
from practical challenges like how to introduce older siblings to the new baby, 
to health problems that sometimes arise during pregnancy.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is standard in all For Dummies books. Here, you find ten bits 
of info people don’t tell you about being pregnant, ten healthy snacks you can 
eat when you’re pregnant, and how you can view your baby on ultrasound.
Icons Used in This Book
Like other For Dummies books, this one has little icons in the margins to 
guide you through the information and zero in on what you need to find out. 
The following paragraphs describe the icons and what they mean.
 
This icon signals that we’re going to delve a little deeper than usual into a 
medical explanation. We don’t mean to suggest the information is too difficult 
to understand — just a little more detailed.
 
We flag certain pieces of information with this icon to let you know something 
is particularly worth keeping in mind.

6
Pregnancy For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
 
This icon marks bits of advice we give you about handling some of the minor 
discomforts and other challenges you encounter during pregnancy.
 
Throughout this book, we try to avoid being too alarmist, but there are some 
situations and actions that a pregnant woman clearly should avoid. When this 
is the case, we show you the Caution icon.
 
Many things you may feel or notice while you’re pregnant beg the question, “Is 
this important enough for my practitioner to know about?” When the answer 
is yes, you see this icon.

We know from experience that pregnancy can bring out the instinct to worry. 
Feeling a little anxious from time to time is normal, but some women go over-
board working themselves up over things that really aren’t a problem. We use 
this icon — more than any other one — to point out the countless things that 
you really need not fret about.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re the particularly thorough type, go ahead and read this book from 
cover to cover. If you just want to find specific information and then close the 
book, take a look at the table of contents or at the index. Dog-ear the pages 
that are especially interesting or relevant to you. Write little notes in the mar-
gins. Have fun and, most of all, enjoy your pregnancy!

Par t I
The Game Plan

In this part . . .
“I
’m not sure I’m ready for this” is a normal reaction 
to finding out that you’re pregnant, no matter how 
long you’ve been thinking about having a baby and no 
matter how long you’ve been trying to conceive. Suddenly 
you’re faced with the reality that your body is about to 
undergo some profound changes and a baby is going to 
take shape inside you. Well, you may not feel ready, but 
preparing is easy enough. Ideally, your preparation begins 
with a visit to your doctor a few months before you con-
ceive. But even if you’re not that far ahead of the game, 
this part tells you some of the many ways you can plan 
ahead for the very important, very interesting next nine 
months (plus).

Chapter 1
From Here to Maternity
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out your health and family history
▶ Preparing your body for pregnancy
▶ Understanding the effects of medications and vaccines
▶ Making it happen: Conception made easy
C
ongratulations! If you’re already pregnant, you’re about to embark upon 
one of the most exciting adventures of your life. If you’re thinking about 
getting pregnant, you’re probably excited at the prospect and also a little ner-
vous at the same time.
In this chapter, we go over what you need to know before you conceive. 
(We also provide some information on medications and vaccines that those 
who are already pregnant may be interested in, too.) The first step is to visit 
your practitioner and go over your family and personal health history. That 
way, you can discover whether you’re in optimal shape to get pregnant, or 
whether you need to take some time to gain or lose weight, improve your 
diet, quit smoking, or discontinue medications that could be harmful to your 
pregnancy. We also give you some basic advice about the easiest way to con-
ceive, and we touch on the topic of infertility.
Getting Ready to Get Pregnant: 
The Preconceptional Visit
By the time you miss your period and discover you’re pregnant, the embryo, 
now two weeks old or more, is already undergoing dramatic changes. Believe 
it or not, when the embryo is only two to three weeks old, it has already 
developed the beginnings of its heart and brain. Because your general health 
and nutrition can influence the growth of those organs, having your body 
ready for pregnancy before you conceive really pays off. Schedule what’s 
called a preconceptional visit with your practitioner to be sure your body is 
tuned up and ready to go.

10
Part I: The Game Plan 
Sometimes you can schedule this visit during a routine gynecological 
appointment: When you go in for your annual PAP test, mention that you’re 
thinking about having a baby, and your practitioner will take you through the 
preliminaries. If you aren’t due for your annual exam for several more months 
and you’re ready to begin trying to get pregnant now, go ahead and schedule 
a preconceptional visit with your practitioner, and bring along the father-to-
be, if at all possible, so both of you can provide health histories — and know 
what to expect from this adventure.

If you’re already pregnant and didn’t have a preconceptional visit, don’t 
worry. Your practitioner will go over these topics at your first prenatal visit, 
which we discuss in Chapter 5.
Taking a look at your history
The preconceptional visit is a chance for your practitioner to identify areas 
of concern so she can keep you and your baby healthy — even before you get 
pregnant. A multitude of factors come into play, and the practitioner is likely 
to ask you about the following:
 
✓ Previous pregnancies and gynecologic history: Information about previ-
ous pregnancies can help your practitioner decide how best to manage 
your future pregnancies. You’ll be asked to describe any prior pregnan-
cies, any miscarriages or premature births, any multiple births — in 
short, any situations that can happen again. Knowing whether you had 
problems in the past, like preterm labor or high blood pressure, is help-
ful for the practitioner. Your gynecologic history is equally important 
because information like prior surgery on your uterus or cervix or a 
history of irregular periods also may influence your pregnancy.
 
✓ Your family history: Reviewing your family’s medical history alerts your 
practitioner to conditions that may complicate your pregnancy or be 
passed on to the developing baby. You want to discuss your family his-
tory because you can take steps before you conceive to decrease the 
chance that certain disorders, such as having a family history of neural 
tube defects (spina bifida, for example), will affect your pregnancy (see 
the sidebar “Why the sudden hype on folic acid?” later in this chapter). 
In Chapter 8, we discuss in more detail different genetic conditions and 
ways of testing for them.
 
 For those of you considering the use of donor eggs or sperm, keep in 
mind that the donor’s genetic history is just as important as any other 
biological parent’s. Find out as much as you can.

11
 Chapter 1: From Here to Maternity
 
✓ Looking at your ethnic roots: Your preconceptional visit involves ques-
tions about your parents’ and grandparents’ ancestry — not because 
your practitioner is nosy, but because some inheritable problems are 
concentrated in certain populations. Again, the advantage of finding out 
about these problems before you get pregnant is that if you and your 
partner are at risk for one of these problems, you have more time to 
become informed and to check out all your options (see Chapter 5).
Evaluating your current health
Most women contemplating pregnancy are perfectly healthy and don’t have 
problems that can have an impact on pregnancy. Still, a preconceptional visit 
is very useful because it allows you to make a game plan and find out more 
about how to optimize your chances of having a healthy and uncomplicated 
pregnancy. You can discover how to reach your ideal body weight and how 
to start on a good exercise program, and you can begin to take prenatal vita-
mins with folic acid.
Some women, however, do have medical disorders that can affect the preg-
nancy. Expect your practitioner to ask whether you have any one of a list 
of conditions. For example, if you have diabetes, optimizing your blood 
sugar levels before you get pregnant and watching those levels during your 
pregnancy are important. If you’re prone to high blood pressure (hyperten-
sion), your doctor will want to control it before you get pregnant, because 
controlling hypertension can be time-consuming and can involve changing 
medications more than once. If you have other problems — epilepsy, for 
example — checking your medications and controlling your condition are 
important. For a condition like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), your 
practitioner may encourage you to try to become pregnant at a time when 
you’re having very few symptoms.
You can expect questions about whether you smoke, indulge in more than 
a drink or two a day, or use any recreational/illicit drugs. Your practitioner 
isn’t interrogating you and is unlikely to chastise you, so you can feel com-
fortable answering honestly. These habits can be harmful to a pregnancy, 
and dropping them before you get pregnant is best. Your practitioner can 
advise you on ways to do so or refer you to help or support groups.
You also need to discuss any prescription or over-the-counter drugs you take 
regularly and your diet and exercise routines. Do you take vitamins? Do you 
diet frequently? Are you a vegetarian? Do you work out regularly? Discuss all 
these issues with your practitioner.

12
Part I: The Game Plan 
If you haven’t had a recent physical exam or PAP smear, your practitioner will 
probably recommend that you have it done during this preconceptional visit.
Answering Commonly Asked Questions
Your preconceptional visit is a time for you to ask your practitioner ques-
tions. In this section, we answer the most common questions — about body 
weight, medications, vaccinations, and quitting birth control.
Getting to your ideal body weight
The last thing most women need is another reason to be concerned about 
weight control. But this point is important: Pregnancy goes most smoothly 
for women who aren’t too heavy or too thin. Overweight women stand 
a higher-than-normal risk of developing diabetes or high blood pressure 
during pregnancy, and they’re more likely to end up delivering their babies 
via cesarean section. Underweight women risk having too-small (low birth-
weight) babies.
Why the sudden hype on folic acid?
Folic acid was something your mother never 
thought about when she was expecting you. But 
within the past decade, folic acid has become a 
nutritional requirement for all pregnant women. 
The change came in 1991, when a British medi-
cal study demonstrated that folic acid (also 
known as folate, a nutrient in the B vitamin 
family) reduced the recurrence of birth defects 
of the brain and spinal cord (also called neural 
tube defects). This reduction — by as much as 
80 percent — occurred in cases where a moth-
er’s previous child was affected. Subsequent 
studies have shown that even among women 
who have never had children with brain or spinal 
cord defects, those who consume enough folic 
acid can lower their baby’s risk of spina bifida 
(a spinal defect) and anencephaly (a brain and 
skull defect) by 50 to 70 percent.
Today, all women who are considering preg-
nancy are advised to consume 0.4 milligrams of 
folate every day, starting at least 30 days before 
conception. You start early so that plenty of the 
nutrient is in your system at the time the neural 
tube is forming. If spina bifida, anencephaly, or 
similar conditions run in your family — espe-
cially if you’ve ever carried a child with these 
problems — you should get ten times the usual 
amount (4 whole milligrams) every day.
Since 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion has required that all enriched grains — 
flour, cornmeal, pasta, and rice — be fortified 
with folic acid. Other good sources include 
green leafy vegetables, beans, and liver. But 
to make sure you get the full measure, take a 
supplement. Any good prenatal vitamin gives 
you at least 0.4 milligrams.

13
 Chapter 1: From Here to Maternity
 
Try to reach a healthy, normal weight before you get pregnant. Trying to lose 
weight after you conceive isn’t advisable, even if you’re overweight. And if 
you’re underweight to begin with, catching up on pounds when the baby is 
growing may be difficult. (Read more about your ideal weight and weight gain 
in Chapter 4.)
Reviewing your medications
Many medicines — both over-the-counter and prescription — are safe to take 
during pregnancy. If you’re taking medications essential for your health, dis-
cuss them with your physician prior to stopping them or changing your dose 
or regimen. But a few medications can cause problems for the baby’s devel-
opment. So let your doctor know about all the medications you take. If one 
of them is problematic, you can probably switch to something safer. Keep in 
mind that adjusting dosages and checking for side effects may take time.
Exposure to the following drugs and chemicals is considered to be safe 
during pregnancy:
 
✓ Acetaminophen
 
✓ Acyclovir
 
✓ Antiemetics (for example, phenothiazines and trimethobenzamide)
 
✓ Antihistamines (for example, doxylamine)
 
✓ Low-dose aspirin
 
✓ Minor tranquilizers and some antidepressants (for example, meprobam-
ate, chlordiazepoxide, and fluoxetine)
 
✓ Penicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, 
and several other antibiotics
 
✓ Zidovudine
The following are some of the common medications that women ask about 
before they get pregnant:
 
✓ Birth control pills: Women sometimes get pregnant while they’re on 
the Pill (because they missed or were late taking a couple of pills during 
the month) and then worry that their babies will have birth defects. 
But oral contraceptives haven’t been shown to have any ill effects on a 
baby. Two to three percent of all babies are born with birth defects, and 
babies born to women on oral contraceptives are at no higher risk.

Part I: The Game Plan 
 
✓ Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil): Occasional use of these and other nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory agents during pregnancy (for pain or inflammation) 
is okay and hasn’t been associated with problems in infants. However, 
avoid chronic or persistent use of these medications during pregnancy 
(especially during the last trimester) because they have the potential 
to affect platelet function and blood vessels in the baby’s circulatory 
system, and because your baby’s kidneys process them just like your 
own kidneys do.
 
✓ Vitamin A: This vitamin and some of its derivatives can cause miscar-
riage or serious birth defects if too much is present in your bloodstream 
when you get pregnant. The situation is complicated by the fact that 
vitamin A can remain in your body for several months after you con-
sume it. Discontinuing any drugs that contain vitamin A derivatives — 
the most common is the anti-acne drug Accutane — at least one month 
before trying to conceive is important. Scientists don’t know whether 
topical creams containing vitamin A derivatives — anti-aging creams like 
Retin A and Renova, for example — are as problematic as drugs that you 
swallow, so consult your physician about them.
 
 Some women take supplements of vitamin A because they’re vegetar-
ians and don’t get enough from their diet, or because they suffer from 
vitamin A deficiency. The maximum safe dose during pregnancy is 5,000 
international units (IU) daily. (You need to take twice that amount to 
reach the danger zone.) Multiple vitamins, including prenatal vitamins, 
typically contain 5,000 IU of vitamin A or less. Check the label on your 
vitamin bottle to be sure.

 If you’re worried that your prenatal vitamin plus your diet will put you 
into that “danger zone” of 10,000 IU per day, rest assured that it would 
be extremely difficult to get that much vitamin A in your diet.
 
✓ Blood thinners: Women who are prone to developing blood clots or who 
have artificial heart valves need to take blood-thinning agents every day. 
One type of blood thinner, coumadin, or its derivatives can trigger miscar-
riage, impair the baby’s growth, or cause the baby to develop bleeding 
problems or structural abnormalities if taken during pregnancy. Women 
who take this medicine and are thinking of getting pregnant should switch 
to a different blood thinner. Ask your practitioner for more information.
 
✓ Drugs for high blood pressure: Many of these medications are con-
sidered safe to take during pregnancy. However, because a few can be 
problematic, you should discuss any medications to treat high blood 
pressure with your doctor (see Chapter 17).
 
✓ Antiseizure drugs: Some of the medicines used to prevent epileptic sei-
zures are safer than others for use during pregnancy. If you’re taking any 
of these drugs, discuss them with your doctor. Don’t simply stop taking 
any antiseizure medicine, because seizures may be worse for you — and 
the baby — than the medications themselves (see Chapter 17).

15
 Chapter 1: From Here to Maternity
 
✓ Tetracycline: If you take this antibiotic during the last several months of 
pregnancy, it may, much later on, cause your baby’s teeth to be yellow.
 
✓ Antidepressants: Many antidepressants (like Prozac) have been studied 
extensively and are considered safe during pregnancy. Recent studies 
on selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) showed a small increase 
in certain birth defects, particularly with paroxetine, while other studies 
showed no increased risk. Most doctors believe that the absolute risk 
is very small. Although most data doesn’t show an increase in prematu-
rity or low birth weight, some data suggests a possible small increased 
chance of miscarriage in the first trimester. Some reports also show a 
very small risk (0.6 to 1.2 percent) of a newborn condition called per-
sistent pulmonary hypertension with exposure in the latter half of preg-
nancy. If you’re taking an antidepressant and planning to conceive, ask 
your doctor whether you’ll be able to keep taking the medication while 
you’re pregnant.
 
✓ Bupropion: Bupropion is an antidepressant, but also a medicine used 
for smoking cessation (for example, Wellbutrin or Zyban). Very little info 
exists on use during pregnancy, but the available data doesn’t suggest 
any significant problems with fetal development. Although you shouldn’t 
use it as a first line for depression, its use for smoking cessation may be 
beneficial.
Considering nutritional supplements
Many women choose to treat common ailments with over-the-counter plant 
extracts or other natural medications. Some are considered completely safe 
during pregnancy, but keep in mind that, because they are considered nutri-
tional supplements, these agents are not regulated by the FDA. Despite the 
fact that many pregnant women use these supplements, very few studies 
have evaluated their safety or shown that they actually give a benefit during 
pregnancy. Many of these pills are also unregulated for dose, so one pill may 
contain twice as much as the next. Some of these supplements are combina-
tions of different herbs or extracts and the interactions are unknown and 
unstudied. St John’s wort, for instance, is an herb commonly used to treat 
depression, sleep disorders, and viral infections. Not only can this herb inter-
act with other medications, but also, its safety/benefit during pregnancy has 
not been studied, so use it with caution.
 
Some herbal medications should not be used during pregnancy because they 
can cause uterine contractions or even miscarriage. A short list of agents 
that are not recommended during pregnancy includes mugwort, blue cohosh, 
tansy, black cohosh, Scotch broom, goldenseal, juniper berry, pennyroyal oil, 
rue, mistletoe, and chaste berry.

Part I: The Game Plan 
Recognizing the importance of 
vaccinations and immunity
People are immune to all kinds of infections, for one of two reasons:
 
✓ They’ve suffered through the disease. Most people are immune to 
chickenpox, for example, because they had it when they were kids, caus-
ing their immune systems to make antibodies to the chickenpox virus.
 
✓ They’ve been vaccinated. That is, they’ve been given a shot of some-
thing that causes the body to develop antibodies.
Rubella is a common example. Your practitioner checks to see whether 
you’re immune to rubella (also known as German measles) by drawing a 
sample of blood and checking to see whether it contains antibodies to the 
rubella virus. (Antibodies are immune system agents that protect you against 
infections.) If you are not immune to rubella, your practitioner is likely to rec-
ommend that you be vaccinated against rubella at least three months before 
becoming pregnant. Getting pregnant before the three months are over is 
highly unlikely to be a problem. No cases have been reported of babies born 
with problems due to the mother having received the rubella vaccine in early 
pregnancy. Many vaccines, including the flu vaccine, are safe, and in fact rec-
ommended, while you’re pregnant. See Table 1-1 for information on several 
vaccines.
Most people are immune to measles, mumps, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria, 
and your practitioner is unlikely to check your immunity to all these ill-
nesses. Besides, these illnesses aren’t usually associated with significant 
adverse effects for the baby. Chickenpox, on the other hand, does carry a 
small risk that the baby can contract the infection from her mother. If you’ve 
never had chickenpox, tell your practitioner, so you can discuss possible vac-
cination before you get pregnant.
Finally, if you’re at risk of HIV infection, get tested before contemplating preg-
nancy. Some states now require that doctors discuss and offer HIV testing to 
all pregnant women. If you have contracted HIV, taking certain medications 
throughout pregnancy will decrease the chances that your baby also will 
contract HIV.
A vaccine has recently been made available for the human papilloma virus 
(HPV), the virus associated with some kinds of abnormal pap smears, genital 
warts, and cervical cancer. Studies suggest that it’s similar to other vaccina-
tions that are safe in pregnancy; just to be extra careful, wait at least 30 days 
after the shot before attempting pregnancy.

Quitting birth control
How soon can you get pregnant after you stop using birth control? It depends 
on what kind of birth control you use. The barrier methods — such as con-
doms, diaphragms, and spermicides — work only as long as you use them; 
as soon as you stop, you’re fertile. Hormone-based medicines — including 
the Pill, Depo-Provera, NuvaRing, and the birth control patch (for example, 
Ortho-Evra) — take longer to get out of your system. You may ovulate very 
shortly after stopping the Pill (weeks or days, even). Usually, hormones from 
pills aren’t detectable several days after the last active Pill or the last patch. 
On the other hand, it can take three months to one year to resume regular 
ovulatory cycles after stopping Depo-Provera.

19
 Chapter 1: From Here to Maternity
We know of no hard-and-fast rules about how long you should wait after stop-
ping birth control before you start trying to conceive. In fact, you can start 
to try to conceive right away. If you’re Fertile Myrtle, you may get pregnant 
on the first try. But keep in mind that if you haven’t resumed regular cycles, 
you may not be ovulating each month, and it may be more difficult to time 
your intercourse to achieve conception. (At least you can have a good time 
trying!) If you get pregnant while your cycles are irregular, it also may be 
harder to tell exactly what day you conceived and, therefore, to know your 
due date.

If you use a non-hormone intrauterine device (IUD), you can get pregnant as 
soon as you have it removed. With hormone containing intrauterine devices 
or with sub-dermal implantable devices, fertility may take 3 to 12 months to 
resume after removal. Rarely, a woman conceives with her IUD in place. If 
this happens to you, your practitioner may choose to remove the device, if 
possible, because getting pregnant with your IUD in place puts you at risk of 
miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that gets stuck in the fallopian 
tube), or early delivery. Getting pregnant with an IUD in place more than likely 
doesn’t put the baby at increased risk of birth defects.
Knowing when to see a doctor about infertility
Infertility, or sub-fertility, is a problem that is 
affecting more couples than ever before, as 
people wait longer and longer to have children. 
One in ten couples older than 30 has trouble con-
ceiving. After age 35, the ratio is one in five. Of 
course, age isn’t a problem for everyone. Some 
women reportedly get pregnant even in their 
50s. (According to Guinness World Records, the 
world’s oldest spontaneously pregnant mother 
was 571/2 when she conceived.) But face it: 
Spontaneous pregnancy in a woman’s late 40s 
and 50s is rare.
When should you seek a doctor’s help? 
Generally, after you’ve been trying unsuccess-
fully to get pregnant for six months to a year. 
But if you have a history of miscarriages or 
difficulty conceiving, if you’re older than 35, 
or if you already know that your partner has 
a low sperm count, you may want to get help 
before six months are up. No matter what your 
situation, don’t despair. Reproductive technolo-
gies become more sophisticated — and more 
successful — with each passing year. At this 
point, couples can try various techniques with 
complicated-sounding names — ovarian stim-
ulation with fertility medications, intrauterine 
insemination (with or without sperm washing), 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection, use of donor 
sperm or donor eggs, and in vitro fertilization 
(and its many variations) — depending on their 
particular cause of infertility. For a couple that 
has trouble conceiving right away, chances are 
better than ever that they will eventually become 
pregnant. Check out Infertility For Dummies by 
Jackie Meyers-Thompson and Sharon Perkins 
(Wiley) for more information. If you’re having 
trouble getting pregnant and you’re not sure 
whether it’s time to see an infertility specialist, 
discuss it with your practitioner.

Part I: The Game Plan 
Introducing Sperm to Egg: 
Timing Is Everything
This book’s title notwithstanding, we’re going to assume that you know the 
basics of how to get pregnant. What many people don’t know, though, is how 
to make the process most efficient, so that you give yourself the best chance 
of getting pregnant as soon as you want to. To do that, you need to think a 
little about ovulation — the releasing of an egg from your ovary — which 
happens once each cycle (usually once per month).
After leaving the ovary, the egg spends a couple of days gliding down the fal-
lopian tube, until it reaches the uterus (also known as the womb). Most often, 
pregnancy occurs when the egg is fertilized within 24 hours from its release 
from the ovary, during its passage through the tube, and the budding embryo 
then implants in the uterus’s lining. (See Figure 1-1 for a quick look at the ana-
tomical aspects.) In order to get pregnant, your job (and the father-to-be’s) is 
to get the sperm to meet up with the egg as soon as possible (ideally, within 
12 to 24 hours) after ovulation.

The absolute prime time to have sex is 12 hours prior to ovulation. Then the 
sperm are in place as soon as the egg comes out. Sperm are thought to live 
inside a woman’s body for 24 to 48 hours, although some have been known 
to fertilize eggs when they are as much as seven days old. No couple should 
count on getting pregnant on the first try. On average, you have a 15 to 25 
percent chance each month. Roughly half of all couples trying to get pregnant 

21
 Chapter 1: From Here to Maternity
conceive within four months. By six months, three-fourths of them make it; by 
a year, 85 percent do; and by two years, the success rate is up to 93 percent. 
If you’ve been trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a year or more, a fertility 
evaluation is warranted.
Pinpointing ovulation
So when does ovulation happen? Typically, about 14 days before you get 
your period. If your menstrual cycles are 28 days long, that’s 14 days after 
the first day of your previous period. If you have a 32-day cycle, you probably 
ovulate on about the 18th day of your cycle. (Each cycle begins on the first 
day of a period.) To make sure that you get the sperm in the right place at 
the right time, have sex several times around the time of ovulation, starting 
five days before you expect to ovulate and continuing for two to three days 
afterward. How often? Once every two days is probably adequate. Having sex 
daily or more often can cause the sperm count to drop a little in some men.

Doctors once thought that having sex daily would result in a lower sperm 
count and reduce fertility. However, later medical studies found that this idea 
is true only in men who have a lower-than-normal sperm count to start with.
Monitoring your basal body temperature
Some women find that they can pinpoint their time of ovulation more easily if 
they keep track of their temperature, which rises close to the time of ovulation. 
To do this, you take your temperature (orally) each morning before you get out 
of bed and before having anything to eat or drink. It typically reaches its lowest 
point right before your pituitary gland releases luteinizing hormone (LH), which 
triggers ovulation. Two days after the so-called LH surge, your temperature 
rises significantly — about a half to one degree above baseline — and stays 
elevated until you get your period. (If you get pregnant, it remains high.) You 
may want to invest in a special basal body temperature thermometer (sold in 
most drugstores) because it has larger gradations and is easier to read.
 
Remember that a rise in your basal body temperature indicates that ovulation 
has already occurred. It doesn’t predict when you will ovulate, but it does con-
firm that you’re ovulating and gives you a rough idea of when ovulation occurs 
in your cycle. Doing so can help you time intercourse for your next cycle, 
which should be approximately the day before you think you ovulate. Reading 
the signals can be hard because not all women follow the same pattern. Some 
never see a distinct drop in temperature, and some never see a clear rise.
Using an ovulation predictor kit
Another way to monitor the LH surge is to use a home ovulation predictor 
kit, which tests the amount of LH in urine. As opposed to basal body temper-
ature (see the preceding section), the LH surge is useful in predicting when 
ovulation will occur during any given cycle. A positive test for any cycle tells 

22
Part I: The Game Plan 
you that you’re ovulating and when. In general, these kits are very accu-
rate and effective. The main drawback is the expense. At $15 to $30 per kit, 
they’re more expensive than taking your temperature, especially if you have 
to check several cycles to find out when you’re ovulating.
Another way of checking for ovulation is available, which involves testing 
saliva instead of urine. The increased estrogen levels that occur around the 
time of ovulation cause the saliva to form a crystallized pattern upon drying, 
which can be seen with a special microscope. Both the urine tests and saliva 
tests are equally accurate (up to 98 percent) at predicting ovulation. The 
saliva kit costs about $35 and is reusable.
You can also check when ovulation is occurring by evaluating your own cer-
vical mucus. Just prior to ovulation, it changes to a wet or egg-white consis-
tency. The benefit to checking ovulation this way is that it doesn’t cost you 
any money!
Taking an effective (and fun) approach
In most cases, parents-to-be are well advised to just relax and enjoy the pro-
cess of trying to conceive. Don’t get too anxious if it doesn’t happen right off 
the bat. We often tell our patients: Think about stopping birth control a few 
months before you actually plan on getting pregnant. This way, you have 
some carefree months of enjoying great sex without worrying each month 
about whether you’re pregnant. And if you do conceive ahead of schedule, 
enjoy the nice surprise!
 
You can take a few steps to improve your chances of conceiving:
 
✓ If you smoke cigarettes or marijuana or are on any illegal substance, quit.
 
✓ Avoid using K-Y Jelly or other commercial lubricants during sex, 
because they may contain spermicide. (Try olive oil or vegetable oil 
instead.)
 
✓ Limit your caffeine intake. Drinking more than three cups of coffee per 
day may decrease your chances of conceiving.
 
✓ If you’re overweight, get on a smart carb, low-fat diet, exercise regularly, 
and work on a weight-loss plan. If you’re unsure as to how much you’ll 
need to exercise to lose weight on your diet, a physician, dietician, and/
or personal trainer can be helpful.

 Chapter 1: From Here to Maternity
Everything every dad wants to know about sex
One of the most common questions that dads 
ask is about sex during pregnancy. Your desire 
for sex — like that of your partner — may 
increase or decrease. Many men worry that 
inserting the penis into the vagina, next to the 
cervix, may injure the baby or lead to preterm 
delivery. In an uncomplicated pregnancy, you 
have nothing to worry about at all in this regard. 
Another common worry is that you may crush 
the baby by lying on top of your partner. Again, 
if the pregnancy is normal, being on top isn’t a 
problem (especially during the first months). A 
cushion of amniotic fluid surrounds the baby. 
Later on in pregnancy, the size of the mother’s 
abdomen may make the missionary position 
awkward, or your partner may find it uncom-
fortable. If she is willing, take the time to find 
alternative positions that are comfortable for 
her. Also, remember that libido can wax and 
wane during pregnancy, or it may wane only 
(see Chapter 3). For some women, pregnancy is 
just a sexual turnoff. So try to be understanding 
if your partner isn’t interested in sex.
In some cases, intercourse during pregnancy 
may not be a good idea. If the mother goes into 
preterm labor, for example, and her cervix is 
open significantly, refraining may be wise. In 
the case of placenta previa with bleeding (see 
Chapter 16) and in some cases of incompetent 
cervix (see Chapter 6), foregoing intercourse 
also makes sense. If your partner has one of 
these problems or if you’re unsure about your 
partner’s situation, talk to her practitioner. And 
keep in mind that intercourse isn’t the only way 
that you and your partner can express your 
sexual feelings for each other. Often, embrac-
ing, cuddling, or fondling can be satisfying 
alternatives. Remember, pregnancy (and the 
possible interruption in your sex life) won’t last 
forever, even though you may sometimes feel 
like it will.

I Think I’m Pregnant!
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what symptoms to be on the lookout for
▶ Getting the answer to that all-important question: Are you pregnant?
▶ Finding a healthcare practitioner to meet your needs
▶ Calculating your due date
S
o you think you may be pregnant! Or maybe you’re hoping to become 
pregnant soon. Either way, you want to know what to look for in the 
early weeks of pregnancy so that you can know for sure as soon as possible. 
In this chapter, we take a look at some of the most common signals that your 
body sends you in the first weeks of pregnancy, and offer advice for confirm-
ing your pregnancy and getting it off to a great start.
Recognizing the Signs of Pregnancy
So assume it has happened: A budding embryo has nestled itself into your 
womb’s soft lining. How and when do you find out that you’re pregnant? 
Quite often, the first sign is a missed period. But your body sends many other 
signals — sometimes even sooner than that first missed period — that typi-
cally become more noticeable with each passing week.
 
✓ Honey, I’m late! You may suspect that you’re pregnant if your period 
hasn’t arrived as expected. By the time you notice you’re late, a preg-
nancy test will probably yield a positive result (see the upcoming sec-
tion, “Determining Whether You’re Pregnant,” for more on pregnancy 
tests). Sometimes, though, you may experience one or two days of light 
bleeding, which is known as implantation bleeding, because the embryo 
is attaching itself to your uterus’s lining.

26
Part I: The Game Plan 
 
✓ You notice new food cravings and aversions. What you’ve heard about 
a pregnant woman’s appetite is true. You may become ravenous for 
pickles, pasta, and other particular foods, yet turn up your nose at foods 
you normally love to eat. No one knows for sure why these changes 
in appetite occur, but experts suspect that these changes are, at least 
partly, nature’s way of ensuring that you get the proper nutrients. You 
may find that you crave bread, potatoes, and other starchy foods, and 
perhaps eating those foods in the early days is actually helping you 
store energy for later in pregnancy, when the baby does most of its 
growing. As with any other time in life, though, be careful not to overeat. 
You may also be very thirsty early in pregnancy, and the extra water 
you drink is useful for increasing your body’s supply of blood and other 
fluids.
 
✓ Your breasts become tender and bigger. Don’t be surprised by how 
large your breasts grow early in pregnancy. In fact, large and tender 
breasts are often the first symptom of pregnancy that you feel because 
very early in pregnancy, levels of estrogen and progesterone rise, caus-
ing immediate changes in your breasts.
Determining Whether You’re Pregnant
Well, are you or aren’t you? These days, you don’t need to wait to get to your 
practitioner’s office to find out whether you’re pregnant. You can opt instead 
for self-testing. Home tests are urine tests that give simply a positive or nega-
tive result. (By the way, these tests are very accurate for most people.) Your 
practitioner, on the other hand, may perform either a urine test similar to the 
one you took at home or a blood test to find out whether you’re pregnant.
Joanne’s story
One day a couple of years after my first daugh-
ter was born, I found myself heading to the gro-
cery store to buy pickles and ketchup, intent on 
mixing them together to make a lovely, tasty, 
green-and-red meal. I was craving it so much 
that it didn’t even occur to me what an odd dish 
it is. In fact, it wasn’t until I had cleaned up the 
dishes that I realized that pickles and ketchup 
had been my only craving during the early 
months of my first pregnancy. I had no other 
reason to think I was pregnant again; I hadn’t 
even missed a period. But the next morning I 
tested myself, and sure enough, it was time for 
round two.

27
 Chapter 2: I Think I’m Pregnant!
Getting an answer at home
Suppose you notice some bloating or food cravings, or you miss your period 
by a day or two. You want to know whether you’re pregnant, but you aren’t 
ready to go to a doctor yet. The easiest, fastest way to find out is to go to the 
drugstore and pick up a home pregnancy test. These tests are basically simpli-
fied chemistry sets, designed to check for the presence of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG, the hormone produced by the developing placenta) in your 
urine. Although these kits aren’t as precise as laboratory tests that look for 
hCG in blood, in many cases they can provide positive results very quickly — 
by the day you miss your period, or about two weeks after conception.
 
The results of home pregnancy tests aren’t a sure thing. If your test comes out 
negative but you still think you’re pregnant, retest in another week or make an 
appointment with your doctor.
Going to your practitioner for answers
Even if you had a positive home pregnancy test, most practitioners want to 
confirm this test in their office before beginning your prenatal care. Your 
practitioner may decide to simply repeat a urine pregnancy test or to use a 
blood pregnancy test instead.
A blood pregnancy test checks for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in 
your blood. This test can be either qualitative (a simple positive or negative 
result) or quantitative (an actual measurement of the amount of hCG in your 
blood). The test your practitioner chooses depends on your history and your 
current symptoms and on his own individual preference. Blood tests can be 
positive even when urine tests are negative.
Selecting the Right Practitioner for You
Finding the right practitioner to care for you (and your baby) is a decision 
you don’t want to take lightly. Your healthcare is always important, but your 
new and sometimes overwhelming condition means you want a practitio-
ner who’s in sync with your approach to pregnancy. This person should be 
someone you trust and feel safe with. You may already have a practitioner if 
you’ve had a previous child. If not, no need to feel overwhelmed. This section 
helps you make this important decision.

✓ Obstetrician/gynecologist: This physician has four years of special 
training in pregnancy, delivery, and women’s health. He should be 
board certified (or be in the process of becoming board certified) by the 
American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (or an equivalent pro-
gram if you’re from a country other than the United States).
 
✓ Maternal-fetal medicine specialist: Also known as a perinatologist or 
high-risk obstetrician, this type of doctor has completed a two- to three-
year fellowship in the care of high-risk pregnancies, in addition to the 
standard obstetrics residency, to become board certified in maternal-
fetal medicine. Some maternal-fetal medicine specialists act only as con-
sultants, and some also deliver babies.
 
✓ Family practice physician: This doctor provides general medical care 
for families — men, women, and children. He is board certified in family 
practice medicine. This kind of doctor is likely to refer you to an obste-
trician or maternal-fetal medicine specialist if complications arise during 
your pregnancy.
 
✓ Nurse-midwife: A nurse-midwife is a registered nurse who is certified in 
the care of pregnant women and is also licensed to perform deliveries. A 
certified nurse-midwife typically practices in conjunction with a physi-
cian and refers patients to a specialist when complications occur.
Weeks versus months
Most of us think of pregnancy as lasting nine 
months. But face it — 40 weeks is a little longer 
than nine times four weeks. It’s closer to ten 
lunar months (in Japan, they actually speak 
of pregnancy as lasting ten months) and a bit 
longer than nine 30-to-31-day calendar months. 
That’s why your doctor is more likely to talk in 
terms of weeks.
Because you start counting from the date of the 
last menstrual period, the count actually begins 
a couple of weeks before you conceive. So 
when your doctor says you’re 12 weeks preg-
nant, the fetus is really only ten weeks old!

 Chapter 2: I Think I’m Pregnant!
Asking questions before you choose
Before you make a decision, you want to be complete and thorough in your 
search. Make sure you know what you want out of the experience. When 
you’re deciding on a practitioner, ask yourself the following key questions:
 
✓ Am I comfortable with and do I have confidence in this person? You 
should trust and feel at ease not only with your practitioner but also with 
the whole constellation of people who work in the practice. Would you 
feel free to ask questions or express your anxieties to them? Another 
point to keep in mind is how your general personality fits in with the prac-
tice’s philosophy. For example, some women prefer a low-key, low-tech 
approach to prenatal care, while others want to have every possible diag-
nostic test under the sun. Your past medical and obstetrical history can 
also influence the approach you take to your pregnancy.
 
✓ How many practitioners are involved in the practice? You may end 
up choosing between a practitioner who works with one or more part-
ners and one who is in solo practice. Many group practices rotate you 
through appointments with each of the doctors, getting to know them all 
so that you feel comfortable having any one of them deliver your baby. 
Practically speaking, you’re likely to bond more with one or two people 
in the practice than with others, which is natural, given that most 
women and most practitioners have many varied personalities. A practi-
tioner who practices alone should tell you who handles deliveries when 
he is ill, off duty, or out of town.
Determining whether you’re at high risk
The question of whether you and your preg-
nancy are at high risk has no black-and-white 
answer, especially at the beginning. But it helps 
to be aware of the kinds of situations (which 
you may either have or develop) that can put a 
pregnancy at high risk:
 ✓ Diabetes
 ✓ High blood pressure
 ✓ Lupus
 ✓ Blood disorders
 ✓ Heart, kidney, or liver disorders
 ✓ Twins, triplets, or other multiple fetuses
 ✓ A premature delivery in a prior pregnancy
 ✓ A previous child with birth defects
 ✓ A history of miscarriage
 ✓ An abnormally shaped uterus
 ✓ Epilepsy
 ✓ Some infections
 ✓ Bleeding
Remember that midwives and most family prac-
tice physicians are not equipped to handle high-
risk pregnancies. If you have or develop any of 
the above conditions, consult an obstetrician or 
a high-risk specialist.

30
Part I: The Game Plan 
 
 Ask your practitioner about his policy for after-hours problems or 
emergencies — including questions you may need to ask by telephone 
during evening or weekend hours.
 
✓ What hospital is the practitioner affiliated with? If your pregnancy is 
uncomplicated, any good hospital or birthing center will work just fine. 
If you’re at risk of some complications, you may want to ask whether the 
hospital you’ll be delivering in has a labor and delivery suite and a nurs-
ery equipped to handle any problems that may arise if, for example, the 
baby is born early. You may also want to ask the following questions:
 
• Is an anesthesiologist on-site 24 hours a day, or can your doctor 
call in an anesthesiologist quickly in case of an emergency?
 
• Can the hospital provide you with epidural anesthesia (a form of 
pain control during labor)? If epidural anesthesia isn’t readily avail-
able, or you’re not interested in this form of pain relief, find out 
what other options are available for pain management.
 
• Are you allowed to room in — that is, keep the baby in your room 
as much as possible — after delivery? Also, are accommodations 
available for your partner to stay with you during your postpartum 
hospitalization?
 
✓ Can this practitioner refer you to a nearby specialist if needed? 
Consider whether you may need the services of a maternal-fetal medi-
cine specialist or a neonatologist, a physician who specializes in the 
care of infants who are born early or who have other medical problems. 
Ideally, your practitioner can refer you to someone quickly if anything 
comes up.
 
✓ Will my insurance plan cover this practitioner? Now that managed 
care has become an important part of the health insurance industry, 
check to see whether your plan covers your practitioner of choice. Some 
places allow you to select an “out-of-network” physician if you pay part 
of the cost yourself.
Calculating Your Due Date
Only 1 in 20 women actually delivers on her due date — most women deliver 
anywhere from three weeks early to two weeks late. Nonetheless, pinpointing 
the due date as precisely as possible is important in order to ensure that the 
tests you need along the way are performed at the right time. Knowing how 
far along you are also makes it easier for your doctor to see that the baby is 
growing properly.
The average pregnancy lasts 280 days — 40 weeks — counting from the 
first day of the last menstrual period. Your due date — what doctors once 
referred to as the EDC, for estimated date of confinement (in the old days, 

31
 Chapter 2: I Think I’m Pregnant!
women were actually “confined” to the hospital around the time of their 
delivery) — is calculated from the date on which your last menstrual period 
(LMP) started.
If your cycles are 28 days long, you can use a shortcut to determine your 
due date. Simply subtract three months from your LMP and add seven days. 
If your last period started on June 3, for example, your due date would be 
March (subtract three months) 10 (add seven days). If your periods don’t 
follow 28-day cycles, don’t worry. You can establish your due date in other 
ways. If you’ve been tracking ovulation and can pinpoint the date of concep-
tion, add 266 days to that date (the average time between the first day of 
your LMP and ovulation is about 14 days or 2 weeks).
If you’re unsure of the date of conception or the date your last period started, 
an ultrasound exam during the first three months can give you a good idea of 
your due date. A first-trimester ultrasound predicts your due date more accu-
rately than a second- or third-trimester one.
 
You can also use a pregnancy wheel to calculate how far along you are. To use 
this handy tool, line up the arrow with the date of your last menstrual period 
and then look for today’s date. Just below the date you see the number of 
weeks and days that have gone by. (If you know the date of conception, rather 
than your last period, there is a line on the wheel corresponding to this, too.)
Debunking old wives’ tales
Pregnancy has a certain mystique. Millions of 
women have been through it, yet predicting in 
detail what any one woman’s experience is 
going to be like is difficult. Perhaps that’s why so 
many myths have formed (and survived) over the 
centuries, most of which are designed to foresee 
the unknowable future. Here are twelve tales 
that, alas, are really nothing but nonsense:
 ✓ The Old Heartburn Myth: If a pregnant 
woman frequently experiences heartburn, 
her baby will have a full head of hair. Simply 
not true. Some babies have hair; some 
don’t. Most lose it all within a few weeks, 
anyway.
 ✓ The Mysterious Umbilical Cord Movement 
Myth: If a pregnant woman lifts her hands 
above her head, she will choke the baby. 
Give us a break. People used to think (and, 
alas, some still believe) that the mother’s 
movement could cause the baby to become 
tangled in the umbilical cord, but that’s just 
not true.
 ✓ The Curse Myth: Anyone who denies a 
pregnant woman the food that she craves 
will get a sty in his eye. Nope. This myth 
doesn’t mean that someone who stands 
between a pregnant woman and her crav-
ing is in the clear, though: He will most cer-
tainly be subjected to threats, name-calling, 
or icy glares, but no sties.
 ✓ The Heart Rate Myth: If the fetal heart rate is 
fast, the baby is a girl, and if the heart rate is 
slow, the baby is a boy. Medical research-
ers actually looked into this myth. They did 
find a very slight difference between the 
average heart rate of boys and that of girls, 
but it wasn’t significant enough to make 
heart rate an accurate predictor of sex.

32
Part I: The Game Plan 
 ✓ The Ugly Stick Myth: If a pregnant woman 
sees something ugly or horrible, she will 
have an ugly baby. How could this possibly 
be true? There’s no such thing as an ugly 
baby!
 ✓ The Java Myth: If a baby is born with cafe 
au lait spots (light-brown birthmarks), the 
mother drank too much coffee or had unful-
filled cravings during her pregnancy. Nope.
 ✓ The Myth of International Cuisine: Many 
people still believe that eating spicy food 
brings on labor. It doesn’t, but it may be an 
effective marketing tool: We know of an 
Italian restaurant that advertises its Chicken 
Fra Diavolo as a surefire labor inducer. The 
dish may be delicious, but it simply can’t bring 
on labor. Nope. Niet. Nunca. Nein. Non.
 ✓ The Great Sex Myth: Having passionate sex 
brings on labor. What got you into this mess 
will also get you out? That’s just wishful 
thinking, but go ahead and try it (if you feel 
like it when you’re nine months pregnant). 
It’s likely to be worth the effort.
 ✓ The Round Face Myth: If a pregnant woman 
gains weight in her face, the baby is a girl. 
And the corollary myth says that if a woman 
gains weight in her butt, the baby is a boy. 
Neither statement is true, obviously enough. 
The baby’s sex has no influence whatso-
ever on the way the mother stores fat.
 
 Another seemingly related myth is that if the 
mother’s nose begins to grow and widen, 
the baby is a girl. The so-called reasoning 
here is that a daughter always steals her 
mother’s beauty. Strange concept — and 
quite untrue.
 ✓ The Moon Maid Myth: This one holds that 
more women go into labor during a full 
moon. Although many labor and delivery 
personnel insist that the labor floor is busier 
during a full moon (police say their precinct 
houses are livelier then, too), the scientific 
data just doesn’t support the idea.
 ✓ The Belly Shape Myth: If a pregnant wom-
an’s belly is round, the baby is a girl, and 
if the woman’s belly is more bullet-like, it’s 
a boy. Forget about it. Belly shape differs 
from woman to woman, but the child’s sex 
has nothing to do with it.
 ✓ The Ultrasound Tells All Myth: Ultrasound 
can always tell the baby’s sex. Nope, not 
always. Often, by about 18 to 20 weeks 
gestation, seeing a fetus’s genitalia on 
ultrasound is possible. But being able 
to determine the baby’s sex depends on 
whether the baby is in position to give you 
a good view. Sometimes the sonographer 
can’t see between the uncooperative 
baby’s legs and therefore can’t determine 
the sex. Sometimes, too, the sonographer 
may be wrong, especially if the ultrasound 
is done very early in the pregnancy. So 
even though you can find out the baby’s 
sex through ultrasound in most cases, it’s 
not 100 percent guaranteed.

Pregnancy
In This Chapter
▶ Walking through a typical prenatal visit
▶ Coping with changes in mind and body
▶ Modifying your lifestyle for baby’s sake
▶ Working while you’re pregnant
E
ven though you’re pregnant and your body is already undergoing 
miraculous changes, your day-to-day life goes on. How will you need to 
change your lifestyle in order to make your pregnancy go as smoothly as pos-
sible? What things in your life don’t need to change, or need to be modified 
only slightly? You have a lot to consider: your job, the general level of stress 
in your life, what medications you take, whether you smoke or drink alcohol 
regularly, and what to do about routine things like going to the dentist or 
hairdresser. If you’re like most normally healthy women, you’ll probably find 
that for the most part, your life can go on largely as usual.
 
All the issues we mention are subjects for discussion with your practitioner. 
But in this chapter and the next, we offer a general outline for how to plan 
your life during pregnancy. If you consider from the beginning how your daily 
habits and health practices interact with your pregnancy, you’re likely to have 
an easier time getting used to your new state of being. The earlier you get 
started on the right diet, exercise, and overall health program, the better (see 
Chapter 4 for more).
Planning Prenatal Visits
Your positive pregnancy test marks a new beginning. The time has come to 
start thinking about what lies ahead. After you decide who your practitioner will 
be (check out Chapter 2), give the office a call to find out how to proceed. Some 

34
Part I: The Game Plan 
practices want you to come in for a visit with the office nurse to give a medical 
history and confirm your good news with either a blood or urine test, whereas 
others schedule a first visit with the practitioner. How soon your first visit will 
be scheduled depends in part on your past or current history. If you didn’t have 
a preconceptional visit (see Chapter 1) beforehand, and you haven’t been on 
prenatal vitamins or other vitamins containing folic acid, let the office know. A 
prescription for prenatal vitamins can be called in so you can start taking them 
even before your first prenatal visit. All over-the-counter adult multi- and pre-
natal vitamins should have the correct dose of folic acid so the typical patient 
doesn’t need a prescription for them, but ask the pharmacist if you’re not sure.
Some things are consistent from trimester to trimester — like checking your 
blood pressure, urine, and the baby’s heartbeat — so we cover these topics 
in this chapter. In Chapters 5, 6, and 7, we go over the specifics of what hap-
pens during prenatal visits for each trimester. See Table 3-1 for an overview 
of a typical schedule for prenatal visits.

Typical Prenatal Visit Schedule

36 weeks to delivery
Weekly
If you develop problems during pregnancy or if your pregnancy is considered 
“high risk” (see the risk factors we describe in Chapter 2), your practitioner 
may suggest that you come in more frequently.
 
This schedule of prenatal visits isn’t set in stone. If you’re planning a vacation 
or need to miss a prenatal visit, tell your practitioner and reschedule your 
appointment. If your pregnancy is going smoothly, rescheduling usually isn’t a 
big deal. However, because some prenatal tests have to be performed at spe-
cific times during pregnancy (see Chapters 8 and 9 for details), just make sure 
that missing an appointment won’t affect any of these tests.
Prenatal visits vary a bit according to each woman’s personal needs and each 
practitioner’s style. Some women need particular laboratory tests or physical 
examinations. However, the following procedures are standard during your 
prenatal visits:

35
 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
 
✓ A nurse checks your weight and blood pressure. For more information 
on how much weight you should be gaining and when, see Chapter 4.
 
✓ You give a urine sample (usually an easy job for most pregnant 
women!). Your practitioner checks for the presence of protein or glu-
cose, which may be a sign of preeclampsia or diabetes (see Chapters 16 
and 17). Some urine tests also enable your doctor to look for any indica-
tions of a urinary tract infection.
 
✓ Starting sometime after 14 to 16 weeks, a nurse or doctor measures 
your fundal height. The practitioner uses either a tape measure or her 
hands to measure your uterus. This gives her a rough idea of how the 
baby is growing and whether you have an adequate amount of amniotic 
fluid (see Figure 3-1).
 
 The nurse or doctor is measuring the fundal height, the distance from 
the top of the pubic bone to the top of the uterus (the fundus). By 20 
weeks, the fundus usually reaches the level of the navel. After 20 weeks, 
the height in centimeters roughly equals the number of weeks preg-
nant you are. (Being above or below by 2 centimeters is usually within 
acceptable norms as long as you’re consistent from visit to visit.)
 
 Note: The fundal height measurement may not be useful in women who 
are expecting two or more babies or in women who have large fibroids 
(in both cases, the uterus is much bigger than normal) or in women who 
are very obese (because it can be difficult to feel the top of the uterus).
 
✓ A nurse or doctor listens for and counts the baby’s heartbeat. 
Typically, the heartbeat ranges between 120 and 160 beats per minute. 
Most offices use an electronic Doppler device to check the baby’s heart-
beat. With this method, the baby’s heartbeat sounds sort of like horses 
galloping inside the womb. Sometimes, you can hear the heartbeat as 
early as 8 or 9 weeks using this method, but often it isn’t clearly discern-
ible until 10 to 12 weeks. Prior to the availability of Doppler, a special 
stethoscope called a fetoscope was used to hear the baby’s heartbeat. 
Using this method, the doctor can hear the heartbeat around 20 weeks. 
A third way of checking the baby’s heartbeat is by seeing it on ultra-
sound. The heart can frequently be seen at around six weeks.
 
In some practices, a medical assistant or nurse performs tasks such as check-
ing your blood pressure; in other practices, a doctor may perform this task. 
No matter who performs the technical components of the prenatal visit, you 
should always have the opportunity to ask a practitioner questions before 
leaving the office.

Preparing for Physical and 
Emotional Changes
When you’re pregnant, your body is undergoing transformation. You can 
expect to experience changes, such as mood swings, leg cramps, and stress. 
You’ve probably experienced these conditions before — just not with such 
intensity. The following sections cover these and other problems and let you 
know what you may be in for. Have your family and friends read these sec-
tions, too — then tell them to consider themselves forewarned.
Coping with mood swings
Hormonal shifts affect mood, as most women, especially those who suffer 
from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), already know. The hormonal fluctua-
tions that support pregnancy are perhaps the most dramatic a woman 
experiences in her lifetime, so it’s hardly surprising that emotional ups and 

37
 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
downs are commonplace. And the fatigue that goes along with pregnancy can 
easily make these ups and downs more severe. Add to this biochemical mix 
the normal anxieties that the average expectant mother has about whether 
the baby will be healthy and whether she’ll be a good mother, and you have 
plenty of fuel to produce good, old-fashioned mood swings.
 
You’re not alone. Moodiness is a normal part of pregnancy, and you’re not the 
first or only woman to experience it. So don’t blame yourself. Your family and 
friends will understand.
Your moodiness may be especially pronounced during the first trimester 
because your body is adjusting to its new condition. You may find yourself 
overreacting to little things. A silly, mushy television commercial, for exam-
ple, may leave you in tears. Misplacing your appointment book may send 
you into a panic. A grocery store clerk who accidentally smashes your loaf of 
bread may draw you into a teeth-clenching rage. Don’t worry — you’re just 
pregnant. Take a few deep breaths, go out for a walk, or just close your eyes 
and take a short break. These feelings often pass as quickly as they arise.
Living through leg cramps
Leg cramps are a common annoyance of pregnancy, and they’re likely to 
become more frequent as the months go along. They’re due to a sudden 
tightening of the muscles. The muscles may tighten for many different rea-
sons, including lack of fluids, muscle strain, or staying in one position for too 
long. Doctors once thought that leg cramps were due to too little calcium or 
potassium in the diet, although that has not been shown to be true. Some 
studies suggest that taking an oral magnesium supplement may reduce leg 
cramps.
 
To diminish leg cramps, you may want to try one of these suggestions:
 
✓ Apply heat to the calves.
 
✓ Drink plenty of fluids.
 
✓ Avoid staying in one position too long.
 
✓ Stretch and extend your legs and feet.
 
 Do your stretching nightly before bed. Point your toes up toward the 
ceiling to really stretch your calves out. Do this about ten times. In the 
morning, get in the habit of doing this stretching at least a couple of 
times, before you even open your eyes if possible. Try to avoid extend-
ing your feet when you first wake up to avoid triggering a spasm.
 
✓ Take a short walk.
 
✓ Ask your partner to give you a foot or leg massage.

38
Part I: The Game Plan 
Noticing vaginal discharge
During pregnancy, your vaginal discharge normally increases substantially. 
Some women find that they need to wear thin panty liners every day. The dis-
charge tends to be thin, white, and virtually odorless. Vaginal douches aren’t 
a good idea because they may alter a woman’s natural ability to fight off vagi-
nal infections.
 
If your vaginal discharge takes on a brown, yellow, or green color, or if it 
develops a noxious odor or causes itching, let your practitioner know. (Be 
sure to use your judgment about how much of an emergency this is — it isn’t 
the sort of problem that requires a 3 a.m. phone call to her office.)
Pregnancy doesn’t prevent you from getting a vaginal infection, and the high 
levels of estrogen in your blood may predispose you to developing a yeast 
infection. A yeast infection usually produces a thick, white-yellow discharge, 
and it may, in some cases, cause itchiness or redness. Topical vaginal creams 
should solve the problem, and they pose no risk to the fetus. Most over-the-
counter preparations come in 1-, 3-, and 7-day dosages and are completely 
safe for the baby. For hard-to-beat yeast infections, talk with your doctor 
about oral fluconazole, which may be used safely in pregnancy.
Putting up with backaches
Backaches are a common symptom that many women experience during 
pregnancy. They typically occur in the latter part of pregnancy, although 
they can occur earlier. The shift in your center of gravity can be one cause. 
Another can be the change in the curvature of your spine as the baby grows 
and the uterus enlarges. You may get some relief by getting off of your feet 
when you can, applying mild local heat, and taking acetaminophen (Tylenol). 
Our patients often ask us about using a specially designed pregnancy girdle 
that they’ve seen advertised or heard about. Although some patients say this 
girdle helps, others don’t think so.
Some women experience pain extending from their lower back to their but-
tocks and down one leg or the other. This pain, or less commonly, numbness, 
is known as sciatica, which is due to pressure on the sciatic nerve, a major 
nerve that branches from your back, through your pelvis, to your hips, and 
down your legs. You can relieve mild cases of sciatica with bed rest, warm 
baths, or heating pads. If you develop a severe case, you may need prolonged 
bed rest or special exercises.
 
Occasionally, preterm labor can present itself as low back pain. However, 
when it’s preterm labor, the pain is more cramp-like and it comes and goes, 
rather than being continuous.

39
 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
Handling stress
Many women wonder whether stress has any effect on pregnancy. That ques-
tion is difficult to answer because stress is such an elusive concept. We all 
know what stress is, but each woman seems to handle it in her own way, and 
no one can really measure its intensity. We do know that chronic stress — 
unrelieved day after day — can increase the levels of stress hormones circulat-
ing in the bloodstream. Many doctors think that such elevated levels of stress 
hormones can promote preterm labor or blood pressure problems during 
pregnancy, but few studies have been able to prove this idea.
 
While you’re pregnant, pay attention to your own personal comfort and hap-
piness. Everyone has her own way of relaxing — whether it’s by getting a 
massage, going to a movie, having dinner with friends, taking a hot shower or 
bubble bath, or just sitting back and putting her feet up. Take the time you 
need to be good to yourself.
Understanding the Effects of 
Medications, Alcohol, and 
Drugs on Your Baby
Alcohol and recreational/illicit drugs can cross the placenta and get into your 
baby’s circulatory system. Some medications can also cross the placenta. 
Some are completely harmless, whereas others can cause problems. The fol-
lowing sections outline which substances you can safely use and which you 
should avoid — information that’s crucial to your baby’s health.
Taking medications
During your pregnancy, you’ll probably experience at least a headache or 
two and an occasional case of heartburn. The question of whether you can 
safely take pain relievers, antacids, and other over-the-counter medicines is 
bound to come up. Many women are afraid to take any medicine at all, for 
fear of somehow harming their babies. But most nonprescription drugs — 
and even many prescription drugs — are safe during pregnancy. During your 
first prenatal visit, go over with your practitioner what medications are okay 
to take during pregnancy — both over-the-counter medications and medica-
tions prescribed to you by another physician. If another physician is treating 
you for a medical condition, let her know that you’re pregnant, in case any 
adjustments need to be made.

40
Part I: The Game Plan 
 
Don’t stop taking a prescription medication or change the dosage on your own 
without talking to your doctor first.
Many medications are labeled “Don’t take during pregnancy” because they 
haven’t been adequately studied in pregnant women. However, this warning 
label doesn’t necessarily mean that adverse effects have been reported or 
that you can’t use these medications. Whenever you have a question about a 
particular medication, ask your practitioner for advice. Don’t be surprised if 
opinions vary among practitioners, especially between non-obstetric medical 
people and obstetricians. Many non-obstetricians are hesitant to prescribe 
many medications because they’re uncertain, whereas your obstetric practi-
tioner may be more secure.
 
Certain medical problems, such as high blood pressure, pose more risk to 
the growing fetus than the medication you would take to treat it does. Even a 
common headache, if it’s bad enough to cause you to miss a traffic signal when 
you’re behind the wheel, can be more dangerous than a little acetaminophen 
(Tylenol), which actually isn’t dangerous at all when taken in therapeutic doses. 
The fact is that we find many pregnant women suffer needlessly with common 
symptoms that could be treated with medications that are safe for the baby.
In Chapter 1, we list many of the drugs/chemicals that are safe for most preg-
nant women to take. We also discuss some of the drugs that are known to 
have a teratogenic effect, which means they have the potential to cause birth 
defects or problems with growth and development.

If you took any teratogenic medications before you knew you were pregnant — 
or before you knew that the drugs could pose a problem — don’t panic. In 
many cases, the drugs do no harm, depending on when during pregnancy you 
took them and in what quantities. Some medications can cause problems in the 
first trimester, but are totally safe in the third trimester, and vice versa. In fact, 
relatively few substances are proven to be teratogenic to humans, and even 
those that are don’t cause birth defects every time. Discuss with your practitio-
ner the medications you’ve been taking and what tests are available to check 
on your baby’s growth and development.
You can also call or go to the Web site of a number of medical information 
services, including those in the following list, for more data about teratogenic 
substances. These services get their information from medical databases 
(also listed), so if the information you get over the phone or on the Web site 
is overly technical, ask your practitioner to interpret for you:

 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
Smoking
Unless you’ve been living on Mars for the past ten years, you no doubt are 
aware that smoking is a health risk for you. When you smoke, you run the risk 
of developing lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease, among other ill-
nesses. During pregnancy, however, smoking poses risks to your baby as well.
 
The carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke decreases the amount of oxygen that 
your growing baby receives, and nicotine cuts back on blood flow to the fetus. 
Consequently, women who smoke stand an increased chance of delivering 
babies with low birth weight, which may mean more medical problems for the 
baby. In fact, babies born to smokers are expected to weigh a half-pound less, 
on average, than those born to nonsmokers. The exact difference in birth weight 
depends upon how much the mother smokes. Secondhand smoke is also a risk.
In addition to low birth weight, smoking during pregnancy is associated with a 
greater risk of preterm delivery, miscarriage, placenta previa (see Chapter 16), 
placental abruption (see Chapter 16), preterm rupture of the amniotic mem-
branes, and even sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after the baby is born.
Quitting smoking can be extremely difficult. But keep in mind that even cut-
ting back on the number of cigarettes you smoke is beneficial to your baby 
(and yourself).
 
If you quit smoking during the first three months you’re pregnant, give your-
self a pat on the back and be reassured that your baby is likely to be born at a 
normal weight and have fewer health issues.
 
Some women use nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, or inhalers to help them 
kick the habit. The nicotine from these products is still absorbed into the 
bloodstream and can still reach the fetus, but at least the carbon monoxide 
and other toxins in cigarette smoke are eliminated. The American College of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that nicotine replacements such as 
these may be used when nonpharmacologic treatments have failed. The total 
amount of nicotine absorbed from the intermittent use of the gum or inhalers 
may be less than the amount from the patch, which is used continuously.
The effects on fetal development with the use of bupropion (Zyban or 
Wellbutrin) haven’t been extensively studied, but one well-designed study 
showed that pregnant smokers receiving bupropion were much more likely 
to quit than those not taking the medication.
Drinking alcohol
Clearly, pregnant women who use alcohol put their babies at risk of fetal 
alcohol syndrome, which encompasses a wide variety of birth defects (includ-
ing growth problems, heart defects, mental retardation, or abnormalities of 

42
Part I: The Game Plan 
the face or limbs). The controversy arises because medical science hasn’t 
defined an absolute safe level of alcohol intake during pregnancy. Scientific 
data shows that daily drinking and heavy binge drinking can lead to serious 
complications, although little info is available about occasional drinking. The 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Food and Drug 
Administration recommend avoiding any amount of alcohol.
If you think you may have a drinking problem, don’t feel uncomfortable talk-
ing to your practitioner about it. Special questionnaires are available to help 
your doctor identify whether your drinking is excessive enough to pose a risk 
to you and the fetus. If you think you may have a problem, discussing this 
questionnaire with your practitioner is crucial to your baby’s health — and 
to yours.
Using recreational/illicit drugs
Many studies have evaluated the effects of drug use during pregnancy. But 
the studies can be confusing because they tend to lump all kinds of drug 
users together, regardless of which drugs they use and how much they use. 
The mother’s lifestyle also influences the degree of risk to the baby, which 
complicates the information even more. For example, women who abuse 
drugs are more likely to be malnourished than other women, they are typi-
cally of lower socioeconomic status, and they suffer a higher incidence of 
sexually transmitted diseases. All these factors, independent of and added to 
drug use, can cause problems for your pregnancy and for your baby.
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Questions about alcohol consumption during 
pregnancy are very common, so we provide the 
answers to some of the most frequently asked 
questions:
Q: “On my Caribbean vacation, I enjoyed some 
piña coladas on the beach. I didn’t find out I 
was pregnant until a few weeks later. Will my 
baby have birth defects?”
A: No evidence exists that a single episode 
of drinking has any increased risk of adverse 
effects on pregnancy. Now that you know 
you’re pregnant, avoid alcohol.
Q: “Is hard liquor worse for the baby than wine 
or beer?”
A: They’re all considered the same risk. A can 
of beer, a glass of wine, and a mixed drink with 
one ounce of hard liquor contain roughly the 
same amounts of alcohol.
Q: “My doctor suggested I have a glass of wine 
on the evening after my amniocentesis. Is this 
okay?”
A: Alcohol is a tocolytic, which basically means 
that it relaxes the uterus. After amniocentesis, 
many women feel a little uterine cramping. The 
alcohol in a glass of wine minimizes that dis-
comfort without hurting the baby.

 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
Looking at Lifestyle Changes
Your lifestyle inevitably changes during your pregnancy. You may wonder 
whether it’s still okay to do some of the things you may have done on a regu-
lar basis before you were pregnant. This section provides information on 
activities such as whether you can safely color your hair while you’re preg-
nant, whether you can go into saunas and hot tubs, whether you can travel, 
and whether you can continue working.
Pampering yourself with 
beauty treatments
When your friends and relatives hear that you’re pregnant, they’ll probably 
tell you how beautiful you look or what a lovely maternal glow you have. And 
you may feel more beautiful, too, although some women feel the exact oppo-
site. You may find that you’re not happy with the physical changes that are 
happening to your body. Either way, if you’re like most of our patients, you 
may wonder whether your customary beauty habits are safe to follow during 
pregnancy. In this section, we go over them one by one and let you know 
about any possible risks:
 
✓ Botox: The safety of Botox therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding 
is unknown. Our advice? Enjoy the beauty from your pregnancy glow 
while you’re pregnant, and wait for the Botox.
 
✓ Injectable fillers: Injectable skin fillers are used to smooth wrinkles and 
make lips fuller. Often they’re made with collagen or hyaluronic acid. 
No good data currently exists documenting the safety of fillers during 
pregnancy. The good news is that the fluid retention of pregnancy may 
lessen the wrinkles anyway!
 
✓ Chemical peels: Alpha-hydroxy acids are the main ingredients in chemi-
cal peels. The chemicals work topically, but small amounts are absorbed 
into your system. We haven’t found any data on whether chemical peels 
are safe during pregnancy. They’re probably okay, but first discuss it 
with your practitioner.
 
✓ Facials: You may notice that your complexion has changed over the past 
few months. Sometimes pregnancy hormones can wreak havoc on your 
skin. Facials may or may not help. But go ahead and have one anyway, 
if only to enjoy the time to sit back and relax! (See the preceding com-
ments about chemical peels.)
 
✓ Hair dyes: Using hair dyes during pregnancy is probably fine. No evi-
dence suggests that hair dyes cause birth defects or miscarriage. Years 
ago, some of them contained formaldehyde and other potentially danger-
ous chemicals that could harm a baby. But the newer dyes don’t contain 

44
Part I: The Game Plan 
these chemicals. Practitioners tend to disagree on this issue. Your prac-
titioner may tell you to stick to vegetable hair dyes during pregnancy, 
while your friend’s practitioner may tell her that dyeing her hair is fine.
 
✓ Hair waxing: Waxing legs or the bikini line involves applying a heated 
wax preparation topically and then removing it along with the hair. 
Nothing in the wax preparations can lead to problems for the baby. So 
keep waxing away while you’re pregnant to help you remain carefree 
and hair-free.
 
✓ Laser hair removal: The laser used for hair removal works by transmit-
ting heat to the hair follicle and stopping hair regrowth. Often anesthetic 
creams are applied to the skin first to reduce pain. Although we couldn’t 
find specific data on laser hair removal during pregnancy, we know of 
no reason that this therapy, which is applied locally, should cause any 
problem to the baby.
 
✓ Manicures and pedicures: Another frequently asked question is: “Can I 
have a manicure/pedicure or have nail tips or acrylic nails placed while 
I’m pregnant?” Again, the answer is yes. Common sense suggests that 
you go to a reputable salon where the equipment is properly cleaned 
and the area is well ventilated.
 
✓ Massages: Massages are fine, and you’ll find that many massage thera-
pists offer special pregnancy massages aimed at accommodating your 
pregnant belly. Some use special tables with the center cut out so that 
you can comfortably lie face down, especially in the latter part of the 
pregnancy.
 
✓ Permanents: No scientific evidence suggests that the chemicals in hair 
permanents are harmful to the developing baby. These preparations 
usually do contain significant amounts of ammonia, however, so for your 
own safety, use them in well-ventilated areas.
 
✓ Thermal reconditioning: Thermal reconditioning, also known as the 
Japanese straightening technique, is a fairly new method to permanently 
straighten hair. The process involves applying a variety of chemicals 
and conditioners to the hair, and then using a flat iron to permanently 
straighten the hair. No scientific research has studied this technique 
in pregnancy. Some of the chemicals used are similar to those used for 
perming hair. The bottom line: Thermal reconditioning is likely okay 
during pregnancy, but we know of no definitive data.
 
✓ Wrinkle creams: The two most common antiwrinkle creams used today 
are Retin-A and Renova. Both of these preparations contain vitamin A 
derivatives. Substantial data exist to suggest that oral medications con-
taining vitamin A derivatives (for example, Accutane) can cause birth 
defects, but the information that’s available on topical preparations 
such as Retin-A and Renova doesn’t indicate a problem. Due to the sig-
nificant effects of oral preparations, however, many practitioners dis-
courage the use of any medications containing these compounds, oral or 
topical, to their patients.

45
 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
Relaxing in hot tubs, whirlpools, 
saunas, or steam rooms
Using hot tubs, whirlpools, saunas, or steam rooms when you’re pregnant 
can be risky because of the high temperatures involved. In laboratory ani-
mals, exposure to high levels of heat during pregnancy has been known to 
cause birth defects or miscarriage. Studies involving humans suggest that 
pregnant women whose core body temperatures rise significantly during 
the early weeks of pregnancy may stand an increased risk of miscarriage or 
having babies with neural tube defects (spina bifida, for example).
However, problems typically occur only if the mother’s core temperature 
rises above 102 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 39 degrees Celsius) for more 
than ten minutes during the first seven weeks of her pregnancy.
In general, soaking in a warm, soothing bath is fine during pregnancy. Just 
make sure that the water temperature isn’t too high, for the reasons just 
mentioned.
Common sense suggests that after the first trimester, occasionally using hot 
tubs, saunas, and steam rooms for less than ten minutes is probably okay. 
However, remember to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Traveling
The main potential problem with traveling during pregnancy is that it puts 
distance between you and your prenatal care provider. If you’re close to your 
due date or if your pregnancy is considered high-risk, you probably shouldn’t 
travel far from home. Your decision to travel, though, depends on what the 
risk factors actually are. If you have diabetes but it’s well controlled, going 
on a trip is probably okay. But if you’re pregnant with triplets, traveling to 
Timbuktu probably isn’t a good idea. If your pregnancy is uncomplicated, 
travel during the first, second, and early third trimesters is usually okay.
Traveling by car poses no special risk, aside from requiring that you sit in 
one place for a long time. On long trips, stop every couple of hours to get out 
and walk around a bit. Wear your seat belt and shoulder strap; they keep you 
safe, and they won’t hurt the baby, even if you’re in an accident. The amni-
otic fluid surrounding the fetus serves as a cushion against any constriction 
from the lap belt. Not wearing restraints clearly poses a greater risk; studies 
show that the leading cause of fetal death in auto accidents is death of the 
mother.
 
Wear your seat belt below your abdomen, not above it, and keep the shoulder 
strap in its usual position.

46
Part I: The Game Plan 
Most airlines allow women to fly if they’re less than 36 weeks pregnant, but 
you may want to carry a note from your practitioner indicating that she sees 
no medical reason why you shouldn’t fly. Flying is perfectly safe, especially if 
you take a couple of precautions:
 
✓ Get up from your seat occasionally during longer flights and walk 
around the plane. Prolonged periods of sitting can cause blood to pool 
in your legs. Walking around keeps your circulation going.
 
✓ Carry a water bottle with you and drink water frequently. Airplane 
air is always very dry. (A pilot once told us that the relative humidity in 
airplanes is typically lower than in the Sahara desert. Planes can’t carry 
enough water to keep the humidity up, because the extra water would 
add too much cargo weight.) Because airplane air is so dry, you can 
easily become dehydrated during long flights.
 
 Drinking extra water also ensures that you get up frequently to go to the 
restroom, which keeps the blood from pooling in your legs.

You don’t need to worry about airport metal detectors — or any other metal 
detectors — because they don’t use ionizing radiation. (The conveyor belt 
that carries your luggage after you check it in does use ionizing radiation, 
however, so we don’t recommend that you climb onto the counter and send 
yourself through that machine.)
 
If you’re prone to air sickness and have found Dramamine helpful in the past, 
using it in normal doses while you’re pregnant is okay.
 
If you plan to visit tropical countries, where some diseases are particularly 
prevalent, you may want to be vaccinated before you go. But check with your 
doctor to see whether any vaccines you’re considering are safe to have during 
pregnancy. (For more information on vaccines, see Chapter 1.)
Getting dental care
Most people see their dentist for routine cleanings every 6 to 12 months, 
which means you’ll probably need to visit your dentist at least once during 
your pregnancy. Pregnancy itself shouldn’t affect your dental health. You 
don’t want to avoid the dentist because neglected cavities can become 
infected, which is all the more reason to see your dentist when you’re preg-
nant. Some recent studies have shown that pregnant women who suffer from 
periodontal disease, which is infection and inflammation of the gums, are at a 
higher risk for delivering small or premature babies. This finding is one more 
reason for making good oral hygiene a priority.

47
 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
Pregnancy causes an increase in blood flow to the gums. In fact, about half of 
all pregnant women develop a condition called pregnancy gingivitis, which is 
simply a reddening of the gums caused by this increased blood flow. In this 
condition, gums have a tendency to bleed easily, so try to be gentle when you 
brush and floss your teeth.
For those of you who want whiter and brighter teeth, plenty of products 
are available, including whitening toothpastes and over-the-counter gels, 
strips, whitening systems, and trays. Although most are frequently used 
during pregnancy, no large studies document the safety of such treatments. 
Whitening toothpastes help remove surface stains without containing bleach. 
There is no reason to think they are a problem. Over-the-counter whitening 
strips, gels, and whitening systems are peroxide-based and haven’t been 
specifically studied in pregnancy. However, the safety of peroxide can be 
implied from other studies. In one such study, pregnant rats were fed up to 
10 percent hydrogen peroxide in their diet and no problems were detected in 
their offspring. Similarly, when tested as a component in hair dyes, peroxide 
wasn’t found to cause birth defects. With in-office bleaching, the technician 
applies the whitening product to the teeth, and uses heat and/or a laser 
to quicken the process. Many dentists don’t perform these procedures on 
pregnant women because they haven’t been well-studied. On the bright side, 
seeing your dentist for cleaning not only promotes good hygiene, but also 
removes surface stains and leaves you with a brighter smile.

If you need routine dental work — cavities filled, teeth pulled, crowns placed — 
don’t worry. Local anesthesia and most pain medications are safe. Some den-
tists also recommend antibiotics during dental procedures. Most antibiotics 
that dentists recommend are also safe during pregnancy, but you should check 
with your prenatal care provider to make sure. Even dental X-rays pose no sig-
nificant problem for the fetus, as long as a lead “apron” or shield is placed over 
the abdomen.
Having sex
For most couples, having sex during pregnancy is perfectly safe. In fact, some 
couples find that sex during pregnancy is even better than before. However, 
you may have some issues to consider.
In the first half of pregnancy, sex can usually continue as before because 
your body hasn’t changed that noticeably. You may notice that your breasts 
are particularly sensitive to the touch, or even tender. Later, as the uterus 
grows, some sexual positions become more difficult. You and your partner 
may find that you have to be a little creative to make things work. If you find 
that intercourse is too uncomfortable, other forms of sexual gratification may 
work better for you and your partner.

48
Part I: The Game Plan 
Many women ask us whether having sex at the end of pregnancy is okay, 
even if the cervix is a little bit dilated. Having sex then is perfectly fine as long 
as your membranes haven’t ruptured (your water hasn’t broken).
 
Avoid intercourse if you’re at a high risk for preterm labor or if you have pla-
centa previa (see Chapter 16) in the third trimester. Most practitioners sug-
gest refraining from intercourse for two reasons:
 
✓ Intercourse has the potential to introduce an infection into the uterus.
 
✓ Semen contains substances that are known to make the uterus contract.
Another important aspect to consider is how each of you feels psychologi-
cally about having sex during pregnancy. Like some women, you may find that 
your libido or sex drive has increased. Often, you may find that you have vivid 
sexual dreams and that orgasm itself is heightened. On the other hand, you may 
find that your interest in sex is less than it was before you got pregnant. You 
may feel less attractive because of the physical changes that have taken place, 
which is perfectly normal. Your partner may also experience changes in his 
desire for sex due to the excitement and normal apprehension that goes along 
with being a father and due to (unfounded) fears that intercourse will hurt the 
baby or that the baby will somehow know what mom and dad are up to.
Working during Pregnancy: 
A Different Type of Labor
Over the last half-century, the number of women who work outside the home 
has steadily increased. Now more than 75 percent of pregnant women work 
during the third trimester, and more than half work within a few weeks of 
delivery. Many women find that working until the end of pregnancy keeps 
them happy and occupied and helps them not to focus on the discomforts. In 
addition, many women don’t have a choice — they may be the main income 
providers for their families and their careers are top priority. Although most 
of the time working throughout pregnancy doesn’t cause any problems for 
the baby, there can be some exceptions. 
 
Stress in pregnancy, whether related to work or to home situations, isn’t well-
studied. Some doctors believe that very high levels of stress may increase 
the risk of developing preeclampsia or preterm labor, although no study has 
confirmed this risk (both of which we discuss in Chapter 16). Unusual stress 
may increase your risk of post-partum depression. Too much stress obviously 
isn’t good for anyone. Do whatever you can to decrease the stress in your life 
and talk with your practitioner if you find you’re becoming persistently blue 
or anxious.

49
 Chapter 3: Preparing for Life during Pregnancy
Considering occupational hazards
Maybe your job requires minimal standing or walking, allows you to work 
regular hours, and never stresses you out. If that’s the case, and if you have 
no previous medical problems, you may just as well skip this section (and let 
us know what your job is!). But if you’re like the rest of us, read on.
Occupations that are physically demanding can be problematic. Most jobs 
fall somewhere in between sedentary and demanding, but even then the 
amount of stress varies according to the individual. If your pregnancy pro-
ceeds without complications, you probably can continue to work right up 
until delivery. However, some complications that may arise during pregnancy 
may make reducing your workload or stopping work altogether advisable. 
For example, if you develop preterm labor, your practitioner will most likely 
advise you to stop working. Other conditions that may warrant a reduction in 
physical activity are hypertension or problems with the baby’s growth.

If you work at a computer terminal, you may wonder whether you’re being 
exposed to anything harmful. But you have no need to worry — no evidence 
suggests that the electromagnetic fields that computer terminals emit are a 
problem.
Some studies suggest that women who have jobs associated with physically 
demanding responsibilities, such as heavy lifting, manual labor, or significant 
physical exertion, may be at a slightly higher risk of preterm birth, high blood 
pressure, preeclampsia, or small-for-gestational-age babies. On the other 
hand, long working hours weren’t found to increase the chances for prema-
ture delivery. Other studies have also shown that jobs in which prolonged 
standing is required (more than eight hours a day) were associated with a 
greater chance for back and foot pain, circulatory problems, and a slightly 
increased risk of preterm birth. The good news: The use of support hose, 
although not particularly attractive, is helpful in decreasing varicose veins.
 
Remember that your health and the baby’s health are the highest priority. 
Don’t feel that you’re a wimp because you have to attend to your pregnancy. 
Some women believe that if they complain about certain symptoms or take 
time out from a busy schedule to eat or go to the bathroom, they will garner 
the disapproval of their superiors at work. Don’t let yourself feel guilty about 
your special needs during this time, and don’t let work cause you to ignore 
any unusual symptoms. If you need time off to deal with complications, take it, 
and don’t feel bad about it. People who have never been pregnant don’t com-
pletely understand the physical strains you’re dealing with.

50
Part I: The Game Plan 
Understanding pregnancy and the law
Take the time to understand your rights as they pertain to pregnancy. In the 
United States, an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, called 
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act, requires pregnant women to be treated 
in a manner equal to all employees or applicants. According to this act, 
employers can’t refuse to hire a woman because of her pregnancy-related 
condition, as long as she’s capable of performing the job’s major functions. If 
an employee is temporarily unable to carry out her job due to the pregnancy, 
the employer must treat her the same as any other temporarily disabled 
employee, taking such actions as providing alternative tasks, disability leave, 
or leave without pay. A disability may arise due to the pregnancy itself, 
such as significant nausea and vomiting. A disability may also occur due to 
complications of pregnancy, such as bleeding, preterm labor, or high blood 
pressure, or may occur due to hazardous job exposures. If your healthcare 
provider decides that your pregnancy is disabling, you can ask that she send 
a letter to your employer, verifying your disability.
Health insurance provided by an employer should cover expenses for 
pregnancy-related conditions in a way that’s similar to its coverage of other 
medical conditions, as long as obstetric services are covered. Health insurers 
are prohibited by law from considering pregnancy a pre-existing condition, 
which means you cannot be denied coverage when you go from one job to 
another and switch health plans.

Chapter 4
Diet and Exercise for the 
Expectant Mother
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding healthy weight gain — yours and your baby’s
▶ Optimizing your diet
▶ Taking food safety into account
▶ Staying fit during pregnancy
T
hrough the ages, women have received all kinds of advice about what, 
and how much, to eat while they’re expecting. Cultural traditions, reli-
gious beliefs, and scientific thinking have all had their influence. As recently 
as a generation ago, women were told to limit how much they ate and drank 
and thus keep their weight gain to a minimum. At other times, they were 
encouraged to eat lots of fatty foods — the notion being that the greater the 
weight gain, the healthier the child. These days, your practitioner’s advice 
is likely to depend on your particular health habits and your size when 
your pregnancy begins. Also, if you’re carrying more than one baby, you’re 
expected to gain more than the average number of pounds.
Of course, health involves more than just eating well. Exercise is as important 
while you’re pregnant as it was before, although what and how much you do 
to stay fit may change as your pregnancy progresses. This chapter provides 
you with the information you need in order to properly nourish yourself and 
your baby and to keep exercising safely.
Looking at Healthy Weight Gain
Starting pregnancy at a healthy weight and gaining weight at a moderate pace 
throughout pregnancy can help ensure that your baby grows and develops 
normally, and that you stay healthy as well. So what is healthy? This section 
explains in more depth the weight issues associated with pregnancy.

52
Part I: The Game Plan 
Determining how much is enough
The best way to figure out your ideal weight — and weight gain — is to look 
at a measurement that’s known as body mass index (BMI), a number that 
takes into account both height and weight.
Find your body mass index by looking up your measurements on the chart in 
Figure 4-1. Locate your weight on the vertical line on the left-hand side of the 
chart and your height on the horizontal (bottom) line. (Alternatively, use the 
metric measurements on the right-hand and top sides.) Find the place where 
those two points intersect on the chart, and then follow the diagonal line 
closest to that point to find your BMI.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The body 
mass index 
chart.

After you know your body mass index, you can figure out your ideal weight 
gain during pregnancy by consulting Table 4-1. (But don’t forget, this number 
refers to women carrying only one baby!)

These numbers refer to total weight gain during the entire pregnancy, so 
you won’t know whether you’ve hit the target until delivery day. Scientific 
research hasn’t determined the optimal pattern of weight gain throughout 
pregnancy. Gaining very little weight early on (when you may be in the throes 
of morning sickness) may have less effect on fetal growth than does poor 
weight gain in the late second or third trimesters. Some women gain weight 
inconsistently, putting on a large number of pounds early and then much less 
later on. Nothing is necessarily unhealthy about this pattern, either.
Avoiding weight obsession
For the most part, use the charts of optimal weight gain as a guide, but don’t 
become fanatical about how much you weigh. Even if the amount you gain is 
somewhat off course, if your doctor says that the baby is growing normally, 
you have nothing to worry about. Women who gain more than average can 
still have healthy babies, and so can women who gain very little.
If your weight gain is way too high or way too low, your doctor can check the 
baby’s growth by measuring the fundal height (see Chapter 3) or schedul-
ing you for a sonogram. If you deviate significantly from the recommended 
weight gain, your doctor will probably want to evaluate your diet. He may 
refer you to a nutritionist or dietitian who can give you specific advice about 
what and how much to eat.
 
The bottom line is that you want to do all you can to improve your baby’s 
chances of optimal growth and development, but not at the expense of driving 
yourself crazy.

54
Part I: The Game Plan 
Understanding your baby’s weight gain
Although your weight gain may follow a path all its own, your baby’s own 
bulking-up pattern is likely to progress slowly at first, and then pick up at 
about 32 weeks, only to slow again in the last weeks before birth. At 14 to 15 
weeks, for example, the baby puts on weight at about 0.18 ounce (5 grams) 
per day, and at 32 to 34 weeks, 1.06 to 1.23 ounces (30 to 35 grams) per day 
(that’s about half a pound or 0.23 kilograms each week). After 36 weeks, the 
fetal growth rate slows to about a quarter of a pound per week, and by 41 to 
42 weeks (you’re overdue at this point), minimal or no further fetal growth 
may occur. Check out Chapter 7 for more about how your baby grows.
In addition to your diet and weight gain, the following factors affect fetal 
growth:
 
✓ Cigarette smoking: Smoking can reduce the birth weight by about half a 
pound (about 200 grams).
 
✓ Diabetes: If the mother is diabetic, the baby can be too big or too small.
 
✓ Genetic or family history: In other words, basketball players usually 
don’t have children who grow up to be professional jockeys!
 
✓ Fetal infection: Some infections affect growth, although others don’t.
 
✓ Illicit drug use: Drug abuse can slow fetal growth.
 
✓ Mother’s medical history: Some medical problems, like hypertension or 
lupus, can affect fetal growth.
 
✓ Multiple pregnancy: Twins and triplets are often smaller than single 
babies.
 
✓ Placental function: Placental blood flow that’s below par can slow down 
the baby’s growth.
Your practitioner keeps an eye on your baby’s growth rate, most often by 
measuring fundal height and paying attention to your weight gain. If you put 
on too little or too much weight, if your fundal height measurements are 
abnormal, or if something in your history puts you at risk for growth prob-
lems, your doctor is likely to send you for an ultrasound exam to more accu-
rately assess the situation.

Where does the weight go?
The good news is that the weight you gain 
during pregnancy doesn’t all go to your thighs. 
Then again, it doesn’t all go to the baby, either. 
A pregnant woman typically adds a little to her 
own body fat. It’s a myth, however, that you 
can tell by a woman’s pattern of weight gain — 
more in the hips or more in the belly — whether 
she’s going to have a boy or a girl. (See Chapter 
2 for some other myths regarding determining 
your baby’s sex.)
Look at this realistic view of your weight gain — 
assuming it’s 27 pounds, which is fairly average:
Baby 
7 pounds (3,180 grams)
Placenta 
1 pound (455 grams)
Amniotic fluid 
2 pounds (910 grams)
Uterus 
2 pounds (910 grams)
Breasts 
1 pound (455 grams)
Fat stores 
7 pounds (3,180 grams)
Body water 
4 pounds (1,820 grams)
Extra blood 
3 pounds (1,360 grams)
Extra blood 3 lbs.
Body water 4 lbs.
Uterus 2 lbs.
Fetus 7 lbs.
Fat stores 7 lbs.
Amniotic fluid 2 lbs.
Placenta 1 lb.
Breasts 1 lb.

Part I: The Game Plan 
Taking Stock of What You’re Taking In
Sticking to a well-balanced, low-fat, high-fiber diet is important not only for 
your baby but also for your own health. Consuming adequate protein is also 
important because protein carries out many of the body’s functions. The 
fiber in your diet helps to prevent or reduce constipation and hemorrhoids. 
By not consuming too much fat, you help keep your heart healthy and avoid 
putting on extra pounds that may be difficult to shed. Avoiding excessive 
weight gain also decreases your chances of developing stretch marks. To 
read more about stretch marks, see Chapter 7.
If your diet is balanced and not too heavy in sugar or fat, you don’t need to 
modify the way you eat dramatically. During pregnancy, you should take in 
roughly 300 extra calories a day, on average. That means that if you’re at a 
healthy weight and you’re taking in 2,100 calories per day, while pregnant 
you should take in an average of 2,400 calories per day (perhaps a little less 
during your first trimester and a little more during your third trimester).
 
You should not increase your caloric intake by eating a hot fudge sundae 
every day. Filling these additional requirements with nutritious foods is key. 
Your practitioner will likely advise you to take some supplemental vitamins 
and minerals, too. Keep reading to find out which foods and supplements are 
best for you.
Using the USDA Food Guide Pyramid
No single food can satisfy all your nutritional needs. The USDA Food Guide 
Pyramid, shown in Figure 4-2, is a general guideline that illustrates the rela-
tive proportions of servings you should eat in each group. To get some 
specific recommendations tailored for your pre-pregnancy weight and 
activity level, go to www.mypyramid.gov and click on the “Pregnancy and 
Breastfeeding” link.

 Chapter 4: Diet and Exercise for the Expectant Mother
The USDA Food Guide Pyramid includes the following food groups. They 
appear from left to right on the pyramid:
 
✓ Grains: Foods made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, or barley are grain 
products. Whole-grain foods contain the entire grain kernel, including 
the bran (the outer protective coat of the grain) and the germ (the small 
area at the base of each grain). Examples of whole grains include whole 
wheat, bulgur (cracked wheat), oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and brown 
rice. Refined grains have gone through a process that removes their 
bran and germ layers, which also removes much of the fiber and some of 
the nutrients, like B vitamins and E vitamins. Examples of refined grain 
products include white flour, white bread, white rice, and many pastas.
 
 An average-sized woman needs about 6 to 8 ounces of grains per day 
during pregnancy. The USDA recommends making at least half of your 
grain intake in the form of whole grains. This means eating about 3 to 4 
ounces of whole-grain bread, whole-grain cereal, whole-grain pasta, or 
other whole-grain products every day.
 
✓ Vegetables: Vegetables are divided into five groups, based on their 
nutrient content. The following list orders them from highest nutri-
ent content (dark green vegetables) to lowest (other vegetables), and 
includes examples within each category:
 
• Dark green vegetables: Spinach, dark green leafy lettuce, romaine 
lettuce, broccoli, kale, turnip greens, watercress
 
• Orange vegetables: Carrots; pumpkin; sweet potatoes; acorn, but-
ternut, and hubbard squash
 
• Dry beans/peas: Pinto, black, garbanzo, kidney, navy, soy, and 
white beans; split peas; lentils; tofu
 
• Starchy vegetables: Potatoes, corn, green peas, green lima beans
 
• Other vegetables: Cabbage, cauliflower, iceberg lettuce, green 
beans, celery, green and red peppers, mushrooms, onions, toma-
toes, asparagus, cucumbers, eggplant
 
 Pregnant women should try to eat 21/2 to 3 cups of vegetables each day. 
Any of the above vegetables or pure vegetable juice counts towards 
this goal, but dark green or orange vegetables and dried beans are best 
because their nutrient content is higher. Eating a variety of different veg-
etables is also important, though.
 
✓ Fruits: A variety of fruits is an important part of your diet while you are 
pregnant. Fruits are not only a good source of vitamins and minerals, 
but they also provide fiber, which is very important during pregnancy to 
help reduce constipation. Fruits contain healthy amounts of vitamins A 
and C, as well as potassium.
 
 Pregnant women should try to eat 2 to 21/2 cups of fruit per day. You can 
choose fresh, frozen, canned, or dried fruits. Go easy on the fruit juices, 
though, because they can contain lots of extra sugar.

58
Part I: The Game Plan 
 
✓ Oils and Fats: Oils are fats that remain liquid at room temperature, like 
vegetable oil, olive oil, and corn oil. These fats are mostly unsaturated 
and are the healthiest type of fats to eat. Foods like nuts, avocados, fish, 
and olives are naturally high in unsaturated fats. Solid fats are fats that 
are solid at room temperature, like butter, shortening, lard, and mar-
garine. These foods are high in saturated fats. Trans fats are a type of 
saturated fats that are common in processed foods and have been asso-
ciated with obesity and heart disease.
 
 Ideally, fewer than 20 to 35 percent of your total calories should come 
from fats, with fewer than 10 percent coming from saturated fats and 
trans fats being avoided altogether.
 
✓ Milk Products: Foods that fall in this group include milk, yogurt, and 
cheese, and all are great sources of calcium. It’s best to focus on low-fat 
or fat-free milk products whenever possible. An average-sized woman 
needs to consume about three cups of milk or milk products per day.
 
✓ Meat and Beans: Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, and nuts fall into this 
category. You should focus on low-fat and lean foods in this category 
and vary your choices. Baking, broiling, and grilling are the healthiest 
ways to cook these foods. During pregnancy, you should eat five to 
seven ounces of food from this category daily.

Experiencing morning sickness during the first trimester is very common (see 
Chapter 5). If you’re experiencing this nausea and can’t eat a well-balanced 
diet, you may wonder whether you’re getting enough nutrition for you and the 
baby. You actually can go for several weeks not eating an optimal diet without 
any ill effects on the baby. You may find that the only foods you can tolerate 
are foods heavy in starch or carbohydrates. If all you feel like eating are pota-
toes, bread, and pasta, go right ahead. Keeping something down is better than 
starving.
 
As your pregnancy progresses, your body needs a lot of extra fluid. Early on, 
some women who don’t drink enough liquid feel weak or faint. Later in preg-
nancy, dehydration can lead to premature contractions. Make a point of drink-
ing plenty of water (or milk) — about six to eight glasses a day, and a bit more 
if you are carrying more than one baby.
Supplementing your diet
If your diet is healthy and balanced, you get most of the vitamins and miner-
als you need naturally — with the exception of iron, folic acid, and calcium. 
To make sure you get enough of these nutrients and to ensure against 
inadequate eating habits, your practitioner is likely to recommend prenatal 
vitamins. In the case of vitamins, more isn’t necessarily better; take only the 

59
 Chapter 4: Diet and Exercise for the Expectant Mother
prescribed number of pills each day. Several different prenatal vitamins are 
available, and they are generally equivalent. Some are better tolerated than 
others, so if you find the one you’re taking is not agreeable to you, try a dif-
ferent brand. Also, many now contain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. 
Some data suggests that omega-3 supplements may decrease the risk of pre-
term delivery and may have a beneficial effect on the newborn brain, but this 
hasn’t been proven with certainty.

If you miss taking a vitamin, don’t worry. Nothing bad is going to happen. 
During the early months, if your vitamins make you nauseous, skipping them 
until you feel better is perfectly safe for the baby. Remember that the baby is 
still very small, without large nutritional requirements. If you’re very early in 
your pregnancy (four to seven weeks), you can take just a folic acid supple-
ment, which is sometimes easier to tolerate, until you can handle the com-
plete prenatal vitamin pill. If later on in the pregnancy you get a stomach virus 
and can’t tolerate vitamins for some time, that’s not a problem either. The 
growing baby is able to get what it needs, even at the expense of the mom (a 
theme that continues throughout life!).
 
If you find that the vitamins really make you nauseous, try eating a few crack-
ers before you take them, or take them at bedtime.
Is caffeine safe during pregnancy?
Although some women think that the only food 
that contains caffeine is a strong cup of coffee, 
in fact, you can find caffeine in many of the other 
things you eat and drink on a daily basis: tea, 
many sodas, cocoa, and chocolate. No evidence 
suggests that caffeine causes birth defects. 
However, if you consume caffeine in large 
amounts, it may raise the risk of miscarriage.
Most studies suggest that it takes more than 
200 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day to affect 
the fetus. The average cup of coffee (remem-
ber, this is an 8-ounce cup of regular coffee — 
not the super-mega size or an espresso or cap-
puccino!) has between 100 and 150 mg of caffeine. 
Caffeinated tea has slightly less caffeine — 
about 50 to 100 mg — and soft drinks have 
approximately 36 mg per 12-ounce serving. 
So drinking one 8-ounce cup of coffee (or the 
equivalent caffeine content in other foods or 
beverages) per day is usually okay during preg-
nancy. A lot of women ask about the caffeine 
content in chocolate — your sweet tooth will be 
happy to know that an average-sized chocolate 
bar or cup of hot cocoa has only about 6 mg of 
caffeine.
Remember, too, that consuming caffeine often 
increases the already frequent trips to the bath-
room. If you’re already bothered by frequent uri-
nation, you may want to cut your caffeine intake 
further. Also, you may find that, especially in the 
last trimester, getting a full night’s rest is almost 
impossible because you can’t find a comfort-
able sleeping position and, even if you do, you 
have to get up several times to go to the bath-
room. Drinking coffee or tea at nighttime may 
only aggravate your inability to get some rest!

60
Part I: The Game Plan 
Iron
You need more iron when you’re expecting because both you and the baby 
are making new red blood cells every day. On average, you need 30 milli-
grams (mg) of extra iron every day of your pregnancy, which is what most 
prenatal vitamins contain. Blood counts can easily drop during pregnancy 
because your body gradually is making more and more blood plasma (fluid) 
and relatively fewer red blood cells (which is called a dilutional anemia). If 
you do develop anemia, you may need to take an extra iron supplement.
 
Foods rich in iron include chicken, fish, red meat, green leafy vegetables, and 
enriched or whole-grain breads and cereals. You can raise the iron content of 
foods by cooking them in cast-iron pots and skillets.
Calcium and vitamin D
You need about 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 2,000 units of Vitamin D 
every day while you’re pregnant. (The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance 
[USRDA] of calcium for all women is about 1,000 mg.) Most women actually 
get much less. If you’re already starting out somewhat calcium and vitamin 
D deficient, the calcium requirements of the developing baby will only make 
matters worse for you. A fetus can extract enough calcium from its mother, 
even if it means getting it at the expense of the mother’s bones. So the extra 
calcium and vitamin D needed during pregnancy are really aimed at protect-
ing you and your health. The vitamin D helps you store the calcium.
 
Prenatal vitamins contain only about 200 to 300 mg of calcium (about one-
quarter of the USRDA), so you need to get calcium from other sources as well.
Getting enough calcium from your diet alone is possible if you really pay 
attention. You can get it from three to four servings of calcium-rich foods, 
such as milk, yogurt, cheese, green leafy vegetables, and canned fish with 
bones (if your stomach can take it). Supermarkets also stock special lactose-
free foods that are high in calcium. The following list indicates portions of 
foods that qualify as one serving (300 mg of calcium):
 
✓ 1 8-ounce glass of milk
 
 Choose low-fat or skim milk.
 
✓ 4 ounces of cooked broccoli
 
✓ 4 to 5 ounces of canned salmon with bones
 
✓ 11/2 to 2 ounces of cheese
 
 Cottage cheese has less calcium than many other cheeses.
 
✓ 8 ounces of yogurt

61
 Chapter 4: Diet and Exercise for the Expectant Mother
 
If your diet is low in calcium, take a supplement. Tums and some other ant-
acids contain quite a bit of calcium and, at the same time, help relieve any 
pregnancy heartburn you may have. (A single Tums tablet has the equivalent 
calcium content of an 8-ounce glass of milk.)
Determining Which Foods Are Safe
When our patients ask us about nutrition and which foods they may want to 
avoid, certain items come up again and again. Some of the foods we’re most 
often asked about should be avoided, and others are unlikely to cause harm. 
This section identifies the potentially harmful foods and also debunks some 
common myths about other foods.
Eyeing potentially harmful foods
If you’re healthy, you can probably confidently eat most of the foods you usu-
ally eat. Nonetheless, the following list contains some potential dangers that 
we feel we ought to mention:
 
✓ Cheeses from unpasteurized or raw milk: Cheeses made from unpas-
teurized or raw milk may contain certain bacteria, such as listeria, 
monocytogenes, salmonella, and E. coli. Listeria, in particular, has been 
linked to certain pregnancy complications, such as premature labor or 
even miscarriage. The FDA mandates that all cheeses sold in the United 
States be either made from pasteurized milk or aged more than 60 days 
(which makes the likelihood of listeria extremely low), so most cheeses 
you buy at your local market are safe. Just check the label to be sure.
 
✓ Raw or very rare meat: Steak tartare or very rare beef or pork may 
contain bacteria, such as listeria, or parasites, such as toxoplasma. 
Adequate cooking kills both bacteria and parasites. In other words, you 
want your food to be cooked medium-well to well done.
 
✓ Liver: Because it contains extremely high amounts of Vitamin A (more 
than 10 times the amount recommended for a pregnant woman), liver 
consumed in early pregnancy may hypothetically be linked to birth 
defects. Consuming more than 10,000 international units (IUs) of Vitamin 
A daily (the recommended daily allowance for pregnant women is 2,500 
IU) was linked to birth defects in one study. Scientists haven’t proven 
this danger unequivocally, but you may want to find a substitute for that 
liver and onions craving in the first trimester. And check out the label 
on your prenatal vitamins to make sure you’re not getting too much 
Vitamin A.

62
Part I: The Game Plan 
Debunking popular food myths
Many of the foods that have at one time or another been thought dangerous 
for pregnant women aren’t likely to harm you or your baby. Although you 
don’t have to avoid the following foods, they should be eaten in moderation, 
especially those that are manufactured (as opposed to natural) products.
 
✓ Aspartame (Equal or Nutrasweet): Aspartame (a common component of 
low-calorie foods and beverages) is a type of amino acid, and the body is 
accustomed to amino acids because they’re what all proteins are made 
of. No medical evidence shows that aspartame causes any problems for 
the growing baby.
 
✓ Sucralose (Splenda): Sucralose is one of the newest low-calorie sweeten-
ers on the market, with less than 2 calories per teaspoon. It is actually a 
type of sugar, but it’s much more potent than regular table sugar, so you 
only need small amounts to sweeten things up (and therefore you get 
fewer calories). Because it’s a type of sugar, it should have no harmful 
effects on your developing baby.
 
✓ Cheeses: Not only do most people believe that processed and pasteur-
ized cheeses are safe, but these cheeses are also a great source of both 
protein and calcium. See the section “Eyeing potentially harmful foods” 
for information about unpasteurized cheeses.
Clarifying listeria
Listeria, which is a bacteria that may lead to 
premature labor and other complications, is 
found primarily in unpasteurized cheeses but 
also is present in other foods — some pâtés, 
hot dogs, and deli meats, for example, as well 
as prepackaged salads that have been con-
taminated with soil that contains listeria.
Because listeria is found in so many different 
foods, you can’t avoid eating all foods known to 
contain it. The good news is that the incidence 
of listeria infection during pregnancy is actually 
very uncommon (0.012 percent). There are some 
guidelines you can follow to further reduce your 
risk, such as eating hot food immediately after 
heating. Foods thought to be virtually free of 
listeria include chocolate, marmalade, cookies, 
raw carrots, raw apples, and raw tomatoes. So 
if you really want to avoid listeria altogether, 
have a marmalade, raw carrot, and cookie 
sandwich. Seriously, if you inadvertently eat 
any of the foods that may contain listeria, don’t 
panic; your actual risk of infection is still quite 
low, and the problem is relatively uncommon.

63
 Chapter 4: Diet and Exercise for the Expectant Mother
 
✓ Fish: Fish is a great source of protein and vitamins, and is also low in 
fat. In fact, the high levels of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, 
and other nutrients make fish an excellent food for pregnant mothers 
and their developing babies. However, certain fish — shark, mackerel, 
swordfish, and tilefish — contain high levels of mercury. The jury’s still 
out on whether mercury may lead to certain childhood developmental 
delays or problems with fine motor skills (probably not), but the FDA 
currently recommends you avoid fish with high levels of mercury when 
you’re pregnant.
 
 The USDA guidelines say you can still enjoy up to 12 ounces (2 average 
meals) per week of fish and shellfish lower in mercury, like salmon, had-
dock, tilapia, cod, sole, and shrimp or up to 6 ounces of albacore tuna per 
week. (The limitations are due to the fact that even fish that is low in mer-
cury isn’t mercury-free, so mercury consumption could add up to a signifi-
cant amount if fish were eaten in large quantities.) Don’t let your concern 
for mercury make you give up fish altogether because two recent studies 
looking at fish consumption in pregnant women showed that women who 
eat fish may actually have lower rates of preterm delivery, and their chil-
dren may have higher IQs than those who do not eat fish.
 
• Sushi: Raw fish (except raw shellfish) actually carries a very small 
risk of a parasitic infection (about one infection in two million serv-
ings), whether you’re pregnant or not (this is less than the risk of 
getting sick from eating chicken!). Pregnancy doesn’t increase the 
danger, and your fetus is unlikely to suffer any harm from such an 
infection. Most important is to make sure that the fish comes from 
a reliable source and that it is stored properly.
 
• Smoked meats or fish: Many pregnant women worry about eating 
smoked meats and fish because they’ve heard that these foods are 
high in nitrites or nitrates. Although these foods do contain these 
substances, they won’t hurt your baby if eaten in moderation.
Considering Special Dietary Needs
Try as you may to follow all the rules of healthy nutrition, you may encounter 
certain problems with digestion, such as constipation or heartburn. Or you 
may find that you need to tailor the rules to fit your particular eating habits — 
for example, if you’re a vegetarian. In this section, we address some of the 
issues that arise for women with special nutritional considerations and for all 
women who may experience any digestive problems.

64
Part I: The Game Plan 
Eating right, vegetarian-style
If you’re a vegetarian, rest assured that you can produce a healthy baby 
without eating steak. But you do have to plan your diet more carefully. 
Vegetables, whole grains, and legumes (peas and beans) are rich in protein, 
but most don’t have complete proteins. (They don’t contain all the essential 
amino acids that your body can’t produce by itself.) To get all the necessary 
protein, you can combine various proteins, for example, whole grains with 
legumes or nuts, rice with kidney beans, or even peanut butter with whole-
grain bread. The combination doesn’t have to occur at the same meal, only 
on the same day, but a good rule of thumb is to try to get some protein with 
each meal.
If you don’t eat any animal products, including milk and cheese, your diet 
may not provide enough of six other important nutrients: vitamin B12, 
calcium, riboflavin, iron, zinc, and vitamin D. Bring up the topic with your 
doctor. You may also want to discuss your diet with a nutritionist.
Combating constipation
Progesterone, a hormone that circulates freely through your body during 
pregnancy, can slow down your digestive system and thus cause constipa-
tion. The extra iron from your prenatal vitamin only makes matters worse. 
Women who are on bed rest because of pregnancy complications are at par-
ticular risk of constipation because they’re so inactive.
 
You can counteract constipation by drinking plenty of fluids, by eating ade-
quate fiber (in the form of fruits, vegetables, beans, bran, and other whole 
grains), and, if possible, by getting exercise every day. Keep in mind, however, 
that some women experience abdominal discomfort, bloating, or gas from 
eating too much of foods high in fiber. You may have to use a little trial and 
error to see which fiber-rich foods you tolerate best. If constipation bothers 
you, your practitioner may recommend a stool softener.
Dealing with diabetes
If you’re diabetic or if you develop diabetes during pregnancy, adjust your 
diet so that it includes specific quantities of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates 
to ensure that you maintain a normal level of blood glucose (sugar). We dis-
cuss diabetes more in Chapter 17.

65
 Chapter 4: Diet and Exercise for the Expectant Mother
Working Out for Two
The great fitness movement hasn’t left pregnant women behind. You see 
them jogging in parks, working out in gyms, or stretching their limbs in yoga 
classes. During pregnancy, exercise helps your body in many ways: It keeps 
your heart strong and your muscles in shape, and it relieves the basic dis-
comforts of pregnancy — from morning sickness to constipation to achy legs 
and backs. The earlier in pregnancy a woman gets regular exercise, the more 
comfortable she is likely to feel throughout the 40 weeks. Regular exercise 
may even make for shorter labor.
So if you’re in good health and not at risk for obstetrical or medical compli-
cations, by all means go ahead and continue with your exercise program — 
unless your program calls for climbing Mount Fuji, entering a professional 
boxing match, or some other superstrenuous activity. Go over your exercise 
program with your practitioner, so he knows what you’re doing and so that 
you can ask any other questions you have.
 
As good as exercise is for most pregnant women, we don’t advise it for every-
one. If you have any of the following conditions (see Chapters 15, 16, and 17 
for more detail), you may be better off not working out — at least until you 
discuss the situation with your doctor:
 
✓ Bleeding
 
✓ Incompetent cervix
 
✓ Intrauterine growth restriction
 
✓ Low volume of amniotic fluid
 
✓ Placenta previa (late in pregnancy)
 
✓ Pregnancy-induced hypertension
 
✓ Premature labor or preterm rupture of the membranes
 
✓ Triplets or more
Adapting to your body’s changes
Even if you work out in moderation, remember that pregnancy causes your 
body to undergo real physical changes that can affect your strength, stamina, 
and performance. The following list details some of those changes:

66
Part I: The Game Plan 
 
✓ Cardiovascular changes: When you’re pregnant, the amount of blood that 
your heart pumps through your body increases. That increase in blood 
volume usually has no effect on your workout. (Some women can feel as 
though they hear their heartbeat in their ears because of the increased 
volume.) Also, if you lie flat on your back, especially after about 16 weeks 
of pregnancy, you may find yourself feeling dizzy or faint — or even nau-
seous. Known as supine hypotension syndrome, this dizziness sometimes 
happens when the enlarging uterus presses down on major blood vessels 
that return blood to the heart, thus decreasing the heart’s output. It hap-
pens even more readily if you’re carrying a multiple pregnancy and your 
uterus is that much heavier.
 
 If you’re doing any exercises that require you to lie on your back (or if 
you’re accustomed to sleeping on your back), put a small pillow or foam 
wedge under the right side of your back or your right hip. The pillow tilts 
you slightly sideways and effectively lifts your uterus off the blood vessels.
 
✓ Respiratory changes: Your body is using more oxygen than usual to 
support the growing baby. At the same time, breathing is more work 
than it used to be because the enlarging uterus presses upward against 
the diaphragm. For some women, this difficulty makes performing aero-
bic exercise a little harder.
 
✓ Structural changes: As your body shape changes — bigger abdomen, 
larger breasts — your center of gravity shifts, which can affect your 
balance. You notice it especially if you dance, bicycle, ski, surf, ride 
horses, or do anything else (walk tightropes, maybe?) where balance is 
important. In addition, pregnancy hormones cause some laxness in your 
joints, which also can make balance more difficult and may increase 
your risk of injury.
 
✓ Metabolic changes: Pregnant women use carbohydrates faster than 
nonpregnant women do, which means that they’re at a higher risk of 
developing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Exercise can be very useful 
in helping lower and control blood sugar levels, but it also increases the 
body’s need for carbohydrates. So if you exercise, make extra sure that 
you’re eating an adequate amount of starch just before you work out.
 
✓ Effects on the uterus: One study of women at term (far enough along to 
deliver) showed that their contractions increased after moderate aero-
bic exercise. Another study indicated that exercise is associated with a 
lower risk of early labor. But most studies have shown that exercise has 
no effect either way, and exercise does not pose a risk of preterm labor 
in healthy pregnant women.

67
 Chapter 4: Diet and Exercise for the Expectant Mother
 
✓ Effect on birth weight: Some studies have shown that women who work 
out strenuously (at high intensity) during pregnancy have lighter-weight 
babies. The same effect appears to occur in women who perform heavy 
physical work in a standing position while they’re pregnant. But this 
decrease in birth weight seems to be due mainly to a decrease in the 
newborn’s subcutaneous fat. In other words, more exercise has no effect 
on the fetus’s normal growth.
Exercising without overdoing it
Your changing body is going to demand a changing exercise routine. Don’t 
beat yourself up if you find that pregnancy makes it harder to continue the 
workouts you’re accustomed to. Modify your program according to what you 
can reasonably tolerate.
Listen to your body. If weightlifting suddenly hurts your back, lighten up. You 
may find it easier to perform nonweight-bearing exercises like swimming or 
stationary bicycling. No matter what your particular exercise regimen may 
be, keep in mind the basic rules for working out during pregnancy:
 
✓ If you have a moderate exercise routine, keep it up. If you’ve been pretty 
sedentary, don’t suddenly plunge into a strenuous program; ease in 
slowly to avoid putting too much strain on your body.
 
 Remember that keeping up a regular schedule of moderate activity is 
better than engaging in infrequent spurts of intense exercise, which are 
more likely to cause injury.
 
✓ Avoid overheating, especially during the first six weeks of pregnancy.
 
✓ Avoid exercising flat on your back for long periods of time; doing so may 
reduce blood flow to your heart.
 
✓ Try not to overheat or become dehydrated, and if you feel fatigued, 
dizzy, faint, or nauseous, by all means stop. On very hot or humid days, 
don’t exercise outdoors.
 
✓ Avoid anything that puts you at risk of being hurt in the abdomen, like 
road/mountain biking.
 
✓ Steer clear of high-impact, bouncy exercises that can tax your loosening 
joints.
 
✓ Throughout the nine months, low- or moderate-impact workouts make 
more sense than high-impact ones.

68
Part I: The Game Plan 
 
✓ Carry a bottle of water to every exercise session and stay well hydrated.
 
✓ Eat a well-balanced diet that includes an adequate supply of carbohydrates 
(see “Taking Stock of What You’re Taking In,” earlier in this chapter).
 
✓ Talk to your practitioner about what your peak exercise heart rate 
should be. (Many practitioners suggest 140 beats per minute as the 
upper limit.) Then regularly measure your heart rate at the peak of your 
workout to make sure that it’s at a safe level.
 
✓ Stop exercising and talk to your doctor if you experience any of these 
symptoms:
 
• Shortness of breath that is persistent or out of proportion to the 
exercise you’re doing
 
• Vaginal bleeding
 
• Rapid heartbeat (that is, more than 140 beats per minute)
 
• Dizziness or feeling faint
 
• Any significant pain
Comparing forms of exercise
Now isn’t the time to shoot for that Ms. Fitness title, but that certainly 
doesn’t mean you can’t exercise. Because your pregnant body demands you 
take new precautions, choose your style of exercise carefully.
Working your heart: Aerobic exercise
Weight-bearing exercises like running, walking, aerobics, and using a stair-
climbing machine or an elliptical trainer are great, as long as you don’t do 
too much. These exercises require you to support all your weight, which is 
ever-increasing. Because your joints are loosening and your center of gravity 
is shifting at the same time, you run a slightly higher risk of injuring yourself. 
Remember to do only what you know you can rather than setting off on a new 
exercise routine that is too demanding for your current state of fitness, not to 
mention your pregnancy.
Pilates is a popular mind-body conditioning program focused on strengthen-
ing the core postural muscles important in maintaining your balance and 
supporting your spine. For the most part, continuing Pilates classes while 
you are pregnant is safe, as long as you avoid lying flat on your back for long 
periods of time.
 
If you choose to take aerobics or Pilates classes, look for those designed spe-
cifically for pregnant women. If no classes are available, talk to the instructor 
to find modifications for exercises that are inappropriate.

 Chapter 4: Diet and Exercise for the Expectant Mother
You may find it easier, particularly later in pregnancy, to perform nonweight-
bearing exercises. Because your weight is supported, you have less chance of 
injuring yourself, and your joints aren’t stressed. If you’re new to exercise, a 
low-intensity workout in the pool or on a stationary bike is ideal.
 
Downhill skiing, water-skiing, and horseback riding put you at risk of falling 
with significant impact, which could injure you or your baby. Although these 
activities may be fine early in pregnancy, talk to your doctor before doing 
them in your second or third trimester. Cross-country skiing is less risky, 
especially if you’re experienced.
Strengthening your muscles
You won’t get a great cardiac benefit from weightlifting, yoga, or body sculpt-
ing, but you can improve your muscle tone and flexibility, which comes in 
handy during labor and delivery.
Weightlifting machines may be preferable to using free weights because 
you know you won’t drop the weights onto your abdomen. Use free weights 
only with caution, preferably with the help of a trainer or a skilled friend. A 
trainer can also show you the proper way to exhale and inhale during lifting. 
Breathing well is important because it lessens the chance that you might 
bear down (otherwise known as the valsava maneuver, a method of increas-
ing abdominal pressure). This can reduce blood flow, raise your blood pres-
sure, and stress your heart.
 
Avoid using very heavy weights, which can cause injury to your joints and 
ligaments.
Yoga, which is a great choice for pregnant women, is not only an excellent 
form of exercise, but may also be helpful in mastering breathing and relax-
ation techniques. Yoga is particularly useful in strengthening lower back and 
abdominal muscles and increasing stamina and physical endurance — all of 
which make you better equipped to handle the rigors of pregnancy.
Across the country, yoga studios are gaining in popularity, and many are 
offering specific classes for pregnant women. See the sidebar “Practicing safe 
yoga” for more about yoga.
 
Bikram yoga is a special type of yoga that is rapidly gaining popularity in the 
United States. It involves performing yoga in a room heated to 105 degrees 
Fahrenheit with a relative humidity of 60 to 70 percent. Although some doc-
tors feel that this type of yoga is safe for pregnant women during the first tri-
mester, we believe that prolonged exposure to high temperatures during the 
first trimester is inadvisable, given the possible risks of causing a neural tube 
defect. (See Chapter 8 for more on neural tube defects, such as spina bifida.)

70
Part I: The Game Plan 
Practicing safe yoga
Yoga can be a wonderful and relaxing way to 
work out while you’re pregnant, but only if you 
exercise caution. Follow these tips when doing 
yoga during pregnancy:
 ✓ If you’re new to yoga, take a beginner 
class to ease yourself into a new exercise 
regime.
 ✓ Be careful about positions that stretch your 
muscles too much. Due to elevated levels 
of progesterone and relaxin (hormones pro-
duced during pregnancy), you can easily 
overstretch your muscles and ligaments.
 ✓ When bending forward, try to bend from the 
hips, not from the back. Also, try to lift your 
chest high to avoid putting extra pressure 
on your abdomen.
 ✓ After the mid second trimester, try to avoid 
performing poses that require you to lie flat 
on your back for extensive periods of time, 
because pressure from a pregnant uterus 
may decrease blood return both to your 
heart and to the baby.
 ✓ As a general rule for any exercise, if you 
feel any pain or discomfort, stop and rest.

Pregnancy: A Drama 
in Three Acts

In this part . . .
I
f you’re like most women, you’re likely to become a bit 
calendar-conscious during pregnancy. It’s 40 weeks. 
It’s nine months (plus). But perhaps the most useful way 
to think of pregnancy is to divide it the way doctors do — 
into three trimesters. They do it this way because both 
the baby’s growth and the changes that occur in your own 
body happen in these three fairly distinct stages. In this part, 
we let you know what’s likely to happen — how the baby 
develops, how you’re likely to feel, and how your practitio-
ner takes care of you — in each trimester. We also include a 
chapter summarizing everything that is happening week by 
week so that you can check things off as they get done, and 
we tell you all about prenatal testing.

The First Trimester
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a glimpse of your baby’s development in the first trimester
▶ Coping with the physical symptoms of early pregnancy
▶ Addressing genetic concerns that may affect your baby
▶ Undergoing standard tests to ensure you and your baby are healthy
▶ Knowing what constitutes cause for concern
▶ Getting dad’s perspective on the pregnancy
T
he first trimester of your pregnancy is an exciting time, full of many 
changes for you and especially for your baby, which — in just 12 short 
weeks — grows from a single cell to a tiny being with a beating heart and 
functioning kidneys. With all that change going on in your baby, you can 
certainly expect many changes in your own body — from fatigue and nausea 
to newly voluptuous (va-va-va-voom!) but tender breasts. Through it all, you 
need to know what’s normal and what’s worth a call to your practitioner, 
whom you begin visiting regularly at this point. This chapter gives you a 
snapshot of what to expect.
A New Life Takes Shape
Pregnancy begins when the egg (or oocyte) and sperm meet, which happens in 
the fallopian tube. At this stage, the egg and sperm together form what we refer 
to as the zygote — a single cell. The zygote divides many times into a cluster 
of multiple cells called a blastocyst, which travels down the fallopian tube and 
into the uterus (also called the womb), shown in Figure 5-1. When it reaches the 
uterus, both you and your baby begin to experience major changes.
On or about the fifth day of development, the blastocyst attaches to the 
blood-rich lining of the uterus during a process called implantation. Part of 
the blastocyst grows to become the embryo (the baby in the first eight weeks 
of development), and the other part becomes the placenta (the organ that 
implants into the uterus to provide oxygen and nourishment to the fetus and 
eliminate its waste products).

Your baby grows within the amniotic sac in the uterus. The amniotic sac is 
full of clear fluid, known as the amniotic fluid. The balloon actually comprises 
two thin layers of membrane called the chorion and amnion (which together 
are known as the membranes). When people talk about water “breaking,” 
they’re referring to the rupturing of those membranes that line the uterus’s 
inner walls. The baby “swims” in this fluid and is attached to the placenta by 
the umbilical cord. Figure 5-2 shows a diagram of an early pregnancy, includ-
ing a developing fetus and the cervix, which is the uterus’s opening. The 
cervix opens up, or dilates, when you’re in labor.
The placenta begins to form soon after the embryo implants in the uterus. 
Maternal and fetal blood vessels lie very close to one another inside the 
placenta, which allows various substances (such as nutrients, oxygen, and 
waste) to transfer back and forth. The mother’s blood and the baby’s blood 
are in close contact, but they don’t actually mix.

The placenta grows like a tree, forming branches that in turn divide into 
smaller and smaller ones. The tiniest buds of the placenta are called the cho-
rionic villi, and it’s within these villi that small fetal blood vessels form. About 
three weeks after fertilization, these blood vessels join to form the baby’s 
circulatory system, and the heart begins to beat.
After the eighth week of your pregnancy, the developing embryo is referred 
to as a fetus. Amazingly, by this time almost all the baby’s major organs and 
structures are already formed. The remaining 32 weeks allow the fetus’s 
structures to grow and mature. On the other hand, the brain, although also 
formed very early, isn’t mature at birth; rather it continues to develop into 
early childhood.
 
When we refer to weeks, we mean menstrual weeks, which means weeks from 
the last menstrual period, not weeks from conception. So at eight weeks, the 
baby is really six weeks from conception.

76
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
By the end of the eighth week, arms, legs, fingers, and toes begin to form. In 
fact, the embryo begins to perform small, spontaneous movements. If you 
have an ultrasound examination performed in the first trimester, you can see 
these spontaneous movements on the screen. The brain enlarges rapidly, and 
ears and eyes appear. The external genitalia also emerge and can be differen-
tiated as male or female by the end of the 12th week, although sex differences 
are not yet detectable by ultrasound.
By the end of the 12th week, the fetus is about 4 inches long and weighs 
about 1 ounce. The head looks large and round, and the eyelids are fused 
shut. The intestines, which protruded slightly into the umbilical cord at 
about week 10, are by this time well inside the abdomen. Fingernails appear, 
and hair begins to grow on the baby’s head. The kidneys start working during 
the third month. Between 9 and 12 weeks, the fetus begins to produce urine, 
which you can see within the small fetal bladder on ultrasound.
Adapting to How Your Body Changes
Your baby isn’t the only one growing and changing during your pregnancy (not 
that we have to remind you of that!). Your own body also has to adjust, and the 
adjustments it makes aren’t always the most pleasant and comfortable for you. 
Being prepared for what lies ahead can help ease your mind. So in the follow-
ing sections, we let you know what is in store for you during the first trimester.
Breast changes
One of the earliest and most amazing changes in your body happens to your 
breasts. Even during the first month of pregnancy, most women notice that 
their breasts grow considerably larger and feel very tender. The nipples and 
areolae (the circular areas around the nipples) also grow bigger and may 
begin to darken. Breast changes are caused by the large amounts of estrogen 
and progesterone your body produces during pregnancy. These hormones 
cause the glands inside your breasts to grow and branch out, in preparation 
for milk production and breastfeeding after the baby is born. Blood supply to 
the breasts also increases markedly. You may notice large, bluish blood ves-
sels coursing along your breasts.
 
Plan to go through several bra sizes while you’re pregnant — and don’t skimp 
on buying new bras. Good support helps reduce stretching and sagging later 
on. Although some women like the way they look with larger breasts, others 
feel more self-conscious. Whichever way you feel, we guarantee that other 
pregnant women feel the same way, so don’t feel embarrassed about it.

77
 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
Fatigue
During the first trimester, you’re likely to feel overwhelming fatigue. This 
fatigue may be a side effect of all the physical changes your body is expe-
riencing, including the dramatic rise in hormone levels. Rest assured that 
your exhaustion will probably go away somewhere around the 12th to 14th 
week of your pregnancy. As your fatigue lessens, you’ll probably feel more 
energetic and almost normal, until about 30 to 34 weeks into your pregnancy, 
when you may tire out again. In the meantime, remember that fatigue is 
nature’s way of telling you to get more rest. If you can, try to catch a short 
nap during the day and go to bed earlier than usual at night.
Ways to keep nausea at bay
Unfortunately, we can’t tell you how to make 
your nausea totally disappear. But you can try 
a few things to make it better. Here are some 
suggestions:
 ✓ Eat small, frequent meals, so that your 
stomach is never empty.
 ✓ Don’t worry too much about adhering to 
a balanced diet initially; just eat whatever 
appeals to you during this relatively short 
period of time.
 ✓ Avoid perfume counters, active kitchens, 
smelly taxicabs, barnyards, or other places 
where odors may be strong.
 ✓ If your prenatal vitamins make the symp-
toms worse, try taking them at night just 
before you go to bed. If you find that they 
are still causing a problem, skipping them 
for a few days is okay, particularly if you’re 
taking an Omega 3 supplement in addition 
to your prenatal.
 ✓ Keep crackers by your bedside — some 
women find that eating them before getting 
out of bed in the morning helps to decrease 
the nausea.
 ✓ Ginger (in the form of tea or tablets, for 
example) may help some women.
 ✓ You may notice that your nausea wors-
ens when you brush your teeth. Switching 
toothpaste brands and avoiding vigorous 
brushing may help.
 ✓ Try eating dry toast, saltines, whole-wheat 
crackers, potatoes, and other bland, easy-
to-digest carbohydrates.
 ✓ If you’re bothered by the accumulation of 
saliva in your mouth, sucking on lemon drop 
candies may be helpful.
 ✓ Acupressure wristbands, sold in drug 
stores and health food stores, give some 
women relief.
 ✓ Relaxation exercises and even hypnosis 
work for some women.

78
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Any-time-of-day sickness
For some women, the nausea that can strike during the first trimester is 
worse in the mornings, maybe because the stomach is empty at that time of 
day. But ask anyone who’s had morning sickness, and she’ll tell you: It can hit 
any time it wants. It often starts during the fifth or sixth week (that is, three 
to four weeks after you miss your period — we describe how doctors calcu-
late the timing of pregnancy in Chapter 2) and goes away, or at least becomes 
much less severe, by the end of the 11th or 12th week. It can last longer, 
though, particularly in women who are expecting twins or more.
If you’re experiencing nausea, we sympathize. Even when nausea doesn’t 
actually cause you to vomit, it can be extremely uncomfortable and truly 
debilitating. Certain odors — from foods, perfumes, or musty places — can 
make it worse. Look in the nearby sidebar, “Ways to keep nausea at bay,” for 
recommendations on how to minimize morning sickness. If your queasiness 
gets out of control — if you experience weight loss, if you find that you can’t 
keep down food or liquids, or if you feel dizzy or faint — call your doctor.
 
If you’re really bothered by the nausea, talk to your doctor about over-the-
counter or prescription medications. Your doctor may suggest or prescribe 
one of the following:
 
✓ Vitamin B6: Some evidence suggests that 50 milligrams of vitamin B6 
three times a day can reduce nausea.
 
 A combination of vitamin B6 and the antihistamine doxylamine 
(Unisom — one pill at nighttime, check before you buy because some 
generics substitute a different medication) may also be helpful. This 
combination is similar to the medication Benedictin, which was 
removed from the market due to completely unsubstantiated claims of 
an increase in birth defects. Although Benedictin still isn’t available, 
scientists don’t believe any longer that it’s teratogenic (causes birth 
defects). Take time to talk to your doctor about trying vitamin B6, with 
or without doxylamine. Remember that doxylamine is marketed as a 
sleep aid, so it will most likely make you pretty drowsy.
 
✓ Ondansetron (Zofran): Some women find relief for extreme nausea 
with or without vomiting from this prescription medication. Although 
ondansetron hasn’t been extensively studied in pregnancy, we know 
of no reports of an increase in birth defects associated with this 
medication.
 
✓ Metoclopramide (Reglan): Your doctor can actually administer this 
drug by continuous infusion under the skin through a device known as 
a subcutaneous pump. The advantage of this method is that for those 
women who really can’t even swallow a pill because they’re so nau-
seous, they don’t have to.

79
 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
Occasionally, the nausea and vomiting are so severe that you develop a con-
dition called hyperemesis gravidarum. The symptoms include dehydration 
and weight loss. If you develop hyperemesis gravidarum, you may need to be 
given fluids and medications intravenously.
 
If you’re less than six weeks pregnant, you can take folic acid alone instead of 
your prenatal vitamin. Folic acid is the main supplement that you need early in 
your pregnancy, and it’s much less likely to upset your stomach than the mul-
tivitamin you normally take during pregnancy. Check with your doctor for the 
correct dose for you.
You may hear some women say that morning sickness is a sign that you’re 
experiencing a “normal” pregnancy, but that claim is a myth — and so is the 
reverse. If you’re not having morning sickness, or if it suddenly disappears, 
don’t worry that your pregnancy isn’t normal; just enjoy your good for-
tune. Similarly, you may hear that the severity of your queasiness indicates 
whether you’re having a girl or a boy. But that’s also a myth, so don’t buy 
those pink or blue outfits just yet (and turn to Chapter 2 for even more myths 
about determining the sex of your bundle of joy).
Above all, don’t compound the problem by worrying about it. The nausea is 
harmless — to you and the baby. Your optimal weight gain for the first three 
months is only 2 pounds. Even losing weight probably isn’t a big problem.
Bloating
Well before the baby is big enough to stretch out your stomach, your belt 
may begin to feel uncomfortable and your belly may look bloated and dis-
tended. This side effect of the hormone shift starts happening as soon as you 
conceive. Progesterone, one of the two key pregnancy hormones, causes you 
to retain water. Plus, it slows down the bowels, causing them to enlarge and 
thus increase the size of the abdomen. Estrogen, the other key pregnancy 
hormone, causes your uterus to enlarge, which also makes your abdomen 
feel bigger. This effect is often more pronounced in second or third pregnan-
cies because the first pregnancy causes your abdominal muscles to relax to a 
greater degree.
Frequent urination
From early on in your pregnancy, you may feel as if you’re spending your 
whole life in the restroom. During pregnancy, you need to urinate more fre-
quently for a variety of reasons. At the beginning of your pregnancy, your 
uterus is inside your pelvis. But toward the end of your first trimester (at 

80
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
around 12 weeks), your uterus expands enough to rise up into your abdomi-
nal cavity. Your enlarging uterus may compress your bladder, which both 
decreases its capacity and increases the feeling that you need to urinate. 
Also, your blood volume rises markedly during pregnancy, and that means 
the rate at which your kidneys produce urine also increases.
 
You can’t do much about your need to urinate frequently, except use common 
sense. Before going out for long (or even short) trips, empty your bladder so 
that you don’t find yourself needing facilities when none are available. Drink 
plenty of fluids during pregnancy to avoid dehydration, but try to drink more 
during the day and less in the evening so that you aren’t up all night going to 
the restroom. Coffee and tea contain caffeine (a diuretic, which increases the 
flow of urine) and may aggravate the situation, so try decreasing the amount 
of caffeine you consume. (For more information about caffeine, see Chapter 4.)
 
If you find yourself urinating even more than your pregnancy norm or if you 
feel any discomfort or burning or notice blood during urination, talk to your 
practitioner. When you’re pregnant, bacteria in your urine are more likely 
than usual to cause a urinary tract infection (see Chapter 17).
Headaches
Many pregnant women notice that they get headaches more often than they 
used to. These headaches may be the result of nausea, fatigue, hunger, the 
normal physiologic decrease in blood pressure that starts to occur at this 
time, tension, or even depression. Simple pain relievers like acetamino-
phen (for example, Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin or Advil), in rec-
ommended doses, are often the best treatment for headaches, including 
migraines. Some women find that a little caffeine can also alleviate symptoms 
of a headache. In fact, some women find relief from occasional headaches 
by taking a combination of acetaminophen and caffeine (Excedrin Tension 
Headache). Although this combination is fine to take once in a while, don’t 
use it on a regular basis.
 
Food and rest can usually cure headaches that are caused by nausea, fatigue, 
or hunger. So try eating and getting some extra sleep. If neither of those tac-
tics works, something else is probably causing your headaches.
If over-the-counter medications don’t relieve your headaches, talk with your 
practitioner about taking a mild tranquilizer or antimigraine medication. Base 
your decision on whether to use migraine medications on the severity of 
your problem. If your headaches are chronic or recurrent, you may need to 
take medications, despite their effects on your fetus. As always, consult with 
your practitioner before taking these medications.

81
 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
 
Avoid taking regular doses of aspirin unless recommended by your practitio-
ner, because adult doses of aspirin can affect platelet function (important in 
blood clotting).
 
If your headaches are severe and unremitting, you may need a thorough medi-
cal evaluation or a referral to a neurologist. Later on in pregnancy, a headache 
may signal the onset of a condition called preeclampsia (which we cover in 
Chapter 16). In that case, your headache may be accompanied by swelling of 
your hands and feet and by high blood pressure. If you suffer a severe head-
ache in the late second or third trimester, call your practitioner.
Constipation
 
About half of all pregnant women complain of constipation. When you’re preg-
nant, you may become constipated because the large amount of progesterone 
circulating in your bloodstream slows the activity of your digestive tract. The 
iron in prenatal vitamins may make matters worse. Try these suggestions to 
deal with the problem:
 
✓ Eat plenty of high-fiber foods. Bran cereals, fruits, and vegetables all 
are good sources of fiber. Some women find it helpful to eat some pop-
corn, but choose the low-fat kind, without all the butter and added oil. 
Check the fiber content on package labels and choose foods with higher 
fiber content.
 
✓ Drink plenty of water. Staying well hydrated helps keep food and waste 
moving through the digestive tract. Some juices (especially prune juice) 
may help, while others (such as apple juice) may only exacerbate the 
problem.
 
✓ Take stool softeners. A stool softener, such as Colace (docusate 
sodium), isn’t a laxative — it just keeps the stool soft. Stool softeners are 
safe during pregnancy, and you may take them two to three times a day. 
Avoid laxatives because they can cause abdominal cramping and, occa-
sionally, uterine contractions. For any person, pregnant or not, chronic 
laxative use should be avoided. If you’re extremely constipated, though, 
and aren’t at risk for preterm labor, you may want to talk to your prac-
titioner about the short-term use of a very mild laxative, like a glycerin 
suppository or milk of magnesia.
 
✓ Exercise as regularly as you can. Exercise helps constipation, so enjoy 
some safe exercise (even if it’s only walking).

82
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Cramps
You may feel a vague, menstrual-like cramping sensation during the first 
trimester. This is a very common symptom, so don’t worry. The cramping is 
probably related to the uterus growing and enlarging.
 
If, however, you experience cramping along with vaginal bleeding, give your 
practitioner a call. Although the majority of women who experience bleeding 
and cramping go on to have perfectly normal pregnancies, sometimes these 
two symptoms together are associated with miscarriage. Cramping alone, 
without bleeding, is unlikely to be a problem.
Going to Your First Prenatal 
Appointment
After the at-home pregnancy test reveals the news, set up an appointment 
with a practitioner. Make visits to your practitioner a regular part of your preg-
nancy, not only to ensure your health, but also to ensure your baby’s health. 
Your first prenatal visit may be your first meeting with the practitioner who will 
guide you through your pregnancy. (If you don’t already have a practitioner 
selected, see Chapter 2 for information on the kinds of care available and tips 
for choosing a healthcare provider.) Or you may have a long-standing relation-
ship with an OB/GYN or family-practice doctor with whom you’ve already dis-
cussed many of the topics that are typically covered at an initial prenatal visit.
 
If possible, bring the father-to-be for this initial visit. His family medical his-
tory and ethnic roots are important, too. Also, he should have a chance to ask 
questions, address his concerns, and find out what to look forward to in the 
coming months.
Your first prenatal visit usually lasts 30 to 40 minutes or more because your 
doctor has so much information to provide and so many topics to discuss. 
Subsequent visits are usually much shorter, sometimes only 5 to 10 minutes 
long. The frequency of your visits depends on your particular needs and any 
special risk factors you may have, but in general they’re about every four 
weeks during the first trimester. At these visits, the nurse or practitioner 
checks your urine, blood pressure, and weight, and the baby’s heartbeat.
Understanding the consultation
During your first visit, your practitioner discusses with you your medical and 
obstetrical history. She asks about various aspects of your physical health, 
as well as elements of your lifestyle that may affect your pregnancy.

83
 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
Lifestyle
Your practitioner asks about your occupation to find out whether your job is 
sedentary or active, whether you spend your days standing or lifting heavy 
objects, or whether you work nights or long shifts. She also asks you about 
your general lifestyle — for example, smoking, heavy alcohol use, dietary 
restrictions, and exercise patterns.
Date of your last menstrual period
Your practitioner questions you about the start date of your last menstrual 
period to determine your due date. (For more information on calculating 
your due date, see Chapter 2.) If you don’t know exactly when your last 
period began, try to remember the exact date of conception. If you’re unsure 
about either of these dates, your practitioner may want to check on how far 
along you are by scheduling an ultrasound exam.
Obstetrical and gynecological history
If you haven’t already seen your practitioner for a preconceptional visit (see 
Chapter 1 for more details), she asks you about your obstetrical and gyne-
cological history, including any prior pregnancies and any experiences with 
fibroid tumors, vaginal infections, and other gynecological problems. Your 
past history can help determine how best to manage this pregnancy. For 
example, if you have a history of preterm labor (see Chapter 16) or gesta-
tional diabetes (Chapter 17), knowing that history prepares your practitioner 
for the possibility that it may happen again.
Pregnancy after infertility treatment
If you conceived with infertility treatments, inform your practitioner of this 
during your first prenatal visit because it brings up several points that need 
to be addressed. Most of the impact of infertility treatment on pregnancy 
outcomes is related to the higher incidence of multi-fetal pregnancies — 
twins and more. In general, children born to couples who have gone through 
in-vitro fertilization are as healthy as those who were conceived spontane-
ously. Recently, some controversy has cropped up in medical literature 
about an increase in certain birth defects in children born after IVF, as well as 
an increase in certain chromosomal abnormalities after ICSI (intracytoplas-
mic sperm injection). Although some studies suggest the incidence may be 
slightly higher, other studies document no increase at all.
Medical problems
Your practitioner asks you about any medical problems you have had and 
any surgeries you have undergone, including problems that aren’t gynecolog-
ical in nature. Certain medical conditions may affect pregnancy, and others 
don’t. She also asks you about any allergies to medications you may have. 
Tell your practitioner so she can know everything about you and your health.

84
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Family medical histories
The family medical histories of both you and the baby’s father are impor-
tant for two reasons. First, your practitioner can identify pregnancy-related 
conditions that can recur from generation to generation, like having twins or 
exceptionally large babies. The other reason is to identify serious problems 
within your family that your baby can inherit. Blood tests can screen for 
some of these problems, such as cystic fibrosis. If there is a family history 
of mental retardation or learning disabilities, discuss the option for Fragile 
X syndrome screening with your doctor or genetic counselor. Fragile X syn-
drome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation and results 
from an abnormality in the X chromosome. Prenatal diagnosis is available for 
Fragile X syndrome if your family history suggests this possibility.
Ethnic roots
Even if you and your partner have family histories that are free of any known 
genetic disorders, your ethnic backgrounds are important because some 
genetic disorders occur more frequently in one ethnicity than others. Jewish 
people of Eastern European descent, for example, are ten times more likely 
than others to carry the rare gene for Tay-Sachs, a disease of the nervous 
system that is usually fatal in early childhood. French Canadians and Cajuns 
(from Louisiana) also have a higher-than-normal risk of carrying this gene. 
Most of the time, a simple blood test can determine whether you’re a carrier 
of this disease.
 
Tay-Sachs is inherited in what’s known as a recessive manner, which means 
that both parents would need to be carriers to place the baby at risk for 
having the disease. Being a carrier doesn’t mean that you have Tay-Sachs, 
only that you carry a gene for it. Most genetic counselors recommend that 
both members of a couple undergo the blood tests for carrier status because 
it often takes several weeks to find out the results. If one member of a couple 
is tested only after the other is found to be a carrier, the whole process can 
take a long time, perhaps even too long to leave time for certain prenatal diag-
nostic tests (like CVS — chorionic villus sampling — or amniocentesis, which 
we describe later in this chapter and in Chapter 8).
Although Tay-Sachs and some other conditions are found more frequently 
among the Jewish population, individuals from other ethnic groups can 
still be carriers, but this is much less common. For this reason, even if only 
one member of a couple is Jewish, both should still be tested, if possible. 
Although at this time only Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, and 
familial dysautonomia testing is recommended by the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, here is a list of genetic disorders for which 
screening is available to couples of Jewish descent:

 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
Another ethnically selective medical condition is sickle-cell anemia, a blood 
disorder that’s especially prevalent among people with African or Hispanic 
ancestors. This condition, too, is recessive, so both members of a couple 
must be carriers for the baby to be at risk of inheriting the disease.
People whose ancestors come from Italy, Greece, and other Mediterranean 
countries are at elevated risk of having — and passing to their children — 
genes for the blood disorder beta-thalassemia, also known as Mediterranean 
anemia or Cooley’s anemia. Among Asians, the analogous blood problem is 
alpha-thalassemia. Both of these disorders produce abnormalities in hemo-
globin (the protein in red blood cells that holds onto oxygen) and therefore 
result in varying degrees of anemia. Like Tay-Sachs and sickle-cell anemia, 
both parents have to carry the gene in order for their baby to be at risk of 
having the disease.

Screening for cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common 
genetic diseases in the United States, with an 
incidence of about 1 in 3,500. CF is also a reces-
sive condition, like Tay-Sachs (see the “Ethnic 
roots” section). More than 1,250 different genetic 
mutations have been associated with CF. At this 
time, obstetricians and geneticists recommend 
that CF screening be offered to all pregnant cou-
ples. Because the chance of being a carrier is 
greater in the Ashkenazi Jewish and Caucasian 
populations, screening (by a blood test) should 
be performed if at least one partner is Jewish or 
Caucasian. Screening for the 23 most common 
mutations will pick up 57 to 97 percent of carri-
ers of cystic fibrosis, depending on the ethnic 
background. (For example, it detects 97 percent 
of carriers among the Ashkenazi Jewish popu-
lation, 80 percent of carriers in the Northern 
European Caucasian population, and 57 percent 
of carriers in the American Hispanic population.) 
Speak to your doctor about CF screening during 
your first prenatal visit.

The risks of inheritable diseases overlap from one ethnic or geographic 
group to another. Genes get passed around among the various populations 
whenever the parents are from different ethnic groups. But you can roughly 
gauge whether your ancestry puts you at an elevated risk of carrying genes 
for certain diseases.

Some people don’t know very much about their ethnic background or family 
medical history, perhaps because they were adopted or haven’t had much 
contact with their biological families. If this situation is true in your case, don’t 
worry. Keep in mind that the chances that both you and your partner carry a 
gene for a particular disorder are extremely low.
Considering the physical exam
At your first prenatal visit, your practitioner examines your head, neck, 
breasts, heart, lungs, abdomen, and extremities. She also performs an inter-
nal exam (see Figure 5-3). During this exam, your practitioner evaluates your 
uterus, cervix, and ovaries, and performs, if due, a PAP test (cervix cancer 
and pre-cancer screening). If you feel you also should be tested for the pos-
sibility of sexually transmitted diseases, inform your physician because the 
PAP test doesn’t screen for all of them.

 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
After the exam, you and your practitioner will discuss the overall plan for your 
pregnancy and talk about any possible problems. You can also discuss what 
medications you can take while you’re pregnant, when you should call for 
help, and what tests you can expect to undergo throughout your pregnancy.
Eyeing the standard tests
Brace yourself: You’re probably going to be stuck with a needle and have to 
pee in a cup during your first prenatal visit. Here’s a look at the standard pro-
cedures, including blood and urine tests.
Get ready for the prick: Blood tests
On your first prenatal visit, your practitioner will draw your blood for a 
bunch of standard tests to check your general health, as well as to make sure 
you are immune to certain infections. The following tests are routine:
 
✓ A standard test for blood type, Rh factor, and antibody status. The 
blood type refers to whether your blood is type A, B, AB, or O and 
whether you’re Rh-positive or Rh-negative. The antibody test is designed 
to tell whether special blood-group antibodies to certain antigens (like 
the Rh antigen) are present. (See Chapter 16 for more about the Rh 
factor and the implications of blood incompatibilities.)
 
✓ Complete blood count (CBC). This test checks for anemia, which refers 
to a low blood count. At the same time, this test also checks your plate-
let count (a component of blood important in clotting).
 
✓ VDRL or RPR. These tests check for syphilis, a sexually transmitted 
disease. They’re very accurate, but sometimes they produce a false 
positive result if the patient has other conditions, such as lupus or the 
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (see Chapter 17). However, these 
kinds of false positive results are usually weakly positive. These tests 
are nonspecific, so in order to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis, another, 
more specific blood test should be performed. Because it’s essential 
that syphilis be adequately treated, make sure you receive a test. In fact, 
most states require it. Unfortunately, the incidence of syphilis is on the 
rise in the United States.
 
✓ Hepatitis B. This test checks for evidence of the hepatitis viruses. These 
viruses come in several different types, and the hepatitis B virus is one 
that can be present without producing actual symptoms. In fact, some 
women are diagnosed only during a blood test, such as the one per-
formed during pregnancy.

88
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Rubella. Your practitioner also checks for immunity to rubella (also 
called German measles). Most women have been vaccinated against 
rubella or, because they have had the illness in the past, their blood 
carries antibodies, which is why the risk of contracting German measles 
during pregnancy is so rare. Most practitioners test to see that the 
mother is immune to rubella during the very first prenatal visit. Any 
woman who isn’t immune is counseled to be careful to avoid contact 
with anyone who has the illness. A practitioner also advises these 
women to get vaccinated against rubella soon after they deliver, so that 
they aren’t susceptible in subsequent pregnancies.
 
✓ HIV. Some states require that healthcare providers routinely ask 
whether you want to be checked for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
Because medication is available to reduce the risk of transmission to the 
baby, as well as to slow disease progression in the mother, being aware 
of your HIV status is very important. A doctor can usually perform this 
test at the same time as the other prenatal blood tests.
Doctors sometimes need to perform other tests during your first prenatal 
visit. These additional tests include the following:
 
✓ Glucose screen. You usually get this test around 24 to 28 weeks, but 
your doctor may administer it in the first trimester if you’re at a high 
risk of developing gestational diabetes. Check out Chapter 6 for the 
details of how the testing is done and Chapter 17 to find out why treat-
ing gestational diabetes is important.
 
✓ Varicella. Your doctor may conduct this test to check for immunity to 
varicella (chickenpox). If you’re unsure whether or not you’ve had chick-
enpox or you know that you haven’t had it, let your practitioner know so 
that you can be tested for immunity. For more detailed information on 
varicella, see Chapter 17.
 
✓ Toxoplasmosis. Sometimes a doctor administers a test in order to check 
for immunity to toxoplasmosis, which is a type of parasitic infection. In 
the United States, testing for toxoplasmosis isn’t considered routine 
unless you’re at a higher risk for toxoplasmosis. For example, if you 
have an outdoor cat and you’re the one who changes the litter box, your 
practitioner is likely to send off a test to check for past or recent expo-
sure. If you’re in France, where the incidence of toxoplasmosis is much 
higher, your practitioner will probably recommend that you be tested. 
See Chapter 17 for more information on toxoplasmosis.
 
✓ Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Testing for CMV infection, a common child-
hood infection, isn’t routine during pregnancy. However, if you have a 
lot of contact with school-age children who may have the infection, your 
practitioner may suggest you have this test performed. As with toxoplas-
mosis, the blood test looks for evidence of past or recent infection. See 
Chapter 17 for more details on CMV.

89
 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
Take a quick trip to the bathroom: Urine tests
Each time you visit your practitioner during your pregnancy, including the 
first prenatal visit, you’re asked to leave a sample of urine. Your practitioner 
uses the urine sample to check for the presence of glucose (for a possible 
sign of diabetes) and protein (for evidence of preeclampsia).
Sneak the first look at your baby: Ultrasound
An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the uterus and the 
baby inside it. Ultrasound examinations don’t involve radiation, and the pro-
cedure is safe for both you and your baby. Your practitioner may suggest 
that you undergo a first-trimester ultrasound exam. Often, this ultrasound 
is performed transvaginally, which means that a special ultrasound probe is 
inserted into the vagina. The advantage to this technique is that the probe, or 
transducer, is closer to the fetus, so a much clearer view is attained than with 
a standard transabdominal ultrasound examination.

Some women worry that a transvaginal probe inserted into the vagina could 
harm the baby. Although understandable, you don’t need to worry. The probe 
is completely safe.
The following are evaluated during a first-trimester ultrasound exam:
 
✓ The accuracy of your due date: An ultrasound can show whether the 
fetus is any larger or smaller than the date of your last menstrual period 
would suggest. If the crown-rump measurement (which measures the 
fetus from the crown of the head to the rump; refer to Figure 5-2) is more 
than three or four days off your due date, your doctor may change your 
due date. An ultrasound in the first trimester is actually more accurate 
than a later ultrasound in confirming or establishing your due date.
 
✓ Fetal viability: By five to six weeks into your pregnancy, an ultrasound 
can detect a fetal heartbeat. After a fetal heartbeat has been identified, 
the risk of miscarriage drops significantly (to about 3 percent). Prior to 
five weeks, the fetus itself may not be visible; instead, the ultrasound 
may show only the gestational sac.
 
✓ Fetal abnormalities: Although a complete ultrasound examination to 
detect structural abnormalities in the fetus usually isn’t performed 
until about 20 weeks, some problems may already be visible by 11 to 
12 weeks. Much of the brain, spine, limbs, abdomen, and urinary tract 
structures may be seen with transvaginal ultrasound. In addition, 
the presence of a thickening behind the neck of the fetus (known as 
increased nuchal translucency) may help to indicate an added risk for cer-
tain genetic or chromosomal conditions (see Chapter 8).

90
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Fetal number: An ultrasound shows whether you’re carrying more than 
one fetus. In addition, the appearance of the membrane separating the 
babies, as well as the placental locations, helps to indicate whether 
the babies share one placenta or have separate placentas. We go into 
greater detail about this topic in Chapter 15.
 
✓ The condition of your ovaries: An ultrasound can reveal abnormalities 
or cysts in your ovaries. Sometimes an ultrasound shows a small cyst, 
called a corpus luteal cyst. This is a cyst that forms at the site where the 
egg was released. Over the course of three or four months, it gradually 
goes away. Two other types of cysts, called dermoid cysts and simple 
cysts, are unrelated to the pregnancy and may be found incidentally 
during an ultrasound exam. Whether removal of these types of cysts is 
necessary and when they should be removed depends on the size of the 
cyst and any symptoms you may be having.
 
✓ The presence of fibroid tumors: Also called fibroids, these are benign 
overgrowths of the muscle of the uterus. We go into more details about 
these in Chapter 17.
 
✓ Location of the pregnancy: Occasionally, the pregnancy may be 
located outside the uterus, which is called an ectopic pregnancy (see the 
“Ectopic pregnancy” section later in this chapter for more information).
Recognizing Causes for Concern
In each trimester, a few things may, in some cases, go less than smoothly. 
The following sections describe some of the things that can happen during 
the first trimester of your pregnancy and what they may mean to you.
Bleeding
Early in pregnancy, around the time of your missed period, experiencing a 
little bleeding from the vagina isn’t uncommon. The amount of bleeding is 
usually less than what you would expect with a period and lasts for only one 
or two days. This is called implantation bleeding, and it happens when the fer-
tilized egg attaches to the uterus’s lining. Bleeding due to implantation isn’t a 
cause for concern, but many women may be confused by it and mistake it for 
their period.

Bleeding also may occur later in the first trimester, but it doesn’t necessarily 
indicate a miscarriage. About one-third of women experience bleeding during 
the first trimester, and the majority of them go on to have perfectly healthy 
babies. Bleeding is especially common in women carrying more than one 
fetus — and again, most go on to have normal pregnancies. Bright red bleed-
ing usually indicates active bleeding, while dark staining usually indicates old 

91
 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
blood that is making its way out from the cervix and vagina. Most of the time, 
an ultrasound exam doesn’t show any evidence of the source of the bleeding. 
However, sometimes a collection of blood, known as a subchorionic or retro-
placental hemorrhage or collection, is visible and indicates an area of bleeding 
from behind the placenta. It usually takes several weeks for this blood to be 
reabsorbed. During this time, some dark blood continues to pass out through 
the cervix and vagina.
 
In some cases, bleeding can be the first sign of an impending miscarriage (see 
the next section for more information). In this case, the bleeding often accom-
panies abdominal cramping. However, keep in mind that the vast majority of 
women who experience bleeding go on to have a completely normal pregnancy.
 
If you notice some bleeding, let your practitioner know. If the bleeding is a 
small amount and not associated with a lot of abdominal cramping, it isn’t 
an emergency. If you’re bleeding very heavily (much more than a period), 
call your practitioner as soon as you can. She may want to do an ultrasound 
and perform a pelvic exam to investigate the cause of the bleeding and see 
whether the pregnancy is still viable and located inside the uterus. Most of 
the time, your practitioner can do very little about the bleeding. Some doctors 
may suggest that you rest at home for a few days and avoid exercise and sex. 
No scientific data supports these instructions, but given that no really good 
alternatives exist, they certainly don’t hurt.
Miscarriage
The great majority of pregnancies proceed normally. But about one in five 
end in early miscarriage, often before a woman even knows she’s pregnant. 
If a miscarriage occurs early in a pregnancy, you may mistake it for a regular 
menstrual period. About half the time, chromosomal abnormalities in the 
embryo cause the miscarriage. In another 20 percent of cases, the embryo 
may have structural defects that are too small to be detectable by ultrasound 
or pathological examination. Note: Having one miscarriage doesn’t mean that 
you have an increased chance of it happening again. Also, no routine every-
day activities can cause a miscarriage.
 
Miscarriage may lead to cramping and bleeding. You may feel abdominal pains 
that are stronger than menstrual cramps, and you may pass fetal and placen-
tal tissue. In cases where all the tissue is passed, your practitioner doesn’t 
need to do anything else. Often, though, some tissue remains in your uterus, 
and you may need medication to encourage its passing or to have a D&C (dila-
tion and curettage) procedure, designed to empty the uterus. Your doctor 
dilates, or gently opens, the cervix with surgical instruments and then empties 
the remaining contents of the uterus with a suction device and/or a scraping 
of the uterus. A D&C can be performed either in the doctor’s office or in an 
operating suite, depending on the doctor, the gestational age, and any other 
important medical problems.

92
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Sometimes, you may have no overt signs of miscarriage. Your practitioner 
may discover during a routine prenatal visit that the fetus is no longer alive, 
which is known as a missed abortion. If you have a missed abortion very early 
in your pregnancy, a D&C may not be necessary. But if it happens later in 
the first trimester, you may need to have a D&C to reduce the risk of heavy 
bleeding or incomplete passage of tissue. Depending on your obstetrical his-
tory and your desire to try to determine the cause of the miscarriage, you 
may decide to have the tissue sent for genetic analysis (to find out whether 
the chromosomes were normal or abnormal). Because half of all miscarriages 
are due to chromosomal abnormalities, it may be useful to find out whether 
this is the cause.
 
Unfortunately, most miscarriages can’t be prevented. Many, if not most, 
of them may simply be nature’s way of handling an abnormal pregnancy. 
However, having a miscarriage doesn’t mean that you can’t have a perfectly 
normal pregnancy in the future. In fact, even in women who have had two con-
secutive miscarriages, the chances are very good (about 70 percent) that the 
next pregnancy will be successful without any special treatment.
 
Any woman who experiences two or three consecutive miscarriages may 
have some underlying condition that can be identified and possibly treated. 
She should have a complete physical examination and undergo special tests 
to look for causes. Some women who have even one miscarriage may want to 
be examined. If you miscarry, discuss with your practitioner the possibility of 
undergoing certain tests or sending fetal or placental tissue to a laboratory for 
chromosomal analysis.
Ectopic pregnancy
An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside the 
uterus — in one of the fallopian tubes, the ovary, the abdomen, or the cervix. 
An ectopic pregnancy is a serious threat to the mother’s health. Fortunately, 
ultrasound has advanced to the point that it can detect ectopic pregnancies 
very early.
 
Signs of an ectopic pregnancy that you may notice include vaginal bleeding, 
abdominal pain, dizziness, and feeling faint. You may not have any symptoms, 
in which case your doctor identifies the condition during an ultrasound. Your 
doctor can treat the problem in one of several ways, depending on the loca-
tion of the embryo or fetus, how far along the pregnancy is, and the particu-
lar symptoms you are experiencing. Unfortunately, a doctor can’t move the 
embryo or fetus to the uterus so that the pregnancy can continue as normal.

 Chapter 5: The First Trimester
For Dads: Reacting to the News
“Honey, I think I’m pregnant!” You hear the words that millions of other men 
before you have heard and you feel pure joy and excitement. Well, not really. 
You probably also feel some concern, even fear, for the future. Rest assured 
that these feelings are completely normal. You may be concerned about how 
parenthood may change your relationship with your partner. You may be 
concerned about how parenthood could change your life in general. You may 
worry that you and your partner won’t be able to support a family financially, 
or that you won’t be a good parent. Just keep in mind that your partner’s feel-
ings about having a baby aren’t all that different. She’s probably having a few 
worries herself. So talk to her about what you’re both feeling.
A woman’s role in pregnancy is undoubtedly pivotal, but, biologically speak-
ing, she can’t do it alone. Your part is vital, too, right from the start. Your 
sperm’s DNA provides half the baby’s total DNA. And your share of DNA 
determines the baby’s sex. If you donate an X chromosome, it’s a girl; if you 
hand in a Y, it’s a boy. (A woman’s egg always contains an X chromosome.)
Sperm, of course, is only the first contribution you make to the project. The 
support you provide the mother during pregnancy is at least as important. 
Just as pregnancy is a time of tremendous change in a woman’s body, so is 
it a time of tremendous emotional change for both the father and mother, 
and it’s a time of transition for you as a couple — a transition to parenthood. 
Recognizing this fact can make it easier for you to become comfortable with 
the whole process and play your role as well as possible.
 
After both of you get over the initial surprise, you’re faced with the realities of 
pregnancy during the first trimester. Your partner is likely to feel exceptionally 
tired and may need to urinate with remarkable frequency. Chances are she also 
has morning sickness (see the earlier section, “Any-time-of-day sickness”). You 
can be supportive by doing the following:
 
✓ Assume more of the day-to-day responsibilities of running the house-
hold. (Yes, that means cleaning the house, doing some laundry, washing 
the dishes, and even cooking.)
 
✓ Give her the extra time she needs to rest. A cat nap here and there can 
make a world of difference, but sometimes she may need to hibernate 
for a few hours when the fatigue gets really rough.
 
✓ Be aware of what a drag it can be to be nauseated all the time. Don’t 
get too upset if she can’t stand to be around steak (your favorite) or 
some other food.

94
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Go out of your way to help her. If she asks you to run out for more pick-
les and ketchup at midnight (Joanne’s favorite first-trimester snack), just 
smile and ask, “Whole or slices?” “Dill or gherkins?”
 
✓ Try to make room in your schedule to accompany your partner to her 
first prenatal visit to her practitioner. Your participation is important 
not only because it telegraphs your support, but also because you may 
need to answer questions about your family medical history. In addition, 
you probably have questions to ask the practitioner.
You can make life easier for both of you. Studies clearly show that pregnancy, 
labor, and delivery are associated with fewer complications when the father 
is involved and supportive.

▶ Looking — and feeling — like you’re going to have a baby
▶ Knowing when to be concerned
T
he second trimester, which encompasses the three months between 
weeks 13 and 26, is often the most enjoyable part of pregnancy. The feel-
ings of nausea and fatigue so common during the first trimester are usually 
gone, and you feel more energetic and comfortable. The second trimester is 
a very exciting time because you can feel the baby moving within you and 
you’re finally starting to show. During the second trimester, blood tests, pre-
natal tests, and ultrasound (sonogram) can confirm that the baby is healthy 
and growing normally. And many women find they can finally grasp the con-
cept that they’ll soon be having a baby. The second trimester is often the 
time you start sharing the exciting news with family, friends, and co-workers.
Discovering How Your 
Baby Is Developing
Your baby grows rapidly during the second trimester, as you can see in 
Figure 6-1. The fetus measures about 3 inches (8 centimeters) long at 13 
weeks. By 26 weeks, it’s about 14 inches (35 centimeters) and weighs about 
2 1/4 pounds (1,022 grams). Somewhere between weeks 14 and 16, the limbs 
begin to elongate and start to look like arms and legs. Coordinated arm and 
leg movements are observable on ultrasound, too. Between 18 and 22 weeks, 
you may begin to feel fetal movements, although they don’t necessarily occur 
regularly throughout the day.

Weeks
The baby’s head, which was large in relation to the body during the first 
trimester, becomes more in proportion as the body catches up. The bones 
solidify and are recognizable on ultrasound. Early in the second trimester, 
the fetus looks something like an alien (think E.T.), but by 26 weeks, it looks 
much more like a human baby.
The fetus also performs many recognizable activities. It not only moves, but 
also undergoes regular periods of sleeping and wakefulness and can hear and 
swallow. Lung development increases markedly between 20 and 25 weeks. 
By 24 weeks, lung cells begin to secrete surfactant, a chemical substance that 
enables the lungs to stay expanded. Between 26 and 28 weeks, the eyes — 
which had been fused shut — open, and hair (called lanugo) appears on the 
head and body. Fat deposits form under the skin, and the central nervous 
system matures dramatically.
At 23 to 24 weeks, the fetus is considered viable, which means that if it were 
born at this time, it would have a chance of surviving in a center with a neo-
natal unit experienced in caring for very premature babies. A premature baby 
born at 28 weeks (nearly three months early) and cared for in an intensive 
care unit has an excellent chance of survival.
Most mothers begin to feel their babies move at about this time. Knowing 
for sure when you first feel your baby moving inside you is difficult. Many 
women sense fluttering movements (called quickening) at about 16 to 20 
weeks. Not every woman can tell that sensation is actually the baby moving. 
Some think it’s just gas (and maybe you did eat too much chili) — but most 
likely, it’s the baby. Around 20 to 22 weeks, the fetal movements are much 
easier to identify, but they still aren’t consistent. Over the course of the next 
four weeks, they fall into a more regular pattern.

97
 Chapter 6: The Second Trimester
Different babies have different movement patterns. You may notice your 
baby tends to move more at night — perhaps to prepare you for all the sleep-
less nights you’ll have after he is born! Or you may simply be more aware of 
the baby’s movements at night because you’re more sedentary at that time. If 
this is your second (or third or fourth . . .) child, you may start to feel move-
ments a couple of weeks earlier.
 
If you haven’t felt your baby move at all by 22 weeks, let your practitioner 
know. He may recommend an ultrasound, especially if you haven’t had one 
already, to check the baby. A common explanation for not feeling the baby’s 
movements is that the placenta is implanted on the anterior (front) wall of the 
uterus between the baby and your skin. The placenta acts as a cushion and 
delays the time when you first feel movements.
Clothing yourself in maternity garb
Thank goodness the fashion industry has rec-
ognized that women continue to care about 
looking chic and professional when they’re 
pregnant — which doesn’t necessarily mean 
wearing those choir-boy blouses with big bows 
at the neck. Many women look forward to shop-
ping for maternity clothes, while others aim to 
stay in their usual clothes for as long as possi-
ble. Keep in mind that you’re only going to need 
maternity clothes for a few months, and they’re 
not cheap. Here are a few suggestions:
 ✓ Don’t plan too far ahead; buy clothes only 
as you need them. Anticipating how big 
you’ll become and whether you’ll carry the 
baby high up in your belly or down low is 
difficult. When you do shop, buy clothes 
that fit comfortably but have enough room 
to accommodate further growth.
 ✓ Don’t be shy about accepting hand-me-
downs. Women rarely wear out their 
maternity clothes. Your friends are probably 
happy to see their clothes get more use.
 ✓ Look for consignment shops, second-
hand stores, and garage sales. They’re 
good places to find inexpensive maternity 
clothes.
 ✓ If you have trouble finding maternity clothes 
in your style, remember that you can often 
go a long way through your pregnancy in 
regular leggings and big shirts or sweaters. 
(Joanne never had to buy any maternity 
clothes at all.)
 ✓ Perhaps the most important items to buy 
are comfortable shoes and roomier bras. 
Both shoe size and bra size can increase 
during pregnancy.
 ✓ You don’t have to wear special maternity 
underwear — unless you find it especially 
comfortable. Many kinds of regular under-
wear, especially the bikini kind, fit well 
under a bulging belly.

After 26 to 28 weeks, if you stop feeling the baby move as much as usual, call 
your practitioner. By 28 weeks, you should feel movement at least six times 
an hour after you eat dinner. If you aren’t sure whether the baby is moving 
normally, lie down on your left side and count the movements. If the baby 
moves —any movement counts — at least six times in an hour, be reassured 
that the baby is okay. On the other hand, if you feel that the baby’s move-
ments are still less than they should be, call your practitioner.
Understanding Your Changing Body
By 12 weeks, your uterus begins to rise out of your pelvis. Your practitioner 
can feel the top of the uterus through your abdominal wall. By 20 weeks, the 
top of your uterus reaches the level of your navel. Then each week, your 
uterus grows by about one centimeter (1/2 inch). Your doctor may run a tape 
measure from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus to measure the 
fundal height (see Chapter 3) to see that your uterus and the baby are grow-
ing appropriately. Many women begin to show at 16 weeks, although looking 
pregnant varies a great deal. Some women look pregnant at 12 weeks; others 
aren’t obvious until 28 weeks.
Many of the changes you experience have little to do with your belly’s size. 
Rather, they involve your baby’s development and your body’s continuing 
adaptation to pregnancy. You may experience some, none, or all the symp-
toms in this section.
Forgetfulness and clumsiness
Until she was pregnant, Joanne never would have believed that misplacing 
keys, bumping into furniture, and dropping things could be real side effects 
of pregnancy. We don’t know of any medical explanation for these effects, but 
some women do feel they’re more scatterbrained and clumsy. If it happens 
to you, don’t worry. You’re not losing your mind. Look at it this way: Now 
you have an excuse for having forgotten your best friend’s birthday. And 
rest assured you’ll go back to being your brilliant, coordinated self after your 
baby is born.
Gas
You may find that you develop the annoying and embarrassing tendency to 
burp and pass gas at inopportune times during this trimester. (Now you can 
duel it out with your husband.) If it’s any consolation, you’re not the first 
pregnant woman to run into this problem. Unfortunately, though, you can 

99
 Chapter 6: The Second Trimester
do very little about it — besides getting a dog to blame it on. Try to avoid 
becoming constipated (see Chapter 4) because that can make things worse. 
Also avoid eating large meals that may leave you feeling bloated and uncom-
fortable or foods that you know make the problem even worse.
Hair and nail growth
While you’re pregnant, your fingernails and toenails may become stronger 
than they’ve ever been before and grow at an unprecedented rate. Manicures 
are safe when done in a reputable, clean salon and often relieve stress, so sit 
back and enjoy your beautiful nails!
Pregnancy also speeds up hair growth. Unfortunately, some women find 
hair also begins growing in unusual places — on their face or stomach, for 
example. Waxing, plucking, or shaving the unwanted hair is safe, but hair 
removal creams (depilatories) contain chemicals that haven’t been exten-
sively studied. Because safer alternatives are readily available, we suggest 
avoiding these creams. Take comfort in the likelihood that the unwanted hair 
will disappear after your baby is born.
Heartburn
Heartburn — the burning sensation you feel when stomach acids rise into 
your esophagus — is common during pregnancy. Heartburn has two basic 
causes (neither of which validates the old myth that heartburn means your 
baby will have a lot of hair). First, the high level of progesterone your body 
is producing can slow digestion and relax the sphincter muscle between the 
esophagus and the stomach, which normally prevents the upward movement 
of stomach acids. Second, as the uterus grows, it presses upward on the 
stomach, which can push stomach acids into the esophagus. (See Figure 6-2.)
 
You may get relief from heartburn by following these suggestions:
 
✓ Eat small, frequent meals rather than large ones.
 
✓ Carry an antacid when you’re away from home.
 
✓ Carry a package of dry crackers to munch on when you feel heartburn. 
They may neutralize the gas.
 
✓ Avoid spicy, fatty, and greasy foods.
 
✓ Avoid large amounts of soda, caffeine, and coffee.
 
✓ Avoid eating just before bedtime, because heartburn occurs most 
readily when you lie down. Also, try sleeping with your head elevated 
on several pillows.

100
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ If your heartburn becomes intolerable, talk to your doctor about taking a 
prescription treatment. Many effective heartburn treatments are consid-
ered to be safe for use during pregnancy. The use of famotidine (Pepsid), 
ranitidine (Zantac), and omeprazole (Prilosec/Nexium) in the first trimes-
ter has been studied, and researchers found no increased risk for birth 
defects, preterm labor, or problems with fetal growth. (The first trimes-
ter is the period of greatest risk, so medications proven safe for use in 
the first trimester are presumably safe in the second trimester, too.)

Between 18 and 24 weeks, you may feel a sharp pain or a dull ache near your 
groin on either or both sides. When you move quickly or stand, you may 
notice it worsen, and it may fade if you lie down. This pain is called round liga-
ment pain. The round ligaments are bands of fibrous tissue on each side of the 
uterus that attach the top of the uterus to the labia. The pain occurs because 
as the uterus grows, the ligaments stretch. The pain can be quite uncomfort-
able and sometimes can stop you in your tracks, but it’s normal. The good 
news is that it usually goes away — or at least lessens considerably — after 
24 weeks.
Sometime in the middle of the second trimester (the exact time varies), you 
may start to feel mild, short-lived contractions or cramps. These are referred 
to as Braxton-Hicks contractions and are nothing to worry about. They often 
are more noticeable when you’re walking or physically active and then go 
away when you get off your feet. If they become uncomfortable and regular 
(more than six in an hour), call your practitioner.
Nasal congestion
The increased blood flow that occurs during pregnancy can also cause stuffi-
ness and some swelling of the mucous membranes inside your nose. This, 
in turn, can lead to postnasal drip and, ultimately, a chronic cough. Nasal 
saline drops may provide some relief and are perfectly safe to use during 
pregnancy. Keeping the air in your home or office well humidified also helps. 
Nasal sprays and decongestants work, too, but avoid using these medications 
for more than a few days at a time. You (or your partner, especially) may 
notice that suddenly you’re snoring like never before! This common symp-
tom again relates to the increase in nasal congestion. Our advice? Buy your 
partner a good set of earplugs!
Nosebleeds and bleeding gums
Because of the higher volume of blood coursing through your body to sup-
port your pregnancy, you may experience some bleeding from small blood 
vessels in your nose and gums. This bleeding usually stops by itself, but 
you can help by applying slight pressure to the point of bleeding. If bleeding 
becomes particularly heavy or frequent, call your doctor.
 
Using a softer toothbrush may help to minimize bleeding when you brush 
your teeth.

102
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Skin changes
The hormones coursing through your body at soaring levels may make 
strange things happen to your skin. These changes, illustrated in Figure 6-3, 
don’t occur in all women, and if they do happen to you, rest assured they 
usually fade away after the baby is born.

✓ You may notice a dark line, called the linea nigra, on your lower abdo-
men running from your pubic bone up to your navel. This line may be 
more noticeable in women with relatively dark skin. Fair-skinned women 
often don’t develop this line at all.
 
✓ The skin on your face may also darken in a masklike distribution around 
your cheeks, nose, and eyes. This darkening is called chloasma or the 
mask of pregnancy. Sun exposure makes it even darker. Use a facial 
cream with sun block to minimize the effects of the sun on chloasma.
 
✓ Red spots, called spider angiomas, may suddenly appear anywhere on 
your body. Press on them, and they probably turn white. These spots 
are concentrations of blood vessels caused by the high level of estrogen 
in your body. They’ll probably disappear after delivery.
 
✓ Some women notice a reddish coloring on the palms of their hands. 
Known as palmar erythema, this coloring is another estrogen effect, and 
it, too, will go away.
 
✓ Skin tags (small, benign skin growths) are also a common occurrence, 
although it isn’t totally clear why they develop. Fortunately, they, 
too, fade away or disappear after pregnancy. Because they’re likely to 
resolve in time, you don’t need to rush to the dermatologist to have 
them removed, unless they’re really bothersome.
Checking In: Prenatal Visits
In the second trimester, you’re likely to see your practitioner about once 
every four weeks. At each visit, he checks your weight, your blood pressure, 
your urine, and the fetal heart rate. You may want to bring up any questions 
you have about fetal movement, childbirth classes, your weight gain, and any 
unusual symptoms or discomforts you may have.
Your practitioner routinely performs a number of tests during your second 
trimester to find out whether you’re at risk for such complications as dia-
betes, anemia, or birth defects. You may also have an ultrasound exam, so 
that your practitioner can see things, such as whether you’re having twins, 
whether your baby is growing normally, and whether you have plenty of 
amniotic fluid. Check out Chapter 8 for more information on second-trimester 
prenatal tests.
Recognizing Causes for Concern
In this section, we talk about certain problems that can develop during the 
second trimester and symptoms that you should discuss with your practitioner.

104
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Bleeding
 
Some women experience bleeding in the second trimester. Possible causes 
include a low-lying placenta (placenta previa), premature labor, cervical 
incompetence, or placental abruption (all covered in Chapter 16). Sometimes 
the doctor can’t find a cause. If you do experience bleeding, it doesn’t neces-
sarily mean you will have a miscarriage, but you should call your doctor. Most 
often he recommends you have an ultrasound exam and be monitored to 
make sure that you’re not contracting. Bleeding may increase the risk for pre-
mature delivery, so your doctor may recommend that your pregnancy come 
under extra-close surveillance.
Fetal abnormality
Although the vast majority of pregnancies proceed normally, about 2 to 3 
percent of infants are born with some abnormality. Most of these abnor-
malities are minor, although some do lead to significant problems for the 
newborn. Some are due to chromosomal problems, and others stem from 
abnormal development of organs and structures. For example, some new-
borns may have heart defects or abnormalities of the kidneys, bladder, or 
gastrointestinal tract. Many of these problems, though not all of them, can be 
diagnosed on a prenatal ultrasound exam (see Chapter 8). When confronted 
with any such problem, the most important first step is to gather all the 
available information about it, so that you know what to expect and what the 
treatment options are. Keep in mind that even specialists may not be able 
to tell you everything to expect until your baby is born and they can further 
evaluate the situation.
Incompetent cervix
During the second trimester, usually between 16 and 24 weeks, some women 
develop a problem known as an incompetent cervix or cervical insufficiency. 
The cervix opens up and dilates, even though the woman feels no contrac-
tions. This condition may lead to miscarriage. Indeed, an incompetent cervix 
is most often diagnosed after the miscarriage occurs and, in most cases, 
couldn’t have been predicted. A woman who develops this condition ordinar-
ily doesn’t notice any symptoms, although sometimes she may report feeling 
pelvic heaviness or pressure that’s out of the ordinary, or she may notice 
some spotting. Most women who experience an incompetent cervix do so for 
no identifiable reason. Others may have one of the following risk factors:

105
 Chapter 6: The Second Trimester
 
✓ Cervical trauma: Some evidence suggests that multiple D&Cs (dilation 
and curettage) or procedures called cervical cone biopsy or LEEP (in 
which a cone-shaped portion of the cervix is removed in the diagnosis 
or treatment of cervical abnormalities) can increase the risk of cervical 
incompetence. A significant tear of the cervix during a prior delivery 
may also increase the risk for cervical incompetence.
 
✓ Multiple gestations: Some obstetricians believe that carrying multiple 
babies, especially triplets or more, may increase the risk for an incompe-
tent cervix. This issue is very controversial; some obstetricians recom-
mend placing a cerclage (a stitch in the uterus — see the explanation 
that follows) in all patients with triplets or more, but others perform the 
procedure only in patients they think are at high risk for incompetent 
cervix. Some patients who have undergone a procedure called multi-fetal 
pregnancy reduction (see Chapter 15) may also be at an increased risk for 
incompetent cervix, although routine cerclage placement isn’t recom-
mended for them at this time.
 
✓ Prior history of incompetent cervix: After you have had an incompe-
tent cervix, your risk of having it again in a subsequent pregnancy is 
increased.
In cases in which an incompetent cervix is diagnosed before the pregnancy 
is lost, attempts can be made to hold the cervix shut with a stitch, called a 
cerclage, around the cervix. The cerclage is usually placed at 12 to 14 weeks, 
although it’s occasionally performed as an emergency procedure later in the 
pregnancy. Doctors most commonly perform the procedure in the hospital 
under spinal or epidural anesthesia, but the woman is usually discharged 
later the same day.
Some women with a cerclage notice they have a heavy discharge throughout 
pregnancy. If you need to have a cerclage, talk to your doctor about how 
active you can be — whether you can have sex and how much exercise is 
advisable. Complications associated with emergency cerclage include infec-
tion, contractions, rupture of membranes, bleeding, and miscarriage. The 
same complications can occur with elective cerclage, but they’re unusual.
Knowing when to seek help
 
The following is a list of second-trimester symptoms that require some atten-
tion. If you experience any of them, call your practitioner:
 
✓ Bleeding
 
✓ An unusual sense of pressure or heaviness

106
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Regular contractions or strong cramping
 
✓ A lack of normal fetal movement
 
✓ High fever
 
✓ Severe abdominal pain
For Dads: Watching Mom Grow
“Honey, do you think I’m fat and ugly now?” You may start to hear this ques-
tion during the second trimester when the mother’s body really begins to 
change. Here’s a tip: It’s not a multiple-choice question. You only have one 
answer, and you may as well commit it to memory so that you can answer 
without hesitation: “Absolutely not, honey. You’re the most beautiful woman 
I’ve ever laid eyes on.”
Tread lightly when making comments about your partner’s belly size. Maybe 
you are just being observant, but it’s a great way to get the cold shoulder 
without intending it!
Enjoy the second trimester. Often, it’s the most fun part of pregnancy for 
both parents. Morning sickness fades away, fatigue subsides, and your part-
ner begins to feel the baby move around inside her. Often, you, too, can feel 
the baby move by placing your hand on the mom’s abdomen.
During this trimester, many mothers get an ultrasound exam to check the 
baby’s anatomy. Try to go along to see the ultrasound exam (see Chapter 21); 
it’s one of the most enjoyable prenatal tests. You get to see the baby’s hands, 
feet, and face, and you get to watch the baby move around. For the first time, 
you see the living, moving, growing little human inside, and suddenly the 
whole enterprise seems so much more real!
By the end of the second trimester, you may begin prenatal classes. Don’t 
make excuses! Go with your partner! The classes are designed for both father 
and mother. During this time, you can find out how to be useful during labor 
and delivery. And you can also ask questions about what to anticipate — to 
relieve some of your own anxiety.

Y
ou’re finally ready for the third act — your pregnancy’s final trimester. 
By now, you’re probably accustomed to having a protruding belly, your 
morning sickness is long gone, and you’ve come to expect and enjoy the 
feeling of your baby moving around and kicking inside you. In this trimester, 
your baby continues to grow, and your practitioner continues to monitor 
your and your baby’s health. You also begin making preparations for the 
new arrival, which may mean anything from getting ready to take a leave of 
absence from your job to taking childbirth classes (or otherwise finding out 
what to expect during labor and delivery).
Your Baby Gets Ready for Birth
At 28 weeks, your baby measures about 14 inches (about 35 cm) and weighs 
about 2 1/2 pounds (about 1,135 grams). But by the end of the third trimester — 
at 40 weeks, your due date — it measures about 20 inches (50 cm) and weighs 
6 to 8 pounds (about 2,700 to 3,600 grams) — sometimes a bit more, some-
times a bit less. The fetus spends most of the third trimester growing, adding 
fat, and continuing to develop various organs, especially the central nervous 
system. The arms and legs get chubbier, and the skin becomes thicker and 
smooth.

108
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
During the third trimester, your baby is less susceptible to infections and to 
the adverse effects of medications, but some of these agents may still affect 
its growth. The last two months are usually spent getting ready for the tran-
sition to life in the world outside the uterus. The changes are less dramatic 
than they were early on, but the maturation and growth that happen now are 
very important.
By 28 to 34 weeks, the fetus generally assumes a head-down position (called 
a vertex presentation), like in Figure 7-1. This way, the buttocks and legs (the 
bulkiest parts of its body) occupy the roomiest part of the uterus — the top 
part. In about 4 percent of singleton pregnancies, the baby may be positioned 
buttocks-down (breech) or lie across the uterus (transverse). (See the sec-
tion “Recognizing Causes for Concern” later in this chapter for more on 
breech presentation.)
By 36 weeks, growth slows, and amniotic fluid volume is at its maximum 
level. After this point, the amount of amniotic fluid may start to decline 
because blood flow to the baby’s kidneys decreases as the placenta ages, and 
the baby produces less urine (and therefore less amniotic fluid). In fact, most 
practitioners routinely check the amniotic fluid volume on ultrasound or by 
feeling your abdomen during the last few weeks to make sure that a normal 
amount remains.

 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
Movin’ and shakin’: Fetal movements
Look down at your belly during times of fetal activity during the third tri-
mester, and it may appear that an alien from outer space is doing an aero-
bic dance inside you. Although fetal movements don’t actually diminish as 
your due date approaches, the timing and quality of the movements change. 
Toward the end of pregnancy, fetal movements may feel less like jabs and 
more like tumbles or rolls, and you notice longer periods of quiet between 
movements. The fetus is adapting to a more newborn-like pattern, taking 
longer naps and having longer active cycles.
 
If you don’t sense a normal amount of activity, let your practitioner know. A 
good general rule is that you should feel about six movements in one hour 
after dinner, while resting. Any movement, no matter how subtle, counts. 
Some women find that they go for periods of feeling less fetal movement, but 
then the movements pick up again and are normal. This is very common and 
isn’t a reason to be concerned. However, if you notice a pattern of diminishing 
fetal movements or you feel absolutely no fetal movements over several hours 
(despite resting or eating), give your practitioner a call right away.
If you have certain risk factors or if you need specific guidelines to track the 
adequacy of fetal movements, your practitioner may suggest that you keep a 
diary to chart fetal movement, starting at 28 weeks. You can track fetal move-
ments in several different ways. One way is to lie down on your left side after 
dinner to count fetal movements, and write down how long it takes to count 
10 movements. Another way of doing the test is to count fetal movements 
while lying down for an hour each day (it doesn’t have to be the same hour 
every day) and to plot the number of movements on a chart given to you by 
your practitioner. With this method, you can see the pattern of the baby’s 
movements throughout the day.
Flexing the breathing muscles
Fetuses undergo what are called rhythmic breathing movements from 10 weeks 
onward, although these movements are much more frequent in the third tri-
mester. The fetus doesn’t actually breathe, but its chest, abdominal wall, and 
diaphragm move in a pattern that is characteristic of breathing. You don’t 
notice these movements, but a doctor can observe them with ultrasound. 
Many doctors believe these movements are signs that the baby is faring well. 
During the third trimester, the amount of time a fetus spends performing the 
breathing movements increases, especially after meals.

110
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Hiccupping in utero
At times, you may feel a quick, rhythmic pattern of fetal movements, occur-
ring every few seconds. These movements are most likely hiccups. Some 
women feel fetal hiccups several times throughout the day; others sense 
them only rarely. Occasionally you may actually see the baby hiccupping 
during an ultrasound exam. These hiccups are completely normal. They may 
feel strange, but standing on your head and drinking water, which we hear is 
a great cure, probably isn’t your best option now.
Keeping Up with Your Changing Body
As the baby grows, so does your belly! Although big is beautiful, it can 
become uncomfortable. You may notice that your uterus pushes up on your 
ribs, and sometimes you notice kicking in one spot in particular — that is 
probably where the baby’s extremities are, either feet or arms. If you’re 
pregnant with twins or more, the discomforts are, of course, even more pro-
nounced. Women with twins may feel one baby move more than the other, 
which is usually related to the babies’ positions — one baby may be oriented 
with the arms and legs facing out and the other with them facing in. Whether 
you have one, two, or more babies inside, you notice that moving around like 
you used to becomes more and more difficult as you get bigger.
 
If you find rising after lying on your back is difficult and no one is around to 
help, try turning on your side first and then pushing yourself up to a sitting 
position (see Figure 7-2).

Being pregnant may make you more cautious about taking obvious risks, but 
it doesn’t prevent you from stumbling or otherwise having an occasional 
mishap. If you do fall, don’t worry. Chances are good that the baby remains 
well protected within your uterus and within its sac of amniotic fluid, which is 
an excellent natural cushion. But just to be careful, let your practitioner know. 
She may want you to come in to check that the baby is fine.
 
If, after your fall, you suffer severe abdominal pain, contractions, bleeding, or 
leakage of amniotic fluid, or if you notice a decrease in fetal movements, call 
your practitioner immediately or go to the hospital where you receive care. If 
the fall or injury involves a direct blow to your uterus (for example, the steer-
ing wheel hits your belly in a car accident), your practitioner will probably 
want to monitor your baby for a while.

Braxton-Hicks contractions
In the late second trimester or beginning of the third trimester, your uterus 
may, from time to time, become momentarily hard or feel as though it’s balling 
up. Most likely, you’re experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions. They’re not the 
kind of contractions you have in labor; they’re more like practice ones.

112
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Braxton-Hicks contractions are usually painless, but at times they may be 
uncomfortable, and they may occur with more frequency when you are 
active and subside when you rest. Women who have already had children 
tend to notice more Braxton-Hicks contractions. You may have a hard time 
distinguishing Braxton-Hicks contractions from fetal movements, especially 
if this is your first pregnancy. Other times, Braxton-Hicks contractions can 
become uncomfortable and progress to false labor.
 
If you’re less than 36 weeks along and you experience contractions that are 
persistent, regular, and increasingly painful, call your doctor to make sure that 
you’re not in premature labor.
Carpal tunnel syndrome
If you feel numbness, tingling, or pain in your fingers and wrist, you’re prob-
ably experiencing carpal tunnel syndrome. It occurs when swelling in the wrist 
puts pressure on the median nerve, which runs through the carpal tunnel 
A pregnant woman knows no strangers
You may find that your belly has suddenly 
become public property. Perfect strangers feel 
compelled to put their hands on your abdomen 
and tell you how pleased they are that you’re 
about to have a baby! Although some women 
find this kind of behavior caring and support-
ive, others find it annoying, embarrassing, 
and uncomfortable. Politely telling people not 
to touch your belly if they’re making the move 
is okay.
Many people consider it perfectly polite also 
to comment on your appearance. They may tell 
you that you look too fat or too thin; that you’re 
carrying too wide or all in your buttocks. They 
may say that this or that is a sign that the baby is 
a boy or a girl. “Whoa, you must be about ready 
to pop!” they may exclaim, or “My goodness, 
you’re enormous!” Try, if you can, not to pay 
attention to what they say. Indeed, the very best 
piece of advice we can offer is that you don’t 
let other people drive you crazy. They may have 
the best of intentions, but they rarely realize 
how their words sound to you.
We tell our patients all the time to talk to us if 
they have concerns. So don’t hesitate to ask 
your doctor or other healthcare provider if what 
you hear worries you. But also remember what 
you know: If someone tells you that you look too 
small, tell her your practitioner measures you 
with each visit to make sure that you’re okay 
growth-wise. Also remember that if you had 
an ultrasound exam recently and the size of 
your fetus was perfectly appropriate, you have 
nothing to worry about. Your practitioner can 
always reassure you that your belly is measur-
ing perfectly normal.
Many women feel compelled to tell you all the 
horror stories of their own pregnancies — or 
all the pregnancy horror stories they’ve ever 
heard. If you pay too much attention, you’ll only 
suffer anxiety and needless worry. Just tell the 
person politely that you really prefer not to hear 
her story (unless, of course, you don’t mind 
these stories).

113
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
from the wrist to the hand. It can happen in one or both hands, and the pain 
may be worse at night or upon awakening. Carpal tunnel syndrome is more 
common in women who are pregnant than in those who aren’t because of the 
swelling that goes along with pregnancy.
If carpal tunnel syndrome becomes persistent or bothersome, discuss it with 
your practitioner. Wrist splints, available at some drug stores or surgical 
supply stores, can relieve the problem. Try not to be discouraged if it doesn’t 
seem to get better during pregnancy, though, because it usually improves 
(often dramatically fast) after delivery.
Fatigue

The fatigue you felt early in your pregnancy may return in the third trimester. 
You may feel as if you’re just slowing down. You’re tired all the time, you’re 
carrying around more weight, you’re not very comfortable much of the time, 
and you may feel that you can’t accomplish everything you need to. Women 
may find their second or third pregnancies more tiring than the first because 
they have to care for one or more older children.
Try to be realistic about what you can do, and don’t feel guilty about what 
you can’t get done. No one wants you to be Superwoman. Take time for your-
self and get as much rest as you can. Delegate tasks. Whenever possible, let 
other people help with household chores and other responsibilities. Do what-
ever you can to take advantage of the quiet times. Rest as much as you can 
now, because after delivery, the work really picks up!
Hemorrhoids
No one wants to talk about them, but hemorrhoids — dilated, swollen veins 
around the rectum — are a common problem for pregnant women. They’re 
essentially varicose veins of the rectum (we talk about varicose veins later in 
this section). The enlarging uterus causes hemorrhoids by pressing on major 
blood vessels, which leads to pooling of blood, and ultimately makes the 
veins enlarge and swell. Progesterone relaxes the veins, allowing the swelling 
to increase. Constipation makes hemorrhoids worse. Straining and pushing 
hard during bowel movements puts added pressure on the blood vessels, 
causing them to enlarge and possibly protrude from the rectum.
 
Hemorrhoids sometimes bleed. This bleeding doesn’t harm the pregnancy, 
but if it becomes frequent, talk to your doctor and possibly see a colorectal 
specialist or general surgeon. If hemorrhoids become very painful, you may 
want to discuss whether treatment is necessary. Meanwhile, you can try the 
following:

114
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Avoid constipation (see Chapter 5). Straining to push out hard stool can 
make hemorrhoids worse.
 
✓ Exercise. Activity increases bowel motility, so the stool doesn’t get 
too hard.
 
✓ Get off your feet when you can. Doing so alleviates extra pressure on 
your veins.
 
✓ Try over-the-counter topical medications, such as Preparation H or 
Anusol, or a steroid cream. Many women find some relief with these 
medications.
 
✓ Take warm baths two to three times a day. Soaking in warm water can 
help relieve the muscle spasms that most often cause the pain.
 
✓ Use over-the-counter hemorrhoidal pads (such as Tucks) or witch 
hazel pads to clean and medicate the area. These pads often provide a 
cooling, soothing relief.
Pushing during the second stage of labor can make hemorrhoids worse or 
make them appear where they weren’t before. But, most of the time, hemor-
rhoids go away after delivery.
Insomnia
During the last few months of pregnancy, many women find sleeping difficult. 
Finding a comfortable position when you’re eight months along isn’t easy. 
You feel a little like a beached whale. Getting up five times a night to go to the 
bathroom doesn’t make things any easier. However, you may find relief in the 
following:
 
✓ Drink warm milk with honey. Warming the milk releases tryptophan, a 
naturally occurring amino acid that makes you sleepy; the honey causes 
you to produce insulin, which also makes you drowsy. Leave the honey 
out, however, if you have gestational diabetes (see Chapter 17).
 
✓ Exercise during the day. Activity helps to tire you out, which means 
you’ll fall asleep sooner.
 
✓ Go to bed a little later than usual. You’ll spend less time trying to fall 
asleep.
 
✓ Limit your liquid intake after 6 p.m. Don’t limit it to the point that you 
become dehydrated, however.
 
✓ Invest in a body pillow. You can tuck it around your body in various 
places, making it easier to find a comfortable position. You can get a 
body pillow in almost any department store.
 
✓ Take a warm, relaxing bath before going to bed. Many women say a 
bath helps make them feel sleepy.

 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
Feeling the baby “drop”
During the month before delivery, a woman may notice that her belly feels 
lower and that suddenly it’s easier to breathe. This feeling is due to the fact 
that the baby has dropped, or descended lower into the pelvis. This move-
ment is also called lightening. It typically happens two to three weeks before 
delivery in women who are having their first child. Those who have had chil-
dren before may not drop until they’re in labor.
When dropping happens, you may find that you’re suddenly much more 
comfortable. Your uterus doesn’t press up on your diaphragm or stomach 
as much as it used to, so breathing is easier, and heartburn may improve. At 
the same time, however, you may feel more pressure in your vaginal area — 
many women feel heaviness there. Some women report feeling strange, sharp 
twinges as the baby’s head moves and exerts pressure on the bladder and 
pelvic floor. Having the baby “drop” doesn’t predict when labor will happen.
You may not notice that you have dropped. During your prenatal visit, your 
doctor may be able to tell by external or internal exam how low the baby’s 
head is and whether it’s engaged. The fetal head is engaged when it has 
reached the level of the ischial spines, which are bony landmarks in your 
pelvis that can be felt during an internal exam (see Figure 7-3).

vis and is

Ischial spines

116
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
When the fetal head is at this level, it’s at zero station. Most practitioners divide 
the pelvis into descending stations from –5 to +5 (although some use –3 to +3). 
Often at the beginning of labor, the head may be at –4 or –5 station (fairly 
high — sometimes called floating, because the fetal head is still floating in the 
amniotic cavity). Labor proceeds until the head descends all the way to +5, 
when delivery is about to begin.
If the baby’s head is engaged prior to labor, you’re more likely to deliver vagi-
nally, although obviously there are no guarantees. Similarly, although a float-
ing (unengaged) head isn’t every obstetrician’s dream, it doesn’t mean that 
you won’t have a completely normal delivery.
 
If you’re having your second child or more, the baby’s head may not engage 
until well into labor.
Pregnancy rashes and itches
Pregnant women are subject to the same rashes that nonpregnant women 
get. One rash is unique to pregnancy, however. It is called Pruritic Urticarial 
Papules of Pregnancy, or PUPP. It sounds scary, but it’s really more of a nui-
sance than anything else because it can cause some intense itching. It occurs 
more often during a first pregnancy and in women having twins or more (the 
more fetuses, the greater the likelihood).
PUPP tends to occur late in pregnancy and is characterized by hives or 
red patches that first appear in the stretch marks on your abdomen. These 
patches can spread to other areas on the abdomen and to the legs, arms, 
chest, and back. They almost never spread to the face. (Thank heaven for 
small favors.) The good news is that the condition poses no risk to the baby. 
But if you develop this rash, your doctor may recommend that you have 
some blood tests to make sure you don’t have other conditions that can be 
associated with itching.
 
The only surefire way to make PUPP go away is to deliver. Some women tell 
us that the itching goes away within hours of giving birth. If delivery is still 
weeks away, it sometimes helps to bathe in a solution of colloidal oatmeal 
(Aveeno makes a good one). Skin lotions containing Benadryl can also help, 
but these products can sometimes dry the skin, which only makes the itch-
ing worse. Some women get relief from taking Benadryl orally, but check with 
your doctor before doing so. Finally, in very severe cases (which are rare), the 
doctor may prescribe a short-term course of steroids or other medications.
Even if you don’t have a rash, you may notice that you itch a lot, especially 
where stretch marks develop. This itching is very common and usually is 
caused by the stretching of your skin as the baby gets bigger.

117
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
Up to 2 percent of pregnant women develop cholestasis of pregnancy, which 
is a condition where an increase of bile acids in the blood causes the itch-
ing. If the itching is mild, you can treat it with skin moisturizers, topical anti-
itching medications, or oral antihistamines such as Benadryl. If the itching is 
severe, your doctor may recommend oral medications that help to clear the 
bile acids from the bloodstream. Some studies have suggested that the baby 
should be monitored with non-stress tests (see Chapter 8) when the mother 
has this condition, because it is associated with an increased risk of compli-
cations. The itching goes away shortly after delivery, but the condition may 
recur in future pregnancies.
Preparing for breastfeeding
 
If you plan on breastfeeding, you may want to take steps to toughen the skin 
around your nipples, which can help prevent them from cracking and becom-
ing sore when you’re breastfeeding. Because cracked nipples can be painful, 
preparing them helps reduce any discomfort you may have. You can try very 
gently rubbing or massaging your nipples between your fingers, exposing 
them to air, rubbing them gently with a wash cloth, or wearing a nursing bra 
with the flaps down so that your nipples rub against your clothes. Creams and 
oils work against toughening, so don’t use them on your nipples.

Some women worry that they don’t have the right type of breasts for breast-
feeding, but no breast type is right or wrong. Breasts both large and small can 
produce adequate milk. Some women with retracted or inverted nipples can 
make breastfeeding easier by massaging their nipples so that they protrude 
more. (See Chapter 14.) Some maternity or baby stores sell special breast 
shells that use suction to help the nipples come out.
Many women notice from early on in pregnancy that their breasts occasion-
ally secrete a yellowish discharge. This discharge is colostrum, and it’s what 
the newborn baby sucks out and swallows in the first few days of life before 
actual milk comes in. Colostrum has a higher protein and lower fat content 
than milk; most importantly, it contains antibodies from your immune system 
that help protect your baby against certain infections until her own immune 
system matures and can take over.

Don’t worry if you don’t produce any visible colostrum during pregnancy; not 
producing colostrum in no way means that you won’t produce adequate milk. 
Each woman is different; some leak from the breasts during pregnancy, and 
some don’t. Even if it isn’t obvious, your baby will still get colostrum the first 
few times she breastfeeds.

118
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Sciatica
Some women experience pain extending from their lower back to their but-
tocks and down one leg or the other. This pain or, less commonly, numb-
ness is known as sciatica, because it’s due to pressure on the sciatic nerve, a 
major nerve that branches from your back, through your pelvis, to your hips, 
and down your legs. You can relieve mild cases of sciatica with bed rest (shift 
from side to side to find the most comfortable position), warm baths, or heat-
ing pads applied to the painful areas. If you develop a severe case, you may 
need prolonged bed rest or special exercises. Ask your doctor.
Shortness of breath
You may find that as pregnancy proceeds, you become increasingly short 
of breath. The hormone progesterone affects your central breathing center 
and may cause these feelings of breathlessness. Furthermore, as your enlarg-
ing uterus presses upward on your diaphragm, your lungs have less room 
to expand normally. (When Joanne was pregnant with her second child, 
she used to be so short of breath that the only books she could read to her 
daughter were ones with very short sentences. Dr. Seuss had to sit on the 
shelf until after she delivered.)
 
In most cases, shortness of breath is perfectly normal. But if it comes on very 
suddenly or if it comes with chest pain, call your doctor.
Stretch marks
Stretch marks are an almost inevitable part of pregnancy, though some 
women do manage to avoid them. Your skin stretches to accommodate the 
enlarging uterus and weight gain, causing the stretch marks. Some women 
probably also have some genetic predisposition for stretch marks. The marks 
typically appear as pinkish-red streaks along the abdomen and breasts, but 
they fade to silvery gray or white several months after delivery. Their exact 
color depends on your skin tone — they appear browner on dark-skinned 
women, for example.
No cream or ointment is completely effective in preventing stretch marks. 
Many people think that rubbing vitamin E oil on the belly helps prevent 
stretch marks or helps them fade faster, but the effectiveness of vitamin E 
has never been proven scientifically. Your best bet is to avoid excessive 
weight gain and to exercise regularly to maintain muscle tone, which eases 
the pressure of the uterus on the overlying skin.

119
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
 
Recently, some dermatologists have started offering a special laser procedure 
that may be helpful in reducing stretch marks after delivery. Also, some advise 
using a cream containing retinoic acid to treat stretch marks after delivery. 
However, don’t use these creams during pregnancy; you shouldn’t use some 
of them when you’re breastfeeding. If your stretch marks are particularly 
noticeable, consult a dermatologist a few months after your pregnancy is over.
Swelling
Swelling (also called edema) of the hands and legs is very common in the 
third trimester. It most often occurs after you’ve been on your feet for a 
while, but it can happen throughout the day. Swelling tends to be even more 
common in warm weather.
Contrary to popular wisdom, no evidence indicates that lowering your salt 
intake or drinking a lot of water prevents swelling or makes it go away.
 
Although swelling is a normal symptom of pregnancy, it can occasionally be a 
sign of preeclampsia (see Chapter 16). If you notice a sudden increase in the 
amount of swelling or a sudden, large weight gain — 5 pounds or more in a 
week — or if the swelling is associated with significant headache or right-sided 
abdominal pain, call your practitioner immediately.
For ordinary swelling, try the following:
 
✓ Keep your legs elevated whenever possible.
 
✓ Stay in a cool environment.
 
✓ Wear supportive pantyhose or stockings that aren’t tight around your 
knees.
 
✓ When in bed, don’t lie flat on your back; try to lie on your side.
Urinary stress incontinence
Leaking a little urine when you cough, laugh, or sneeze isn’t unusual when 
you’re pregnant. This kind of urinary stress incontinence occurs because your 
growing uterus is putting pressure on your bladder. Relaxation of the pelvic 
floor muscles increases the problem during the late second and third trimes-
ters. And sometimes the baby may give the bladder a swift kick and cause it 
to leak urine. Kegel exercises — in which you repeatedly contract the pelvic 
floor muscles as if you’re trying very hard not to urinate — can prevent or 
markedly reduce the problem. (See Chapter 13.) Some women continue to 
experience a little stress incontinence even after delivery, but it usually goes 
away after about 6 to 12 months.

120
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
If you had a particularly difficult labor, where you pushed for a long time, or 
had a very large baby, the stress incontinence may not completely go away. 
Give it at least six months to see whether it goes away. After that, talk to your 
doctor about how to proceed.
Varicose veins
You may notice that a small road map has suddenly appeared on your lower 
legs (and sometimes the vulvar area). These marks are dilated veins, referred 
to as varicose veins. The pressure of the uterus on major blood vessels — the 
inferior vena cava (the vein that returns blood to the heart) and the pelvic 
veins, in particular — causes them. Pregnancy also causes the muscle tissue 
inside your veins to relax and your blood volume to increase, and these con-
ditions add to the problem. Women with light skin or with a family history 
of varicose veins are particularly susceptible. Very often, the bluish-purple 
highways fade after delivery, but sometimes they don’t disappear completely. 
They’re most often painless, but occasionally they may be associated with 
discomfort, achiness, or pain.
In rare instances, a blood clot develops in the superficial veins of the legs. 
This condition, called superficial thrombophlebitis, isn’t a serious problem; 
it’s often successfully treated with rest, leg elevation, warm compresses, and 
special stockings. A clot that forms in the deep veins of the leg is more seri-
ous (see Chapter 17 for a discussion of deep vein thrombosis).
 
You can’t prevent varicose veins — you can’t fight heredity — but you can 
reduce their number and severity by following these tips:
 
✓ Avoid standing for prolonged periods of time.
 
✓ Avoid wearing clothes that are very tight around one part of your leg, 
like socks with tight elastic; which has a tourniquet-like effect.
 
✓ If you must be relatively stationary, move your legs around from time to 
time to stimulate circulation.
 
✓ Keep your legs elevated whenever you can.
 
✓ Wear support stockings or talk to your doctor about a prescription for 
special elastic stockings.
Preparing for Labor
Toward the end of your third trimester, you’re likely to think more about 
delivery and anticipate what that’s going to be like. Many of our patients want 
to know when their labor may start and whether they can do anything to 

121
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
influence the timing or to bring it on sooner. In this section, we help you plan 
your labor, provide some insight on some classes you can take to get ready 
for labor, discuss what you can tell your doctor if you want a Cesarean sec-
tion, and give you some pointers on how to prepare yourself as labor nears.
Making a birth plan
A birth plan is a statement of your preferences for how you want to manage 
your labor and delivery. It’s about educating yourself about your options and 
feelings, rather than making hard and fast — “I absolutely will/won’t” deci-
sions. It involves sorting through things like where you want to deliver, who 
you want to have with you during the process, and how you want to manage 
any pain you may experience. It can be something you simply sort out in 
your mind and convey verbally, or it can be something you put in writing. 
No matter how you develop your plan, make sure you discuss your wishes 
with your provider well in advance of the big day because obstetric practices 
vary widely by provider and hospital. For example, some hospitals have rules 
about fetal heart monitoring during labor. The most important part of a birth 
plan — be it written or verbal — is to provide a platform that fosters an open 
discussion between you and your provider about your preferences wherever 
there is a choice.
If you put your plan in writing, we encourage you not to make it a manifesto 
that attempts to anticipate any and every possibility that can occur with 
labor and delivery. Keeping it short and sweet not only saves paper, but also 
makes it easier for your providers to carry out given the unpredictability of 
the whole process. If your birth plan includes having an on-demand Cesarean 
delivery, check out the section, “Asking for a C-Section on demand” later in 
this chapter.
Going back to school: Classes to take
In order to prepare yourself for labor, you may want to consider taking some 
birthing classes to find out about breathing, relaxation, and massage tech-
niques that help alleviate the fear, anxiety, and pain associated with labor. 
Today, a great majority of first-time expectant parents attend childbirth 
classes. Childbirth education has dramatically changed the average woman’s 
experience of labor and delivery. Today’s birthing experience is a far cry from 
the middle part of the last century, when women were knocked out with anes-
thesia for the delivery and the expectant father’s only job was to pace around 
the waiting room like Ricky Ricardo anticipating the arrival of Little Ricky.
 
As you look toward your labor, you need to have a basic understanding of the 
different types of birthing methods in order to determine which classes may 
be right for you. The following is a primer on different birthing methods:

122
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Lamaze: Developed in the 1940s by Dr. Fernand Lamaze, a French 
obstetrician, this birthing method is probably the best known. Lamaze 
focuses on deep breathing techniques and other exercises aimed at dis-
tracting you from the pain associated with childbirth. For more info, go 
to www.lamaze.org.
 
✓ Bradley: Developed in the 1940s by an American obstetrician named 
Dr. Robert Bradley, this method focuses on a “natural” (drug-free) child-
birth. This method involves training in deep breathing and other tech-
niques to control the pain of labor and uses the dad as a coach. Check 
out www.bradleybirth.com.
 
✓ Leboyer: The cornerstone of this method is to minimize the shock for 
the baby of transitioning from inside the uterus to outside. It involves 
being born in a dimly lit room and immediate bonding with mom.
 
✓ Alexander: This method focuses on intensive conditioning of your body 
to promote balance, flexibility, and coordination, thereby enhancing 
comfort during labor. Find out more at www.alexandertechnique.
com/articles2/pregnancy.
 
✓ HypnoBirthing: This technique was originally described by Dr. Grantly 
Dick-Read, an English obstetrician, in 1944 in a book called Childbirth 
without Fear. (Keith still has the copy of this book his mom used when 
she was preparing for his birth!) The focus of this method is to use hyp-
nosis to break the “fear-tension-pain” cycle, thereby making labor easier.
 
If you decide to take a class, make sure the one you choose provides reliable 
and accurate information. Ask your healthcare provider for recommendations, 
or ask friends who have already attended classes.
Most contemporary childbirth education classes teach a combination of 
some of these techniques. The greatest benefit of childbirth classes is prob-
ably the opportunity they provide to find out what to anticipate during labor, 
because a little information goes a long way in reducing anxiety and fear 
about the big event. Other benefits to the classes include
 
✓ Bringing your partner into the process of pregnancy. If attending your 
prenatal visits isn’t always possible for your partner, a class may be the 
best time for your partner to find out about what’s ahead and to ask 
questions.
 
✓ Meeting other parents-to-be. You may make friends and, ultimately, find 
playmates for your child.
 
✓ Touring the hospital or childbirth center where you plan to deliver. 
Seeing where it’s all going to happen is often very helpful. (If your class 
doesn’t include a tour, ask your practitioner to arrange one.)

123
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
 
You don’t have to believe everything you hear at a childbirth class. If you plan 
to use medication or anesthesia to reduce the pain of labor and the instruc-
tor warns you that all such medications are evil, don’t be bullied into accept-
ing her point of view. You gain no advantage for being a martyr during labor. 
Just find out in class whatever you can that may be helpful and take the rest 
in stride. Ultimately, it’s your labor, and you need to do what makes you feel 
comfortable.
Childbirth education isn’t for everyone. Some women feel that becoming fully 
informed about what’s ahead only adds to their nervousness — and that’s a 
valid concern. Every woman should make her own decision about whether 
to attend childbirth classes. Also, if for some reason you deliver before you 
finish your classes, don’t be overly concerned. Most nurses in labor and 
delivery are trained to show you the techniques you need to know during 
labor.
Asking for a C-Section on demand
Cesarean section on demand (also known as a cesarean delivery on maternal 
request) is having a cesarean delivery just because the mom asks for it, even 
though no medical or obstetrical reasons for a cesarean exist. If you desire to 
have a C-section on demand, make sure you discuss your wishes with your 
doctor well in advance of your delivery. She’ll talk to you in depth about the 
risks and benefits of doing this to help you make an informed decision. If you 
plan on having lots of children, having a C-section on demand probably isn’t 
a good idea because the risks for some problems increase with each subse-
quent cesarean delivery.
Being prepared: Infant CPR
No one wants to think about the possibility of 
finding your newborn unresponsive or having 
difficulty breathing, but the truth is that being 
prepared ahead of time definitely helps pull 
your baby through these scary situations. 
Hence, infant and child CPR are recommended 
to all parents and childcare providers.
Infant CPR is a technique that all parents should 
be familiar with. Many people think it requires 
intensive training to master, but the American 
Heart Association has simplified the training so 
that almost anyone can do it with a minimum of 
effort. In fact, check out the Web site (www.
americanheart.org/presenter.
jhtml?identifier=3045660) for infor-
mation about a valuable 22-minute training ses-
sion for parents.

124
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Over the past ten years or so, having a C-section on demand has become 
increasingly more popular. In fact, statistics show that about 2.5 percent of all 
deliveries in the United States each year are by cesarean section on demand.
The potential benefits of this mode of delivery are a lower risk of post-partum 
hemorrhage (see Chapter 11) and a lower risk of urinary incontinence. The 
latter has been shown to be true in the first year after delivery, but after that 
time, the risk of this problem is equal between moms who deliver vaginally 
and those who have cesarean delivery on demand.
The downsides to cesarean on demand are a longer stay in the hospital, tran-
sient breathing problems for the baby, and higher risks in your subsequent 
pregnancies for problems like uterine rupture (see the information in Chapter 
15 on VBAC) and an adherent placenta (also known as placenta accrete).
Determining Who’s Coming 
to the Hospital
At no time in history have women given birth alone. In fact, the vast major-
ity of cultures have specific childbirth rituals that involve the presence of 
other women attending to a woman’s labor. In recent times, the trend has 
shifted toward involving the baby’s father, family members, close friends, or 
hired labor support. So before the time comes to head to the hospital, take a 
moment and think about who you want to accompany you.
These days, many hospitals allow more than one family member or friend in 
the labor and delivery room to offer continuous labor support. You may want 
to consider having the following people in your room during delivery:
 
✓ The baby’s father or your partner: This is an obvious choice.
 
✓ Your parents: Some women choose to have one or both of their parents 
with them.
 
✓ Your sister: A sister or another close friend may provide the support 
you need.
 
✓ A doula: Some women choose to hire a doula to provide support. A 
doula is a woman with extensive experience with birth, who provides 
emotional and physical support throughout labor. The following are 
some doula referral organizations that you may find helpful:
 
• Doulas of North America (DONA); phone 888-788-DONA; Web site 
www.dona.org
 
• Association of Labor Assistants and Childbirth Educators (ALACE); 
phone 888-222-5223; Web site www.alace.org

125
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
 
Continuous labor support refers to the constant, nonmedical care given to a 
woman in labor. It involves emotional support and encouragement to both the 
patient and her partner, attention to physical comforts (massage, assistance 
with positioning and grooming) and, often, providing information and explana-
tion for various procedures and events. Advantages to continuous labor sup-
port may include a shorter labor, less need for cesarean section, less need for 
pain relief, and a more positive childbirth experience.
Some women with other children may want their children to be present 
during the delivery to share the full family experience. However, if you’re 
considering this, you should consider the maturity of the children (or other 
family members) and whether it would be an emotionally satisfying or 
unnerving situation for them. Although many labors proceed completely 
smoothly without any complications, others may be stressful or more dif-
ficult. Keep this in mind when you are considering who to bring with you to 
the delivery.
Timing labor
“When am I going to have this baby?” We hear this question very frequently 
as the due date approaches. We wish we had a foolproof way of knowing, 
but not even a crystal ball works. Sometimes a woman whose cervix is long 
and closed goes into labor within 12 hours of an internal exam, yet other 
women can walk around for weeks with a cervix dilated to 3 centimeters! 
Some uncertain signs that something may happen include loss of the mucous 
plug (not really a plug but thick mucous produced in the cervix), bloody show 
(an unfortunately named and blood-tinged mucous discharge), increasing 
frequency of Braxton-Hicks contractions, and diarrhea. But nothing is a sure 
sign. Loss of the mucous plug or bloody show may occur hours, days, or 
weeks before labor, or in some cases, not at all. This unpredictability may 
add to your anxiety, but it also makes the whole process more exciting.
Women have tried all kinds of tricks (Chinese food, enemas, sex, and rasp-
berry tea, to name a few) to induce labor on their own, but nothing — short 
of medical induction — really has been proven to work.
 
Vigorously rubbing or massaging the nipples can cause contractions, but it 
shouldn’t be performed at home because it can lead to hyperstimulation of 
the uterus (that is, too-frequent contractions), which isn’t healthy for you or 
your baby. It’s not a sure thing, in any case, because as soon as you stop the 
nipple stimulation, the contractions usually also stop.

126
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Using perineal massage
In the past few years, perineal massage has generated a great deal of inter-
est. This process involves using an oil or cream on the perineum (the area 
between the vagina and the rectum) and massaging the area in preparation 
for childbirth. Although studies suggest that this practice decreases the 
need for episiotomies (cutting the perineum to allow room for the baby to 
pass during childbirth — see Chapter 11) or lacerations, the number of cases 
in which it has made a clear difference isn’t very large. There’s no harm in 
trying it, though. If you think perineal massage may help and it’s comfortable 
for you, go right ahead.
Hitting the Home Stretch: Prenatal 
Visits in the Third Trimester
Between 28 and 36 weeks, your practitioner probably wants to see you every 
two to three weeks, and then weekly as you close in on delivery. She takes 
the usual measurements: blood pressure, weight, fetal heart rate, fundal 
height, and urine tests. These visits are a good time to discuss issues related 
to labor and delivery with your practitioner.
If you don’t deliver by your due date, your practitioner may want to start per-
forming non-stress tests (see Chapter 8 for details). These tests assess fetal 
well-being. After 40 to 41 weeks, placental function and amniotic fluid may 
decline, and ensuring that both remain adequate to support the pregnancy is 
important. By 42 weeks, many practitioners recommend inducing labor (see 
Chapter 10) because the risk of problems for the baby rises significantly after 
that time.
Recognizing Causes for Concern
During the final weeks and months of pregnancy, you see your practitioner 
more often than before. Still, certain questions and problems may arise 
between visits. Everything starts to heat up during the later stages of the 
third trimester, with both the baby and your body preparing for delivery. 
Here are some of the key things that may lead you to call your doctor.

127
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
Bleeding
 
If you experience any significant bleeding, let your practitioner know imme-
diately. Some third-trimester bleeding is harmless to you and your baby, but 
sometimes it can have serious implications. Getting evaluated to be sure 
everything is fine makes sense. Possible causes of third-trimester bleeding 
include
 
✓ Preterm labor: This is defined as having contractions and changes in 
the cervix before you’re 37 weeks along.
 
✓ Inflammation or irritation of the cervix or the harmless bleeding of a 
superficial blood vessel on the cervix: Either of these can occur after 
intercourse or after a pelvic exam.
 
✓ Placenta previa or a low-lying placenta: See Chapter 16.
 
✓ Placental separation or abruption: See Chapter 16.
 
✓ Bloody show: This show is usually less than the amount of blood you 
would see during a normal menstrual period, and it’s often mixed with 
mucous. See Chapter 10.
Breech presentation
A baby is in a so-called breech position when its buttocks or legs are down, 
closest to the cervix. Breech presentation happens in 3 to 4 percent of all 
singleton deliveries. A woman’s risk of having a breech baby decreases the 
further along she goes in her pregnancy. (The incidence is 24 percent at 18 
to 22 weeks but only 8 percent at 28 to 30 weeks. By 34 weeks, it’s down to 
7 percent, and by 38 to 40 weeks, 3 percent.) If your doctor determines your 
baby is in a breech position during your third trimester, she will discuss your 
options, including vaginal breech delivery (which is rarely done these days), 
external cephalic version, or cesarean section. See Chapter 16 for details 
about breech presentation.
Decreased amniotic fluid volume
The medical term for decreased amniotic fluid volume is oligohydramnios. 
(It also used to be called dry birth.) It may be found on a routine ultrasound, 
or your doctor may suspect it just by feeling your uterus. This condition can 

128
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
occur in association with intrauterine growth restriction (see the later section 
“Fetal growth problems”), preterm rupture of the membranes, or other condi-
tions, or the cause may not be identifiable. Usually, a mild decrease in amni-
otic fluid isn’t a major cause for concern; however, your practitioner begins to 
monitor you more closely — with non-stress tests and ultrasound exams — to 
make sure that no problem arises. If you’re very close to your due date, your 
practitioner may want to deliver the baby. On the other hand, if you’re only 
30 weeks along, the best option may be increased rest and close observation. 
Of course, the management of the problem also depends on its cause. See 
Chapter 16 for more details about problems with amniotic fluid.
Decreased fetal movement
 
If you’re not feeling the amount of fetal movement you’re accustomed to, let 
your doctor know. Fetal movement is one of the most important things to pay 
attention to as you near your due date (see the section “Movin’ and shakin’: 
Fetal movements,” earlier in this chapter).
Fetal growth problems
You may find out at a routine prenatal visit that your practitioner thinks 
your uterus is measuring either too big or too small. This finding isn’t a 
cause for immediate alarm. Often in this situation, your practitioner sug-
gests that you have an ultrasound exam to get a better idea of how big the 
baby is. Ultrasound is used to measure parts of the baby — the head’s size, 
the abdomen’s circumference, and the thighbone’s length. Your practitioner 
then plugs these measurements into a mathematical equation that estimates 
the fetal weight (EFW). That estimate is then entered on a curve plotting the 
baby’s age in weeks against weight (see Figure 7-4), which represents the 
average growth of thousands of fetuses at each gestational age.
Your practitioner can check to see where your baby’s weight falls on the 
curve and thus tell which percentile the baby is in. If the baby’s weight is 
anywhere between the 10th and the 90th percentiles, the weight is consid-
ered normal. Remember, not every baby is at the 50th percentile, so the 20th 
percentile is still normal and no reason to worry.
Keep in mind that although ultrasound is an excellent tool for assessing fetal 
growth, it isn’t perfect. Judging the baby’s weight by an ultrasound exam 
isn’t the same as putting the baby on a scale. Weight estimates can vary by 
as much as 10 to 20 percent in the third trimester due to variations in body 
composition. So if your baby is outside the normal range, don’t worry.

If your baby measures very large (macrosomia), your practitioner may sug-
gest you have another glucose screen to check for gestational diabetes (see 
Chapter 16). If your baby measures especially small (intrauterine growth 
restriction), your doctor may suggest you be followed more closely — that 
you undergo non-stress tests and repeat ultrasound exams to keep an eye on 
fetal growth. We go into problems with fetal growth and how to manage them 
in greater detail in Chapter 16.
Leaking amniotic fluid
If you notice your underwear is wet, several explanations are possible. It 
may be a little urine, vaginal discharge, the release of the mucous plug in 
the cervix, or actual leakage of amniotic fluid (also known as rupture of the 
membranes). Often, you can tell what it is by examining the fluid. Mucous 
discharge tends to be thick and globby, whereas vaginal discharge is whitish 
and smooth. Urine has a characteristic odor and doesn’t flow continuously 
without your effort. Amniotic fluid, on the other hand, is normally clear and 
watery and often is lost in spurts. Sometimes you have a big gush of water 
when membranes rupture, but if the membrane has only a small hole, the 
leakage may be scant.
 
If you leak what you think may be amniotic fluid, call your practitioner right 
away or go in to your hospital for evaluation. If you aren’t preterm and the 
amniotic fluid is clear, leaking fluid isn’t an emergency; however, most prac-
titioners want you to let them know so that they can tell you what to do. If 
the fluid is bloody or greenish-brown, be sure to let your practitioner know. 

130
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Greenish fluid may mean the baby has had a bowel movement (meconium) 
inside the uterus. Most of the time, such an event doesn’t indicate a problem, 
but sometimes it means the baby is being stressed. Your practitioner makes 
sure the baby is okay by monitoring the baby’s heartbeat (usually by perform-
ing a non-stress test).
Preeclampsia
Preeclampsia, in which high blood pressure is associated with the spill-
ing of protein into the urine and sometimes swelling (edema) in the hands, 
face, and legs, is a condition unique to pregnancy. Preeclampsia (also called 
toxemia or pregnancy-induced hypertension) isn’t uncommon; it occurs in 6 
to 8 percent of all pregnancies. It can range from being very mild to being a 
serious medical condition. Chapter 16 provides you with the signs and symp-
toms of preeclampsia.
Preeclampsia usually comes on gradually. Your practitioner may at first 
notice only a slight elevation in your blood pressure. She may then tell you 
to rest more, to lie on your side as much as possible, and to come in for more 
frequent visits. But occasionally, preeclampsia happens suddenly.
Preterm labor
The strict technical definition of preterm labor is when a woman begins to 
have contractions and changes in her cervix before she’s 37 weeks along. 
Many women have contractions but no cervical change — in which case it 
isn’t real preterm labor. However, in order to find out whether your cervix is 
changing, you need to be examined. In addition, your practitioner determines 
how often you’re contracting by placing you on a uterine contraction monitor 
(like the one used to perform a non-stress test — see Chapter 8).
The contractions associated with preterm labor are regular, persistent, 
and often uncomfortable. They usually start out feeling like bad menstrual 
cramps. (Braxton-Hicks contractions, in contrast, aren’t regular or persistent, 
and they usually aren’t uncomfortable.) Preterm labor may also be associ-
ated with increased mucous discharge, bleeding, or leakage of amniotic fluid. 
Diagnosing preterm labor as early as possible is important. Medications 
aimed at arresting premature labor work best if the cervix is dilated less 
than 3 centimeters. If labor occurs after 35 weeks, your practitioner probably 
won’t try to stop your contractions except in rare circumstances (such as 
poorly controlled diabetes).

131
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
 
If you find that you’re having regular, uncomfortable, persistent contractions 
(more than five or six in an hour) and you’re not yet 35 to 36 weeks pregnant, 
call your practitioner. The only way to tell whether you’re experiencing real 
preterm labor is to be examined. Also, if you think your membranes have rup-
tured (your water has broken) or if you’re having any bleeding, call your practi-
tioner right away. See Chapter 16 for more detailed coverage on preterm labor.
When the baby is late
For nearly 40 weeks, you think that your baby is going to come on a certain 
date. But in fact, only about 5 percent of women actually deliver on their due 
date. Eighty percent deliver between 37 and 42 weeks, which is considered 
Considering umbilical cord blood collection
Umbilical cord blood is sometimes saved 
because it contains stem cells, the kind of cells 
that can be used to treat a variety of blood dis-
orders, such as some that may develop later in 
the child’s life, like severe anemia. The deci-
sion of whether to donate cord blood is a very 
personal one and is based on many factors. 
The cost involved and your feelings about how 
important this is to your family play a role in the 
decision-making process.
If you do decide to donate, you can utilize either 
of two different types of banks to store cord 
blood:
 ✓ Public banks: Public banks store blood from 
a variety of individuals at no cost to those 
who choose to donate. These banks amass 
thousands upon thousands of cord blood 
specimens, thus maximizing the chances 
of a tissue “match” for anyone who might 
need it. Given that these samples are avail-
able to the public, the children who donate 
them lose control of the cells after they 
donate the cells.
 ✓ Private banks: Private banks, on the other 
hand, charge the donor (or her family) an 
up-front fee to process the cells and a 
yearly fee to store the cells. The cells stay in 
the bank until the donor or a family member 
needs them. Research has shown the likeli-
hood of the donor or a family member actu-
ally needing the cells is about 1 in 2,700.
Not all hospitals have the facilities to collect 
umbilical cord blood for public banks. If you 
decide not to donate or can’t afford to, you 
shouldn’t feel the least bit guilty. Some people 
feel that investing the money that you would 
have spent on cord blood storage can provide 
more of a potential benefit to your child than the 
stem cells. Considering your options well before 
delivery is important. If you opt for a private 
bank, you’ll need to complete the paperwork, 
get the collection kit from the company, and 
take it with you when you go in to deliver. You 
should also inform your provider that you want 
to have the cord blood collected so that she’ll 
be prepared at the time of delivery.

132
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
full-term. Ten percent don’t deliver even by 42 weeks. These pregnancies are 
known as post-date or post-term pregnancies. At one time, these pregnancies 
were often simply a reflection of incorrectly estimated due dates. But today, 
with the widespread use of ultrasound, the due dates are pretty accurate. An 
ultrasound performed during the first trimester is especially accurate, usu-
ally within three to four days. A third trimester ultrasound, in contrast, may 
be off by two to three weeks.
Many practitioners advise that labor be induced if the pregnancy reaches 42 
weeks. If your pregnancy goes on any longer, the baby is likely to still be fine, 
but greater health risks are possible. See Chapter 10 for details.
Getting Ready to Head to the Hospital
You’re so close to delivery now that it’s a good idea to make sure you’re 
ready to walk out the door and head for the hospital. You probably won’t 
want to stop to pack a suitcase at the last minute, nor will you have time to 
stop off at the store to shop for a car seat. Getting these must-do items off 
your pre-delivery checklist now will free you up to concentrate on the impor-
tant things, like that 437th daily trip to the bathroom.
Packing your suitcase
Many women find it comforting to know that their bag is packed for the trip 
to the hospital or birthing center. Having your bag ready allows you to con-
centrate on watching for signs of labor and helps keep you from worrying 
about being prepared.
 
You may want to have a few things on hand while you’re in labor, including 
the following:
 
✓ A camera. Don’t forget to charge the batteries and get extra memory 
cards.
 
✓ A wireless phone or calling card. Bring along your address book with 
home, work, and cell numbers.
 
✓ Insurance information. Don’t forget your card.
 
✓ Socks. Your feet will probably get cold, so plan ahead.

133
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
 
✓ Glasses. They may be less trouble than contact lenses during labor.
 
✓ A snack for your partner or coach. You don’t want your partner to 
leave you for a trip to the hospital cafeteria.
 
✓ Hard candies or lollipops. You may have to go for some time without 
eating or drinking.
 
✓ Something your partner can use to massage your back during labor. 
Some people find that a tennis ball, a narrow paint roller, or a light-
weight rolling pin works well.
 
✓ A CD or MP3 player, if you find music relaxing. Don’t forget to bring 
your favorite CDs.
 
✓ Change for parking meters, telephones, or vending machines. You 
never know when someone may need some quarters (hopefully not your 
practitioner).
 
After delivery, some additional items can help make your life easier, more 
comfortable, or more fun:
 
✓ A post-delivery snack for yourself
 
✓ Champagne for a post-delivery toast, if you like
 
✓ Modern, stick-on sanitary napkins
 
✓ Sturdy cotton underwear that you won’t mind staining
 
✓ A bathrobe and nightgown
 
✓ Toiletries
 
✓ Extra-large shoes that will accommodate your swollen feet
 
✓ Loose, comfortable clothes to go home in
 
✓ Clothes for your baby — or babies! — to go home in
 
✓ An infant car seat
Choosing — and using — a car seat
Buying a car seat for your baby is one of the most important, but confusing, 
purchases you’ll make. You have many choices, so staying informed about 
what to look for is important. Basically, you can choose from two types avail-
able for newborns:

134
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Infant-only seat: Designed for babies who are under one year of age or 
weigh less than 20 pounds, this car seat is smaller and more lightweight 
than the alternative and should be used only in a rear-facing position. 
(A seat that faces the rear is essential for newborns, because it supports 
the child’s back, neck, and head during a car accident.) This type of seat 
is also more convenient because it’s lightweight and can also be used as 
an infant carrier, feeding chair, or rocker.
 
✓ Convertible or infant-toddler seat: Car seats of this type are usually 
larger than infant-only car seats. You use them in a rear-facing position 
until your baby reaches 1 year of age or about 20 pounds. (Check your 
state’s car seat laws to make sure you are up-to-date.) Some models 
have weight limits as high as 30 to 32 pounds for rear-facing use. The 
advantage of this type of seat is that you make only one purchase 
instead of buying both an infant seat and then a convertible seat after 
about the age of 1.
What should you look for when shopping? Try to find a model that is simple to 
use. Also, pay attention to price, because the higher-priced seats aren’t neces-
sarily better. If you choose a convertible seat, try it out in your car to make 
sure if fits both backward and forward before you throw away the receipt. 
Also, check out whether the car seat is easy to install — you shouldn’t need to 
be a mechanical engineer to properly install your baby’s seat correctly. The 
following considerations are important for choosing a car seat:
 
✓ A five-point safety harness with straps that adjust from the front
 
✓ Plenty of head and neck support
 
✓ An easy-to-clean seat
After you’ve made your selection, you may want to practice buckling the 
seat into your car before taking your baby out for her first ride. Remember 
that your baby should ride in a semi-reclined position (at about a 45-degree 
angle), with the straps snugly against her body.
 
If you want to cover your baby, buckle the harness first, and then put a blan-
ket over her — a blanket under the harness, or even a bulky clothing garment 
like a snowsuit, may make the harness too loose.
If your baby is a preemie, ask your doctor if the baby needs to be tested in 
her car seat before discharge. Premature babies are at a greater risk for peri-
ods of apnea (absent breathing) or depressed heart rate in a car seat. You 
may need to use rolled up towels or diapers on each side of the baby’s head 
to help keep her head and neck from slumping.

135
 Chapter 7: The Third Trimester
For Dads — Getting Down to the Wire
Your partner may begin to feel uncomfortable because of all the changes in 
her body — and because of her sheer size. Many women have trouble sleep-
ing late in pregnancy, which only makes it harder for them to tolerate their 
discomfort. As you did during the first trimester, take on more of the day-
to-day household duties and give your partner the time she needs to rest. 
Consider treating her to a day at her favorite salon, or send her out for some-
thing else that makes her feel special. She deserves to feel good about herself 
and the changes her body is going through. And things will go easier for both 
of you if you can find a way to help her accept her pregnant body, relax, and 
take things a little easier.
Later in the third trimester, naturally, both of you start to focus on labor and 
delivery. You may have a million questions: Will the baby be okay? Do I really 
want to be in the delivery room? How will my partner tolerate labor? How 
will I tolerate labor? Will I get queasy during the delivery? Psychologically, 
childbirth can be a real challenge for the father. You care about the course of 
events very much, but you’re clearly not in the driver’s seat, and this situa-
tion may make you feel anxious.
At the same time, imminent fatherhood faces you head-on. And the onset of 
this new responsibility may cause still more anxiety and more questions: Will 
I be able to provide for my family? Will I be a good father? Can I figure out 
how to change a diaper? How will I know how to handle a fragile newborn? 
These questions are all normal. Again, they’re probably very similar to the 
questions running through your partner’s head. Communication is every-
thing. Most couples find they can talk each other through their respective 
panic attacks.

Understanding Prenatal Testing
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at first-trimester tests for genetic screening
▶ Checking out tests you may encounter in the second trimester
▶ Reaching the home stretch: Third-trimester testing
“P
assing” your home pregnancy test is just the tip of the iceberg. The 
next nine months are filled with all sorts of tests designed to make 
sure that both you and your baby are healthy. Your practitioner may rec-
ommend most of these tests for all pregnant women, but some of them are 
optional, and the need to consider them is based on certain risk factors. Just 
as you may be nervous before you take an exam in school, you may find your-
self nervous before taking a prenatal test. Rest assured that you will most 
likely pass with flying colors.
Considering Tests for Prenatal Diagnosis 
in the First Trimester
Depending on your age, your medical and obstetrical history, your family his-
tory, and other factors, you may want to undergo one or more tests designed 
to detect certain genetic diseases or conditions. A number of such tests are 
available, including chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis, and fetal 
blood sampling. CVS and early amniocentesis are the only ones that can be 
done during the first trimester.
 
These prenatal tests involve testing the developing baby’s chromosomes. 
Chromosomes carry the genetic information that determines the actual traits 
of an individual, such as physical appearance, intelligence, and personality. 
People normally have 46 chromosomes — 23 inherited from their mother and 
23 from their father (see Figure 8-1). The 23 from each side are paired inside 
the nucleus of each human cell. Twenty-two of these pairs are what are known 
as autosomes, which are the chromosomes that aren’t sex-related. The 23rd 
pair of chromosomes consists of the sex chromosomes, which can be either 
XX (girl) or XY (boy).

Certain abnormalities in chromosome number or structure can lead to prob-
lems in the baby. For example, Down syndrome, one of the more common 
chromosomal abnormalities associated with severe mental retardation, may 
occur if the fetus has an extra copy of chromosome 21. Amniocentesis, CVS, 
and other tests detect such abnormalities in chromosome number and struc-
ture by yielding an enlarged picture of the individual chromosomes called a 
karyotype (see Figure 8-1).
Seeing what determines your baby’s gender
A woman has two X chromosomes, so she can 
only give an X chromosome to her offspring. A 
man has one X and one Y chromosome and can 
therefore give either to his offspring. As you can 
see, the man determines the baby’s sex, so you 
know who is to blame if you don’t get the little 
girl or little boy you were hoping for!

139
 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
If a couple has a known risk for carrying a child with a genetic disease that 
runs in that couple’s family or ethnic group (Tay-Sachs or cystic fibrosis, for 
example), their practitioner also can use the material obtained during these 
procedures to test for such diseases. However, unless a couple is specifically 
at risk for one of these rare genetic disorders, the practitioner won’t rou-
tinely administer this testing; the chromosomes are checked only for number 
and structure.
 
Even among women at risk for a chromosomal problem, some choose not to 
be tested, either because they don’t want to run any risk of miscarriage asso-
ciated with the test or because of their personal beliefs about terminating a 
pregnancy. However, even if pregnancy termination isn’t something you would 
consider, prior knowledge of a fetus’s abnormalities can give you time to make 
preparations for a child who may have special needs. If you’re interested in 
undergoing testing for chromosomal problems, this section takes a closer look 
at the two types available during the first trimester.
Recent research changes whom should 
get first-trimester testing
Traditionally, women who were age 35 or older 
were offered the chance to undergo a prena-
tal diagnostic test to check the fetal chromo-
somes. Thirty-five was chosen as the target 
age because a woman’s risk of having a baby 
with a chromosomal abnormality increases sig-
nificantly after she reaches that age. Also, the 
risk of an abnormality at that age was roughly 
equal to what was formerly felt to be the risk 
of miscarriage after amniocentesis (about 1 in 
200) over the normal risk of miscarriage. More 
recent studies have shown, however, that the 
increased risk of miscarriage after an amnio-
centesis (and probably CVS) are less than what 
was previously estimated and may be even less 
than 1 in 1,000 (over the normal risk of miscar-
riage), making the age of 35 arbitrary.
In fact, the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists recently recommended that 
a maternal age of 35 be abandoned as a cut-off 
to determine who is offered screening versus 
who is offered diagnostic testing (CVS or amnio-
centesis). They advise that all women, regard-
less of their age, have the option of a screening 
test, a diagnostic test, or both. You may want 
to check with your insurance company about 
whether such tests are covered, because the 
fact that a test is offered — or even recom-
mended — doesn’t necessarily mean your 
insurance will cover it. The difference between 
a screening test and an invasive test for prena-
tal diagnosis is that no risks of pregnancy loss 
are associated with a screening test because 
it’s simply a blood test or ultrasound exam 
performed on the mother. But a screening test 
doesn’t diagnose a chromosomal problem 100 
percent of the time, whereas an invasive test of 
prenatal diagnosis does.

140
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Chorionic villus sampling
Chorionic villi are tiny, bud-like pieces of tissue that make up the placenta. 
Because they develop from cells arising out of the fertilized egg, they have 
the same chromosomes and genetic makeup as the developing fetus. By 
checking a sample of chorionic villi, your doctor can see whether the chro-
mosomes are normal in number and structure, determine the fetal sex, and 
test for some specific diseases (if the fetus is at risk for these diseases).
Your doctor performs a chorionic villus sampling (CVS), by withdrawing 
placental tissue (containing chorionic villi) either through a hollow needle 
inserted through the abdomen (transabdominal CVS) or through a flexible 
catheter inserted through the cervix (transcervical CVS, see Figure 8-2), 
depending on where the placenta is located within the uterus and the uter-
us’s general shape and position. Your doctor uses ultrasound equipment as 
a guide as he performs the procedure. He then examines the tissue under a 
microscope, and the cells are cultured in a laboratory.

vical CVS,

ible catheter

the cervix to

tissue, using 
ultrasound 
as a guide.
 
CVS raises the risk of miscarriage slightly — probably in the same range 
as amniocentesis — about 1 in 1,000 (over the normal risk of miscarriage). 
Neither CVS method is riskier than the other. The person performing the test 
should have plenty of experience doing the procedure, because experience 
helps reduce the risk of miscarriage.
CVS results are typically available in seven to ten days, although some labs 
offer a rapid preliminary result (usually at an additional cost). The main 
advantage that CVS has over amniocentesis is that it can provide information 
earlier in the pregnancy. This time factor may be important to some women 
who feel that termination is an option if severe abnormalities are present.

141
 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
Choosing a Down syndrome screening 
test in the first trimester
CVS and early amniocentesis are the only 
tests that can give definitive information about 
fetal chromosomes during the first trimester. 
But researchers have developed noninvasive, 
risk-free screening tests that can help deter-
mine whether a fetus is at increased risk for 
certain problems, primarily Down syndrome. 
Using a combination of a special ultrasound 
measurement, called nuchal translucency, 
and certain blood tests, researchers believe 
that 80 to 90 percent of affected fetuses may 
be detected through screening. These first-
trimester screening tests are usually performed 
between the approximate gestational ages of 10 
weeks, 4 days and 13 weeks, 6 days. Here’s how 
they work:
 ✓ Nuchal translucency: This test uses ultra-
sound to measure a special area behind the 
fetal neck. Only physicians specially trained 
in the procedure should conduct a nuchal 
translucency test. When measurements 
of nuchal translucency are combined with 
blood screening tests, the accuracy of 
these tests is increased. See Chapter 21 for 
an image of this measurement.
 ✓ Serum screening: Tests that check the 
levels of PAPP-A, a substance produced 
by the placenta, and hCG, a hormone in the 
mother’s blood, may help screen for Down 
syndrome in the first trimester. Usually this 
blood test is drawn on or around the same 
day that the ultrasound is performed to 
measure the nuchal translucency.
There are several different ways that you can 
get the results of these tests. Your doctor may 
have a preference for one over another, but 
here are some terms that may come up during 
the discussion:
 ✓ Combined test: With this test, the lab uses 
a combination of the nuchal translucency 
measurement and the blood work (PAPP-A 
and hCG) in the first trimester. You get a 
result a few days after the test. The advan-
tage of this test is that if the results indicate 
an increased risk for abnormalities, you 
have the option of a CVS (see the section 
“Chorionic villus sampling”).
 ✓ Integrated test: If you choose this option, 
you do everything mentioned in the com-
bined test but you don’t get results right 
away. You come back for more blood work 
(see the section “The double, triple, and now 
quadruple screen for Down syndrome”) at 
around 16 weeks. The lab integrates the 
information from the first trimester tests 
with the quadruple screen to give you a 
risk estimate for Down syndrome. The 
advantage of this test is that it has a slightly 
higher detection rate for Down syndrome 
and a lower false positive rate.
 ✓ Modified sequential test: If you choose 
this approach, you do the combined test 
and get your initial results a few days later. 
Depending on those results, you can decide 
whether you want to do a CVS right away 
or wait for the second-trimester quadruple 
screen. If you opt to wait, you have the qua-
druple screen drawn around 16 weeks. At 
that time, you get a second result, which 
also takes into account the information from 
the combined screen. If your results indi-
cate an increased risk for Down syndrome, 
you can have an amniocentesis. The advan-
tage with this approach is that you have the 
option of a CVS early if your results indicate 
an increased risk for Down syndrome. The 
disadvantage is that the false positive rate 
is slightly higher with this approach.

Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Unlike amniocentesis, CVS can’t measure AFP (alpha-fetoprotein; see the sec-
tion “Testing in the Second Trimester” for more). However, your practitioner 
can take this measurement from maternal blood drawn at 15 to 18 weeks into 
the pregnancy.
 
If you undergo CVS and are Rh-negative (A-negative, B-negative, AB-negative or 
O-negative), you should receive an injection of Rh immune globulin following 
the procedure to prevent you from developing Rh disease (see Chapter 16).
Early amniocentesis
For amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a thin, hollow needle through your 
abdomen and into the amniotic sac to withdraw some amniotic fluid. Cells 
taken from the fluid are cultured, and information about genetic diseases and 
chromosome abnormalities is obtained. A traditional amniocentesis is per-
formed at 15 to 20 weeks, but an early one can be done at 11 to 14 weeks.
The advantage of doing the test early is simply that the results come sooner. 
The disadvantage is that the rate of miscarriage is greater than with either rou-
tine amniocentesis or CVS. Studies from Canada and Great Britain indicate a 
higher incidence of club feet in babies whose mothers have early amniocente-
sis. For these reasons, we believe that CVS is the better option during the first 
trimester, and that there is little reason to ever have an early amniocentesis.
Testing in the Second Trimester
As your baby grows and changes, so does the range and scope of possible 
prenatal tests. In the second trimester, you will likely undergo a blood test 
or two, and an ultrasound for a general scan of your baby’s anatomy, growth, 
and well-being. At this point you can also find out the sex of your baby. 
Amniocentesis may also be performed in the second trimester. This section 
outlines the different tests you may undergo.
Second-trimester blood tests
The following blood tests usually yield normal results, but if yours are at all 
unusual, you may need further testing — an ultrasound examination, per-
haps. But keep in mind that further testing doesn’t necessarily mean that 
anything is wrong — only that your practitioner is being careful to ensure 
that everything is okay.

 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
Alpha-fetoprotein screen
MSAFP stands for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, a protein made by the 
fetus that also circulates in the mother’s bloodstream. Doctors use a simple 
blood test to check the level of MSAFP, usually sometime between 15 and 18 
weeks. The test result is affected by weight, race, and preexisting diabetes, 
so it has to be adjusted for those factors. An elevated MSAFP is expressed as 
more than 2.0 or 2.5 multiples of the median, or MOMs, for women carrying 
only one baby and more than 4.0 or 4.5 MOMs for mothers of twins. In triplets 
and quadruplets, the measurement hasn’t been well studied.
Abnormal MSAFP can usually indicate whether a pregnancy is at risk for cer-
tain complications and may indicate
 
✓ Underestimation of the fetus’s age (how far along you are)
 
✓ The presence of twins or more
 
✓ Bleeding that may have occurred earlier in the pregnancy
 
✓ Neural tube defects (spina bifida, anencephaly, and others — see the 
sidebar “Understanding neural tube defects”)
 
✓ Abdominal wall defects (protrusion of the fetus’s abdominal contents 
through a defect in the abdominal wall)
 
✓ Rh disease (see Chapter 16) or other conditions associated with fetal 
edema (abnormal fluid collection in the fetus)
 
✓ Increased risk for low birth weight, preeclampsia, or other complica-
tions (see Chapter 16)
 
✓ A rare fetal kidney condition known as congenital nephrosis
 
✓ Fetal death
 
✓ Other fetal abnormalities

Remember that the MSAFP test is only a screening test. Most women with 
an elevated MSAFP have a normal fetus and continue to have a completely 
normal pregnancy. Only about 5 percent of women with a positive maternal 
serum screen actually have a fetus with a neural tube defect. On the other 
hand, the test isn’t perfect, and therefore it can’t identify all abnormal fetuses. 
To reduce the risk of getting a false positive result (that is, an abnormal test 
result but a normal fetus), a positive test should be repeated (especially if it’s 
only mildly elevated or under 3.0 MOMs), and an ultrasound should be per-
formed to confirm the fetus’s age. If a test comes back elevated a second time 
or if it’s greater than 3.0 MOMs on the first screen, a detailed ultrasound exam 
should be done to look for any detectable abnormalities.

144
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
If you have two elevated MSAFP tests, a very high single test, or a ques-
tionable ultrasound for spine and head defects, you may want to have an 
amniocentesis to check the level of AFP in the amniotic fluid (see the section 
“Testing with amniocentesis” later in this chapter). Your practitioner can also 
check the amniotic fluid for a substance called acetylcholinesterase, which is 
present if the fetus has an open neural tube defect (see the “Understanding 
neural tube defects” sidebar). In most cases, the amniotic fluid AFP is nega-
tive and the pregnancy continues normally. Some studies suggest, however, 
that women who have an abnormal MSAFP and then a normal amniotic fluid 
AFP may be at risk for preterm delivery, low birth-weight babies, or hyperten-
sion. If you fit the pattern, your doctor may suggest that you and your baby 
be closely observed, either with ultrasound or with other tests of fetal well-
being, such as non-stress tests (see the section, “Assessing your baby’s cur-
rent health” later in this chapter). Specific protocols for fetal monitoring vary 
from doctor to doctor.
Understanding neural tube defects
The baby’s central nervous system begins as 
a flat sheet of cells that rolls up into a tube as 
it matures. The front of the tube, which closes 
at about day 23 of life, becomes the brain. The 
other end of the tube, which closes at about day 
28 of life, becomes the lower end of the spinal 
cord. If either end fails to close for some reason 
(nobody knows why it sometimes doesn’t), a 
neural tube defect occurs. The most common 
neural tube defects are spina bifida (an open-
ing in the spine), anencephaly (absence of the 
skull), and encephalocele (an opening in the 
skull). These defects cause abnormalities in the 
nervous system such as paralysis, extra fluid in 
the brain, or mental retardation. Fetuses with 
anencephaly usually don’t survive more than a 
few days after birth.
This all sounds pretty scary, but fortunately, 
these defects are rare. We discuss these 
defects because screening programs are avail-
able in most countries to help identify those 
fetuses that may have one of these defects, 
and because you can follow recommendations 
to reduce the likelihood of having a baby with a 
neural tube defect — by taking folic acid before 
you conceive (see Chapter 1), for example, and 
by getting your blood sugar under control if you 
have diabetes.
In the United States, a neural tube defect 
occurs about once in every 1,000 babies born. 
The incidence in the United Kingdom is higher: 
4 to 8 cases in every 1,000 babies. In Japan, 
the incidence is quite low, at about 1 case per 
2,000 babies. No one knows exactly why the 
incidence varies among countries, but it has 
something to do with the interaction between 
the environment and one’s genetic makeup. If 
you or your baby’s father has a family history of 
neural tube defects, let your practitioner know 
at your first visit, because that slightly raises 
your risk of having a baby with a neural tube 
defect, and you can discuss your options for 
prenatal diagnosis (ultrasound or amniocen-
tesis). Also, if you had a previous pregnancy 
in which a neural tube defect was diagnosed 
or if you have a family history of this condition, 
increase the amount of folic acid you take at the 
beginning of pregnancy to 4 mg per day. The 
earlier the better.

145
 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
The double, triple, and now quadruple screen for Down syndrome
Another test that can be performed with the same sample of blood that’s 
used for the MSAFP during the second trimester is a screening test for Down 
syndrome — the most common chromosomal abnormality in babies. This 
test can also help to identify women at risk of having babies with other chro-
mosomal abnormalities, like Trisomy 18 or Trisomy 13 (an extra copy of either 
the number 18 or 13 chromosome). These particular chromosomal abnormal-
ities are associated with severe birth defects, and are often not compatible 
with life.
Your practitioner performs this test by measuring two, three, or four sub-
stances in the blood:
 
✓ MSAFP
 
✓ hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin)
 
✓ Estriol (a form of estrogen)
 
✓ Inhibin A (a substance secreted by the placenta)
Your practitioner uses the results of these tests to calculate risk for Down 
syndrome. In women under the age of 35, the triple test (the first three sub-
stances) detects Down syndrome in about 60 percent of the cases where it’s 
present. (In other words, if 100 women carrying fetuses with Down syndrome 
had the test, the condition would be diagnosed in about 60 of them.) Using 
the quadruple screen, the detection rate may be as high as 75 to 80 percent. 
This test is only a screening, so even if the result is abnormal, the fetus is 
normal in the majority of cases. If your test is abnormal, your practitioner 
will discuss with you the possibility of having an amniocentesis to check the 
baby’s chromosomes. The quadruple screen is often combined with the first 
trimester tests described earlier to improve the detection of Down syndrome.
 
Unlike the screen for neural tube defects, which yields a high MSAFP and is 
often repeated when abnormal, the screens for Down syndrome should not be 
repeated, because doing so will only provide a less accurate result.
Glucose screen
The glucose screen is a test to identify women who may have gestational dia-
betes. Your practitioner conducts the test by first having you drink a super-
sweet-tasting glucose mixture (it tastes like flat soda) and then, exactly one 
hour later, drawing a sample of blood. He checks this sample for the level of 
glucose (sugar). High levels indicate that you’re at risk for gestational diabe-
tes. We discuss why treating gestational diabetes is important in Chapter 17.

146
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
The one-hour screening test is usually performed between 24 and 28 weeks, 
though some doctors do it twice — once early in the pregnancy and again at 
24 to 28 weeks. About 25 percent of obstetricians test only those women who 
are at risk for gestational diabetes. The risk factors, which follow, are broad, 
and about 50 percent of all pregnant women have one of them:
 
✓ Maternal age greater than 25 years
 
✓ Previous birth of a large infant
 
✓ Previous unexplained fetal death
 
✓ Previous pregnancy with gestational diabetes
 
✓ Strong family history of diabetes
 
✓ Obesity
If your initial glucose screening test is abnormal, you don’t necessarily have 
gestational diabetes. (Remember, it’s only a screening test.) Only about 5 
percent of pregnant women actually develop gestational diabetes (although 
15 percent may screen positive). Your practitioner will recommend another 
test, a three-hour test that tells whether gestational diabetes is really pres-
ent. The three-hour test involves drawing blood after you fast overnight, 
having you drink a different glucose mixture, and then drawing blood three 
more times, at one, two, and three hours later. Some practitioners recom-
mend eating an extra helping of pasta or rice for the three days before the 
test (called carbohydrate loading) in order to get your body ready for the test.
A test is considered positive — or abnormal — if two (or more) of the four 
blood levels are in the abnormal range. If you test positive for gestational 
diabetes, your doctor will put you on a special diet and check your glucose 
levels throughout the remainder of your pregnancy. If you have elevated glu-
cose levels despite adhering to this special diet, you may need to be on insu-
lin or an oral medication to keep your sugars well controlled. (See Chapter 17 
for more on this topic.)
Complete blood count (CBC)
Many obstetricians check a complete blood count at the same time that they 
do your glucose test in order to see whether you’ve developed significant 
anemia (iron deficiency) or a variety of other less-common problems. Anemia 
is common during pregnancy, and some women need to take extra iron. A 
CBC also gives your physician a platelet count, which is a blood factor that 
helps with clotting.

147
 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
“Looking” at sound waves: Ultrasound
An ultrasound (also referred to as a sonogram) exam is an incredibly useful 
tool that allows you and your doctor to see the baby inside your uterus. A 
device called a transducer emits sound waves. The sound waves are reflected 
off the fetus and converted into an image that appears on a monitor. (See 
sonogram photos in Chapter 21.) You can see almost all the structures in the 
fetus’s body, and you can see the fetus moving around and performing all 
its normal activities — kicking, waving, and so on. The best time to view the 
baby’s anatomy is around 18 to 22 weeks.
An ultrasound exam doesn’t hurt. Your practitioner spreads gel or lotion 
over your abdomen, and then moves the transducer around through the gel 
(see Figure 8-3). A full bladder isn’t necessary because the amniotic fluid sur-
rounding the fetus provides the liquid needed to transmit the sound waves to 
create a clear or detailed picture. Picture quality varies, depending on mater-
nal fat, scar tissue, and the fetus’s position.
A doctor (an obstetrician, a perinatologist, or a radiologist) or an ultrasound 
technologist may perform the ultrasound. Sometimes a technologist does 
a preliminary exam, and the doctor comes in later to check on images or 
review the printed pictures.

What an ultrasound can reveal
Ultrasound is like a checkup for the fetus. It can provide information about 
the following:
 
✓ Number of babies
 
✓ Gestational age
 
✓ Rate of fetal growth
 
✓ Fetal position, movement, and breathing exercises (the fetus moves its 
chest and abdomen as if it were breathing air)
 
✓ Fetal heart rate
 
✓ Amount of amniotic fluid
 
✓ Location of placenta
 
✓ General fetal anatomy, including the identification of some birth defects
 
✓ The baby’s sex (after 15 to 16 weeks), although you can’t always see it
Typically, the examiner measures the fetus first and then studies its anatomy. 
The extent and degree of detail of the exam varies from woman to woman 
and doctor to doctor. A detailed ultrasound can examine these structures:
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “Is ultrasound safe?”
A: The technology has been in widespread use 
for more than 40 years, and overwhelmingly 
most studies show no harmful consequences 
for the baby or mom. In addition, the informa-
tion provided by an ultrasound examination has 
been shown to have many health benefits. For 
example, certain conditions (such as bladder 
outlet obstruction) may be treated during the 
pregnancy, and diagnosis of others (such as a 
congenital heart defect) allow for careful plan-
ning for delivery. Detection of problems with 
fetal growth or amniotic fluid volume let your 
doctor know that close surveillance of the preg-
nancy may be indicated.

✓ Bladder
 
✓ Brain and skull

✓ Genitalia
 
✓ Heart, chest cavity, 
and diaphragm
 
✓ Kidneys
 
✓ Spine
 
✓ Stomach, abdominal 
cavity, and 
abdominal wall

 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
Reasons for having an ultrasound
Whether and how often you need an ultrasound depends on your particular 
risk factors, your doctor’s preferences, and your insurance coverage. Some 
doctors recommend that all women have an ultrasound exam at about 20 
weeks; others feel that it’s unnecessary if your risks for having problems are 
low. Multiple ultrasound examinations may be needed if any of the following 
conditions arise:
 
✓ If you’re carrying twins or more
 
✓ If your doctor suspects that the baby is too small or too large for its age
 
✓ If your doctor suspects that you have too little or too much amniotic 
fluid
 
✓ If you’re at risk for preterm labor or incompetent cervix (see Chapter 16)
 
✓ If you have diabetes, hypertension, or other underlying medical condi-
tions (see Chapter 17)
 
✓ If you’re bleeding
 
✓ If your doctor wants to do a biophysical profile, which is an assessment 
of fetal well-being that looks at movement, breathing exercises, amniotic 
fluid volume, and fetal tone (ability to flex the muscles)
Recently, doctors have also used ultrasound to get an accurate measurement 
of the cervix (the uterus’s opening) in women at risk for preterm delivery or 
incompetent cervix. Your practitioner places a transducer in the vagina to 
measure the cervix’s length and check the appearance of the lower part of 
the uterus.
Testing with amniocentesis
Amniocentesis is a test that is performed by inserting a thin, hollow needle 
into the amniotic fluid and then withdrawing some of the fluid through the 
needle into a syringe (see Figure 8-4). The amniotic fluid can then be tested 
in a variety of ways. If your practitioner performs a genetic amniocentesis — a 
check of fetal chromosomes — he usually conducts it at 15 to 20 weeks. Your 
practitioner may perform amniocentesis for other reasons, like checking for 
lung maturity in the baby, at any time later in the pregnancy.
During the amniocentesis procedure, you lie flat on your back on top of a 
table. Your doctor cleans your abdomen with an iodine solution. Using ultra-
sound to locate an area of amniotic fluid that is away from the baby, your 
doctor inserts a thin needle through your abdomen and uterus into the amni-
otic sac. After withdrawing enough amniotic fluid (usually about 15 to 20 cc, 
or 1 to 2 tablespoons), he removes the needle.

150
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
Figure 8-4: 
An amnio-
centesis 
procedure.
 
A common misconception is that the needle is inserted through the navel. 
The exact point of insertion depends on where the fetus, the placenta, and 
the amniotic sac are located within the uterus. You may have heard that the 
amniocentesis needle is exceptionally long, and you may be afraid of long 
needles. But the needle’s length, which enables it to reach the amniotic sac, 
doesn’t make it painful. A needle’s thickness determines how uncomfortable 
it is, and an amniocentesis needle is very thin.
The procedure typically lasts no longer than one to two minutes, but it may 
seem like an eternity to an anxious woman. It’s mildly uncomfortable but not 
terribly painful. Many women feel a slight, brief cramping sensation as the 
needle goes into the uterus and then a weird pulling sensation as the fluid is 
withdrawn through the needle. Some women worry about moving too much 
during an amniocentesis. This usually isn’t a problem. If you really are flinch-
ing or moving too much, your doctor will let you know. Also, it’s a common 
misconception that the risk of an amniocentesis is that the needle may hurt 
the baby. This really isn’t a concern. Sometimes a fetus may actually brush 
up against the needle, but this doesn’t cause any harm.
Having an amniocentesis performed isn’t altogether pain-free, but most 
women report that it isn’t as bad as they expected it to be. Afterward, your 
doctor may advise you to rest and avoid strenuous activity and sex for one 
to two days. Most women cramp a bit the day of the procedure, which is 
expected and normal.

151
 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
A genetic amniocentesis primarily tests to see that 23 chromosome pairs 
are present and that their structure is normal. It doesn’t routinely test for all 
possible genetic diseases or birth defects. The amniotic fluid cells must be 
incubated before your doctor can read the results of a genetic amniocentesis. 
Results are usually available in one to two weeks.
 
If prenatal blood studies show that you’re Rh-negative, your doctor will give 
you an injection of Rh-D immune globulin (Rhogam and Rhophylac are two 
examples currently on the market), which helps prevent Rh sensitization (see 
Chapter 16).
Risks and side effects of amniocentesis
Not all patients have these symptoms or problems after an amniocentesis, 
but remember that they can occur:
 
✓ Cramping: Some women experience cramping for several hours after the 
procedure. The best treatment for this cramping is rest. Some practitio-
ners recommend a single glass of wine to help ease the discomfort.
 
✓ Spotting: This may last one to two days.
 
✓ Amniotic fluid leak: A leakage of 1 to 2 teaspoons of fluid through the 
vagina occurs in 1 to 2 percent of patients. In the great majority of these 
cases, the membrane seals over within 48 hours. Leakage stops and the 
pregnancy continues normally. If you experience a large amount of leak-
age or persistent leakage, call your doctor.
 
✓ Fetal injury: Injury to the fetus is extremely rare, given the use of ultra-
sound guidance.
The new frontier: 3-D and 4-D ultrasound
Some perinatal ultrasound centers now have 
special machines with the capability of show-
ing 3-dimensional images of the fetus, known 
as 3-D ultrasound. 4-D ultrasound is similar, but 
instead of seeing a still (static) 3-D picture, you 
can see the fetus move. These high-tech ultra-
sound machines aren’t available everywhere, 
and no medical data has shown that a 3-D or 
4-D ultrasound is better at detecting problems 
than the usual 2-D image. However, you may 
see certain features in the fetus better, such as 
the face, hands, and feet. Also, many women 
experience a real bonding with the fetus, seeing 
it three-dimensionally. If a 3-D or 4-D ultrasound 
is available, you may enjoy and benefit from the 
experience. If not, don’t feel bad — you’ll have 
the baby — all four dimensions of it — in real 
life soon enough.

152
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Miscarriage: Although amniocentesis is considered very safe, it’s still 
invasive and is associated with a small risk of pregnancy loss. Recent 
studies have shown that the risk of pregnancy loss after amniocentesis 
is much less than the 0.5 percent risk previously quoted and is probably 
closer to about 1 in 1,000.
 
 Your decision to undergo the procedure must weigh both risks and ben-
efits, which vary according to the individual. For example, a 40-year-old 
woman with a history of infertility may not want to undergo any test that 
carries an increased risk of miscarriage, even though she stands a higher 
risk of carrying a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality. On the other 
hand, a 32-year-old maternal-fetal medicine specialist who sees patients 
with a multitude of problems every day — we’re thinking of Joanne during 
her first pregnancy — may opt to undergo an amniocentesis even though 
her risk of having a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality is relatively 
low — lower, in fact, than her risk of miscarriage because of the test. The 
peace of mind may be worth the small increased risk of miscarriage.
 
An amniocentesis performed later in the pregnancy — later than 20 weeks — 
doesn’t carry the same increased risk of miscarriage. It carries only a very small 
risk of infection, rupture of membranes (breaking the water), or onset of labor.
Reasons for having an amniocentesis
Your practitioner may recommend a genetic amniocentesis for the following 
conditions or situations:
 
✓ Your age is 35 or more at your due date (even though the recommen-
dations are changing, as mentioned earlier, some practitioners still 
recommend amniocentesis for all women over the age of 35). This age 
recommendation also depends on the number of babies you’re carry-
ing. For example, if you’re carrying twins, your practitioner may offer an 
amniocentesis at age 33.
 
✓ You had an elevated MSAFP (see the section “Alpha-fetoprotein screen,” 
earlier in this chapter).
 
✓ You had abnormal results from Down syndrome screening (during 
either your first or second trimester).
 
✓ Your ultrasound exam was abnormal, indicating, for example, poor fetal 
growth or suspected structural abnormalities.
 
✓ You had a previous child or previous pregnancy with a chromosomal 
abnormality.
 
✓ You’re at risk of having a baby with a certain genetic disease.
 
✓ You and your partner have concerns and want to confirm that the chro-
mosomes are normal.

153
 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
Your practitioner may perform amniocentesis for other reasons:
 
✓ Preterm labor: An infection within the amniotic fluid may be a cause of 
preterm labor. Your practitioner can send the fluid to a lab for tests to 
look for any such infection. If an infection is present, your doctor may 
want to deliver your baby right away to minimize harm to you and 
the baby.
 
✓ Other infections: Some patients may find that they’re at risk of develop-
ing infections such as toxoplasmosis, CMV (cytomegalovirus), or parvo-
virus (see Chapter 17). The amniotic fluid can be tested for evidence of 
such problems in patients at risk.
 
✓ Rh sensitization: Patients with Rh sensitization are sometimes monitored 
with a test known as delta OD-450, in which the amniotic fluid is exam-
ined for evidence of broken-down fetal red blood cells. See Chapter 16.
 
✓ Lung maturity studies: Sometimes your doctor needs to find out 
whether the fetus’s lungs are mature enough for the baby to be deliv-
ered. Certain tests on the amniotic fluid can determine the maturity of 
the lungs.
Other prenatal tests and procedures
Not all the tests or procedures in this section are performed in all pregnancies — 
only when a specific problem is present. When needed, they are usually per-
formed in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. In fact, most of these tests are rarely done 
and are usually done in centers that specialize in fetal medicine. They may 
sound scary, but we include them just to let you know what may be available 
if you develop a problem.
Fetal blood sampling
For fetal blood sampling — also known as PUBS (percutaneous umbilical blood 
sampling) or cordocentesis — a doctor withdraws fetal blood from the umbili-
cal cord. This test lets your doctor obtain blood for rapid chromosomal 
diagnosis when time is critical. Your doctor may perform this test in order to 
diagnose fetal infections, to detect evidence of fetal anemia, or to diagnose 
and treat a condition called nonimmune hydrops, in which fluid accumulates 
abnormally in the fetus. A maternal-fetal medicine specialist performs the 
procedure under ultrasound guidance. The procedure is similar to an amnio-
centesis except that the doctor directs the needle into the umbilical cord 
rather than into the amniotic fluid. Risks are low but include infection, rup-
ture of the membranes, or fetal loss. (The risk of fetal loss is about 1 percent.)

154
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Some fetuses develop anemia, which can be treated in utero (within the 
womb) with a blood transfusion directly into the umbilical cord. Conditions 
that may lead to anemia include certain infections (like parvovirus), genetic 
diseases, or certain blood group incompatibilities (see Chapter 16).
Fetal echocardiogram
A fetal echocardiogram is basically a sonogram focused on the fetal heart. A 
maternal-fetal medicine specialist, a pediatric cardiologist, or a radiologist 
usually performs this procedure. You may need a fetal echo if you have a his-
tory of diabetes or a family history of congenital heart disease, or if an ultra-
sound shows any signs of a heart abnormality. Sometimes your practitioner 
recommends a fetal echo if he sees any structural problem on ultrasound, 
because heart abnormalities are often associated with other birth defects.
Doppler studies
Ultrasound can be used to perform Doppler studies of fetal and umbilical 
blood flow. These studies are a way of assessing blood flow to various organ 
systems and also within the placenta. A Doppler study is sometimes used as 
a test of well-being in fetuses with IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction). See 
Chapter 16 for more on IUGR.
Looking at Third-Trimester Tests
As your pregnancy winds down, your practitioner may perform certain tests 
to make sure that your baby is as healthy as possible. Some tests, like Group 
B strep cultures, are done so that measures may be taken to avoid certain 
problems. Other tests, like a non-stress test or a biophysical profile, are per-
formed to ensure fetal well-being.
Taking Group B strep cultures
The only routine test that may be performed during one of your final prenatal 
visits is a culture for Group B strep, bacteria commonly found in the vagina 
and rectum. The Centers for Disease Control and the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommend that all women be rou-
tinely screened for Group B strep at around 36 weeks gestation. About 15 
to 20 percent of women harbor this organism. If the culture is positive at 36 
weeks, your doctor will recommend that you receive antibiotics during labor 
to reduce the risk of transmitting the bacteria to the baby. Treating the bac-
teria any earlier doesn’t help, because it can come back by the time you’re in 
labor. Currently, no tests that yield immediate results are available, so you 
can’t test for Group B strep at the time of labor; it must be done in advance.

 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
Gauging lung maturity
If you’re planning a repeat cesarean delivery (meaning that you had one in an 
earlier pregnancy) or an elective induction at less than 39 weeks, some prac-
titioners may recommend that you have an amniocentesis to establish that 
the fetus’s lungs are mature and ready to function.
 
The most commonly performed test for lung maturity is called L/S ratio, which 
measures the ratio of lecithin to sphingomyelin (both are substances found in 
the amniotic fluid). If the L/S ratio is 2.0 or greater or PG (phosphatidyl glycerol, 
a substance produced by mature lung cells) is present in the amniotic fluid, 
the baby’s lungs are considered mature.
Assessing your baby’s current health
At certain times, your practitioner may suggest that you undergo tests for 
the baby. These tests, also referred to as antepartum fetal surveillance, check 
the baby’s well-being. Your practitioner can perform these tests at any time 
after about 24 to 26 weeks if cause for concern exists, or after 41 weeks if you 
haven’t delivered. Several different tests can be used; we describe these tests 
in the following sections.
Non-stress test (NST)
Non-stress testing consists of measuring the fetal heart rate, fetal movement, 
and uterine activity by a special monitoring machine. Your practitioner 
hooks you up to this device, which picks up uterine contractions and the 
baby’s heart rate and generates a tracing of both. The NST is similar to the 
device used during labor to monitor the fetal heart rate and contractions. 
You also receive a button to press each time you perceive fetal movement. 
The monitoring goes on for about 20 to 40 minutes. The doctor then looks at 
the tracing for signs of accelerations, or increases, in the fetal heart rate. If 
accelerations are present and occur often enough, the test is considered reac-
tive, and the fetus is thought to be healthy and should continue to be so for 
three to seven days. (The fetus is healthy in more than 99 percent of cases.) 
If the accelerations aren’t adequate (that is, the test is nonreactive), you still 
have no cause for alarm. In 80 percent of cases, the fetus is fine and probably 
just in sleep cycle, but further evaluation is needed.
Your practitioner may perform this test (which is usually repeated once or 
twice a week) for a variety of reasons, particularly when
 
✓ You are past your due date.
 
✓ The baby is not growing properly.
 
✓ You have a decreased volume of amniotic fluid.

156
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
✓ Your blood pressure is high.
 
✓ You have diabetes.
 
✓ You notice decreased fetal movement.
Contraction stress test (CST)
The contraction stress test is similar to a non-stress test except that the fetal 
heart is timed in relation to uterine contractions. The contractions some-
times occur by themselves but more often are brought on with low doses of 
oxytocin (Pitocin) or by nipple stimulation.
 
Don’t stimulate your nipples at home to bring on contractions. Perform nipple 
stimulation only under your doctor’s supervision, because you doctor wants 
to monitor you and make sure that the uterus doesn’t contract too much.
Three good contractions in a ten-minute period need to be present in order 
for the test to be interpreted. If the fetal heart rate doesn’t drop after the 
contractions, the test is considered negative, and the baby is thought to be 
fine for at least one more week. If the test is positive (the fetal heart rate does 
drop after the contractions) or suspicious, your practitioner investigates the 
situation further. Proper management depends on your particular situation. 
A CST is performed if the results of the non-stress test are inconclusive, or if 
your doctor wants additional testing of fetal well-being.
A CST shouldn’t be performed under certain circumstances, such as if the 
mother has placenta previa (see Chapter 16) or if she’s at risk of preterm 
delivery.
Biophysical profile (BPP)
A biophysical profile, which combines ultrasound with a non-stress test, may 
be performed instead of the NST alone, or in addition to the NST if further 
testing is warranted. Which test is performed (NST or BPP) is often just a 
matter of physician preference.
The BPP evaluates the following:
 
✓ Fetal movements, observed by ultrasound
 
✓ Fetal body tone, observed by ultrasound
 
✓ Fetal breathing movements for 30 seconds in a row (chest motions that 
mimic breathing), observed by ultrasound
 
✓ Quantity of amniotic fluid, observed by ultrasound
 
✓ Non-stress test (see “Non-stress test” earlier in this section)

157
 Chapter 8: Understanding Prenatal Testing
The baby receives 2 points for each parameter that’s normal. A perfect score 
is 10 out of 10. Babies who score 8 out of 10 or better are considered okay. A 
score of 6 out of 10 is probably fine but usually calls for follow-up testing. A 
score of less than 6 out of 10 needs further evaluation.
Vibracoustic stimulation
Your doctor may perform a vibracoustic stimulation test during a non-stress 
test. During the test, the fetus’s response to stimulation by sound or vibra-
tions is observed. The practitioner “buzzes” the mother’s belly with a vibrat-
ing device, which causes a transmission of sound or vibrations to the fetus. 
Normally, the fetal heart rate accelerates when the fetus is stimulated in this 
way. Vibracoustic stimulation can often cut down the time necessary to perform 
a non-stress test, because you see accelerations in the heart rate more quickly. 
It is often performed if the NST is still not reactive after 20 to 30 minutes.
Doppler velocimetry
A doctor performs a Doppler velocimetry test only in certain situations — 
if certain fetal problems exist (like intrauterine growth restriction — see 
Chapter 16), for example, or if you have high blood pressure. Basically, 
with this test, your doctor performs a special type of ultrasound exam that 
assesses the blood flow through the umbilical cord.

Chapter 9
Checking Your Pregnancy 
Week-By-Week
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what to expect as your pregnancy progresses
▶ Scheduling doctor appointments and routine tests
▶ Getting ready for your baby’s birth
T
his chapter is new for this third edition of Pregnancy For Dummies in 
response to women’s requests to look at their pregnancies at a glance 
week-by-week. As we indicate throughout this book, pregnancy is usually 
referred to as a 40-week enterprise, which is a tad misleading. The pregnancy 
starts at conception, which — with a normal 28 day cycle — is two weeks after 
the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). So, if you start at concep-
tion, pregnancy is only 38 weeks, but obstetricians use 40 weeks because most 
women don’t know when they conceive but do remember when their LMP was.
Many of the things we mention in a particular week may still be important 
at other times throughout the pregnancy. So, just because we mention ultra-
sound at 20 weeks doesn’t mean it can’t be done at any time throughout the 
pregnancy. Feel free to find where you are in your pregnancy and check off 
each important item after you do it.
Some things we include in this chapter are optional and may not be neces-
sary for everyone. We include them for the sake of completeness and so that 
you’ll have some information to frame the discussion with your provider 
about whether they’re right for you. Also, the week/weeks we assign to pre-
natal tests or pregnancy events is an approximation. Don’t be overly alarmed 
if, in your pregnancy, they are off by a week or so.

160
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
Weeks 0–4
If you suspect that you’re pregnant, you’re probably excited and want to 
know definitively whether you are pregnant. The first four weeks are impor-
tant because the pregnancy is getting established as the implantation pro-
cess is underway.
During these initial weeks, take the following steps:
 
❑ Record your last menstrual period (LMP). Doing so helps your provider 
better estimate your due date (40 weeks from your LMP). Be sure to tell 
her if your cycles are irregular.
 
❑ Begin taking a daily prenatal vitamin if you haven’t already. Check to 
see that the vitamin has at least 400 micrograms of folic acid to make 
sure your baby is as healthy as possible.
 
❑ Check for ovulation. Some women know when they ovulate by a sensa-
tion known as mittelschmerz (German for “middle pain” due to the mild 
pain that may be felt when the egg is released from the ovary, typically 
14 days after the LMP). Others know they’ve ovulated due to a change in 
the cervical mucous or a positive reading from an ovulation prediction 
kit (see Chapter 1).
 
 Fertilization usually occurs within the fallopian tube. The embryo starts 
as one cell. During the first week, that cell divides many times as it 
moves down the fallopian tube toward the uterine cavity.
 
❑ Take your first pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests check for a hormone 
called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the 
embryo as it implants into the wall of the uterus — usually 5 to 7 days 
after conception. By the time you miss a period, around 10 days after 
conception, your pregnancy test will most likely be positive.
 
 Don’t be too concerned if you have a little spotting around the time 
when you would expect your period. This is most likely due to the 
embryo implanting in the womb (implantation bleeding).
At the end of the fourth week, your baby measures 0.2 inches (4 millimeters) 
in length.
Weeks 5–8
By this time, the pregnancy is well established and you’re feeling the typical 
signs and symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea and fatigue. It’s an impor-
tant time to make any necessary lifestyle changes, if you haven’t already 
done so (like stopping smoking or adjusting medications).

161
 Chapter 9: Checking Your Pregnancy Week-By-Week
During this time, begin making these necessary medical appointments:
 
❑ Call your doctor to make an appointment for your first prenatal visit. 
Most doctors want to see their patients before 8 to 10 weeks.
 
❑ Talk to your healthcare provider about scheduling an ultrasound or 
obtaining a heartbeat by Doppler to confirm a healthy pregnancy. An 
ultrasound during this period is very accurate at establishing your due date 
and can also tell you whether you’re having one, two, or even more babies!
 
 This is the time most of the organ systems are beginning to form. The 
first organ to start working is the heart. It’s amazing to realize it starts 
beating at just 5 weeks, although you can’t see it beating on ultrasound 
until 6 weeks. The baby’s arms and legs are beginning to develop at this 
stage. The head is the biggest part of the embryo because the brain is the 
fastest-growing organ at this time. (Check out Chapter 5 for more on what 
happens during the first trimester.) The placenta is rapidly growing and is 
now the way nutrients and oxygen get to your developing baby.
 
❑ If you are taking any medications, call or see your doctor earlier than 
the 8-10 weeks mentioned. You want to make sure that these meds 
aren’t a problem for your developing baby. You should also discuss any 
over-the-counter or herbal medications you’re taking to make sure they 
aren’t a problem.
At the end of the eighth week, your baby measures 1.2 inches (30 mm) in 
length. Your uterus is about the size of a medium orange.
Weeks 9–12
Although you won’t be feeling it this early, this is the time when your baby 
starts to move around. If you’re having an ultrasound at this time, you may 
actually see these movements on the screen. Before 10 weeks, male and 
female embryos look the same. After 10 weeks, their external genitalia start 
to develop differently, although your practitioner may not be able to see this 
difference on ultrasound until after 14 to 15 weeks. By the end of the tenth 
week, all the organ systems have formed. The brain is unique in that it con-
tinues to develop throughout pregnancy and even into childhood.
You want to consider the following counseling and testing at this time:
 
❑ Schedule an appointment for genetic counseling if you have a family 
history of genetic problems. Your doctor may also recommend it 
depending on varying circumstances.
 
❑ Make sure you schedule your first trimester screen for Down syn-
drome. Remember, the best time to do this is at 11 to 12 weeks (see 
Chapter 8).

162
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
 
❑ If you’re considering having a chorionic villus sampling (CVS), weeks 
10 to12 are the best time to do this. See Chapter 8 for more information 
on this test.
At the end of week 12, your baby is 2.13 inches (5.4 mm) long and weighs less 
than half an ounce (around 14 g). Your uterus is the size of a large orange.
Weeks 13–16
Congratulations! You and your baby made it through the first trimester. 
You’re starting to feel more like yourself — you have more energy and less 
nausea. After week 14, the majority of the amniotic fluid surrounding your 
baby is made up of the baby’s urine. By week 15, an experienced sonogra-
pher can tell by ultrasound whether you’re having a boy or a girl. By week 16, 
your baby starts to grow fine, soft hair (called lanugo) and fingernails.
The following considerations apply during this time period:
 
❑ Between weeks 15 and 18, have your blood drawn to check the alpha-
fetoprotein (AFP) level. This blood test helps to identify fetal abnormali-
ties like spina bifida. This is also the time to have the second part of 
your Down syndrome screening (quad screen).
 
❑ Schedule your amniocentesis between weeks 16 and 18 if you’re 
planning on having one. See Chapter 8 for the reasons to consider an 
amniocentesis.
 
❑ Consider shopping at a maternity store. Many women start to show at 
this time. If you aren’t showing, don’t worry because some body types 
hide pregnancy better than others.
At the end of week 16, your baby is 4.6 inches (11.6 cm) long and weighs 
about 3.5 ounces (100 g). Your uterus is the size of a large grapefruit.
Weeks 17–20
During weeks 17 to 20, your baby begins to put on some fat and looks more 
like a real baby. The baby’s skeleton, which starts out mostly as cartilage, is 
now transforming into bone. Often you may notice a little fluttering sensation 
in your abdomen. This could be gas, but more likely it’s early fetal move-
ment, also known as quickening. By 20 weeks, the top of the uterus (called the 
fundus) is at the level of your belly button. Twenty weeks is the halfway mark, 
so you should congratulate yourself. The second half usually flies by faster 
than the first.

163
 Chapter 9: Checking Your Pregnancy Week-By-Week
You want to keep the following in mind:
 
❑ Schedule your anatomy ultrasound. This is the ultrasound where the 
doctor is able to check all the baby’s anatomy and make sure she is 
growing properly and is surrounded by normal amniotic fluid.
 
❑ Pay attention to the baby’s movements. This period is when many 
women start to feel the baby move, which is called quickening. First-
time moms, though, don’t always feel quickening this early, so don’t be 
alarmed if you haven’t.
Your baby now weighs about 10 ounces (300 g) and is about 10 inches 
(26 cm) long.
Weeks 21–24
During this time, there aren’t any actual tasks that you have to schedule with 
your provider, other than your routine prenatal visits (which should be about 
every four weeks during this period). Your baby’s lungs are going through a very 
important phase of development. The lining of the lungs is beginning to thin out 
enough to allow for gas exchange. You may be experiencing discomfort on either 
side of your lower abdomen (in the groin area) known as round ligament pain. 
The round ligaments are actual ligaments that attach from the top of the uterus 
to the labia. At this time, many women feel an uncomfortable pulling sensation, 
which tends to worsen upon standing and improve upon sitting or lying down. 
The good news is that after 24 weeks, round ligament pain usually goes away.
At this time your baby is regularly swallowing large amounts of amniotic 
fluid, and excreting urine back into the amniotic cavity. The baby’s finger-
nails are almost fully formed, and she has started to grow eyelashes and eye-
brows. The lanugo is turning from a pale color to a darker hue.
By 24 weeks, your baby is considered viable. This means survival on the 
outside is possible, although the baby would need a great deal of medical 
attention. The top of your uterus is usually at or above the level of your belly 
button. At the end of this period, your baby weighs about 1 pound, 5 ounces 
(600 g) and measures about 12 inches (30 cm) long.
Weeks 25–28
Your baby’s bones are continuing to harden, and her fingernails, toes, eye-
brows, and eyelashes are fully present. Meanwhile, your baby’s skin is still 
fairly see-through, although it is changing from transparent to a more opaque 
look. You should still be seeing your provider about every four weeks during 
this period of pregnancy.

164
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
The following considerations are typically addressed during this time:
 
❑ Get your glucose screen during this period. This is the blood test to 
screen for gestational diabetes. You’re instructed to drink a 50-gram 
glucose drink (it tastes like flat soda), and your blood is drawn one hour 
later. If the glucose level is above a certain value, a definitive test called 
a GTT (glucose tolerance test) is needed. You’re instructed to fast the 
night before this test so that your fasting glucose level can be deter-
mined with the initial blood draw. You then drink a 100-gram glucose 
drink and have your blood drawn every hour for the next three hours. 
Two abnormal values are needed for a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. 
During the glucose screening process, your doctor may draw some addi-
tional blood to check for conditions like anemia.
 
❑ If your blood type is Rh negative (see Chapter 16), you need to get a 
shot of Rh immune globulin. This shot (sometimes called by the brand 
names Rhogam or Rhophylac) can prevent any effects of incompatibility 
between you and your baby.
The top of your uterus is a couple of inches above your belly button. By 28 
weeks your baby weighs about 1 pound, 4 ounces (1 kg). She is about 13.8 
inches (35 cm) long.
Weeks 29–32
Your baby’s eyes can now open. Her permanent teeth have developed, and 
the lungs and digestive tract are nearly mature. In order to keep a closer eye 
on you and your baby, your practitioner will start to schedule your prenatal 
visits every two weeks during this time.
The following steps are recommended during this time:
 
❑ If you haven’t started childbirth classes, begin them now. Many alter-
natives are available, so check with your doctor or the hospital where 
you will deliver. Chapter 7 discusses several options. If you’ll have help 
taking care of your newborn, remember that it’s a good idea for all care-
givers (including you and your partner) to take an infant CPR class, to be 
as prepared as possible for your newborn.
 
❑ Pay closer attention to your baby’s movements. Although fetuses still 
spend most of their time sleeping, they start to develop clear sleep and 
wake cycles. A good general rule is that feeling about six movements in an 
hour is a sign of fetal well-being. You don’t have to feel these movements 
every hour, but if you’re ever concerned that you’re not feeling your 
normal fetal movement, lie down and count the movements. If you can 
feel six movements in an hour, you can rest assured that this is normal.

165
 Chapter 9: Checking Your Pregnancy Week-By-Week
 
 The nature of the fetal movements may also change. Instead of the big 
punches and kicks you were feeling earlier, the movements during this 
time may be gentler, rolling type movements.
 
❑ Undergo a follow-up ultrasound if your practitioner orders one. This 
ultrasound can confirm that the baby is growing normally and has a 
good amount of amniotic fluid. Most also follow growth by measuring 
your uterine height every time you visit.
The top of your uterus is midway between your navel and your sternum. By 
32 weeks, your baby weighs about 3 pounds, 11 ounces to 4 pounds (1.7 kg) 
and is 16-17 inches (40 cm) long.
Weeks 33–36
If you’re having twins, you should be well prepared for their arrival now, 
because on average, twins deliver at about 35 to 36 weeks. During this time, 
you may be feeling lots of rhythmic fetal movements, which are really the 
baby hiccupping. These hiccups can continue even after the baby is born.
The following considerations come into play now:
 
❑ Get a culture taken for GBS (group B strep). Your doctor tests for these 
common bacteria that can be found in the vagina or rectum. If your GBS 
culture is positive, your doctor will place you on antibiotics during labor 
to prevent the baby from contracting the infection. There isn’t any point 
in treating it earlier, because it can just come back again.
 
❑ Continue to pay attention to the baby’s movements. Even though 
you’re used to feeling kicks and punches, it’s normal for the intensity 
of these movements to decrease during these last weeks of pregnancy. 
It’s the number that is important, though, rather than the intensity. See 
Chapter 7 for more info about fetal movements in the third trimester.
The top of your uterus is a couple of inches below your sternum. At or just 
after 36 weeks, your doctor will see you at least once per week until you 
deliver. Your baby weighs about 5 pounds, 2 ounces (2.3 kg) and is almost 18 
inches (45 cm) long.
Weeks 37–40
Congratulations — you are now considered full-term. Even though you may not 
yet be at your due date, any delivery that occurs at or after 37 weeks is called 
full-term. You may notice irregular contractions that come and go in spurts. 

166
Part II: Pregnancy: A Drama in Three Acts 
The big event can happen any time during this period, so be prepared — day 
or night.
The following steps can ensure that you’re ready for the big day to arrive!
 
❑ Make sure your bags are packed, and you have the phone numbers of 
your practitioners handy! If you have other children at home, make sure 
you have all the arrangements set for their care, in case you go into labor.
 
 Loss of your mucous plug, bloody show, or loose stools may happen 
during the days before labor. Unfortunately, they don’t determine when 
labor will happen with any certainty.
 
❑ If you’re planning an elective delivery before 39 weeks, either by 
labor induction or cesarean section, you’ll need to have an amniocen-
tesis to check on the baby’s lung maturity. The risks of this procedure 
at this time are small. The major risk is that your water may break or 
you may go into labor (although usually this doesn’t occur).
The average baby at full term weighs about 7 1/2 pounds (close to 3.5 kg), but 
there is a wide degree of variation in what is considered normal. At this point 
in pregnancy, your baby will put on about a quarter of a pound per week until 
delivery. The top of your uterus should be at or just below your sternum or 
breastbone. Babies at 40 weeks average about 20 to 21 inches (51 to 52 cm) long.
Weeks 40–42
Don’t worry — the end really is in sight. If you haven’t gone into labor on 
your own, your doctor will likely schedule you for either induction or cesar-
ean section by 42 weeks. Because the risks to continuing the pregnancy really 
increase after 42 weeks, your baby should be delivered by that time. Your 
doctor makes sure your baby remains healthy during this time:
 
❑ Your doctor monitors you with non-stress tests to check on fetal well-
being. This is a non-invasive way to make sure the baby is tolerating the 
in-utero environment. (See Chapter 16 for more information.)
 
❑ Your doctor checks the amount of amniotic fluid present to make sure 
it’s still adequate. The amniotic fluid volume usually tends to decrease 
after 36 weeks, so it is not uncommon for it to be low at this time. Low 
amniotic fluid volume is a common reason for labor induction during 
this period.
Although the baby continues to grow after 40 weeks, the rate of growth slows 
a little, and she may not put on the quarter-pound per week that she did in 
the few weeks before 40 weeks.

The Big Event: 
Labor, Delivery, 
and Recovery

In this part . . .
A
nd now for the moment you’ve all been waiting for. . . . 
Like pregnancy itself, childbirth can go more smoothly 
if you know what’s going to happen. For example, you can 
benefit by being aware of the various ways in which you 
may deliver or the choices you have about anesthesia. We 
fill the chapters in this section with details about child-
birth, as well as taking care of yourself and feeding your 
baby after delivery. We don’t intend for this part to be over-
whelming, just comprehensive enough to prepare you for 
the big event.

Chapter 10

▶ Looking at the three stages of labor
▶ Managing the pain of childbirth
▶ Checking out alternative birthing methods
D
espite the incredible advances that have been made in science and 
medicine, no one really knows what causes labor to begin. Labor may 
be triggered by a combination of stimuli generated by the mother, the baby, 
and the placenta. Or labor may begin because of rising levels of steroid-like 
substances in the mother or other biochemical substances produced by the 
baby. Because we don’t know exactly how labor starts, we also can’t pinpoint 
exactly when it will occur.
This chapter helps you recognize the signs of labor and tells you what to 
expect at each of the three stages of labor. It also addresses such important 
issues as labor induction, pain management, the monitoring of your baby’s 
health, and alternative birthing methods.
Knowing When Labor Is Real — 
and When It Isn’t
Being unsure whether you’re really in labor is actually fairly common. Even 
a woman expecting her third or fourth child doesn’t always know when she’s 
genuinely in labor. This section helps you better identify your own labor (but 
you still may find yourself calling your practitioner several times or even 
making many trips to the hospital or birthing center, only to find out that 
what you think is labor really isn’t).

170
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
You may experience some of the early symptoms of labor before labor actu-
ally begins. Rather than indicating that you’re in labor, the following symp-
toms suggest that labor may occur fairly soon. Some women experience 
these labor-like symptoms for days or weeks, and others experience them 
only for several hours. Most of the time, going into labor isn’t as dramatic as 
it’s portrayed on sitcoms (picture Lucy saying, “Ricky, this is it!”). Women 
very rarely lack the time they need to get to the hospital before they deliver.
 
If you think you’re in active labor, don’t run to the hospital right away. Instead, 
telephone your practitioner first.
Noticing changes before labor begins
As you near the end of your pregnancy, you may recognize certain changes 
as your body prepares for the big event. You may notice all these symptoms, 
or you may not notice any of them. Sometimes the changes begin weeks 
before labor starts, and sometimes they begin only days before:
 
✓ Bloody show: No, the bloody show isn’t the newest horror flick by 
Wes Craven. As changes in your cervix take place, you may expel some 
mucous discharge mixed with blood from your vagina. The blood comes 
from small, broken capillaries in your cervix.
 
✓ Diarrhea: Usually a few days before labor, your body releases prosta-
glandins, which are substances that help the uterus contract and may 
cause diarrhea.
 
✓ Dropping and engagement: Especially in women who are giving birth 
for the first time, the fetus often drops into the pelvis several weeks 
before labor (see Chapter 7). You may feel increased pressure on your 
vagina and sharp pains radiating to your vagina. You also may notice 
that your whole uterus is lower in your belly and that you’re suddenly 
more comfortable and can breathe more easily.
 
✓ Increase in Braxton-Hicks contractions: You may notice an increase in 
the frequency and strength of Braxton-Hicks contractions (see Chapter 7). 
These contractions may become somewhat uncomfortable, even if they 
don’t grow any stronger or more frequent. Some women experience strong 
Braxton-Hicks contractions for weeks before labor begins.
 
✓ Mucous discharge: You may secrete a thick mucous discharge known 
as the mucous plug. During your pregnancy, this substance plugs your 
cervix, protecting your uterus from infection. As your cervix starts to 
thin out (efface) and dilate in preparation for delivery, the plug may 
wash out. Don’t worry; losing your plug doesn’t mean you’re prone to 
infection.

171
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Discerning false labor from true labor
Distinguishing true labor from false labor isn’t always easy. But a few general 
characteristics can help you determine whether the symptoms you’re experi-
encing mean you’re in labor.
In general, you’re in false labor if your contractions
 
✓ Are irregular and don’t increase in frequency
 
✓ Disappear for any reason, but especially when you change position, 
walk, or rest
 
✓ Are not particularly uncomfortable
 
✓ Occur only in your lower abdomen
 
✓ Don’t become increasingly uncomfortable
On the other hand, you’re more likely to be in actual labor if your contractions
 
✓ Grow steadily more frequent, intense, and uncomfortable
 
✓ Last approximately 40 to 60 seconds
 
✓ Don’t go away when you change position, walk, or rest
 
✓ Occur along with leakage of fluid (due to rupture of the membranes)
 
✓ Make normal talking difficult or impossible
 
✓ Stretch across your upper abdomen or are located in your back, radiat-
ing to your front
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “I’ve never had a contraction, so how do I 
know what one feels like?”
A: A contraction occurs when your uterus’s 
muscle tightens and pushes the baby toward the 
cervix. Usually, contractions are uncomfortable 
and, therefore, unmistakable. But many women 
worry that they won’t know that they’re having 
contractions. You can tell whether you’re expe-
riencing contractions by using a quick and easy 
trick.
With your fingertips, touch your cheek and then 
your forehead. Finally, touch the top part of 
your abdomen, through which you can feel the 
top part of your uterus (the fundus). A relaxed 
uterus feels soft, like your cheek, and a con-
tracting uterus feels hard, like your forehead. 
This exercise is also good to try if you think you 
may be in preterm labor (see Chapter 16 for 
more information).

Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Sometimes the only way you can know for sure whether you’re in labor is 
by seeing your practitioner or going to the hospital. When you arrive at the 
hospital, your doctor, a nurse, a midwife, or a resident physician performs a 
pelvic exam to determine whether you’re in labor. The practitioner also may 
hook you up to a monitor to see how often you’re contracting and to see how 
the fetal heart responds. Sometimes you find out right away whether you’re 
truly in labor. But the practitioner may need to keep you under observation 
for several hours to see whether the situation is changing.
You’re considered to be in labor if you’re having regular contractions and 
your cervix is changing fairly rapidly — effacing, dilating, or both. Sometimes 
women walk around for weeks with a partially dilated or effaced cervix but 
aren’t considered to be in labor because these changes are occurring over 
weeks instead of hours.
Deciding when to call your practitioner
 
If you think you’re in labor, call your practitioner. Don’t be embarrassed if he 
tells you you’re probably not in labor (it happens to many women). Timing 
your contractions for several hours before you call, to see whether they’re 
getting closer together, is a good idea because your practitioner can use this 
information to help determine whether you’re in true labor. If your contrac-
tions are occurring every 5 to 10 minutes and they’re uncomfortable, definitely 
call. If you’re less than 37 weeks and feeling persistent contractions, don’t sit 
for hours counting their frequency — call your practitioner immediately.
 
Call your practitioner if any of the following apply to you:
 
✓ Your contractions are coming closer together, and they’re becoming 
increasingly uncomfortable.
 
✓ You have ruptured membranes. Having your water break may come as 
a small amount of watery fluid leaking out, or it may be a big gush. If the 
fluid is green, brown, or red, let your practitioner know right away.
 
 Meconium (your baby’s first bowel movement) usually happens after the 
baby is born, but 2 to 20 percent of babies pass meconium during labor, 
most commonly if they’re born past their due date. Passing meconium 
doesn’t necessarily indicate anything is wrong, but it can occasionally 
be associated with fetal stress.
 
✓ You have bright red heavy bleeding (more than a heavy menstrual 
period) or are passing clots, in which case you should go to the hospital 
immediately (after calling your practitioner).

173
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
 
✓ You’re not feeling an adequate amount of fetal movement (see Chapter 7 
for more information).
 
✓ You have constant, severe abdominal pain with no relief between 
contractions.
 
✓ You feel a fetal part or umbilical cord in your vagina. In this case, go to 
the hospital right away!
Checking for labor with an internal exam
When a practitioner is trying to determine whether you’re in labor, he per-
forms an internal exam to look for several things:
 
✓ Dilation: Your cervix is closed for most of your pregnancy but may grad-
ually start to dilate during the last couple of weeks, especially if you’ve 
had a baby before. After active labor begins, the rate of cervical dilation 
speeds up, and the cervix dilates to 10 centimeters by the end of the 
first stage of labor. Often, you’re considered to be in active labor when 
your cervix is about 4 centimeters dilated or 100 percent effaced.
 
✓ Effacement: Effacement is a thinning out or shortening of the cervix, 
which happens during labor. Your cervix goes from being thick (unef-
faced) to 100 percent effaced. See Figure 10-1.

✓ Station: When you’re in labor, the practitioner uses the term station 
to describe how far your baby’s head (or other presenting part) has 
descended in the birth canal in relation to the ischial spines, a bony land-
mark in your pelvis (see Chapter 7 for more information on station).
 
✓ Position: When labor begins, the baby typically starts out facing to the 
left or right side. As labor progresses, he rotates until the head assumes 
a facedown position so that the baby comes out looking at the floor. 
Occasionally, the baby rotates to the opposite position and comes out 
sunny side up, looking at the ceiling.
Getting Admitted to the Hospital
Whether you’re in labor, being induced, or having a cesarean delivery, you 
need to be admitted to the hospital’s labor floor. If you’re preregistered (ask 
your practitioner about the process), your records are already on the labor 
floor when you arrive, and a hospital unit number is assigned to you. When 
you arrive at the hospital or birthing center, you go through an admission 
process and are assigned to a room.
Settling into your hospital room
Although each hospital or birthing center has its own system, getting settled 
in usually follows this routine after you get to your room:
 
✓ A nurse asks you to change into a gown.
 
✓ A nurse asks you questions about your pregnancy, your general health, 
your obstetrical history, and when you last ate. If you think your bag of 
water has broken or you’re leaking fluid, let your nurse know.
 
✓ A nurse, midwife, resident, or other practitioner performs an internal 
exam to see how far along in labor you are.
 
✓ Your contractions and the fetal heart rate are monitored.
 
✓ A nurse may draw your blood and start an IV (intravenous) line in your 
arm (for delivering fluids and, possibly, medications).
 
✓ You’re asked to sign a consent form for routine hospital care, delivery, 
and possibly cesarean section. (You sign the consent form when you’re 
admitted in case you need an emergency cesarean during labor and you 
don’t have time to sign consent forms.) Signing a consent form doesn’t 
mean you’re limiting your care options.
 
You may want to hand over any valuables you have with you to your partner 
or another family member (or simply leave them at home).

175
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Checking out the accommodations
Some women go through labor in the same room in which they deliver the 
baby, and others are moved to a different room for delivery. Most hospital 
rooms include some standard features, so the room you are placed in prob-
ably includes all the following:
 
✓ Bed: In a room used for both labor and delivery (also known as a birthing 
room), the bed is specially designed to come apart and be turned into a 
delivery table. Some hospitals have rooms where you labor, deliver, and 
even remain for your postpartum recovery. These rooms are called LDR 
(an acronym for labor, delivery, and recovery) rooms or LDRP rooms (the 
“P” stands for postpartum).
 
✓ Doppler/stethoscope: Your practitioner or nurse uses these portable 
tools to listen periodically to the fetal heartbeat, instead of using the 
continuous fetal monitor.
 
✓ Fetal monitor: This machine has two attachments, one to monitor the 
baby’s heart rate and one to monitor your contractions. The fetal monitor 
generates a fetal heart tracing, which is a paper record of how the baby’s 
heart rate rises and falls in relation to your contractions (see Figure 10-2).
 
✓ Infant warmer: This device has a heat lamp to keep the newborn’s body 
temperature from dropping.
 
✓ IV line: This tube is connected to a bag of saline (salt water) containing 
a glucose mixture to keep you properly hydrated. It also provides access 
for medications in case you need pain control or have an emergency.
 
✓ Rocking chair or recliner: The extra chair is for your partner, your 
coach, or another family member.

Monitoring Your Baby
While you’re in labor, your practitioner keeps an eye on your baby in a 
number of different ways to make sure that he is tolerating the whole process 
well. Most hospitals, and most practitioners, advise monitoring the baby’s 
heart rate during labor. Although some low-risk patients may require only 
intermittent monitoring, other patients are better off with continuous moni-
toring. Sometimes knowing whether continuous monitoring makes sense isn’t 
possible until you’re in labor and your practitioner can see how the baby is 
responding. The following sections outline different ways your practitioner 
may monitor your baby.
Fetal heart monitoring
Labor puts stress on both you and the baby. Fetal heart monitoring provides 
a way to make sure that the baby is handling the stress. Monitoring can be 
done through several techniques.
External monitoring
Electronic fetal heart monitoring uses either two belts or a wide, elastic 
band placed around the abdomen. A device attached to the belt or under the 
band uses an ultrasound-Doppler technique to pick up the fetal heartbeat. A 
second device uses a gauge to pick up the contractions. An external contrac-
tion monitor can show the frequency and duration of contractions, but it 
can’t provide information about how strong they are. An external fetal heart 
monitor gives information about the fetus’s response to contractions and 
records variability — that is, periodic changes in heart rate that help to deter-
mine how the baby is tolerating the labor process.
 
You may hear your practitioner use the following terms to describe the fetal 
heartbeat:
 
✓ Normal baseline heart rate: About 110 to 160 beats per minute.
 
✓ Bradycardia: A decrease in the fetal heart rate from baseline to below 
110 beats per minute that lasts for more than ten minutes.
 
✓ Tachycardia: An increase in the fetal heart rate to above 160 beats per 
minute for more than ten minutes.
 
✓ Accelerations: Brief increases above baseline in the fetal heart rate, 
often after a fetal movement. Accelerations are a reassuring sign.
 
✓ Decelerations: These are intermittent decreases below the baseline fetal 
heart rate. The significance of decelerations depends on their frequency, 
how far the heart rate drops, and when they occur in relation to contrac-
tions. Decelerations are classified as early, variable, or late, according to 
when they occur in relation to contractions.

177
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Internal monitoring
Your practitioner uses an internal fetal heart monitor when your baby needs 
closer observation than is possible with external monitoring. Your prac-
titioner may be concerned about how your baby is tolerating labor, or he 
may simply be having difficulty picking up the heart rate externally — if, for 
example, you’re having more than one baby. The monitor is placed during an 
internal exam. It’s passed through the cervix via a flexible plastic tube. This 
procedure is no more uncomfortable than a pelvic exam. The tiny electrode 
is then attached to the baby’s scalp.
An internal monitor for contractions (called an internal pressure transducer, 
or IPT) is sometimes used to better assess how strong the contractions are. 
The monitor consists of thin, flexible, fluid-filled tubing, which is inserted 
between the fetal head and the uterine wall during an internal exam. 
Sometimes, this same device is used to infuse saline into the uterus — if very 
little amniotic fluid is present or if the fetal heart tracing indicates the umbili-
cal cord is being compressed.
Other tests of fetal health
If the information from the fetal monitor raises concerns or is ambiguous, 
your practitioner can perform other tests to help determine how to proceed 
with your labor.
Scalp pH
If your practitioner is concerned about how well the baby is tolerating labor, 
he may want to perform a scalp pH test. This involves sampling a small 
amount of the baby’s blood through a little prick of his scalp and measuring 
the pH, which reflects how well the baby is doing during labor.
Reassuring patterns
You can take heart when fetal heart monitoring 
indicates the following:
 ✓ A normal baseline heart rate of 110 to 160 
beats per minute
 ✓ An absence of significant fetal heart rate 
decelerations
 ✓ Age-appropriate fetal heart rate accelerations
 ✓ Moderate fetal heart rate variability (fluc-
tuations of the fetal heart rate) of about 6 
to 25 beats per minute above and below 
baseline

178
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Scalp stimulation
Scalp stimulation is an easy test to see how the fetus is doing. The practi-
tioner simply tickles the baby’s scalp during an internal exam. If this touch 
causes the fetal heart rate to increase, the baby is usually doing fine.
Some practitioners, and some mothers, prefer not to monitor. But most doc-
tors believe that monitoring is very useful and the benefits that monitoring 
provides outweigh any risk that monitoring may lead to an unnecessary 
cesarean delivery.
Nudging Things Along: Labor Induction
To induce labor means to cause it to begin before it starts on its own. 
Induction may be elective (performed for the convenience of the patient or 
her practitioner) or it may be a necessity (due to some obstetric, medical, or 
fetal complications).
Elective induction
Although some women like the idea of a planned delivery, others prefer 
labor to occur spontaneously. Some practitioners gladly perform elective 
inductions, and others are opposed to the whole concept of it. A woman may 
choose to undergo an elective induction for several reasons, including the 
following:
 
✓ To enable her to make arrangements for her other children, for her work 
or her partner’s work, or for the convenience of other family members 
by knowing exactly which day she’s going into labor
 
✓ To ensure that a particular physician in a group practice, with whom 
she has developed a special relationship, delivers her baby
 
✓ To deliver when the maximum number of labor floor personnel or 
other specialists are present if she’s at risk for certain neonatal or 
labor complications
 
✓ To reduce anxiety after a history of poor pregnancy outcomes (such as 
a previous full-term fetal death) by delivering earlier than she naturally 
would
 
✓ To make sure she’ll get to the hospital on time if she lives far away and 
has a history of rapid deliveries

179
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Some studies in medical literature suggest elective induction of labor may 
lead to an increase in cesarean deliveries. If the cervix is neither dilated nor 
effaced, or if the fetal head isn’t engaged in the pelvis, the risk of a cesarean 
delivery is probably higher. But if all conditions are favorable for induction, 
the risk of cesarean may not be increased at all. However, the length of time 
the patient spends in the hospital is likely to increase slightly when labor is 
induced.
If an elected induction of labor is planned for a woman who is less than 39 
weeks along in her pregnancy, an amniocentesis to check fetal lung maturity 
is usually required. If you’re considering elective induction of labor, you and 
your partner should fully understand that you may stand a slightly increased 
risk of needing a cesarean delivery. If both the expectant parents and the 
practitioner involved understand these risks, elective induction of labor can 
be appropriate for personal, medical, geographical, or psychological reasons.
Medically indicated induction
An induction is indicated (is a medical necessity) when the risks of continuing 
the pregnancy are greater — for the mother or the baby — than the risks of 
early delivery.
Problems with the mother’s health that may warrant induction include
 
✓ Preeclampsia (see Chapter 16 for more information)
 
✓ The presence of certain diseases, such as diabetes (see Chapter 17) or 
cholestasis (see Chapter 7), which may improve after delivery
 
✓ An infection in the amniotic fluid, such as chorioamnionitis
Potential risks to the baby’s health that may warrant induction include
 
✓ Pregnancy well past the due date. Because this can increase the risk of 
certain complications, most practitioners induce labor after the 41st or 
42nd week.
 
✓ Ruptured membranes before labor has started, a situation that may 
place the baby at risk for developing an infection.
 
✓ Intrauterine growth restriction (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ Suspected macrosomia (fetus weighing more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces).
 
✓ Rh incompatibility with complications (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ Decreased amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios).
 
✓ Tests of fetal well-being indicating the fetus may not be thriving in the 
uterus.

180
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Inducing labor
The way in which labor is induced depends upon the condition of the 
cervix. If your cervix isn’t favorable, or ripe (thinned out, soft, and dilated), 
your practitioner may use various medications and techniques to ripen it. 
Occasionally, ripening alone may put you right into labor.
 
One of the most common agents used for cervical ripening is a form of pros-
taglandin that helps to soften the cervix and may cause contractions, too. A 
commonly used ripening agent is misoprostol, which is a prostaglandin E1 
analog. It comes as a small tablet that’s inserted into the vagina. An alternative 
is a prostaglandin E2, which comes as either a gel (Prepidil) or a vaginal insert 
(Cervidil). 
Some recent information in medical literature indicates that the risk of uter-
ine rupture is higher in women who have had a cesarean section in the past 
and are having labor induced. The risk of this potentially serious complica-
tion seems to be highest if the patient is given a prostaglandin for induction. 
For this reason, many practitioners prefer not to induce with prostaglandins, 
and instead prefer to use a Foley bulb, which is a tiny balloon that is placed in 
the cervix through the vagina and inflated with saline or air to help the cervix 
open up.
If your cervix isn’t yet ripe, you can’t exactly place it on the windowsill for 
a couple days like Grandma did with tomatoes or peaches. If you require 
induction, you’re likely to be admitted to the hospital in the evening and 
given medications to ripen the cervix at bedtime. Then your practitioner can 
administer oxytocin (a synthetic hormone similar to one that your body natu-
rally releases during labor) to induce labor in the morning.
If your cervix is already ripe, you’re likely to be admitted in the morning. 
Labor is then induced either by administering oxytocin intravenously or by 
rupturing your membranes (often called breaking your water). The doctor 
performs an amniotomy, or rupturing of the membranes, with a small plastic 
hook during an internal examination. This procedure usually isn’t painful. 
Your practitioner then instructs your nurse to administer oxytocin (usually 
known by its brand name, Pitocin) through an IV, and a special pump care-
fully adjusts and controls the dosage. You begin with very little medication, 
and the level of medication increases at regular intervals until you have 
adequate contractions. Sometimes labor starts within a few hours after the 
induction is started, but it may take much longer. Occasionally, it may take as 
long as two days to really get things going.

A common misconception is that oxytocin makes labor more painful. It 
doesn’t. Oxytocin is similar to the hormone that your body naturally releases 
during labor, and it is administered in about the same doses that your body 
would produce to cause normal labor.

181
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Augmenting labor
Doctors can also use oxytocin to augment labor that is already happening. If 
your contractions are inadequate or if labor is taking an unusually long time, 
your practitioner may use oxytocin to help move things along. Again, the con-
tractions produced as a result of this augmentation are no stronger and no 
more painful than contractions occurring during a spontaneous labor.
Getting the Big Picture: Stages 
and Characteristics of Labor
Each woman’s labor is, in some ways, unique. An individual woman’s expe-
rience may even vary from pregnancy to pregnancy. Anyone who delivers 
babies knows all too well that labor can always surprise you. As doctors, we 
may expect a woman to deliver quickly and find that her labor takes a long 
time, while another woman, whom we think will take forever, may deliver 
very rapidly. Still, in the vast majority of pregnant women, labor progresses 
in a predictable pattern. It passes through easily discernible stages at a fairly 
standard rate.
 
Your practitioner can track your progress through labor by performing 
internal exams every few hours. How easily you progress through labor is 
measured by how quickly your cervix dilates and how smoothly the fetus 
descends downward through the pelvis and birth canal. By plotting cervical 
dilation and fetal station along a graph (see the section “Discerning false labor 
from true labor” earlier in this chapter for more information), practitioners 
can measure the progress of labor objectively. Your practitioner may track 
your progress through labor using a special graph, called a labor curve (see 
Figure 10-3), to illustrate how the labor is progressing by comparing your 
progress to a standard curve representing the average labor.
Doctors become concerned over the progress of labor if it’s too slow or if 
the cervix stops dilating and the fetus doesn’t descend. They have a short-
hand system for describing the variables that determine how easily a woman 
makes her way through labor: the three Ps (passenger, pelvis, and power). In 
other words, the baby’s size and position (the passenger), the pelvis’s size, 
and the contractions’ strength (the power) are all important factors. Your 
practitioner must pay attention to all these factors, because if labor doesn’t 
progress normally, it may be a sign that the baby would be better off deliv-
ered with assistance — with forceps or vacuum, or by cesarean delivery.
If you’re going through your first delivery, the entire labor process is likely to 
last between 12 and 14 hours. For deliveries after the first one, labor is usu-
ally shorter (about 8 hours). Labor is divided into three stages, described in 
the following sections.

The first stage
The first stage of labor occurs from the onset of true labor to full dilation of 
the cervix. This stage is by far the longest (taking an average of 11 hours for a 
first child and 7 hours for subsequent births). It is divided into three phases: 
the early (latent) phase, the active phase, and the transition phase. Each 
phase has its own unique characteristics.
Early or latent phase
During the early phase of the first stage of labor, contractions occur every 5 
to 20 minutes in the beginning, and they increase in frequency until they’re 
less than 5 minutes apart. The contractions last between 30 and 45 seconds 
at first, but as this phase continues, they work up to 60 to 90 seconds in 
length. During the early phase, your cervix gradually dilates to 3 to 4 centime-
ters and becomes 100 percent effaced.
The entire early phase of the first stage of labor lasts an average of 6 to 7 
hours in a first birth and 4 to 5 hours for subsequent births. But the length of 
labor is unpredictable because knowing when labor actually begins is difficult.

183
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
In the beginning of the early phase, your contractions may feel like menstrual 
cramps, with or without back pain. Your membranes may rupture, and you 
may have a bloody show (see the section “Noticing changes before labor 
begins” earlier in this chapter). If you have been admitted to the hospital, 
your doctor may use a small plastic hook to rupture your membranes for 
you, in order to help things along.
Early on in this phase, you may be most comfortable at home. You can try 
resting or sleeping, or you may want to stay active. Some women find they 
have an overwhelming desire to clean or perform some other household 
chores. If you’re hungry, eat a light meal (soup, juice, or toast, for example), 
but not a very heavy one — in case you later need anesthesia to deal with 
labor complications. You may want to time your contractions, but you don’t 
need to obsess about it.
 
If you start to become more uncomfortable, the contractions occur with more 
frequency or intensity, or your membranes rupture (your water breaks), call 
your practitioner or go to your hospital.
 
Many women find walking around makes them more comfortable and distracts 
them from the pain during the early part of labor. Others prefer to rest in bed. 
Ask your practitioner whether your hospital has any restrictions on walking 
during labor.
Active phase
The active phase of the first stage of labor is usually shorter and more pre-
dictable than the early phase. For a first child, it usually lasts 5 hours, on 
average. For subsequent babies, it lasts about 4 hours. Contractions occur 
every 3 to 5 minutes in this phase, and they last about 45 to 60 seconds. Your 
cervix dilates from 4 to 8 or 9 centimeters.
You may feel increasing discomfort or pain during this phase, and maybe a 
backache as well. Some women experience more pain in the back than in the 
front, a condition known as back labor. This may be a sign that the baby is 
facing toward your front rather than toward your spine.
By this time, you’re likely already in the hospital or birthing center. Some 
patients prefer to rest in bed; others would rather walk around. Do whatever 
makes you comfortable, unless your practitioner asks that you stay in bed 
to be monitored closely. Now is the time to use the breathing and relaxation 
techniques you may have practiced in childbirth classes.
 
If you need pain relief, let your practitioner know (for more information on 
pain relief, see the section “Handling Labor Pain” later in this chapter). Your 
partner may help ease your pain by massaging your back, perhaps by using a 
tennis ball or rolling pin.

184
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Transition phase
Many practitioners consider the transition period to be part of the active 
phase, but we prefer to label it separately. During the transition phase, con-
tractions occur every 2 to 3 minutes and last about 60 seconds. The contrac-
tions during this phase are very intense. Your cervix dilates from 8 or 9 to 10 
centimeters.
In addition to very intense contractions, you may notice an increase in bloody 
show and increased pressure, especially on your rectum, as the baby’s head 
descends. During this last phase of the first stage of labor, you may feel as if 
you have to have a bowel movement. Don’t worry; this sensation is a good 
sign and indicates that the fetus is heading in the right direction.
 
If you feel the urge to push, let your practitioner know. You may be fully 
dilated, but try not to push until your practitioner tells you to do so. Pushing 
before you’re fully dilated can slow the labor process or tear your cervix.
 
Try to practice breathing exercises and relaxation techniques, if they work 
for you. When you want pain medication or an epidural anesthetic, let your 
practitioner know. He decides what pain relief options are best for you based 
on how far along in labor you are and other factors related to your and your 
baby’s health.
Potential problems during labor’s first stage
Most women experience labor’s first stage without any problems. But if a 
problem arises, the following information prepares you with the information 
you need to handle it with a clear, focused mind:
 
✓ Prolonged latent phase: The latent or early phase of labor is considered 
prolonged if it lasts more than 20 hours in a woman having her first child 
or more than 14 hours in someone who has delivered a previous child. 
Your practitioner may not be able to determine when labor actually 
starts, so knowing for sure when labor becomes prolonged isn’t always 
easy either.
 
 When a practitioner determines that labor is taking too long, he 
responds in one of two ways. One approach is to use medication, such 
as a sedative, to help you relax. Labor may then subside (which means 
that it was false labor all along), or active labor may begin. The other 
approach is to try to move labor along by performing an amniotomy 
(rupturing the membranes or breaking your water) or by administering 
oxytocin (Pitocin). Both procedures are covered in more detail earlier in 
this chapter.
 
✓ Protraction disorders: Protraction disorders can occur if the cervix 
dilates too slowly or if the baby’s head doesn’t descend at a normal rate. 
If you’re having your first baby, the cervix should dilate at a minimum 

185
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
rate of 1.2 centimeters an hour, and your baby’s head should descend 
about 1 centimeter an hour. If you have delivered previously, the cervix 
should dilate at least 1.5 centimeters an hour, and your baby’s head 
should descend about 2 centimeters an hour.
 
 Protraction disorders may be caused by cephalopelvic disproportion, or 
CPD, which is the term for a poor fit between the baby’s head and the 
mother’s birth canal. Protraction disorders may also occur because 
the baby’s head is in an unfavorable position or because the number or 
intensity of contractions is inadequate. In both cases, many practitio-
ners try administering oxytocin to improve labor progress.
 
✓ Arrest disorders: Arrest disorders occur if the cervix stops dilating or if 
the baby’s head stops descending for more than two hours during active 
labor. Arrest disorders are often associated with CPD (see the preceding 
bullet), but an infusion of oxytocin may solve the problem. If oxytocin 
doesn’t alleviate the arrest disorder, you may need a cesarean section.
The second stage
Labor’s second stage begins when you’re fully dilated (at 10 centimeters) and 
ends with your baby’s delivery. This part is the “pushing” stage and takes 
about one hour for a first child and 30 to 40 minutes for subsequent births. 
The second stage may be longer if you have an epidural. We describe the 
second stage in detail in Chapter 11.
The third stage
The third stage occurs from the time of delivery of the baby to delivery of the 
placenta — usually less than 20 minutes for all deliveries. We go into more 
detail about this stage in Chapter 11.
Handling Labor Pain
During labor’s first stage, pain is caused by contractions of the uterus and 
dilation of the cervix. The pain may feel like severe menstrual cramps at first. 
But in labor’s second stage, the stretching of the birth canal as the baby 
passes through it adds a different kind of pain — often a feeling of great pres-
sure on the lower pelvis or rectum. But none of this pain needs to be excru-
ciating, thanks to well-practiced breathing and relaxation exercises and, in 
many cases, modern anesthesia.

Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Most practitioners acknowledge that even for women who have diligently 
attended childbirth classes, labor is inherently painful. The degree of pain — 
and the willingness and ability to tolerate it — varies from woman to woman. 
Some women choose to deal with the pain on their own or with the help of 
breathing and distraction techniques mastered in childbirth classes — and 
that’s a perfectly acceptable choice. Many other women want medication to 
help them deal with the pain, no matter how well-prepared they are.
 
Don’t feel that you’re in any way falling short of being a perfect mother or that 
your pregnancy isn’t “natural” if you need medication to help with labor pain. 
We all respond to pain differently, both emotionally and physiologically, so 
even if your best friend, your sister, or your mother got through labor with 
little or no pain medication, you aren’t weak if you choose to use it. Look at it 
this way: Women who are in excruciating pain usually don’t breathe regularly. 
They also tense their muscles, and, by doing so, they may only prolong labor. 
Today doctors generally administer medication in two different ways to help 
you deal with labor pain: systemically — that is, by injection either into a 
blood vessel (intravenously) or into a muscle (intramuscularly) — or region-
ally, with the use of an epidural or other local anesthesia.
Systemic medications
The most common medications used systemically are relatives of the nar-
cotic morphine — drugs such as meperidine (brand name Demerol), fentanyl 
(Sublimaze), butorphanal (Stadol), and nalbuphine (Nubain). These medica-
tions can be given every two to four hours as needed, either intravenously or 
intramuscularly.
 
Any medication you take (even when you’re not pregnant) has side effects, 
and pain relievers used during labor are no exception, although your doctor 
will do what he can to reduce these side effects, often by combining medica-
tions. Nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and a drop in your blood pressure are 
the main side effects for the mother. The degree to which the fetus or new-
born is also affected depends on how close to the time of delivery the medi-
cation is given. If a large dose is given within two hours prior to delivery, the 
newborn may be sleepy or groggy. In rare cases, his breathing may be weak. If 
this problem is significant, your doctor or the baby’s doctor can give a medi-
cation that immediately reverses or counteracts the pain medication. No evi-
dence suggests that these medications, when given in appropriate doses and 
with proper monitoring, have any effect on the progress of labor or on the rate 
of cesarean deliveries.

187
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Regional anesthetics
Systemic medications are distributed via the bloodstream to all parts of 
the body. Yet most of the pain of labor and delivery is concentrated in the 
uterus, vagina, and rectum. So regional anesthesia is sometimes used to 
deliver pain medication to those specific areas. Medications used in regional 
anesthesia can be a local anesthetic (like lidocaine), a narcotic (such as 
those in the preceding section), or a combination of the two. Commonly used 
techniques for administering regional pain relief include epidural and spinal 
anesthesia and caudal, saddle, and pudendal blocks.
Epidural anesthesia
When it comes to relieving labor pain, there is nothing like an epidural. 
Epidural anesthesia is perhaps the most popular form of labor pain relief. 
Almost universally, women who have had it say, “Why didn’t I get this ear-
lier?” or “Why was I hesitant about this?” An anesthesiologist with special 
training in epidural catheter placement must administer an epidural, so epi-
durals may not be available in every hospital.
 
With an epidural, a tiny, flexible, plastic catheter is inserted through a needle 
into your lower back and threaded into the space above the membrane cover-
ing the spinal cord. Before inserting the needle, the anesthesiologist numbs 
your skin with a local anesthetic. While the needle is going in, you may feel 
a brief tingling sensation in your legs, but the process really isn’t painful for 
most women. After the catheter is in place, medication can be sent through 
it to numb the nerves coming from the lower part of the spine — nerves that 
go to the uterus, vagina, and perineum. The catheter (not the needle) stays 
in place throughout labor in case you need what’s called a top up dose of the 
anesthetic to get you through the rest of labor and delivery.
A major advantage of epidural anesthesia is that it uses smaller doses of pain 
medication. However, because your sensory nerves run very close to your 
motor nerves, large doses of anesthetic can temporarily affect your ability to 
move your legs during labor.
The amount and type of medication you need can be adjusted according to 
the stage of labor you’re in. During the first stage, pain relief focuses on uter-
ine contractions, but during the second (pushing) stage, pain relief focuses 
on the vagina and perineum, which are distended by the baby passing 
through. Epidurals can also make repairing a tear or episiotomy much more 
tolerable.
Years ago, anesthesiologists wouldn’t give epidurals during early labor 
because it confined patients to their beds for the remainder of their labor. 
Recently, however, walking epidurals — the kind that allows you to walk 

188
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
around, because they use medications that have little or no effect on motor 
function — have become more popular for this often painful stage of labor. 
Some anesthesiologists, however, question the effectiveness of this type of 
epidural in relieving pain.
Epidurals can also relieve pain in cesarean deliveries, although different 
medications in different doses are used. In fact, epidurals are very popular 
for cesareans because they enable the mother to be awake during delivery 
and to experience her child’s birth. In cases in which cesarean delivery is an 
emergency or when the mother has blood-clotting problems, however, an 
epidural may not be possible.
Doctors once thought epidurals, especially if placed too early, prolonged 
labor and increased the need for forceps, vacuum-assisted, or cesarean 
delivery. For this reason, many practitioners were reluctant to recommend 
epidurals to their patients. Most doctors today accept that these problems 
are negligible when an experienced anesthesiologist places the epidural after 
labor is well established, and that the benefit outweighs the risk.
Sometimes the epidural takes away the sensation you feel when your bladder 
is full, so you may need a catheter to empty your bladder. In some cases, the 
epidural may block motor nerves to the point where you have difficulty push-
ing. You also may experience a rapid drop in blood pressure that can lead to 
a temporary drop in the baby’s heart rate.
Overall, pain control simply makes the whole experience of labor and deliv-
ery much more enjoyable for the mother and her partner (and the person 
doing the delivery, too!). We definitely favor epidurals for pain management. 
In fact, when she was pregnant, Joanne joked that she wanted hers placed at 
35 weeks as a preventive measure, so she wouldn’t feel any pain.
Spinal anesthesia
Spinal anesthesia is similar to an epidural but different in that the medica-
tion is injected into the space under the membrane covering the spinal cord, 
rather than above it. This technique is often used for cesarean delivery, espe-
cially when a cesarean is needed suddenly and no epidural was placed during 
labor. The information provided in the preceding section about epidurals 
(regarding the amount of medication needed and the risks involved) applies 
to spinal anesthesia, too.
Caudal and saddle blocks
Caudal and saddle blocks involve placing the medications very low in the 
spinal canal, so they affect only those pain nerves going to the vagina and 
perineum (the area between the vagina and anus). These methods have a 
more rapid onset of pain relief, but the relief wears off sooner.

189
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Pudendal block
Your doctor can place a pudendal block by injecting an anesthetic inside the 
vagina, in the area next to the pudendal nerves. This technique numbs part 
of the vagina and the perineum, but it does nothing to relieve the pain from 
contractions.
General anesthesia
When you have general anesthesia, you’re made fully unconscious by an anes-
thesiologist using a variety of medications. Doctors almost never use this tech-
nique for labor anymore, and this technique is only rarely used for cesarean 
deliveries because it’s associated with a higher risk of complications. General 
anesthesia obviously also causes you to sleep through your baby’s delivery. 
But if, in a cesarean delivery, you have a clotting problem that rules out placing 
a needle into your spinal column or if the cesarean is an emergency and there 
isn’t enough time to place an epidural, general anesthesia should be used.
A menu of epidural techniques
The method used to administer an epidural is 
usually determined by the anesthesiologist, 
based on his expertise, individual preferences, 
and your specific situation (such as how far 
along you are in labor or any medical condi-
tions you may have).The various techniques by 
which an epidural can be administered include 
the following:
 ✓ Intermittent epidural bolus dosing was 
the standard way of administering epidural 
anesthesia for many years. With this tech-
nique, intermittent doses of local anesthesia 
are given through the catheter. Injections 
are either timed to the woman’s complaints 
of pain or set at specific intervals. The dis-
advantage of this method is that often pain 
is felt as the medication wears off, and 
more intervention by the anesthesiologist 
is required.
 ✓ Continuous epidural infusions are an alter-
native that provides continuous infusion of 
pain medicine, which provides a smooth 
and constant relief from pain. If needed, the 
dosing can be changed, and extra medica-
tion can be given.
 ✓ Patient-controlled epidural analgesia 
(PCEA) differs from the continuous infu-
sion method in that you are the one who 
controls the amount of medication given. 
Some anesthesiologists use this technique 
alone, whereas others prefer a combina-
tion of continuous infusion with the patient-
controlled method.
 ✓ Combined spinal-epidural analgesia gives 
a dose in the spinal area for immediate pain 
relief (5 to 10 minutes) and, at the same time, 
places a catheter in the epidural space for 
continuous infusion.
 ✓ Walking epidural describes a technique 
of administering pain relief that does not 
interfere with motor function. The truth is 
that, for various reasons, 40 to 80 percent 
of women don’t actually walk during labor 
anyway!

190
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Considering alternative forms of labor-pain management
Whereas systemic medications or various anes-
thetic techniques are aimed at eliminating the 
physical sensation of pain, alternative or non-
pharmacologic methods are directed toward 
preventing the suffering associated with labor 
pain. These approaches to pain management 
emphasize labor pain as a normal side effect of 
the normal process of labor. Women are given 
reassurance, encouragement, and guidance to 
help them build self-confidence and maintain a 
sense of control and well-being. Many hospitals 
offer some of these techniques, although others 
require special training and may not be avail-
able in all birthing facilities:
 ✓ Continuous labor support: This refers to 
nonmedical care given to a laboring woman, 
often by a doula or trained professional (see 
Chapter 7 for more information).
 ✓ Maternal movement and positioning: 
Sometimes walking or changing positions 
can alleviate some of the pain associated 
with labor. Your caregiver or nurse may 
suggest different positions to try.
 ✓ Touch and massage: These techniques pro-
vide encouragement, reassurance, and a 
sense of love, and may be used to enhance 
relaxation and decrease pain.
 ✓ Acupuncture and acupressure: Acupuncture 
involves the placement of needles at various 
points on the body, whereas acupressure 
(or Shiatsu) refers to the placement of pres-
sure with fingers or small beads at acupunc-
ture points. In some studies, acupuncture use 
during labor was associated with more relax-
ation, but no difference in pain intensity.
 ✓ Hypnosis: Usually hypnosis during labor 
involves self-hypnosis, where the woman 
herself is taught to induce the hypnotic 
state. Studies have shown that the use 
of hypnosis does lead to less use of pain 
medication and epidural anesthesia.
 ✓ Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimu-
lation (TENS): This technique involves the 
transmission of electrical impulses from 
a hand-held generator to the skin through 
surface electrodes. During labor, the elec-
trodes are placed near the spine, and the 
woman controls the intensity of the cur-
rent through a dial. TENS causes a buzz-
ing sensation that may reduce awareness 
of contraction pain. Most studies have not 
shown a real reduction in pain, but some do 
suggest less use of pain medication, and 
increased satisfaction.
 ✓ Intradermal water injections: This tech-
nique involves injecting a small amount 
of sterile water into four locations on the 
lower back. This has been shown to reduce 
severe back pain for 45 to 90 minutes, but it 
does not seem to help the abdominal pain 
associated with labor.
 ✓ Application of heat and cold: Often this is a 
matter of personal preference, as no scien-
tific data suggests that one is better for pain 
relief than the other.
 ✓ Music and audioanalgesia: The idea 
behind this method is that music, white 
noise, or environmental sounds may help to 
decrease the perception of pain. Although 
not clearly beneficial for pain relief, it may 
help to increase pain tolerance via mood 
elevation, or help the woman to breathe 
more rhythmically (heavy metal is probably 
not the best choice, though!).
 ✓ Aromatherapy: The use of aromatherapy 
appears to be on the rise. We could only 
find one study looking at its effectiveness 
for pain relief. In this study, about half of the 
women felt it was helpful in reducing pain, 
anxiety, and nausea, while improving their 
sense of well-being.

191
 Chapter 10: Honey, I Think I’m in Labor!
Considering Alternative 
Birthing Methods
More and more women are expressing interest in nontraditional or alterna-
tive birthing methods, and more and more possibilities are becoming avail-
able. Certainly, the following options aren’t for everyone, but knowing what’s 
possible can be helpful.
Delivering without anesthesia
Natural childbirth usually refers to giving birth without any medications 
or anesthesia. (It’s probably not the best terminology, because using pain 
medication doesn’t make the birthing process unnatural.) The theory behind 
natural birth is that childbirth is an inherently healthy and natural process, 
and that women’s bodies are made to handle childbirth without the need for 
medications.
Natural childbirth allows women to have a great deal of control over the 
childbirth process and their own bodies. It emphasizes having the woman 
choose which positions are comfortable, how mobile she wants to be, and 
which techniques she wants to use to be as comfortable as possible. Natural 
childbirth can be practiced in a hospital setting, birthing center, or even at 
home. Some practitioners aren’t comfortable with every aspect of natural 
childbirth because they don’t want to be limited in doing what they feel is 
medically necessary and important. Discuss with your practitioner what he 
feels comfortable with, so your delivery can be as great an experience as 
possible.
Giving birth at home
Home births are still relatively uncommon in the United States, with less than 
1 percent of women choosing to deliver at home. Still, for some women, a 
home birth provides an ideal environment to deliver their baby. A midwife 
usually attends a home birth, and an obstetrician is on call in case problems 
should arise. Home births are certainly more appropriate for women who 
are at very low risk for complications. Although some studies demonstrate 
that home births are associated with greater risks for both the mother and 
baby, others show that home births are at least as safe as hospital births for 
healthy, low-risk women.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently published 
an official statement opposing home births. Their rationale is that while 
most women experience childbirth without problems, monitoring of both the 

192
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
woman and fetus during labor and delivery in a hospital or accredited birth-
ing center is essential because life-threatening complications can occur with 
little or no warning, even among low-risk pregnancies.
Immersing yourself in a water birth
Water births refer to spending much of labor immersed in water, with the 
option of even delivering the baby in the water. Water births usually take 
place in a birthing center with the help of a midwife, although some hospitals 
may provide birthing pools or baths. The water temperature is kept about 
the same as the body temperature, and the woman’s temperature should be 
monitored throughout labor. Most studies have not found a real decrease in 
pain or in the use of epidural anesthesia. Although some professionals in the 
medical community feel that a water birth is a safe procedure, others have 
more serious concerns about its safety for both the patient and staff.

W
hen you’re nearing the end of the second stage of labor, you’re very 
close to the point of delivery. Now is the time you’ve been waiting 
and preparing yourself for. Keep in mind that you don’t have to worry too 
much ahead of time. You can prepare yourself — by taking childbirth classes 
and by reading this book, for example. And remember that your practitio-
ner and her assistants in the delivery room guide you through the process. 
Accept and rely on their help. Trust in yourself, too, and let this natural pro-
cess move along one step at a time.
Basically, babies are delivered in one of three ways: through the birth canal 
by your pushing, through the birth canal with a little assistance (that is, using 
forceps or a vacuum extractor), or by cesarean delivery. The method that’s 
right for you depends on many different factors, including your medical his-
tory, the baby’s condition, and your pelvis’s size relative to your baby’s size. 
Don’t feel overwhelmed. This chapter gives you the lowdown on all three.
Having a Vaginal Delivery
Most expectant mothers spend a great deal of time during the 40 weeks of 
pregnancy thinking ahead to the actual delivery. If you’re having a baby for 
the first time, it may seem pretty scary. Even if you’ve had a child before, 

194
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
worrying a bit until you see your beautiful baby is normal. A little knowledge 
goes a long way, though, and being informed and prepared for all possibili-
ties is always helpful.
 
The most common method of delivery is, of course, a vaginal delivery. 
(Figure 11-1 gives you an overview of the process.) Most likely, you’ll experi-
ence what doctors call a spontaneous vaginal delivery, which means that it 
occurs as a result of your pushing efforts and proceeds without a great deal 
of intervention. If you do need a little help, it may come in the form of forceps 
or a vacuum extractor. A delivery requiring the use of one of these tools to 
help pull the baby out is called an operative vaginal delivery. We cover both 
courses of events in this chapter.
 
Figure 11-1: 
An overview 
of the deliv-
ery process.
 
a. Dilation of the cervix and breaking of amniotic sac b. Delivery of the head
c. Delivery of the body
d. Delivery of the placenta
During the first stage of labor, your cervix dilates and your membranes rup-
ture. When your cervix is fully dilated (open to 10 centimeters), you reach 
the end of the first stage of labor and are ready to enter the second stage, 
in which you push your baby through the birth canal (vagina) and actually 

195
 Chapter 11: Special Delivery: Bringing Your Baby into the World
deliver it. At the end of the first stage, you may feel an overwhelming sensa-
tion of pressure on your rectum. You may feel as if you need to have a bowel 
movement. This sensation is likely to be greatest during contractions. Your 
baby’s head descending in the birth canal and putting pressure on neighbor-
ing internal organs is causing this sensation.
If you have an epidural (a type of regional anesthesia used to take away the 
pain of labor — see Chapter 10), you may not feel this pressure, or the feel-
ing may be less intense. If you do feel it, let your nurse or practitioner know 
because it’s probably a sign that your cervix is getting close to being fully 
dilated and that it may be time for you to push. Your nurse or doctor per-
forms an internal exam to confirm that your cervix is fully dilated. If it is, she 
tells you to start pushing.
 
Whether your nurse, doctor, or midwife is actually coaching you during 
pushing varies from hospital to hospital and from practitioner to practitio-
ner. The important factor is that someone is with you to help you through 
this stage of labor.
Occasionally, you may be fully dilated when the fetal head is still relatively 
high up in the pelvis. In this case, your practitioner may want you to wait until 
the contractions cause the head to descend more before you start to push.
Pushing the baby out
Pushing generally takes 30 to 90 minutes (though sometimes it takes as long 
as three hours), depending on the baby’s position and size, whether you 
have an epidural, and whether you’ve had children before. (If this isn’t your 
first delivery, your cervix may begin to dilate weeks before your due date, 
and, after you’re fully dilated, you may push only once or twice to deliver!) 
Your nurse or practitioner gives you specific instructions on how to push. 
While you’re pushing, your baby moves farther along its downward course. 
Women often begin pushing as soon as the baby’s head has descended into 
the pelvis. How long you push depends on how far down the head is when 
you start pushing, and how efficient you are at it. Sometimes it takes a while 
to get the hang of it. After you deliver the head, your doctor may tell you to 
stop pushing, so that she can suction some fluid out of the baby’s mouth, 
and also feel to see if the umbilical cord is around the baby’s neck. After that, 
you’ll push one or two more times to delivery the rest of the baby.
You have several possible positions in which to push. Figure 11-2 points out 
three that can help:

196
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
Figure 11-2: 
Positions 
you can 
assume in 
childbirth.
 
Lithotomy position
Knee-chest position
Squatting position
 
✓ Lithotomy position: The most common. In this position, you lean back 
and pull your flexed knees to your chest. At the same time, you bend 
your neck and try to touch your chin to your chest. The idea is to get 
your body to form a C. The position isn’t the most flattering, but it does 
help to align the uterus and pelvis in a position that makes delivery rela-
tively easy.
 
✓ Squatting position: An advantage of squatting is that you have gravity 
working with you. A disadvantage is that you may be too tired to hold 
the position for very long, and any monitoring equipment or an intrave-
nous line you may have can be cumbersome.

197
 Chapter 11: Special Delivery: Bringing Your Baby into the World
 
✓ Knee-chest position: The knee-chest position is one in which you push 
while on all fours. This position is sometimes helpful if the baby’s head 
is rotated in the birth canal in such a way that makes pushing the baby 
out in the lithotomy or squatting positions difficult. The knee-chest 
position may be awkward for some women and difficult to stay in for 
very long.
 
Finding the one position that feels and works best for you may take a bit of 
experimentation. If you find that you’re not making progress, try changing 
positions.
When you start to feel a contraction, your nurse or doctor usually tells you to 
take a deep, cleansing breath. After that, you inhale deeply again, hold in the 
air, and push like crazy. Focus the push toward your rectum and perineum 
(the area between the vagina and the rectum), trying not to tense up the mus-
cles of your vagina or rectum. Push like you’re having a bowel movement. 
Don’t worry or be embarrassed if you pass stool while you’re pushing. (If it 
happens, a nurse quickly cleans the perineum.) It’s the rule rather than the 
exception, and all the people helping to take care of you have seen it many 
times before. In fact, passing stool is a sign that you’re pushing correctly, so 
congratulate yourself. Trying to hold it in only impedes your efforts to push 
the baby out.
Hold each push for about ten seconds. Many nurses count to ten or ask 
your coach to count to ten to help you judge the time. After the count of 
ten, quickly release the breath you have been holding, take in another deep 
breath, and push again for another ten seconds, exactly as before. You usu-
ally push about three times with each contraction, depending on the length 
of the contraction.
Between contractions, try your best to relax and rest so that you can get 
ready for the next one. If it’s okay with your practitioner, your coach may 
give you some ice chips or pat your forehead with a damp, cool cloth.
To watch or not to watch
Some partners want to see everything that’s 
happening during childbirth; others feel 
uncomfortable even being in the delivery room. 
Likewise, some women want their partners to 
witness everything, and others prefer that their 
partners not see them in this situation.
However you feel about it, communicate your 
feelings to your partner so that you can make 
each other feel as comfortable as possible. The 
last thing you need is for you or your partner to 
be embarrassed during a time that should be 
one of joy and happiness.

198
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
After your baby gets far enough down the birth canal, the top of the head 
becomes visible during your pushing efforts. This first glimpse is called 
crowning because your practitioner can see the crown of the baby’s head. 
Some labor rooms have mirrors so that you, too, can see the head crowning, 
but many women have no desire to look. (Don’t feel bad or somehow inad-
equate if you don’t want to — you’re busy enough.) After the contraction, the 
baby’s head may again disappear back up into the birth canal. This retraction 
is normal. With each push, the baby comes down a little farther and recedes 
a little less afterward.
Getting an episiotomy
Just before birth, the baby’s head distends the perineum (the area between 
the vagina and the rectum) and stretches the skin around the vagina. As 
the baby’s head comes through the vagina’s opening, it may tear the tis-
sues in the back, or posterior, part of the vaginal opening, sometimes even 
to the point that the tear extends into the rectum. To minimize tearing of 
the surrounding skin and perineal muscles, your practitioner may make an 
episiotomy — a cut in the posterior part of the vaginal opening large enough 
to allow the baby’s head to come through with minimal tearing or to provide 
extra room for delivery. Although an episiotomy may decrease the likelihood 
of a severe tear, it doesn’t guarantee that you won’t get one (that is, the cut 
made for the episiotomy may tear open even further as the baby’s head or 
shoulders are delivered).
Your practitioner doesn’t know whether you need an episiotomy until the 
head is almost out. Some doctors routinely make an episiotomy, and others 
wait to see whether it’s definitely necessary. Episiotomies are more common 
in women having their first baby than in those who have delivered before 
because the perineum stretches more easily after a previous birth. Tell your 
practitioner if you have strong wishes regarding receiving an episiotomy. 
Keep in mind though, that some natural tears can be worse than an epi-
siotomy.
The type of episiotomy made may depend on your body, on the position 
of the baby’s head, or on your practitioner’s judgment. Practitioners can 
choose from two main types of episiotomies:
 
✓ Median: Straight down from the vagina toward the anus
 
✓ Mediolateral: Angled away from the anus

199
 Chapter 11: Special Delivery: Bringing Your Baby into the World
A local anesthetic can numb the area if you haven’t had an epidural.
A median episiotomy may be less uncomfortable later on, and it may heal 
more easily. (See Chapter 13 for more coverage of the care and healing of an 
episiotomy.) However, a median episiotomy has a slightly greater chance of 
extending to the rectum. A mediolateral episiotomy, on the other hand, may 
be more uncomfortable, but it has less chance of extending to the rectum 
when the baby’s head passes through.
Most tears or lacerations that occur during delivery are in the perineum or 
are extensions of an episiotomy, which is also in that area. Occasionally, 
especially when the baby is exceptionally large or you have an operative 
vaginal delivery, lacerations can occur in other areas, such as the cervix, on 
the vagina’s walls, the labia, or the tissue around the urethra. Your practitio-
ner examines the birth canal carefully after delivery and sews up any lacera-
tions that need to be repaired. These lacerations usually heal very quickly 
and almost never cause long-term problems. Don’t worry about having the 
stitches removed — most doctors use the type of sutures that dissolve on 
their own.
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “Do I really need an episiotomy?”
A: The answer to this question depends on 
many factors, including the point of view of 
your practitioner. It’s an issue of frequent 
debate among people who deliver babies. And, 
as you may already know, it’s also a big topic 
of discussion among pregnant women. Many 
practitioners believe that repairing a controlled 
cut in the perineum is easier than repairing any 
uncontrolled tear through the skin and perineal 
muscles that may occur without an episiotomy. 
The same people usually contend that episioto-
mies heal better, too. Although a doctor may see 
the layers of tissue in a cut better than in a tear, 
medical professionals aren’t sure that makes 
any major difference. Compounding the issue 
is the fact that it’s difficult to tell before labor 
whether the patient will need an episiotomy.
During delivery, the baby’s head stretches the 
vagina’s opening when the mother pushes. 
Sometimes the birth canal stretches enough 
that the baby’s head doesn’t need the extra 
room that an episiotomy provides. Then again, 
sometimes it doesn’t. If you can “hold” the head 
at the perineum to let additional stretching 
occur, you may help matters. But holding the 
head there is easier said than done because 
of the incredible pressure that the baby’s head 
exerts. One potential advantage of epidurals is 
that they allow for a slower delivery of the head 
and therefore reduce the chances that you’ll 
need an episiotomy.

If you’re having your first child and you remain in the second stage of labor 
for more than two hours (or three hours if you have an epidural), the labor 
is considered prolonged. If you’re having your second or subsequent child, a 
second stage nearing one hour (or two hours if you have an epidural) is also 
considered prolonged.
A prolonged second stage may be due to inadequate contractions or to 
cephalopelvic disproportion, which is a poor fit between the baby’s head and 
the mother’s birth canal (see Chapter 10). Sometimes, the baby’s head is in 
a position that blocks further descent. Oxytocin (Pitocin) may help, or your 
practitioner may try to rotate the baby’s head. You may also try changing 
your position to push more effectively. Sometimes forceps do the trick (see 
“Assisting Nature: Operative Vaginal Delivery,” later in this chapter), if the 
baby’s head is low enough in the birth canal. If all else fails, your doctor may 
recommend a cesarean delivery.
The big moment: Delivering your baby
When the baby’s head remains visible between contractions, your nurse 
helps get you into position to deliver. If you’re laboring in a birthing room, 
all she needs to do is to remove the platform at the foot of your bed and set 
up padded leg supports. If you need to be moved to a delivery room (more 
like an operating room), your nurse moves you and all your monitors to a 
stretcher. Whether you deliver in a birthing room or a delivery room depends 
both on the facility where you have your baby and on any risk factors you 
may have.
After you’re in position to deliver, you still have to keep pushing with each of 
your contractions. Your doctor or nurse cleans your perineum, usually with 
an iodine solution, and places drapes over your legs to keep the area as clean 
as possible for the newborn. As you’re pushing, your perineum is getting 
more and more stretched out. Whether you need an episiotomy is usually 
determined in these final moments.
With each push, the baby’s head descends farther and farther until finally it 
comes out of the birth canal. After the baby’s head delivers, your practitioner 
tells you to stop pushing so that she can suction secretions from the baby’s 
mouth and nose before the rest of the body comes out.
 
To stop pushing at this point can be difficult because of the intense pressure 
in your perineal area; panting may make it a little easier not to push. If you 
have an epidural, you may not feel this intense pressure.

201
 Chapter 11: Special Delivery: Bringing Your Baby into the World
Your practitioner also checks at this point to see whether the umbilical cord 
is wrapped around the baby’s neck. A nuchal cord, as it’s called, is actually 
quite common and very rarely a cause for worry. Your practitioner simply 
removes the loop from around the baby’s neck before delivering the rest of 
the baby.
Finally, your practitioner instructs you to push again to deliver the baby’s 
body. Because the head is typically the widest part, delivery of the body is 
usually easier. After your baby has made it fully into the world, her mouth 
and nose are suctioned again.
Normally, after the baby’s head delivers, the shoulders and body follow 
easily. Occasionally, though, the baby’s shoulders may be stuck behind the 
mother’s pubic bone, which makes delivery of the rest of the baby more dif-
ficult. This situation is known as shoulder dystocia. If you have this problem, 
your practitioner can perform various maneuvers designed to dislodge the 
shoulders and deliver the baby. These methods include
 
✓ Applying pressure directly above your pubic bone to push away the 
entrapped shoulder
 
✓ Flexing your knees back to allow more room for delivery
 
✓ Rotating the baby’s shoulders manually
 
✓ Delivering the posterior arm of the baby first
Although shoulder dystocia can occur in women with no risk factors, certain 
characteristics make this condition more likely:
 
✓ Very large babies
 
✓ Gestational diabetes
 
✓ Prolonged labor
 
✓ A history of large babies or babies with shoulder dystocia
Delivering the placenta
After the baby is born, the third stage of delivery begins — the delivery of the 
placenta, also known as the afterbirth (refer to Figure 11-1). This stage lasts 
only about 5 to 15 minutes. You still have contractions, but they’re much 
less intense. These contractions help separate the placenta from the uterus’s 
wall. After this separation occurs and the placenta reaches the vagina’s 
opening, your practitioner may ask you to give one more gentle push. Many 
women, exhilarated by and exhausted from the delivery, pay little attention 
to this part of the process and later on don’t even remember it.

202
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Repairing your perineum
After the placenta is out, your practitioner inspects your cervix, vagina, and 
perineum (the area between the vagina and rectum) for tears or damage and 
then repairs (with stitches) the episiotomy or any tears. (If you didn’t have 
an epidural and you have sensation in your perineum, your practitioner may 
use a local anesthetic to numb the area before repairing it.)
After the practitioner finishes with the repairs, a nurse cleans your perineal 
area, removes your legs from the leg supports, and gives you warm blankets. 
You may also continue to feel mild contractions; these contractions are 
normal and actually help to minimize bleeding.
Assisting Nature: Operative 
Vaginal Delivery
If the baby’s head is low enough in the birth canal and your practitioner feels 
that the baby needs to be delivered immediately or that you can’t deliver 
the baby vaginally without some added help, she may recommend the use 
of forceps or a vacuum extractor to assist. Using either of these instruments 
is called an operative vaginal delivery. Such a delivery may be appropriate to 
use when
 
✓ You’ve pushed for a long time, and you’re too tired to continue pushing 
hard enough to deliver.
 
✓ You’ve pushed for some time, and your practitioner thinks you won’t 
deliver vaginally unless you have this type of help.
 
✓ The baby’s heart rate pattern indicates a need to deliver the baby quickly.
 
✓ The baby’s position is making it very difficult for you to push it out on 
your own.
Figure 11-3 shows forceps, two smooth, curved, spatula-like instruments that 
are placed on the sides of the baby’s head to help guide it through the outer 
part of the birth canal. The vacuum extractor is a suction cup that is placed 
on the top of the baby’s head, to which suction is applied to allow your prac-
titioner to gently pull the baby through the birth canal.
Both techniques are safe for you and the baby if the baby is far enough 
down in the birth canal and the instruments are used appropriately. In fact, 
these techniques can often help women avoid cesarean delivery (but not 
always — see the next section). The decision to use forceps or a vacuum 
extractor often depends upon your practitioner’s judgment and experience 
and the baby’s position and station.

If you haven’t had an epidural, you may need extra local anesthesia for a 
forceps or vacuum delivery, and most practitioners perform an episiotomy 
to make extra room. After the forceps or vacuum is applied, the practitioner 
asks you to continue to push until the head emerges. The forceps or vacuum 
extractor is then removed, and the rest of the baby is delivered with your 
pushing.
If forceps are used, very often, the baby is born with marks on her head 
where the forceps were applied. If this happens to your baby, remember 
that it’s quite typical, and the marks disappear within a few days. A vacuum 
extractor may cause the baby to be born with a round, raised area on the top 
of the head where the extractor was applied. This mark, too, goes away in a 
few days.
Having a Cesarean Delivery
Many patients wonder whether they’ll need a cesarean. Sometimes your 
doctor knows the answer before labor even begins — if you have placenta 
previa (see Chapter 16), for example, or if the baby is in a transverse lie (that 
is, the baby is lying sideways within the uterus rather than head-down). But 
most of the time, neither you nor your doctor can know whether you’ll need 
a cesarean until you see how your labor progresses and how your baby toler-
ates labor.

204
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Because a cesarean is a surgical procedure, a doctor performs a cesarean 
delivery in an operating room under sterile conditions. A nurse inserts an 
intravenous line in the patient’s arm and a catheter in the bladder. After a 
nurse or nurse’s assistant scrubs the patient’s abdomen with antiseptic solu-
tion, a nurse places sterile sheets over the patient’s belly. One of the sheets 
is elevated to create a screen so that the expectant parents don’t have to 
watch the procedure. (Although childbirth is usually an experience shared by 
both parents, a cesarean delivery is still a surgical operation. Most doctors 
feel that the procedure isn’t something that expectant parents should watch 
because it involves scalpels, bleeding, and exposure of internal body tissue 
that’s normally not seen, which is disturbing to many people.)
Many hospitals allow the coach or partner to stay in the operating room 
during a cesarean delivery, but this decision depends on the nature of the 
delivery and on hospital policy. If the cesarean is an emergency, the doc-
tors and nurses are moving quickly to ensure the safety of both the mother 
and the baby, which may make it necessary for the partner or coach to wait 
elsewhere.
The exact place on the woman’s abdomen where the incision is made 
depends on the reason she’s having the cesarean. Most often, it is low, just 
above the pubic bone, in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the torso). 
This cut is known as a Pfannensteil incision or, more commonly, a bikini cut. 
Less often, the incision is vertical, along the midline of the abdomen.
 
After the doctor makes the skin incision, she separates the abdominal muscles 
and opens the inner lining of the abdominal cavity, also called the peritoneal 
cavity, to expose the uterus. She then makes an incision in the uterus itself, 
through which the infant and placenta are delivered. The incision in the 
uterus can also be either transverse (most common) or vertical (sometimes 
called a classical incision), depending again on the reason for the cesarean and 
previous abdominal surgery. After delivery, the uterus and abdominal wall are 
closed with sutures, layer by layer. A cesarean delivery takes 30 to 90 minutes 
to perform.
Understanding anesthesia
The most common forms of anesthesia used for cesarean deliveries are 
epidural and spinal. (See Chapter 10 for more information on anesthesia.) 
Both kinds of anesthesia numb you from mid-chest to toes but also allow 
you to remain awake so that you can experience your child’s birth. You may 
feel some tugging and pulling during the operation, but you don’t feel pain. 
Sometimes the anesthesiologist injects a slow-release pain medication into 
the epidural or spinal catheter before removing it in order to prevent or 
greatly minimize pain after the operation.

205
 Chapter 11: Special Delivery: Bringing Your Baby into the World
If the baby has to be delivered in an emergency and there’s no time to place 
an epidural or spinal, general anesthesia may be needed. In that case, you’re 
asleep during the cesarean and totally unaware of the procedure. Also, gen-
eral anesthesia may be needed in some cases because of complications in 
pregnancy that make it unwise to place epidurals or spinals.
Looking at reasons for cesarean delivery
The reasons your doctor may perform a cesarean delivery are many (see the 
list later in this section), but all are about delivering the infant in the safest, 
healthiest way possible while also maintaining the mother’s well-being. A 
cesarean delivery can be either planned ahead of labor (elective), unplanned 
during labor (when the doctor determines that delivering the baby vaginally 
isn’t safe), or done as an emergency (if the mother’s or the baby’s health is in 
immediate jeopardy).

If your practitioner feels that you need a cesarean delivery, she will discuss 
with you why it is needed. If your cesarean is elective or proposed because 
your labor isn’t progressing normally, you and your partner have time to ask 
questions. In cases in which the baby is in a breech position, you and your 
practitioner may consider together the pros and cons of having either an 
elective cesarean delivery or a vaginal breech delivery (see Chapter 16). Both 
Uncovering cesarean’s roots
Cesarean delivery, in which the baby is born 
through an incision in the mother’s abdomen, 
is hardly a new medical innovation. Cases 
have been documented since the beginning of 
recorded history. In fact, many famous works of 
medieval and Renaissance art depict abdomi-
nal deliveries.
The origin of the term cesarean section is a 
subject of some controversy. Julius Caesar, it 
turns out, probably wasn’t delivered this way, 
according to Cesarean Delivery, a history 
written by physicians Steve Clark and Jeffrey 
Phelan (published by Chapman & Hall). In those 
days, it was rare for the mother to survive the 
procedure. Yet Caesar’s mother survived her 
delivery and was depicted in Renaissance art 
that recounted the life of Caesar as an adult.
One theory is that the name comes from the 
Lex Cesare, the laws of the ancient Roman 
emperors. One of those laws mandated that 
any woman who died while she was pregnant 
be delivered by an abdominal incision so that 
the infant could be baptized. This rule later 
became canon law of the Catholic church. A 
third possible explanation for the term cesar-
ean is its relationship to the Latin term cadere, 
which means to cut. The term section also 
implies surgical cutting, so if cadere is indeed 
the origin of cesarean, then cesarean section 
is redundant. In modern obstetrics, we prefer 
the phrase cesarean delivery or cesarean birth. 
Still, many people continue to call the operation 
a cesarean section or C-section.

206
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
carry some risks, and often your practitioner asks you which risks are most 
acceptable to you. If the decision to perform a cesarean is due to a last-minute 
emergency, the discussion between you and your doctor may happen quickly, 
while you’re being wheeled to the operating room.
 
If things seem hurried or rushed when you’re on your way to the operating 
room for an emergency cesarean, don’t panic. Doctors and nurses are trained 
to handle these kinds of emergencies.
Your practitioner may suggest that you have a cesarean delivery for one of 
many different reasons. This list describes the most common ones.
Reasons for elective, or planned, cesarean delivery:
 
✓ The baby is in an abnormal position (breech or transverse).
 
✓ Placenta previa (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ You’ve had extensive prior surgery on the uterus, including previous 
cesarean deliveries or removal of uterine fibroids. (See Chapter 15 for 
more information on vaginal births after cesarean delivery.)
 
✓ Delivery of triplets or more.
Reasons for unplanned but nonemergency cesarean delivery:
 
✓ The baby is too large in relation to the woman’s pelvis to be delivered 
safely through the vagina — a condition known as cephalopelvic dispro-
portion (CPD) — or the position of the baby’s head makes vaginal deliv-
ery unlikely.
 
✓ Signs indicate that the baby isn’t tolerating labor.
 
✓ Maternal medical conditions preclude safe vaginal delivery, such as 
severe cardiac disease.
 
✓ Normal labor comes to a standstill.
Reasons for emergency cesarean delivery:
 
✓ Bleeding is excessive.
 
✓ The baby’s umbilical cord pushes through the cervix when the mem-
branes rupture.
 
✓ Prolonged slowing of the baby’s heart rate.
Other than the fact that the baby and placenta are delivered through an inci-
sion in the uterus rather than through the vagina, for the baby, there’s not 
much difference between cesarean and vaginal delivery. Babies delivered by 
a cesarean before labor usually don’t have the coneheads, but they may if 
you’re in labor for a long time before having a cesarean. (For more on cone-
heads, see Chapter 12.)

207
 Chapter 11: Special Delivery: Bringing Your Baby into the World
 
Women who have labored for a long time only to find that they need a cesar-
ean delivery are sometimes, understandably, disappointed. This reaction is 
natural. If it happens to you, keep in mind that what is ultimately most impor-
tant is your safety and your baby’s safety. Having a cesarean delivery doesn’t 
mean that you are a failure in any way or that you didn’t try hard enough. 
Roughly 20 to 30 percent of women need a cesarean delivery for a variety of 
reasons. Practitioners stick to basic guidelines when monitoring progress 
through labor, and those guidelines are all about giving you and your baby the 
best chance for a normal, healthy outcome.
All surgical procedures involve risks, and cesarean delivery is no exception. 
Fortunately, these problems aren’t common. The main risks of cesarean 
delivery are
 
✓ Excessive bleeding, rarely to the point of needing a blood transfusion
 
✓ Development of an infection in the uterus, bladder, or skin incision
 
✓ Injury to the bladder, bowel, or adjacent organs
 
✓ Development of blood clots in the legs or pelvis after the operation
Recovering from a cesarean delivery
After the surgery is finished, you’re taken to a recovery area, where you stay 
for a few hours until the hospital staff can make sure that your condition is 
stable. Often, you can see and hold your baby during this time.
The recovery time from a cesarean delivery is usually longer than from a vag-
inal delivery because the procedure is a surgical one. Typically, you stay in 
the hospital for two to four days — sometimes longer, if complications arise. 
Check out Chapter 13 for details about recovering from a cesarean delivery.
Debunking cesarean rates
Some women choose their practitioner or the 
hospital where they’re going to deliver based 
on the number of cesarean deliveries (as a 
percentage of total deliveries) that the practi-
tioner, group, or hospital has done. That number 
is meaningless, however, unless you also know 
the demographics of the practice or hospital. For 
example, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist 
who predominantly cares for older women, 
women with many medical problems, or women 
carrying twins or more is expected to have a 
higher cesarean rate than a doctor or midwife 
who takes care of young, healthy women. The 
important issue isn’t the cesarean delivery 
rate, but whether the cesareans were done for 
appropriate reasons.

Congratulations! You Did It!
Women may experience any and every kind of emotion after their babies are 
born. The spectrum of feelings is truly infinite. Most of the time, you’re com-
pletely overcome with joy when your long-awaited baby finally is born. You 
may be incredibly relieved to see that your baby appears healthy and obvi-
ously okay. If your baby requires extra medical attention for some reason and 
you can’t hold her right away, you may be upset or, at the very least, disap-
pointed. Just remember that very soon you’ll have her to hold and enjoy for 
the rest of your life. Some women feel too scared or overwhelmed to care for 
their baby right away. Don’t feel guilty about any such feelings — they, and 
most others, are completely normal. Just take one moment at a time. You’ve 
come through a phenomenal event.
Shaking after delivery
Almost immediately after delivery, most women start to shake uncontrolla-
bly. Your partner may think that you’re cold and offer you a blanket. Blankets 
do help some women, but you aren’t shivering because you’re cold. The 
cause of this phenomenon is unclear, but it’s nearly universal — even among 
women who have cesarean deliveries. Some women feel nervous about hold-
ing their babies because they’re shaking so much. If you feel this way, let 
your partner or your nurse hold your baby until you feel up to it.

Don’t be concerned at all about this shaking. It usually goes away within a few 
hours after delivery.
Understanding postpartum bleeding
After delivery — either vaginal or cesarean — your uterus begins to contract 
in order to squeeze the blood vessels closed and thus slow down bleeding. 
If the uterus doesn’t contract normally, excessive bleeding may occur. This 
condition is known as uterine atony. It can happen when you have multiple 
babies (twins or more), if you have some infection in the uterus, or if some 
placental tissue remains inside the uterus after the placenta is delivered. 
Then again, in some cases, excessive bleeding happens for no apparent 
cause. If it happens to you, your doctor or nurse may first massage your 
uterus to get it to contract. If massage doesn’t solve the problem, you may 
be given one of several medications that promote contracting, like oxytocin, 
methergine, or hemabate.

209
 Chapter 11: Special Delivery: Bringing Your Baby into the World
If you have some placental material remaining in your uterus, it may need to 
be removed by reaching inside the uterus or by a D&C (dilation and curet-
tage), which involves scraping the uterus’s lining with an instrument. The 
vast majority of the time, the bleeding stops without a problem. However, if 
it doesn’t stop with these medications and procedures, your doctor will dis-
cuss other forms of treatment with you.
Hearing your baby’s first cry
Shortly after delivery, your baby takes its first breath and begins to cry. This 
crying is what expands your baby’s lungs and helps clear deeper secretions. 
In contrast to stereotype, most practitioners don’t spank a baby after it’s 
born, but instead use some other method to stimulate crying and breathing — 
rubbing the baby’s back vigorously, for example, or tapping the bottom of 
the feet. Don’t be surprised if your baby doesn’t cry the very second after 
it’s born. Often, several seconds, if not minutes, pass before the baby starts 
making that lovely sound!
Checking your baby’s condition
All babies are evaluated by the Apgar score, named for Dr. Virginia Apgar, 
who devised it in 1952. This score is a useful way of quickly assessing the 
baby’s initial condition to see whether she needs special medical attention. 
Five factors are measured: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, pres-
ence of reflexes, and color, each of which can be given a score of 0, 1, or 2, 
with 2 being the highest score. The Apgar scores are calculated at both one 
and five minutes. An Apgar score of 6 or above is perfectly fine. Because 
some of the characteristics are partially dependent on the infant’s gestational 
age, premature babies frequently get lower scores. Factors such as maternal 
sedation also can affect a baby’s score.
Many new parents anxiously await the results of their child’s Apgar score. 
In fact, an Apgar score taken one minute after the baby is born indicates 
whether the baby needs some resuscitative measures but is not useful in pre-
dicting long-term health. An Apgar score taken five minutes later can indicate 
whether resuscitative measures have been effective. Occasionally, a very 
low five-minute Apgar score may reflect decreased oxygenation to the baby, 
but it correlates poorly with future health. The purpose of the Apgar score 
is merely to help your doctor or pediatrician identify babies who may need a 
little extra attention in the very early newborn period. It certainly is no indi-
cation of whether your baby will get into Harvard or Yale.

Cutting the cord
After the baby is actually delivered, the next step is to clamp and cut the 
umbilical cord. Some practitioners may offer your labor coach the oppor-
tunity to cut the cord — but your partner is under no obligation to do so. If 
having the opportunity to cut the cord is something you feel strongly about, 
let your practitioner know ahead of time.
After cutting the cord, your practitioner either lays your baby on your abdo-
men or gives the baby to your labor nurse to put under an infant warmer. 
The choice depends on your baby’s condition, your doctor’s or nurse’s stan-
dard practice, and on the institutional policy where you’re delivering. (See 
more on newborn care in Chapter 12.)

▶ Examining your newborn’s appearance

F
or almost 40 weeks, you and your baby have been in one body, and if 
you’re like most women, you’ve focused on staying healthy to help your 
baby grow — and on preparing to deliver your baby safely. Now suddenly, 
your baby is out in the world, and you finally get to take your first real look 
at him. You may find that in some ways, your baby’s appearance surprises 
you. Newborns typically look a little funny. Remember that many superficial 
aspects of your baby’s appearance — the cone-shaped head, the blotches, 
and especially the white, pasty goo — will soon disappear.
In this chapter, we give you an idea of what to expect when you first meet 
your little darling. We also explain the role of the hospital and the pediatri-
cian who visits your baby in the first hours or days.
Looking at Your Bundle of Joy
Immediately after delivery, your practitioner puts your baby on your belly 
or hands him over to a nurse for some judicious cleansing and toweling off 
before putting the baby in your arms.
In the first moments after your baby is born, you may be overwhelmed by 
feelings of love. The shock and relief of it all may daze you. Most likely, 
you also think that your baby is the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen. 
Then again, maybe you don’t. Contrary to the fairy tales you see on TV soap 
operas, I Love Lucy reruns, and cartoons, babies don’t always come out clean 
and smelling like a spring shower. Your baby is far more likely to be covered 
with some of your blood, amniotic fluid, and white goo known as vernix. His 
skin may be blotchy, and your baby may even have a few bruises from deliv-
ery. So you may need to keep an open mind when assessing his appearance 
right off the bat.

212
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
Feeling a little hesitant at first or overwhelmed at the sight of your new baby 
actually isn’t uncommon. Often it takes a few days before you establish a true 
connection or bond with your baby. If you’re feeling a little detached, don’t 
worry. As reality sets in and you get to know your baby, you feel much better.
You notice many other features about your new baby’s appearance — from 
his little stump of an umbilical cord to the amazingly long fingernails and toe-
nails. And you observe his first behaviors — from the initial cry to the way 
he startles at loud noises. In this section, we go over many of your newborn’s 
characteristics.
Varnished in vernix
A thick, white, waxy substance typically covers a newborn baby from head 
to toe. The formal name for this substance is vernix caseosa, a phrase with 
Latin roots meaning “cheesy varnish.” Vernix is a mixture of cells that have 
sloughed off from the outer layer of the baby’s skin and of debris from the 
amniotic fluid.
Experts have several theories about this substance. Some doctors believe 
that vernix acts as an emollient to protect the tender fetal skin from the dry-
ness that may result from living within a bag of amniotic fluid. Others believe 
that the vernix acts as a lubricant to help the baby slide through the birth 
canal. Some babies have more vernix than others; some have none at all. 
The amount isn’t significant. If your baby passed meconium while inside the 
uterus (see Chapter 7), the vernix may look a little greenish.
Regardless of what it looks like, most of the vernix usually comes off when 
the nurses dry off your baby. There’s no reason to leave the vernix on the 
baby’s skin. Any vernix that doesn’t come off in the drying process is usually 
absorbed within the first 24 hours.
The shape of the head
Caput succedaneum — more commonly called caput — refers to a circular 
area of swelling on the baby’s head, located at the spot that pushed against 
the cervix’s opening during delivery. The exact location of the swelling varies, 
depending on the position that the baby’s head was in. The swollen area can 
range in size from only a few millimeters in diameter to several centimeters (a 
few inches). Caput generally goes kaput within 24 to 48 hours after birth.
Babies who are born headfirst (vertex) often go through a process known 
as molding. This molding occurs because throughout labor, as the baby 
descends gradually through the birth canal, he “fits” his way along (see

 Chapter 12: Hello, World! Your Newborn
Figure 12-1). In fact, sometimes your practitioner may tell you that he can feel 
the baby’s head molding to the canal even before the baby is born. Molding 
doesn’t cause any harm. The bones and soft tissues in the baby’s head are 
designed to allow this molding to happen. The result is often a baby with a 
cone-shaped head (see Figure 12-2). By 24 hours after delivery, the molding 
usually disappears, and the baby’s head appears round and smooth.

Some women, particularly those who have had children before or who had 
rapid labor, have babies with no molding. Also, babies born in the breech 
presentation or by cesarean may not have molding.
Sometimes, during the passage through the birth canal, a baby’s ears can 
also fold down into strange positions. The same thing can happen with the 
baby’s nose, so that at first, it may appear asymmetric, or pushed to one 
side, but these features are no reason to rush your baby to a plastic surgeon. 
These minor oddities are temporary and disappear during the first few days.

Quite often, babies are born with black-and-blue marks on their heads from 
the labor and delivery process. These marks usually happen because the 
forces of labor put so much pressure on the baby’s scalp, or as a result of a 
forceps or vacuum delivery. A bruise doesn’t indicate that anything harmful 
has occurred; it’s merely a reflection of how vigorous the labor process can 
be. Most black-and-blue marks go away within the first few days of life.
Blotches, patches, and more
Most people think of newborn skin as blemish-free — the very definition of 
perfection, but newborns have all kinds of spots and markings — most of 
which disappear within a matter of days or weeks. Some of the most common 
newborn skin conditions include
 
✓ Dry skin: Some babies, particularly those who are born late, have 
an outer layer of skin that looks shriveled like a raisin and peels off 
easily shortly after birth. You can use lotion or baby oil, if needed, as 
a moisturizer.
 
✓ Hemangiomas: A type of reddish spot, known as a hemangioma, may not 
appear until a week or so after delivery. It can be almost any size, large 
or small, and can occur anywhere on the infant’s body. Although the 
majority of these spots go away in early childhood, some persist. You 
can treat the spots that become bothersome (because of their appear-
ance). Discuss treatment options, if needed, with your pediatrician.
 
✓ Mongolian spots: Bluish-gray patches of skin on the lower back, but-
tocks, and thighs are especially common in Asian, Southern European, 
and African-American infants. These patches are sometimes called mon-
golian spots. They often disappear in early childhood.

 Chapter 12: Hello, World! Your Newborn
 
✓ Neonatal acne: Some babies are born with tiny white or red pimples 
around the nose, lips, and cheeks, and some develop them weeks or 
months later. These bumps are completely normal and are sometimes 
called neonatal acne or milia. No need to rush to the dermatologist, 
though. The little bumps disappear in time.
 
✓ Red spots: Reddish discoloration on the skin, whether very deep and 
dark or light and hardly noticeable, is very common in newborns. Most 
of these discolorations go away or fade, but some may persist as birth-
marks. One type in particular, erythema taxicum, can be extensive. It 
looks like bad hives, and it comes and goes over the baby’s first few 
days of life.
 
✓ Stork bites: You may notice small ruptured blood vessels around your 
baby’s nose and eyes or on the back of the neck. These marks are 
commonly known as stork bites and angel kisses. They’re common in 
newborns, and they also disappear after a while, although it sometimes 
takes weeks or months.
Baby hair
Some babies enter the world totally bald, whereas others come out looking 
like they need a haircut. The amount of hair present at birth doesn’t neces-
sarily predict what the baby’s hair will look like later on. Most often, newborn 
hair thins out and is replaced by new hair. Different babies grow hair at dif-
ferent rates; some have relatively little hair even at a year of age, whereas 
others already need a trip to the beauty salon.

Often, a soft, fine layer of dark hair, which can be especially prominent on 
the forehead, shoulders, and back, covers babies’ bodies. This hair is called 
lanugo, and like so many aspects of a newborn’s appearance, is quite normal. 
Lanugo is most common in preterm babies and in infants of mothers who have 
diabetes. It falls out within several weeks of life.
Extremities
Newborn babies often assume a position similar to the one that they became 
familiar with inside the uterus, the so-called fetal position. You may notice 
that your baby likes to be curled up a bit, with his arms and legs bent and 
fingers balled into a fist.
Watch out for those nails, though! Newborn fingernails and toenails may be 
surprisingly long and sharp. Many hospitals dress newborn babies in little 
shirts with mitten-like attachments to cover the hands so that the babies can’t 
scratch themselves. To minimize this risk, keep the nails relatively short. Pick 
up a pair of baby nail scissors or clippers from your local drugstore.

216
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
A good time to trim fingernails and toenails is when your baby is fast asleep 
and oblivious to what you’re doing.
Eyes and ears
At birth, a baby’s vision is quite limited. Newborns can see only objects that 
are close-up and see things best at a distance of about 7 to 8 inches away. 
They also respond to light and appear to be interested in bright objects.
All newborn babies have dark blue or brown eyes, regardless of what color 
eyes the parents have. By the age of 4 months, baby eye color changes to the 
permanent hue. Right after birth, the whites of your baby’s eyes may have a 
bluish tint. This tint is normal and disappears in time.
Often, a newborn’s eyes may appear a little swollen or puffy. The whole deliv-
ery process causes this puffiness; it’s perfectly normal, and it quickly sub-
sides. Some puffiness may also be due to antibiotic put in the eyes after birth 
(see the section “Caring for your baby’s eyes” later in this chapter).
Babies are fully able to hear from the moment they’re born, which is why you 
may notice that your baby reacts with a startled motion to loud or sudden 
noises. Newborns also can distinguish various tastes and smells.
Genitalia and breasts

Babies are often born with a swollen or puffy scrotum or labia. The breasts 
also may appear slightly enlarged. Maternal hormones that cross the placenta 
cause this swelling. Sometimes, high maternal hormone levels may even cause 
the baby to secrete whitish or pinkish discharge from the breasts (known as 
witch’s milk) or from the vagina (like a period) in female babies. Like so many 
newborn characteristics, these secretions are both normal and transient; they 
go away within a few weeks after birth.
Umbilical cord
The stump of your baby’s umbilical cord probably has a little piece of plastic 
attached to it. After delivery, your practitioner closes the cord with a small 
plastic clamp and then cuts it. Usually, your practitioner removes this clamp 
before you take the baby home. Then the umbilical cord stump quickly dries 
up and shrivels so that it looks like a hard, dark cord. Within one to three 
weeks, the stump usually falls off. Don’t try to pull it off.

217
 Chapter 12: Hello, World! Your Newborn
 
To keep the stump clean, you can dip a cotton swab in water, alcohol, or 
peroxide and clean around the base. However, some pediatricians think this 
cleaning is unnecessary — unless a lot of goopy stuff is around the base.
Newborn size
In general, newborn babies weigh anywhere from about 6 to 8 pounds (about 
2,700 to 3,600 grams) and measure 18 to 22 inches (46 to 56 centimeters) 
long. The exact size depends on the baby’s gestational age (the number 
of weeks the pregnancy lasted), genetics, and many other factors, such as 
whether the mother had diabetes, whether she smoked, and how healthy her 
diet was during pregnancy.

You may notice that your baby’s head seems disproportionately large com-
pared to his body. This feature is true of all newborns. Your baby can’t hold 
up his head and needs time to develop muscles strong enough to hold it up 
without assistance. You also may notice soft spots on the back and top of your 
baby’s head. These are fontanelles, areas where the baby’s skull bones meet. 
Fontanelles allow for the rapid growth of the baby’s brain. The back spot (pos-
terior fontanelle) usually closes within a few months, but the anterior or top 
fontanelle (the one most typically called the soft spot) usually remains until 
the baby is 10 months to 1 year old.
Seeing how your baby breathes
Often, the baby starts to cry spontaneously shortly after delivery, but not 
every baby cries right away. A full-throated cry is music to the ears of every-
one on the hospital staff because they know that the cry triggers the baby’s 
first breathing efforts. Healthy breathing can begin without a loud cry, how-
ever, and some babies give only a little whimper. Some babies have normal 
respiration even if they don’t wail at high decibels.
If your baby is slow to start breathing spontaneously, you may notice the 
doctor, nurse, or midwife stimulating your baby by rubbing his back, drying 
him off, or tapping his feet. Contrary to the stereotype portrayed in old 
movies, your practitioner is unlikely to turn your baby upside down and give 
him a little spank on the behind to elicit that first cry.
During pregnancy, a fetus receives oxygen through the placenta. After deliv-
ery, the baby takes over respiratory function by using his own lungs. While 
in the womb, a special fluid bathes your baby’s lungs, and this fluid is often 
pushed out during delivery. Sometimes, however, a baby needs extra time and 
help — in the form of suctioning or stimuli — to expel all the fluid in the lungs.

218
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
You may notice that your baby breathes differently than you do. Most babies 
breathe 30 to 40 times a minute. A newborn’s respiratory rate also can 
increase with physical activity. Newborns breathe through their noses rather 
than their mouths. This great natural adaptation enables them to breathe 
while nursing or bottle-feeding.
You may also think that your baby’s belly looks unusually large and protu-
berant, but it’s just a normal new baby’s belly. The fact that the belly rises up 
and down quite noticeably during breathing and gets somewhat distended as 
the baby starts to swallow some air only enhances the effect. This movement 
is also normal because babies use their diaphragms to breathe, not their 
chest muscles, as older children and adults usually do.
Knowing What to Expect in the Hospital
After your nurse and practitioner are assured that your baby is fine (usually 
determined by an Apgar test — see Chapter 11 for details), the hospital staff 
starts cleaning the baby and helping him make a comfortable transition to 
life outside the womb. Like butterflies emerging from their cocoons, new-
borns must adjust to a new state of being in various ways. Suddenly, and for 
the first time, they can breathe on their own and see the wide world around 
them. This section points out what happens in the hospital after your baby is 
born to ensure he is warm, safe, and healthy.
Preparing baby for life outside the womb
A lot happens in the few hours immediately after your baby is born. He has 
made a pretty significant change and has a lot to adjust to. The medical staff 
takes immediate action to give him the best start in life.

Bracelets are for security, not a fashion statement
At the hospital, your baby wears an identifica-
tion bracelet to identify him as yours. All hospi-
tals also require that the mother wear a bracelet 
with the baby’s ID number on it. (Many hospitals 
now also require every new father to wear an 
ID band to identify the proud father.) Each time 
the staff brings the baby to the mother, the staff 
member reads off the numbers to ensure that 
the right baby is given to the right mother. Most 
hospitals also take additional security mea-
sures to prevent any mix-ups and to prevent 
unauthorized individuals from gaining access 
to the nursery. Many nurseries are locked and 
all are closely supervised.

219
 Chapter 12: Hello, World! Your Newborn
Keeping your baby warm and dry
Because body temperature drops rapidly after birth, keeping your new baby 
warm and dry is important. If newborns become cold, their oxygen require-
ments increase. For this reason, a nurse dries the baby off, places him in a 
warmer or warmed bassinet, and then watches his temperature closely. Often 
the nurse wraps or swaddles him in a blanket and puts a little hat on him to 
reduce the loss of heat from the head — the site of most heat loss (just as 
your mother told you). When the baby gets to the nursery, a nurse usually 
dresses him in a little shirt and then wraps him again in a blanket.
Caring for your baby’s eyes
Most hospital staffs routinely place an antibiotic ointment into a newborn’s 
eyes to lower the chance that your baby may develop an infection from 
passage through the vagina of a mother who has chlamydia or gonorrhea. 
The ointment doesn’t appear to be bothersome to babies and is completely 
absorbed within a few hours.

Some parents worry that the ointment may blur the baby’s vision and thus 
hinder parent-child bonding. You don’t have any reason to be concerned 
about possible blurring, however. Babies don’t see clearly in any case (see the 
“Eyes and ears” section earlier).
Boosting vitamin K
Most hospitals give newborns an injection of vitamin K to decrease the 
risk of serious bleeding. Vitamin K is important in the body’s production of 
substances that help the blood clot. This nutrient doesn’t pass through the 
placenta to a baby very easily, however, and newborn livers, because they’re 
immature, produce very little of it. So babies are typically low in this nutrient. 
Giving the baby vitamin K is an important preventive measure.
Making tracks: Baby’s footprints
Most likely, a nurse takes your baby’s footprints shortly after he is born 
to make a permanent record of identity. (The unique ridges that form on a 
baby’s feet are actually present several months before birth.) Some hospitals 
give you a copy of your baby’s footprints for your scrapbook. Although most 
hospitals still use this technique of identification, not all do.
Vaccinating for hepatitis B
Many hospitals now routinely start the vaccination process against hepatitis 
B for newborn babies, whereas others prefer that a pediatrician administer 
the first of the three shots after the baby is discharged from the hospital. 
(The last two are given over the course of the next six months.) Wherever 
your baby receives the vaccine, this shot is an important tool to reduce his 
chance of contracting hepatitis B later in life.

220
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Understanding baby’s developing 
digestive system
Most babies wet their diapers six to ten times a day by the time they’re one 
week old. The frequency of bowel movements depends on whether you 
bottle- or breastfeed. Typically, a breastfed baby has two or more bowel 
movements per day, whereas a formula-fed baby has only one or two per day.
Don’t be surprised if your baby’s first stool looks like thick, sticky, black 
tar — that’s normal. It’s called meconium. Ninety percent of newborns pass 
their first stool within the first 24 hours, and almost all the rest do so by 36 
hours. Later on, the color of the stools lightens, and the texture becomes 
more normal. A formula-fed baby typically has semi-formed, yellow-green 
stools, whereas a breastfed baby has looser, more granular, yellowish stools.

Most newborns urinate within the first few hours after birth, but some 
don’t urinate until the second day. The passage of meconium and urine is 
an important sign that your baby’s gastrointestinal and urinary tracts are 
functioning well.
Considering circumcision
Circumcision is the surgical removal of a male infant’s penis foreskin. Parents 
of boy babies must decide whether they want their son to have this proce-
dure performed. The decision to have a circumcision may involve cultural 
and religious considerations, as well as personal preferences. More than half 
of newborn boys in the United States are circumcised, but in many other 
countries, circumcision is rarely performed. The frequency of circumcision in 
the United States is on the decline, as new information is emerging that chal-
lenges the medical arguments for performing the procedure.
Doctors once thought that circumcision helped reduce the incidence of 
penile cancer, that it prevented infections, and that it reduced the incidence 
of changes in the appearance of a penis related to a tight foreskin. However, 
these advantages haven’t proved to be true. In fact, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics has issued a formal statement that currently no absolute medical 
indication for routine circumcision exists. Circumcision based on cultural or 
religious views is still relatively common. The decision, of course, is one that 
both parents should be comfortable with.
If you decide to circumcise your son, your obstetrician or pediatrician 
performs the procedure within a day or two after your son is born — as long 
as he is healthy, full-term, or nearly full-term, and without any congenital 

221
 Chapter 12: Hello, World! Your Newborn
abnormalities that would cause your doctor not to do the procedure. Some 
Jewish families have a ceremonial circumcision after the baby is discharged 
from the hospital, performed by a mohel.
Many hospitals offer injectable anesthetics or an anesthetic cream that doc-
tors apply to the baby’s penis prior to the procedure. The emphasis on pain 
medication is a humane and important medical advance, prompted by stud-
ies that show that newborns do indeed react to the pain and stress associ-
ated with circumcision. Still, some doctors prefer not to use pain medication 
because it prolongs the procedure, which in itself can increase the baby’s 
discomfort.
After circumcision, the doctor wraps the baby’s penis in petroleum jelly-
soaked gauze. When this gauze falls off after about four hours, the top of the 
penis may look reddish and slightly swollen.
 
If the gauze doesn’t fall off, don’t pull at it. Squeeze warm water over the 
gauze to help it loosen. In the first few days, clean the area with warm water 
and keep it dry. After each diaper change, apply an antibacterial ointment or 
petroleum jelly until the penis heals.
 
The penis is usually completely healed within one week. During this time, you 
may notice a crusty substance at the tip; this substance is normal and goes 
away with time. But if the penis looks unusually swollen and discolored or if 
your baby has a fever, give your pediatrician a call.
Spending time in the neonatal 
intensive care unit
During the hospital stay after delivery, most newborns room with their moth-
ers or stay at least part of the time in the regular hospital nursery — some-
times called the well-baby nursery. But sometimes newborns need the kind 
of extra attention they can get only in a neonatal intensive care unit — some-
times called a special care nursery. Within such a nursery, you may find a spe-
cial area for critical care, where one-on-one nursing, sophisticated monitors, 
breathing machines, and so on are available. You may also find the so-called 
step-down area, for babies who aren’t yet ready to go to the well-baby nursery 
but don’t need critical, one-on-one care.
If your pediatrician thinks that your baby needs neonatal intensive care unit 
care, it doesn’t automatically mean that something is wrong. Often, doctors 
place babies in special care nurseries for a short while just for observation — 
for any number of reasons. These are some of the most common (this list is 
far from inclusive):

222
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
✓ The baby was born prematurely.
 
✓ The baby does not weigh quite enough to make the birthweight cutoff 
established by your particular hospital.
 
✓ The baby may need antibiotics — for example, because the mother had 
a fever during labor or because she had a prolonged rupture of mem-
branes prior to delivery.
 
✓ The baby’s breathing seems somewhat labored. This reason is a rela-
tively common one for putting a baby under observation for a short 
period of time.
 
✓ The baby has a fever or a seizure.
 
✓ The baby is anemic.
 
✓ The baby is born with certain congenital abnormalities.
 
✓ The baby requires surgery.
Checking In: Baby’s First Doctor Visit
Before or after delivery, someone from the hospital asks for your pediatri-
cian’s name. This doctor should be someone who is authorized to work 
at the hospital where you have delivered but may or may not be the same 
pediatrician you plan to use after you leave the hospital. If you live some 
distance from the hospital and have selected a pediatrician close to your 
home who doesn’t have privileges at the hospital where you deliver, you 
still need another pediatrician to care for your baby during the hospital stay. 
Depending on the time you deliver, the pediatrician may see the baby on the 
same day, or he may see the baby the next day.
When the pediatrician examines your baby, he checks the baby’s general 
appearance, listens for heart murmurs, feels the fontanelles (the openings 
in the baby’s skull where the various bones come together), looks at the 
extremities, checks the hips, and generally makes sure that the baby is in 
good condition. The pediatrician orders a variety of standard blood tests and 
newborn screening tests. The specific screens that are required vary from 
state to state but often include tests for thyroid disease, PKU (a condition in 
which a person has trouble metabolizing some amino acids), and other inher-
ited metabolic disorders. The results of these screening tests usually don’t 
come back until after you take your baby home. The pediatrician gives you 
the results at your baby’s first office visit. If any of the tests come back posi-
tive, the state also notifies you by mail. Be sure to ask the pediatrician upon 
discharge when your baby should be seen again.

223
 Chapter 12: Hello, World! Your Newborn
Considering heart rate and 
circulatory changes
Remember how your practitioner checked the fetal heart rate during prenatal 
visits? You may have noticed then how fast the beat was. In utero, the baby’s 
heart rate is, on average, 120 to 160 beats per minute, and this heart rate pat-
tern continues during the newborn period. Your baby’s heart rate also can 
increase with physical activity and slow down when he sleeps.
 
After your baby is born, important changes in circulation occur. In utero, 
because a fetus doesn’t use the lungs to breathe, a structure called the ductus 
arteriosus shunts away much of the blood from the lungs. Normally, this shunt 
closes on the first day of life. Sometimes, a murmur is heard in the first days 
after the baby is born, which indicates changes in blood flow. This murmur, 
which is called a PDA for patent ductus arteriosus, is usually normal and 
nothing to worry about. However, some heart murmurs may require further 
investigation — specifically, a special sonogram, or echocardiogram, of the 
baby’s heart. Even when a cardiologist finds murmurs due to small structural 
problems (like a small hole in the heart’s septum), many murmurs go away 
on their own. If your baby is diagnosed with a murmur, discuss it thoroughly 
with the baby’s pediatrician or a pediatric cardiologist who specializes in 
these conditions.
Looking at weight changes
Most newborns lose weight during their first few days of life — usually 
about 10 percent of their body weight — which, of course, if you weigh only 
7 or 8 pounds (3,200 or 3,600 grams), amounts to less than a pound (454 
grams). This phenomenon is completely normal and is usually caused by 
fluid loss from urine, feces, and sweat. During the first few days of life, the 
typical infant takes in very little food or water to replace this weight loss. 
Preterm babies lose more weight than full-term babies, and it may take 
them longer to regain their weight. In contrast, babies who are small for 
their gestational age may gain weight more rapidly. Generally, most new-
borns regain their birthweight by the tenth day of life. By the age of five 
months, they’re likely to double their birthweight. By the end of the first 
year, they triple it.

224

For Dads: Home at Last — 
with the New Family
In the hospital, the primary focus is on the patient — in the case of child-
birth, the mother and her baby. But the hospital stay is usually short, and as 
soon as Mom and baby come home, you’re expected to join them on center 
stage. In fact, you’re likely to find yourself in a starring role.
If pregnancy, labor, and delivery weren’t enough to jolt you into the realiza-
tion that your life is changing forever, getting home from the hospital with 
your new family certainly does. You and your partner now have a new set 
of responsibilities. Long gone are the days when it was normal for men to 
assume that the mother would take them on all by herself. Men can help 
change diapers (they even have changing tables in men’s restrooms these 
days), feed the baby, shop, and do household chores. Even if your partner 
is breastfeeding, you can sometimes feed the baby breast milk she has 
pumped and put into a bottle. In fact, parents may want to prepare bottles 
this way regularly because feeding the baby is an important and highly 
satisfying way to bond.
Your partner is going to need at least six weeks to get back to pre-pregnancy 
shape, and probably longer. During the first couple of months, she may be 
exhausted. She’s recovering from labor and delivery, after all. And chances 
are good that both you and she are somewhat sleep-deprived. Conditions like 
these make it easy for anyone to lose his patience from time to time or to lose 
her temper more often than usual. Simply being aware of the fact that you’re 
operating under special circumstances for a while is helpful. See that your 
partner has time for rest — and try to take naps yourself.
In a somewhat stressful (even if very joyful) situation such as having a new 
baby, sex may not be a huge priority. Give yourself and your partner the time 
you both need to adjust your sex drives. Even after your partner’s practi-
tioner gives her the go-ahead to resume sex (usually about six weeks after 
delivery) and you’re both ready, take things slow and easy at first. The tissue 
around your partner’s vagina and perineum (the area between her vagina and 
rectum) may still be a little sore. And the fact that it has been some number 
of weeks or months since the two of you have had intercourse may add to 
the discomfort. Many couples find it useful to use a water-based lubricant 
for the first few times; some new mothers need to wait longer than six weeks 
after delivery before they’re comfortable enough for sex.

225
 Chapter 12: Hello, World! Your Newborn
Finally, don’t be surprised if you feel unprepared for parenthood, lacking not 
only skills, but also an understanding of what it takes to do a good job. Unlike 
cats, dogs, or jungle animals, humans aren’t born with surefire instincts 
about how to be perfect parents. Both you and your partner need time to 
develop the skills it takes to handle babies — and children, and teenagers. . . . 
Along the way, you often work by trial and error. Just realize and accept this 
situation. Talk about it with each other — often. And fasten your seat belts. 
You’re in for an incredible adventure.

Taking Care of Yourself 
after Delivery
In This Chapter

▶ Recovering from cesarean delivery
▶ Looking at postpartum changes
▶ Resuming your normal activities
A
ccording to the old adage, it takes nine months for a woman to make 
a baby and nine months for her body to return to normal afterwards. In 
reality, the time it takes to recover from childbirth varies widely from woman 
to woman. But most of the changes that your body goes through during 
pregnancy revert to normal during the postpartum period — sometimes 
called the puerperium — which begins immediately after delivery of the 
placenta and lasts for six to eight weeks.
As you go through this period of change, you’re likely to have many ques-
tions about what you can do to make the postpartum transition as easy 
as possible. In this chapter, we tell you what life may be like as your body 
gets back into its old shape, as you begin to have sex again, and as you deal 
with all the physical and psychological challenges of new motherhood.
Recuperating from Delivery
The average hospital stay after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery is 24 to 48 
hours. After a cesarean, you may stay in the hospital for two to four days. In 
some hospitals, you spend this recovery period in the same room in which 
you delivered. In others, you move to a separate postpartum unit. The nurses 
continue to monitor your vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, 

228
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
and breathing) and check your uterus to make sure that it’s firm and well-
contracted. Nurses (often the same ones taking care of you) also monitor 
your baby’s vital signs. Your nurses can provide you with pain medication 
that your practitioner has prescribed, if you need it, and help you care for 
your tear, episiotomy, or cesarean incision, if you have either one.
The following sections outline the different ways your body begins to 
recuperate after a delivery and what you can expect.
Looking and feeling like a new mom
Only in movies and on TV do women throw on a sassy pre-pregnancy outfit 
and leave the hospital looking like they did before they even considered 
having a baby. Delivery takes a toll, and although most of the changes are 
fleeting, you’ll notice that you look and feel different.
After delivery, your face may be swollen, very red, and possibly splotchy. 
Some women even have black marks under the eyes or broken blood vessels 
around their eyes and, all in all, look as though they’ve just been in a prize 
fight. All these characteristics are to be expected; pushing causes the rupture 
of tiny blood vessels in your face. Don’t be alarmed. You’ll look like your old 
self again in a few days.
You’ll also feel like yourself before long, but you’re likely to experience after-
pains, or contractions that persist sporadically after delivery. These pains 
are similar to the contractions you experienced during labor and delivery, 
and they gradually fade away within a few days. You may find the afterpains 
are more noticeable while you’re breastfeeding.

Experiencing vaginal bleeding after delivery is completely normal, even if you 
had a cesarean delivery. Average blood loss after a vaginal delivery is about 
500 cc, or one pint. After a cesarean, the average blood loss is twice that — 
about a liter, or a quart. In order to minimize excessive blood loss, many prac-
titioners give oxytocin (Pitocin) through the mother’s intravenous (IV) line or 
methylergonovine malleate (Methergine) as an intramuscular injection. These 
medications help keep the uterus contracted. When the uterus contracts, it 
squeezes shut the blood vessels from the placental bed to reduce bleeding. 
If your uterus doesn’t seem to be contracting well, your doctor or nurse may 
massage your uterus, through your abdomen, to promote contractions.

229
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
The blood coming from your vagina, called lochia, may initially appear bright 
red and contain clots. Over time, it takes on a pinkish and later a brownish 
color. It gradually diminishes in volume, but the flow may persist for three 
to four weeks after delivery. You may notice that the amount of bleeding 
increases each time you breastfeed. This increase happens because the 
hormones that help produce breast milk also cause your uterus to contract, 
and this contraction squeezes out any blood or lochia in the uterus. Many 
patients tell us that the bleeding is heavier when they stand up after being in 
bed for a while. This extra bleeding happens simply because the blood pools 
in the uterus and vagina while you’re lying down, and when you stand up, 
gravity draws it out. It’s perfectly normal.
 
If you have very heavy bleeding with clots that lasts for several weeks after 
your delivery, let your practitioner know.
The best way to deal with postpartum bleeding is to use sanitary napkins. 
Pads are available in varying thicknesses to accommodate whatever amount 
of bleeding you have. Don’t use tampons because they may promote infec-
tion during the time that your uterus is still recovering. Although the bleed-
ing usually subsides after two weeks, some women experience bleeding for 
six to eight weeks. Occasionally, fragments of placental tissue stay within the 
uterus, and this condition can lead to extensive bleeding.
 
Traditionally, doctors told women not to take deep tub baths after delivery if 
they were still bleeding. Today, many practitioners say that tub baths are 
okay, and most feel that shallow sitz baths, at least, are perfectly acceptable. 
If your practitioner says to avoid tub baths until your bleeding has subsided, 
she may be concerned that full baths may increase the chance that you may 
develop some infection inside your uterus. The trouble is that doctors really 
have no data on this topic — no studies demonstrate a risk from taking full 
baths. Ask your practitioner what she thinks you should do.
 
If your lochia takes on a foul odor, let your nurse or practitioner know.
Dealing with perineal pain
The amount of pain or soreness you feel in your perineum (the area between 
the vagina and the rectum) depends largely on how difficult your delivery 
was. If your baby came out easily after only a couple of pushes and you 
have no episiotomy or lacerations, you probably feel little pain. If, on the 
other hand, you pushed for three hours and delivered a ten-pound budding 
linebacker, you’re more likely to have perineal discomfort.

230
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
The pain you feel has several causes: The progression of the baby through 
the birth canal causes stretching and swelling of the surrounding tissues. 
Also, an episiotomy or tears in the perineum naturally hurt, just as an injury 
to any other part of your body would. The pain is worse during the first two 
days after delivery. After that, it rapidly improves and is usually nearly gone 
within a week.
Your perineum may be swollen, and if you had an episiotomy, you have 
stitches closing it up. Sometimes these stitches are visible on the outside, 
and sometimes they’re buried underneath the skin.

Many women are concerned about the stitches used to sew up their epi-
siotomy or lacerations. These sutures aren’t meant to be removed. They 
gradually dissolve over the next one to two weeks. They’re strong enough to 
handle most activities, so don’t worry that a sneeze, a difficult bowel move-
ment, or lifting your 10-pound baby will cause the stitches to tear open.
 
Keeping the perineal area clean to prevent an infection from developing is 
important. Such an infection is a rare complication, but call your doctor 
if you notice a foul-smelling discharge or increasing pain and tenderness in the 
area, especially if you have a fever higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
Here are the best ways to care for your perineum as it recovers from your 
delivery:
 
✓ Keep the perineal area clean. You may want to use a squirt bottle 
filled with warm water to help clean places that are difficult to reach. 
Sometimes your nurse at the hospital can give you one to take home 
with you.
 
✓ Some women get relief from pain by taking a sitz bath. A sitz bath con-
sists of soaking your bottom in a small amount of warm water. In the 
hospital, the nurses provide you with special basins for taking sitz 
baths. At home, you can sit in a few inches of warm water in the bathtub. 
If you have a lot of swelling in the area, putting Epsom salts in the water 
may give you added relief.
 
✓ You can buy various kinds of anesthetic sprays and pads that you can 
apply to the perineum to help ease the pain. Or you can soak gauze pads 
in witch hazel and apply them to the area. Some women find that chilling 
the witch hazel increases its effectiveness. (You can also buy little gauze 
pads that are presoaked in witch hazel — Tucks, for example.) Other 
women find that ointment or petroleum jelly is soothing, too. It keeps 
the skin moist and soft and prevents it from sticking to sanitary pads.
 
✓ An ice pack applied to the perineum during the first 24 hours after 
delivery helps minimize swelling and decreases your discomfort.
 
✓ Over-the-counter pain relievers — such as acetaminophen (Tylenol is a 
well-known example) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin or Advil) — or some 
prescribed pain medications further ease the pain. These medications 
aren’t a problem if you’re breastfeeding.

231
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
 
✓ Avoid standing for long periods of time, which can make the pain worse.
 
✓ After a bowel movement, try not to contaminate the area with the toilet 
tissue you use to wipe yourself. Clean the area around the anus with a 
separate toilet tissue, and don’t wipe from back to front. If the areas 
around the anus or the perineum are tender, try to just pat the area dry, 
instead of wiping. You may find that using baby wipes is really helpful, 
because they clean the area very well, don’t shred, and are gentle on 
healing tissues.
 
✓ Don’t insert anything into your vagina (such as a tampon) for six weeks 
and don’t douche.
 
Relieving the gravitational pressure on your perineum from time to time by 
getting off your feet and lying down for a short while is important. Finding the 
time may be hard given that you’re incredibly busy caring for a new baby, 
but make it a priority. And take heart — usually in a week and certainly by 
two weeks, most of your discomfort is gone.
 
If you’re extremely uncomfortable, you may want to ask your doctor to 
prescribe pain medications. If you notice that your perineal area is very red 
or purple and tender, if you run a fever, or if you notice a foul-smelling 
discharge, let your practitioner know.
 
If you had any lacerations that extended near your rectum, you may want to 
take a stool softener (such as Colace), not a laxative, so that bowel movements 
aren’t too terribly painful. At least make sure that you drink extra fluids and 
consume extra fiber in your diet so that your stool is soft. When you anticipate 
having a bowel movement, you may want to take a pain reliever ahead of 
time — acetaminophen (Tylenol), perhaps, or some other nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory agent, such as ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil).
Surviving swelling

Immediately after delivery, especially after a vaginal delivery, you may 
discover that your entire body looks swollen. Don’t freak out — this is normal. 
Many women develop swelling during the last few weeks of pregnancy, and 
this swelling often persists for a few days to a few weeks into the postpartum 
period. The intense pushing efforts required to deliver the baby may further 
cause your face and neck to swell, but this also goes away a few days after 
delivery. In general, it can take up to two weeks for the swelling to completely 
go away.
 
Don’t step on the scale the day after you deliver. You may find that you have 
actually gained weight from all the water you retain during delivery.

232
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Many patients ask, “Isn’t there something you can give me to help relieve the 
swelling, like a diuretic or something?” Prescribing medication usually isn’t 
necessary because the swelling goes away on its own in a few days, when 
you’re back up and around. Just be patient. You will have ankles again.
Coping with your bladder
When you were pregnant, you probably felt like all you did was pee, right? 
Now, after you’ve given birth, you may actually find urinating difficult 
immediately after delivery, or you may feel discomfort when you do urinate. 
This discomfort is a result of the way the bladder and urethra are com-
pressed when the baby’s head and body come through the vagina. The 
tissues around the opening to the urethra are often swollen after delivery, 
and this swelling can add to the discomfort.
Some women may need to be catheterized (a thin, flexible plastic tube is 
inserted through the urethra into the bladder) after delivery to help empty 
the bladder. The problem is sometimes worse in women who have an 
epidural because the anesthesia can hang around in your system for several 
hours and temporarily make the bladder more difficult to empty. But 
your bladder regains its normal tone a few hours after delivery, so urinary 
discomfort is usually a short-lived problem.
 
If you feel a burning sensation primarily during urination, let your doctor or 
nurse know because it may be a sign that you’re developing a urinary tract 
infection.
Some women experience the opposite problem: They find that they don’t 
have good control over their bladder function — that they leak a little urine 
when they stand up or laugh, or that they have to run like a cheetah to make 
it to the john in time. If this incontinence happens to you, don’t worry too 
much because time usually solves the problem. In some cases, it may take a 
number of weeks to get things under control.
 
Kegel exercises (see “Doing Kegel exercises” later in this chapter) may be 
useful if the problem persists. Another good strategy is to make a conscious 
effort to go to the bathroom at regular intervals to empty your bladder before 
it becomes an emergency!
Battling the hemorrhoid blues
Most of your pushing efforts during delivery are focused toward the rectum, 
a fact that causes many women to develop hemorrhoids — dilated veins 
that pop out from the rectum. Unfortunately, having no problems with 

233
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
hemorrhoids before you go into labor is no guarantee that they won’t appear 
after delivery. If you develop hemorrhoids during the last part of your preg-
nancy, they may get worse after delivery. At times, hemorrhoids can be more 
uncomfortable than an episiotomy, and they last a little longer. Turn to 
Chapter 7 for tips on dealing with hemorrhoids.

The good news is that the problem is usually temporary. Postpartum 
hemorrhoids typically go away within a few weeks. Sometimes they don’t go 
away completely, but for the most part they aren’t bothersome. They may 
not trouble you at all for a few months, and then they may be uncomfortable 
again for a few days, and then get better again.
Consider taking a stool softener (such as Colace), as we mention earlier, 
and make sure you consume plenty of fluids and fiber. This way, bowel 
movements won’t hurt so much and you won’t have to push too hard (which 
makes hemorrhoids worse). Your hemorrhoids are likely to go away within 
one to two weeks.
Understanding postpartum bowel function
Many women find that they don’t have a bowel movement for a few days after 
delivery. This lack of bowel function may be because you haven’t eaten much 
or because epidurals and some other pain medications sometimes slow down 
the bowels a little. Your system may take a few days to return to normal.
 
Many women are afraid of bearing down because they don’t want to tear the 
stitches used to repair their episiotomy, so they avoid having a bowel move-
ment altogether. But avoiding a bowel movement isn’t a great idea. You have 
no reason to be afraid of tearing the stitches. Your episiotomy is repaired in 
several layers with strong sutures. Tearing the sutures is extremely difficult, 
especially by having a bowel movement.
Here are a few ways to make having a bowel movement easier:
 
✓ Walk around the postpartum ward as much as you can. Walking 
improves circulation to the bowels and can help to eliminate any 
residual effects of the epidural.
 
✓ Try taking a stool softener, such as Colace.
 
✓ Try not to think about it too much. Things happen in time.
 
If you have hemorrhoids or a laceration that reaches back to the rectal area 
(see Chapter 10), a bowel movement may be painful. You can reduce the 
discomfort by using a local anesthetic cream and by using a stool softener. 
Also, you may want to take a pain reliever shortly before you anticipate having 
a bowel movement.

234
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Continuing to recover at home
By the time you’re discharged from the hospital after a vaginal delivery, most 
of the acute pain is gone. After you get home, however, you can still expect 
some soreness. The main area of discomfort is around your perineum. No 
matter how easy your delivery may have been, this part of your body has 
undergone some real trauma, and it simply needs time to heal.
Try not to let the lingering discomfort associated with having just given birth 
frustrate you. Keep in mind what an amazing miracle your body has just been 
through. In addition to dealing with the soreness from delivery, you need 
to adjust to a new lifestyle — getting up at all hours of the night, changing 
diapers, and feeding your new baby.
Recovering from a Cesarean Delivery
The hospital stay after a cesarean delivery is generally a few days longer than 
after a vaginal delivery — usually three to four days in total. If you have 
a cesarean delivery, you’re put on a stretcher immediately afterward and 
transported to the recovery room. You may even feel up to holding your 
baby in your arms during the trip. Just like any surgery, the first few days can 
be uncomfortable. Don’t worry, though, because after the initial few days, 
most people recovery quite easily.
Going to the recovery room
When you’re in the recovery room, your nurse and anesthesiologist monitor 
your vital signs. The nurse periodically checks your abdomen to make sure 
that the uterus is firm and that the dressing over the incision is dry. Your 
nurse also checks for signs of excessive bleeding from the uterus. More than 
likely, you have a catheter in your bladder, and it stays in place for the first 
night so that you don’t have to worry about getting up to go to the bathroom. 
You also have an intravenous (IV) line in place to receive fluids and any medi-
cations your doctor prescribes. If you had an epidural or spinal anesthetic, 
your legs may still seem a little numb or heavy. This feeling wears off in a few 
hours. If you had general anesthesia (that is, if you were “put to sleep”), you 
may feel a little groggy when you get to the recovery room. Just as with a 
vaginal delivery, you may experience some shaking (see Chapter 10). If you’re 
up to it and if you want to, you can breastfeed your baby while you’re in the 
recovery room.
Most likely, you received pain medication in the operating room, and you 
may not need any more while you’re in the recovery room. In some hospitals, 
if you have an epidural or spinal, your anesthesiologist injects a long-lasting 

235
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
medication into the catheter that keeps you almost pain-free for about 24 
hours. If, however, your pain medication doesn’t seem to be working, by all 
means let your nurse know.
Taking it one step at a time
When your nurse and anesthesiologist are confident that your vital signs 
are stable and that you’re recovering normally from the anesthesia, you’re 
discharged from the recovery room — generally about one to three hours 
after delivery. You’re transported on a stretcher to a hospital room, where 
you spend the rest of your recovery time.
The day of delivery
On the day of your cesarean, you should plan on just staying in bed. Thanks 
to your catheter, you don’t need to worry about getting up to go to the 
bathroom. If you had your surgery early in the morning, you may feel like 
getting up later in the evening, if only to sit in a chair. Just be sure to check 
with your nurse first to see whether getting up is okay. When you get up 
the first time, make sure someone is there to help you.
Although some doctors still prefer that patients not have any food immedi-
ately after a cesarean, many doctors now allow women to eat and drink 
shortly after the surgery. Often, we find that the patient is the best judge of 
what she should and shouldn’t do: If you feel queasy and nauseous, you’re 
better off not eating. But if you feel hungry, drinking liquids and having small 
amounts of solid food is probably fine.
Like women who have had a vaginal delivery, expect some vaginal bleeding 
(lochia) after a cesarean. The bleeding may be quite heavy during the first 
few days after your surgery (see “Understanding postpartum bleeding” 
earlier in this chapter).

Most women who have a cesarean delivery and have staples in their skin 
worry that removing the staples will hurt. But don’t worry. Staple removal is a 
quick and painless procedure.
The day after
The first day after your surgery, your doctor is likely to encourage you to get 
out of bed and start to walk around. The first couple of times you get up to 
walk may be pretty uncomfortable — you may feel pain around the incision 
in your abdomen — so you may want to ask for a so-called top up dose of 
pain medication 20 minutes or so before getting up.
 
Make sure someone is with you the first few times you get up to make sure 
you don’t fall.

236
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Depending on your fluid needs, your doctor may also discontinue your IV 
line. Most of the time, you’re able to drink liquids on the first day, and many 
doctors also let you eat solid food.
Most likely, you have a bandage over your abdominal incision. Sometimes 
this bandage comes off on day one, but other times doctors prefer to leave it 
on longer.
Many women ask about rooming in — that is, having the baby stay in the 
room with them — after a cesarean delivery, especially after they’ve had a 
day or so to recover a bit from the procedure. Having the baby in the room 
with you is certainly fine if you feel up to it. But by no means should you feel 
that you have to. Keep in mind that you just had abdominal surgery, and you 
may not be physically able to attend to every single one of your baby’s needs 
during the first few days afterward. The hospital nurses are there to help, so 
during this time devote as much energy as possible to your own recovery. 
You’ll be that much better able to care for your baby after you get home.
Understanding post-cesarean pain
You may feel a kind of burning pain at the site of your abdominal skin 
incision. This pain is worse when you get out of bed or change positions. 
Eventually, the burning diminishes to a sort of tingling sensation and is 
much improved within a week or two after surgery.
You may also feel pain from post-delivery uterine contractions — just as 
women who deliver vaginally do. Your doctor is likely to give you oxytocin 
(Pitocin) for the first few hours after your surgery to encourage contractions 
and thus minimize blood loss. Pain from contractions diminishes by the 
second day, although it may recur when you breastfeed because breastfeed-
ing can trigger more contractions.
You may feel pain in tissues deep beneath your skin. A cesarean isn’t a 
simple slit through the surface of a woman’s belly. The physician must cut 
through several layers of tissue in order to reach the uterus. Each layer must 
then be repaired. And every one of the repaired incisions can generate pain, 
which is why you may feel pain deep in your abdomen after a cesarean. This 
pain usually takes one to two weeks to fade away. Many women tell us that 
they feel more pain on one side or the other, possibly because the stitches 
are a little tighter on one side. Whatever the reason, uneven pain is very 
common and nothing to worry about.
Many women say the worst pain of all is gas pain. The intestines accumulate 
a large amount of gas after a cesarean delivery, in part because of the way 
the intestines are manipulated during the surgery but also as a result of 

237
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
the medications — the anesthetics used during the operation and the pain-
killers given afterward. Gas pains typically begin on the second or third 
day after delivery and improve when you start to pass gas. Get up and walk 
around as much as possible, because doing so gets the gastrointestinal tract 
moving again.
If you have a cesarean delivery after going through labor for hours, you 
may have perineal pain — from pushing and from any number of internal 
exams — on top of everything else. This pain disappears soon after delivery.
Dealing with post-op pain
The amount of pain or discomfort experienced after a cesarean delivery 
varies from woman to woman, depending on the circumstances of her 
delivery and on her tolerance for pain. Your practitioner can prescribe pain 
medication, but she probably will specify that the medication shouldn’t be 
given unless you ask for it. (Sometimes this is hospital policy.) So if you want 
the pain relief, ask for it — before your pain becomes excruciating. Ask for 
the medication when you anticipate getting out of bed or just before your 
next dose of medication is due (usually after three or four hours), so that you 
give your nurse enough time to get it for you.
Some hospitals offer a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) pump, which is 
attached to your IV line. When you feel your pain increasing, you simply 
press a button on the pump to release a small amount of pain medication into 
your IV line. Because you receive the medication intravenously, you can feel 
its effects quickly, and by using the medication only when you feel you need 
it, you can often get by with much less medication in total. Don’t worry about 
overdosing, though, because the pump has special settings that prevent you 
from getting too much medication.
Getting ready to go home
After surgery, you find that each day is noticeably easier and more comfort-
able than the one before. Over the course of three days, you gradually find it 
easier to get out of bed and walk around. You start to eat normally again. 
You’re also able to shower — and many women find that first shower a truly 
big relief. But please keep in mind that you have just been through not only 
major surgery but also nine months of pregnancy! And you must recover 
from both. Some women really do recover quickly and feel like going home 
after only a couple of days. But many women need more time to feel strong 
enough to leave the hospital.

238
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
The length of your stay may be determined to some extent by what your 
insurance plan allows and what individual state laws mandate. And occasion-
ally, a post-operative infection or some other complication necessitates 
a longer-than-usual hospital stay. But typically, you’re ready to go home after 
about three days.
Here are some indications that you may be ready to go home:
 
✓ You tolerate food and liquids without any problem.
 
✓ You urinate normally and without difficulty.
 
✓ Your bowels are on their way to recovering normal function.
 
✓ You have no signs of infection.
Continuing to recover at home
When you’re discharged from the hospital after a cesarean delivery, you’re 
well on your way down the road to recovery. However, getting back on 
your feet after a cesarean delivery takes longer than after a vaginal delivery, 
so take it easy for the first week or two after you return home. Keep the 
following pointers in mind as you recover.
Taking good care of yourself
Get the help you need from family and friends, if possible. If you can afford it, 
consider hiring a baby nurse for the first few weeks. (A baby nurse can be 
quite helpful for women who’ve had vaginal births, too.) Try to keep the 
household chores you do to a minimum. Avoid running up and down stairs a 
lot. Devote your energy to taking care of your new baby and taking care of 
yourself. Pay attention, and your body will clearly let you know how much 
activity you can handle.
Some doctors recommend that you not drive a car yourself for the first week 
or two. This restriction isn’t because of the anesthesia you may have had — 
the anesthesia really doesn’t affect your reflexes for more than a day or two 
after delivery. The problem is simply that any leftover pain you may be 
experiencing after delivery may make it difficult for you to quickly move your 
foot from the gas pedal to the brake if you need to stop suddenly. When 
your pain is gone, you can safely resume driving.
Most doctors also advise you to postpone any abdominal exercises until after 
your six-week checkup, so that the incisions in all the layers of your abdomen 
have time to heal completely.

239
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
Most women feel pretty much back to normal by the six-week point. But 
some need as long as three months to fully recover.
By the time you’re home from the hospital, you should be able to eat nor-
mally. If you lost a great deal of blood during your surgery, however, you may 
want to ask your doctor whether you should take extra iron supplements.
Noticing changes in your scar
At first, the scar from your cesarean delivery looks reddish or pinkish. In 
time, it may turn a darker shade of purple or brown, depending to some 
extent on your skin color. Over the course of a year, the scar will fade 
and, eventually, assume a very pale color. If you have dark skin, it may be 
brownish. Most of the time, a cesarean scar is pencil thin or even thinner. 
A scar from a cesarean delivery may look prominent immediately after the 
procedure, when the staples are still in place, but after they’re removed 
and the scar has had several weeks to heal, you’ll observe how it begins to 
fade into something far less obvious.
Many factors can affect the healing process and thus determine what the scar 
ultimately looks like. Some women naturally are prone to form a thick type of 
scar, called a keloid. In these cases, doctors really can’t do much to change 
the situation. Some over-the-counter products are on the market that claim 
to help wounds heal, but none have been proven to be beneficial.

You may notice that the area around your incision becomes numb. This 
numbness occurs because in making the incision, your doctor cut through 
some of the nerves that transmit sensation in that area. The nerves do 
grow back, however, and in time the numbness turns into a mild tingling 
sensation and then returns to normal.
Some women notice a blood-tinged fluid discharge coming from the center 
or side of their incision. This drainage sometimes happens when blood and 
other fluids accumulate under the incision and then seep out. If only a small 
amount oozes out and the drainage then stops, it’s okay. Applying a little 
pressure to this area with a clean bandage is a good idea.
 
If you notice persistent blood-tinged or yellowish discharge from your 
incision, let your doctor know. Occasionally, the incision may open at the 
point where the drainage occurs. If so, your doctor may want you to take 
special measures to keep the opening clean so that it heals on its own.
Recognizing causes for concern
Most women who have cesarean deliveries recover without any problems. In 
some cases, however, you may not heal quickly and smoothly. Call your 
doctor if you notice any of the following:

240
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
✓ If pain from your incision or from your abdomen increases, rather than 
decreases
 
✓ If large amounts of blood or blood-tinged fluid drain from your incision
 
✓ If you have a fever higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit
 
✓ If your incision begins to open up
Going through More Postpartum Changes
Many aspects of postpartum life are the same whether you had a vaginal 
or a cesarean delivery. Now that you’re no longer pregnant, your body 
begins shifting back to its pre-pregnancy state, and you’re in for a number 
of changes. This section overviews many of the common changes you may 
experience.
Sweating like a . . . new mom

If you’re managing to get any sleep at night despite having a new baby in the 
house, you may find that you wake up drenched in sweat. Even during the 
daytime, you may notice that you perspire significantly more than usual. 
This sweating is very common and is thought to have something to do with 
fluctuations in hormone levels that occur as your body returns to a nonpreg-
nant state. It’s very similar to the night sweats and hot flashes that meno-
pausal women get, due to a drop in estrogen levels. As long as the sweating 
isn’t associated with any fever, it’s not a problem. It goes away over the 
course of the next month or so.
Dealing with breast engorgement
A woman’s breasts typically begin to engorge, or fill with milk, three to five 
days after she delivers her baby. You may be amazed to see how huge your 
breasts can really be! If you’re breastfeeding, your baby lessens the problem 
for you as she gets the hang of nursing, figures out how to take in more milk, 
and establishes a pattern of feeding. (See Chapter 14 for more information 
about breastfeeding.)
 
If you’re not breastfeeding, you may find that your breasts stay engorged for 
24 to 48 hours (which can be quite painful), and then you begin to feel better. 
Wearing a tight-fitting supportive bra may make the process a little less 
uncomfortable. Applying ice packs or bags of frozen peas to your breasts 
helps the milk to “dry up,” as does taking cold showers. Cold temperature 

241
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
causes the blood vessels in the breasts to constrict, lessening milk produc-
tion, whereas warmth causes the blood vessels to dilate, promoting milk 
production. (Doctors no longer prescribe a medication to help a woman’s 
milk dry up, because the drug they once used has been associated with some 
significant complications.)
Understanding hair loss
One of the stranger aspects of the postpartum return to normalcy is hair 
loss. A few weeks or months after delivery, most women notice that they’re 
shedding like crazy. This shedding is normal. It is one of the effects that 
estrogen has on your body during pregnancy. This common problem doesn’t 
last long. Your hair is usually back to normal by nine months after delivery.
 
All hair follicles go through three phases of development: a resting phase, a so-
called transitional phase, and a shedding phase. The elevated levels of estrogen 
that are present during pregnancy essentially freeze your hair in the resting 
phase. Within a few months after delivery, all that hair proceeds on to the 
shedding phase. Suddenly, you notice large amounts of hair sticking in your 
brush or washing down the drain.
Chasing away the baby blues
Studies show that the vast majority of women — as many as 80 percent — 
suffers a bout of the blues during the first days and weeks after they deliver. 
Typically, you begin to feel a little down a few days after the birth, and 
you may continue to feel vague sadness, uncertainty, disappointment, and 
emotional discontent for a few weeks. Many women are surprised at the 
feeling; after all, they’ve looked forward to motherhood, and they feel sure 
that they’re really thrilled about it.
No one knows for sure why women get the blues postpartum, but a few 
explanations are plausible. First, the shift in hormone levels that comes after 
delivery can affect mood. Also, when pregnancy ends, a mother must 
change her whole focus. After focusing on the birth for so many months, 
she suddenly finds that the big event is over, and she may feel almost a sense 
of loss. And face it — parenthood brings tremendous anxiety, especially 
for a first-time mother. Feeling overwhelmed by all the responsibility and all 
she needs to figure out about caring for a baby isn’t unusual for a woman. 
Add in the physical discomfort — episiotomy repair, breast tenderness, 
hemorrhoids, fatigue, and the rest — and you begin to wonder how any new 
mother can avoid feeling a little blue.

Fortunately, postpartum blues tend to fade away rather quickly, usually by 
about two to four weeks after the birth. Keep in mind that what you’re feeling 
is extremely common and that it doesn’t mean you don’t love your child or 
that you won’t be a fabulous parent. Be open about it; let your partner, family 
members, and friends know how you feel, because you need love and support 
at this time.
 
If you find yourself suffering from the baby blues, remember that you’re not 
the first woman to feel this way. The feeling is as normal as pregnancy itself. 
And take heart: Those who have already grappled with the problem have 
found a number of ways to ease the blues. Consider this list of some of the 
best strategies:
 
✓ Lack of sleep compounds the problem of the baby blues. Everything is 
worse when you’re physically fatigued. The amount of stress that you 
can handle when you’ve had your rest is much greater than if you 
haven’t slept enough. So try to get more sleep. If the baby is napping, try 
to lie down and snooze.
 
✓ Accept other people’s offers of help. In most cases, you don’t have 
to take care of your baby entirely by yourself. You’re a great mom, even 
if you do let Aunt Suzie or Grandma Melba change a diaper or burp 
the baby.
 
✓ Talk about how you feel with other mothers, close family members, and 
friends. You’re likely to find that they felt exactly as you do now. They 
can empathize with you and offer suggestions for how to cope.
 
✓ If possible, try to get some time to yourself. Often, new parents are 
overwhelmed by the realization that their time is no longer their own. 
Get out of the house, if you can. Take a walk, read, watch a movie, or 
get some exercise. Have dinner with your partner or with a friend.
 
✓ Pamper yourself with a manicure or pedicure, a trip to the hair salon, 
or a massage. Often the blues are exacerbated by the fact that your body 
still isn’t back to what it used to be, and doing something that makes 
you feel beautiful may help.
 
If you don’t begin to feel better in three or four weeks, let your practitioner 
know. Some women go beyond the blues into full-blown postpartum 
depression. Check out the next section for more information.
Recognizing postpartum depression
True postpartum depression isn’t nearly as common as the blues, but it does 
affect more women than you may imagine. Between 10 and 15 percent of 
women develop depression within six months after they deliver. Symptoms 
include

243
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
 
✓ Severe unhappiness
 
✓ Inability to enjoy being with the baby (or life in general)
 
✓ Lack of interest in caring for the baby
 
✓ Insomnia
 
✓ Weak appetite
 
✓ Inability to function from day to day
 
✓ Extreme anxiety or panic attacks
 
✓ Thoughts of harming the baby or yourself
Although postpartum blues are usually mild and transient, full-blown 
depression can be severe and lasting. Despite the severity of the symptoms, 
postpartum depression often goes unrecognized, or the mother may 
attribute the problem to something else.
No one knows exactly why postpartum depression occurs, but certain 
characteristics put a woman at higher than normal risk. These risk factors 
include
 
✓ History of postpartum depression
 
✓ History of depression in general
 
✓ Experience of anxiety before the birth
 
✓ Life stress
 
✓ Lack of a good support system
 
✓ Marital dissatisfaction
 
✓ An unplanned pregnancy
 
✓ Unhappiness about the labor and delivery process
 
If you have postpartum blues and they don’t go away after three or four 
weeks, if the feeling seems to be getting worse, or if you develop the blues 
more than two months after your delivery, discuss the situation with 
your doctor. Your blues may have blossomed into full-fledged postpartum 
depression.
Treatment for postpartum depression includes counseling (group or 
individual psychotherapy), antidepressant medications, and, rarely, hospital-
ization. Recent studies have suggested that in some cases, taking small 
doses of estrogen under the tongue can help. Of course, only follow this 
treatment under your doctor’s supervision. Your doctor may want to check 
to see whether you have postpartum thyroid disease, which can mask 
itself as depression or make your depression worse. Discuss all these with 
your doctor.

Checking your progress: The first 
postpartum doctor visit
Most practitioners ask their patients to come in for a checkup about six 
weeks after delivery if both the pregnancy and the birth were uncomplicated. 
If you had a cesarean or some complication, you may be asked to come 
in earlier.
During a postpartum checkup, your practitioner performs a complete exam 
(including a breast and vaginal exam) and obtains a PAP smear. In most 
cases, the six-week checkup suffices for your annual gynecological exam. 
Your practitioner probably also talks with you about your birth control 
options. Discuss the “spacing” of future children (see Chapter 15) and 
other precautions before conceiving again — such as taking folic acid a 
few months beforehand and, if this pregnancy had complications, getting 
whatever special blood tests your practitioner may advise.
Returning to “Normal” Life
Your body typically needs six to eight weeks for the changes that you 
experience during pregnancy to disappear. After delivery, your body needs 
some time to get back in shape for your day-to-day activities, let alone for 
vigorous exercise or sex. This section focuses on what you can do to help 
make the transition a tad easier.
Getting fit all over again
Making exercise a priority after delivery is important for every new mom. 
Fitness has many important benefits for both your physical and emotional 
well-being. It can help your body recover from the stress of pregnancy, 
and it helps you feel more even-tempered and better about yourself.
Resume your sports and workouts gradually. Naturally, the amount of 
exercise you can handle depends on what kind of shape you were in before 
and during your pregnancy.

245
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
After pregnancy, restoring strength to your abdominal muscles is especially 
important. In some women, pregnancy causes the abdominal or rectus 
muscles to separate a little, as shown in Figure 13-1. The medical term for 
this separation is diastasis. Doing abdominal exercises to restore their 
strength and draw them together is important.
Over the course of two weeks, depending on how you feel, you can gradually 
increase your exercising until you’re fully active again. Finding the time may 
be a problem, of course. But fitting exercise into your schedule is worth 
every effort. Taking care of a newborn can make you feel as though you’ve 
just run a marathon, but real exercise is what your body needs. In fact, by 
improving your overall sense of well-being, exercise can make the whole 
challenge of caring for a new baby much easier.
 
Walking is great exercise for just about everyone. During the first two weeks 
after delivery, take it slow. But after that, you may find that long or brisk walks 
are enjoyable for both you and your baby — and a great form of exercise.

Losing the weight
You may feel like jumping onto a scale right after delivery to see how much 
weight you’ve lost. But take caution. Some women do lose a lot of weight 
quickly after delivery, but some actually gain weight from all the fluid 
retention. Rest assured that you’ll soon weigh less than you did before you 
delivered — probably about 15 pounds less — but the loss may not register 
until a week or two after delivery.

246
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Refer to Table 12-1 to see what accounts for the initial weight loss.
Table 12-1 
Losing Weight after Birth
Baby
6 to 9 pounds
Placenta
1 to 2 pounds
Amniotic fluid
1 to 2 pounds
Maternal fluids
4 to 8 pounds
Shrinking uterus
1 pound
Your uterus continues shrinking for several weeks. Immediately after you 
deliver, it still extends up to about the level of your navel — about the same 
point as when you were 20 weeks pregnant. However, because of the excess 
skin you now have, you probably still look pregnant when you stand up. 
Don’t let your appearance get you down! Your uterus keeps contracting and 
your skin regains much of its tone until, about two months after delivery, 
your belly is down to its pre-pregnancy size.
Most women need two to three months to get back to their normal weight, 
but, of course, the time varies according to how much weight you gain 
during pregnancy. If you gain 50 pounds (and have just one baby), don’t 
expect to look fabulous in a bikini six weeks after you deliver. Sometimes 
a woman needs an entire year to get back into shape. A healthy diet and 
regular exercise help the weight come off.
Try to get as close to your pre-pregnancy weight — or your ideal body weight 
(see Chapter 4) — as soon as is reasonably possible. You don’t have to 
let a pregnancy turn into a permanent weight gain. If you let each successive 
pregnancy cause a little more accumulation, your health may suffer in the 
long run.
Pondering your postpartum diet
Any woman who’s just had a baby needs to once again examine her diet. 
If you’re breastfeeding, you want to ensure, as you did when you were 
pregnant, that you’re eating a healthy combination of foods that provide 
both you and your baby with good nutrition and that you’re also getting 
enough fluid. (For more information about how to follow a balanced, 
nutritious diet, see Chapter 4.)

247
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
The best approach to weight loss involves exercise plus a well-balanced diet 
that’s low in fat and includes a mix of protein, carbs, fruits, and vegetables. 
You may find that a program such as Weight Watchers, which has been 
around for years and provides a sensible, well-balanced way to lose weight, 
may offer the motivation and support you need to get your diet on track. 
Weight Watchers isn’t based on rapid initial weight loss and is designed to 
change your way of eating so that you discover how to eat healthily, yet still 
lose weight. You can check out the Web site at www.weightwatchers.com. 
You may also want to check out other commercial diet programs, such as 
Jenny Craig and LA Weight Loss.
Taking your vitamins
Regardless of whether you breastfeed, continue taking your prenatal vitamins 
for at least six to eight weeks after you deliver. If you do breastfeed, keep 
taking vitamins until you stop breastfeeding. Taking care of a new baby may 
make it hard for you to eat properly, and the childbirth experience may have 
left you anemic. If you lost a particularly large amount of blood during your 
delivery, your practitioner may suggest that you take iron supplements to 
help restore your blood count. Calcium is also very important for any 
woman, especially one who’s breastfeeding, in order to maintain strong 
bones. A calcium supplement or extra calcium in your diet is a good idea.
Doing Kegel exercises
Kegel exercises are squeezing motions aimed at strengthening the muscles of 
the pelvic floor that surround the vagina and rectum. These muscles give 
support to the bladder, rectum, uterus, and vagina. Keeping them strong is 
key to reducing the adverse effects that pregnancy and delivery can have on 
this part of the body. If the pelvic floor muscles are very weak, the chances 
are greater of developing urinary stress incontinence — a leakage of urine 
when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or jump — or prolapse or protrusion of the 
rectum, vagina, and uterus — in which these organs begin to sag below the 
pelvic floor.
Pregnancy places extra weight on the pelvic floor muscles, and vaginal 
delivery stretches and puts added pressure on them. The net result is 
a general weakening. Some women seem to naturally maintain excellent 
muscle tone in the pelvic floor after delivery. But others notice symptoms of 
weakness: a little urinary incontinence, the feeling that their vagina is loose, 
or pressure on their pelvic floor from a sagging uterus, vagina, or rectum. 
The way to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles — to avoid or diminish these 
symptoms — is to perform Kegel exercises.

248
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
To perform these exercises, you tighten the muscles around your vagina and 
rectum. Here’s a simple way to find out what it feels like to do the exercises 
correctly: Sometime when you’re urinating, try to stop the flow of urine 
midstream. Or insert a finger in your vagina and try to tighten the muscles 
around your finger. If you’re doing Kegels correctly, your finger feels the 
squeeze. (Both of these techniques are simply ways of figuring out how to 
squeeze the muscles, not the way you normally practice the exercise.)
When you’re first doing Kegels, squeeze the muscles for as many as ten 
seconds and then release. Squeeze five to ten times per session, and try to 
do three to four sessions a day. Ultimately, you can build up to the point 
where you hold each squeeze for ten seconds and do 25 squeezes per 
session. Continue to do the Kegels four times a day. You can do them while 
you’re sitting, standing, or lying down, and you can do them while you’re also 
doing something else — bathing, cooking, talking on the phone, watching 
television, driving your car, or standing in line at the grocery store.
Having sex again
If you’re like most postpartum women, sex is the last thing on your mind. 
Many women find that their interest in sex declines considerably during the 
first weeks and months after pregnancy. But at some point, the fatigue and 
emotional stress of childbirth ease up, and your thoughts are likely to be 
more amorous again. For some women (and their lucky partners), the 
rebound occurs fairly quickly. For others, it may take 6 to 12 months.
The drastic hormonal shifts that occur after delivery directly affect your sex 
organs. The precipitous drop in estrogen leads to a loss of lubrication for 
your vagina, and less engorgement of blood vessels, as well. (Increased blood 
flow to the vagina is a key aspect of sexual arousal and orgasm.) For these 
reasons, intercourse after childbirth can be painful and sometimes not all 
that satisfying. With time, as hormone levels return to their pre-pregnancy 
norm, the problem tends to correct itself. In the meantime, using a lubricant 
sold specifically for this purpose helps.
The exhaustion and stress of caring for an infant further reduces the desire 
for sex in some women. Your attention, and your partner’s, too, is likely to be 
focused more on the baby than on the relationship between the parents. Set 
aside some time for the two of you to be alone together. This time together 
need not even include sex — just holding, hugging, and expressing feelings 
for each other.
Most doctors recommend that women refrain from intercourse for four to six 
weeks after the baby is born in order to give the vagina, uterus, and perineum 
time to heal and for the bleeding to subside. At your six-week follow-up 
doctor visit, you can ask your practitioner about resuming sex.

249
 Chapter 13: Taking Care of Yourself after Delivery
Choosing contraception
Many people believe that breastfeeding prevents a woman from becoming 
pregnant. Although breastfeeding usually delays the return of ovulation 
(and, thus, periods), some women who are nursing do ovulate — and do 
conceive again (see Chapter 14). You may not ovulate the entire time that 
you breastfeed, or you may start again as early as two months after delivery. 
And if you don’t breastfeed, ovulation begins, on the average, ten weeks 
after delivery, although it has been reported to occur as early as four weeks. 
If you breastfeed for less than 28 days, your ovulation returns at the same 
time as it does for non-nursing women.
Considering your options for birth control before you have sex again is 
important. Most women have a wide range of birth-control options regardless 
of whether they’re breast-feeding. But some women have medical conditions 
that prevent them from using certain methods. Discuss your options with 
your practitioner at a postpartum visit.

Chapter 14
Feeding Your Baby
In This Chapter
▶ Breast or bottle — making the decision that’s right for you
▶ Getting into the breast-feeding routine
▶ The basics of formula feeding
O
ne of the first big decisions any new parents make is whether to breast-
feed their infant or use formula and bottles. Although the majority of 
parents these days choose to breast-feed, the decision is by no means an 
easy one. If you find the decision difficult, take comfort in the fact that both 
choices are sound and legitimate. In this chapter, we lay out the basic first 
steps you need, no matter which way you go.
Deciding between Breast and Bottle
Ask almost anyone — your obstetrician, your pediatrician, your friends, total 
strangers — and they will advise you to breast-feed. In fact, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast-feeding for six months, followed 
by a combination of breast milk and complementary foods for up to at least 
12 months of age. Back in the 1950s, bottle-feeding became all the rage 
when scientists developed techniques to pasteurize and store cow’s milk 
in formulas appropriate for infant nutrition. Breast-feeding has regained 
popularity largely because people and scientific studies have recognized its 
many medical benefits.
However, the decision whether to breast-feed isn’t simply a medical one. It 
also involves issues of convenience, aesthetics, body image, maternal bond-
ing, and even conditions surrounding delivery. The decision about how to 
feed the baby is a personal one that every mother must decide for herself. 
Figuring out how to breast-feed takes an incredible commitment, so don’t feel 
pressured to do it if your heart isn’t in it or if the thought of doing it makes 
you feel stressed or uncomfortable. If you decide that bottle-feeding is the 
best decision for you and your baby, don’t feel guilty about it.

252
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
You may hear that breast-feeding offers the best opportunity for a mother to 
bond with her baby, but bottle-feeding can also be a very warm and loving 
way to interact with your baby — not only for the mother but also for her 
partner and whoever else may be helping care for the baby. And although 
breast-feeding offers certain undeniable benefits, the vast majority of 
bottle-fed babies is — and remains — perfectly healthy.
This section looks at these two options a bit closer and helps you make a 
decision that’s right for you. Whatever your decision, make it before you 
deliver, so that you have adequate time to prepare for the moment when 
your baby starts feeding. Some women elect to try out breast-feeding for a 
little while to see how they like it. Some decide from the beginning to use a 
combination of both breast and bottle (filling the bottle with either formula 
or breast milk that has been pumped and refrigerated).
Sizing up the advantages of breast-feeding
Breast-feeding gives your baby a tailor-made formula for good nutrition and a 
whole lot more. The following are some advantages to breast-feeding:
 
✓ Human breast milk can strengthen the baby’s immune system and help 
reduce the risk of allergies, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS). It can also decrease the number of upper respiratory infections 
in the baby’s first year of life.
 
✓ Mother’s milk contains nutrients that are ideally suited to a baby’s 
digestive system. Cow’s milk isn’t as easily digested, and your baby can’t 
readily use the nutrients it contains.
 
✓ Human milk also contains substances that help protect a baby from 
infections until his own immune system matures. These substances are 
especially plentiful in the colostrum that mothers’ breasts secrete during 
the first few days after the baby is born.
 
✓ Babies are more likely to have an allergic reaction to cow’s milk than to 
mother’s milk.
 
✓ Breast-feeding is emotionally rewarding. Many women feel that they 
develop a special bond with their baby when they breast-feed, and they 
enjoy the closeness surrounding the whole experience.
 
✓ Breast-feeding is convenient. You can’t leave home without it. You never 
have to carry bottles or formula with you.
 
✓ Mother’s milk is cheaper than formula and bottles.
 
✓ You don’t have to warm up breast milk; it’s always the perfect 
temperature.

253
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
 
✓ Breast-feeding provides some degree of birth control (although it’s not 
totally reliable — see the section “Looking at birth control options”).
 
✓ Lactation (milk production) causes you to burn extra calories, which 
may help you lose some of the weight you gained during pregnancy.
 
✓ A breast-fed baby’s bowel movements don’t have as strong an odor as 
those of babies who formula-feed.
 
✓ Breast milk is pretty much organic — no additives, no preservatives.
 
✓ Some studies suggest that women who breast-feed may reduce their 
lifetime risk of breast cancer.
Checking out the benefits of bottle-feeding
Bottle-feeding also offers plenty of benefits. You may decide to choose this 
option for any of the following reasons:
 
✓ You don’t want to breast-feed. If your heart isn’t in it, it ain’t gonna 
happen. Too much trial and error is involved in making breast-feeding 
work for someone who’s not truly committed to succeeding.
 
✓ You’ve tried breast-feeding, and your breasts don’t produce enough milk 
to feed your baby (or babies!).
 
✓ Bottle-feeding may better fit your lifestyle. Although many working 
mothers breast-feed, many feel that juggling the requirements of their 
job with those of breast-feeding is just too difficult.
 
✓ Some women find the whole concept of feeding their baby a “bodily 
secretion” unpleasant.
 
✓ Bottle-feeding enables others to feed the baby.
 
✓ If you have a chronic infection — HIV, for example — bottle-feeding 
helps ensure that you don’t pass the infection to the baby via breast 
milk. Women who carry the hepatitis B virus can breast-feed as long as 
the baby has received the hepatitis B vaccine.
 
✓ If you or your baby is very sick after delivery, bottle-feeding may be your 
only option. A mother or baby who’s in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
because of a complicated delivery often can’t initiate breast-feeding. The 
mother can use a mechanical pump to empty the milk from her breasts 
and freeze the milk to feed to the baby up to six months later. Even 
if the baby can’t use the pumped milk at this time, pumping at least 
keeps the supply of milk flowing. Occasionally, a mother can restart the 
flow of milk later on, when she or the baby recovers, but this option 
isn’t always possible and often requires the assistance of a lactation 
specialist.

254
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
✓ If you’ve had previous surgery on your breasts, bottle-feeding may be 
your best bet (you may not be able to lactate). No medical evidence 
indicates that lactation has any effect on the progression of breast 
cancer after it has already been diagnosed, but some women who have 
had surgery or other treatment for breast cancer are unable to lactate. 
Also, some evidence suggests that women who have had breast implants 
produce less milk. However, many of these women produce some milk 
and can still breast-feed.
 
✓ If you take certain medications, bottle-feeding may be best. Some women 
take medications that can pass through the breast milk and affect 
the baby adversely. Such drugs include anti-cancer and anti-leukemia 
drugs (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubacin, methotrexate, and 
cyclosporin), Parlodel, (bromocriptine), lithium, and some migraine 
treatments (ergotamine, specifically). Ask your doctor about any 
medications you take regularly.
Latching onto Breast-Feeding
Pregnancy goes a long way toward preparing your body for breast-feeding. 
The key pregnancy hormones cause the breasts to enlarge and prepare 
the glands inside the breasts to lactate. But you can prepare yourself for 
day-to-day nursing. You can, for example, toughen your nipples a bit — and 
thus minimize soreness later on — in a few different ways:
 
✓ Wear a nursing bra with the flaps down (allowing your clothing to rub 
against your nipples).
 
✓ Roll your nipples between your thumb and forefinger for a minute or 
so each day.
 
✓ Rub your nipples briskly with a terry washcloth after bathing or 
showering.
 
Be aware, however, that stimulating your nipples late in your pregnancy can 
elicit uterine contractions. When you are near the end of your pregnancy, 
ask your practitioner before doing this kind of stimulation. One way to get 
around this problem is to avoid the nipple itself and just rub petroleum jelly, 
an antibacterial ointment, or baby oil over the areola.
 
Some women have inverted nipples and worry during pregnancy that their 
nipples will make breast-feeding difficult. Usually, the problem corrects itself 
before the baby is born, but a few techniques can help things along:
 
✓ Use the thumb and forefinger on one hand to push back the skin around 
the areola. If this doesn’t bring out the nipple, gently grasp it with 
your other thumb and forefinger, pull it outward, and hold it for a few 
minutes, as shown in Figure 14-1. Do this exercise several times a day.

255
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
 
✓ You can also try wearing special plastic breast cups (available at most 
drugstores) designed to help draw out the nipple over time.
Start one of these preparation techniques for short sessions during the 
second trimester and then gradually increase the amount of time you work 
your nipples or wear the cups until your nipples stay out on their own.

ing inverted 
nipples.
 
Inverted nipple
Looking at the mechanics of lactation
The flood of estrogen and progesterone that your body experiences during 
pregnancy causes your breasts to grow — sometimes to astonishing size. 
This growth starts early, within three to four weeks of conception, which is 
why the first sign of pregnancy for many women is breast tenderness. As 
pregnancy progresses, small amounts of serum-like fluid can leak from the 
nipples. But serious milk production doesn’t start until after the baby is born.
During the first days after delivery, the breasts secrete only a yellowish fluid 
known as colostrum, which doesn’t contain much milk but is rich in antibod-
ies and protective cells from the mother’s bloodstream. These substances 
help the newborn fight off infections until his own immune system matures 
and can take over. Colostrum is gradually replaced by milk.

Don’t be alarmed if your baby doesn’t seem to get much milk during the first 
few days. The colostrum is very beneficial on its own. Your baby probably 
doesn’t even have much of an appetite until he is three to four days old. And 
he is likely to need the first few days to practice sucking movements.

256
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
When your baby starts sucking on your breasts, it signals your brain to have 
the breasts produce milk. About three or four days after delivery, milk 
production sets in. When milk enters the ducts, the breasts become engorged 
with milk (see Figure 14-2). The engorgement can be so great that your 
breasts feel rock-hard and sometimes very tender. Don’t worry, though. 
When your baby starts feeding regularly and your milk starts flowing, the 
engorgement is no longer so intense. The letdown reflex (milk entering the 
ducts) occurs each time your baby feeds. After you have been nursing for a 
while, you may find that the mere sound of your baby crying or the feel of 
your baby cuddling next to you can trigger the reflex.
 
Lactating women typically produce about 600 milliliters (10 ounces) of milk 
per day by the end of the first postpartum week. This increases to about 800 
milliliters (14 ounces) by the end of the third week and peaks at 1½   to 2 liters 
(25 to 35 ounces).

Checking out breast-feeding positions
You can breast-feed in one of three basic positions, as shown in Figure 14-3. 
Use whichever position works and is comfortable for you and your baby. 
Most women alternate among the positions.
 
✓ Cradling: The simplest way is to cradle your baby in your arms with his 
head next to the bend in your elbow and tilted a bit toward your breast. 
(See Figure 14-3a.)

257
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
 
✓ Lying down: Lie on your side in bed with the baby next to you. Support 
the baby with your lower arm or pillows so that his mouth is next to 
your lower breast, and use your other arm to guide your baby’s mouth 
to the nipple. This position is best for late-night feedings or after a 
cesarean delivery when sitting up is still uncomfortable. (See Figure 
14-3b.) One concern about breast-feeding while in bed is that you may 
fall asleep and unknowingly roll over your baby. You may decide to 
keep a cradle or crib next to your bed so you can put your baby back to 
sleep right after you finish feeding, without disrupting your night’s sleep 
too much.

basic 
positions

feeding.

Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
✓ Football hold: Cradle your baby’s head in the palm of your hand and 
support the body with your forearm. Placing a pillow underneath your 
arm for extra support may help in this position. You can use your free 
hand to hold your breast close to the baby’s mouth. (See Figure 14-3c.)
Getting the baby to latch on
If you choose to breast-feed, you can get started immediately after delivery, 
wherever you happen to be — the birthing room, the delivery room, or the 
recovery room. Begin as soon as the nurses have checked your baby’s health 
and your baby has settled down a bit from the delivery. Expect to feel a little 
awkward at first, and try not to get too frustrated. Many babies don’t want to 
breast-feed immediately. Have patience — you and your baby will eventually 
get the hang of it.
Babies are born with a suckling reflex, but many of them don’t follow it 
enthusiastically right off the bat. Sometimes babies need some coaxing to 
latch onto the breast:
 
1. Arrange yourself and your baby in one of the basic breast-feeding 
positions (see the preceding section).
 
2. Gently stroke the baby’s lips or cheek with your nipple.
 
 This action usually causes the baby to open his mouth. If your baby 
doesn’t seem to want to open his mouth, try expressing (gently pressing 
out) a little milk — colostrum, really — and rubbing some on the baby’s 
lips.
 
3. When the baby’s mouth is wide open, bring his head to your breast 
and gently place his mouth over your entire nipple.
 
 This prodding usually causes the baby to start sucking. Make sure that 
the entire areola is inside the baby’s mouth, because if it isn’t, he 
doesn’t get enough milk and you get sore nipples. However, don’t stuff 
your breast into your baby’s mouth. Rather, bring the mouth to your 
nipple, and let the infant take in the breast.
 
The tip of the baby’s nose should be barely touching the skin around your 
breast. The only way the baby can breathe while feeding is through his nose, 
so be careful not to completely cover the baby’s nose with your breast. If your 
breast obstructs the baby’s nose, use your free hand to depress your breast in 
front of his nose to let some air in.

 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
Orchestrating feedings
After your baby latches on, you know that he is sucking when you see regu-
lar, rhythmic movements of the cheeks and chin. Several minutes of sucking 
may go by before your milk letdown occurs. In the beginning, let your baby 
feed for about five minutes on each breast per nursing session. Over the 
course of the first three or four days, increase the amount of time on each 
breast to 10 to 15 minutes. Don’t get too hung up about timing the feedings, 
though; your baby lets you know when he has had enough by not sucking 
and letting your nipple slip away.
 
If your baby stops sucking without letting go of your nipple, insert your finger 
into the corner of his mouth to break the suction. (If you just pull your breast 
straight out, you’ll end up with sore nipples.)
When switching from one breast to the other, stop to burp your baby by 
laying him either over your shoulder or your lap and gently patting his back. 
Figure 14-4 shows you some of the various burping positions. Burp him again 
when the feeding is finished.
Typically, mothers initially breast-feed about eight to twelve times a day 
(averaging ten). This pattern enables your body to produce an optimal 
amount of milk, and it allows your baby to get the proper amount of nutrition 
for healthy growth and development. Try to space the feedings fairly evenly 
throughout the day; of course, your baby has some influence on the sched-
ule. You don’t have to wake your baby for a feeding — unless your pediatri-
cian specifically advises you to do so. You especially don’t have to wake your 
baby at night; if the baby’s willing to sleep through, just count yourself lucky. 
Nor do you have any reason to withhold a feeding if your baby is hungry — 
even if only an hour or so has passed since the last feeding. (Also keep in 
mind that the number of feedings in a day may be less than average if you 
supplement breast-feeding with some formula feedings.)
You can tell that your baby is getting enough milk if your baby
 
✓ Nurses ten times a day on average
 
✓ Gains weight
 
✓ Has six to eight wet diapers a day
 
✓ Has two to three bowel movements a day
 
✓ Produces urine that’s pale yellow (not dark and concentrated)

If your baby isn’t meeting these criteria or if you have any concern that your 
baby isn’t getting enough milk, call your pediatrician. Some women, no matter 
how diligent they are, need to supplement breast milk with formula because 
they just can’t produce enough breast milk to totally meet their baby’s needs.

 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
Maintaining your diet
During breast-feeding, as during pregnancy, your nutrition is largely a 
matter of educated common sense. Your breast milk’s quality isn’t signifi-
cantly affected by your diet unless your eating habits are truly inadequate. 
However, if you don’t take in enough calories or water, your body has a 
difficult time producing adequate milk. You may also find that your baby 
reacts a different way to certain foods. For example, he may be extra gassy 
if you’ve eaten particular foods. If you pay attention to how your baby 
responds to different foods, you can figure out what foods to avoid.
 
Breast-feeding women should take in 400 to 600 calories a day more than they 
would normally eat. The exact amount varies according to how much you 
weigh and how much fat you gained during pregnancy. Because lactating does 
burn fat, breast-feeding helps get rid of some of the extra fat stores you may 
have. But avoid losing weight too fast, or your milk production will suffer. 
Also, avoid gaining weight while you’re breast-feeding. If you find that you’re 
putting on more pounds, you’re most likely taking in too many calories or not 
exercising enough.
You also need extra vitamins and minerals — especially vitamin D, calcium, 
and iron. Keep taking your prenatal vitamins or some other balanced 
supplement while you’re nursing. Also consume extra calcium — either a 
supplement or extra servings of milk, yogurt, and other dairy products.
Breast milk is mainly water (87 percent). To produce plenty of breast milk, 
you must take in at least 72 ounces of fluid per day, which is about nine 
glasses of milk, juice, or water. Don’t go overboard, however, because if you 
drink too many fluids, your milk production may actually decrease. You 
also don’t want to markedly increase your calorie intake with high-sugar, 
high-carbohydrate, or high-calorie fluids. A good way to tell whether you’re 
getting the right amount of fluid is to monitor your urine output. If you 
urinate infrequently or if the color is a deep yellow, you probably aren’t 
getting enough. If you constantly run to the bathroom, you may be drinking 
too much.
 
If you find that your baby is fussy and has a hard time sleeping, you may be 
consuming too much caffeine. Try cutting back on the coffee or cola until 
you find the level your baby tolerates.
Looking at birth control options
Although breast-feeding decreases the likelihood of ovulation, it by no means 
guarantees that you won’t become pregnant. For a woman who chooses 
not to breast-feed, it takes an average of 10 weeks after the birth to resume 
ovulation — that is, to become fertile again. About 10 percent of women 

262
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
who do breast-feed also begin ovulating again after 10 weeks, and about 
50 percent start up again by 25 weeks — about six months — after their 
babies are born. Clearly, breast-feeding isn’t a great form of birth control.
Before you resume intercourse, consider using some effective form of birth 
control, because chances are you don’t want to become pregnant again right 
away. You can use birth control pills (some are okay with breast-feeding), 
barrier methods (condoms, a diaphragm, and so on), or long-acting proges-
terone shots (such as Depo-Provera). Discuss your options with your 
practitioner at your six-week checkup.
Determining which medications are safe
Just about any medication you take gets into your breast milk, but usually 
only in tiny amounts. If you need to take a medication while breast-feeding, 
try taking the lowest dose possible and, as a rule, take it just after you 
finish a breast-feeding session. That way, your body breaks down most of 
the medication by the time you need to breast-feed again. In general, don’t 
deprive yourself of medications that you really need just because you’re 
afraid that some of it may get to the baby and cause harm. Check with 
your doctor about medications to be sure that they’re fine to take while 
breast-feeding.
The following medications are okay to take while breast-feeding:
 
✓ Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol)
 
✓ Antacids
 
✓ Most antibiotics
 
✓ Most antidepressants
 
✓ Antihistamines
 
✓ Aspirin
 
✓ Most asthma medications
 
✓ Decongestants
 
✓ Most high blood pressure medications
 
✓ Ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin)
 
✓ Insulin
 
✓ Most seizure medications
 
✓ Most thyroid medications

263
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
Handling common problems
One of the greatest misconceptions about breast-feeding is that it comes 
easily and naturally to everyone. Breast-feeding takes practice. Problems 
can range from a little nipple soreness to, in rare cases, infections in the 
milk ducts.
Sore nipples
Many women experience some temporary nipple soreness during the first 
few days that they breast-feed. For most women, the pain is mild, and it goes 
away on its own. For some, however, the soreness gets progressively worse 
and can lead to chapped or cracked nipples and moderate to severe pain. If 
your breasts are heading in this direction, take action before your suffering 
gets out of hand. The following list outlines some remedies:
 
✓ Review your technique to make sure that your baby is positioned 
correctly. If the baby isn’t getting the entire nipple and areola in his 
mouth, the soreness is likely to continue. Try changing the baby’s 
position slightly with each feeding.
 
✓ Increase the number of feedings and feed for less time at each feeding. 
This way, your baby won’t be as hungry and may not suck as hard.
 
✓ Definitely continue to feed on the sore breast, even if only for a few 
minutes, to keep the nipple conditioned to nursing. If you let it heal 
completely, the soreness will only start all over again when you feed 
from that nipple again. We suggest that you feed on the least sore breast 
first, because that’s when your baby’s sucking is most vigorous.
 
✓ Express a little breast milk manually before you put the baby to the 
breast. This action helps initiate the letdown reflex so that the baby 
doesn’t have to suck as long and hard to achieve letdown.
 
✓ Don’t use any irritating chemicals or soaps on your nipples.
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “Can I breast-feed while I’m on the Pill?”
A: It’s fine, although it may affect the amount of 
milk you produce. Pills that contain estrogen 
decrease the amount of milk that you produce, 
and if you take them too soon after giving birth, 
they may make it difficult for your body to start 
milk production. However, after breast-feeding 
is well established, they’re fine. Some women 
find that the newer progestin-only pills are a 
better alternative — they have less effect 
on milk production, but they’re slightly less 
effective.

264
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
✓ After your baby finishes feeding, don’t wipe off your nipples. Let them 
air-dry for as long as possible. Wiping them with a cloth may cause 
needless irritation.
 
✓ Exposing the nipples to air helps to toughen the skin, so try to walk 
around the house with your nipples exposed as much as possible. If you 
wear a nursing bra, leave the flaps open while you’re at home. Your 
nipples toughen from the fabric of your clothes rubbing against them.
 
✓ If you’re using pads to soak up leakage from your breasts, change them 
as soon as they get moist, or they may chafe your nipples.
 
✓ Try massaging vitamin E oil or ointment, olive oil, or lanolin into sore 
nipples and then letting them air dry. Udder Cream and Bag Balm, 
products developed to treat chapped teats on milk cows (yes, cows), 
have found new popularity among breast-feeding women. Many 
drugstores and cosmetics stores now sell the creams.
 
✓ Apply dry (not moist) and warm (not hot) heat to the nipples several 
times a day. You can use a hot water bottle filled with warm water.
Pain from breast engorgement
As we mention earlier, when the breasts become engorged with milk, they 
can hurt. One way to avoid painful engorgement is to begin breast-feeding 
right after the baby is born. Other strategies that help include wearing a 
firm, but not tight, bra and massaging the breasts before feeding. Massaging 
facilitates letdown and relieves some of the engorgement. You can also try 
placing warm compresses on your breasts. (Some women feel that ice packs 
work better — try both and see which works best for you.)
Clogged ducts
Sometimes, some of the milk ducts in the breast become clogged with debris. 
If this happens, a small, firm, red lump may form inside the breast. The lump 
may be tender, but it’s usually not associated with a fever or excruciating 
pain. The best way to treat a clogged breast duct is to try to completely 
empty that breast after each feeding. Start the baby out on that breast when 
he is most hungry. If the baby doesn’t completely empty the breast, use a 
breast pump on that side until all the milk is drained. Applying heat to the 
lump and massaging it manually is helpful. You can also try letting the 
spray from a warm shower fall on your breast to promote milk release. Most 
important, keep feeding.
 
If the lump persists for more than a few days, call your doctor to make sure 
that you’re not developing an abscess.
Mastitis (breast infection)
Breast infections (mastitis) occur in about 2 percent of all breast-feeding 
women. Bacteria from the baby’s mouth usually cause the infections, which 
are most likely to happen two to four weeks after delivery (but can occur 

265
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
earlier or later than that). Infections are more common in women who are 
breast-feeding for the first time, who have chapped nipples with cracks or 
fissures, and who don’t empty their breasts completely at feedings.
 
The symptoms of mastitis include a warm, hard, red breast; high fever (usu-
ally over 101 degrees Fahrenheit); and malaise (like when you have the flu and 
your whole body feels achy). The infection in the breast may be diffused, or it 
may be localized to a particular segment of the breast (known as a lobule). If 
the infection is localized, the redness may appear as a wedge-shaped area 
over the infected portion of the breast (see Figure 14-5). If these symptoms 
develop, call your doctor immediately. More than likely, he will prescribe an 
antibiotic and may even want you to come into the office for an examination.
 
Continue to breast-feed your baby while you have the infection. It’s not harm-
ful to the baby; after all, the bacteria probably came from the baby’s mouth. If 
you stop breast-feeding, the breast becomes engorged, making your discom-
fort even worse. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol), ibuprofen, or warm 
compresses may help relieve the pain from mastitis while the antibiotics take 
effect (usually in about two days). Drink plenty of fluids, and get as much rest 
as you can to allow your body’s natural healing powers to work. Take your 
medication for the fully prescribed amount of time to help make sure that the 
infection doesn’t recur.

Breast abscess
If mastitis isn’t treated aggressively or if a milk duct remains clogged, a 
breast abscess can develop. In fact, breast abscesses form in as many as 10 
percent of all cases of mastitis. Symptoms of a breast abscess are extreme 
pain, heat and swelling over the area of the abscess, and high fevers (over 
101 degrees Fahrenheit). Sometimes doctors can treat abscesses with 
antibiotics, but often the abscess needs to be drained surgically.
 
If you develop a breast abscess, you can continue to breast-feed on the other 
side, but you should stop feeding on the side of the abscess until the problem 
subsides. Check with your doctor before resuming feedings on that side.
Breast-feeding twins
It may seem daunting, but some women with twins successfully breast-feed. 
Your body can make enough milk for two babies at once, especially if you’re 
persistent and work up your milk production to a high level. Even so, arriving 
at a system that works for you takes some experimentation. You may breast-
feed both babies at once or each one separately. The advantage to the first 
alternative is that you don’t spend all your time breast-feeding, but the

267
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
second method is easier. You don’t have to deal with one baby finishing first 
and needing to be burped while the other one is still sucking. (Holding one 
baby over your shoulder and keeping another one at your breast can be very 
tricky, no matter how many pillows and props you use.) You may breast-feed 
one baby, bottle-feed the other, and then alternate at the next feeding. You 
may breast-feed each baby a little at each feeding and then supplement with 
the bottle. Or you may breast-feed both babies for most of the day and then 
supplement with a bottle before bedtime when your milk supply is low.
Women who breast-feed twins need to take in even more extra calories and 
fluids. You need about 400 to 600 extra calories per day for each baby you 
are breast-feeding. (Imagine how much you’d have to consume to breast-feed 
triplets!) Also, you need to increase your fluid intake from eight to ten glasses 
per day to about ten to twelve glasses per day.
 
If you do decide to try breast-feeding twins, count on needing help from other 
family members and friends. Don’t be afraid to ask for it.
Bottle-Feeding for Beginners
Suppose you’ve decided to forego breast-feeding in favor of formula. Or 
you’ve been breast-feeding for a while, and you want to switch. In this 
section, we go over what you need to know to get your baby started on 
bottles.
Stopping milk production
If you decide to formula-feed, you need to stop the process of milk produc-
tion in your breasts. Milk production is triggered by warmth and breast 
stimulation. To stop the production of milk, create the opposite environment. 
Here are some suggestions:
 
✓ Wear a tight-fitting bra.
 
✓ Apply ice packs to your breasts when they become engorged (usually 
around the third or fourth day after your baby is born).
 
✓ Keep ice packs inside your bra, or use small packages of frozen vegeta-
bles, like peas or corn, which you can easily fold to fit within a bra. 
(We don’t recommend going out in public this way, though.)
 
✓ Place cold cabbage leaves inside your bra. Cabbage works chemically to 
reduce the production of milk.
 
✓ Let cold water run over your breasts during a shower.

268
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
 
If you’re going to breast-feed for a short period of time (6 to 12 weeks), 
consider giving your baby one bottle of formula per day while nursing to help 
make the transition easier.
Engorged breasts can be very uncomfortable. If you’re in a great deal of 
discomfort, you may want to ask your doctor about pain medication. 
Fortunately, the engorgement usually lasts only 36 to 48 hours and seldom 
requires medical help.
Choosing the best bottles and nipples
 
You won’t have any trouble finding a wide choice of bottles and nipples. Some 
babies definitely demonstrate a preference for one type of bottle or nipple 
over another. You may have to experiment to discover the tools that work 
best for you and your baby. Four-ounce bottles are good for the first few 
weeks or months. Later, when your baby drinks a larger amount, you can 
switch to the larger eight-ounce bottles.
 
✓ Some bottles are actually plastic holders in which you insert little trans-
parent plastic bags that hold the milk or formula. The advantage of this 
type is that you can throw away the empty milk bag, and you don’t 
have to worry about sterilizing the plastic container. Also, because the 
plastic bag is designed to collapse, less air gets into the bag and into the 
baby’s stomach.
 
✓ Some bottles are angled, which also helps to allow less air to be taken in 
by the baby, leading to less gas.
 
✓ Nipples come in a wide variety. Newborn nipples have a smaller hole, 
and the size of the hole increases with the age of the baby (nipples 
generally come in newborn, 3- and 6-month sizes, and then larger ones 
for older babies). Orthodontic nipples are designed for a more natural 
fit. Some nipples are made out of latex, and others of silicone. Silicone 
nipples are clear, have less of an odor, and are firmer. Your baby may 
demonstrate a strong preference for one type over another or may not 
notice much of a difference.
Feeding your baby from a bottle
Your mother, grandmother, or any number of well-intentioned friends may 
tell you to sterilize bottles by boiling them in water. But we — and most 
pediatricians — think that this step is unnecessary. After all, a mother who 
breast-feeds doesn’t have to boil her nipples!
Many parents choose to warm their baby’s bottle, but heating it isn’t neces-
sary. You can warm a bottle in different ways. You can place the bottle in a 
container filled with hot water or use a bottle warmer.

269
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
 
If you use the microwave to heat your baby’s bottle, be careful. The breast 
milk or formula may heat unevenly, and some parts of it may be too hot for 
the baby. However, if you shake the bottle after warming it, it may be okay. 
Just make sure you squirt some onto your wrist to check the temperature 
first. Some formula manufacturers don’t recommend microwaving their 
product, so make sure to read the information on the side of the packaging.
Saving leftover formula or breast milk generally isn’t a good idea. However, 
some pediatricians say that reusing a bottle once is okay, so talk it over with 
your baby’s doctor. In any case, don’t leave a bottle filled with milk sitting 
outside the refrigerator for very long, because warmth encourages the 
growth of bacteria that can upset your baby’s stomach.
Your choice of formula is one you should make with your pediatrician. Call 
her office prior to delivery and find out what she suggests you use. Many 
formulas come premixed, but some come in either a powder or concentrated 
liquid form, both of which require you to add water. The powder and concen-
trated liquid forms cost less, but they may not be available in as wide a 
variety of formulas.
Now all kinds of formulas are available, including organic formulas. The 
jury is still out as to whether there are clear medical benefits. Organic 
formulas may be more costly, and some have extra sugar, so check with 
your pediatrician about whether organic is the way to go.
 
Some babies develop an allergic reaction to their formula; they may have an 
upset stomach or get a skin rash. If your baby becomes allergic, talk with 
your pediatrician. He may want to switch your baby to a soy-based formula or 
some other hypoallergenic formula.
 
Pediatricians generally recommend against propping up a baby’s bottle by 
laying it on a pillow next to the baby’s mouth because propping implies that 
the baby is being left unattended. Also, laying a baby flat on his back with the 
bottle propped creates more potential for choking. Propping a bottle may also 
promote tooth decay.
The most common position for bottle-feeding your baby is to hold the baby 
cradled in one arm, close to your body. Put a pillow on your lap, which eases 
the strain on your arms and neck. Most parents find it easier to always hold 
the baby in the same arm and in the same direction. For example, if you’re 
right-handed, you may want to hold your baby in your left arm and the bottle 
in the right. When the baby is a little older and has better control of his head 
and neck muscles, you may want to lay him in front of you along your legs for 
a change of pace. This way, you and your baby can make eye contact.

270
Part III: The Big Event: Labor, Delivery, and Recovery 
Here are some other tips for moms who are bottle-feeding (whether with 
formula or breast milk):
 
✓ Don’t swaddle the baby too much or keep him too warm during feeding. 
The baby may get so comfortable that he falls asleep instead of feeding.
 
✓ Change the baby’s diaper in the middle of a feeding. This may help to 
wake him up, so that he can finish the rest of the bottle.
 
✓ If your baby has trouble finding the nipple to put in his mouth, stroke 
his cheek, and he will turn in that direction.
 
✓ To check to see whether your baby is hungry, put the tip of your finger 
(a clean finger) into his mouth to see whether he starts to suck.
 
✓ Keep the bottle tilted in such a way as to completely fill the nipple with 
the formula, thereby minimizing the amount of air your baby gets.
 
Burp your baby at least once midway through a feeding and again at the end 
of a feeding. (Refer to Figure 14-4 for various burping positions.) Babies often 
take in air along with the milk or formula they drink, and burping helps them 
to get rid of it. It makes them more comfortable and able to eat more.
Dealing with Baby’s Developing 
Digestive System
Your baby has a brand-new digestive system, and one that requires consider-
able breaking-in. Long story short: Babies spit up. A lot. Whether they’re 
breast-fed or bottle-fed, newborn babies are likely to vomit as often as two 
times per day. Try these suggestions for dealing with this phenomenon:
 
✓ Keep a cloth over your shoulder when burping or holding your baby so 
that you don’t have to constantly change, or ruin, your clothes.
 
✓ Keep a small bib on your baby during and after feeding so that you don’t 
have to constantly change, or ruin, all the baby’s clothes.
 
✓ Burp your baby after each feeding. Refer to Figure 14-4 to see some of 
the most common positions.
 
✓ If you’re bottle-feeding, stop partway through the bottle to burp 
the baby, rather than allowing the baby to drink the entire bottle in 
one shot.
 
✓ Don’t play with the baby too much after feeding. Jiggling the baby or 
moving the baby around a lot can lead to more spitting up.
 
✓ If your baby seems to be spitting up large quantities or if the spitting up 
is very forceful, let your pediatrician know.

271
 Chapter 14: Feeding Your Baby
Sometimes, spitting up or vomiting several times a day can be a sign of 
something as simple as overfeeding, or it may indicate a condition known as 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, which is a digestive disorder 
caused by gastric acid from the stomach flowing into the esophagus. It is 
common in babies, although it can occur at any age. If your newborn is 
showing symptoms such as pain when spitting up, irritability, inconsolable 
crying, gagging, choking, or refusal to eat, you should definitely speak to 
your pediatrician.
Your pediatrician diagnoses GERD by conducting a medical history, physical 
exam, and certain diagnostic tests. These tests may include an upper gastro-
intestinal series, endoscopy (placement of a flexible tube with a light and 
camera lens into the organs of the upper digestive system), pH testing, and 
gastric emptying studies.
The need for treatment for reflux may depend upon your baby’s age, overall 
health and medical history, the extent of the problem, and your baby’s 
tolerance for specific medications, procedures, and treatments. Sometimes 
reflux can be improved through feeding changes. Try these suggestions:
 
✓ After feeding, place your baby on his stomach with his upper body ele-
vated at least 30 degrees, or hold him in a sitting position for about 30 
minutes.
 
✓ If bottle-feeding, keep the nipple filled with milk or formula, so that your 
baby doesn’t swallow too much air.
 
✓ Some people believe that adding a feed thickener, such as rice cereal, 
may be beneficial for some babies who are about six months or older. 
Check with your pediatrician.
 
✓ Burp your baby frequently during feedings.

You could actually go all the way through pregnancy 
without ever reading this part, especially if you’re

your pregnancy. You develop an annoying rash. You’re hav-

gather them all into this part. More than any other segment 
of the book, we design this part for you to read in pieces, 
depending on what particular situation you’re in.

o two pregnancies are exactly alike. If you’re like most women, you 
figure out pretty early in the game that your experience is different in 
some way from every friend and relative you talk to. You’re not as nauseous 
as your sister was during the first three months — or your morning sickness 
is 20 times worse than your best friend’s. You feel comfortable exercising 
throughout your pregnancy, although your Cousin Millie was put on bed rest. 
Plenty of variation occurs within the boundaries of what is considered to be 
a “normal” pregnancy. But some special kinds of pregnancies come with their 
own particular characteristics and challenges. This chapter focuses on them.
Figuring Out How Age Matters
Whether you’re a prospective father or mother, age can make a difference — 
as many baby boomers are now finding out. Special problems and issues 
arise for men and women in their late 30s and older who are preparing to 
have children. Teen moms also face unique challenges. This section covers 
these challenges.

Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Over-30 something moms
Long gone are the days when almost all pregnant women were in their early 
20s — and many were in their teens. Now, a greater number of women post-
pone having families until they’ve not only finished their education, but 
also have had time to become established in their careers. These days, too, 
divorce is more common, and many women find themselves having children 
with a second husband — often when they’re well into their 30s or 40s (and 
sometimes 50s).
How old is too old? The answer used to be when you reach menopause — or 
even some years earlier — when your body no longer produces healthy eggs 
that can be fertilized to become embryos. But today, because of advances in 
assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF), which may 
use eggs donated by another woman, even women who are past the age of 
menopause can become pregnant.
 
Today, a more useful question is “At what age do you need to watch out for 
special problems?” And here, the answer is more specific. Any woman who is 
at least 35 years old during her pregnancy falls into the medical category of 
advanced maternal age, or AMA. (An impersonal term, to be sure, but perhaps 
less insulting than the alternatives that are also used: older gravida, mature 
gravida, and the particularly unfortunate elderly gravida.) The reason for 
singling out older mothers with any special term at all is that the incidence of 
certain chromosomal abnormalities increases with advancing maternal age. At 
age 35, the risks begin to increase significantly, as shown in Figure 15-1.
Doctors formerly concluded that at age 35, the risk of the fetus carrying some 
chromosomal abnormality was great enough to equal the risk of pregnancy 
loss after undergoing amniocentesis (about 0.5 percent at that time). Genetic 
testing — either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling — was routinely 
offered for pregnant women older than 35 in the United States. Some practi-
tioners still adhere to the traditional age 35 dictum, but the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends women of all ages be 
offered the option of screening for Down syndrome — either by nuchal trans-
lucency screening, chorionic villus sampling, or amniocentesis (see Chapter 
8 for details on all three).
The good news is that except for this increase in certain chromosomal abnor-
malities, babies born to women older than 35, or even older than 40, are as 
likely as any other babies to be healthy. The moms themselves do stand a 
higher-than-average risk of developing preeclampsia or gestational diabetes 
(see Chapters 16 and 17), and they stand an increased risk of delivering early 

277
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
or needing a cesarean delivery. But these risks aren’t terribly high, and, in 
most cases, any problems that result are minor. Naturally, an older woman’s 
experience with pregnancy depends to a large extent on her underlying 
health. If a woman is 48 years old or even 50, but she is in excellent health, 
she is likely to do extremely well.

Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Not-so-young dads
As we mention earlier, pregnancies in older women call for some special 
scrutiny because of the increased risk of genetic complications. To some 
extent, pregnancies involving older dads should likewise be singled out for 
observation. There is no absolute age cutoff for “advanced paternal age,” but 
many people use 45 or 50 (although some argue it should be 35, just as it is 
for women).
Whereas for women the main genetic risk is having a fetus with a chromo-
somal abnormality (most commonly an extra chromosome), for men the risk 
is spontaneous gene mutations in the sperm, which can lead to a child with 
an autosomal dominant disorder, such as achondroplasia (a type of dwarf-
ism) or neurofibromatosis. Only one copy of an abnormal gene can cause this 
kind of problem. (In so-called recessive genetic disorders — cystic fibrosis 
and sickle-cell anemia, for example — two copies of the abnormal gene are 
required for the problem to occur.) Autosomal dominant disorders are very 
rare, however, and many are impossible to test for, which is why no routine 
testing exists for advanced paternal age.
A word about alternative conceptions
Thanks to assisted-reproductive technolo-
gies, more and more women older than 40 are 
becoming pregnant, some even with twins or 
triplets. Although many of these women con-
ceive with their own eggs, many others con-
ceive with someone else’s. These women have 
unique issues to deal with, including what to tell 
their future children, friends, and family. Some, 
when they’re pregnant, experience internal 
conflicts about the baby’s genetic identity; they 
worry about what the fact that their baby is bio-
logically related to someone else may mean. 
But often, these concerns disappear when the 
woman begins to feel her baby moving around 
inside her, and if not then, as soon as the baby 
is born.
Parents — even parents of children conceived 
the old-fashioned way — often discover after 
they meet their new baby in person that each 
child’s identity is unique, and that the exact 
genetic ancestry doesn’t matter nearly as much 
as they may have thought it would. So it makes 
sense that women who have had children con-
ceived with donor eggs typically find that, after 
only a few days of caring for the new baby, 
they feel every bit as maternal as any biologi-
cal mother would. The same is true of fathers of 
children who have been conceived with donor 
sperm. As the number of people having children 
with donated eggs or sperm grows, the whole 
experience is likely to become more comfort-
able for everyone involved.

279
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
Very young moms
Pregnancy in teenage women raises a different set of concerns. Although this 
age group doesn’t sustain any increase in chromosomal abnormalities, these 
women may experience a higher incidence of some birth defects. Because 
teenage moms tend to have less-than-optimal nutritional habits, they also 
experience a higher incidence of low-birth-weight babies. Teenage moms are 
also at a higher risk of developing preeclampsia, are more likely to deliver 
by cesarean delivery, and are less likely to breast-feed. Due to their unique 
situation, young moms need special guidance and counseling. If you’re a teen-
age mom, we encourage you to receive adequate prenatal care, to follow a 
healthy diet, and to consider the benefits of breast-feeding.
Having Twins or More
Having twins may seem simple — to someone who’s never faced the reality of 
it. It’s either “double the pleasure” or a living nightmare (twice the work and 
only half the sleep). Twins are complicated, as any mother of twins can tell 
you — for hours and hours, if you’re willing to listen. A sizable part of having 
twins, triplets, or more is the experience of pregnancy.
 
If you’re having triplets or more, what applies to twins generally applies to 
triplets (and more), only to a much greater extent.
Although the vast majority of twin pregnancies proceed smoothly and result 
in the birth of two beautiful, healthy babies, some risks are involved for both 
the fetuses and the mom. As a result, most practitioners want women who 
are pregnant with twins to have checkups more frequently than other moms, 
and they may schedule plenty of extra ultrasound exams.
Ethnic background and family history can increase your chance of having 
twins; certain women are constitutionally more likely to ovulate more than 
one egg in a cycle. If twins occur in your family, let your practitioner know.
This section takes a closer look at several questions and issues you may have 
if you’re pregnant with twins.
Looking at types of multiples
Twins can be either identical or fraternal. These old-fashioned terms don’t 
completely describe how twins occur. Identical twins look very much alike 
and are always the same sex. They come from a single embryo, meaning 

280
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
they’re a product of the union of one egg and one sperm. (In other words, 
they are monozygotic — they come from the same zygote.) They have exactly 
the same genes as each other, which explains their resemblance. In the 
United States, roughly one-third of all twins are identical. An egg can split 
into three, leading to identical triplets, but it’s very unusual.
A woman conceives fraternal twins when she ovulates more than one egg, 
two different sperm fertilize two eggs, and the resulting zygotes implant 
in her uterus at the same time. These dizygotic twins — who arise from 
two zygotes — don’t share an identical set of genes. Instead, their genetic 
makeup is as similar as that of any pair of children born of the same parents. 
They’re just born at the same time. They can be the same sex, or they can be 
of opposite sexes. Roughly two-thirds of all twins conceived spontaneously 
in the United States are dizygotic. If three eggs are fertilized, the result is 
fraternal triplets. A triplet pregnancy can also consist of two fetuses that are 
monozygotic and one from a second fertilized egg — leading to two babies 
that are identical and one that is fraternal.
 
The chance that a woman will have identical twins increases after she reaches 
the age of 35. The chance a woman will have fraternal twins (because she 
ovulates more than one egg in any given month), on the other hand, rises until 
about the age of 35 and then drops off. Some families have more than their 
statistical share of fraternal twins. Some women are predisposed to ovulating 
more than one egg at a time and that can lead to fraternal twins. If a woman 
has a history of twinning on her mother’s side, she may stand a higher chance 
of twinning. Fraternal twinning also becomes more likely when a woman takes 
fertility drugs because these medications boost her chances of ovulating more 
than one egg. Of course, a woman who takes fertility drugs can still produce 
an egg that gets fertilized and then splits in two to form identical twins.
Determining whether multiples 
are identical or fraternal
Many women who are pregnant with twins ask their doctor or sonographer 
during an ultrasound exam whether she can tell whether her twins are frater-
nal or identical. In some cases, the technician or your doctor can tell: If the 
babies are two different sexes, they’re fraternal. If they’re the same sex, they 
may be either fraternal or identical. If they’re the same sex or if the fetus’ 
sexes aren’t yet visible, other findings on ultrasound can suggest whether the 
twins are identical.
 
✓ An egg that splits very early after fertilization, within the first two or 
three days, results in two embryos that have separate placentas and 

281
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
separate amniotic sacs. This situation is called diamniotic/dichorionic 
(see Figure 15-2a). On ultrasound, they look no different than fraternal 
twins that come from two separately fertilized eggs. So with twins who 
have separate placentas and are of the same sex, it’s impossible to tell 
on ultrasound if they’re identical or fraternal.
 
✓ If an egg splits between the third and eighth day after fertilization, the 
resulting twins are in two separate amniotic sacs but share a single 
placenta (see Figure 15-2b). Your doctor may use the term diamniotic/
monochorionic to describe this situation. If, on ultrasound, your doctor 
or sonographer can see that a set of twins shares a single placenta, 
chances are they’re identical. (Keep in mind, though, that sometimes 
determining whether there is one placenta or two that are very close 
together is difficult on ultrasound.) However, the thickness of the 
membrane separating the sacs gives another clue — with two separate 
placentas, a thick membrane separates the two sacs, whereas with one 
placenta, the membrane is very thin.
 
✓ An egg that splits sometime between 8 and 13 days after fertilization 
results in twins that not only share a placenta but also are in a single 
amniotic sac (see Figure 15-2c). Twins like these are called monoamniotic/
monochorionic. If your doctor does an ultrasound examination and sees 
twins sharing the same amniotic sac, she can be sure that they’re identi-
cal. This is pretty rare (1 percent of all twins, or 1 in 60,000 pregnancies).
 
✓ An egg that splits after the 13th day of gestation results in conjoined or 
“Siamese” twins, which is exceedingly rare.
The odds (and oddities) of having 
twins, triplets, or more
The number of twins conceived is much larger 
than the number of twins that are actually born. 
Many pregnancies that begin as twin pregnan-
cies end as single births because one of the 
fetuses never develops. In many cases, one of 
the fetuses disappears before the pregnancy 
is even diagnosed (the so-called vanishing 
twin). The incidence of twin births is usually 
estimated to be close to 3 percent of all births. 
However, the incidence is rising, mainly due to 
the increasing use of fertility techniques.
The incidence of spontaneous triplets is much 
rarer — about 1 in 7,000. Spontaneous quadru-
plets or more are exceedingly rare. However, 
with the increasing use of infertility treatments, 
the incidence of triplets has increased tenfold 
over the past few decades. Fortunately, though, 
the rate of increase is slowing because of 
refinements in infertility treatments.

An expert sonographer can use subtle signs to help differentiate the vari-
ous types of twins, although sometimes it still may be hard to be absolutely 
certain. The sonographer establishes whether the twins have two separate 
placentas and, of less importance, whether they’re actually fraternal or iden-
tical. Establishing the type of placentation (monochorionic or dichorionic) is 
easier in the first trimester than in the second or third trimester.

283
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
 
Because different types of twins are associated with different problems and 
risks, trying to figure out what type of twinning is present is important. If 
the ultrasound signs are ambiguous and the medical situation suggests that 
determining the type of twinning is especially important, special tests can be 
performed to answer this question. These tests are called zygosity studies and 
require an invasive procedure, such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sam-
pling (CVS), or fetal blood sampling (see Chapter 8).
Down syndrome screening in pregnancies 
with twins or more
For many years, the most common way of screening pregnancies for Down 
syndrome was by measuring different markers in the mother’s blood at 16 
weeks of pregnancy (see Chapter 8). The accuracy of this test with twins is 
fair, but with triplets or more, it doesn’t help at all. The newer method of 
Down syndrome screening in the first trimester (nuchal translucency, see 
Chapter 8) appears particularly promising for moms with multiple gestations 
because your doctor can obtain a nuchal-translucency measurement for each 
fetus, thus determining each fetus’s individual risk of having Down syndrome. 
Using the nuchal translucency and mom’s blood markers, you can detect 
about 70 to 75 percent of all cases of Down syndrome in twins. This is a little 
lower than the detection rate in single fetuses, but still pretty good. With trip-
lets or more, using the nuchal-translucency measurement alone tends to be 
the most helpful approach because it’s difficult to determine how to use the 
mother’s blood markers in this situation.
Genetic testing in pregnancies 
with twins or more
Chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis are a little trickier with twins or 
more. The two main challenges are to make sure each fetus is sampled sepa-
rately and none of the tissue taken from one fetus contaminates the tissue 
taken from the other. In the case of identical twins, this issue isn’t as criti-
cal, because the fetuses have the same genetic makeup. If you find a genetic 
abnormality (or lack of any genetic abnormalities) in one, the same is almost 
always true for the other. With fraternal twins, triplets, or more, testing each 
one separately is critical.

284
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Amniocentesis
Amniocentesis (see Chapter 8) is the most common way to do genetic test-
ing in multi-fetal pregnancies. This method requires inserting a separate 
needle into the uterus for each fetus being tested. Of course, the amniocen-
tesis is done under ultrasound guidance. After the doctor removes some 
fluid from the first fetus, she may leave the needle in place to inject a harm-
less organic blue dye (called indigo carmine) into that fetus’s amniotic sac. 
(Don’t worry — you won’t give birth to a Smurf. This blue dye is absorbed 
over time.) Then, if the fluid from the second needle comes out clear (not 
blue), the doctor knows that she has sampled the second sac. If you’re car-
rying more than two fetuses, the doctor adds a few drops of blue dye to 
each consecutive sac after she taps it.
Chorionic villus sampling
Chorionic villus sampling, or CVS (see Chapter 8), can be somewhat compli-
cated in multi-fetal pregnancies, but experienced doctors can usually handle 
the job. In some cases, the placentas are positioned in such a way that CVS is 
technically impossible. In these cases, the mother has the option of having an 
amniocentesis a little later in pregnancy (at about 15 to 18 weeks, rather than 
10 to 12 weeks for CVS).
Keeping track of which baby is which
Your doctor designates your babies before birth as Twin A and Twin B (or 
Triplets A, B, and C). These designations enable your doctor to communicate 
to you and others (nurses and other medical personnel) which baby is which 
and to follow the progress of each baby separately and consistently through-
out the pregnancy. By convention, the fetus closest to the cervix (the open-
ing to the womb) is designated as Twin A (or Triplet A). This baby is usually 
born first. In a triplet pregnancy, the highest triplet (closest to your chest) 
is designated as Triplet C. (Some patients come up with their own clever 
names. We had one patient with twins who nicknamed her babies Gucci and 
Prada before birth so she could keep track of them.)
Our patients want to know . . .
Q: “Is doing an amniocentesis or CVS for twin 
or triplet pregnancies riskier than for singleton 
pregnancies?”
A: Although scientists have conducted little 
research on this question, it appears the 
chances of complications aren’t substantially 
greater in multi-fetal pregnancies, if the person 
performing the procedure is experienced in 
doing it with mothers carrying twins or more.

285
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
Living day-to-day during 
a multiple pregnancy
If you’re pregnant with multiples, don’t ignore everything else we’ve written 
in this book. In many ways, your pregnancy proceeds like any other. The dif-
ference, as you may already know, is that your experience is more intense in 
various ways: You grow a larger belly quicker, your nausea may be worse, your 
amniocentesis (if you have one) is a bit more complicated (as we describe ear-
lier in this chapter), and the birth may take longer. With triplets or more, these 
physical changes and symptoms are even more exaggerated. In addition, certain 
complications are more frequent in multiples than in singletons. In the following 
list, we describe many of the ways your experience may be somewhat different:
 
✓ Activity: In the old days, doctors recommended women with twins be 
placed on bed rest beginning at 24 to 28 weeks. However, data shows 
women placed on bed rest appear to be no less likely than others to 
experience preterm delivery or have babies of low birth weight. Whether 
you need to reduce your activity depends upon your prior obstetrical 
history as well as how smoothly your pregnancy goes from week to 
week. If you develop preterm labor or have problems with fetal growth, 
your doctor may recommend you take it easy. With triplets or more, the 
benefit is unclear, but many obstetricians routinely recommend bed rest 
starting in the second trimester.
 
✓ Diet: Many experts recommend women carrying twins consume an 
extra 300 calories a day above what is required for a singleton (in other 
words, an extra 600 calories per day above their pre-pregnancy intake). 
For triplets and more, no consensus exists, but obviously your food 
intake should be somewhat greater.
 
✓ Iron and folic acid: Women carrying twins, triplets, or more stand a greater 
chance of developing anemia, which is due to dilutional anemia (see Chapter 
4) as well as greater demands for iron and folic acid. Doctors recommend 
supplemental iron and folic acid for women carrying two or more fetuses.
 
✓ Nausea: Most women carrying two or more fetuses definitely have more 
nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy than women with only one. This 
nausea may be related to higher levels of hCG (a pregnancy hormone) 
circulating through the bloodstream. The good news is that nausea and 
vomiting for mothers of multiples, as for mothers of single babies, usu-
ally goes away by the end of the first trimester.
 
✓ Prenatal doctor visits: Your practitioner is likely to follow pretty much 
the same routine she uses for mothers of single babies. That is, you have 
your blood pressure, weight, and urine checked at each visit.
 
 But because you have more than one fetus, your practitioner may ask 
you to come in more frequently. Some practitioners perform routine 
pelvic exams to make sure your cervix isn’t dilating prematurely; others 
may suggest your cervix be checked with an ultrasound exam. On the 

286
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
other hand, if you don’t have any preterm labor symptoms, your doctor 
may decide you don’t need these extra exams. (See the later section, 
“Monitoring for preterm labor in twins” for more details.)
 
✓ Ultrasound examinations: Most practitioners suggest that mothers of 
twins or more have ultrasound examinations every four to six weeks 
throughout their pregnancy in order to check fetal growth. If you have 
any problems, these exams may need to be more frequent.
 
 With more than one fetus, your doctor can’t use fundal height measure-
ments to evaluate the growth. And because women with twins, triplets, 
or more are at a higher risk of having problems with fetal growth (see 
“Intrauterine growth restriction,” later in this chapter), these periodic 
ultrasound exams are very important. Some doctors also may moni-
tor the cervix every two weeks by transvaginal ultrasound during the 
second trimester, to look for an increased risk of preterm birth. (For 
more on this, see the section “Monitoring for preterm labor in twins.”)
 
✓ Weight gain: The average weight gain for a twin pregnancy is 35 to 45 
pounds (15 to 20 kg). But the exact amount you gain depends on your 
pre-pregnancy weight. The Institute of Medicine recommends that moth-
ers with twin pregnancies gain about one pound per week during the 
second and third trimesters.
 
 Recent studies show that you can achieve the optimal growth rates by 
taking into account your body mass index (see Chapter 4) prior to preg-
nancy, and that weight gain in the first two trimesters may be especially im-
portant. Doctors recommend weight gains of 45 to 50 pounds (20 to 23 kg) 
by 34 weeks for triplets and more than 50 pounds (23 kg) for quadruplets.
Going through labor and delivery
Women carrying triplets almost always deliver by cesarean. Recently, how-
ever, some studies have suggested that under very specific situations and 
with very strict criteria, vaginal delivery of a triplet pregnancy may be pos-
sible. Because almost all triplets are delivered by cesarean, the following sec-
tion on birth positions and delivery is addressed to women carrying twins.
Often, pregnancy goes smoothly for mothers of twins, but labor and delivery 
can still be complex. For this reason, we recommend women carrying more 
than one fetus deliver in a hospital, where extra personnel are present to 
handle any complications that may arise.
Assuming the babies are full-term, your babies can be in different positions. 
Basically, their positions fall into one of three possibilities:
 
✓ Both fetuses can be head-down (vertex), as they are in about 45 percent 
of twin pregnancies (see Figure 15-3a). Vaginal delivery is successful 60 
to 70 percent of the time when the babies are in this position.

287
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
 
✓ The first fetus can be head-down and the second not, as is the case 
about 35 percent of the time, making a cesarean delivery more likely 
unless your practitioner can turn the second baby to a head-down posi-
tion. Whether trying to manipulate the baby in this way makes sense is 
a matter of some debate among practitioners. Your doctor’s choice of 
trying to turn the baby around or delivering the baby breech depends 
on her training, experience, and professional bias.
 
✓ The first fetus can be breech or transverse (lying horizontal across the 
uterus), and the second can be breech, head-down, or transverse. This 
positioning occurs about 20 percent of the time (see Figures 15-3b and 
15-3c).

With any of these combinations of positions, if the babies are preterm, the 
options may be different. In any case, discuss the possibilities with your 
doctor before the time of delivery.
Covering special issues for 
moms with multiples
If you’re pregnant with twins or triplets (or more), your doctor puts you

Don’t let this list scare you. The important thing is to be aware of potential

Preterm delivery
The biggest risk you face in carrying more than one baby is that you may 
have preterm labor and delivery. The average length of pregnancy for a 
singleton is 40 weeks, but for a twin pregnancy it’s only about 36 weeks; for 
triplets, 33 to 34 weeks; and for quadruplets, about 31 weeks. A pregnancy is 
full-term if it lasts 37 weeks or more. Preterm delivery is technically between 
24 and 37 weeks, but most babies born at 35 or 36 weeks are generally as 
healthy as babies delivered after 37 weeks.
Many women go into preterm labor without actually delivering their babies 
early. About 80 percent of mothers carrying triplets and 40 percent of those 
with twins experience preterm labor, but not all deliver early. (See details 
about preterm labor and delivery in Chapter 16.)
Chromosomal abnormalities
When you have more than one fetus and they aren’t identical, the chance 
that either one of them has a genetic abnormality is somewhat higher. After 
all, each baby has its own individual risk of some abnormality, and the risks 
add up. Mothers of single babies are considered to be of advanced maternal 
age (AMA) at 35, as we describe earlier in the chapter, but in twin pregnan-
cies derived from two separate eggs, AMA may be as early as 33, and for trip-
lets, 31 or 32. This all becomes relevant for women considering the genetic 
testing we mention earlier.
Diabetes
Because the incidence of gestational diabetes is higher with twins or more, 
many practitioners recommend all women carrying more than one fetus be 
screened for this condition. (See Chapter 17.)

 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
Hypertension and preeclampsia
Hypertension (high blood pressure) is more common in multi-fetal pregnan-
cies. The risk is proportional to the number of fetuses present. Some women 
develop hypertension alone, without other symptoms or other physical 
signs. Others develop a condition unique to pregnancy called preeclampsia, 
which involves high blood pressure in association with either edema (swell-
ing) or spilling protein in the urine (see the description of preeclampsia in 
Chapter 16). Forty percent of mothers carrying twins and 60 percent or more 
with triplets develop some form of hypertension during pregnancy. For this 
reason, your practitioner keeps a close eye on your blood pressure.
Intrauterine growth restriction
Problems with fetal growth occur in anywhere from 15 to 50 percent of all 
twins. The problem is even more common in triplets and in fetuses that 
share the same placenta. In the case of a single placenta, the blood may not 
be distributed equally, which may cause one twin to get more nutrients than 
the other. In multiples that have different placentas, growth restriction can 
result when one placenta is implanted in a more favorable position within 
the uterus and therefore provides better nourishment than the other. Your 
doctor is likely to schedule periodic ultrasound exams during your preg-
nancy to check that both (or all three) fetuses are growing properly.
Twin-twin transfusion syndrome
Twin-twin transfusion syndrome is specific to twins who share a single pla-
centa. In some cases, the single placenta contains blood vessels that inter-
connect between the two fetuses. This connection enables the two fetuses 
to exchange blood — and allows the blood to become distributed unequally. 
The fetus that gets more blood grows bigger and produces extra amniotic 
fluid, whereas the one who gets less blood may suffer impaired growth and 
have significantly decreased amniotic fluid in its sac. This situation can be 
very serious, but fortunately, it affects only 10 to 15 percent of monochori-
onic twins.
Multi-fetal pregnancy reduction
Some doctors perform the multi-fetal pregnancy reduction procedure to 
decrease the number of fetuses a woman is carrying in order to improve the 
chance that she delivers healthy babies. Doctors more commonly use it in 
women who have at least three viable fetuses resulting from fertility treat-
ments because of the high risk of preterm delivery if they try to carry all the 
fetuses. Also, some women carrying twins want to reduce their pregnancy 
to a singleton, and this is becoming increasingly more common. Usually a 
maternal-fetal medicine specialist performs a multi-fetal pregnancy reduction 
between 9 and 13 weeks in a special center. The risk involved is acceptably 
low when an experienced physician specifically trained in this procedure per-
forms it. The important thing is to find out about all possible options, so that 
you have as much information as possible to make the best decision for you.

290
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Selective termination
A selective termination procedure can be used in a multi-fetal pregnancy to 
terminate one of the fetuses when that fetus has a significant abnormality. A 
maternal-fetal medicine specialist can perform this procedure if the fetuses 
have separate placentas, so that the medication used can’t cross over and 
affect the normal fetus. In the case of identical twins that share a single amni-
otic sac, some other options are available (ask your doctor). In the latter 
case, only a few centers in the United States perform this procedure.
Monitoring for preterm labor in twins
Doctors aren’t sure what exactly causes labor to start in any pregnancy, but 
it has something to do with how distended the uterus is. With twins, the 
uterus becomes larger much earlier than it does with a single fetus, so the 
risk of going into labor early — as well as delivering early — is increased. As 
you probably know, the average gestational age when a single fetus delivers 
is 40 weeks. The average gestational age for the delivery of twins is 36 weeks.
Doctors have come up with ways to try to prevent premature births in twin 
gestations. Some of the things that have been tried are putting in a cervi-
cal cerclage (a stitch sewn into the cervix to try to keep it closed — see 
Chapter 6) and using progesterone to keep the uterus from contracting. 
Unfortunately, neither of these two treatments has been shown to change the 
rate of premature delivery in twins.
Although no surefire treatments exist to prevent premature birth in twins, 
doctors have focused on trying to come up with strategies to predict which 
patients with twins are at the highest risk for delivering early. If your risk is 
high, your doctor may decide to admit you to the hospital for more intensive 
observation and to make sure you don’t have preterm labor that is unrecog-
nized. Your doctor may also give you steroid shots between weeks 24 and 34 to 
help your baby’s lungs mature quicker in the event that you do deliver early.
Two factors that are indicators of early delivery can be examined via trans-
vaginal ultrasound:
 
✓ The length of the cervix: The length of the cervix usually gets progres-
sively shorter prior to delivery. Cervical length measurements are most 
helpful in twins between 16 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, but sometimes 
they are continued after that time if the situation warrants.
 
✓ Whether or not the cervix is dilating: Early dilation is sometimes called 
funneling because the cervix looks like a funnel on ultrasound.
The frequency of the measurements depends on your own individual situa-
tion, but they’re typically taken about every two weeks. If your cervix is long 
and not dilated, your chances of a premature delivery are low. If it’s short 

291
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
or showing signs of early dilation, your doctor will probably step up the fre-
quency of your visits or even admit you to the hospital.
Another test to predict the likelihood of delivering early involves determining 
the level of fetal fibronectin (see Chapter 16). This substance is found in vagi-
nal secretions obtained by using a special swab. Fetal fibronectin levels are 
higher in women with twins who are at an increased risk for early delivery. 
Even if your cervix is closed and you aren’t in premature labor, if your fetal 
fibronectin test is positive, your doctor may decide to give you steroids.
Getting Pregnant Again
Doctors and parents haven’t come to a consensus on the optimal time to 
get pregnant again. Probably the most important consideration is your over-
all health. If you can get back to your pre-pregnancy or ideal body weight 
quickly after you deliver, and if you can replenish any lost nutrients and 
vitamins (particularly folate, iron, and calcium) from your last pregnancy, 
you can probably consider getting pregnant again fairly soon — in about 12 
to 18 months. A recent large study showed getting pregnant again in less than 
18 months was associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy out-
comes. If you’ve had a complicated pregnancy, a difficult delivery, or exces-
sive loss of blood, wait until you’re in better shape before trying again.
 
Also ask yourself what you consider to be the ideal age difference in your 
children. Some people feel having children close in age is better. That way, 
the older child doesn’t have so many years to settle into the role of only child 
and, therefore, may not feel so jealous when the new baby comes. Others feel 
spacing the children further apart, so that the older child is mature enough 
to handle the introduction of a new sibling, is better. Most important is how 
you and your partner feel and how ready you are to take on another child. The 
decision may involve emotional and financial issues as well as physical ones. 
Ask yourself whether you can handle the pressure and the expense and can 
do the work that having another child takes.
Realizing how each pregnancy differs
Naturally, any mother compares her second pregnancy with her first, but 
every pregnancy is different. If your last pregnancy went smoothly, you may 
think any little thing out of the ordinary that happens in the next pregnancy 
is a signal that things aren’t going well. By the same token, if your first preg-
nancy was difficult, you needn’t assume the same complications are going to 
happen again. And no matter what anybody tells you, remember that differ-
ent symptoms don’t mean the second baby will be a different sex than your 
first child. See Chapter 2 for some myths about predicting your baby’s sex.

292
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
These are some of the ways in which you may experience pregnancy differ-
ently the second (or third or fourth) time around:
 
✓ Many women feel that they’re showing sooner or are at least more 
bloated and distended. This condition may be due to the fact that their 
abdominal muscles have been stretched by their previous pregnancy 
and are now more lax.
 
✓ Many women find that nausea isn’t as severe as it was the first time 
around, and others find that it’s worse.
 
✓ You can usually identify fetal movement earlier.
 
✓ Labor is usually shorter, and delivery is easier.
 
✓ Many women find they feel Braxton-Hicks contractions earlier and 
more frequently than with their first child. (See Chapter 7 for more on 
Braxton-Hicks contractions.)
 
✓ Most women are less anxious the second time around.
One thing remains the same: As hard as it is to believe, you will love your 
second child as much as your first.

In their third pregnancy, many women commonly experience a special kind 
of worry: They feel that because their first two pregnancies were healthy 
and problem-free, the third one’s bound to have complications. Many feel 
that they were lucky twice in a row, and that going for a third time is pushing 
their luck. If you feel this way, believe us, you aren’t alone. Keep in mind the 
chances of trouble aren’t inherently greater in a third pregnancy, even if the 
first two went smoothly.
Giving birth after a prior cesarean delivery
If you’ve had a cesarean delivery and you get pregnant again, you may 
wonder whether you can deliver vaginally this time or need another cesar-
ean. To some extent, the answer depends on which of the following kinds of 
cesarean you had:
 
✓ Low transverse: Most cesarean deliveries are done through a low-
transverse incision (across the floor in the lower part of the uterus). 
(See Figure 15-4a.) Women who have this kind of incision usually can 
deliver vaginally in a subsequent pregnancy — as long as they have no 
other complicating factors. The risk of uterine rupture is lowest with 
this kind of incision.

293
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
 
✓ Classical: If you have what’s known as a classical cesarean, in which a 
vertical incision is made in the upper portion of the uterus (see Figure 
15-4b), don’t try to have a vaginal delivery in a subsequent pregnancy 
because this type of incision is more likely to rupture. Vertical incisions 
are sometimes performed in cases of very preterm birth or placenta 
previa (see Chapter 16), or when the mother’s uterus is an abnormal 
shape or has large fibroids.
 
✓ Low vertical: A low-vertical incision (see Figure 15-4c) is performed less 
frequently than a low-transverse incision, but it does enable the mother 
to attempt labor and delivery in a subsequent pregnancy.

294
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
 
The incision made on your skin doesn’t reflect the type of incision on your 
uterus. In other words, you may have a transverse incision on your skin (a 
bikini cut) but still have a vertical incision on your uterus.
Doctors used to think that after a woman had a cesarean delivery, all her 
babies would have to be delivered the same way and that trying a vaginal 
delivery risked the uterus rupturing through the old cesarean scar. But stud-
ies have demonstrated that the risk of such a rupture is actually quite low — 
less than 1 percent. Discuss the issues of uterine rupture with your doctor. 
Other recent studies show that 70 percent of the time, women can success-
fully deliver a baby vaginally after they’ve had a cesarean. Of course, the 
likelihood of success depends to some extent on why a cesarean was per-
formed in the first place. If your doctor performed it because the baby was 
breech, the chance that the next baby can be delivered vaginally is nearly 90 
percent. If the cesarean was performed because the baby was too large to fit 
through the mother’s pelvis, the chance of a future vaginal delivery falls to 
50 to 60 percent. Some smaller hospitals are unable to offer VBAC (vaginal 
birth after cesarean) to their patients because they don’t have the capacity 
to meet the special requirements (like 24/7 availability of an anesthesiolo-
gist) needed to do so.
Why would you want to deliver your next baby vaginally? The main benefit is 
that if you’re successful, your recovery is much shorter. Another potential ben-
efit from a vaginal birth is that it’s often associated with less postpartum pain. 
However, although most patients find the pain associated with vaginal birth to 
be less than that associated with cesarean delivery, some vaginal births have 
painful complications of their own. See Chapter 11 for more information.
Other benefits of a vaginal birth include the following:
 
✓ A lower risk of the kind of complications associated with abdominal 
surgery including
 
• Anesthesia problems
 
• Inadvertent injury to adjacent organs
 
• Infection
 
• Possible blood clots from being immobile for a longer period of time
 
✓ For some women, a psychological benefit from experiencing a vaginal 
birth
 
✓ A shorter hospital stay
 
✓ The possibility, indicated by some studies, that the baby clears her 
secretions more efficiently if born vaginally

295
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
However, you do have some risk: If you try labor and then end up with 
another cesarean, studies show that the complication rate is higher than 
if you went straight to a repeat cesarean without labor. Additionally, your 
recovery may be longer than if you had elected to have a repeat cesarean.
If You’re a Nontraditional Family
Single women and gay and lesbian couples bearing children are becoming 
more and more common. If you fall into one of these categories, discussing 
your situation with your practitioner is important. Don’t worry that your 
doctor may judge or ridicule you. Practitioners are trained to be sensitive to 
all patients’ needs, and you’re no different. If your practitioner does seem to 
have a problem with your situation, move on to someone who’s more under-
standing — the sooner, the better.
In many single-mother and lesbian pregnancies, the father of the baby isn’t 
physically present. Still, try to have information about the father’s family his-
tory and ethnicity so you and your practitioner can go over any genetic impli-
cations. (See Chapter 5.)
If the father isn’t going to be around for the whole process, build your own 
support network. If you’re a single mom, you may choose one or more people 
(family members or close friends) to share your pregnancy, labor, and deliv-
ery. If you’re part of a lesbian couple, the nonpregnant partner can assume 
the primary support role. If the father is a gay male friend, include him as 
support. No matter the case, having your support people accompany you to 
any prenatal visits or prenatal classes and having them around for the labor 
and delivery process is completely appropriate.
Preparing Your Child (Or Children) 
for a New Arrival
Many parents look forward to having a second child specifically because they 
want to provide a sibling for the first one. But your first child may not easily 
understand this reasoning. She may feel completely content about being the 
only child, and it may be months or years before the first one appreciates the 
second one. For those of you who are having your second child — or third 
or fourth (or more!) — the following sections offer a few ideas about how to 
help prepare the older one(s) for the new arrival. Many hospitals now offer 
sibling classes to help your child acclimate. Contact the hospital in which 
you plan to deliver for information.

296
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Explaining pregnancy
The ease or difficulty you may have introducing a new baby sister or brother 
depends quite a bit on how old the elder sibling is. Explaining a new baby 
to a 15-year-old is easy; getting the concept across to a 15-month-old can be 
tricky. And the challenge begins at the time you tell the first child that you’re 
pregnant. A 2-year-old has little concept of time and may not understand that 
Mom is pregnant for months before the baby comes. She may be frustrated 
the baby can’t come immediately. So delay telling a very young child about 
your pregnancy until the second or third trimester unless you don’t mind 
being hounded every day about when the new baby is coming.
If your child is old enough — at least two or three years old — you may 
want to bring her along to prenatal doctor visits, ultrasound examinations, 
or when you’re shopping for baby items. (While you’re doing that shopping, 
consider getting a small present for your child so she doesn’t feel neglected.) 
A child who is old enough may also like to join in discussions about what to 
name the new baby.
 
If you anticipate moving your child to a new room or having her graduate from 
a crib to a bed, make the change before the baby is born. This change allows 
your older child to have a chance to acclimate so she doesn’t associate the 
new situation directly with the new baby’s arrival.
As you near the end of your pregnancy, don’t be surprised if your child starts 
to act up or becomes unusually clingy and dependent. Many children get a 
sense that things are about to change when they see their mother getting 
physically bigger or when they overhear conversations about the impending 
arrival. During this time, be supportive and loving. Include your child in the 
preparations as much as possible. And remember that although having a new 
sibling affects almost all children in certain predictable ways, each child is 
unique, and how yours reacts depends in large part on her personality.
Making baby-sitting arrangements 
for your delivery
Obviously, you need to plan on having someone take care of your child when 
you and your partner go to deliver the new baby. If your delivery is sched-
uled (that is, you’re having a planned cesarean or an elective induction), 
scheduling is relatively easy. But most women don’t know exactly when the 
big moment will arrive. And you still need to be ready beforehand.

297
 Chapter 15: Pregnancies with Special Considerations
If you go into labor spontaneously in the middle of the night, you want your 
child to be prepared in advance for what will happen and who will show up 
to take care of her while you’re gone. Reassure your child you will be okay 
and that she can come to see you and the new baby in the hospital very 
soon. If possible, phone your child at home while you’re in the hospital to tell 
her that you’re doing well, especially if your labor is unusually long. Many 
hospitals now have special sibling visiting hours, and you may want to check 
out the details ahead of time.
 
Pack a couple of gifts to take with you to the hospital — one for your child to 
give to the new baby and one for the baby to give to the child.
Coming home
During the first few days that the new siblings live together, you may be 
amazed at how well-adjusted, happy, and excited your older child is. Part of 
this attitude is genuine enthusiasm. But keep in mind that part of it may also 
be your older child’s attempt to share the limelight with the new baby. Some 
children have a short period of difficulty coping; others do fine at first but 
develop longer-lasting sibling rivalry.
Don’t be surprised if your child begins to regress in terms of some develop-
mental milestones. A previously potty-trained child may resort to bedwet-
ting, for example. Or a child may resume thumb-sucking or have difficulty 
sleeping. You may notice your older child gets especially jealous while you’re 
breast-feeding. During this period, understand your child may need extra 
reassurance that you still love her and the new baby hasn’t replaced her in 
your heart at all.
 
Explain that your heart is big enough to love more than one child. If possible, 
allow your elder child to participate in helping to care for the baby. How much 
“help” your child is capable of providing depends upon her age, but even 
small children can fetch a diaper if you need one or help give the baby a bath. 
Don’t be surprised if at times your child expresses aggression toward you or 
the baby. Usually, these acts of aggression are harmless, but during this early 
stage of adjustment, don’t leave your child alone with the baby unsupervised. 
She may not realize certain ways of handling the baby may be harmful.
 
Several months may pass before your older child feels secure, but eventu-
ally most children do deal with the change successfully. Quite often friends, 
neighbors, and family shower the new baby with gifts. Again, having a stash of 
inexpensive new toys for your older child to prevent excessive jealousy may 
be a good idea. With extra love and understanding, you can help your child 
through what can be a difficult period.

Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Dealing with Preterm Labor
Normally, during the second half of pregnancy, the uterus contracts inter-
mittently. As the end approaches, these contractions grow more frequent. 
Finally, they become regular and cause the cervix to dilate. When contrac-
tions and dilation occur before 37 weeks of gestation, labor is considered pre-
term. Some women notice periods of regular contractions prior to 37 weeks. 
If the cervix doesn’t dilate or efface, however, the condition isn’t considered 
preterm labor.
Of course, the earlier preterm labor occurs, the more troublesome it can be. 
The problems that a premature baby has if he is born after about 34 weeks 
are usually much less worrisome than those he faces if born at only 24 weeks. 
Prior to about 32 weeks, the main problem is that the baby’s lungs may still 
be immature, but other complications may exist as well. Nevertheless, the 
majority of babies born at 26 to 32 weeks are fine and healthy, especially if 
they have access to modern neonatal intensive care.
Premature babies stand a higher risk of contracting an infection, they may 
experience problems with the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines), 
or they may experience an intraventricular hemorrhage, which is bleeding into 
an area within the brain.
The following can be signs and symptoms of preterm labor:
 
✓ Constant leakage of thin fluid from the vagina
 
✓ An increase in mucous-like vaginal discharge
 
✓ Intense and persistent pressure in the pelvis or vaginal area
 
✓ Menstrual-like cramps
 
✓ Persistent lower-back pain
 
✓ Regular contractions that don’t stop with rest or decreased activity
Nobody knows for sure what causes premature labor, but clearly, some 
patients are at higher risk for developing it. If you fall into one of the high-risk 
categories, your practitioner probably will want to follow you more closely 
than usual. The following are some factors that put you at risk for preterm 
delivery:
 
✓ An abnormally shaped uterus.
 
✓ Bleeding during pregnancy, especially during the second half. (Note: 
This doesn’t include occasional spotting during the first trimester.)
 
✓ A prior preterm delivery.
 
✓ Some infections, like bacterial vaginosis, peridontal disease, or a kidney 
infection.

301
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
 
✓ Smoking.
 
✓ Abuse of certain illicit drugs.
 
✓ Being African-American.
 
✓ Poor nutrition and/or a low pre-pregnancy weight.
 
✓ Being pregnant with twins or more.
A lot of women ask whether certain working conditions can increase the risks 
of preterm birth. There does seem to be some association between prema-
ture birth and physically demanding work, prolonged standing, shift or night 
work, and significant fatigue. Having a demanding job doesn’t make preterm 
labor a certainty by any means, though.
 
The following suggestions can decrease your chances of preterm labor:
 
✓ Stop (or decrease) smoking. See Chapter 3 for more on how smoking 
affects your baby.
 
✓ Avoid illicit drugs and alcohol. To find out more about the risks posed 
by the use of these substances, turn to Chapter 3.
 
✓ Reduce occupational fatigue. Limit work to less than 42 hours per week, 
and minimize standing to less than 6 hours per day.
 
✓ Make sure you are getting adequate nutrition. Check out Chapter 4 for 
the details of a healthy diet.
Some interventions that haven’t been shown to be helpful in lowering your 
chances of preterm labor are
 
✓ Bed rest and hospitalization
 
✓ Avoiding intercourse
 
✓ Taking medications to stop labor as a preventive step
 
✓ Taking antibiotics unnecessarily
While these things have not been shown to be beneficial in studies, they are still 
sometimes prescribed in individual situations in the hope that they may help.
Checking for signs of preterm labor
Practitioners have various ways of detecting preterm labor, although the 
techniques aren’t always effective. The most common methods are for your 
practitioner to check your cervix by performing an internal exam and to 
monitor you for contractions.

302
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
 
Some practitioners look for symptoms of preterm labor using transvaginal ultra-
sound. A small ultrasound probe is placed into the vagina next to the cervix in 
order to measure the length of the cervix. Measuring cervical length can help 
predict whether you are at an increased risk of delivering prematurely. The 
routine use of cervical ultrasound for the prediction of preterm birth in women 
without any symptoms or risk factors is currently not recommended. More 
studies are needed to show doctors how best to use transvaginal ultrasound.
 
A test called fetal fibronectin is probably the best available predictor of who is 
not likely to have preterm delivery. The test involves swabbing the back of the 
vagina with a cotton swab. A negative result on this test is a good indicator 
that preterm delivery is unlikely within the next few weeks. A positive result, 
however, does not necessarily mean that you are going to deliver prematurely.
Stopping preterm labor
Depending on how far along you are when you develop preterm labor, your 
doctor may attempt to stop your contractions (assuming he believes in this 
practice), and you may be admitted to the hospital. Your doctor may use sev-
eral medications (called tocolytics) to block preterm labor.
 
Doctors have never come to widespread agreement that these medications are 
useful in the long run, although they have been shown to help for a few days to 
a week. Most tocolytics have side effects on the mother. Terbutaline, for exam-
ple, may cause an increase in heart rate or a jittery feeling. Magnesium sulfate 
may cause nausea, flushing, or drowsiness. Indomethacin is well-tolerated, but 
can’t be used for too long because of some effects on the fetus. Nifedipine has 
recently become the first line of treatment for many doctors because it appears 
to have few side effects, and there are no restrictions on the length of use.
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: Is monitoring contractions from home an 
effective way to detect preterm labor?
A: Home-contraction monitoring is a controver-
sial technology because studies haven’t proven 
that it’s beneficial. Your practitioner gives you 
a device that you strap to your abdomen for a 
period of half an hour or an hour each day (or 
sometimes twice a day). This device can sense 
contractions you may not be able to feel. The 
information that the device receives is then 
transmitted through a telephone modem to a 
nursing station. If it appears you’re contracting 
more frequently than you should be, the device 
alerts your doctor. In this way, you may pick 
up preterm labor at an early stage. However, 
recent studies suggest that this kind of moni-
toring is no more useful than having the patient 
keep in close contact with nurses or teaching 
her to be aware of preterm labor’s symptoms.

303
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
If your doctor thinks your preterm labor may lead to premature delivery 
prior to 34 weeks, he will probably recommend you receive an injection of 
steroids, which have been shown to decrease the risk of respiratory prob-
lems and other complications in the premature newborn. The risks to the 
mother of taking these drugs are negligible, and large studies have shown 
that the steroids are beneficial to the baby for about a week. Patients who 
continue to be at risk for preterm delivery a week after the steroids were 
first administered may be given a second course of steroids under certain 
circumstances. In particular, if you are less than 28 weeks and still at risk for 
preterm birth, a repeat course may be beneficial to the baby. Recent data 
suggests that using a lower dose of steroids for the second course is still ben-
eficial and may have fewer long-term side effects.
Preventing preterm labor
Several recent studies indicate that women who are at an increased risk for 
a preterm delivery (see the list in “Dealing with Preterm Labor” earlier in 
this chapter) may have a reduced chance of delivering preterm if they take a 
specific type of progesterone during their pregnancies. The studies looked at 
both progesterone injections and progesterone vaginal suppositories.
The injections involve weekly doses of a medication called 17-hydroxypro-
gesterone caproate (17-P) starting at 16 to 20 weeks and continuing until 
about 36 weeks. The suppositories involve placement of a tablet or gel into 
the vagina nightly starting at 16 to 24 weeks and continuing until 36 weeks.
At this time, progesterone seems effective for women with a history of a prior 
preterm birth, and possibly for women with abnormally-shaped uteruses or 
cervical insufficiency. Recent studies suggest that high-risk women diagnosed 
with a shortened cervix may also benefit from progesterone therapy. The 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently recommends 
that progesterone use be limited to women with a history of spontaneous 
preterm birth at less than 37 weeks.
Delivering the baby early
Sometimes delivering a baby early makes sense. When a woman experiences 
preterm labor at 35 or 36 weeks, for example, letting her go ahead and deliver 
is usually wise because the outlook for the baby is so good that there’s no 
reason to subject the mother to the side effects of medications to forestall 
labor. Regardless of the gestational age, premature delivery may also be the 
best option in some cases where the baby has a condition that doctors can’t 
treat inside the uterus or when the mother has a condition that is worsening, 
such as preeclampsia (see the next section), and continuing the pregnancy 
would be risky.

Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Handling Preeclampsia
Also known as toxemia, or pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preeclamp-
sia results when a woman experiences elevated blood pressure along with 
fluid retention or protein spillage in the urine after about 20 weeks of gesta-
tion. This condition isn’t all that uncommon, occurring in about 7 percent 
of pregnancies. Women having their first child are especially susceptible. 
Preeclampsia usually occurs late in pregnancy, but it can develop in the late 
second or early third trimester. The condition goes away after delivery.
Doctors have different criteria for diagnosing the condition, but, in general, 
blood pressure that stays above 140/90 is considered elevated if you have no 
history of blood pressure problems prior to pregnancy. Protein in the urine, 
swelling, and the elevated blood pressure together are usually required for 
diagnosis.
Following is a list of the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia:
 
✓ Abnormalities in certain blood tests (decreased platelets, important in 
clotting) and elevations in liver tests
 
✓ Blurry vision or seeing spots in front of your eyes
 
✓ Nausea, vomiting, and pain in the upper mid-abdominal area
 
✓ Onset of seizures
 
✓ Pain in the upper-right part of your abdomen, near your liver
 
✓ A severe headache that won’t go away, even if you take pain medication
 
✓ Sudden swelling of the hands, face, or legs
 
✓ Sudden weight gain (5 pounds in one week)

Most of the symptoms can occur harmlessly during any pregnancy. Unless 
they happen in combination with elevated blood pressure or protein spillage 
in the urine, they’re quite normal. If one day you have a headache, or if for a 
second you see spots, don’t jump to the conclusion that you have preeclamp-
sia. If the symptoms persist, tell your doctor.
No one knows exactly what causes preeclampsia, but it probably involves a 
combination of maternal, fetal, and placental factors. We do know that some 
women are at a higher risk for developing it than others. The following are 
risk factors for preeclampsia:
 
✓ Existing chronic hypertension
 
✓ First pregnancy
 
✓ History of preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy
 
✓ Long-standing diabetes

305
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
 
✓ Mother older than 40
 
✓ Significant obesity
 
✓ Some medical problems, such as serious kidney or liver disease, lupus, 
or other vascular diseases
 
✓ Triplets or more (twins, also, but to a much lesser extent)
Despite extensive ongoing medical research on preeclampsia, no one knows 
exactly how to prevent it. Some data suggest that taking a low dose of aspirin 
daily starting at 12 to 14 weeks may help reduce the incidence of preeclampsia or 
delay its onset for women at moderate to high risk of developing the condition. 
Other treatments have been tried with varying degrees of success, including
 
✓ Calcium supplementation and antioxidant therapy: Like low-dose aspi-
rin, calcium has not been shown to prevent preeclampsia in low-risk 
women; however, there may be some benefit to women at high risk.
 
✓ A combination of vitamins C and E: Although initial studies suggested 
a benefit, more recent data show not only no benefit, but a higher risk of 
certain complications.
 
✓ Fish oil: This has been investigated, but it hasn’t been shown to be help-
ful in lowering the incidence of preeclampsia.
Ultimately, the only real treatment for preeclampsia is delivering the baby. 
When to deliver depends on how severe the condition is and how far along 
you are in your pregnancy. If you’re close to your due date, induced delivery 
may be the wisest approach. If you’re only 28 weeks along, your doctor may 
try close observation of you and the baby, either at home or in the hospital. 
Doctors weigh the risks to the mother’s health against the risks to the baby 
of preterm delivery.
Understanding Placental Conditions
Two different problems with the baby’s placenta can sometimes occur in the 
latter part of pregnancy: placenta previa and placental abruption. In this sec-
tion, we describe both.
Placenta previa
Placenta previa is when the placenta partially or completely covers the 
cervix, as shown in Figure 16-1. Doctors typically diagnose patients with pla-
centa previa during a routine ultrasound exam, but sometimes women find 
out about the problem only when they begin bleeding late in the second tri-
mester or early in the third.

In early pregnancy, having the placenta positioned near the cervix or even 
partially covering it is common and usually poses no danger to the mother 
or the baby. In fact, this condition occurs in as many as one out of five preg-
nancies. In the vast majority of women (95 percent), the placenta rises as the 
uterus enlarges with the growing baby, which is why you have no reason to 
worry about the placenta covering the cervix early in pregnancy.
Even if the situation persists through the late second trimester and into the 
third, it can be harmless. Many women who have placenta previa never bleed 
at all. However, the possibility of heavy bleeding is the main concern with 
placenta previa. Sometimes bleeding leads to preterm labor. In this case, 
your practitioner attempts to stop the contractions, which often stops the 
bleeding. If bleeding is severe and can’t be stopped, the baby may have to be 
delivered.
If you’re in your third trimester and you have placenta previa, your practitio-
ner may want you to have regular ultrasound examinations to see whether 
the placenta will eventually move out of the way. He may tell you to avoid 
intercourse and internal examinations in order to lower the risk of any bleed-
ing. If the condition persists until 36 weeks, your doctor most likely will rec-
ommend a cesarean delivery because the baby can’t come through the birth 
canal without disrupting the placenta, and this can lead to heavy bleeding.

307
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
Placental abruption
In some women, the placenta separates from the uterine wall before preg-
nancy is over. This condition is called placental abruption (it’s sometimes 
also called abruptio placentae or placental separation). Figure 16-2 shows 
you what it looks like.
 
Figure 16-2: 
Placental 
abruption.
 
Blood clot
Placenta
Placental abruption is a common cause of third-trimester bleeding. Because 
blood is an irritant to the uterine muscle, it can also cause premature labor 
and abdominal pain. An abruption is difficult to see on an ultrasound exam 
unless it is quite large. So in many cases, doctors can make the diagnosis 
only after they rule out every other possible cause of bleeding. Rarely, a 
placental abruption occurs suddenly, and if the separation is large enough, 
it may necessitate rapid delivery. See Chapter 7 for other causes of third-
trimester bleeding.
If you experience a small placental abruption, your practitioner may recom-
mend you try bed rest. He will also start to observe your pregnancy more 
closely to make sure the problem has no harmful side effects on the fetus.

308
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Recognizing Problems with 
the Amniotic Fluid and Sac
As you know, the fetus grows within a “bag of water” known as the amniotic 
sac, which contains the amniotic fluid. This fluid increases in volume through-
out the first part of pregnancy and reaches its maximum level at 34 weeks. 
After that, the volume gradually declines. Medical science hasn’t yet discov-
ered exactly what mechanism regulates the amniotic fluid volume, although 
we do know that the fetus plays some role in how much fluid the sac contains. 
During the second half of pregnancy, the amniotic fluid comprises mainly fetal 
urine. The fetus urinates into the sac and then swallows the fluid. The fluid 
circulating around the fetal lungs aids in lung development.
Sometimes, a practitioner may suspect that the amount of amniotic fluid is 
above or below average, and he may do an ultrasound examination to see 
what’s happening. Minor increases or decreases in the amount of amniotic 
fluid usually aren’t a problem. But large variations in amniotic fluid volume 
may be a symptom of some other problem. This section describes what hap-
pens when problems with the amniotic fluid or sac occur.
Too much amniotic fluid
The medical term for too much fluid is polyhydramnios or hydramnios. This 
situation occurs quite frequently, in about 1 to 10 percent of pregnancies. 
Often the increase in volume is small. Doctors don’t always know what 
causes it, but they do know that a small increase usually isn’t a problem. 
Larger increases may be associated with a medical condition in the mother — 
diabetes or certain viral illnesses, for example. In some rare cases, the excess 
fluid may be due to certain fetal problems. The fetus may be having difficulty 
swallowing the fluid, for example, so more of it accumulates inside the sac.
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “Is the amount of amniotic fluid determined 
to any extent by the amount of water I drink?”
A: No. The mother’s fluid intake has little to do 
with it. Some recent studies suggest a mother 
can cause small increases in the amount of 
amniotic fluid by drinking plenty of liquids, but 
the effect isn’t that great. Nevertheless, stay 
well hydrated.

309
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
Too little amniotic fluid
A woman who has too little amniotic fluid has oligohydramnios. As we men-
tion earlier, amniotic fluid volume normally decreases after 34 to 36 weeks. 
If yours starts to fall below a specific range, however, your practitioner may 
want to observe the fetus more closely by performing certain tests. One 
common cause of low amniotic fluid is a rupture of the membranes, which 
allows fluid to leak out.
A fluid level that drops significantly prior to 34 weeks may indicate a prob-
lem with the mother or the baby. For example, some women with hyperten-
sion or lupus may have less blood flow to the uterus and, consequently, 
less blood flow to the placenta and the baby. When the baby receives less 
blood, the baby’s kidneys make less urine, and that results in lower levels 
of amniotic fluid.
If the reduction in fluid is mild or moderate, the baby is watched carefully 
and undergoes tests of fetal well-being. Sometimes, oligohydramnios is a sign 
the baby’s growth is restricted (see “Describing Problems with Fetal Growth” 
later in this chapter) or, rarely, that there are abnormalities in the baby’s uri-
nary tract. Sometimes it’s a sign the placenta isn’t functioning optimally.
If you have decreased amniotic fluid, your doctor may suggest you get more 
rest and try to stay off your feet. By doing so, you may promote more blood 
flow to the uterus and placenta and thus increase the baby’s urine output. 
(Just be glad you don’t have to change all the diapers yet!)
Rupture of the amniotic sac
Premature rupture of the membranes or amniotic sac, sometimes called 
PROM (don’t worry, no bad tuxedos, gaudy dresses, or ugly corsages 
involved here), is when a woman’s water breaks sometime before labor 
starts. When it happens close to your due date, it’s referred to as term PROM. 
If you’re less than 37 weeks at the time, it’s called preterm PROM.
 
✓ If you experience term PROM, your practitioner may simply wait until 
you go into labor on your own. Or, he may induce labor in order to avoid 
the risk that an infection may develop inside the uterus.
 
✓ If you experience preterm PROM, you may or may not go into labor, 
depending on how far along you are. If you’re very far from your due 
date and don’t appear to have an infection in your uterus, your doctor 
may use some medications (antibiotics, tocolytics, and steroids) to pro-
long the pregnancy as long as possible and to help your baby’s chance 

310
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
of lung development. Your doctor will probably perform frequent ultra-
sound exams and monitor the fetal heart rate to ensure the baby is man-
aging okay.
 
If you think your membranes may have ruptured and you’re preterm, let your 
practitioner know immediately or go to the hospital. He can perform tests to 
definitively let you know whether the membranes have actually ruptured.
Describing Problems with Fetal Growth
One of the main reasons to get prenatal care is to assure that your baby is 
growing well. A practitioner typically gauges growth by measuring the fundal 
height (see Chapter 3). As a general rule (in a singleton pregnancy), the 
measurement in centimeters from the top of the pubic bone to the top of the 
uterus roughly equals the number of weeks gestation. If your practitioner 
finds this measurement is greater or less than expected, he may recommend 
you have an ultrasound exam to more precisely assess the baby’s growth. 
During the exam, the technician measures various fetal body parts to come 
up with an approximate fetal weight. That estimate is then compared with 
the average weight for fetuses at the same gestational age and assigned to a 
certain percentile. The 50th percentile is average. But because fetuses (like 
babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, and grown-ups) come in different sizes, 
there is a range of normal weights. Anything between the 10th and the 90th 
percentiles is considered normal (see Chapter 7 for more information about 
fetal weight).
 
These upper and lower limits are somewhat arbitrary. They do imply that 10 
percent of the population is larger than normal and that 10 percent is smaller, 
but this statement isn’t exactly true. Most fetuses below the 10th percentile or 
above the 90th percentile are completely normal. On the other hand, some of 
them may not be growing normally and may need extra surveillance.
Smaller-than-average babies
A fetus whose estimated weight falls below the 10th percentile may have 
intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). IUGR can lead to the birth of a baby who 
is small for gestational age (SGA). IUGR has many possible causes, including 
the following:
 
✓ The baby is measuring small, but is otherwise normal. Just as healthy 
adults come in all sizes, so do fetuses.
 
✓ Chromosomal abnormalities. This cause is most common with early-
onset IUGR, which occurs in the second trimester.

311
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
 
✓ Environmental toxins. Cigarette smoking causes a decrease in birth 
weight between one-fourth and one-half of a pound, on average. Chronic 
alcohol consumption (of at least one to two drinks a day) and cocaine 
use also can cause low birth weight.
 
✓ Genetic factors. Some genetic factors cause the fetus to grow less than 
average.
 
✓ Heart and circulatory abnormalities in the fetus. Examples include a 
congenital heart defect or umbilical cord abnormalities.
 
✓ Inadequate nutrition for the mother. Proper nutrition is especially 
important in the third trimester.
 
✓ Infection such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, or toxoplasmosis. 
Chapter 16 provides more information.
 
✓ Multiple gestation. Fifteen to 25 percent of twins, and an even higher 
percentage of triplets, have IUGR. Twins grow at the same rate as single-
tons until 28 to 32 weeks, when the twin growth curve drops off.
 
✓ Placental factors and uterine-placental problems. Because the placenta 
provides nutrition and oxygen to the fetus, if it’s functioning poorly or 
if the blood isn’t flowing smoothly from the uterus to the placenta, the 
fetus may not grow properly. Women with antiphospholipid antibody 
syndrome (a blood-clotting problem), recurrent bleeding, vascular 
diseases, or chronic hypertension are at risk for IUGR because those 
conditions cause poor placental function. Preeclampsia may also impair 
placental function and lead to IUGR.
The way your practitioner responds to IUGR depends on your individual 
situation. Fetuses with mild IUGR, normal chromosomes, and no evidence 
of infection are likely to be fine. Sometimes early delivery is warranted, 
however, because the fetus may grow better in the nursery than inside the 
uterus. The way your practitioner responds to signs of IUGR depends on both 
the cause of the problem and the gestational age at which it is diagnosed. He 
may recommend more frequent office visits, bed rest, periodic ultrasound 
examinations, fetal heart rate exams (known as NSTs — see Chapter 8), or 
other tests. If the problem is severe but the pregnancy is far enough along, 
your doctor may recommend delivery.
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “If I eat more, will my baby grow into the 
normal range?”
A: Unfortunately, the answer is no. Eating more 
doesn’t correct the problem unless you’re sig-
nificantly malnourished.

312
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
In many cases, SGA babies turn out to be perfectly normal. Unfortunately, 
though, severe cases have been associated with learning difficulties later 
in life and even fetal death, which is why having your practitioner conduct 
some form of fetal surveillance is important.
Larger-than-average babies
A baby whose estimated weight is above the 90th percentile may have mac-
rosomia (“big body”) and end up being large for gestational age, or LGA. 
Many different reasons can explain why a woman may have an exceptionally 
large baby, including the following:
 
✓ The mother has previously delivered a large baby.
 
✓ The mother has gained an excessive amount of weight during the 
pregnancy.
 
✓ The mother is obese.
 
✓ One (or both) of the parents was born very large.
 
✓ The pregnancy lasts longer than 40 weeks.
 
✓ The mother has poorly controlled diabetes.
The mother’s main risk, naturally, is that the delivery is more difficult. If she 
delivers vaginally, she may suffer increased trauma to the birth canal, and 
she has an increased chance of needing a cesarean delivery. The main risk to 
the baby, likewise, is injury during delivery. Birth injury is more likely when 
a large baby is delivered vaginally, but it can also occur during a cesarean 
delivery. Most commonly, birth injury involves excessive stretching of the 
nerves in the baby’s upper arm and neck resulting from a shoulder dystocia 
(see Chapter 11) during delivery.

If your practitioner thinks your baby may be exceptionally large, based on 
either an ultrasound estimate of fetal weight or an abdominal exam, and it 
appears your pelvic bones may make for a tight fit, he will discuss your deliv-
ery options with you.
Looking at Blood Incompatibilities
If a baby’s parents have two different blood types, the baby’s blood type can 
be different from the mother’s. Usually this situation creates absolutely no 
problem for the mother or the baby. In some rare cases, these blood-type 
mismatches warrant special consideration. Even then, however, there is 
hardly ever a significant problem.

313
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
The Rh factor
Most people are Rh-positive, which means they carry the Rh factor on 
their red blood cells. Those who don’t carry the Rh factor are considered 
Rh-negative. If an Rh-positive man and an Rh-negative woman conceive, the 
fetus may be Rh-positive, thereby creating a mismatch between baby and 
mother.
This kind of mismatch usually isn’t a problem and is almost never a prob-
lem in a first pregnancy. If, however, any of the baby’s blood leaks into the 
mother’s circulation, her immune system may form antibodies to the Rh 
factor. And if any such antibodies reach a significant level in a future preg-
nancy, they can cross through the placenta into the baby’s circulation and 
begin to destroy the baby’s red blood cells. It sounds scary, we know. But the 
problem isn’t insurmountable. In order to prevent it, the doctor usually gives 
the mother an injection of anti-D immune globulin at certain times to pre-
vent the formation of antibodies. Rhogam and Rhophylac are two common 
preparations of anti-D globulin. If the baby’s father is Rh-positive and you’re 
Rh-negative, your doctor may recommend that you receive anti-D immune 
globulin at the following times:
 
✓ Within 72 hours of delivery (either vaginal or cesarean). A nurse gives 
the injection after delivery in order to prevent problems in future 
pregnancies.
 
✓ Routinely at about 28 weeks gestation (as a precaution, just in case any 
passage of blood across the placenta has already occurred) and again 12 
to 13 weeks later, if you haven’t already delivered.
 
✓ After amniocentesis, CVS (chorionic villus sampling), or any invasive 
procedure (see Chapter 8).
 
✓ After a miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic pregnancy (see Chapter 5 for 
more on ectopic pregnancy).
 
✓ After significant trauma to your abdomen during pregnancy, if your 
doctor thinks that some of the baby’s blood may have leaked into your 
circulation.
 
✓ After significant bleeding during pregnancy.
In unusual circumstances — either when the anti-D immune globulin wasn’t 
given but should have been (very rare) or when it didn’t work effectively 
(exceedingly rare) — a mother produces antibodies to the Rh factor. Then, 
if she ever becomes pregnant again, an Rh-positive fetus may be at risk of 
developing anemia (not enough red blood cells), depending on the levels 
of antibodies in the mother’s blood and how they interact with the baby’s 
blood. The anemia may be mild, requiring only that the baby be placed under 

314
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
special lights in the nursery to clear any extra bilirubin (a pigment that is 
released from red blood cells that are destroyed). If you have been sensitized 
and have developed these antibodies, your doctor can perform tests on 
amniotic fluid to check the baby’s Rh status. If the fetus is Rh(D)-negative, he 
is not at risk of anemia, even though the mother has the antibodies.
In moderate cases, frequent ultrasound exams may be necessary to assess 
the situation’s severity. Recently, a new technique using ultrasound to mea-
sure the blood flow through one of the blood vessels in the fetus’s brain (the 
middle cerebral artery, or MCA) has emerged as the best method for predict-
ing fetal anemia in at-risk pregnancies. If the mother is close to her due date, 
her practitioner may recommend an early delivery. In the most severe cases, 
the baby may need to have a blood transfusion while he is still inside the 
uterus. The procedure is called a fetal blood transfusion (see Chapter 6), and 
a maternal-fetal medicine specialist performs it. A transfusion is the worst-
case scenario, but even if things become this severe, a baby who has trans-
fusions in a timely fashion can be born healthy. However, this procedure is 
associated with some risks.
 
Determining the baby’s Rh(D) status by detecting fetal DNA in the mother’s 
blood is now possible. Practitioners in Europe routinely use this method, 
and it will probably become part of the routine prenatal care of Rh(D)-
negative women in the future in the United States. This test allows sensitized 
women to avoid invasive procedures for determining the fetal blood type, 
and it allows some women who aren’t sensitized to avoid the anti-D immune 
globulin injection.
Other blood mismatches
Other kinds of blood mismatches are possible. Kell, Duffy, and Kidd are a 
few examples of blood factors that can differ between mother and baby. 
Fortunately, all these factors are very rare. No Rhogam-like medications 
are available to treat these mismatches. But in the very few cases where a 
problem does occur, your practitioner can provide care for the babies in 
the other ways we describe previously for Rh incompatibility (special lights, 
early delivery, or blood transfusion). And these babies, too, are usually born 
healthy.
Finally, some blood group antibodies — Le, Lu, and P, for example — can 
be mismatched but have no harmful effects on the fetus. Usually, no special 
action is needed.

315
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
Dealing with Breech Presentation
A baby is in a so-called breech position when its buttocks or legs are down, 
closest to the cervix. Breech presentation happens in 3 to 4 percent of all 
singleton deliveries. A woman’s risk of having a breech baby decreases the 
further along she goes in her pregnancy. The fetus is more likely to assume a 
breech position for one of the following reasons:
 
✓ The fetus is preterm or especially small.
 
✓ An increased amount of amniotic fluid exists (all the more room to turn 
around in).
 
✓ A congenital malformation of the uterus is present (for example, a bicor-
nuate, or T-shaped, uterus).
 
✓ Fibroids that impinge on the uterine cavity are present.
 
✓ You have placenta previa (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ You’re having twins or more.
 
✓ Your uterus is relaxed from having had several babies already.
If your baby is in a breech position, your doctor talks with you about the 
potential risks and benefits of a vaginal breech delivery versus version (turn-
ing the baby) or cesarean section. Special concerns about a breech delivery 
include the following:
 
✓ Trapping the baby’s head (which comes out last in a breech delivery) in 
a cervix that has been incompletely dilated by the passage of the baby’s 
body, which is smaller than the head. (This situation is especially trou-
blesome if the baby is very small or premature.)
 
✓ Trauma resulting from an extended fetal head (meaning the head is tilted 
back).
 
✓ Difficulty delivering the arms, which can lead to potential arm injuries.
Because of these potential problems, many practitioners recommend that all 
breech babies be delivered by cesarean section. However, some fetuses in 
breech position are actually good candidates for vaginal delivery. Conditions 
that should be present for you and your doctor to consider a vaginal breech 
delivery include the following:
 
✓ Estimated fetal weight is between 4 and 8 pounds.
 
✓ The baby is in a frank breech position, which means the buttocks, not 
the feet, are positioned to come out first.

316
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
 
✓ The buttocks are engaged in the pelvis.
 
✓ Your doctor doesn’t detect (by physical exam or by X-ray) any problem 
with the baby’s head fitting through the birth canal.
 
✓ Ultrasound shows the fetal head is either flexed (chin to chest) or in the 
military position (looking straight ahead, not tilted back).
 
✓ Immediate anesthesia is available so that cesarean delivery can be done 
in an emergency.
 
✓ The doctor is experienced in vaginal breech deliveries.
A few recent large studies have shown that breech babies delivered vaginally 
are at a higher risk for certain complications. In fact, the information is so com-
pelling that most obstetricians have stopped performing vaginal breech deliv-
eries. However, studies show that while the short-term complications were 
higher in the babies born vaginally, there was no difference in long-term prob-
lems (combined death and neurodevelopmental delays) at two years of age.
If you and your practitioner decide that a vaginal breech delivery isn’t right 
for you, another option is external cephalic version, a procedure in which 
the doctor tries to turn the baby into normal delivery position by externally 
manipulating the mother’s abdomen, which is a common and usually safe 
procedure. Sometimes it’s fairly uncomfortable, but it works in about 50 to 70 
percent of cases. The use of spinal or epidural anesthesia for the version may 
decrease the discomfort for the mother and improve the chances of success-
fully turning the baby.
There are certain conditions in which external cephalic version isn’t advis-
able, such as bleeding, low amniotic fluid level, or in multiple gestations.
Pondering Post-Date Pregnancy
The average pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks (or 280 days) after the last men-
strual period, but only about 5 percent of women deliver on their due date. 
Some deliver a couple of weeks earlier and some a couple of weeks later, and 
all are considered to be “at term.” You don’t have a post-term pregnancy, 
according to the medical definition, until you go beyond 42 weeks. Only a 
small number of pregnancies last longer than 42 weeks, and no one knows 
why they do.
Why should you or your practitioner care whether you go past your due 
date? We care because the chance of certain complications rises as time goes 
on. From 40 to 42 weeks, the increased risks are small, but after 42 weeks, 
they climb into a range that is more worrisome. The worst complication is 
perinatal death (also called perinatal mortality). The chances of perinatal 
death start to increase after 41 to 42 weeks and double by 43 weeks.

317
 Chapter 16: When Things Get Complicated
 
This situation isn’t as scary as it may sound, though, because the actual 
number of deaths is so low. The vast majority of late babies are born healthy. 
Even at 44 weeks, the point at which perinatal mortality rates quadruple, 95 
percent of babies are fine if appropriate testing is done. Your doctor can help 
you make the best decision for you as to the safe timing of delivery.
The increase in mortality rates in post-date pregnancies involves several fac-
tors, including
 
✓ The placenta can function efficiently for only a finite length of time — 
about 40 weeks. Fortunately, most placentas have some amount of 
“reserve,” and they still work well beyond 40 weeks. But in a few rare 
cases, they don’t last as well. If a placenta can’t get enough nutrients to 
the baby, the baby may actually lose some weight by remaining inside 
the uterus.
 
✓ In a post-date pregnancy, the volume of amniotic fluid may decrease. 
As we mention earlier in this chapter, amniotic fluid volume peaks at 
about 34 to 36 weeks gestation and starts to slowly drop after that. Most 
of the time, adequate fluid is left after 40 weeks. Sometimes, however, 
the fluid level drops into a range doctors consider too low. In this situa-
tion, the umbilical cord has a chance of becoming compressed, and doc-
tors may recommend that labor be induced.
 
✓ Babies can sometimes pass their first bowel movement while they’re 
still inside the uterus. The longer a pregnancy lasts, the more likely 
this is to happen. In rare instances, the baby may breathe in this thick 
meconium, either before or during birth, which can cause problems with 
breathing in the first few days or weeks after birth (for more informa-
tion, see Chapter 10).
 
✓ In a post-date pregnancy in which the placenta continues to function 
normally, the baby keeps growing. These late babies are more likely 
to be very large (macrosomic; see “Describing Problems with Fetal 
Growth,” earlier in this chapter), or large for gestational age. So they 
may be at risk for all the problems that come with being extra-large.
Practitioners use various strategies to manage post-date pregnancies, none of 
which is inherently better than another. Some want to be sure all babies are 
delivered as soon after 40 weeks as feasible and induce labor to ensure that 
they are. (See Chapter 10 for more information on labor induction.) Others 
are willing to wait longer for spontaneous labor. The argument for the first 
approach is that you don’t have to worry about any of the aforementioned 
complications. With the second approach, on the other hand, you may have 
less chance of needing a cesarean delivery.

Pregnancy in Sickness 
and in Health
In This Chapter
▶ Treating infections from the common cold to bladder infections
▶ Handling asthma, diabetes, and other preexisting health problems
P
regnancy may give you a “maternal glow” and make you feel as if something 
magical is happening to your body. But face it: Pregnancy doesn’t make 
you superhuman. You’re still susceptible to all the illnesses and other health 
problems that can affect anyone who’s not expecting a baby. When illnesses 
arise during pregnancy, they can have special consequences. In this chapter, we 
talk about how a variety of medical conditions affect pregnant women.
Getting an Infection While Pregnant
Try as you may, avoiding every person who’s carrying an infection during 
your pregnancy may be impossible. Keep in mind that most infections don’t 
hurt the baby at all; they just make life more uncomfortable for you for a 
while. In this section, we cover the most common infections as well as some 
of the more unusual ones.
Bladder and kidney infections
Bladder infections come in two basic types: with and without symptoms. 
Silent (symptom-free) bladder infections are common, occurring in about 6 
percent of pregnant women. The other kind, called cystitis, comes with symp-
toms that include
 
✓ Constantly feeling that you need to urinate
 
✓ Discomfort above your pubic bone (where the bladder is)

320
Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
 
✓ More frequent urination
 
✓ Pain with urination
If you develop either type of bladder infection, your doctor treats it with 
antibiotics.
If left untreated, a bladder infection can progress into a kidney infection, also 
known as pyelonephritis. A kidney infection produces the same symptoms as 
cystitis, plus high fevers and flank pain — pain over one or both kidneys (see 
Figure 17-1). Flank pain also can occur in someone who has kidney stones. 
The difference: A kidney infection causes a constant pain, whereas kidney 
stones produce more severe, but intermittent, pain. Also, kidney stones are 
more often accompanied by small quantities of blood in the urine.
If your practitioner diagnoses you with pyelonephritis, she may want to 
admit you to the hospital for a few days so that you can get intravenous anti-
biotics. Because kidney infections tend to recur during pregnancy, your prac-
titioner may also want to keep you on a daily antibiotic for the remainder of 
your pregnancy.

Chickenpox
The varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox. The first time someone comes 
down with an infection caused by this virus, usually in childhood, she gets 
chickenpox. Chickenpox is pretty rare in adults, and pregnant women stand 
no greater risk of contracting this virus than nonpregnant people do.
If you have already had chickenpox, you aren’t likely to get it again because 
your body has produced antibodies that make you immune. Even if you’ve 
never had chickenpox, you have a good chance of having these protective 
antibodies in your blood because you’ve probably had some exposure to 
the virus in the past, even though it didn’t produce any illness. However, if 
you know that you’ve never been exposed to chickenpox and you haven’t 
recently been vaccinated (a vaccine against this virus now exists), or if 
you’re unsure about your prior exposure, have your blood checked to see 
whether you’re immune.
 
Because the chickenpox vaccine is relatively new, we have very little informa-
tion about how safe it is for pregnant women, which is why the vaccine’s man-
ufacturer recommends that pregnant women be given it after delivery. The 
recommendation is that women wait three months after receiving the vaccine 
before they get pregnant. If you get the vaccine and then suddenly find out 
you were pregnant at the time, let your doctor know. The little experience that 
pregnant women have had with the vaccine suggests that it probably doesn’t 
increase the chances of birth defects, nor has it led to any cases of congenital 
varicella syndrome (see the bulleted list that follows) in the baby.
 
If you aren’t immune to chickenpox and you’re exposed to someone with the 
infection, let your practitioner know immediately so that you can receive an 
injection known as VZIG (varicella zoster immune globulin), which may reduce 
the risk of infection to you and the baby. Get this injection within three days of 
exposure, if possible. If you contract chickenpox within several days of giving 
birth (before or after), your baby should receive VZIG.
Chickenpox can cause three potential problems during pregnancy:
 
✓ It can make the mother ill with flu-like symptoms, plus the infamous skin 
rash (lots of little red blemishes). In rare circumstances, pneumonia 
develops two to six days after the rash appears. If you have chickenpox 
and you develop symptoms like shortness of breath or a dry cough, let 
your doctor know right away.
 
✓ If you contract chickenpox during the first four months of pregnancy, 
the fetus has a small chance of developing the infection, too, leading to 
congenital varicella syndrome. With this syndrome, the fetus can have 
scarring (the same kinds of scars that little kids get on their bodies from 
chickenpox), some abnormal development of the limbs, problems with 
growth, and developmental delays.

322
Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
 
 Fortunately, congenital varicella syndrome is very rare. (It happens in 
less than 1 percent of cases in which the infection occurs in the first tri-
mester, 2 percent if in the early second trimester.)
 
✓ If you contract chickenpox within the interval from five days before to 
five days after giving birth, the baby is at risk for developing a serious 
varicella infection in the newborn period. You can greatly reduce this 
chance by giving the baby VZIG.
The same varicella zoster virus that causes chickenpox can also produce 
a recurrent form of the infection called shingles or herpes zoster. Most 
babies born to pregnant women who develop shingles are completely normal. 
Because shingles is much less common than chickenpox in pregnancy, doc-
tors don’t really know how common birth defects are after a pregnant woman 
develops this condition, although the incidence is thought to be less than the 1 
to 2 percent seen with chickenpox.
 
If you know that you’re susceptible to chickenpox, avoid direct contact with 
anyone who has shingles or herpes zoster because their lesions contain the vari-
cella zoster virus and can cause a chickenpox infection in susceptible women.
Colds and flu

Most people get a cold about once a year, so the fact that most women get 
one during pregnancy isn’t surprising. Nothing about pregnancy makes you 
more vulnerable to a cold virus, but the fatigue and congestion that go along 
with pregnancy can make a cold seem worse. In any case, the common cold is 
perfectly harmless to the developing fetus. As we all know, there is no cure, so 
the only option is to treat the symptoms. Contrary to popular belief, most cold 
medications — antihistamines, cough suppressants, and the like — are safe 
for pregnant women when taken in the recommended doses.
Following are a few suggestions for dealing with cold and flu symptoms:
 
✓ Drink fluids, fluids, and more fluids. All viral illnesses promote dehy-
dration, and being pregnant only makes the problem more extreme. 
Drink plenty of water, juice, or soda when you have a cold or the flu. 
Stay away from milk.
 
✓ Take a fever reducer. Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) in the recom-
mended doses is okay to help bring a fever down. This action alone 
helps some people feel better. If your fever persists for more than a few 
days, however, call your doctor.
 
✓ Take a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) is the decongestant 
of choice during pregnancy. No evidence suggests that Sudafed taken in 
normal doses after the first trimester has any harmful effects. This state-
ment is probably true for the first trimester, too, but few studies have 
been done on it.

✓ Try nasal spray, but not for long. Nasal spray decongestants are okay 
if you use them only short-term (the same is true for people who aren’t 
pregnant). Used intermittently, decongestant sprays may allow you to 
breathe more comfortably. Used day after day, they may only make the 
problem last longer. Saline nasal sprays are fine long-term, but they 
often aren’t as effective in reducing congestion.
 
✓ Eat some comfort food. Last, but certainly not least, eat some chicken 
soup. Scientific studies have shown that chicken soup has properties that 
help cold sufferers feel better, even though no one knows exactly what 
those properties are. (See Joanne’s mother’s recipe in the nearby sidebar.)
You can use the same treatments for the common cold and for influenza 
infections. If you get the flu while you’re pregnant, you’re likely to have the 
same experience as when you’re not pregnant.
Many of our patients ask about the use of echinacea during pregnancy. 
People in Asia have used this herb for centuries to fight inflammation and the 
common cold. Typically, people use a preparation or supplement contain-
ing echinacea when they feel the first signs of a cold coming on. No evidence 
suggests that echinacea causes a problem during pregnancy. The only study 
we found was one that included only a small number of patients. Although 
no adverse effects were found, drawing any conclusions from such a limited 
study is difficult.
 
If your fever persists for more than a few days, or if you develop a cough with 
greenish or yellow phlegm or have difficulty breathing, call your doctor to 
make sure that you’re not developing pneumonia.
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “Is getting the flu vaccine safe while I’m 
pregnant?”
A: Yes: The vaccine is completely safe. So if 
you’re likely to be around many people who 
are ill or if your local public health officials 
are predicting a particularly bad flu season, 
you may want to consider getting the vaccine. 
Remember, the vaccine doesn’t protect against 
all flu viruses, only the ones that researchers 
believe will be common in your area.

Seasonal allergies and hay fever
People commonly take antihistamines to treat seasonal allergies. The older, 
first-generation medications, such as chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton 
or Sinutab), have been around for a long time, and most obstetricians are 
comfortable with their use in pregnancy. The newer antihistamines, such 
as Claritin or Zyrtec, have an additional benefit of not causing as much 
drowsiness. Although researchers haven’t studied these newer medications 
as much in pregnancy, we know of no reports of an increased risk for fetal 
malformations or adverse effects. A third option is a nasal spray containing 
cromolyn or low-dose steroids that are also very effective.
Mother Regina’s chicken soup recipe
Rely on this classic pick-me-up to help you 
through a cold or the flu.
4 quarts water
1 chicken, cut in large pieces
3 onions, peeled and quartered
4 parsnips, peeled and halved
6 celery stalks, halved
6 carrots, peeled and halved
4 tablespoons fresh parsley
4 tablespoons fresh dill
Salt and pepper to taste
2 to 4 chicken bouillon cubes
 1. Put water and chicken in a large stockpot 
and bring to a boil. Skim off froth.
 2. Add onions, parsnips, celery, carrots, and 
salt and pepper.
 3. Cover and simmer for 2 hours.
 4. Add bouillon cubes (2 to 4, to taste).
 5. Add parsley and dill.
 6. Simmer for another hour.
 7. Strain broth into another container, reserv-
ing the chicken and discarding the vegeta-
bles.
 8. When cool enough to handle, cut up the 
chicken meat and use for chicken salad or 
whatever you want.
 9. Eat right away or, if possible, refrigerate 
overnight and then strain off the solidified 
fat that accumulates on top of the broth.
Tip: Add cooked noodles to make chicken 
noodle soup.

 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral illness that’s common among preschool-age 
children. The symptoms are very similar to the ones you get with the flu — 
fatigue, malaise, and aches. In most cases, though, an infection produces no 
symptoms at all. By the time they’re old enough to have children, more than 
half of women have already had a CMV infection at some time in their lives, 
as evidenced by antibodies present in their blood.
Most practitioners don’t routinely test for antibodies because of the very small 
chance that a woman would acquire the infection during pregnancy. Also, the 
infection doesn’t usually cause any symptoms, so a woman would have to be 
repeatedly tested to see whether she develops the infection during her preg-
nancy. However, checking for susceptibility to the infection (that is, checking 
for antibodies) in women who are at higher risk — for example, women in close 
contact with preschool-age children — may be useful.
The importance of CMV infection during pregnancy is that the virus can pass 
to the fetus and cause a congenital infection. Actually, congenital CMV is the 
most common cause of an infection inside the uterus, and it occurs in 0.5 to 
2.5 percent of all newborns. However, most of the time, babies born with this 
infection are healthy at birth.

If you do develop CMV during pregnancy (and only 2 percent of susceptible 
pregnant women do), only about one-third of the time is the infection trans-
mitted to the fetus. Options for diagnosing the fetal infection include undergo-
ing amniocentesis to check for evidence of infection in the amniotic fluid and 
ultrasound exams. Even in those babies who contract CMV, 90 percent have 
no symptoms of the infection at birth (although a small percentage experience 
symptoms later in life, such as hearing loss or developmental problems).
If your baby contracts CMV in utero, the chances of the baby having serious 
problems vary according to the following:
 
✓ The baby’s gestational age when the infection occurs
 
✓ Whether the mother comes down with CMV for the first time during 
pregnancy (a primary infection) or whether she ever had it in the past (a 
recurrent infection)
If the mother comes down with the infection after the second trimester or if 
it is a recurrent infection, the chance of serious problems in the newborn is 
much less.

326
Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
Severe symptomatic congenital CMV is rare and occurs in only about 1 in 
10,000 to 20,000 newborns. It can lead to hearing impairment, visual prob-
lems, and even some mental deficiencies. Because CMV is a virus, antibiotics 
don’t help.
German measles (Rubella)
The rubella virus causes German measles, which are the only kind that have 
any significant impact on pregnancy. If you contract rubella within the first 
trimester, the baby has about a 20 percent chance of developing congenital 
rubella syndrome. The chance of this, however, varies even within the first 
trimester from the first month to the third month. Fortunately, acute rubella 
infection during pregnancy is extremely uncommon because most people in 
the United States are vaccinated at childhood.
Hepatitis
Various types of hepatitis affect the mother and baby in different ways:
 
✓ Hepatitis A is transmitted by person-to-person contact or by exposure 
to contaminated food and water. Serious complications from hepatitis 
A in pregnancy are rare. The virus isn’t passed to the developing baby. 
If you’re exposed during pregnancy, take immune globulin within two 
weeks after exposure.
 
✓ Hepatitis B virus is transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous 
drug use, or through a blood transfusion. A small percentage of women 
with hepatitis B infection have a chronic condition, which can lead 
to liver damage. Although not that common, hepatitis B infection can 
be transmitted to the fetus. If you’re positive for hepatitis B infection, 
inform the baby’s pediatrician after delivery, so that the baby can 
receive the appropriate immunizations.
 
✓ Hepatitis C is transmitted in the same way as hepatitis B. Less than 5 
percent of hepatitis C-positive women transmit the infection to their 
baby. If you’re positive for this virus, you should not breast-feed.
 
✓ Hepatitis D, E, and G are much less common. Ask your practitioner if 
you want more information.

327
 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
Herpes infections
Herpes is a common virus that infects the mouth, the throat, the skin, and 
the genital tract. If you have a history of herpes, rest assured that the infec-
tion poses no risk to the developing fetus. The main concern is that you may 
have an active genital herpes lesion when you go into labor or when your 
water breaks. If you do, there is a small risk of transmitting the infection to 
the baby as she passes through the birth canal. If it’s your first herpes infec-
tion, the chance of the fetus contracting the virus is greater because you 
have no antibodies to the virus. Studies show that women with a history of 
recurrent herpes may lower the chance of having an active herpes infection 
at delivery by taking a medication called acyclovir or valcyclovir in the last 
month of pregnancy.
 
If you have active genital herpes lesions at the time of labor or ruptured mem-
branes, let your practitioner know. She is likely to perform a cesarean delivery 
to avoid infecting the baby. If you see no lesions, but you feel as if you may 
be developing them, also tell your doctor. In this case, having a cesarean may 
also be advisable.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Over the past few years, studies have shown that some of the medications 
used to treat HIV infection can dramatically reduce the chance of the virus 
being transmitted from a mother to her baby. For this reason, doctors rec-
ommend that women undergo HIV testing early in pregnancy, and that if a 
woman is HIV-positive, she receives these medications during pregnancy as 
well as during labor. Some states even require that every pregnant woman be 
tested, and if the testing hasn’t been performed, that her newborn be tested 
prior to discharge from the hospital.
In order to decrease the chance of your baby becoming infected with HIV, avoid 
any invasive procedures that can cause bleeding, such as amniocentesis or CVS, 
unless they’re absolutely required. If your doctor performs these procedures, 
most doctors recommend the mother receive IV doses of antiviral medica-
tions immediately beforehand to minimize the chance of infecting the fetus.
 
Depending on your individual situation, most experts recommend that you not 
breast-feed if you’re infected with HIV because you may transmit the virus to 
your baby. Whatever form of birth control you choose, the additional use of 
condoms is absolutely necessary.
If you’re HIV-positive, maintain close contact with HIV specialists so that you 
may benefit from the ever-improving treatments.

328
Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
Listeria
Many women ask us about whether they can eat “soft” cheese. What they’re 
usually concerned about is an infection called listeriosis that is caused by 
eating food contaminated with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria 
is a cause for concern because it can lead to fetal infection, miscarriage, or 
preterm birth. When infection occurs during pregnancy, antibiotics given 
promptly can often prevent infection of the fetus or newborn.
Listeria can be found in a variety of different foods — packaged salads, hot 
dogs, luncheon meats, cheeses, and raw fruits and vegetables. Cheese is a 
concern because some outbreaks of listeria have been reported with certain 
unpasteurized cheeses. In the United States, all cheese that is sold is sup-
posed to be either pasteurized or, if it’s raw, aged for 60 days (the aging 
process prevents the growth of the bacteria). The good news is that it really 
is quite uncommon. The chance of contracting listeria during pregnancy is 
about 0.12 percent.
 
Because of the rarity of infection and the ubiquity of the bacteria — and because 
you can’t avoid eating everything! — we advise patients to limit their exposure to 
the highest-risk foods only:
 
✓ Don’t eat hot dogs from the fridge without heating them completely.
 
✓ Make sure the cheese you eat is either pasteurized or aged.
 
✓ Wash all raw vegetables well.
Lyme disease
Lyme disease is an infection transmitted through a deer tick bite. Pregnancy 
doesn’t predispose you to getting Lyme disease or make it any worse if you 
get it. The great news is that no evidence suggests that Lyme disease causes 
any harm to the fetus. The main problem is that it may make you sick.
 
If you think a deer tick has bitten you, let your practitioner know. She may 
want to draw blood to see whether you have contracted Lyme disease and 
possibly start you on antibiotics to prevent long-term effects.
Parvovirus infection (Fifth disease)
Parvovirus is a common childhood infection that comes with a fever and a 
characteristic “slapped cheek” rash. In adults, the infection can bring on flu-
like symptoms — fever, aches, sore throat, runny nose, and joint pain, but 

329
 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
may not cause a rash at all. Or it may come without any symptoms whatso-
ever. Three-fourths of all pregnant women are immune to parvovirus, so even 
if they’re exposed to someone who has it, no problems come of it.
 
If you aren’t immune to parvovirus or don’t know whether you are and you 
come in contact with an infected person, let your practitioner know so that 
you can be tested. Pregnant women who spend a great deal of time around 
school-age children (teachers or daycare workers, for example) may undergo 
routine testing before pregnancy or in the early first trimester.
Even if you contract this illness, chances are very good that your baby will 
be born healthy. No evidence indicates that parvovirus causes any birth 
defects. However, in rare cases, it can increase the risk of early miscarriage 
or the development of anemia in the fetus. For this reason, your practitioner 
may recommend that you have periodic ultrasound exams to look for signs 
of fetal anemia and to measure blood flow in a particular blood vessel brain, 
which can also indicate fetal anemia. (These are called MCA or middle cere-
bral artery Dopplers and are usually done on a weekly basis for 12 weeks after 
exposure.) If anemia does occur, doctors can perform a fetal blood transfu-
sion (see Chapter 6) while the baby is still inside you or suggest that the 
baby be delivered, if you’re toward the end of pregnancy.
The ultimate good news: Recent studies show that babies infected with par-
vovirus during pregnancy, even if they develop anemia, are likely to be born 
as healthy as any other baby if they’re adequately treated.
Stomach viruses (Gastroenteritis)
A bout of stomach flu can occur any time, regardless of whether you’re preg-
nant. Symptoms include stomach cramps, fever, diarrhea, and nausea, with 
or without vomiting, and they last anywhere from 24 to 72 hours. The viruses 
that cause gastroenteritis usually don’t harm your baby.

Don’t worry that your baby won’t get adequate nutrition if you can’t eat for a 
few days. Fetuses do just fine even when their mothers miss a few meals.
 
If you get a stomach virus, make sure that you drink plenty of liquids. Dehydration 
can lead to premature contractions and can contribute to fatigue and dizziness. 
Try the chicken soup we mention earlier, as well as other liquids — water, ginger 
ale, tea, or broth. Take care of yourself in the same way you would if you weren’t 
pregnant. If your symptoms persist for more than 72 hours, call your doctor.

330
Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite that lives in raw meat and 
in cat feces. If the parasite enters a person’s bloodstream, it may lead to flu-
like symptoms or, in some cases, no symptoms at all. This type of infection 
is very rare in the United States, and infections in pregnant women are rarer 
still, occurring in only 2 out of every 1,000 women, whereas in France, 
infection is more common.
If a pregnant woman is infected, the chance that she will transmit the infec-
tion to her baby, and the possible effects it may have, depend largely on 
when she contracts it. If she contracts it during the first trimester, the chance 
of the baby becoming infected is less than 2 percent. Later on in pregnancy, 
the chance of the baby being infected is greater, but the effects of infection 
are less severe. In a fetus, early toxoplasmosis infection can cause abnormali-
ties of the central nervous system and in vision.
 
If you’ve had the infection in the past and therefore have antibodies in your 
blood, you’re highly unlikely to get the infection again. If a screening indi-
cates that you may have been recently infected, your practitioner is likely to 
have your blood tested by a special laboratory to confirm that the positive 
test result was real. (Many initial tests produce false positives.) If the result 
still comes back positive, and you appear to have contracted the infection 
after you became pregnant, your practitioner can give you special antibiotics 
to reduce the chance of the fetus becoming infected. Then, in the second tri-
mester, your practitioner may perform an amniocentesis to find out whether 
the fetus has been infected. If so, taking additional antibiotics for the rest of 
the pregnancy is necessary. Your practitioner may advise you to consult a 
maternal-fetal medicine specialist to discuss all your options.
If you get toxoplasmosis, keep in mind that recent studies from France 
indicate that the vast majority of fetuses infected with the parasite who are 
treated with appropriate antibiotics have an excellent prognosis.
 
No vaccine exists to prevent toxoplasmosis. The best way to avoid the disease 
is to minimize your exposure to raw or undercooked meat. Skip the carpac-
cio. Order your steaks cooked at least medium. Also avoid cat feces. If you 
have an outdoor cat, ask someone else to change the litter. (Indoor cats that 
have never been outdoors and never come in contact with mice or rats are 
extremely unlikely to have the parasite.) If no one else can do it, wear rubber 
gloves when you change the litter. Also wear gloves if you work in a garden 
that neighborhood cats may play in.

 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
Vaginal infections
Bacteria and other organisms, when given half a chance, readily make them-
selves at home in a vagina, where the conditions — warm and moist — are 
perfect for them to grow and reproduce. A woman can get an infection at any 
time, even when she’s pregnant.
Bacterial vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection. Symptoms include a 
whitish-yellow, odorous discharge that gets worse after sexual intercourse. 
Research has linked BV to a slightly higher risk for premature delivery, which 
is why some practitioners screen for BV in patients known to be at risk for 
preterm delivery. Treatment includes oral antibiotics or vaginal antibiotic 
creams.
Chlamydia
Chlamydia is one of the more common sexually transmitted diseases. It often 
comes with no symptoms. Some practitioners routinely perform a culture 
from the cervix to check for chlamydia at the same time they do a PAP smear. 
If you have a positive culture, your doctor will prescribe a medication to 
treat the infection. Chlamydia can be passed to your newborn during vaginal 
delivery, increasing the chance of the baby developing conjunctivitis (an 
eye infection) or, less likely, pneumonia. Most hospitals routinely place an 
ointment in a newborn’s eyes shortly after delivery to prevent conjunctivitis, 
regardless of whether the mother is infected with chlamydia.
Yeast infections
Yeast infections are very common in pregnancy. The large amounts of 
estrogen that circulate in the bloodstream during pregnancy promote the 
growth of yeast in the vagina. Symptoms of an infection are vaginal itching 
and a thick, whitish-yellow discharge. However, many women get infections 
without any symptoms. Often the only treatment needed is a short course of 
vaginal suppositories or creams. For stubborn infections, your doctor can 
prescribe oral medications.

Handling Prepregnancy Conditions
The following sections detail conditions that you may have before you get 
pregnant and how those conditions may affect your pregnancy and vice versa.
Asthma
Predicting how pregnancy can affect a woman’s asthma is difficult. Some 
women find that their condition improves when they’re expecting. Some find 
it gets worse, and about half notice no difference at all.
The main concern that women with asthma have is whether they can safely 
continue taking their medications during pregnancy. Remember, the biggest 
problem with asthma isn’t the medications but the possibility of pregnant 
women with asthma under-treating themselves. If you’re having trouble breath-
ing, you may not be getting enough oxygen to the baby. Most commonly used 
asthma treatments are quite safe for the baby, including the following:
 
✓ Beta-agonists (serevent, albuterol, metaproterenol, terbutaline, 
Proventil, Allupent)
 
✓ Corticosteroids (Prednisone)
 
✓ Cromolyn sodium
 
✓ Theophylline (Theodur)
 
✓ Inhaled steroids (Flovent, Vanceril, Beclavent, Azmacort, and so on)
You can take preventive measures to control acute attacks. Predicting 
attacks by self-monitoring is useful for asthmatic patients with peak expira-
tory flow rates (most asthma patients know what these are — if you don’t, 
ask your lung specialist). Naturally, it helps to avoid situations that trigger 
attacks.
Chronic hypertension
Chronic hypertension refers to high blood pressure that occurs independently 
of pregnancy. Although many women who have this condition are aware that 
they have it before they conceive, doctors occasionally diagnose it during 
pregnancy. If you have mild or moderate chronic hypertension, chances are 
good that you’ll have an uneventful pregnancy. However, your doctor will be 
on the lookout for certain conditions that can affect you or the baby.

333
 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
 
Women with chronic hypertension stand an increased risk of developing 
preeclampsia, so your doctor looks for any signs that you’re developing this 
condition. The main risk for the baby is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) 
or placental abruption (see Chapter 16). Your doctor may use repeated sono-
grams to check on the baby’s growth and to make sure that you have adequate 
amniotic fluid. She may also suggest that you undergo some tests later during 
your pregnancy for fetal well-being, such as non-stress tests (see Chapter 8). 
The overall management of your pregnancy depends on how well-controlled 
your blood pressure is, your overall health, and how the baby grows.
Deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolus
A deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops within a deep 
vein, most commonly in the leg. A pulmonary embolus is a blood clot within 
the lung, which is often a clot that has dislodged from one of the deep veins 
of the leg and made its way to the lung. Both of these conditions are rare, 
affecting far less than 1 percent of pregnant women.
Symptoms of a DVT include pain, swelling, and tenderness, usually in the calf, 
and a rope-like hardness running down the back of the lower leg. Diagnosing 
DVT before it has the chance to lead to a pulmonary embolus is important.
 
Keep in mind that muscle pain, cramping, and swelling are common symptoms 
of a normal pregnancy, and a DVT is quite unusual. Let your doctor know 
when you’re experiencing the sudden onset of these symptoms, but don’t 
panic about them.
Our patients want to know . . .
Q: “Are blood pressure medications safe?”
A: Most medications are safe, but many haven’t 
been well-studied during pregnancy. Discuss 
this important question with your doctor. 
Certain medications, however, should be 
avoided. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibi-
tors (known as ACE inhibitors) pose some risk 
for kidney problems in the fetus. Beta-blockers, 
although considered quite safe, pose a very 
small risk of IUGR (intrauterine growth restric-
tion). Also, diuretics are better avoided, unless 
this is the only way of treating the high blood 
pressure.

Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
Diabetes
Diabetes comes up as a problem in pregnancy in two ways:
 
✓ You already have the condition before you become pregnant.
 
✓ You develop what’s called gestational diabetes, which is unique to 
pregnancy and usually goes away after pregnancy.
Diabetes before pregnancy
If you have a history of diabetes, talk to your doctor about it before you get 
pregnant. If you have your blood sugar level under good control before you 
conceive, your pregnancy is more likely to proceed smoothly. Women with 
pregestational diabetes stand a higher-than-average risk of having a fetus 
with certain birth defects, but you can reduce this risk down to the normal 
range if you achieve excellent glucose control.
Some doctors suggest that you have a blood test called a hemoglobin A1C 
to check how well your sugar has been controlled over the past few months. 
Your doctor may also suggest that you have a special sonogram, called a 
fetal echocardiogram (see Chapter 8), to make sure that the baby’s heart is 
okay. If you take an oral medication to control your blood sugar, your practi-
tioner may suggest you switch to insulin injections for better control. Some 
women with diabetes suffer kidney complications, but this kind of problem 
isn’t likely to worsen during pregnancy. If you have eye problems related to 
diabetes (proliferative retinopathy), have your doctor closely monitor and 
possibly treat your eyes during pregnancy.

The vast majority of diabetic women proceed through pregnancy without 
a hitch. However, your doctor may need to adjust your insulin dose. Your 
doctor also follows the baby’s growth with periodic ultrasound exams and 
is on the lookout to see that you don’t develop high blood pressure. In the 
third trimester, your doctor probably begins to monitor the fetus closely, 
performing certain tests for fetal well-being (periodic NSTs, for example — 
see Chapter 8).
Expectant mothers ask . . .
Q: “If I develop gestational diabetes, will I 
recover when my pregnancy ends?”
A: Most women do recover completely, but 
a minority remains diabetic. In these cases, 
pregnancy itself didn’t cause the diabetes. 
Instead, the women were already at risk for 
developing the condition. If you develop ges-
tational diabetes, being tested for diabetes 
within a few months after you deliver is impor-
tant. Also, keep in mind that your risk for devel-
oping diabetes at some point later in your life 
increases.

335
 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
When you’re in labor, your doctor keeps a close eye on your glucose level 
and may give you insulin. With optimal glucose control and close monitoring 
of the baby and mother-to-be, most women with diabetes have an excellent 
outlook for pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes is one of the most common medical complications in 
pregnancy, occurring in 2 to 3 percent of all pregnant women. Your practitio-
ner can diagnose gestational diabetes by giving you a special blood test. (See 
Chapter 8 for more information about this test.)
If you have gestational diabetes and you don’t control your glucose levels, 
your baby may be at higher risk for certain problems. If your blood sugar 
levels are high, the fetus’s are, too. And high blood sugar levels cause the 
fetus to produce certain hormones that stimulate fetal growth, which may 
cause her to grow too large (see Chapter 16). Furthermore, if the fetus has 
high blood sugar levels while still in the uterus, she may have temporary 
problems with sugar regulation after birth. If the mother’s (and fetus’s) glu-
cose levels are controlled during pregnancy, the risk of these complications 
drops dramatically.
 
You need to control your sugar levels if you have gestational diabetes. Most of 
the time, altering your diet is enough. (Most women have a consultation with 
a nurse and/or a nutritionist to come up with a specific diet plan.) Exercise 
also helps. Only in rare cases do women need to resort to taking medication 
to keep their sugar level under control. Traditionally, doctors have prescribed 
insulin injections to control blood glucose levels, but recent research sug-
gests that an oral agent called glyburide is safe and effective. If you develop 
gestational diabetes, your doctor may ask you to check your sugar level sev-
eral times during the day or on a weekly basis. You do this by pricking your 
finger (called a fingerstick) and placing the drop of blood into a little portable 
machine that gives immediate results.
Fibroids
Fibroids (also called uterine myomas) are benign growths of the muscle cells 
that make up the uterus. They’re extremely common, and your practitioner 
often diagnoses them during routine sonograms. The high levels of estrogen 
in a pregnant woman’s bloodstream can encourage fibroids to grow larger. 
Yet, predicting whether any woman’s fibroids will grow, stay the same, or 
shrink during pregnancy is difficult. Most of the time, fibroids cause no 
problems for a pregnancy.

336
Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
In extreme cases, fibroids can cause difficulties, such as the following:
 
✓ Fibroids may grow so fast that they outgrow their blood supply and 
begin to degenerate, which sometimes causes pain, uterine contrac-
tions, and even preterm labor. Symptoms of degeneration include pain 
and tenderness directly over the fibroid (in the lower abdomen). Short-
term treatment with anti-inflammatory medications (Motrin or Indocin, 
for example) may help.
 
✓ Very large fibroids in the lower portion of the uterus or near the cervix 
may interfere with the baby’s ability to make its way through the birth 
canal. Thus, they may increase the risk for cesarean delivery, although 
this situation is quite unusual.
 
✓ Large fibroids within the uterus can sometimes increase the likelihood 
that the baby will be in the breech or transverse position. But this possi-
bility, too, is rare. Most commonly, fibroids cause no problem at all. And 
most often, they shrink in size after delivery.
Immunological problems
Immunological problems are conditions in which a person’s immune system 
produces atypical antibodies, which can lead to a variety of problems. In 
most cases, women who have immunological problems already know they 
have them before they become pregnant. If you’re one of those women, dis-
cuss your problem with your doctor before you become pregnant or as early 
in your pregnancy as possible.
Antiphospholipid antibodies
Antiphospholipid antibodies are a class of antibodies that circulate in some 
women’s blood. The two most common kinds are lupus anticoagulant and 
anticardiolipin antibodies. They may be found in some women with colla-
gen vascular diseases (such as lupus), in women who have had blood clots, 
and in some women with no known medical problems. They’re significant in 
pregnancy because they have been associated with recurrent miscarriages, 
unexplained fetal death, early onset of preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth 
restriction. Doctors don’t routinely screen for these antibodies because many 
women who have them experience no resulting problems. But if you have one 
of the following conditions, your doctor will probably want to test you:
 
✓ Autoimmune platelet conditions
 
✓ A false positive test for syphilis
 
✓ A history of spontaneous blood clots in the legs or lungs
 
✓ A history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks (a “temporary” 
kind of stroke)
 
✓ Lupus (or other collagen vascular disease)

337
 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
Your doctor may also want to test you if you have had any of the following 
obstetrical problems in the past:
 
✓ Early-onset preeclampsia
 
✓ Problems with fetal growth (intrauterine growth restriction)
 
✓ Recurrent miscarriages
 
✓ Unexplained stillbirth or fetal death
Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is diagnosed when a woman has 
antiphospholipid antibodies in her bloodstream plus one of the listed risk 
factors. If you have the syndrome, depending on its severity, your doctor 
may recommend that you take baby aspirin, heparin, oral steroids, or some 
combination of these medications. She probably will also recommend that 
you have periodic ultrasound exams to make sure that the baby is growing 
appropriately, and that you undergo tests for fetal well-being (see Chapter 8).

We realize that this syndrome may sound scary, but the good news is that 
most women who receive adequate medical care have normal pregnancies 
and healthy babies.
Lupus
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is one of several so-called col-
lagen vascular diseases. Pregnancy doesn’t make the disease worse, but some 
women do experience more flare-ups during pregnancy.
On the other hand, lupus can affect pregnancy in some cases, depending on 
the problem’s severity going into pregnancy. If you have a mild form of lupus, 
chances are it will have little effect on your pregnancy. Some women with 
more severe lupus stand an increased risk of miscarriage, problems with fetal 
growth, and preeclampsia (see Chapter 16). Depending on your specific medi-
cal history, your doctor may recommend certain medications such as hepa-
rin, baby aspirin, or oral steroids. She may also recommend more frequent 
sonograms and other measures of fetal well-being. Your best bet for a suc-
cessful pregnancy is to have the disorder under control as much as possible 
before you become pregnant.
Inflammatory bowel disease
The two kinds of inflammatory bowel disease are Crohn’s disease and ulcer-
ative colitis. Fortunately, pregnancy does nothing to exacerbate either condi-
tion. If you have inflammatory bowel disease, but your symptoms were minor 
or nonexistent during the months before you became pregnant, chances 

338
Par t IV: Dealing with Special Concerns
are good that they will remain at bay during your pregnancy. Doctors often 
recommend that women whose symptoms are frequent and severe postpone 
pregnancy until the disease abates or is brought under control. Most medi-
cations to control symptoms are considered to be safe and effective during 
pregnancy.
Seizure disorders (Epilepsy)
Most women who have epilepsy can have an uneventful pregnancy and give 
birth to a perfectly healthy baby. However, epilepsy does require that a wom-
an’s obstetrician and her neurologist work together to come up with the right 
strategy for controlling seizures. If you have epilepsy, make an effort before 
you get pregnant to control your seizures with the lowest possible dose of 
medication. Studies show that women whose seizures are well-controlled 
on a minimal dose of a single medication before they get pregnant have the 
best pregnancy outcomes. So by all means, consult your neurologist before 
you get pregnant, and don’t stop taking your medications unless your doctor 
advises you to.
All medications used to treat seizures pose some risk of birth defects. The 
problems they can cause vary, depending on the particular medication, but 
they include facial abnormalities, cleft lip and cleft palate, congenital heart 
defects, and neural tube defects. For this reason, women who take seizure 
medications need to have an ultrasound to evaluate fetal anatomy and a fetal 
echocardiogram (see Chapter 8) to look for abnormalities in the baby’s heart.
 
Women with seizure disorders should begin taking extra folic acid about three 
months before trying to conceive, because some seizure medications can 
affect folic acid levels.
 
Don’t adjust or stop your medications on your own, especially after you 
become pregnant. Your seizure activity could increase, which would probably 
be worse for the developing baby than the medications themselves.
Thyroid problems
Problems with thyroid function are relatively common in women of reproduc-
tive age; we see many women with overactive or underactive thyroids during 
pregnancy. Although these conditions require extra testing, they usually 
don’t cause significant problems for pregnancy.

339
 Chapter 17: Pregnancy in Sickness and in Health
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
There are many different causes of hyperthyroidism, but the most common 
by far is Grave’s disease, which is associated with its own special set of anti-
bodies (thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins, or TSIs) in the blood. These 
antibodies cause the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Women 
with an overactive thyroid must receive adequate treatment during preg-
nancy (ideally, beginning before conception) in order to reduce their risk of 
such complications as miscarriage, preterm delivery, and low birth weight.
If you have an overactive thyroid, unless your condition is extremely mild, 
your doctor is most likely to recommend that you take certain medications 
to lower the amount of thyroid hormone circulating in your blood. Some 
of these medications may cross the placenta, so your doctor watches the 
fetus closely, usually by performing regular sonograms, to look for any 
evidence that the medications are lowering the baby’s thyroid levels too 
much. Specifically, she monitors the baby’s growth and heart rate to see that 
they’re normal and checks for any evidence that the fetus has developed a 
goiter (an enlarged thyroid).
Your doctor probably also will monitor the levels of thyroid-stimulating 
antibodies in your blood because these antibodies may, in some rare cases, 
cross the placenta and stimulate the baby’s thyroid as well. After delivery, 
your baby’s pediatrician watches the baby carefully for any evidence of thy-
roid problems.
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
A woman with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can have a healthy 
pregnancy as long as her condition is adequately treated. If it’s not, she 
stands a higher risk of developing certain complications, such as a low birth-
weight baby. The condition is treated with a thyroid replacement hormone 
(Synthroid, for example). This medication is safe for the baby because very 
little of it crosses the placenta. If you have an underactive thyroid, your 
doctor may want to periodically check your hormone levels to see whether 
your medication needs to be adjusted.

W
e wish we had no reason to include this chapter. We wish every preg-
nant couple could end up delivering a healthy baby. Most do, but not 
everyone is so fortunate. Those who suffer the loss of a fetus or discover that 
their baby has a significant abnormality need to understand what happens 
and figure out how to respond when things go wrong. If you’re experiencing 
any of the problems we cover in this chapter, we hope you find some of this 
information helpful.
Perhaps you’re drawn to this chapter because you’ve had an unsuccessful 
pregnancy in the past. If so, you may be anxious about your current preg-
nancy. That’s entirely normal. We take care of many women who have had 
poor outcomes in the past, and we realize the only thing that can truly allevi-
ate their anxiety is to hold a healthy baby.
 
One way to at least minimize your worry is to sit down with your doctor and 
discuss the situation. Ask him to map out a plan for your current pregnancy 
that maximizes your chances for a favorable outcome and helps you cope with 
your concerns. When you feel certain you’re doing everything you possibly 
can do to avoid a recurring problem, you may rest a little easier. Your worry 
probably won’t entirely disappear, but remember that although a certain part 
of the process is in Mother Nature’s hands, you can take medical steps to 
maximize your chances of having a healthy baby.

342
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Surviving Recurrent Miscarriages
Unfortunately, a first-trimester miscarriage is a fairly common occurrence. 
Doctors estimate that about 15 to 20 percent of recognized pregnancies — 
those that have yielded a positive pregnancy test — end up in miscarriage. 
Still more early embryos (also called conceptuses) are lost before they’re 
actually known to exist — that is, before a woman takes a pregnancy test. 
About half the time, the cause of first-trimester miscarriage is the presence 
of some chromosomal abnormality in the embryo or fetus. Another 20 per-
cent of early miscarriages are due to structural abnormalities in the embryo. 
Usually they’re spontaneous events with low chances of recurrence.
 
Fortunately, 80 to 90 percent of women who experience a single early 
miscarriage subsequently deliver a normal baby.
Recurrent miscarriage — technically, the loss of three consecutive 
pregnancies — is far less common. This problem occurs in only 1/2 to 1 
percent of women. A variety of causes contribute to recurrent miscarriage, 
including the following:
 
✓ Genetic causes
 
✓ Uterine abnormalities
 
✓ Immunologic causes (though not all physicians agree that this is a 
factor)
 
✓ Inadequate progesterone secretion
 
✓ Certain infections (although this cause is also controversial)
 
✓ Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or clotting disorders (see Chapter 17)
 
✓ Certain environmental toxins or drugs (such as antimalarials and some 
anesthetic agents)
Most doctors suggest that women undergo certain tests after having three mis-
carriages; some begin testing even sooner. Because chromosomal abnormali-
ties are the most common cause of miscarriage, an important first diagnostic 
step is to run tests on the chromosomes of the fetal tissue, when possible.
Various strategies for treating recurrent miscarriage are available, but doctors 
may disagree about which one, if any, is best. Choosing a strategy is easier 
if you know what the problem is. For example, your doctor may be able to 
surgically repair an abnormally shaped uterus. If doctors can’t find a cause 
for recurrent miscarriage, knowing which treatment is best may be difficult. 
Note, however, that even if no treatment is attempted, women who have had 
three consecutive miscarriages still have a greater than 50 percent chance of 
having a normal, successful pregnancy.

343
 Chapter 18: Coping with the Unexpected
Coping with Late-Pregnancy Loss
Late-pregnancy loss refers to a fetal death, stillbirth, or death of an infant in 
the immediate newborn period. Fortunately, these losses are infrequent and 
rarely occur more than once. Some causes of late losses include
 
✓ Chromosomal abnormalities
 
✓ Other genetic syndromes
 
✓ Structural defects
 
✓ A massive placental abruption or separation (see Chapter 16)
 
✓ Antiphospholipid antibodies or clotting disorders (see Chapter 17)
 
✓ Umbilical cord compression
 
✓ Unexplained reasons, which are, unfortunately, very common
 
Women who suffer a loss of pregnancy often ask, “Did I do something to cause 
this?” The answer is almost always no. So you have no reason to add to your 
grief by mixing in guilt. Many patients find it helpful, after the initial hurt has 
begun to subside, to gather all their pregnancy records, including any pathol-
ogy reports, and consult with their doctor or a specialist. Sometimes your 
doctor can identify a cause, and sometimes not. Either way, most patients 
benefit from sitting down with their doctor and mapping out a strategy for 
trying to prevent a loss in future pregnancies. Having a plan to focus on makes 
many patients feel less helpless. Support groups are also very helpful (see 
“Finding Help” later in this chapter).
In subsequent pregnancies, your doctor may recommend you undergo blood 
tests to check for certain abnormalities that have been associated with fetal 
loss. Often, if you have experienced a prior late-pregnancy loss, doctors 
follow your progress with regular ultrasound examinations and tests of fetal 
well-being. Your doctor may recommend you deliver somewhat early, before 
you go into labor. You’re likely to feel anxious during subsequent pregnan-
cies, which is completely normal. But keep in mind, suffering a pregnancy 
loss a second time is quite unlikely.

Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
Dealing with Fetal Abnormalities
All prospective parents wonder whether their baby will be “normal.” And, for 
most, the answer is yes. Still, 2 to 3 percent of babies end up having a signifi-
cant abnormality. Some of these abnormalities can be repaired and have very 
little impact on the baby’s overall quality of life. Occasionally, however, the 
condition can have a bigger impact, whether it is a structural, chromosomal, 
or genetic abnormality.
 
When an abnormality occurs, the first question many women ask us is, “Is 
this my fault?” And the answer, most often, is no. From what is known about 
fetal abnormalities, most are what are called sporadic, meaning they occur 
randomly and have no identifiable cause. If your doctor can’t identify a cause, 
chances are low that the same kind of abnormality will recur in a subsequent 
pregnancy. (If the cause is genetic, there may be some chance that the abnor-
mality could occur again.)
If your fetus is diagnosed with a birth defect or genetic disorder by ultra-
sound or some other test, your doctor may recommend you have additional 
tests to look for other factors that have been associated with that particular 
problem. He may recommend you see a genetic counselor to discuss the 
implications of the abnormality. If the condition is a structural defect that 
can be surgically repaired or treated, your doctor may recommend you meet 
with the specialist who can treat the baby after he is born. These discussions 
help you prepare for what lies ahead during the newborn period and also 
later on in your child’s life.
Nobody wants to get the news that they have a fetus with an abnormality, but 
having this information is helpful for several reasons:
 
✓ If you’re aware of some disorders, such as fetal anemia or obstructions 
in the urinary tract, doctors may be able to treat them.
 
✓ The knowledge helps to prepare you for what happens after the baby 
is born.
 
✓ This information helps you manage your pregnancy and consider all 
possible options.
 
✓ The information can give you important insights into the management of 
future pregnancies.

Finding Help
If your pregnancy didn’t turn out as you had hoped, the first and most obvi-
ous place to look for support is from your partner. Family members, friends, 
and clergy can also be very helpful. Professional advice or treatment from a 
psychotherapist or social worker may be useful for many couples. Support 
groups also can provide understanding and expert insight into your problem. 
If you have online access, you can find hundreds of support groups on the 
Internet. Dozens of helpful books are also available, including

Beginning to Heal
Couples naturally feel a strong emotional attachment to their unborn child, 
beginning as early as the first trimester. As a result, many couples experience 
the same grief after the loss of a fetus as they would after the loss of a family 
member or close friend. The loss of a fetus is no less significant than the loss 
of a child. Parents who decide to terminate a pregnancy because of an abnor-
mality also go through tremendous grief.
Both parents should acknowledge their need — and their right — to grieve 
after a pregnancy loss. The emotional response takes time and typically goes 
through a number of stages, beginning with shock and denial, progressing to 
anger, and eventually reaching acceptance and the ability to carry on with 
life. Understand that each of you will grieve in a different way.

346
Part IV: Dealing with Special Concerns 
After you have gone through the stages of grief and feel you’re physically 
and emotionally strong, you’re probably ready to start trying again. In some 
couples, one person progresses through the grieving process faster than the 
other. Make sure both of you are ready before you begin trying to get preg-
nant again. And remember that a successful pregnancy, while joyful, doesn’t 
replace a lost one — so the grieving process is necessary. From a medical 
perspective, make sure that you finish looking into possible causes for the 
loss and have a plan of action for the next pregnancy. Realize that your next 
pregnancy will be somewhat stressful and that you will need extra attention 
and compassion from your family, friends, and healthcare professionals.

D
on’t worry. We know of no conspiracy keeping you from knowing all 
there is to know about pregnancy. But your friends, sisters, cousins — 
whoever tells you what to expect with your pregnancy — often forget the little 
details, especially the more unpleasant ones. Furthermore, other books often 
gloss over this stuff, perhaps in the interest of decorum. Well, at the risk of 
being indecorous, we’re going to give it to you straight in this chapter.
Pregnancy Lasts Longer 
than Nine Months
Patients always ask, “How many months along am I?” and we have trouble 
giving them a precise answer. Pregnancy is said to last nine months, but that 
number isn’t exactly accurate. The average pregnancy lasts 280 days, or 40 
weeks, starting from the date of the mother’s last menstrual period. (You 
think 40 weeks is a long time? Just be glad you’re not an elephant, which has 
a gestation period of 22 months!) If a month is four weeks, that calculation 
comes out to ten months. On the calendar, however, most months contain 
four weeks plus two or three days, so nine calendar months often do contain 
close to 40 weeks. Practitioners speak in terms of weeks when measuring ges-
tational age because it’s more accurate and less confusing.

350
Part V: The Par t of Tens 
Other People Can Drive You Crazy
Friends, relatives, acquaintances, strangers, and even your partner give you 
unsolicited opinions and advice and want to share with you every pregnancy 
horror story they’ve ever heard. They may tell you your rear looks big, you’re 
too fat (or too thin), or you shouldn’t be eating whatever you’re putting in 
your mouth.
We realize these people usually have only good intentions when they tell you 
how their sister’s pregnancy ended badly, or about the trouble a friend of a 
friend had. They don’t realize that they’re increasing your anxiety. Don’t pay 
attention. Try to politely smile and ignore them. Tell them you really don’t 
want to hear this story right now. If you have any real problems or concerns, 
talk them over with your practitioner.
You Feel Exhausted in the First Trimester
You may already have heard that you’re going to feel tired during the first 
trimester, but until you go through it, you really have no idea how over-
whelming the fatigue can be. You may find yourself looking for every possible 
opportunity to catch a few winks — on the bus, on the train, at work, or even 
on the exam table waiting for your practitioner to come into the room. Rest 
assured this fatigue does go away, usually by the end of the first trimester (at 
about 13 weeks), and you do get your usual energy back. Look out, though. 
Around 30 to 34 weeks, the physical stress of pregnancy may overwhelm you 
again, and you may go back to feeling pretty washed out for several weeks. 
Frequent naps either in the first trimester or at any time are always a good 
idea if you’re feeling tired.
Round Ligament Pain Really Hurts
The round ligaments run from the top of the uterus down into the labia. As 
the uterus grows, these ligaments stretch, and many women feel discomfort 
or pain on one or both sides of the groin area, especially at about 16 to 22 
weeks. Practitioners tell you this symptom is only round ligament pain and 
it’s nothing to worry about. And they’re right — don’t worry. But you deserve 
some sympathy (you have ours) because this pain can be fairly intense.
You can probably ease round ligament pain a bit by getting off your feet or 
changing positions, thereby taking the pressure off the ligaments. By the way, 
if you’re having twins or more, the round ligament pain may begin earlier and 
last longer. The good news is that round ligament pain usually diminishes by 
about 24 weeks.

Your Belly Becomes a Hand Magnet
After your stomach protrudes noticeably with pregnancy, you’re likely to find 
suddenly everyone presumes touching it is okay — not only your friends, 
family members, and the people you work with, but also the mailman, the 
cashier at the supermarket, and other people you’ve never even met. Although 
some women appreciate the extra attention, many find it an invasion of pri-
vacy. You can either grin and bear it or discover how to say, “Hey, hands off!”
Hemorrhoids Are a Royal 
Pain in the Butt
Your best friend may say she’s told you everything about her own pregnancy. 
But has she remembered her hemorrhoids? Believe us, hemorrhoids happen 
pretty often, and when they do, you’re in for some very noticeable pain and 
discomfort. Hemorrhoids are dilated veins near the rectum that become 
engorged because of the pressure on that part of the body or because of 
pushing during delivery. Some women notice hemorrhoids during pregnancy, 
others don’t have any problem with them until after delivery, and some very 
lucky women never have them at all.
If your hemorrhoids are significant, be prepared for some discomfort after vag-
inal delivery (see Chapter 13). Most hemorrhoids go away within a few weeks. 
If you’re fortunate enough not to have them, realize how lucky you are — and 
have sympathy for all the other new mothers who do have them.
Sometimes Women Poop While Pushing
Our patients frequently ask us about having a bowel movement during labor, 
so although it may not be the most genteel subject to bring up, we’re going 
to anyway. Pooping while pushing doesn’t happen every time; however, it’s 
fairly common. In all likelihood, you and your partner aren’t even aware of 
it happening because your nurse quickly wipes away any mess and keeps 
you clean throughout the pushing process. If it does happen, don’t give it 
a thought. No one, including your doctor or your partner, is going to be 
grossed out.

Part V: The Par t of Tens 
The Weight Stays On after 
the Baby Comes Out
Most women can’t wait to weigh themselves after delivering 10 pounds or 
so of baby, placenta, and fluid. Contain yourself. Wait at least a week. After 
delivery, many women swell up like dumplings, especially their hands and 
feet. This extra water retention adds pounds. If you step on the scale right 
away, you may be very disappointed at the number that comes up. The 
swelling generally takes about a week or two to go away.
Hospital Pads are Relics 
from Your Mother’s Era
At some hospitals, the nurses offer you sanitary napkins from the 1920s — 
and a cute little elastic belt to hang them on. If you’re a time traveler or if 
for some other reason you prefer this kind, great. But if you want something 
a little more contemporary, bring your own box of large-size pads with side 
tabs (along with some fairly sturdy underwear — no thongs), or ask your 
practitioner what you can expect to find at the hospital.
Breast Engorgement Really Sucks and 
Breast-feeding Can Be a Production
Of course you know your breasts fill up with milk after you deliver your 
baby. But what you may not have heard is how painful and cumbersome this 
engorgement can be if you aren’t breast-feeding, or when you decide to stop 
breast-feeding. Your breasts may become rock hard, tender, and warm, and 
they sometimes seem to grow to the size of blimps. Fortunately, the discomfort 
is temporary; this intense period of engorgement lasts only a couple of days.
We encourage all of our patients to breast-feed due to the benefits for the 
baby, but keep in mind it may be harder than you think. Needing some extra 
help and assistance is very natural. Fortunately, most hospitals have lacta-
tion specialists that can help you milk the process along.

▶ Getting the extra calories you need in a healthy way
▶ Satisfying your hunger pangs
▶ Using healthy snacks to fulfill your nutritional needs
P
regnant women need extra nutrition, but not 
empty calories, to keep themselves healthy 
and make their babies grow. Most pregnant 
women find they’re hungry throughout the day, 
not just at meals. With the busy schedules women 
have today, finding snacks that are both healthy 
and satisfying is difficult. Here are some of our 
recommendations of high-nutrient snacks that are 
easy to make and yummy.

Ten Key Things You Can 
See on Ultrasound
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing what the sonographer sees
▶ Checking your baby’s health from ultrasound
▶ Determining whether you’re having a girl or a boy
I
f you’ve ever had a parent-to-be show you an ultrasound picture of the 
baby, you know determining what you’re looking at, let alone detecting a 
family resemblance, isn’t always easy! But ultrasound pictures can be amaz-
ingly clear and useful — if you know what you’re looking for. In this chapter, 
we show you what doctors and sonographers try to pick out on ultrasound to 
find out whether the baby is growing and developing well.
Measurement of Crown-Rump Length
The crown-rump length (CRL) is the distance from the top of the fetus’s head 
(crown) to the buttocks (rump) during the first trimester (see Figure 21-1). It’s the 
most precise sonographic measurement your practitioner can use to estimate 
gestational age. The other things that you can see in this image are a measure-
ment of the nuchal translucency (NT) and the nasal bone (NB). (See Chapter 8.)

rump length 
is a first-
trimester 
measure-
ment used 
to determine 
how far 
along your 
pregnancy 
is.
 
The Face
Many people think the view of the fetus in Figure 21-2, taken during the 
second trimester, is sort of ghoulish. Some say that the baby looks like ET. 
But keep in mind that it’s not a traditional photograph of the baby’s face. The 
ultrasound beam passes through the fetus wherever it’s directed and renders 
a picture of a “section” of the inside of the baby, not the surface.
 
Figure 21-2: 
Smile for the 
camera!
 

363
 Chapter 21: Ten Key Things You Can See on Ultrasound
The Spine
The spine is one area that even most novices at ultrasound can easily find. 
Take a look at it in Figure 21-3. In the second trimester, imaging the entire 
spine is important in order to rule out neural tube defects (see Chapter 8).
 
Figure 21-3: 
You can 
easily see 
the fetal 
spine on 
ultrasound

mester.
 
The Heart
The image in Figure 21-4 is the classic four-chamber view of the fetal heart 
that your practitioner looks for on ultrasound in the second trimester. You 
can clearly see two atria and two ventricles. A normal four-chamber view 
rules out the most major heart abnormalities. During an actual ultrasound, 
you can see the heart beating and the valves moving.

 In this 
picture, you 
can see the 
heart’s four 
chambers. 
During 
the actual 
exam, you 
can also see 
the heart 
beating.
 
The Hands
In the second trimester, counting fetal fingers and toes is a challenge because 
the fetus moves constantly. But Figure 21-5 captures them all in the picture.

All five 
fingers . . .

Although you can’t predict shoe size yet, you can see five toes on the foot in 
Figure 21-6, caught on ultrasound in the second trimester.

The Fetal Profile
In Figure 21-7, you can see a fetus in the second trimester taking a rest from 
her busy play schedule.

Three-Dimensional Image
In contrast to the other images in this chapter that are two-dimensional, this 
image is a different type of ultrasound that renders a picture of what the 
baby actually looks like. Figure 21-8 shows the baby’s face with the arm in 
front of part of the mouth. 3D ultrasound is one of the newest technologies 
available and provides amazing pictures, but hasn’t replaced traditional two-
dimensional scanning yet. 3D images have limited use for routine evaluation 
of the baby at present.
