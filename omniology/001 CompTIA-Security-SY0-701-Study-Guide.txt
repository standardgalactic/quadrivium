CompTIA Security+
(SY0-701) (Study Notes)
●
Kernel Mode
○
Allows a system to control access to things like device drivers, your
sound card, your video display or monitor, and other similar things
○
If you login as the administrator or root user on a system, you have root permission and
you will be operating at Ring 1 of the operating system
■
Remember, the closer the malicious code is to the kernel, the more permissions
it will have and the more damage it can cause on your system
○
When a rootkit is installed on a system, it tries to move from Ring 1 to Ring 0 so that it
can hide from other functions of the operating system to avoid detection
○
One technique used by rootkits to gain this deeper level of access is a DLL injection
■
DLL Injection
●
Technique used to run arbitrary code within the address space of another
process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library
■
Dynamic Link Library (DLL)
●
Collection of code and data that can be used by multiple programs
simultaneously to allow for code reuse and modularization in software
development
■
Shim
●
Piece of software code that is placed between two components and that
intercepts the calls between those components and can be used redirect
them
○
Rootkits are extremely powerful, and they are very difficult to detect because the
operating system is essentially blinded to them
■
To detect them, the best way is to boot from an external device and then scan
the internal hard drive to ensure that you can detect those rootkits using a good
anti-malware scanning solution from a live boot Linux distribution

●
The attacker identifies an input validation vulnerability within a trusted
website
221
https://www.DionTraining.com

CompTIA Security+
(SY0-701) (Study Notes)
●
The attacker crafts a URL to perform a code injection against the trusted
website
●
The trusted site will return a page containing the malicious code injected
●
The malicious code runs in the client’s browser with permission level as
the trusted site
■
Functions of a XSS Attack
●
Defacing the trusted website
●
Stealing the user’s data
●
Intercepting data or communications
■
Types of XSS Attacks
●
Non-Persistent XSS
○
A XSS attack that only occurs when it is launched and only
happens once
○
Server executes the attack (Server-side scripting attack)
●
Persistent XSS
○
Allows an attacker to insert code into a backend database used by
that trusted website
○
Server executes the attack (Server-side scripting attack)
●
Document Object Model (DOM) XSS
○

CompTIA Security+
(SY0-701) (Study Notes)
actions and requests
■
Fundamental security component in modern web applications
■
Cookie Tracking
●
Cookie
○
Text file used to store information about a user when they visit a
website
○
Non-persistent cookies
■
Also known as a session cookie
■
Resides in memory and are used for a very short time
period
■
Deleted at the end of the session
○
Persistent cookies
■
Stored in the browser cache until either deleted by a user
or expire
■
Session Hijacking

tries to reset their password
○
Require two-factor authentication
●
Require users to enter their current password when changing their
password
●
Buffer Overflow
○
Buffer Overflow Attack
■
Occurs when a process stores data outside the memory range allocated by the
developer
■
Common initial attack vector in data breaches
●
85% of data breaches used buffer overflow as the initial vector
■
Attackers exploit the excess data written beyond buffer boundaries to
manipulate program execution
○
Buffers
■
Temporary storage areas used by programs to hold data
■
They have a defined memory capacity, just like a glass holding a limited amount
of water
■
Overflowing a buffer results in data spilling into adjacent memory locations,
causing unintended consequences
224
https://www.DionTraining.com

CompTIA Security+
(SY0-701) (Study Notes)
○
Technical Aspects
■
Stack
●
Programs have a reserved memory area called a stack to store data during
processing
■
The stack uses a "first in, last out" organization
■
Stack contains return addresses when a function call instruction is received
■
Attackers aim to overwrite the return address with their malicious code's address
○
Smashing the Stack
■
Attackers aim to overwrite the return address with a pointer to their malicious
code
■
When the non-malicious program hits the modified return address, it runs the
attacker's code
■
This gives attackers a command prompt on the victim's system for remote code
execution
○
NOP Slide
■
Attackers fill the buffer with NOP (No-Operation) instructions
■
The return address slides down the NOP instructions until it reaches the
attacker's code
○
Mitigations against Buffer Overflow Attack
■
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
●
Helps prevent attackers from guessing return pointer addresses
●
Randomizes memory addresses used by well-known programs, making it
harder to predict the location of the attacker's code

CompTIA Security+
(SY0-701) (Study Notes)
used
●
For example, overdrawing a bank account due to a time delay between
checking and transferring funds
■
Time-of-Use (TOU)
●
Attackers alter a resource's state after it is checked but before it is used
●
Focuses on the time when the resource is utilized, rather than the time of
the initial check
■
Time-of-Evaluation (TOE)
●
Attackers manipulate data or resources during the system's
decision-making or evaluation process
●
Can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior
○
Mitigating Race Conditions
■
Use locks and mutexes to synchronize access to shared resources
●
Mutex
○
Mutually exclusive flag that acts as a gatekeeper to a section of
code so that only one thread can be processed at a time
○
Mutexes ensure only one thread or process can access a specific
section of code at a time
■
Properly design and test locks to prevent deadlocks
■
Deadlock
●
Occurs when a lock remains in place because the process it’s waiting for is
terminated, crashes, or doesn’t finish properly, despite the processing
being complete

Top five tips for increasing your score on the exam
■
Use a cheat sheet
●
You're not allowed to actually carry anything into the exam with you, but
if you're at a local testing center, they will give you a whiteboard or a dry
erase sheet that's about the size of a normal piece of paper
●
Once the clock starts on the exam, you can brain-dump anything you
want onto that paper
●
Use the sheet and spend the first 1-2 minutes writing down those
important things you may forget later on
■
Skip any questions that are giving you trouble
●
If you find yourself struggling with a really hard question, just mark it for
review and skip it
●
Students who do this end up increasing their score by at least 5% to 10%
over their peers who try to do the simulations at the beginning of their
exam
■
Take a guess
●
If you're in doubt, take a guess from the possible answer choices
349
https://www.DionTraining.com

CompTIA Security+
(SY0-701) (Study Notes)
●
There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly on the exam
●
If you are in doubt of the right answer, try to eliminate as many choices as
possible and guess between the remaining answer options
■
Pick the best time for your exam
●
Pick the time of day that works best for you
●
Don’t try to squeeze the exam in after working a long day at the office
■
Be confident
●
You’ve got this!
●
You should already know you're going to pass!
●
You should have already studied all the information in this course, you've
watched the videos, you've taken the quizzes, you've studied your
downloadable study notes
●
If you're not confident right now, then wait a few days to schedule your
exam
●
Take a bunch of practice exams and build up your confidence
○
When you take a practice exam, your goal is not to memorize the answer key
■
You need to understand why the right answer was right and the wrong answers
are wrong
○
Good luck, and we hope to see you again in a future course as you continue upwards in
your cybersecurity career and continue to climb the CompTIA certification ladder into
CySA+, PenTest+ and CASP+!
