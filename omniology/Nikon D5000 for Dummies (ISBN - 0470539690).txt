Nikon D5000 For Dummies 

Introduction
N
ikon. The name has been associated with top-flight photography 
equipment for generations. And the introduction of the D5000 has only 
enriched Nikon’s well-deserved reputation, offering all the control a die-hard 
photography enthusiast could want while at the same time providing easy-to-
use, point-and-shoot features for the beginner.
In fact, the D5000 offers so many features that sorting them all out can be 
more than a little confusing, especially if you’re new to digital photography, 
SLR photography, or both. For starters, you may not even be sure what SLR 
means or how it affects your picture taking, let alone have a clue as to all the 
other techie terms you encounter in your camera manual — resolution, 
aperture, white balance, and so on. And if you’re like many people, you may 
be so overwhelmed by all the controls on your camera that you haven’t yet 
ventured beyond fully automatic picture-taking mode. Which is a shame 
because it’s sort of like buying a Porsche 911 and never driving it on a 
winding road.
Therein lies the point of Nikon D5000 For Dummies: Through this book, you 
can discover not just what each bell and whistle on your camera does, but 
also when, where, why, and how to put it to best use. Unlike many photogra-
phy books, this one doesn’t require any previous knowledge of photography 
or digital imaging to make sense of things, either. In classic For Dummies 
style, everything is explained in easy-to-understand language, with lots of 
illustrations to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth 
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Nikon picture-taking 
powerhouse.
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of 
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to 
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make 
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics 
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find 
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.

2
Nikon D5000 For Dummies 
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running with your 
D5000:
 
✓ Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external 
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to 
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and 
customization steps.
 
✓ Chapter 2, “Taking Great Pictures, Automatically,” shows you how to 
get the best results when using the camera’s fully automatic exposure 
modes, including the Digital Vari-Program scene modes such as Sports 
mode, Portrait mode, and Landscape mode.
 
✓ Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality and Size,” introduces you to 
two camera settings that are critical whether you shoot in automatic or 
manual mode: the Image Size and Image Quality settings, which control 
resolution (pixel count), file format, file size, and picture quality.
 
✓ Chapter 4, “Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting” 
offers just what its title implies. Look here to find out how to use the 
D5000’s cool, swiveling monitor to review your photos, compose photos 
in Live View mode, and record short movies. This chapter also dis-
cusses how to delete unwanted images and protect your favorites from 
accidental erasure. 
Part II: Taking Creative Control
Chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your D5000 
by moving into semiautomatic or manual photography modes.
 
✓ Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the 
all-important topic of exposure, starting with an explanation of three 
critical exposure controls: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. This chap-
ter also discusses your camera’s advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, 
and M); explains exposure options such as Active D-Lighting, automatic 
exposure bracketing, metering modes, and exposure compensation; and 
offers tips for using the built-in flash.
 
✓ Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with control-
ling those aspects of your pictures. Head here for information about 
your camera’s many autofocusing options, for tips on how to manipulate 
depth of field (the zone of sharp focus in a picture), and for details about 
color controls such as white balance.
 
✓ Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques 
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the 
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results 
for specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes, 
close-ups, and more.

3
 Introduction
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect 
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 
✓ Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files,” 
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your 
camera memory card to your computer’s hard drive or other storage 
device. Look here, too, for details about using the D5000’s built-in tool 
for processing files that you shoot in the Nikon RAW format (NEF). Just 
as important, this chapter explains how to organize and safeguard your 
photo files. 
 
✓ Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Pictures,” helps you turn your 
digital files into “hard copies” that look as good as those you see on 
the camera monitor. This chapter also explains how to prepare your 
pictures for online sharing, create digital slide shows and stop-motion 
movies, and, for times when you have the neighbors over, display your 
pictures and movies on a television screen.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists 
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 
✓ Chapter 10, “Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features,” 
shows you how to fix less-than-perfect images using features found on 
your camera’s Retouch menu, such as automated red-eye removal. You 
also find out how to apply color effects and perform a few other photo-
enhancement tricks.
 
✓ Chapter 11, “Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,” 
presents information about some camera features that, while not found 
on most “Top Ten Reasons I Bought My D5000” lists, are nonetheless 
interesting, useful on occasion, or a bit of both.
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large, 
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
 
A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or some 
other valuable resource, including your sanity.

4
Nikon D5000 For Dummies 
 
When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone that 
can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored. I’ve already found 
this, so you won’t have to.
 
Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital photography 
is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail that is useful mainly for 
impressing your technology-geek friends, I mark it with this icon.
 
I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially worth stor-
ing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a fact that may 
have been displaced from that memory by some other pressing fact.
Additionally, I need to point out three additional details that will help you use 
this book:
 
✓ Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons also 
appear in the margins of some paragraphs. I include these to provide a 
quick reminder of the appearance of the button being discussed. 
 
✓ Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series 
of words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose 
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose 
File➪Convert Files,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the 
Convert Files command on the menu.
 
✓ Camera firmware: Firmware is the internal software that controls many 
of your camera’s operations. The D5000 firmware consists of three parts, 
called A, B, and L. At the time this book was written, A and B were ver-
sion 1.00, and L was version 1.001.
 
 Occasionally, Nikon releases firmware updates, and it’s a good idea 
to check out the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) periodically to find 
out whether any updates are available. (Chapter 1 tells you how to 
determine which firmware version your camera is running.) Firmware 
updates typically don’t carry major feature changes — they’re mostly 
used to solve technical glitches in existing features — but if you do 
download an update, be sure to read the accompanying description 
of what it accomplishes so that you can adapt my instructions as 
necessary.

 Introduction
About the Software Shown in This Book
Providing specific instructions for performing photo organizing and editing 
tasks requires that I feature specific software. In sections that cover file 
downloading, archiving, printing, and e-mail sharing, I selected Nikon 
ViewNX and Nikon Transfer, both of which ship free with your camera and 
work on both the Windows and Mac operating systems.
Rest assured, though, that the tools used in ViewNX and Nikon Transfer work 
very similarly in other programs, so you should be able to easily adapt the 
steps to whatever software you use. (I recommend that you read your soft-
ware manual for details. And of course, there are For Dummies books on all 
the major image editing applications, and you can use them if you find the 
manual a tad — ahem — boring.)
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that 
digital photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very 
good company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take 
it slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to 
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire. 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really 
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time, 
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the 
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it 
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book. 
Your D5000 is the perfect partner for your photographic journey, and I thank 
you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour guide.

aking sense of all the controls on your 
D5000 isn’t something you can do in an 
afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe even a 
month. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t take 
great pictures today. By using your camera’s auto-
matic point-and-shoot modes, you can capture ter-
riﬁ c images with very little effort. All you do is 
compose the scene, and the camera takes care of 
almost everything else.
This part shows you how to take best advantage 
of your camera’s automatic features and also 
addresses some basic setup steps, such as adjust-
ing the viewﬁ nder to your eyesight and getting 
familiar with the camera menus, buttons, and dials. 
In addition, chapters in this part explain how to 
obtain the very best picture quality, whether you 
shoot in an automatic or manual mode, and how 
to use your camera’s picture-playback, Live View, 
and movie recording features.

I
still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was 
excited to finally move up from my one-button point-and-shoot 
camera, but I was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy 
sported several unfamiliar buttons and dials, and the expla-
nations in the camera manual clearly were written for 
someone with an engineering degree. And then there 
was the whole business of attaching the lens to the 
camera, an entirely new task for me. I saved up my 
pennies a long time for that camera — what if my 
inexperience caused me to damage the thing before 
I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Nikon 
D5000 is your first SLR, although some of the but-
tons on the camera back may look familiar if you’ve 
previously used a digital point-and-shoot camera. 
If your D5000 is both your first SLR and first digital 
camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as complicated as 
its exterior makes it appear. With a little practice and the help of this chap-
ter, which introduces you to each external control, you’ll quickly become as 
comfortable with your camera’s buttons and dials as you are with the ones

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
on your car’s dashboard. This chapter also guides you through the process 
of mounting and using an SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, navi-
gating your camera’s menus, and customizing basic camera operations.
Getting Comfortable with Your Lens
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR 
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses 
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens 
(also known as a macro lens) to a wide-angle lens, which encompasses a wide 
field of view, to a super-long telephoto, which lets you photograph a distant 
subject without getting too close. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable 
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying 
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism.
Of course, those added capabilities mean that you need a little background 
information to take full advantage of your lens. To that end, the next four sec-
tions explain the process of attaching, removing, and using this critical part 
of your camera.
Attaching a lens
 
Your camera can autofocus only with a type of lens that carries the specifica-
tion AF-S. (Well, technically speaking, the camera can also autofocus with AF-I 
lenses. But since those are high-end, very expensive lenses that are no longer 
made, this is the only mention you’ll find of AF-I lenses in this book.) You can 
use other types of lenses, as long as they’re compatible with the camera’s 
lens mount, but you’ll have to focus manually.
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
 
1. Turn the camera off and remove the cap that covers the lens mount on 
the front of the camera.
 
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
 
3. Hold the lens in front of the camera so that the little white dot on the 
lens aligns with the matching dot on the camera body.
 
 Official photography lingo uses the term mounting index instead of little 
white dot. Either way, you can see the markings in question in Figure 1-1.
 
 Note that the figure (and others in this chapter) shows you the D5000 
with its so-called “kit lens” — the 18–55mm Vibration Reduction (VR) 
zoom lens that Nikon sells as a unit with the body. If you buy a lens from 
a manufacturer other than Nikon, your dot may be red or some other 
color, so check the lens instruction manual.

11
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
4. Keeping the dots aligned, 
position the lens on the cam-
era’s lens mount as shown in 
Figure 1-1.
 
 When you do so, grip the lens 
by its back collar, not the mov-
able, forward end of the lens 
barrel.
 
5. Turn the lens in a counter-
clockwise direction until the 
lens clicks into place.
 
 To put it another way, turn 
the lens toward the side of the 
camera that sports the shutter 
button, as indicated by the red 
arrow in the figure. 
 
6. On a lens that has an aperture 
ring, set and lock the ring so 
the aperture is set at the high-
est f-stop number.
 
 Check your lens manual to find 
out whether your lens sports an 
aperture ring and how to adjust 
it. (The D5000 kit lens doesn’t.) 
To find out more about apertures 
and f-stops, see Chapter 5.
 
Even though the D5000 is equipped with a dust reduction system, you should 
always attach (or switch) lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk 
of getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens. 
Changing lenses on a sandy beach, for example, isn’t a good idea. For added 
safety, point the camera body slightly down when performing this maneuver; 
doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from being drawn into the 
camera by gravity.
Removing a lens
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
 
1. Turn off the camera and locate the lens-release button, labeled in 
Figure 1-2.
 
2. Grip the rear collar of the lens.
 
 In other words, hold on to the stationary part of the lens that’s closest 
to the camera body and not the movable focusing ring or zoom ring, if 
your lens has one.
Mounting index dots
Figure 1-1: When attaching the lens, align the 
index markers as shown here.

12
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
3. Press the lens-release button 
while turning the lens clock-
wise until the mounting index 
on the lens is aligned with the 
index on the camera body.
 
 The mounting indexes are 
the little guide dots labeled in 
Figure 1-1. When the dots line 
up, the lens should detach from 
the mount. 
 
4. Place the rear protective cap 
onto the back of the lens.
 
 If you aren’t putting another 
lens on the camera, cover the 
lens mount with the protec-
tive cap that came with your 
camera, too.
Using a VR (vibration 
reduction) lens
If you purchased the D5000 camera 
kit — that is, the body-and-lens 
combination put together by Nikon — your lens offers a feature called vibra-
tion reduction. On Nikon lenses, this feature is indicated by the initials VR in 
the lens name.
Vibration reduction attempts to compensate for small amounts of camera 
shake that are common when photographers handhold their cameras and 
use a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. That 
camera movement during the exposure can produce blurry images. Although 
vibration reduction can’t work miracles, it does enable most people to cap-
ture sharper handheld shots in many situations than they otherwise could.
 
However, when you use a tripod, vibration reduction can have detrimental 
effects because the system may try to adjust for movement that isn’t actually 
occurring. That’s why your kit lens — and all Nikon VR lenses — have an On/
Off switch, which is located on the side of the lens, as shown in Figure 1-2. 
Whether you should turn off the VR feature, though, depends on the specific 
lens, so check the manual. For the 18–55mm kit lens, Nikon does recommend 
setting the switch to the Off position for tripod shooting, assuming that the 
tripod is “locked down” so the camera is immovable.

Figure 1-2: Press the lens-release button to 
disengage the lens from the mount.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
If you use a non-Nikon lens, the vibration reduction feature may go by 
another name: image stabilization, optical stabilization, anti-shake, vibration 
compensation, and so on. In some cases, the manufacturers may recommend 
that you leave the system turned on or select a special setting when you use 
a tripod, so be sure to check the lens manual for information.
Chapter 6 offers more tips on achieving blur-free photos, and it also explains 
focal length and its impact on your pictures. See Chapter 5 for an explanation 
of shutter speed.
Setting the focus mode (auto or manual)
Again, the option to switch between autofocusing and manual focusing 
depends on matching the D5000 with a fully compatible lens, as I explain in 
the earlier section, “Attaching a Lens.” With the kit lens, as well as with other 
AF-S lenses, you can enjoy autofocusing as well as manual focusing. 
 
The AF stands for autofocus, as you may have guessed. The S stands for silent 
wave, a Nikon autofocus technology.
For times when you attach a lens that doesn’t support autofocusing or the 
autofocus system has trouble locking on your subject, you can focus manu-
ally by simply twisting a focusing ring on the lens barrel. The placement and 
appearance of the focusing ring depend on the lens; Figure 1-3 shows you the 
one on the kit lens.
 
To focus manually with the kit lens, take these steps:
 
1. Set the lens to manual focus mode.
 
 Look for the switch labeled in Figure 1-3, and move it from the A to the M 
position, as shown in the figure. 
 
2. While looking through the viewfinder, twist the focusing ring to adjust 
focus.
 
 If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every 
lens has a minimum focusing distance. You may also need to adjust the 
viewfinder to accommodate your eyesight; you can get help with the 
process a few paragraphs from here.
If you use a lens other than the kit lens, check the lens instruction guide for 
details about focusing manually; your lens may or may not have a switch 
similar to the one on the kit lens. Also see the Chapter 6 section related to 
the Focus mode option, which should be set to MF for manual focusing. (The 
camera may automatically choose the setting for you, depending on the lens.)

Zooming in and out
If you bought a zoom lens, it has a movable zoom barrel. The location of the 
zoom barrel on the D5000 kit lens is shown in Figure 1-3. To zoom in or out, 
just rotate that zoom barrel clockwise or counterclockwise.
 
Focusing ring
Zoom barrel
Auto/Manual focus switch
 
Figure 1-3: On the 18–55mm kit lens, the manual-focusing ring is set near the front 
 
of the lens, as shown here.
The numbers on the zoom ring, by the way, represent focal lengths. I explain 
focal lengths in Chapter 6. In the meantime, just note that when the lens is 
mounted on the camera, the number that’s aligned with the lens mounting 
index (the white dot) represents the current focal length. In Figure 1-3, for 
example, the focal length is 18mm.
Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Tucked behind the right side of the rubber eyepiece that surrounds the view-
finder is a tiny slider called a diopter adjustment control. With this control, 
labeled in Figure 1-4, you can adjust the focus of your viewfinder to accom-
modate your eyesight.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out of focus through the view-
finder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and vice versa. 
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
 
Diopter adjustment control
Focus point
 
Figure 1-4: Use the diopter adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.
 
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
 
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the little black mark-
ings shown on the right in Figure 1-4.
 
 The little rectangles represent the camera’s autofocusing points, which 
you can read more about in Chapters 2 and 6. The four curved lines rep-
resent the center-weighted metering area, which relates to an exposure 
option you can explore in Chapter 5.
 
3. Push the diopter adjustment slider up or down until the viewfinder 
markings appear to be in focus.
 
 The Nikon manual warns you not to poke yourself in the eye as you per-
form this maneuver. This warning seems so obvious that I laugh every 
time I read it — which makes me feel doubly stupid the next time I poke 
myself in the eye as I perform this maneuver.
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on memory 
cards. Your D5000 uses a specific type of memory card called an SD card (for 
Secure Digital), shown in Figures 1-5 and 1-6. You can also use the new, high-
capacity Secure Digital cards, which are labeled SDHC, as well as Eye-Fi SD 
cards, which enable you to send pictures to your computer over a wireless 
network. (Because of space limitations, I don’t cover Eye-Fi connectivity in 
this book; if you want more information about these cards, you can find it 
online at www.eye.fi.)

16
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Safeguarding your memory cards — and the images you store on them — 
requires just a few precautions:
 
✓ Inserting a card: First, be sure that the camera is turned off. Then put 
the card in the card slot with the label facing the back of the camera, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Push the card 
into the slot until it clicks into 
place; the memory card access 
light (circled in Figure 1-5) blinks 
for a second to let you know the 
card is inserted properly.
 
✓ Formatting a card: The first time 
you use a new memory card or 
insert a card that has been used 
in other devices (such as an MP3 
player), you should format it. 
Formatting ensures that the card 
is properly prepared to record 
your pictures.
 
 Formatting erases everything on 
your memory card. So before for-
matting, be sure that you have 
copied any pictures or other data 
to your computer.
 
 To format a memory card, choose 
the Format Memory Card command from the Setup menu. The upcom-
ing section “Ordering from Camera Menus” explains how to work with 
menus. When you select the command, you’re informed that all images 
will be deleted, and you’re asked to confirm your decision to format the 
card. Highlight Yes and press the OK button to go forward.
 
 If you insert a memory card and see the letters For in the viewfinder, you 
must format the card before you can do anything else. You also see a 
message requesting formatting in the Shooting Information display. 
 
✓ Removing a card: After making sure that the memory card access light 
is off, indicating that the camera has finished recording your most 
recent photo, turn the camera off. Open the memory card door, as 
shown in Figure 1-5. Depress the memory card slightly until you hear a 
little click and then let go. The card should pop halfway out of the slot, 
enabling you to grab it by the tail and remove it.
Memory card access light
Figure 1-5: Insert the card with the label 
facing the camera back.

17
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 If you turn on the camera when 
no card is installed, the symbol 
[-E-] appears in the Shots 
Remaining area of the view-
finder (lower-right corner), and 
you also see a little symbol 
that looks like an SD card on 
the left side of the viewfinder 
screen. (That card symbol 
appears whether or not the 
camera is turned on.) If the 
Shooting Information screen is 
displayed on the monitor, that 
screen also nudges you to 
insert a memory card. If you do 
have a card in the camera and 
you get these messages, try 
taking it out and reinserting it.
 
 Some computer programs 
enable you to format cards as 
well, but it’s not a good idea to go that route. Your camera is better 
equipped to optimally format cards. 
 
✓ Handling cards: Don’t touch the gold contacts on the back of the card. 
(See the left card in Figure 1-6.) When cards aren’t in use, store them 
in the protective cases they came in or in a memory card wallet. Keep 
cards away from extreme heat and cold as well.
 
✓ Locking cards: The tiny switch on the left side of the card, labeled lock 
switch in Figure 1-6, enables you to lock your card, which prevents any 
data from being erased or recorded to the card. Press the switch toward 
the bottom of the card to lock the card contents; press it toward the top 
of the card to unlock the data.
 
 You can protect individual images from accidental erasure by using the 
camera’s Protect feature, which is covered in Chapter 4.
 
One side note on the issue of memory cards and file storage: Given that 
memory cards are getting cheaper and larger in capacity, you may be 
tempted to pick up an 8GB (gigabyte) or 16GB card thinking you can store a 
gazillion images on one card and not worry about running out of room. But 
memory cards are mechanical devices that are subject to failure, and if a 
large card fails, you lose lots of images. So I carry several 4GB SD cards in my 
camera bag. Although I hate to lose any images, I’d rather lose 4GB worth of 
images than 8 or 16GB.

Paws off!

the card.

Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are buttons, dials, and switches that 
you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your photos, and 
perform various other operations. In later chapters, I discuss all your cam-
era’s functions in detail and provide the exact steps to follow to access them. 
This section provides just a basic road map to the external controls plus a 
quick introduction to each.
 
One note before you move on: Many of the buttons perform multiple 
functions and so have multiple “official” names. The AE-L/AF-L button, for 
example, is also known as the Protect button. In the camera manual, Nikon’s 
instructions refer to these multi-tasking buttons by the name that’s relevant 
for the current function. I think that’s a little confusing, so I always refer to 
each button by the first moniker you see in the lists here.
Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins with the bird’s-eye view shown in Figure 1-7. There 
are a number of controls of note here:
Do you need high-speed memory cards?
Memory cards are categorized not just by their 
storage capacity, but also by their data-transfer 
speed. SD cards (the type used by your D5000) 
fall into one of three speed classes, Class 2, 
Class 4, and Class 6, with the number indicat-
ing the minimum number of megabytes (units 
of computer data) that can be transferred per 
second. A Class 2 card, for example, has a mini-
mum transfer speed of 2 megabytes, or MB, 
per second. Of course, with the speed increase 
comes a price increase. 
Photographers who shoot action benefit most 
from high-speed cards — the faster data-
transfer rate helps the camera record shots 
at its maximum speed. Users who shoot at the 
highest resolution or prefer the NEF (Raw) file 
format also gain from high-speed cards; both 
options increase file size and, thus, the time 
needed to store the picture on the card. (See 
Chapter 3 for details.) Finally, you sometimes 
enjoy better movie-recording performance 
when using higher speed cards. As for pic-
ture downloading, how long it takes for files to 
shuffle from card to computer depends not just 
on card speed, but also on the capabilities of 
your computer and, if you use a memory card 
reader to download files, on the speed of that 
device. (Chapter 8 covers the file-downloading 
process.)
Long story short, if you want to push your camera 
to its performance limits, a high-speed card is 
worth considering, assuming budget is no issue. 
Otherwise, even a Class 2 card should be more 
than adequate for most photographers.

✓ Exposure Compensation button: This button activates a feature that 
enables you to tweak exposure when working in three of your camera’s 
autoexposure modes: programmed autoexposure, aperture-priority 
autoexposure, and shutter-priority autoexposure, represented by the 
letters P, S, and A on the camera Mode dial. Chapter 5 explains. In 
manual exposure (M) mode, you press this button while rotating the 
Command dial to adjust the aperture setting.
 
 
✓ Info button: You press this button to display the Shooting Information 
screen on the camera monitor. The screen not only enables you to easily 
view the current picture-taking settings but also is the pathway to the 
Quick Settings screen, through which you can adjust some settings more 
quickly than by using the camera menus. See the upcoming section 
“Monitoring Shooting Settings” for details. To turn the screen off, press 
the Info button again.

 See the little green dots above this button and the Information Edit 
button (bottom-left button on the camera back)? The dots are reminders 
that pressing these two buttons simultaneously for more than two sec-
onds restores the most critical picture-taking options to their default 
settings. See “Restoring default settings,” at the end of this chapter, for 
more on this topic.
 
✓ Mode dial: With this dial, labeled in Figure 1-7, you set the camera to 
fully automatic, semi-automatic, or manual photography mode. The little 
pictographs, or icons, represent the Nikon Digital Vari-Program modes, 
which are automatic settings geared to specific types of photos: action 
shots, portraits, landscapes, and so on. Chapter 2 details the Digital 
Vari-Program and Auto modes; Chapter 5 explains the four others (P, S, 
A, and M).
Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, shown in Figure 1-8, you 
encounter the following controls:

✓ Command dial: After you activate certain camera features, you rotate 
this dial, labeled in Figure 1-8, to select a specific setting. For example, 
to choose an f-stop when shooting in aperture-priority (A) mode, you 
rotate the Command dial. And in manual exposure (M) mode, you 
change the f-stop by rotating the dial while pressing the Exposure 
Compensation button, as explained in the preceding section. (Chapter 5 
explains apertures and f-stops.)
 
 
✓ AE-L/AF-L/Protect button: Pressing this button initiates autoexposure 
lock (AE-L) and autofocus lock (AF-L). Chapter 5 explains autoexposure 
lock; Chapter 6 talks about autofocus lock.
 
 In playback mode, pressing the button locks the picture file — hence the 
little key symbol that appears to the left of the button — so that it isn’t 
erased if you use the picture-delete functions. See Chapter 4 for details. 
(The picture is erased if you format the memory card, however.) 
 
 You can adjust the performance of the button as it relates to locking 
focus and exposure, too. Instructions in this book assume that you stick 
with the default setting, but if you want to explore your options, see 
Chapter 11.
 
✓ Monitor Release tabs: You use these tabs to release the monitor from 
its locked position. More about the monitor in Chapter 4.
 
 
✓ Lv (Live View) button: You press this button as the first step in record-
ing a movie or taking advantage of Live View shooting, in which you can 
use the monitor to compose your shots. Chapter 4 introduces you to 
both Live View features.
 
✓ Multi Selector/OK button: This dual-natured control, labeled in Figure 
1-8, plays a role in many camera functions. You press the outer edges 
of the Multi Selector left, right, up, or down to navigate camera menus 
and access certain other options. At the center of the control is the OK 
button, which you press to finalize a menu selection or other camera 
adjustment. See the next section for help with using the camera menus.
 
 
✓ Delete button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for 
delete, this button enables you to erase pictures from your memory 
card. Chapter 4 has specifics.
 
 
✓ Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture 
review mode. Chapter 4 details the features available to you in this 
mode.

✓ Zoom Out/Thumbnail/Help button: This button has a number of 
functions, but the ones you’ll use most often are
 
 
• Display help screens. You can press this button to display helpful 
information about certain menu options. See “Asking Your Camera 
for Help,” later in this chapter, for details.
 
• Adjust the image display during playback. In playback mode, press-
ing the button enables you display multiple image thumbnails on 
the screen and reduce the magnification of the currently displayed 
photo. See Chapter 4 for a complete rundown of picture playback 
options.
 
 
✓ Zoom In button: In playback mode, pressing this button magnifies the 
currently displayed image and also reduces the number of thumbnails 
displayed at a time. Note the plus sign in the middle of the magnifying 
glass — plus for zoom in. Like the Zoom Out button, this one also serves 
a few minor roles that I explain in later chapters.
 
 
✓ Information Edit button: In picture-taking mode, use this button to shift 
from the Shooting Information display to the Quick Settings display, 
where you can change critical picture taking options.
 
This chapter is the only time you’ll see the monitor in its locked position. 
When you aren’t using the camera, it’s a good idea to return it to this position 
to prevent damage to the monitor. Chapter 4 offers a quick refresher on how 
to adjust the monitor position.
Front-left buttons
On the front-left side of the camera body, shown in Figure 1-9, you find the 
following controls:
 
 
✓ Flash/Flash compensation: Pressing this button pops up the camera’s 
built-in flash (except in automatic shooting modes, in which the camera 
decides whether the flash is needed). By holding the button down and 
rotating the Command dial, you can adjust the flash mode (normal, 
red-eye reduction, and so on). In advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and 
M), you also can adjust the flash power by pressing the button, while 
simultaneously pressing the Exposure Compensation button and rotat-
ing the Command dial. See Chapter 5 for all things flash related.
 
 
✓ Function (Fn) button: By default, this button changes the current 
Release mode to the Self Timer setting. But if you don’t use that feature 
often, you can use the button to perform one of seven other operations. 
Chapter 11 provides the details on changing the button’s purpose. 
(Note: All instructions in this book assume that you haven’t changed the 
function, however.)

✓ Lens switches: As detailed in 
the first part of this chapter, 
you use the A/M switch to set 
the kit lens to automatic or 
manual focusing. The VR Switch 
turns the Vibration Reduction 
feature on and off.
Make note, too, of the tiny micro-
phone perched just above the D5000 
label. Be careful not to obscure the 
microphone with your finger when 
you’re recording a movie, a subject 
you can explore in Chapter 4.
Front-right controls
Wrapping up the list of external controls, the front-right side of the camera is 
really quite sparse. There’s only one item there, as shown in Figure 1-10. 
AF-assist lamp
Figure 1-10: The AF-assist lamp is a lonely 
animal.

24
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
In dim lighting, a beam of light shoots out from the AF-assist lamp to help the 
camera’s autofocus system find its target. In general, leaving the AF-sssist 
option enabled is a good idea, but if you’re doing a lot of shooting at a party, 
wedding, or some event where the light from the lamp may be distracting, 
you can disable it through an option on the Custom Setting menu. Chapter 6 
explains this and other autofocus features.

 You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, 
conveniently enough, appear when you press the Menu button. Features 
are grouped into six main menus, described briefly in Table 1-1.

Your 20 most-recently-used menu options or 
your custom-designed menu
After you press the Menu button, you see on the camera monitor a screen 
similar to the one shown in Figure 1-11. Along the left side of the screen, 
you see the icons shown in Table 1-1, each representing one of the available 
menus. The icon that is highlighted or appears in color is the active menu; 
options on that menu automatically appear to the right of the column of 
icons. In the figure, the Shooting menu is active, for example.
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, 
just familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting 
options therein. The Multi Selector, shown in Figure 1-8, is the key to the 

25
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
game. You press the edges of the 
Multi Selector to navigate up, 
down, left, and right through the 
menus.
 
In this book, the instruction 
“Press the Multi Selector left” 
simply means to press the left 
edge of the control. “Press the 
Multi Selector right” means to 
press the right edge, and so on.
Here’s a bit more detail about 
the process of navigating menus:
 
✓ To select a different menu: 
Press the Multi Selector left to 
jump to the column containing the menu icons. Then press up or down 
to highlight the menu you want to display. Finally, press right to jump 
over to the options on the menu. 
 
✓ To select and adjust a function on the current menu: Again, use the 
Multi Selector to scroll up or down the list of options to highlight the 
feature you want to adjust and then press OK. Settings available for the 
selected item then appear. For example, if you select the Image Quality 
item from the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in Figure 1-12, and 
press OK, the available Image Quality options appear, as shown on the 
right in the figure. Repeat the old up-and-down scroll routine until the 
choice you prefer is highlighted. Then press OK to return to the previous 
screen.
 
 
Figure 1-12: Select the option you prefer and press OK again to return to the active menu.

 In some cases, you may see a 
right-pointing arrowhead instead 
of the OK symbol next to an 
option. That’s your cue to press 
the Multi Selector right to dis-
play a submenu or other list of 
options (although, most of the 
time, you also can just press the 
OK button if you prefer).
 
✓ To quickly access your 20 most 
recent menu items or create a 
custom menu: The sixth menu is 
actually two menus bundled into 
one. The Recent Settings menu, 
shown in Figure 1-13, provides 
a list of the 20 menu items you ordered most recently. So if you want 
to adjust those settings, you don’t have to wade through all the other 
menus looking for them — just head to this menu instead.
 
 Through the Choose Tab option at the bottom of the menu (not shown 
in the figure), you can switch to the My Menu screen. From there, you 
can create your own custom menu that contains your favorite options. 
Chapter 11 details the steps involved in making and using your menu. 
The My Menu screen also contains a Choose Tab option so that you can 
switch back to the Recent Settings menu at any time.
 
 The menu icon changes depending on which of these two functions is 
active; Table 1-1 shows both icons.
Monitoring Shooting Settings 
Your D5000 gives you the following ways to monitor the most critical picture-
taking settings.
 
 
✓ Shooting Information display: If your eyesight is like mine, reading the 
tiny type in the viewfinder is a tad difficult. Fortunately, you also can 
press the Info button to display the Shooting Information screen on the 
monitor. Press the Info button to display the screen; press again to turn 
it off.
 
 As shown in Figure 1-14, the Shooting Information screen displays the 
current shooting settings at a size that’s a little easier on the eyes and 
also provides more detailed data than the viewfinder. If you rotate the 
camera to compose a portrait shot (the image is taller than it is wide), 
the Shooting Information display rotates as well. The default display 
shows white text on black, as shown here. See the section “Customizing 
Figure 1-13: The Recent Settings menu offers 
quick access to the last 20 menu options you 
selected.

27
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
shooting and display options” for 
information on how to switch to 
a different display style.
 
 
 After you display the Shooting 
Information screen, press the 
Information Edit button on the 
back of the camera to switch the 
display to Quick Settings mode. 
Or, if you find it easier, just press 
the Information Edit button twice; 
your first press brings up the 
Shooting Information screen, and 
the second takes you to Quick 
Settings mode. Either way, you 
then can quickly access a variety 
of camera settings, represented 
by the icons at the right side and 
bottom of the screen. Press the 
Multi Selector left or right to high-
light the icon for the setting you 
want to adjust — a little label 
appears at the top of the screen 
to tell you what each icon means, 
as shown in Figure 1-15. Press OK 
to jump directly to the menu 
where you can change the setting. 
 
✓ Viewfinder: You can view some 
camera settings in the viewfinder 
as well. For example, the data 
in Figure 1-16 shows the current 
shutter speed, f-stop, ISO setting, 
and number of shots remaining. 
The exact viewfinder informa -
tion that appears depends on 
what action you’re currently 
undertaking.
If what you see in Figures 1-14 through 
1-16 looks like a big confusing mess, 
don’t worry. Many of the settings 
relate to options that won’t mean any-
thing to you until you make your way 
through later chapters and explore 
the advanced exposure modes. But 
do make note of the following two 
key points of data that are helpful 
even when you shoot in the fully 
automatic modes:
Battery status indicator
Shots remaining
Figure 1-14: Press the Info button to view 
picture-taking settings on the monitor.
Figure 1-15: Press the Information Edit button 
to shift from the Shooting Information screen 
to the Quick Settings display.
Figure 1-16: You also can view some camera 
information at the bottom of the viewfinder.

28
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Battery status indicator: A full battery icon like the one in Figure 1-14 
shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon appears empty, go 
look for your battery charger.
 
 Your viewfinder also displays a tiny low-battery icon when things get to 
the dangerous point. It appears in the lower-left corner of the framing 
screen (that is, not on the row of camera-settings data, but actually in 
the image area).
 
✓ Pictures remaining: Labeled in Figure 1-14 and also visible in the viewfinder 
in Figure 1-16, this value (42, in the figures) indicates how many additional 
pictures you can store on the current memory card. If the number exceeds 
999, the value is presented a little differently. The initial K appears above 
the value to indicate that the first value represents the picture count in 
thousands. For example, 1.0K means that you can store 1,000 more pictures 
(K being a universally accepted symbol indicating 1,000 units). The number 
is then rounded down to the nearest hundred. So if the card has room for, 
say, 1,230 more pictures, the value reads as 1.2K. 
Asking Your Camera for Help
 
 If you see a small question mark in the 
lower-left corner of a menu, press and 
hold the Zoom Out button — note 
the question-mark label above the 
button — to display information about 
the current shooting mode or selected 
menu option. For example, Figure 1-17 
shows the Help screen associated with 
the ISO setting. If you need to scroll 
the screen to view all the Help text, 
keep the button depressed and scroll 
by using the Multi Selector. Release 
the button to close the information 
screen.
A blinking question mark in the viewfinder or Shooting Information screen 
indicates that the camera wants to alert you to a problem. Again, press the 
Zoom Out button to see what solution the camera suggests.
Reviewing Basic Setup Options
Your camera offers scads of options for customizing its performance. Later 
chapters explain settings related to actual picture taking, such as those 
that affect flash behavior and autofocusing. The rest of this chapter details 
options related to initial camera setup, such as setting the date and time, 
adjusting monitor brightness, and the like.
Figure 1-17: Press and hold the Zoom Out 
button to display onscreen help.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Cruising the Setup menu
Start your camera customization by opening the Setup menu. It’s the menu 
marked with the little wrench icon, as shown on the left in Figure 1-18. Scroll 
down the menu using the Multi Selector to display the second screen of the 
menu, shown on the right.
 
 
Figure 1-18: Visit the Setup menu to start customizing your camera.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu item:
 
✓ Format Memory Card: You can use this command to format your 
memory card, which wipes all data off the card and ensures that it’s 
properly set up to record pictures. See the earlier section “Working with 
Memory Cards” for more details about formatting.
 
✓ LCD Brightness: This option enables you to make the camera monitor 
brighter or darker. If you take this step, keep in mind that what you see on 
the display may not be an accurate rendition of the actual exposure of your 
image. Crank up the monitor brightness, for example, and an underexposed 
photo may look just fine. So I recommend that you keep the brightness at 
the default setting (0). A second option on this menu, Auto Dim, causes 
the screen to dim gradually (to save battery power) when the Shooting 
Information screen is displayed. The feature is turned on by default.
 
✓ Info Display Format: You can use this command to choose the type of 
graphic and color used to display basic camera settings. You can save 
different choices for Auto/Scene modes and P, S, A, and M modes. Your 
choices are Classic and Graphic (the default, shown in this book). You 
can display Classic with a Blue, Black, or Orange background, or you can 
display Graphic with a Green, Black, or Brown background.
 
✓ Auto Information Display: As with the Info Display Format, you can 
set this option separately for the Auto/Scene modes and the advanced 
modes (P, S, M, and A). When you enable this option, the shooting infor-
mation is displayed when you press the shutter button halfway, and, if 

30
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
you disable Image Review (an option covered in Chapter 4), after you 
take a picture. When this option is set to Off, you can press the Info 
button to display the Shooting Information screen.
 
✓ Info Wrap-Around: When you enable this option, the cursor wraps 
around from one side of the screen to the other when you are changing 
settings using the Quick Settings screen. That is, if you press the Multi 
Selector to move the cursor to the setting at the top-right corner of the 
screen, an additional press right takes the cursor around the horn to 
the setting at the lower-left corner. With the default option (Off), you’re 
instead stopped dead in your tracks when you reach the boundary of 
the screen.
 
✓ Clean Image Sensor: Your D5000 is set up at the factory to perform an 
internal cleaning routine each time you turn the camera on or off. This 
cleaning system is designed to keep the image sensor — that’s the part 
of the camera that actually captures the image — free of dust and dirt.
 
 By choosing the Clean Image Sensor command, you can perform a 
cleaning at any time, however. Just choose the command, press OK, 
select Clean Now, and press OK again. The other option with this com-
mand specifies whether the camera performs automatic cleaning only 
at startup, only at shutdown, or never. To change the way the camera 
sensor is cleaned, select Clean At Startup/Shutdown instead of Clean 
Now. Then press the Multi Selector right, highlight the cleaning option 
you prefer, and press OK.
 
✓ Lock Mirror Up for Cleaning: This feature is necessary when cleaning 
the camera interior — an operation that I don’t recommend that you 
tackle yourself because you can easily damage the camera if you don’t 
know what you’re doing. And if you’ve used mirror lock-up on a film 
camera to avoid camera shake when shooting long-exposure images, 
note that in this case, the lock-up feature is provided for cleaning pur-
poses only. You can’t take pictures on the D5000 while the mirror lock-
up option is enabled.
 
✓ Video Mode: This option is related to viewing your images on a tele-
vision, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North 
America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard; 
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
 
✓ HDMI: See Chapter 9 for information about this setting, which relates to 
options involved with connecting your camera to an HDMI device.
 
✓ Time Zone and Date: When you turn on your camera for the very first 
time, it automatically displays this option and asks you to set the current 
date and time. Keeping the date/time accurate is important because that 
information is recorded as part of the image file. In your photo browser, 
you can then see when you shot an image and, equally handy, search for 
images by the date they were taken.

31
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Language: You’re asked to specify a language along with the date and 
time when you fire up your camera for the first time. Your choice 
determines the language of text on the camera monitor. Screens in this 
book display the English language, but I find it entertaining on occa-
sion to hand my camera to a friend after changing the language to, say, 
Swedish. I’m a real yokester, yah?
 
✓ Image Comment: See Chapter 11 to find out how to use this feature, 
which enables you to add text comments into a picture file. You then 
can read that information in Nikon ViewNX, the software that shipped 
with your camera. (The text doesn’t actually appear on the image itself.)
 
✓ Auto Image Rotation: Keep this option set at the default setting (On) 
so that the image is automatically rotated to the correct orientation 
(horizontal or vertical) in playback mode. The orientation is recorded 
as part of the image file, too, so the auto-rotating also occurs when you 
browse your image thumbnails in ViewNX. Note: The rotation data may 
not be accurate for pictures that you take with the camera pointing 
directly up or down. See Chapter 4 for more about picture playback. 
Also, when you shoot pictures in burst mode, the first image of the 
sequence is used as the basis for rotation, even if you rotate the 
camera while shooting the sequence.
 
✓ Image Dust Off Ref Photo: This specialty feature enables you to record 
an image that serves as a point of reference for the automatic dust-
removal filter available in Nikon Capture NX 2. I don’t cover this acces-
sory software, which must be purchased separately, in this book.
 
✓ GPS: If you purchase the optional Nikon GPS tracking unit for your 
camera, this menu item holds settings related to its operation. This book 
doesn’t cover this accessory, but the manual that comes with the unit 
explains everything you need to know about using it.
 
✓ Eye-Fi Upload: This menu item (not shown in Figure 1-18) appears only 
if you install an Eye-Fi memory card, a special type of card that enables 
you to send your pictures over a wireless network to your computer. 
Unfortunately, Eye-Fi cards are significantly more expensive than regu-
lar cards — about $50 for a 2MB card. But if you do use the cards and 
you find yourself in a situation where wireless devices are not allowed, 
choose Disable from the Eye-Fi Upload menu to shut off the signal. For 
the whole story on Eye-Fi, including help with setting up your wireless 
transfers, visit the company’s Web site at www.eye.fi.
 
✓ Firmware Version: Select this option and press OK to view what version 
of the camera firmware, or internal software, your camera is running. 
You see three separate firmware items, A, B, and L. At the time this book 
was written, A and B were version 1.00 and L was version 1.001.
 
 Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is important, so visit the 
Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) regularly to find out whether your 
camera sports the latest version. You can find detailed instructions on 
how to download and install any firmware updates on the site.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Browsing the Custom Setting menu
Displaying the Custom Setting menu, 
whose icon is a little pencil, takes you 
to the screen shown in Figure 1-19. 
Here you can access six submenus 
that carry the labels A through F. 
Each of the submenus holds clusters 
of options related to a specific aspect 
of the camera’s operation. Highlight a 
submenu and press OK to get to those 
actions, as shown in Figure 1-20.
In the Nikon manual, instructions 
sometimes reference these settings 
by a menu letter and number. For 
example, “Custom Setting a1” refers 
to the first option on the Autofocus submenu. I try to be more specific in 
this book, however, so I use the actual setting names. (Really, we’ve all got 
enough numbers to remember, don’t you think?)
 
 
Figure 1-20: Highlight a submenu and press OK again to access the available settings.
With that clarification out of the way, the following sections describe only the 
customization options related to basic camera operations. Turn to the index 
for help locating information about other Custom Setting options.
Adjusting auto off timers
To help save battery power, your camera automatically shuts off the moni-
tor, viewfinder, and the exposure metering system if you don’t perform any 
camera operations for a period of time. Through the Auto Off Timers menu 
option, you can specify how long you want the camera to wait before taking 
that step. Open the Custom Setting menu, choose Timers/AE Lock, and press 
Figure 1-19: The Custom Setting menu 
contains six submenus (A through F).

33
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
OK. Then highlight Auto Off Timers, as shown on the left in Figure 1-21. Press 
OK to display the second screen in the figure. Here, you can select from three 
prefab timing settings, Short, Normal, and Long. If none of those settings 
works well for you, choose Custom, which enables you to customize the shut-
off timing for playback and menu display, image review, and metering inde-
pendently. If you go this route, be sure to highlight Done and press OK after 
changing the settings, or your changes don’t “stick.”
 
 
Figure 1-21: Visit the Timers/AE Lock submenu to adjust the timing of automatic monitor, 
 
viewfinder, and metering shut-off.
Customizing shooting and display options
Visit the Shooting/Display submenu (see Figure 1-22) of the Custom Setting 
menu to tweak various aspects of how the camera communicates with you, 
as well as to control a couple of basic shooting functions. Check out the fol-
lowing options: 
 
✓ Beep: By default, your camera 
beeps at you after certain opera-
tions, such as after it sets focus 
when you shoot in autofocus 
mode. If you’re doing top-secret 
surveillance work and need 
the camera to hush up, set this 
option to Off. On the Shooting 
Information Display, a little musi-
cal note icon appears when the 
beep is enabled. Turn the beep 
off, and the icon appears in a 
circle with a slash through it. 
You can also control the volume 
of the beep. Your choices are 
High (the default) and Low. Tres cool.
Figure 1-22: Customize your shooting and 
display options from this menu.

34
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Viewfinder Grid Display: You can display tiny gridlines in the view-
finder by setting this option to On. The gridlines are a great help when 
you need to ensure the alignment of objects in your photo — for exam-
ple, to make sure that the horizon is level in a landscape.
 
✓ ISO Display: Normally, the Shooting Information display and viewfinder 
indicate how many shots will fit in the remaining space on your memory 
card. But if you prefer, you can use this display space to instead show 
the current ISO setting. See Chapter 5 for the complete story on this 
option.
 
✓ File Number Sequence: This option controls how the camera names your 
picture files. When the option is set to Off, as it is by default, the camera 
restarts file numbering at 0001 every time you format your memory card 
or insert a new memory card. Numbering is also restarted if you create 
custom folders (an advanced option covered in Chapter 11). 
 
 Needless to say, this setup can cause problems over time, creating a 
scenario where you wind up with multiple images that have the same 
filename — not on the current memory card, but when you download 
images to your computer. So I strongly encourage you to set the option 
to On. Note that when you get to picture number 9999, file numbering 
is still reset to 0001, however. The camera automatically creates a new 
folder to hold for your next 9999 images.
 
 As for the Reset option, it enables you to assign the first file number 
(which ends in 0001) to the next picture you shoot. Then the camera 
behaves as if you selected the On setting.
 
 Should you be a really, really prolific shooter and snap enough pictures 
to reach image 9999 in folder 999, the camera will refuse to take another 
photo until you choose that Reset option and either format the memory 
card or insert a brand new one.
 
✓ Exposure Delay Mode: If you turn this option on, the camera waits to 
record your picture until about one second after you press and release 
the shutter button. What’s the point? Well, a tiny mirror inside the 
camera moves every time you press the shutter button to take a picture. 
For shots that require a long exposure time, there is a slight chance that 
the vibration caused by that mirror movement will blur the picture. So 
by delaying the actual image capture a little, the odds of that mirror-
related blur are lessened. For normal shooting, leave this one at its 
default setting, Off. And check out Chapter 2 for information on using 
the camera’s self-timer function as an alternative option when you want 
to delay the shutter release.
 
✓ Date Imprint: Through this option, you can choose to imprint the shoot-
ing date, date and time, or the number of days that have passed since 
you took the photo.

35
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 The default setting, which disables the imprint, is the best way to go, 
however; you don’t need to permanently mar your photos to find out 
when you took them. Every picture file includes a hidden vat of text 
data, called metadata, that records the shooting date and time, as well as 
all the camera settings you used — f-stop, shutter speed, and lots more. 
You can view this data in the free software provided with your camera 
as well as in many photo programs. Chapter 8 shows you how. 
 
✓ Live View Display Options: Use these settings to control the screen 
appearance when you use Live View. Chapter 4 tells all.
Preventing shooting without a memory card
If you explore the Controls submenu of the Custom Setting menu, you find 
an option called No Memory Card. Keep this one set at the default (Release 
Locked), which disables the shutter button when no memory card is in the 
camera. If you set it to Enable Release, you can take a temporary picture, 
which appears in the monitor with the word “Demo” but isn’t recorded any-
where. (The feature is provided mainly for use in camera stores, enabling 
salespeople to demonstrate the camera without having to keep a memory 
card installed.)
Customizing external controls
The Controls submenu also enables you to change the function of the AE-L/
AF-L button and the Function button. Chapter 11 provides details, but while 
you’re working with this book, leave both options at their default settings so 
that things operate as I describe. For the record, the AE-L/AF-L default setting 
is AE/AF Lock; the Function button default is the Self Timer option.
This same submenu also offers two “Reverse” options: Reverse Dial Rotation 
and Reverse Indicators. The first one reverses the direction in which you 
rotate the Command dial to change camera settings; the second reverses 
the orientation of the exposure meter, a feature covered in Chapter 5. Again, 
leave both settings at their defaults unless you want to be terribly confused 
when you read instructions here and in the camera manual. (Set Reverse Dial 
Rotation to Off; select the Reverse Indicators option that puts the plus sign 
on the left side of the meter.)
Restoring default settings
You can quickly reset all the Custom Setting menu options to their original, 
factory default settings by choosing the Reset command at the top of the 
menu. (Refer to Figure 1-19.) Press OK to display a confirmation screen that 
asks whether you really want to go forward with the reset; highlight Yes and 
press OK again.

36
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
  
 To restore critical picture-taking settings without affecting options on the 
Custom Setting menu, you can instead use the so-called two-button reset 
method: Press and hold the Info button and the Information Edit button 
simultaneously for longer than two seconds. (The little green dots near the 
buttons are a reminder of this function.)
 
One fly in the ointment to remember — and it’s a pretty big, ugly, hairy fly: 
After you restore the camera defaults, be sure that you also revisit the File 
Number Sequence option on the Shooting/Display submenu of the Custom 
Setting menu. The default setting, Off, is Not a Good Thing; turn the option 
On to avoid file-number confusion. See the earlier section “Customizing 
shooting and display options” for details. (You don’t have to take this step if 
you use the two-button reset method of restoring defaults.)

A
re you old enough to remember the Certs television com-
mercials from the 1960s and ’70s? “It’s a candy mint!” 
declared one actor. “It’s a breath mint!” argued another. 
Then a narrator declared the debate a tie and spoke the 
famous catchphrase: “It’s two, two, two mints in one!”
Well, that’s sort of how I see the Nikon D5000. On 
one hand, it provides a full range of powerful con-
trols, offering just about every feature a serious 
photographer could want. On the other, it offers 
automated photography modes that enable people 
with absolutely no experience to capture beautiful 
images. “It’s a sophisticated photographic tool!” 
“It’s as easy as ‘point and shoot!’” “It’s two, two, 
two cameras in one!”
Now, my guess is that you bought this book for help with 
your camera’s advanced side, so that’s what other chapters 
cover. This chapter, however, is devoted to your camera’s simpler side. 
Because even when you shoot in automatic exposure and focus modes, fol-
lowing a few basic guidelines can help you get better results. For example, 

38
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
your camera offers a variety of automatic exposure modes, some of which 
may be new to you. The mode affects the look of your pictures, so this chap-
ter explains those options. In addition, this chapter reviews flash options 
available to you in automatic modes and covers techniques that enable you 
to get the best performance from your camera’s autofocus and autoexposure 
systems.
Note that this chapter covers normal, through-the-viewfinder still photogra-
phy. For help with shooting in Live View mode, where you compose pictures 
using the monitor instead of the viewfinder, or shooting movies, visit the end 
of Chapter 4. 
Getting Good Point-and-Shoot Results
Your D5000 offers several automatic photography modes, all of which I 
explain later in this chapter. But in any of those modes, the key to good 
photos is to follow a specific picture-taking technique.
 
 To try it out, set the Mode dial on top of the camera to Auto, as shown in the 
left image in Figure 2-1. Then set the focusing switch on the lens to the A 
(autofocus) position, as shown in the right image in Figure 2-1. The figure 
and these instructions assume that you’re using the kit lens — the Nikkor 
18–55mm AF-S lens bundled with the D5000. If you use some other lens, see 
Chapter 1 for information about autofocusing and manual focusing.
 
Auto/Manual focus switch
 
Figure 2-1: Choose these settings for fully automatic exposure and focus.

39
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
Unless you are using a tripod, also set the VR (vibration reduction) switch 
to the On setting, as shown in Figure 2-1. This feature is designed to produce 
sharper images by compensating for camera movement that can occur when 
you handhold the camera. Again, Figure 2-1 features a Nikon VR lens; for 
other lenses, check your lens manual for details about using its vibration 
reduction feature, if provided.
Your camera is now set up to work in the most automatic of automatic 
modes. Follow these steps to take the picture: 
 
1. Looking through the viewfinder, frame the image so that your subject 
appears under one of the 11 focusing points, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
 The focusing points are those 
tiny rectangles you see clustered 
near the center of viewfinder. I 
labeled one of the little guys in 
the figure.
 
2. Press and hold the shutter 
button halfway down.
 
 The camera’s autofocus system 
begins to do its thing. In dim 
light, a little lamp located on the 
front of the camera, just to the 
left of the shutter button, may 
shoot out a beam of light. That 
lamp, called the autofocus-assist 
illuminator, or AF-Assist lamp for 
short, helps the camera measure the distance between your subject and 
the lens so that it can better establish focus. 
 
 At the same time, the autoexposure meter analyzes the light and selects 
initial aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed settings, which are two criti-
cal exposure controls. These two settings appear in the viewfinder; 
in Figure 2-2, the shutter speed is 1/125 second, and the f-stop is f/5.6. 
(Chapter 5 explains these two options in detail.) The built-in flash may 
pop up if the camera thinks additional light is needed.
 
 When the camera has established focus, one or more of the points 
appears surrounded by black brackets, as shown in Figure 2-3. The 
focusing points that are hugged by those rectangles represent the areas 
of the frame that are now in focus. In the display at the bottom of the 
viewfinder, the green focus lamp, labeled in the figure, lights to give you 
further notice that focus has been achieved.
 
 The autoexposure meter continues monitoring the light up to the time 
you take the picture, so the f-stop and shutter speed values in the view-
finder may change if the lighting conditions change.

viewfinder indicate autofocus points.

3. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to record the image.
 
 While the camera sends the 
image data to the camera memory 
card, the memory card access 
lamp lights, as shown in Figure 
2-4. Don’t turn off the camera or 
remove the memory card while 
the lamp is lit, or you may damage 
both camera and card.
 
 When the recording process is 
finished, the picture appears 
briefly on the camera monitor. 
I’m assuming you have the moni-
tor open. If you haven’t opened 
the monitor yet, see Chapter 4. 
If the picture doesn’t appear or 
you want to take a longer look at 
the image, Chapter 4 covers that 
issue as well.
 
I need to add a few important points about working in the Auto mode and the 
other point-and-shoot modes covered in this chapter: 
 
✓ Release mode options: The steps here assume that you are using 
the default Release mode, in which the camera records a single image 
with each press of the shutter button. For a look at other options — 
continuous (burst mode) shooting, self-timer shooting, and remote-
control shooting — see the section, “Changing the (Shutter Button) 
Release Mode,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Flash options: Whether you can use flash and which flash modes are 
available depend on the automatic exposure mode you use. See the next 
section for details.
 
✓ Autofocus options: Assuming that your lens can autofocus with 
the D5000, you can choose to focus manually or take advantage of 
autofocusing in any exposure mode. If you go the autofocus route, you 
can customize the behavior of the autofocus system through options 
discussed in Chapter 6. Instructions in this chapter assume that you 
stick with the default autofocus options. 
 
 But understand that in some cases, no amount of fiddling with the autofo-
cus settings will help your camera lock focus where you intend. Some sub-
jects just give autofocusing systems fits: Highly reflective objects, subjects 
behind fence bars, and scenes in which little contrast exists between the 
subject and the background are just a few potential problem areas.
 
 My advice? If the autofocus mechanism can’t lock onto your subject 
after a few seconds, just switch to manual focusing and be done with it. 
See Chapter 1 for a primer in manual focusing.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
More focus factors to consider
When you focus the lens, either in autofocus 
or manual focus mode, you determine only 
the point of sharpest focus. The distance to 
which that sharp-focus zone extends from that 
point — what photographers call the depth of 
field — depends in part on the aperture setting, 
or f-stop, which is an exposure control. Some of 
the D5000’s Digital Vari-Program autoexposure 
modes are designed to choose aperture settings 
that deliver a certain depth of field. 
The Portrait setting, for example, uses an aper-
ture setting that shortens the depth of field so 
that background objects are softly focused — an 
artistic choice that most people prefer for por-
traits. On the flip side of the coin, the Landscape 
setting selects an aperture that produces a large 
depth of field so that both foreground and back-
ground objects appear tack sharp.
Another exposure-related control, shutter 
speed, plays a focus role when you photograph 
moving objects. Moving objects appear blurry 
at slow shutter speeds; at fast shutter speeds, 
they appear sharply focused. On your D5000, the 
camera chooses a fast shutter speed in Sports 
shooting mode. 
A fast shutter speed can also help safeguard 
against allover blurring that results when the 
camera is moved during the exposure. The faster 
the shutter speed, the shorter the exposure 
time, which reduces the time that you need to 
keep the camera absolutely still. If you’re using 
the Nikon D5000 kit lens, you can also improve 
your odds of shake-free shots by enabling the 
vibration reduction (VR) feature. (Set the switch 
on the lens to the On position.) For a very slow 
shutter speed, using a tripod is the best way to 
avoid camera shake; be sure to turn the VR off 
when you do so. 
Keep in mind, too, that the range of f-stops and 
shutter speeds the camera can select in any of 
the automatic exposure modes depends on the 
lighting conditions. When you’re shooting at 
night, for example, the camera may not be able 
to select a shutter speed fast enough to stop 
action even in Sports mode.
If you want to manipulate focus and depth of 
field to a greater extent than the automated 
exposure modes allow, visit Chapter 6. For an 
explanation of the role of shutter speed and 
aperture in exposure, check out Chapter 5.
 
✓ Exposure problems: If an exposure meter blinks in the viewfinder or 
Shooting Information display, the camera can’t select settings that will 
properly expose the picture. A blinking flash symbol tells you that the 
camera suggests using flash. See Chapter 5 for details about reading the 
exposure meter and coping with exposure problems; see the next sec-
tion for an introduction to using flash.
Using Flash in Automatic Exposure Modes
The built-in flash on your D5000 offers a variety of different modes. Table 2-1 
offers a quick-reference guide to the six basic modes. In addition to these 
basic modes, the camera also offers some combo modes, such as Auto with 
Red-Eye Reduction, Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, and the like.

You can check the current flash mode in the Shooting Information display,

of the specific flash mode but instead just displays the universal lightning 
bolt icon when the flash is enabled, as shown in Figure 2-3, and hides the 
icon when the flash is disabled. If you disable the flash and the camera thinks 
you’re making a mistake, the flash symbol blinks in both displays.

 To change the flash mode, press and hold the Flash button to display the 
screen you see on the right in Figure 2-5. Keep holding the button as you 
rotate the Command dial to cycle through the flash modes available for your 
selected exposure mode.
You can also change the flash mode by using the Quick Settings screen.

and press OK.

Figure 2-6: You also can change the flash mode by using the Quick Settings screen.
 
Now for the bad news: When you do try to change the flash mode, you’ll 
quickly discover that you have access to only a couple of flash modes 
when you shoot in the automatic exposure modes covered in this chapter. 
Additionally, you don’t have access to flash compensation, which enables you 
to diminish or strengthen the burst of light the flash produces, as well as a few 
other flash features your camera offers. Bummer, as the youngsters say.
The upcoming sections tell you which flash modes are available in each of 
the fully automatic exposure modes. For more details about flash photogra-
phy, see Chapter 5.
Exploring Your Automatic Exposure Options
You can choose from eight fully automatic exposure modes, plus a Scene 
mode that expands your shooting options from the camera menus. You can 
access all of the automatic modes, plus the Scene mode, via the Mode dial on 
the top of the camera, shown in Figure 2-7.
The next sections provide details on each of these options. For information 
about the four other settings on the Mode dial — P (programmed autoexpo-
sure), S (shutter-priority autoexposure), A (aperture-priority autoexposure), 
and M (manual exposure) — see Chapter 5.
 
Remember that in any of these exposure modes, you have the option to focus 
manually or take advantage of autofocusing, assuming that your lens is capa-
ble of autofocusing with the D5000. (See Chapter 1 for details on that issue.)

45
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Auto mode
 
 In Auto mode, represented on the Mode dial by the icon you see in the 
margin here, the camera selects all settings based on the scene that it detects 
in front of the lens. Your only job is to lock in focus, either by using the auto-
focus technique that I outline at the beginning of the chapter or by using the 
manual-focusing method explained in Chapter 1.
 
Auto mode
Digital Vari-Program modes
 
Figure 2-7: You can select from eight fully automatic, point-and-shoot

Auto mode is great for casual, quick snapshooting. But keep these details 
in mind:

46
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
What does [r 12] in the viewfinder mean?
When you look in your viewfinder to frame a 
shot, the initial value shown in brackets at the 
right end of the viewfinder display indicates 
the number of additional pictures that can fit 
on your memory card at the currently selected 
Image Size and Image Quality settings. (Chapter 3 
explains those settings.) For example, in the left 
viewfinder image below, the value shows that 
the card can hold 612 more images.
As soon as you press the shutter button half-
way, which kicks the autofocus and exposure 
mechanisms into action, that value changes to 
instead show you how many pictures can fit in 
the camera’s memory buffer. In the right image 
here, for example, the r 12 value tells you that 
12 pictures can fit in the buffer. This number 
also varies depending on the size and quality 
settings you use. (The dot at the left end of the 
display is the focus lamp, which lights when 
focus is achieved.)
So what’s the buffer? It’s a temporary storage 
tank where the camera stores picture data 
until it has time to fully record that data onto 
the camera memory card. This system exists 
so that you can take a continuous series of pic-
tures without having to wait between shots until 
each image is fully written to the memory card. 
When the buffer is full, the camera automati-
cally disables the shutter button until it catches 
up on its recording work. Chances are, though, 
that you’ll very rarely, if ever, encounter this sit-
uation; the camera is usually more than capable 
of keeping up with your shooting rate. 
For more information about rapid-fire photogra-
phy, see the section on action photography in 
Chapter 7. And for help translating all the other 
viewfinder information, check out Chapters 5 
and 6.
 
✓ Autofocusing: At the default settings, autofocusing works like so:
 
• AF-area mode: The Auto Area option is selected by default. That 
means that the camera analyzes the scene and then selects which 
of the 11 autofocus points to use when establishing focus. Chapter 
6 explains how to modify this autofocusing behavior.
 
• Focus mode: The default setting is AF-A. If the subject isn’t moving, 
focus remains locked as long as you hold the shutter button half-
way down. But if the camera detects motion, it continually adjusts 
focus up to the time you press the button fully to record the pic-
ture. To ensure that focus is correct, you must keep your subject 
within the area of the viewfinder covered by the focusing points. 
You can’t alter this aspect of the focusing system in Auto mode as 
you can in the advanced exposure modes. Your only other option 
is to switch to manual focusing. See the Chapter 6 section related 
to the Focus mode option for details.

47
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ Flash: You have only three flash mode choices: Auto, Auto with Red-Eye 
Reduction, and Off. (See Table 2-1 for a reminder of what these modes 
do.) You can’t enable the flash if the camera’s autoexposure meter 
doesn’t sense that additional light is needed.
 
✓ Color: You can’t adjust color. If the image displays a color cast (white 
objects in the scene are not pure white in the image), you must switch 
to a mode that enables you to adjust the White Balance setting, covered 
in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Exposure: You have access to only one exposure-adjustment option, ISO 
Sensitivity. This setting determines the light sensitivity of the camera — 
or, to put it another way, how much light is needed to properly expose 
the image. By default, this option is set to Auto, and the camera adjusts 
the ISO Sensitivity as needed. For more information about how ISO 
affects your pictures — and why you may want to select a specific ISO 
setting — visit Chapter 5. 
 
I purposely didn’t include an example of a photo taken in Auto mode 
because, frankly, the results that this setting creates vary widely depending 
on how well the camera detects whether you’re trying to shoot a portrait, 
landscape, action shot, or whatever, as well as on lighting conditions. But the 
bottom line is that full auto is a one-size-fits-all approach that may or may 
not take best advantage of your camera’s capabilities. So if you want to more 
consistently take great pictures instead of merely good ones, I encourage you 
to explore the exposure, focus, and color information found in Part II so that 
you can abandon this mode in favor of modes that put more photographic 
decisions in your hands.
Digital Vari-Program modes
In Auto mode, the camera tries to figure out what type of picture you want 
to take by assessing what it sees through the lens. If you don’t want to rely 
on the camera to make that judgment, your D5000 offers seven Digital Vari-
Program modes, which are designed to automatically capture specific scenes 
in ways that are traditionally considered best from a creative standpoint. For 
example, most people prefer portraits that have softly focused backgrounds. 
So in Portrait mode, the camera selects settings that can produce that type of 
background. 
 
All the Digital Vari-Program modes share a few limitations: 
 
✓ Exposure: As with Auto mode, the camera takes complete control of 
exposure, with the exception of the ISO Sensitivity setting, introduced in 
the preceding section and detailed in Chapter 5.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Autofocusing: You get the same choices as in Auto mode — that is, you can 
adjust the AF-Area mode option but not the Focus mode setting (except to 
choose MF for manual focusing). Chapter 6 details both features.
 
✓ Color: You can’t tweak color, either. Some modes manipulate colors in 
ways that you may or may not appreciate, and you’re stuck if you have a 
color cast problem.
 
✓ Flash: Available flash options vary depending on the Digital Vari-
Program mode you select, but none of the modes offers complete 
flash flexibility.
In the next sections, you can read about the unique features of each of 
the Digital Vari-Program modes. To see whether you approve of how your 
camera approaches the different scenes, take some test shots. If you aren’t 
happy with the results, you can switch to one of the advanced exposure 
modes (P, S, A, or M) and then check out Chapters 5–7 to find out how to 
manipulate whatever aspect of the picture isn’t to your liking.
For details about the additional automatic modes that you can access by set-
ting the Mode dial to the Scene setting, check out the section “Scene mode,” 
later in this chapter.
Auto Flash Off mode
 
 The Auto Flash Off mode delivers the same results as Auto mode but ensures 
that the flash doesn’t fire. In other words, think of this mode as a faster alter-
native to selecting Auto mode and then changing the flash setting to Off. 
From a practical standpoint, this mode provides an easy way to ensure that 
you don’t break the rules when shooting in locations that don’t permit flash: 
museums, churches, and so on.
Portrait and Child modes
The Portrait and Child modes are so closely related that it makes sense to 
consider them together.
 
 First, Portrait mode. This mode selects an aperture setting designed to pro-
duce a short depth of field, which results in a slightly blurry background and 
thus puts the visual emphasis on your subject. Figure 2-8 offers an example. 
However, this effect occurs only if your subject is at least a few feet from the 
background. The extent to which the background blurs also depends on the 
other depth-of-field factors that I discuss in Chapter 6. Portrait mode also 
selects settings designed to produce natural skin tones. 
 
 Child mode, represented by the toddler icon you see in the margin here, 
offers a slight variation on the theme. It differs from Portrait mode in a couple 
of ways:

49
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
✓ In Child mode, the camera renders 
hues that are traditionally found 
in clothing and backgrounds more 
boldly than in Portrait mode. In 
Figure 2-9, for example, notice that 
the football and the little boy’s 
shorts are noticeably more vivid 
than in the portrait example in 
Figure 2-8. Skin tones are left natu-
ral, although they, too, can appear 
a little more saturated, depending 
on the subject and the lighting.
 
✓ Child mode chooses an aperture 
setting that’s designed to produce 
a slightly larger depth of field than 
Portrait mode. That extra depth 
of field can come in handy if the 
children in question are moving a 
little because they’re more likely 
to remain within the zone of sharp 
focus. However, in order to bal-
ance out the change in aperture, 
Child mode must use a slightly 
slower shutter speed than Portrait. 
So for subjects that are really 
on the move, you typically have 
better results with Sports mode, 
which favors a faster shutter, to 
freeze action, over depth-of-field 
considerations.
Understand that the aperture and shut-
ter speed the camera selects in either 
mode depend greatly on the available 
light, the subject, and the range of aper-
ture settings on your lens. Your mileage 
may vary, as they say. Sometimes you 
may see very little difference between 
the two modes except for the more-
vivid background colors of Child mode.
Both modes have these traits in 
common:
 
✓ Autofocusing: Autofocusing 
works as it does for Auto mode, 
described earlier in this chapter.
Portrait mode
Figure 2-8: Portrait mode produces a 
softly focused background and natural 
skin tones.
Child mode
Figure 2-9: Child mode renders non-skin 
tones more vividly than Portrait mode.

50
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Flash: You can choose from Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction flash, or 
Off. You can’t enable the flash, though, if the camera doesn’t think extra 
lighting is needed. This restriction can be problematic when shooting 
outdoor portraits, which often benefit from a small pop of flash light 
even in bright sunlight. See Chapter 7 for an example as well as some 
other tips on shooting portraits by flash light. 
In my experience, the biggest decision about whether to use Portrait or Child 
mode depends on your color preferences. I prefer Portrait mode because the 
strengthened background colors in Child mode can easily distract the eye from 
the subject’s face, which should be the point of emphasis in any portrait.
Landscape mode
 
 Whereas Portrait mode aims for a very shallow depth of field (small zone of 
sharp focus), Landscape mode, which is designed for capturing scenic vistas, 
city skylines, and other large-scale subjects, goes the other route, selecting 
an aperture setting (f-stop) that produces a large depth of field. As a result, 
objects both close to the camera and at a distance appear sharply focused. 
Figure 2-10 offers an example. In this picture, focus was set on the palm tree 
in the foreground. Notice that the palm trees on the right side of the image 
are in sharp focus as well.
 
Landscape mode
Doug Sahlin
 
 Figure 2-10: Landscape mode produces a large zone of sharp focus and also boosts color 
intensity slightly.

51
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
Note these other factoids about Landscape mode:
 
✓ Depth of field: As with Portrait mode, the camera manipulates depth 
of field by adjusting the aperture setting (f-stop). To produce the larger 
depth of field, the camera tries to use a high f-stop value, which means 
a very small aperture. But in dim lighting, the camera may be forced 
to open the aperture to allow enough light into the camera to properly 
expose the photo, so the depth of field may not be enough to keep the 
entire landscape in sharp focus. (Again, Chapter 5 offers a primer on 
aperture; Chapter 6 fully explains depth of field.)
 
✓ Color and contrast: This mode boosts color saturation and contrast 
slightly to produce the kind of bold, rich hues that most people prefer in 
landscape pictures. In addition, greens and blues are emphasized. If you 
want more control, switch to an advanced exposure mode (P, S, A, or M) 
and see Chapter 6 for details.
 
✓ Autofocusing: By default, the camera uses the Single Point AF-Area mode 
setting. That means that it looks at only one autofocus point to estab-
lish focus rather than considering all 11. The center autofocus point is 
selected automatically, but you can use the Multi Selector to select a dif-
ferent focus point. The Focus mode is set to AF-A by default. The camera 
locks focus when you depress the shutter button halfway — unless it 
senses a moving subject, in which case focus is continually adjusted up 
to the time you take the shot. Your other Focus mode option is MF for 
manual focus. See Chapter 6 for help with all this autofocus stuff.
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled, which is typically no big deal: 
Because of its limited range, a built-in flash is of little use when shooting 
most landscapes anyway. However, if you attach an external flash unit, 
you can use it in this mode. (Chapter 5 discusses external flash units.)
Sports mode
 
 Sports mode activates a number of settings that can help you photograph a 
moving object, whether it’s an athlete, a race car, or a romping dog like the 
one in Figure 2-11. Here’s what you need to know: 
 
✓ Shutter speed: In order to catch a moving subject without blur, you 
need a fast shutter speed. So in Sports mode, the camera automatically 
chooses that fast shutter speed for you.
 
 Understand, though, that in dim lighting, the camera may not be able 
to select a very fast shutter speed and still deliver a good exposure. 
And because getting a good exposure trumps all, the shutter speed the 
camera uses may not be fast enough to “freeze” action, especially if your 
subject is moving very quickly.
 
 In Figure 2-11, the camera selected a shutter speed that did, in fact, 
catch my furkid in mid-romp, although if you look very closely, you can 
see some slight blurring of his beard. Because of the very bright light, 

52
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
the camera also selected 
a small aperture setting, 
which produces a large 
depth of field — so the 
grass in the background is 
as sharply focused as that 
in the foreground. To fully 
understand these issues, 
explore Chapters 5 and 6.
 
✓ Autofocusing: The camera 
sets the AF-Area mode 
option to the Dynamic 
Area mode. Chapter 6 
provides full details, but 
here’s the short story: You 
use the Multi Selector to 
indicate which focusing 
point you want the camera 
to use when calculating 
the focusing distance. But 
if the object moves out of 
that point, the camera tries 
to draw focus information 
from the other points. 
With luck, your subject 
will move within one of the 
focus points before you 
record the image.
 
 Additionally, Sports 
mode selects the AF-A 
Focus mode, which means that if the camera detects motion, it continu-
ally adjusts focus up to the time you fully depress the shutter button 
and take the shot. Your other option is MF mode, for manual focusing. 
(Chapter 6 details the Focus mode options as well.)
 
 If your subject moves after you press the shutter button halfway, be 
sure that you adjust the framing so that the subject remains under one 
of the focus points. Otherwise, the camera may not lock focus on the 
subject correctly.
 
✓ Flash: The built-in flash is disabled. That can be a problem in low-light situ-
ations, but it also enables you to shoot successive images more quickly 
because the flash needs a brief period to recycle between shots. If you own 
an external flash unit, however, you can use it in Sports mode if you like; 
just be aware that you may sacrifice in the speed-shooting department 
because of the necessary flash-recycle time. Additionally, you are limited to 
a maximum shutter speed of 1/200 second, which may not be fast enough to 
freeze a fast-moving subject. Chapter 5 has tips on this subject.
Sports mode
Figure 2-11: To capture moving subjects without blur, 
try Sports mode.

53
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
Sometimes, allowing a moving object to blur can actually create a heightened 
sense of motion — an artistic choice that you can’t make in Sports mode. For 
more control over shutter speed, try out S mode (shutter-priority autoexpo-
sure), explained in Chapter 5.
Close Up mode
 
 Switching to Close Up mode doesn’t enable you to focus at a closer distance 
to your subject than normal as it does on some non-SLR cameras. The close-
focusing capabilities of your camera depend entirely on the lens you bought, 
so check your lens manual for details.
Close Up mode does affect your pictures in a couple of ways, however:
 
✓ Depth of field: Close Up mode, like Portrait mode, selects an aperture 
setting designed to produce short depth of field, which helps keep back-
ground objects from competing for attention with your main subject. 
As with Portrait mode, though, how much the background blurs varies 
depending on the available light (which determines the aperture setting 
the camera can use), the distance between your subject and the back-
ground, as well as the lens focal length, all outlined in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Autofocusing: At the default settings, the camera uses the Single Point 
AF-Area mode, meaning that it looks to only a single focus point to estab-
lish focus. Initially, the center point is selected, but you can press the 
Multi Selector to choose a different point. Or you can follow the instruc-
tions in Chapter 6 to choose an entirely different AF-Area mode option.
 
 As for the Focus mode, also covered in Chapter 6, the camera uses the 
AF-A setting. Again, that means that focus is locked when you press 
the shutter button halfway. But if the camera detects motion, it adjusts 
focus as needed, up to the time you take the picture. Your only other 
alternative is to use manual focusing.
 
✓ Flash: You can set the Flash mode to Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction, 
and Off. (I urge you, though, to be very careful about using the built-in 
flash when you’re shooting a person or animal at close range — that 
strong burst of light isn’t healthy for the eyes.)
Chapter 7 offers additional tips on close-up photography.
Night Portrait mode
 
 This mode is designed to deliver a better-looking flash portrait at night (or in 
any dimly lit environment). It does so by constraining you to using Auto Slow 
Sync, Auto Slow Sync with Red-Eye Reduction, or Off flash modes. In all three 
flash modes, the camera selects a shutter speed that results in a long expo-
sure time. That slow shutter speed enables the camera to rely more on ambi-
ent light and less on the flash to expose the picture, which produces softer, 
more even lighting.

54
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
I cover the issue of long-exposure and slow-sync flash photography in detail 
in Chapter 5. For now, the critical thing to know is that the slower shutter 
speed means that you probably need a tripod. If you try to handhold the 
camera, you run the risk of moving the camera during the long exposure, 
resulting in a blurry image. Enabling the vibration reduction (VR) feature of 
your lens, if available, can help, but for nighttime shooting, even that may not 
permit successful handheld shooting. Your subjects also must stay perfectly 
still during the exposure, which can add to the challenge.
Autofocusing in this mode works the same way as in Auto mode, described 
earlier in this chapter.
Scene mode
 SCENE
SCENE
 This option enables you to choose an additional array of scene-specific 
modes, all described briefly in the following list. Like the other scene modes, 
these work best when you’ve got the optimum conditions for which the 
modes were designed. 
If you want to give them a try, set the Mode dial to Scene. In the Shooting 
Information display, a little icon representing the currently selected mode 
appears in the top-left corner of the screen, as shown on the left in Figure 
2-12. By rotating the Command dial, you bring to life a screen similar to the 
one on the right in the figure. As you rotate the dial, you cycle through the 
various Scene mode settings, with a sample image appearing for each one. 
If you pause for a second, the camera locks in the currently selected scene 
type, and the normal Shooting Information screen reappears. 
 
 
 Figure 2-12: After setting the Mode dial to Scene, rotate the Command dial to select the type 
of picture you want to capture.
If you prefer, you can also choose Scene Mode from the Shooting menu. Press 
OK to display a scrolling list of all the available modes, highlight your choice, 
and press OK.

 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
However you choose to go about selecting a Scene mode, you can choose 
from these options:
 
✓ Night Landscape: Use this mode when shooting city landscapes at night. 
The camera chooses a low ISO setting to reduce noise and a white bal-
ance setting that renders lights in their natural colors. Flash is disabled 
when this mode is selected. You’ll have to attach your camera to a 
tripod to avoid blurry shots because this mode uses a slow shutter 
speed.
 
✓ Party Indoors: Use this mode when photographing indoor parties. The 
camera chooses a white balance setting to faithfully reproduce the 
ambient light. You can set the Flash mode to Auto, Auto with Red-Eye 
Reduction, or Off, depending on the ambient light. 
 
✓ Beach/Snow: Use this mode when you’re photographing a scene with 
lots of bright areas, like sand or snow. In this mode, flash and Autofocus 
Assist are disabled.
 
✓ Dusk/Dawn: Use this mode when you’re taking pictures of landscapes 
just before the sun rises, or just after the sun sets. Flash and the AF-
Assist beam are disabled. I recommend using a tripod when using this 
mode as well, as the shutter speed the camera selects may be very slow.
 
✓ Candlelight: Use this mode when shooting portraits lighted by candle-
light. Flash is disabled when using this mode, and, since the ambient 
light will be dim, the shutter speed will likely be slow. Again, you’ll need 
to mount your camera on a tripod to avoid a blurry photo.
 
✓ Autumn Colors: Use this mode when shooting landscapes in the Fall. 
This mode yields pictures with saturated reds and yellows of autumn 
leaves. The built-in flash is disabled. Mount your camera on a tripod in 
lowlight situations.
 
✓ Sunset: Use this mode when you’re photographing sunsets and the sun 
is in the picture. This mode attempts to preserve the brilliant colors 
you see at sunset. And, yep, you guessed it: A tripod produces a better 
chance of a sharp shot, since the light will be low and the camera will 
need to use a slow shutter speed.
 
 When photographing sunsets, don’t stare at the sun directly through 
your viewfinder, as this can permanently damage your vision, especially 
when you’re using a telephoto lens. In fact, you may want to use Live 
View when shooting sunsets. (See Chapter 4 for help with Live View.)
 
✓ Pet Portrait: Use this mode when you’re taking portraits of a pet that’s 
a moving target. When using this mode, the AF-Assist beam is disabled. 
You can set the flash to Auto, Auto with Red-Eye Reduction, and Off.
 
✓ Blossom: Use this mode when you’re photographing a field of blooming 
flowers. Flash is disabled when using this mode. Use a tripod when 
photographing in lowlight situations.

56
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Food: Use this mode when you’re photographing food. When shooting in 
this mode, the camera saturates the colors for vivid photographs. You 
can use the flash when shooting in this mode. If you want to use flash in 
this mode, press the Flash button on the side of the camera to pop up 
the flash. To go flash-free, simply close the flash unit.
 
✓ Silhouette: Use this mode when the sun is behind your subject(s), and 
you want the subjects to render as silhouettes. Flash is disabled in this 
mode. Use a tripod in lowlight situations.
 
✓ Low Key: Use this mode when you’re shooting dark scenes and you 
want a somber look. Highlights are rendered properly, but shadows and 
dark areas of the image are black. Flash is disabled when shooting in 
this mode. Use a tripod for sharp, blur-free shots.
 
✓ High Key: Experiment with using this mode for an interesting effect 
when photographing bright objects in bright light — crystal on a lace 
doily, for example. Flash is disabled in High Key mode.
 
 In all these modes, the camera sets the Focus mode to the AF-A setting 
by default. Chapter 6 explains the Focus mode completely, but for now, 
just understand that in the AF-A mode, focus is set when you press the 
shutter button halfway, unless the camera senses movement in front 
of the lens. In that case, it continues to adjust focus as needed until the 
moment you snap the picture. Your only other choice is to select the MF 
(manual focus) setting and take the focusing reins. 
 
 The default setting for the other critical autofocus option, AF-Area mode, 
depends on the scene mode you select. Chapter 6 details all the options 
and shows you how to select a different setting if you’re not happy with 
the camera’s initial choice. 
Changing the (Shutter Button) Release Mode
 
In addition to all its other mode settings — exposure modes, focus modes, 
flash modes, and the like — your D5000 offers a generically named but criti-
cal setting called Release mode. This setting determines how you trigger the 
actual image capture and what happens after you take that step. You have 
the following options:
 
 
✓ Single Frame: This setting, which is the default, records a single image 
each time you press the shutter button completely. In other words, this 
is normal-photography mode.
 
 
✓ Continuous: Sometimes known as burst mode, this mode records a con-
tinuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter button. In 
this mode, you can capture up to four frames per second. When using 
this mode, you must disable the built-in flash.

57
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
 The Continuous mode is designed to make it easier for you to capture 
action. But keep in mind that the actual number of frames you can 
record per second depends in part on your shutter speed. At a slow 
shutter speed, the camera may not be able to reach the maximum frame 
rate. (See Chapter 5 for an explanation of shutter speed.)
 
 
✓ Self-Timer: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select this mode, press 
the shutter button, and run into the frame. As soon as you press the 
shutter button, the AF-assist illuminator on the front of the camera 
starts to blink, and the camera emits a series of beeps (assuming that 
you didn’t disable its voice, a setting I cover in Chapter 1). A few sec-
onds later, the camera captures the image
 
 At the default settings, the capture-delay time is 10 seconds, and the 
camera records one shot for each press of the shutter button. But you 
can adjust both the delay time and the number of images recorded by 
visiting the Custom Setting menu. After you pull up the menu, highlight 
Timers/AE Lock, press OK, highlight Self-Timer, and press OK to display 
the left screen in Figure 2-13. Highlight the self-timer setting you want to 
change and press OK to access the available settings. For example, on 
the right in Figure 2-13, you see the timer delay settings. Again, highlight 
your choice and press OK to wrap things up. 
 
 
 You can select a capture-delay time of 2, 5, 10, or 20 seconds and set the 
number of images recorded between 1 and 9.
 
 Whatever the settings you choose, remember this little quirk about the 
Self-Timer mode: After you capture the self-timer image (or images, if 
you set the Number of Shots option to capture more than one picture), 
the camera reverts to whatever Release mode you previously used.
 
   
✓ Delayed Remote and Quick Response Remote: The final two Release 
mode settings relate to the optional Nikon wireless remote-control unit. 
If you select Delayed Remote, the camera snaps the picture two seconds 
after you press the shutter-release button on the remote unit. If you 
select Quick Response Remote, the image is captured immediately.
 
 
Figure 2-13: You can adjust the self-timer capture delay via the Custom Setting menu.

58
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 When you use Self-Timer or the remote control modes, you should 
remove the little rubber cup that surrounds the viewfinder and then 
insert the viewfinder cover that shipped with your camera. (Dig around 
in the accessories box — the cover is a tiny black piece of plastic, about 
the size of the viewfinder.) Otherwise, light may seep into the camera 
through the viewfinder and affect exposure. You can also simply use the 
camera strap or something else to cover the viewfinder in a pinch.
 
 
✓ Quiet: This Release mode setting is designed for situations when you 
want the camera to be as silent as possible. It disables the autofocus 
beep, and the camera is silent except for the shutter-release sound you 
hear when you take a picture.
To change the Release mode, bring up the Quick Settings display and navigate 
to the Release mode icon, highlighted in Figure 2-14. Then press OK, highlight 
the desired mode from the menu shown on the right side of Figure 2-14, and 
press OK.
 
 
 Figure 2-14: You can check the current Release mode in the Shooting Information 
display.
 
 If you want to use Self-Timer mode, you have an even easier option: Just press 
the Fn button on the left side of the camera. The Shooting Information screen 
displays a text label telling you that you’re in Self-Timer mode, and you’re 
ready to take your picture. Again, though, the camera reverts to the previously 
selected Release mode after you capture your self-timer shot. (If you don’t use 
the Self-Timer Release mode frequently, you can customize the function of the 
Fn button as outlined in Chapter 11.)

59
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
With the exception of the Self-Timer setting, your selected Release mode 
stays in force until you change it. However, the camera cancels out of the 
remote control modes if it doesn’t receive a signal from the remote after 
about one minute. You can adjust this timing through an option on the 
Timers/AE Lock submenu of the Custom Setting menu. Select the Remote On 
Duration option and press OK to reveal the available options. The maximum 
delay time is 15 minutes; keep in mind that a shorter delay time saves battery 
life. After the delay time expires, the camera resets itself to either Single or 
Continuous mode, depending on which mode you last used.
Taking Advantage of Interval Timer Shooting 
In addition to the various Release modes covered in the preceding section, 
you can use the Interval Timer Shooting feature to automatically capture a 
series of pictures over a given period of time. The common photo lingo for 
this type of capture is time-lapse photography. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Display the Shooting menu, highlight Interval Timer Shooting as 
shown on the left in Figure 2-15, and press OK.
 
 The screen on the right in Figure 2-15 appears.
 
2. To begin setting up your capture session, highlight Now or Start Time.
 
• If you want to start the captures right away, highlight Now, as 
shown on the right in Figure 2-15.
 
• To set a later start time for the captures, highlight Start Time.
 
 
Figure 2-15: The Interval Timing feature enables you to do time-lapse photography.

60
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
3. Press the Multi Selector right to display the capture-setup screen.
 
  If you selected Start Time in Step 2, the screen looks like the one in 
Figure 2-16. If you selected Now, the Start Time option is dimmed and 
the Interval option is highlighted instead.
 
Start time
Interval time
Number of shots
 
 Figure 2-16: Press the Multi Selector right or left to cycle through 
the setup options; press up or down to change the highlighted value.
 
4. Set up your recording session.
 
 You get three options: Start Time, Interval (time between shots) and Number 
of Intervals (number of shots recorded). The current settings for each option 
appear in the bottom half of the screen, as labeled in Figure 2-16.
 
 At the top of the screen, little value boxes appear. The highlighted box is 
the active option and relates to the setting that’s highlighted at the bottom 
of the screen. For example, in the figure, the hour box for the Start Time set-
ting is active. Press the Multi Selector right or left to cycle through the value 
boxes; to change the value in a box, press the Multi Selector up or down.
 
 A few notes about your options:
 
• The Interval and Start Time options are based on a 24-hour clock. 
(The current time appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen 
and is based upon the date/time information you entered when set-
ting up the camera.)
 
• For the Interval option, the left column box is for the hour setting; 
the middle, minutes; and the right, seconds. Make sure that the 
value you enter is longer than the shutter speed you plan to use.

61
 Chapter 2: Taking Great Pictures, Automatically
 
• For the Start Time option, you can set the hour and minute values 
only. Again, the Start Time option is available only if you selected 
Start Later in Step 2.
 
• The Number of Intervals 
option determines how 
many pictures will be 
recorded. You can set the 
value as high as 999.
 
5. When you’re done setting up 
the capture options, press the 
Multi Selector right until you 
see the On and Off options 
on the screen, as shown in 
Figure 2-17.
 
6. Highlight On and press OK.
 
 If you selected Now as your 
interval-capture starting option, 
the first shot is recorded about 
three seconds later. If you set a delayed start time, the camera displays 
a “Timer Active” message for a few seconds and before returning to the 
Shooting menu.
A few final factoids:
 
✓ Interrupting interval shooting: Just turn the camera off or change the 
Mode dial to a different setting if you want to stop the interval-shooting 
session.
 
✓ Bracketing: You can apply automatic bracketing during interval shoot-
ing. See Chapter 5 to find out what bracketing is all about.
 
✓ Release mode: You can set the Release mode to any setting you want, 
but the camera always records just a single shot at each interval stage. 
You can’ use the remote control or self-timer, either.

Quality and Size
In This Chapter

▶ Exploring resolution, pixels, and ppi
▶ Calculating the right resolution for traditional print sizes

▶ Picking the right JPEG quality level

A
lmost every review of the D5000 contains glowing reports 
about the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve 
no doubt discovered for yourself, those claims are true, 
too: This baby can create large, beautiful images.
What you may not have discovered is that Nikon’s 
default Image Quality setting isn’t the highest that 
the D5000 offers. Why, you ask, would Nikon do 
such a thing? Why not set up the camera to pro-
duce the best images right out of the box? The 
answer is that using the top setting has some down-
sides. Nikon’s default choice represents a compro-
mise between avoiding those disadvantages while 
still producing images that will please most 
photographers.
Whether that compromise is right for you, however, depends 
on your photographic needs. To help you decide, this chapter 
explains the Image Quality setting, along with the Image Size setting, 
which is also critical to the quality of images that you print. Just in case 
you’re having quality problems related to other issues, though, the first 
section of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diagnosis guide.

64
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
A word of warning before you dive in: This stuff may be a little confusing at 
first. In fact, unless you’ve worked with image-editing applications, or delved 
into the wild world of document size versus resolution, I pretty much guaran-
tee it. Some math is even involved, which is usually against my principles. On 
top of that, discussions of picture quality and size involve lots of technical 
terms, such as pixels, resolution, JPEG compression, and the like.
So take it slowly, and if your eyes start to glaze over, put the book down, and 
come back later for another go-round. It may require a few reads of this chap-
ter, but before long, you’ll feel confident about controlling these important 
aspects of your pictures.
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition, 
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m 
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image, 
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show 
five common digital-image defects.
 
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt
 
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.

65
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only one is affected 
by the Image Quality setting on your D5000. So if you aren’t happy with your 
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly 
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies: 
 
✓ Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles 
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which 
you do via the Image Size control. See the next section, “Considering 
Resolution (Image Size),” for details.
 
✓ JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that 
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the 
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to as 
JPEG artifacts. This is the defect related to the Image Quality setting; see 
“Understanding the Image Quality Options” to find out more.
 
✓ Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the 
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise can occur with very long expo-
sure times or when you choose a high ISO Sensitivity setting on your 
camera. You can explore both issues in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the 
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s White 
Balance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues. 
Note, though, that you can control white balance only when you shoot 
in the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M).
 
✓ Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of 
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens 
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the 
camera’s image sensor. See the sidebar “Maintaining a pristine view,” 
elsewhere in this chapter, for information on safe lens and sensor 
cleaning. 
 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in 
ViewNX or some other photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. 
Some defects, especially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appear-
ance until you see them at a magnified view. (See Part III for information 
about using ViewNX.)
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the 
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the 
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these 
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a 
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some 
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a pho-
tograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your D5000 
is suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can 

66
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
produce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following 
the guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, 
you can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.
Considering Resolution (Image Size)
Like other digital devices, your D5000 creates pictures out of pixels, which 
is short for picture elements. You can see some pixels close up in the right 
example of Figure 3-2, which shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area 
in the left image.
 
 
Figure 3-2: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.
You specify the pixel count of your images, also known as the resolution, via 
the Image Size control. The D5000 offers three Image Size settings: Large, 
Medium, and Small; Table 3-1 lists the resulting resolution values for each 
setting.
Table 3-1 
Image Size (Resolution) Options
Setting
Resolution
Large
4288 x 2848 pixels (12.3 MP)
Medium
3216 x 2136 pixels (6.9 MP)
Small
2144 x 1424 pixels (3.1 MP)
In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents 
the image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and 
the number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the 

67
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
approximate total resolution. This number is usually stated in megapixels, 
abbreviated MP for short. One megapixel equals 1 million pixels.
 
Note, however, that if you select RAW (NEF) as your file format, all images 
are captured at the Large setting. You can vary the resolution only if you 
select JPEG as the file format. The upcoming section “Understanding the 
Image Quality Options” explains file formats. 
So how many pixels are enough? To make the call, you need to understand 
how resolution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sec-
tions explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.
If you’re already schooled on the subject and just want to know how to select 
a resolution setting on your D5000, skip to “Setting Image Size and Quality,” 
near the end of this chapter, for specifics.
Pixels and print quality
 
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large 
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at 
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels, 
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in 
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the 
right example in Figure 3-2.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to 
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-x-10-inch print 
at 200 ppi, for example, you need 1600 horizontal pixels and 2000 vertical 
pixels (or vice versa, depending on the orientation of your print).
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at 
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the 
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your 
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And 
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer 
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down per 
inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce 1 pixel.)
Table 3-2

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Even though many photo editing programs enable you to add pixels to an 
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with, 
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully 
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The 
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images 
that illustrate this issue.
Pixels and screen display size
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, televi-
sion, or other screen device as it does printed photos. What resolution does 
determine is the size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photography, 
so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you need way 
fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. For example, 
Figure 3-3 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an e-mail message.
 
For e-mail images, I recommend a maximum of 640 pixels for the picture’s 
longest dimension. If your image is much larger, the recipient may not be 
able to view the entire picture without scrolling the display.
In short, even if you use the smallest Image Size setting on your D5000, you’ll 
have more than enough pixels for onscreen use, whether you display the pic-
ture on a computer monitor, a digital projector, or television set — even one 
of the new, supersized high-definition TVs. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue 
and also shows you how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.
Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.
 
Large files present several problems:
 
✓ You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s 
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 
✓ The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on 
the memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can 
hamper fast-action shooting.
 
✓ When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and 
download.
 
✓ When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer 
needs more resources and time to process large files.

69
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
 
 Figure 3-3: The low resolution of this image (450 x 300 pixels) ensures that it can be viewed 
without scrolling when shared via e-mail.
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But 
note that the Image Quality setting also affects file size. See the upcoming 
section “Understanding the Image Quality Options” for more on that topic. 
The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures fit on my memory card?” pro-
vides additional thoughts about the whole file-storage issue.
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure 
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your 
photos and share them online? 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the fol-
lowing recommendations about the Image Size setting: 
 
✓ Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create 
a low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online. 
Chapter 9 shows you how.

70
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print. 
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the 
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 
✓ For everyday images, Medium is a good choice. I find the Large setting 
to be overkill for most casual shooting, which means that you’re creat-
ing huge files for no good reason. Keep in mind that even at the Medium 
setting, your pixel count (3216 x 2136) exceeds what you need to pro-
duce an 8-x-10-inch print at 200 ppi.
 
✓ Choose Large for an image that you plan to crop, print very large, 
or both. The benefit of maxing out resolution is that you have the flex-
ibility to crop your photo and still generate a decent-sized print of the 
remaining image. Perhaps you’re taking pictures at the zoo, for example, 
and you want a close-up of your favorite animal. Even with a telephoto 
lens, you may not be able to get the close-up view you want. So take the 
approach shown in Figure 3-4. Frame the scene as tightly as your lens 
permits and then capture the shot at the highest resolution. You then 
can crop the photo and still have enough pixels left to produce a great 
print, as you see in the right image.

Size setting.

 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
✓ Reduce resolution if shooting speed is paramount. If you’re shooting 
action and the shot-to-shot capture time is slower than you’d like — that 
is, the camera takes too long after you take one shot before it lets you 
take another — dialing down the resolution may help. Also see Chapter 
7 for other tips on action photography.
After you decide which resolution setting is right for your picture, visit the 
section “Setting Image Size and Quality,” later in this chapter.
Understanding the Image Quality Options
If I had my druthers, the Image Quality option on the D5000 would instead be 
called File Type, because that’s what the setting controls.
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
That question is one of the first asked by new 
camera owners — and it’s an important one 
because you don’t want to run out of space on 
your memory card just as the perfect photo-
graphic subject presents itself.
As explained in the Image Size and Image 
Quality discussions in this chapter, image res-
olution (pixel count) and file format (JPEG or 
RAW) together help determine the size of the 
picture file which, in turn, determines how many 
photos fit in a given amount of camera memory. 
(The actual file size of any image also depends 
on a few other factors, including the level of 
detail and color in the subject.)
On the D5000, file sizes range anywhere from 
16.9MB (megabytes) to 0.4MB, depending on the 
combination of Image Size and Image Quality 
settings you select. That means the capacity 
of a 2GB (gigabyte) memory card ranges from 
89 pictures to a whopping 3800 pictures, again, 
depending on your Size/Quality settings.
The table here shows the approximate file sizes 
for just some Size/Quality combinations; you 
can find a table that lists all the possibilities in 
your camera manual if you’re curious.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Here’s the deal: The file type, more commonly known as a file format, determines 
how your picture data is recorded and stored. Your choice does impact picture 
quality, but so do other factors, as outlined at the beginning of this chapter. In 
addition, your choice of file type has ramifications beyond picture quality.
At any rate, your D5000 offers the two file types common on most of today’s 
digital cameras: JPEG and Camera RAW, or just RAW for short, which goes 
by the specific moniker NEF on Nikon cameras. The next sections explain the 
pros and cons of each format. If your mind is already made up, skip ahead to 
“Setting Image Size and Quality,” near the end of this chapter, to find out how 
to make your selection.
 
Don’t confuse file format with the Format Memory Card option on the Setup 
menu. That option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for 
details.
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, this format is the default setting on your D5000, as it is 
for most digital cameras. JPEG is popular for two main reasons:
 
✓ Immediate usability: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display 
JPEG files, so you can share them online immediately after you shoot 
them. The same can’t be said for NEF (RAW) files, which must be pro-
cessed and converted to JPEG files before you can share them online. 
And although you can view and print RAW files in Nikon ViewNX without 
converting them, many third-party photo programs don’t enable you to 
do that. You can read more about the conversion process in the upcom-
ing section “NEF (RAW): The purist’s choice.”
 
✓ Small files: JPEG files are smaller than NEF (RAW) files. And smaller files 
consume less room on your camera memory card and in your comput-
er’s storage tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates 
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws 
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see 
in the JPEG Artifacts example in Figure 3-1.
Fortunately, your camera enables you to specify how much compression 
you’re willing to accept. The Image Quality menu offers three JPEG settings, 
which produce the following results: 
 
✓ JPEG Fine: At this setting, the compression ratio is 1:4 — that is, the file 
is four times smaller than it would otherwise be. In plain English, that 
means that very little compression is applied, so you shouldn’t see many 
compression artifacts, if any.
 
✓ JPEG Normal: Switch to Normal, and the compression ratio rises to 1:8. 
The chance of seeing some artifacting increases as well.

73
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
✓ JPEG Basic: Shift to this setting, 
and the compression ratio jumps to 
1:16. That’s a substantial amount of 
compression and brings with it a lot 
more risk of artifacting.
Note, though, that even the JPEG Basic 
setting on your D5000 doesn’t result in 
anywhere near the level of artifacting 
that you see in my example in Figure 3-1. 
Again, that example is exaggerated to 
help you be able to recognize artifacting 
defects and understand how they differ 
from other image-quality issues.
In fact, if you keep your image print 
or display size small, you aren’t likely 
to notice a great deal of quality differ-
ence between the Fine, Normal, and 
Basic compression levels, although 
details in the Fine version may appear 
slightly crisper than the Normal and 
Basic options. It’s only when you greatly 
enlarge a photo that the differences 
become apparent.
Take a look at Figures 3-5 and 3-6, for example. I captured the scene in Figure 
3-5 four times, keeping the resolution the same for each shot but varying the 
Image Quality setting. For the photo you see in Figure 3-5, I used the JPEG Fine 
setting. I thought about printing the three other shots along with the JPEG Fine 
example, but frankly, you wouldn’t be able to detect a nickel’s worth of differ-
ence between the examples at the size that I could print them on this page. 
So Figure 3-6 shows just a portion of each shot at a greatly enlarged size. The 
first three images show the JPEG Fine, Normal, and Basic shots; for the fourth 
image, I used the NEF (RAW) setting, which applies no compression. (Note that 
during the process of converting the RAW image to a print-ready file, I tried to 
use settings that kept the RAW image as close as possible to its JPEG cousins 
in all aspects but quality. But any variations in exposure, color, and contrast 
are a result of the conversion process, not of the format per se.)
Even at the greatly magnified size, it takes a sharp eye to detect the quality 
differences between the Raw and Fine images. When you carefully inspect 
the Normal version, you can see some artifacting start to appear; jump to the 
Basic example, and compression artifacting becomes more obvious.
 
Nikon chose to use the Normal setting as the default on the D5000. I suppose 
that’s okay for everyday images that you don’t plan to print or display very 
large. And because file size shrinks as you apply more compression, Normal 
enables you to fit more photos on your memory card than Fine or NEF (RAW).
Figure 3-5: This subject offered a good 
test for comparing the Image Quality 
settings.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps

Figure 3-6: Here you see a portion of the tower at greatly enlarged views.
For my money, though, the file-size benefit you gain when going from Fine 
to Normal isn’t worth even a little quality loss, especially with the price of 
camera memory cards getting lower every day. You never know when a 
casual snapshot is going to turn out to be so great that you want to print or 
display it large enough that even minor quality loss becomes a concern. And 
of all the defects that you can correct in a photo editor, artifacting is one of 
the hardest to remove. So if I shoot in the JPEG format, I stick with Fine.
I suggest that you do your own test shots, however, carefully inspect the results 
in your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level of artifact-
ing you can accept. Artifacting is often much easier to spot when you view 
images onscreen. It’s difficult to reproduce artifacting here in print because 
the print process obscures some of the tiny defects caused by compression.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change 
the file type to NEF (RAW). Or consider your other option, which is to record 
two versions of each file, one RAW and one JPEG. The next section offers 
details.

75
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
Whichever format you select, be aware of one more important rule for preserv-
ing the original image quality: If you retouch pictures in your photo software, 
don’t save the altered images in the JPEG format. Every time you alter and save 
an image in the JPEG format, you apply another round of lossy compression. 
And with enough editing, saving, and compressing, you can eventually get to 
the level of image degradation shown in the JPEG example in Figure 3-1, at the 
start of this chapter. (Simply opening and closing the file does no harm.)
Always save your edited photos in a nondestructive format. TIFF, pro-
nounced tiff, is a good choice and is a file-saving option available in most 
photo editing programs. Should you want to share the edited image online, 
create a JPEG copy of the TIFF file when you’re finished making all your 
changes. That way, you always retain one copy of the photo at the original 
quality captured by the camera. You can read more about TIFF in Chapter 8, 
in the section related to processing RAW images. Chapter 9 explains how to 
create a JPEG copy of a photo for online sharing.
NEF (RAW): The purist’s choice
The other picture file type you can create on your D5000 is called NEF RAW, 
or just RAW (as in uncooked) for short.
 
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of RAW. Nikon’s is called NEF, so you 
see the three-letter extension NEF at the end of RAW filenames.
RAW is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers, for these 
reasons:
 
✓ Greater creative control: With JPEG, internal camera software tweaks 
your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharpness as 
needed to produce the results that Nikon believes its customers prefer. 
With RAW, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed image 
data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer and 
uses special software known as a RAW converter to produce the actual 
image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at that point. 
The upshot is that “shooting RAW” enables you, and not the camera, to 
have the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 
✓ Higher bit depth: Bit depth is a measure of how many distinct color 
values an image file can contain. JPEG files restrict you to 8 bits each for 
the red, blue, and green color components, or channels, that make up a 
digital image, for a total of 24 bits. That translates to roughly 16.7 million 
possible colors. On the D5000, a RAW file delivers a higher bit count, col-
lecting 12 bits per channel.
 
 Although jumping from 8 to 12 bits sounds like a huge difference, you 
may not really ever notice any difference in your photos — that 8-bit 
palette of 16.7 million values is more than enough for superb images. 
Where having the extra bits can come in handy is if you really need to 

76
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
adjust exposure, contrast, or color after the shot in your photo editing 
program. In cases where you apply extreme adjustments, having the 
extra original bits sometimes helps avoid a problem known as banding 
or posterization, which creates abrupt color breaks where you should 
see smooth, seamless transitions. (A higher bit depth doesn’t always 
prevent the problem, however, so don’t expect miracles.)
 
✓ Best picture quality: Because RAW doesn’t apply the destructive com-
pression associated with JPEG, you don’t run the risk of the artifacting 
that can occur with JPEG. 
But of course, as with most things in life, RAW isn’t without its disadvantages. 
To wit:
 
✓ You can’t do much with your pictures until you process them in a 
RAW converter. You can’t share them online, for example, or put them 
into a text document or multimedia presentation. You can print them 
immediately if you use Nikon ViewNX, but most other photo programs 
require you to convert the RAW files to a standard format first. So when 
you shoot RAW, you add to the time you must spend in front of the com-
puter instead of behind the camera lens.
 
✓ To get the full benefit of RAW, you need software other than Nikon 
ViewNX. The ViewNX software that ships free with your camera does 
have a command that enables you to convert RAW files to JPEG or to 
TIFF, introduced in the preceding section. However, this free tool gives 
you limited control over how your original data is translated in terms of 
color, exposure, and other characteristics — which defeats one of the 
primary purposes of shooting RAW.
 
 Nikon Capture NX 2 offers a sophisticated RAW converter, but it costs 
about $180. (Sadly, if you already own Capture NX, you need to upgrade 
to version 2 to open the RAW files from your D5000.) If you own Adobe 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, however, you’re set; both include 
the converter that most people consider one of the best in the industry. 
Watch the sale ads, and you can pick up Elements for well under $100. 
You may need to download an update from the Adobe Web site (www.
adobe.com) to get the converter to work with your D5000 files.
 
 Of course, the D5000 also offers an in-camera RAW converter, found on 
the Retouch menu. But although it’s convenient, this tool isn’t the easiest 
to use because you must rely on the small camera monitor when making 
judgments about color, exposure, sharpness, and so on. The in-camera 
tool also doesn’t offer the complete cadre of features available in Capture 
NX 2 and other converter software utilities.
 
 Chapter 8 offers more information on the in-camera conversion process 
and also offers a look at the converter found in ViewNX. 

77
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
✓ RAW files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that 
RAW applies doesn’t degrade image quality, but the tradeoff is a larger 
file. In addition, Nikon RAW files are always captured at the maximum 
resolution available on the camera, even if you don’t really need all 
those pixels. For both reasons, RAW files are significantly larger than 
JPEGs, so they take up more room on your memory card and on your 
computer’s hard drive or other picture-storage device. 
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you 
make up your mind, refer to Figure 3-6 and compare the JPEG Fine example 
with its NEF (RAW) counterpart. You may be able to detect some subtle 
quality differences when you really study the two, but a casual viewer likely 
would not, especially if shown the entire example images at normal print 
sizes rather than the greatly magnified views shown in the figure. I took 
Figure 3-5, for example, using JPEG Fine.
 
That said, I do shoot in the RAW format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting 
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For 
example, if you use a capable RAW converter, you can specify how bright you 
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer 
your deepest shadows. With JPEG, the camera makes those decisions, which 
can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure in your 
photo editor later. And the extra bits in a RAW file offer an additional safety 
net because I usually can push the exposure adjustments a little further in my 
photo editor if necessary without introducing banding.
I also go RAW if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But keep 
in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I don’t 
really have much else to do with my time than process scads of RAW images. 
Oh, and I’m a bit of a perfectionist, too. (Although I’m more bothered by imper-
fections than I am motivated to remove them. A lazy perfectionist, if you will.)
If you do decide to try RAW shooting, you can select from four options on 
your D5000’s Image Quality menu: 
 
✓ NEF (RAW): This setting produces a single RAW file. Again, you don’t 
have a choice of Image Size settings; the camera always captures the file 
at the maximum resolution.
 
✓ NEF (RAW)+JPEG Fine, Normal, or Basic: You also can choose to cap-
ture the image as both a NEF file and a JPEG file, and you can specify 
whether you want the JPEG version recorded at the Fine, Normal, or 
Basic setting. (You can also set the resolution of the JPEG file at Large, 
Medium, or Small.) Of course, with two files, you consume more space 
on your camera memory card.

78
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
I often choose the RAW+JPEG Fine option when I’m shooting pictures I want 
to share right away with people who don’t have software for viewing RAW 
files. I upload the JPEGs to a photo-sharing site where everyone can view 
them, and then I process the RAW versions of my favorite images for my own 
use when I have time. Having the JPEG version also enables you to display 
your photos on a DVD player or TV that has a slot for an SD memory card — 
most can’t display RAW files but can handle JPEGs. Ditto for portable media 
players and digital photo frames. 
If you choose to create both files, note a couple of things:
 
✓ When you view your pictures on the camera, you see only one photo, and 
the Image Quality data reflects your capture setting (Raw+Basic, for exam-
ple.) See Chapter 4 to find out how to view picture data.
 
✓ If you delete the displayed image, you delete both the JPEG and RAW 
files. (After you transfer the two files to your computer, deleting one 
doesn’t affect the other.)
Chapter 4 explains more about viewing and deleting photos; see the upcom-
ing section “Setting Image Size and Quality” to find out how to specify the 
size for your JPEG files.
My take: Choose JPEG Fine or NEF (RAW)
At this point, you may be finding all this technical goop a bit much — I recog-
nize that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you. 
Until you have time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of 
JPEG versus RAW, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the matter:
 
✓ If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and 
interest to do the RAW conversion, shoot RAW. See Chapter 8 for more 
information on the conversion process.
 
✓ If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of 
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with 
JPEG Fine. 
 
✓ If you don’t mind the added file-storage space requirement and want the 
flexibility of both formats, choose RAW+JPEG. If you need your JPEGs to 
exhibit the best quality, go with RAW+JPEG Fine. 
 
✓ If you go with JPEG only, stay away from JPEG Normal and Basic. The 
tradeoff for smaller files isn’t, in my opinion, worth the risk of compres-
sion artifacts. As with my recommendations on image size, this fits the 
“better safe than sorry” formula: You never know when you may capture 
a spectacular, enlargement-worthy subject, and it would be a shame to 
have the photo spoiled by compression defects. If you select RAW+JPEG, 
of course, this isn’t as much of an issue because you always have the 
RAW version as backup if you aren’t happy with the JPEG quality. 

79
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Setting Image Size and Quality
 
To sum up this chapter: The Image Size and Image Quality options together 
determine the quality of your pictures and also play a large role in image file 
size. Choose a high Image Quality setting (NEF or JPEG Fine) and the maxi-
mum Image Size setting (Large), and you get top-quality pictures and large 
file sizes. Combining the lowest Quality setting (JPEG Basic) with the lowest 
Size setting (Small) greatly shrinks files, enabling you to fit lots more pictures 
on your memory card, but it also increases the chances that you’ll be disap-
pointed with the quality of those pictures, especially if you make large prints.
As for actually selecting the options you want to use, the fastest route is to 
use the Quick Settings screen. Bring up the Shooting Information display and 
then press the Information Edit button to get to the Quick Settings screen. 
Then use the Multi Selector to highlight the Image Quality icon in the top- 
right corner, as shown on the left in Figure 3-7. Press OK to view the second 
screen in the figure, where you can select the option you want to use. When 
you select one of the settings, the screen shows you the resulting file size (in 
megabytes) and the number of pictures that will fit on your memory card at 
that size. Highlight your choice and then press OK. Repeat the process to set 
the Image Size option which is right below the Image Quality setting on the 
Quick Settings screen.
 
 
Figure 3-7: You can use the Quick Settings screen to change the Image Size and Quality 
 
settings.
As an alternative, you can adjust the settings via the Shooting menu, as 
shown in Figure 3-8. Either way, remember that when you choose the RAW 
(NEF) format, you don’t need to worry about the Image Size setting — the 
camera captures all RAW images at the Large resolution. If you go with one of 
the RAW+JPEG options, the Image Size setting affects the JPEG version only.

80
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
Figure 3-8: You also can set Image Size and Image Quality via the Shooting menu.
 
Again, adjusting the Image Size or Image Quality setting changes the pic-
ture file size, which changes the number of new shots you can fit on the 
current memory card. You can monitor the remaining card capacity in the 
Shots Remaining area of the Shooting Information display. (It reads 133 in 
Figure 3-7.)
Maintaining a pristine view
Often lost in discussions of digital photo defects — 
compression artifacts, pixelation, and the like — 
is the impact of plain-old dust and dirt on picture 
quality. But no matter what camera settings you 
use, you aren’t going to achieve great picture 
quality with a dirty lens. So make it a practice 
to clean your lens on a regular basis, using one 
of the specialized cloths and cleaning solutions 
made expressly for that purpose.
If you continue to notice random blobs or hair-
like defects in your images (refer to the last 
example in Figure 3-1), you probably have a dirty 
image sensor. That’s the part of your camera 
that does the actual image capture — the digi-
tal equivalent of a film negative, if you will.
Your D5000 offers an automated, internal 
sensor-cleaning mechanism. By default, this 
automatic cleaning happens every time you 
turn the camera on or off. You also can request 
a cleaning session at any time via the Clean 
Image Sensor command on the Setup menu. 
(Chapter 1 has details on this menu option.)
But if you frequently change lenses in a dirty 
environment, the internal cleaning mechanism 
may not be adequate, in which case a manual 
sensor cleaning is necessary. You can do this 
job yourself, but . . . I don’t recommend it. Image 
sensors are pretty delicate beings, and you 
can easily damage them or other parts of your 
camera if you aren’t careful. Instead, find a local 
camera store that offers this service. In my area 
(central Indiana), sensor cleaning costs from 
$30–$50. 
One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean 
never — try to clean any part of your camera 
using a can of compressed air. Doing so can 
not only damage the interior of your camera, 
blowing dust or dirt into areas where it can’t be 
removed, but also crack the external monitor.

Monitor Matters: Picture Playback 
and Live View Shooting

W
ithout question, my favorite thing about digital pho-
tography is being able to view my pictures on 
the camera monitor the instant after I shoot them. No 
more guessing whether I captured the image I wanted 
or I need to try again, as in the film era. And no more 
wasting money on developing and printing pictures 
that stink.
Of course, with the D5000, you can use the monitor 
not only to review your photos, but also to preview 
them. That is, if you turn on Live View shooting, 
you can use the monitor instead of the viewfinder to 
compose your shots. And the monitor on the D5000 
can tilt this way and that, which opens new possibilities 
for your photography. You can position the monitor parallel 
to the ground for snail’s view shots without having to crawl 
on your belly, for example. In Live View mode, you also can record 
short digital movies.

82
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Because all these functions involve some of the same buttons, bells, and 
whistles, I cover them together in this chapter. In addition, this chapter 
explains how to delete pictures that you don’t like and protect the ones you 
love from accidental erasure. (Be sure to also visit Chapter 9, which covers 
some additional ways to view your images, including how to create slide 
shows and display your photos and movies on a television screen.)
Using the LCD Monitor
The default position of your D5000 monitor is rotated away from you. To 
review images and access the menus, the monitor needs to be rotated.
 
Before rotating the monitor for the first time, please (please) read the 
instructions and warnings in your camera manual thoroughly to avoid any 
potential damage to this critical part of your equipment. Then consider the 
following steps as a general reminder of the process only:
 
1. Push the tabs down on each side of the viewfinder and gently pull the 
monitor away from the camera body.
 
2. Gently pull the monitor down and rotate it in the direction shown on 
the left in Figure 4-1.
 
 Don’t force the monitor at any time. The ribbon that connects the moni-
tor to the camera is somewhat fragile and may get damaged if you get 
rough with the monitor or try to force it to move in a direction it was not 
designed to go.
 
3. Rotate the monitor a full 180 degrees until the display screen is facing 
the front of the camera.
 
 At this stage, the Nikon logo on the back of the monitor is upside down 
and backwards.
 
4. Raise the monitor toward the viewfinder until it locks into position.
 
 You’re ready to start reviewing and previewing your pictures, as shown 
on the right in Figure 4-1.
Enabling Automatic Picture Rotation
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — 
whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented 
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo. 
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file.

83
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
Release tab
 
Figure 4-1: The monitor is locked and loaded, ready for picture playback.
During playback, the camera reads the data and automatically rotates the 
image so that it appears in the upright position, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-2. The image is also automatically rotated when you view it in Nikon 
ViewNX, Capture NX 2, and some other photo programs that can interpret 
the data.
 
 
 Figure 4-2: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or 
sideways (right).
 
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented 
pictures.

84
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Automatic rotation is turned on by default with the D5000. But if you prefer 
to turn the feature off, you can. Your vertically oriented pictures then appear 
sideways, as shown on the right in Figure 4-2.
To check or adjust the status of automatic rotation, you need to visit two menus:
 
1. On the Setup menu, select Auto Image Rotation, as shown in the left 
image in Figure 4-3.
 
 You need to scroll to the second screen of the menu to get to the Auto 
Image Rotation option. If you select On, the rotation data is added to the 
picture file. Select Off to leave the data out.
 
 
Figure 4-3: Visit the Setup and Playback menus to enable image rotation.
 
2. Display the Playback menu and select the Rotate Tall option, as shown 
on the right in Figure 4-3.
 
 Select On if you want the camera to read the orientation data and rotate 
vertical pictures. Select Off if you prefer not to rotate the photos during 
playback. The images are still rotated automatically in photo programs 
that can read the orientation data in the file.
 
Shooting with the lens pointing directly up or down sometimes confuses the 
camera, causing it to record the wrong data in the file. If that issue bothers 
you, turn off Auto Image Rotation on the Setup menu before you shoot the 
pictures. The camera then won’t record the orientation information as part of 
the picture file. Note that even if you select On, images aren’t rotated for the 
instant review display, explained next.
Disabling and Adjusting Instant Review
After you take a picture, it automatically appears briefly on the camera 
monitor. By default, this instant-review period lasts four seconds. But you 
can customize this behavior in two ways:

85
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ Adjust the length of the instant-review period: Display the Custom 
Setting menu, highlight the Timers/AE Lock submenu, and then press OK 
to display the screen shown on the left in Figure 4-4. Highlight Auto Off 
Timers and press OK. Highlight Custom and press OK again to display 
the screen on the right in Figure 4-4. Highlight Image Review and then 
press the Multi Selector right to access the timing options (not shown 
in the figure). You have five choices, ranging from four seconds to 10 
minutes. Highlight the timing option you want to use and then press OK 
to return to the Custom screen. Highlight Done, as shown on the right in 
the figure, and press OK to lock in your choice.
 
 Note that through this same Custom screen, you also can vary the 
length of time that a picture is displayed during regular playback before 
the monitor turns off. Just select the Playback/menus option on the 
screen you see on the right in Figure 4-4 to make the change.
 
 
Figure 4-4: To adjust the length of the instant-review period, visit the Custom Setting menu.
 
✓ Disable instant review: Because 
any monitor use is a strain on 
battery power, consider turning 
off instant review altogether if 
your battery is running low. To 
turn off the feature, first display 
the Playback menu. Then high-
light Image Review, as shown in 
Figure 4-5. Press OK, highlight 
Off, and press OK once more. 
You can still view your pictures 
by pressing the Playback button 
at any time.

Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To take a look at the pictures on your camera memory card, take these steps:
 
1. If you created custom image folders, specify which ones you want to 
view. Otherwise, skip to Step 2.
 
 Your D5000 normally organizes pictures automatically into folders that 
are assigned generic names: 100D5000, 101D5000, and so on. You can 
see the name of the current folder by looking at the Active Folder option 
on the Shooting menu. (The default folder name appears as just D5000 
on the menu.)
 
 You also can create custom folders through that same menu option. 
(See Chapter 11 for specifics.) If you do, you need to tell the camera 
whether you want to view only pictures in the current folder or in all 
folders. To do so, display the Playback menu and highlight Playback 
Folder, as shown on the left in Figure 4-6. Press OK to display the screen 
shown on the right in the figure. Select All to view all folders; select 
Current to view only the active folder. Press OK to exit the screen.
 
 
Figure 4-6: If you create custom folders, specify which folder you want to view.
 
 Again, this step applies only if you create custom folders. If you let the 
camera handle all folder-creation duties, you can view all pictures on the 
card regardless of the Playback Folder setting.
 
 
2. Press the Playback button, labeled in Figure 4-7.
 
 
 The monitor displays the last picture you took, along with some picture 
data, such as the frame number of the photo. To find out how to inter-
pret the picture information and specify what data you want to see, see 
the upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.”

4. To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button halfway 
and then release it.
 
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo 
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-7. You can also display multiple images at a 
time, as explained next.
Viewing multiple images at a time
 
 Along with viewing images one at a time, you can choose to display 4, 9, or 72 
thumbnails, as shown in Figure 4-8. Just press the button shown in the margin 
here and labeled Zoom Out/Thumbnail display in Figure 4-7. Press once to 
cycle from single-picture view to 4-thumbnail view, press again to shift to 
9-picture view, and press once more to bring up those itty-bitty thumbnails 
featured in 72-image view. Press yet again, and you shift to Calendar view, a 
nifty feature explained in the next section.

Figure 4-8: You can view 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails at once.
 
 To reduce the number of thumbnails, press the Zoom In button, shown cling-
ing to the margin here and in Figure 4-7. Or to jump immediately to single-
frame view without having to cycle back through all the display modes, just 
press the OK button.
In any of the thumbnail display modes, use these techniques to navigate your 
photo collection:
 
✓ Scroll through your pictures. Rotate the Command dial or press the 
Multi Selector right or left.
 
✓ Select an image. As you scroll through your pictures, a yellow box sur-
rounds the currently selected image. For example, in Figure 4-8, Image 19 
is selected. To select a different image, use the Command dial or Multi 
Selector to scroll the display until the highlight box surrounds the image.
 
✓ View the selected image at the full-frame size. Press the OK button. 
 
 After you return to full-frame view, pressing OK displays the Retouch 
menu. Now you can select a retouch option and apply it to the image. 
See Chapter 10 for a look at some of the picture fixes you can apply to 
your photo from the Retouch menu.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Displaying photos in Calendar view
In Calendar display mode, you see 
a little calendar on the monitor, as 
shown in Figure 4-9. By selecting a 
date on the calendar, you can quickly 
navigate to all pictures you shot on 
that day. (An empty date indicates 
that your memory card doesn’t 
contain any photos from that day.)
The key to navigating Calendar view is 
the Zoom Out button:
 
 
1. Press the Zoom Out button as 
needed to cycle through the 
thumbnail display modes until 
you reach Calendar view.
 
 If you’re currently viewing images in full-frame view, for example, you 
need to press the button four times to get to Calendar view.
 
2. Using the Multi Selector or Command dial, move the yellow highlight 
box over a date that contains an image.
 
 In Figure 4-9, for example, the 27th day of April is selected. (The number 
of the month appears in the top-left corner of the screen.) After you 
select a date, the right side of the monitor displays a vertical strip of 
thumbnails of pictures taken on that date.
 
3. To view all thumbnails from the selected date, press the Zoom Out 
button again.
 
 Now the vertical thumbnail strip becomes active, and you can scroll 
through the thumbnails by pressing the Multi Selector up and down, or 
by scrolling with the Command 
dial. A second highlight box 
appears in the thumbnail strip to 
indicate the currently selected 
image.
 
 
4. To temporarily display a larger 
view of the selected thumbnail, 
hold down the Zoom In button.
 
 The image filename appears 
under the larger preview, as 
shown in Figure 4-10. When you 
release the button, the large pre-
view disappears, and the calen-
dar comes back into view.
Figure 4-9: Calendar view makes it easy to 
view all photos shot on a particular day.
Figure 4-10: Press and hold the Zoom In 
button to temporarily view the selected 
image at a larger size.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
5. To jump back to the calendar and select a different date, press the 
Zoom Out button again.
 
 You can just keep pressing the button to jump between the calendar and 
the thumbnail strip as much as you want.
 
6. To exit Calendar view and return to single-image view, press OK.
 
 If you want to return to Calendar view, you have to press the Zoom Out 
button four times to cycle from full-frame view through the different 
thumbnail display modes.
Zooming in for a closer view
After displaying a photo in single-frame view, you can magnify it so that you 
can get a close-up look at important details, such as whether someone’s eyes 
are closed in a portrait. Here’s the scoop:
 
 
✓ Zoom in. Press the Zoom In button, shown in the margin here. You can 
magnify the image to a maximum of 13 to 27 times its original display 
size, depending on the resolution (pixel count) of the photo. Just keep 
pressing the button until you reach the magnification you want.
 
 Note the magnifying glass icon on the button face — the plus sign in the 
middle is your reminder that this button enlarges the image. 
 
✓ View another part of the magni-
fied picture. When an image 
is magnified, a little navigation 
thumbnail showing the entire 
image appears briefly in the 
lower-right corner of the moni-
tor, as shown in Figure 4-11. The 
yellow outline in this picture-in-
picture image indicates the area 
that’s currently consuming the 
rest of the monitor space. Use 
the Multi Selector to scroll the 
yellow box and display a different 
portion of the image. After a few 
seconds, the navigation thumb-
nail disappears; just press the 
Multi Selector in any direction to 
redisplay it.
Figure 4-11: Use the Multi Selector to move 
the yellow outline over the area you want to 
inspect.

91
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ Inspect faces. When you magnify a photo that contains what the 
camera perceives to be faces, the picture-in-picture thumbnail displays a 
white border around each detected face. Press the Information Edit 
button and rotate the Command dial to examine each face with a magni-
fied view.
 
✓ View more images at the same magnification. Here’s another neat 
trick: While the display is zoomed, you can rotate the Command dial to 
display the same area of the next photo at the same magnification. 
So if you shot the same subject several times, you can easily check how 
the same details appear in each one.
 
 
✓ Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the Zoom 
Out button, shown in the margin here. This button also sports the 
magnifying glass symbol, but this time with a minus sign to indicate 
that it reduces the display size. That little grid-like thingy next to the 
magnifying glass reminds you that the button also comes into play when 
you want to go from full-frame view to one of the thumbnail views or 
Calendar view. 
 
✓ Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal 
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the Zoom Out 
button until you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the OK 
button, which quickly returns you to the standard, full-frame view.
Viewing Picture Data
In single-image picture view, you can choose from five Photo Information 
modes, each of which presents a different set of shooting data along with the 
image. To cycle between the different modes, press the Multi Selector up 
or down.
 
Note, though, that three of the five modes don’t appear unless they are 
enabled through a menu option. To enable them, display the Playback menu 
and highlight Display Mode, as shown on the left in Figure 4-12. Press OK to 
display the second screen you see in the figure. A check mark in the box next 
to a mode means that mode is enabled. To toggle a display mode on, high-
light it and then press the Multi Selector right. After turning on the options 
you want to use, highlight Done and press OK again to return to the Playback 
menu. 
The next sections explain exactly what details you can glean from each 
display mode. I present them here in the order they appear if you cycle 
through the modes by pressing the Multi Selector down. You can spin 
through the modes in the other direction by pressing the Multi Selector up.

Figure 4-12: You must enable some of the information display modes via the Playback menu.
File Information mode
In this display mode, the monitor 
displays the data shown in Figure 4-13. 
The following bits of info appear at the 
top of the monitor:
 
✓ Protect Status: A little key icon 
indicates that you used the 
camera’s file-protection feature 
to prevent the image from 
being erased when you use the 
camera’s Delete function. See 
“Protecting Photos,” later in this 
chapter, to find out more. (Note: 
Formatting your memory card, a 
topic discussed in Chapter 1, does 
erase even protected pictures.) 
This area appears empty if you 
didn’t apply protection.
 
✓ Retouch Indicator: This icon 
appears if you used any of the 
Retouch menu options to alter 
the image. (I cover most Retouch features in Chapter 10.) Again, no icon 
means that you didn’t retouch the photo.
 
✓ Frame Number/Total Pictures: The first value here indicates the frame 
number of the currently displayed photo; the second tells you the total 
number of pictures on the memory card. In Figure 4-13, for example, the 
image is number 41 out of 41.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Underneath the image, you can view these details:
 
✓ Folder Name: Folders are named automatically by the camera unless 
you create custom folders, an advanced trick you can explore in Chapter 
11. The first camera-created folder is named 100D5000. Each folder 
can contain up to 9999 images; when you exceed that limit, the camera 
creates a new folder and assigns the next folder number: 101D5000, 
102D5000, and so on.
 
✓ Filename: The camera also automatically names your files. 
 
 Filenames end with a three-letter code that represents the file format, 
which is either JPG (for JPEG) or NEF (for Camera RAW) for still photos. 
Chapter 3 discusses these two formats. If you record a movie (a project 
you can explore near the end of this chapter), the file extension is AVI, 
which represents a digital-movie file format. If you create a dust-off 
reference image file, an advanced feature designed for use with Nikon 
Capture NX 2, the camera instead uses the extension NDF. (Because this 
software must be purchased separately, I don’t cover it or the dust-off 
function in this book.)
 
 The first three letters of filenames also vary. Here’s what the possible 
three-letter codes indicate:
 
• DSC: This code means normal, plain-old picture file. 
 
• SSC: This trio appears at the beginning of files that you create with 
the Small Picture option on the Retouch menu. Chapter 9 discusses 
this feature.
 
• CSC: This code is used for images that you alter using other 
Retouch menu features. For example, I applied the D-Lighting 
correction feature to the image in Figure 4-13, so the filename 
begins with CSC, and the Retouch Indicator appears in the top-left 
corner of the monitor.
 
• _ (underscore): If you change the Color Space setting on the 
Shooting menu to the Adobe RGB color profile, a topic you can 
investigate in Chapter 6, an underscore character precedes the 
filename. (The exception is for dust-off reference photos, which 
don’t use the underscore.) For photos taken in the default color 
profiles (sRGB), the underscore appears after the three-letter code, 
as in DSC_.
 
 Each image is also assigned a four-digit file number, starting with 0001. 
When you reach image 9999, the file numbering restarts at 0001, and the 
new images go into a new folder to prevent any possibility of overwriting 
the existing image files. For more information about file numbering, see 
the Chapter 1 section that discusses the File Number Sequence option.

94
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Date and Time: Just below the folder and filename info, you see the 
date and time that you took the picture. Of course, the accuracy of this 
data depends on whether you set the camera’s date and time values 
correctly, which you do via the Setup menu. Chapter 1 has details.
 
✓ Image Quality: Here you can see which Image Quality setting you used 
when taking the picture. Again, Chapter 3 has details, but the short story 
is this: Fine, Normal, and Basic are the three JPEG recording options, 
with Fine representing the highest JPEG quality. The word RAW indicates 
that the picture was recorded in the Nikon Camera RAW format, NEF.
 
✓ Image Size: This value tells you the image resolution, or pixel count. See 
Chapter 3 to find out about resolution.
RGB Histogram mode
Press the Multi Selector 
down to shift from File 
Information mode to this 
mode, which displays 
your image in the manner 
shown in Figure 4-14. 
(Remember: You can view 
your picture in this mode 
only if you enable it via 
the Display Mode option 
on the Playback menu. See 
“Viewing Picture Data,” 
earlier in this chapter, 
for help.) 
Underneath the image 
thumbnail, you see just a 
few pieces of data. As with File Information mode, you see the Protect Status 
and Retouch Indicator icons if you used those features. Beneath that, you 
see the White Balance settings used for the shot. (White balance is a color 
feature you can explore in Chapter 6.) Along the bottom row of the display, 
you see the camera name along with the Frame Number/Total Pictures data, 
also part of the standard File Information display data. 
The core of this display mode, though, are those chart-like thingies, officially 
called histograms. You actually get two types of histograms: The top one is a 
Brightness histogram; the three others are collectively called an RGB (red, 
green, blue) histogram.
 
 The next two sections explain what you can discern from the histograms. But 
first, here’s a cool trick to remember: If you press the Zoom In button while in 
this display mode, you can zoom the thumbnail to a magnified view. The histo-
grams then update to reflect only the magnified area of the photo. To return to 
the regular view and once again see the whole-image histogram, press OK.
Figure 4-14: Histogram mode presents exposure and color 
information in chart-like fashion.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Reading a Brightness histogram
You can get an idea of image exposure by viewing your photo on the camera 
monitor. But if you adjust the brightness of the monitor or the ambient light 
affects the display brightness, you may not get the real story. The Brightness 
histogram provides a way to gauge exposure that’s a little more reliable.
A Brightness histogram indicates the 
distribution of shadows, highlights, and 
midtones (areas of medium brightness) 
in your image. Figure 4-15 shows you a 
sample histogram.
The horizontal axis of the histogram repre-
sents the possible picture brightness 
values — the maximum tonal range, in 
photography-speak — from the darkest 
shadows on the left to the brightest 
highlights on the right. And the vertical 
axis shows you how many pixels fall at 
a particular brightness value. A spike indi-
cates a heavy concentration of pixels. For 
example, in Figure 4-15, the histogram shows a large supply of pixels 
clustered in the range just above medium brightness, but very few in the 
deepest shadows. 
 
Keep in mind that there is no one “perfect” histogram that you should try to 
achieve. Instead, interpret the histogram with respect to the distribution of 
shadows, highlights, and midtones that comprise your subject. You wouldn’t 
expect to see lots of shadows, for example, in a photo of a polar bear walking 
on a snowy landscape. Pay attention, however, if you see a very high concen-
tration of pixels at the far right or left end of the histogram, which can indi-
cate a seriously overexposed or underexposed image, respectively. To find 
out how to resolve exposure problems, visit Chapter 5.
Understanding RGB histograms
When you view your images in RGB Histogram display mode, you see two 
histograms: the Brightness histogram, covered in the preceding section, 
and an RGB histogram. Figure 4-16 offers a sample RGB histogram for your 
consideration.
To make sense of the RGB histogram, you first need to know that digital 
images are called RGB images because they are created out of three primary 
colors of light: red, green, and blue. The RGB histogram shows you the 
brightness values for each of those primary colors.
Figure 4-15: The Brightness histogram 
indicates tonal range, from shadows on 
the left to highlights on the right.
Shadows
Highlights

96
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
By checking the brightness levels of the 
individual color components, sometimes 
referred to as color channels, you can 
assess the picture’s color saturation 
levels. If most of the pixels for one or 
more channels are clustered toward the 
right end of the histogram, colors may 
be oversaturated, which destroys detail. 
On the flip side, a heavy concentration 
of pixels at the left end of the histogram 
indicates an image that may be under-
saturated.
A savvy RGB histogram reader also can 
spot color-balance issues by looking at 
the pixel values. But frankly, color-balance 
problems are fairly easy to notice just 
by looking at the image itself on the 
camera monitor. And understanding how 
to translate the histogram data for this 
purpose requires more knowledge about 
RGB color theory than I have room to 
present in this book.
For information about manipulating color, 
see Chapter 6.
Highlight display mode
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo editing 
program is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights 
in others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest 
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include a 
variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud 
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white due to 
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
In Highlight display mode, areas that are totally white blink in the camera 
monitor. Notice the black spot over the right part of the sky in Figure 4-17. 
This area (shown here at the moment the highlights blinked off) indicates 
that all detail is lost in that area of the image. Like RGB Histogram mode, the 
Highlight mode is provided because simply viewing the image isn’t always a 
reliable way to gauge exposure. To use it, however, you must follow the 
instructions laid out in the earlier section “Viewing Picture Data” to enable 
the mode.
Figure 4-16: The RGB histogram can 
indicate problems with color saturation.
Less saturated
More saturated

97
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Along with the blinking highlight warn-
ing, Highlight display mode presents 
the standard bits of information in this 
mode: the Protect Status, Retouch 
Indicator, and File Number/Total 
Pictures values, all explained in the 
earlier section “File Information 
mode.” The label Highlights also 
appears to let you know the current 
display mode, as shown in Figure 4-17. 
 
I suggest that you check both the 
Brightness histogram offered in RGB 
Histogram display mode and the 
Highlight display, though, when you’re 
concerned about overexposure. If an image contains only a small area of 
blown highlights, the histogram may indicate a very small pixel population at 
the brightest end of the spectrum, leading you to assume that you’re okay in 
the exposure department. But if those blown highlights happen to fall in an 
important part of your image — someone’s face, for example — they can 
wreck your picture.
Shooting Data display mode
 
Before you can access this mode, you must enable it via the Display Mode 
option on the Playback menu. See the earlier section, “Viewing Picture Data,” 
for details. After turning on the option, press the Multi Selector down to shift 
from Highlights mode to Shooting Data mode.
In this mode, you can view three screens of information, which you toggle 
between by pressing the Multi Selector up and down. Figure 4-18 shows 
you the three screens, referred to in the Nikon manual as Shooting Data Page 
1, 2, and 3. 
Most of the data here won’t make any sense to you until you explore 
Chapters 5 and 6, which explain the exposure, color, and other advanced 
settings available on your camera. But I do want to call your attention to 
a couple of factoids now:
 
✓ The top-left corner of the monitor shows the Protect Status and Retouch 
Indicator icons, if you used the protect or retouch features. Otherwise, 
the area is empty. (See the earlier section “File Information Mode” for 
details about these particular features.)
 
✓ The current frame number, followed by the total number of images on 
the memory card, appears in the lower-right corner of the display.
Figure 4-17: In Highlight mode, blinking areas 
indicate blown highlights.

98
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ The Comment item, which is the final item on the third screen, contains 
a value if you use the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu. I cover 
this option in Chapter 11.
 
✓ If the ISO value on Shooting Data Page 1 (the first screen in Figure 4-18) 
appears in red, the camera is letting you know that it overrode the 
ISO Sensitivity setting that you selected in order to produce a good 
exposure. This shift occurs only if you enable automatic ISO adjustment 
for the P, S, A, and M exposure modes. See Chapter 5 for details.
 
 
Figure 4-18: You can view the camera settings used to capture the image in Shooting Data 
 
display mode.
GPS Data mode
This display mode is available only if the image you’re viewing was shot with 
the optional Nikon GPS (Global Positioning System) attached.
If you use the GPS unit, this display mode shows you the latitude, longitude, 
and altitude information recorded with the image file. You also see the date 
and time of the shot along with the standard Frame Number/Total Pictures 
numbers, the Protect Status icon, and the Retouch Indicator icon, all explained 
in the earlier section “File Information mode.” The data screen appears in the 
same fashion as in Shooting Data mode, superimposed over your image.

99
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Overview Data mode
This mode is the second of the two 
default photo-information modes. 
(Meaning, you don’t have to enable it 
via the Display Mode option on the 
Playback menu to use it.) In this mode, 
the playback screen contains a small 
image thumbnail along with scads of 
shooting data — although not quite as 
much as Shooting Data mode — plus a 
Brightness histogram. Figure 4-19 
offers a look.
The earlier section “Reading a 
Brightness histogram” tells you what 
to make of that part of the screen. Just 
above the histogram, you see the 
Protect Status and Retouch Indicator, 
while the Frame Number/Total 
Pictures data appears at the upper-right corner of the image thumbnail. For 
details on that data, see the earlier section “File Information mode.” (As 
always, the Protect status and Retouch Indicator icons appear only if you 
used those two features; otherwise, the area is empty.)
To sort out the maze of other information, the following list breaks things 
down into the five rows that appear under the image thumbnail and histo-
gram. In the accompanying figures as well as in Figure 4-19, I include all 
possible data simply for the purposes of illustration; if any of the items don’t 
appear on your screen, it simply means that the relevant feature wasn’t 
enabled when you captured the shot.
 
 ✓ Row 1: This row shows the exposure-related settings labeled in Figure 
4-20, along with the focal length of the lens you used to take the shot. 
Chapter 5 details the exposure settings; Chapter 6 introduces you to 
focal length.

Deleting Photos
You can erase pictures from a memory card when it’s in your camera in three 
ways. The next sections give you the lowdown. (Or is it the down low? I can’t 
seem to keep up.)
Deleting images one at a time
 
 The Delete button is key to erasing single images. But the process varies a 
little depending on which Playback display mode you’re using, as follows:

101
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ In single-image view, you can erase the current image by pressing the 
Delete button.
 
✓ In thumbnail view (displaying 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails), use the Multi 
Selector to highlight the picture you want to erase and then press the 
Delete button.
 
✓ In Calendar view, first highlight the date that contains the image. Then 
press the Zoom Out button to jump to the scrolling list of thumbnails, 
highlight a specific image, and press the Delete button.
After you press Delete, you see a message asking whether you really want to 
erase the picture. If you do, press the Delete button again. Or, to cancel out 
of the process, press the Playback button.
See the earlier section, “Viewing Images in Playback Mode,” for more details 
about the display modes.
 
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore 
it by using data-restoration software such as MediaRecover ($30, www.
mediarecover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also about $30, www.lexar.com). 
SanDisk also currently offers a recovery program with some of its high-
performance memory cards. But in order to have a chance, you must not take 
any more pictures or perform any other operations on your camera while the 
current memory card is in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture 
data for good and eliminate the possibility of recovering the image.
Deleting all photos
To erase all pictures, display the Playback menu and highlight Delete, as 
shown in the first image in Figure 4-23. Press OK to display the options shown 
in the second image. Highlight All and press the Multi Selector right. You 
then see a screen that asks you to verify that you want to delete all of your 
images. Select Yes and press OK.
 
 
Figure 4-23: To delete all photos, use the Delete option on the Playback menu.

If you create custom image folders, a feature I cover in Chapter 11, be aware 
that this step deletes only pictures in the folder that is currently selected via 
the Playback Folder option on the Playback menu. See the section “Viewing 
Images in Playback Mode,” earlier in this chapter, for information.
Deleting a batch of selected photos
To erase multiple photos — but not all of them — display the Playback menu, 
highlight Delete, and press OK. You see the Delete screen shown in the 
second image in Figure 4-23.
You then have two options for specifying which photos to erase:
 
 
✓ Select photos one-by-one. To go 
this route, highlight Selected and 
press the Multi Selector right to 
display a screen of thumbnails, as 
shown in Figure 4-24. Use the 
Multi Selector to place the yellow 
highlight box over the first photo 
you want to delete and then press 
the Zoom Out button, shown in 
the margin here. A little trash can 
icon, the universal symbol for 
delete, appears in the upper-right 
corner of the thumbnail, as 
shown in the figure. If you change 
your mind, press the Zoom Out 
button again to remove the 
Delete tag from the image. To 
undo deletion for all selected photos, press the Playback button.
 
 
 For a closer look at the selected image, press and hold the Zoom In 
button. When you release the button, the display returns to normal 
thumbnail view.
 
✓ Erase all photos taken on a specific date. This time, choose Select Date 
from the main Delete screen. (Refer to the right image in Figure 4-23.) 
Press the Multi Selector right to display a list of dates on which you took 
the pictures on the memory card. Highlight a date and press the Multi 
Selector right. A little check mark appears in the box next to the date, 
tagging all images taken on that day for deletion. To remove the check 
mark and save the photos from the digital dumpster, press the Multi 
Selector right again.
 
 Can’t remember what photos are associated with the selected date? 
Press the Zoom Out button to display thumbnails of all the images. You 
can then press the Zoom In button to temporarily view a selected 
thumbnail at full-size view. To return to the date list, press the Zoom 
Out button again.
Figure 4-24: Use the Zoom Out button to tag 
pictures you want to delete.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
After selecting the photos or a shooting date, press OK to start the Delete 
process. You see a confirmation screen asking permission to destroy the 
images; select Yes and press OK. The camera trashes the photos and returns 
you to the Playback menu.
 
You have one alternative way to quickly erase all images taken on a specific 
date: In the Calendar display mode, you can highlight the date in question 
and then press the Delete button instead of going through the Playback 
menu. You get the standard confirmation screen asking you whether you 
want to go forward. Press the Delete button again to dump the files.
Protecting Photos
You can safeguard pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected 
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to erase 
a picture by using either the Delete button or the Delete option on the 
Playback menu.
Deleting versus formatting: What’s the diff?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to the Format 
Memory Card command, which lives on the 
Setup menu and erases everything on your 
memory card. What’s the difference between 
erasing photos by formatting and by choosing 
Delete from the Playback menu and then 
selecting the All option?
Well, if you happen to have stored other data on 
the card, such as, say, a music file or a picture 
taken on another type of camera, you need to 
format the card to erase everything on it. You 
can’t view those files on the monitor, so you 
can’t use Delete to get rid of them.
Also keep in mind that the Delete function 
affects only the currently selected folder of 
camera images. As long as you use the default 
folder system that the camera creates for you, 
however, “currently selected folder” is the 
same as “all images.” The section “Viewing 
Images in Playback Mode,” earlier in this 
chapter, talks more about this issue; Chapter 11 
explains how to create custom folders.
One final — and important — note: Although 
using the Protect feature (explained elsewhere 
in this chapter) prevents the Delete function 
from erasing a picture, formatting erases all 
pictures, protected or not. Formatting also wipes 
out any photos you hid by using the Hide Image 
feature.

104
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pictures. 
See the nearby sidebar for more about formatting.
The picture protection feature comes in especially handy if you share a 
camera with other people. You can protect pictures so that those other 
people know that they shouldn’t delete your super-great images to make 
room on the memory card for their stupid, badly photographed ones. 
(This step isn’t foolproof, though, because anyone can remove the protected 
status from an image.)
 
Perhaps more importantly, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a read-
only file when you transfer it to your computer. Files that have that read-only 
status can’t be altered. Again, anyone with some computer savvy can remove 
the status, but this feature can keep casual users from messing around with 
your images after you’ve downloaded them to your system. Of course, you 
have to know how to remove the read-only status yourself if you plan on 
editing your photo in your photo software. (Hint: In Nikon ViewNX, you can 
do this by clicking the image thumbnail and then choosing File➪Protect 
Files➪Unprotect.)
Anyway, protecting a picture is easy: 
 
1. Display or select the picture you want to protect.
 
• In single-image view, just display the photo.
 
• In 4/9/72 thumbnail mode, use the Multi Selector as needed to 
place the yellow highlight box over the photo.
 
• In Calendar view, highlight the date that contains the image and 
then press the Zoom Out button to jump to the scrolling list of 
thumbnails. Then move the highlight box over the image.
 
 
2. Press the AE-L/AF-L button.
 
 
 See the tiny key symbol 
that appears next to the button? 
That’s your reminder that you 
use the button to lock a picture. 
After you press the button, the 
same symbol appears on the 
image display, as shown in 
Figure 4-25.
 
3. To remove protection, display or 
select the image and press the 
AE-L/AF-L button again.
Figure 4-25: Press the AE-L/AF-L button to 
prevent accidental deletion of the selected 
image.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
Exploring Live View Shooting
If you’ve used a compact, point-and-shoot digital camera, you may be used to 
composing your pictures on the camera monitor rather than by looking 
through the viewfinder. In fact, many compact cameras no longer even offer a 
viewfinder, which is a real shame, in my opinion. Why? Because when you 
use the monitor to frame the image, you must hold the camera away from 
your body, a posture that increases the likelihood of blurry images caused by 
camera shake. When you use the viewfinder, you can brace the camera 
against your face, creating a steadier shooting stance.
Due to some design complexities that I won’t bore you with, most digital SLR 
cameras do not enable you to preview shots on the monitor. Your D5000, 
however, does offer that feature, known as Live View in dSLR nomenclature. 
The D5000 also uses Live View when you record movies.
You need to know a few points about Live View as it’s provided on your 
camera:
 
✓ Manual focusing is recommended. You can autofocus, assuming that 
you’re using an AF-S type lens like the kit lens. (See Chapter 1 for more 
about that issue.) But even if your lens does offer autofocusing, manual 
focusing usually offers faster, more precise results. 
 
✓ Continuous autofocusing isn’t possible. In normal shooting, you can set 
the camera to continually adjust focus automatically up to the moment 
you fully depress the shutter button to record your picture. (See 
Chapter 6 for details.) This autofocus feature helps ensure that moving 
subjects remain sharply focused even after you initially establish focus 
by pressing the shutter button halfway.
 
 When you use autofocus in Live View mode, focus is always locked when 
you press the shutter button halfway. For still photography, you can 
always release the button and reset focus if needed, assuming that your 
subject isn’t moving so quickly that you don’t have time to do so. But 
when you use autofocusing in movie mode, you can’t adjust the focus 
point after recording begins. 
 
✓ You must be extra careful to keep the camera steady. Just as with a 
point-and-shoot camera, holding the camera out in front of you to 
capture the image can cause camera shake that can blur your image. 
But with an SLR, the risk is greater because of the added weight of the 
camera and lens. And if you use a so-called long lens — a telephoto 
or zoom lens that extends to a long focal length — the potential for 
camera shake is compounded. So for best results, mount the camera 
on a tripod when you use Live View. If you can’t use a tripod, enable 
vibration reduction (VR on Nikon lenses), if your lens is equipped with 
this feature.

106
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Using Live View for an extended period can harm your pictures 
and the camera. When you work in Live View mode, the camera’s 
innards heat up more than usual, and that extra heat can create the 
right electronic conditions for noise, a defect that gives your pictures a 
speckled look. (Chapter 5 offers more information.)
 
 Perhaps more critically, the increased temperatures can damage the 
camera itself. For that reason, Live View is automatically disabled after 
one hour of shooting — or earlier, if a critical heat level is detected. 
When the camera is 30 seconds or less from shutting down your Live 
View session, you see a little LV symbol, with a numerical value (such as 
18s) to let you know how many seconds you have to wrap things up. In 
extremely warm environments, you may not be able to use Live View 
mode for very long before the system shuts down. 
 
✓ Aiming the lens at the sun or other bright lights also can damage the 
camera. Of course, you can cause problems doing this even during 
normal shooting, but the possibilities increase when you use Live View. 
You not only can harm the camera’s internal components but also 
the monitor.
 
Live View also presents the two additional disadvantages which, in this case, 
are the same as for a point-and-shoot camera. First, any time you use the 
monitor, you put extra strain on the battery. So keep an eye on the battery 
status icon to avoid running out of juice at a critical moment. Second, 
the monitor can wash out in bright sunlight, making it difficult to compose 
outdoor shots.
This list of caveats doesn’t mean that I’m telling you not to use Live View. 
But for normal photography — that is, still shooting rather than movie 
recording — you shouldn’t envision Live View as a full-time alternative to 
using the viewfinder. Rather, think of it as a special-purpose tool that can 
help in situations where framing with the viewfinder is cumbersome. With 
the D5000, you do have the added advantage of being able to tilt the monitor, 
which enables you to compose scenes that would otherwise require the 
skills of a contortionist to compose through the viewfinder.
 
I find Live View most helpful for still-life, tabletop photography, especially in 
cases that require a lot of careful arrangement of the scene. For example, I 
have a shooting table that’s about waist high. Normally, I put my camera on a 
tripod, come up with an initial layout of the objects I want to photograph, 
set up my lights, and then check the scene through the viewfinder. Then 
there’s a period of refining the object placement, the lighting, and so on. If 
I’m shooting from a high angle, requiring the camera to be positioned above 
the table and pointing downward, I have to stand on my tiptoes or get a 
stepladder to check things out through the viewfinder between each compo-
sitional or lighting change. At lower angles, where the camera is tabletop 
height or below, I have to either bend over or kneel to look through the 
viewfinder, causing no end of later aches and pains to back and knees. 

107
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
With Live View, I can alleviate much of that bothersome routine (and pain) 
because I can usually see how things look in the monitor no matter what the 
camera position. When composing a shot when the camera is overhead, 
remember that you can tilt the monitor to a position where it’s easier to see.
With that lengthy preamble out of the way, the following section provides 
a primer in standard Live View shooting. Following that, you can find details 
about movie recording and discover a few ways to customize the Live 
View display.
Taking pictures in Live View mode
The following steps walk you through the process of Live View photography. 
For reasons explained in the preceding introduction to Live View shooting, 
manual focusing is recommended, so the steps assume that you stick with 
that focusing choice. 
 
1. Open the Custom Setting menu, select the Autofocus submenu, and set 
the Live View Autofocus option to Normal Area or Wide Area.
 
 Okay, I know I just said that these steps assume that you’re going to 
focus manually. But for reasons I won’t get into, setting the Live View 
Autofocus option to the other available choices, Face Priority or Subject 
Tracking, limits your control when you check your focus later, in Step 7. 
So select either of the other two options.
 
 
 You also can adjust the autofocus mode by using the Quick Settings 
technique. Just press the Info Edit button to display the normal Quick 
Settings screen. In Live View mode, the autofocus option takes the place 
of the normal Focus mode option on the screen; look for it near the 
middle of the column of settings on the right side of the screen. After 
highlighting the option, press OK to display the four focus settings, 
select your choice, and press OK. Finally, press the Info Edit button 
again to return to the Live View display.
 
2. Set the lens to manual focusing mode.
 
 On the kit lens, set the A/M switch on the lens to M.
 
3. If you’re not using a tripod, turn on Vibration Reduction.
 
 For the kit lens, set the VR switch on the lens to On.
 
 
4. Press the Lv button on the camera back.
 
 When the camera shifts to Live View, the scene in front of the lens 
appears on the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-26, and you no longer can 
see anything through the viewfinder.

Figure 4-26: In Live View mode, you can compose your image on the monitor.
 
 In the default Live View display mode, shown in Figure 4-26, you see a 
bunch of shooting data along with your image, as labeled in Figure 4-26. 
If your monitor doesn’t show the same data as in Figure 4-26, don’t 
worry: You can control what data is displayed by adjusting the settings 
explained in the last section of this chapter. A few notes about this 
display:
 
• Some symbols, such as those representing Exposure 
Compensation and Flash Compensation values, appear only if you 
enable those features. (Chapter 5 details these settings.)
 
• The OK symbol near the bottom center of the screen is a reminder 
that you press OK to start recording video.
 
• The symbols just under the Image Size/Quality symbols in Figure 
4-26 also relate to movie recording, explained later in this chapter.
 
• The red rectangle, labeled Focusing frame in the figure, appears as 
a result of choosing the Wide Area auto focusing option in Step 1. If 
you instead select Normal Area, you see a smaller rectangle. More 
on what you actually do with that rectangle in Step 7.

109
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
 
 Again, you can easily adjust any of these settings without exiting Live 
View mode by pressing the Info Edit button to shift to the Quick Settings 
display. (Refer to Step 1 for more details.)
 
5. Frame the shot.
 
6. Turn the lens focusing ring to set initial focus.
 
 
7. Press the Zoom In button to magnify the view and refine focus, if 
needed.
 
 
 Pressing the button zooms the display, with each press giving 
you a closer look at the shot. As when you magnify an image when 
you’re viewing photos in Playback mode, a small thumbnail in the 
corner of the monitor appears, with the yellow highlight box indicating 
the area that’s currently being magnified. To scroll the display and 
check another part of the image, press the Multi Selector to move the 
red focusing frame over the area you want to inspect. (Here’s where that 
Live View Autofocus setting selected in Step 1 becomes important: If it’s 
set to Face Priority or Subject Tracking mode, you can’t scroll the dis-
play to view specific parts of the picture.)
 
 To reduce the magnification, press the Zoom Out button. When you’re 
happy with the focus, zoom out until you return to full-frame view.
 
8. Check the exposure settings.
 
 They appear at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 4-26. If 
needed, you can adjust exposure in the P, S, and A exposure modes by 
using Exposure Compensation, explained in Chapter 5. In Manual (M) 
mode, you can adjust f-stop and shutter speed as outlined in Chapter 5. 
In the fully automatic exposure modes, you can’t adjust exposure.
 
9. Depress the shutter button fully to take the shot.
 
 You see your just-captured picture on the monitor for a few seconds, as 
usual. Then the Live View preview returns, and you’re ready to take the 
next shot.
 
 10. To exit the Live View preview, press the Lv button.
 
 You can then return to framing your images through the viewfinder.
Recording movies
Your D5000 offers the ability to record digital movies. Although recording 
live action with a D5000 involves a few limitations and difficulties that you 
don’t experience with a real video camera, it’s a fun option to have onboard 
nonetheless. 
Before I give you the specifics, here’s the broad overview of D5000 movie 
making:

110
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Movie quality: Select this option from the Movie Settings option on the 
Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 4-27. The settings determine the 
frame size and aspect ratio of the movie: 320 x 216 pixels, for a 3:2 aspect 
ratio (the same aspect ratio as your D5000 still images); 640 x 424, also a 
3:2 aspect ratio; and 1280 x 720, which gives you a 16:9 aspect ratio, 
which is found on many new TV sets and computer monitors. 
 
 The higher the pixel count, the larger you can display the movie on a TV 
or monitor before you see the quality of the playback deteriorate. But a 
higher Quality setting also produces a larger file, eating up more of your 
memory card, and reduces the maximum length of the movie you can 
record, as outlined next.
 
✓ Maximum movie length/file size: If you select the highest movie resolu-
tion (1280 x 720 pixels), your movie can have a maximum length of five 
minutes and a maximum file size of 2GB. At the two lower-resolution 
settings, you’re still restricted to 2GB file sizes, but the movies can run 
as long as 20 minutes. Of course, you must have 2GB of empty memory 
card space to store the movie.
 
✓ Frame rate: The frame rate determines the smoothness of the playback. 
At all three Quality settings, the frame rate is 24 frames per second, or 
fps. By contrast, the standard frame rate for television-quality video is 
30 frames per second, so expect your movies to play a little less 
smoothly than your favorite sitcoms.
 
✓ Sound recording: You can record sound or shoot a silent movie; make 
the call via the Movie Settings option on the Shooting menu (shown in 
Figure 4-27).
 
 If you enable sound, note the position of the microphone: It’s the little 
three-holed area above the D5000 logo, on the front of the camera. Make 
sure that you don’t inadvertently cover up the microphone with your 
finger. And keep in mind that anything you say will be picked up by the 
mike along with any other audio present in the scene.
 
 
Figure 4-27: Specify movie quality and sound recording options via the Shooting menu.

111
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback and Live View Shooting
 
✓ Video format: Movies are created in the AVI format, which means you 
can play them on your computer using most movie-playback programs. 
If you want to view your movies on a TV, you can connect the camera to 
the TV, as explained in Chapter 9. Or if you have the necessary com-
puter software, you can convert the AVI file to a format that a standard 
DVD player can recognize and then burn the converted file to a DVD 
disk. You also can edit your movie in a program that can work with 
AVI files.
So far, so good. None of the aforementioned details is terribly unusual or 
complicated. Where things get a little tricky for the would-be filmmaker are in 
the areas of focus and exposure:
 
✓ Focusing: As with regular Live View photography, you can use auto-
focusing to establish initial focus on your subject before you begin 
recording. But after recording begins, the autofocus system lays down 
and plays dead. So unless you’re recording a static subject — say, a 
guitar player sitting on a stool or a speaker at a lectern — opt for manual 
focusing. You can then adjust focus manually any time during the 
recording. 
 
 If you plan to also zoom in and out, give yourself some time to practice 
before the big event. It’s a bit of a challenge to zoom and focus at the 
same time, especially while holding the camera in front of you so that 
you can see the monitor. (A tripod makes the maneuver slightly easier.)
 
✓ Exposure: The camera automatically sets exposure based on the light 
throughout the entire scene. In the P, S, and A modes, you can apply 
Exposure Compensation, a feature covered in Chapter 5, to produce a 
darker or lighter exposure. And, in the M and A modes, you can request 
a specific f-stop, but you must do so before you begin recording. In the 
other modes, you get no exposure control.
To try out movie recording, first set your camera to manual focusing and, if 
you’re not using a tripod, turn on Vibration Reduction (or whatever form of 
image stabilization your lens offers). Then take these steps:
 
1. Set your movie preferences through the Movie Settings option on the 
Shooting menu.
 
 The first part of this section explains your options.
 
2. Press the Lv button to switch to Live View mode.
 
3. Compose your shot.

112
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
4. Set focus.
 
 You can use the techniques outlined in the preceding section to magnify 
the display to check focus if needed.
 
5. Press OK to begin recording.
 
 A red Rec symbol begins flashing at the top of the monitor. If your moni-
tor is set to the default Live View display mode, you also see the record-
ing symbols shown at the top of Figure 4-28. As recording progresses, 
the area labeled Time Remaining value shows you how many more sec-
onds of video you will be able to record. (The length is dependent on 
the movie-quality settings you choose and the amount of space on your 
memory card.) Again, see the last section of this chapter for more 
details about customizing the screen display.
 
6. To stop recording, press OK.
 
7. Press the Lv button to exit Live View mode and return to normal 
shooting.
To play your movie, press the Playback button. In single-image playback 
mode, you can spot a movie file by looking for the little movie-camera icon in 
the top-left corner of the screen, as shown on the left in Figure 4-29. Press OK 
to start playback.

After playback begins, a little playback 
control icon appears in the lower-left 
corner of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 4-30. It represents the Multi 
Selector and reminds you that you can 
use these techniques to control the 
playback:

Customizing the Live View display
Whether you are shooting movies or still photos, you can choose from 
several Live View display styles, which include:
 
✓ Show Indicators: In this mode, your screen appears as shown earlier in 
this chapter, in Figure 4-26. 
 
✓ Hide Indicators: Select this mode to hide all the indicators that are 
displayed over your image in the Show Indicators mode except the icon 
that represents your chosen exposure mode and the battery status icon.
 
✓ Framing Grid: This mode displays a grid over the image, as shown on 
the left in Figure 4-31. The grid is helpful when you need to precisely 
align objects in your photo. But note that if you zoom the display 
to check focusing, the grid disappears until you return to normal 
magnification. 
 
✓ Show Shooting Information: In this mode, the screen appears as shown 
on the right in Figure 4-31. It’s like having the Quick Settings screen data 
available to you without actually having to shift to Quick Settings mode.
(Remember that if you do want to enter Quick Settings mode, a quick 
press of the Information Edit button gets the job done.
 
 To cycle through the various displays, you just press the Info button. But 
which ones appear depend on some menu options you select through the 
Custom Settings menu. After traveling to that menu, highlight the Shooting/
Display option and press OK. Then highlight Live View Display Options, 
as shown on the left in Figure 4-32, and press OK. You then see the screen 
shown on the right in the figure. A check mark in the box next to the display 
option enables that display choice. To toggle the check mark on and off, 
highlight the box and press the Multi Selector up or down. When you’re 
finished choosing options, highlight Done and press OK. 
 
 
Figure 4-31: While in Live View mode, press the Info button to change the display mode.

If you connect your camera to an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) 
device, you no longer see the live scene on your camera monitor. Instead, the 
view is displayed on your video device. In that scenario, the arrangement of 
the shooting information on the screen may appear slightly different than in 
the examples in this chapter.

Part II
Taking Creative 
Control

In this part . . .
A
s nice as it is to be able to set your D5000 to 
automatic mode and let the camera handle 
most of the photographic decisions, I encourage 
you to take creative control and explore the 
advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, and M). In 
these modes, you can make your own decisions 
about the exposure, focus, and color characteris-
tics of your photo, which are key to capturing a 
compelling image as you see it in your mind’s eye. 
And don’t think that you have to be a genius or 
spend years to be successful — adding just a few 
simple techniques to your photographic repertoire 
can make a huge difference in  the quality of the 
pictures you take.
The ﬁ rst two chapters in this part explain every-
thing you need to know to do just that, providing 
both some necessary photography fundamentals 
as well as details about using the advanced expo-
sure modes. Following that, Chapter 7 helps you 
draw together all the information presented earlier 
in the book, summarizing the best camera settings 
and other tactics to use when capturing portraits, 
action shots, landscapes, and close-up shots. In 
short, this part helps you get the most out of your 
camera, which results in you becoming a better 
photographer.

nderstanding exposure is one of the most intimi-
dating challenges for the new photographer. 
Discussions of the topic are loaded with unfamiliar, 
techy-sounding terms — aperture, metering, shutter 
speed, ISO, and the like. Add the fact that your D5000 
offers oodles of exposure controls, all sporting 
equally foreign names, and it’s no wonder that 
most people throw up their hands and decide that 
their best option is to simply stick with the Auto 
exposure mode and let the camera take care of all 
exposure decisions.
You can, of course, turn out super shots in Auto mode. 
And I fully relate to the exposure confusion you may be 
feeling — I’ve been there. But from years of working with 
beginning photographers, I can promise that when you take 
things nice and slow, digesting just a piece of the exposure pie at a 
time, the topic is not nearly as complicated as it seems on the surface. 
And I guarantee that the payoff will be well worth your time and brain energy.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
You’ll not only gain the power to resolve just about any exposure problem, 
but also discover ways to use exposure to put your own creative stamp on 
a scene.
To that end, this chapter provides everything you need to know to really 
exploit your D5000’s exposure options, from a primer in exposure science 
(it’s not as bad as it sounds) to explanations of all the camera’s exposure 
controls. In addition, because some controls aren’t accessible in the fully 
automatic exposure modes, this chapter also introduces you to the four 
advanced modes, P, S, A, and M.
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken with a film or digital camera, is created by 
focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive recording medium. In a 
film camera, the film negative serves as that medium; in a digital camera, 
it’s the image sensor, which is an array of light-responsive computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are 
two barriers, known as the aperture 
and shutter, which together control 
how much light makes its way to 
the sensor. The actual design and 
arrangement of the aperture, shut-
ter, and sensor vary depending on 
the camera, but Figure 5-1 offers an 
illustration of the basic concept.
The aperture and shutter, along 
with a third feature known as ISO, 
determine exposure — what most of 
us would describe as the picture’s 
overall brightness and contrast. 
This three-part exposure formula 
works as follows:
 
✓ Aperture (controls amount 
of light): The aperture is an 
adjustable hole in a diaphragm set just behind the lens. By changing the 
size of the aperture, you control the size of the light beam that can enter 
the camera. Aperture settings are stated as f-stop numbers, or simply 
f-stops, and are expressed with the letter f followed by a number: f/2, 
f/5.6, f/16, and so on. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the aper-
ture, and the more light is permitted into the camera, as illustrated by 
Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-1: The aperture size and shutter speed 
determine how much light strikes the image 
sensor.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 The range of possible 
f-stops depends on your 
lens and, if you use a 
zoom lens, on the zoom 
position (focal length) 
of the lens. When you 
use the 18–55mm lens 
that Nikon bundles in 
the D5000 kit, you can 
select apertures from 
f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed 
all the way out to the 
shortest focal length, 
18mm. When you zoom 
in to the maximum focal 
length, 55mm, the aper-
ture range is f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of focal lengths.)
 
✓ Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the 
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you 
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing 
light from striking the image sensor, just as closed window shutters 
prevent sunlight from entering a room. When you press the shutter 
button, the shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the 
aperture to hit the image sensor.
 
 The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed 
and is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and 
so on. Shutter speeds on the D5000 range from 30 seconds to 1/4000 
second when you shoot without the built-in flash. If you do use the 
built-in flash, the range is more limited; see the sidebar “In sync: Flash 
timing and shutter speed,” later in this chapter, for information. 
 
 Should you want a shutter speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M) 
exposure mode also provides a feature called bulb exposure. At this 
setting, the shutter stays open indefinitely as long as you press the 
shutter button down.
 
✓ ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather 
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how 
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from 
film days, when an international standards organization rated each film 
stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 800, and so on. 
Film or digital, a higher ISO rating means greater light sensitivity, which 
means that less light is needed to produce the image, enabling you to 
use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both.
 
 On the D5000, you can select ISO settings ranging from 100 to a whop-
ping 6400. (The high and low ends of the scale are named Lo 1 and Hi 1, 
respectively.)
Figure 5-2: A lower f-stop number means a larger 
aperture, allowing more light into the camera.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Distilled down to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 
✓ Aperture and shutter speed together determine the quantity of light that 
strikes the image sensor.
 
✓ ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be 
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which 
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
You can create the same exposure with many combinations of aperture, shut-
ter speed, and ISO. You’re limited only by the aperture range allowed by the 
lens and the shutter speeds and ISO range offered by the camera.
But as I hinted in the preceding section, the settings you select impact your 
image beyond mere exposure, as follows:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field. The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects 
depth of field, which is the range of sharp focus in your image. I intro-
duce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a quick recap: With a shallow 
depth of field, your subject appears more sharply focused than faraway 
objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus zone spreads over a 
greater distance.
 
 As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo 
lingo — by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of 
field. As an example, take a look at the two images in Figure 5-3. For 
both shots, I established focus on the foreground grass. Notice that 
the background in the first image, taken at an aperture setting of 
f/5.6, appears noticeably softer than in the right example, taken at 
f/13. Aperture is just one contributor to depth of field, however; see 
Chapter 6 for the complete story.
 
✓ Shutter speed affects motion blur. At a slow shutter speed, moving 
objects appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter speed captures motion 
cleanly. Compare the tall foreground grass in the images in Figure 5-3, 
for example. A brisk wind was blowing when I took these pictures, and 
as a result, the foreground grass is captured without blur only at the 
1/160 second shutter speed used for the left image. How fast a shutter 
speed you need to freeze action depends on the speed of the subject, 
of course.

f/13, 1/60 second, ISO 400
 
Figure 5-3: Stopping down the aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop number) increases depth 
 
of field, or the zone of sharp focus.
 
 If your picture suffers from overall image blur like you see in Figure 5-4, 
where even stationary objects appear out of focus, the camera itself 
moved during the exposure, which is always a danger when you hand-
hold the camera. The slower the shutter speed, the longer the exposure 
time and the longer you have to hold the camera still to avoid the blur 
that is caused by camera shake.
 
 How slow is too slow? It depends on your physical capabilities and 
your lens — a longer, heavier lens adds to the challenge, obviously. For 
reasons that are too technical to get into, camera shake also affects your 
picture more when you shoot with a lens that has a long focal length. 
For example, you may be able to use a much slower shutter speed when 
you shoot with a lens that has a maximum focal length of 55mm, like 
the kit lens, than if you switch to a 200mm telephoto lens. (Chapter 6 
explains focal length, if the term is new to you.)

124
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 The best idea is to do your own 
tests to see where your hand-
holding limit lies. Start with a 
slow shutter speed — say, in the 
1/40 second neighborhood, and 
then click off multiple shots, 
increasing the shutter speed for 
each picture. If you have a zoom 
lens, run the test first at the mini-
mum focal length (widest angle) 
and then zoom to the maximum 
focal length for another series of 
shots. Then it’s simply a matter 
of comparing the images in your 
photo editing program. (You may 
not be able to accurately judge 
the amount of blur on the camera 
monitor.) See Chapter 8 to find 
out how to see the shutter speed 
you used for each picture when 
you view your images.
 
 Some Nikon lenses, including the 
18–55mm kit lens, offer vibration 
reduction, which is designed to 
help compensate for small 
amounts of camera shake. If 
you’re using a lens from another 
manufacturer, the feature may go by the name image stabilization or 
something similar. Whatever you call it, this option can enable you to 
capture sharp images at slightly slower shutter speeds than normal 
when handholding the camera. (Again, your mileage may vary, but most 
people can expect to go at least two or three notches down the shutter-
speed ramp.) On the D5000 kit lens, just set the VR switch on the side of 
the lens to the On position to enable vibration reduction.
 
 See Chapter 6 for tips on solving other focus problems and Chapter 7 for 
more help with action photography.
 
✓ ISO affects image noise. As ISO increases, making the image sensor 
more reactive to light, you increase the risk of producing a defect 
called noise. This defect looks like sprinkles of sand and is similar in 
appearance to film grain, a defect that often mars pictures taken with 
high ISO film. Noise can also be caused by very long exposure times.
 
 Ideally, then, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your 
camera to ensure top image quality. But sometimes, the lighting 
conditions simply don’t permit you to do so and still use the aperture 
and shutter speeds you need. Take the rose images in Figure 5-5, for 
example. Here again, a mild breeze was blowing, so I knew I needed a 
Figure 5-4: Slow shutter speeds increase the 
risk of all-over blur caused by camera shake.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
fast shutter to capture the flower without blur. I opened the aperture to 
f/6.3, which was the maximum on the lens I was using, to allow as much 
light as possible into the camera. Even so, I needed a shutter speed of 
1/40 second to expose the picture at ISO 200 — and that shutter speed 
wasn’t fast enough to catch the swaying flower without blur, as shown 
on the left in the figure. Using the lowest ISO (ISO 100, or Lo 1) would 
have made the situation that much worse. By raising the ISO to 400, I 
was able to use a shutter speed of 1/80 second, which captured a sharp 
image of the flower.
 
 Fortunately, you don’t encounter serious noise on the D5000 until you 
really crank up the ISO. In fact, you may even be able to get away with 
ISO 3200 if you keep your print or display size small. But as with other 
image defects, noise becomes more apparent as you enlarge the photo. 
Noise is also easier to spot in shadow areas of your picture and in large 
areas of solid color, like the sky in the marina scene you see in Figure 
5-6. To give you an idea of how ISO affects noise, Figure 5-7 shows you 
magnified views of a bit of the marina scene captured at several ISO 
settings, from ISO 200 to 3200. 
Long story short, understanding how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect 
your image enables you to have much more creative input over the look 
of your photographs — and, in the case of ISO, to also control the quality of 
your images. (Chapter 3 discusses other factors that affect image quality.)

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Doing the exposure balancing act
 
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed, 
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain the 
same image brightness. Say that you’re shooting a soccer game, for example, 
and you notice that although the overall exposure looks great, the players 
are appearing slightly blurry at your current shutter speed. If you raise the 
shutter speed, you have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow 
in more light during the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make 
the camera more sensitive to the light — or both.
As the preceding section explains, changing these settings impacts your 
image in ways beyond exposure. As a quick reminder:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field, with a higher f-stop number producing a 
greater zone of sharp focus.
 
✓ Shutter speed affects whether motion of the subject or camera results 
in a blurry photo. A faster shutter “freezes” action and also helps 
safeguard against allover blur that can result from camera shake when 
you’re handholding the camera.
 
✓ ISO affects the camera’s sensitivity to light. A higher ISO makes the 
camera more responsive to light but also increases the chance of 
image noise.
Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between 
f-stop and depth of field, or the range of dis-
tance over which objects remain in sharp focus, 
is simply to think of the f as standing for focus. A 
higher f-stop number produces a larger depth of 
field, so if you want to extend the zone of sharp 
focus to cover a greater distance from your 
subject, you set the aperture to a higher f-stop. 
Higher f-stop number, greater zone of sharp 
focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography 
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you 
that the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand 
for focus but for the ratio between the aperture 
size and lens focal length — as if that’s 
helpful to know if you’re not an optical engineer. 
(Chapter 6 explains focal length, which is 
helpful to know.)
As for the fact that you increase the f-stop 
number when you want a smaller aperture, well, 
I’m still working on the ideal mnemonic tip for 
that one. But try this in the meantime: Lower 
f-stop, larger aperture. Or maybe the opposite: 
Raise the f-stop to reduce the aperture size and 
restrict the light. (As I said, I’m working on it.)

128
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
So when you boost that shutter speed to capture your soccer subjects, 
you have to decide whether you prefer the shorter depth of field that comes 
with a larger aperture or the increased risk of noise that accompanies a 
higher ISO.
Everyone has their own approach to finding the right combination of aper-
ture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your own system as 
you become more practiced at using the advanced exposure modes. In the 
meantime, here’s how I handle things:
 
✓ I always use the lowest possible ISO setting unless the lighting condi-
tions are so poor that I can’t use the aperture and shutter speed I want 
without raising the ISO.
 
✓ If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler or 
antsy pet), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my exposure 
decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free photo 
or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur that 
moving object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of motion. 
(The waterfall photo in Chapter 7 offers an example of the latter 
technique.)
 
✓ For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over 
shutter speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have 
in mind. For portraits, for example, I use the largest aperture (the lowest 
f-stop number, known as shooting wide open, in photographer speak) so 
that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft background for my 
subject. For landscapes, I go the opposite direction, stopping down the 
aperture as much as possible to capture the subject at the greatest 
depth of field.
I know that keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the 
more you work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation 
will make sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for 
specific types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for 
details on how to actually monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and 
ISO settings on the D5000.
Exploring the Advanced Exposure Modes
 
You can control one critical aspect of exposure, ISO, in the fully automatic 
exposure modes. But if you want access to all options, you need to set the 
Mode dial to one of the advanced modes highlighted in Figure 5-8: P, S, A, or 
M. You also need to shoot in these modes to use certain other features, such 
as manual white balancing, a color control that you can explore in Chapter 6.

129
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Each of the four modes offers a 
different way to control aperture and 
shutter speed:
 
✓ P (programmed autoexposure): In 
this mode, the camera selects both 
aperture and shutter speed. But 
you can choose from different 
combinations of the two, which 
gives you creative flexibility not 
possible in the fully automatic 
exposure modes discussed in 
Chapter 2. 
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): 
In this mode, you select a shutter 
speed, and the camera chooses the 
aperture setting that produces a 
good exposure at your selected 
ISO setting.
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoex-
posure): The opposite of shutter-priority autoexposure, this mode asks 
you to select the aperture setting. The camera then selects the appropri-
ate shutter speed to properly expose the picture.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and 
aperture. 
 
To sum up, the first three modes are semi-automatic exposure modes that 
are designed to help you get a good exposure while still providing you with 
some photographic flexibility. Note one important point about the semi-auto 
modes, however: In extreme lighting conditions, the camera may not be able 
to select settings that will produce a good exposure. (The camera will warn 
you about the potential problem but doesn’t prevent you from capturing the 
shot.) Manual mode puts all exposure control in your hands. But even in 
Manual mode, you’re never really flying without a net — the camera assists 
you by displaying the exposure meter, explained next.
Reading the Meter
To help you determine whether your exposure settings are on cue in M 
(manual) exposure mode, the camera displays an exposure meter in the 
viewfinder and Shooting Information display. The meter is a little linear 
Figure 5-8: You can control exposure and 
certain other picture properties fully only in 
P, S, A, or M mode.

graphic that indicates whether your 
current settings will properly expose 
the image. Figure 5-9 shows the expo-
sure meter as viewed in the Shooting 
Information display. In the viewfinder, 
the meter appears to the right of 
the f-stop and looks similar to the 
examples shown in Figure 5-10.
The minus-sign end of the meter rep-
resents underexposure; the plus sign, 
overexposure. So if the little notches 
on the meter fall to the right of 0, as 
shown in the first example in Figure 
5-10, the image will be underexposed. 
If the indicator moves to the left of 0, as shown in the second example, the 
image will be overexposed. The farther the indicator moves toward the plus 
or minus sign, the greater the potential problem. When the meter shows a 
balanced exposure, as in the third example, you’re good to go.
 
Underexposure
Overexposure
Good exposure
 
Figure 5-10: The exposure meter indicates whether your exposure settings are on target.
 
In the other exposure modes, the meter appears in the viewfinder and 
Shooting Information screen if the camera anticipates an exposure problem. 
The word Lo at the end of the meter tells you that the photo may be seriously 
underexposed; the Word Hi indicates severe overexposure. In dim lighting, 
you may also see a blinking flash symbol. It’s a not-so-subtle suggestion to 
add some light to the scene. A blinking question mark tells you that you can 
press the Zoom Out button to display a Help screen with more information.
If you’re so inclined, you can customize the meter in the following ways:
 
✓ Adjust the meter shutoff timing. The meter turns off automatically if 
you don’t press the shutter button for a period of time — 8 seconds, 
by default. You can adjust the shut-off timing if you like, however. First, 
display the Custom Setting menu, highlight Timers/AE Lock, and press 
OK. Highlight Auto Off Timers, as shown on the left in Figure 5-11, and 
Figure 5-9: You can view the exposure meter 
in the Shooting Information display.

131
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
press OK. Highlight Custom, as shown on the right in Figure 5-11, and 
press OK. On the next screen, shown on the left in Figure 5-12, highlight 
Auto Meter-Off and press OK. Now you can adjust the timing of the 
meter without also affecting the timing of the image-review and play-
back/menu displays. Highlight your choice from the options shown 
on the right in Figure 5-12 and press OK again. Finally — and this is a 
critical last step — highlight Done and press OK. Keep in mind that 
shorter delay times conserve battery power.
 
✓ Reverse the meter orientation. You can flip the meter so that the posi-
tive (overexposure) side appears on the right and the negative (underex-
posure) side falls on the left. This option also lies on the Custom Setting 
menu, but this time you need to visit the Controls submenu. Highlight 
the Reverse Indicators submenu of the Controls submenu, as shown in 
Figure 5-13, and press OK. Choose the desired option and press OK.

Figure 5-12: Choose the desired time from the available options and then choose Done to

132
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Keep in mind that the meter’s 
suggestion on exposure may not 
always be the one you want to follow. 
For example, you may want to shoot a 
backlit subject in silhouette, in which 
case you want that subject to be 
underexposed. In other words, the 
meter is a guide, not a dictator. In 
addition, remember that the exposure 
information the meter reports is 
based on the exposure metering mode, 
which determines which part of the 
frame the camera considers when 
calculating exposure. At the default 
setting, exposure is based on the 
entire frame, but you can select two other metering modes. See the upcoming 
section “Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode” for details.
Setting ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed
The next sections detail how to view and adjust these three critical exposure 
settings. Remember, you can adjust ISO in any exposure mode, but to control 
aperture (f-stop) or shutter speed, you must switch to one of the four 
advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, or M).
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
You can view the current aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed in the view-
finder and Shooting Information display, as shown in Figure 5-14. (Press the 
Info button to display the Shooting Information screen.) 
 
In the viewfinder, shutter speeds are presented as whole numbers, even if 
the shutter speed is set to a fraction of a second. For example, the number 
125 indicates a shutter speed of 1/125 second. When the shutter speed slows 
to 1 second or more, quote marks appear after the number — 1” indicates a 
shutter speed of 1 second, 4” means 4 seconds, and so on.
To select aperture and shutter speed, start by pressing the shutter button 
halfway to kick the exposure system into gear. You can then release the 
button if you want. The next step depends on the exposure mode, as follows: 
Figure 5-13: You can reverse the meter 
orientation from this menu option.

Figure 5-14: Look for the current f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings here.
 
✓ P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera shows you its recom-
mended f-stop and shutter speed when you press the shutter button 
halfway. But you can rotate the Command dial to select a different 
combination of settings. The number of possible combinations depends 
upon the aperture settings the camera can select, which in turn depend 
on the lighting conditions and your lens.
 
 An asterisk (*) appears next to the P exposure mode symbol in the 
upper-left corner of the Shooting Information display after you rotate 
the Command dial to indicate that you adjusted the aperture/shutter 
speed settings from those the camera initially suggested. You see a P* 
symbol at the end of the viewfinder display as well. To get back to the 
initial combo of shutter speed and aperture, rotate the Command dial 
until the asterisk disappears from the Shooting Information display and 
the P* turns off in the viewfinder.
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you select the shutter 
speed. Just rotate the Command dial to get the job done.
 
 As you change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the 
aperture as needed to maintain what it considers the proper exposure. 
Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even 
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the 
f-stop, too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in 
extreme lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the 
aperture enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter 
speed — again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So 
you may need to compromise on shutter speed (or in dim lighting, raise 
the ISO).

134
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you control aperture, 
and the camera adjusts shutter speed automatically. To set the aperture 
(f-stop), rotate the Command dial.
 
 When you stop down the aperture (raise the f-stop value), be careful 
that the shutter speed doesn’t drop so low that you run the risk of 
camera shake if you handhold the camera — unless you have a tripod 
handy, of course. And if your scene contains moving objects, make sure 
that when you dial in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that the 
camera selects is fast enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur it, if 
that’s your creative goal). These same warnings apply when you use P 
mode, by the way.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and 
shutter speed, like so:
 
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the Command dial. 
 
 
• To adjust aperture: Press the Exposure Compensation button 
while simultaneously rotating the Command dial. Notice the little 
aperture-like symbol that lies next to the button, on the top of the 
camera? That’s your reminder of the button’s role in setting the 
f-stop in Manual mode.
 
Keep in mind that when you use P, S, or A modes, the settings that the 
camera selects are based on what it thinks is the proper exposure. If you 
don’t agree with the camera, you have two options: You can switch to manual 
exposure mode and simply dial in the aperture and shutter speed that deliver 
the exposure you want; or if you want to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can 
tweak exposure using the Exposure Compensation feature, explained later in 
this chapter.
Controlling ISO
The ISO setting, introduced at the start of this chapter, adjusts the camera’s 
sensitivity to light. At a higher ISO, you can use a faster shutter speed or 
a smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) because less light is needed to 
expose the image.
You can adjust ISO in any exposure mode. Moreover, you can specify 
whether you want to display the ISO value in the viewfinder. To make that 
call, open the Custom Setting menu, navigate to the Shooting/Display 
submenu, highlight ISO Display (as shown on the left in Figure 5-15), and 
press OK to display the options shown on the right in Figure 5-15.
Here are your choices:

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Off: This mode is the default setting. With this setup, you see an ISO 
readout in the viewfinder only when the ISO setting is set to Auto, an 
option you can read about a little later in this chapter. If you shift to a 
manual ISO control, you must refer to the Shooting Information display 
to see the setting. 
 
✓ On: If you choose this option, the ISO value replaces the frames-
remaining value in the viewfinder. After enabling this option, you must 
visit the Shooting Information screen to see the frames-remaining value.
Whichever display option you choose, you can quickly adjust the ISO setting 
through the Quick Settings screen. Highlight the current ISO setting as shown 
on the left in Figure 5-16 and press OK to display the options shown on the 
right. Choose the desired ISO setting and press OK. If you find that you’re 
changing ISO settings frequently, you may want to consider changing the 
Function (Fn) button option to ISO Sensitivity as outlined in Chapter 11.
 
 
Figure 5-15: You can choose from two options for displaying ISO. 
 
 
Figure 5-16: You can adjust ISO easily through the Quick Settings Screen.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
You also can select the ISO setting through the Shooting menu. Highlight ISO 
Sensitivity Settings, as shown on the left in Figure 5-17, and press OK to 
display the right screen in the figure. Highlight ISO Sensitivity and press OK. 
Highlight the setting you want to use and press OK again. Note that the second 
screen in the figure shows options available only in the P, S, A, and M modes.
Keep the following factoids in mind about the ISO settings themselves: 
 
✓ Auto ISO in Auto and Digital Vari-Program modes: In these exposure 
modes, the list of ISO settings includes Auto ISO. Select this option if you 
want the camera to take the ISO reins entirely.
 
✓ Auto ISO in advanced exposure modes: In the advanced exposure 
modes (P, S, A, and M), Auto ISO doesn’t appear on the ISO settings list. 
However, you still can enable Auto ISO as sort of a safety net. Here’s 
how it works: You dial in a specific ISO setting — say, ISO 200. If the 
camera decides that it can’t properly expose the image at that ISO given 
your current aperture and shutter speed, it automatically adjusts ISO as 
necessary.
Dampening noise
Noise, the digital defect that gives your pictures 
a speckled look (refer to Figure 5-7), can occur 
for two reasons: a high ISO speed and a long 
exposure time.
The D5000 offers two noise-removal filters: High 
ISO Noise Reduction, designed to help eradi-
cate ISO-related noise, and Long Exposure 
Noise Reduction, designed to dampen the type 
of noise that occurs during long exposures. You 
can enable both filters through the Shooting 
menu. Look for the options named Long Exp. NR 
and High ISO NR.
If you turn on Long Exposure Noise Reduction, 
the camera applies the filter to any pictures 
taken at shutter speeds of longer than 8 sec-
onds. For High ISO Noise Reduction, choosing 
High, Normal, or Low applies the filter at ISO 
settings of 800 or higher; the setting you choose 
determines the strength of the filter. If you 
choose Off, the camera actually still applies a 
tiny amount of noise removal, but only when you 
shift into the Hi ISO settings (Hi 0.3 or greater).
Before you enable noise reduction, be aware 
that doing so has a few disadvantages. First, the 
filters are applied after you take the picture, as 
the camera processes the image data. (While 
the Long Exposure Noise Reduction filter is 
being applied, the message “Job nr” appears in 
the viewfinder, in the area normally reserved for 
the shutter speed and aperture.) The time 
needed to apply the filter can slow down your 
shooting speed.
Second, noise-reduction filters work primarily 
by applying a slight blur to the image. Don’t 
expect this process to totally eliminate noise, 
and do expect some resulting image softness. 
You may be able to get better results by using 
the blur tools or noise-removal filters found in 
many photo editors, because you can blur just 
the parts of the image where noise is most 
noticeable — usually in areas of flat color or 
little detail, such as skies.

137
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 
Figure 5-17: You can also set ISO and access additional ISO options through the Shooting menu.
 
 To get to this option, first select ISO Sensitivity Settings on the Shooting 
menu, as shown on the left in Figure 5-17. Then press OK to display the 
screen shown on the right. This screen displays the current ISO setting, 
which can be changed by highlighting it, pressing OK, and then choosing 
the desired setting from the next menu. To enable Auto ISO, highlight 
ISO Sensitivity Auto Control, as shown in the figure, and press OK. 
Highlight On from the next screen and press OK. The camera will now 
override your ISO choice when it thinks a proper exposure is not 
possible with the settings you’ve specified. 
 
 Next, use the Maximum Sensitivity and Minimum Shutter Speed options, 
also shown in Figure 5-17, to tell the camera exactly when it should 
step in and offer ISO assistance. With the first option, you specify the 
highest ISO setting the camera may select when it does override your 
ISO decision. The second option sets the minimum shutter speed at 
which the ISO override engages. For example, you can specify that 
you want the camera to amp up ISO if the shutter speed drops to 1/40 
second or below. This second option only affects shots you take in the 
P and A exposure modes, however.
 
 If the camera is about to override your ISO setting, it alerts you by 
blinking the ISO Auto label in the viewfinder. The message “ISO-A” blinks 
in the top-right corner of the Shooting Information screen as well. And in 
Playback mode, the ISO value appears in red if you view your photos in 
the Shooting Information display mode. (Chapter 4 has details.)
 
 To disable Auto ISO override, just reset the ISO Sensitivity Auto Control 
to Off.
 
✓ Hi/Lo settings: The specific ISO values presented to you range from 200 
to 3200. But if you scroll past those settings, you discover three more 
settings in each direction: Hi 0.3, Hi 0.7, and Hi 1.0; and Lo 0.3, Lo 0.7, 
and Lo 1.0. These settings, in order, translate to ISO values of about 160, 
125, and 100 at the low end and 4000, 5000, and 6400 at the high end. 

138
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Choosing ISO 3200 pretty much ensures a noisy image (refer to Figure 5-7), 
and shifting into the Hi settings just makes things worse. If cranking up ISO 
is the only way to capture the image, and you’d rather have a noisy picture 
than no picture, go for it. Otherwise, adjust shutter speed and aperture 
to get the exposure you want instead. You can always mount the camera 
on a tripod if the shutter speed is too slow for using the camera handheld, 
although you should keep in mind that a long exposure time also can 
produce added noise.
Also check out the earlier sidebar “Dampening noise” for features that may 
help calm noise somewhat.
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
 
To fully interpret what your exposure meter tells you, you need to know 
which metering mode is active. The metering mode determines which part 
of the frame the camera analyzes to calculate the proper exposure. The 
metering mode affects the exposure-meter reading as well as the exposure 
settings that the camera chooses in the fully automatic shooting modes 
(Auto, Portrait, and so on) as well as in the semi-auto modes (P, S, and A).
Your D5000 offers three metering modes, described in the following list and 
represented on the Shooting Information display by the icons you see in the 
margins:
 
 
✓ Matrix: The camera analyzes the 
entire frame and then selects an 
exposure that’s designed to pro-
duce a balanced exposure.
 
 Your camera manual refers to 
this mode as 3D Color Matrix II, 
which is simply the label that 
Nikon created to describe the 
specific technology used in 
this mode.
 
 
✓ Center-weighted: The camera 
bases exposure on the entire 
frame but puts extra emphasis — 
or weight — on the center of the 
frame. When you choose this 
metering option, the area that’s 
given priority in this mode is 
about 8mm in diameter, which is 
represented by the circle in the viewfinder, labeled in Figure 5-18. 
Figure 5-18: In center-weighted metering, the 
camera gives priority to objects that fall 
under the circle.
Center-weighted metering cirlce

139
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 
✓ Spot: In this mode, the camera bases exposure entirely on a circular 
area that’s about 3.5mm in diameter. The exact location used for 
this pin-point metering depends on an autofocusing option called the 
AF-area mode. Detailed in Chapter 6, this option determines which of 
the camera’s 11 focus points the autofocusing system uses to establish 
focus. Here’s how the setting affects exposure: 
 
• If you choose the Auto-area mode, in which the camera chooses 
the focus point for you, exposure is based on the center focus 
point. 
 
• If you use any of the other AF-area modes, which enable you 
to select a specific focus point, the camera bases exposure on 
that point.
 
 Because of this autofocus/autoexposure relationship, it’s best to switch 
to one of the AF-area modes that allow focus-point selection when you 
want to use spot metering. In the Auto-area mode, exposure may be 
incorrect if you compose your shot so that the subject isn’t at the center 
of the frame.
As an example of how metering mode affects exposure, Figure 5-19 shows 
the same image captured at each mode. In the Matrix example, the bright 
background caused the camera to select an exposure that left the statue 
quite dark. Switching to center-weighted metering helped somewhat, but 
didn’t quite bring the statue out of the shadows. Spot metering produced 
the best result as far as the statue goes, although the resulting increase in 
exposure left the sky a little washed out.

140
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 You don’t have a choice of metering modes in Auto mode or any of the Digital 
Vari-Program scene modes; the camera automatically uses matrix mode for 
all shots. But in P, A, S, or M modes, you can specify which metering mode 
you prefer. When the Shooting Information screen is displayed, press the 
Information Edit button and use the Multi Selector to navigate to the 
Metering mode icon, as shown on the left in Figure 5-20. Click OK to display 
the second screen in the figure, select the desired mode, and press OK to 
make the change.
 
The metering mode you choose stays in effect when shooting in P, S, A, and 
M modes, even when you turn the camera off. Remember to change the 
metering mode when taking a picture under different lighting conditions.
 
 
Figure 5-20: You can change the metering mode for difficult lighting conditions.
 
In theory, the best practice is to check the metering mode before you shoot 
and choose the one that best matches your exposure goals. But in practice, 
that’s a bit of a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one more 
capture setting but in terms of having to remember to adjust one more cap-
ture setting. So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the 
other controls on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which is 
matrix metering. That mode produces good results in most situations, and, 
after all, you can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how the 
camera metered or exposed the image and simply reshoot after adjusting the 
exposure settings to your liking. This option, in my mind, makes the whole 
metering mode issue a lot less critical than it is when you shoot with film.
The one exception to this advice might be when you’re shooting a series of 
images in which a significant contrast in lighting exists between subject and 
background, as in my examples here. Then, switching to center-weighted 
metering or spot metering may save you the time of having to adjust the 
exposure for each image. You may also want to investigate the section 

141
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
“Expanding Tonal Range with Active D-Lighting,” which tells you about a 
camera feature that can help you record brighter shadows without losing 
highlights.
Applying Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, S, or A modes, you can enjoy autoexpo-
sure support but still retain some control over the final exposure. If you think 
that the image the camera produced is too dark or too light, you can use a 
feature known as Exposure Compensation.
This feature enables you to tell the camera to produce a darker or lighter 
exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks is appropriate. Best 
of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the whole camera to 
understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 
✓ Exposure compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in 
+2.0 EV. Possible values range from +5.0 EV to –5.0 EV. (The EV stands 
for exposure value.)
 
 Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one 
stop. In plain English, that means that if you change the exposure 
compensation setting from EV 0.0 to EV –1.0, the resulting exposure is 
equivalent to adjusting the aperture or shutter speed to allow half as 
much light into the camera as at the current setting. If you instead raise 
the value to EV +1.0, the exposure is equivalent to adjusting the settings 
to allow twice the light.
 
✓ A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment.
 
✓ For a brighter image, raise the EV value. The higher you go, the brighter 
the image becomes.
 
✓ For a darker image, lower the EV value.
As an example, take a look at the first image in Figure 5-21. The initial expo-
sure selected by the camera left the balloon a tad too dark for my taste. So I 
just amped the Exposure Compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced 
the brighter exposure on the right.
 
 You can view the current Exposure Compensation setting in the Shooting 
Information screen (look for it in the area highlighted at the bottom of 
the screen in Figure 5-22). To change the setting, hold down the Exposure 
Compensation button, found near the shutter button. The Shooting 
Information display then appears as shown in Figure 5-22. If you’re looking 
through the viewfinder, the frames-remaining value is temporarily replaced 
by the Exposure Compensation value when you press the Exposure 
Compensation button.

While holding the Exposure 
Compensation button, rotate the 
Command dial to adjust the EV value. 
Notice that as you change the setting, 
the exposure meter in the viewfinder 
and Shooting Information display will 
update to show you the degree of 
adjustment you’re making, as shown 
in Figure 5-22.
After you release the button, the 
Shooting Information screen goes 
back to normal, and the frames-
remaining value returns to the 
viewfinder.

button to display this screen; then rotate the

143
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
Your Exposure Compensation setting remains in force until you change it, 
even if you power off the camera. So you may want to make a habit of 
checking the setting before each shoot or always setting the value back to 
EV 0.0 after taking the last shot for which you want to apply compensation.
Here are a few other tips about Exposure Compensation:
 
✓ How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request 
through your Exposure Compensation setting depends on the exposure 
mode:
 
• In A (aperture-priority autoexposure) mode, the camera adjusts 
the shutter speed but leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be 
sure to check the resulting shutter speed to make sure that it 
isn’t so slow that camera shake or blur from moving objects is 
problematic.
 
• In S (shutter-priority autoexposure) mode, the opposite occurs: 
The camera opens or stops down the aperture, leaving your 
selected shutter speed alone. 
 
• In P (programmed autoexposure) mode, the camera decides 
whether to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both.
 
• In all three modes, the camera may also adjust ISO if you have 
Auto ISO enabled.
 
 Keep in mind that the camera can adjust f-stop only so much, according 
to the aperture range of your lens. And the range of shutter speeds, 
too, is limited by the camera itself. So if you reach the ends of those 
ranges, you either have to compromise on shutter speed or aperture 
or adjust ISO.
 
✓ By default, Exposure Compen-
sation settings are provided in 
increments of one-third of a stop. 
For example, you can shift from 
EV 0.0 to 0.3, 0.7. 1.0, and so on. If 
you want a more pronounced 
result from each step up or down 
the EV ladder, you can set the 
mechanism to increments of one-
half stop instead. Then the set-
tings become EV 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 
and so on. Make the adjustment 
via the EV Steps for Exposure 
Control option on the Exposure 
submenu of the Custom Setting 
menu, shown in Figure 5-23.
Figure 5-23: You can set the Exposure 
Compensation option to adjust exposure in 
one-half stops rather than one-third stops if 
you prefer. 

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Finally, if you don’t want to fiddle with Exposure Compensation, just 
switch to Manual exposure mode — M, on the Mode dial — and select 
whatever aperture and shutter speed settings produce the exposure 
you’re after. Exposure Compensation has no effect on manual expo-
sures; again, that adjustment is made only in the P, S, and A modes.
Using Autoexposure Lock
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light 
in a scene until the moment you depress the shutter button fully and capture 
the image. In autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps 
adjusting exposure settings as needed to maintain a good exposure.
For example, say that you set your camera to shutter-priority autoexposure 
(S) mode and set the shutter speed to 1/125 second. The camera immediately 
reports the f-stop that it considers appropriate to expose the scene at that 
shutter speed. But if the light in the scene changes or you reframe your shot 
before snapping the picture, the camera may shift the f-stop automatically to 
make sure that the exposure remains correct.
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right settings 
for the light that’s striking your subject at the moment you capture the image. 
But on occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination of exposure 
settings. For example, perhaps you want to appear at the far edge of the 
frame. If you were to use the normal shooting technique, you would place the 
subject under a focus point, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus 
and set the initial exposure, and then reframe to your desired composition to 
take the shot. The problem is that the exposure is then recalculated based on 
the new framing, which can leave your subject under- or overexposed.
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual) expo-
sure mode and use the f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings that work best 
for your subject. But if you prefer to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can press 
the AE-L/AF-L button to lock exposure and focus simultaneously. Here’s the 
technique I recommend:
 
1. Set the metering mode to spot metering.
 
 See the section “Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode,” earlier in this 
chapter, if you need help changing the metering mode.
 
2. Set the AF-area mode option to the Single Point setting and then use 
the Multi Selector to select your desired focus point.
 
 This step tells the camera which part of the frame you want to use for 
establishing focus and, if you use spot metering, also determines which part 
of the frame the camera uses to calculate exposure. (You sometimes need 
to press the shutter button halfway and release it before you can do so.)

145
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 The fastest way to select the AF-area mode is through the Quick Settings 
display; see Chapter 6 for details. After you select the Single Point 
option, you can use the Multi Selector to choose a focusing point. 
 
 
3. Frame your shot so that the subject appears under the selected focus 
point and then press the shutter button halfway to set focus.
 
 You can then release the shutter button if you want.
 
4. Press and hold the AE-L/AF-L button.
 
 The button’s just to the right of the viewfinder.
 
 While the button is pressed, the letters AE-L appear at the left end of the 
viewfinder to remind you that exposure lock is applied. 
 
5. Reframe the shot if desired and take the photo.
 
 Be sure to keep holding the AE-L/AF-L button until you release the 
shutter button! 
By default, this step locks both exposure and focus for as long as you press 
the button, even if you release the shutter button. (AE-L stands for autoexpo-
sure lock; AF-L, for autofocus lock.) But if you dig into the Custom Setting 
menu, you can change the button’s function. You can set the button to lock 
only exposure, for example, or only focus, instead of locking both as it does 
by default. Chapter 11 offers details.
One more tidbit: You can also use Autoexposure Lock in the Digital Vari-
Program and Autoexposure modes. However, because those modes use 
matrix metering, this technique usually doesn’t work well in those modes.
Expanding Tonal Range with Active D-Lighting
A scene like the one in Figure 5-24 presents the classic photographer’s 
challenge: Choosing exposure settings that capture the darkest parts of the 
subject appropriately causes the brightest areas to be overexposed. And if 
you instead “expose for the highlights” — that is, set the exposure settings to 
capture the brightest regions properly — the darker areas are underexposed.
In the past, you had to choose between favoring the highlights or the 
shadows. But thanks to a feature that Nikon calls Active D-Lighting, you 
have a better chance of keeping your highlights intact while better exposing 
the darkest areas. In my seal scene, turning on Active D-Lighting produced 
a brighter rendition of the darkest parts of the rocks and the seals, for 
example, and yet the color in the sky didn’t get blown out as it did when I 
captured the image with Active D-Lighting turned off. The highlights in the 
seal and in the rocks on the lower-right corner of the image also are toned 
down a tad in the Active D-Lighting version.

146
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Active D-Lighting Off
Automatic Active D-Lighting On
 
Figure 5-24: Active D-Lighting enabled me to capture the shadows without blowing out 
 
the highlights.
 
Active D-Lighting actually does its thing in two stages. First, it selects expo-
sure settings that result in a slightly darker exposure than normal. This half 
of the equation guarantees that you retain details in your highlights. Without 
that adjustment, the brightest areas of the image might be overexposed, 
leaving you with a batch of all-white pixels that really should contain a range 
of tones from light to lighter to white. So a cloud, for example, would appear 
as a big white blob, with no subtle tonal details to give it form. After you 
snap the photo, the second part of the process occurs. During this phase, the 
camera applies an internal software filter to brighten only the darkest areas 
of the image. This adjustment rescues shadow detail, so that you wind up 
with a range of dark tones instead of a big black blob.
You can turn Active D-Lighting on and off in two ways: 
 
✓ Select Active D-Lighting from the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in 
Figure 5-25. Press OK to display the second screen in the figure, where 
you can specify the amount of Active D-Lighting adjustment. At the Auto 
setting, the camera determines how much adjustment is needed. If you 
prefer to take control, you can select from one of the other four settings 

147
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
(Extra High, High, Normal, and Low). Press OK to enable the adjustment 
for your next shot.
 
 
✓ After displaying the Shooting Information screen, press the Information 
Edit button to shift to Quick Settings mode. Then use the Multi Selector 
to highlight the Active D-Lighting option, as shown on the left in Figure 
5-26. Press OK to get to the screen shown on the right in the figure, 
where you can select the amount of Active-D-Lighting you want to apply. 
Highlight your choice and press OK.
 
If you’re not sure how much adjustment to apply, try out the Active 
D-Lighting bracketing feature. With this option, you take one shot without 
Active D-Lighting and another shot with the current Active D-Lighting setting. 
You then can decide which image you prefer. See the last section in this 
chapter for details about bracketing with the D5000.
 
 
Figure 5-25: At the Auto setting, the camera automatically applies the amount of Active 
 
D-Lighting adjustment as it sees fit.
 
 
Figure 5-26: You can change the Active D-Lighting setting easily via the Quick Settings screen.

148
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If you decide you’re better off not using the feature, just set the option to Off 
via the Shooting menu or Quick Settings display.
Remember, too, that the camera’s Retouch menu offers a D-Lighting filter that 
applies a similar adjustment to existing pictures. (See Chapter 10 for help.) 
Some photo editing programs, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements and 
Photoshop, also have good shadow and highlight recovery filters. In either 
case, when you shoot with Active D-Lighting disabled, you’re better off 
setting the initial exposure settings to record the highlights as you want 
them. It’s very difficult to bring back lost highlight detail after the fact, but 
you typically can unearth at least a little bit of detail from the darkest areas 
of the image.
Using Flash in P, S, A, and M modes
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO 
produces a bright enough exposure — in which case, you simply have to 
add more light. The built-in flash on your D5000 offers the most convenient 
solution.
 
When you shoot in the advanced exposure modes, you have much more 
control over your flash than when you use the fully automatic modes covered 
in Chapter 2. First, you gain access to flash modes not available in the full-
auto modes. Even better, you can adjust the strength of the flash by using a 
feature called Flash Compensation.
The rest of this chapter explains how to use these flash functions and also 
offers some tips on getting better results in your flash pictures. Be sure to 
also visit Chapter 7, where you can find additional flash and lighting tips 
related to specific types of photographs.
Setting the flash mode
 
 To raise the built-in flash in P, S, A, and M exposure modes, press the Flash 
button on the front-left side of the camera. You then can view the current 
flash mode in the Shooting Information display, as labeled in Figure 5-27. 
In the viewfinder, you see a simple lightning-bolt icon when flash is enabled. 
To change the flash mode, hold the Flash button down as you rotate the 
Command dial. Alternatively, you can set the flash mode through the Quick 
Settings screen. After highlighting the Flash mode icon, press OK to access 
the available settings, as shown on the right in Figure 5-27. Highlight the 
desired mode and press OK.

149
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 
Figure 5-27: You can verify the flash mode in the Shooting Information display.
Your flash mode choices break down into three basic categories, described 
in the next sections: fill flash; red-eye reduction flash; and the sync modes, 
slow-sync and rear-sync, which are special-purpose flash options. Note 
that the list of available flash modes doesn’t include three options available 
in the fully automatic exposure modes: Auto, in which the camera makes 
the decisions about when to fire the flash; its companion, Auto Plus Red-Eye 
Reduction; and Off. Instead, if you don’t want the flash to fire, simply keep 
the flash unit closed.
The camera does give you a little auto-flash input though: You see a blinking 
question mark, flash symbol, or both in the viewfinder in the P, S, and A 
modes if the camera thinks you need to use flash, and the Shooting Infor-
mation display also tells you that the scene is too dark. Press the Zoom Out 
button (the one with the question mark above it), and a message appears rec-
ommending that you use flash. 
 
Before moving on to explore the flash modes, here’s one tip that applies to all 
of them: Pay careful attention to your results when you use the built-in flash 
with a telephoto lens that is very long. You may find that the flash casts an 
unwanted shadow when it strikes the lens. For best results, try switching to 
an external flash head, as discussed near the end of this chapter.
Fill flash
 
 The fill flash setting is represented by the plain-old lightning-bolt symbol 
you see in the margin here. (Figure 5-27 shows you the symbol as it appears 
in the Shooting Information display.) You can think of this setting as “normal 
flash” — at least in the way that most of us think of using a flash.
You may also hear this mode called force flash because the flash fires no 
matter what the available light, unlike in the Auto flash mode provided for 
the fully automatic exposure modes, in which the camera decides when flash 
is needed. In Fill flash mode, the flash fires even in the brightest daylight — 
which, by the way, is often an excellent idea.

150
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Yep, you read me correctly: Adding a flash can really improve outdoor 
photos, even when the sun is at its sunniest. Just as an example, Figure 5-28 
shows a floral image taken both with and without a flash. The small pop 
of light provided by the built-in flash is also extremely beneficial when 
shooting subjects that happen to be slightly shaded, such as the carousel 
horses featured in the next section. For outdoor portraits, a flash is even 
more important; Chapter 7 discusses that subject.
Using a flash in bright sunlight also produces a slight warming effect, as 
illustrated in Figure 5-28. This color shift occurs because when you enable 
the flash, the camera’s white balancing mechanism warms color slightly to 
compensate for the bluish light of a flash. But because your scene is actually 
lit primarily by sunlight, which is not as cool as flash light, the white balance 
adjustment takes the image colors a step warmer than neutral. If you don’t 
want this warming effect, see Chapter 6 to find out how to make a manual 
white balance adjustment.
 
Do note, however, that when you use the built-in flash, you’re restricted to 
a top shutter speed of 1/200 second. That means that in very bright sun, you 
may need to stop down the aperture significantly or lower ISO, if possible, 
to avoid overexposing the image. See the sidebar “In Sync: Flash timing 
and shutter speed,” later in this chapter, for details on shutter-speed ranges 
available for flash photography.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Red-eye reduction flash 
Red-eye is caused when flash light bounces off a subject’s retinas and is 
reflected back to the camera lens. Red-eye is a human phenomena, though; 
with animals, the reflected light usually glows yellow, white, or green, 
producing an image that looks like your pet is possessed by some demon.
Man or beast, this issue isn’t nearly the problem with the type of pop-up 
flash found on your D5000 as it is on non-SLR cameras. The D5000’s flash is 
positioned in such a way that the flash light usually doesn’t hit a subject’s 
eyes straight on, which lessens the chances of red-eye. However, red-eye 
may still be an issue when you use a lens with a long focal length (a telephoto 
lens) or you shoot subjects from a distance.
 
 If you do notice red-eye, you can try the red-eye reduction mode, represented 
by the icon shown in the margin here. In this mode, the AF-assist lamp on 
the front of the camera lights up briefly before the flash fires. The subject’s 
pupils constrict in response to the light, allowing less flash light to enter the 
eye and cause that glowing red reflection. Be sure to warn your subjects to 
wait for the flash, or they may step out of the frame or stop posing after they 
see the light from the AF-assist lamp.
For an even better solution, try the flash-free portrait tips covered in Chapter 
7. If you do a lot of portrait work that requires flash, you may also want to 
consider an external flash unit, which enables you to aim the flash light in 
ways that virtually eliminate red-eye.
If all else fails, check out Chapter 10, which shows you how to use the built-in 
red-eye removal tool on your camera’s Retouch menu. Sadly, though, this 
feature removes only red-eye, not the yellow/green/white eye that you get 
with animal portraits.
Slow-sync and rear-sync flash
In fill flash and red-eye reduction flash modes, the flash and shutter are syn-
chronized so that the flash fires at the exact moment the shutter opens.
 
Technical types refer to this flash arrangement as front-curtain sync.
Your D5000 also offers four special-sync modes, which work as follows:
 
✓ Slow-sync flash: This mode, available only in the P and A exposure 
modes, also uses front-curtain sync but allows a shutter speed slower 
than the 1/60 second minimum that is in force when you use fill flash 
and red-eye reduction flash.

152
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 The benefit of this longer exposure is that the camera has time to 
absorb more ambient light, which in turn has two effects: Background 
areas that are beyond the reach of the flash appear brighter; and less 
flash power is needed, resulting in softer lighting.
 
 The downside of the slow shutter speed is, well, the slow shutter speed. 
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the longer the exposure time, the 
more you have to worry about blur caused by movement of your subject 
or your camera. A tripod is essential to a good outcome, as are subjects 
that can hold very, very still. I find that the best practical use for this 
mode is shooting nighttime still-life subjects such as the one you see in 
Figure 5-29.
 
 Some photographers, though, turn the downside of slow-sync flash to an 
upside, using it to purposely blur their subjects, thereby emphasizing 
motion.
 
Slow-sync flash
Normal flash
 
Figure 5-29: Slow-sync flash produces softer, more even lighting than normal flash in 
 
nighttime pictures.

153
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ Rear-curtain sync: In this mode, 
available only in shutter-priority 
(S) and manual (M) exposure 
modes, the flash fires at the very 
end of the exposure, just before 
the shutter closes. The classic 
use of this mode is to combine 
the flash with a slow shutter 
speed to create trailing-light 
effects like the one you see in 
Figure 5-30. With rear-curtain 
sync, the light trails extend 
behind the moving object (my 
hand, and the match, in this 
case), which makes visual sense. 
If instead you use slow-sync flash, 
the light trails appear in front of 
the moving object.
 
✓ Slow-sync with rear-curtain sync: 
Hey, not confusing enough for 
you yet? This mode enables you 
to produce the same motion trail 
effects as with rear-curtain sync, 
but in the P and A exposure modes.
 
✓ Slow-sync with red-eye reduction: In P and A exposure modes, you can 
also combine a slow-sync flash with the red-eye reduction feature. Given 
the potential for blur that comes with a slow shutter, plus the potential 
for subjects to mistake the prelight from the AF-assist lamp for the real 
flash and walk out of the frame before the image is actually recorded, I 
vote this flash mode as the most difficult to pull off successfully.
Note that all of these modes are somewhat tricky to use successfully, how-
ever. So have fun playing around, but at the same time, don’t feel too badly if 
you don’t have time right now to master these modes plus all the other expo-
sure options presented to you in this chapter. In the meantime, do a Web 
search for slow-sync and rear-sync image examples if you want to get a better 
idea of the effects that other photographers create with these flash modes.
Adjusting flash output
 
When you shoot with your built-in flash, the camera attempts to adjust the 
flash output as needed to produce a good exposure. But if you shoot in the P, 
S, A, or M exposure modes and you want a little more or less flash light than 
the camera thinks is appropriate, you can adjust the flash output by using a 
feature called Flash Compensation.
Figure 5-30: I used rear-curtain flash to 
create this candle-lighting image.

154
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
This feature works just like Exposure Compensation, discussed earlier in 
the chapter, except that it enables you to override the camera’s flash-
power decision instead of its autoexposure decision. As with Exposure 
Compensation, the Flash Compensation settings are stated in terms of EV 
(exposure value) numbers. A setting of 0.0 indicates no flash adjustment; 
you can increase the flash power to EV +1.0 or decrease it to EV –3.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature, look at the carousel images in 
Figure 5-31. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a 
flash to compensate for the fact that the horses were shadowed by the roof 
of the carousel. But at normal flash power, as shown in the middle image, 
the flash was too strong, creating glare in some spots and blowing out the 
highlights in the white mane. By dialing the flash power down to EV –0.7, I got 
a softer flash that straddled the line perfectly between no flash and too much 
flash.
 
No flash
Flash EV 0.0
Flash EV −0.7
 
Figure 5-31: When normal flash output is too strong, dial in a lower Flash 
 
Compensation setting.

155
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some 
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a Flash 
Compensation of +1.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and you simply 
can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other words, don’t 
even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from your seat in the 
balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
With that preface in mind, you can enable Flash Compensation in two ways:
 
✓ Use the two-button plus 
Command dial maneuver. First, 
press the Flash button to pop up 
the built-in flash. Then press and 
hold the Flash button and the 
Exposure Compensation button 
simultaneously. When you press 
the buttons, you see the screen 
shown in Figure 5-32. In the view-
finder, the current setting takes 
the place of the usual frames-
remaining value. While keeping 
both the buttons pressed, rotate 
the Command dial to adjust the 
setting. I find that any technique 
that involves coordinating this 
many fingers a little complex, but 
you may find it easier than I do.
In sync: Flash timing and shutter speed
In order to properly expose flash pictures, the 
camera has to synchronize the timing of the 
flash output with the opening and closing of the 
shutter. For this reason, the range of shutter 
speeds available to you is more limited when 
you use flash than when you go flash-free.
When you use the built-in flash, the maximum 
shutter speed is 1/200 second. The minimum 
shutter speed varies depending on your expo-
sure mode. The minimum speed for the main 
exposure modes are as follows:
✓  P, A, Auto, Portrait, Child modes: 1/60 
second
 ✓ Close Up mode: 1/125 second
 ✓ Nighttime Portrait mode: 1 second
 ✓ S mode: 30 seconds
 ✓ M mode: 30 seconds (unless you use bulb 
mode, in which the shutter stays open as 
long as you hold the shutter button down)
These same shutter-speed requirements apply 
when you attach an external flash head as well 
as for the built-in flash.
Figure 5-32: Rotate the Command dial while 
pressing the Flash and Exposure 
Compensation buttons to adjust flash power.

✓ Use the standard Quick-Settings screen approach. Just bring up the 
Shooting Information display, press the Information Edit button to 
shift to Quick Settings mode, and highlight the Flash Compensation 
setting. (It’s the setting that’s highlighted at the bottom of the screen in 
Figure 5-32.) Press OK to display a screen where you can set the flash 
power. Press the Multi Selector up or down to change the setting and 
then press OK.
 
As with Exposure Compensation, any flash-power adjustment you make 
remains in force, even if you turn off the camera, until you reset the control. 
So be sure to check the setting before you next use your flash.
 
If you’re an advanced flash user and want to control flash power manually, 
Chapter 11 shows you how. 
Using an external flash head
In addition to its built-in flash, your camera has a hot shoe, which is photo-
geek terminology for a connection that enables you to add an external 
flash head like the one shown in Figure 5-33. The figure features the Nikon 
Speedlight SB-600, which currently retails for about $225. (The hot shoe is 
covered by a little cap when you first get the camera; you have to remove it 
to add your flash.)
Although not the cheapest of accessories, an 
external flash may be a worthwhile invest-
ment if you do a lot of flash photography. 
For one thing, an external flash offers greater 
power, enabling you to illuminate a larger 
area than you can with a built-in flash. And 
with flash units like the one in Figure 5-33, 
you can rotate the flash head so that the 
flash light bounces off a wall or ceiling 
instead of hitting your subject directly. This 
results in softer lighting and can eliminate 
the harsh shadows often caused by the 
strong, narrowly focused light of a built-in 
flash. (Chapter 7 offers an example of the 
difference this lighting technique can make 
in portraits.)
If you do purchase an external flash, I highly 
recommend that you visit a good camera 
store, where the personnel can help you 
select the right unit for the kind of flash work 
you want to do. You may also want to dig 
Figure 5-33: You can mount a flash 
head via the hot shoe on top of the 
camera.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
into some of the many books that concentrate on flash photography and the 
Nikon Creative Lighting System. There’s a lot more to that game than you 
may imagine, and you’ll no doubt discover some great ideas about lighting 
your pictures with flash. You can start with Chapter 7, which provides some 
specific examples of how to get better flash results when you shoot portraits, 
whether you go with the built-in flash, an external flash, or, my favorite, 
no flash.
Bracketing Exposures
Many professional photographers use a strategy called bracketing to ensure 
that at least one shot of a subject is properly exposed. They shoot the 
same subject multiple times, slightly varying the exposure settings for 
each image.
To make bracketing easy, your D5000 offers automatic bracketing. When you 
enable this feature, your only job is to press the shutter button to record 
the shots; the camera automatically adjusts the exposure settings between 
each image.
The D5000, however, takes things one step further than most cameras that 
offer automatic bracketing. In addition to bracketing exposure, you can 
bracket the amount of Active D-Lighting that’s applied. And when you’re 
concerned about color, you can instead choose to bracket white balancing, 
an adjustment that you can explore fully in Chapter 6. This third bracketing 
option doesn’t work if you capture your photo in the RAW format, however; 
you must set the Image Quality setting to one of the JPEG options.
 
With the D5000, you record a three-shot series of bracketed images when 
you use the autoexposure and white balance bracketing options. For Active 
D-Lighting, you can take only two shots in the series, one with the feature 
turned on and one off. To try your hand at bracketing, follow these steps:
 
1. Set your camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
 
 You can’t take advantage of the feature in the Auto or Digital Vari-
Program modes.
 
2. If you want to use white balance bracketing, set the Image Quality 
option to a setting other than RAW (NEF).
 
 Again, you can’t bracket white balance unless you use one of the JPEG 
file options. (You can, however, easily apply any desired color shift at 
the time you process your RAW images, a topic you can explore in 
Chapter 8.)
 
3. Display the Custom Setting menu, highlight Bracketing/Flash, and 
press OK. 

158
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
4. Highlight the Auto Bracketing Set option from the menu shown on the 
left in Figure 5-34 and press OK.
 
 Now you see the options shown on the right in Figure 5-34. This screen 
is where you tell the camera whether you want to bracket exposure 
(AE), white balance (WB), or Active D-Lighting (ADL). Note that even 
though the first option is called AE (for autoexposure), it enables you to 
bracket exposure in M (manual exposure) mode just the same.
 
5. Select the desired bracking option and press OK.
 
6. Use the Quick Settings screen to specify the amount of shift you want 
between each bracketed shot.
 
 After shifting to Quick Settings mode, highlight the Bracketing Increment 
setting in the lower-right corner of the screen, as shown on the left in 
Figure 5-35. Press OK to display the second screen in the figure, where 
you can tell the camera how strong of an adjustment to make between 
shots. The available settings depend on the feature you’re bracketing 
(exposure, color, or Active D-Lighting). 
 
 
Figure 5-34: Before enabling auto bracketing, select the feature you want the camera to 
 
adjust between shots.
 
 
Figure 5-35: Set the bracketing amount through the Quick Settings screen. 

159
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 A few notes on that point:
 
• For the exposure bracketing, the settings are based on Exposure 
Compensation values. For example, if you choose 0.7 for an auto-
exposure bracketing set, the camera makes three exposures, one 
with exposure values as metered by the camera, one exposure with 
+0.7 EV, and one exposure with –0.7 EV. Your choices are from 0.3 
EV to 2.0 EV. (When you view the picture settings during playback, 
a topic covered in Chapter 4, the amount of bracketing adjustment 
for a shot appears in the Exposure Compensation field.)
 
 The adjustment increments are based on the current setting 
of the EV Steps for Exposure Control option, located on the 
Custom Setting menu. The earlier section, “Applying Exposure 
Compensation,” introduces you to this menu. By default, the 
option is set to increments of one-third stop, but if you want a 
larger variation between each bracketed shot, you can change the 
menu setting to 1/2 stop (0.5). Just remember that the selected 
setting affects the amount of adjustment when you apply Exposure 
Compensation as well as Flash Compensation, also covered earlier 
in this chapter.
 
• For white balance (WB) bracketing, you can shift the white balance 
in increments of 1, 2, or 3, with each step making the picture either 
progressively more amber or more blue. See Chapter 6 for the 
details that will make that feature clear. In the meantime, just 
understand that the differences between each shot will be subtle, 
even if you choose the highest shift amount.
 
7. After selecting the bracketing increment, press OK to return to the 
Shooting Information display.
 
8. Shoot your first bracketed series.
 
 Remember, for autoexposure bracketing, a series consists of three 
shots. For Active D-Lighting, you need to fire off two shots. For white-
balance bracketing, however, you press the shutter button only once. 
The camera then records the image three times, using a different white 
balance adjustment for each photo.
  
 When autoexposure bracketing is enabled, the exposure meter in the 
Shooting Information display offers a bracketing progress indicator. 
That’s a pretty technical way of saying, “Little bars appear under the 
meter, each one representing one shot in your bracketed series.” The 
indicator updates after each picture to show you how many more shots 
are left in the series. For example, the middle bar represents your first 
shot; after you take your first picture, it disappears. You then see two 
bars — and thus, two shots left to shoot. For White Balance bracketing, 
you see the three bars under the meter at all times (because a single 
press of the shutter button records the entire bracketed series). For 
ADL bracketing, look to the lower-right corner of the screen to find out 
which shot you’re about to take. Just above the Flash mode setting, you 

160
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
see the letters ADL-BKT and then two additional values: Off and a letter 
representing the ADL strength (H for High, for example). The underscore 
beneath the value indicates which shot you’re about to capture.
 
9. To disable bracketing, repeat Step 6 and select Off from the second 
screen shown in Figure 5-35.
 
Don’t be put off by the length of these steps, by the way. Although describing 
the feature takes quite a few words, using bracketing really isn’t all that com-
plicated. Bracketing is a wonderful way to hedge your bet, especially when 
you’re taking pictures of a place you may never visit again, or experiencing a 
once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity such as your son’s first birthday party.

Manipulating Focus and Color
In This Chapter
▶ Controlling the camera’s autofocusing performance
▶ Using autofocus in Live View mode
▶ Understanding focal lengths, depth of field, and other focus factors
▶ Exploring white balance and its effect on color
▶ Investigating other advanced color options
T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied 
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s 
true — this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. There’s 
not much to appreciate about an image that’s so blurry that you can’t make 
out whether you’re looking at Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more to focus 
than simply getting a sharp image of a subject. You also 
need to consider depth of field, or the distance over 
which objects remain sharply focused. This chapter 
explains all the ways to control depth of field, how 
to use your D5000’s advanced autofocus options, 
and how to take advantage of autofocus in Live 
View mode.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of 
color, explaining your camera’s white balance 
control, which compensates for the varying color 
casts created by different light sources. You also can 
get my take on the other advanced color options on 
your D5000, including the Color Space option and Picture 
Controls, in this chapter.

162
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Reviewing Focus Basics
I touch on various focus issues in Chapters 1, 2, and 5. But just in case you’re 
not reading this book from front to back, here’s a recap of the basic process 
of focusing with your D5000.
 
These steps assume that Live View, introduced in Chapter 4, is not enabled. 
Focusing works a little differently in Live View mode; see the upcoming sec-
tion “Autofocusing in Live View mode” for details.
 
1. Set the focusing switch on the lens to manual or automatic focusing.
 
 If you want to focus manually, set the switch to the M position; for auto-
focusing, set it to the A position.
 
 These directions are specific to the kit lens sold with the D5000. Other 
lenses may have a different sort of switch or no switch at all, so check 
the product manual. And note that not all lenses provide autofocusing 
when paired with the D5000. For manual focusing, be sure to set the 
Focus mode to MF (manual focus), as explained in the upcoming section 
“Changing the Focus mode setting.” (With the kit lens and some other 
lenses, the camera takes care of that step automatically for you.)
 
2. Frame the picture so that your subject falls under one of the 11 auto-
focus points.
 
 The autofocus points are represented 
by the little black squares in the view-
finder. For most exposure modes, all 
11 focus points are active by default 
and can be used for autofocusing.
 
 Note, however, that when you set the 
lens to manual focusing or set the 
Mode dial to the Landscape, Close 
Up, or Sports mode, only a single 
point is active at the default set-
tings. It appears surrounded by black 
brackets. Use the Multi Selector to 
move the brackets over the object on 
which you want to focus.
 
3. To set focus in autofocus mode, 
press and hold the shutter button 
halfway down.
 
 Depending on the lighting conditions, 
the camera’s AF-assist illuminator on 
the front of the camera may emit a 
beam to help the autofocus system find its target. (If the light becomes a 
distraction, you can disable it through the Built-in AF-assist illuminator 
Figure 6-1: Set the lens switch to the A 
position for autofocusing. 

163
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
option, found on the Autofocus submenu of the Custom Setting menu. 
But the camera may have trouble locking focus, so you may need to 
focus manually.)
 
 When focus is established, the focus lamp in the viewfinder lights. If a 
single focus point was selected in the preceding step, it briefly flashes 
red and then appears black again. If all focus points were active, one or 
more of the focus points flashes and then appears surrounded by brack-
ets, as shown in Figure 6-2. Any objects that fall under those points are 
in focus.
 
 The part of the frame the camera 
uses to establish focus depends 
on the current AF-area mode. To 
find out more about this issue, 
including how to select the focus 
point you want to use, check out 
the section “Adjusting Autofocus 
Performance”.
 
4. To set focus manually, twist the 
focusing ring on the lens.
 
 Don’t forget! First set the lens 
switch to the manual focusing 
position, or you may damage 
the lens.
 
 If you press the shutter button 
halfway before moving the focus-
ing ring, the focus lamp lights 
when you achieve focus. This feedback is based upon the focus point 
you selected in Step 2. See the next section for help with another 
manual-focusing tool, the Rangefinder.
By default, if you use autofocusing and your subject moves before you take 
the shot, the camera tries to adjust focus as needed. In the P, S, A, and M 
exposure modes, you can control this behavior through the Focus mode set-
ting, also explained later in this chapter.
Taking Advantage of Manual-Focusing Aids
Today’s autofocusing systems are pretty remarkable. As long as you follow 
the suggested techniques for autofocusing and use the right settings for the 
situation, you can expect a nice, sharply focused subject.

focus points.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
However, some subjects baffle even the most capable autofocus system: 
objects behind fences, highly reflective objects, dimly-lit subjects, and scenes 
in which very little contrast exists between the subject and background. And 
of course, if the lens you use on your D5000 doesn’t offer an autofocus motor, 
you must focus manually. 
 
Manual focus doesn’t mean that you don’t get some focusing assistance from 
the camera, however. First, even in manual focus mode, you get the benefit of 
the focus-indicator lamp, as I mention in the preceding section. 
Additionally, through your camera’s Rangefinder option, you can swap out 
the exposure meter in the viewfinder with a focus-distance meter. Here’s how 
it works: You take the same manual focusing approach as described in the 
preceding section, using the Multi Selector to select a focus point and then 
dialing in focus by twisting the focusing ring on the lens. When you press the 
shutter button halfway, the rangefinder display indicates whether focus is set 
on the object in the selected focus point.
 
If bars appear to the left of the 0, as shown in the left example in Figure 6-3, 
focus is set in front of the subject; if the bars are to the right, as in the middle 
example, focus is slightly behind the subject. The more bars you see, the 
greater the focusing error. As you twist the focusing ring, the rangefinder 
updates to help you get focus on track. When you see a single bar on either 
side of the 0, you’re good to go.
 
Focus front of subject
Focus behind subject
Unable to focus
 
Figure 6-3: The rangefinder offers manual-focusing assistance.
Before I tell you how to activate this feature, I want to point out a couple of 
issues:
 
✓ You can use the Rangefinder in any exposure mode except M. In Manual 
mode, the viewfinder always displays the exposure meter.
 
✓ Your lens must offer a maximum aperture (f-stop number) of f/5.6 or 
lower. To understand f-stops, head back to Chapter 5. The kit lens sold 
with the D5000 meets this qualification.
 
✓ The Rangefinder is unavailable during Live View shooting.
 
✓ With subjects that confuse the camera’s autofocus system, the 
rangefinder may not work well either; it’s based on the same system. If 
the system can’t find the focusing target, you see the Rangefinder dis-
play shown on the right in Figure 6-3.

165
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
If none of those caveats concern you, you can enable the rangefinder dis-
play via the Custom Setting menu. Look on the Autofocus submenu for the 
Rangefinder option, press OK, select On, and press OK again. 
 
After you turn the Rangefinder option to On, the rangefinder automatically 
replaces the exposure meter in the viewfinder when you switch to manual 
focusing, assuming that you set the Mode dial to any exposure setting but 
M. Again, you don’t have the option to replace the exposure meter with the 
rangefinder in M exposure mode. 
Do you need to worry about not having the exposure meter in the other 
modes? Well, the meter still appears in the Shooting Info display if the 
camera anticipates an exposure problem. So you can always check exposure 
in the Shooting Info display and then check focus through the rangefinder.
That said, I typically leave the Rangefinder off and just rely on the focus 
indicator lamp and my eyes to verify focus. I shoot in the S and A exposure 
modes frequently, and I just find it a pain to have to monitor exposure in the 
Shooting Info display rather than in the viewfinder. That’s not a recommenda-
tion to you either way — it’s just how I prefer to work. 
Adjusting Autofocus Performance
You can adjust two aspects of your camera’s focusing system: the AF-area 
mode and the Focus mode. The following sections fill in the details.
Understanding the AF-area mode setting
 
The AF-area mode option determines which of the 11 focusing points the 
camera uses to establish focus. (The AF in AF-area mode stands for autofo-
cus). You can view the current setting on the Shooting Information display, as 
shown in Figure 6-4. 
Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related 
to the issues discussed in this chapter. Any 
movement of the camera or subject can also 
cause blur. Both of these problems are related to 
shutter speed, an exposure control that I cover 
in Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7, 
which provides some additional tips for captur-
ing moving objects without blur.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
You can choose from four settings, 
which work as described in the fol-
lowing list and are represented in the 
displays by the accompanying icons. 
(Note that the icons look slightly 
different depending on where you 
view them. The ones in the margins 
here are shown as they appear in the 
Shooting Information display.) 
 
 
✓ Single Point: This mode is 
designed for shooting still sub-
jects. You select one of the 11 
focus points, and the camera 
sets focus on the object that 
falls within that point. (See the upcoming section “Selecting a single 
focus point” for specifics on how to designate your chosen point.) The 
camera uses this mode by default when you shoot in the Close Up and 
Landscape exposure modes.
 
 On the Shooting Information display, the position of the brackets in the 
AF-area mode icon show you which point is selected. For example, an 
icon like the one you see in the margin here tells you that the center 
point is selected.
 
 
✓ Dynamic Area: In this mode, designed for shooting moving subjects, 
you select an initial focus point, just as in Single Point mode. But if the 
subject within that focus point moves after you press the shutter button 
halfway to set focus, the camera looks for focus information from the 
other focus points. The idea is that the subject is likely to wind up 
within one of the 11 focus areas. It’s the default setting when you shoot 
in the Sports exposure mode.
 
 However — and this is a biggie — in order for the automatic focus 
adjustment to occur, you also must set the Focus mode option 
(explained next) to either AF-A or AF-C. (AF-A is the default.) If you 
instead set that option to AF-S, which is designed for shooting still sub-
jects, the camera sticks with the initial focus point you select, even if the 
subject moves before you take the picture.
 
 In the displays, the icon for this mode looks similar to the one in the 
margin here. Your selected focus point is surrounded by brackets, 
but you also see little plus signs marking the other points. Note that 
the brackets surrounding your selected focus point don’t move if the 
camera shifts to a different point to focus, but the focus shift is happen-
ing just the same.
 
 
✓ Auto Area: The camera analyzes the objects under all 11 autofocus 
points and selects the one it deems most appropriate. This mode is the 
default setting for the Portrait, Child, Night Portrait, Flash Off, and Auto 
modes as well as for all the advanced exposure modes.
Figure 6-4: The symbol for the current AF-area 
mode appears here.

167
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
✓ 3D Tracking: This one is a variation of Dynamic Area autofocusing — 
well, sort of. As with Dynamic Area mode, you start by selecting a single 
focus point (surrounded by brackets in the displays) and then press the 
shutter button halfway to set focus. But the goal of this mode is to main-
tain focus on your subject if you recompose the shot after you press the 
shutter button halfway to lock focus. Again, you have to set the Focus 
mode to AF-A or AF-C for this focus adjustment to occur.
 
 The only problem is that the way the camera detects your subject is by 
analyzing the colors of the object under your selected focus point. So if 
not much difference exists between the subject and other objects in the 
frame, the camera can get fooled. And if your subject moves out of the 
frame, you must release the shutter button and reset focus by pressing 
it halfway again.
 
 The 3D Tracking display icon appears in the Shooting Information dis-
play as shown in the margin here.
 
If you’re feeling overwhelmed by all of your autofocus options (not to men-
tion all the other D5000 features), Auto-area produces good results for most 
subjects. Personally, however, I rely on the first two modes because if the 
Auto mode makes the wrong focus assumptions, there’s no way to select a 
different focus point. So for still subjects, I stick with Single Point focus; for 
moving subjects, I go with Dynamic Area.
Whatever your conclusions on the subject, the next two sections show you 
how to adjust the AF-area mode and select a specific focus point. 
Changing the AF-area mode setting
You can control the AF-area mode setting in any of your camera’s expo-
sure modes. The fastest way is to use the Quick Settings display. With the 
Shooting Settings screen displayed, press the Information Edit button to shift 
to Quick Settings mode and then highlight the AF-area mode icon, as shown 
on the left in Figure 6-5. Press OK to access the second screen in the figure, 
where you see four icons representing the different mode options. From 
top to bottom, the settings are Single Point, Dynamic Area, Auto Area, and 
3D-Tracking.
You also can change the mode through the menus if you find it easier. Just 
head for the Custom Setting menu, highlight the Autofocus submenu, and 
press OK to display the screen shown in Figure 6-6. From there, press OK to 
display the options shown on the right in the figure. This time, the option 
names are spelled out.

Figure 6-6: You also can adjust the setting through the Autofocus submenu of the Custom 
 
Setting menu.
Selecting a single focus point
In any AF-area mode except Auto-area, take these steps to select a focus 
point:
 
1. Press the shutter button halfway and release it to engage the exposure 
meters.
 
2. Use the Multi Selector to select a focus point.
 
 The currently selected point is surrounded by brackets, as shown in 
Figure 6-7.
 
To quickly select the center focus point, press OK. No need to cycle your way 
through all the other focus points to get to the center.

169
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
You use this same technique, by the 
way, to select a focus point when you 
are focusing manually. Taking that 
step isn’t actually necessary to estab-
lish focus, but it affects the feedback 
you get from the focus lamp in the 
viewfinder. The lamp lights when the 
area inside the selected focus point 
comes into focus.
Changing the Focus 
mode setting
 
Throughout this book, I use the 
term focusing mode generically to 
refer to the lens switch that shifts 
your camera from autofocusing to 
manual focusing — at least, on the kit lens sold with the D5000. But there is 
also an official Focus mode setting, which controls another aspect of your 
camera’s focusing behavior. There are four options, which work as follows:
 
✓ AF-S (single-servo autofocus): In this mode, which is geared to shooting 
stationary subjects, the camera locks focus when you depress the shut-
ter button halfway.
 
 Use this mode if you want to frame your subject so that it doesn’t fall 
under an autofocus point: Compose the scene initially to put the subject 
under a focus point, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, and 
then reframe to the composition you have in mind. As long as you keep 
the button pressed halfway, focus remains set on your subject.
 
✓ AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus): In this mode, which is designed for 
moving subjects, the camera focuses continuously for the entire time 
you hold the shutter button halfway down. If the subject moves but still 
falls under one of the other focus points, the camera should adjust focus 
correctly. Otherwise, the camera looks for something else on which to 
establish focus. If you want to lock focus at a certain distance, you must 
press the AE-L/AF-L button, as described in the section, “Using auto-
focus lock,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ AF-A (auto-servo autofocus): This mode is the default setting. The 
camera analyzes the scene and, if it detects motion, automatically 
selects continuous-servo mode (AF-C). If the camera instead believes 
you’re shooting a stationary object, it selects single-servo mode (AF-S). 
This mode works pretty well, but it can get confused sometimes. For 
example, if your subject is motionless but other people are moving 
in the background, the camera may mistakenly switch to continuous 
autofocus. By the same token, if the subject is moving only slightly, the 
camera may not make the switch.
Selected focus point

point that’s over your subject.

170
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ MF (Manual Focus): If you use a lens that does not offer an external 
switch to shift from auto to manual focus, you need to select this set-
ting to focus manually. You also need to choose this setting if your lens 
doesn’t offer an autofocus motor at all. On the kit lens featured in this 
book, simply setting the switch on the lens to M automatically sets the 
Focus mode to MF. However, the opposite isn’t true: Choosing the MF 
setting for the Focus mode does not free the focusing ring so that you 
can set focus manually; you must set the lens switch to the M position.
You can choose from all four settings only in the P, S, A, and M exposure 
modes. In the other modes, you can choose between AF-A and MF only. 
Assuming that you are using a mode that allows full control, which Focus 
mode should you select? As for the autofocus options, single-servo mode 
(AF-S) works best for shooting still subjects, and continuous-servo (AF-C) is 
the right choice for moving subjects. But frankly, auto-servo (AF-A), which is 
the default setting, does a good job in most cases of making that shift for you. 
So, in my mind, there’s no real reason to fiddle with the setting unless you’re 
having trouble getting the camera to lock onto your subject.
 
 At any rate, you can change the Focus mode only through the Quick Settings 
display. After bringing up the Shooting Settings screen, press the Information 
Edit button to shift to Quick Settings mode. (You can also simply press the 
Info Edit button twice.) Then use the Multi Selector to navigate to the Focus 
mode setting, as shown on the left in Figure 6-8. Press OK to display the 
Focus Mode options shown on the right. Choose the desired mode and 
press OK.

you press the shutter button halfway.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Choosing the right autofocus combo
 
You’ll get the best autofocus results if you pair your chosen Focus mode 
with the most appropriate AF-area mode, because the two settings work in 
tandem. Here are the combinations that I suggest for the maximum autofocus 
control:
 
✓ For still subjects, use Single Point as the AF-area mode and AF-S as 
the Focus mode. You then select a specific focus point, and the camera 
locks focus on that point at the time you press the shutter button half-
way. Focus remains locked on your subject even if you reframe the shot 
after you press the button halfway. (It helps to remember the s factor: 
For still subjects, Single Point and AF-S.)
 
✓ For moving subjects, set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area and the 
Focus mode to AF-C. You still begin by selecting a focus point, but the 
camera adjusts focus as needed if your subject moves within the frame 
after you press the shutter button halfway to establish focus. (Think 
motion, dynamic, continuous.)
Again, though, you get full control over the Focus mode only in the P. S, A, 
and M exposure modes. In the other modes, you have only two choices — 
either MF (manual focus) or AF-A. 
Using autofocus lock
When you set your camera’s Focus mode to AF-C (continuous-servo autofo-
cus), pressing and holding the shutter button halfway initiates autofocus. But 
focusing is continually adjusted while you hold the shutter button halfway, so 
the focusing distance may change if the subject moves out of the active auto-
focus area before you press the shutter button the rest of the way to take 
the picture. The same is true if you use AF-A mode (auto-servo autofocus) 
and the camera senses movement in front of the lens, in which case it shifts 
to AF-C mode and operates as I just described. Either way, the upshot is that 
you can’t control the exact focusing distance the camera ultimately uses.
Should you want to lock focus at a specific distance, you have a couple of 
options:
 
✓ Focus manually. 
 
✓ Change the Focus mode to AF-S (single-servo autofocus). In this mode, 
focus is locked when you press and hold the shutter button halfway.

172
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 
✓ Use autofocus lock. First set focus by pressing the shutter button half-
way. When the focus is established at the distance you want, press and 
hold the AE-L/AF-L button, located near the viewfinder. Focus remains 
set as long as you hold the button down, even if you release the shutter 
button.
 
 Keep in mind, though, that by default, pressing the AE-L/AF-L button 
also locks in autoexposure. (Chapter 5 explains.) You can change this 
behavior, however, setting the button to lock just one or the other. 
Chapter 11 explains this option as well as a couple other ways to cus-
tomize the button’s function.
 
For my money, manual focusing is by far the easiest solution. Yes, it may take 
you a little while to get comfortable with manual focusing, but in the long 
run, you really save yourself a lot of time fiddling with the various autofocus 
settings, remembering which button initiates the focus lock, and so on. Just 
be sure that you have adjusted the viewfinder diopter to your eyesight, as 
explained in Chapter 1, so that there’s not a disconnect between what you 
see in the viewfinder and where the camera is actually focusing. After a little 
practice, focusing manually will become second nature to you. 
Autofocusing in Live View mode
Chapter 4 covers the basics of shooting in Live View mode, which enables 
you to compose your shots by using the camera monitor instead of the view-
finder. You can opt for Live View shooting for taking still pictures, and you’re 
required to use it to record movies.
As I mention in the Chapter 4 discussion, the simplest and most reliable 
focusing choice is to focus manually. That said, you can use autofocus in Live 
View mode if you prefer. 
 
If you do try Live View autofocusing, first set aside all the autofocusing 
information presented heretofore in this chapter. All the settings related 
to normal autofocusing — AF-area mode, Focus mode, and the like — are 
irrelevant. Instead, you can choose from the following autofocusing methods:
 
 
✓ Face Priority: Designed for portrait shooting, this mode attempts to 
hunt down and lock focus on faces when you press the shutter button 
halfway. This setting is chosen by default if you set the exposure Mode 
dial to the Auto, Portrait, Child, or Night Portrait setting.
 
 
✓ Wide Area: In this mode, you use the Multi Selector to move a little rect-
angular focusing frame around the screen to specify your desired focus-
ing spot. When you press the shutter button halfway, the camera tries to 
lock focus on objects within the focusing frame. This mode is the default 
for the Sports, Landscape, and Flash Off modes as well as P, S, A, and M 
modes.

173
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
✓ Normal Area: This mode works the same way as Wide Area autofocus-
ing but uses a smaller focusing frame. The idea is to enable you to base 
focus on a very specific area. It’s the default mode for pictures you take 
in the Close Up exposure mode.
 
 With such a small focusing frame, however, you can easily miss your 
focus target when handholding the camera. If you move the camera 
slightly just as you’re locking focus, and the focusing frame shifts off 
your subject as a result, focus will be incorrect. So for best results, use a 
tripod in this mode.
 
 
✓ Subject Tracking: This mode is designed to help you establish focus on 
a moving subject. You position a little focus target over the subject, and 
the camera then tries to follow the subject through the frame so that 
when you’re ready to set focus, it can do so quickly. However, under-
stand that this feature works differently from the AF-C (continuous auto-
focus) option you get with regular shooting. Subject Tracking “tracks” a 
moving subject through the frame only up to the point you press the 
shutter button halfway to initiate auto focusing. After that, focus is set, 
and no further adjustment is made, even if your subject moves.
To use Live View autofocusing, first set the switch on your lens to the auto-
focus position. (Remember, you can use autofocusing only with AF-S lenses; 
with other lens types, you must focus manually — in which case, this whole 
section doesn’t apply.)
In the default Live View screen layout, 
an icon representing the current 
Autofocus mode appears at the top 
center spot of the screen, as shown 
in Figure 6-9. (Press the Info button to 
cycle through the available Live View 
display modes.)
To change the setting, you have two 
choices:
 
 
✓ Press the Information Edit button 
to shift to Quick Settings mode. 
Then highlight the Autofocus 
mode icon, as shown on the right 
in Figure 6-9. Press OK to access 
a screen containing the four 
focusing options, highlight your 
choice, and press OK.
 
✓ Open the Custom Setting menu, highlight Autofocus, press OK, and then 
highlight Live View Autofocus, as shown on the right in Figure 6-10. 
Press OK to display the four focusing settings, highlight your choice, 
and press OK.

Figure 6-10: You can change the focusing mode through the Quick Settings screen (left) or 
 
Autofocus menu (on the Custom Settings menu, right).
What happens after you change the autofocus mode and how you go about 
focusing depend on the mode you choose:
 
✓ For Wide Area and Normal Area autofocus, you see the rectangular focus-
ing frame, labeled in Figure 6-9. (The figure shows the frame at the size it 
appears in Wide Area mode.) Use the Multi Selector to position the frame 
over your subject and press the shutter button halfway to focus.
 
✓ In Face Priority mode, a double yellow focusing frame appears around 
the subject’s face. Again, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus. 
(For scenes containing more than one person, focus is set on the closest 
one.) If you don’t see the highlight, the camera can’t detect your sub-
ject’s face, and it will set focus on the center of the frame.
 
✓ In Subject Tracking mode, you see a little white box on the screen. Frame 
your subject so that it’s under that box and then press the Multi Selector 
up. The camera sets the initial focusing distance, and the box turns 
yellow. If the subject moves, the box tags along for the ride. When you’re 
ready to take the picture, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus 
as usual. The camera then sets the final focusing distance on your subject. 
Note that focus is not adjusted after that point if your subject moves.
Whichever mode you choose, the focusing frame turns green and the camera 
beeps when focus is established. If the camera can’t establish focus, the 
focusing frame blinks red.
 
 After setting focus, you can press the Zoom In button to magnify the scene 
and check focus. In Normal Area, Wide Area, and Subject Tracking mode, you 
can press the Multi Selector to scroll the display if needed. In Face Priority 
mode, the camera automatically keeps the face in the highlight box centered 
on the monitor.
 
 To zoom out, press Zoom Out button until you see the entire scene.

175
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
You can use these same steps to establish your initial focusing point when 
recording movies. Release the shutter button after focus is established and 
then press OK to start recording.
 
Remember that for both still and movie photography, though, there is no 
such thing as continuous autofocusing in Live View mode. After you press the 
shutter button halfway to set focus, focus is locked, even if you set the auto-
focus mode to Subject Tracking. In still photography Live View mode, you 
must release the shutter button and then press it halfway again to adjust the 
focus point. In movie mode, you must stop recording, reset focus, and start 
the recording anew. For moving subjects, then, manual focusing makes life a 
lot easier.
Correcting lens distortion
If you take a lot pictures with wide-angle lenses, 
you may notice that verticals in the scene some-
times appear to bow out toward the edges of 
the frame. This is known as barrel distortion. 
On the flip side of the coin, shooting with a long 
telephoto lens sometimes causes those verti-
cals to bow inward, creating an effect called 
pincushion distortion.
The Retouch menu on your camera has a post-
capture filter you can apply to try to correct both 
problems. (See Chapter 10 for help.) But the 
D5000 also has a feature called Auto-Distortion 
Control that attempts to correct the image as 
you’re shooting. It only works with certain types 
of lenses (specifically, those that Nikon classi-
fies as type G and D), but if your lens fits the bill, 
it’s worth trying.
To activate the option, highlight Auto Distortion 
Control on the Shooting Menu, as shown in the 
left figure here. Press OK to reveal the second 
screen, highlight On, and press OK. 
When you use this feature, understand that 
some of the area you see in your viewfinder 
may not be visible in the final photo because 
the anti-distortion manipulation requires some 
cropping of the scene. So after activating the 
feature, take some test shots and examine the 
results carefully. If you’re not happy with the 
results, return to the menu and change the set-
ting back to Off.

176
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept of depth of field is one of the biggest steps 
you can take to becoming a more artful photographer. I introduce you to 
depth of field in Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick recap just to hammer 
home the lesson:
 
✓ Depth of field refers to the distance over which objects in a photograph 
appear sharply focused.
 
✓ With a shallow, or small, depth of field, distant objects appear more 
softly focused than the main subject (assuming that you set focus on the 
main subject, of course).
 
✓ With a large depth of field, the zone of sharp focus extends to include 
objects at a distance from your subject.
Which arrangement works best depends entirely on your creative vision and 
your subject. In portraits, for example, a classic technique is to use a shallow 
depth of field, as shown in the photo in Figure 6-11. This approach increases 
emphasis on the subject while diminishing the impact of the background. In 
the photo shown in Figure 6-12, a large depth of field works better. It empha-
sizes the footprints in the sand and keeps the background buildings sharply 
focused to give them equal weight in 
the scene.
So exactly how do you adjust depth 
of field? You have three points 
of control: aperture, focal length, 
and camera-to-subject distance, as 
spelled out in the following list:
 
✓ Aperture setting (f-stop): The 
aperture is one of three expo-
sure settings, all explained fully 
in Chapter 5. Depth of field 
increases as you stop down 
the aperture (by choosing a 
higher f-stop number). For shal-
low depth of field, open the 
aperture (by choosing a lower 
f-stop number). Figure 6-13 
offers an example; in the f/22 
version, focus is sharp all the 
way through the frame; in the 
f/13 version, focus softens as 
the distance from the center lure 
increases. I snapped both images

background and draws added attention to the 
subject.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
using the same focal length and camera-to-subject distance, setting focus 
on the center lure.
 
✓ Lens focal length: In lay terms, focal length determines what the lens 
“sees.” As you increase focal length, measured in millimeters, the angle 
of view narrows, objects appear larger in the frame, and — the important 
point for this discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally, the 
spatial relationship of objects changes as you adjust focal length. As an 
example, Figure 6-14 compares the same scene shot at a focal length of 
127mm and 183mm. I used the same aperture, f/5.6, for both examples.
 
 Whether you have any focal length flexibility depends on your lens: If 
you have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length — just zoom in 
or out. (The D5000 kit lens, for example, offers a focal-length range of 
18–55mm.) If you don’t have a zoom lens, the focal length is fixed, so 
scratch this means of manipulating depth of field.
 
 For more technical details about focal length and your D5000, see the 
sidebar “Fun facts about focal length.”
 
✓ Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or 
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do, 
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.

Figure 6-13: A lower f-stop number (wider aperture) decreases depth of field.
 
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of 
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-15 
and summed up in the following list:
 
✓ To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide 
as possible (the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum focal 
length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.

179
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the 
highest possible f-stop number, zoom out to the shortest focal length 
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.

Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 183mm
 
Figure 6-14: Zooming to a longer focal length also reduces depth of field.
Just to avoid a possible point of confusion that has arisen in some of the 
classes I teach: When I say zoom in, some students think that I mean to twist 
the zoom barrel so that it moves in toward the camera body. But in fact, the 
phrase zoom in means to zoom to a longer focal length, which produces the 
visual effect of bringing your subject closer. This requires twisting the zoom 
barrel of the lens so that it extends further out from the camera. And the 

180
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
phrase zoom out refers to the opposite maneuver: I’m talking about widening 
your view of the subject by zooming to a shorter focal length, which requires 
moving the lens barrel in toward the camera body.
 
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject
 
Figure 6-15: Your f-stop, focal length, and shooting distance determine depth of field.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 
✓ Aperture-priority autoexposure mode (A) enables you to easily con-
trol depth of field. In this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the 
f-stop, and the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce 
a good exposure. The range of aperture settings you can access depends 
on your lens.
 
 Even in aperture-priority mode, keep an eye on shutter speed as well. To 
maintain the same exposure, shutter speed must change in tandem with 
aperture, and you may encounter a situation where the shutter speed 
is too slow to permit hand-holding of the camera. Lenses that offer 
optical image stabilization, or vibration reduction (VR lenses, in the 
Nikon world), do enable most people to use a slower shutter speed than 
normal, but double-check your results just to be sure. Or use a tripod for 
extra security. Of course, all this assumes that you have dialed in a spe-
cific ISO Sensitivity setting; if you instead are using Auto ISO adjustment, 
the camera may adjust the ISO setting instead of shutter speed. (Chapter 
5 explores the whole aperture/shutter speed/ISO relationship.)

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Fun facts about focal length
Every lens can be characterized by its focal 
length, or in the case of a zoom lens, the range of 
focal lengths it offers. Measured in millimeters, 
focal length determines the camera’s angle of 
view, the apparent size and distance of objects 
in the scene, and depth of field. According to 
photography tradition, a focal length of 50mm is 
described as a “normal” lens. Most point-and-
shoot cameras feature this focal length, which 
is a medium-range lens that works well for the 
type of snapshots that users of those kinds of 
cameras are likely to shoot.
A lens with a focal length under 35mm is char-
acterized as a wide-angle lens because at 
that focal length, the camera has a wide angle 
of view and produces a large depth of field, 
making it good for landscape photography. A 
short focal length also has the effect of making 
objects seem smaller and farther away. At the 
other end of the spectrum, a lens with a focal 
length longer than 80mm is considered a tele-
photo lens and often referred to as a long lens. 
With a long lens, angle of view narrows, depth 
of field decreases, and faraway subjects appear 
closer and larger, which is ideal for wildlife and 
sports photographers.
Note, however, that the focal lengths stated 
here and elsewhere in the book are so-called 
35mm equivalent focal lengths. Here’s the deal: 
For reasons that aren’t really important, when 
you put a standard lens on most digital cam-
eras, including your D5000, the available frame 
area is reduced, as if you took a picture on a 
camera that uses 35mm film negatives (the kind 
you’ve probably been using for years) and then 
cropped it.
This so-called crop factor, sometimes also called 
the magnification factor, varies depending on the 
digital camera, which is why the photo industry 
adopted the 35mm-equivalent measuring stick 
as a standard. With the D5000, the cropping 
factor is roughly 1.5. So the 18–55mm kit lens, for 
example, actually captures the approximate area 
you would get from a 27–83mm lens on a 35mm 
film camera. In the figure here, for example, the 
red outline indicates the image area that results 
from the 1.5 crop factor.
Note that although the area the lens can cap-
ture changes when you move a lens from a 
35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of 
field isn’t affected, nor are the spatial relation-
ships between objects in the frame. So when 
lens shopping, you gauge those two character-
istics of the lens by looking at the stated focal 
length — no digital-to-film conversion math is 
required.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Portrait and Close Up modes are designed to produce shallow depth 
of field; Landscape mode is designed for large depth of field. You can’t 
adjust aperture in these modes, however, so you’re limited to the set-
ting the camera chooses. In addition, the extent to which the camera can 
select an appropriate f-stop depends on the lighting conditions. If you’re 
shooting in Landscape mode at dusk, for example, the camera may have 
to open the aperture to a wide setting to produce a good exposure.
 
✓ For greater background blurring, move the subject farther from the 
background. The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust 
depth of field also is affected by the distance between the subject and 
the background. For increased background blurring, move the subject 
farther in front of the background.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some aspects of digital photography — reso-
lution, aperture and shutter speed, depth of field, and so on — making sense 
of your camera’s color options is easy-breezy. First, color problems aren’t 
all that common, and when they are, they’re usually simple to fix with a 
quick shift of your D5000’s white balance control. And getting a grip on color 
requires learning only a couple of new terms, an unusual state of affairs for 
an endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned white balance control, 
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your 
camera renders colors. For information on how to use the Retouch menu’s 
color options to alter colors of existing pictures, see Chapter 10.
Correcting colors with 
white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast. 
The old-fashioned fluorescent lights found in 
most public restrooms, for example, put out a 
bluish-greenish light, which is why our reflec-
tions in the mirrors in those restrooms always 
look so sickly. And if you think that your 
beloved looks especially attractive by candle-
light, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight 
casts a warm, yellow-red glow that is flattering 
to the skin.
 
Science-y types measure the color of light, 
officially known as color temperature, on the 
Kelvin scale, which is named after its creator. 
You can see the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
When photographers talk about “warm light” and “cool light,” though, they 
aren’t referring to the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least not in the way 
we usually think of temperatures, with a higher number meaning hotter. Instead, 
the terms describe the visual appearance of the light. Warm light, produced by 
candles and incandescent lights, falls in the red-yellow spectrum you see at the 
bottom of the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-16; cool light, in the blue-green spectrum, 
appears at the top of the Kelvin scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these fluctuating colors of light because 
our eyes automatically compensate for them. Except in very extreme light-
ing conditions, a white tablecloth appears white to us no matter whether we 
view it by candlelight, fluorescent light, or regular houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for different colors of light through 
a feature known as white balancing. Simply put, white balancing neutralizes 
light so that whites are always white, which in turn ensures that other colors 
are rendered accurately. If the camera senses warm light, it shifts colors 
slightly to the cool side of the color spectrum; in cool light, the camera shifts 
colors the opposite direction.
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s Auto white balance 
setting tackles this process remarkably well in most situations, which means 
that you can usually ignore it and concentrate on other aspects of your pic-
ture. But if your scene is lit by two or more light sources that cast different 
colors, the white balance sensor can get confused, producing an unwanted 
color cast like the one you see in the left image in Figure 6-17.
I shot this product image in my home studio, which I light primarily with a 
couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten bulbs, which produce 
light with a color temperature similar to regular household incandescent 
bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also permit some pretty 
strong daylight to filter through. In Auto white balance mode, the camera 
reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color cast — and applied too 
much warming, giving my original image a yellow tint. No problem: I just 
switched the white balance mode from Auto to the Incandescent setting. The 
right image in Figure 6-17 shows the corrected colors.
 
There’s one little problem with white balancing as it’s implemented on your 
D5000, though. You can’t make this kind of manual white balance selection 
if you shoot in the Auto mode or the Digital Vari-Program scene modes. So if 
you spy color problems in your camera monitor, you need to switch to either 
P, S, A, or M exposure mode. (Chapter 5 details all four modes.)
The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance 
correction; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance 
options.

 To change the white balance, one 
option is to use the Quick Settings 
screen. When the Shooting Settings 
screen is displayed, press the Infor-
mation Edit button to shift to Quick 
Settings mode. Then use the Multi 
Selector to highlight the white bal-
ance option, as shown on the left of 
Figure 6-19. Press OK to display the 
menu shown on the right of Figure 
6-19, highlight the desired setting, 
and press OK.
You also can adjust the White 
Balance setting through the Shooting 
menu. Just highlight White Balance on the menu, press OK to display a 
screen listing all the settings, highlight your choice, and press OK.
 
 
Figure 6-19: You can modify White Balance to suit the ambient lighting.
 
Going the menu route gives you access to a couple of White Balance options 
not available through the Quick Settings screen. For example, if you choose 
the Fluorescent setting, you can select from seven types of bulbs. After 
selecting Fluorescent, as shown on the left in Figure 6-20, press OK to display 
the list of bulbs, as shown on the right. Select the option that most closely 
Figure 6-18: This icon represents the current 
white balance setting.

186
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
matches your bulbs and then press OK. This time, you’re taken to a screen 
where you can fine-tune the setting even more. I explain the fine-tuning steps 
in the next section. If you don’t want to make any further adjustment, just 
press OK to exit the fine-tuning screen and return to the Shooting menu. 
 
 
Figure 6-20: If you adjust the White Balance setting through the Shooting menu, you can select 
 
a specific type of fluorescent bulb.
 
After you select a fluorescent bulb type, that option is always used when you 
change white balance through the Shooting Information display (as outlined 
previously) and choose the Fluorescent white balance setting. Again, you can 
change the bulb type only through the Shooting menu.
Selecting the PRE option on the menu (left screen in Figure 6-20) enables you 
to create and store a precise, customized white balance setting, as explained 
in the upcoming “Creating white balance presets” section. This setting is the 
fastest way to achieve accurate colors when your scene is lit by multiple light 
sources that have differing color temperatures. 
 
Your selected white balance setting remains in force for the P, S, A, and M 
exposure modes until you change it. So you may want to get in the habit of 
resetting the option to the Auto setting after you finish shooting whatever 
subject it was that caused you to switch to manual white balance mode.
Fine-tuning white balance settings
You can fine-tune any white balance setting (Direct Sunlight, Cloudy, and 
so on) except a custom preset that you create through the PRE option. For 
the greatest amount of control, make the adjustment as spelled out in these 
steps: 
 
1. Display the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
2. Highlight the white balance setting you want to adjust, as shown on 
the left in Figure 6-21, and press OK.

187
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 Now you’re taken to a screen where you can do your fine-tuning, as 
shown on the right in Figure 6-21.
 
 
Figure 6-21: You can fine-tune the white balance settings via the Shooting menu.
 
 If you select Fluorescent, you first go to a screen where you select a spe-
cific type of bulb, as covered in the preceding section. After you high-
light your choice, press OK to get to the fine-tuning screen. 
 
3. Fine-tune the setting by using the Multi Selector to move the white 
balance shift marker in the color grid.
 
 The grid is set up around two color pairs: Green and Magenta, rep-
resented by G and M; and Blue and Amber, represented by B and A. 
By pressing the Multi Selector, you can move the adjustment marker 
around the grid. 
 
 As you move the marker, the A–B and G–M boxes on the right side of 
the screen show you the current amount of color shift. A value of 0 indi-
cates the default amount of color compensation applied by the selected 
white balance setting. In Figure 6-21, for example, I moved the marker 
two levels toward amber and two levels toward magenta to specify that I 
wanted colors to be a tad warmer.
 
 If you’re familiar with traditional colored lens filters, you may know that 
the density of a filter, which determines the degree of color correction it 
provides, is measured in mireds (pronounced my-redds). The white bal-
ance grid is designed around this system: Moving the marker one level is 
the equivalent of adding a filter with a density of 5 mireds.
 
4. Press OK to complete the adjustment.
After you adjust a white balance setting, an asterisk appears next to that set-
ting in the White Balance menu and the Shooting Information display.

188
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
By using a feature called white balance bracketing, you can automatically 
record one picture with no shift, one with an amber shift, and one with a blue 
shift. See the later section “Bracketing white balance” for details.
Creating white balance presets
 
If none of the standard white balance settings do the trick and you don’t want 
to fool with fine-tuning them, take advantage of the PRE (Preset Manual) fea-
ture. This option enables you to do two things:
 
✓ Base white balance on a direct measurement of the actual lighting 
conditions.
 
✓ Match white balance to an existing photo. 
 The next two sections provide you with the step-by-step instructions.
Setting white balance with direct measurement
To use this technique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral 
gray or absolute white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-
but-not-perfect white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this pur-
pose in many camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for 
your photo. Then take these steps:
 
1. Set the camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
 
 If the exposure meter reports that your image will be under- or overex-
posed at the current exposure settings, make the necessary adjustments 
now. (Chapter 5 tells you how.) Otherwise, the camera won’t be able to 
create your custom white balance preset.
 
2. Frame your shot so that the reference card completely fills the 
viewfinder.
 
3. From the Shooting menu, select White Balance, press OK, and select 
the PRE (Preset Manual) white balance setting, as shown on the left in 
Figure 6-22. 
 
4. Press the Multi Selector right, select Measure, as shown on the right in 
the figure, and press OK.
 
 A warning appears, asking you if you want to overwrite existing data.
 
5. Select Yes and press OK.
 
 You see another message, this time telling you to take your picture. 
You’ve got about six seconds to do so. (The letters PRE flash in the view-
finder and Shooting Information display to let you know the camera’s 
ready to record your white balance reference image.)

189
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 
Figure 6-22: Select these options to set white balance by measuring a white or gray card.
 
 If the camera is successful at recording the white balance data, the let-
ters Gd flash in the viewfinder and the message “Data Acquired” appears 
in the Shooting Information display. If the camera couldn’t set the 
custom white balance, you instead see the message No Gd in the view-
finder, and a message in the Shooting Information display urges you to 
try again. Try adjusting your lighting before doing so.
After you complete the process, the 
camera automatically sets the White 
Balance option to PRE so you can 
begin using your preset. You see the 
letters PRE in the White Balance area 
of the Shooting Information display, 
as shown in Figure 6-23.
 
Any time you want to select and use 
the preset, switch to the PRE white 
balance setting. Your custom setting 
is stored in the camera until you over-
ride it with a new preset.
Matching white balance 
to an existing photo
Suppose that you’re the marketing manager for a small business, and one of 
your jobs is to shoot portraits of the company big-wigs for the annual report. 
You build a small studio just for that purpose, complete with a couple of pho-
tography lights and a nice, conservative beige backdrop.
Of course, the big-wigs can’t all come to get their pictures taken in the same 
month, let alone on the same day. But you have to make sure that the colors 
in that beige backdrop remain consistent for each shot, no matter how much 
time passes between photo sessions. This scenario is one possible use for an 
advanced white balance feature that enables you to base white balance on an 
existing photo.
Figure 6-23: Select the PRE (Preset Manual) 
option to use your custom white balance 
setting.

190
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Basing white balance on an existing photo works well only in strictly con-
trolled lighting situations, where the color temperature of your lights is con-
sistent from day to day. Otherwise, the white balance setting that produces 
color accuracy when you shoot Big Boss Number One may add an ugly color 
cast to the one you snap of Big Boss Number Two.
To give this option a try, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the picture that you want to use as the reference photo to your 
camera memory card, if it isn’t already stored there.
 
 You can copy the picture to the card using a card reader and whatever 
method you usually use to transfer files from one drive to another. Copy 
the file to the folder named 100D5000 (default folder name), inside the 
main folder, named DCIM by default. (See Chapter 8 for help with working 
with files and folders.)
 
2. Open the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
3. Select PRE (Preset Manual) and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 The submenu shown on the left in Figure 6-24 appears.
 
 
Figure 6-24: You can create a white balance preset based on an existing photo.
 
4. Highlight Use Photo and press OK.
 
 The options shown on the right in Figure 6-24 appear. 
 
5. Select the photo you want to use as your reference image.
 
 If the photo appears on the screen already, highlight This Image and 
press OK.
 
 Alternatively, highlight Select Image and then press the Multi Selector 
right to access screens that let you navigate to the photo you want to 
use as a basis for white balance. Press OK to return to the screen shown 
on the right in Figure 6-24.

191
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
6. Press OK to set the preset white balance based on the selected photo.
Whenever you want to base white balance on your selected photo, just set 
the White Balance setting to the PRE option.
Bracketing white balance
Chapter 5 introduces you to your camera’s automatic bracketing feature, 
which enables you to easily record the same image at several different expo-
sure settings. In addition to being able to bracket autoexposure and Active 
D-Lighting settings, you can use the feature to bracket white balance. 
 
Note a couple of things about this feature:
 
✓ You can bracket JPEG shots only. You can’t use white balance bracket-
ing if you set the camera’s Image Quality setting to either RAW (NEF) or 
RAW+Fine. And frankly, there isn’t any need to do so because you can 
precisely tune colors of RAW files when you process them in your RAW 
converter. Chapter 8 has details on RAW processing.
 
✓ You can apply white balance bracketing only along the blue-to-amber 
axis of the fine-tuning color grid. You can’t shift colors along the green-
to-magenta axis, as you can when tweaking a specific white balance 
setting. (For a reminder of this feature, refer to the earlier section “Fine-
tuning white balance settings.”)
 
✓ For each bracketed series, you get one “neutral” shot, one shifted 
toward amber, and one shifted toward blue. By “neutral,” I mean that 
the image is recorded at the current White Balance setting, without any 
bracketing adjustment.
 
✓ You can choose from increments of 1 (WB1), 2 (WB2), and 3 (WB3). A 
higher number produces a greater color shift.
I used white balance bracketing to record the three candle photos in Figure 
6-25, setting the bracketing to shift colors the maximum three steps. As you 
can see, even at that maximum setting, the color differences between the 
shots are subtle. In this photo, I find the differences most noticeable in the 
color of the backdrop.
To bracket white balance, follow these steps:
 
1. Set your camera to the P, S, A, or M exposure mode.
 
 White balance options are available only in these modes.
 
2. Set the Image Quality setting to one of the JPEG options (Fine, 
Normal, or Basic).
 
 You can adjust the setting through the Quick Settings screen or Shooting 
menu. (See Chapter 3 for a full explanation of the JPEG options.)

 The bracketing feature is now set up to adjust white balance between your 
bracketed shots. (Exposure and Active D-Lighting are not bracketed.)
 
6. Use the Quick Settings screen to set the amount of color shift you want 
for your bracketed images.
 
 
 After displaying the Shooting Information screen, press the Information 
Edit button to get to Quick Settings mode. Then use the Multi Selector to 
highlight the BKT option, as shown on the left in Figure 6-27.

Figure 6-27.
 
8. Highlight the desired increment.
 
 Again, WB1 is the smallest increment between color temperatures, and 
WB3 has the greatest increment between color temperatures. 
 
9. Press the shutter button once to record your first bracketed series.
 
 Each press of the shutter button records the image three times, once at 
a neutral white balance, once with an amber bias, and once with a blue 
bias. If you inspect the photo metadata, the white balance values for the 
bracketed shots will show A (1, 2, or 3) or B (1, 2, or 3).
 
Your bracketing option remains in effect even after you shut the camera off. 
When you’re finished taking the pictures that need bracketing, remember 
to disable bracketing. Just revisit the Quick Settings screen and then set the 
BKT option to Off, as shown on the right in Figure 6-27.

194
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB vs. Adobe RGB
By default, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which 
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for stan-
dard, and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which are the primary colors in the 
digital color world.) The sRGB color mode was created to help ensure color 
consistency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to monitor and 
printer; the idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all of these devices 
can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative, 
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which 
includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors. Figure 6-28 offers an illustra-
tion of the two spectrums.
 
Visible Spectrum
Adobe RGB
sRGB
 
Figure 6-28: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the 
 
sRGB spectrum.

195
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Some colors in the Adobe RGB spectrum cannot be reproduced in print. (The 
printer just substitutes the closest printable color, if necessary.) Still, I usu-
ally shoot in Adobe RGB mode because I see no reason to limit myself to a 
smaller spectrum from the get-go.
However, just because I use Adobe RGB doesn’t mean that it’s right for you. 
First, if you plan to print and share your photos without making any adjust-
ments in your photo editor, you’re usually better off sticking with sRGB, 
because most printers and Web browsers are designed around that color 
space. Second, know that in order to retain all your original Adobe RGB 
colors when you work with your photos, your editing software must support 
that color space — not all programs do. You also must be willing to study the 
whole topic of digital color a little bit because you need to use some specific 
settings to avoid really mucking up the color works.
If you want to go with Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, visit the Shooting menu 
and highlight the Color Space option, as shown on the left in Figure 6-29. 
Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the figure. Select Adobe 
RGB and press OK again.
 
 
Figure 6-29: Choose Adobe RGB for a broader color spectrum.
 
You can tell whether you captured an image in the Adobe RGB format by 
looking at its filename: Adobe RGB images start with an underscore, as in 
_DSC0627.jpg. For pictures captured in the sRGB color space, the underscore 
appears in the middle of the filename, as in DSC_0627.jpg. See Chapter 4 for 
more tips on decoding picture filenames.

196
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Taking a Quick Look at Picture Controls
A feature that Nikon calls Picture Controls offers one more way to tweak image 
sharpening, color, and contrast when you shoot in the P, S, A, and M expo-
sure modes and choose one of the JPEG options for the Image Quality setting. 
(Chapter 3 explains the Image Quality setting.)
 
Sharpening, in case you’re new to the digital meaning of the term, refers to 
a software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates the illusion of 
slightly sharper focus. I emphasize, “slightly sharper focus.” Sharpening pro-
duces a subtle tweak, and it’s not a fix for poor focus.
You can select a Picture Control from the Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 
6-30, or through the Quick Settings display, as shown in Figure 6-31. See 
Chapter 1 if you need help navigating menus or the Quick Settings display.
 
 
Figure 6-30: Picture Controls apply preset adjustments to color, sharpening, and other photo 
 
characteristics to images you shoot in the JPEG file format. 
 
 
Figure 6-31: You can access the Picture Control options through the Quick Settings display, too.

197
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Whichever route you go, you can choose from six Picture Controls, which 
produce the following results:
 
✓ Standard: The default setting for the P, S, A, and M exposure modes, this 
option captures the image normally — that is, using the characteristics 
that Nikon offers up as suitable for the majority of subjects. You also are 
assigned this mode if you shoot in the Auto, No Flash, Sports, Child, and 
Close Up exposure modes.
 
✓ Neutral: At this setting, the camera doesn’t enhance color, contrast, and 
sharpening as much as in the other modes. The setting is designed for 
people who want to precisely manipulate these picture characteristics 
in a photo editor. By not overworking colors, sharpening, and so on 
when producing your original file, the camera delivers an original that 
gives you more latitude in the digital darkroom.
 
✓ Vivid: In this mode, the camera amps up color saturation, contrast, and 
sharpening.
 
✓ Monochrome: This setting produces black-and-white photos. Only in the 
digital world, they’re called grayscale images because a true black-and-
white image contains only black and white, with no shades of gray.
 
 I’m not keen on creating grayscale images this way. I prefer to shoot in 
full color and then do my own grayscale conversion in my photo editor. 
That technique just gives you more control over the look of your black-
and-white photos. Assuming that you work with a decent photo editor, 
you can control what original tones are emphasized in your grayscale 
version, for example. Additionally, keep in mind that you can always 
convert a color image to grayscale, but you can’t go the other direction. 
You can create a black-and-white copy of your color image right in the 
camera, in fact; Chapter 10 shows you how.
 
✓ Portrait: This mode tweaks colors and sharpening in a way that is 
designed to produce nice skin texture and pleasing skin tones. (If you 
shoot in the Portrait or Night Portrait automatic exposure modes, the 
camera selects this Picture Control for you.)
 
✓ Landscape: This mode emphasizes blues and greens. As you might 
expect, it’s the mode used by the Landscape Digital Vari-Program mode.
The extent to which Picture Controls affect your image depends on the sub-
ject as well as the exposure settings you choose and the lighting conditions. 
But Figure 6-32 gives you a general idea of what to expect. As you can see, the 
differences between the various Picture Controls are pretty subtle, with the 
exception of the Monochrome option, of course.

  Figure 6-32: Each Picture Control produces a slightly different take on the scene.
Personally, I think that the Standard Picture Control is just ducky, and I rarely 
use the others. And frankly, I suggest that you do the same. First off, you’ve 
got way more important camera settings to worry about — aperture, shut-
ter speed, autofocus, and all the rest. Why add one more setting to your list, 
especially when the impact of changing it is minimal?

199
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Second, if you really want to mess with the characteristics that the Picture 
Control options affect, you’re much better off shooting in the RAW (NEF) 
format and then making those adjustments on a picture-by-picture basis 
in your RAW converter. In Nikon ViewNX, you can even assign any of the 
existing Picture Controls to your RAW files and then compare how each one 
affects the image. The camera does tag your RAW file with whatever Picture 
Control is active at the time you take the shot, but the image adjustments are 
in no way set in stone, or even in sand — you can tweak your photo at will. 
(The selected Picture Control does affect the JPEG preview that’s used to dis-
play the RAW image thumbnails in ViewNX and other browsers.) 
For these reasons, I’m opting in this book to present you with just this brief 
introduction to Picture Controls so that I can go into more detail about func-
tions that I see as more useful (such as the white balance customization 
options presented earlier). But if you’re intrigued, know that you also can 
create your very own, customized Picture Controls. The camera manual 
walks you step by step through the process.

▶ Reviewing the best all-around picture-taking settings
▶ Adjusting the camera for portrait photography
▶ Discovering the keys to super action shots
▶ Dialing in the right settings to capture landscapes and other scenic vistas
▶ Capturing close-up views of your subject
▶ Shooting through glass, capturing fireworks, and conquering other special challenges
E
arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking 
feature on your D5000, describing in detail how the various controls 
affect exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter pulls 
all that information together to help you set up your camera for 
specific types of photography.
The first section offers a quick summary of critical 
picture-taking settings that should serve you well no 
matter what your subject. Following that, I offer my 
advice on which settings to use for portraits, 
action shots, landscapes, and close-ups. To wrap 
things up, the end of the chapter includes some 
miscellaneous tips for dealing with special shoot-
ing situations and subjects.
Keep in mind that although I present specific recom-
mendations here, there are no hard and fast rules as 
to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a landscape, or 
whatever. So feel free to wander off on your own, tweak-
ing this exposure setting or adjusting that focus control, to 
discover your own creative vision. Experimentation is part of 
the fun of photography, after all — and thanks to your camera moni-
tor and the Delete button, it’s an easy, completely free proposition.

Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which 
settings you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture 
and shutter speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. 
But for many basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost 
every shooting scenario. Table 7-1 shows you those recommendations and 
also lists the chapter where you can find details about each setting.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the 
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a 
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed, that 
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically 
produce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, 
landscapes, and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along 
the way — but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, 
and for every so-called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the 
exception.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Shooting still portraits
By still portrait, I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who aren’t 
keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children, pets, 
and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and use 
the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture 
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus. This artistic choice emphasizes the subject and helps 
diminish the impact of any distracting background objects in cases where 
you can’t control the setting. The following steps show you how to achieve 
this look: 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to A (aperture-priority autoexposure) and select the 
lowest f-stop value possible.
 
 As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop setting opens the aperture, which 
not only allows more light to enter the camera but also shortens depth 
of field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low f-stop value is 
the first step in softening your portrait background. (The f-stop range 
available to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind that the 
farther your subject is from the background, the more blurring you 
can achieve. 
 
 I recommend aperture-priority mode when depth of field is a primary 
concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on the camera 
to select the shutter speed that will properly expose the image. Just 
rotate the Command dial to select your desired f-stop. (You do need to 
pay attention to shutter speed also, however, to make sure that it’s not 
so slow that any movement of the subject or camera will blur the image.)
 
 If you aren’t comfortable with this advanced exposure mode, Portrait 
and Child mode also result in a more open aperture, although the exact 
f-stop setting is out of your control. You should note, too, that both of 
those modes make subtle adjustments to color and sharpening that may 
or may not be what you have in mind. See Chapter 2 for details.
 
 Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current f-stop and 
shutter speed on the Shooting Information display and in the viewfinder, 
as shown in Figure 7-1. 
 
2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both. 
 
 As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces 
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.

204
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Shutter speed
Aperture
 
Figure 7-1: You can monitor aperture and shutter speed settings in two places.
 
 A lens with a focal length of 85–120mm is ideal for a classic head and 
shoulders portrait. But don’t fret if you have only the 18-55mm kit lens; 
just zoom in all the way to the 55mm setting. You should avoid using a 
much shorter focal length (a wider-angle lens) for portraits. They can 
cause features to appear distorted — sort of like how people look when 
you view them through a security peephole in a door.
 
3. For indoor portraits, shoot 
flash-free if possible.
 
 Shooting by available light 
rather than flash produces 
softer illumination and avoids 
the problem of red-eye. To get 
enough light to go flash-free, 
turn on room lights or, during 
daylight, pose your subject next 
to a sunny window, as I did for 
the image in Figure 7-2.
 
 In the A exposure mode, simply 
keeping the built-in flash unit 
closed disables the flash. In 
Portrait and Child modes, the 
camera automatically pops up 
the flash unit in dim lighting. To 
disable the flash, in those 
modes, the easiest option is to 
press the Flash button as you 
rotate the Command dial to 
select the Off setting. (You can 
view the current setting in the 
Shooting Information display.)
Figure 7-2: For more pleasing indoor portraits, 
shoot by available light instead of using flash.

205
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 If flash is unavoidable, see my list of flash tips at the end of the steps to 
get better results.
 
4. For outdoor portraits, use a flash if possible.
 
 Even in daylight, a flash adds a beneficial pop of light to subjects’ faces, 
as illustrated in Figure 7-3.
 
 In the A exposure mode, you can just press the Flash button on the side 
of the camera to enable the flash. For daytime portraits, use the fill flash 
setting. (That’s the regular, basic flash mode.) For nighttime images, try 
red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode; again, see the flash tips at the end 
of these steps to use either mode most effectively.
 
 Unfortunately, Portrait and Child mode use Auto flash, and if the 
ambient light is very bright, the flash may not fire. Switch to an 
advanced exposure mode (P, S, A, or M) to regain flash control. But 
do note that whatever exposure mode you use, the top shutter 
speed available when you use the built-in flash is 1/200 second, so 
in extremely bright light, you may need to stop down the aperture to 
avoid overexposing the photo. Doing so, of course, brings the back-
ground into sharper focus. So try to move the subject into a shaded 
area instead.

5. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to initiate exposure 
metering and autofocusing. 
 
 Make sure that an active autofocus point falls over your subject. Chapter 
6 explains more about autofocus, but if you have trouble, simply set 
your lens to manual focus mode and then twist the focusing ring to set 
focus. See Chapter 1 for help with manual focusing.
 
6. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to capture the image.
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A 
few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 
✓ Pay attention to the background. Scan the entire frame looking for 
intrusive objects that may distract the eye from the subject. If neces-
sary, reposition the subject against a more flattering backdrop. Inside, a 
softly textured wall works well; outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide 
nice backdrops as long as they aren’t so ornate or colorful that they 
diminish the subject (for example, a magnolia tree laden with blooms).
 
✓ Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and 
ambient light. If you set the white balance setting to Auto, as I recom-
mend in Table 7-1, enabling flash tells the camera to warm colors to 
compensate for the cool light of a flash. If your subject is also lit by 
room lights or sunlight, the result may be colors that are slightly warmer 
than neutral. This warming effect typically looks nice in portraits, giving 
the skin a subtle glow. But if you aren’t happy with the result or want 
even more warming, see Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-tune white 
balance. Again, you can make this adjustment only in P, S, A, or M 
exposure modes.
 
✓ When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results. 
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
 
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambient 
light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the 
picture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further 
reducing the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance 
warning, however.) As an added benefit, the smaller pupil allows 
more of the subject’s iris to be visible in the portrait, so you see 
more eye color.
 
• Try setting the flash to red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode. If you 
choose the first option, warn your subject to expect both a prelimi-
nary pop of light from the AF-assist lamp, which constricts pupils, 
and the actual flash. And remember that slow-sync flash uses a 
slower-than-normal shutter speed, which produces softer lighting 
and brighter backgrounds than normal flash. (Chapter 5 has an 

207
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
example.) This mode is available in P and A exposure modes and is 
also the default setting in Night Portrait mode.
 
 Remember that the slow shutter speed of slow-sync mode means 
that you should use a tripod and ask your subject to stay very still 
to avoid blurring.
 
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash 
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light 
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. 
An external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase 
worthwhile if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two 
portraits in Figure 7-4 for an illustration. In the first example, the 
built-in flash resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and 
harsh, concentrated light. To produce the better result on the 
right, I used the Nikon Speedlight SB-600 and bounced the light 
off the ceiling. 
 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther from 
the background. I took this extra step for the right image in Figure 
7-4. The increased distance not only reduced shadowing but also 
softened the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short depth of 
field resulting from my f-stop and focal length).
 
 
Figure 7-4: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce flash and 
 
moved the subject farther from the background (right).

208
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from 
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible, 
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack 
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less 
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s 
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting 
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.
 
✓ Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of 
frame sizes. Your D5000 produces images that have an aspect ratio of 
3:2. That means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size 
but will require cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 
or 8 x 10. Chapter 9 talks more about this issue.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving 
subject, whether it’s your tennis-playing teen, a spinning Ferris wheel, or, as 
in the case of Figure 7-5, a flock of ducks in flight.  
 
Doug Sahlin
 
Figure 7-5: Use a high shutter speed to freeze motion.

209
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, try the techniques 
in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:
 
1. Set the Mode dial to S (shutter-priority autoexposure).
 
 In this mode, you control the shutter speed, and the camera takes care 
of choosing an aperture setting that will produce a good exposure. 
 
 If you aren’t ready to step up to this advanced exposure mode, 
explained in Chapter 5, try using Sports mode, detailed in Chapter 2. 
But be aware that you have no control over many other aspects of 
your picture (such as white balance, flash, and so on) in that mode.
 
2. Rotate the Command dial to select the shutter speed.
 
 (Refer to Figure 7-1 to locate shutter speed in the viewfinder and 
Shooting Information display.) After you select the shutter speed, the 
camera selects an aperture (f-stop) to match.
 
 What shutter speed do you need exactly? Well, it depends on the speed 
at which your subject is moving, so some experimentation is needed. 
But generally speaking, 1/500 second should be plenty for all but the 
fastest subjects (race cars, boats, and so on). For very slow subjects, 
you can even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second.
 
3. Raise the ISO setting or add flash to produce a brighter exposure, if 
needed.
 
 In dim lighting, you may not be able to get a good exposure without 
taking this step; the camera simply may not be able to open the aperture 
wide enough to accommodate a fast shutter speed. Raising the ISO 
does increase the possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is better than a 
blurry shot. 
 
 Adding flash is a bit tricky for action shots, unfortunately. First, the flash 
needs time to recycle between shots, so try to go without if you want 
to capture images at a fast pace. Second, the built-in flash has limited 
range — so don’t waste your time if your subject isn’t close by. And 
third, remember that the fastest shutter speed you can use with flash 
is 1/200 second, which may not be high enough to capture a quickly 
moving subject without blur. 
 
 If you do decide to use flash, you must bail out of Sports mode; it 
doesn’t permit you to use flash.
 
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Release mode to the Continuous 
setting.
 
 In this mode, you can capture multiple images with a single press of 
the shutter button. As long as you hold down the button, the camera 
continues to record images. Here again, though, you need to go flash-
free; you can’t use the Continuous capture mode with flash because it 
isn’t compatible with flash photogography.

210
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
5. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
 
 Manual focusing eliminates the time the camera needs to lock focus in 
autofocus mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you 
need help.
 
 If you do use autofocus, try these two autofocus settings for best 
performance:
 
• Set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area. 
 
• Set the Focus mode to AF-C (continuous-servo autofocus).
 
 Chapter 6 details these autofocus options. Note that you can control the 
Focus mode only in the advanced exposure modes. In the other modes, 
the camera should automatically switch to continuous-servo autofocus 
when it senses movement in front of the lens, however.
 
6. Turn off Image Review.
 
 You turn off Image Review via the Playback menu. Turning the option 
off can help speed up the time your camera needs to recover between 
shots. 
 
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
 
 In Figure 7-5, for example, the wide view ensured that the ducks 
wouldn’t fly out of the frame. It’s also a good idea to leave more room 
in front of the subject than behind it. This makes it obvious that your 
subject is going somewhere.
 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any 
fast-moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for 
shooting candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently 
running, leaping, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do 
move or change positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches 
your eye, set your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series 
of shots as fast as you can.
For example, one recent afternoon, I spotted my furball and his equally fluffy 
new neighbor introducing themselves to each other through the fence that 
separates their yards. I ran and grabbed my camera, flipped it into shutter-
priority mode, and just started shooting. Most of the images were throw-
aways; you can see some of them in Figure 7-6. But somewhere around the 
tenth frame, I captured the moment you see in Figure 7-7, which puts a whole 
new twist on the phrase “gossiping over the backyard fence.” Two seconds 
later, the dogs got bored with each other and scampered away into their 
respective yards, but thanks to a fast shutter, I got the shot that I wanted.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky 
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch 
of countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, 
for example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all 
buildings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might 
prefer to shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply 
focused while the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first 
building.
That said, I can offer a few tips to help you photograph a landscape the way 
you see it:
 
✓ Shoot in aperture-priority autoexposure mode (A) so that you can 
control depth of field. If you want extreme depth of field, so that both 
near and distant objects are sharply focused, as in Figure 7-8, select a 
high f-stop value. For short depth of field, use a low value. 
 
 You can also use Landscape mode to achieve the first objective. In this 
mode, the camera automatically selects a high f-stop number, but you 
have no control over the exact value (or certain other picture-taking 
settings). And in dim lighting, the camera may be forced to select a low 
f-stop setting.
 
 
Doug Sahlin
 
Figure 7-8: Use a high f-stop value (or Landscape mode) to keep foreground and background 
 
sharply focused.

213
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
✓ If the exposure requires a slow shutter, use a tripod to avoid blurring. 
The downside to a high f-stop is that you need a slower shutter speed 
to produce a good exposure. If the shutter speed drops below what 
you can comfortably hand-hold, use a tripod to avoid picture-blurring 
camera shake. Remember that when you use a tripod, Nikon recom-
mends that you turn Vibration Reduction off.
 
 No tripod handy? Look for any solid surface on which you can steady 
the camera. Of course, you can always increase the ISO Sensitivity 
setting to allow a faster shutter, too, but that option brings with it the 
chances of increased image noise. See Chapter 5 for details.
 
✓ For dramatic waterfall shots, 
consider using a slow shutter to 
create that “misty” look. The 
slow shutter blurs the water, 
giving it a soft, romantic appear-
ance, as shown in Figure 7-9. 
Again, use a tripod to ensure that 
the rest of the scene doesn’t also 
blur due to camera shake. You 
can also use a slow shutter speed 
to capture dramatic photographs 
of waves coming ashore.
 
 In very bright light, you may over-
expose the image at a very slow 
shutter, even if you stop the aper-
ture all the way down and select 
the camera’s lowest ISO setting. 
As a solution, consider investing 
in a neutral density filter for your 
lens. This type of filter works 
something like sunglasses for 
your camera: It simply reduces 
the amount of light that passes 
through the lens, without affect-
ing image colors, so that you can 
use a slower shutter than would 
otherwise be possible.
 
✓ At sunrise or sunset, base exposure on the sky. The foreground will 
be dark, but you can usually brighten it in a photo editor if needed. 
If you base exposure on the foreground, on the other hand, the sky will 
become so bright that all the color will be washed out — a problem you 
usually can’t fix after the fact.
 
 Also experiment with different levels of Active-D Lighting adjustment. 
Chapter 5 explains this feature, which brightens dark areas in a way that 
doesn’t blow out highlights, leaving your sky colors intact. You can 
adjust the setting only in the P, S, A, and M exposure modes. 
Figure 7-9: For misty waterfalls, use a slow 
shutter speed and a tripod.

214
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ For cool nighttime city pics, experiment with slow shutter. Assuming 
that cars or other vehicles are moving through the scene, the result is 
neon trails of light like those you see in the foreground of the image in 
Figure 7-10. Shutter speed for this image was about 10 seconds.
 
 Instead of changing the shutter speed manually between each shot, try 
bulb mode. Available only in M (manual) exposure mode, this option 
records an image for as long as you hold down the shutter button. So 
just take a series of images, holding the button down for different 
lengths of time for each shot. In bulb mode, you also can exceed the 
standard maximum shutter speed of 30 seconds.
 
✓ For the best lighting, shoot during the “magic hours.” That’s the term 
photographers use for early morning and late afternoon, when the light 
cast by the sun is soft and warm, giving everything that beautiful, gently 
warmed look.
 
 Can’t wait for the perfect light? Tweak your camera’s white balance 
setting, using the instructions laid out in Chapter 6, to simulate magic-
hour light.
 
✓ In tricky light, bracket exposures. Bracketing simply means to take 
the same picture at several different exposures to increase the odds 
that at least one of them will capture the scene the way you envision. 
Bracketing is especially a good idea in difficult lighting situations such 
as sunrise and sunset.
 
Doug Sahlin
 
Figure 7-10: A slow shutter also creates neon light trails in city-street scenes.

215
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 In P, S, A, and M modes, you can take advantage of automatic bracketing. 
See the end of Chapter 5 for details. 
Capturing dynamic close-ups
For great close-up shots, try these techniques:
 
✓ Check your owner’s manual to find out the minimum close-focusing 
distance of your lens. How “up close and personal” you can get to your 
subject depends on your lens, not the camera body itself. 
 
✓ Take control over depth of field by setting the camera mode to A 
(aperture-priority autoexposure) mode. Whether you want a shallow, 
medium, or extreme depth of field depends on the point of your photo. 
In classic nature photography, for example, the artistic tradition 
is a very shallow depth of field, 
as shown in Figure 7-11, and 
requires an open aperture (low 
f-stop value). But if you want 
the viewer to be able to clearly 
see all details throughout the 
frame — for example, if you’re 
shooting a product shot for 
your company’s sales catalog — 
you need to go the other 
direction, stopping down the 
aperture as far as possible.
 
 Not ready for the advanced 
exposure modes yet? Try Close 
Up mode instead. (It’s the one 
marked with the little flower on 
your Mode dial.) In this mode, 
the camera automatically opens 
the aperture to achieve a short 
depth of field and bases focus 
on the center of the frame. As 
with all the other automatic 
exposure modes, though, the 
range of apertures available to 
the camera depends on the 
lighting conditions.
Figure 7-11: Shallow depth of field is a classic 
technique for close-up floral images.

216
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Remember that zooming in and getting close to your subject both 
decrease depth of field. So back to that product shot: If you need depth 
of field beyond what you can achieve with the aperture setting, you may 
need to back away, zoom out, or both. (You can always crop your image 
to show just the parts of the subject that you want to feature.)
 
✓ When shooting flowers and other nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your subject 
to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds. 
 
✓ Use flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny bit of 
flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary light 
source. Again, though, keep in mind that the maximum shutter speed 
possible when you use flash is 1/200 second. So in very bright light, you 
may need to use a high f-stop setting to avoid overexposing the picture. 
If you shoot in an advanced exposure mode (P, S, A, or M), you can also 
adjust the flash output via the Flash Compensation control. Chapter 5 
offers details.
 
✓ When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light source. 
Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your flash may be 
too harsh even at a low Flash Compensation setting. If flash is inevitable, 
turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce the flash power that’s 
needed — even a hardware-store shop light can do in a pinch as a lighting 
source. (Remember that if you 
have multiple light sources, 
though, you may need to tweak 
the white balance setting.)
 
✓ To really get close to your sub-
ject, invest in a macro lens or a 
set of diopters. A true macro 
lens, which enables you to get 
really, really close to your sub-
jects, is an expensive proposi-
tion; expect to pay around $200 
or more. But if you enjoy cap-
turing the tiny details in life, it’s 
worth the investment. 
 
 For a less expensive way to go, 
you can spend about $40 for a 
set of diopters, which are sort of 
like reading glasses that you 
screw onto your existing lens. 
Diopters come in several 
strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so 
on — with a higher number 
indicating a greater magnifying 
power. I took this approach to 
capture the extreme close-up in 
Figure 7-12, attaching a +2 
Figure 7-12: To extend your lens’ close-focus 
ability, you can add magnifying diopters.

217
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
diopter to my lens. The downfall of diopters, sadly, is that they typically 
produce images that are very soft around the edges, a problem that 
doesn’t occur with a good macro lens.
Coping with Special Situations
A few subjects and shooting situations pose some additional challenges not 
already covered in earlier sections. So to wrap up this chapter, here’s a 
quick list of ideas for tackling a variety of common “tough-shot” photos:
 
✓ Shooting through glass: To capture subjects that are behind glass, such 
as the shark in Figure 7-13, try putting your lens flat against the glass. 
Before you do, switch to manual focusing; the glass barrier can give the 
autofocus mechanism fits. Disable your flash to avoid creating any 
unwanted reflections, too. 
 
✓ Shooting out a car window: Set the camera to shutter-priority auto-
exposure or manual mode and dial in a fast shutter speed to compensate 
for the movement of the car. Oh, and keep a tight grip on your camera. 
 
✓ Shooting fireworks: First off, use a tripod; fireworks require a long 
exposure, and trying to handhold your camera simply isn’t going to 
work. If using a zoom lens, zoom out to the shortest focal length (widest 
angle). Switch to manual focusing and set focus at infinity (the farthest 
focus point possible on your lens). Set the exposure mode to manual, 
choose a relatively high f-stop setting — say, f/16 or so — and start a 
shutter speed of 1 to 3 seconds. From there, it’s simply a matter of 
experimenting with different shutter speeds.
  
 Be especially gentle when you press the shutter button — with a very 
slow shutter, you can easily create enough camera movement to blur 
the image. If you purchased the accessory remote control for your 
camera, this is a good situation in which to use it. You can also set 
the self-timer to 2 seconds, which gives the camera time to stabilize 
after you press the shutter button. (See Chapter 2 for help with the 
self-timer setting.)
 
✓ Shooting reflective surfaces: In outdoor shots taken in bright sun, you 
can reduce glare from reflective surfaces such as glass and metal by 
using a circular polarizing filter, which you can buy for about $40. A 
polarizing filter can also help out when you’re shooting through glass.
 
 But know that in order for the filter to work, the sun, your subject, and 
your camera lens must be precisely positioned. Your lens must be at a 
90-degree angle from the sun, for example, and the light source must 
also be reflecting off the surface at a certain angle and direction. In 
addition, a polarizing filter also intensifies blue skies in some scenarios, 
which may or may not be to your liking. In other words, a polarizing 
filter isn’t a surefire cure-all.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Doug Sahlin
 
Figure 7-13: He’s watching you . . . 
 
 A more reliable option for shooting small reflective objects is to invest 
in a light cube or light tent such as the ones shown in Figure 7-14, from 
Cloud Dome (www.clouddome.com) and Lastolite (www.lastolite.com), 
respectively. You place the reflective object inside the tent or cube and 
then position your lights around the outside. The cube or tent acts as a 
light diffuser, reducing reflections. Prices range from about $50 to $200, 
depending on size and features.
 
✓ Shooting in strong backlighting: When the light behind your subject 
is very strong, the result is often an underexposed subject. You can try 
using flash to better expose the subject, assuming that you’re shooting 
in an exposure mode that permits flash. The Active D-Lighting feature,  
which captures the image in a way that retains better detail in the shad-
ows without blowing out highlights, may also help. (Chapter 5 offers an 
example.) If you shoot in the advanced exposure modes (P, S, A, or M), 
you can adjust the amount of the correction.
 
 But for another creative choice, you can purposely underexpose 
the subject to create a silhouette effect, as shown in Figure 7-15. Set 
your camera to an advanced exposure mode, disable flash and Active 
D-Lighting, and then base your exposure on the sky so that the darker 
areas of the frame remain dark.

Working with 
Picture Files

In this part . . .
You’ve got a memory card full of pictures. 
Now it’s time to download them to your com-
puter so that you can print and share them, as 
well as enjoy viewing them on something larger 
than the camera monitor. The ﬁ rst chapter in this 
part shows you how to get those pictures out 
of your camera and onto your computer and, just 
as important, how to safeguard them from future 
digital destruction. After downloading your ﬁ les, 
head for Chapter 9, which offers step-by-step guid-
ance on printing your pictures, sharing them 
online, and even viewing them on your television.

Downloading, Organizing, and 
Archiving Your Picture Files
In This Chapter
▶ Transferring pictures to your computer
▶ Using Nikon Transfer and ViewNX to download and organize photos
▶ Looking at other photo-management and editing programs
▶ Processing NEF (RAW) files
▶ Keeping your picture files safe from harm
F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced 
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then 
keeping track of all of those image files is one of the more 
confusing aspects of the art form. And frankly, writing 
about the downloading and organizing process isn’t all 
that easy, either. (It’s a tough job, but somebody’s 
got to do it!) The problem is that providing you with 
detailed instructions is pretty much impossible 
because the steps you need to take vary widely 
depending on what software you have installed on 
your computer and whether you use the Windows 
or Macintosh operating system.
To give you as much help as I can, however, this 
chapter shows you how to transfer and organize 
pictures using the free Nikon software that came in 
your camera box. After exploring these discussions, 
you should be able to adapt the steps to any other photo 
program you may prefer. This chapter also covers a few other 
aspects of handling your picture files, including converting pictures 
taken in the NEF (RAW) format to a standard image format.

224
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
One note before you dig in: Most figures in this chapter and elsewhere fea-
ture the Windows Vista operating system. If you use some other version of 
Windows or own a Mac, what you see on your screen may look slightly differ-
ent but should contain the same basic options unless I specify otherwise.
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory 
card to your computer:
 
✓ Connect the camera directly to 
the computer. For this option, 
you need to dig out the USB cable 
that came in your camera box. 
Your computer must also have 
an open USB slot, or port, in 
techie talk. If you’re not sure 
what these gadgets look like, 
Figure 8-1 gives you a look. The 
little three-pronged icon, labeled 
in Figure 8-1, is the universal 
symbol for USB.
 
✓ Transfer images using a memory 
card reader. Many computers 
now also have slots that accept 
common types of memory cards. 
If so, you can simply pop the 
card out of your camera and 
into the card slot instead of 
hooking the camera up to the 
computer.
 
 As another option, you can buy 
stand-alone card readers such 
as the SanDisk model shown in 
Figure 8-2. This particular model 
accepts a variety of memory 
cards, including the SD card 
used by your D5000. Check your 
printer, too; many printers now 
have card slots that serve the 
purpose of a card reader.

225
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
I prefer to use a card reader because when I transfer via the camera, the 
camera must be turned on during the process, wasting battery power. If you 
want to transfer directly from the camera, however, the next section explains 
some important steps you need to take to make that option work. For help 
using a card reader, skip ahead to “Starting the transfer process” to get an 
overview of what happens after you insert the card into the reader.
Connecting the camera and computer
 
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to 
your computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that in order for your camera to communicate with the computer, 
Nikon suggests that your computer be running one of the following operating 
systems:
 
✓ Windows Vista 32-bit Home Basic with Service Pack 1, Home Premium, 
Business, Enterprise, or Ultimate edition
 
✓ Windows XP with Service Pack 3, Home or Professional edition
 
✓ Mac OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.11, or 10.5.6
If you use another OS (operating system, for the non-geeks in the crowd), 
check the support pages on the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) for the 
latest news about any updates to system compatibility. You can always 
simply transfer images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, here are the steps to link your computer 
and camera:
 
1. Check the level of the camera battery.
 
 If the battery is low, charge it before continuing. Running out of battery 
power during the transfer process can cause problems, including lost 
picture data. Alternatively, if you purchased the optional AC adapter, 
use that to power the camera during picture transfers.
 
2. Turn on the computer and give it time to finish its normal startup 
routine.
 
3. Turn the camera off.
 
4. Insert the smaller of the two plugs on the USB cable into the USB/AV 
port on the side of the camera.
 
 Look under the little rubber door on the left side of the camera, as 
shown in Figure 8-3, for this port. It’s used both for connecting your 
camera to the computer for USB file transfer and for sending audio and 
video (A/V) signals to a television, a subject covered in Chapter 9.

226
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
Figure 8-3: The USB slot is hidden under the rubber door on 
the left side of the camera.
 
5. Plug the other end of the cable into the computer’s USB port.
 
 If possible, plug the cable into a port that’s built in to the computer, as 
opposed to one that’s on your keyboard or part of an external USB hub. 
Those accessory-type connections can sometimes foul up the transfer 
process.
 
6. Turn the camera on.
 
 What happens now depends on whether you connected the camera to 
a Windows-based or Mac computer and what photo software you have 

227
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
installed on that system. The next section explains the possibilities and 
how to proceed with the image transfer process.
 
7. When the download is complete, turn off the camera and then discon-
nect it from the computer.
 
 I repeat: Turn off the camera before severing its ties with the computer. 
Otherwise, you can damage the camera.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow 
the steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card 
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your com-
puter and the computer operating system.
Here are the most common possibilities and how to move forward:
 
✓ On a Windows-based computer, 
a Windows message box similar 
to the one in Figure 8-4 appears. 
Again, the figure shows the dialog 
box as it appears on a computer 
running Windows Vista. Whatever 
its design, the dialog box suggests 
different programs that you can 
use to download your picture files. 
Which programs appear depend 
on what you have installed on 
your system; if you installed Nikon 
Transfer, for example, it should 
appear in the program list, as in 
the figure. In Windows Vista, just 
click the transfer program that 
you want to use. In other versions 
of Windows, the dialog box may 
sport an OK button; if so, click that 
button to proceed.
 
 If you want to use the same pro-
gram for all of your transfers, select the Always Do This for This Device 
check box, as shown in the figure. The next time you connect your 
camera or insert a memory card, Windows will automatically launch 
your program of choice instead of displaying the message box.
 
✓ An installed photo program automatically displays a photo-download 
wizard. For example, the Nikon Transfer downloader or a downloader 
associated with Adobe Photoshop Elements, Picasa, or some other 
photo software may leap to the forefront. On a Mac, the built-in iPhoto 
Figure 8-4: Windows may display this 
initial boxful of transfer options.

228
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
software may display its auto downloader. (Apple’s Web site, www.
apple.com, offers excellent video tutorials on using iPhoto, by the way.)
 
 Usually, the downloader that appears is associated with the software 
that you most recently installed. Each new program that you add to your 
system tries to wrestle control over your image downloads away from 
the previous program.
Safeguarding your digital photo files
To make sure that your digital photos enjoy a 
long, healthy life, follow these storage guidelines:
 ✓ Don’t rely on your computer’s hard drive 
for long-term, archival storage. Hard drives 
occasionally fail, wiping out all files in the 
process. This warning applies to both inter-
nal and external hard drives. At the very least, 
having a dual-drive backup is in order — 
you might keep one copy of your photos on 
your computer’s internal drive and another 
on an external drive. If one breaks, you’ve 
still got all your goodies on the other one. 
Also try to use that second drive only for 
image storage; assuming that you’re not 
accessing the files every day, this minimizes 
the run time of the hard drive, which should 
translate to a longer life span (although it’s 
not guaranteed). 
 ✓ Camera memory cards, flash memory keys, 
and other portable storage devices, such 
as one of those wallet-sized media players, 
are similarly risky. All are easily damaged 
if dropped or otherwise mishandled. And 
being of diminutive stature, these portable 
storage options also are easily lost.
 ✓ The best way to store important files is to 
copy them to nonrewritable CDs. (The label 
should say CD-R, not CD-RW.) Look for qual-
ity, brand-name CDs that have a gold coat-
ing, which offer a higher level of security 
than other coatings and boast a longer life 
than your garden-variety CDs.
 ✓ Recordable DVDs offer the advantage of 
holding lots more data than a CD. However, 
be aware that the DVDs you create on one 
computer may not be playable on another 
because multiple recording formats and 
disc types exist: DVD minus, DVD plus, dual-
layer DVD, and so on. If you do opt for DVD, 
look for the archival, gold-coated variety, 
just as for CDs.
 ✓ For a double backup, you may want to check 
into online storage services, such as Mozy 
(www.mozy.com) and IDrive (www.idrive.
com). You pay a monthly subscription fee 
to back up your important files to the site’s 
servers. 
 
 Note, though, the critical phrase here: 
double backup. Online storage sites have a 
troubling history of closing down suddenly, 
taking all their customers’ data with them. 
(One extremely alarming case was the clo-
sure of a photography-oriented storage site 
called Digital Railroad, which gave clients a 
mere 24-hours’ notice before destroying their 
files.) So anything you store online should 
be also stored on DVD or CD and kept in your 
home or office. Also note that photo-sharing 
sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and 
the like aren’t designed to be long-term stor-
age tanks for your images. Usually, you get 
access to only a small amount of file storage 
space, and the site may require you to pur-
chase prints or other photo products peri-
odically to maintain your account.

229
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
 If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you 
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to 
turn that feature off. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
 
✓ Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or 
camera is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone simply 
may have disabled all the automatic downloaders on your system. Just 
launch your photo software and then transfer your pictures using what-
ever command starts that process. (I show you how to do it with Nikon 
Transfer later in the chapter; for other programs, consult the software 
manual.)
 
 As another option, you can use Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder to 
drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s hard 
drive. Whether you connect the card through a card reader or attach the 
camera directly, the computer sees the card or camera as just another 
drive on the system. So the process of transferring files is exactly the 
same as when you move any other file from a CD, DVD, or other storage 
device onto your hard drive.
In the next sections, I provide details on using Nikon Transfer to download 
your files and Nikon ViewNX to view and organize your pictures. Remember, 
if you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your 
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find 
lots of information by simply clicking open the Help menu.
Downloading and Organizing Photos 
with the Nikon Software
Remember unpacking your camera box when you first brought home your 
D5000? Did you notice a CD-ROM called Nikon Software Suite? If you haven’t 
already done so, dig out that CD and pop it into your computer’s CD drive. 
Then install the following two programs:
 
✓ Nikon Transfer: This program assists you with the process of transfer-
ring pictures from your camera or memory card to the computer.
 
✓ Nikon ViewNX: After downloading your files, you can view and organize 
your picture files using this program. You also can print and e-mail your 
photos from ViewNX.
 
Note that this book features Nikon Transfer version 1.4 and Nikon ViewNX 
version 1.3, which were the most current at the time of publication. If you 
own an earlier version of these programs, visit the Nikon Web site to install 
the updates. (To find out what version you have installed, open the program. 

230
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Then, in Windows, choose Help➪About. On a Mac, choose the About com-
mand from the Nikon Transfer or Nikon ViewNX menu.)
The next several sections give you the most basic of introductions to using 
Nikon Transfer and ViewNX. If you want more details, just look in the Help 
system built in to the programs. (Click the Help menu to access the system.)
 
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use the Nikon software to download and organize your photos 
and still use any photo editing software you prefer. And to do your editing, 
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your 
computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file 
that you put on your system. In fact, for most photo editing programs, you 
can set things up so that you can select a photo in ViewNX and then open 
that picture in your chosen photo editor with a click or two. (With some pro-
grams, you must first take the step of importing the photo files, which enables 
the program to build thumbnails and, in some cases, working copies of your 
pictures.) You can find details in the ViewNX Help system (open the program 
and then choose Help➪ViewNX Help); look for the section called “Setting Up 
ViewNX.”
Downloading with Nikon Transfer
The following steps explain how to download new pictures to your computer 
using Nikon Transfer:
 
1. Attach your camera or insert a memory card into your card reader, as 
outlined in the first part of this chapter.
 
 Depending on what software you have installed on your system, you 
may see the initial Nikon Transfer window, as shown in Figure 8-5. Or, in 
Windows, you may see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 
8-4. In that case, click the item that has the Nikon Transfer logo, as 
shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 If nothing happens, start Nikon Transfer by using the same process you 
use to launch any program on your computer. (If some other photo soft-
ware pops up, close it first.)
 
2. Display the Source tab to view thumbnails of your pictures, as shown 
in the figure.
 
 Don’t see any tabs? Click the little Options triangle, located near the top-
left corner of the window, to display them. Then click the Source tab. 
The icon representing your camera or memory card should be selected, 
as shown in the figure. If not, click the icon. The dialog box then dis-
plays thumbnails of your images. (If you don’t see the thumbnails, click 
the arrow labeled in Figure 8-5 to expand the dialog box and open the 
thumbnails area.)

231

Figure 8-5: Select the check boxes of the images that you want to download.
 
3. Select the images that you want to download.
 
 A check mark in the little box under a thumbnail tells the program that 
you want to download the image. Click the box to toggle the check mark 
on and off.
 
 If you used the in-camera functions to protect pictures (see Chapter 4), 
you can select just those images by clicking the Select Protected icon, 
labeled in Figure 8-5.
 
4. Click the Primary Destination tab at the top of the window.
 
 When you click the tab, the top of the transfer window offers options 
that enable you to specify where and how you want the images to be 
stored on your computer. Figure 8-6 offers a close-up look. 

232
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-6: Specify the folder where you want to put the downloaded images.
 
5. Choose the folder where you want to store the images from the 
Primary Destination Folder drop-down list.
 
 If the folder you want to use isn’t in the list, choose Browse from the 
bottom of the list and then track down the folder and select it.
 
 By default, the program puts images in a folder titled Nikon Transfer, 
which is housed inside a folder named My Pictures in Windows XP and 
Pictures in Windows Vista and on a Mac. That My Pictures or Pictures 
folder is housed inside a folder that your system creates automatically 
for each registered user of the computer.
 
 You don’t have to stick with this default location — you can put your 
pictures anywhere you please. But because most photo programs auto-
matically look for pictures in these standard folders, putting your pic-
tures there just simplifies things a little down the road. Note: You can 
always move your pictures into other folders after you download them if 
needed, too. The upcoming section “Organizing pictures” explains how 
to do so in Nikon ViewNX.

233
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
6. Specify whether you want the pictures to be placed inside a new 
subfolder.
 
 If you select the Create Subfolder for Each Transfer option, the program 
creates a new folder inside the storage folder you selected in Step 5. 
Then it puts all the pictures from the current download session into that 
new subfolder. You can either use the numerical subfolder name the 
program suggests or click the Edit button to set up your own naming 
system. You might find it helpful to go with a folder name that includes 
the date and place where the batch of photos was taken, for example. 
(You can reorganize your pictures into this type of setup after down-
load, however.) If you created custom folders on the camera memory 
card, an option you can explore in Chapter 11, select the Copy Folder 
Names from Camera check box to use those folder names instead.
 
7. Tell the program whether you want to rename the picture files during 
the download process.
 
 If you do, select the Rename Photos During Transfer check box. Then 
click the Edit button to display a dialog box where you can set up your 
new filenaming scheme. Click OK after you do so to close the dialog box.
 
8. Click the Preferences tab to set the rest of the transfer options.
 
 Now the tab shown in Figure 8-7 takes over the top of the program 
window. Here you find a number of options that enable you to control 
how the program operates. Most of the options are self-explanatory, but 
a couple warrant a few words of advice:
Figure 8-7: Control other aspects of the program’s behavior via the Preferences tab.
 
• Launch automatically when device is attached. Deselect this check 
box if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to start every time you con-
nect your camera to your computer or insert a memory card into 
your card reader.
 
• Transfer new photos only. This option, when selected, ensures that 
you don’t waste time downloading images that you’ve already 
transferred but are still on the memory card.

234
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
• Delete original files after transfer. Turn this option off, as shown 
in Figure 8-7. Otherwise, your pictures are automatically erased 
from your memory card when the transfer is complete. You 
should always check to make sure the pictures really made it to 
the computer before you delete them from your memory card. 
(See Chapter 4 to find out how to use the Delete function on your 
camera.)
 
• Open destination folder with other application after transfer. By 
default, Nikon Transfer shuts itself down when the file download 
is complete, and Nikon ViewNX then starts automatically so that 
you can view and organize your images. (That’s assuming that you 
installed ViewNX, of course.) If you want to use a program other 
than ViewNX for that task, open the drop-down list, click Browse, 
and select the program from the dialog box that appears. Click OK 
after doing so. And if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to close after 
downloading, uncheck the Quit Nikon Transfer Automatically After 
Transfer option.
 
 Your choices remain in force for any subsequent download sessions, so 
you don’t have to revisit this tab unless you want the program to behave 
differently.
 
9. When you’re ready to start the download, click the Start Transfer button.
 
 It’s located in the lower-right corner of the program window. After you 
click the button, the Process bar in the lower-left corner indicates how 
the transfer is progressing. Again, what happens when the transfer com-
pletely depends on the choices you made in Step 8; by default, Nikon 
Transfer closes, and ViewNX opens, automatically displaying the folder 
that contains your just-downloaded images.
Browsing images in Nikon ViewNX
Nikon ViewNX is designed to do exactly what its name suggests: enable you 
to view and organize the pictures that you shoot with your D5000. You also 
can view other photos — pictures you scanned, received from friends via 
e-mail, or took with a different camera, for example. The only requirement is 
that the file format is one that ViewNX can read; for still photos, that means 
JPEG, TIFF, or NEF, which is the Nikon flavor of Camera Raw. (Chapter 3 
explains file formats.) The program also can play the AVI movie files that you 
create with your D5000. For a complete rundown of supported file formats, 
check the Appendix section of the built-in program Help system.
Figure 8-8 offers a look at the ViewNX window as it appears by default in 
Windows Vista. The Mac version is nearly identical, although it features the 
usual Mac look and feel instead of the Microsoft Windows design.
 
On either type of system, you can customize a variety of aspects of the 
window layout by using the options on the View and Window menus.

Figure 8-8: You can browse and organize your photos using Nikon ViewNX.
To start viewing your pictures, first display the Folders panel along the 
left side of the program window, as shown in Figure 8-8. (Just click the tab, 
labeled in the figure.) Now open the folder that holds the photos you want 
to view. If you came to ViewNX directly after downloading pictures via Nikon 
Transfer, the folder that holds the new images should already be selected 
for you. Thumbnails of those images then appear on the right side of the pro-
gram window. For a movie, you see a thumbnail representing the first shot in 
the recording.
 
By opening the View menu, you can choose from the following viewing options:
 
✓ Thumbnail View: This is the default layout. For this view, you can choose 
from two thumbnail display styles. If you select Thumbnail Grid from the 
View menu, your screen appears as shown in Figure 8-8. You can adjust 
the size of the thumbnails by dragging the Zoom slider, labeled in the 
figure. If you prefer, you can instead select Thumbnail List, in which case 
you see thumbnails with information such as the filenames, the dates 
the images were taken, file sizes, and so on. This view is for accountants 
and other statisticians who also use the Nikon D5000. (Take a peek at 
Figures 8-11 and 8-12, later in this chapter, for a look at this view.)

236
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Image Viewer: Select this option from the View menu to display your 
files as shown in Figure 8-9. Small thumbnails appear along the top of the 
pane; the selected thumbnail appears in the larger preview area under-
neath. Use these maneuvers to inspect your images:
 
• To select an image or movie file, just click its thumbnail.
 
• Magnify or reduce the size of photo thumbnails and the preview by 
using the Zoom sliders labeled in Figure 8-9. For a movie file, the 
size of the preview automatically changes to fill the preview area 
as you adjust the thumbnail size.
 
• Drag in the large preview to scroll the display as needed to view 
hidden parts of a photo.
 
• To scroll through your files, click the little arrows under the large 
preview, labeled Previous and Next in the figure.

✓ Full Screen: Want to see a photo at full-screen size, as shown in Figure 
8-10? If you’re working in Thumbnail view (with or without all the data 
displayed), just double-click the picture thumbnail. In Image Viewer 
view, first click the thumbnail to display it in the large preview. Then 
double-click the large preview. Or, in either view, click the thumbnail 
and then press the letter F. For movies, controls for starting the movie 
playback appear under the preview. (Click the little triangle to begin 
playback; click the neighboring square to stop it.)

Viewing picture metadata
When you snap a still photo with your D5000, the camera includes in the 
picture file some extra data that records all the critical camera settings that 
were in force. This data, known by nerds as metadata, also includes the cap-
ture date and time. And, if you take advantage of the Image Comment feature 
that I cover in Chapter 11, you can even store a brief bit of custom text, such 
as the shooting location or subject. (Note that the date/time information is 
included automatically in the metadata; it’s unrelated to the Date Imprint 
function, discussed in Chapter 1. That feature actually places the date and 
time directly on the image itself rather than hiding it in the metadata.) 
 
Reviewing this data is a great way to better understand what settings work 
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting up to 
speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the other digital 
photography basics. To get the full story on how each setting affects your 
pictures, see Chapters 5 and 6.
To view the metadata in ViewNX, first select an image by clicking its thumb-
nail in the ViewNX browser window. Then click the Metadata tab on the left 
side of the window or choose Window➪Metadata. The metadata information 
then comes to the forefront, as shown in Figure 8-11.
The metadata is divided into several sections of related capture settings: File 
Info 1, File Info 2, Camera Info, Exposure, Flash, and so on. To hide or display 
a section, click the triangle next to it. You may need to use the scroll bar 
along the right side of the panel to view all the available information. Note 
that Nikon supplies ViewNX with cameras other than the D5000, and some 
categories of data apply only to those other models.
The XMP/IPTC Information part of the Metadata panel gives you access to the 
ViewNX keywords, tags, and rating functions. These functions, along with the 
program’s search feature, provide you with various tools that make locating 
specific pictures easier, including the option to search for pictures based on 
the shooting date.
 
In case you’re curious, IPTC refers to text data that press photographers 
are often required to tag onto their picture files, such as captions and copy-
right information. XMP refers to a data format developed by Adobe to 
enable that kind of data to be added to the file. IPTC stands for International 
Press Telecommunication Council; XMP stands for Extensible Metadata 
Platform.

Organizing pictures
When you download files from your camera using Nikon Transfer, you can 
specify where on your computer’s hard drive you want to store them. After 
you get the files on your system, you can further organize them in ViewNX. 
You can create new folders and subfolders, move images from one folder to 
another, rename and delete files, and more.
To begin organizing your files, first display the Folders panel by clicking its 
tab on the left side of the program window. In this panel, you can see and 
manage the contents of all the drives and folders on your computer. From 
here, you can set up and rearrange your storage closet as follows:
 
✓ Hide/display the contents of a drive or folder. See a little plus sign 
(Windows) or right-pointing triangle (Mac) next to a drive or folder? 
Click it to display the contents of that storage bin. A minus sign 

240
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
(Windows) or a down-pointing triangle (Mac) means that the drive or 
folder is open; click that minus sign or triangle to close the drive or 
folder.
 
✓ Create a new folder. First, click the drive or folder where you want to 
house the new folder. For example, if you want to create it inside your 
Pictures or My Pictures folder, click it. Icons representing all the 
folders and files currently found within that folder then appear in the 
thumbnail area.
 
 Next, choose File➪New Folder. An icon representing the new folder 
should then appear, with the name box activated, as shown in Figure 
8-12. Type the folder name and press Enter.
 
 
Figure 8-12: You can set up whatever folder structure makes sense to you.

241
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
✓ Move a file from one folder to another. First, display that file’s thumb-
nail in the browser. Then drag the thumbnail to the destination folder in 
the Folder pane.
 
✓ Delete a file. In Windows, click the thumbnail and then choose 
Edit➪Delete or press the Delete key. On a Mac, choose Edit➪Move to 
Trash or press Ô+Delete. You then see a message asking you to confirm 
that you really want to trash the file. Click Yes to move forward.
 
✓ Protect or unlock photos. If you used the Protect feature on your 
camera to “lock” a file, a process you can explore in Chapter 4, you need 
to remove the protection if you want to edit the image in your photo 
software. To do so, choose File➪Protect Files➪Unprotect.
 
 You also can protect files in ViewNX; just choose Protect from the File➪
Protect Files submenu. A little key icon then appears on the thumbnail 
to remind you that the file is now protected from editing or erasing. If 
you later want to delete the file, you must first unprotect it.
 
✓ Select multiple files for moving, deleting, or other actions. Click the 
thumbnail of the first image and then Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click 
(Mac) the rest. To select all images in the current folder, press Ctrl+A 
(Windows) or Ô+A (Mac.)
Using your mouse as a shutter button
Nikon offers a piece of specialty software 
known as Nikon Camera Control Pro 2, which 
sells for about $180. With this program, you can 
use your computer to operate your camera.
While your camera is connected to your com-
puter, the software displays a window that 
contains clickable controls for adjusting all 
the standard camera settings, from aperture 
to white balance. When you get those options 
established, you click another button to record 
whatever scene is in front of your camera lens.
What’s the point? Well, Camera Control Pro is 
great in scenarios that make having a live pho-
tographer close to the subject either difficult or 
dangerous — for example, trying to get a shot 
of a chemical reaction in a science lab or cap-
ture an image of an animal that’s shy around 
humans. Additionally, the software enables easy 
time-lapse photography, enabling you to set the 
camera to take pictures automatically at speci-
fied intervals over a period of minutes, hours, or 
even days. (You don’t need the software to use 
the camera’s Interval Timing feature, described 
in Chapter 2.)

242
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Processing RAW (NEF) Files
Chapter 3 introduces you to the RAW file format. The advantage of captur-
ing RAW files, which are called NEF files on Nikon cameras, is that you make 
the decisions about how to translate the original picture data into an actual 
photograph. You can specify attributes such as color intensity, image sharp-
ening, contrast, and so on — all of which are handled automatically by the 
camera if you use its other file format, JPEG. You take these steps by using a 
software tool known as a RAW converter.
 
The bad news: Until you convert your NEF files into a standard file format, 
you can’t share them online or print them from most programs other than 
Nikon ViewNX. You also can’t get prints from most retail outlets or open 
them in many photo editing programs.
To process your D5000 NEF files, you have a couple of options:
 
✓ Use the in-camera processing feature. Through the Retouch menu, you 
can process your RAW images right in the camera. You can specify only 
limited image attributes (color, sharpness, and so on), and you can save 
the processed files only in the JPEG format, but still, having this option 
is a nice feature. See the next section for details.
 
✓ Process and convert in ViewNX. ViewNX also offers a RAW processing 
feature. Again, the controls for setting picture characteristics are a little 
limited, but you can save the adjusted files in either the JPEG or TIFF 
format. The last section of this chapter walks you through this option.
 
✓ Use Nikon Capture NX 2 or a third-party RAW conversion tool. For the 
most control over your RAW images, you need to open up your wallet 
and invest in a program that offers a truly capable converter. Nikon 
offers such a program, called Nikon Capture NX 2, which as of this writ-
ing sells for about $180. Figure 8-13 gives you a look at the Capture NX 2 
RAW converter window.
 
 Another (and less costly option) that I frequently recommend is Adobe 
Photoshop Elements, which sells for about $90 (www.adobe.com). It 
includes the Adobe Camera Raw converter, known in the industry as 
ACR, which is widely considered one of the best available. (Note: The 
converter in Elements doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of the ver-
sion of ACR provided with Photoshop, however.) In addition, Elements 
is designed for the novice photo editing enthusiast, so it includes lots 
of helpful onscreen guides, whereas Capture NX 2 is geared more to the 
advanced digital photographer.

243
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
 
 Figure 8-13: Nikon Capture NX 2 is one option for gaining more control over your RAW 
conversions.
If you do opt for a third-party conversion tool, check the program’s Help 
system for details on how to use the various controls, which vary from pro-
gram to program. The following general tips apply no matter what converter 
you use, however:
 
✓ Whenever possible, save your processed files in a nondestructive format 
such as TIFF. For top quality, don’t save originals in the JPEG format, 
which applies lossy compression. You can read about the potential 
damage to image quality that lossy compression creates in Chapter 3. 
If you need a JPEG image to share online, Chapter 9 shows you how to 
create a duplicate of your original, converted image in that format.
 
✓ Some RAW converters give you the option of creating a 16-bit image file. 
(A bit is a unit of computer data; the more bits you have, the more colors 
your image can contain.) Although you can create 16-bit TIFF files, many 
photo editing programs either can’t open them or limit you to a few edit-
ing tools, so I suggest you stick with the standard, 8-bit image option. 

244
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Your image will contain more than enough colors, and you’ll avoid 
potential conflicts caused by so-called high-bit images.
 
✓ Resist the temptation to crank up color saturation too much. Doing so 
can actually destroy image detail. Likewise, be careful about overdoing 
sharpening, or you can create noticeable image defects. 
Processing RAW images in the camera
Scroll past the initial screen of options on the Retouch menu, and you come 
to a menu item called NEF (RAW) Processing. With this feature, you can 
process RAW files right in the camera — no computer or other software 
required.
I want to share two reservations about this option:
 
✓ First, you can save your processed files only in the JPEG format. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, that format results in some quality loss because 
of the file compression that JPEG applies. You can choose the level of 
JPEG compression you want to apply during RAW processing; you can 
create a JPEG Fine, Normal, or Basic file. Each of those settings produces 
the same quality that you get when you shoot new photos in the JPEG 
format and select Fine, Normal, or Basic from the Image Quality menu.
 
 Chapter 3 details the JPEG options, but, long story short, choose Fine 
for the best JPEG quality. And if you want to produce the absolute best 
quality from your RAW images, use a software solution and save your 
processed file in the TIFF format instead.
 
✓ You can make adjustments to exposure, color, and a few other options 
as part of the in-camera RAW conversion process. Evaluating the effects 
of your adjustments on the camera monitor can be difficult because of 
the size of the display compared to your computer monitor. So for really 
tricky images, you may want to forgo in-camera conversion and do the 
job on your computer, where you can get a better — and bigger — view 
of things. If you do go the in-camera route, make sure that the monitor 
brightness is set to its default position so that you aren’t misled by the 
display. (Chapter 1 shows you how to adjust monitor brightness.)
That said, in-camera RAW processing offers a quick and convenient solution 
when you need JPEG copies of your NEF images for immediate online sharing. 
(JPEG is the standard format for online use.) Follow these steps to get the 
job done:
 
1. Press the Playback button to switch to playback mode.

245
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
2. Display the picture you want to 
process in the single-image (full 
frame) view.
 
 If necessary, you can shift from 
thumbnails view to single-image 
view by just pressing the OK 
button. Chapter 4 has more play-
back details.
 
3. Press the OK button.
 
 The Retouch menu then appears 
atop your photo, as shown in 
Figure 8-14.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to scroll 
to the NEF (RAW) Processing 
option, as shown in Figure 8-14.
 
 The option is on the second screen of the Retouch menu.
 
5. Press OK to display your processing options, as shown in Figure 8-15.

6. Set the conversion options.
 
 Along the right side of the screen, you see a vertical column offering five 
conversion options, which I labeled in Figure 8-15. To establish the set-
ting for an option, use the Multi Selector to highlight it and then press 
OK. You then see the available settings for the option. For example, if 
Figure 8-14: In single-image playback mode, 
press OK to display the Retouch menu over 
your photo. 

246

you highlight the first option, 
Image Quality, and press OK, you 
see the screen shown in Figure 
8-16. Use the Multi Selector to 
highlight the setting you want to 
use and press OK to return to the 
main RAW conversion screen.
 
 Rather than detailing all the 
options here, the following list 
points you to the chapter where 
you can explore the settings 
available for each:
 
• Image Quality: See the 
Chapter 3 section related to 
the JPEG quality settings for details on this option.
 
• Image Size: The first part of Chapter 3 explains this one.
 
• White Balance: Check out Chapter 6 for details about White 
Balance options.
 
• Exposure Compensation: With this option, you can adjust image 
brightness by applying exposure compensation, a feature that I 
cover in Chapter 5.
 
• Picture Control: This option enables you to adjust color, contrast, 
and image sharpness. For a review of the available settings, see the 
last part of Chapter 6.
 
7. When you finish setting all the conversion options, highlight EXE on 
the main conversion screen. (Refer to Figure 8-15.) Then press OK.
 
 The camera records a JPEG 
copy of your RAW file and dis-
plays the copy in the monitor. 
To remind you that the image 
was created with the help of 
the Retouch menu, the top-left 
corner of the display sports the 
little Retouch icon, and the file-
name of the image begins with 
CSC rather than the usual DSC, 
as shown in Figure 8-17. See 
Chapter 4 for details about file-
naming conventions used by 
the D5000.

use and press OK.

 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Processing RAW files in ViewNX
In ViewNX, you can convert your RAW files to either the JPEG format or, for 
top picture quality, to the TIFF format. (See Chapter 3 if you’re unsure about 
the whole concept of file format and how it relates to picture quality.)
Although the ViewNX converter isn’t as full-featured as the ones in Nikon 
Capture NX 2, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and some other photo editing pro-
grams, it does enable you to make some adjustments to your RAW images. 
Follow these steps to try it out.
 
1. Click the thumbnail of the NEF (RAW) image to select it.
 
 You may want to set the program to Image Viewer mode, as shown in 
Figure 8-18, so that you can see a larger preview of your image. Just 
choose View➪Image Viewer to switch to this display mode.
 
2. Display the Quick Adjustment tab by clicking its tab on the left side of 
the program window.
 
 I labeled the tab in Figure 8-18. The tab provides access to a few con-
trols for fine-tuning your image. You can adjust exposure compensa-
tion, white balance, and assign a Picture Control, such as Landscape or 
Monochrome. Each time you adjust a setting, the preview updates to 
show you the results.
  
 A couple of options may require some explanation:
 
• Launch Utility button: This button, located under the Picture 
Control option, opens the Picture Control Utility, where you can 
define your own Picture Controls. I don’t get into this advanced 
function in this book, but if you’re curious, open the utility and 
then click the Help button at the bottom of the window.
 
• Highlight Protection/Shadow Protection/D-Lighting HS: Try using 
these options to recover hidden shadow and highlight detail.
 
• Color Booster: This slider (at the bottom of the panel, not vis-
ible in Figure 8-18) enables you to increase saturation. But if you 
select the People button under the slider, skin tones are left alone. 
Choose Nature to adjust the saturation of all colors in the photo.
 
• Axial Color Aberration: Due to an optical phenomenon that’s too 
complex to fully explore here, some lenses can produce a defect 
known as axial color aberration or, in some circles, color fringing. 
This defect results in weird color halos along the edges of an 
object, typically on the side away from the center of the photo. 
To check your photo, zoom the display to a magnification of 200 
percent or greater — the halos usually aren’t visible when the dis-
play size is small — and pay special attention to the corners of the 
photo, where the problem tends to be greatest. If you spot haloing, 
check the Auto box for the Axial Color Aberration setting and let 
the program try to apply the proper correction. You then can drag 

248
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
the slider to tweak the strength of the correction, if needed. (The 
program may need a few seconds to update the preview after each 
change, so be patient.)
 
Convert Files button
Quick Adjustment tab
 
Figure 8-18: Display the Quick Adjustment panel to tweak RAW images before conversion.
 
 If you want more details about these or any other of the options, choose 
Help➪ViewNX Help to open the Help system, and then display the Help 
pages related to the Quick Adjustment tab.
 
3. Click the Save button at the bottom of the Quick Adjustment area.
 
 Or to revert to the original adjustment settings, click Reset.
 
4. To save the processed file, choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 Or just click the Convert Files button on the toolbar at the top of the 
program window. Either way, you see the Convert Files dialog box, 
shown in Figure 8-19.
 
5. Select TIFF (8 Bit) from the File Format drop-down list.

249
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
Figure 8-19: To retain the best image quality, save processed 
RAW files in the TIFF format.
 
 You also can opt for TIFF (16 Bit) or JPEG, but I don’t recommend it. 
TIFF (16 Bit) can cause problems when you try to open the file in certain 
photo editing and organizing programs. And saving in the JPEG format 
applies lossy compression, thereby sacrificing some image quality. If you 
need a JPEG copy of your processed RAW image for online sharing, you 
can easily create one from your TIFF version by following the steps laid 
out in Chapter 9.
 
6. Deselect the Use LZW Compression option, as shown in the figure.
 
 Although LZW Compression reduces the file size somewhat and does 
not cause any quality loss, some programs can’t open files that were 
saved with this option enabled. So turn it off.
 
7. Deselect the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 This step ensures that you retain all the original pixels in your image, 
which gives you the most flexibility in terms of generating quality prints 
at large sizes. For details on this issue, check out Chapter 3.

250
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
8. Deselect each of the three Remove check boxes.
 
 If you select the check boxes, you strip image metadata — the extra text 
data that’s stored by the camera — from the file. Unless you have some 
specific reason to do so, clear all three check boxes so that you can con-
tinue to access the metadata when you view your processed image in 
programs that know how to display metadata.
 
 The first two check boxes relate to data that you can view on the Metadata 
tab in ViewNX; earlier sections of this chapter give you the lowdown. 
The ICC profile item refers to the image color space, which is either sRGB 
or Adobe RGB on your D5000. Chapter 6 explains the difference.
 
9. Select a storage location for the processed TIFF file.
 
 You do this in the Save In area of the dialog box, highlighted in Figure 
8-19. Select the top option to save your processed file in the same folder 
as the original RAW file. Or, to put the file in a different folder, click the 
Specified Folder button. The name of the currently selected alterna-
tive folder appears below the button, as shown in Figure 8-19. You can 
change the storage destination by clicking the Browse button and then 
selecting the drive and folder where you want to put the file.
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can put your TIFF file into a separate folder within the destina-
tion folder. If you select the box, click the Naming Options button and 
then specify how you want to name the subfolder.
 
10. Specify whether you want to give the processed TIFF a different file-
name from the original RAW image.
 
 To do so, select the Change File Names check box and then click the 
Naming Options button and enter the name you want to use.
 
 If you don’t change the filename, ViewNX gives the file the same name 
as the original RAW file. But you don’t overwrite that RAW file because 
you are storing the copy in a different file format (TIFF). In Windows, the 
filename of the processed TIFF image has the three-letter extension TIF.
 
11. Click the Convert button.
 
 A window appears to show you the progress of the conversion process. 
When the window disappears, your TIFF image appears in the storage 
location you selected in Step 10.
 
One neat thing about working with RAW images is that you can easily create 
as many variations of your photo as you want. For example, you might 
choose one set of options when processing your RAW file the first time, and 
then use an entirely different set to create another version of the photo. You 
could create one image in full color, perhaps, and then open the RAW file 
again and this time launch the Picture Control Utility and create a sepia ver-
sion of the image.

W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the 
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to 
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even 
then, the operative word was “good,” not “great.” And if you did want a print, 
it was a pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless you paid sky-
high prices at a professional imaging lab. In those days, retail 
photo labs didn’t offer digital printing, and online printing 
services hadn’t arrived yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least in 
the case of digital photo printing, to a very good out-
come. Your D5000 can produce dynamic prints even 
at large sizes, and getting those prints made is easy 
and economical, thanks to an abundance of digital 
printing services now in stores and online.
That said, getting the best output from your camera 
still requires a little bit of knowledge and prep work 
on your part. To that end, this chapter tells you 
exactly how to ensure that your picture files will look as 
good on paper as they do in your camera monitor.
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures 
electronically. First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — an 
important step if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering 
their inboxes with ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you 
can find out how to create digital slide shows and view your pictures and 
Live View movies on a television.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Printing Possibilities: Retail or Do-It-Yourself?
Normally, I’m a do-it-yourself type of gal. I mow my own lawn, check my own 
tire pressure, hang my own screen doors. I am woman; hear me roar. Unless, 
that is, I discover that I can have someone else do the job in less time and for 
less money than I can — which just happens to be the case for digital photo 
printing. Although I occasionally make my own prints for fine-art images that 
I plan to sell or exhibit, I have everyday snapshots made at my local retail 
photo lab.
 
Unless you’re already very comfortable with computers and photo printing, I 
suggest that you do the same. Compare the cost of retail digital printing with 
the cost of using a home or office photo printer — remember to factor in the 
required ink, paper, and your precious time — and you’ll no doubt come out 
ahead if you delegate the job.
You can choose from a variety of retail printing options, as follows:
 
✓ Drop-off printing services: Just as you used to leave a roll of film at the 
photo lab in your corner drug store or camera store, you can drop off 
your memory card, order prints, and then pick up your prints in as little 
as an hour.
 
✓ Self-serve print kiosks: Many photo labs, big-box stores, and other retail 
outlets also offer self-serve print kiosks. You insert your memory card 
into the appropriate slot, follow the onscreen directions, and wait for 
your prints to slide out of the print chute.
 
✓ Online with mail-order delivery: You can upload your photo files to 
online printing sites and have prints mailed directly to your house. 
Photo-sharing sites such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Snapfish are 
well-known players in this market. But many national retail chains, such 
as Ritz Cameras, Wal-Mart, and others also offer this service.
 
✓ Online with local pickup: Here’s my favorite option. Many national 
chains enable you to upload your picture files for easy ordering but pick 
up your prints at a local store. This service is a great way to share prints 
with faraway friends and family, by the way. I can upload and order 
prints from my desk in Indianapolis, for example, and have them printed 
at a store located a few miles from my parents’ home in Texas.
 
For times when you do want to print your photos on your own printer, 
you can do so through Nikon ViewNX. However, I find the ViewNX printing 
options both more complex and more limited than those in other programs, 
which is why I opted not to cover them in this book. I suggest that you 
instead print from whatever photo editing program you use or from the soft-
ware provided by your printer manufacturer.

253
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Preventing Potential Printing Problems
Boy, I love a good alliteration, don’t you? Oh, just me, then. Anyway, as I say 
in the introduction to this chapter, a few issues can cause hiccups in the 
printing process. So before you print your photos, whether you want to do it 
on your own printer or send them to a lab, read through the next three sec-
tions, which show you how to avoid the most common trouble spots.
Match resolution to print size
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in 
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality. 
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick 
recap as it relates to printing:
 
✓ On the D5000, you set picture resolution via the Image Size option, 
which you can adjust either via the Shooting menu or through the Quick 
Settings display. (Again, see Chapter 3 for specifics.) You must select 
this option before you capture an image, which means that you need 
some idea of your ultimate print size before you shoot. And if you crop 
your image, you eliminate some pixels, so take that factor into account 
when you do the resolution math. 
 
✓ For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience, 
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if you 
want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 
✓ Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi. 
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably, 
some from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However, 
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.
 
 Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you 
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right reso-
lution is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots 
of color the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple 
dots to reproduce one image pixel.)
 
✓ If you’re printing your photos at a retail kiosk or at an online site, the 
printing software that you use to order your prints should determine the 
resolution of your file and then guide you as to the suggested print size. 
But if you’re printing on a home printer, you need to be the resolution 
cop. (Some programs, however, do alert you in the Print dialog box if 
the resolution is dangerously low.)
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print 
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important, print 
size or print quality.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
If your print size does exceed your pixel supply, one of two things must happen:
 
✓ The pixel count remains constant, and pixels simply grow in size 
to fill the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get a 
defect known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or 
stairstepped, along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can 
actually make out the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look 
more like a mosaic than, well, a photograph.
 
✓ The pixel size remains constant, and the printer software adds pixels 
to fill in the gaps. You can also add pixels, or resample the image, in 
your photo software. Wherever it’s done, resampling doesn’t solve the 
low resolution problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo 
information out of thin air, and the result is usually an image that looks 
worse than it did before resampling. You don’t get pixelation, but details 
turn muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact 
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 through 9-3 show you the same 
image as it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of 
this book), at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, 
there’s just no way around the rule: If you want the best quality prints, you 
need the right pixel count.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, your D5000 produces photos that have an 
aspect ratio of 3:2. That is, pictures are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just 
like a 35mm film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to 
the standard 4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, 
which must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
 
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 
8 x 10, 11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those pro-
portions. Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an 
empty margin along the edges of the print as needed.
As a point of reference, Figure 9-4 shows 
you a 3:2 original image. The outlines 
indicate how much of the original can fit 
within a 5-x-7-inch frame and an 8-x-10-inch 
frame.
Your camera’s Trim feature, found on 
the Retouch menu, enables you to crop 
your photo, but only to five different 
aspect ratios (3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 1:1, and 16:9). 
See Chapter 10 for information. For other 
proportions, most photo editing programs 
offer very simple cropping tools. You also 
can usually crop your photo using the 
software provided at online printing sites 
and at retail print kiosks. But if you plan to 
drop off your memory card of original pic-
tures at a lab, be aware that your pictures 
will be cropped if you select a print size 
other than 4 x 6. 
 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave 
at least a little margin of background 
around your subject when you shoot, as 
shown in Figure 9-4. Then you don’t clip 
off the edges of the subject no matter what 
print size you choose. (Some people refer 
to this margin padding as head room, espe-
cially when describing portrait composition.)
Get print and monitor colors in synch
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you 
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty 
5 x 7 frame area
8 x 10 frame area

a little head room enables you to crop 
to different frame sizes.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue, 
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 
✓ Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match 
what you see on your computer monitor, the most likely culprit is actually 
the monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately calibrated, the 
colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image colors.
 
 To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas, 
you can start with a software-based calibration utility, which is just a 
small program that guides you through the process of adjusting your 
monitor. The program displays various color swatches and other graph-
ics and then asks you to provide feedback about what you see on the 
screen.
 
 If you use a Mac, the operating system offers a built-in calibration utility, 
called the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-5 shows the welcome 
screen that appears when you run the program. (Access it by opening 
the System Preferences dialog box, clicking the Displays icon, clicking 
the Color button, and then clicking the Calibrate button.) You also can 
find free calibration software for both Mac and Windows systems online; 
just enter the term free monitor calibration software into your favorite 
search engine.
 
Figure 9-5: Mac users can take advantage of the operating system’s built-in 
calibration tool.

258
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Software-based calibration isn’t ideal, however, because our eyes aren’t 
that reliable in judging color accuracy. For a more accurate calibration, 
you may want to invest in a device known as a colorimeter, which you 
attach to or hang on your monitor, to accurately measure and calibrate 
your display. Companies such as Datacolor (www.datacolor.com), 
Pantone (www.pantone.com), and X-Rite (www.xrite.com) sell this type 
of product along with other tools for ensuring better color matching.
 
 Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor 
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust 
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or 
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your 
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every 
month or so, because monitor colors drift over time.
 
✓ One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints 
look great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is 
an empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your 
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep 
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
 
 If black-and-white prints have a color tint, a logical assumption is that 
your black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the 
truth is that a printer that doesn’t use multiple black or gray cartridges 
will always have a slight color tint. Why? Because in order to create 
gray, the printer instead has to mix yellow, magenta, and cyan in per-
fectly equal amounts, and that’s a difficult feat for the typical inkjet 
printer to pull off. If your black-and-white prints have a strong color tint, 
however, it could be that one of your color cartridges is empty, and 
replacing it may help somewhat. Long story short: Unless you have a 
printer that’s marketed for producing good black-and-white prints, you’ll 
probably save yourself some grief by simply having your black-and-
whites printed at a retail lab.
 
 When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the 
performance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manu-
facturer. A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the 
printer’s ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously 
knows most about that delivery system.
 
✓ You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you 
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the 
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 
✓ Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand 
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced, 
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance 
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system. 

259
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
 Some paper manufacturers, especially those that sell fine-art papers, 
offer downloadable printer profiles, which are simply little bits of soft-
ware that tell your printer how to manage color for the paper. Refer to 
the manufacturer’s Web site for information on how to install and use 
the profiles.
 
✓ Your printer and photo software are fighting over color-management 
duties. Some photo programs offer features that enable the user to con-
trol how colors are handled as an image passes from camera to monitor 
to printer. Most printer software also offers color-management features. 
The problem is, if you enable color-management controls both in your 
photo software and your printer software, you can create conflicts that 
lead to wacky colors. So check your photo software and printer manuals 
to find out what color-management options are available to you and how 
to turn them on and off.
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your D5000 offers two technologies, called 
DPOF (dee-poff) and PictBridge, that enable 
you to print images directly from your camera 
or memory card, without using the computer as 
middle-machine. In order to take advantage of 
direct printing, your printer must also support 
one of the two technologies, and you must cap-
ture the images in the JPEG file format, which 
I explain in Chapter 3. (You can also capture 
the photo in the Raw format and then use your 
D5000’s in-camera conversion tool to make a 
JPEG copy suitable for direct printing.)
DPOF stands for Digital Print Order Format. 
With this option, accessed via your camera’s 
Playback menu, you select the pictures on 
your memory card that you want to print, and 
you specify how many copies you want of 
each image. Then, if your photo printer has 
an SD Card slot and supports DPOF, you just 
pop the memory card into that slot. The printer 
reads your “print order” and outputs just the 
requested copies of your selected images. (You 
use the printer’s own controls to set paper size, 
print orientation, and other print settings.)
PictBridge works a little differently. If you have 
a PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can 
connect the camera to the printer using the USB 
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge 
interface appears on the camera monitor, and 
you use the camera controls to select the pic-
tures you want to print. With PictBridge, you 
specify additional print options, such as page 
size and whether you want to print a border 
around the photo, from the camera as well.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful 
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For 
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and 
want to deliver prints to guests before they go 
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing up 
your computer, downloading pictures, and so on. 
And if you invest in one of the tiny portable photo 
printers on the market today, you can easily make 
prints away from your home or office — you can 
take both your portable printer and camera along 
to your regional sales meeting, for example. 
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge 
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with 
cabling the printer and camera together. Also, 
the camera must be turned on for the whole print-
ing process, wasting battery power. But if you’re 
interested in exploring either printing feature, 
your camera manual provides complete details.

260
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect 
perfect color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t 
reproduce the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addi-
tion, monitor colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, 
generated with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same 
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source 
has its own influence on the colors you see.
Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the 
one in Figure 9-6? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital 
photo that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your 
monitor.
 
 
Figure 9-6: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.

261
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number 
of pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and 
the capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the 
average photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess 
of what the monitor can handle. Figure 9-6, for example, shows you how 
much of a 6-megapixel image is viewable when displayed in a typical e-mail 
program window.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 640 pixels at its 
longest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture 
without scrolling, as in Figure 9-7. This image measures 640 x 428 pixels. As 
you can see, it’s plenty large enough to provide a decent photo-viewing expe-
rience. On a small monitor, it may even be too large.
 
 
Figure 9-7: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 640 pixels wide or tall.
This size recommendation means that even if you shoot at your D5000’s 
lowest Image Size setting (2144 x 1424 pixels), you need to dump pixels from 
your images before sending them to the cyber post office. You have a couple 
of options for creating an e-mail–sized image:

262
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Use the Small Picture feature on your camera’s Retouch menu. This fea-
ture enables you to create your e-mail copy right in the camera.
 
✓ Downsample the image in your photo editor. Downsampling is geekspeak 
for dumping pixels. Most photo editors offer a feature that handles this 
process for you. Use this option if you want to crop or otherwise edit 
the photo before sharing it.
The next two sections walk you through the steps for both ways of creating 
your e-mail images. You can use the same steps, by the way, for sizing images 
for any onscreen use, whether it’s for a Web page or multimedia presentation. 
You may want your copies to be larger or smaller than the recommended 
e-mail size for those uses, however. 
 
One last point about onscreen images: Remember that pixel count has abso-
lutely no effect on the quality of pictures displayed onscreen. Pixel count 
determines only the size at which your images are displayed.
Creating small copies using the camera
To create small, e-mailable copies of your images without using a computer, 
use your camera’s Small Picture feature. Here’s how:
 
 
1. Press the Playback button to set your camera to playback mode.
 
 
2. Display the picture in single-image view.
 
 If the monitor currently displays multiple thumbnails, just press the OK 
button to switch to single-image view.
 
3. Press OK to display the Retouch menu over your image, as shown on 
the left in Figure 9-8.
 
4. Highlight Small Picture and press OK or press the Multi Selector right.
 
 
Figure 9-8: The Small Picture feature creates a low-resolution, e-mail–friendly copy of a photo.

263
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in the figure. You can choose 
from three size options (stated in pixels) for your small copy. 
 
5. Highlight the size you want to use for your copy.
 
 For pictures that you plan to send via e-mail, choose either 640 x 480 or 
320 x 240 pixels unless the recipient is connected to the Internet via a 
very slow, dial-up modem connection. In that case, you may want to go 
one step down, to 160 x 120 pixels. (The display size of the picture may 
be quite small at that setting however, depending on the resolution of 
the monitor on which the picture is viewed.)
 
 If you’re a math lover, you may have noticed that all the size options 
create pictures that have an aspect ratio of 4:3, while your original 
images have an aspect ratio of 3:2. The camera trims the small-copy 
image as needed to fit the 4:3 proportions. Unfortunately, you don’t 
have any input over what portion of the image is cropped away.
 
6. Press OK or press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a screen asking you to confirm that you want to create a small copy.
 
7. Highlight Yes and press OK.
 
 The camera duplicates the selected image and downsamples the copy 
(eliminates pixels) to achieve the size you specified in Step 5. Your 
original picture file remains untouched.
 
If you want to create small copies of several photos on your memory card, 
you can go another route: Take the camera out of Playback mode and then 
display the Retouch menu. Select the Small Picture option and press OK. On 
the next screen, select the Choose Size option and specify the pixel count for 
your small copies. After doing so, press OK, choose the Select Image option, 
and press OK again to display thumbnails of all your pictures. Move the 
yellow highlight box over a thumbnail 
and press the Zoom Out button to 
“tag” the photo for copying. (You see 
a little icon in the top-right corner of 
the thumbnail; press the button again 
to remove the tag if you change your 
mind.) After selecting all your pic-
tures, press OK to display the copy-
confirmation screen; highlight Yes and 
press OK once more to wrap things up.
When you view your small-size 
copies on the camera monitor, they 
appear surrounded by a gray border, 
as shown in Figure 9-9. A tiny Retouch 
icon appears on the display as well, 
Retouch icom
Figure 9-9: The gray border indicates a 
small-size copy.

264
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
as labeled in the figure. Note that you can’t zoom in to magnify the view of 
small-size copies as you can your original images.
Pictures that you create using the Small Picture feature are given filenames 
that start with the letters SSC. The camera automatically assigns a filenumber 
(the number is different from that of your original file, unfortunately). 
Downsizing images in Nikon ViewNX
You can also create a low-resolution, JPEG copy of your image in ViewNX. 
However, be aware that the program restricts you to a minimum size of 320 
pixels along the photo’s longest side. If you need a smaller version, use the 
in-camera Small Picture option to create the copy instead. Or, if you own a 
photo editing program, investigate its image-resizing capabilities; you likely 
can create the small copy at any dimensions you like.
Assuming that the 320-pixel restriction isn’t a problem, the following steps 
show you how to create your small-size copy in ViewNX. You can use this 
process to create a small JPEG copy of both JPEG and NEF (RAW) originals.
 
1. Select the image thumbnail in the main ViewNX window.
 
 Chapter 8 explains how to view your image thumbnails, if you need help. 
Just click a thumbnail to select it.
 
2.  Choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 You see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-10. (As with other figures, this 
one shows the box as it appears in Windows Vista; it may appear slightly 
different on a Mac or in other versions of Windows, but the essentials 
are the same.)
 
3. Select JPEG from the File Format drop-down list, as shown in the 
figure.
 
 The other format option, TIFF, is a print format. Web browsers and 
e-mail programs can’t display TIFF images, so be sure to use JPEG.
 
4. Select the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 Now the Short Edge and Long Edge text boxes become available. 
 
5. Type the desired pixel count of the longest side of your picture into 
the Long Edge box.
 
 The program automatically adjusts the Short Edge value to keep the 
resized image proportional. (The image is not cropped to a 4:3 per-
spective as it is when you use the Small Copy feature on the camera’s 
Retouch menu.)

265
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
Figure 9-10: You also can use ViewNX to create a small-sized 
JPEG copy for e-mail sharing.
 
 Again, to ensure that the picture is viewable without scrolling when 
opened in the recipient’s e-mail program, I suggest that you keep the 
Long Edge value at 640 pixels or less.
 
6. Adjust the Compression Ratio slider to set the amount of JPEG file 
compression.
 
 As Chapter 3 explains, a greater degree of compression results in a 
smaller file, which takes less time to download over the Web, but it 
reduces image quality. Notice that as you move the slider to the right, 
the resulting quality level appears above the slider. For example, in 
Figure 9-10, the level is Excellent Quality.
 
 Because the resolution of your image already results in a very small file, 
you can probably use the highest quality setting without worrying too 
much about download times. The exception is if you plan to attach mul-
tiple pictures to the same e-mail message, in which case you may want 
to set the slider a notch or two down from the highest quality setting.

266
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
7. Select the next three check boxes (Remove Camera Setting Information, 
Remove XMP/IPTC Information, and Remove ICC Color Profile), as 
shown in Figure 9-10. 
 
 When selected, the three options save the resized picture without the 
original image metadata, the extra text data that your camera stores 
with the image. (Chapter 8 explains.) Including this metadata adds to 
the file size, so for normal e-mail sharing, strip it out. The exception, of 
course, is when you want the recipient to be able to view the metadata 
in a photo program that can do so.
 
8. Set the file destination.
 
 In layman’s terms, that just means to tell the program the location of 
the folder or drive where you want to store your downsized image file. 
You have two Save In options: Choose the first option to put the file in 
the same folder as the original, or select Specified Folder to put the file 
somewhere else. If you choose the first option, you’re done. If you choose 
the second option, the last folder you specified is shown to the left of the 
Browse button. To choose a different folder, click that Browse button.
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can create a new subfolder within your selected storage folder. 
If you do, the resized file goes into that subfolder, which you can name 
by clicking the Naming Options button.
 
9. (Optional) Specify a filename for the resized copy.
 
 If you want to put the small copy in the same folder as the original, the pro-
gram protects you from overwriting the original by automatically assign-
ing a slightly different name to the copy. By default, the program uses the 
original filename plus a two-number sequential tag: If the original filename 
is DSC_0186.jpg, for example, the small-copy filename is DSC_0186_01.jpg. 
You can change a couple of aspects of this filenaming routine by selecting 
the Change File Names check box and then clicking the Naming Options 
button and adjusting the settings in the resulting dialog box. After making 
your wishes known, click OK to return to the Convert Files dialog box.
 
 If you don’t store the copy in the same folder as the original, the pro-
gram doesn’t alter the filename of the copy automatically. That can lead 
to problems down the road because you will end up with two files, both 
with the same name but with different pixel counts, on your computer. 
In this scenario, be sure to input your own filenames for your copies.
 
10. Click the Convert button to finish the process.
 
ViewNX also offers an e-mail wizard that enables you to resize and send 
photos by e-mail in one step. If you use this feature, however, you don’t 
create an actual small-size copy of your file; the program simply reduces the 
size of the file temporarily for e-mail transmission. Also, the wizard works 
only with certain e-mail programs. On the plus side, the wizard permits you 
to send a photo at a much smaller size than you can create with the Convert 
Files feature. For more details, check out the ViewNX Help system.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Creating a Digital Slide Show
Many photo editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital 
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a 
DVD player. You can even add music, captions, graphics, special effects, and 
the like to jazz up your presentations.
But if you want to create a simple slide show — that is, one that simply dis-
plays the photo on the camera memory card one by one — you don’t need a 
computer or any photo software. You can create and run the show right on 
your camera. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in 
the last section of this chapter, you can present your show to a whole room-
ful of people.
Follow these steps to create a simple slide show on your computer:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Slide Show, as shown on the 
left in Figure 9-11.
 
2. Press OK to display the Slide Show screen shown on the right in 
Figure 9-11.
 
3. Highlight Frame Interval and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 On the next screen, you can specify how long you want each image to be 
displayed. You can set the interval to 2, 3, 5, or 10 seconds.
 
4. Highlight the frame interval you want to use and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Slide Show screen.
 
5. To start the show, highlight Start and press OK.
 
 The camera begins displaying your pictures on the camera monitor.
Online photo sharing: Read the fine print
If you want to share more than a couple of 
photos, consider posting your images at an 
online photo-album site instead of attaching 
them to e-mail messages. Photo-sharing sites 
such as Shutterfly, Kodak Gallery, and Picasa all 
enable you to create digital photo albums and 
then invite friends and family to view your pic-
tures and order prints of their favorites.
At most sites, picture-sharing is free, but your 
albums and images are deleted if you don’t 
order prints or make some other purchase 
from the site within a specified amount of time. 
Additionally, many free sites enable you to 
upload high-resolution files for printing but then 
don’t let you retrieve those files from the site. (In 
other words, don’t think of album sites as archi-
val storage solutions.) And here’s another little 
bit of fine print to investigate: The membership 
agreement at some sites states that you agree 
to let the site use your photos, for free, for any 
purpose that it sees fit.

Figure 9-11: Choose Slide Show to set up automatic playback of all pictures on your memory 
 
card.
When the show ends, you see a screen offering three options: You can 
choose to restart the show, adjust the frame interval, or exit to the Playback 
menu. Highlight your choice and press OK.
During the show, you can control playback as follows:
 
✓ Pause the show. Press OK. Select Restart and press OK to begin display-
ing pictures again. When you pause the slide show, you also have the 
option to change the interval — a handy option if the pace is too quick 
or slow — or exit the show. To change frame interval, highlight the 
option and press OK. Choose the desired interval from the next screen, 
and press OK. Highlight Restart and press OK to restart the show with 
the new interval.
 
✓ Exit the show. You’ve got three options: 
 
• To return to full-frame, regular playback, press the Playback 
button.
 
• To return to the Playback menu, press the Menu button.
 
• To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button 
halfway.
 
✓ Skip to the next/previous image manually. Press the Multi Selector or 
rotate the Command dial.
 
✓ Change the information displayed with the image. Press the Multi 
Selector up or down to cycle through the info-display modes. (See 
Chapter 4 for details on what information is provided in each mode.)

Turning Still Photos into a Stop-Motion Movie
Chapter 4 explains how to record live-action movies with your D5000. But 
hidden away on the Retouch menu is another tool for the budding filmmaker. 
By using the Stop-Motion Movie feature, you can combine a series of still 
images into brief, animation-style digital videos that can be played on the 
computer. You also can connect your camera to a TV for playback; see the 
next section for details.
One popular use of this feature is to animate still objects, similar to what 
Hollywood types do when producing so-called “claymation” movies. Here’s 
an example: You take 50 shots of a riderless tricycle on your driveway. Before 
each shot, you rotate the pedals slightly to move the bike forward so that 
each image captures the bike at a different spot on the driveway. In your fin-
ished movie, the individual images are displayed sequentially, at a pace rapid 
enough to create the illusion that the bike is moving across the driveway by 
itself, as if it had a ghost rider. 
You can also use the Stop-Motion Movie feature to reanimate a subject that 
was actually moving of its own volition during your shoot. For example, on 
a recent trip to a local garden, I spotted a butterfly posing on a leaf. As he 
opened and closed his wings, I clicked off a rapid-fire series of images so that 
I could capture his wings at different positions. Turned into a stop-motion 
movie, the images blended together to reproduce the fluttering of the butter-
fly’s wings.
Lest you get the wrong idea here, I should stress that the Stop-Motion Movie 
feature isn’t designed as a substitute for your camera’s movie-recording 
feature. First, the stop-motion movies can be recorded and played at a maxi-
mum of 15 frames per second, whereas you get 24 frames per second — the 
standard for motion-picture films — if you record a regular movie. The differ-
ence means that your stop-motion movies appear a little jerky — more like 
what you see when you fast-forward through a movie on DVD.
Second, the number of images in a stop-motion movie is limited to 100. So 
if you have 100 frames, played back at 15 frames per second, the maximum 
length of your stop-motion movie is just shy of 7 seconds. If you want a 
longer stop-motion movie, you need to create separate movie files and then 
join them together in a video editing program. If you use the Windows XP 
or Vista operating system, you can use the free Movie Maker application. If 
you’re on a Mac, you can use iMovie to splice your movie files together.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Despite its limitations, though, the Stop-Motion Movie feature provides an 
interesting creative project when you’re having a boring day. To get started, 
first record a series of images of a moving subject. The images in the exam-
ples here are of an American flag that was rippling in a stiff breeze. After you 
have your images recorded, take these steps to turn them into a movie:
 
1. Open the Retouch menu, 
highlight Stop-Motion Movie, 
as shown in Figure 9-12, and 
press OK.
 
 You see the three options shown 
on the left in Figure 9-13.
 
2. Highlight Frame Size and press 
the Multi Selector right.
 
 Now you see the screen shown 
on the right in Figure 9-13. Here, 
you set the size of the movie 
frames, in pixels. The larger the 
size, the larger you can view the 
finished movie. But a larger frame 
size also means a larger data file 
needed to store the movie. So for online sharing, consider using one of 
the two smaller sizes to reduce the time people must spend download-
ing the file.
 
 To understand how pixels display onscreen, whether it’s a TV or com-
puter monitor, see “Preparing Pictures for E-Mail,” earlier in this chap-
ter. Chapter 3 offers some additional tips about pixels.
 
3. Select a frame size and press OK.

your memory card.

photos.

4. Highlight Frame Rate, as shown on the left in Figure 9-14, and press 
the Multi Selector right.
 
 You’re presented with the screen shown on the right in the figure. Here, you 
specify the number of frames per second in your movie. The higher the frame 
rate, the smoother the playback, but the shorter the movie you can create.
 
 
Figure 9-14: For the smoothest playback, choose 15 frames per second (fps).
 
5. Select a frame rate and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the main Stop-Motion Movie screen. 
 
6. Highlight Create Movie, as shown on the left in Figure 9-15, and press OK.
 
 You see a screen similar to the one on the right in Figure 9-15, with 
thumbnails of the images on your memory card.
 
7. Highlight the image that you want to use as the starting shot in the movie.
 
 Notice that one thumbnail is surrounded by a yellow box and is marked 
with the word Start — in Figure 9-15, it’s the middle image. Press the 
Multi Selector right or left until the image that you want to use to kick off 
your movie appears under the Start frame.
 
 
Figure 9-15: Select the image that you want to use as the starting frame of the movie.

8. Press OK to select the high-
lighted image.
 
 The highlight is then replaced 
with a version that says End 
instead of Start, as shown in 
Figure 9-16.
 
9. Highlight the image that will be 
the last one in the movie and 
press OK.
 
 Again, just press the Multi 
Selector right or left to scroll the 
images across the screen until 
the one you want to use appears 
under the End frame. Don’t worry if there are frames between the Start 
and End images that you don’t want to include in the movie; you can 
exclude them in the next step.
 
 The little “filmstrip” at the bottom of the screen displays thumbnails of 
the images you selected as the Start and End pictures, as shown on the 
left in Figure 9-17.
 
 
Figure 9-17: Select Edit to exclude frames or change the start or end frame.
 
10. Edit out any unwanted intermediate frames (optional).
 
 If you don’t want to include one or more of the frames that fall between 
your start and end frames, highlight Edit, as shown on the left in Figure 
9-17, and press OK. You then see the screen shown on the right in the 
figure. Highlight Middle Image and press OK to return to a thumbnail 
view that displays all the frames between your start and end images, as 
shown in Figure 9-18.
 
 Images marked with a check mark are tagged to be included in the 
movie. Press the Multi Selector left or right to highlight a frame and 
then press up or down to toggle the check mark on or off. Press OK after 
Figure 9-16: Select the ending frame of the 
movie.

273
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
you’ve unchecked all the frames 
you don’t want to include. You 
see then the screen shown on the 
left in Figure 9-17.
 
 Should you decide to change the 
start or end frame, select Starting 
Image or End Image instead of 
Middle Image when you see 
the screen shown on the right 
in Figure 9-17. Then simply re-
choose your start or end frame 
and press OK.
 
11. At the bottom of the Change 
Settings screen (left screen in 
Figure 9-19), highlight Save and press OK.
 
 The camera saves your changes and presents the Create Movie screen, 
shown on the right in the figure.
 
 
Figure 9-19: Choose Preview to take a look at your movie before you actually save the file.
 
12. Highlight Preview and press OK.
 
 The camera plays a preview of your movie. If you’re not happy with the 
results, you can take two routes:
 
• Adjust the Frame Rate. Highlight Frame Rate and press OK to adjust 
the frame rate that you selected in Steps 4 and 5. 
 
• Select different images for the movie. Highlight Edit and press OK 
to return to the Edit screen (see the right figure in Figure 9-17) to 
change the start, end, or intermediate images in the movie. After 
you do so, press OK to return to the Create Movie screen you see 
on the right in Figure 9-19.
Figure 9-18: Frames with a check mark are 
included in the movie.

274
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
13. Highlight Save and press OK.
 
 The camera takes a few seconds 
to process and store the movie 
file, which is recorded in a stan-
dard digital movie format known 
as AVI. Then the first image in 
the movie appears in full frame 
on the monitor, as shown in 
Figure 9-20.
To play the movie, press OK when you 
see the screen shown in Figure 9-20. 
During playback, an icon appears 
that looks like the Multi Selector. Press OK to pause the move, press left to 
go back, right to go forward, and up to stop playback and display the movie 
thumbnail.
 
After you transfer your image files to the computer, you also can view your 
movie in any program that can handle AVI files.
Viewing Your Photos on a Television
Tired of passing your camera around 
to show people your pictures or 
movies on the monitor? Why not 
display them on a television instead? 
Your D5000 is equipped with both an 
HDMI outlet, or port, for connecting 
the camera to a high-definition TV 
(or other video device), and an AV 
(audio/visual) port, for connecting 
the camera to a regular TV or video 
device. Both ports are tucked under 
the little rubber cover on the left-rear 
side of the camera and highlighted in 
Figure 9-21. A cable for making a regu-
lar video connection is included in the 
camera box. (It’s the cable that has 
two plugs at one end, one white and 
one yellow.) For HDMI connections, 
you need to purchase a cable. You 
need something called a Type C 
mini-pin cable.
Figure 9-20: Movie files are stored in the AVI 
digital video format.

275
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Before connecting your camera, double-check the following menu options, 
both on the Setup menu and shown in Figure 9-22:
 
✓ Video Mode: You get just two options here: NTSC and PAL. Select the 
video mode that is used by your part of the world. (In the United States, 
Canada, and Mexico, NTSC is the standard.)
 
✓ HDMI: Unless you have trouble, stick with the Auto setting; the camera 
then automatically selects the right format for the HD device you’re 
using. You also can select from four different formats, if you feel 
comfortable doing so.
 
 
Figure 9-22: The options related to television playback live on the Setup menu.
 
Whether you go high def or regular def — what the industry now wants us to 
call standard definition — turn the camera off before connecting the devices. 
For a regular video connection, note that the white plug carries the audio 
signal, and the yellow one carries the video signal. With HDMI, everything 
goes through a single connector, and as soon as the two are linked, you can 
view your photos only on the HDMI screen.
When the two devices are connected, turn the camera and TV or video 
device on. At this point, you need to consult your TV manual to find out what 
channel to select for playback of signals from auxiliary input devices like 
your camera. After you sort that issue out, you can control playback using 
the same camera controls as you normally do to view pictures and movies 
on your camera monitor. You can also run slide shows by following the steps 
outlined in the two preceding sections in this book.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n time-honored For Dummies tradition, this 
part of the book contains additional tidbits 
of information presented in the always popular 
“Top Ten” list format. Chapter 10 shows you how 
to do some minor picture touchups, such as 
cropping and adjusting exposure, by using tools 
on your camera’s Retouch menu. Following that, 
Chapter 11 introduces you to ten camera func-
tions that I consider specialty tools — bonus 
options that, while not at the top of the list of the 
features I suggest you study, are nonetheless 
interesting to explore when you have a free 
moment or two.

When it happens to you, don’t be too quick to reach for 
the Delete button, because many common problems are 
surprisingly easy to fix. In fact, you often can repair 
your photos right in the camera, thanks to tools found 
on the Retouch menu. You can even create some 
special effects with a couple of the menu options.
This chapter offers step-by-step recipes for using 
ten of these photo-repair and enhancement features. 
Additionally, I received special dispensation from 
the For Dummies folks to start things off with an 
additional section that summarizes tips that relate 
to all the Retouch menu options. In the words of Nigel 
Tufnel from the legendary rock band Spinal Tap, “This 
one goes to 11!”
Applying the Retouch Menu Filters
 
When you apply a correction or enhancement from the Retouch menu, the 
camera creates a copy of your original photo and then makes the changes to 
the copy only. Your original is preserved untouched.

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
You can take advantage of most Retouch menu features in two ways:
 
✓ Display the menu, select the tool you want to use, and press OK. You’re 
then presented with thumbnails of your photos. Use the Multi Selector 
to move the yellow highlight box over the photo you want to adjust and 
press OK. You next see options related to the selected tool.
 
 
✓ Switch the camera to playback mode, display your photo in single-frame 
view, and press OK. (Remember, you can shift from thumbnail display to 
single-frame view simply by pressing the OK button.) The Retouch menu 
then appears superimposed over your photo. Select the tool you want to 
use and press OK again to access the tool options. I prefer the second 
method, so that’s how I approach things in this chapter, but it’s entirely 
a personal choice.
 
The one Retouch menu feature you can’t access by using the first technique 
is the Side-by-Side comparison option. This feature enables you to compare 
the original image and the retouched version side by side on the monitor. 
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Display either the original or edited picture in single-image view, as 
shown on the left in Figure 10-1.
 
 
Figure 10-1: In single-image playback mode, press OK to superimpose the Retouch menu over 
 
the photo.
 
 See Chapter 4 if you need help with picture playback.
 
2. Press OK.
 
 A variation of the Retouch menu appears superimposed on the image, as 
shown on the right in Figure 10-1.

281
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
3. Highlight Side-by-Side 
Comparison and press OK.
 
 Now you see the original image in 
the left half of the frame, with the 
retouched version on the right, as 
shown in Figure 10-2. At the top 
of the screen, you see labels that 
indicate the Retouch tools you 
applied to the photo (Fisheye, in 
the figure).
 
 If you created multiple retouched 
versions of the same original, you 
can compare all the versions. 
First, press the Multi Selector 
right or left to surround the After image with the yellow highlight box. 
Now press the Multi Selector up and down to scroll through all the 
retouched versions.
 
 
4. To temporarily view the original or retouched image at full-frame 
view, use the Multi Selector to highlight its thumbnail and then press 
and hold the Zoom In button.
 
 Release the button to return to side-by-side view.
 
5. To exit side-by-side view and return to single-image playback, 
press the playback button or OK.
 
All retouched copies are saved in the JPEG file format and assigned a file-
name that begins with one of the following three-letter codes:
 
✓ SSC: Used for photos that you crop using the Small Picture function.
 
✓ CSC: Indicates that you applied one of the other Retouch menu 
corrections.
As a reminder, original photos have filenames that begin either with DSC 
or _DSC. (The underscore at the front of the filename tells you that you 
recorded the photo using the Adobe RGB color mode, an option you can 
explore in Chapter 6.)
 
The specific file numbers of retouched copies don’t match those of the origi-
nal, however, which can be a little confusing. Make note of the filename the 
retouched version is assigned so that you can easily track it down later. What 
numbering the camera chooses depends on the numbers of the files already 
on your memory card.
Figure 10-2: The original appears on the left; 
the retouched version, on the right.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the D5000. 
Typically, the problem occurs only in very dark lighting, which makes sense: 
When little ambient light is available, the pupils of the subjects’ eyes widen, 
creating more potential for the flash light to cause red-eye reflection.
If you spot a red-eye problem, however, give the Red-Eye Correction filter a try: 
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK.
 
 The Retouch menu appears over your photo.
 
2. Highlight Red-Eye Correction, as shown on the left in Figure 10-3, and 
press OK.
 
 
Figure 10-3: An automated red-eye remover is built right into your camera.
 
 If the camera detects red-eye, it applies the removal filter and displays 
the results in the monitor. If the camera can’t find any red-eye, it dis-
plays a message telling you so.
 
 Note that the Red-Eye Correction option appears dimmed in the menu 
for photos taken without flash.
 
3. Carefully inspect the repair.
 
 
 Press the Zoom In button to magnify the display so that you can check 
the camera’s work, as shown on the right in Figure 10-3. To scroll the 
display, press the Multi Selector up, down, right, or left. The yellow box 
in the tiny navigation window in the lower-right corner of the screen 
indicates the area of the picture that you’re currently viewing.
 
4. If you approve of the correction, press OK twice.
 
 The first OK returns the display to normal magnification; the second 
creates the retouched copy.

283
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
5. If you’re not happy with the results, press OK to return to normal mag-
nification. Then press the Playback button to cancel the repair.
 
If the in-camera red-eye repair fails you, most photo editing programs 
have red-eye removal tools that should enable you to get the job done. 
Unfortunately, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes. Red-eye removal 
tools know how to detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes 
typically turn yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. The easiest solu-
tion is to use the paintbrush tool found in most photo editors to paint in the 
proper eye colors.
Straightening Tilting Horizon Lines
I seem to have a knack for shooting with the camera slightly misaligned with 
respect to the horizon line, which means that photos like the one on the left 
in Figure 10-4 often wind up crooked — in this case, everything tilts down 
toward the right corner of the frame. Perhaps those who say I have a cock-
eyed view of life are right? At any rate, my inability to “shoot straight” makes 
me especially fond of the Straighten tool on the Retouch menu. With this 
filter, you can rotate tilting horizons back to the proper angle, as shown in 
the right image in the figure.
 
Original
Straightened
 
Figure 10-4: You can rotate crooked photos back to a level orientation with the 
 
Straighten tool.

284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
In order to achieve this rotation magic, the camera must crop your image 
and then enlarge the remaining area — that’s why the after photo in Figure 
10-4 contains slightly less subject matter than the original. (The same crop-
ping occurs if you make this kind of change in a photo editor.) The camera 
updates the display as you rotate the photo so that you can get an idea of 
how much of the original scene may be lost.
Here’s how to put the tool to work:
 
1. Display the photo in single-image playback mode and then press OK 
to get to the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Straighten, as shown on the left in Figure 10-5, and press OK.
 
 Now you see a screen similar to the one on the right in the figure, with a 
grid superimposed on your photo to serve as an alignment aid.
 
 
Figure 10-5: Press the Multi Selector right or left to rotate the image in increments of 25 
 
degrees.
 
3. To rotate the picture clockwise, press the Multi Selector right.
 
 Each press spins the picture by about .25 degrees. You can achieve a 
maximum rotation of five degrees. The yellow pointer on the little scale 
under the photo shows you the current amount of rotation.
 
4. To rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, press the Multi Selector left.
 
5. When things are no longer off-kilter, press OK to create your 
retouched copy.

285
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
Shadow Recovery with D-Lighting
In Chapter 5, I introduce you to a feature called Active D-Lighting. If you turn 
on this option when you shoot a picture, the camera captures the image in 
a way that brightens the darkest parts of the image, bringing shadow detail 
into the light, while leaving highlight details intact. It’s a great trick for deal-
ing with high-contrast scenes or subjects that are backlit.
You also can apply a similar adjustment after you take a picture by choosing 
the D-Lighting option on the Retouch menu. I did just that for the photo in 
Figure 10-6, where strong backlighting left the balloon underexposed in the 
original image.
 
Original image
D-Lighting, High
 
Figure 10-6: An underexposed photo (left) gets help from the D-Lighting filter (right).
Here’s how to apply the filter:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image mode and then press OK to display 
the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight D-Lighting, as shown on the left in Figure 10-7, and press OK.
 
 You see a thumbnail of your original image along with an after thumb-
nail, as shown in the second image in Figure 10-7.
 
3. Select the level of adjustment by pressing the Multi Selector up or 
down.
 
 You get three levels: Low, Normal, and High. I used High for the repair to 
my balloon image.

286

 To get a closer view of the adjusted photo, press and hold the Zoom In 
button. Release the button to return to the two-thumbnail display.
 
 
4. To go forward with the correction, press OK.
 
 The camera creates your retouched copy.
 
Note that you can’t apply D-Lighting to an image if you captured the photo 
with the Picture Control feature set to Monochrome. (See Chapter 6 for 
details on Picture Controls.) Nor does D-Lighting work on any pictures 
to which you’ve applied the Quick Retouch filter, covered next, or the 
Monochrome filter, detailed a little later in this chapter. 
Boosting Shadows, Contrast, 
and Saturation Together
The Quick Retouch filter increases contrast and saturation and, if your sub-
ject is backlit, also applies a D-Lighting adjustment to restore some shadow 
detail that otherwise might be lost. In other words, Quick Retouch is sort of 
like D-Lighting on steroids. Well, kind of, anyway.
Figure 10-8 illustrates the difference between the two filters. The first 
example shows my original, a close-up shot of a tree bud about to emerge. 
I applied the D-Lighting filter to the second example, which brightened the 
darkest areas of the image. In the final example, I applied the Quick Retouch 
filter. Again, shadows got a slight bump up the brightness scale. But the filter 
also increased color saturation and adjusted the overall image to expand the 

287
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
tonal range across the entire bright-
ness spectrum, from very dark to very 
bright. In this photo, the saturation 
change is most noticeable in the yel-
lows and reds of the tree bud. (The 
sky color may initially appear to be 
less saturated, but in fact, it’s just a 
lighter hue than the original, thanks to 
the contrast adjustment.) 
To try the filter out, display your 
photo in single-image playback mode 
and press OK to bring up the Retouch 
menu. Highlight Quick Retouch, as 
shown on the left in Figure 10-9, and 
press OK to display the second screen 
in the figure.
As with the D-Lighting filter, you can 
set the level of adjustment to Low, 
Normal, or High. Just press the Multi 
Selector up or down to change the 
setting. (For my example photos, I 
applied both the D-Lighting and Quick 
Retouch filters at the Normal level.) 
Press OK to finalize the job and create 
your retouched copy.
 
Note that the same issues related to 
D-Lighting, spelled out in the preced-
ing section, apply here as well: You 
can’t apply the Quick Retouch filter 
to monochrome images. Additionally, 
you can’t apply the Quick Retouch 
filter to a retouched copy that you cre-
ated by applying the D-Lighting filter, 
and vice versa. However, you can 
create two retouched copies of your 
original image, applying D-Lighting to 
one and Quick Retouch to the other. 
You then can use the Side-by-Side 
Comparison feature to compare the 
retouched versions to see which one 
you prefer.

Two Ways to Tweak Color
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s White Balance and Picture Control 
features to manipulate photo colors. But even if you play with those settings 
all day, you may wind up with colors that you’d like to tweak just a tad.
You can boost color saturation with the Quick Retouch filter, explained in the pre-
ceding section. But that tool also adjusts contrast and, depending on the photo, 
also applies a D-Lighting correction. With the Filter Effects and Color Balance 
tools, however, you can manipulate color only. The next two sections tell all.
Applying digital lens filters
Shown in Figure 10-10, the Filter Effects option offers five color-manipulation 
filters that are designed to mimic the results produced by traditional lens 
filters. (The other two filters on the menu, Cross Screen and Soft Focus, are 
special-effects filters that you can explore in Chapter 11.) The color-shifting 
filters work like so:
 
 
Figure 10-10: You can choose from seven effects that mimic traditional lens filters.

289
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
✓ Skylight filter: This filter reduces the amount of blue in an image. The 
result is a very subtle warming effect. That is, colors take on a bit of a 
reddish cast.
 
✓ Warm filter: This one produces a warming effect that’s just a bit stron-
ger than the Skylight filter.
 
✓ Color intensifiers: You can boost the intensity of reds, greens, or blues 
individually by applying these filters. 
As an example, Figure 10-11 shows you an original image and three adjusted 
versions. As you can see, the Skylight and Warm filters are both very subtle; in 
this image, the effects are most noticeable in the sky. The fourth example shows 
a variation created by using the Color Balance filter, explained in the next sec-
tion, and shifting colors toward the cool (bluish) side of the color spectrum.

The Color Balance tool enables you to adjust colors with more finesse than 
the Filter Effects options. With this filter, you can shift colors toward any 
part of the color spectrum. For example, shifting colors toward the cooler — 
bluer — spectrum produced the fourth example in Figure 10-11.
Take these steps to give it a whirl:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image playback mode and press OK.
 
 Up pops the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Color Balance, as shown on the left in Figure 10-12.

3. Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in the figure.
 
 The important control here is the color grid in the lower-left corner. 
When the little black box is in the center of the grid, as in the figure, no 
color-balance adjustment has been applied.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to move the black square in the direction of the 
color adjustment you want to make.
 
 Press up to make the image more green, press right to make it more red, 
and so on. The histograms on the right side of the display show you the 
resulting impact on overall image brightness, as well as on the individual 
red, green, and blue brightness values — a bit of information that’s help-
ful if you’re an experienced student in the science of reading histograms. 
(Chapter 4 gives you an introduction.) If not, just check the image pre-
view to monitor your results.
 
5. Press OK to create the color-adjusted copy of your photo.
Creating Monochrome Photos
With the Monochrome Picture Control feature covered in Chapter 6, you 
can shoot black-and-white photos. Technically, the camera takes a full-color 
picture and then strips it of color as it’s recording the image to the memory 
card, but the end result is the same.
As an alternative, you can create a black-and-white copy of an existing color 
photo by applying the Monochrome option on the Retouch menu. You can 
also create sepia and cyanotype (blue and white) images via the Monochrome 
option. Figure 10-13 shows you examples of all three effects.
 
I prefer to convert my color photos to monochrome images in my photo 
editor; going that route simply offers more control, not to mention the fact 
that it’s easier to preview your results on a large computer monitor than on 
the camera monitor. Still, I know that not everyone’s as much of a photo edit-
ing geek as I am, so I present to you here the steps involved in applying the 
Monochrome effects to a color original in your camera:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK to bring the 
Retouch menu to life, as shown on the left in Figure 10-14.

4. To adjust the intensity of the sepia or cyanotype effect, press the Multi 
Selector up or down.
 
 No adjustment is available for the black-and-white filter.
 
5. Press OK to create the monochrome copy.
Removing (Or Creating) Lens Distortion
Certain types of lenses can produce a type of distortion that causes straight 
lines in a scene to appear curved. Wide-angle lenses, for example, often 
create barrel distortion, in which objects at the center appear to be magnified 
and pushed forward — as if you wrapped the photo around the outside of a 
sphere. The effect is perhaps easiest to spot in a rectangular subject like the 
oil painting in Figure 10-15. Notice that in the original image, on the left, the 
edges of the painting appear to bow slightly outward. Pincushion distortion 
affects the photo in the opposite way, making center objects appear smaller 
and farther away, as if you wrapped the photo around the inside of a sphere.
 
You can minimize the chances of distortion by researching your lens 
purchases carefully. Photography magazines and online photography sites 
regularly measure and report distortion performance in their lens reviews.

Slight barrel distortion
After Distortion Correction filter
 
Figure 10-15: Barrel distortion makes straight lines appear to bow outward.
If you do notice a small amount of distortion, your D5000 offers two potential 
fixes. First, you can try enabling the Auto Distortion Control option on the 
Shooting menu. This feature attempts to correct distortion as you take the 
picture. (Chapter 6 has details.) Or you may prefer to wait until after review-
ing your photos and then use the Distortion control on the Retouch menu to 
try to fix things. I applied the filter to create the second version of the subject 
in Figure 10-15, for example. Less helpful, in my opinion, is a related filter, the 
Fisheye filter, that actually creates distortion in an attempt to replicate the 
look of a photo taken with a fisheye lens.
 
The extent of the in-camera adjustment you can apply is fairly minimal. 
Additionally, I find it a little difficult to gauge my results on the camera 
monitor because you can’t display any sort of alignment grid over the image to 
help you find the right degree of correction. For those reasons, I prefer to do this 
kind of work in my photo editor. Wherever you make the correction, understand 
that distortion correction filters crop away part of your existing scene as part 
of the alteration, just like the Straighten tool, covered earlier in this chapter.
All that said, the first step in applying either filter is to display your photo in 
single-image playback mode and then press OK to display the Retouch menu. 
Highlight the filter you want to use (Distortion Control or Fisheye) and press 
OK again. From that point, the process depends on which of the two filters 
you’re using:
 
✓ Distortion Control: After you press OK to select the Distortion Control 
filter, you see the screen shown on the left in Figure 10-16. For some 
lenses, an Auto option is available; as its name implies, this option 
attempts to automatically apply the right degree of correction. If the 
Auto option is dimmed or you prefer to do the correction on your own, 
choose Manual and press OK to display the right screen in the figure. 
The little scale under the image represents the degree and direction of 
shift that you’re applying. Press the Multi Selector right to reduce barrel 
distortion; press left to reduce pincushioning. Press OK when you’re 
ready to make your corrected copy of the photo.

295
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
 
 
Figure 10-16: Use the Distortion Control filter to reduce barrel or pincushion distortion.
 
✓ Fisheye: After you highlight the filter name and press OK, you see a 
screen similar to the right one in Figure 10-16. This time, you see the 
word Fisheye at the top of the screen, however, and the scale at the 
bottom of the image indicates the strength of the distortion effect. Press 
the Multi Selector right or left to adjust the amount. Then press OK to 
create the fisheye copy.
Correcting Perspective
When you photograph a tall building and tilt the camera to get it all in the 
frame, an effect called convergence or keystoning occurs. This effect causes 
vertical structures to appear to be leaning toward the center of the frame and 
the entire building seems to be falling away from you, as shown in the left 
image in Figure 10-17. (If the lens is tilting down, verticals instead appear to 
lean outward, and the building appears to be falling toward you. Through the 
Retouch menu’s Perspective Control feature, you can right those leaning ver-
ticals, as shown in the “after” photo on the right in Figure 10-17.
 
Doug Sahlin
 
 Figure 10-17: The original photo exhibited convergence (left); applying the Perspective Control 
filter corrected the problem (right).

296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Note, though, that just like the Straighten tool, described earlier in this 
chapter, you lose some area around the perimeter of your photo as part of 
the correction process. So when you’re shooting this type of subject, frame 
loosely — that way, you ensure that you don’t sacrifice an important part of 
the scene due to the correction.
To try out the feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK to bring the 
Retouch menu to life.
 
2. Highlight Perspective Control, as shown in the left in Figure 10-18, 
and press OK.
 
 After enabling this filter, you see a grid and a horizontal and vertical 
scale, as shown on the right in Figure 10-18.
 
3. Press the Multi Selector left and right to move the out-of-whack object 
horizontally.
 
4. Press the Multi Selector up and down to rotate the object toward or 
away from you.
 
5. Use the guides to get the perspective as close to normal as possible 
and then press OK to make a copy of the original image with your 
changes.
 
 
Figure 10-18: Press the Multi Selector to adjust the correction type and amount.
Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Cropping 
away excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by 

297
 Chapter 10: Ten (Or So) Fun and Practical Retouch Menu Features
the original bird of paradise flower picture, shown in Figure 10-19, and its 
cropped cousin, shown in Figure 10-20. When shooting this photo, Doug 
couldn’t get close enough to the flower to fill the frame with it, so he simply 
cropped it to achieve his desired composition.
With the Trim function on the Retouch menu, you can crop a photo right in 
the camera. Note a few things about this feature:
 
✓ You can crop your photo to five different aspect ratios: 3:2, which main-
tains the original proportions and matches that of a 4 x 6-inch print; 4:3, 
the proportions of a standard computer monitor or television (that is, 
not a wide-screen model); 5:4, which gives you the same proportions as 
an 8 x 10-inch print; 1:1, which results in a square photo; and 16:9, which 
is the same aspect ratio as images on a wide-screen movie. If your pur-
pose for cropping is to prepare your image for a frame size that doesn’t 
match any of these aspect ratios, crop in your photo software instead.
 
Doug Sahlin
 
Figure 10-19: The original contains too much extraneous background.

298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 
Figure 10-20: Cropping creates a better composition and eliminates background clutter.
 
✓ For each aspect ratio, you can choose from six crop sizes. The sizes are 
stated in pixel terms — for example, if you select the 3:2 aspect ratio, 
you can crop the photo to measurements of 3424 x 2280 pixels, 2560 x 
1704 pixels, 1920 x 1280 pixels, 1280 x 856 pixels, 960 x 640 pixels, and 
640 x 424 pixels. 
 
✓ After you apply the Trim function, you can’t apply any other fixes from 
the Retouch menu. So make cropping the last of your retouching steps.
Keeping those caveats in mind, trim your image as follows:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK to launch the 
Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Trim, as shown on the left in Figure 10-21, and press OK.
 
 Now you see a screen similar to the right side of the figure. The yellow 
highlight box indicates the current cropping frame. Anything outside the 
frame is set to be trimmed away.

3. Rotate the Command dial to change the crop aspect ratio.
 
 The selected aspect ratio appears in the upper-right corner of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 10-21.
 
4. Adjust the cropping frame size and placement as needed.
 
 The current crop size appears in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
(Refer to Figure 10-21.) You can adjust the size and placement of the 
cropping frame like so:
 
 
• Reduce the size of the cropping frame. Press and release the Zoom 
Out button. Each press of the button further reduces the crop size.
 
 
• Enlarge the cropping frame. Press the Zoom In button to expand the 
crop boundary and leave more of your image intact.
 
 
• Reposition the cropping frame. Press the Multi Selector up, down, 
right, and left to shift the frame position.
 
5. Press OK to create your cropped copy of the original image.

Ten Special-Purpose Features 
to Explore on a Rainy Day
In This Chapter
▶ Adding text comments to images
▶ Creating a custom menu and image-storage folder
▶ Changing the function of some controls
▶ Adding artistic touches 
▶ Combining two (or three) photos into one 
C
onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of one of those 
late-night infomercial offers — the part where the host 
exclaims, “But wait! There’s more!”
The ten features covered in these pages fit the category of 
“interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort of features that 
drive people to choose one camera over another, and 
they may come in handy only for certain users, on 
certain occasions. Still, they’re included at no extra 
charge with your camera purchase, so check ’em out 
when you have a few spare moments. Who knows; 
you may discover that one of these bonus features is 
actually a hidden gem that provides just the solution 
you need for one of your photography problems.
Annotate Your Images
Through the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu, you can 
add text comments to your picture files. Suppose, for example, that you’re 
traveling on vacation and visiting a different destination every day. You can 
annotate all the pictures you take on a particular outing with the name of 
the location or attraction. You can then view the comments either in Nikon 
ViewNX, which ships free with your camera, or Capture NX 2, which you 

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
must buy separately. The comments also appear in some other photo 
programs that enable you to view metadata.
Here’s how the Image Comment feature works:
 
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Image Comment, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-1.
 
 
Figure 11-1: You can tag pictures with text comments that you can view in Nikon ViewNX.
 
2. Press OK to display the right screen in the figure.
 
3. Highlight Input Comment and 
press the Multi Selector right.
 
 Now you see a keyboard-type 
screen like the one shown in 
Figure 11-2.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to high-
light the first letter of the text 
you want to add.
 
 Note that if you scroll the display, 
you can access lowercase letters 
in addition to the uppercase ones 
shown on the initial screen.
 
 
5. Press the Zoom In button to 
enter that letter into the display 
box at the bottom of the screen.
 
6. Keep highlighting letters and pressing the Zoom In button to continue 
entering your comment.
 
 Your comment can be up to 36 characters long. 
 
 To move the text cursor, rotate the Command dial in the direction you 
want to shift the cursor.

 To delete a letter, move the cursor under the offending letter and then 
press the Delete button.
 
7. To save the comment, press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Image Comment menu.
 
8. Highlight Attach Comment and press the Multi Selector right to put a 
check mark in the box.
 
 The check mark turns the Image Comment feature on.
 
9. Highlight Done and press OK to wrap things up.
 
 You’re returned to the Setup menu. The Image Comment menu item 
should now be set to On.
 
The camera applies your comment to all pictures you take after turning on 
Image Comment. To disable the feature, revisit the Image Comment menu, 
highlight Attach Comment, and press the Multi Selector right to toggle the 
check mark off. Select Done and press OK to make your decision official.
To view comments in Nikon ViewNX, display the Metadata tab. (Click the 
tab on the left side of the program window.) Select an image by clicking its 
thumbnail. The Image Comment text appears in the File Info 2 section of the 
tab, as shown in Figure 11-3. (If the panel is closed, click the little triangle 
next to File Info 2.) See Chapter 8 for more details about using ViewNX.

Creating Your Own Menu
Keeping track of how to access all of the D5000’s options can be a challenge, 
especially when it comes to those that you adjust through menus. To make 
things a little easier, you can build a custom menu that holds up to 20 of the 
options you use most frequently. Check it out:
 
1. Display the Recent Settings/My Menu menu, as shown on the left in 
Figure 11-4.
 
 
Figure 11-4: You can create a custom menu to hold up to 20 of the settings you access most

5. Highlight a menu that contains an option you want to add to your 
custom menu and then press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a list of all available options on that menu, as shown on the left 
in Figure 11-6. (If you select the Custom Setting menu, you have to first 
select the submenu that contains the option you want to put on your 
menu.)
 
 
Figure 11-6: Highlight a menu item and press OK to add it to your custom menu.
 
 A few items can’t be added to a custom menu. A little box with a slash 
through it appears next to those items.
 
6. To add an item to your custom menu, highlight it and press OK.
 
 Now you see the Choose Position screen, as shown on the right side of 
FIgure 11-6, where you can change the order of your menu items. For 
now, just press OK to return to the My Menu screen; you can set up the 
order of your menu items later. (See the list following these steps.) The 
menu item you just added appears at the top of the My Menu screen.
 
7. Repeat Steps 4–6 to add more items to your menu.
 
 When you get to Step 5, a check mark appears next to any item that’s 
already on your menu.
After creating your custom menu, you can access it by pressing the Menu 
button and choosing the Recent Settings/My Menu screen. (If you want to 
switch to the Recent Settings menu, select Choose Tab to display the right 
screen shown in Figure 11-4 and then select Recent Settings.)

You can reorder the menu items and remove items as follows:
 
✓ Change the order of menu options. Display your custom menu and 
highlight Rank Items, as shown on the left in Figure 11-7. You then see a 
screen that lists all your menu items in their current order. Highlight a 
menu item, as shown on the right in the figure, press OK, and then use 
the Multi Selector to move it up or down the list. Press OK to lock in the 
new position of the menu item. When you’re happy with the order of 
the menu items, press the Multi Selector left to return to the My Menu 
screen.
 
✓ Remove menu items. Again, head for the My Menu screen. Select 
Remove Items and press the Multi Selector right. You see a list of all the 
current menu items, with an empty box next to each item. To remove 
an item, highlight it and press the Multi Selector right. A check mark 
then appears in that item’s box. After tagging all the items you want to 
remove, highlight Done and press OK. A confirmation screen appears; 
press OK to wrap things up.
 
 
Figure 11-7: Choose Rank Items to change the order of menu items.
Creating Custom Image Folders
By default, your camera initially stores all your images in one folder, which 
it names 100D5000. Folders have a storage limit of 999 images; when you 
exceed that number, the camera creates a new folder, assigning a name that 
indicates the folder number — 101D5000, 102D5000, and so on. You see the 
full name of the default folders when you view the memory card contents on 
your computer. While viewing pictures on the camera, you see only a single 
folder, named D5000, that holds all your pictures, even after you exceed 999 
photos and the camera creates a second folder for you.

307
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
If you choose, however, you can create your own, custom-named folders. 
For example, perhaps you sometimes use your camera for business and 
sometimes for personal use. To keep your images separate, you can set up 
one folder named DULL and one named FUN — or perhaps something less 
incriminating, such as WORK and HOME.
Whatever your folder-naming idea, you create custom folders like so:
 
1. Display the Shooting menu and highlight Active Folder, as shown on 
the left in Figure 11-8.
 
 
Figure 11-8: You can create custom folders to organize your images right on the camera.
 
2. Press OK to display the screen shown on the right in Figure 11-8.
 
3. Highlight New and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a keyboard-style screen similar to the one used to create image 
comments, as described at the start of the chapter. The folder-naming 
version appears on the left in Figure 11-9.
 
 
Figure 11-9: Folder names can contain up to five characters.

308

4. Enter a folder name up to five characters long.
 
 Use these techniques:
 
 
• To enter a letter, highlight it by using the Multi Selector. Then 
press the Zoom In button.
 
• To move the text cursor, rotate the Command dial in the direction 
you want to move the cursor.
 
 
• To delete a letter, place the cursor under it and press the Delete 
button.
 
5. After creating your folder name, press OK to complete the process and 
return to the Shooting menu.
 
 The folder you just created is automatically selected as the active folder, 
as shown on the right in Figure 11-9.
 
If you take advantage of this option, remember to specify where you want 
your pictures stored each time you shoot: Select Active Folder from the 
Shooting menu and press OK to display the screen shown on the left in Figure 
11-10. Highlight Select Folder and press the Multi Selector right to display a 
list of all your folders, as shown on the right. Highlight the folder that you 
want to use and press OK. Your choice also affects which images you can 
view in Playback mode; see Chapter 4 to find out how to select the folder you 
want to view.
 
 
Figure 11-10: Remember to specify where you want to store new images.
If necessary, you can rename a custom folder by using the Rename option on 
the Active Folder screen. (Refer to the left screen in Figure 11-10.) The Delete 
option on the same screen enables you to get rid of all empty folders on the 
memory card.

 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Customizing External Controls
When your camera ships from the Nikon factory, the buttons and Command 
dial are set up to work as described throughout this book. You can, how-
ever, assign different functions to two buttons, the AE-L/AF-L button and the 
Function button, as described in the next two sections. (Look in the section 
about the AE-L/AF-L button for information about making a related adjust-
ment to the shutter button; see Chapter 1 for a few additional customization 
options.) 
Assigning a duty to the Function button
Tucked away on the left-front side of the camera, just under the Flash button, 
the Function (Fn) button is set by default to activate Self-Timer Shooting for 
your next picture. But if you don’t use that function often, you may want to 
assign some other purpose to the button. 
You establish the button’s behavior via the Assign Fn Button option, found 
on the Controls submenu of the Custom Setting menu and shown on the left 
in Figure 11-11. After highlighting the option, press OK to display the screen 
shown on the right in the figure. Here’s a quick description of the possible 
settings. 
 
 
Figure 11-11: You can assign any number of jobs to the Function button.
 
✓ Self-Timer: The default option actives Self-Timer shooting with the cur-
rent specified time delay. The Self-Timer mode applies only to your next 
shot, however.
 
✓ Release Mode: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired Release mode.

310
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Image Quality/Size: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button 
while turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired image qual-
ity and size.
 
✓ ISO Sensitivity: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired ISO setting.
 
✓ White Balance: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired white balance 
setting in P, S, A, and M modes.
 
✓ Active-D Lighting: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you choose the desired Active-D Lighting 
setting. As with White Balance, this control is available only in the P, S, 
A, and M modes.
 
✓ + NEF (RAW): This setting relates to the Image Quality option, intro-
duced in Chapter 3. If you set that option to JPEG Basic, Fine, or Normal 
and then press the Fn button, the camera records two copies of the 
next picture you shoot: a JPEG version plus a second image in the NEF 
format. After the capture is complete, the Image Quality option is reset 
automatically to capture only the JPEG version.
 
✓ Auto Bracketing: If you select this option, pressing the Fn button while 
turning the Command dial lets you select a bracketing increment for AEB 
(automatic exposure bracketing) or white balance bracketing. For ADL 
(Active D-Lighting) bracketing, you can use the button and Command 
dial to turn bracketing on and off. Bracketing, explained at the end of 
Chapter 5, is possible only in the P, S, A, or M exposure modes.
After selecting the function you want to assign, press OK to lock in your 
choice.
Changing the function of the AE-L/AF-L button
Set just to the right of the viewfinder, the AE-L/AF-L button enables you to 
lock focus and exposure settings when you shoot in autoexposure and auto-
focus modes, as explored in Chapters 5 and 6. 
Normally, autofocus and autoexposure are locked when you press the 
button, and they remain locked as long as you keep your finger on the button. 
But you can change the button’s behavior. To access the available options, 
open the Custom Setting menu, navigate to the Controls submenu, press OK, 
and then highlight Assign AE-L/AF-L Button, as shown on the left in Figure 
11-12. Press OK to display the options shown on the right in the figure.

311
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
 
Figure 11-12: You can set the AE-L/AF-L button to lock autoexposure only if you prefer.
The options produce these results:
 
✓ AE/AF Lock: This is the default setting. Focus and exposure remain 
locked as long as you press the button.
 
✓ AE Lock Only: Autoexposure is locked as long as you press the button; 
autofocus isn’t affected. (You can still lock focus by pressing the shutter 
button halfway.)
 
✓ AF Lock Only: Focus remains locked as long as you press the button. 
Exposure isn’t affected.
 
✓ AE Lock (Hold): This one locks exposure only with a single press of the 
button. The exposure lock remains in force until you press the button 
again or the exposure meters turn off.
 
✓ AF-ON: Pressing the button activates the camera’s autofocus mecha-
nism. If you choose this option, you can’t lock autofocus by pressing the 
shutter button halfway.
After highlighting the option you want to use, press OK.
 
The information that I give in this book with regard to using autofocus and 
autoexposure assumes that you stick with the default setting. So if you change 
the button’s function, remember to amend my instructions accordingly.
On a related note, my instructions also assume that the Shutter Release 
Button AE-L option, found on the Timers/AE Lock submenu of the Custom 
Setting menu, is set to its default, which is Off. At that setting, pressing the 

312

shutter button halfway locks focus but not exposure. If you turn the feature 
on, your half-press of the shutter button locks both focus and exposure. 
Adding a Starburst Effect
Want to give your photo a little extra sparkle? Experiment with your D5000’s 
Cross Screen filter. This filter adds a starburst-like effect to the brightest 
areas of your image, as illustrated in Figure 11-13.
 
 
Figure 11-13: The Cross Screen filter adds a starburst effect.
Traditional photographers create this effect by placing a special filter over 
the camera lens; the filter is sometimes known as a Star filter instead of a 
Cross Screen filter. With your D5000, you can apply a digital version of the 
filter via the Retouch menu, as follows:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image playback mode and press OK to 
call up the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Filter Effects and press OK.

313
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
3. Highlight Cross Screen and press 
OK, as shown in Figure 11-14. 
 
 The preview shows you the 
results of the Cross Screen filter 
at the current filter settings, as 
shown in Figure 11-15.
 
4. Adjust the filter settings as 
needed.
 
 You can adjust the number of 
points on the star, the strength 
of the effect, the length of the 
star’s rays, and the angle of the 
effect. Just use the Multi Selector to highlight an option and then press 
the Multi Selector right to display the available settings. Highlight your 
choice and press OK. I labeled the four options in Figure 11-15.

Figure 11-15: You can play with four filter settings to tweak the effect.
 
 To update the preview, highlight Confirm and press OK. 
 
 
 You can also press and hold the Zoom In button to temporarily view 
your image in full-screen view. Release the button to return to the 
normal preview.
 
5. Highlight Save and press OK to create your star-crossed image.
Figure 11-14: Select a filter effect.

314
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Keep in mind that the number of starbursts the filter applies depends on 
your image. You can’t change that number; the camera automatically adds 
the twinkle effect wherever it finds very bright objects. If you want to control 
the exact placement of the starbursts, you may want to forgo the in-camera 
filter and find out whether your photo software offers a more flexible star-
filter effect. (You can also create the effect manually by painting the cross 
strokes onto the image in your photo editor.) 
Creating a Color Outline
If you’re like me, when you put a paintbrush to canvas, it’s like mixing oil with 
water. It ain’t pretty. But you can take one of your photo masterpieces and 
use it as the basis for a work of art by creating a color outline, as shown in 
Figure 11-16. Then you can grab your crayons, colored pencils, or whatever 
else may be lurking in your failed art-experiment drawer and draw between 
the lines. This is also a fun project to do with kids — you can, in essence, 
create a custom coloring-book page. 
 
 
Figure 11-16: You can turn a photo into the basis for a color outline.
Try it out:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image playback mode and press OK to 
display the Retouch menu over the image.
 
2. Highlight Color Outline as shown on the left of Figure 11-17 and 
press OK.
 
 A preview of your art masterpiece appears onscreen, as shown on the 
right of Figure 11-17.
 
3. Press OK.
 
 The camera software creates a copy of your image with the effect 
applied.

Using the Soft Filter
Some photographers spend a lot of money for soft-focus filters. You’ll be glad 
to know you can mimic the effect, without spending a dime, by using the Soft 
filter on the Retouch menu. This filter is well suited for portraits, but some 
people also use the filter to give a landscape a soft, dreamy look. Here’s how 
to apply the filter:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image playback mode and press OK to 
call up the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Filter Effects, press OK, and then highlight Soft as shown on 
the left side of Figure 11-18.
 
3. Press OK.
 
 The right side of Figure 11-18 shows the controls you use to apply the 
Soft filter.
 
 
Figure 11-18: You can create soft-focus effects to give your photo a dreamy look.

316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
4. Press the Multi Selector up or down or rotate the Command dial to 
determine how soft you want the image.
 
 Your choices are Low (kinda soft), Normal (soft with some details), and 
High (pass the rose-colored glasses). While you’re pondering your deci-
sion, you can press the Zoom In button to get a better look.
 
5. Press OK to apply the filter.
 
 Figure 11-19 shows the Bird of Paradise photo from Figure 11-16 after 
applying the Soften filter at the Normal setting.
 
Figure 11-19: This photo shows the result of using the Normal setting on the 
original from Figure 11-16.
Combining Two Photos with Image Overlay
Are you into double exposures? Well, you can’t officially do a double expo-
sure with the D5000, but the Image Overlay feature found on the Retouch 
menu enables you to merge two photographs into one. I used this option to 
combine a photo of a werewolf friend, shown on the top left in Figure 11-20, 
with a nighttime garden scene, shown on the top right. The result is the 
ghostly image shown beneath the two originals. Oooh, scary!

317
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
 
Figure 11-20: Image Overlay merges two RAW (NEF) photos into one.
On the surface, this option sounds kind of cool. The problem is that you 
can’t control the opacity or positioning of the individual images in the com-
bined photo. For example, you might assume that you could use this feature 
to create one of those old-fashioned “two views” portrait composites, with 
one area of the picture showing a frontal view of the subject and another 
showing a profile shot. But this really works well only if the background in 
both images is a solid color (black seems to be best) and you compose your 
photos so that the subjects don’t overlap in the combined photo. Otherwise, 
you get the ghostly portrait effect like what you see in my example.
 
Additionally, the Image Overlay feature works only with pictures that you 
shoot in the Camera RAW (NEF) format. For details on RAW, see Chapter 3. 
The resulting image is also created in the RAW format, which means that you 
have to use a RAW processor to convert it into an actual image file before 
you can print or share it. Chapter 8 has details on that issue.
To be honest, I don’t use Image Overlay for the purpose of serious photo 
compositing, however. I prefer to do this kind of work in my photo editing 
software, where I have more control over the blend. In addition, previewing 
the results of the overlay settings you use is difficult, given the size of the 
camera monitor.

318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
That said, it’s a fun project to try, so give it a go when you have a spare 
minute. Take these steps:
 
1. Display the Retouch menu, highlight Image Overlay, and press OK.
 
 You see the screen shown on the left in Figure 11-21, with the preview 
area for Image 1 highlighted. (The yellow border indicates the active 
preview area.)
 
 
Figure 11-21: Preview the overlay image by pressing the Zoom button.
 
2. Press OK to display thumbnails of your images.
 
3. Select the first of the two images that you want to combine.
 
 A yellow border surrounds the currently selected thumbnail. Press the 
Multi Selector right and left to scroll the display until the border appears 
around your chosen image. Then press OK.
 
 The Image Overlay screen now displays your first image as Image 1. 
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to select the second image.
 
 Now you see both images in the Image Overlay screen, with the com-
bined result appearing in the Preview area, as shown on the right in 
Figure 11-21.
 
5. Press the Multi Selector right to move the yellow selection box over 
the Preview thumbnail.
 
6. In the Preview thumbnail area, highlight Overlay and press OK to get 
a full-frame view of the merged image.
 
 
 If you aren’t happy with the result, press the Zoom Out button to exit 
the preview. Then adjust the gain setting underneath the image thumb-
nails to manipulate the combined image. Press the Multi Selector right 

319
 Chapter 11: Ten Special-Purpose Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
or left to highlight Image 1 or Image 2 and then press up or down to 
adjust the gain for that image. To see the results of your adjustment in 
full-frame view, just highlight Overlay and press OK again. Press the 
Zoom Out button to exit the full-frame preview.
 
7. To save the merged image, highlight Save (in the Preview thumbnail 
area) and press OK.
 
 Again, the combined image is created in the Camera RAW (NEF) format. 
Controlling Flash Output Manually
By default, your camera automatically adjusts the output of its built-in flash 
based on the ambient light so that you wind up with a proper exposure. But 
if you’re experienced in the way of the flash, you do have the option of manu-
ally setting the flash output when you shoot in the P, S, A, and M exposure 
modes. To do so, take these steps:
 
1. From the Custom Setting Menu, Highlight Bracketing/Flash and 
press OK.
 
 The Bracketing/Flash options are displayed.
 
2. Highlight Flash Cntrl for Built-In Flash (shown on the left in Figure 
11-22) and press OK.
 
 The menu shown on the right of Figure 11-22 appears.
 
 The TTL setting is the default flash setting, in which the camera sets the 
proper flash power for you. TTL stands for through the lens.
 
 
Figure 11-22: You can control the Flash output manually.

320
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Highlight Manual and press OK. 
 
 Now the menu shown in Figure 
11-23 appears. 
 
4. Highlight the desired flash 
output and press OK.
 
 Your options are from 1/32 power 
to Full power. The next time you 
use the built-in flash, it emits a 
burst of light at the power you 
specify.
Adjusting flash power this way is a 
little cumbersome and, again, requires 
some lighting expertise to use properly. 
So remember that you can also keep the flash in auto mode (TTL mode) 
and then use the Flash Compensation control to bump the flash power up 
or down a few notches from what the camera’s metering system thinks is 
appropriate. Of course, if you want to get really tricky, you can employ Flash 
Compensation even with manual flash control. See Chapter 5 for details on 
Flash Compensation.
Figure 11-23: Specify the amount of light you 
want the flash to emit.
