This book is designed to help you understand the basic 
principles of electronics. The combination of succinct, but

detailed explanations, review questions, and laboratory 
experiments work together to provide a consistent and logical 
account of the way in which basic electronics circuits are 
designed and how they work. The book arose out of a series 
of lectures that I attended as a student, and then later in life, as 
the lecturer. I am indebted to the late Robert Cheary, who 
presented this course for many years at the University of 
Technology, Sydney. I also express my appreciation to Walter 
Kalceff and Les Kirkup, my co-presenters, and Anthony 
Wong, who assisted me in the laboratory with many 
generations of enthusiastic students.

This second edition falls under the auspices of Taylor & 
Francis. I thank Tom Spicer and John Navas for their 
sponsorship of the first edition at the Institute of Physics 
Publishing, and to Francesca McGowan and the publication 
team at Taylor & Francis for their continued support and very 
professional approach to the whole publication process.
I hope that you will find this book a useful companion in your 
study of electronics.

switch.

Switch
In this simple electrical system, chemical energy is converted into 
electrical energy in the battery. The electrical energy travels along the 
wires to the light bulb where it is converted into heat and light. The switch 
is used to interrupt the flow of electrical energy to the light bulb. 
Although such an electrical system may seem commonplace to us now, it

was only invented about 100 years ago. For thousands of years before this, 
light and heat were obtained by burning oil or some other combustible fuel 
(e.g., wood). Although the concept of electric charge was known to the 
ancient Greeks, and electricity as we know it was well-studied in the 19th 
century, it remained a scientific curiosity for many years until it was put to 
use in an engineering sense. 
In the early part of the 20th century, electrical engineering was concerned 
with motors, generators and generally large scale electrical machines. In 
the second half of the 20th century, advances in the understanding of the 
electronic structure of matter led to the emergence of the new field of

electronics. Initially, electronic circuits were built around relatively large 
scale devices such as thermionic valves. Later, the functionality of valves 
was implemented using solid-state components through the use of 
semiconductors.

1.2 Electric Charge
Electrical (and magnetic) effects are a consequence of a property of 
matter called electric charge. Experiments show that there are two types 
of charge that we label positive and negative. Experiments also show that 
unlike charges attract and 
like charges repel.

to its excess or net charge. The

The force of attraction or repulsion can 
be calculated using Coulomb’s law:
1
In vector form, the direction of F is 
determined by the direction of the unit vector r and the 
sign of the charges. If the charges have the same sign, then the direction of 
F is the same as that of r. 
o = 8.85 1012
farads/metre (F m1)
• if F is negative, the charges attract. 
If the two charges are in some substance, e.g., air, then the Coulomb force
is reduced. Instead of using o, we must use for the 
substance. Often, the relative permittivity
r is specified.

1. Electricity
Electric current involves the net flow of 
electrical charge carriers which in a metallic
electrical charge carriers, which, in a metallic 
conductor, are negatively charged electrons. 
Often in circuit analysis, the physical nature of 
the actual flow of charge is not important -
whether it be the flow of free electrons in a wire 
or the movement of positive ions in a solution.
But,  in the 1830s, no one had heard of the electron. At that 
time, Faraday noticed that when current flowed through a 
wire connected to a chemical cell, one electrode, the anode, 
lost weight and the other electrode, the cathode, gained 
weight. Hence it was concluded that charge carriers, 
g
g
,
whatever they were, flowed through the wire from the anode 
to the cathode. The anode was therefore thought to be 
positively charged with electricity and these electric charges 
went from the anode to the cathode through the wire. 
We now know that the gain and loss of weight at each electrode is due to 
movement of both positive and negative ions in the solution of the cell 
rather than movement of charge carriers in the wire and in fact, 
negatively charged electrons flow from the anode to the cathode along 
the wire. The anode is charged with electricity all right, but the electric 
charges there are negative and flow towards the cathode. 
For historical reasons, all laws and rules for 
electric circuits are based on the direction 
that would be taken by positive charge 
carriers if they were present, and mobile, in 
the wire. Thus, in all circuit analysis, 
imagine that current flows due to the motion 
of positive charge carriers. Current then 
travels from positive to negative. This is 
called conventional current.

potential gradient. 
If the negative side of the circuit is

reference potential to be zero), then 
the electrical potential at the negative

1.8 Resistance

1. Electricity
A voltage source, utilising chemical or mechanical means, raises the 
electrical potential of mobile charge carriers (usually electrons) within it. 
There is a net build up of charge at the terminals of a voltage source. This 
net charge results in an electric field which is channelled through the 
conductor. Mobile electrons within the conductor thus experience an 
electric force and are accelerated.  
However, as soon as these electrons 
move through the conductor, they 
suffer collisions with other electrons 
and fixed atoms and lose velocity and 
thus some of their kinetic energy. 
Some of the fixed atoms 
correspondingly acquire internal
E
Heat
correspondingly acquire internal 
energy (vibrational motion) and the 
temperature of the conductor rises. 
After collision, electrons are 
accelerated once more and again 
suffer more collisions. 
Alternate accelerations and decelerations result in a net average velocity of 
the mobile electrons (called the drift velocity) which constitutes an electric 
current. Electrical potential energy is converted into heat within the 
conductor. The opposition to the free flow of electrons is called electrical 
resistance.
Note: negatively charged electrons 
move in the opposite direction to that 
of electric field E.

1. Electricity
In a circuit with an inductor, when the switch closes, a changing current 
results in a changing magnetic field around the coil. This changing
magnetic field induces a voltage (emf) in the loops (Faraday’s law) which 
tends to oppose the applied voltage (Lenz’s law). Because of the self-
induced opposing emf, the current in the circuit does not rise to its final 
value at the instant the circuit is closed, but grows at a rate which depends 
on the inductance (in henrys, L) and resistance (R) of the circuit. As the 
current increases, the rate of change of current decreases and the 
magnitude of the opposing voltage decreases. The current reaches a 
maximum value I when the opposing voltage drops to zero and all the 
voltage appears across the resistance R.

2. DC Circuits
With no load connected across the output, 
the output voltage Vout = VT.
This is the open-circuit voltage Voc = VT.
If we reduce RL from an infinitely high 
value, the current drawn from the 
power supply increases and the output 
voltage Vout decreases. Why? Because 
of the voltage drop across Rint.
As RL0, the current reaches a maximum

With RL = 0, it is evident that all of VT must

That is, VT can be measured by measuring

obtained from Voc and Isc, both of which 
may be measured.

Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are two different ways of representing a 
complicated circuit, either as a simple series or a simple parallel circuit. Which 
one do we use? It depends on the circuit being analysed. For transistor circuits, 
the Norton equivalent circuit is better and leads to a simpler analysis because 
transistors are mostly current controlling devices.

• at (1), conductor has begun to cut magnetic field 
lines B, hence some voltage is induced;
• at (2), conductor cuts magnetic field lines at a greater 
rate than (1) and thus a greater voltage is induced;
• at (3), conductor cuts magnetic field lines at 
maximum rate, thus maximum voltage is induced;
• from (3) to (6), the rate of cutting becomes less; 
• at (6), conductor moves parallel to B and v = 0;

The induced voltage is directly proportional to the

proportional to the velocity of the conductor in the

component Vy is parallel to the field lines and thus 
does not contribute to the rate of “cutting.”

When the switch is first closed, 
it takes time for the charge Q to

When the polarity is reversed, the capacitor initially discharges and then

while reverse charging takes place until the voltage across the capacitor

Now, if the switch were to be operated very quickly, then, upon charging, 
the current would not have time to drop to zero before the polarity of the 
supply voltage was reversed. Similarly, on reverse charging, the reverse 
current would not have time to reach zero before the polarity of the source 
was reversed. Thus, the current would only proceed a short distance along 
the curves as shown and a continuous alternating current would result. The

Let the inductor have no resistance. Thus, any voltage that appears across 
the terminals of the inductor must be due to the self-induced voltage in 
the coil by a changing current through it (self-inductance).

From Kirchhoff, vtotal = vR + vL + vC at any instant. Note that each of these 
voltages do not reach their peak values when vtotal reaches a maximum, 
thus |Vptotal| <> |VpR| + |VpL| + |VpC|. Also, since the rms value of any voltage 
= 0.707 Vp, then |Vrmstotal| <> |VrmsR| + |VrmsL| + |VrmsC|
Algebraic addition generally only applies to instantaneous quantities (can
Note: we can put vL on 
the right hand side of 
this equation as long 
as we remember that 
there is a change of 
sign of Ldi/dt.

Algebraic addition generally only applies to instantaneous quantities (can 
only be applied to other quantities, e.g., peak or rms, if current and 
voltage are in phase – such as resistor circuit).
Note also that the resultant of the addition of sine waves of the same frequency is 
another sine wave of the same frequency.

3.7 LCR circuit – Peak and rms Voltage
43
3. AC Circuits
In an LCR series circuit, how then may the total or resultant peak (or rms) 
values of voltage and current across the series components be determined 
from the individual peak (or rms) voltages across each component?
A VECTOR approach is needed (can use complex numbers).
Consider the axes below which indicate either peak (or rms) voltages VR, 
VC and VL.
VL
V
• vL precedes vR by /2, therefore 
peak or rms values of VL precede VR
by /2 and V is drawn upwards on
peak or rms
In a series circuit, the current is the same in each 
component. The instantaneous voltage across the 
resistor is always in phase with the instantaneous 
current. For the inductor and the capacitor:
VC
VR
VTotal
by /2 and VL is drawn upwards on 
the vertical axis.
• vC follows vR by /2, therefore peak 
or rms values of VC always follow 
VR by /2 and VC is downwards on 
the vertical axis.

Current is common 
point of reference in 
series circuit.
The resultant peak or rms voltage VT is the vector sum of VR + VL + VC
For an AC series circuit:
• same current flows in all components

• vector sum of rms or peak voltages must equal the applied rms 
or peak voltage VT = VR + VL + VC
• algebraic sum of instantaneous voltages equals the applied 
instantaneous voltage vtotal = vR + vL + vC

There are three classes of materials:

4.1 Semiconductors
1. Conductors
3. Semiconductors
2. Insulators
Valence electrons are weakly bound to the atomic lattice and are free to 
move about from atom to atom.
Valence electrons are tightly bound to the atomic lattice and are fixed in 
position.
In semiconductors, thermal vibration of atoms in a crystal causes 
electrons to break away and become free. The solid then becomes 
weakly “conducting”:
e.g., these two 
electrons shared 
equally between 
neighbouring atoms 
i.e., a covalent bond
Electrons which have broken 
away enter what is called the 
conduction band and have a 
higher energy than those left 
behind in the valence band.
The place left vacant by such an 
electron is called a hole.
Conductivity increases 
with increasing 
temperature.

A popular model of the atom describes the 
structure of atoms in terms of a series of 
electron energy levels (1s, 2s, 2p, etc). In a 
solid (as distinct from a single atom), the 
effects of neighbouring atoms give rise to 
the condition that each electron energy 
level splits into a number of closely spaced 
sub-levels. In a solid, there are many 
neighbouring atoms to any one atom and 
the total effect is for the sub-levels to 
become continuous and thus the energy 
level is more correctly called an energy 
band. In a metal, the valence band

overlaps with the conduction band. In an 
insulator, there is a considerable energy 
gap. In a semiconductor, some electrons 
escape from the valence band across a 
small energy gap into the conduction band.

The addition of certain impurities (doping) to the silicon lattice can 
increase conductivity.

Near the junction, free electrons from the n side diffuse across the

2. The resulting build-up of negative charge on the p side and positive 
charge on the n side establishes an increasing electric field Ed across the 
junction, leading to what is called the barrier potential Vb.
Vb = 0.7 V (Si) @ 25 C, decreasing with increasing 
temperature.
Thermal energy causes free electrons to have “random 
motion.” Excess of free electrons on the n side constitutes a 
“concentration gradient.” These two conditions permit a net 
transfer of free electrons from the n side to the p side by 
“diffusion” … and vice versa on the p side.

Accumulation of charge is reduced somewhat and diffusion then re-

of the contact, or junction, causes a concentration gradient which results 
in diffusion of electrons across the contact junction. 
Whether or not electrons diffuse from the metal to the semiconductor or 
from the semiconductor to the metal depends upon whether the 
semiconductor is p- or n-type and the nature of the metal. 
The “nature” of the metal and the contact is beyond the scope 
of our discussion. It is connected with the energy levels of the 
conduction electrons in each of the materials and how they 
compare with each other.
This movement of electrons across the contact gives rise to an electric

may only move if there is a downhill path or slope. If the slope is 
frictionless (i.e., an electric field), then electrons gain “kinetic” energy. If 
the slope has friction (i.e., resistor), then energy is converted to heat.
Diffusion acts like a “force” D to push electrons from the n side to 
the p side. As electrons accumulate on the p side, the slope becomes 
steeper and steeper until it is too difficult for the diffusion force 
(which remains constant) to transfer any more electrons from p to n.
The slope (barrier potential) arises due to 
p-n junction
the accumulation of charge on either side 
of the junction. Diffusion acts to transfer 
electrons up the slope. If the slope is too 
steep, then no electrons are transferred. 
Electrons cannot be transferred part-way 
up the slope; they are either transferred to 
the top or wait at the bottom.

If an electron-hole pair should appear on the slope

the slope slightly. Diffusion can then transfer one 
more electron to the p side whereupon the steepness

After being given an initial boost uphill by the voltage source V, electrons

to a very swift multiplication effect and a large current. This is called 
avalanche breakdown.
The reverse bias breakdown 
voltage is about 500 V for germanium 
and about 1 kV for silicon.
If the impurity doping density is high enough, then the depletion region is 
narrow enough (even in reverse bias) to allow the electric field across the 
region to be very high. The high accelerating field and narrow depletion 
region allow electrons to tunnel through. This is called zener breakdown. 
Zener diodes are designed to break down in reverse bias. They can 
withstand a relatively large reverse current without damage. The reverse 
bias voltage leading to zener breakdown is adjustable during manufacture 
of the device.

magnitude, but instead, an irregularly shaped signal. For the measurement 
of radiation, we simply require the rate at which pulses are produced and 
we are not concerned with the amplitude or shape of the pulse. A diode 
clipper can be used to produce a squared-up waveform which can then be 
fed into an audio amplifier or digital counter. The clipper ensures that the 
pulses fed to the counting circuit are uniform and that the counting circuit 
needs to only display the count rate.

the capacitor C charges up 
to Vp, the peak voltage. 
The potential of the right hand side of the capacitor with respect to the left 
hand side is +Vp. That is, when Vin is at Vp, the potential of the right hand 
side of the capacitor is 0 V. When the input Vin reaches 0 V, Vout = +Vp
since the capacitor remains charged – the diode does not allow the capacitor 
to discharge.
On the positive half cycle, the left hand side of the capacitor is brought to a

We have seen how a clipper may be used to square up irregularly shaped 
pulses, now we shall see how to convert the train of pulses into a “rate” (i.e., 
an output voltage which is proportional to the number of pulses per second).
The diode pump is how a tachometer works. Pulses from the ignition 
system are received and converted into a steady DC voltage whose 
magnitude thus depends on engine rpm. The DC voltage then drives a 
moving coil meter which is calibrated to read rpm.

constant). Thus, a single pulse fully charges C1. The right hand side of C1 is 
negative w.r.t. the left hand side. When the left hand side returns to 0 V, the 
right hand side of C1 is negative w.r.t. the top side of C2. The negative charge 
is now distributed between C1 and C2 since D2 is now conducting. Most of 
the charge on C1 is transferred to C2 (capacitors in parallel – voltage across 
each is the same, charge on each depends on C and here, C2>>C1). 
Now, if another pulse Vp arrives at the input, D1 turns on as C1 charges up 
and D2 turns off. This leaves most of the original -ve charge on the “top” 
plate of C2. C1 accepts more charge from the input pulse and this is again 
transferred to C2 on the next fall to 0 V at the input. The current through the 
meter depends upon the amount of accumulated charge on C
The faster the
meter depends upon the amount of accumulated charge on C2. The faster the 
rate of input pulse, the greater the accumulation of charge on C2. In order to 
indicate pulse rate, it is important that the peak voltage of the input pulses are 
all the same. The shape or width of them then does not matter.

current which is a measure of the intensity of incident radiation.

Diffusion of electrons and holes

A PIN photodiode is a p-n junction with a narrow region of intrinsic semiconductor

important for digital signal transmission via optical cable.

In a laser diode, photons arising from spontaneous emission are reflected 
back and forth between the polished faces of the device. These photons are 
absorbed within the crystal, releasing an electron into the conduction band. 
However, simultaneously with this absorption, electrons in the conduction 
band also fall back into the valence band and a photon of the same 
frequency is emitted. This is stimulated emission. 
Absorption and stimulated emission occur simultaneously and with equal 
probability. However, in a laser diode, the geometry of the mirrored faces 
and the doping of the crystal ensure that when the current through the device 
is sufficient, there are more electrons in the conduction band than in the 
,
valence band (population inversion) and the stimulated emission of 
photons has a greater chance of occurring than absorption. The emitted 
photons all have the same phase and frequency and are emitted as laser light 
out through one of the partially mirrored sides of the device.

- Because the base is made lightly doped (so that recombination in the 
base is unlikely to occur) and is made very thin (so that electrons 
coming across the forward-biased b-e junction do not have far to go 
before they “overshoot” and fall into the field across the c-b junction).
- If the electrons coming across into the base were not attracted across
• Electrons coming from the heavily doped emitter cross the junction but 
before they have a chance to combine with holes in the p-type base and 
travel to the Vb positive terminal, they get swept up by the strong field 
which exists around the collector base junction, which is reverse-biased.

Hence, all electrons which cross this

the base current were to be increased, 
(by increasing the magnitude of Vb), 
then there would be more electrons 
(per second) wanting to go towards +Vb
and hence more electrons (per second) being siphoned off towards the

If Vce were to be turned off, then one might expect that all these electrons

deliberately put there by us as an

Now, if Vb is held constant, but Ib were to increase due to the removal of the 
reverse bias field at the c-b junction, then there would be an increase in the 
voltage drop across Rb. But, since Vb is a constant, this must mean that there is 
a reduction in the voltage across the forward bias b-e junction. Now, if Vbe is 
decreased then due to the exponential nature of the IV characteristics of the
decreased, then due to the exponential nature of the IV characteristics of the 
p-n junction, there is a substantial reduction in Ib. But this reduction in Ib also 
reduces the voltage drop across Rb, hence tending to increase Vbe – negative 
feedback. The net result is a new equilibrium with Vbe reduced slightly and a 
less-than-expected Ib is observed.

The base current is controlled by a resistor Rb which is inserted between 
the voltage supply Vb and the base so that Ib may be adjusted by adjusting

of the transistor:
In this circuit, Vbe remains at somewhere 
near  0.7 V and increasing the voltage Vb
simply increases the voltage drop across 
Rb due to the increased current Ib. (A large 
change in Ib does not change Vbe all that 
much compared to the change in voltage 
across Rb.) Thus, with the resistor Rb in 
place, we may adjust Ib by adjusting Vb.

given base current Ib, a greater proportion of the electrons are “collected” by the 
collector and Ib reduces. However, a reduction in Ib leads to a reduction in the voltage 
across the base resistor and an increase in voltage across the b-e forward bias junction. 
This leads to an increase in Ib due to the feedback mechanism discussed previously.

If hfe increases (e.g., by changing the transistor for another one) then the 
transistor characteristic is changed and for a given Ib (fixed by Vb), Ic
increases and the relative position of the operating point (the Q point) on 
the load line changes.
In this circuit, the collector current  
Ic depends upon Ib, which in turn is 
controlled by the value of Vb.

This is not desirable since hfe varies due to manufacturing variables and may 
vary anywhere from 100 to 200. For reasons to be given later, we require 
the operating point to remain approximately in the middle of the load line 
even when hfe changes.

The disadvantages of the simple bias arrangement

- But a decrease in Ib results in a 
decrease in Ic. A new equilibrium

its former value with a reduced Ib

emitter that is common to both the 
input (the base) and the output (the 
collector). 
Note: if Vin is positive (an increase in voltage at Vb) then Vbe increases, 
which results in an increase in Ib and hence an increase in Ic. Thus, Vc
goes up and Vce goes down by Vce. That is, the output is out of phase

It will be later shown that (for other reasons) RT =R1||R2 is made >> hie so 
that the input resistance of the amplifier is dominated by the value of hie
(since hie||RT). It is desirable to have a high input resistance so hie should be 
made to be fairly large – by choosing the lowest possible value of Ic.
In a fully stabilised bias circuit, it is Ic which is controlled  or 
designed and Ib adjusts according to the value of hfe.
For a given Ib, there will be a constant Ic in the collector, or output side 
of the circuit. That is, the transistor acts as a constant current source across 
which is connected a resistor Rc. This is the same situation as a Norton 
constant current source and parallel resistor. Thus, the output “half” of the 
amplifier circuit can be drawn:

the value of RT; thus keeping Rin as a strong function of hie enables us to 
adjust hie to the desired Rin.
One of the most important features 
of the bias of an amplifier is to 
obtain a Q point which is at the 
centre of the load line (to allow 
maximum swing of the output Vout). 
This means that the selection of hie

line. Thus, we may draw a series of parallel lines, all with slope 1/Rc, to 
represent all the possible AC load lines of a circuit. 
Slope of DC load line
= 1/(Rc + Re)
The actual AC load line appropriate for a 
particular circuit depends on the choice of 
Vce (the DC bias conditions). The DC bias 
conditions are described by the DC load line:
Thus, the AC load line for a particular circuit is the 
one which passes through the Q point on the DC 
load line.

Increasing Re would reduce the y axis intercept of the DC load line and also

Thus, to allow maximum swing on the output, Re should be selected so as to

approximation (i.e., middle of DC load line).

“versatility” of the circuit, we need to have Rc be much less than any

Since the output (emitter) voltage is in phase with the input, the common 
collector circuit is often called an emitter follower. In this circuit, it is the 
collector that is common to the input and the output. 

As with a CE circuit, the Common Collector (CC) circuit can be replaced 
with a Norton equivalent circuit consisting of a constant current source and

In a field effect transistor, the input voltage controls the output current. 
The input current is extremely small, < 1 pA.
There are two main classes of FETs:
JFET

Semiconductor FET
“Field effect” is so-called 
because an electric field is 
used to control current. As 
we shall see, the transistor 
current only depends on 
the movement of one type 
of mobile charge carrier 
and is often termed a 
“unipolar” device.

When the gate is made negative (Vgs < 0) the p-n junction is in reverse bias 
and a depletion region develops. The p-type gate is heavily doped

compared to the n-type bar; thus, most of the depletion region exists within 
the bar. Because the drain is +ve w.r.t. the source, the depletion layer is 
wider at the top than at the bottom.
That is, the region of the 
p-n junction near the top 
of the bar near the drain 
is in greater reverse bias 
than the region at the 
bottom near the source.

effective current gain of the

The transition frequency marks the point 
where the transistor cannot be used as an 
amplifier. It depends upon the collector 
current since the input resistance hie is a 
function of the collector current. 
Thus, an increase in Ic results in a decrease in hie and since Cbe is in 
parallel with hie, there is an increase in the transition frequency. At 
higher collector currents the capacitance C

higher collector currents, the capacitance Cbe begins to rise and 
dominate any effect of decreasing hie, causing transition frequency to 
fall with increasing Ic.
Cbe rises due to a change in the 
apparent size of the base region 
as the depletion layer is shifted 
off-centre towards the emitter. 
This affects the time taken for 
charge carriers to pass through 
the base, which at high 
frequencies, is an effective 
capacitance.

In the common emitter  amplifier, Rc allows 
us to set the Q point to the middle of  the 
load line, and also limits the current drawn 
by the transistor to a safe level for that 
device. When there is no AC input signal 
present, the current through 
lower power transistors. 
Consider a common emitter amplifier. The output  impedance is the parallel 
combination of Rc and RL.  The DC bias current Ic is typically a couple of mA. 
That is, the available current swing at the output is typically 1 mA or so.

When there is an AC signal present, the current swings by Ic (peak-to-peak) 
and the power is transferred from the transistor to the output resistance 
(Rc||RL).  It is only the power dissipated within the load resistor RL that is 
important (since this is our “payload”). Thus, the net average output power  
in RL is:
designed to handle that level of power output PQ. 
The power supplied by the supply voltage is Vcc times the current draw 
through the bias divider resistors R1 and R2, plus the collector current IC. This 
DC power, PDC, can be calculated once the DC bias voltage Ic is determined 
peak-to-
peak
from the bias conditions.  
The ratio Pav/PDC is the overall efficiency of the amplifier, and for a common 
emitter amplifier, is usually only a few percent, with a theoretical maximum 
of about 25%.

In many applications, particularly in the first stages of amplification of a 
signal, low power circuits with high gain and good linearity are required. In

the circuits examined so far, the bias currents are in the mA regime and 
would be unsuitable for driving loads such as audio loudspeakers, where 
outputs of 100 W or more may be required. 
A common emitter amplifier, and all 
those that set the Q point in the middle

amplifiers.

The main disadvantage is that Class A 
amplifiers dissipate most of their power

Thus, a Class B circuit is a power amplifier, not a voltage amplifier. 

10.4 Class AB Amplifier
The crossover distortion of a Class B amplifier can be overcome by the 
biasing the two transistors into the on condition by a small amount so that

there is a period  during which both transistors are on near the crossover. 
+Vcc
In the circuit shown here, a small bias voltage Vbb is applied across the base 
of each transistor. This results in a bias current Ic in each transistor from 
+Vcc to Vcc, that is, there is a DC current flow in the collector-emitter 
circuit leg. 
For small variations in 
Vin, there is a region 
where both transistors 
respond to the signal. 
For large variations, one

turns off and the other

Thus, for small input

operates in Class A mode, 
while for larger signals, it 
operates as a Class B.

10.5 Class AB Diode Biasing
In practice, biasing for a Class AB amplifier is not provided by separate 
power supplies,  or even from a resistor network, but instead, via diodes from 
The Electronics Companion
160
There is an important reason why diodes 
are used to provide the bias voltage rather 
than just using a resistor voltage divider. 
The base-emitter junction in each of the 
transistors is in forward bias. Usually, Ib
is controlled by the bias resistors (since 
the voltage drop across them is large in 
comparison to V ) Large changes in I

diodes and thus applied to the base-emitter junction. This is usually sufficient 
to provide a small bias current. 
+Vcc
comparison to Vbe). Large changes in Ib
result in only small changes 
in Vbe due to the steepness 
of the diode characteristic curve. If the 
temperature of the transistor should 
increase, then Vbe (the knee voltage) 
would decrease. The voltage drop across 
the bias resistors, thus Rb increases, and 
so the current Ib increases, and hence Ic
would increase – thus raising the 
temperature of the junction more. A

In diode biasing, the forward junction 
of the diode is kept at or near the 
temperature of the transistor by 
placing it very close to it. As the 
temperature of the transistor rises, so 
does that of the diode, and the voltage 
across the p-n junction of the diode 
thus decreases – thus siphoning off

As the capacitor charges, the voltage

capacitor is fully charged, all of vin appears 
across it and none across the resistor. As 
the time constant becomes smaller than the 
period T of the input pulse, the capacitor 
has more time to charge and discharge 
fully before the pulse changes polarity.
For a low-pass filter, we want RC << T to pass through low frequencies, 
i.e., small time constant.

For a small time constant or a low

charges up quickly and so the output 
signal looks like the input signal.  At 
higher frequencies (or longer time 
constant), the capacitor may not have 
time to charge and discharge fully and 
so the output signal is distorted and of

Now, consider the effect of a capacitance on the output:
If the transistor is initially off, then Vout = Vcc and the capacitor will be

But this charging takes place through Rc, i.e., time constant = RcC, and the rate 
of rise of Vout is relatively long.   
When the transistor is turned on, the Vout drops low and the capacitor 
discharges through Vce to earth.

Vcc is thus not shorted to earth through npn

npn since pnp is off.
Zero or negative input voltage: 
• pnp transistor is turned on and Vcc appears across capacitor and also at 
Vout. But, charging time is very short since resistance Rc may be 
eliminated in this circuit. 
The same effect can be obtained with two npn transistors if the bases of 
each are driven separately and out of phase so that one switches on when 
the other switches off.
IC logic circuits usually employ this 
method since they are more easily

an “X” is inserted in the position to indicate 
“don’t care.” X’s may be grouped if desired if

12.7 Flip-Flops
Flip-flops can be used to represent binary numbers. An RS flip-flop is a 
digital circuit which is stable in one of two states set or reset. Such a 
183
12. Digital Electronics
circuit can be made using NAND gates. A truth or action table
summarises the action of flip-flop. The voltage of one of the outputs can be 
used to represent or store a binary digit since it can be either voltage high 
(logic 1) or low (logic 0) and will remain at that setting until signals on the 
input, which only last for a short time, set or reset the outputs.

S and R are normally held at 1 and the outputs remain constant in any one of 
two states. Either Q = 0; Q = 1, or Q = 1; Q = 0. An input sequence of 101 at 
S (with R = 1) ensures that Q = 1; Q = 0. An input sequence of 101 at R 
(with S = 1) ensures that Q = 0; Q = 1. In normal circuit design, the condition 
S = R = 0 should not be allowed since Q = Q = 1 is not very useful. For a 
flip-flop using NOR gates, the inputs S = R = 1 result in both outputs being 
at logic 0, again, not a useful condition for a circuit whose main feature is to 
have the outputs opposite to each other.
Clocked flip-flops are used in computers and are set on receipt of a 
timing or clock pulse. 
1,0,0/1,1
Data at terminal S gets 
transferred to Q on the clock 
pulse and remains at Q even 
if the signal at S disappears 
and the clock goes low. 
The data stays at Q because when the clock 
pulse goes low, the flip-flop circuits within 
the chip are at S = R = 1 (due to the NAND 
gates on the clock stage). Only when the

12.8 D-Latch
A latch is a device which holds the data that appears on its input terminals. 
A memory cell in the microcomputer system is a latch. Typically, signals 
The Electronics Companion
184
destined for storage in memory cells appear on the data bus momentarily 
and then disappear. The timing of the signals is regulated by the internal 
clock which runs at speeds typically in the MHz range. The decoding 
circuitry determines which buffer is to be activated. The activated buffer in 
turn connects the latch input terminals to the data bus. The signals on the 
data bus are transferred through buffers to the latch circuit, which stores the 
signals on its output terminals.
A latch circuit can be implemented 
using a series of RS flip-flops. In 
this figure, the 4 bit data at D3 to D0
is transferred to Q on the clock
Q3

4 bit latch 
An octal latch has 8 inputs and 8 
outputs. The data latch enable (DLE)

levels on the input pins to the 
corresponding output. The latch 
circuitry retains the signals on the

disappear and DLE goes low. It is 
important that DLE is set when data 
appears on the input. DLE is 
typically timed to go high when data 
appears on the data bus. The clock 
signals are used to synchronise this 
timing.

advantage of this arrangement is that the output responds to the state of the

When the clock is high, the inputs J and K control the outputs of the master 
according to the action table for a regular RS flip-flop. The output of the 
slave is not affected since its clock is low (via the inverter). When the 
clock pulse goes low, the outputs on the master are isolated from any 
changes in the input, and the slave flip-flop is now activated and the

output terminals have

switch to the opposite

period before returning 
to the stable state.
Bistable: the output 
terminals have two 
stable states, and can 
be triggered from one 
to the other.
When the trigger level falls momentarily, Q goes high, which sends Q low. 
The voltage level at b drops to zero and rises back to Vcc as the capacitor 
charges  according to a time constant which depends on the value of R and C. 
since this level is NANDed with Vcc through R. With Q low, the output Q is 
high due to the inverting action of the first NAND gate. Since both sides of 
the capacitor are high, then there is no charge build-up on the plates and the 
circuit is stable in this condition.
When the capacitor charges up fully, voltage at b reaches Vcc and, since the 
trigger has already returned high, the output Q goes high and the circuit 
resumes its stable condition.
This is a single-shot monostable multivibrator. Variations on this circuitry 
allow the circuit to ignore any further triggers until the output goes back 
high (non-retriggerable).

Monostable operation
A popular choice for timing applications is the 555 timer IC.
12.12 555 Timer
The Electronics Companion
188
Monostable operation
The 555 contains two comparators whose reference voltages are set at 2/3 
and 1/3 Vcc by internal resistors. The trigger terminal is usually kept high 
by an external circuit. When the trigger falls to 1/3 Vcc, Comparator #1 sets 
the flip-flop and the output Q goes low. The output of the IC goes high via 
the inverter. When Q goes low, the transistor is turned off and the capacitor 
begins to charge. When the voltage at the capacitor reaches 2/3 Vcc, 
Comparator #2 toggles the flip-flop and the transistor is turned on by Q, 
thus discharging the capacitor to earth. Thus, a low-going pulse on the 
trigger causes a high pulse on the output which stays high according to the 
values of R1 and C in the external circuit.

12. Digital Electronics
The 555 timer IC can be wired for astable operation. It is most often used 
as an astable timer.
An astable device has no stable state. Its outputs oscillate between set and reset 
conditions at a fixed frequency. External components (e.g., resistor and capacitor) 
are usually used to set the frequency of oscillation.
The 555 contains two comparators whose reference voltages are set at 2/3 
and 1/3 Vcc by internal resistors. The capacitor C charges through R1 and 
R2. When the voltage at threshold Vc reaches 2/3 Vcc the flip-flop is set by 
Comparator #1. In this flip-flop, Q goes high which turns on the transistor 
and discharges the capacitor through R2. When the voltage at the threshold 
Vc falls to 1/3 Vcc, Comparator #2 resets the flip-flop and the transistor is 
turned off and the capacitor begins to charge again.

current flows through Re, thus causing Vre to increase.
2. Increasing Vre means a decrease in Vbe of Q2 and this leads to a 
decrease in Ib2 and hence a decrease in Ic2. 
3. A decrease in Ic2 means an increase in Vout (w.r.t. earth) since there is 
less voltage drop across Rc. 
V1 is a non-inverting input. An increase in V1 results in an 
increase in Vout.
4. When V2 increases, Ic2 increases and hence there is a decrease in Vce
and a larger voltage drop across Rc. Thus, there is a decrease in Vout

V2 is an inverting input. An increase in V2 results in a

resistors Rb.

The current I1 flows through R1 and, since Iis negligible, I1 must then go

Since the potential at ve input is at Vin, then current I flows from ve to

Ac is the closed-loop gain non-

only on external resistors.
In this case, the input signal is applied directly to the +ve input on the op-amp 
and hence sees the high Rin associated with the circuitry of the op-amp itself. 
The output impedance is dominated by the relatively low output resistance of 
the op-amp but can be reduced by the presence of R2 in the circuit.
Note: if the currents I+ and Iare “negligible” and the voltage at both 
inputs is the same (0 V for inverting, Vin for non-inverting) then you might 
wonder how does the whole thing work? The amplifier works because 
there is (i) an infinite open-loop gain and (ii) feedback of the output back

With both inputs at zero, Vout does not usually equal zero due to Vbe of each

Offset null allows adjustment to Vd to

The first stage of an op-amp is a differential amplifier. The input transistors 
require input bias currents Iand I+. Thus a path to ground is required 
(cannot have any of the inputs “open” or floating). 
This circuit would 
not work because 
there is no path

Due to differences in transistors, Iand I+ are usually not the same. The

Consider an inverting amplifier. If both inputs are grounded, then let us 
assume that any output Vout arises solely from Ioff (so that we can see what

Note: in these types of

can this be? Because of 
the presence of Vcc

Consider the resistance to earth as seen by both inputs. For the –ve input, it 
is evident that R1 and R2, under these circumstances, are effectively in 
parallel but there is no corresponding resistance to earth for the +ve input. 
This would lead to an input voltage differential as the input bias currents 
would be drawn through different resistances. To avoid this, an additional 
balancing resistor Rx has to be inserted at the +ve input: 
I2
0 V
R2
With both inputs at 
earth, we should have 
no voltage at the 
output (Vout = 0).
Rx has no effect 
on the closed-
loop gain.
Now, if there is a voltage 
measured at the output 
when both inputs are 
grounded, then this 
voltage arises due to 
some offset voltage Vd

circuit voltage gain Ao.

This circuit makes use of the very high 
open-loop gain of an op-amp to make a 
buffer which has a very high input 
impedance. Such a buffer may be 
connected at the inputs to an inverting or 
non-inverting amplifier to present a high 
resistance to the signal source.

Output is the weighted sum of the input voltages. If R1 = R2 = R3 = R4 = Rf,
then the circuit simply sums the voltages on the inputs. If R1 = R2 = R3 = R4 
= R, and Rf = 4R, then the circuit finds the average of the voltages on the 
inputs.

A comparator circuit switches the output on a change in relative polarity on

“noise.” That is, fluctuations in Vin may cause the output of a comparator to

Since the Vee terminal is grounded, then the output from the op-amp is 
always positive. Actual circuit operation, however, is not affected, with all 
inputs lifted up by +Vcc/2. The capacitor C1 in the feedback path means that 
for DC, the circuit is a voltage follower with a gain of 1.
The +ve input is held at Vcc/2 by a voltage divider. Since the DC gain of the 
amplifier is 1 then the output also sits at V /2 Coupling capacitors isolate
amplifier is 1, then the output also sits at Vcc/2. Coupling capacitors isolate 
these DC “bias” levels from the input and output devices.
Use of an op-amp as an audio amplifier allows a reasonably high gain with 
low distortion and good input and output impedance characteristics.

13.17 Active Filter (2nd-Order)
Ideally, a filter should have a sharp corner frequency and a steep roll-off 
so that only the desired frequency is passed. A first-order filter has a fairly

leisurely 20 db/decade roll-off, which may not be suitable for many 
applications. A second-order filter can be made by a tandem connection 
of two first-order filters, but while this has a steeper roll-off, at 40 
db/decade, the corner frequency is still too rounded. A better solution is an 
LCR resonant circuit:

Here, the Q point of the circuit determines the strength of the peak while

circuit can be replicated by an op-amp in the following configuration.

a changing current through it (self-inductance).

the flux in the core (Lenz’s law).
This opposing flux has the effect, from the primary 
side point of view, of decreasing the inductance (and 
hence decreasing the reactance L) seen by the voltage source. Hence, more 
current will flow in the primary. The increase in primary current i1' restores 
the peak flux back to its original value, thus keeping the rate of change of 
flux a constant and hence the induced back emf in the primary equal to the

A rectified output consists of a positive voltage, but 
varying from 0 V to the amplitude of the 
transformer secondary output voltage (neglecting 
the drop across the diodes). The average DC 
equivalent value of the output Vavg is the value that 
would be measured by a DC voltmeter. This is not 
the same as the rms value, which is measured by an 
AC voltmeter. The average value of a symmetric 
waveform is taken over half a cycle (since the 
average value over a full cycle would be zero). 
The most common method of providing a steady DC source is by the use of a

does not change.
VL = Vz and Is is thus 
fixed and independent 
of RL. If RL increases, 
the zener passes more 
current to keep VL = Vz. 
When RL is infinite

Maximum current in the zener diode occurs at open-circuit conditions where 
all the current passes through the diode. The maximum power dissipation

limiting resistor Rs:
If RL were to decrease, then less current would pass through the zener diode. 
Since there is a minimum current which must pass through the diode (5 
mA) to maintain operation well into the breakdown region, this limits the 
amount of current that can be drawn by the load resistor RL. If the maximum 
current through the zener is given by Imax, and approximately 5 mA is 
required for reverse breakdown, then the maximum current that can pass 
through the load resistor RL is approximately (Imax–5) mA. This might

increase in Ve leads to a decrease in 
Vbe since the voltage at the base is 
held constant by the zener diode. 
The decrease in Vbe results in an 
increase in Vce and decrease in Ve,

regulation and line regulation. 
Load regulation is the percentage change in the 
output voltage for a change in the load current 
from zero to full load. In a zener diode circuit, 
load regulation is affected by the presence of the 
finite slope of the breakdown region, which is 
called the dynamic resistance rs, which might be 
as much as a few ohms.

The device has three terminals. Current flows from the 
anode to the cathode when a pulse is put at the gate 
terminal. Conduction stops when the supply voltage to 
the anode is removed whereupon it must be re-triggered 
at the gate even if voltage is restored to the anode. 
This action acts as a rectifier when connected to an AC source. Gate pulses 
result in current flow until the supply AC falls below 0 V. The timing or 
phase of the pulses on the gate determines how much of the AC waveform 
is allowed to pass through the device. When the gate pulses coincide with 
the positive-going AC half cycle, we obtain a half-wave rectifier action. 
The disadvantage of the half-wave 
characteristics of the thyristor are

The field of electronics can find application in many areas – from  
communications to household goods. One of the most important applications 
16.1 Instrumentation
is that of scientific instrumentation.  That is, measuring a physical quantity 
using a transducer, and then displaying a meaningful output. 
The physical quantity may be such diverse things as temperature, 
pressure, velocity, time. Transducers convert the physical quantity into an 
electrical signal. The signal may then be processed by filtering and 
amplification and so become capable of being displayed or recorded. 
Recording to a computer will involve analog to digital conversion of the 
output signal.

Electronics also finds wide application in control of physical phenomena. 
For example, a user of a force testing machine might set the desired force by 
a computer command. This input is used to control the servo-motor (i.e., an 
actuator) that winds a lead screw and produces the desired force on the 
specimen. Control of equipment by electronics often requires digital to 
analog conversions. 
In many circumstances, the user-controlled output results in a change in a 
physical quantity which is then measured using a transducer. The measured 
output can be fed back to the control input, thus causing the system to be in 
closed-loop control. Many servo-motion systems work this way. 

A transducer responds to a physical phenomena and converts this into an 
electrical signal.

the first stage of amplification. For this reason, a preamplifier should be 
located as close to the transducer as possible. The preamplifier should be a 
differential amplifier with a good CMRR. All shields should be grounded 
at a common point so as to eliminate ground loops.

The ADC can be located either near the transducer, or, as is more common, 
on a special purpose interface card installed inside the computer. The 
interface card interfaces directly to memory either by direct memory access 
(DMA) or as a memory-mapped driver.

simplest case, it might be a sine wave:

have to be represented by a digital number. For example, for an 8-bit 
conversion from analog to digital, the magnitude of the full range of the 
original analog data would be between the binary numbers 00000000 and 
11111111 (or 0 and 255 in decimal). Numbers that don’t fit exactly within 
a “bin” are rounded up or down to the nearest one and then stored.

able to accept input voltages

output of the conversion, in digital form, has to be then captured and 
stored in computer memory for eventual further processing, display and 
disk storage if required.  
A computer has a very well organised architecture: comprising a central 
processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM) and an input/output system. These 
components are connected by parallel wires (on a printed circuit board) 
called a bus. 
Each memory location is capable 
of holding 8 bits, or 1 byte, of 
data and is physically constructed

using flip-flops.  Each memory 
location has a unique address. 
The maximum addressable 
memory depends upon the width 
of the address bus.  A bus is a 
parallel series of wires that carries 
digital signals. Early personal 
computers had a 16-bit address 
bus which gave 640 KB of 
addressable memory, or RAM.

The data bus is bi-directional and transfers data in both byte and word 
length to and from the CPU and memory.  Early computers had an 8-bit 
data bus. 
The control bus carries various synchronisation and control signals such 
as the read/write signal. During a read cycle, the processor receives data 
from either memory or a memory-mapped peripheral device. During a 
write cycle, the processor sends data to either a memory location or a 
memory-mapped device.
The physical process of transferring digital TTL voltage levels onto the 
various buses is quite complicated and very ingenious. Individual memory 
locations are isolated from the data bus by buffers. Decoding circuitry

that reads the address bus determines the actual buffer to be activated. The 
data is then passed through the buffer to a latch, or flip-flop. All this takes 
place in a sequence determined by the CPU clock, which typically runs at 
GHz speeds.

Polling
The CPU continually and sequentially interrogates each

access) is granted. If the device does not require servicing, then 
the CPU interrogates the next device. This is simple, but CPU

Each port has a unique address and is connected to the address bus and the 
data bus. From the CPU point of view, a port is very much like a memory 
location. Ports generally require servicing. That is, data to and from the 
port has to be collected or sent when appropriate. There are three main 
methods of accomplishing this:
intensive since the processor must spend a large amount of 
time interrogating devices which do not require servicing. 
Interrupts The device raises a flag which is recognised by the CPU to stop 
whatever is currently underway, and service the port. Interrupts 
are controlled by a dedicated programmable interrupt 
controller. The IRQ allocation is a hardware device interrupt 
number and is used to conveniently prioritise different devices. 
The lower the IRQ, the higher the priority.

Using a voltmeter, measure the voltage

piece of wire directly from one terminal 
to the other and measure the voltage 
between the terminals. Hopefully you 
will get about 1.5 V for the first 
measurement and 0 V for the second. 
What has happened to the 1.5 V in the 
second measurement? Since there is no 
voltage at the output terminals, then all 
the voltage must be dropped across the

short-circuit currents could lead to

the voltage must be dropped across the 
internal resistance of the cell. If you 
can, measure the current that flows in 
the wire when it is connected between 
the terminals. This is called the “short-
circuit” current. The voltage measured 
when there is no wire connected is 
called the “open-circuit” voltage.

and thus the magnitude of Io for a 
given Vo, depends on the value of the 
capacitor and the frequency of the 
applied voltage. At high frequencies, 
the polarity of the voltage applied to 
the capacitor changes before the 
capacitor has had a chance to charge 
up; thus the current Io is large. Thus, 
the reactance of a capacitor decreases 
with increasing frequency. Further,
the maximum voltage occurs when

thus Io leads Vo by +/2.
For an inductor, the magnitude 
of Io again depends on the 
frequency of Vo. For high frequencies, 
the magnitude of the induced back 
emf is large and this restricts the 
maximum current that can flow 
before the polarity of the voltage 
changes over. Thus, the reactance 
increases with increasing frequency.

The conversion of AC voltage to DC voltage is called rectification. Most

produce low voltage AC from the 240 V AC mains, but this then has to be 
rectified to obtain a steady DC output. Simple rectification can be had with 
just a single diode.

But, useful as they are, the diodes are only capable of passing a certain 
maximum amount of current before they overheat. Thus, we need to have a

5. When battery terminal voltage

high.
As a battery 
discharges,

Vab decreases, 
which may be 
represented by an 
increase in internal 
resistance Rint.

Throughout this process, and even when the battery is fully charged, Ic is 
still flowing so another circuit must switch off after a specified time period. 
However, having Ic a constant during charging ensures that the battery is 
charged at the maximum rate and to full capacity. Some NiCad battery

charged at the maximum rate and to full capacity. Some NiCad battery 
chargers do not use a constant current source but supply a “trickle” charge. 
Trickle chargers can be left on for days without harm to the cells, but the 
cells would take 2 or 3 days to reach full charge from a completely 
discharged condition.

Vcc and the collector. Do not connect the ammeter between the emitter

circuit due to the inclusion of the resistor at the emitter together with the 
zener diode at the base. These two conditions impose a “feedback” effect 
on the circuit, the effect of which may be demonstrated by removing Rc
from the circuit (or making it a very high value) and measuring either the 
base or the emitter current. Measure the emitter current at a high value of 
Rc (or simply remove it from the circuit and leave the collector at open 
circuit).
Your observation:
8. In the light of the above observation, it is evident that the base current 
does play an important role at very low values of Ic. With this in mind, 
examine the circuit again, and this time, develop a more accurate 
expression for the load line which includes the base current in the 
expression.

this circuit when the transistor is saturated?

Now insert the transistor into the amplifier circuit and determine whether 
there is any effect on the voltage gain of the circuit when the transistor is 
heated (use fingers again). Explain what you observe.

In previous experiments, you found that the voltage gain of a common

At this point, RL = Rout.
In this experiment, you will compare the input and output resistance and

this experiment, we see how a flip-flop can be used as a binary counter.
The most popular flip-flop configuration is the J-

Action table:
The asynchronous inputs S and R are used to set (Q = 1) or reset (Q = 0) the 
outputs and they override the action table for the J-K inputs. Note, R and S 
are active low and are thus normally kept high during normal operation. 
Setting S to 0 sets the Q output (keeping R high) and setting R to 0 with S 
high resets the flip-flop irrespective of the signals on J and K.

Why is an integrator useful? Many physical measurements involve the 
integration of a quantity with respect to time. An integrating circuit gives an 
17.19 Integrator

output whose amplitude is the integration of the input voltage w.r.t. time. 
The circuit does this integration instantly and does not care how complicated 
the input signal is. Many electrical measurements involve the integrated 
output and such circuits are very common in scientific instrumentation.

2. Construct the circuit but connect both inputs to earth (0 V). Connect a 
voltmeter to the output and determine whether or not the output changes 
with time (drift). Measure the drift  (Vout per second).
If there is drift, then connect a

capacitor. If the output of the 
circuit is “stuck” on +15 or -15, 
then discharge the capacitor

3. Disconnect inputs from 0 V and then connect to square wave oscillator. 
Make sure that the peak-to-peak input voltage is exactly 1 V and tune the 
circuit to obtain exactly a 2 V peak-to-peak output signal. 
4. Test the circuit at increasing frequencies and record and comment on

Resistors are also manufactured to a maximum power dissipation rating. 
However, the power rating is usually not specified on the resistor itself, but 
a good estimate may be made from the physical size of the component. 
Most resistors in electronic circuits have a 0.25 to 1 W power rating.
