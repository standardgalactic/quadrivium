Introduction
I have run a number of workshops on teaching with emotional intelligence
in which I have begun by asking participants to think of an occasion when
they were a learner which aroused in them strong feelings. After everyone
has had the chance to think of their response and to briefly recount their
experience to a partner, I ask individuals to state the word or phrase that
captures the strong feeling they are recalling. These are examples of the 
words they used in their responses: anger, resentment, joy, relief, frustration,
embarrassment, inadequate.
Participants in these workshops include teachers from higher education,
further education, schools and training organizations, who have been
relatively successful in their experience of formal education. I gather these
responses at the workshops for the same reason that I repeat them now. It is
to set the scene, by acknowledging what we all know intuitively from our
own experience: that emotions are bound up with learning. In Guy Claxton’s
words: ‘Learning itself is an intrinsically emotional business’ (Claxton 1999:
15). The process of learning in any context can involve struggle, frustration,
thrill or excitement. In the public and formal context of the classroom, with
all of the dynamics between teacher and learner and between learners, 
and with the perception that there is the prospect of success or failure, the
potential for strong feelings is heightened. It follows that if the job of a teacher
is to help their learners to learn, a teacher needs to be able to recognize the
emotional dimension of learning and to work with it. Teachers need to use
their emotional intelligence.
Currently, however, many teachers are unlikely even to recognize the role
that emotional intelligence plays in their work. This has been made very
apparent to me in the course of carrying out teaching observations in a range
of contexts in post-16 learning. I have frequently seen teachers who were
very competent in their teaching skills but who simply did not pay attention
to the emotional dimension of the learning–teaching exchange. For example,
they might not address any student by name, even though the group was
small enough for them to know the name of each learner. Or they never
explicitly acknowledged the look of boredom or confusion on the faces of

some group members. Opportunities were lost for promoting a positive
emotional environment and for responding to the feelings of learners; in other
words, for using emotional intelligence to enhance the experience both for
the teacher and for their learners.
Conventionally, a teacher brings two things to the classroom that are of
value to the learners. One is expertise in the subject, whether it is basic
mathematics, leadership in business or the novels of Thomas Hardy. The
other is knowledge of learning and teaching methods – a teacher’s pedagogy,
such as how to structure the content being presented, how to encourage
participation by learners, use of materials and so on. I suggest emotional
intelligence is the unrecognized third component of what a teacher has to offer
to learners. I believe, as teachers, we should develop and employ emotional
intelligence to complement the subject expertise and pedagogical skills that
we already offer to learners. When you are with a group of learners, you have
the chance to connect with them beyond the transmission and discussion of
ideas and facts, and thereby to transform the experience both for you and
for them. If you do not use emotional intelligence in your teaching, then the
value of both your knowledge of your subject and your learning and teaching
methods can be seriously diminished. This is represented in the diagram
below.
2 Introduction
subject expertise
learning and
teaching methods
emotional intelligence

A possible explanation for the continued neglect of this vital component
of teaching lies in the enduring inﬂuence of the writings of René Descartes.
In the seventeenth century, Descartes wrote, ‘I think therefore I am’. He stated
that each of us has a ‘mental’ realm within us which is uncontaminated by
the sensual nature of the body. This separate realm of the mind was seen as
‘higher’ than the faculties of the body, which was closer to animal nature.
This model continues to inﬂuence much of education today, as the intellect
is seen as the location of rational thought and, therefore, more trustworthy
than the emotions. As Anne Brockbank and Ian McGill note, ‘[Descartes’]
dualism . . . has survived in almost all aspects of learning and development,
as can be seen in the preoccupation with “thinking skills” to the exclusion
of material factors like affect (emotion) and action’ (Brockbank and McGill
1998: 21). If learning is seen as purely a cognitive process, it is legitimate for
the teacher to conﬁne their energies to asking the right questions, providing
information and ideas, demonstrating skills, orchestrating learner discussion
and so on. In his book Descartes’ Error, Antonio Damasio has shown that,
from a neuroscientist’s perspective, Descartes was wrong. He demonstrates
the central role of emotions in decision making and asserts that ‘certain aspects
of the process of emotion and feelings are indispensable for rationality’
(Damasio 1996: xv). It is time to recognize the central role that emotions
play in learning and to ensure that using emotional intelligence is part of
every teacher’s development.
The current lack of recognition of the importance of emotional intelligence
for teachers is reﬂected in teacher training courses at all levels. There is no
part of the curriculum in which the trainee teacher is asked, ‘Who are you
and how do you relate to other people?’ Lecturers in further education in 
the UK have to achieve a qualiﬁcation based on the standards of the Further
Education National Training Organization (FENTO). Their counterparts
working in higher education (HE) increasingly are expected to gain a
qualification approved by the Higher Education Academy, formerly the
Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education. Neither the FENTO
standards nor the guidelines for approving teacher training courses in HE
recognize emotional intelligence, by any name, as a component of the
qualiﬁed teacher. Teachers can complete their training and commence their
careers with this vital aspect unacknowledged and undeveloped.
Yet using emotional intelligence has the potential to affect for the better
many aspects of your work as a teacher. For example, many problems with
‘discipline’ can be attributed to how teachers handle (or ignore) learners’
feelings (see Chapter 9); learners may be less likely to drop out from courses
if they have better relationships with teachers (see Chapter 6); and for
effective reﬂective learning to occur, the use of emotional intelligence is a
prerequisite (see Chapter 15). Above all, the teacher who pays attention to
the emotional dimension of the classroom experience is more likely to develop
a state in their learners which is conducive to learning (see Chapter 3), with
Introduction

an increased likelihood of learners being engaged, motivated, ready to take
risks in their learning, positive in their approach to learning, ready to
collaborate, creative and resilient.
Of course, when you look more closely at what is meant by the use of
emotional intelligence in teaching you may say, ‘I do this anyway – this is
just a name I can put to it’. For many, the concept of emotional intelligence
embodies a description of how they live their life, including their teaching,
and they will be doing this as a matter of course. They will see that all people,
including those in the role of learner, have feelings and that those feelings
deserve to be acknowledged, valued, respected and handled with care. If you
are one of those who already teach with emotional intelligence, I would say
that there is still more to do:
•
First, we can rescue emotional intelligence from being an extra quality
that a minority of teachers offer to learners. Instead, it deserves to be
recognized as an essential component of what all teachers should offer.
•
Second, rather than let the use of emotional intelligence be just intuitive,
we should be more deliberate in using it, for example, in planning (see
Chapters 3–5).
•
Third, we should give the use of emotional intelligence as much attention
as we give to content and methods; we should give it a greater share of
our energy.
This book is intended as a practical guide for teachers who wish to make
more use of emotional intelligence in their teaching. Throughout, the
emphasis is on helping you as a teacher to relate the detail of emotional
intelligence to the context in which you work, and to assist you in developing
your own emotional intelligence and your use of it with your learners.
With the exception of Chapter 1, which provides an introduction to what
it means to use emotional intelligence in your teaching, each chapter takes 
a different aspect of teaching with emotional intelligence and is in three 
parts:
1
What does it mean and why does it matter?
Explores that chapter’s particular aspect of teaching with emotional
intelligence, what it means for your practice and what effect its use can
have.
2
Investigating your practice
Provides an opportunity for you to review your current use of this aspect
of teaching with emotional intelligence.
3
Developing your practice
Provides suggestions on how you could introduce or further develop this
aspect in your teaching.
4 Introduction

The Investigating your practice and Developing your practice sections of each
chapter consist primarily of a number of ‘activities’. The aims of these
activities vary. They may be: for developing your skills in the use of, and/or
your understanding of, teaching with emotional intelligence; for reviewing
your practice; inviting you to make speculative plans for a session; offering
suggestions for you to use in a session or for developing your self-awareness.
It is possible to do all of the activities in this book by working alone.
However, you would derive greater beneﬁt from exploring them with one or
more colleagues. The majority of them may be adapted as activities on
courses and indeed have been used in this way.
The book is intended to be of use to both new and experienced teachers.
The activities and examples assume that you are working with learners aged
16 or over, although the principles behind the use of emotional intelligence
can apply to teachers of all ages of learner. I have used the term ‘teacher’
throughout for the role that you may know as lecturer, tutor, teacher, trainer
or facilitator. Equally, for the people whom you are teaching, whether you
call them students, participants, delegates or even pupils, I am using the term
‘learners’. The space in which you meet I am calling a ‘classroom’ and the
time you spend with them, a ‘session’.
Chapter 1 explores further what is meant by the term ‘emotional intel-
ligence’ and how it relates to teaching; Chapters 2–5 are about planning for
the use of emotional intelligence in your teaching; Chapters 6–9 are about
using emotional intelligence in your exchanges with learners in the classroom;
Chapters 10–14 focus on developing your self-awareness as a teacher and
Chapter 15 looks at how you can continue your development in this area.

Using emotional intelligence
in your teaching
This chapter includes the following activities:
1.1
The qualities of an emotionally intelligent teacher
1.2
Providing evidence of the use of emotional intelligence
1.3
Being present
Emotional intelligence means to be able to acknowledge and handle emotions
in yourself and in others. The term was popularized by the success of Daniel
Goleman’s book Emotional Intelligence: Why it can matter more than IQ,
which appeared in 1995 (1996 in the UK). Goleman defined emotional
intelligence or ‘EQ’ as ‘the capacity for recognizing our own feelings and
those of others, for motivating ourselves, and for managing emotions well
in ourselves and in our relationships’ (Goleman 1998: 317). The term
‘emotional intelligence’ was coined in 1990 by Jack Mayer and Peter Salovey.
By 1997, they stated that emotional intelligence involves:
•
the ability to perceive accurately, appraise and express emotion;
•
the ability to access and/or generate feelings when they facilitate thought;
•
the ability to understand emotions and emotional knowledge;
•
the ability to regulate emotions to promote emotional and intellectual
growth.
(Salovey and Meyer 1997: 10)
Goleman subsequently identified five ‘social and emotional competencies’
which make up emotional intelligence (Goleman 1998: 318). These are:
Self-awareness
Being alert to your feelings
Self-regulation
Managing your feelings
Motivation
Using feelings to help achieve your goals
Empathy
Tuning into how others feel
Social skills
Handling feelings well in interactions with others
Chapter 1

‘Emotional literacy’ is a related term and indeed was reported to be a
working title for Goleman’s book (Orme 2001: 23). This term was ﬁrst used
in the 1970s by clinical psychologist Claude Steiner. Steiner’s deﬁnition of
emotional literacy suggests that it covers very similar ground to emotional
intelligence. He describes it as ‘the ability to understand your emotions, the
ability to listen to others and empathize with their emotions, and the ability
to express emotions productively’ (Steiner and Perry 1997: 11).
Goleman’s book created a great deal of interest in the concept of ‘emotional
intelligence’. Businesses asked, ‘How can we develop emotional intelligence
at work so that the company can be more successful?’ and ‘How do we
measure emotional intelligence in prospective employees?’ Parents and
schoolteachers asked, ‘How can we develop emotional intelligence/emotional
literacy in our children to enable them to lead happier and more successful
lives?’ What I believe has been overlooked in the interest generated by
Goleman’s book is the vital role that the use of emotional intelligence can
play in teaching.
The emphasis in this book is on using your emotional intelligence as a
teacher to attend to the emotional dimension of learning. I suggest that as 
a teacher you should develop and use your emotional intelligence with two
goals in mind.
•
One is to be able to recognize and respond to the feelings of both yourself
and your learners in the classroom, in order to make you both more
effective in your respective roles.
•
The second is to encourage an emotional state in the learners on your
course that is conducive to learning. This can apply just as much to 
the two-hour workshop as to the course which lasts for a period of 
years.
This book is concerned with what it means in practice to work towards these
goals. Each of the many activities throughout the book is intended to help
you achieve one or both of them.
What is an emotionally intelligent teacher? How would you know one if
you saw one? The chapter titles in the rest of this book give you a sense of
what it means to teach with emotional intelligence. This includes: putting a
great deal of energy into creating a positive emotional climate; recognizing
and working with the feelings of yourself and of your learners; using 
listening skills with groups as well as with individuals; dealing with learners’
expectations; and having a developed self-awareness.
Research into desirable teacher attributes identifies characteristics of
emotional intelligence in teachers without necessarily giving them that name.
Joe Harkin reported on vocational education learners aged 17–19 and found
that:
8 Using emotional intelligence in your teaching

affective behaviours are the most important determinants of student
satisfaction with teachers. . . . (These behaviours include) recognizing
individuals, listening to students, showing respect, being friendly, sharing
a joke, making some self-disclosure.
(Harkin 1998: 339, 346)
Smith et al. (cited in Smith 1997: 45–6) asked what qualities should the ideal
teacher in higher education have, and found that interpersonal characteristics
such as ‘empathic’, ‘approachable’ and ‘relates to students as equals’ were
woven in with attributes relating to the lecturer’s skills and knowledge.
Barbara Harrell Carson gathered the responses of former students, who
graduated over a period of 26 years from Rollins College in Orlando, about
teachers who they perceived to be most effective. She found that ‘the single
quality the Rollins alumni most frequently associated with effective teachers
– more often than brilliance and love of subject and even more often than
enthusiasm in the classroom – was a special attitude toward and relationship
with students’ (Carson 1996: 14). The respondents ‘connected their trans-
formative experiences . . . with a complex and personal encounter linking
professor, student, and subject matter in an exchange as much affective as
cognitive’ (ibid.: 11).
Activities 1.1 and 1.2, which follow later in this chapter, invite you to
explore further the characteristics of emotionally intelligent teachers.
Teaching with emotional intelligence entails a shift in priorities. For
example, the emotionally intelligent teacher seeks to have conﬁdence not just
in their content and materials but also in their ﬂexibility and readiness to
respond; they put energy into getting materials and methods planned but also
into preparing to meet the learners; they see their self-development as
emphasizing not just subject expertise but also the development of their self-
knowledge.
Learners’ perceptions can alter too when the teacher uses emotional
intelligence. If learners perceive you as showing care and respect towards
them, they are likely to interpret some of your actions differently. For
example, they may perceive you as someone who ‘takes time to make sure
you have heard everything they have said’ rather than ‘does not always
understand our questions straightaway’.
In the workshops I run on teaching with emotional intelligence, I
occasionally receive the comment, ‘I agree that emotional intelligence is
important, but surely you are talking about a personal quality, which you
either do or do not possess. It cannot be learnt.’ I am convinced that it can
be learnt. Anyone with experience of teaching or learning on counselling
skills courses, for example, will know that some individuals have the capacity
to change both their interpersonal behaviours and how they view themselves
and others, that is, to develop their emotional intelligence.
Using emotional intelligence in your teaching
9

If you are seeking to develop your use of emotional intelligence as a teacher,
it is worth reﬂecting on just what it is that you are looking to change and how
that change will come about. A ﬁrst potential trap in developing emotional
intelligence is to think that it is simply about getting a cognitive grasp of the
concept. While that is useful, what will be of most use to your learners will
be your emotionally intelligent approach, not your ability to write a 3000-
word critique of the concept. Cognitive learning alone will not do.
Carl Rogers (1902–87) wrote about what would now be called emotional
intelligence in teachers, most notably in Freedom to Learn (1983). He said
that the teacher who exhibited the personal qualities of genuineness, empathy
and acceptance with learners would, by that fact alone, bring about change
in their learners. (There is more on this in Chapter 7.) However, he was wary
of focusing just on skills development in the teacher which did not change
them as a person. He wrote, ‘none of the methods mentioned in this chapter
will be effective unless the teacher’s genuine desire is to create a climate in
which there is freedom to learn’ (Rogers 1983: 157, emphasis in original).
He saw procedures and techniques as less important than attitudes. On the
other hand, I have seen teachers begin to experiment with changes in their
behaviour, which has led to changes in the way they view themselves and
others, including their learners. For example, if you experiment with being
a more effective listener through active listening skills (see Chapter 7), and
if you engage openly in a structured process of reﬂection on your experiences,
this can give you new information about yourself and your view of others
and pave the way for you to change that view. The question of how attitude
change and skills development relate to each other may be open to debate,
but both can be tackled in the process of developing emotional intelligence.
There is the opportunity to sample both forms of development through the
activities in this book.
Another important consideration when embarking on this kind of
development is to remember that it cannot be confined to your role as a
teacher. If, for example, you start to be more attentive to your learners, you
will ﬁnd that you will carry this changed behaviour into your other social
contexts.
The remainder of this chapter provides three activities for you, designed
to assist you in clarifying the concept of using emotional intelligence in your
teaching and in beginning to explore how far you already do so.
Activity 1.1
The qualities of an emotionally intelligent teacher
This activity invites you to categorize the different types of qualities that good teachers
have and to identify the particular qualities associated with teachers who use emotional
intelligence.

Activity 1.2
Providing evidence of the use of emotional
intelligence
This activity asks you to ﬁnd examples from your own experience, both as a learner
and as a teacher, of the use of emotional intelligence.
Look over at the attributes of a good teacher in column 3 in Activity 1.1 to help you
think of the most emotionally intelligent teacher you have ever encountered.
Using emotional intelligence in your teaching
11

Imagine that this teacher is applying for a post and you have been asked to supply a
reference. You know that the interviewers lay great store by the use of emotional
intelligence and, indeed, they require you to provide ﬁve explicit examples that testify
to the candidate’s use of emotional intelligence.
What ﬁve examples would you choose?
If you were asked to produce evidence of your own use of emotional intelligence, are
there ﬁve examples that you could cite?
Activity 1.3
Being present
Of course, you are physically present when you are there in a room with a group of
learners. But the question to ask is, ‘Am I wholly here?’ You may have done this session
many times before; it’s possible you have been with the group before; you may even
be very familiar with the room you are in, but remember, this time is different. 
Being present means being ‘in the moment’, alert to how things are going and to 
the responses and mood of the group. It also means that you are ready to respond
appropriately to the unexpected. Being present is a prerequisite for all of the
behaviours which display emotional intelligence. If you want real communication with
your learners, you have to be in the moment with them and not in any way thinking
that this is a repeat. This activity provides the chance to review the extent to which
you are present with your learners.

The more you are in agreement with these, the more present you are. To develop
your readiness to ‘be present’, just take one of your ‘never’, ‘rarely’ or ‘sometimes’
statements and consider how you might practice it more in a speciﬁc session that’s
coming up.

How you relate to your
learners
This chapter includes the following activities:
2.1
How do you relate to your learners?
2.2
What’s on your T-shirt?
2.3
Your personal style
2.4
Where do you want to get to with your learners?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
A well-developed self-awareness is the first step in being emotionally
intelligent (and there is much more on self-awareness in Chapters 10–14). In
the context of teaching, before you consider using emotionally intelligent
strategies, it is especially important to be aware of how you tend to relate to
groups of learners. This is because the way in which you relate to your
learners will:
•
have an immediate effect on how they feel about being in the session –
it will affect the emotional environment (see more on this in Chapter 3);
•
influence your learners’ perception of how they should behave in the
session and of the roles available to them;
•
set the parameters for your own use of emotional intelligence.
I know that each group is different and always contains a collection of diverse
individuals, but it is hard as a teacher not to have an initial view on how to
relate to a group. Perhaps you see yourself as the spark to ignite the ﬂame of
enquiry in your learners? Or do you see them as potential persecutors who
will reveal the inadequacy of your knowledge? Or maybe just as fellow
learners who will join you in a journey of discovery? Whichever is the view
that you bring to a new group, that view will be at least partially self-fulﬁlling.
Have you ever experienced a colleague who always assumes the worst of a
Chapter 2

group before meeting them, in terms of their laziness or lack of enthusiasm
and so forth? That colleague sees their own role in terms of being a disci-
plinarian, forcing material on a reluctant audience, perhaps even engaging
in crowd control. If their behaviour with the group is based on those
expectations, they are more likely to have them conﬁrmed.
Activity 2.1 gives some examples of metaphors that you might use to
express how you relate to groups. One example is ‘carer to the vulnerable’.
If this describes your outlook on learners, then they are likely to feel cared
for, but there is a danger that your kindly approach may also be cultivating
a feeling of dependency in them. Your view of them will affect how they feel.
Even if you insist that you are ‘neutral’ in how you think about them and
that you concentrate on your content, methods and materials, that in itself
will have an effect. You cannot fail to communicate to your learners your
assumptions about your respective roles, and in so doing you will affect how
they feel and how they behave.
So, the expectations and the previous experiences of you and your learners
will help shape your relationship. Other factors may also have an inﬂuence.
If in your teaching you are preparing learners for work in a particular
profession or vocation, you may be obliged to reﬂect the values and behaviours
of that profession, for instance, by the way you dress or the way you address
each other. Also, constraints on how you and the learners relate to each other
may come from the perceived power relationship between you. If you are
ultimately responsible for assessing your learners by determining their grades,
then that limits the extent to which an open relationship is possible.
What you need to do is to explore how far you can go in transcending such
constraints and work towards an emotionally healthy relationship with your
learners. In particular, if you can achieve a relationship of trust, it can then
affect all activities in the classroom. It will affect how your learners behave,
how they view you and how they respond to the material. An incidental
beneﬁt is that it will allow you to be more ﬂexible in your approach. If you
want to experiment with a new activity or method of teaching, your learners
are more likely to go along with you when they know that you have their
best interests at heart and that they can trust you.
The following section, Investigating your practice, has four activities
designed to help you explore how far you are aware of how you relate 
to groups of learners and how you could work to adopt a more useful view
of them. Activities 2.1 and 2.2 invite you to use metaphors and phrases 
to capture your view of groups of learners. Activities 2.3 and 2.4 draw on
Transactional Analysis (TA). TA is a theory of personality and social
interaction as well as a tool used in therapy, which has its origins in the 1950s
and the work of Eric Berne (1910–70). TA Today by Ian Stewart and Vann
Joines (1987) remains an excellent introduction to the subject. Julie Hay is
also an author on TA whose books give a wealth of everyday applications
of the theory. Her Transactional Analysis for Trainers (1996) is especially
16 How you relate to your learners

relevant to the focus of this book, whether your work is in training or
education. There are other TA-related activities later in this book, namely
9.3, 10.1 and 10.4.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 2.1
How do you relate to your learners?
Metaphors are a useful device for standing back from the work you do and capturing
it in a phrase which then makes it easier to examine your behaviours and assumptions.
Here are some metaphors for how you might see yourself in relation to your learners:
•
law enforcer to the potentially criminal;
•
carer to the vulnerable;
•
advocate to the jury;
•
salesperson to potential buyers;
•
preacher to the sinful;
•
sheepdog to sheep;
•
website to surfers;
•
guru to followers;
•
gardener to plants;
•
tour guide to occupants of a tour bus.
Choose the metaphor that is the best ﬁt for you as a teacher most of the time. You
may want to make up a metaphor of your own which ﬁts better.

Activity 2.2
What’s on your T-shirt?
As in Activity 2.1, this is another way of conﬁrming what your message is to your
learners and then reﬂecting on the kind of emotional response this message might
provoke in them.
Imagine you are in front of your group of learners wearing a T-shirt. The T-shirt carries
a message which tells the group what you are going to do for them. Here are some
examples of messages:
I’m gonna show you how much I care
I’m gonna dazzle you with my knowledge
How you relate to your learners
19
2
What feelings is your adoption of this role likely to trigger in your learners?
Put into words the feelings you would ideally like to generate in your learners,
for example, curious, obedient, adventurous, awe.
What is the best role for you to adopt to help your learners achieve these
feelings?

I’m gonna make you laugh and make you think
I’m gonna rescue you
I’m gonna convert you
I’m gonna bring you into line
I’m gonna take you out of your comfort zone
I’m gonna give you whatever you ask for
I’m just gonna be nice to you
1
Take a moment to consider what your message(s) would be. It may be from the
list above or you may have a more suitable one of your own.
2
How do you think that your message(s) will make your learners feel? (For
example, relieved, frightened, pressured)
3
How will that feeling affect how they relate to you?
4
How far is their likely response helpful to their learning?
Activity 2.3
Your personal style
A personal style, also known as an ‘ego-state’, is part of the theory of Transactional
Analysis (TA) created by Eric Berne. A personal style describes how you are thinking,
feeling and behaving at any one moment. There are three broad categories of personal
style: Parent, Adult and Child. When you adopt the Parent personal style, you are
thinking, feeling and behaving in ways you associate with being a parent, which you
absorbed in your very early years from those who were responsible for your
upbringing.
20 How you relate to your learners

When you are using the Child personal style, you are replaying the thoughts, feelings
and behaviours you recall from the years when you were a young child. When you
adopt the personal style of Adult, your thoughts, feelings and behaviours are based on
what is happening here and now, rather than on your experiences of long ago.
There are two subdivisions of the personal styles Parent and Child: Controlling Parent
and Nurturing Parent and Natural Child and Adapted Child.
Here are the characteristics of each of the ﬁve personal styles and examples of the
kinds of things you might say as a teacher in each style:
Controlling Parent – directing, ﬁrm
‘Get into groups’
‘I am going to stop you here because we must get on to the next activity’
Nurturing Parent – caring, reassuring
‘Don’t worry if you can’t ﬁnish this’
‘Do you need me to explain that again?’
Adult – problem solving, logical
‘That is an interesting question’
‘How do you think we should approach this problem?’
Natural Child – spontaneous, creative, fun-loving
‘Let’s have some fun with this exercise’
‘I am really excited about what you have just said’
Adapted Child – compliant, polite OR rebellious, sulking
‘Is it OK to open the windows?’
‘I would be very grateful if you could ﬁll in this form before you leave’
(The key to Adapted Child behaviour is that it is always in response to parental
expectations.)
To find out more about your use of personal styles as a teacher, complete the
following questionnaire. Each statement relates to you and your learners during a
teaching session.

Your use of personal styles is clearly signiﬁcant in considering how you relate to groups
of learners. The point of becoming aware of your personal style preferences is to
move from using them unconsciously to taking more control of them. TA suggests
How you relate to your learners
23

that the reason we inhabit a particular style at any one time may be because we feel
comfortable with that style, because it conﬁrms the view of the world we developed
as a young child. Or it may be as a result of a transaction with someone else where
their behaviour has triggered us to switch to a complementary personal style. For
instance, as a teacher, a learner’s sulky, non-compliant behaviour (Adapted Child) might
provoke you, unconsciously, to flip into Controlling Parent in an attempt to exert
authority over the learner.
It is useful to be aware of your personal style preferences and then to work on
adapting your personal style to suit the circumstances. All of them may be employed
by a teacher and the key to using them effectively is to be able to switch personal
styles as appropriate. It is also important to recognize and handle others’ personal
styles. You need to review how balanced your use of personal styles is and to be wary
of being driven internally to adopt, for example, Nurturing Parent, when circumstances
suggest it would be more appropriate to adopt, say, Adult. Equally, look out for
whether the behaviours of learners provoke you into a particular personal style as in
the example above. There is more on the transactions between personal styles in
Activity 9.3.
Activity 2.4
Where do you want to get to with your learners?
The concept of ‘life positions’ is another part of the theory of TA. A life position is a
broad view you adopt of yourself in relation to the rest of the world. There are four
life positions:
•
‘I’m OK, you’re OK’;
•
‘I’m OK, you’re not OK’;
•
‘I’m not OK, you’re OK’;
•
‘I’m not OK, you’re not OK’.
This activity uses an alternative set of characterizations of the four life positions:
•
‘Get-on-with’;
(‘I’m OK, you’re OK’)
•
‘Get-rid-of’;
(‘I’m OK, you’re not OK’)
•
‘Get-away-from’;
(‘I’m not OK, you’re OK’)
•
‘Get-nowhere-with’.
(‘I’m not OK, you’re not OK’)
The key points about life positions are that:
•
your preference for one of these will determine how you view incidents and
24 How you relate to your learners

situations – the same behaviour or incident will be interpreted differently
according to the life position you adopt;
•
you can change your life position.
Here is an example of how your life position may affect your view of learners.
A learner asks:
‘How does what you are saying relate to my job?’
Get-on-with sees this as an interesting question which may be used to expand on the
session content.
Get-rid-of sees this as another example of the learner’s inadequate grasp of the material.
Get-away-from sees this as a threat to their authority and feels they can only give an
inadequate answer.
Get-nowhere-with sees it as just another indication of the futility of the whole session
– ‘they don’t understand and I’m inadequate’.
The following questionnaire helps you to check how your life position may be
inﬂuencing your view of your learners. For each statement below, think of yourself in
relation to the groups you teach or, if they are too diverse, focus on one particular
group you know or remember. Indicate whether on the whole you agree or disagree
with each statement.

Interpretation
Agreement with any or all of statements 2, 6, 9 and 13 indicates you spend some time
in the get-rid-of position. This corresponds to the life position ‘I’m OK, you’re not OK’,
a defensive position where you generally see yourself as blameless but are good at
seeing failings in others.
Agreement with any or all of statements 3, 8, 11 and 14 indicates you spend some
time in the get-away-from position. This corresponds to the life position ‘I’m not OK,
you’re OK’, where you see yourself at fault and others as capable and as potential
persecutors.
Agreement with any or all of statements 4, 7, 10 and 16 indicates you spend some
time in the get-nowhere-with position. This corresponds to the life position ‘I’m not OK,
you’re not OK’, where you have a negative view of yourself and of everyone else and
you experience despair.
Agreement with any or all of statements 1, 5, 12 and 15 indicates you spend some
time in the get-on-with position. This corresponds to the life position ‘I’m OK, you’re
OK’, described as the only position based on reality, where you are ready to
acknowledge situations for how they really are, to be open-minded and to tackle
problems.
26 How you relate to your learners

If any of your answers match positions other than get-on-with, take note the next time
you experience related feelings with a group. How much is your perception based on
reality and how much are you using it to confirm a long-held view of the world?
Remember, life positions can be changed but that can demand a signiﬁcant shift in how
you explain yourself, your relationships and your social environment.
DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Use your findings from the four activities above as the basis for plans to
develop your practice. For example, if you discovered that your prevalent
metaphor in 2.1 or your preferred T-shirt message in 2.2 is likely to generate
feelings in your learners which are not conducive to learning, then consider
how to talk or act yourself into a more productive view.
Making changes in response to your ﬁndings in the TA-related activities
above is not always easy. If these patterns of behaviour and attitudes are
based on your experience of the world when you were very young and
vulnerable, then it takes more than a simple cognitive decision to become
different. Being aware of your personal style and life position is a ﬁrst step
and that is what the activities above are designed to achieve. The possible
next step is to be attentive to your behaviour, thoughts and feelings and to
plan when to test out alternatives.
There is a particular task you can do in relation to activity 2.3. To begin
to exert more control over your use of personal styles, look at your bar chart.
Consider whether you would like to change the distribution of personal styles
on the chart. If there is one that you would like to spend less time in, which
one(s) would you like to increase in its place? Plan the kinds of behaviours
and phrases you could use to increase the time you spend in this personal
style.

Developing emotional intelligence through learner activities
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
Eric Jensen asserts that the state you are in is the most important factor
determining your readiness to learn. He writes, ‘All learning is state dependent’
(Jensen 1998: 192). State is characterized by the collection of emotions you
are feeling. In a learning state you experience those feelings which are more
conducive to learning, for example, valued, curious, safe, relaxed, connected
and motivated. A resourceful state affects the physiological processes of 
the brain in such a way that learning is more likely. You are ready to put
your energies into learning and not into ‘non-learning’ activities such as
disengagement and defensiveness.
Of course, there is a great deal of potential in the classroom situation to
induce feelings which do not create a learning state. With a colleague I
surveyed three groups of learners in higher education with questions about
their experience of what we termed ‘classroom climate’ and lecturer qualities.
One question we asked of respondents was to name ‘some of the feelings I
have come to associate with my favourite session’. Responses to this question
included ‘enthusiastic’, ‘fascination’, ‘happy and alive’, ‘enjoyment’, ‘being
valued’, ‘conﬁdent’, ‘curious’, ‘excited’. With another question we asked for
Chapter 3

feelings associated with their least favourite session. The most frequently
recurring response here was ‘boredom’, but others included ‘annoyed’,
‘frustration’, ‘impatient’, ‘anger’, ‘excluded’, ‘depressed’, ‘alienation’, ‘resent-
ment’, ‘humiliated’, ‘intimidated’. When feelings such as those in the latter
list are dominant, the brain switches into what has been characterized as the
‘ﬁght or ﬂight’ mode and physiological processes are activated which restrict
the functions in the brain that assist learning.
The learning state of an individual learner in the classroom will be to some
extent shaped by what they bring to the session. This will include their
reasons for being there, their previous experience of being a learner, and
whatever is uppermost in their thoughts and concerns at the time. The other
major contributor to the learning state of learners is the emotional environ-
ment – their overall experience of being in the classroom. The emotional
environment is shaped by many factors. Important ones include:
•
the behaviour of the teacher;
•
the behaviour of the learners;
•
the physical experience of the learners;
•
the language that is used by the teacher;
•
the materials and how they are used;
•
the activities that the learners engage in.
An ideal learning state has been described by Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi as
‘ﬂow’ (Csikszentmihalyi 2002). Flow is that state when you are completely
absorbed by a task. Flow occurs when there is a balance between your
motivation, your ability and the demands of the task, in a goal-directed,
structured context. You are not self-conscious about your activity and time
seems to ﬂy by. Most importantly, there is no sense of pressure or anxiety
that distracts you and prevents absorption. It is important to remember that
an optimal learning state does not mean a complete absence of stress for
learners. What is needed is a task that is clearly achievable – because being
set an unachievable task leads to feelings of helplessness and anxiety – but is
not so easy that it leads to a feeling of boredom.
You are bound to have an effect, by accident or design, on how your
learners feel during a session. While you are not solely responsible for how
they feel, your role in inﬂuencing the emotional environment and the learning
state of your learners is crucial. Most teachers are aware of the concept of
emotional environment but perhaps do not give as much conscious energy
to affecting it as it deserves. If the emotional environment is wrong, then
learning will always be a struggle. I suggest you should plan to create a
positive emotional environment and, in your planning, give this at least as
much attention as the content and your methods.
When the emotional environment is good it leads to learners who are more
likely to risk, explore, make connections and enquire. It can also assist your
30 Planning the emotional environment

learners in recognizing the emotional dimension in their own learning and
make them more likely to voice their feelings.
A large part of this book is directly concerned with the impact you can
have on the emotional environment. While Chapters 5–9 are all about aspects
of your behaviour in the classroom that affect the environment, this chapter
(along with 2 and 4) offers suggestions for how you can plan in advance to
influence the environment. In the remainder of this chapter, the section
Investigating your practice has five activities designed to help you look
critically at how you currently plan for the emotional environment. Activity
3.6 in Developing your practice follows on from your appraisal. Activities
3.7 and 3.8 suggest other strategies for inﬂuencing the emotional environ-
ment. Remember, not only should you plan for it, you should monitor it and
attempt to adjust it if necessary. It needs vigilance on your part. It is dynamic,
not fixed, and any event or comment in the session has the potential to
instantly affect the environment.
A useful question to ask yourself is, ‘Am I helping to create an emotional
environment in which my learners feel:
•
safe rather than threatened?
•
trustful rather than suspicious?
•
challenged but not pressured?
•
motivated not disengaged?’
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 3.1
Where do you put your planning energy?
This activity asks you to reﬂect on how much time you spend planning for the use of
emotional intelligence compared with planning for content, methods and materials.
This is especially important in a ﬁrst meeting with a group of learners as you don’t get
a second chance to make a ﬁrst impression.
As a percentage of the energy you spend planning a session, how much goes into
planning content?
As a percentage of the energy you spend planning a session, how much goes into
planning methods and materials?
As a percentage of the energy you spend planning a session, how much goes into
planning to use emotional intelligence?
Represent these proportions on a pie chart as in this example:
Planning the emotional environment
31

Consider whether this represents your ideal balance between these three
components. If you want to devote more energy to planning to use emotional
intelligence, activity 3.6 below suggests a way to do this.
Activity 3.2
Your use of language at the start of a session
This activity invites you to review the impact of your opening words. Words can have
a profound effect on our state of mind. The words you use with learners can
encourage a learning ‘state’ in them. The language you use at the start of a session
may be more important than that used later, as it sets the tone. The ﬁrst few minutes
can be crucial in shaping the learners’ view of you and of the session. This activity asks
you how far you want to go in trying to create the right state in your learners.
Here are three examples of the use of language at the start of a session.
Dull
Hello everyone. Welcome to the course. We have got a lot to get through today,
some of it I suspect you’ll ﬁnd less interesting than other parts. Unfortunately, there
will not be much time for questions, but at least I can give you handouts to take away.

Activity 3.3
Handouts
What you see inﬂuences how you feel. How many times have you witnessed learners
on a course complain about a handout – because it is poorly copied or typed, there
is too much to take in, the type is too small and so on? This activity gives you the
opportunity to review a handout from that perspective.
Find a handout, preferably one that you have been given but otherwise one that you
have used yourself.
Comment critically on each item from the following checklist:

How would you describe the handout overall?
For example, sparse; messy; cluttered; well laid out
How does the look of the handout make you feel?
For example, impressed; dispirited; irritated; reassured; inspired
As a result of your responses, draft a new improved version of a part of the handout.

Is it welcoming or offputting?

Activity 3.4
Maintaining variety of experience for your
learners
The brain needs a variety of stimuli to work at its best. Too much of any one stimulus,
however good in itself, can lead to feelings of boredom, withdrawal or frustration.
This activity invites you to review how much variety is experienced by your learners.
Consider the last session you ran.
Note how many minutes were spent on each of these activities:

Activity 3.5
Accommodating your learners’ differing
intelligences
There are many differences in the way individuals learn. Howard Gardner introduced
the concept of Multiple Intelligences in his 1983 book, Frames of Mind, and has
continued to reﬁne it since (Gardner 1999). He rejects the question, ‘How intelligent
are you?’ in favour of ‘How are you intelligent?’ He recognizes that we have differing
intelligence proﬁles, based on the extent to which we have developed our potential
in each of our intelligences. He originally identified seven intelligences. They are:
linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinaesthetic, musical, interpersonal and
intrapersonal. The way learners feel in a session can be inﬂuenced by the extent to
which their dominant intelligences are catered for. This activity suggests how you
could prevent any learners from feeling excluded in this way.
Planning the emotional environment
35

Here are the types of learning activity that suit each intelligence:
Linguistic
Likely to respond well to learning activities such as those which involve:
a variety of text and auditory stimulus; the chance to talk through new concepts; public
speaking; creative writing; verbal debate.
Logical-mathematical
Likely to respond well to learning activities such as those which involve:
using abstract symbols to represent concrete objects and concepts; seeing patterns
in ideas and relationships; solving logical puzzles and working out sequences; cause
and effect analysis; calculating; estimating.
Spatial
Likely to respond well to learning activities such as those which involve:
imagining; drawing; designing; construction; painting; Mind-Mapping.
Bodily/kinaesthetic
Likely to respond well to learning activities such as those which involve:
movement, touch or other physical experiences; hands-on projects; role play; working
with objects.
Musical
Likely to respond well to learning activities such as those which involve:
working with sounds; keeping rhythm.
Interpersonal
Likely to respond well to learning activities such as those which involve:
cooperative learning; considering issues from a range of perspectives; interpersonal
problem-solving; giving feedback; receiving feedback; active listening.
36 Planning the emotional environment

Intrapersonal
Likely to respond well to learning activities such as those which involve:
time for reﬂection; self-assessment; feelings responses; developing self-awareness.
Is there one or more of these intelligences and learning activity preferences that
describes you?
We often teach in the way that we like to learn and we respond best to learners who
learn in the same way as we do. However, if your teaching does not include activities
for all preferences, some individuals will have less of a sense of belonging and may feel
excluded.
Take each intelligence in turn and, looking back on a recent session, ask yourself what
you did to connect with learners who would prefer to use that intelligence.
DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 3.6
Planning for meeting a new group
Planning to use emotional intelligence is particularly important when you are meeting
a new group of learners. This activity suggests ﬁve key areas to consider in planning

and scheduling activities which help to create a positive emotional environment for a

Activity 3.7
Finding out about your learners as individuals
This activity looks at how you can introduce personal information about the learners
into the session, while keeping the session relevant to the topic in hand. Such
information can affect the environment for the better because it reminds everyone
that, behind the role of learner, there are people too. Depending on the topic, it can
also produce a lot of humour!
Think of a course that you run, then choose a speciﬁc topic that is included on the
course. Create a question that could be asked of all members of the group which
could provide a focus for them in understanding the topic and at the same time reveal
something about them as individuals. A number of individual answers could be heard
by the group as a whole.
Look at the examples below. Then create some questions of your own.
Example 1
On a course about how people learn, there is an activity that begins by asking learners
to think of one thing they are good at. The point of this brief activity is to explore
how they became good at whatever it is and, from that starting point, to consider
what makes for effective learning. Before asking the follow-up questions, you can ask
everyone in turn to state the thing they have identiﬁed themselves as good at.
This reveals positive personal information about everyone to the whole of the group
and it can have a very beneﬁcial effect on the environment. Learners will have had the
chance to declare something personal about themselves which is not necessarily
connected with why they are there. It is also a positive aspect of themselves that they
have revealed. This activity can have the same effect as an icebreaker but be directly
integrated into a session.

Example 2
A teacher is introducing the topic of information retrieval. The teacher asks each
person in the group to say what system they use (if any) at home for storing things,
e.g. CDs, bills, tools, books.
Activity 3.8
Developing emotional intelligence through learner
activities
One important factor which has an effect on the emotional environment in the
classroom is learners’ behaviour. You can encourage more emotionally intelligent
behaviours on the part of learners by introducing learning activities which, in
themselves, invite the learners to behave in emotionally intelligent ways.
Here are three such activities.
Five minutes each way
•
Learners are in pairs.
•
One talks, the other listens.
•
The listener can talk but must not take the talker off course.
•
The talker has the chance to articulate their thoughts, responses or feelings about
the course so far.
•
After ﬁve minutes they swap roles.
This could be used at any point in the session. When used at the beginning, it can act
as an icebreaker, with learners talking about, for example, what they already know
about the topic. The method may also be used in the middle or at the end of the
session, with learners using the five minutes for making sense of the session, for
recalling content, for making plans to use the content, or for beginning to reﬂect on
the content. The listener can learn a great deal through the discipline of being attentive
and putting themselves into the speakers’ frame of reference (see Activity 7.3).
Giving feedback
On courses where participants have been learning a skill, create the chance for one
to perform a skill (learner A) and for another to observe the performance (learner
B). Guide B in the principles of giving effective feedback, which include:
•
Start with the positive
•
Sandwich the negative between the positive
40 Planning the emotional environment

•
Conﬁne your feedback to the amount the recipient can handle rather than the
amount you would like to give
•
Make sure the feedback is something the recipient is in a position to act on
•
Make observations, not inferences
•
Be speciﬁc rather than generalizing
•
Leave the recipient feeling motivated
Direct B to give feedback to A on A’s performance, guided by these principles. This
activity forces B to consider A’s perspective when both planning and giving feedback.
Action learning sets
For courses which involve the same group meeting on more than one occasion, with
intervals in between, create action learning sets. If, for example, your sessions are a
day long, you could devote 60–90 minutes to meetings of action learning sets in each
session. An action learning set is a group of four or ﬁve. Each meeting of the set gives
each member an equal amount of time to draw on the help of the other members to
solve their problem and progress with their development. Prepare the group members
by explaining the key points in the process and their roles.
Key points in the process:
•
Keep the focus on the individual
•
Other group members listen, support, challenge
•
Maintain an equal distribution of time
•
Maintain a cooperative and positive atmosphere
•
Ensure clear action planning, for example, ‘what I must do before we meet again’
Roles:
Each set must have one of each of these:
•
Chair/time-keeper
•
Note-taker – keeps a record of the outcomes of each member’s allocated time
•
Reporter – reports to the rest of the group at the end of the meeting on how
far the group stuck to the key points in the process
Planning the emotional environment
41

Stress that it is essential for the group to save time at the end of a meeting to hear
from the reporter and to review how well they operated as a set.
Liz Beaty and Ian McGill have noted that ‘Learning to use empathy within a set can be
one of the most important developmental experiences from the action learning
process itself’ (Beaty and McGill 2001: 26). Their book, Action Learning, gives detailed
information on the operation of action learning sets.
42 Planning the emotional environment

Planning for the physical
experience of learners
This chapter includes the following activities:
4.1
What is the physical experience of your learners?
4.2
Shaping your learners’ physical experience
4.3
Ensuring that your learners get moving
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
It is easy to overlook the physical experience of your learners when you are
planning for a session and yet our physical experience is entwined with our
emotional experience. This means that the teacher who wishes to create
positive emotional states in their learners has to consider what is going to
happen to those learners physically in the session.
Candace Pert, in her book Molecules of Emotion, asserts that the areas of
study for each of three separate disciplines – neuroscience, endocrinology
and immunology – are in fact linked. The link is neuropeptides, which she
dubs ‘information carriers’. As a result, ‘every change in the physiological
state is accompanied by an appropriate change in the mental emotional state,
conscious or unconscious’ (Pert 1999: 137). This feels intuitively right – your
physical state affects your emotional state – but it becomes very signiﬁcant
for teachers if we accept Pert’s suggestion that we should think of the ‘mobile
brain’ within our bodies. This is the term she uses for the ‘psychosomatic
network through which intelligent information travels from one system to
another’ (ibid.: 188).
This view is endorsed from the perspective of neuroscience by Antonio
Damasio. He speaks of the body and the brain being an ‘indissociable
organism’ (Damasio 1996: xviii). You cannot fully understand mental
processes unless you take into account the context in which they are
operating, that is, how the organism of the body and brain interacts with the
physical and social environment. Most importantly, ‘feeling depends on
Chapter 4

activity in a number of speciﬁc brain systems interacting with a number of
body organs’ (ibid.: xviii). The learner’s brain that you are trying to connect
with as you teach may be located in the head, but it is fully integrated with
the rest of the body. The physical, emotional and learning states are
interlinked. This means that if you want to inﬂuence your learners’ readiness
to learn, you have to address the whole person, including what happens to
them physically during the session.
It is useful to consider three components of the learners’ physical
experience when planning:
•
movement;
•
the physical environment;
•
comfort.
Movement
Even though it is known that sitting down for long periods of time is bad
news for learners, there is a tradition in most areas of education and training
that the learners sit down and stay sitting down for the duration of the
session. Have you ever been aware that one or more of your learners has
begun to nod off? Perhaps you thought it was because you were boring or
because the person was not ﬁt and alert themselves. Have you ever considered
it is simply because they have had no chance to move? While you have been
distributing handouts, moving to and from the flipchart/laptop/overhead
projector, talking and generally being quite physically active, they have been
immobile and mostly silent. The minimum you can do is to ensure that they
are standing for at least some of the time which will lead to an increase in
the amount of oxygenated blood going to the brain. This in turn arouses the
nervous system and leads to neural ﬁring and the growth of the dendrites
and axons which make the connections that lead to learning.
The physical environment
Have you ever considered what learners can see when they are in a session?
In the traditional classroom arrangement, most learners will have a good
view of the backs of other learners’ heads. They may also be in one of those
rooms that look like they were designed, if that is the right word, for
interrogation or imprisonment, so stark and bare is the environment. This
could well be another effect of the Cartesian assumption that learning is solely
about a meeting of minds. This view holds that the intellect alone is active
when learning takes place and, as it is separate from body and soul, the
environment is irrelevant. Even when you are in a reasonable room you may
ﬁnd that it has been used by others for what might politely be called ‘storage’
or more accurately ‘dumping’. You may be faced with furniture, boxes and
44 Planning for the physical experience of learners

so on which are at best a distraction and at worst a subliminal depressing
inﬂuence on the room’s inhabitants. All of these factors affect your learners’
disposition towards the session. Underestimate them and your carefully
planned session will lose some of its impact. The least you can do is create
time to make the environment inoffensive, with nothing unsightly. If you are
able, take the time to arrange the seating and introduce peripherals, such as
posters or relevant, rolling screensavers or music at break times, to improve
this aspect of the learners’ physical experience.
Comfort
The quality of the seating, lighting and heating are not always within your
control but you can investigate just how far you can make changes. Those
feedback forms which say, ‘great session but the chairs were very uncom-
fortable’ are not ﬂippant and you should be ready to check your learners’
level of comfort during the session.
Activity 4.1 asks you to appreciate the perspective of learners in terms of
their physical experience in a session and to explore possible improvements.
The two following activities invite you to consider ways of improving your
learners’ physical experience of your sessions.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 4.1
What is the physical experience of your learners?
Look at the checklist below. Take a session that you have run recently, preferably in a
room with which you are familiar. For each physical factor, answer the three questions.

Shaping your learners’ physical experience
Look at your entries in column four, in activity 4.1, ‘How could I change it for the

Take each of your responses in that column in turn and plan how to introduce those
changes for a forthcoming session. Consider whether you need to:
•
speak to anybody about moving to another room or changing the furniture or
contents of the room around;

Activity 4.3
Ensuring that your learners get moving
Here are six suggestions which will ensure that your participants do more than just
sit. Remember with all of these to say to the learners that if mobility or standing is
difﬁcult for anyone, they may of course stay seated.
1
When learners are forming groups, ask them to ﬁnd one or two others who are
‘not sitting next to you’ or ‘not from your table’ or ‘from the opposite side of
the room’ or ‘who you have not worked with or spoken to yet in the session’.
2
Instead of distributing the handouts, place them in three or four piles around the
room and ask everyone to collect one.
3
Ask participants to stand while carrying out any brief activity in twos or threes.
4
Ask participants to ‘promenade’, i.e. walk and talk with each other while carrying
out any brief activity in pairs.
5
Arrange a ‘line-up’ – participants are asked to stand in one line. Their place in
the line is determined by where they ‘stand’ on a question which relates to the
topic of the session, for example:
Managers spend too much time focusing on the endpoint of the change, not the transition
The line stretches from ‘wholly agree’ to ‘wholly disagree’.
(The point of such an activity, apart from stimulating movement, is to encourage
learners to consider their opinion on a topic and, in order to get to the right
point in the line, they are forced to speak with others to ﬁnd out their position,
thereby engaging with each other and with the topic.)

Consider taking more frequent ﬁve-minute breaks.

Your way is OK
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?
When you next meet a group of learners for the first time, take a look at 
the individuals assembled there. They will include people who feel excited,
hopeful, fearful, anxious, vulnerable and impatient. There will be the keen
and the curious, the cynical and the defensive. These feelings will be based,
for the most part, on their assumptions about the course ahead. They will
all have expectations about what is going to happen. They are likely to be
asking themselves questions such as:
•
Will it be death by PowerPoint?
•
Will I have to do those embarrassing role plays?
•
Will I have to speak?
•
Will we ﬁnish on time?
From your experience, as a teacher or as a learner, I am sure you can think
of other kinds of questions they might be asking.
If you are concerned about having a positive inﬂuence on the emotional
state of your learners, it is essential for you to take steps to acknowledge and
inﬂuence this range of initial feelings. You have to display your emotional
intelligence by dealing with your learners’ expectations.
Chapter 5

It is easy, in the role of teacher, to overlook or underestimate the power
of these feelings. You may be very familiar with the course you are about to
run. You know the material very well and, because you have planned the
course, you have a clear picture of what is going to happen when. It is true
that you may have anxieties of your own but do not forget that you will
always have the advantage over your learners of knowing in detail what is
planned.
Your learners will have expectations based on their previous experience
of being in similar situations. They are likely to have expectations which
relate to how they will behave, think and feel; to their role as a learner; to
the content; and to your role as a teacher. They may well have an initial
expectation about how useful the course will be. It is most likely that some
individuals within the group will have different expectations from each other
and it is very possible that your expectations may differ from some or from
the entire group.
If expectations are not dealt with, there is the potential for a great deal 
of learner energy going into unproductive emotions such as anxiety and
frustration. If one of them is sitting there worrying about, for example,
whether the session is going to end on time, that is all energy diverted away
from participating fully in the session. If the expectations of an individual do
not match what is going to happen, that could eventually lead to frustration
and disappointment on their part when they realize those expectations are
not going to be fulﬁlled.
It is important to deal with expectations because:
•
you can prevent learner energy from being wasted on unproductive
emotions;
•
if you take the time to hear their expectations, you are in a better position
to make connections between your material and your learners’ interests
or concerns;
•
the very act of acknowledging your learners’ hopes, worries and so on
has a positive effect on how they feel;
•
it initiates a productive relationship between you and your learners
characterized by dialogue and the sharing of information.
Key questions to ask yourself are:
•
Should I provide the opportunity for individuals to air their expectations,
anxieties and so on?
•
How far should I attempt to acknowledge their expectations, anxieties
and so on?
•
Am I sharing all of the information I have that will be useful to them
about what is going to happen?
•
Should I arrange for any negotiation about what is going to happen?
50 Dealing with your learners’ expectations

The section Investigating your practice which follows has three activities
which invite you to examine the extent to which you currently deal with
expectations. Developing your practice has four activities which suggest
strategies you can use for dealing with expectations in a new group. Which
strategies you use depends, among other things, on the duration of the course
and the number of learners you have. Of course, it would be inappropriate
to use all of them because they overlap.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 5.1
Addressing learners’ fears
Thomas Sappington described four kinds of fears that adult learners typically have
when a new class starts (Sappington 1984). They are:
Outcome fears
These include: ‘Will it be a waste of time?’ ‘Will there be enough time to absorb
everything?’ ‘Will I get what I need to know?’
Evaluation fears
These include: ‘Will there be a test?’ ‘Will I fail?’
Interpersonal fears
These relate to exchanges with both the teacher and other learners. They include:
‘Will I get clear directions from the teacher?’ ‘Will I be put on the spot?’ ‘Is there a
potential for embarrassment?’
Internal fears
These include: ‘Will I feel inadequate or incompetent?’ ‘Will I find that I have to
change?’
Take each kind of fear in turn and ask, ‘What do I currently do to anticipate these
fears in my learners and to allay them?’

Consider a session that you have run. How and when did you ensure that the following
was clear to all learners?
•
Your style of teaching

What your group will be expected to do as learners
•
What learners can expect to gain from the session and how this will be achieved
•
Why the learners are doing this, for example, how it is related to their work or
to their learning needs
•
An outline of the content
•
Who is expected to speak when and how
•
What time subsequent sessions will start, in reality

as a PowerPoint presentation will be available to the learners in a handout
What other essential information did you have that your learners needed to know?
Activity 5.2
Passing on the information, II
This is an activity for you if you are involved in assessing your learners. Take an
assessed course that you are responsible for. With regard to the assessment, which
of the following is known to the learners?
•
What they will be assessed on
•
When that assessment will happen
•
What form it takes
•
How it is marked
•
Who marks it
•
What are the criteria for success in the assessment
•
How soon after the assessment they will know the result
•
How to ﬁnd out the result
•
When and how to regain their work
•
If feedback is available and, if so, when and how
•
How the work they are doing now relates to the assessment
•
What guidance they can get in preparing for the assessment
Are there any other facts relating to the assessment that your learners should know?
Dealing with your learners’ expectations
53

DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
One simple approach to developing your practice is to revisit the checklists
in activities 5.2 and 5.3 above. You may recite all the information in 5.2 at
the beginning of a session but it is worth simply asking learners if there are
any questions or comments before you start. For the information on
assessment in 5.3, you might say that all of this is available to your learners
as it is provided in a course guide. It is worth considering whether you need
to do more to ensure that the information is received by learners. This could
be done by providing regular opportunities for learners to ask about
assessment. There is every likelihood that you will ﬁnd yourself repeating
details but that may be what is needed to create learners who are reassured
about the process. Lewis Elton suggests that clarity about assessment
improves the extrinsic motivation of learners as they can be clearer about
what is required for success (Elton 1996). None of this means that they will
be less anxious about passing the assessment but it removes those anxieties
that stem from uncertainty about what is required.
Other options include:
•
Establish ground rules, through negotiation or simply by declaring them;
•
Arrange for discussion of ‘hopes and expectations, fears and worries’;
•
Exchange with the learners your expectations of each other;
•
Let your learners know that ‘their way is OK’.
Each of these four strategies is developed below.
Activity 5.4
Ground rules
Ground rules specify acceptable behaviour for learners on a course. The following
three approaches to devising ground rules for a course give learners the chance to
take some control over the rules and to collaborate with other learners, and to take
account of the needs of other learners. In this way, the process of agreeing rules not
only gives clarity about what everyone may expect but also increases motivation and
the potential for collaborative learning.
Here are three ways to agree a set of ground rules for the operation of a group. They
all assume that the group does not consist of more than 15 people and that this group
is going to meet on a regular basis.
Method A
1.
Distribute a provisional set of rules such as this sample set.
54 Dealing with your learners’ expectations

Sample set of ground rules
•
We will always begin no later than ﬁve minutes after the agreed start time
and end no later than the agreed ﬁnish time.
•
We will review the scheduled programme at the start of each session to
consider whether we need more or less time on any items.
•
Any group member may speak at any time.
•
Anyone who wishes to speak may not interrupt but should indicate they
wish to speak by raising their hand.
•
We will ensure that everyone has equal opportunity to speak.
•
Everyone’s opinions will be respected.
•
Everything that is discussed in this group is confidential and cannot be
repeated outside the group without the speaker’s permission.
2
Allow a few minutes for everyone to consider them.
3
Go through each item with the group, in order to:
•
Check a common understanding
•
Invite rewording of it
•
Work on reaching a consensus on whether to adopt it
4
Receive any suggestions for additional rules and then go through steps 2 and 3
again.
5
Display the agreed set of rules.
6
For subsequent sessions, display the rules again or provide copies of them for
everyone.
Method B
1
Display or give a copy of the list below to the group.
•
Who speaks, when and how
•
Interruptions
•
Conﬁdentiality
•
Punctuality
•
Ensuring shared time for speaking
Dealing with your learners’ expectations
55

•
Responding to each others’ opinions
2
Discuss each issue in turn to arrive at relevant rules, each of which has to be
accepted by the group.
3
Write out the agreed set of rules and display or distribute them.
Method C
1
Ask each person to write down, on separate pieces of paper, any ground rules
they would wish for the group.
2
Collect them.
3
Group any similar suggestions together.
4
Take each cluster of suggestions in turn to discuss as a group and attempt to
reach a consensus about a rule.
5
Write out the agreed set of rules and display or distribute them.
Activity 5.5
Hopes and expectations, fears and worries
This activity shows how you can spend time at the beginning of a course giving
everyone the chance to articulate their hopes, expectations, fears and worries.
Providing this opportunity will, in itself, greatly aid learners’ engagement with the
course and will signal that these matters are important and that it is appropriate to
talk about them. Individuals will also almost certainly see that they are not alone in
their fears and worries. They will also get the chance to receive reassurance or
guidance from you as a teacher. You may even adjust some aspect of your approach
in light of what they say. This process will be another means of developing a productive
dialogue between you and your learners.
Step 1
At the start of a session ask individuals to take ﬁve minutes to think what are:
•
their hopes and expectations;
•
their fears and worries
about the course and, if they wish, to write them down in two columns.
56 Dealing with your learners’ expectations

Step 2
Ask them to ﬁnd a partner and spend ﬁve to ten minutes asking that person about
their hopes and expectations, fears and worries.
Step 3
Ask each pair to join with another pair. Give out ﬂipchart paper and marker pens to
each group of four. Each person takes it in turn to introduce their partner’s list to the
other two, making sure that their partner has the chance to modify what is said. Each
group of four produces a summary on one side of ﬂipchart paper of their hopes and
expectations, fears and worries. This should take ten to ﬁfteen minutes. During this
time, you too have been recording your hopes and expectations, fears and worries
on one side of ﬂipchart paper.
Step 4
All ﬂipcharts are displayed.
Step 5
Take ﬁve minutes for everyone to look at all of them.
Step 6
You respond to what is written, taking care to:
•
Cover everything
•
Accept every comment
•
Provide information as appropriate
Allow ten to ﬁfteen minutes.
Activity 5.6
Exchanging expectations
Distribute copies of the list ‘As a learner, I expect’ to your group, or number the items
and display them for all to see. Ask the learners to look at the list and indicate which
of the statements match their expectations.
Then ask for a show of hands on each item, such as, ‘How many of you have ticked
“to be asked what I want to do”?’ This gives you an indication of the expectations of
the group as a whole. You can reply to each item by saying how far it matches what
Dealing with your learners’ expectations
57

you are planning. This activity gives you and your learners the chance to explore how
far your expectations match. Its beneﬁts are:
•
It indicates to you whether you need to consider modifying your plans, if your
learners’ expectations are so far from yours that they will feel alienated.
•
It gives you the chance to show that you acknowledge and respect your learners’
expectations, even if you are not going to meet all of them.
•
It initiates dialogue between you and your learners.
•
Crucially it lessens the chance for growing frustration on your learners’ part if
their expectations are not to be met.
58 Dealing with your learners’ expectations
As a learner, I expect:
•
to be told what to do
•
that the teacher knows more than me
•
to be asked what I want
•
to inﬂuence the progress of the session/course
•
to be told if I am right or wrong
•
to be made welcome
•
to decide for myself what I want to get out of the session/course
•
that the teacher knows what will be covered in a session/course
•
to be helped by other learners
•
that I will be encouraged to apply the learning to my personal
circumstances
•
that the knowledge I gain will be from the teacher
•
to help other learners learn
•
to provide information useful to the teacher
•
that I will make notes
•
to be asked what I think
•
to be asked to evaluate the session/course
•
to ensure that I learn something
•
the teacher to ensure that I learn something

You may want to use this additional checklist, ‘As a teacher, I expect’ to explain the
alternatives open to you, which you will be opting for and why.
Activity 5.7
Your way is OK
This activity is especially useful at the start of a course or session. Initially, learners
will be wondering how they will be expected to behave and to respond to the course.
For instance, some may be worried that they will not understand the content, while
others may be concerned that they will have to agree, or comply, with the content
and everything the teacher says. You can help to remove the potential block this state
can cause by making a statement which recognizes that they will feel or think or behave
in a range of ways and that these are normal and acceptable. You are in effect saying
that it is OK for all to react in their own way.
Dealing with your learners’ expectations

As a teacher, I expect:

60 Dealing with your learners’ expectations
Think of a session you ran recently. What could you have said to let your
learners know that their way of behaving was OK?
Example:
‘You may be uncertain whether you need to take notes. Everything I show you
on a slide I will be giving you on a handout so you do not have to take notes
but, of course, you may choose to anyway.’
Your example:
Think of a session you ran recently. What could you have said to let your
learners know that their way of thinking was OK?
Example:
‘When I have run this session before, some learners have found the topic quite
useful to know about, others have found that the model doesn’t work for them
and a few have said that it totally transformed their approach to the subject. It
will be interesting to see if you fall into one of those categories.’

Acknowledging individual
learners
This chapter includes the following activities:
6.1
How far do I currently acknowledge individual learners?
6.2
Using learners’ names
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
One simple but very important way in which you can affect a learner’s
feelings for the better is to acknowledge their existence. We all need to be
acknowledged and we normally are, in our family, social and work groupings.
Even if sometimes we do not like how we are perceived by others, at least
we know that they are aware of us. However, in a group of learners there 
is a strong possibility that we will not be acknowledged, and this can leave
us with an unsatisfactory sense of not belonging.
The concept of ‘strokes’ from Transactional Analysis (TA) is helpful here.
(There is more on strokes in Chapter 10.) TA tells us that a stroke is a ‘unit
of recognition’. It is when one person acknowledges the existence of another,
verbally or non-verbally, positively or negatively. You ‘give someone a stroke’
when you say ‘Hello’ or smile at them or even frown at them. It is based on
Eric Berne’s concept of recognition hunger (Stewart and Joines 1987: 72).
He suggests that when we are babies we thrive on physical attention and
normally receive a sufﬁciency of it, through being picked up, played with and
cuddled. Ian Stewart and Vann Joines (ibid.: 72) cite Spitz’s studies of babies
in a children’s home which indicate that the lack of this physical attention
has an adverse effect on us both emotionally and physically. As we grow
older, we still have this need, but we often substitute forms of recognition
other than the physical. We all need strokes and any stroke, even a negative
one, is better than no stroke at all. Simply being acknowledged can affect
your emotional state for the better.
Chapter 6

A study at Staffordshire University (Thomas 2002) found that students 
in higher education in the UK were more likely to drop out of their studies
because of lack of a sense of belonging rather than, as is commonly supposed,
because of lack of ﬁnance. This belonging depended on relationships with
other students but also relationships with lecturers. ‘If you go to a lecture
and you answer one of their questions, and they say, “What’s your name?”
it just doesn’t feel like they value your presence. If they can’t be bothered to
learn my name . . .’ (ibid.: 433). The Staffordshire study indicates that we
should do more in the classroom to help individuals feel they belong. I suspect
this need not even go as far as valuing individuals; acknowledgement alone,
in a positive or negative way, will make the learner more likely to stay.
Staff in further and higher education who are concerned about retention
make plans, quite justifiably, about selection procedures, course design,
assessment, feedback strategies and student support and guidance in order
to improve the retention rate. The aspect of the learners’ experience that it
is quite easy to overlook, however, is the immediate impact of what happens
in the classroom. When this part of the learners’ experience leaves them
feeling that they are fully acknowledged, and hopefully valued and respected
too, they are more likely to maintain motivation and engagement in their
learning experience.
In the classroom there are three levels at which you can acknowledge
learners:
•
Eye contact
•
Using learners’ names
•
Referring back to previous contributions
Eye contact
Ask yourself, do you make a point of making eye contact with every person
in your class? Or do you, like so many of us, unwittingly concentrate on those
more receptive, welcoming faces? I have witnessed teachers who connect with
one face in the room and stay ﬁxed on it for far too long. The effect is almost
comical if it were not potentially so upsetting for most of the learners. The
recipient of the teacher’s look becomes more anxious and more ready to
please, feeling they have to respond to the teacher’s talk on behalf of the
whole group. The rest of the group start to question if they are truly there,
as the teacher has taken no notice of them for so long. On other occasions
it is just the few who are immediately to the teacher’s left or right who are
excluded from eye contact and who start to feel invisible. For the teacher, it
requires a conscious effort to swivel right round and capture everyone.
64 Acknowledging individual learners

Using learners’ names
The use or non-use of learners’ names always has an impact on how they feel
about their learning and on the climate in the room. Learners who are never
addressed by name by the teacher are likely to feel very differently from those
who are. Most learners value this recognition greatly. It shows that you have
identiﬁed their presence as an individual. Even mature, conﬁdent learners
will welcome this.
I acknowledge that in some circumstances, especially if you are a university
lecturer, you have too many students in a session and/or too many different
groups in a week for you ever to be able to know or use names. But if your
group sizes are 30 or less, it should be possible to know and use everyone’s
name. Teachers often say, ‘I’m no good with names’ but I am convinced that
it depends on how motivated you are to learn them. Instead of saying, ‘I wish
I could remember names’ or ‘It would be nice to use them’, you need to 
say, ‘It is essential that I use names’ and act accordingly. That means putting
more energy into remembering and using names. It means deliberately
planning the beginning of a session with a new group so that you have the
opportunity to learn and use names. If you perceive that using names is the
most important thing you do in the ﬁrst hour with a new group, that in itself
will make it more likely to happen. Activity 6.1 below suggests one way of
doing this. If you do have far too many in your group to remember their
names, it may be worth explaining this to the group. You might then choose
to ask the names of individuals when they speak and use their names at the
same time.
You may sometimes work in a situation which uses ‘delegate cards’, with
each person’s name written on a card in front of them. Of course these are
useful for group members. Be wary of relying on them yourself, however.
This can make you lazy about learning names and you ﬁnd yourself reading
their card before you speak to the learner. If you are going to be seeing a
group on a number of occasions, consider taking everyone’s photograph
during the ﬁrst session. You can then keep a copy of their photographs with
names. You may even be able to distribute or put on a website copies of the
photographs for everyone in the group, subject to their permission.
An incidental benefit of getting to know names is that it forces you to
acknowledge to yourself that this is a collection of individuals and not ‘year
3’ or whatever category you have assigned to them all. It also assists you
greatly in controlling classroom activity. For example, you can say, ‘Let’s
hear from Jo, then Kiran and then Richard.’ If you want to exercise some
control over the composition of small groups, it is invaluable to be able to
direct this by using names.
Acknowledging individual learners
65

Referring back to previous contributions
Knowing names also helps in the final level of acknowledging learners –
referring back to what individuals have said before. Make a conscious effort
to refer back to the contributions of individuals in the group, such as, ‘As
Alex pointed out earlier’; or ‘This next section deals with Chris’s important
question of a few minutes ago’. You don’t need to do this, but the positive
impact on the individuals concerned can be very potent.
Acknowledging individuals is one of those behaviours that you may well
be doing spontaneously. I suggest however that it is important to become
conscious of what you do about this and to monitor your behaviour. You
should treat it as a vital part of the use of emotional intelligence with learners
and you should do it consciously and deliberately.
There are two activities in the remainder of this chapter. Activity 6.1 invites
you to review your current practice in acknowledging individual learners,
while Activity 6.2 suggests a technique for remembering names.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 6.1
How far do I currently acknowledge individual
learners?
To review your current practice in acknowledging individuals, think of the last group
you taught. Ask yourself the following questions:
1
Did I make eye contact with all of the group?
2
Did I ﬁnd myself making eye contact with some members of the group more than
others? If so, why was that?
3
Do I know everyone’s name?
4
How have I come to know the names I do?
5
Did I use everyone’s name?
6
How often did I refer back to individual contributions?
66 Acknowledging individual learners

DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 6.2
Using learners’ names
This activity suggests a series of steps intended to help you to remember and use the
names of a new group of up to 30 learners.
1
If you are able, speak with as many individuals as you can and ﬁnd out their names
before the session starts. For example, you could make time to greet them.
2
Ensure that each person is introduced to the whole group in the ﬁrst 20 minutes
of the session. This may be done just as some form of introduction or as a follow-
up to an icebreaker where each introduces their partner. This is the point at
which you should write down learners’ names.
3
While you are listening to these introductions, you may also be able to recite
mentally the names you have already heard.
4
At the end of each introduction, take the opportunity to use that person’s name,
for example, ‘Thank you, Sarah.’
5
Ensure that learners engage in another activity within the following 30 minutes
and arrange that, while they are busy, you will have the time then to go through
their names. Do it like this: look at each person and see if you remember their
name. Say the name to yourself while looking at the person. If you have to read
it from your list, then say it to yourself again while looking at them.
6
Eventually go around the whole group saying their names to yourself.
7
When their activity has finished, make sure that you use at least some of the
names, if not all.
8
Later, check which names you have not used and make sure you use them before
the session is over.
This method assists you in memorizing because you are learning by reading, hearing
and speaking the names.
Many teachers say that they are far too preoccupied with what they have to say or
what they need to get learners to do and that there is no time to concentrate on
names. It is a question of priorities and if you rate the use of names as important, you
must devote time and energy to planning for using and remembering them.

7.4
Analysing a listener’s responses
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
In preparing to be a teacher, a great deal of your energy goes into learning
how to talk to groups. In your role, you will need to explain, direct and
inform, and so there are whole courses on presentation skills, how to project
your voice and so on. The complementary skill of listening is just as important
as talking but is often overlooked. Teachers need to know how to listen. The
ability to listen, to attend to others, is an integral component of emotional
intelligence. It is a prerequisite for being effective in ‘social skills’, the 
fifth of Daniel Goleman’s emotional and social competencies (Goleman 
1998: 318).
There are some excellent courses on listening skills. They usually assume
that you are going to use the skills in listening to one person at a time, as in
counselling. However, it is possible, and I would say essential, to adapt these
listening skills and include them as part of your practice with whole groups
of learners or with individuals who are part of a group.
There are very speciﬁc skills that you use as a listener, known as active
listening skills. These include: paraphrasing, reﬂecting feelings, using open
questions, managing silence and clarifying. There are more details on these
in Activity 7.1 later in this chapter. Effective use of these skills requires that
you are fully attentive to the speaker and not distracted by your own
concerns. You need to hear what they are saying and you also need to hear
what they are communicating to you but not necessarily articulating.
Chapter 7

Using these skills with groups can have the same effects as when using them
with individuals:
•
Learners derive great beneﬁt simply from being heard properly;
•
You have a better understanding of the learners’ perspective and can
tailor your material accordingly;
•
You can use listening skills to foster genuinely learner-centred
approaches, where your role is to help learners ﬁnd answers and solutions
independently;
•
Listening helps in building a good relationship. A good relationship
depends on its dialogue, and dialogue in turn depends upon the ability
to truly listen to and understand the perspective of the other person.
The emotionally intelligent teacher will go into a session just as ready to listen
as to talk. What you say in a session should be determined as much by what
the learners say in the session as by what you have planned to say. It is usually
expected by you and by the learners that if they make a comment or ask a
question, you will respond with your expertise. But sometimes your readiness
to jump in with your own analysis or wealth of anecdotes and experiences
can take away from what the learner is actually saying. You can fail to truly
value the learners’ experience and sometimes not even hear correctly what
they have said because of your rush to contribute. Of course, listening skills
do not readily translate into all learning contexts; for example, there are
limited opportunities to use them in a lecture. However, if you are genuinely
seeking to facilitate, you have got to be practised at knowing when to listen
and when to talk.
Good listening is both disciplined and spontaneous. Obviously no response
can be planned in advance (although you may anticipate frequently asked
questions). When you have heard a learner’s comment or question you need
to choose your response very carefully, selecting from your repertoire of 
skills, looking for the one that will best serve you in assisting them to reach
their goals. Being a good listener is a prerequisite to showing you are
responding to people’s feelings (see Chapter 8) and to handling responses
(see Chapter 9).
Most of what is taught on listening skills today has its roots in the work
of Carl Rogers (1902–87). On the basis of his work as a clinical psychologist
in the 1920s, Rogers formulated his theory known as ‘client-centred therapy’.
He held that, if a psychotherapist wanted to assist their client in changing,
the relationship that existed between the therapist and client was more
important than the therapist’s expertise in the type of problem. If the therapist
could exhibit the qualities of genuineness, empathy and acceptance, and if
the client could acknowledge those qualities, then change would occur in the
client (Rogers 1961: 33–4). The role of the therapist was to assist the client
in finding their own solution to whatever problem had brought them to
70 Listening to your learners

therapy by exhibiting the three qualities mentioned above and, in so doing,
fully listen to the client. The listening approach in person-centred counselling
derives from the work of Carl Rogers and is to be found in many listening
skills courses, even if Rogers’s inﬂuence is not always acknowledged.
Rogers soon suggested that what was true in the therapy room could apply
in the classroom too:
If the creation of an atmosphere of acceptance, understanding and respect
is the most effective basis for facilitating the learning which is called
therapy, then might it not be the basis for the learning which is called
education?
(Rogers 1951: 384)
The research conducted to test his principles in education has included 
work by David Aspy and Flora Roebuck. They investigated the impact on
student effectiveness of the teacher who exhibited genuineness, empathy and
acceptance. After assessing 3700 hours of classroom instruction by 550
elementary and secondary schoolteachers, they concluded:
Students learn more and behave better when they receive high levels of
understanding, caring and genuineness, than when they are given low
levels of them. It pays to treat students as sensitive and aware human
beings.
(Aspy and Roebuck 1983: 199; emphasis in original)
Rogers himself was wary of teaching the skills without considering the person
who was using them. He saw that procedures and techniques are less
important than attitudes, as noted in Chapter 1. Like all aspects of emotional
intelligence, developing as an effective listener requires time to practise and
the opportunity for structured reﬂection on your experience.
This chapter continues with activities which give you the opportunity to
begin to explore your use of listening skills as a teacher. If you want to pursue
the development of your listening skills, consider taking a course, rather than
further reading, because of the opportunities for practice and feedback.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 7.1
Using listening skills with groups of learners
This activity helps you identify the extent to which you currently use listening skills,
which are normally used with one person, with groups or with individuals in groups.
Listening to your learners
71

Here is a list of skills and qualities used in active listening. Complete the questionnaire
to establish which of these skills you use when working with a group.
A = I never do this
B = I do this occasionally
C = I do this frequently
A
B
C
Asking open questions



This means asking questions which invite
an answer other than ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
Example: ‘What do you think of the idea 
I have just outlined?’
Paraphrasing



This means repeating to the speaker what they
have just said, possibly changing the words but
retaining the meaning.
Example:
A learner says, ‘I realize now the
relevance of this part of the session.’
You reply by paraphrasing,
‘So the relevance of this
part is now clear.’
Reflecting feelings



This means reﬂecting back to the speaker the feelings
they are conveying to you.
Example:
‘You sound as though you are both
surprised and relieved to hear this.’
Demonstrating empathy



This means showing the speaker that you have an
appreciation of their perspective.
Example:
‘You must be very anxious about
being here today.’
72 Listening to your learners

A
B
C
Managing silence



This means maintaining attention but not speaking
immediately after someone stops speaking.
Example:
A learner says: ‘I think some of our managers
would beneﬁt from coming on this course.’
The teacher does not speak but maintains eye
contact with the learner and perhaps nods or
raises an eyebrow. This gives the learner the
chance to elaborate or for someone else in
the group to respond. The trainer could
continue to communicate non-verbally
through facial expression, posture and
in this way invite comments from others.
Clarifying



This means checking that you have heard accurately what
the speaker has said.
Example:
‘Let me make sure I understand what you are
saying – your main concern is . . .’
Activity 7.2
Ten types of bad listener
Everyday conventions in listening differ from the more disciplined approach which
characterizes active listening. This activity helps you recognize some types of everyday
listening which are unacceptable in the classroom.

DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 7.3
Whose frame of reference?
A prerequisite for responding to feelings expressed by others is the ability to step
outside of our ‘frame of reference’ and into that of the other person. If we can also
communicate to the other person that we are doing this, we are likely to make it
easier for them to explain or express more and for dialogue and understanding to
develop.
Each of the four statements below is given three possible responses. For each response
identify whether it takes the frame of reference of the person who made the statement
(the ‘speaker’) or the frame of reference of the person who responds (the ‘listener’).
For response ‘D’, insert the kind of response you would typically make.
1
Learner to teacher
I’m thinking of giving up the course. I ﬁnd it very hard to ﬁt everything in.
A
So you’re thinking of leaving the course because of the difﬁculties you have in
getting everything done.
B
You’re not giving it a chance.
C
So you’re pushed for time – you should have seen this coming.

I found this course difﬁcult at ﬁrst but now it is very worthwhile.
A
I’m very pleased myself with the group and how they are working.
B
So you’re getting a lot out of it.
C
I wish there were more like you.
D
Comments
1A This reﬂects the speaker’s frame of reference and paraphrases what was said.
1B
This is the listener’s frame of reference; it rushes to a judgement and tells the
speaker that the listener is not ready to listen.
1C This starts with the learners’ frame of reference but moves to an assumption
which may or may not be justiﬁed but almost certainly doesn’t help.
2A A kindly but dismissive response, more about the listener’s need to make the
speaker either feel better or just shut up.
76 Listening to your learners

2B
This takes the speaker’s frame of reference and makes it easier for them to say
more.
2C The listener’s frame of reference and no help at all.
3A An accurate paraphrase of what was said, from the speaker’s frame of reference.
3B
Starts with the speaker’s frame of reference but moves on to satisfying the
listener’s need to reassure them.
3C The listener’s frame of reference.
4A Doesn’t negate what they said but comes from the listener’s frame of reference.
4B
Speaker’s frame of reference.
4C Again, this does not override what they said but is about the listener not the
speaker.
Of course it would be inappropriate not to say bizarre to be perpetually responding
from the frame of reference of others, particularly if all you are doing is repeating back
to them what they have already said. What is important is to ensure that you have
the ability to do this, i.e. to listen fully and to empathize, which enlarges your repertoire
of responses and leads to more effective communication.
Activity 7.4
Analysing a listener’s responses
This activity builds on the three activities above to look at listening in action. It gives
you the opportunity to suggest how to improve this teacher’s listening skills
performance.
At the end of a session, a learner comes up to the teacher. The learner is a part-time
student who has a training responsibility at work. Their exchange goes like this:
1
Learner:
I have thoroughly enjoyed what you’ve done today. It’s been very useful.
2
Teacher:
Thank you.
3
L :
The trouble is, when I get back to work, it’ll be the same old problem.
No matter how hard I try, the team I have just don’t want to know.
They stop me doing anything.
4
T:
That’s very common.
5
L :
It’s frustrating when I know there are better ways of going about things.
6
T:
You shouldn’t let it get to you.
7
L :
I suppose so but everyone else I have spoken with today sounds as
though they are able to use the ideas back at the ranch. It makes me
feel more resigned.
Listening to your learners
77

8
T:
Why do you feel that way?
9
L :
Because . . . well, maybe it is just me.
10
T:
It can’t be.
11
L :
Yes, but a day like this reminds me of how far there is to go to make
it a better environment at work. I sometimes think . . .
12
T:
Have you tried an away day?
13
L :
We considered it but dismissed it.
14
T:
Just going off site for a day can be energizing.
15
L :
I would like to try using the questionnaire from today but I’m anxious
about how it would be received.
16
T:
There’s a good book which tells you how to administer it – here’s the
title.
17
L :
Oh.
18
T:
I hope it goes well.
1
Look critically at the teacher’s responses. Make a note of the lines where you
think the teacher should have done or said something different.
2
For each line that you have chosen, write why you think the teacher should have
done or said something different.
3
For each line you have chosen, write precisely what the teacher should have done
or said differently – what you feel would have been a better (more emotionally
intelligent) response.

Reading and responding to the
feelings of individuals and
groups
This chapter includes the following activities:
8.1
Reviewing your current practice
8.2
Demonstrating group empathy
8.3
How is it for you?
8.4
Reading learners’ non-verbal communication and reﬂecting feelings
8.5
Responding to feelings as well as to problems
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
This book is based on the premise that emotions are bound up with learning,
and so being able to read and respond to your learners’ feelings is a core
component of using emotional intelligence in teaching. There will be times
when learners convey feelings to you, intentionally or otherwise. To use
emotional intelligence in your teaching includes showing that you can read,
acknowledge and respond to these feelings, especially the negative ones.
Indeed, if you have taken the steps suggested in earlier chapters to provide
the right environment, learners will be more likely to express their feelings.
Be ready to attend to this and to have dialogue with your learners that is
about their feelings, to the extent that those feelings are bound up with their
learning. This includes attempting to take account of how they feel even if
they are not necessarily expressing this strongly. Activity 8.2 below,
‘demonstrating group empathy’, is an example of this.
So much of teaching is based on the assumption that the learners are
present cognitively but not otherwise. If you want to be more effective in
your role, such an assumption will be constraining. The whole person is
engaged in learning and you should be addressing, and be ready to relate to,
the whole of the learner. To ignore their feelings is to ignore a signiﬁcant part
of them as a learner. So, the focus of this chapter is an extension of the
listening skills discussed in the previous chapter. To listen fully to someone
Chapter 8

includes listening to facts and feelings alike. Those feelings may be articulated
by the person you are listening to or may be implicit in what they are
communicating to you, unsaid yet still expressed.
What you can achieve through reading and responding to feelings is to let
your learners know that:
•
you recognize that they have feelings;
•
it is okay to express those feelings;
•
you are ready to accept those feelings;
•
you can respond on this level as well as on a cognitive level.
Many of the occasions when teachers claim they have ‘difﬁcult’ learners stem
from the teacher’s inability or reluctance to acknowledge the learner’s feelings.
If it is clear to you that learners are experiencing negative feelings and these
are not attended to, those learners will be using up energy that could instead
be used for learning. There is then a likelihood that their original show of
negative feeling will be compounded by mistrust or resentment towards you
because of the way you failed to handle it. So, acknowledging or failing to
acknowledge feelings will have a signiﬁcant effect on their responsiveness
and readiness to learn. Obviously, it will also affect the emotional environ-
ment in the classroom. How you fail to deal with one learner’s feelings will
send a message to other members of the group and, in turn, affect their
behaviour.
You may think that the classroom is not the place to start talking about
feelings. I certainly would not suggest that you become a counsellor, ready
to deal with the range of feelings an individual has and to assist them with
their personal problems. That is not your job and would be inappropriate
and damaging behaviour, so be sure to have a clear understanding of your
limits in this respect. To teach with emotional intelligence includes having
the ability to deal with your learners’ feelings because by doing so:
•
The learners will feel valued;
•
It helps to develop a fuller relationship with them;
•
It aids their learning;
•
It helps to shape a positive environment.
Activity 8.1 asks you to begin to think about your current practice in reading
and dealing with learners’ feelings. Activities 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 suggest
strategies you can try with learners, while 8.5 is an exercise in picking up on
a learner’s feelings conveyed in writing.
80 Reading and responding to learners’ feelings

INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 8.1
Reviewing your current practice
This is a brief activity which invites you to begin to review what you currently do to
read and respond to the feelings of learners.
Think back to the most recent session you have run. Ask these questions:
1
Was I aware of the overall mood of the group at any point during the session?
2
How did I sense that mood?
3
Did I respond to that mood?
4
Was I aware at any time of the feelings of any individual learner?
5
How did I become aware of those feelings?
6
How did I respond to those feelings?
DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 8.2
Demonstrating group empathy
Empathy means the ability to see the world as it looks to someone else. However, it
is important to remember that while you can have some sense of how another person
is feeling and experiencing, you can never see things in exactly the same way as them.
Simply being empathic will have no impact on the other person unless you demonstrate
your empathy by conveying to them that you have an understanding of how they feel.
Demonstrating your empathy with another can help them feel better, just to know
that someone is in tune with them and understands. It also gives them the opportunity
to ‘correct’ your perception of their feelings if you are ‘wrong’.
You can demonstrate empathy with a group of learners. This means it is possible to
say something to the group that shows that you have a sense of how at least some of
them are feeling at a given point. You can show that you both acknowledge and accept
their feelings. Demonstrating to learners that you are ready and able to see things
from their perspective can greatly increase their responsiveness and readiness to
engage with the session.
Reading and responding to learners’ feelings
81

Here are some examples of group empathy statements:
‘At this stage of the course I suspect most of you will be concerned about the
exam.’
‘From your response to the activity that we did last week, I sense you will be
relieved to know that this week there is no role playing, just discussion groups.’
‘My guess is a number of you will be anxious to start work on how to apply the
mass of information you’ve received so far.’
If you use a statement that acknowledges a negative feeling, remember to be ready to
follow it up with a positive statement. Here is an example.
The teacher says to the learners at the beginning of a one-day professional devel-
opment course:
‘I know some of you have not chosen to be here today and so I imagine some of
you are thinking, “I would rather be getting on with my backlog of work than sitting
here for a day.”’
The teacher continues:
‘So I am keen to ensure we make the best use of your valuable time and that you
gain something useful from today – and I will be checking with you as we go along
to make sure it’s relevant and that you can make use of it.’
Think of a session you have run recently. Write five examples of group empathy
statements that you could have used or did use and, where appropriate, a follow-up
positive statement.
Activity 8.3
How is it for you?
This is an activity that can give reassurance and clariﬁcation to learners, as well as
providing feedback for you on how things are going. It is another technique for
developing dialogue between you and your learners.
When teaching, you may experience sessions in which you cannot tell how the material
is being received by learners. By asking them how they feel and responding
appropriately, you can:
•
provide a welcome break in the session;
•
show that you value how they feel and that you can accept their feelings;
•
receive feedback which might result in you revisiting part of the course or even
modifying what you have planned for the remainder of the session.
82 Reading and responding to learners’ feelings

1
Say to your learners:
‘As I look at your faces, it’s difﬁcult for me to tell what your response is so far.’
2.
Then say:
‘Take a few seconds to think of the one word which best describes how you feel
about what we have covered so far. For example, the word might be “fascinated”,
“confused”, “bored”, “intrigued” – just use whatever word sums it up best for
you. It is okay to say “pass”.’
3.
Hear each person’s word in turn. Don’t encourage them to say more than one
word. Don’t comment on any of their responses, except to acknowledge them
and perhaps say, ‘Thank you’.
4.
When you have all their words, consider your response. Here are some examples
of what they might say and how you might respond:
If they used words such as:
‘fascinated’, ‘intrigued’, ‘excited’, ‘stimulated’, ‘exhilarated’
You could say:
‘Good. In that case I’m sure you’ll really appreciate what comes next.’
If they used words such as:
‘confused’, ‘puzzled’, ‘uncertain’, ‘overwhelmed’
You could say:
‘Could you tell me more about what you have found puzzling?’
If they used words such as:
‘bored’, ‘detached’, ‘not bothered’, ‘it’s okay’, ‘nothing’
You could say:
‘What would you say would make it more interesting for you?’
If they used words such as:
‘interested’, ‘curious’, ‘open-minded’, ‘motivated’
You could say:
‘That’s great. I think you will ﬁnd this next activity very rewarding.’
If they used words such as:
‘frustrated’, ‘impatient’, ‘uncomfortable’
You could say:
‘Could you say what the source of your frustration is?’

Activity 8.4
Reading learners’ non-verbal communication and
reflecting feelings
You can gain a useful sense of the mood of a group of learners by reading their non-
verbal communication. This information gives you another chance to connect with
the group because, on the basis of your reading of their non-verbal communication,
you can reﬂect their feelings. Statements that reﬂect feeling usually start with phrases
like, ‘I sense that . . .’, ‘it seems to me that you feel . . .’. This activity gives a checklist
of non-verbal communication to look out for and asks you to practise how you would
reﬂect the feelings you see. You can use this in a session or you can use it to reﬂect
on a recent session.
1
Take stock of the mood of the group by asking yourself these ﬁve questions. Place
a tick by the most suitable word(s). You may want to add words of your own.
a)
What is the posture of your learners, whether seated or standing?
upright

slouching

open

defensive

b)
What is the direction of their gaze, both when you are talking and when they
are doing activities?
towards you

looking down

looking away

c)
What is the typical facial expression of group members?
engaged

frowning

d)
What is the dominant tone of voice from the group during activities and
question and answer?

e)
How do the learners move in forming small groups and in carrying out
activities?




reluctantly

enthusiastically 
2
Now reﬂect the feelings of your learners:
Here are some suggested responses which attempt to reﬂect their feelings.
If you have ticked:
upright; towards you; smiling; lively; briskly
You could say:
‘There’s a real buzz in the room today. People seem to be ﬁnding 
this very useful. Am I right?’
If you have ticked:
slouching; looking down; blank; tired; slowly
You could say:
‘I guess you are not getting as much from this as usual. It looks 
like I need to bring forward an activity I had planned for later.’
If you have ticked:
defensive; looking away; frowning; resigned; reluctantly
You could say:
‘I sense that some of you are not happy with the session so far. 
Anyone care to comment?’
If you have ticked:
open; towards others; engaged; enquiring; enthusiastic
You could say:
‘I can see there is a great deal of interest in this topic.’
If you have ticked:
upright; towards you; frowning; resigned; slowly
You could say:
‘I am getting mixed messages from you about today’s session.’
Remember, always to be cautious in interpreting body language. For instance, a learner
who is always looking out of the window while you are talking to the class could
indicate to you a lack of attention. Yet, for some learners, looking away can be a useful
strategy for concentrating. Also, take care if your group includes learners from

different cultures. Two learners may exhibit the same gesture or expression but the
intended meaning may be different.
Activity 8.5
Responding to feelings as well as to problems
This activity asks you to put yourself in the position of a teacher who has received an
email from a student. The student, Ellen, is studying part-time on a master’s degree
programme and you are her dissertation supervisor. Having read the email, you will
prepare for a tutorial with her next week. When you meet, there will be obvious
points of information and guidance to offer Ellen, but ﬁrst, it is important to recognize
what feelings Ellen is expressing in her message and to acknowledge them. This is
necessary as they may well be what is most important for her and if you ignore them
it will affect the quality of communication in your tutorial with Ellen. She will be more
likely to hear and more ready to learn if you have clearly responded to the emotional
content of her email ﬁrst.
Here is the email:
I am getting in touch as promised, in advance of our tutorial scheduled for next
week, to bring you up to date. I’ve had the questionnaires back now and I was
pleased at the number who returned them. But at ﬁrst glance they don’t seem to
be saying what I hoped they would which is a worry. Actually I’m at a loss as to
how to collate the data, both qualitative and quantitative. I know we talked about
it and it seemed clear then but I’d like some guidance. I’ve drafted how I think I
should approach the interviews. Mind you it might be irrelevant because my boss
is going back on what she said. We agreed I could have a day a fortnight to do this,
especially the interviews, but now she says that won’t be possible, at least not
before Christmas. She’s so unreliable!! I don’t see now how I can do the follow-
up interviews and that puts my schedule right behind. I just can’t see how it’s going
to happen. What with some things going on at home too it’s all a bit overwhelming.
Anyway see you Monday, Ellen.
Remember, you are conﬁdent about the technical advice you need to give Ellen on
her dissertation, but in preparing for your meeting with her ask yourself:
1
What feelings are conveyed by Ellen in her email?
2
How will you acknowledge and deal with these feelings when you meet, before
going further and discussing her problems with her studies?

Responding to learners’
comments and questions
This chapter includes the following activities:
9.1
Acceptant responses
9.2
Prefacing your response
9.3
Taking control of transactions
9.4
Responding to provocative comments
9.5
Your use of language in responses
9.6
Balancing content and style in your written responses
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
Every time a learner makes a comment or asks a question is an opportunity
for you to use emotional intelligence in the way you respond. Depending on
who they are and the nature of what they say, you may have the chance to:
•
affect how they feel about being in that session;
•
determine if and how they will ever speak again in the session;
•
inﬂuence how they feel about themselves as learners;
•
inﬂuence how they view you;
•
inﬂuence how the rest of the group view you and the session;
•
conﬁrm the kind of relationship you have with your learners.
If handled well, your response can:
•
improve the motivation of the individual and other learners;
•
affect the emotional environment for the better;
•
clarify what kinds of questions or comments from learners are
acceptable;
•
show the learners that you value their responses;
•
show the learners that you are listening.
Chapter 9

Obviously you cannot plan for dealing with responses; if you had to stop to
deliberate each response you make in terms of all of the above factors, you
would be incapable of responding normally. However, the significance of
these exchanges between you and your learners, beyond the simple exchange
of information, is very easy to underestimate. How you respond could be the
most obvious indicator to your learners of how you view them.
In formulating your response, it is useful to think on two levels – the
affective and the cognitive. The cognitive is one on which we are accustomed
to responding as teachers. You can decide to inform, clarify, agree, expand
or correct; in other words, give a response to do with the intellect. You can
seek to develop the learner’s train of thought by asking a question in response,
inviting others to respond, making a link with what has been said before and
so on.
The affective level means asking yourself if you wish to have an effect on
the feelings of the questioner (and others). Should you attempt to make them
feel respected, valued, enthused, belittled, dismissed or humiliated? It is likely
you will have an effect regardless – it is rarely possible to avoid having any
affective impact. If you respond cognitively, without taking into account your
affective impact, then there is the possibility of causing problems. Your
cognitive response may be accurate while your affective response may be
damaging or clumsy.
One common way to seek a positive affective impact is to praise. However,
praise should be used with caution; a better goal in terms of emotional
intelligence is to be non-judgemental which means neither to condemn nor
to praise. The point about being non-judgemental is that when you respond
to a learner, you do not encourage them to depend on your judgement of
their contribution and their success. Part of your role is to assist them in
making their own judgements about their learning. Eric Jensen cites research
by both Alﬁe Kohn and Roy Baumeister about the possible negative effects
of too much praise. He concludes, ‘The most striking and permanent
interpretation of a positive judgement is that it is still a judgement’ (Jensen
1995: 268). Creating too much learner dependency on your judgements
makes for an emotionally unhealthy relationship between you and the
learners. Feedback and encouragement, from you or from the learners’ peers,
are more useful.
Hopefully, every question or comment from a learner is made in good faith
and you can take it at face value. However, there is every chance that learners
will, through what they say and how they say it, invite you to respond in a
particular way that suits their purposes. Michael Maynard identiﬁes a range
of examples of difﬁcult learners (Maynard 2003): the Attacker, the Sniper,
the Rebel, the Incredible Sulk and so on. They may or may not be aware of
what they are doing but you have to be. You also have to gauge your response
carefully with an eye to its effect on them, on the rest of the group, on you
88 Responding to learners’ comments and queries

and on the purpose of the session. For example, the learner says, ‘Have we
really got to complete this task?’ (‘really’ said in a pleading tone). This is
more than a straightforward question. It is inviting you to make an indulgent
response such as ‘Well, not if you don’t want to’ or ‘Well, do what you can,
it doesn’t matter if you don’t do it all’. There are two concepts, which have
their origin in Transactional Analysis (known as TA, see Chapter 2), which
are very useful for understanding what is going on in this example and for
guiding us in how to respond. They are called ‘personal styles’ (or ‘ego-states’)
and ‘transactions’. Essentially the learner is, probably unconsciously, trying
to provoke you into behaving in a certain way which they will feel more
comfortable with. They are trying to call the shots in the relationship you
have with them. You need to be aware of this possibility and to give the
response you want to and take control of the transactions (see Activity 9.3).
The same principles about responding to learners apply if you have to give
feedback on an assessment, whether it is a presentation or a written assign-
ment. Of course, you are obliged to give the cognitive response, probably
including diagnosis, guidance and advice. But you can provide the same
cognitive response while varying your affective response greatly. In other
words, it’s not just what you say, but how you say it. And how you say it
will determine whether your recipient, your learner, truly hears what you
say. Activity 9.6 gives the opportunity to reshape the affective message in
some written feedback.
Almost all of the remainder of this chapter offers suggestions on how to
make the most of your responses to learners. Before that, in Investigating
your practice, there are a few questions on how you currently handle learners’
questions and comments.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
The following are useful questions to ask in appraising your current practice
in responding to learners.
1
How far do I take note of the likely affective impact of my responses to
learners’ questions and comments?
2
Do I use my responses to achieve anything more than providing
information or developing learners’ understanding?
3
Am I aware of any learner comments or questions which intend an
additional meaning, perhaps inviting me to respond in a particular way?
Responding to learners’ comments and queries
89

DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 9.1
Acceptant responses
When a learner asks a question or makes a comment, you may or may not agree with
what they say, but it is important to make an acceptant response, i.e. a response which,
at the very least, acknowledges and doesn’t deny the point of view or feeling that the
learner has expressed.
You can do either one or both of two things to make an acceptant response.
1
You can acknowledge that that is how the learner thinks or feels:
‘That’s perfectly understandable at this point.’
‘That’s a very common response from learners when they hear that. . . .’
2
You can invite the learner to elaborate and give more information or clarify what
they are saying:
‘Tell me more.’
‘What’s the nature of your confusion?’
This activity helps you to prepare acceptant responses by ﬁrst asking you to word the
response you should not make, i.e. a non-acceptant response.
Here are three examples of comments from learners, each followed by a non-
acceptant response, then by an acceptant response.
90 Responding to learners’ comments and queries
The learner says

rewarding.’

Here are six more learner comments. Take each in turn and create your own example
of a non-acceptant response (most people usually ﬁnd this easier to do!) and then an
example of an acceptant response.
Activity 9.2
Prefacing your response
This activity looks at how you might make more of any response you give to a learner.
Even if your response to a learner’s question or comment is straightforward, there is
always the opportunity to preface it with a remark intended to make the learner feel
good and/or to add to the positive emotional environment. However, be wary of using
any such phrase if you do not mean it; avoid the ‘have a nice day’ syndrome, where
there is no congruence between what you say and how you feel.

Activity 9.3
Taking control of transactions
The idea of personal styles and transactions derives from Transactional Analysis (see
Activity 2.3). Here’s a reminder of example behaviours from each of the ﬁve personal
styles:
1
Controlling Parent – directing, ﬁrm
2
Nurturing Parent – caring, reassuring
3
Adult – problem solving, logical
4
Natural Child – spontaneous, creative, fun-loving
5
Adapted Child – compliant, polite or rebellious, sulking
Looking at how personal styles ‘transact’ with each other provides a framework that
we can use to review how we communicate with others. Unconsciously, we may 
be ‘flipped’ into a response that is triggered by what others say. More productive
exchanges, certainly those more suitable for learning, can come about if we bring these
92 Responding to learners’ comments and queries

transactions into our consciousness and take some control over them. This activity
gives some examples of how you might be provoked into a particular personal style
by learners and how you can rehearse responses which do not fuel unproductive
transactions. In order to remain in control and to create transactions which help
learning, it is useful to be able to determine the most suitable personal style in which
to respond.
Example
The learner says:
‘We don’t really need to do every part of this activity, do we?’
This question comes from the rebellious, sulking part of their Adapted Child. It might
trigger an unconscious response from your Nurturing Parent (‘No, that’s OK.’) or
Controlling Parent (‘That’s not helpful. Please make sure you do all of the task.’). In
either case, because you have addressed their Adapted Child, they will see no reason
to change behaviour. They will have been encouraged to look to you to participate in
more of the Adapted Child–Controlling/Nurturing Parent transactions which they crave,
and so will push you into the Controlling/Nurturing Parent role.
Exert more control by ignoring the Adapted Child in your learner and addressing their
Adult from your Adult:
‘Yes. You’ve got 30 minutes, which is how long it normally takes.’
For each of the following learner statements, phrase a response from the ego-state
indicated:
1
Learner: ‘These activities you get us to do take up far too much time. Don’t you think 
you should take your responsibilities more seriously and just give us the facts?’
This comes from Controlling Parent, inviting a response from your Adapted Child.
Make a response from your Adult to their Adult.
2
Learner: ‘Don’t be concerned about what x (learner) said to you earlier. He’s a bit 
prickly but we all like you and what you are doing.’
This comes from Nurturing Parent, inviting a response from your Natural Child or
Adapted Child.
Make a response from your Adult to their Adult.
Responding to learners’ comments and queries
93

3
Learner: ‘Don’t you think there’s too much jargon and psychobabble in all of this?’
This looks like a judgement coming from Controlling Parent, probably inviting a
response from your Controlling Parent.
Make a response from your Adult to their Adult.
Your transactions as a teacher do not always have to be Adult–Adult. Other
transactions can be appropriate. For example, Controlling Parent–Adapted Child is
suitable when you need to direct your learners. There may be occasions when you
join your learners in humour or in creative problem-solving which could be seen as
Natural Child–Natural Child. The key is that you need to be in control of which ever
personal style you inhabit, adept at switching your personal style to suit the purpose
and not be forced into a personal style by learner behaviour.
Activity 9.4
Responding to provocative comments
This activity gives you the chance to consider where some tempting immediate
responses to provocative comments from learners might lead. There is also the
opportunity to imagine what a more constructive response might achieve.
During the session, a learner says to you:
‘I’m only here on sufferance you know.’
Here are ﬁve possible replies that you may feel like giving but which are likely to be
ultimately unproductive.
1
‘That’s tough. Let’s get on.’
What feeling(s) might this provoke in the learner?
What might they say next (to you, to another learner and/or to themselves)?
Where do you think that will lead?
2
Silence: with clenched teeth, big sigh, resigned look.
What feeling(s) might this provoke in the learner?
What might they say next (to you, to another learner and/or to themselves)?
Where do you think that will lead?
3
‘I know, but please let me carry on.’
What feeling(s) might this provoke in the learner?
94 Responding to learners’ comments and queries

What might they say next (to you, to another learner and/or to themselves)?
Where do you think that will lead?
4
‘Well, leave now then.’
What feeling(s) might this provoke in the learner?
What might they say next (to you, to another learner and/or to themselves)?
Where do you think that will lead?
5
‘Oh really?’ (genuine concern) ‘What would you like me to do?’
What feeling(s) might this provoke in the learner?
What might they say next (to you, to another learner and/or to themselves)?
Where do you think that will lead?
Here are some further possible replies, which are more emotionally intelligent and
more likely to lead to a productive outcome. For each one, draft up to ﬁve or six lines
of exchange that might follow between the learner and the teacher, with the teacher
keeping the focus on helpful responses.

Activity 9.5
Your use of language in responses
As noted in Chapter 3, the language you use with learners has an effect on their
learning state. Even the simplest of questions asked by learners gives you a chance to
use positive language in your response and assist the development of a learning state.
This activity asks you create responses using positive language.
96 Responding to learners’ comments and queries

Each example below gives a learner comment or question and a routine response
from the teacher. Can you word a teacher response which makes more positive use
of language, one which blends the cognitively useful with the affectively positive?
Example
Learner:
Are there any books I could read about this?
Teacher response:
Getting on at Work will do for the basics.
Alternative (more
Yes I recommend Getting on at Work which is an excellent 
positive) teacher:
introduction and covers all of the key points. Let me know if you
want any more titles.
Produce your own alternative, more positive responses to the examples below, paying
particular attention to the language that you use:

Are there any follow-up courses to this?
Teacher response:
I have heard the one at the local college is OK.
Alternative teacher
response:
Learner:
Would you recommend this method for team-building?

Activity 9.6
Balancing content and style in your written
responses
You can convey more than just the intended meaning of words when giving feedback.
This activity asks you to improve some written feedback where the tone of the
language could have a negative impact which will interfere with how the content will
be received by the recipient.
Here is a teacher’s written feedback on an undergraduate essay in education studies.
How would you rewrite the feedback, retaining the substance, but changing the words
in order to have a less negative impact on the recipient?
The main problem with this essay is that you are less than clear about the
distinction between behaviourism and constructivism. You have identiﬁed some of
the differences (as I’ve noted in your text) but I’m not convinced you truly grasp
what they are fundamentally about. I suppose that the course outline you suggest
does embody a constructivist approach but you need to spell out the connections
between theory and practice more. A lot of the problems stem from your clumsy
phraseology – again I’ve noted (some) examples in the text – and what is either a
faulty spellchecker or lack of proofreading. Only the ﬁrst two arguments you offer
have any bearing on the applicability of these theories in HE; the remaining three
are not relevant. This is surprising in light of the amount of reading your references
suggest you have done. The reference to Ramsden has the wrong date.

Developing self-awareness as 
a teacher
This chapter includes the following activities:
10.1 Your stroking pattern
10.2 Knowing yourself as a teacher
10.3 What shapes your values and attitudes in teaching?
10.4 Drivers
10.5 Increasing the ﬂow of information about yourself
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
This chapter differs from the preceding chapters in that it does not suggest
strategies for use with learners. Instead, it focuses on the process of you
becoming more self-aware as a teacher. Self-awareness is at the heart of being
emotionally intelligent and is a prerequisite for making sure that the strategies
suggested in earlier chapters are successful.
Daniel Goleman names self-awareness as the first of his five emotional 
and social competencies (Goleman 1998: 318). It is the basis for the other
competencies, such as self-regulation and empathy. Goleman defines it as
‘knowing what we are feeling in the moment, and using those preferences to
guide our decision making; having a realistic assessment of our own abilities
and a well-grounded sense of self-conﬁdence’ (ibid.). I suggest three levels on
which it is useful to develop self-awareness as a teacher. These are:
1
awareness of your feelings at any one moment in relation to teaching;
2
awareness of your values and attitudes as a teacher;
3
awareness of your teacher behaviours and how others see them.
First, being aware of your feelings at any one time is especially signiﬁcant for
using emotional intelligence in your teaching. You cannot begin to tune in
to the feelings of others until you can tune into your own. Your ability to
Chapter 10

empathize and to accept how others feel depends on how far you can, ﬁrst of
all, know and accept yourself and your feelings. Even if you are accustomed
to recognizing and articulating your feelings, you may still be wondering how
far to go with this in the context of your work as a teacher. You may have
absorbed the message that your expertise in self-awareness does not have a
place in the classroom. Yet, awareness of your feelings as a teacher is a
prerequisite not just for using emotional intelligence in the classroom, but
also for your own learning and development. Teachers are encouraged to
learn through reﬂection, to become reﬂective practitioners. Attending to your
feelings is an essential component of the process of engaging in successful
reﬂective learning.
Second, you need to be aware of your character, in particular your values
and attitudes. The view of teaching adopted in this book lays great emphasis
on the relationship between you and your learners. This was touched upon
most obviously in Chapter 2. But how you relate to your learners is just one
aspect of how you relate to others generally. Being effective as a teacher
entails you ‘knowing’ your students to some extent, but you cannot ‘know’
others until you have begun to know yourself. Parker J. Palmer writes
eloquently on the importance of self-knowledge as a teacher. It is the theme
of his book, The Courage to Teach. He says, ‘the more familiar we become
with our inner terrain, the more surefooted our teaching – and living –
becomes’ (Palmer 1998: 5). He goes on to assert, ‘knowing myself is as crucial
to good teaching as knowing my students and my subject’ (ibid.: 2).
The third signiﬁcant strand of self-awareness is more tangible than the other
two as it concerns your visible behaviours. This includes your mannerisms,
habits, the way you talk, your non-verbal communication and so on. In other
words, all those things others can see and hear and that you may be aware
of to a greater or lesser extent. This awareness is important because if you
are seeking to inﬂuence your learners’ readiness to learn and their learning
state, you will want to know how they perceive you and what effect this has
on them.
Some teachers express an objection to the idea of emphasizing self-
awareness in their work. They feel that it is inappropriate and can turn into
an unhealthy self-obsession. It is true that while it is necessary to enquire
about yourself, you must take care not to lose sight of the purpose of the
enquiry. It is important to do it in order to understand yourself and how you
relate to others in order to improve those relationships. You need to ensure
that it does not become indulgent, failing to lead to any productive change.
To develop self-awareness of your feelings can be a tough task. It requires
honesty on your part. There is a tendency to tune into how you think you
should be feeling, the kind of character you think you ought to be and to
block out less attractive emotions and characteristics. What is required is a
‘nonreactive, nonjudgemental attention to inner states’ (Goleman 1996: 47).
Being able to recognize, label and accept your feelings provides the basis for
100 Developing self-awareness as a teacher

moving on to discuss and understand feelings. Key things to remember in
becoming aware of your feelings are:
•
be as truthful to yourself as you can;
•
initially, do not rush to explain or justify, just focus on expressing and
recognizing the feelings;
•
ﬁnd a suitable time and place for this exploration – you might choose to
call on a supportive friend;
•
if you can, accept what you discover about yourself, without leaping to
judge it.
This process is not something that comes automatically to everyone. The
culture you grew up in and, in particular, family expectations will have a
great influence on the extent to which you are ready for this kind of self-
awareness. For instance, if you come from a family where it was seen as a
sign of weakness to express feelings then you may not be ready to recognize
that you have feelings, let alone to articulate them and work with them.
When you start to develop awareness of yourself at the other levels – your
values and attitudes and your behaviours – hopefully the process of discovery
should not be so challenging. Nonetheless, it may still prove difﬁcult to accept
what you discover.
This chapter and the next four chapters are about aspects of self-awareness.
The ﬁrst four activities ask very speciﬁc questions to help you ﬁnd out more
about your character and behaviour. The final activity suggests a simple
framework for expanding your degree of self-awareness.
This aspect of professional development differs from the conventional in
two ways. First, it is never ending. The quest for self-knowledge is perpetual
because the self that you are is always shifting – it is not ﬁxed. Carl Rogers’s
classic work, On Becoming a Person, was titled thus because he saw us as
always in a state of ‘becoming’. The activities in this chapter are certainly
not comprehensive in investigating your feelings, character and behaviour,
and it would be foolish to pretend that this is possible. They are intended as
examples of the process of developing self-awareness. Second, this involves
development of you as a person. It is not possible to separate the person at
work from the person at home and elsewhere. While the focus for the
activities is work, the outcomes of developing self-awareness cannot be
conﬁned to the workplace.

INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 10.1
Your stroking pattern
Like ‘personal styles’ in activities 2.3 and 9.3, the concept of ‘strokes’ has its origins
in Transactional Analysis (TA). A stroke is a ‘unit of recognition’, meaning anything
you do, verbally or non-verbally, to acknowledge the existence of another. That is,
speaking to someone or communicating with them by, for instance, a nod, a smile or
even a frown. We all need strokes of some kind to survive and we do tend to seek
out certain kinds of strokes and sometimes to reject others that are offered. Equally,
of course, we have the opportunity to give or to withhold strokes from others. This
activity helps you to begin to compile a stroking pattern for yourself as a teacher. You
can then consider changing your pattern, if it is counter-productive to good teaching
and a positive emotional environment.
This is a way to record your stroking pattern with a group of learners:
A positive stroke invites the person to whom it is offered to feel ‘OK’ about
themselves and others. For example, ‘That is a very useful question you have just
asked.’
A negative stroke invites the person to whom it is offered to feel ‘not OK’ about
themselves and others. For example, ‘Don’t ask such stupid questions!’ When an
opportunity arises for you to give a stroke, you can give it or refuse to give it, i.e.
withhold it.
For this activity, you need to monitor, during a teaching session, the kind of strokes
you give or withhold. After the session, complete the questionnaire below.

103

When someone else gives you a stroke, you can accept it, or you can discount it. For
instance, a learner says to you:
‘The material on that handout is very clearly laid out.’
You can accept: ‘Thank you.’ Or you can discount:
‘Oh, it was the software I used; it does everything for me.’
Look back at your session again. Remember examples of strokes being given to you
and for each one, ask:
•
Was it positive or negative?
•
Did I accept it or discount it?
You have now begun to build up your stroking pattern, which shows how you give
and withhold, accept and discount strokes, both positive and negative. This pattern
can affect your relationships with others. For example, if you continually discount
positive strokes offered, others may cease to try to offer them, anticipating your
response.
Consider whether you would like to change your pattern. For example, you may want
to reduce the amount of negative strokes you give, or accept more of the positive
strokes you are offered. Normally, if you succeed in changing one part of your stroking
pattern it will have an effect on another. If you put more energy into giving positive
strokes, you will spend less time giving negative ones.
Record which part(s) of your pattern you plan to change and how. For example, ‘I
plan to accept more of the positive strokes I am offered’.
Activity 10.2
Knowing yourself as a teacher
This activity invites you to consider how others see you as a teacher. While the task
may appear straightforward, you may ﬁnd some of the sentences difﬁcult to complete.
Complete the following sentences in relation to yourself as a teacher:
My most common mannerism is
The phrase I most commonly use is
Learners are most likely to leave my session feeling
My greatest skill as a teacher is
A skill as a teacher that I could handle better is
104 Developing self-awareness as a teacher

The quality I display that learners respond to best is
I respond best to learners who
If there is one thing I do too much of, it is
If there is one thing I could do more of, it is
Learners ﬁnd my manner predominantly
If you have the opportunity, consider asking a colleague or a group of learners whom
you know particularly well if they have ﬁve minutes to complete these sentences in
relation to you as a teacher. You will then be able to compare your perception with
theirs, and hopefully learn about the accuracy of your self-awareness.
Activity 10.3
What shapes your values and attitudes in
teaching?
Part of the make-up of our character as a teacher is our set of values and attitudes.
These are not necessarily ﬁxed and one way to get more in tune with ourselves is to
clarify what these values are, and then to look at where they originated and how they
have changed.
Here are 12 characteristics that can be associated with teachers. Rank them 1–12 in
order of importance to you.

Activity 10.4
Drivers
The concept of ‘drivers’ is another which has its origins in Transactional Analysis (see
Chapter 2). It suggests that on occasion we are unconsciously acting in response to
messages we picked up in early childhood. For instance, we may have understood
from our parents or whoever was signiﬁcant in our upbringing that we were ‘okay’
as long as we hurried up. The result is that we engage in ‘Hurry Up’ behaviours, but
we do it unknowingly. We are driven to ‘Hurry Up’, which means that we display both
the positive sides and the drawbacks of ‘Hurry Up’ behaviours. If we could develop
106 Developing self-awareness as a teacher

awareness of this we might be able to control our drive to ‘Hurry Up’, recognizing
that it does not always result in appropriate behaviours but that on occasion it gives
us some strengths which can be useful. This applies as much in the teaching context
as in any other.
There are ﬁve such drivers:
1
Be Perfect;
2
Please Others;
3
Try Hard;
4
Be Strong;
5
Hurry Up.
Here are some characteristics of each driver:
Be Perfect
Pays attention to detail; well organized; prepares thoroughly; presents written work
well; can lose sight of the big picture; can be seen as irritating.
Please Others
Good team member; empathetic; looks for harmony; supportive of others; reluctant
to challenge; can take on too much work through not saying no.
Try Hard
Enthusiastic; thorough; energetic; likely to lose interest too soon; can make too much
of a small task.
Be Strong
Calm; reliable; dutiful; good under pressure; doesn’t ask for help and gets overloaded;
hard to get to know well.
Hurry Up
Gets through a lot of work; efﬁcient; good at short deadlines; makes mistakes in haste;
can be seen to be impatient.
For each statement below, consider it in relation to you as a teacher and decide

behaviours when it is useful and appropriate or just compulsively and indiscriminately?

to make the most of your years of practice in that area. You can read more on drivers,
under the alternative description of ‘working styles’, in Transactional Analysis for Trainers
by Julie Hay, pp 105–24.
DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 10.5
Increasing the flow of information about yourself
You can improve communication by increasing the amount of information about
yourself that is deliberately exchanged between you and your learners.
This activity asks you to explore the unknown parts of yourself – that is, the parts
that you are aware of but are unknown to others and the parts that others know of
but are unknown to you. It is a starting point for planning for more open
communication in the following ways:
•
offering information about your behaviours, thoughts, feelings and values to
learners so that they have a fuller picture of you and less room for misinterpreting
you;
•
seeking feedback from learners about yourself so that you can have a fuller picture
of yourself.
1
List things about yourself that are known to you but not to your learners. These
might include interests, background, the area you live in, feelings about a session,
your views on the session topic, your current working situation.
2
Choose from the list one or more items that you would feel comfortable revealing
to a group of learners, and which would not feel inappropriate to reveal.
3
Plan for how you will reveal it or them to the group.
4
Now consider what aspects of yourself might be known to learners but not to
you – what they pick up about you from what they see and hear of you.
5
Plan for a way to ask for some feedback on this from learners. For example,
include a question on your feedback sheet:
‘In what aspects of presentation could the teacher improve?’
You might need to make it known that comments on any aspect will be welcome,
as long as they are intended constructively. Examples might include, ‘Please don’t
pace around so much, it is distracting’ or ‘Are you aware that you end most
sentences with “right”?’
110 Developing self-awareness as a teacher

Recognizing your prejudices
and preferences
This chapter includes the following activities:
11.1 First impressions
11.2 Your prejudices and preferences
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
Self-awareness is an integral part of emotional intelligence, and one of the
most difficult aspects of developing self-awareness is to confront your
prejudices. The swift reaction of most teachers when asked if they have any
prejudices towards others would be to say that they treat all equally.
However, it is impossible to be unbiased and we are all tempted to categorize
others. This can be on the basis of gender, accent, age, appearance and so
on. Prejudices distort our understanding of others. To assume a set of
characteristics based on one factor means that you will be less able to assess
accurately who that person is. In addition to these assumed characteristics
that derive from prejudice, you may have quite legitimate preferences in terms
of which types of learners you prefer to work with. For example, you may
have preferences for learners when you perceive that their values or attitudes
match your own.
Imagine that you have two new groups of learners for the same subject.
The ﬁrst group comprises people in the age range 35 to 50 and the second
consists of 16/17-year-olds. You need to ask yourself:
•
Will you treat them differently in any way? If your answer is yes, in what
way?
•
What are your reasons for treating them differently?
•
Most importantly, what is your evidence for treating them differently?
•
How reliable is that evidence?
Chapter 11

If you do tend to treat some ‘types’ of learner differently from others, it is
always worth scrutinizing the validity of your reasons for doing so.
As a teacher, if you treat learners differently on the basis of these prefer-
ences and prejudices, you will be assuming different learning characteristics
or abilities. You will invariably ﬁnd evidence to support your assumptions,
whether they are right or wrong. For instance, if you have an older learner
and assume they will experience some difﬁculty, you are likely to interpret
their response in terms of difﬁculty when you would treat the same response
from another differently. In addition, your behaviour towards the learners
can affect them in such a way as to reinforce your assumptions, so that you
may actually unconsciously encourage them to experience difﬁculty. Your
perception becomes a self-fulﬁlling prophecy. The ‘halo’ effect reinforces the
initial positive impression you have of someone, while the ‘nimbus’ effect
reinforces your original negative impression. You will also inﬂuence the way
that learner responds to you.
You may find that you put more energy into your responses to certain
learners because they have triggered a feeling in you, positive or negative,
that is not related to their ability or their readiness to learn. For example, I
have seen a teacher respond strongly after inferring that a particular learner
had a political viewpoint opposed to theirs. The teacher devoted a great deal
of time to negating what that learner had to offer. There was no direct
connection between the subject being taught and politics. The teacher’s
response was not helpful for that learner nor for the rest of the group. This
was an example of the strong feelings of the teacher overriding their fairness
and effectiveness.
So, the emotionally intelligent approach begins by seeking to become 
aware of your prejudices. Then you may be better equipped to spot the
learners who are likely to provoke strong responses in you, favourable or
unfavourable. Once you recognize that you may be contributing to unhelpful
interactions, that will hopefully give you the motivation to review and change
your way of communicating in order to avoid similar problems in the future.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 11.1
First impressions
A group whom you have not met before is assembling for the session. As you look
around, you see that the group includes these ﬁve people:
•
younger female, smiling, upright, attentive;
•
older male, arms crossed, looking irritable;
•
younger male, looking tired, slumped;
112 Recognizing your prejudices and preferences 

•
older female, looking agitated and tense;
•
older female, quizzical, stern.
Picture each of them in turn and for each one, answer these questions:
1
What feelings does the person’s appearance arouse in you?
2
What word best describes the behaviour you anticipate from this person as a
learner?
3
What must you say to yourself to ensure you do not let your immediate
impressions override your effectiveness as a teacher?
4
What strategies can you adopt to ensure this?

DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
The two activities in this chapter have introduced you to the initial steps you
need to take in dealing with the effects of your prejudices and preferences as
a teacher. They are:
1
Become aware of your prejudices and preferences.
2
Identify exactly how they might distort your ability to understand others
and to help them learn.
The two steps you must then take are:
3
Make a conscious decision to set your prejudices and preferences aside.
4
If that is not possible, then consciously try to minimize or eradicate their
inﬂuence on your teaching.
You may ﬁnd it useful to monitor your responses in a particular session. Do
you ﬁnd that you are paying more attention to some learners than to others?
If so, what is the cause of that? Is it because of assumptions you are making
based on one factor, for example, age or gender? Plan for speciﬁc behaviours
in future which will help you eradicate this bias. For example, you might
resolve in the next session with this group to speak ﬁrst to the person you
have been ignoring this time. This type of activity is well suited to the format
of the reﬂective diary as outlined in Activity 15.4.
114 Recognizing your prejudices and preferences 

Your non-verbal
communication
This chapter includes the following activities:
12.1 Reﬂecting on your non-verbal communication
12.2 Experimenting with your posture
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
One potent way in which you communicate with your learners is through
non-verbal communication. This includes your facial expressions, your
posture, what you do with your arms, hands and so on. It also includes the
sound of your voice. To teach with emotional intelligence demands an
awareness of your non-verbal communication, as this can greatly inﬂuence
how your learners are feeling. Unfortunately, all too often we are unaware
of exactly what we are communicating. For learners, too, the effect of your
non-verbal communication may be unconscious but that doesn’t make it any
the less signiﬁcant.
Everyone is accustomed to reading non-verbal communication at some
level, even if they are doing it unconsciously. Appearance and non-verbal
communication are often all you have to go on when you ﬁrst meet someone
new which makes those first few minutes very important. If you form an
initial impression of someone based on their non-verbal communication, then
you may be inclined to interpret what they say or do afterwards in those
terms. Even if your learners’ reading of your non-verbal communication is
inaccurate, it is still important because it influences their response and
behaviour. If the non-verbal communication message you are giving is at
odds with what you are saying, the non-verbal message is usually perceived
as more trustworthy.
Your non-verbal communication is sending messages to learners and is
inﬂuencing their response to you and to the session – it is another aspect of
your communication which cannot fail to have an effect. The implication of
Chapter 12

this is quite alarming. For example, you have prepared a brilliant talk or
lecture which draws on your expert knowledge and uses an excellent set of
slides but your non-verbal communication, which says you are anxious and
distracted, is what your learners will register most strongly.
Of course, you cannot determine the effect your non-verbal communication
is going to have on learners – they are individuals and will not all respond
in the same way. Inaccurate readings of your non-verbal communication may
persist. For example, you may fold your arms across your chest because you
feel more comfortable or because you are cold. However, it will still convey
to some learners that you are being defensive. Any cultural differences
between you and the students will also play a large part. For example, your
smile may have alternative interpretations among the group of learners,
depending on each individual’s cultural inﬂuences.
Consider the following few examples of non-verbal communication and
ask how far you think you are already aware of them when you teach. Which
of them do you do, and how frequently?
•
Hands clasped in your lap
•
Playing with a ring on your ﬁnger
•
Fiddling with an object, e.g. ﬂip-chart marker
•
Adjusting your glasses; pushing your hair back
Non-verbal communication extends to your facial expressions. We all have
a natural facial expression – do you know what yours is? Whenever I look at
a group of learners, there will be that mix of bright, cheery, welcoming faces
and others that are just glum. One potential problem is when your expression
is not congruent with your mood. Most importantly, if your natural
expression is, for example, miserable, even when you feel at one with the
world, those on the receiving end of your stare will see ‘miserable’ and, unless
they know you quite well, respond appropriately to this apparent expression
of feeling. The same applies to the tone and expression of your voice. Can
you say whether yours is light or heavy, hesitant or frantic, harsh or soft?
Have you ever thought what you would want your non-verbal communi-
cation to be conveying to your learners? Do you want to come across as:
•
conﬁdent?
•
authoritative?
•
open?
•
approachable?
•
enthusiastic?
•
all of the above?
Does your current non-verbal communication convey this? Too often we are
not sending out the message we would like to. Our real feelings ‘leak’ out
116 Your non-verbal communication

and learners can pick up on our uncertainty, anxiety, impatience and all of
those other feelings that we may not want to be known or, indeed, even be
aware of ourselves.
It is reasonable at this point to object and say, ‘I would prefer my non-verbal
communication to be natural, not false.’ Becoming too self-aware will be
counter-productive, but just as you exercise some control over what you say
verbally to a group, so you should be alert to the non-verbal communication
you are using. The goal is to strike a balance between being disciplined about
your non-verbal communication, exercising some control over it while, at
the same time, being natural.
The activities that follow are intended to help you address the key questions
about non-verbal communication:
•
Do I know what my non-verbal communication is like?
•
Can I guess at its impact?
•
What impact would I like it to have?
•
Would I like to modify it and, if so, in what way?
•
How will I do that?
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 12.1
Reflecting on your non-verbal communication
You can never really know how others see you, but a video recording can be a very
useful device for getting some idea of what others see. This activity suggests how you
can make the most of even a brief recording of you with a group of learners. Of course,
if you do make a recording you will need to reassure the group of its purpose and
that they are in no way being observed or assessed themselves.
Step 1
Make a video recording of yourself teaching for at least ten minutes.
Step 2
As soon as possible after making the recording, watch it with the sound turned down.
For each of the six items in the list that follows, answer these three questions:
•
What do you observe?
•
What does that say about your state of mind at that time?
•
What effect does this have on your audience?
1
Where your gaze is directed;
Your non-verbal communication
117

2
What you do with your hands;
3
Your posture;
4
Your facial expression;
5
How, where and how often you move;
6
Any noticeable physical traits.
Step 3
Now watch the recording again with the sound turned up. Try to ignore the content
of what you are saying and listen to the tone and intonation of your voice as though
you had never heard it before. Describe it.
Step 4
Consider these questions:
•
How much control are you exerting over these components of non-verbal
communication?
•
Is there any mismatch between your verbal and non-verbal communication?
•
Is your non-verbal communication helping you to convey the impression you
would like to convey to your learners?
•
Should you attempt to change or modify any aspect of your non-verbal
communication?
Activity 12.2
Experimenting with your posture
Here are descriptions of eight different postures that a teacher could adopt in front
of a group of learners.
1
Seated, leaning forward;
2
Seated, relaxed to the point of slouching;
3
Seated, arms folded;
4
Standing, hands on hips;
5
Standing, hands clasped in front;
6
Standing, arms outstretched;
7
Seated behind table;
118 Your non-verbal communication

8
Standing behind table, arms straight, hands on table.
For each one of the above:
•
Try this posture now while imagining a group in front of you.
•
Does the posture feel deliberate or natural?
•
What else describes how it feels?
•
Do you use this posture?
•
How do you think learners might perceive you in this posture? (For example,
authoritative; threatening; conﬁdent; welcoming)
DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
The ﬁrst step in developing your practice in non-verbal communication is to
become aware of what you currently do. The activities above and some of
the questions earlier in the chapter should have helped you to start on this.
The next step is to plan how you can make changes to your non-verbal
communication. One way is to resolve to change a particular aspect. For
example, to adopt a new posture when welcoming a group or to make sure
you never ﬁddle distractedly with your pen while talking to a group. Second,
you can plan for how you are going to monitor your non-verbal commu-
nication in a session. For example, decide that every time a learner asks a
question, as well as paying attention to it and responding, you will ask
yourself, ‘What is my non-verbal communication at this point and what
message is it conveying to the learner?’

Acknowledging and handling
your feelings
This chapter includes the following activities:
13.1 Recognizing and managing strong feelings in the moment
13.2 Reﬂecting on how you handled strong feelings
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
Much of this book is directly concerned with how you, as a teacher, handle
and inﬂuence the feelings of your learners. However, your own feelings as a
teacher deserve equal attention. There is no doubt that you can experience
some very strong and occasionally very conﬂicting feelings while teaching.
For example: ‘I remember feeling a sense of rising panic. . . . I felt very
vulnerable . . . sweat was beginning to seep through my shirt’ (Gilbert 2004:
34). The teacher quoted here is new to his job, but strong feelings do not
necessarily diminish as you get older and more experienced. Teacher and
author Parker J. Palmer, with 25 years’ experience, encountered a learner
who he described as ‘The Student from Hell’ and, in his own judgement, did
not handle the situation well. He writes, ‘I left that class with a powerful
combination of feelings: self-pity, fraudulence and rage’ (Palmer 1998: 43).
While your normal teaching experience is unlikely to provide you with 
such an overwhelming depth of emotional response, you should be concerned
if you do not experience strong feelings from time to time. These may be
feelings you will welcome, such as exhilaration, relief and joy. Handling such
kinds of strong feelings need not be problematic. It is the other troubling
feelings, when you are outraged, shocked, insulted, offended, disappointed
or frustrated, that pose more of a threat to the well-being of you and your
learners as well as a threat to achieving the goals of the session.
Take a moment to recall times when you have experienced strong feelings
while teaching. What kinds of feelings do you recall?
Chapter 13

The techniques for developing self-awareness (see Chapter 10) are
important for ensuring you are able, ﬁrst, to identify these feelings. Once you
have acknowledged the feelings you experience as a teacher, you may be
tempted to take one of two opposing but extreme steps, both of which are
unhealthy and not emotionally intelligent.
One is to suppress your feelings, to deny their importance or just pretend
they are not there. This can lead to more stress for you and poor relationships
with others if you are withholding your feelings from them. In doing this,
you are not showing respect for yourself and it makes it almost impossible
for you to accept others who do express their feelings. The other extreme is
to blurt it all out in every detail and let everybody know how you are feeling
all of the time which is overwhelming for the recipient, indulgent on your
part and unprofessional.
A more useful response is to engage in the second of Daniel Goleman’s ﬁve
emotional and social competencies: self-regulation (Goleman 1998: 318).
This is best described by Geetu Orme as ‘being able to face disruptive
emotions like anger and fear and making choices when you are in the middle
of a crisis’ (Orme 2001: 16). Self-regulation involves judicious choice on your
part about what is the appropriate thing to say and do given the feelings
aroused in you, the context you are in and what your goals are in that
context.
There are two strands to this. First, you need to be skilled at handling your
feelings in the moment. Once you are aware of your feelings, there are some
rapid decisions to be made. These are reﬂected in Activity 13.1 below which
gives you the chance to anticipate a challenging situation and practise how
you might respond. Second, you must ensure that you deal with those
episodes that were challenging, after the event. You can never be sure on any
occasion that you will say and do just the right thing. Activity 13.2 gives you
the chance to reﬂect on one or more incidents and begin to come to terms
with them. These activities are particularly suitable for completing with the
assistance of someone else who can help you reﬂect on your responses (see,
for example, activities 15.2 and 15.5 in Chapter 15).
The key points about handling your feelings are:
•
recognize your feelings;
•
manage the feelings so that you can choose how to behave, looking after
the interests of both you and your learners;
•
make sure you take time to talk through, reﬂect on, and hopefully learn
from your experience afterwards.
122 Acknowledging and handling your feelings

INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 13.1
Recognizing and managing strong feelings in the
moment
We’ve all had a comment or question from a learner that we have found very
challenging. This activity guides you in working out the best response to your most
demanding situation.
1
Is there an expression of feelings by a learner that you would dread more than
any other? One you would ﬁnd it most difﬁcult to respond to?
Write it down in the space below.
2
What would be your gut reaction to this statement? What would you be saying
to yourself?
3
What would you like to say in response?
4
What words can you use to describe the feelings that the learner’s statement
would arouse in you?
5
Go back to your gut reaction. What is it about the learner’s statement that
triggers your reaction?
6
If you could make the perfect response to the learner’s statement, what would
you want it to achieve:
•
for your beneﬁt
Acknowledging and handling your feelings
123

•
for the learner’s beneﬁt
•
for the beneﬁt of the rest of the group
7
Taking account of what you would like your response to achieve, carefully word
the perfect response.
Activity 13.2
Reflecting on how you handled strong feelings
This activity gives you the opportunity to review an occasion when you experienced
strong feelings as a teacher and equips you with a series of questions which you can
use to be better prepared for such occasions in the future.
1
Select an incident with a group or learner in a group which aroused strong feelings
in you.
2
Describe what happened. Don’t make judgements yet or try to draw conclusions:
simply describe. Make sure you include just facts – no inferences or assumptions.
3
Describe how you felt at the time.
4
What are the key words in articulating these feelings, for example, angry, shocked,
vulnerable? (It is worth also asking, ‘Are they familiar?’, ‘Am I comfortable with
them?’)
124 Acknowledging and handling your feelings

5
What was your outward reaction?
6
To what extent were you able to manage those feelings?
7
Looking back, what sense can you make of the incident and your reactions?
8
What conclusions can you draw from the incident and your reactions?
9
If the same thing happened tomorrow:
•
would it provoke the same feelings in you?
•
would you be able to manage the feelings it provoked?
•
what would your outward reaction be?
10
Look back at all of your answers above. What have you learned from this
exercise?
DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Developing your skill at managing strong feelings while teaching depends on
you taking the opportunity to learn from such occasions as they arise. Activity
13.2 provides a framework, which you can use or modify, to help you reﬂect
productively on these events. It is important not to underplay incidents that
evoke strong responses in you and also to set aside time to reﬂect on them
in a structured way, if you are seeking to become more adept in this vital
aspect of emotional intelligence.
Acknowledging and handling your feelings

Revealing your feelings to
learners
This chapter includes the following activities:
14.1 How far do you reveal your feelings to learners?
14.2 Planning to reveal your feelings to learners
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
I once interviewed a teacher in further education about the impact on his
work of a course he had done. The course was on counselling skills in
education and training. One of his comments was: ‘As a result of the course,
I now see students as human beings.’ He meant that he now saw beyond the
particular categories that he or his institution had placed learners into, such
as ‘mature’, ‘first year’ and so on, and was able to catch a glimpse of the
individual behind the role of learner.
This comment by the teacher may be seen as a shift on his part to being
more authentic in his teaching. Patricia Cranton and Ellen Carusetta suggest
that new teachers are likely to draw on a ‘teacher persona’ as a guide for how
they should behave in the classroom (Cranton and Carusetta 2004). That
persona is based on role models from their time as students and from collec-
tively held views about what a teacher should be. At the same time they ‘rely
on social norms to deﬁne student and then use these norms to form rules about
how students behave’ (ibid.: 291). While teachers have this blanket under-
standing of who the students are, it prevents them from seeing students as
individuals and thereby from forming relationships with them. Changes come
about through experience, through the questioning of these personae and from
reﬂection on practice. In the case of the teacher quoted above, the course he
had attended had clearly given him that opportunity to reﬂect on his practice
and to adjust his views in a move to greater authenticity on his part.
How often do your learners see you as ‘human’? How far are they aware
of the person who inhabits the role of teacher? How far should they be
Chapter 14

aware? It is impossible to be emotionally intelligent in your teaching while
hiding your persona behind your role. Showing your learners that you are
human too and, in particular, that you have feelings is not only essential for
your use of emotional intelligence, it also affects the emotional climate in the
room and is essential for a healthy relationship between you and them.
Of course, it is possible to misinterpret what this means in practice. It does
not mean you should abuse your position to reveal all to your learners and
use them as a captive audience for a series of revelations about your private
life. Nor does it mean you should encourage inappropriate relationships or
topics for discussion in the classroom. If you are preparing your learners for
a particular vocation, then it would not help to model a way of behaving
that would be unsuitable for their profession.
What it does mean is that there is room for some recognition by you and
your learners of your feelings and your true personality. If there is to be
emotional intelligence in the classroom, there must be recognition and
acceptance of the emotional dimension in all of us. It is okay to reveal yourself
as an emotional being and to transcend your role, showing that you are not
simply the repository of skills and knowledge associated with your expertise
and your profession.
As outlined earlier (Chapter 7), Carl Rogers (1961) advocated that one of
the three qualities that a successful teacher should exhibit was genuineness.
He sometimes used the term transparency or congruence instead. We might
say open. By this he meant that you should not put on a façade and that you
should be yourself with learners. This involves being ready to let your learners
know how you feel, not by giving them minute-by-minute commentary on
your feelings but rather to do so when it is appropriate. Indeed, a lack of
authenticity will be difﬁcult to sustain, as your real feelings are likely to ‘leak’
out. A number of learners’ classroom activities ask them to reﬂect on their
personal experience and it is questionable, as Bruce Macfarlane discusses
(MacFarlane 2004: 121–6), to encourage them to be personal while you
retain an emotional distance.
The two activities which follow are linked. Activity 14.1 invites you to
consider whether and how far you reveal your feelings at the moment and,
if so, which ones? Activity 14.2 invites you to think more on how much of
your person you want to be in your role as a teacher and how and when you
should be revealing your feelings.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 14.1
How far do you reveal your feelings to learners?
Making deliberate disclosures to groups of learners about how you are feeling can be
a very potent device for encouraging them to see the person behind the role and for
128 Revealing your feelings to learners

affecting the learning climate. Such actions need to be handled with care and this
activity comprises three steps in reviewing the kinds of feelings that you are already
revealing to your learners.
Step 1
There will be occasions when you draw on stories from your personal experience to
assist your explanations to learners. Think of some of these stories. For each story,
ask:
•
Does it reveal feelings of yours?
•
If so, what kinds of feelings of yours does it reveal? For example, surprise, fear,
joy, vulnerability?
•
Is there any repetition of feelings conveyed? Are there any patterns?
Step 2
Below is a list of feelings which can be revealed in personal anecdotes. Take each
feeling in turn and put them under one of the three headings in the table that follows.
You may want to add other feelings to the columns.
1

3
Revealing your feelings to learners
129
anger; joy; grief; greed; happiness; relief; confusion; triumph; helplessness; worry;
exhilaration; anxiety; elation; panic; terror; annoyance; boredom; concern;
irritation; excitement; envy; despair; agitation; impatience

I have not yet 
I would never reveal

but I could do so

Step 3
Take one of the feelings from column 3. Consider your reason for never revealing it
to a group. Is it because:
•
You want to control the image they have of you?
•
You do not think it promotes a learning climate?
•
You are not comfortable in yourself with having this feeling?
•
Of any other reason?
Repeat step 3 with as many feelings from column 3 as you wish.
DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 14.2
Planning to reveal your feelings to learners
Think of a session you will be running. Look at your entries in the columns in activity
14.1 above. Find a feeling from column 2, or perhaps column 3, that you could reveal
to the group in a story which will illustrate the points you are making or explaining.
Plan for how you will introduce and tell the story.
130 Revealing your feelings to learners

Continuing your development
as an emotionally intelligent
teacher
This chapter includes the following activities:
15.1 Self-assessment of your use of emotional intelligence in a session
15.2 Setting goals to develop your use of emotional intelligence in teaching
15.3 Storytelling
15.4 Reﬂective diary
15.5 Pairing with a colleague
15.6 Learner feedback on your use of emotional intelligence
WHAT DOES IT MEAN AND WHY DOES IT
MATTER?
This book and in particular the activities in it serve to open up what using
emotional intelligence can mean for you in your working context. Hopefully
you have been assisted in starting to review and develop your practice in this
area.
However, as stated earlier (Chapters 1 and 10), the development of
emotional intelligence and its use in teaching is by deﬁnition continuous. To
be emotionally intelligent is to be constantly developing, to be forever
enquiring about the feelings you encounter in yourself and others. Every
encounter with learners has the potential for fresh experiences in handling
the emotional dimension of learning. Remember that it cannot be conﬁned
to your role as a teacher; it is holistic and part of what is your continuing
growth as a person.
This final chapter suggests strategies to assist you in progressing your
development, as you continue to review and enhance your practice.
Formal opportunities to develop your use of emotional intelligence in
teaching may present themselves. In addition to courses on the development
of emotional intelligence, there are related courses in, for instance, person-
centred counselling or Transactional Analysis in education. In the absence
of a formal course, the beneﬁt of doing any activities such as those in this
Chapter 15

book will be enhanced if you are able to draw on another person, perhaps a
colleague, to help you reﬂect and learn. Activities 15.3 and 15.5 below are
examples of activities which depend on the help of others for their success.
The use of structured reflection as a tool for learning is common in
professional development and is inseparable from the process of developing
emotional intelligence. Just as emotional intelligence is essential for effective
reﬂection, so the reﬂective process is essential in the development of emotional
intelligence. Reﬂection is about learning from experience. In order to learn
from experience it is invariably necessary to take account of the emotional
component of the experience; Boud, Keogh and Walker (1985) see ‘attending
to feelings’ as the second of the three stages of reﬂection. The starting point
for the development of emotional intelligence is experience, and many of the
activities in this book are designed to generate material for you to reﬂect on
and learn from.
In the remainder of this chapter, there are six activities. Activity 15.1
provides a checklist of emotionally intelligent behaviours against which you
can assess yourself, or be assessed by another, to review your current state
of practice. Activity 15.2 suggests how to create action plans based on 
the ﬁndings of 15.1. Activities 15.3 and 15.4 are two examples of how the
reflective process may be used for your continuous development. Activity
15.5 outlines how to form an alliance with another colleague to aid your
mutual development. Activity 15.6 suggests a means of obtaining feedback
from your learners about your use of emotional intelligence.
INVESTIGATING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 15.1
Self-assessment of your use of emotional
intelligence in a session
This activity provides a checklist of emotionally intelligent behaviours in the classroom
to use as a basis for identifying further development needs. Some of the 19 statements
on the checklist can only be assessed by you, as they are ‘internal’ behaviours, e.g.
‘monitor my prejudices towards any members of the group’. Others may be assessed
by you and/or a colleague and/or your learners. Some of the items on the checklist
lend themselves to being adapted for use in Activity 15.6.
Complete the following questionnaire, which relates to your current classroom
practice.

DEVELOPING YOUR PRACTICE
Activity 15.2
Setting goals to develop your use of emotional
intelligence in teaching
Use the checklist in Activity 15.1 as a starting point for setting goals. For example,
select three items which you could do more often or at which you could be more
accomplished. Turn them into goals, for example:
‘I will make more statements to the group which convey empathy.’
‘I will acknowledge the presence, by name, of each person in the room at least
once in a session.’
For each goal you will need to decide:
•
in which speciﬁc session you will ﬁrst make the changes
•
what you would need to do and/or say additionally or differently, in detail,
including the words you will use
•
what preparation you will need for this
•
what help you will need
•
what could go wrong
•
what your contingency plan is
Then you should write down the steps you need to take to carry out your plan, in
sequence, with dates.
134 Continuing your development

Activity 15.3
Storytelling
Turning your experiences into stories, which then form the vehicle for learning
through reflection, can be a very powerful means of learning about the emotional
dimension of your experience at work. As the activity indicates, at least one other
person is necessary for this to operate, and it is especially important that they are
committed and able to fulﬁl their role in helping you make the most of the story.
You will need one person, or even better, a small group of peers to work with.
Step 1
Choose an incident related to the emotional dimension of your work as a teacher
that you want to explore further in order to learn from it. The incident may be one
that you have not yet fully resolved, one that made you think about your practice or
simply one that you have never had the chance to talk about at length.
Step 2
Write down your story about the incident.
Step 3
Brief your partner/group using the guidelines below on what you want them to do
when you tell your story.
Step 4
Tell your story to your partner/group.
Step 5
Use your partner/group to help you explore your responses to what happened in the
story.
Step 6
Attempt to draw conclusions from the story, both speciﬁc and general.
Step 7
Plan for how to deal better with, or to prevent, a similar incident.
Step 8
Imagine you had to write the story again, for a new audience. How might you ﬁnd
yourself telling it differently, following your storytelling experience?
For example:
Continuing your development
135

•
include new details;
•
shift of emphasis for some parts;
•
include what you have learned;
•
be clearer about the perspective of the others in the story;
•
make it more of a comedy than a tragedy, or vice versa.
Guidelines for those listening to the story:
•
Pay attention.
•
Ask questions if you need clariﬁcation.
•
Ask questions to prompt further reﬂection by the storyteller.
•
Demonstrate to the storyteller that you have heard what is said and what is
unsaid, both facts and feelings.
•
Don’t override the storyteller by relating your own experience or giving your
own interpretation.
•
Don’t make judgements of, or offer opinions to, the storyteller.
For more extensive details on the use of storytelling in reﬂection, see Learning through
Storytelling in Higher Education by Janice McDrury and Maxine Alterio (2003).
Activity 15.4
Reflective diary
Reflective diaries are a common vehicle for continuous professional development.
This activity suggests three different focuses for diaries, each of which may be used
to develop emotional intelligence.
1
Incidents
Whenever you experience an incident that holds signiﬁcance for you in the area of
being a teacher or working with learners, use the following checklist to guide your
reﬂective writing about it.
•
What happened?
•
What feelings were aroused in me?
•
What did I have conﬁrmed or ﬁnd reassuring?
•
What did I discover?
136 Continuing your development

•
What questions am I left with?
•
What plans and resolutions will I make?
2
Relationships
Keep a regular diary, for example, with weekly entries, which reviews how you relate
to individual learners and groups of learners.
One way to get started on this is to revisit some of the material from Chapter 2.
Alternatively, you could describe the strengths and weaknesses in your relationships
with different groups or individuals. What is it about some relationships that give you
conﬁdence? What is it about other relationships that you ﬁnd threatening?
3
Experiments
Whenever you try something new that is designed to incorporate emotional
intelligence in your teaching, write about it. Use the same checklist as in ‘Incidents’
above.
Activity 15.5
Pairing with a colleague
This involves you and a colleague making an agreement about offering mutual support.
The activity shows how a formal, structured approach can be adopted by two
colleagues. Like storytelling it provides a very potent means of exploring the strong
emotions that may be bound up in work-related incidents. The agreement should sit
alongside your relationship as colleagues and perhaps friends. It is an agreement to
move to a more formal relationship when either of you requests it. However, it does
not prevent the pair of you from having everyday discussions of problems in a less
structured, more spontaneous way. As in Activity 15.3, the skills of the listener are
vital in making it work.
1
Find a colleague whom you feel you can trust and with whom you can form a
partnership to aid your mutual professional development.
2
You agree that at certain times either of you may draw on the other for help in
solving a problem or exploring an issue.
3
If possible, arrange to meet on a regular basis and share the time available.
4
In any one session, decide who will be listener and who will be talker, or take,
for example, half the session each, taking turns in each role. The roles work as
follows:
Continuing your development
137

Listener:
•
pays attention
•
makes responses which:
–
conﬁrm they have heard fully what the talker has said
–
help the talker explore the issue thoroughly
•
allows the talker the time to explore the whole issue
•
tolerates very strong feelings expressed by the talker
•
seeks not to give guidance or advice (even when asked to) but rather assists the
talker in ﬁnding their own solution
•
does not make judgements.
Talker:
•
uses the attention of the listener to help them unravel the problem/issue
•
does not feel obliged to come up with a quick solution
•
is comfortable with revealing doubts or uncertainties.
Activity 15.6
Learner feedback on your use of emotional
intelligence
Getting feedback from learners on your work as a teacher is good practice.
Conventional feedback forms focus on important questions relating to materials,
structure of the session, presentation and so on. This activity invites you to expand
on the usual questions and find out a little more about your use of emotional
intelligence.
Assume you are seeking feedback from learners at the end of your teaching session.
You have three standard open questions you use on the form:
1
How useful was the session?
2
What effect did it have on your work for this module?
3
Please comment on the quality of the materials and presentation.
You want to add three further questions to get some feedback on your use of
emotional intelligence. Here are some of the things you might ask about:
•
listening;
138 Continuing your development

•
empathizing;
•
creating a climate;
•
attending to feelings;
•
being open about your feelings.
Many others are suggested by the titles of chapters in this book or by the checklist in
Activity 15.1.
Here are examples of the kinds of question you might ask:
1
How fully did the teacher listen to comments and questions from the group?
2
How much did the teacher acknowledge individuals’ presence and contributions?
3
Please use three words to describe the atmosphere in the room.
Think of three or more questions that you would like answered.

Conclusion and further reading
If you have found this book of use in your development as a teacher, then I
hope you will be able to continue exploring how the use of emotional
intelligence can enhance your work. The book has been designed to aid your
learning by practice and reflection, that is, by active learning. However, 
if you would like to explore further reading in this area, here are some
suggestions, in the absence of other books specifically on emotional
intelligence in teaching. (Full details of all titles are in the References section
which follows.)
Transactional Analysis for Trainers goes into detail about how the theory of
TA translates into practice for anyone responsible for the learning of groups,
whether you see yourself working in training or education. TA Today is a
thorough and accessible introduction to the many components of TA.
Parker J. Palmer’s belief is that we must strive to be ourselves in our teaching.
This authenticity is at the heart of what it means to be emotionally intelligent.
He makes his case with compassion and elegance in The Courage to Teach.
Geetu Orme’s Emotionally Intelligent Living is a good introduction to what
being emotionally intelligent means in everyday life. It includes an excellent
short account of the history of the term.
The EI Advantage by Patricia McBride and Susan Maitland is a compre-
hensive range of activities for developing emotional intelligence at work.
Eric Jensen has written a number of books on brain-based learning, including
The Learning Brain and Super Teaching, which include materials on how to
develop a learning state in learners and on the important role emotions play
in this process.
Freedom to Learn by Carl Rogers, originally published in 1967, captures his
belief in the central importance of the relationship between teacher and
learner.

As stated in the Introduction, Rene Descartes’ words, ‘I think therefore I am’
have guided the work of teachers for centuries. For today’s teachers, who are
putting more of their energy into recognizing and working with the emotional
dimension of learning, perhaps it is time to adopt an alternative statement
and begin to assert, ‘I feel therefore I am’.
