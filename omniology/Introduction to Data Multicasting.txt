Data Multicasting
Data multicasting is the process of transmitting media channels to a num-
ber of users through the use of multiple distributed channels. 
Multicasting typically involves the use of group addresses, which allow
receivers to “tune” to the same stream of data as it is transmitted over the
network. This is in contrast to a unicast transmission whereby multiple
copies of the stream are individually addressed to an end user and are trans-
mitted over the network. Multicasting provides much more efficient use of
the network resources. However, the use of multicasting can complicate
media control functions such as pause and fast-forward. 
Multicasting (one-to-many or many-to-many) can dramatically increase the
efficiency of a network compared to unicasting (one-to-one) or broadcasting
(one-to-all) transmission. Multicasting is critical for mass media streaming
sources such as IP television and Internet radio. Without the use of multi-
casting, a 3 Mbps television streaming service would require data connec-
tions of 30 Gbps to provide service to 10,000 customers.
Multicasting group membership defines how members find, join and discon-
nect from multicast sessions. Multicast transmission involves the use of spe-
cial multicast addresses. It is possible to configure multicast systems to pro-
vide varying levels of quality of service for different multicast members.

There are many types of protocols (commands and processes) that can be
used to setup and manage multicast sessions. Some of the key protocols used
for multicasting include IGMP, PIM-DM, PIM-SM, MOSPF, CBT and
BGMP. The processes and capabilities that these protocols have determine
the amount of latency (setup and transmission delay), scalability (ability to
serve many users) and protocol overhead (percentage of network resources
that are needed for the protocol commands and operation).
Multicast sessions may use security processes to ensure administrators can
configure multicast trees and only authorized members may attach and
decode multicast media. There are other emerging forms of multicast trans-
mission that include gridcasting and peercasting where multicast recipients
retransmit media to other users. 
Multicast Applications
Multicast applications are programs or functions that involve communica-
tion with one to many or many to many applications. They range from best
effort distribution to many receivers (such as television services through the
Internet), to high-reliability real time distribution (such as critical video
conferencing services).
Content Distribution
Content distribution is the process of transferring content to one or more
persons, companies or points. Content distribution (such as television pro-
grams) may need to be distributed in near-real time without the ability to
recover lost media.
Shared Applications
Shared applications are processes or functions that allow multiple devices or
users to interact with them. Examples of shared applications include multi-
-2-

Introduction to Data Multicasting

user word processor programs, whiteboards and multi-user gaming pro-
grams. Shared applications may require reliable near-real time distribution
to allow participates to effectively interact with the applications.
Information Distribution
Multipoint information distribution applications are delivery services such
as news, sports, stock or weather updates that transports data or media to
groups of users. Information distribution tends to be less time sensitive.
Network Configuration
Network configuration is a set of network conditions and parameters that
are used to allow one or more types of services and applications. Networks
can be composed of many devices that require near simultaneous updates
and multicasting can be used to update these devices close to the same time
period. These types of services may require tracking or guaranteed delivery
services.
Multipoint Distribution
Sending signals to multiple users requires the use of a combination of uni-
casting, broadcasting, anycasting or multicasting services that can perform
multipoint distribution. 
Unicasting
Unicasting is the process of transmitting media channels to a number of
users through the use of a separate channel (unicast channel) for each user.
-3-

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Each unicast channel can be separately setup, managed and disconnected
under the control of the serving computer host. If unicasting is used to pro-
vide broadcast or multicast services, a separate communication session
must be established and managed between each user (client) and the broad-
cast provider (media server).
Figure 1.1 shows how multipoint distribution can be performed using uni-
cast transmission. Each recipient must create a separate unicast connection
directly to the media source. This means as each connection (viewer) is
added, the media server and the routers closest to the source must be able
to simultaneously transport all connections (4 connections in this example).

Broadcasting
Broadcasting is a process that sends voice, data or video signals simultane-
ously to group of people or companies in a specific geographic area or who
can connect or receive signals from a broadcast network system (e.g. satel-
lite or cable television system). Broadcasting is typically associated with
radio or television radio transmission systems that send the same radio sig-
nal to many receivers in a geographic area. 
Broadcasting can also be applied to data distribution systems where all
users that are connected to the network can receive and forward the same
information signal. When a broadcast packet of data is received from an
upstream source, it can be copied and distributed to all connections in a
downstream direction. Broadcast transmission systems do not know or care
about who is interested in receiving the packets so every packet is distrib-
uted to every receiver regardless if they desire to receive the data or not.
Figure 1.2 shows how multipoint distribution can be performed using broad-
cast transmission. Each router in the data network must receive packets
from the upstream connection, copy each packet and the packets in the
downstream direction. Each router in the data network receives packets,
copies the packets and forwards the packets until they reach all recipients
in the system.
Anycasting
Anycasting is the process of setting up media streaming connections to the
best or closest source. While anycast distribution may allow all users to find
and connect to a media source, the tree structure for an anycast system may
not be the most efficient distribution structure.
Each router in the anycast data network must receive packets from any
multicast stream, copy each packet and forward the packets in the down-
stream direction. Each recipient can find and connect to any path in the dis-
tribution tree.

Figure 1.3 shows how multipoint distribution can be performed using any-
cast transmission. The recipient can find and request a connection to a mul-
ticast stream. This example shows that the connection may not be the ideal
or shortest path between the source and the recipient.
Multicasting
Multicasting is the process of transmitting media channels to a number of
users through the use of distributed channels (copying media channels) as
they progress through a network. Using multicast medium access control
(MAC) or Internet protocol (IP) addresses, multiple end users may “tune” to
the same stream of data as it is transmitted over the network.

Multicasting provides much more efficient use of the network resources
because routers only receive, copy and forward packets towards their desti-
nation if there are recipients downstream of the router.
Figure 1.4 shows how multipoint distribution can be performed using mul-
ticast transmission. Each router in the data network that is part of the mul-
ticast distribution tree must receive packets from the upstream connection
and copy each packet in the downstream direction. Each router in the data
network only receives and forwards packets if there are multicast recipients
downstream in the system.

Data Routing
Packet data routing involves the transmission of packets through intelligent
switches (called routers) that analyze the destination address of the packet
and determine a path that will help the packet travel towards its destina-
tion. The common types of data packets that are routed through a network
include Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6.
-8-

Introduction to Data Multicasting
Figure 1.4, Multipoint Distribution Using Multicasting

Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)
IP version 4 is a network packet routing protocol that uses 32 bit addresses.
To help simplify the presentation of IPv4 addresses, it is common to group
each 8 bit part of the IP address as a decimal number separated from the
other parts by a dot(.), such as 207.169.222.45.
Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
IP version 6 is a network packet routing protocol that uses 128 bit address-
es. IPV6 is an enhanced version of Internet protocol version (4 IPv4) that
was developed primarily to correct shortcomings of IPv4 such as the 32 bit
address that limited the maximum number of devices that could be address-
es and to extend the capabilities of IP to meet the demands of the future
such as data multicasting and improved quality of service (QoS) capabilities.
IPv6 addresses are denoted as 8 hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons. 
A typical address will look like this:
0800:5008:0000:0000:0000:1005:AABC:AD46
A short-hand notation that replaces one set of consecutive zeros with colons
(::) may also be used. The above address can also be denoted by:
0800:5008::1005:AABC:AD46
A routing table contains at least two pairs of information; a destination
address and a next hop routing address. Because of this, routers only need
to hold information that they can use to determine the optimal paths to their
destinations. Routers may also hold the cost of routing information that may
be based on per packet cost or link usage cost.

Figure 1.5 shows how a router is used to receive and forward data packets
toward their destination. This diagram shows that a router receives packets
from other routers, examines the destination address of the packet and uses
its stored routing tables to determine which router is the best choice for for-
warding the packet towards its destination.
There are two key methods (routing algorithms) that routers can use to
determine where to send packets; distance vector routing and link state
routing.

Figure 1.5, Data Routing

Distance Vector Routing
Distance vector routing algorithms are packet processing rules that allow
routers to discover, determine and use the distances of connection routes to
make decisions on how to forward packets. In general, distance vector algo-
rithms may require less processing power and memory than other routing
protocols. Distance vector routing algorithms may be more prone to the cre-
ation of routing loops and they are less scalable and resilient than other
routing algorithms.
A routing loop is a connection path or process that passes data packets from
a router to other routers that return the packet back to the original sending
router. This may occur because routing tables are dynamically changing as
routers continually learn of connections to new routers, which results in the
creation of new paths for forwarding packets. For packets that get caught in
a routing loop, the time to live (TTL) field in the packet header will eventu-
ally be depleted (decreases each time a routing hop occurs) so the packet will
eventually be discarded.
Link State Routing
Link state algorithms are packet processing rules that allow routers to dis-
cover, determine and use link connection routes to make decisions on how to
forward packets. In general, link state algorithms are less prone to the cre-
ation of routing loops and they are more scalable and more resilient than
other routing algorithms. However, link state algorithms may require more
processing power and memory than other routing protocols.
Multicast Operation
Multicast systems setup and distribute media through the establishment of
distribution trees. These trees can be setup by allowing users to request con-
nection to the media source (sparse mode) or by flooding the network to all
-11-

potential recipients and disconnecting the connections to users that are not
interested in receiving the connection (dense mode).
Multicast Session
A multicast session is the connections and media transfers that occur
between sources of information and group members that are attached to the
multicast tree. 
Sparse Mode Multicasting
Sparse mode multicasting is the distribution of media to multiple users
within a data network where a limited or small number of the users that are
connected to the network are part of the multicast group. Each member of a
sparse mode multicasting system requests connection to the multicast group
and this establishes the multicast tree.
Figure 1.6 shows how a data network may be setup to allow sparse mode
multicasting. This example shows that sparse mode multicasting is effective
when there are a small number of devices that want to receive a shared
media source. Each device requests connection to the media source when
they want to view it. Only the routers that become part of the distribution
tree need to communicate with the group members.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Dense Mode Multicasting
Dense mode multicasting is the distribution of media to multiple users with-
in a data network where many or most of the users that are connected to the
network are part of the multicast group. In dense mode multicast systems,
the network is flooded with multicast messages and group members who are
not connected to the network are pruned from the multicast tree. Members
of a dense mode multicasting system often request connections to the mul-
ticast group after the tree has been created.

Flooding is an action of forwarding a frame onto all ports of a switch except
the port on which it arrived. Flooding may be used for frames with multicast
addresses or unknown unicast destination addresses.
Pruning
Pruning is the process of disconnecting connections that are no longer active
in a communication network. An example of pruning is the removal of users
in a dense mode multicast network that have been added but did not sub-
scribe to or are not using the multicast service. Multicast pruning is a
process that removes connections in a multicast tree that are no longer
needed or used.
Grafting
Grafting is the process of adding a leaf or group member to a multicast ses-
sion while the multicast session is in progress (late entry or reconnection).
Grafting allows late entry to a multicast session.
Figure 1.7 shows how a data network may be setup to allow dense mode
multicasting. This example shows that dense mode multicasting floods all
routers in the network with multicast information. Devices that are not
interested are removed (pruned) from the distribution tree.
Group Management
Group management is the process of defining groups of users or devices and
adding and removing members (people and/or devices) to the groups. Group
management protocols such as IGMP are used to add, manage and remove

members in a group. A multicast group manager is a device or process that
is responsible for maintaining a list and coordinating members of a group.
Group membership protocols include Internet group management protocol
(IGMP) and multicast listener discovery (MLD) protocol.
Group Addressing
A group address (multicast address) is an identification code that is used to
identify a set of stations or a number of devices as the destination for trans-
mitted data. In essence, devices in a multicast group listen for (share) a sin-
gle address that identifies a multicast session. Multicast addresses can be
dynamically assigned for specific multicast sessions.
Figure 1.7, Dense Mode Multicasting

The Internet assigned numbering authority is a group that is responsible for
the assignment and coordination of Internet addresses and key parameters
such as protocol variables and domain names. The IANA controls the
assignment of IP multicast addresses.
Of the 32 bit Internet addresses version 4, 28 bits have been reserved as
multicast addresses. These are known as class D IP addresses and the mul-
ticast IP addresses range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. 
Of the 128 bit Internet addresses version 6, 112 bits have been reserved for
multicast addresses. Of the 48 bit Ethernet addresses, 23 bits have been
reserved for multicast addresses.
Figure 1.8 shows the different types of multicast group addressing. IP ver-
sion 4 uses 28 bits of the 32 bit IPv4 address for multicast addresses.
Ethernet multicast addressing uses 23 of the 48 bit Ethernet address for
multicast addressing. IP version 6 uses 112 bits of the 132 bits for multicast
addressing and some of the remaining bits are used for control purposes
(flag and scope bits).

Multicast Scoping
Multicast scoping is the process of assigning the number of routing hop con-
straints or using addresses that limit where data packets can travel through
a network. An example of administrative scoping is the use of multicast
addresses, which cannot be transmitted outside a local domain.
Address Scoping
Address scoping is the assigning or defining of a set of addresses that are
used for specific functions or restricted to specific areas (within a domain or
subnetwork).
Limited Scoped Address
A limited scoped address is a unique private IP address in the range of
239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 that is associated with multicast connections.
Limited scoped addresses can be used to allow a multicast session to be used
in private networks without interference from or transfer to the public
Internet.
Time to Live (TTL)
Time to live is a field within a data packet that is used to limit the maxi-
mum number of routing or switching points a packet may pass through (a
hop limit) during transmission in a data network. The TTL counter is
decreased as it progresses through each router or switching point in the net-
work. If the TTL counter reaches 0, the packet can be discarded. The use of
TTL ensures packets will not be transmitted in an infinite loop.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Distribution Trees
A multicast distribution tree is a path structure from a source to its desti-
nations where the origination point (tree base) divides (branches) into its
destination points (tree leaves). Distribution trees can have a single source
or the branches on the tree may be used as other source feeds (shared tree).
Source Tree
A source tree is a multicast structure that has the source of the multicast-
ing located at the base of the tree. A source tree is also known as a shortest
path tree because each branch in the tree has the shortest path to other
branches or nodes.
A single source multicast source tree has a single starting point and all of
the nodes in the tree are the optimal (shortest) paths that can be traveled
from the source to the receiver. This diagram shows that the addressing
format is (S, G) where S is the source IP address and G is the multicast IP
address.
Figure 1.9 shows how a single source multicast data session allows a single
source to send the same information to multiple receivers without the need
to repeat the transmission back through multiple switches and routers in
the network. This example shows that an IP address source is combined
with a single multicast address that allows each router in the multicast tree
to forward the packets only to members of the group.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Shared Tree
A shared tree is a multicast structure that has the source of the multicast-
ing located anywhere in the tree. The location of the source in a shared tree
is called the rendezvous point (RP). 
Rendezvous Point (RP)
A rendezvous point is a data network address of a node (such as a router) in
a communications network where one or multiple data sources will be
directed to so they can be retransmitted to other points in a multicast dis-
tribution tree.

Introduction to Data Multicasting
Figure 1.9, Data Multicasting Single Source Tree

A multicast shared tree can have multiple sources that supply to a ren-
dezvous point (RP) where is it distributed by a tree to the group receivers.
This example shows that a shared tree structure may have redundant or
less than optimal (longer) paths from a source to the receivers. This diagram
shows that the addressing format is (*,G) where * is the source IP address
(can be multiple sources) and G is the multicast IP address.
Figure 1.10 shows how a shared source multicast data session allows multi-
ple sources to send the information to multiple receivers through the use of
a reference address (rendezvous point). In this example, the data from each
source is sent to the rendezvous point (RP), which then distributes the infor-
mation through a tree structure to the multicast group recipients. This dia-
gram shows that there is the potential for some duplicate transmission in
the shared source multicast session as the source and destination may be
sent in different directions through the same routers.

Multicast Address Notation
Multicast address notation is the format of addresses that indicate the mul-
ticast group and its source of information. For source trees, the notation is
source and group pair (S, G) and for shared trees, the notation is any source
and group pair (*, G). A source and group pair (S,G) is the identification
information used for multicast source trees. The notation indicates the
source address and the group address.
A source and group pair (S, G) is the identification information used for mul-
ticast source trees. For multicast shared trees that can have sources at any
location in the tree, the notation is changed to (*, G), which indicates the
source address (any address) and the group address. 
Tree Building
Tree building is the process that is used to create a setup of multicast con-
nections that link the source(s) to the multicast group members. Multicast
trees can be dynamically created as users are added to a multicast group
(data driven) or they may be pre-setup before group members begin to par-
ticipate (control driven).
Trees are setup to ensure loop free distribution. If multicast trees were not
established, forwarding paths may be setup to allow data to loop from the
source back to the source. Loop free is a network that contains connections
that transfer information to locations different than its source location (the
connection path does not return to the source).

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Data Driven Tree Building
Data driven tree building is the process of creating the tree or branches of
the tree as new members are discovered or when join requests are received.
Examples of data driven tree building include distance vector based trees or
shortest path multicast trees.
Control Driven Tree Building
Control driven tree building is the process of establishing a tree before group
members begin to participate in the multicast session. An example of con-
trol driven tree building is the use of a core based tree (CBT) to establish a
multicast distribution backbone between multiple multicast distribution
domains.
Volatile Tree Structure
A volatile tree structure is a set of connection paths in a multicast tree that
continually change over time.
Route Flapping
Route flapping is the continual changing of a network connection path that
results from an intermittent congestion or loss of circuit connection that
indicates to the current router connection path that there is a loss in con-
nection or that a better connection path exists. This causes the packet rout-
ing path to continually change. These different paths can result in signifi-
cant variance in transmission delay times (excessive jitter). Router flapping
is overcome by newer IPV6 protocols and reservation protocols.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Core Based Trees (CBT)
Core based trees are a distribution structure for sparse mode multicasting
in a data network. For CBT systems, new group members send join mes-
sages to a designated core router. Any routers that the join message passes
along the way also begin to relay the multicast join request message. This
builds a tree up as the packets move to the core. CBT is described in RFC
2189.
Core based trees are a distribution structure for sparse mode multicasting
in a data network. For CBT systems, new group members send join mes-
sages to a designated core router. Any routers that the join message passes
along the way also begins to relay the multicast. This builds a tree up as the
packets move to the core. 
CBT systems require that routers store tree state information, which limits
the ability of CBT trees to be used (scaled) for large distribution systems.
Because routers store CBT tree information, CBT trees can be bidirectional
trees allowing data to flow in either direction between the source and the
members in the tree.
Because explicit tree routing information is stored in each router in a CBT
tree, the amount of processing that is required by the CBT router can be
small when compared to other multicast protocols which require path cal-
culations each time a multicast packet is received. 
Figure 1.11 shows how a core based tree is setup. This diagram shows that
group members send their join request to adjacent routers which forward
the request up to the root node (core) of the CBT tree. The core routers are
used to distribute multicast streams to non-core routers which forward the
data to other non-core routers which deliver the data to multicast group
members.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Join Styles
Join styles are the processes that are used to add members to a multicast
group. The join process may be explicit or implicit.
Explicit Joins
Explicit joins require the group member to acknowledge or initiate commu-
nication with the multicast router or group manager to join a multicast ses-
sion
-24-

Introduction to Data Multicasting
Figure 1.11, Core Based Tree

Implicit Joins
Implicit joins allow the group member to receive and process multicast ses-
sions without the need to acknowledge or communicate with the multicast
router or group manager to participate in a multicast session.
Multicast Routing Table
A multicast routing table is a list (a database table) that is located within a
router capable of multicasting that is used to determine which multicast
packets will be copied and what addresses they should be forwarding to.
Multicast Forwarding
Multicast forwarding is the process of receiving data packets, checking mul-
ticast routing tables to determine if the packet should be forwarded and cop-
ing and sending data packets to paths or destinations that are identified in
the multicast routing tables.
Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)
Reverse path forwarding is the process of forwarding the transmission of
data packets to paths that are downstream (in a forward direction) in a data
communication system. Reverse path forwarding operates by reviewing the
source and destination addresses of the data packet to its routing table to
determine if the destination address is not located between the source and
the current router address. If the address is not between the source and the
current router (in the forward path), the packet can be forwarded towards
its destination.
-25-
Copyright ©, 2008, ALTHOS, Inc
Introduction to Data Multicasting

Reverse path forwarding check is the process of comparing the source of a
packet and the incoming port or path to determine if the packet has been
sent from a router that is upstream (between the router and the source) or
downstream (from a router that is after the router). RPF is used to only
accept multicast packet requests from upstream routers to avoid the possi-
bility of data communication loops.
Forwarding loop is a sequence of packet transmission through routers that
eventually brings it back to its originating points. A time to live (TTL)
counter can be used in a data packet that discards the packet after a num-
ber of forwarding steps to disable the potential of forwarding loops.
Figure 1.12 shows how a reverse path forwarding check is used to prevent
the potential for data communication loops in multicast networks. This
example shows a data communication network that has multiple media
servers (M1 and M2) that are connected to the data network. Media server
1 has initiated a multicast session and routers in the network receive a mul-

ticast request packet. As the multicast request packet is received by each
router, the multicast routing table is checked to determine if the packet was
received from a source that is upstream (correct path) or downstream. If the
packet is received on a port that is downstream, the packet is discarded.
Ethernet Multicasting
Ethernet multicasting is the process of assigning a MAC address from a
range of Ethernet MAC addresses dedicated for multicast sessions that
allow devices to receive and capture multicast data that is distributed
through an Ethernet network. Ethernet devices that are part of a multicast
group will detect and receive packets that contain the multicast MAC
address. Each Ethernet device has a unique Ethernet hardware address.
Multicast Addresses Mapping
Multicast address mapping is a process of translating multicast group
addresses to the addresses of specific devices within a network (such as
Ethernet addresses). When incoming multicast data packets are received,
the multicast mapping process identifies the destination addresses and
readdresses the packets for the destination devices.
Flat Address Space
Flat address space is a set of addresses that cannot be reassigned for other
purposes (such as subnetting).
Address Filters
Address filtering is the process of receiving packets and reviewing if these
packets should be processed or allowed to transfer through a device.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Address Ambiguities
Address ambiguities are the ability of an identification label to refer to more
than one device or service.
Figure 1.13 shows how IP multicast addresses can be translated (mapped)
into Ethernet multicast addresses. This example shows that of the 32 bit IP
address, 28 bits are used for multicast addresses. For the 48 bit Ethernet
multicast address, only 23 bits can be transferred from the IP address to the
Ethernet address.

Bandwidth Reservation
Reserved bandwidth is the allocation of a portion of transmission or pro-
cessing capability of a device or system for specific users, purposes or appli-
cations. Bandwidth allocation can be reserved and controlled in a device
using protocols such as resource reservation protocol (RSVP). 
Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
Resource reservation protocol is a set of commands and processes that can
be used to control the quality of service (QoS) for packet flow for specific
communication sessions in a packet data network. RSVP is primarily used
in real-time communication sessions such as video or voice services over
packet data networks.
Multicast Protocols
Multicast protocols are the languages, processes, and procedures that per-
form functions used to send control messages and coordinate the adding
(setup), management or removal of multicast sessions. Multicast groups
receive signals or information that is distributed content to multiple recipi-
ents or users. Examples of multicast protocol include IGMP and PIM.
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
Internet group management protocol is the commands, processes and pro-
cedures that are used to send control messages and coordinate the multi-
casting (simultaneous distribution) of data through an Internet protocol net-
work. IGMP is used to establish membership into a multicast group that is
operating within a network. Using IGMP, users can inform routers within
the network that they would like to receive media and control messages
from a specific multicast group. IGMP is defined in RFCs 1112 and 2236.
-29-

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Key IGMP messages include a membership query and membership report.
A membership query is a request for a device or system to identify the users
or devices that are part of their membership (e.g. multicast) group.
Multicast routers periodically send (typically every 1 to 3 minutes) them to
group members to determine if they are still interested in participating in
the multicast session. A membership report is a list of users or devices that
are part of their membership (e.g. multicast) group.
Figure 1.14 shows how Internet group management protocol is used to setup
and manage multicast communication sessions to a local multicast host.

Introduction to Data Multicasting
Figure 1.14, Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) 

This example shows that the IGMP manager sends a query requests to
group members to determine if they are interested (or still interested) in
participating in a multicast session. Group members send reports to identi-
fy that they are interested in participating in a multicast session. The mul-
ticast routers use the report messages to build their multicast router tables.
IGMPv1
Internet group management protocol version 1 is the initial version of IGMP
released in 1989 based on RFC 1112. IGMP sends membership queries
every 60 seconds.
Figure 1.15 shows the format of an IGMP packet, version 1. IGMPv1 pack-
ets contain a type classification which identifies the packet as an IGMP
report (join request) or an IGMP query (is the device still interested in
receiving multicast packets).
IGMPv2
Internet group management protocol version 2 is the second version of
IGMP released in 1997 based on RFC 2236. IGMPv2 added the capability of
devices to send leave messages.

Figure 1.16 shows the format of an IGMP packet, version 2. IGMPv2 pack-
ets contain a type classification which identifies the packet as an IGMP
report (join request), IGMP leave (disconnection request), or an IGMP query
(is the device still interested in receiving multicast packets). IGMPv2 mes-
sages also identify the maximum response time for the IGMP request.
IGMPv3
Internet group management protocol version 3 is the third version of IGMP
released in 2002 based on RFC 3376. IGMPv3 was a significant revision to
the previous versions. Some of the key features of IGMPv3 include the abil-
ity of hosts to use list to identify devices they are willing to receive traffic
from and the ability to block packets that come from sources identified as
senders of unwanted traffic. 
IGMP enables source specific multicasting which allows recipients to direct-
ly connect to the source of a multicast session rather than receiving multi-
cast signals through other distribution points (rendezvous points). IGMPv3
includes include and exclude modes of operation.

Include mode is a condition of a system or method of operation where items
or commands that are sent are used to add (include) additional services or
options. An example of include mode is the use of group management mes-
sages in a multicast system to identify additional multicast streams or ser-
vices that are to be added to a receiver.
Exclude mode is a condition of a system or method of operation where items
or commands that are sent are used to remove or block additional services
or options. An example of exclude mode is the use of group management
messages in a multicast system to identify additional multicast streams or
services that are not to be forwarded or received.
Figure 1.17 shows the format of an IGMP packet, version 3. IGMPv3 pack-
ets contain additional fields that can be used to define multicast sessions to

include to or exclude from its connection. This diagram shows that IBMPv3
packets can contain a set of include and exclude messages in the IGMP data
packet.
Internet Group Management Protocol Snooping (IGMP
Snooping)
Internet group management protocol snooping is the process of looking
inside packets for IGMP messages so that the router can update its multi-
cast routing tables as group members are added or removed from the multi-
cast distribution tree. Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
Snooping enables DSLAMs, PON Optical Line Terminals (OLTs) and
routers to passively monitor subscriber traffic in order to identify and prop-
erly assign multicast group membership. Access platforms incorporating
this feature check IGMP packets passing through, pick out the group regis-
tration information and configure multicasting accordingly. Via IGMP
snooping, multicast group traffic is only forwarded to ports servicing mem-
bers identified as belonging to that particular multicast group. IGMP snoop-
ing generates no additional network traffic, allowing carriers to reduce net-
work congestion.
Figure 1.18 shows how routers perform IGMP snooping. This example
shows that a router has IGMP snooping software that allows it to decode the
contents of each packet as it passes through the router. The router stores
the packet, decodes the packet header and determines if the packet contains
an IGMP message. If so, the router can use the information in the IGMP
message to update its multicast routing table.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Protocol Independent Multicasting (PIM)
Protocol independent multicasting is the setup and distribution of packets
in a multicast tree structure using protocols (such as OSPG, static routes or
BGP) other than multicast protocols. Protocol independent multicasting
uses existing routing tables to determine if packets should be copied and
routed in a multicast tree. This allows protocol independent multicasting
(PIM) to be implemented on networks that use different underlying proto-
cols. 
As multicast packets are received at the router, their existing routing tables
are used to determine if the address that the packets originated from would
be sent back to their source. If so, the packet has arrived from a node that
-35-

is upstream to the tree and the packet should be copied and forwarded to
other ports on the router.
Protocol Independent Multicasting Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
Protocol independent multicast-sparse mode is a data pull process that
builds a tree to all the potential group recipients through the use of group
join messages. PIM-SM can use any underlying unicast protocol to deter-
mine when new tree branches should be added. PIM-SM offers the most effi-
cient method of multicasting with the disadvantage of longer delays in set-
ting up the network.
Protocol Independent Multicasting Dense Mode (PIM-DM)
Protocol independent multicast-dense mode is a data push process that peri-
odically floods a data network to build a tree to all the potential group recip-
ients and then remove (prune) unwanted receivers in the tree. PIM-DM can
use any underlying unicast protocol to determine how the tree should be
constructed. The flood process may be continually repeated every 3 minutes
to ensure all new group members can connect to the tree. PIM-DM offers the
quickest method of setting up a multicast tree with the disadvantage of
increased network data congestion.
Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicasting Dense Mode
(Bidir-PIM)
Bidirectional protocol independent multicasting is an enhanced version of
protocol independent multicasting that allows one or more providers of con-
tent to send and receive data or media with one or more multicast receivers
(many to many). Bidir-PIM modifies the PIM protocol to enable and effi-
ciently transfer data in both directions.

Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
Source specific multicast is an extension to the protocol independent multi-
casting protocol that allows a multicast group member to define which mul-
ticast sources they want or don’t want to connect to.
Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP)
Border gateway multicast protocol is a protocol that is used to communicate
between routers to help determine the selection of routes for multicast pack-
ets over multiple network domains.
Multicast Listener Discover (MLD)
Multicast listener discover is the commands, processes and procedures that
are used to send control messages and coordinate the multicasting (simul-
taneous distribution) of data through an Internet protocol network version
6. MLD is used to establish membership into a multicast group that is oper-
ating within a network. Using MLD, users can inform routers within the
network that they would like to receive media and control messages from a
specific multicast group. 
Broadcast Media Distribution Protocol (BMDP)
Broadcast media distribution protocol are the commands and processes that
control and enable broadcast distribution systems (such as IPTV) to adjust
storage and distribution heuristically according to trends in subscriber
behavior. BMDP also provides a buffer against network jitter and greater
tolerance for peak bursts in traffic. And example of how BDMP operates is
the setup of temporary storage of a popular digital television program as it
is streamed through a multicast distribution system so that viewers can
watch the program from a local media server rather than having to recon-
nect to a distant media server.

Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)
Distance vector multicast routing protocol are the commands and processes
that assist a router in the selection of routes based on the distance between
connections. DVMRP keeps track of the distance of other connections
between routers in a network. DVMRP uses Internet Group-Management
Protocol (IGMP) to transfer routing information with neighboring routers.
A distance vector is a measurement of the length of a path between points
and the direction the path has (from its origin to its end). When used in net-
works, a distance vector may represent the length of a connection or the
number of routers between connection points. 
Distance vector routing algorithms are packet processing rules that allow
routers to discover, determine and use the distances of connection routes to
make decisions on how to forward packets. In general, distance vector algo-
rithms may require less processing power and memory than other routing
protocols. Distance vector routing algorithms may be more prone to the cre-
ation of routing loops and they are less scalable and less resilient than other
routing algorithms.
Multicast Extension to Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF)
Multicast extension to open shortest path first is a dense mode multicast
protocol that uses a routing process that chooses the next unused shortest
path when building a multicast tree. MOSPF routers make their forwarding
decisions based on its forwarding cache which is created from a shortest
path tree. A multicast forwarding cache is a temporary copy of a multicast
forwarding table that is stored in a router.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Source Specific Multicast (SSM)
Source specific multicast is a protocol that enables a multicast recipient to
request a connection directly to a multicast source rather than through a
single rendezvous distribution point.
Any Source Multicast (ASM)
Any source multicast is a protocol that enables a multicast recipient to
dynamically establish multicast connections to multicast trees.
Using ASM, a multicast group member indicates an interest in receiving
traffic from a multicast address. The multicast network then discovers
which multicast sources are capable of sending to that multicast address
(multiple sources) and sets up connections between the multicast sources to
that address.
ASM is well suited for groupware applications, which allow multiple people
to simultaneously share participation in projects or data editing and the list
of participants is not previously known and can dynamically change during
the groupware session.
Source Filtering Group Membership Protocol (SGMP)
Source filtering group membership protocol is a set of commands and
processes that can be used to allow for the exclusion (blocking) of sources in
a multicast tree.
Cisco Group Management Protocol (CGMP)
Cisco group management protocol is a set of commands and processes that
can be used to provide information to routers in a multicast tree about the

additions (joins) and removals (leaves) that occur by group members. CGMP
is used to remove or reduce the need to do IGMP snooping to find changes
in multicast group membership. 
Negative-Acknowledgment 
(NACK) 
Oriented 
Reliable
Multicast (NORM)
Negative-acknowledgment (NACK) oriented reliable multicast is a set of
commands and processes (a protocol) that are used to provide reliable trans-
port on unmanaged IP networks. NORM uses a selective negative acknowl-
edgment process that can be combined with additional protocol processes to
provide coordinated transmission between senders and receivers.
Multicast Transport Protocol (MTP)
Multicast transport protocol is a set of commands and processes that are
used to setup and coordinate the distribution of a source to multiple desti-
nations using underlying network protocols to perform the transfer. MTP
defines key member types including master, producers and consumers. The
master coordinates the ordering of the messages, the producer sends the
messages and the consumer receives the messages.
Router-Port Group Management Protocol (RGMP)
Router-port group management protocol is a set of commands and process-
es that are used to setup and manage multicast tree paths on a data net-
work.

Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM)
Pragmatic general multicast is a transport protocol that provides reliable
transmission of data on a multicast system. PGM operates on multicast
transmitters and receivers to identify and control the successful delivery of
data packets through a multicast tree distribution system.
Interdomain Multicast Protocols
Interdomain multicast protocols are commands and processes that can be
used to advertise and setup multicast sessions between different domains.
Interdomain multicast protocols are used to setup multicast distribution
systems in different systems or at multiple geographic areas within a sys-
tem.
Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP)
Multiprotocol border gateway protocol are the commands and processes
used by routers that are located between different networks to evaluate each
of the possible multicast routes for the best one before choosing the routing
path for multicast packets it receives and forwards. MBGP can be found in
RFC 2283.
Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)
Multicast source discovery protocol is a set of commands and processes that
are used to allow rendezvous points (RPs) to transfer information about
media sources between RPs in other domains (other networks).

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Anycast RP
An anycast RP is an application of multicast networks (MSDP) that can be
used to configure multicast routers for fault tolerance and load sharing. 
Fault tolerance is the ability of a network or sub-system to continue to oper-
ate in the event of a hardware or software failure.  Fault tolerant systems
are typically able to identify the fault and replace the failed component or
sub-system with another piece of equipment.
Load sharing is a process by which signaling traffic is distributed over two
or more signaling or message routes to equalize and efficiently handle traf-
fic for security purposes.
Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)
Multicast listener discovery is an IPv6 protocol that can be used to send con-
trol messages and coordinate the multicasting (simultaneous distribution)
of data through an IPv6. MLD is used to establish membership into a mul-
ticast group that is operating within a network. Using MLD, users can
inform routers within the network that they would like to receive media and
control messages from a specific multicast group. MLD is described in RFC
3810.
Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting (TRPB)
Truncated reverse path broadcasting is the transmission of broadcast sig-
nals or packets to regions of the network, which have receivers (group mem-
bers) that have indicated an interest in receiving the broadcast. TRPB may
be accomplished by using IGMP packets to determine which branches or
areas of a network have interested receivers and disabling or truncating the
delivery of messages to areas that have no interested recipients.

Multicast Session Management
Multicast session management involves session description, session
announcement, session initiation, and session control.
Session Description
Session description protocol (SDP) is a text based protocol that is used to
provide high-level definitions of connections and media streams. The SDP
protocol is used with session initiated protocol (SIP). The SDP protocol is
used in a variety of communication systems including 3G wireless and the
PacketCable system. SDP is defined in RFC 2327.
Session Announcement
Session announcement protocol is a set of commands and processes that are
used to distribute information about communication sessions. SAP is
defined in RFC 2974.
Session Initiation
Session initiation protocol is a set of text commands and processes that work
with applications (application layer) to setup, manage and terminate com-
munication sessions. SIP is a simplified version of the ITU H.323 packet
multimedia system. SIP is defined in RFC 2543.
Session Control
Session control protocol is a set of commands and processes that are used to
negotiate and initialize protocols that are used for communication sessions.
An example of a session control protocol is session conference control proto-
col (SCCP).

Multicast Security
Multicast security is the ability of a system that distributes data or media
to multiple people to maintain its desired well being or operation without
damage, theft or compromise of its resources from unwanted people or
events.
Identity Verification
Identity verification is a process of exchanging information that allows the
confirmation of the true identity of the user (or device). Identify verification
may be used to allow a service provider to decide to enable or deny service
to users that cannot be identified.
Hash Function
A hash function is a mathematical process that converts (transforms) a
block of data or information into an output value. Hash functions are one-
way processes that result in the output value (called a hash or digest) not
being convertible back into its original data or information form.
A message digest is a result of a calculation of a message (a hash) using a
known key and algorithm. 
Authentication
Authentication is a process of exchanging information between a communi-
cations device (typically a user device such as a mobile phone or computing
device) and a communications network that allows the carrier or network
operator to confirm the true identity of the user (or device). This validation
of the authenticity of the user or device allows a service provider to deny ser-
vice to users that cannot be identified. Thus, authentication inhibits fraud-

ulent use of a communication device that does not contain the proper iden-
tification information.
Security association is the setup of a relationship between two network ele-
ments that ensures that traffic passing through the interface is authentic,
unchanged and/or cryptographically secure (typically, through encryption.)
Non-Repudiation
Non-repudiation is the use of information or evidence that confirms that a
person or company has received or used the products or services that they
have ordered.
Encryption
Encryption is a process of a protecting voice or data information from being
obtained by unauthorized users. Encryption involves the use of a data pro-
cessing algorithm (formula program) that uses one or more secret keys that
both the sender and receiver of the information use to encrypt and decrypt
the information. Without the encryption algorithm and key(s), unauthorized
listeners cannot decode the message. When the encryption and decryption
keys are the same, the encryption process is known as symmetrical encryp-
tion. When different encryption and decryption keys are used (such as in a
public encryption system), the process is known as asymmetrical encryption.
Public Key Encryption
Public key encryption is an authentication and encryption process that uses
two keys (public key and a private key) to setup and perform encryption
between communication devices. The public key and private keys can be
combined to increase the key length provider and a more secure encryption
system.

Group Key
A group key is a value that can be used by multiple devices or users to
encrypt and decrypt messages.
Trusted Authority
A trusted authority is an information source or company that can issue or
validate certificates. A trusted authority is sometimes called a “certificate
authority.”
Feedback Implosion
Feedback implosion (a multicast storm) is the overwhelming of a data net-
work that occurs when multiple receivers provide feedback messages (such
as acknowledgement messages) at approximately the same time. Feedback
implosions may be avoided or reduced in severity through the use of feed-
back controls.
Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol (RMTP)
Reliable multicast transport protocol is a set of commands and processes
that can coordinate the flow of data in a multicast tree. RMTP also has the
capability to aggregate feedback acknowledgements at various distribution
points within a multicast network to reduce the potential of feedback implo-
sions.
Tree-Based Multicast Transport Protocol (TMTP)
Tree-based multicast transport protocol is a set of commands and processes
that organize group members into domains where each domain contains a
-46-

domain manager that is responsible for coordinating retransmissions that
are used for error recovery.
Express Transport Protocol (XTP)
Express transport protocol is a set of commands and processes that are used
to coordinate the transmission, reception and retransmission of packets in a
data network to multiple recipients (multicast). XTP uses NACK messages
to enable the reliable transfer of data in multicast distribution trees. XTP
can utilize different types of network layer protocols (such as Internet
Protocol).
Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT)
Reliable multicast transport is the processes that can be used to monitor
and adjust to ensure that multicast data is delivered within defined perfor-
mance requirements. Data reliability is the capability of a device or system
to provide error detection, error recovery and/or loss protection.
Protocols and other device functions may be divided into building blocks
that can be combined to enable key functions without all the implementa-
tion limitations of the protocols (such as limited scalability).
Reliability Mechanism
A reliability mechanism is the processes that are used to ensure the suc-
cessful transmission and reception of data or media that is transferred
through a network or device. Reliability is ensured through the use of redun-
dancy and redundancy options in multicast systems include spatial redun-
dancy and temporal redundancy.
-47-
Copyright ©, 2008, ALTHOS, Inc
Introduction to Data Multicasting

Spatial redundancy is the process of providing related or repeated informa-
tion within the transmission space. Forward error correction (FEC) is a form
of spatial redundancy where some of the transmission resources are used to
transfer redundant (error correction) information. Temporal redundancy is
the repetition of information over a period of time. Repeated transmissions
or retransmission requests and acknowledgements are forms of temporal
redundancy.
Error Detection
Error detection is the process of detecting for bits that are received in error
during data transmission. Error detection is made possible by sending addi-
tional bits that have a relationship to the original data that can be verified. 
Error Recovery
Error recovery is the ability of a receiver or decoder to recover from cata-
strophic bit errors or lost bits within the bitstream. For example, a decoder
may need to terminate decoding the previous bitstream segment and com-
pletely resynchronize with a new synchronization point with the bitstream.
The speed of error recovery may depend on both bitstream characteristics
and decoder implementation.
Error recovery processes in multicast systems can be centralized, distrib-
uted, or redirected to alternative packet repair nodes. Retransmission mes-
sages can be unicast or sent as multicast messages, which allows all multi-
cast receivers to have access to the retransmitted information.
Error Protection
Error protection is the process of adding information to a data signal (typi-
cally by sending additional data bits) that permits a receiver of information
to detect and/or correct errors that may have occurred during data trans-
mission. 
-48-
Copyright ©, 2008, ALTHOS, Inc
Introduction to Data Multicasting

Error protection requires the use of additional transmission bandwidth for
inclusion of error protection bits. Some transmitted bits are more important
than others. Multicast systems can selectively add error protection to media
streams using asynchronous layered coding (ALC).
Congestion Control
Congestion control is a process or set of processes that can be used to con-
trol the flow or processing of data in a system or network when the resources
used in the system may exceed its capacity to deliver that service.
Congestion feedback is the providing of information that describes the over
utilization or potential of over utilization of a network distribution system.
Congestion feedback may be used to adjust transmitted rate control or to
reconfigure receivers to reduce the congestion (over utilization) of the net-
work
Feedback Control
Feedback controls are actions or processes taken by a device, system or net-
work to regulate or adjust the timing and amount of feedback that devices
or services create.
Real Time Feedback
Real time feedback is the ability of a sender to receive feedback information
within a short time from when it was originated. Feedback timing in some
systems (such as multicast systems) may be controlled or delayed to reduce
the potential of feedback implosions.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Acknowledgement Implosion (Ack Implosion)
Acknowledgment implosion is the overwhelming of a data network that
occurs when multiple receivers transmit acknowledgement messages at
approximately the same time.
Crying Baby
A crying baby is a device or user that continuously requires attention or
maintenance. If a crying baby is determined, it can be controlled or recon-
figured to reduce the amount of messages or feedback data that it is send-
ing.
Flow Control
Flow control is a combination of hardware or software mechanisms or pro-
tocols that can manage data transmissions when the receiving device can-
not accept data at the same rate the sender is transmitting. Flow control is
used when one of the devices communicating cannot receive the information
at the same rate as it is being sent; this usually occurs when extensive pro-
cessing is required by the receiver and the receive buffers are running low. 
Ordering Guarantee
Ordering guarantee is the commitment or capability of a system to provide
the delivery of packets in the same order that they were transferred into the
network. Ordering guarantees may be assured by using higher level proto-
cols that can sequentially identify and reorganize received packets into their
original transmitted order.

Scalability 
Scalability is the ability of a system to increase the number of users or
amount of services it can provide without significant changes to the hard-
ware or technology used. Multicast scalability is the ability to provide mul-
ticast distribution and control capabilities when the number of users and
network elements is increased.
Late Join
Late join is the ability of a communication device to be added to a commu-
nication session after the communication session has been established. Late
joining is also called grafting.
Multiple Passes
Multiple passes is the process of sending data multiple times to the same
device. This allows the receiving device to capture and combine data from
one pass with data from another pass to construct a complete or more com-
plete packet or block of data.
Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC)
Asynchronous layered coding is a forward error correction (FEC) transmis-
sion process that sends FEC information on multiple layers which allows
receives to successfully recover information without the need for direct feed-
back.

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM)
Scalable reliable multicast is a media distribution system that provides
group media distribution on a best effort basis. SRM uses multicast retrans-
mission, local recovery and implosion avoidance techniques to ensure the
multicast session can reliably operate even when there are many multicast
group members.
Retransmissions are multicast which allows other recipients to receive cor-
rective information without the need to send retransmission requests.
Repair requests can be limited to local recovery groups to minimize network
traffic. Other signaling control processes can be used to reduce the potential
of the simultaneous sending of retransmission requests resulting in network
implosion (such as the use of backoff timers).
Multicast Quality of Service (QoS)
Multicast quality of service (QoS) is one or more measurements of desired
performance and priorities of a communications system. Multicast QoS may
be managed or controlled through the use of bandwidth allocation, path
precedence, resource reservation and class based controls.
Bandwidth Allocation
Bandwidth allocation is the frequency width of a radio channel in Hertz
(high and low frequency limits) that can be modulated (changed) to transfer
information (voice or data signals). The amount and type of information
being sent determines the amount of bandwidth used and the method of
modulation used to impose the information on the radio signal.
Retransmission
Retransmission is a method of network error control in which hosts receiv-
ing messages acknowledge the receipt of correct messages and either do not
-52-
Copyright ©, 2008, ALTHOS, Inc
Introduction to Data Multicasting

acknowledge or acknowledge in the negative the receipt of incorrect mes-
sages. The lack of acknowledgment, or receipt of negative acknowledgment,
is an indication to the sending host that it should transmit the failed mes-
sage again.
Path Precedence
Path precedence is categorization and prioritization of connection paths
through a network or switching system.
IP Precedence utilizes the 3 precedence bits in the Type-of-Service (TOS)
field in the IP header to specify class of service assignment for each IP pack-
et. IP Precedence provides considerable flexibility for precedence assign-
ment including customer assignment (e.g. by application) and network
assignment based on IP or MAC address, physical port, or application. IP
Precedence enables the network to act either in passive mode (accepting
precedence assigned by the customer) or in active mode utilizing defined
policies to either set or override the precedence assignment. IP Precedence
can be mapped into adjacent technologies (e.g. Frame Relay or ATM) to
deliver end-to-end QoS policies in a heterogeneous network environment.
Thus, IP Precedence enables service classes to be established with no
changes to existing applications and with no complicated network signaling
requirements.
Resource Reservation
Resource reservation protocol is a set of commands and processes that can
be used to control the quality of service (QoS) for packet flow for specific
communication sessions in a packet data network. RSVP is primarily used
in real-time communication sessions such as video or voice services over
packet data networks.
-53-
Copyright ©, 2008, ALTHOS, Inc
Introduction to Data Multicasting

Multicast resource reservation involves the requesting of resources, receiv-
ing acknowledgement that the reservation has been accepted, modified or
rejected and releasing resources when users disconnect or the session has
ended.
For multicast systems, resources are requested and assigned dynamically as
trees are grown, leaves are added (new group recipients), and leaves are
removed (users disconnect from the multicast session).
Service Classes
Service classes are sets of communication parameters that are used or
assigned to provide transmission flows that can provide services that meet
specific quality of service (QoS) requirements.
Class of service is the communication parameters that are assigned or asso-
ciated with a particular application or communication session. The class of
service usually requires a specific quality of service (QoS) level.
Class based queuing is a priority scheduling method that gives preferential
treatment traffic communication sessions that have different priority levels
for each class of communication session (such as real-time audio traffic and
near-real time video). CBQ allocates variable bandwidth for each class of
traffic so all applications continue to operate under heavy traffic conditions.
Guaranteed Service
Guaranteed service provides a specific bandwidth with a set maximum end-
to-end transmission delay time. Guaranteed service may involve the alloca-
tion of dedicated resources (such as packet processing capacity in routers)
that ensures that services are provided within agreed performance limits
(such as maximum delay and error rates).
-54-

Introduction to Data Multicasting

Controlled Service
A controlled service is the providing of information transfer, processes or
authorizations that enable users, devices or systems to perform actions that
they desire where the processes or operations are monitored and adjusted to
meet desired criteria such as the maximum delay or the peak amount of
data transmission. 
Best Effort
Best effort is a level of service in a communications system that doesn’t have
a guaranteed level of quality of service (QoS). 
Congestion Control
Congestion control is a process or set of processes that can be used to con-
trol the flow or processing of data in a system or network. Congestion con-
trol may be coordinated through the use of a packet scheduler. A packet
scheduler is a device or function that can identify, prioritize, and coordinate
a time that packets should be transmitted.
Admission Control
Admission control is the process of reviewing the service authorization level
associated with users and determining how much network resources will be
allocated if the network resources are available. Admission control is used
to adjust, limit or assign the use of limited network resources to specific
types or individual users. Access control may allow for the assignment of
higher access level priority for specific types of users such as public safety
users.

Gridcasting
Grid casting is the process of transmitting media channels to a number of
users through the use of nodes that receive and redistribute (copying media
channels) as they progress through a network.
Peercasting
Peercasting is the process of transmitting media channels to a number of
users were media is received and redistributed by peers as it progresses
through the network. Peercasting systems define how users can discover,
connect and transmit from and to other peers within the network.
Figure 1.19 shows how a peercasting system can operate. This example
shows that a peercasting system retransmits signals from one receiver to
-56-

other receivers. In this peercasting system, end user devices receive, read-
dress and retransmit received packets towards a new destination device. 
Bit Torrent
A bit torrent is a rapid file transfer that occurs when multiple providers of
information can combine their digital data (bits) transfer into a single
stream (a torrent) of file information to the receiving computer.
Figure 1.20 shows how to transfer files using the torrent process. This exam-
ple shows that 4 computers contain a large information file (such as a movie
DVD). Each of the computers is connected to the Internet via high-speed
connections that have high-speed download capability and medium-speed

upload capability. To speed up the transfer speed for the file transfer, the
receiver of information can request sections of the media file to be down-
loaded. Because the receiver of the information has a high-speed download
connection, the limited uplink data rates of the section suppliers are com-
bined. This allows the receiver of the information to transfer the entire file
much faster.
Internet2 Network
Internet2 is a second generation of the Internet that uses a high-speed back-
bone communications network. The Internet system is a result of the next
generation Internet (NGI) initiative that is sponsored by the United States
government. Internet2 is seen as the way to deliver multimedia content (e.g.
video on demand) through the Internet.
Multicast Backbone (MBone)
Multicast backbone (MBone) is a high-speed data communications system
that interconnects with the Internet to provide multicast services. 
Routers in the Internet are not setup to provide multicast services. The
MBONE network is composed of interconnected networks that have multi-
cast routing capability that can be linked to the Internet. Signals from one
area of the network can be multicasted to other areas of the Internet. Once
the multicast signals reach the edge of the Internet, local networks can dis-
tribute the multicast signals to their destination.
The MBone system may interconnect multicast routers through the use of
MBone tunnels. MBone tunnels send MBone multicast packets through uni-
cast routers that are not capable of or setup for processing multicast pack-
ets. The tunnel provides a point to point link between MBone multicast
-58-

Introduction to Data Multicasting

routers and the multicast packets are embedded in the unicast packet pay-
load. When the unicast packet reaches its MBone multicast router destina-
tion, it is extracted from the payload and again processed as a multicast
packet.
Figure 1.21 shows that the MBone is a multicast enabled network that can
use multicasting to link multiple portions of the Internet with each other.
The MBone system can be connected to routers in the Internet. The MBone
contains multicast routers, which route the same signal to multiple portions
of the Internet. The MBone is then connected back to the Internet where
local routers can complete the multicast distribution.

Data Multicasting Constraints
Data multicasting constraints are limitations or tradeoffs that occur as mul-
ticast system options are selected. These limitations and options range from
the capability of routers to perform multicast operations to the delays that
occur when users change channels. Some of the key aspects to consider
when setting up multicast systems include the maximum number of mem-
bers, their geographic distribution, the type of application (real time or non-
real time), the service data rates, how long the session will last and inter-
activity requirements.
Router Processing
Router processing is the instructions that a packet routing device performs
to receive packets, lookup address routing choices in a routing table and to
transmit the packet towards its destination. Router processing can be influ-
enced by the type of routing protocols that are used (link state or distance
vector) and the types of routing (unicast or multicast). Router processing can
be used during calculation of forwarding addresses and updating of routing
tables.
Router Memory 
Router memory is the storage area in a routing device that holds informa-
tion such as unicast and multicast routing tables. Some multicast protocols
require routers to maintain extensive lists of tree structures and member
state information, which uses router memory.
Multicast Setup Time
Multicast setup time is the duration between the initiation of a multicast
service request (such as a join request) and when the service or action that
is requested begins to operate. The setup time for a user to attach to a mul-
ticast stream is called the join latency. Join latency is the time duration
-60-
Copyright ©, 2008, ALTHOS, Inc
Introduction to Data Multicasting

between the start of a multicast join process (such as initiating a channel
change) and when the group participant receives the media (when the new
channel begins to display).
Protocol Overhead 
Protocol overhead is the combined amount of data that messages consume
compared to the user data or media that is transferred by a communication
connection or service. Some multicast protocols use a higher percentage of
bandwidth for signaling commands.
Transmission and Control Delays
Transmission and control delays are time intervals that occur between the
sending of data or commands and when that data or responses to commands
are received. Multicast system control delays such as the time when media
flow control commands are initiated (such as mute or viewing pause) and
when the operation is performed can reduce the user’s quality of experience
(QoE).
Reliability
Reliability is the ability of a network or equipment to perform within its
normal operating parameters to provide a specific quality level of service.
Reliability can be measured as a minimum performance rating over a spec-
ified interval of time. Multicast reliability can be provided by using a vari-
ety of forward error coding and retransmission options.
Media Heterogeneity
Media heterogeneity is the ability of a communication system to process or
transmit media of different types such as digital video and digital audio.
Distributing different types of media (audio and video) over the same mul-
-61-
Copyright ©, 2008, ALTHOS, Inc
Introduction to Data Multicasting

ticast tree may result in high quality of one type of media (such as audio)
while another type of media (such as video) may have poor quality levels.
Group Management
Group management is the process of defining groups of users or devices and
adding and removing members (people and/or devices) to the groups. Group
management may need to perform over several domain groups, control
membership (access control), and provide tracking (usage) information
about multicast sessions.
Quality of Service
Quality of service (QoS) is one or more measurement of desired performance
and priorities of a communications system. QoS measures may include ser-
vice availability, maximum bit error rate (BER), minimum committed bit
rate (CBR) and other measurements that are used to ensure quality com-
munications service.
Late Entry
Late entry is the ability of a communication device to be added to a commu-
nication session after the communication session has been established. Late
entry is also known as grafting. 
Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to increase the number of users or
amount of services it can provide without significant changes to the hard-
ware or technology used.
