About the Author
Stephen R. Londergan has been on the collaboration bandwagon since 1989,
and this is his tenth book about it. During the day, he works for IBM, and lives
near Boston with his wife, Robyn, and three sons, Michael, Richard, and John.
In his spare time he enjoys writing pithy little paragraphs about himself.


Dedication
For my friend Cindy Pratt, who passed away in 2005. Cindy helped me out
when I was just a pup, back when Lotus Notes was a new baby, and the
entire, worldwide Notes team all fit in that one brick building, right next to
Boca Grande. Cindy’s sparkling intelligence and sense of fair play were evi-
dent to everyone who had a chance to know her.
Author’s Acknowledgments
My name goes on the cover, but lots of people had a hand in what you see in
this little yellow jewel. So I’d like to send a big WSE For Dummies shout out to
Nicole Haims, for making sure that I say what I’m supposed to say when I am
supposed to say it; to Jim Murphy of Strategic Computer Solutions for his
WSE, portal, and hardware expertise; to Professor Firas Yasin, for his just-in-
time expertise when I was up against a key and really tight deadline; to Mike
“the green monster” Loria, for his kind words in the Foreword; and to Karyn
Thompson-Panos, for making this whole thing possible, all the way from
Colorado.

Foreword
T
he workplace is everchanging — once an office you visited with your
briefcase stuffed with papers, it’s now a digital, virtual, pervasive place in
cyber space. The digital age is here and nowhere else is it developing as
rapidly as in businesses around the world: Letters are now emails; phone
calls are now instant messages; reports are now electronic presentations and
spreadsheets; and meetings are rarely face to face, but rather virtual encoun-
ters over the Web. With digital communications at our fingertips, we can
work from home, a favorite coffee spot, or just about anywhere. So the work-
place keeps changing, but the nature of work has not. We still need to share
information, collaborate with colleagues, support customers, innovate on
new product designs, take orders, manage complaints, and, of course, make
lists of all the things we have to do — only faster than ever before. Enter
technology, in the form of products like IBM Workplace Services Express, 
and we can not only perform all kinds of work in today’s virtual workplace,
we can significantly improve it.
This book captures two fundamental, important aspects of working with IBM
Workplace Services Express. First are the technical considerations — the fea-
tures, capabilities, customizations, and recommendations on how to use and
personalize your IBM Workplace Services Express system. Then, this book
goes on to provide insight into the business value and implications of apply-
ing this technology to your organization. You’ll see how capabilities in the
product can improve your business processes, streamline your operations,
provide better business control, and improve the collaboration and sharing
of information for your team, workgroup, or organization.
Stephen Londergan has been a pioneer in this industry from the early days of
Lotus Notes, through the first Webbased collaboration products, to today’s
workplace technologies. There is no one better to write a book on both the
technical and business considerations of deploying collaboration, document
management, and Web technologies. Steve has worked with companies of all
sizes across the world and has a rich knowledge of customer needs coupled
with a fine skill at explaining how to apply technologies to meet those
demands. Combining a recognized industry expert with an industry-leading
product makes for great reading; and more important, great opportunities for

Introduction
F
irst off, thanks for buying your copy of IBM Workplace Services Express
For Dummies.
The intent of this book is to provide you with an introduction to and overview
of IBM Workplace Services Express (WSE). WSE is a fairly new product (it came
upon the world at the end of 2004) that helps teams (both big and small) work
together, collaboratively and in real time, to get projects of all kinds (both big
and small) done.
What’s most exciting, in my humble opinion, about WSE is how it puts so
many tools and technologies in the hands of small- and medium-sized busi-
nesses — tools and technologies that have been traditionally only available
to large enterprise companies. WSE can help a little guy feel like one of the
big guys.
Foolish Assumptions
Without so much as a phone call, I make the following assumptions about
you, dear reader:
 You want to know what, but not necessarily why. I leave the why to the
computer nerds and concentrate on what’s important to getting you
working with IBM Workplace Services Express, ASAP.
 You have access to a server on which someone has already installed IBM
Workplace Services Express 2.5.
How This Book Is Organized
The arrangement of the chapters in this book reflects the order in which
most people become familiar with the various aspects of IBM Workplace
Services Express.

Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace
Services Express
In the first part of the book, I get a few of the inevitable definitions out of the
way so that you can jump right into getting WSE up and running. Reading
Part I is like finding out what all those dials on the dashboard are for before
you drive your brand-new car.
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features
The second part of this book deals with the things you’ll most likely use WSE
for the most. I focus on a couple of key features — the WSE Welcome page
(your home base for everything WSE related) and the People Palette, which
shows you how to find and (most important) communicate with teammates.
Part III: Getting Involved 
with Team Spaces
Team spaces are wicked, wicked important (as we say in Boston). So Part the
Third is all about how you can use team spaces and the contents you’ll find
therein. There are a lot of good chapters in this book, but those in Part III are
my favorites. You can find out exactly what team spaces are, use WSE tools 
to get them working for you, and communicate with teammates in ways you
never dreamed. (How about setting up a discussion forum to handle FAQs on
your newest product or having a chat room discussion in lieu of a five-minute
status meeting?)
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding
Documents
Almost every team produces documents (most by the ton), so Part IV explains
how you work with documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and the like. I
also use this part to explain the hierarchy WSE uses for organizing documents
in its document libraries so that when you need to find (or publish) a docu-
ment on the fly, you know what to do.

Part V: Making IBM Workplace 
Services Express Your Own
Part V tells you how to make WSE work just the way you want. Have it your
way, as the burger joints say. The tools described in this part show you how
to use forms to set up a team space. You also discover how to change the
way you view content, how to modify team space templates, and, if you have
administrator-level access, how to set up the access rights of the users on
your team.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens — so why should this book be
any different? Get easy access to a simple list that reminds you what you
need to do to make WSE perform for you, find out how to avoid pitfalls, 
and get specialized information if you’re a Windows user or a Linux user.
Part VII: Appendixes
Part VII contains some supplemental information that I couldn’t jam in the
first six parts — but these appendixes are worth a read, nonetheless. You can
find out how to set up your current mail program to interact with WSE, how
to set up the desktop components, and more.
Icons Used in This Book
I’ve scattered scads of little pictures (called icons) all across the pages of this
book. Read on to see what each kind of icon is about.
This icon tells you that some little shard of knowledge is coming your way to
make your life with WSE just a bit easier. Tips are definitely worth reading.
As you stumble along the pathway of life, these little commandments are
things that you should never forget. For example, you should always . . . 
well, it had something to do with, ummm. . . . I’ll come back to this later.

Introduction

Ignore these at your own peril. You’ve been warned.
This icon marks the items that will appeal to your inner geek.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book uses conventions with the idea in mind that if information is com-
municated in a standard way, it’s easier to understand at a glance. For exam-
ple, new terms are italicized, indicating that a definition follows. Here are
some of the other conventions used in this book:
 Anything you (the reader) are asked to type appears in bold.
 Web addresses (URLs) are listed in a special font, like this:
www.dummies.com
 IBM Workplace Services Express has a lot of clickable buttons, icons,
and links. In fact, anything that appears underlined in the program is
clickable. I differentiate between buttons and links by underlining links,
like this: Click the Hide Advanced Options link.
 If I ask you to click a sequence of menu options, I use a command arrow
(➪) to demonstrate the sequence. Think of the command arrow as
shorthand. For example, if I say choose More Actions➪Delete, I mean
click the More Actions button, and when the drop-down list appears,
click the Delete option. My way’s faster and more convenient, right?
Where to Go from Here
Okay, get going; you have a lot of reading to do.

In this part . . .
W
hen you start using any new computer software,
it’s best, as they say, to walk before you run. Start
with the basic information about how you get started, and
get a handle on the big picture about how the program
works. Needless to say, most people just jump in, start
using the software, make a ton of mistakes, get mad, and
finally, after some sputtering and fuming and complaining,
turn to the instructions.
IBM Workplace Services Express (WSE) is an innovative
and flexible program. The chapters in this part prepare
you to use WSE to its full potential without wasting a lot of
time, developing bad habits, or cursing the program
because you can’t figure out how to get started.
Of course I do my best to avoid techno babble whenever
possible, but sometimes actually knowing the official
vocabulary terms actually helps. If you call your help desk
and say, “The thingy next to the hinkyminky returns a box
that says something about a team space when I click it,”
you can bet three things: you haven’t been helpful, the
help desk can’t help you, and whoever answered the
phone at the help desk is probably laughing at you. Part I
is designed to orient you and give you what you need to
know to start using WSE.

Chapter 1
Collaboration, Portals, and You
In This Chapter
 Understanding collaboration and portal software
 Introducing IBM Workplace Services Express
 Getting more productive with IBM Workplace Services Express
I
BM Workplace Services Express is software that helps you and your teams
work together, collaborate, and share information. In the simplest terms,
WSE provides a team or project with a home page — so that all people, docu-
ments, and information about the team or project are collected and available
in the same place.
WSE has a lot more going for it than just its easy-to-use browser interface; 
it’s a flexible product that can be customized to meet just about any team’s
needs, and it includes built-in tools like instant messaging, document man-
agement, and a portal. With WSE, your team can work together in ways you
probably haven’t even dreamed of yet.
With most new software, there’s always a little bit of a waiting game — you
have to invest a certain amount of time in figuring out how to use the software
and customizing it to suit your needs. And with some types of software — 
portals in particular — you may even need to know a little Java and HTML
before you’re ready to get the most out of your new investment. Fortunately,
that’s not the case with WSE. Even though it is flexible and customizable, this
software comes preloaded with lots of templates and collaborative tools so
that you may not need to customize it at all — you’re ready to roll, right away.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on what this software does, and how it
helps you and your teams work better, faster, and more collaboratively. It
also shows you how to get logged in and ready to get to work.

Taking a Look at Collaboration Software
Collaboration involves working together. When people collaborate with each
other, they work jointly toward some tangible goal. In the world of software,
collaboration has taken on a special meaning — it’s a whole class of software,
different from all others. The two main functions of IBM Workplace Services
Express collaboration software are
 To help a team of people to work simultaneously on a project without
making a big huge mess. Most of us don’t work alone, and most people
would agree that most documents are improved if more than one person
helps to write and edit them. Unfortunately, that’s where productivity
software (like Microsoft Office) falls down — unless your team is all in
the same room looking over your shoulder while you type (which sure
sounds pretty annoying), programs like Word just aren’t so hot at help-
ing a team of people work together.
 To easily share the products of your work (documents and the like)
with a large group of people. You may produce the best report in the
history of your company, but as long as it’s buried on your computer in
C:\My Documents\reports\q4, you’re not getting that promotion and
raise. You have to either print that baby out and hand it to your boss, or
(more likely these days) e-mail it as an attachment. The bummer is that
the sharing part of this little exercise is different than the producing 
part — you have to use one program to create the document, and now
you’re probably using something else altogether to print it or e-mail it.
Collaboration software differs from productivity software (software suites like
Microsoft Office and Lotus 1-2-3) by extending its functionality. WordPerfect
and Microsoft Word, for example, help you produce really great word pro-
cessing documents — like press releases, resumes, reports, and letters to
your sweetheart. WSE helps you work on such documents with others, while
simultaneously making them readily available to anyone who wants or needs
to see your work.
WSE is special in the way that it combines collaboration technology with a
portal, while making both so easy to use and easy to swallow. Figure 1-1
shows a sample home page for a team, and as you can see, it’s chock full of
tools and information.

Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

Combining Collaboration,
Communication, and Document
Management
One of the best things about IBM Workplace Services Express is that it
includes a lot. The bottom line to the next few sections is that WSE brings
you a comprehensive set of tools, all wrapped up in a bow, and packages
them such that you are ready to hit the ground running.
Moving past simple e-mail
When you think about it, sharing a document with others — whether you want
them to add comments, help you write it, or just have it available as a refer-
ence — is an endeavor not well suited to e-mail. The minute you need more
Figure 1-1:

and ways to

Chapter 1: Collaboration, Portals, and You

than one other person to work on your document, e-mail just isn’t the answer,
because you get in a rat hole of wondering who has the latest version of the
document, who e-mailed it to whom, when it will be finished, and so on.
In this day and age, the files and documents you need to share are probably
pretty big — PowerPoint slides in particular always seem to take up multiple
megabytes, for example. So there’s another case where e-mail just doesn’t cut
it; e-mailing all those huge attachments around just leads to wasted disk
space and bloated, hard-to-manage inboxes. There has to be a better way.
All of these problems — working with a team to author documents, finding
ways to conveniently share and publish documents to a wide audience, and
overcoming the inboxes that are stuffed to the gills with giant attachments —
gave rise to a new kind of software, known as groupware. Think of WSE as
groupware-plus. It takes familiar groupware functions to the next level. Take 
a look at “Moving past discussion databases” for more information.
Many people think that the first and best groupware is a little gem invented 
in the early 1980s, in Cambridge, Massachusetts — known as Lotus Notes.
Rumor has it that there is even a really, really good book about this software,
known as Lotus Notes For Dummies (Wiley), written by this really, really 
great guy.
Moving past discussion databases
Groupware is a type of collaborative software that uses special shared data-
bases to help people share information and hold discussions. Discussions are
actually a pretty important part of the collaborative process — the idea of
being able to continuously talk about a document, customer, or project in
question (even across the miles, without making a special trip or picking up
the phone) is a really, really, big deal (RRBD).
Groupware is a beautiful thing, but it has a couple of limitations:
 Groupware usually needs client software that your company has to 
purchase, install, and maintain. Software like Lotus Notes, Microsoft
Outlook, and Microsoft Office is absolutely the right answer for some
people, but not all, especially when some of the people on the team
aren’t employees of your company. If you want to extend collaboration
to business partners or customers, for example, dictating what version
of Lotus Notes they need to use or expecting them to purchase and
install a certain version of Microsoft Office usually isn’t practical.
10
Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

WSE solves this limitation by being browser-based. That alone makes
collaborating outside your firewall easier, because you don’t have to pre-
sent your customers with a laundry list of software that they need to
purchase and maintain in order to work with you. WSE works with all of
the popular Web browsers — including Linux — so you can invite just
about anyone to your little WSE party.
 Although most teams and projects are very much about documents and
discussions, documents aren’t everything. Consider a sales team — doc-
uments such as requests for proposals (or RFPs) and product spec sheets
need to be produced, but sales staff also need access to other informa-
tion in order to be most productive. Maybe sales staff uses an Oracle
database to track sales transactions, and of course people always need
access to their e-mail.
WSE solves the second limitation by including a built-in portal, which I
discuss in the following section, “Knowing what to do with a portal.”
Knowing what to do with a portal
Collecting different kinds of software and applications together is the busi-
ness of portal software, often simply referred to as portals. Technically speak-
ing, IBM Workplace Services Express is based, in part, on IBM WebSphere
Portal software.
Portals are especially good at combining and aggregating information and
applications from many different places. Portals are just the ticket when you
want to give a person one place to go to access e-mail, and collaborative
team spaces, and document libraries, and Oracle databases, and so on. When
all of these electronic destinations are put together and use the same user
interface, you have a portal situation on your hands. The good news is that 
a portal can bring together information from just about anywhere.
The bad news about portals is that building such an animal is not for the faint
of heart. They can be complicated to build and manage. That’s really not that
surprising; any software that combines lots of other software and applica-
tions is, of course, going to have a lot of moving parts.
In the parlance of our day, portals are made up of and use something known as
portlets — which are pieces of code, used to connect to that other application.
A typical portal needs a portlet to connect to your e-mail system, another port-
let to connect to the Oracle database, a portlet for collaboration-related activi-
ties, a portlet for the document libraries, and so on.
11
Chapter 1: Collaboration, Portals, and You

The challenge with most portals is the age-old dilemma of time and money.
Creating portlets, even if you know how, takes development time, and is likely
to have you reaching for your wallet if you’d rather pay someone to do that
for you.
You’re not alone if portals and portlets sound a little scary. Creating your
own portlet usually requires pretty hardcore computer programming know-
how, deep database skills, and more than a passing knowledge of Java.
WSE includes a portal, and perhaps more important, includes a bunch of
portlets. WSE jumpstarts your team and projects, and saves you the time and
money of developing and maintaining all those portlets on your own. WSE
has room to grow — so if and when you do need to create your own portlets,
you can add them. But the big important point (BIP) here is that the built-in
portlets mean you hit the ground running.
Understanding What IBM Workplace
Services Express Does Best
The most important benefits of IBM Workplace Services Express are its speed
and ease of use. Because you can create new team spaces and WSE applica-
tions without knowing much about Web programming, you quickly discover
that the more you use WSE, the more you want to use WSE.
In fact, for most companies that use WSE, the software becomes an important
part of just about every project — a new project’s kickoff meeting may very
well include an action item for someone to “go set up a new team space.” In
most organizations, individuals usually belong to lots of different teams, and
the same is usually true with WSE — you belong to and have access to lots of
different WSE team spaces.
Essentially, a team space is home base, where all members of your team go
for anything related to your project. But there’s a lot more to team spaces
than that. I show you exactly what a team space is all about in Chapter 6.
So what is WSE good at? WSE facilitates projects and organizes teams in the
following ways:
 Providing a team home page so that everyone knows where to go for the
project’s status, milestones, and more.
 Enabling the collaborative production of just about any kind of document.
 Providing people with access to many different kinds of applications
through a WSE portal.
12
Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

 Enabling external collaboration so that your business partners or cus-
tomers have access to your team space, its documents, and so on.
 Enabling you to publish content so that people know where to go to find
policies and procedures, manuals, process documentation, and other
essential material.
 Improving your ability to track the status of your projects, enabling you
to keep track of all of the events, meetings, milestones, and tasks that
are part of the project — all in one place that everyone can access.
Putting the I(BM) in Team
A team is a group that works together toward a common goal. You probably
belong to lots of different teams, both at home and at the office. In one sense,
your entire organization or company qualifies as a team, as does your depart-
ment or division.
Teams also come together on a more ad-hoc or project basis — for example, 
a new initiative may require a few people from a few different departments to
put their heads together to find the best way to implement it. Ad-hoc teams
tend to be short lived — the team comes together to do what it needs to do,
then the team members do what they need to do, and then the team dissolves.
In many companies, teams and projects constantly form and dissolve. In fact,
the team that comes together this week may repeat what last year’s team did —
only this time around with different people.
No matter what kind of teams you belong to or lead, WSE has been built with
features to specifically support your functions, goals, and activities. For exam-
ple, WSE has functions that address the following common team activities:
 Content creation: Whether you focus on Office documents, Adobe PDFs,
computer-aided designs (often called CAD drawings), or some other con-
tent, your team probably creates a content product.
 Sharing: Your team needs to share information, content, dates, ideas,
and make decisions. ’Nuff said.
 Bringing people together: Okay, it sounds trite, but the people on a
team are the most important thing that any team has going for it. You
need to bring them together.
 Scheduling: Just about every team or project has a time dimension to it,
usually an end date when things have to be finished, and a series of
meetings and milestones leading up to that end date.
 Meeting goals: Whether it’s releasing a new product, responding to
some sort of market development, producing a new product, or helping
a customer, the very essence of a team is the common goal that its mem-
bers all share.
13
Chapter 1: Collaboration, Portals, and You

Most people find WSE ready to go, right out of the box, but customize it to
suit their own particular needs, over time. What’s important is that the prod-
uct offers the flexibility to adapt to your projects, and doesn’t force you to
adapt to it.
WSE enables you to focus on the job at hand. If you lead a sales team or
you’re an accountant by training, you can keep selling or keep accounting
without having to invest a lot of time and resources in figuring out how to use
WSE, or worrying about how your team and project need to adapt to WSE;
instead, WSE adapts to your team and your project.
Understanding the Benefits 
of Using a Server
The basic premise behind IBM Workplace Services Express is that you use
your Web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, or
Mozilla Firefox) to connect with a WSE server.
You probably won’t have to worry too much about that WSE server. Suffice it
to say that it’s a pretty powerful server (or maybe multiple servers) config-
ured and set up by your company’s IT department. In fact, one beauty of WSE
is that, because you probably get to be insulated and protected from all the
complicated Web server management tasks and burdens, you can focus on
getting your job done. You just use your browser to create team spaces,
exchange instant messages, and handle documents, without sweating all the
technical minutiae that’s involved in running the WSE server.
Here’s a list of benefits to using WSE on the server:
 Sharing is that much easier. Using a WSE document library or team
space is an easy and painless way to put documents in a place your
whole team can access, and a great way to make sure that all of the 
documents, people, and information about your team or project are
stored always available and in one place.
 You and your teammates can log in from just about anywhere and
experience the same work environment, windows, menus, and docu-
ments. Unlike other kinds of software, WSE is a lot more portable. No
matter where you are when you log in (work, home, Starbucks, Tibet),
what you see is always the same. As long as you have an Internet con-
nection and know your server name, username, and password, you’re
good to go.
14
Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

 You have new options for creating content. As you see in Chapter 12,
WSE comes with built-in document editors that give you new choices
and alternatives for creating content. Simply put, using WSE means you
might not have to purchase Microsoft Office for some team members.
 Keeping all those team spaces on the server means that system main-
tenance — like backups — is a snap. It also means your work environ-
ment is more secure, because your team’s important information is all
collected in one central place instead of being scattered over the indi-
vidual workstations of the team.
Have you ever left your laptop in a cab, or had it stolen? You (and your
team) are at much less risk that confidential information will be lost if
you use WSE. Should you drop your laptop in a murky swamp or spill a
pot of coffee all over it, your documents and information are safe and
sound because they’re not stored on your hard drive; they’re on the
WSE server.
 WSE servers can be set up for external access. That means that if your
team extends outside your company or organization, those business
partners, customers, or trading partners can also access and use team
spaces and document libraries. That’s not always something you want
partners to be able to do, of course, but the fact that it’s possible offers
some intriguing opportunities: Imagine inviting a business partner to
help you respond to an RFP, or imagine having a team space set up so
that your customers can log in and have direct access to your customer
service team and materials.
You can connect to the WSE server for many different reasons, but as you see
in Chapter 6, you’re most often going to use WSE to access a team space. If
you belong to many different teams and work on many different projects (of
course you do), don’t worry — you can have as many different team spaces
as you need.
Your WSE server has its own special address, which is just the Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) that you plug in to your Web browser. I can’t predict
what, exactly, your WSE server’s URL is going to look like, but it’ll probably
be something along the lines of http://yourcompany.com:9081/lwp/
myworkplace.

BM Workplace Services Express is server-based software that you and
your team access with your Web browser. Having all of your work and all
of the content related to your team on a server has lots of advantages, the
most important of which is that the server is a central location, to which the
entire team has access.
In this chapter, I take a look at the big picture, and see how you log in, and
when necessary, register to use WSE.
Getting Everything You Need 
on a Single Server
Chances are you’ll come to think of your entire collection of WSE team spaces,
document libraries, home pages, and so on as just another Web page, because
accessing them is just a matter of using a bookmark or typing a URL in your
browser.
But there’s a lot more happening under the covers. Part of the reason a lot of
companies use WSE is so that they don’t have to know about all the under-
the-hood technology that it takes to make WSE hum. However, at least a 
passing familiarity with the inner workings of WSE pays off in the long run.

In its simplest incarnation, WSE runs, self-contained, all on one server, which
uses the Microsoft Windows, Linux, or IBM iSeries operating system. If you
already have one of these operating systems installed, installing a new WSE
server is promised (by IBM) to take under an hour; after that, you’re ready 
to go.
Using a Second Server 
if You Can (Or Must)
The good news is that this single-server setup is incredibly easy to use and
manage, but the bad news is (or may be) that a single WSE server is really
only practical for the smallest business configurations. If your company has
just a few team spaces, anticipates small document libraries, and so on, you
are probably more likely to get away with a single-server setup than if your
business and teams are mid to large sized.
Here are some reasons to consider a two-server WSE setup:
 If you already have a directory server: The most common reason to
use WSE on more than one server is for the sake of a directory. Chances
are your company already has a separate directory server, which keeps
track of and stores everybody’s usernames, passwords, and group mem-
berships, among other things. Although WSE does include its own direc-
tory, it’s pretty common (and usually a good idea) to integrate WSE with
an existing directory server, such as the one that your company proba-
bly already has. Combining directories means less work for your WSE
server (one less thing for it to worry about, so to speak), and also means
that employees can log in with the same username and password they
use for all of the other applications and systems at your company.
 If you need bigger, faster team spaces and document libraries: All WSE
documents and information are stored in a database. Using a separate
server for this database frees up capacity on your WSE server, and also
means that you can have more people using the system at the same
time. Using a separate server for the WSE database also means that WSE
can handle larger document libraries and more team spaces.
You probably don’t have to worry about all these behind-the-curtain work-
ings of WSE. To most users, WSE is just a Web page that is easily accessed via
a bookmark. Whether your company has WSE configured on one server or
several, you always access it the same way, and you likely won’t know about
or care about the way your company has WSE set up. These details are very
definitely the province of your company’s overworked and dedicated system
administration staff.

Logging In to WSE
Logging in to your WSE server is the first thing you do whenever you want to
use WSE to visit a team space, view your e-mail, find and read a document in
a document library, or see if your teammates are online and available for a
chat.
As you can see in Figure 2-1, logging in to WSE is a fairly simple affair.
Follow these simple steps whenever you want to log in to your WSE server:
1. Go to the main WSE page.
Either type your WSE server’s address in your browser or choose your
WSE server’s name from your list of bookmarks or favorites.
I lack the power to guess your WSE server’s URL; someone in your com-
pany’s IT department will tell you what it is. 
2. Enter your user ID in the User ID field.
Your user ID and password are case sensitive, so watch out for that Caps
Lock key.
Figure 2-1:
Enter your
username
and
password to
use WSE.
19
Chapter 2: Start Me Up

3. Enter your password in the Password field.
When your IT department sets up WSE for the first time, you may
receive a default user ID and password. If you’re given a default pass-
word, you should change it as soon as possible.
4. Click the Log In button or press Enter.
Chapter 3 goes into details about what, exactly, you can expect to see after
you log in, but your basic WSE Welcome page probably looks something like
Figure 2-2.
You may have to set up your user ID and password yourself, or they may be
assigned to you. In many organizations, the user ID and password you use for
WSE are the same as the user ID and password you use for other applica-
tions. If you’re not sure what your WSE user ID and password are, ask your
project or team leader.

Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

Registering for the first time
Some WSE servers (usually WSE servers that are on the Internet and fairly
public) are set up so that you can register to use them yourself; in other
words, rather than having a user ID and password assigned to you, you get to
pick your own. You only have to register once, of course, on the very first day
that you use WSE.
If you’re not sure whether you need to register, ask someone before forging
ahead, because you wouldn’t want to register yourself if your administrator
is instead expecting you to use a user ID and password that have been cre-
ated for you.
Use the following steps if you’ve been told you should register to use WSE,
and that you should set up your own user ID and password:
1. Go to the main WSE page.
Enter your WSE server’s address in your browser or choose your WSE
server’s name from your browser’s list of bookmarks or favorites.
2. Click the Sign Up link in the upper-right corner of the WSE server’s
Welcome page. Refer to Figure 2-1.
3. Fill out the User Sign Up form to select a user ID and password, paying
special attention to the required fields.
Required fields are conveniently marked with asterisks. (See “Filling 
out the User Sign Up form,” later in this chapter, if you want detailed
information.)
4. Click the Continue button on the User Sign Up form.
21
Chapter 2: Start Me Up
What to do when (not if) you forget your password
When you forget your password, all is not nec-
essarily lost — your administrator most likely
has instructions on how to get a new password
issued. The first step is to click the I Forgot My
Password link in the upper-right corner of the
WSE home page. What you do next depends on
your company — you see instructions that
either tell you what to do, how to re-register, or
who to call to have a new password issued.
When you reset your password, take care to
choose one that is both easy for you to remem-
ber and hard for someone else to guess.
Including a few digits is always a good idea;
some companies even have very specific rules
and policies about the passwords you can use.
Making your WSE password the same as, say,
your ATM password is not a good idea.

5. If everything looks okay on the Sign Up Confirmation page, click the
Continue button again.
If you notice a mistake, click the Cancel button to back up a step and re-
enter any of the information.
6. Click the Continue button one last time to confirm your user 
registration.
After you complete this process, you’re good to go, and you can use the log
in process described earlier in this chapter (see “Logging In to WSE”) to start
using WSE.
Filling out the User Sign Up form
As you can see in Figure 2-3, the User Sign Up form has a dozen fields to be
filled out, some of which are required.

22
Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

The most important fields on the User Sign Up form are the ones marked with
asterisks; you have to fill out those required fields in order to register. But
unless you’re in a real hurry for some reason, you should take the time to fill
out the regional fields, too.
Here’s a list of the fields on the User Sign Up form, and some guidance about
what each field is used for:
 User ID: This is the most important field because what you enter here
today becomes the user ID that you use to log in to WSE every time you
use it. (You may want to rethink using snaggletooth as a user ID.) This
field is so important that your company may have guidelines and rules
for user ID formats. User IDs are case sensitive. This is a required field.
 Password: Pick a password that’s both easy for you to remember and
hard for someone else to guess. This is a required field.
 Confirm Password: Type your password again, just so that WSE can be
sure that what you typed in the previous password field is in fact what
you think you typed. This is a required field.
 First Name: This is what Mrs. Downey called you, in the third grade,
assuming you had Mrs. Downey in the third grade. This is a required field.
 Last Name: Your family name. This is a required field.
 E-mail: This is the e-mail address that your teammates will use, and also
that WSE will use. The WSE server may send you e-mail, so it’s important
that what you enter in the e-mail field is accurate. This is a required field.
 Preferred language: Select the language that WSE will use for the basic
user interface and documents.
 Preferred regional format: This field determines how certain fields are
displayed, such as currency and dates (do you prefer a dollar $ign, ¥en,
or £ pound sign?).
 Time zone: Use this field to select your time zone. What you select as
your time zone is used by the WSE server to adjust time fields to match
your preference.
 Preferred calendar type: What you select in this field determines how
team calendars are laid out.
 First day of the week: This field determines how team calendars are 
displayed.
 First work day of the week: This field determines which day is used 
as the beginning of the work week. For example, if your work week 
starts on Saturdays and ends on Fridays, you can modify your calendar
accordingly.

Logging Out
As with any computer system, you should log out when you’re finished or
when you will be leaving your workstation unattended; you wouldn’t want
some unauthorized person to walk up to your desk and post documents with
your name on them!
When you’re done using WSE, click the Log Out link in the upper-right corner
of the screen (see Figure 2-4). WSE confirms that you’ve been logged out, so
you can head out to lunch or go home. After logging out, it’s prudent to close
your browser too, although that isn’t absolutely necessary. The Log Out link
is on every WSE page, so you can log out no matter what you’re doing.

Dealing with the Inevitable 
Automatic Logout
Figure 2-5 shows what will happen to you eventually. WSE has a built-in fea-
ture that automatically logs you out after a certain period of inactivity — 
usually 30 minutes. This is a good thing because it means WSE will remember
to log you out — even if you forget. If you do find that you’ve been automati-
cally logged out — maybe you took a phone call in the middle of using WSE —
you can log in again and pick up right where you left off.
If you’re a WSE administrator, check out Chapter 15 to see how to adjust the
amount of time that passes before WSE logs inactive users out.

 Understanding the relationship between WSE and your e-mail
 Spicing up the interface with skins and themes
M
uch of the IBM Workplace Services Express interface is the same no
matter what the context; the menus, commands, and buttons are in
the same place and do the same thing, regardless of the task you happen to
be performing. That makes your life easier because after you figure out the
basics of how to use WSE, you feel right at home no matter what you’re
doing.
In this chapter, I show you how to navigate, search, and chat in the IBM
Workplace Services Express interface so that you can maximize your 
productivity.
As they say in the TV car ads, “actual mileage may vary.” That is, the user
interface you see when you use WSE at your organization may be a little bit
different than what you see in this chapter. But that’s okay. All the main func-
tions work exactly the same, so when you have the basics down, you’re good
to go.
Getting the Big Picture
Figure 3-1 shows a fairly simple WSE Welcome page, which probably looks
very much like the Welcome page you see when you log in to your WSE
server.

As you can see, the basic WSE screen is divided into two main parts: the
menus and navigators area and the work area. The work area is the biggest
part of the screen, and the work area is where most of the action is. In the
simplest terms, the buttons and menus toward the top of the screen help you
determine what you see in the work area, such as your e-mail, the Welcome
page, your team’s team space, and so on. Your actual work (your messages
and documents that you and team members have posted, and so on) appears
in the work area.
Figure 3-1 also shows a couple of important sets of buttons and menus, which
I discuss in the following sections.
Meeting the Navigation bar
The Navigation bar, usually located on the upper-left side of the screen, con-
tains the set of buttons you’ll use most often to move around the major areas
Menus and navigators

Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

of WSE. The Navigation bar usually has at least six buttons; however, the
Navigation bar that you see when you log in to WSE at your company may
very well have more or fewer (the number of buttons you see depends on
your company’s configuration of the software). In general, you’ll see
 Welcome: Click this button to visit the IBM Workplace Services Express
home page.
 Mail: If WSE is set up to connect with your company’s e-mail and calen-
dar system, clicking this button takes you to your e-mail inbox, and
(maybe) your calendar, and (maybe) your personal address book.
 Team Spaces: Team spaces are essential to your WSE experience. Click
this button to visit the team spaces for all the teams of which you’re a
member.
 Search: Click this button to locate information in WSE — documents,
milestones, discussion items, and even chat transcripts.
 Availability: Click this button to set your availability in WSE’s instant
messaging system.
 People Palette: Click this button to search for people, send invitations
to chat, and manage your Instant Contacts list.
If you encounter more buttons on your WSE Navigation bar, don’t despair; it’s
pretty common. The powers that may be — like the WSE administrator, for
example — may add more pages, for example, or even rename the pages and
buttons I describe earlier.
Meeting the toolbar
In the upper-right corner of the screen is the toolbar, which usually includes
six buttons:
 My Work: A Home button of sorts, this button transports you from
wherever you are to a list of all the document libraries without forcing
you to manually backtrack. For example, if you are knee deep in a spe-
cific document library but you want to see all your work, the My Work
button brings you back to the list of all of the document libraries.
 Templates: Click this button to create and manage the templates that
you use when you create and modify forms and team spaces. You may
not see this button if you’re not authorized to see it.
29
Chapter 3: Getting a Lay of the Land

 Edit My Profile: Click this button to change settings that control the
way WSE works for you. You can change your time zone, the language
WSE uses, your password, and more.
 Actions: Click this button to access a menu that enables you to create
and edit pages and/or to manage access rights of your teammates.
 Help: Click this button for a detailed index of help topics.
 Log Out: Click this button when you’re ready to go home for the day
(see Chapter 1).
Getting to Know the Welcome Page
When you first log in to WSE, the work area is taken up by your Welcome
page. Your WSE administrator decides, based on your role in the company 
or in particular projects, what your Welcome page looks like and contains,
which explains why your Welcome page may look different than those shown
in this book, and why your Welcome page may even look different than your
teammates’. The Welcome page is divided up into five distinct areas, known
as portlets.
Most of the portlets have control buttons in their upper-right corner. The
controls enable you to edit a portlet’s content, collapse or expand the port-
let, or remove the portlet from view altogether; I discuss the ins and outs of
using portlets in Chapter 4.
In Figure 3-1, the portlets are named Getting Started, My Weather, My Vertical
News, My Stocks, and Bookmarks.
Introducing IBM Workplace Services
Express and Your E-mail
Because the whole point of IBM Workplace Services Express is to promote
your productivity and streamline your team communications, you won’t be
surprised that WSE can be connected to your company’s e-mail system.
WSE comes with special tools (portlets) to connect to Microsoft Exchange,
Lotus Domino, or any POP3/IMAP e-mail system. That’s another way of saying
that WSE works with just about any e-mail program you can name.
30
Part I: Getting Rolling with Workplace Services Express 

WSE doesn’t have an e-mail system of its own. But when and if the time is right,
WSE is designed to connect to whatever e-mail system you already have.
If your WSE has been connected to your e-mail, you won’t have a new e-mail
address, you won’t have a different inbox, and you won’t have to do anything
different than what you’ve already been doing.
Understanding why e-mail 
may not be integrated
If your e-mail isn’t integrated into WSE, don’t be alarmed. In some situations,
e-mail integration isn’t appropriate for WSE. If, for example, you log in to a
WSE portal at a different company (maybe your supplier hosts a WSE portal
for you, or maybe you’re a customer who has been invited to join a team
space by one of your suppliers), it’s unlikely that your e-mail is included in
that other company’s portal. Or if your company has given you special soft-
ware to read your e-mail, such as Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes, your
administrator probably wants you to continue to use that software for e-mail,
and may consequently remove the Mail tab from WSE altogether.
Using your e-mail with IBM 
Workplace Services Express
If your WSE has been set up to work with your e-mail, you can find it by click-
ing the Mail button on the Navigation bar. What you see when you click the
Mail button depends, of course, on how WSE has been set up and what e-mail
system your company uses. Figure 3-2 gives you an idea of what your e-mail
interface looks like if your company uses Lotus Domino with IBM Workplace
Services Express.
This is the same old inbox you’ve always had for your e-mail; you don’t have
to figure out anything new or different in order to send and receive e-mail
messages.

Chapter 3: Getting a Lay of the Land

Finding Out about the Search Button
IBM Workplace Services Express includes built-in search functions that you
can use to find documents, information, and people. In fact, you’re likely to
encounter many different ways to search for stuff in WSE. However, the
Search button on the Navigation bar offers the most comprehensive search
options in one place.
As Figure 3-3 illustrates, clicking the Search button on the Navigation bar
enables you to find all kinds of information. You choose where, exactly, WSE
looks for the information you seek. You can use the Applications, Documents,
or Team Spaces tab to specify the scope of the search. Chapter 15 has all
you’ll ever need to know about searching in WSE.
The difference between the Navigation bar’s Search button and any others
you encounter is the scope; the Navigation bar’s Search button offers the
widest possible scope because it searches all of WSE.

Introducing IM Availability
One of the most innovative and useful aspects of IBM Workplace Services
Express is that instant messaging (IM) is built in to the product, and the IM
feature is available all over the place. As you see in Chapter 5, any time you
encounter a person’s name, say in your buddy list, document libraries, the
list of team space owners, and so on, you can usually initiate a chat with the
person by clicking his or her name.
The Presence indicator identifies whether a person is interested in talking.
The four designations are
 Available
 Away
 Do Not Disturb
 Logged Out
At any time, users can change their Presence based on their individual needs.

Keeping in Touch with Your Team 
with the People Palette
Click the People button whenever you need to interact with the members of
your team. When you click the People button, the People Palette slides out,
as you can see in Figure 3-4. You use the People Palette to do three distinct
things: find people, exchange instant messages with them, and manage your
Instant Contacts/Buddy List.

Using Page Menus
At the risk of jumping the gun a bit, take a look at Figure 3-5, which happens
to show the Documents page in a team space.
What’s important to notice in Figure 3-5 is the array of buttons on the left:
Marketing Team Home, Schedule, Documents, Discussions, and Search. As
you can see in the figure, Documents is selected and highlighted to indicate
that it is the page currently being viewed.
The point here, dear reader, is not so much about the particular buttons in
that list, or to explain the ins and outs of a document library. Rather, the
point is that some WSE pages have menus and buttons of their own. These
menus and buttons are usually listed on the left side of the screen. Just click
a button in a WSE page’s menu to open the page or access the function.

Chapter 3: Getting a Lay of the Land

Handling Themes ’n’ Such
The overall look and feel of WSE is controlled by WSE’s skins and themes, as I
show you in Chapter 15. Even if you’re not personally in a position to change
the way WSE looks by working directly with its skins and themes, you may
notice that your WSE looks different than WSE looks in this book, or you may
notice that the way WSE looks at your company on Monday is different than
it looked on the previous Friday. If that happens, your administrator probably
changed the skin or theme over the weekend.
Figure 3-6, for example, shows WSE using a different theme and skin. In this
case, the default gray and orange theme has been shifted to a lovely shade of
blue. There are pretty stars at the top, and you may notice a few buttons are
in different places.

ing system.

P
ages, pages, everywhere. The most important page you use in IBM
Workplace Services Express is your Welcome page because that’s the
first place you find yourself every time you log in to WSE.
Chapter 4 is all about using WSE pages in general, and using your Welcome
page in particular. It also takes you through the ins and outs of how portlets
and pages fit together.
Getting to Know the Welcome Page
When you first log in to WSE, the work area is taken up by your Welcome
page. Your WSE administrator decides, based on your role in the company or
your role in particular projects, what your home page looks like and contains,
and you may be able to alter its contents yourself. That explains why your
Welcome page may look different than those shown in this book, and why
your Welcome page may look different than your teammates’.
The Welcome page shown in Figure 4-1 is the default Welcome page you see
out of the box, as they say (not that software is sold in boxes anymore).
This prebuilt and ready-to-go Welcome page embodies, in a lot of ways, what
makes WSE cool. When you buy WSE, you get a Welcome page like this one
that’s fully functional, and that you (this is the important part) didn’t have to
create, build, or buy on your own. WSE is designed to get you up and running
very quickly, which you definitely can do, because you don’t have to worry
about creating your own Welcome page.

About WSE Pages, in General
WSE pages come in many sizes, colors, purposes, and guises. Some WSE
pages are fairly staid, such as the Help screens, or perhaps the page you see
when WSE has automatically logged you out. Other pages (the Welcome page
is a good example) are much more dynamic, because their contents change
based on your role, the time of the day, what’s happening in the stock market,
or maybe what new documents you and your teammates have posted.
The most exciting WSE pages are the ones that are collaborative in nature;
for example, the home page in a team space is chock full of information about
the team or project, as you see in Chapter 6.
A team space is actually a collection of pages related to a particular project
or team, and a team space for one team may have many pages, while another
page may have few. Most of the pages you use in WSE are built by IBM and
included with the product. That means that finding your way around one

40
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

page pretty much ensures you know your way around all of them. That said,
sometimes you use home-grown pages — created by you or someone at your
company. Chapter 7 discusses how you build and assemble your own pages.
Just because you can create a page from scratch doesn’t mean that you
should. Customizing an existing page to suit your own particular needs is usu-
ally preferable to creating a brand-new one.
Making Your Way through Page Columns
Most pages are divided into columns. For example, the default Welcome page
that figures so prominently in Figure 4-1 is actually made up of three columns;
the first has the Getting Started box, the second contains information about
the weather forecast and news, and the third has information about the stock
market and some Web page links.
Other pages have fewer columns, such as the one shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2:
This
document
library page
shows
content in
one big
column.
41
Chapter 4: This Is Your Welcome Page, and It Was Built Just for You

In this example, the page has two columns; one on the left for the Team
Spaces, Applications, and Documents buttons, and then a much wider
column on the right that contains, on this sample page anyway, a catalog of
document libraries.
Day in and day out, it may not be that important to you whether a given page
is divided into columns. In fact, you may not even have noticed that pages
are divided into columns if you hadn’t read all about it right here. But as you
see in the following section, the basic layout of a page — its foundation, so to
speak — is important if you need to add or remove portlets from a page, or
move a portlet from one part of a page to another.
You can use your browser to create a bookmark or favorite for any part of
WSE that you find yourself visiting on a regular basis.
Discovering Portlets
Any page that’s interactive in any way includes one or more portlets. A portlet
is actually a small computer program, written in Java. Some pages contain
multiple portlets that display information or are used to interact in some way
with a team space, document, library, or application.
You could use WSE all day long without ever knowing what a portlet is or
what Java is, and that’s half the point. WSE provides you with collaborative
team spaces and tools and all kinds of cool things like that, and now you
know that a lot of those cool things are, in computer terms, called portlets.
Understanding where portlets come from
Ninety-five percent (give or take) of the portlets that you encounter in WSE
are built in with the software from IBM. Just about everything you see on the
default WSE Welcome page, for example, is actually a portlet, as are the tools
you use to manage a team space member list, view the documents in a docu-
ment library, exchange instant messages with your colleagues, view your
inbox, and on and on.
There is also a special bunch of WSE portlets, called form portlets. These spe-
cial portlets are important to your use of WSE, and some of them get used in
just about every team space. Figure 4-3 shows the Marketing Announcements,
Members, and Links portlets, which have been collected in a page in a team
space.
42
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

Understanding why portlets are so cool
Portlets are so special for a few reasons:
 They come with WSE, which means you don’t have to create, build, or
buy them.
 They’re all designed to be very collaborative in nature; the good folks 
at IBM have built portlets to handle the most common collaborative
activities. For example, these form portlets can be used as-is, or modi-
fied to suit a particular project or team, as discussed in Chapter 13.
Form portlets aren’t just about providing information (such as the info
provided by the Weather portlet). Rather, they help people work
together. You can track vacation schedules, collect and graph survey
results, and more.
 You can make your own portlets. If you’re wont to do so, you can roll up
your sleeves, do a little Java development, and then use the portlet you
create with WSE.
Figure 4-3:
WSE

43
Chapter 4: This Is Your Welcome Page, and It Was Built Just for You

 You can download portlets for use with WSE; some downloadable
portlets are free and some cost some money. There are a ton of portlets
available, from both IBM and its business partners. If you visit the IBM
Workplace Solutions Catalog (point your browser to http://catalog.
lotus.com/wps/portal/workplace) and can’t find a portlet to suit
your fancy, you can find a business partner or consultant who’d be
happy to help you, for a (no doubt) very reasonable fee.
Working with portlets
The portlets in WSE function much the same way application and document
windows do in Microsoft Office and/or your favorite version of Linux GUI.
As you can see in the My Vertical News portlet shown in Figure 4-4, portlets
have an array of small buttons that are used to control the size and/or con-
tent of the portlet.
How much control you have over any one portlet is determined by your
access level, so don’t be surprised if some portlets you encounter don’t have
all the buttons shown in this list:
 Delete: This button removes the portlet from the page altogether.
 Configure: This button determines how the portlet functions.
Figure 4-4:
Every portlet
has buttons
that you use
to control
the portlet’s
size and
contents.
44
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

 Edit: This button usually changes or affects the portlet’s contents.
 Help: This button provides information about how the particular 
portlet works.
 Minimize: This button collapses the portlet so that only its title is 
visible.
 Maximize: This button makes the portlet fill the entire Web browser
window, and hides most everything else.
Figure 4-5 shows a WSE Welcome page with the My Weather and
Bookmarks portlets minimized.
Minimizing portlets and maximizing portlets is really only worth the
trouble if you’re working with WSE pages that are so packed with infor-
mation that you can’t see it all; this situation probably won’t occur as
often as you may think.
These portlets have been minimized.

Minimize
and

portlets to
control how

do (or 
don’t) see.
45
Chapter 4: This Is Your Welcome Page, and It Was Built Just for You

Those minimize and maximize controls come in handy, however, if you
want to print content from one, but not all, the portlets on a page. In
other words, you can minimize all the portlets except the one whose
contents you want to print, or, better yet, maximize the portlet you want
to print so that it fills the work area.
 Restore: This button reduces a maximized portlet to its previous state.
Moving portlets
Depending on your access level, you may be able to move portlets on a page.
If you’d prefer, for example, to have the My Weather portlet on the left
instead of the middle of your Welcome page, you can click and drag it to a
new location.
Use the following steps to move a portlet:
1. Position the mouse over the title bar of the portlet you want to move.
The mouse cursor changes to a four-headed arrow, officially called a
Move cursor.
2. Hold down the left mouse button to grab the portlet.
The mouse cursor changes to a hand and the portlet’s contents dim.
3. Drag and drop the portlet to its new location.
If the page has other portlets on it (as the Welcome page does), WSE
shows a big orange bar to indicate that dropping the portlet there moves
the existing portlet farther down on the page. For example, letting go of
the mouse as shown in Figure 4-6 moves the My Weather portlet to the
top of the second column on the page, and pushes the My News portlet
down, to make room for it.
Whether you realize it or not, this drag-and-drop business is a big deal. If WSE
didn’t let you drag and drop portlets with your mouse, you’d be in a world of
hurt, and up to your eyeballs in things like Java development, DHTML, and
Cascading Style Sheets every time you wanted to move the parts of your
pages around.
Adding portlets to a page
Depending on your access level, you also may be able to add new portlets to
a page. For example, say you just created a new team space, and you want to
add a different form portlet to the team’s home page. Adding a new portlet to
a page is easy.

Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

Use these steps to add a new portlet to a page:
1. Click the Portlet Palette button to maximize the list of available
portlets.
The Portlet Palette slides out, as shown in Figure 4-7. (Come on, admit it;
it’s cool.)
2. Scroll through the list to find the portlet you want to add to the page.
If you want to add a portlet that’s not in the list, scroll through the list
and select Add.
3. Drag and drop the portlet to its new location on the page.
When you move the mouse over the portlet’s icon, the mouse cursor
changes to a four-headed arrow. When you’re satisfied with the portlet’s
new location, let go of the left mouse button.
Depending on the portlet you choose, you may have to configure it before it
is ready to use.

Chapter 4: This Is Your Welcome Page, and It Was Built Just for You

Although WSE makes using and managing portlets — and even adding new
portlets to a page — easy, you may have noticed that I’ve made no mention of
how you create portlets. That’s no mistaken omission; WSE has tools for
assembling collaborative applications (that’s what you’re doing when you
add a portlet to a page, believe it or not), but WSE is not for creating portlets.
If you’re a Java developer, this means you can develop your portlet in a Java
environment. (May I suggest an IBM product such as Rational Application
Developer?) When you complete you masterpiece, you can then use it on a
WSE page, team space, or what have you.
Working with the MarketWatch Portlets
WSE includes a few portlets, in addition to the collaborative ones described
in the previous sections. These other portlets are provided by a company
called MarketWatch, and although they’re not free — you have to pay to use
them — MarketWatch lets you try them out for 30 days at no charge.
Figure 4-7:

Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

Three of these portlets (My Weather, My Vertical News, and My Stocks) are
automatically part of the WSE Welcome page, as you can see in Figure 4-1;
there are a couple of others you can use, too.
Forecasting My Weather
You can edit the My Weather portlet to add cities that are more interesting 
to you — your hometown, or perhaps your next vacation destination.
Use these steps to edit the contents of the My Weather portlet:
1. Click the Edit icon in the upper-right corner of the My Weather 
portlet.
The My Weather form appears.
2. Enter the name of the city (or a zip code) in the Add a City field; 
click Add.
You can enter as much or as little of the city and state (or city and coun-
try) as you know; WSE prompts you to make a choice if more than one
city matches your criteria.
3. To change the order in which the cities are listed, select the city you
want to move in the My Cities list and click the Up and Down links to
move it.
You can also use the Delete link to remove a city.
4. Determine whether temperatures should be displayed in Celsius or
Fahrenheit.
Simply click the radio button that corresponds with your desired tem-
perature scale.
5. Click OK.
Figure 4-8 shows the My Weather form.
Getting caught up with My Vertical News
The My Vertical News portlet gives you headlines and links to news stories
based on the topics you select. Some of the available news topics also
include an image or photograph, which, if nothing else, livens up your
Welcome page.
49
Chapter 4: This Is Your Welcome Page, and It Was Built Just for You

You can control the size of the image that’s displayed by clicking the portlet’s
Configure control.
You control the topics of the stories that are displayed to match your own
personal interests; simply click the My Vertical News portlet’s Edit control
and use the News Categories form.
As you can see in Figure 4-9, the News Categories form has a long list of news
categories, listed on the left; the Your Normal Selections column on the right
represents which topics are displayed (and regularly updated) on your
Welcome page.
If you see a topic that grabs your fancy, and you want to add it to your
Welcome page, select it and click the right arrow button to move the topic 
to the Your Normal Selections column on the right. You can Shift-click to
select items in sequence or Ctrl-click to select out-of-sequence items. To
reorder the topics on your home page, select the topic you want to move in
the Your Normal Selections column, and then click the Up and Down links to
move it. The higher an item appears on the Your Normal Selections list, the
closer it is to the top of the My Vertical News portlet.

Here are some other items you find on the News Categories form:
 Your Additional Maximized Selections: Scroll to the bottom of the
News Categories form to find this column on the right side of the screen.
You can add news topics to this column too, but these topics only show
up on your Welcome page if you maximize the My Vertical News portlet.
 With Leading Photo: At the very bottom of the News Categories form, 
you find the With Leading Photo radio button; click Yes to include a photo
on your Welcome page. Not all of the news topics available in the News
Categories column include photos, so if you really, really want a photo on
your Welcome page, make sure to select a category that includes a photo,
such as U.S. News, which specifies that it includes photos.
 Number of Headlines Per Topic (Normal): This field enables you to
specify how many news items are displayed for the categories you
choose for your Welcome page.
Resist the urge to pick too many categories or select too many head-
lines; your Welcome page is liable to be so full of news stories that it
won’t be much use for anything else.
 Number of Headlines per Topic (Maximized): This field determines
how much news is displayed if and when you maximize the My Vertical
News portlet.

Taking care of My Stocks
The My Stocks portlet keeps you on top of your (no doubt) significant Wall
Street investments. As you can see in Figure 4-10, you can click the name of
any of the stocks or indices in the My Stocks portlet to see details about that
particular commodity; click the Summary button to return to the summary
list of stocks.
When you need a quote on a particular stock that’s not included in your port-
folio, enter the name of the stock in the stock field and click the Get Quote
button. (You can also use the Symbol Lookup link if you’re not sure what a
company’s stock ticker symbol is.)

The My Stocks form appears.
2. Enter the name of the stock you want to track in the Add a Symbol
field and click the Add button.
Your stock gets added to the list.
3. If you want to reorder a stock, select the stock in the list and use the
Up and Down links until you’re satisfied with the order.
Use the Delete link to remove a stock.
4. If you want to track an index or indices, select them from the indices
list.
5. When you’re satisfied, click OK.
Staying on top of My News
The My News portlet is similar to the My Vertical News portlet, but it’s
smaller and contains topics related to particular industries. Because the My
News portlet is not included on the WSE Welcome page by default, you need
to add the portlet to the Welcome page if you want to use it.
Use these steps to add the My News portlet:
1. Click the Portlet Palette.
The list of available portlets appears.
You won’t find the My News portlet in this list.
2. Scroll down the list and select Add.
The Add Content form appears.
3. Enter news in the Title Contains field and click the Search button.
WSE displays all of the available portlets that match your search term.
4. Click the Select box next to My News and click OK.
The My News portlet is added to the list of portlets.
5. Drag the portlet from the list onto your Welcome page.
Figure 4-11 shows the My News portlet.
53
Chapter 4: This Is Your Welcome Page, and It Was Built Just for You

You can control the way the My News portlet is displayed and the topics it
presents by following these steps:
1. Click the portlet’s Edit control.
The My News form appears.
2. Select the topics you want from the News Categories column on the
left. Click the right arrow button to add them to the columns on the
right.
You can Shift-click to select items in sequence or Ctrl-click to select out-
of-sequence items.
The top column represents the topics that are displayed when the port-
let is normal-sized; the topics you add to the bottom column only dis-
play if and when you maximize the My News portlet.
3. Use the With Leading Photo field to determine whether or not the My
News portlet shows a picture.
Not all the news categories include photos.
4. Use the last two fields to determine how many headlines are displayed.

5. When you’re done, click OK.
WSE displays your Welcome page, and adds the topic(s) you selected to
the My News portlet. Whenever there’s a breaking story related to the
topics you choose, you’ll be in the loop.
Working with CT News portlets
WSE also includes a number of company tracker (CT) portlets from
MarketWatch; just like the rest of the MarketWatch portlets, they’re only free
for the first 30 days.
The company tracker portlets provide different kinds of information, related
to the companies and industries you choose; for example, the CT Profile port-
let displays profile data (address of record, executive staff, competitors, and
so on).
Like the My News portlet, the CT portlets aren’t included in the Welcome
page by default, so you have to add them to use them.
Use these steps to add a company tracker portlet:
1. Click the Portlet Palette.
The list of available portlets appears.
2. Scroll down the list and select Add.
Company tracker portlets aren’t included in this list by default.
The Add Content form appears.
3. Enter ct in the Title Contains field and click the Search button.
WSE displays all of the available portlets that match your Search term.
4. Click the Select box next to whichever company tracker portlet you
want; click OK.
The portlet is added to the list of portlets.
5. Drag and drop the portlet from the list onto your Welcome page.
All the company tracker portlets work similarly; you can edit them after you
add them to a page to specify which company or companies you want the
portlet to track. For example, Figure 4-12 shows profile and stock perfor-
mance information for a large and well-known computer company.

Keeping in Touch with 
the People Palette
In This Chapter
 Using instant messaging
 Finding people
 Managing your contacts
N
ot to sound like the guy at the front of the room at some new-age self-
help seminar, but I’m here to say that people are the most important
part of any team or project. (Okay, group hug, everyone . . .)
IBM Workplace Services Express puts the members of a team front and
center; as you see in this chapter, WSE thrives with team-related functions,
offering some pretty cool and compelling ways to use technology to enable
teams to interact. Without people, WSE would just be another place to dump
documents, and it certainly ain’t that.
In this chapter, I show you how to find and interact with the people on your
team, and how to decide whether and when they can interact with you.
Introducing IM in General
Instant messaging (IM) will change your life, or maybe it already has. Do you
remember the day you first started using e-mail? Or better yet, can you imag-
ine doing your job today, without e-mail? Instant messaging has as momen-
tous an effect on how you do your job as the e-mail revolution had. After you
start using it (if you aren’t already addicted), you won’t be able to imagine
how you ever did your job without it.

IM has grown up, in a lot of ways. When I met with CIOs, say, five years ago,
any IM discussion always began with why IM was more than just a passing
fad for teenagers, and why IM has real value for use in business.
Although IM has moved beyond justifying its existence as a way to reduce
travel expenses, reduce phone tag, and streamline communication, some
businesses still aren’t using IM to their full advantage. Teams operate more
efficiently, meet their goals quicker, and just plain get things done faster
when they can use IM to communicate.
If you ever used a program like Lotus Sametime, or one of the public IM sys-
tems like AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) or Yahoo! Messenger, you know the
drill; IM is a way to communicate, in real time, with someone using computer
technology and the Internet. You use the Chat dialog box to send, read, and
exchange instant messages, as shown in Figure 5-1.
There are two important things to know about IM as it relates to WSE:
 IM is built right in to WSE. WSE includes a built-in contacts list, and has
all the tools you need to interact and chat with your team in real time.
You can chat with one person or many, without having to stop what
you’re doing to switch to a different program to see your list of contacts.
Figure 5-1:
Instant
messaging
is built in to
WSE.
58
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

If you think I’m bragging that having IM functions built in makes it easier
to use, you’re right, but the benefits stretch beyond mere convenience.
Having a built-in IM program also means your company doesn’t have to
shell out any additional cash to purchase or license an external IM
system.
 As Jeremy Dies (world-recognized IM expert) once put it, WSE helps
you “think beyond the buddy list.” WSE affords many different oppor-
tunities and contexts to work together in real time, whether you use the
built-in contacts list or not. If you want to ask someone (perhaps the
author of a document you’re reading in a WSE document library) a ques-
tion, WSE makes that easy, even if you’ve never met the person before
and have no reason to include him or her in your list of contacts (called
the Instant Contacts list). One of the coolest features WSE sports is a
chat room (see Chapter 9), which is based on the IM program.
The bottom line is that saying that IM functions are built in to WSE is an
understatement. IM is ubiquitous in WSE. You can IM coworkers, team-
mates, and anyone else in your company without even trying, because
you always know an employee’s online status and availability. Any time
you encounter a person’s name, say in your Instant Contacts list, the
document libraries, a list of team space owners, and so on, you can chat
with the person with a simple mouse click.
Introducing IM Availability
One of the bedrock principles of IM is called availability, which is used to
indicate whether or not a member of the team is interested and capable of
interacting. Will Joe on the Sales team answer your chat message, or won’t
he? The answer is revealed in his availability status.
When Joe is home, asleep, obviously, he isn’t available, and WSE is smart
enough to prevent you from sending him instant messages. But when 9:00 a.m.
rolls around, and good old Joe arrives at the office and logs in, wouldn’t it be
nice to know, should you have a question for him, that he’s there, logged in,
sipping his Double Latte Grande Frappuccino, with just enough time to chat
before his next team meeting? That’s the essence of availability.
Figure 5-2 shows a document library — a list of folders, documents, and docu-
ment authors. Look closely for some of the author names and you see a little
green icon (supposed to look like a bust of a person’s head and shoulders)
that indicates that the person is available. He or she is ready, willing, and
able to receive instant messages.
Sometimes, you or a teammate may not want to be interrupted by an IM.
When that’s the case, you’ll know it. You can see that one of the authors
shown in Figure 5-2 doesn’t have the little presence indicator at all, and that
tells you that the person isn’t online and isn’t going to respond to your IMs.
59
Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette

To chat with someone who is online, simply click his or her name. A little
built-in menu appears, giving you the option to start a chat with the person.
There are actually four different states of availability:
 Available: The person is online, logged in to WSE and IM, and ready to
receive IMs.
 Away: The person is logged in to WSE, but isn’t paying attention to WSE
at the moment, perhaps he or she stepped away for lunch or a meeting.
You can still send this person an IM, but don’t be surprised if he or she
doesn’t reply right away.
Any message you send to someone with the little clock icon next to his
or her screen name stays on the user’s screen in the hopes he or she will
notice it upon return. Similarly, if you set your own status to Away, your
teammates can send you IMs, which you’ll find waiting on-screen when
you return.
This person is offline.

Names in
WSE are
live, and tell
you if a
person is

to chat.
60
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

 Do Not Disturb: This status indicates that the user is logged in to WSE,
but is too busy at the moment to accept IMs. When your status is set to
Do Not Disturb, no one can send you an instant message, and when you
see that your buddy’s status is set to Do Not Disturb, you’ll have to send
an e-mail instead. WSE won’t even let you send an IM to a person who is
“in” Do Not Disturb.
 Logged Out: When a user isn’t connected to instant messaging, you see
no icon or indicator. There’s no status at all. You can’t send the person
an IM.
Knowing about your teammates’ availability is important, but what about
your own? You have to decide whether you, yourself, are available. In other
words, do you want your teammates to be able to send you instant mes-
sages? When a teammate sees your name, how shall it be represented, 
availability-wise? Do you have that little green head, or not?
Setting your availability
Use the Availability button, located in the upper-right corner of the interface
(usually just below the IBM logo) to change your status. Figure 5-3 shows that
the Availability button has its own drop-down menu from which you can
choose your WSE status.
When you change your status, you yourself won’t see much happen, other
than the fact that the Availability button itself changes to reflect your say so.
However, as soon as you change your status from, say, Available to Away, the
icon next to your name automatically and instantly changes in all of your
teammates’ Instant Contacts lists, and next to your name in every document
you’ve authored, team space you own, and so on.
Figure 5-3:
Use the
Availability
button to set
your status.
61
Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette

Changing your message
When you hover your mouse over a person’s name in WSE, you see a short
message that gives you a little more information about the person’s status, or
maybe about his or her state of mind. The default messages are pretty ho-
hum and matter-of-fact. They indicate that you are available, have stepped
away, or don’t want to be disturbed.
However, you can change your availability message — what your teammates
see when they hover over your name — by following these steps:
1. Click the Availability button.
A drop-down menu appears.
2. Select Customize Status from the drop-down menu.
The Availability dialog box appears.
3. Select either I am Available, I am Away, or Do not Disturb in the
Availability dialog box.
4. Enter your customized message in the corresponding Status Message
field.
See Figure 5-4.

this
message to

62
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

5. Click the OK button.
The dialog box closes. Now every time a teammate hovers his or her
mouse over your name, he or she sees your message.
Introducing Live Names
One of the central and most innovative aspects of WSE is the way it enables
you to work with people. In any context, at any time, your team is available to
you. You can see at a glance who is online; communicating, instantly, with
someone on your team is as simple as clicking your mouse.
When you encounter a person’s name, you can interact with that person by
clicking the person’s name. Whether you’re looking at the name of someone
who appeared as the result of a search, the name of a person who created a
team space, or the name of a person who composed the document you are
reviewing, all you have to do is click. The technology that enables all this
interactive clicking is called Live Names. As you can see in Figure 5-5, when
you click a person’s name, you get a menu of options for interacting with that
person.
Figure 5-5:
Any time
you see a
person’s
name, you
can click it
to interact
with the
person.
63
Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette

Another thing you may see when you click a person’s name is his or her
directory information — like phone number and so on. Here is a list of the
other menu options sometimes supplied by Live Names:
 Show Person Record: Choose this option to see all of the information
that is in your company’s directory about the person.
 Show in Organization View: Choose this option to see a mini organiza-
tional chart, especially useful if you need to see who the person’s boss is
so you can rat the person out for doing a crummy job.
 Send E-mail: Choose this option to switch to your e-mail; useful if the
person is not online and you need to ask a question or make a comment.
 Start Chat: Choose this option to open a Chat dialog box and exchange
instant messages with the person.
 Add to Instant Contacts: Choose this option to add the individual to
your WSE list of contacts.
This idea of being able to reach out and touch someone any time is one of 
the most important and central ideas to WSE. In fact, instant access to team-
mates (whether they’re down the hall or on a separate continent) is crucial
and is the whole concept of team collaboration.
Keeping in Touch with Your Teammates
with the People Palette
Click the People button whenever you need to interact with the members of
your team. When you click the People button, the People Palette slides out,
as you can see in Figure 5-6. You use the People Palette to do three distinct
things; find people, exchange instant messages with them, and manage your
Instant Contacts list.
Most IM programs include what’s called a buddy list. Although the WSE refers
to its “Instant Contacts list,” you can call it a buddy list if you want.
Using the People Finder
The People Finder is an aptly named tool in the People Palette. Use the
People Finder to look up a member of your team. Maybe you need to find 
a person’s phone number, or you want to see if he or she is online and 
64
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

available for a quick chat. Perhaps you aren’t exactly sure what the person’s
name is, but you need to find someone in a certain department or division.
All of these are great quests to which you can (and should) put the People
Finder to great use.
You usually search for a person by name; conducting such a simple search is
a matter of following these steps:
1. Click the People button.
The People Palette appears.
2. Enter the person’s name in the Search For field.
Enter as much of the person’s first and/or last name as you can.
3. Click the Search button.
Figure 5-7 shows the results of such a simple search. As you can see, the
Search results show as much information as is available about the individual,
including the person’s full name, e-mail address, and phone number.
Figure 5-6:
Use the
People
Palette to

team.
65
Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette

Here are some tips for using the People Finder to go beyond the basics:
 If you need to find someone but you don’t know his or her name, use the
Search By list to pick a different field to match. You can search by name,
user ID, e-mail address, phone, department, or job title.
 When you get search results, you can use the Hide Details button if you
don’t need to see all the particulars. This is a useful option if a search
for John Smith resulted in several names. Hiding the details enables you
to make the list as concise as possible. (Of course, you may need to use
Show Details if you want to differentiate between all these Smiths.) Use
the Clear Results button to start a new search.
 If you need to find a person but you don’t know the person’s name, you
do have some options, as long as you have something to go on (hey, the
People Finder isn’t a miracle worker). If you know that the person is the
head of a department, or you know the person’s employee ID number,
that’s a start. When you click the Advanced Search link (it is just below
the Search For field), you see the Advanced Search form, as shown in
Figure 5-8. When you perform an advanced search, you have more fields
to use. Enter what you know about the person in the appropriate
field(s), and click the Search button to see whether you get any
matches.

Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

Sending instant messages
Instant messaging is all over the place in WSE; every time you encounter the
name of a person who is logged in, you can chat with the person without
having to stop what you’re doing or switch to another program.
Figure 5-9 shows a Chat dialog box, and as you can see, instant messaging
works pretty much the same way it does in other instant messaging pro-
grams. You type a message at the bottom of the dialog box. Click the Send
button (or press Enter), and your message appears in the Chat dialog box.
Most of the Chat dialog box is taken up by the transcript area, where you can
see what you’ve been talking about. When you look at the chat transcript,
your messages appear in blue text, while your teammate’s messages are black.
Figure 5-8:
You can use

functions to

67
Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette

Here are some friendly tips and tricks for using the IM functions:
 Quickly add hyperlinks: When you type a Web page URL in a chat
(www.dummies.com, for example), the URL automatically becomes a
clickable hyperlink.
 Invite others to the party: Use the Invite Others button when you 
want to ask someone else to join your conversation; you can use the
Directory Search dialog box to search for the name of the person you’d
like to invite to the chat.
Of course, you can only invite a person if his or her status is Available 
or Away. If the person is not logged in or if he or she sets her status to
Do Not Disturb, WSE stops you from sending the invite. Also, when you
have more than three or four people in a chat session, things usually get
out of hand pretty quickly. Figure 5-10 shows an IM chat with four
people; if you had 12, that’d be too many.
 End the chat with a click of the mouse. Close a chat and end your 
conversation by clicking the X in the upper-right corner of the Chat
dialog box.
Figure 5-9:
WSE

instant

68
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

When you end a chat, the conversation goes away, and isn’t saved at all.
WSE does include a facility called a chat room, which is like instant mes-
saging but does preserve a conversation’s transcripts after the conversa-
tion is over. Take a look at Chapter 9 to read more about my favorite
WSE feature.
Using (Or not) the Instant Contacts list
The People Palette includes a built-in Instant Contacts list, which you use to
keep your close contacts near and dear. The basic premise is that the people
with whom you interact with most often belong in your Instant Contacts list,
so that they’re always just a click away. You can also have groups in your
Instant Contacts list to help keep the names of your contacts organized.
You may be surprised to find that you will use the Instant Contacts list less
than you think; because names are live and chattable all over WSE, you have
less reason to open your Instant Contacts list when you need to ask someone
a question. Say, for example, that you’re reading a document that has been
posted to your team’s document library, and you have a question or need
clarification from the document’s author. You could, of course, use the People
Palette and your Instant Contacts list to see whether the document’s author
is online and available, and then start a chat. But because the document
already identifies the author’s name, and because the author’s name is alive
(it automatically lights up to tell you whether he or she is available), you can
just click the author’s name to get your little chat party rolling. For more
information about Live Names, check out the section earlier in this chapter,
“Introducing Live Names.”

Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette

But don’t dump the Instant Contacts list just yet. This handy list of buddies is
very useful in a variety of situations.
You can add a name to your Instant Contacts list in one of three ways. 
You can
 Click the user’s name and select Add to Instant Contacts from the 
built-in drop-down menu (see “Introducing Live Names,” earlier in this
chapter).
 Search the directory for the individual in question.
 Add the individual’s name to your Instant Contacts list by entering his or
her e-mail address.
Searching the directory to add a person 
to your Instant Contacts list
Use these steps to find a person in the directory and add him or her to your
Instant Contacts list:
1. Click the People button.
The People Palette appears.
2. In the Instant Contacts portlet, choose Actions➪New Contact.
The New Contact form appears in the Instant Contacts list.
3. Click the Find Person button.
The Directory Search: Find People dialog box appears.
4. Enter the name (or as much as you know of the name) in the Search
For field. Click the Search button.
The name(s) of the people who match your search term appear.
5. Select the name(s) you want to add and click the Add button.
You can add multiple names at the same time, and/or remove a name
you have mistakenly added.
6. Click OK.
7. If you want to add the new contact to a group you already have in
your Instant Contacts list, select the name of the group from the Add
to Existing Groups list.
For example, if you want to add Martha Stewart from Sales to your Sales
Instant Contacts group, select the radio button for that group.
8. If you want to add the contact to a brand-new group, click the Add to
New Group radio button and enter the name of the new group in the
Add to New Group field.
70
Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

The contact you choose is actually listed as the new group’s founding
member.
9. Click OK when you’re done.
Searching is the best way to add a person to your Instant Contacts list,
because you guarantee you won’t accidentally misspell a person’s name.
Using the Search tool also prevents you from adding the wrong contact (say
Martha Stewart from Accounting instead of Martha Stewart from Sales).
Adding a person to your Instant Contacts list 
by using his or her e-mail address
Use these steps to add someone to your Instant Contacts list by looking up
his or her e-mail address in the directory:
1. Click the People button.
The People Palette appears.
2. In the Instant Contacts portlet, choose Actions➪New Contact.
The New Contact form appears in the Instant Contacts list.
3. Click the Add by E-mail Address tab.
4. Enter your new contact’s e-mail address in the E-mail Address field.
5. In the Display Name field, enter the name by which you want the con-
tact to be listed in the Instant Contacts list.
You can add a nickname (Marti) or another identifier (Martha in Sales).
One distinct advantage of adding people to your Instant Contacts list by
typing their e-mail addresses is that you also get to use the Display
Name field. You have the power to change stephen_londergan@
dummiespress.wiley.com to something a little more user friendly,
like Steve L, in your Instant Contacts list.
6. To add the new contact to a group you already have in your Instant
Contacts list, select the group from the Add to Existing Groups list.
7. To add the person to a brand-new group, click the Add to New Group
radio button and enter the name of the new group in the Add to New
Group field.
The contact will be listed as the new group’s founding member.
8. Click OK when you’re done.
Figure 5-11 shows the Add by E-mail Address form.

Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette

Removing someone from your Instant Contacts list
If you find that you don’t want a particular person in your Instant Contacts
list any more, you can click the contact’s name in your Instant Contacts list
and select the Remove from Instant Contacts list option.
Banishing a person from your Instant Contacts list isn’t quite as antisocial as
it may first appear, because you can always chat with the person by clicking
on his or her name when you run across it in a document library, chat room,
or some other WSE cyber location. And if the person is ever back in your
good graces, you can use the steps outlined in the previous sections to add
the contact to your Instant Contacts list.
Adding a group from the directory
The quickest way to load up your Instant Contacts list with people is to add 
a group from your company’s directory. Chances are that your administrator
has already set up a group that contains all of the names of the people on
your team, for example, so adding that group is a shortcut to making an
Instant Contacts list that includes all your teammates.
Figure 5-11:

Part II: Making Use of the Main Features 

Another advantage to this tactic is that you eliminate some of that mainte-
nance work everyone hates. Ready-made groups that appear in your Instant
Contacts list are updated automatically, as your system administrator adds
and removes people from the master membership list.
Use the following steps to add a public group to your Instant Contacts list:
1. Click the People button.
The People Palette appears.
2. Choose Actions➪New Group.
3. Click the Public Group radio button.
4. Click the Find Group button.
The Directory Search: Find Groups dialog box appears.
5. Enter the name of the group in the Search For field and click the
Search button.
WSE displays all of the groups that match what you entered in the
Search For field. The Directory Search: Find Groups dialog box appears;
if you’re not sure which group to select, click the View Group Members
button to see the names of individual group members.
6. Select the group you want to add and then click OK.
WSE closes the Directory Search dialog box and displays the Instant
Contacts list.
7. Click OK.
Your Instant Contacts list expands to include the group you selected,
and displays the names of all the members. That’s a lot easier than
adding each name one at a time.

Chapter 5: Keeping in Touch with the People Palette
Got a big team?
If you have a big team, or a long Instant
Contacts list, the Actions button in your Instant
Contacts list can help in two ways:
 Choose Actions➪Show Online Contacts
Only. The list contracts to show only the
people who are currently logged in to the
WSE system. Most people use the WSE
Instant Contacts list this way, and if you think
about it a second, it just makes sense. The
reason you have a contacts list in the first
place is to chat with your teammates; so
when the person isn’t online and available,
why bother displaying his or her name?
 Choose Actions➪Collapse All Groups. The
contacts list contracts to show just the
names of the groups. Click the plus sign
next to the name of a group to expand it
again and see its particular members, or
click the Actions button and select Expand
All Groups to see all members of all groups.

Part III
Getting Involved
with Team Spaces

In this part . . .
T
eams aren’t just for sports players, these days. The
concept of a team has become almost a cliché, but it
is nonetheless important to WSE. You may belong to one
team or many, and your team may be small (2 people) or
large (2,000). Whatever the case or team size, WSE is here
to help you and your teams become more productive.
These next chapters guide you through one of the most
important parts of WSE: using team spaces. 
Caution: Reading Part III can lead to a frenzy of new ideas
and ways to work with your colleagues. By the time you
get to the end of this part, you’ll be wondering how you
(and your team) ever worked without WSE.

Chapter 6
Introducing Team Spaces
In This Chapter
 Discovering team spaces
 Getting started with team space templates
 Using the Team Spaces Catalog
T
eam collaboration is the very essence of IBM Workplace Services
Express, and so most of your interaction with your team’s information,
documents, and members happens in your team spaces. This chapter shows
you where team spaces come from, how you find them, and how to start
using them.
For even more information about team spaces (how to create them, and how
to use team space templates, for example), check out Chapter 14.
Getting to Know a Team Space
Figure 6-1 shows you what a team space looks like. A team space is sort of the
home page for a particular team or project; it’s the online place where every-
thing that’s related to the team or project is stored. (Got a kitchen sink?) All
the documents, information, schedules, discussions, milestones, and contact
info for key players are collected together in a team space and made avail-
able to everyone connected to the project or team.
No two teams are exactly alike, and no two projects are, either. That’s why
each team space you use is a little different in its design and content. Some
team spaces are relatively staid, with infrequent updates and relatively stable
content, while others are much more interactive, with daily (or even hourly)
updates, new documents being posted all the time, and what seems like con-
stant updates to the team’s calendar and tasks.

Creating a team space from a template
IBM Workplace Services Express makes starting a new team space easy
because you don’t have to start from scratch. WSE comes with about a dozen
team space templates, which are intended to jump-start your team or project.
The basic idea here is that because you’re so busy working on your project,
you don’t have time to build a bunch of pages or assemble all the collabora-
tive tools to support your team. You instead pick the template on which your
new team space will be based and modify it to suit your particular needs.
I really can’t think of too many scenarios in which you need to build a brand-
new team space 100 percent from scratch; you’re more likely to make a new
team space, based on one of the WSE team space templates, and then modify
the new team space to suit your needs. The good folks on the development
team over there at IBM put some effort into providing a variety of templates
that are most commonly used. Some companies (IBM business partners) sell
team space templates that they’ve created.
Figure 6-1:

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Templates save you time, which means your team is up and running quickly.
The bottom line is that team space templates put you one step ahead of the
game.
Here’s a list of the team space templates (IBM sometimes refers to them as
application templates, but that’s a little stuffy, don’t you think?) that come
with WSE:
 Chat Room: A chat room is a virtual place where people can have real-
time discussions. A chat room is similar to instant messaging, but chat
room conversations are automatically recorded, can be archived, and
are searchable.
 Customer Support Team: A collection of announcements, issue-tracking
tools, FAQs, and other functions that help a customer support team.
 Discussion Thread: A threaded discussion forum enables continued dia-
logue, but unlike a chat room, the dialogue doesn’t occur in real time.
You post topics to the discussion board at your convenience, and others
read your posts and reply when they have time, as well.
 Document Library: A complete document management solution that
includes versions, approvals, and integration with familiar desktop
applications.
 Employee Human Resources Site: This template provides an online
place for an HR team to share or publish announcements, links, FAQs,
and documents to the entire company.
 Event Planning: Plan group events, outings, and meetings with this 
template.
79
Chapter 6: Introducing Team Spaces
Building your own team space templates
If you run across a scenario in which none of
the existing team space templates can do the
job, you can make your own templates. If you’re
in a real bind, you can buy templates, too.
Say you’ve modified a team space to suit your
needs for the type of project that frequently gets
repeated. You could turn that team space into a
template of your own — that way, the next time
you start a similar project, you’ll be two steps
ahead of the game. See Chapter 14 for more
information.

 Human Resources Team: Use this template to create a team calendar,
employee directory, document library, and other tools to help a Human
Resources team.
 Marketing Team: Use this template to create team tasks, a team calen-
dar, document library, and other tools to help a Marketing team.
 Meeting Materials: A great template if you plan on meeting with your
team mostly in person; this template consists of a virtual location to
plan and organize meetings, and to track their results.
 Sales Team: Set up team tasks, a team calendar, customer tracking func-
tions, and other tools to help a Sales team.
 Team Project: Set up team tasks, a team calendar, a discussion forum, a
real-time chat room, and document management functions.
 Team Project, Extended: Building off the original, this template also
offers FAQs, links, vacation schedules, and project milestones, but is
intended to serve long-term projects.
Using the team space member list
One of the things that defines and distinguishes a team space is the list of
people who have access to it. You probably won’t have access to every team
space at your company, for the same reasons you don’t have to attend every
single meeting at your company. And if you wanted to attend a meeting in
some other department, you’d probably get stopped at the door.
Likewise, every team space has a membership list that determines who does
and who doesn’t have access. For those people who do have access, the
member list also explains exactly how much access the person has.
Most team spaces have at least three levels of access:
 Owner: The king or queen of a team space, who has the veritable keys to
the kingdom, is the owner. The owner can do just about anything in that
team space. The most important power this sovereign has is the power to
grant and deny other people access to the team space; his or her highness
can also delete the entire team space, if he or she is so inclined. Owners
can add and delete documents as well. Usually, the owner is a manager,
team leader, or project manager. And there’s only one king or queen of the
kingdom, so only one person is designated this supreme right.
80
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

 Moderator: A team space can have multiple moderators, and these
people hold a lot of water in a team space because they can grant and
deny access to other people, too. The other thing moderators can do is
delete documents and information that other people post. The only dif-
ference between a moderator and a team space’s owner is that a team
space only has one owner, who can do everything, including transferring
ownership of the team space altogether. Moderators, on the other hand,
are different because a team space can have multiple moderators, who
can do everything, except transfer ownership.
 Contributors: The most common type of person in a team space is a con-
tributor; the rank and file contributors can add documents to the team
space’s libraries and discussion areas, interact with others, post infor-
mation in the team space’s forms and calendars, and so on. Contributors
can’t grant team space access to other people, and they can only edit
and delete the documents and information that they themselves post in
the first place. You will probably have contributor access to most of the
team spaces you use.
Although some team spaces have even more levels of access (which are offi-
cially known as roles), it’s a pretty safe bet that you’ll always encounter at
least these three.
Getting to Know the Team Spaces
Catalog
The Team Spaces Catalog is the directory of team spaces to which you have
access, and it’s also where you go when you want to create a new team
space. The Team Spaces Catalog has a few built-in tools to help you manage
and organize the list of team spaces, which, in the likely event that your orga-
nization has many team spaces, may become big and unwieldy.
To access specific team spaces through the Team Spaces Catalog, click the
Team Spaces button on the Navigator toolbar at the top of the screen.
The Team Spaces Catalog, which shows you the team spaces to which you
have access, appears (see Figure 6-2).
81
Chapter 6: Introducing Team Spaces

Team spaces to which you don’t have access don’t appear in the catalog.
The list of team spaces in the catalog has six columns:
 Name: Every project or team has a name, and so does its team space.
The team space’s name is also the link you click to open the team space.
 Favorite: This column indicates whether or not you have selected the
team space as one of your own personal favorites.
 Template: This column indicates which team space template was origi-
nally used to create the team space.
 Owner: The name of the person in charge of the team space appears in
this column.
Figure 6-2:

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

 Last Update: This column identifies the date and time of the last change
that was made to the team space. Perhaps a revised document was
added, a new item was posted in a discussion area, or an out-of-date
contact was removed.
 Delete: If, and only if, you are a team space’s moderator or owner, you
can delete a team space altogether.
Click the column heading for the Name column or the Date column to have
the list of team spaces sorted by that column.
Accessing a team space
Opening a team space couldn’t be easier, because the name of each team
space to which you have access is a clickable link. Just click the team space’s
name to leave the catalog altogether and open the team space in question.
Searching for a team space
If you know a team space’s name but you can’t find it in the list, you can enter
the name in the Find Team Spaces field and click the Search button. The Find
Team Spaces field is at the top of the catalog.
To search for a team space by name, enter the first few letters of the name in
the Find Team Spaces field and click the Search button. The list of team
spaces listed in the catalog shortens to show just the team spaces that start
with the same letters. Figure 6-3 shows the results of a search that begins
with RFP.
This search feature is poorly named, because you aren’t searching, you’re
matching the first few letters of a team space’s name. For example, if there’s a
team space named 2005 Marketing Plans, and you enter Marketing Plans into
the Find Team Spaces field, the search won’t find it. You have to know and
enter the beginning characters of the team space’s name to use this feature.
Use the Clear Results button if you want to reset the list of team spaces that
you can see.
83
Chapter 6: Introducing Team Spaces

Sorting the Team Spaces Catalog
You can sort the team spaces with the Show drop-down list. Click the drop-
down list to sort
 All Team Spaces: This sorting option is pretty straightforward. These
are all the team spaces for which you’re a contributor, moderator, or
owner.
 My Team Spaces: These are team spaces for which you’re a moderator
or owner.
 Public Team Spaces: These are team spaces that are open to everyone
in the organization.
 Favorite Team Spaces: These are the team spaces that you designate as
favorites. See “Using and setting favorites” for more information.
Even when you choose to view all team spaces, you only see the team
spaces to which you have access. You can’t view any other team spaces.
Figure 6-3:
Use the
search
options to

84
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Using and setting favorites
If you find that there are certain team spaces that you use more often than
others, tell WSE that these team spaces are your favorites by clicking the
selection box next to the team space’s name and clicking the Add to Favorites
button. You can select more than one team space at a time. The team spaces
you select as favorites are always displayed with a check mark in the Favorite
column. Figure 6-4 shows the Team Spaces Catalog with two team spaces
listed as favorites.
Now you can use the Show menu to have WSE display only these favorites
(see “Sorting the Team Spaces Catalog”).
If your company or organization has only a few team spaces, or if you person-
ally have access to only a few team spaces, your list will be small enough that
it’s not going to be worth the trouble of setting up Favorites. This feature is
only worth the clicks if your personal list of team spaces is so long that it’s
getting unmanageable, and you need a way to shorten it. And if that’s the
case, boy, are you a busy bee.
These team spaces are designated as favorites.

Chapter 6: Introducing Team Spaces

Using the Team Spaces, Applications,
and Documents Navigation Links
Team spaces make IBM Workplace Services Express work. However, WSE
helps collect information in other ways and in other places. For example, doc-
ument libraries help you share and organize documents, and the more you
use WSE the more likely you are to create applications that connect WSE
with, say, an Oracle database or another external application.
The links to document libraries and such applications (if you have any appli-
cations, that is) usually appear on the left side of the WSE screen. The menu
enables you to choose from the following options:
 Team Spaces: Clicking the Team Spaces link takes you to the Team
Spaces Catalog.
 Applications: Clicking the Applications link takes you to available soft-
ware tools (usually, these tools are available to your whole company or
organization).
 Documents: Clicking the Documents link takes you to available docu-
ment libraries.
Most team spaces have document libraries of their own, which are specifi-
cally available to members of the team. You also have access to the system-
wide document library area of WSE. The document libraries in a team 
space contain documents and files that are related to that particular team or
project, while the document libraries in the larger WSE interface contain 
documents and files that are relevant to, and accessible by, your entire 
organization.
Check out Chapter 10 to find an introduction to WSE document libraries.
The WSE documentation considers a team space to be just another kind 
of application, albeit an application with a special, team- or project-related
purpose.

Working Together with 
Pages and Forms
In This Chapter
 Navigating a team space
 Using team space forms to view, enter, and share information
 Understanding what makes tasks and the calendar special
S
ure, every team space is a little different. But there are certain things that
are the same, in all of them. In this chapter, I explore how you master the
stuff that will make you a master of them all.
The stuff that you can master to call yourself an expert is made up of pages,
and forms. Pages are a lot like the Web pages you find on the World Wide
Web, but team spaces have a lot of them, and they’re a lot more interactive,
as this chapter shows you. Forms are built-in features that help your team
collect, organize, and display information about the project.
For basics on the different kinds of team spaces and form templates, check
out Chapter 14.
Checking Out the Layout 
of a Team Space Page
The most basic part of a team space is the page, which contains a series of
forms. Any given team space will have several pages, and any given page can
contain multiple forms.

Forms are sometimes called form portlets in the WSE documentation and help
screens, but I’ll just refer to them as forms, if only for the sake of brevity.
Forms contain items, sometimes called documents.
Some team spaces have many pages, and some have few, but every team
space has at least one page. The Team Space home page in Figure 7-1 has four
pages listed in the far-left column of the screen under the Marketing Team
Home heading: Schedule, Documents, Discussion, and Search.
The home page also contains three forms, located in the main part of the
page: Marketing Announcements, Members, and Links. If you examine the
Marketing Announcements form, you can see that it contains ten items, but
only five are displayed.
These are four separate team space pages.
Announcements appear here.
Figure 7-1:
Team

88
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Navigating from one page to another in a team space couldn’t be easier; just
click the name of the page you want to view. For example, Figure 7-2 shows
what happens in the Marketing Team Space when you click the Schedule
button; not surprisingly, you see the Team Schedule page.
The pages themselves are divided into large columns. For example, the
Schedule page in Figure 7-2 has one big column on the left that contains the
Team Calendar, and another column on the right that contains the Team
Tasks and Milestones forms.

Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

Having Fun with Forms
You and your team use forms to collect and display information in a team space.
You can create your own forms, but IBM Workplace Services Express comes
with several built-in templates, so you can easily start with (and modify to
your heart’s content) the forms that come in the box. See Chapter 15 for
more information about creating or modifying forms.
WSE comes with 19 of these built-in form templates, each of which can be
broken into important project-related functions. Although there are many
form templates in WSE, most of them work the same way, so mastering a few
key concepts makes you a master of them all.
Using forms to access and manage people
Here are some of the ready-made forms you can use to organize and interact
with the people who are involved with your team or project:
 Attendance: Helps keep track of who is coming (or who came) to a
meeting or event.
 Customer Contacts: Keeps track of customer names and addresses.
 Employee Directory: Enables access to contact and address information
about people in your organization.
 Prospects: Enables tracking of potential customers.
 Sales Tracking: Tracks the deals you have in the works.
 Sign Up Sheet: Enables employees to register for an event or project.
 Survey: You ask for information; team members answer.
 Issues: Helps track issues, whether good or bad.
Using forms to communicate messages
Here are some of the wonderful forms you can use and modify when you want
to easily communicate with people on your team about project specifics:
 Announcements: Used to broadcast important information.
 Agenda: Helps you plan and run effective meetings.
 Directions: Gives people info about where they need to go.
90
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

 FAQs: Displays frequently asked questions and answers.
 Links: Keeps track of Web pages that your team should know.
 Minutes: Used for broadcasting meeting minutes and go-forwards.
Using forms to manage your deadlines
Calendar-related options ensure that no one on your team can say, “I didn’t
know that big report was due Tuesday!” Here is a list of forms you can use to
manage your deadlines:
 Milestones: Keeps projects on schedule by enabling you to track key
events.
 Vacations: Skiing, anyone?
 Team Tasks: Enables you to keep track of who is doing what, and under
what deadlines.
 Team Calendar: The interactive team calendar enables quick and easy
updates.
Managing views
When you encounter a form on a page in a team space, you see either a sum-
mary of all of the items in the form or you see details about one particular
item. The summary of the items in a form is called a view. For example, refer
to Figure 7-1 to see the portlet’s display of the Marketing Announcement items.
You can click underlined column headings to sort the form’s contents.
Say you have many items in the Announcements portlet — so many that you
can’t see them all on-screen. Use the Jump to Page field at the top and bottom
of the screen, or use the Next Page and Last Page buttons to go to the next
page or the last page.
You can confuse the Next Page and Last Page buttons in a portlet with the
Next Page and Last Page buttons that correspond with pages in the team
space itself. When you use a portlet’s buttons, you change only what’s shown
in that portlet, not the rest of the team space’s portlets. For example, referring
to Figure 7-1, clicking the Next Page button in the Marketing Announcements
portlet doesn’t affect the Links portlet.
91
Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

Using the Show menu
Many, but not all, forms have tools for changing the amount of information
the form shows you. Using these particular features isn’t worth the trouble if
you’re using a view that only has a few entries, but they can be very useful if
the view has several entries.
Figure 7-3 shows the Team Tasks form, with a Show menu that helps you
determine who’s been slacking off. You can sort tasks in progress, overdue
tasks, completed tasks, and more.
Not every form allows you to change the data shown, and the exact behavior
of the Show menu is different from one form to the next. For example, the
Employee Directory form’s Show menu can display all of the employees, just
the people who work in Boston, or just Chicago, San Jose, or Staines, while
the Show menu on a Sign Up Sheet displays the names of those who have
said they’re not coming to your meeting.
Using filters
You can control what you see in a form’s view with filters. Filters reduce
what’s shown in a view, limiting information to just the items you want. Not
all forms have filters.
Use these steps to turn on filters and limit which items are displayed:
1. Choose Actions➪Show Filters.
A list of filters appears.
2. Double-click the document you want to see from the drop-down list at
the top of the appropriate column.
Figure 7-4 shows an example Description drop-down menu when you use fil-
ters with the Marketing Announcements portlet.
Figure 7-3:
Use the
Show menu
to view a
portion of
categorized
information.
92
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

When you’re finished using a filter, don’t forget to click the Actions button
and deselect the Hide Filters option so that you can view all the items again.
Searching a view
You can seek out specific items within a view using the built-in search capa-
bilities that come with IBM Workplace Services Express. The Search function
appears in most form portlets. Use these steps to search for information
within a view.
1. Choose Actions➪Show Search in the portlet.
The Search By menu offers a list of options.
2. Choose either All or the name of the field you want to search.
3. Enter the word or phrase you seek in the Search For field.
4. Click the Search button.
A list of results appears. (WSE lets you know if no items matched your

Reading items
You may want to view an item so that the item fills the entire portlet. When
you click the View button next to the item in which you’re interested, the
Summary view is replaced with a detailed view of the item.
As you can see in Figure 7-5, when you open an item, you can then use the
buttons at the top of the item to add a new item or (depending on your
access rights) edit or delete the item. You can also click the Return to Form
Documents button to return to the Summary view.

Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

Deleting items
In some situations you may want to delete an item — perhaps the item is some-
thing that you posted last year, and now it’s out of date. Or maybe the item was
posted by someone who is no longer on the team, and you want to remove it.
Your role in a team space determines which, if any, of the items you can
delete. If you’re not the team owner or one of its moderators (see Chapter 6),
you can only delete the items that you, yourself, posted in the first place. You
can always ask your team space’s owner for a promotion; or, failing that, to
raise your access level if you need to delete items from other people.
You can delete an item when you view it in Summary view, or when you have
the item open:
 To delete an item in Summary view: Click the check box next to the
item you want to remove, and then click the Delete button at the top of
the form, as shown in Figure 7-6.
 To delete an open item: Click the Delete button at the top of the form.
You can delete multiple items by clicking more than one check box
before you use the Delete button.

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

WSE doesn’t have an Undo button for deleting items from a portlet, so be
careful. When an item is gone, it’s really gone.
Entering information in a form
Most forms have a New button, which you use to add a new agenda item, URL
link, announcement, and so on. What exactly you see when you click that New
button depends very much on the form you’re using, of course. Sometimes
you see a one- or two-field affair — perhaps just the description of the new
task you’re adding and the name for the person to whom it’s being assigned.
In other cases, there’s a little more to it. Figure 7-7, for example, shows the
form used for entering a new Announcement. As you can see, this field offers
rich text formatting options that enable you to use bold and italicized text,
change fonts, and more.
Figure 7-6:
Deleting
an item.
95
Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

Don’t get alarmed if you don’t see buttons for creating new items or editing
existing items — many team spaces are designed so you can look but not
touch. And in most team spaces, you may have contributor access status,
which means you can only edit your own items, but not the items posted by
others. If you think you need a higher level of access, you can always ask one
of the team space’s moderators for a promotion.
The rich text editor in WSE works like other text-editing programs you’ve
used, so you should feel right at home when you’re using a form that lets you
format the text in one of its fields. For example, you can use your mouse to
select multiple words, you can use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste, and
so on. The buttons at the top of the editor help you control the way the text
you enter looks. Specifically, you can
 Undo: Nice to have this button, when you realize that you just made a
mistake.
 Redo: Nice to have this button when you realize that mistake you just
undid wasn’t a mistake after all.
 Text Color: Changes the text color.
 Background Color: Changes the background color.
Figure 7-7:

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

 Insert Table: Creates a table; you must choose the number of rows 
and columns.
 Insert Link: Adds a URL link that your team can click to open a 
Web page.
 Insert Horizontal Rule: Adds a horizontal line, which is useful for divvy-
ing your item up in to sections.
 Flip Whole Document Direction: Changes the text’s orientation.
 Text Direction Left to Right: Changes the text direction to the right.
 Text Direction Right to Left: Changes the text direction to the left.
 Font: Picks a typeface.
 Size: Picks the text size.
 Bold: Emphasizes text with boldface.
 Italics: Italicizes a word or phrase.
 Underline: Underlines text.
 Align Left: Aligns the paragraph flush left.
 Align Center: Aligns the paragraph in the middle.
 Align Right: Aligns the paragraph flush right.
Click OK at the bottom of the form when you are finished creating or editing
it, or click Cancel if you change your mind.
Resist the temptation to use too much formatting with the rich text editor!
Whatever you type is going to show in the form’s Summary view, so if you get
carried away, your entire team space’s home page could be affected — espe-
cially if several other forms and portlets have to get pushed out of the way to
make room for your flashy missive. If you refer to Figure 7-1, you can see that
the text in the item about Team Picnic Assignments is larger than the rest.
Imagine what would happen to the layout of the portlet (and the entire page)
if you made too much text too large.
97
Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

If you have a longer announcement with lots of text, or text that needs a ton
of fancy formatting, you should put that item in the document library instead.
See Chapter 10 for information on how to do exactly that.
Using Two Very Special Forms
Of all the forms you encounter in WSE, two are special enough, and different
enough, that they merit some special attention. The Team Task forms and
views are used to create and track activities that are related to your team or
project. What makes these forms stand out from all the rest is that they
enable you to assign tasks to a teammate, and then keep track of those tasks
and whether or not your teammate is completing the task on schedule and
keeping the project on schedule.
Slightly more complicated (and oh-so-much more special) is the Team
Calendar, which resides in many team spaces, and which represents all of the
meetings and events that are connected with the project or team.
Using the Team Task forms
Use the Team Task forms to assign and track work items relating to your pro-
ject or team. Just because you assign a task to a person doesn’t mean that he
or she will do it, or do it on time, but WSE does help you track what has been
assigned to whom, and what a task’s status is.
Each task has a status associated with it; it can be open, completed, or over-
due. Similarly, a task has a priority associated with it (priorities are ranked 1,
2, or 3). This tool is handy for determining how you handle tasks you’ve been
assigned — tackle those Priority 1 tasks before you start Priority 3 tasks.
Deciphering task status symbols
Tasks are usually listed by due date, with tasks that are due the soonest
listed first. As with any form, you can reorder the way the task items are
listed by clicking the column heading for the task. Figure 7-8 shows a sample
task list, sorted by status.
Some of the items in a task list may have an icon on the left side, such as the
exclamation point that Figure 7-8 shows next to the Finalize Keynote
Presentation item.
98
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Here’s the lowdown on each of the status options:
 The exclamation mark indicates that the task is overdue.
 The check mark means that the task has been completed.
 No icon at all means that the task is still open.
You can use the task list’s Show menu to display just the tasks that have been
assigned to you (including open, completed, and overdue tasks), all overdue
tasks assigned to anyone on the team, just the tasks that are completed by
the team, or all open tasks assigned to the team.
I show you how to make changes to a task in the following sections. Rest
assured that the person who created the task (if that’s not you) is notified by
e-mail whenever someone completes, annotates, edits, or deletes a task. If you
create a task for someone and you make a major change (it’s now due tomor-
row, not next week), you ought to drop the assigned task owner a quick note.
Creating a new task
Use these steps to create a new task:
1. In the Tasks portlet, click the New Task button.
2. Enter a short description of what needs to be done in the Task 
Name field.
This item is overdue.
Figure 7-8:
Viewing
your team
tasks.
99
Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

3. Enter the date by which the task needs to be complete in the Due 
Date field.
You can also use the Calendar picker to select the date.
4. Select the task’s priority level from the Priority drop-down list.
Choose 1 (High), 2 (Medium), or 3 (Low).
5. If the task is being assigned to a specific person on the team, click the
Find Person button to select the name of the task’s owner.
You don’t have to assign the task to anyone in particular.
6. If you want the person who is assigned the task to be able to delete it,
click the Allow Assignee to Delete Task check box.
7. If you want to allow the person to whom you assign the task to duck
the task altogether by making someone else do it, click the Allow
Assignee to Reassign Task check box.
8. Enter more detail about what needs to be done in the Task Description
field.
9. Click OK.
Figure 7-9 shows a sample task.

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Editing a task
Usually, you can only edit a task if you are the task’s owner, or the person to
whom it has been assigned. If you don’t see the Edit button associated with a
task, and you want to make changes to it, you need to contact a team moder-
ator to get permission to make changes. Assuming you have all the access
you need, follow these steps to edit a task:
1. Click the name of the task in the first column.
2. Click the Edit button.
3. Make the changes you need in the task’s fields.
4. Click OK.
The task is updated. From here on out everyone who sees it sees the
new version.
Making sure a task is listed as completed
If you’re the person to whom a task has been assigned, you have the power
to mark the task as completed. Use these steps to mark a task as complete:
1. Click the name of the task, in the first column.
2. Click the Complete button.
3. Click OK.
4. Go out and celebrate.
Commenting on a task
Sometimes you may have something to say about a task, even though you
aren’t its owner or aren’t the person to whom it was assigned. You can say
what you have to say by adding a comment to a task.
1. Click the name of the task in the first column.
2. Click the Add Comment button.
3. Enter your suggestions or comments in the Add Comment field.
4. Click the OK button.
Figure 7-10 shows how it looks when you add a comment to a task.
101
Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

Using the Team Calendar form
Most team spaces have a built-in team calendar that you can use to organize,
publicize, and track the meetings that are associated with the team or pro-
ject. Figure 7-11 shows a sample team calendar.
Remember that the items you post in a team calendar are for the entire team,
not just for you. If you have a dentist appointment next Tuesday, don’t post
that in the team calendar unless you want the whole team to know why
you’re not at work.
There are five kinds of entries you can include in a team calendar:
 Appointment: This is a meeting that you will be attending, and that you
want the whole team to know you’re attending.
 Meeting: Meetings usually involve the entire team, or at least many of the
team’s participants. Meetings are special because WSE automatically sends
an e-mail invitation to meeting invitees so that they can enter the impor-
tant details (date, time, location) into their personal calendars, as well.
Figure 7-10:

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

 Anniversary: Anniversaries are items that appear on the date you spec-
ify, used to remind the team that an event has been commemorated.
Anniversaries automatically repeat, usually for ten years (you can
change that).
 Reminder: Reminders are just like anniversaries, but they appear on the
calendar at a specific time.
 All Day Event: You can identify how large blocks of time are being spent
(at one of those boring, all-day type meetings). Use this item to make
sure someone’s assigned to bring the coffee.
Each type of calendar entry is distinguished on the calendar; all items show
up in different colors, and each type of entry has its own icon, too.
Changing the team calendar’s view
The Team Calendar portlet always shows the month being displayed at the
top (for example, in Figure 7-11, it’s October). You can use the buttons next to
the month to change what you see.
Only include details you want the whole team to see.
Figure 7-11:

103
Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

Click the Previous Month button to scroll into the past, and click the Month
Forward button to move into the future.
To jump to a specific date, click the triangle next to the name of the month
you’re viewing and pick the date you want from the Date Picker, as shown in
Figure 7-12.
You can always click the Today is link at the top to go back and view the cal-
endar entries for the current date.
Several buttons appear at the top of the form. You can use them to change
which days, weeks, or months are shown in the calendar. Use the team calen-
dar’s View menu to change the way the calendar is displayed — you can view
the calendar by an entire month at a time, or two weeks, or one week, or just
two days.

Entering an appointment in a team calendar
Use the following steps to add a new appointment to a team calendar.
1. Click the New Entry button.
2. Enter a brief description of the appointment in the Subject field.
What you enter in this field is displayed in the team calendar views, so
brevity is a good thing; use the Details field at the bottom of the form if
you have more on your mind.
3. Use the When and Where fields to enter the starting and ending dates
and times for the appointment, as well as its location.
An appointment’s location can be as far away as Boston or as local as
Conference Room B.
Use the Time and Date Pickers, if you prefer, to choose the times and
dates of the appointment instead of typing them.
4. Use the Repeating Entry fields if the appointment will occur more
than once.
5. Enter a more detailed description in the Details field if you desire.
6. Click Save.
Entering a meeting in a team calendar
Use the following steps to add a new meeting to a team calendar. Entering a
meeting is just like entering an appointment, except that you can invite other
people to join and attend your team meeting.
1. Click the New Entry button.
2. Select Meeting from the Entry Type drop-down list.
3. Enter a brief description of the meeting in the Subject field.
4. Use the When and Where fields to enter the starting and ending dates
and times for the meeting, as well as its location.
5. Use the Repeating Entry fields if the meeting will occur more 
than once.
6. Enter the names of the people who are invited to the meeting in the
Required, Optional, and FYI fields.
105
Chapter 7: Working Together with Pages and Forms

If you don’t want to type the names of the people who are invited, use
the Find Addresses button to search for and select names from the
directory. Because this option prevents typos, you may want to get into
the habit of always using the Find Addresses button. The only time you
can’t use this button is when the person you want to invite to the team is
not a member of the team.
7. Enter a more detailed description in the Details field if you desire.
8. Click Save.
Figure 7-13 shows a sample Meeting form.
Everyone you include in an invitation to a meeting receives an invitation to
the meeting via e-mail. From there, members can add the meeting to their cal-
endars. If you reschedule or cancel a team meeting, the new time, date, or
cancellation is automatically forwarded to your invitees.
Unlike some calendar and scheduling systems, the IBM Workplace Services
Express calendar can’t conduct free-time searches to see when the invitees
are available; also, WSE doesn’t accept RSVP responses from the invitees.

Editing a team calendar item
Any member of a team can edit an item on the team calendar by opening the
item and clicking the Edit button. Alternatively, you can select the item in the
calendar’s Summary view and click the Edit button.
If you edit a meeting by changing the time, date, or invitee list (or all three),
IBM Workplace Services Express sends the appropriate e-mail message to the
appropriate people to let them know about the change.
Cancelling a team calendar item
Deleting an item on a team calendar is just like deleting any other item on 
any other form; you open the item and click the Delete button. Alternatively,
you can select the item in the calendar’s Summary view and click the Delete
button.
If the item you delete is a team meeting, the meeting’s invitees receive an
automatically generated e-mail telling them that they don’t have to come to
the meeting anymore.

W
ithout discussions, IBM Workplace Services Express would just be a
dumping ground for documents. One of the activities that is important
to WSE, and that sets WSE apart from other kinds of software, is the ability to
hold discussions. A discussion area gives you and your team a venue for,
well, talking about things. Not every team space has a discussion area, of
course, but many do.
In fact, depending upon how your team or project is organized, you may have
more than one discussion area. For example, say you’re working on a massive
project with many subteams, each of which is assigned to work on very spe-
cific subprojects. Ultimately these subteams need to report to the larger
team. What better way to keep each other informed as they work toward
completing their piece of the project than to use discussions?
As you can see in this chapter, WSE has tools for making your discussions as
organized, or as disorganized, as you want to them to be. In this chapter, you
also discover how to create a discussion forum, how to manage discussion
forums and topics, and most important, how to chime in on the conversation
yourself.

Diving In to Discussions
Discussions give you and your team a fairly structured place to talk about any
topic related to your team or project. Discussions can be rigid affairs, with
specific areas dedicated to the discussion of very specific topics, or they can
be more freewheeling and loosey-goosey, where your team is just turned
loose to discuss whatever issue they want — and however they want.
Discussions are, by their very nature, supposed to be highly interactive, with
lots of people contributing ideas, posting topics, adding replies, and so on.
You set up a new discussion because you anticipate that the members of a
team need a special venue for collectively arriving at a decision or making a
collaborative recommendation.
If, on the other hand, you just need a place for your team to post and be able
to find things, discussions aren’t necessarily the right answer — that sounds
a lot more like a time to use a document library, perhaps, or the
Announcements form.
Figure 8-1 shows a sample discussion, where a team is having a go-around
about a new product name.

110
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Understanding how discussions 
are organized
Because a team may have any number of topics to discuss, WSE provides a
few different ways of organizing them, so that team members can easily find
the topic or discussion that they need to read up on or contribute to.
Discussions are organized hierarchically. Here’s how the hierarchy breaks
down, from the top to the bottom:
 Forum: At the top of the hierarchy are forums (or is it fora, or maybe
fori?). A team space can have any number of these forums.
 Threads: Forums in turn contain threads. A thread is a collection of
posts related to a particular idea or item that the team needs to discuss.
 Topics: Threads are made up of a series of topics. A topic is just a page
that some member of the team posts to get the conversational ball
rolling.
 Posts: People who are participating in a discussion can either post
replies of their own, or submit their own topics. Any contribution at 
this level is officially called a post.
A team space can have a discussion area. That discussion area can have 
any number of discussion forums, and each forum can have any number 
of threads. Each thread consists of one post, which is called a topic, and 
a series of related posts from other people, which are called replies.
Using and Managing Discussions
Discussions are actually quite easy to set up, use, and manage. Remember
that not all team spaces have discussions, and the ones that you do encounter
may very well only have one big forum with a lot of posts in it. As a great man
once said “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should,” and that sage
advice definitely applies to how much time you can/should spend worrying
about how to organize WSE discussions. Having six large forums and an infi-
nite number of threads is simply overkill for a team made up of ten people.
Working with forums
Figure 8-2 shows a team space discussion area, which includes two sample
discussion forums: Planning for 2006 events and RFP responses. As you can
111
Chapter 8: Holding and Managing Discussions

see in the figure, this list of forums works much the same way as other 
WSE tools (like the Team Spaces Catalog, for example, which I describe in
Chapter 6). It is made up of columns of information about the discussion
forums, including the forum’s title, the number of topics and posts the forum
contains, and the date of the most recent post in the forum.
You can sort the list of forums by clicking the Forum link at the top of the
first column in the list of forums. The little arrow next to the word Forum
indicates whether the list is being presented to you in ascending or descend-
ing order.
At the top of the list of forums are five buttons that are used to interact with
the forums. They are, from left to right:
 New Forum: Adds a new forum to the discussion area in the team space.
 Lock Forum: Prevents the team from adding any new posts to a forum.
This is a useful tool when the team has been given a deadline to submit
posts for a topic that is time sensitive. The Lock Forum button makes
very clear to team members that they’ve missed the boat for expressing
dissatisfaction with the new controversial policy you’ve enacted, and
that they must now commence calling you the Venerable, Honorable Mr.
(or Ms.) Cool when they bow to kiss your ring.

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

 Unlock Forum: Switches a forum that you have previously locked, so
that it is open for business again, and so that your team can add new
topics and posts to it.
 Delete Forum: Removes a forum, along with all accompanying threads
and posts, forever and ever. When you delete a forum, it’s gone for 
good — you and your team can’t ever see its contents again.
 Hide Descriptions: Hides the description line that appears under the
name of each discussion forum. This button is useful if you have a par-
ticularly long list of forums.
Creating a new forum
Use these simple steps to create a new discussion forum:
1. Click the New Forum button.
The New Forum form appears.
2. Enter the name (required) and description (optional) for the new
forum.
3. Click OK.
When you click the OK button, the new forum is created and opened for you
automatically. Not surprisingly, the new forum is empty, so the first thing
you’ll probably want to do is add a new topic.
Editing a discussion forum
Use the following steps if you want to rename a forum or change its 
description:
1. Click the name of the forum you want to edit.
The forum’s topics are displayed.
2. Click the Edit Forum button.
The forum’s properties form is displayed.
3. Enter the new name and/or description for the forum.
4. Click OK.
You can also use the Properties form to lock the forum, or unlock it, as 
appropriate.

Chapter 8: Holding and Managing Discussions

Entering a discussion forum
You can easily enter a forum — this is what you do when you want to dig a
little deeper and actually read the posts in a particular forum. Assuming you
have the right level of access and the forum isn’t locked, you can post your
own topics and replies, too.
Just click the name of the forum in the list of forums. The forum list goes away
and is replaced by the list of topics and posts in the forum you selected.
Check out the following section, “Working with topics and threads,” to find
out how to navigate the posts.
Working with topics and threads
Figure 8-3 shows the topics in the first of our sample forums. As you can see
in the figure, this forum’s title is New Offerings; note that the list of topics
also tells you who posted the topic in the first place, how many replies are in
the given topic or thread, and when the last post was made.
As the figure also shows, this particular forum contains three topics, which
have already been posted by members of the team.
Much like the list of forums we saw in the previous section, you can use the
six buttons at the top of the screen to work with the topics in the forum:
 New Topic: Adds a new topic to the forum, which your teammates can
read and to which your teammates can post replies.
 Lock Thread: Shuts a thread down, so that your team can’t add any new
topics or replies. You and the team can still read the posts and replies in
a locked thread, you just can’t add any news ones.
 Unlock Thread: Unlocks a thread that you have previously locked, so
that your team can start adding new posts and replies to it again.
 Delete Thread: Removes the thread, and all of the posts in the thread.
After you delete a thread and its posts, it can’t be recovered or
retrieved.
 Lock Forum: Prevents the team from adding any new posts to the entire
forum.
 Edit Forum: Enables you to change a forum’s title or description.
Notice the Forums link at the top of Figure 8-3. You use this link to exit the
forum you’re in and return to the list of all the forums in the team space’s 
discussion area.

Posting a new topic in a thread
Use these three simple steps to add a new topic to a discussion forum:
1. Click the New Topic button.
The New Topic form appears.
2. Enter the topic’s description and body in the New Topic form.
3. Click OK.
When you click the OK button, the new topic is added to the forum and is
opened for you automatically, as you can see in Figure 8-4.
Click the appropriate buttons for your new topic. Although you could use the
Reply button to reply to the topic you just created, that would be a little like
talking to yourself. In most cases, you’ll want to instead click the link at the
top of the screen to return to the list of topics. Likewise, you probably don’t
want to start out by locking a topic that you’ve just created.

See Figure 8-5.
Figure 8-5 shows a sample discussion thread, one that has two posts from dif-
ferent members of the team. If others on the team reply to these posts, their
replies are automatically indented, to help you make sense of who is replying
to what.
Use the following steps to dig down and see all of the posts in a given
topic/thread:
1. Click the name of the thread you want to read.
The forum’s topics are displayed.
2. Click the Edit Forum button.
The forum’s properties form is displayed.
3. Enter the new name for the forum.
You can also add a description.
4. Click OK.

Chapter 8: Holding and Managing Discussions
Making sense of the madness: Expanding 
and collapsing threads
Because discussion threads can grow to be
long and unruly, WSE has a way to help you find
your way through them. When you have multi-
ple posts in a thread, you see either a + (plus
sign) or a – (minus) sign next to the thread; click
the + or – sign, to expand the post to show all of
its contents or minimize it to show just its
description. Clicking these symbols shows or
hides a post’s body.
You can also use the Show All and Hide All but-
tons to expand and collapse the entire thread. 
Expanding and collapsing threads can be
handy, especially if you’re working with a par-
ticularly long thread with multiple posts, and you
need to hide some of the detail in order to make
sense of the whole mess.

Editing a topic or post
In most cases, you can only edit the topics and posts that you yourself
posted. Assuming you have the access rights, you can use the following steps
to edit a topic or post:
1. Click the Edit button for the post you want to change.
The discussion forum is displayed.
2. Make your change to the topic or post’s subject and/or body.
3. Click OK.
Replying to a post
Replying to a post is a lot like adding a new topic, except that your reply is
automatically displayed in the thread, indented underneath the post to which
you replied.
Be sure you click the correct Reply button, especially in a long and compli-
cated thread that has a lot of posts. Did you ever hear that joke about the
three most important things in real estate? (Location, location, location.) The
same rule applies to clicking the Reply button in a WSE discussion thread —
you can easily reply to the wrong post.
Use the following steps to post your own reply:
1. Click the Reply button on the post you’re replying to.
The Reply form is displayed.
2. Enter your comments in the Body field.
3. Click OK.
When you read a thread, WSE always tells you whether the authors of individ-
ual posts are online and available for a chat (as I discuss in Chapter 5). If you
have a quick question for the author of a post, and it’s not necessarily some-
thing the whole team needs to read, click the person’s name to start a chat
session. If you have a question or need clarification, sending an IM is always
the fastest way to get your answer.
Searching through Discussion Threads
You can search a discussion thread for a particular word or phrase. This is
particularly useful if your team has several discussions in operation, or when
you have long discussions with tons of posts and replies.
118
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Or say you haven’t been keeping up with a particular forum or thread, but
you need to get up to speed in time for your meeting in 15 minutes; searching
is a great way to see what your team has had to say on a particular word,
phrase, or topic.
As you can see in Figures 8-2 and 8-3, both the forum list and the topic list
pages have a search field in the upper-right corner. When you want to find a
particular word or phrase, enter it in the Search For field, and click the
Search button.
As you can see in Figure 8-6, WSE shows you all of the posts that match your
search terms — assuming there are any.
119
Chapter 8: Holding and Managing Discussions
Keeping discussions in perspective
Discussions are certainly important, and one of
the most interesting methods that WSE utilizes
technology to help keep teams collaborating.
That said, you may not use the discussions
described in this chapter as much as you think.
(I know what you’re thinking: Now he tells me?!)
Although knowing about discussion forums 
is important, and although (in the interests of 
full disclosure) including information about 
discussions in this book is important, chat
rooms are often a better way to keep in touch
and make group decisions for a couple of 
reasons:
 Chat rooms are a lot like discussion forums,
in that they offer the team a place to go and
have a free-for-all discussion about just
about any topic. And they’re also like dis-
cussions because the comments and mes-
sages from the team are automatically
stored in the chat room transcript’s archive.
The chat goes on and on; any member can
come along and read or contribute to the
chat at any time. (All of this chat room busi-
ness is covered, ad nauseum, in Chapter 9.)
 Chat rooms offer a level of immediacy that
discussions do not. As Chapter 9 shows, if
two, three, or four people are working
together in a chat room, they are collabo-
rating in real time.
One down side to chat rooms is that they don’t
offer the level of organization that discussion
areas do; for example, you can’t organize a chat
room discussion into topics and forums the 
way you can with discussion forums. In my
humble opinion, however, the immediacy of a
chat room discussion trumps the organization
offered by a discussion forum. I guess which of
these conversation methods you find most
effective depends on the team’s purpose, as
well as the kind of discussions the team needs
to have.

C
hat rooms are a special combination of instant messaging and discus-
sion forums. They give team members a way to work together, in real
time; whoever is with you in a chat room sees what you type, as soon as you
type it. Given this immediacy, chat rooms are the best way to work when sev-
eral people need to come together to talk about a particular topic or idea,
reach a decision, or get some questions answered — fast.
In this chapter, I show you where to find chat rooms, how you participate in
the chats, how to find out what the team was up to when you weren’t around,
and how you can use and manage chat archives.
Getting Chat Room Basics
Chat room features are among the most interesting and distinctive facets 
of IBM Workplace Services Express; they embody the difference between
dynamic team collaboration and ho-hum, relatively static document 
libraries and discussion databases.
The basic idea behind chat rooms is that you and any number of your team-
mates can come together to collaborate in real time. In this regard, using a
chat room is similar to instant messaging, because the chat room conversa-
tions you have with your teammates happen instantly. Just like an IM chat,

when you type a message in a chat room, all of the participants in the chat
room can see it and can respond.
What makes chat rooms particularly interesting and useful is that the conver-
sation that you have is archived. A member of the team who wasn’t part of
the chat can still come to the chat room after the fact, and see what was
being talked about.
And, in most cases, the straggler can continue the conversation, because you
can post a message to a chat room even if no one else is around, sort of like
leaving a note or a question for the next person or group of people who visit
the chat room. Because every message posted to a chat room is automati-
cally time stamped and every participant is identified by name, you can
always tell who said what — and when.
Because WSE chat transcripts are automatically saved, they live on in the
team space long after the chat is over. For example, if one of your teammates
performs a search for RFPs, say three weeks after you had a chat about RFPs,
the teammate gets a hit that leads to your chat archive (assuming that the
term RFP occurred in your chat, of course, and assuming that the teammate
has access rights to see your chat). Figure 9-1 shows a sample chat room.

122
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Chat rooms are usually open for business, ’round the clock. Thinking
metaphorically, using a chat room is a lot like having focused conversations
around the water cooler; sometimes you’ll find a lot of people there, and
sometimes you won’t, but whenever people are around, they’ll be talking
about whatever theme the chat room was set up to address.
To extend the water cooler metaphor just a bit, imagine a big, magic bulletin
board on the wall behind the water cooler, which auto-magically records all
of the conversations that transpire there. That way, someone who visits at,
say, 11:00 a.m., can see what the rest of the people were talking about at 10:00
a.m. This magic bulletin board is also the way you leave a comment or ques-
tion, in case there’s no one else there when you arrive.
Understanding the important differences
between chats and IM
What transpires in a chat room is a lot like instant messaging — it’s certainly
instant, for example. However, a few key differences between instant messag-
ing and chat rooms are worth considering:
 Chat rooms become part of your team’s history: Unlike instant message
chats, chat rooms automatically preserve and display previous conver-
sations. If you have an IM chat with someone, the record of the conver-
sation disappears when you close the chat window. There’s no way to
archive it.
 Chat rooms are searchable: You can search contents of chats, both in
the chat room itself, and when you search in an entire team space or all
of WSE. You can quickly find a conversation about a particular topic,
after the fact, as long as the conversation happened in a chat room and
you know which terms to look for. Instant messaging conversations, on
the other hand, aren’t recorded, and so you can’t search them after the
conversation has concluded.
 Chat rooms have a wider audience: The conversations that you have
via IM are, by their nature, fairly private affairs, because the contents are
only visible to the two or three people participating in the IM session,
and because the remarks they make there are only visible to the person
for as long as the participants have their chat windows open. Chats are
viewable by the entire team.
If you’ve got something bad to say about your boss (or anyone on the team
or at your company), you’re better off saying nothing (or at the very least
making your comments in an instant message); avoid the permanence of the
a chat room.
123
Chapter 9: Chat Rooms and Why They’re Handy

Understanding the important differences
between chats and discussion forums
What transpires in a chat room is also a lot like a discussion area, because
the chat room is a place for people to come together, collaborate, and inter-
act with each other. But there’s one key difference between discussion areas
and chat rooms that is worth getting down in black and white.
The conversations in a chat room occur mostly in real time; whatever you
type is seen by others in the chat room as soon as you type it. In discussion
forums, the expectation is that posts don’t need to be read immediately.
Some ideas for how to use a chat room
Chat rooms give you a whole new way to work with your team. Here are 
some ideas about how you might use a chat room to foster your team’s 
collaboration:
 Hold a team meeting: Set up a regularly scheduled (weekly, perhaps)
online meeting for members of the team where they can quickly come
together to check in and provide status updates. Chat rooms shouldn’t
replace conference calls and face-to-face meetings, but sometimes a
quick chat session with five or ten members of your team is just the
ticket. Don’t diss this idea until you’ve tried it. It’s got one perk that no
face-to-face conversation can manage — an instant transcript of what
everyone had to say.
 Have a caucus: Maybe a subteam or subcommittee needs to get a deci-
sion made? A chat room is a great place for a smaller bunch of your
teammates to come together and have a discussion or make a decision.
 Hold online office hours: If you’re a team leader or project manager,
how cool would it be if your team knew that you will always be online
and ready to chat in a chat room at a preset time (say, every Tuesday 
at 10:00 a.m.)? Because chat room conversations are automatically
recorded and archived for your team, and assuming the conversations
you have with your minions are for the greater good of the entire team,
chat rooms are a good way to get the word out.
 Have an ask-the-expert session: If you (or a member of the team) have
expertise in a particular area or on a particular part of the project, 
help out your team by availing yourself to their questions at set times.
Because the chat room archives the discussion, members of the team
can review or search the conversation to get quick answers. If you’re 
the expert, using a chat room in this manner may even mean that people
bug you less often (but don’t hold your breath on that one).
124
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Using Chat Rooms
Using a chat room is as painless an experience as you’ll have in WSE. The fol-
lowing sections give you everything you need to know, from entering into a
chat to searching chat archives and managing chat room members.
Finding and entering a chat room
Some chat rooms are part of a team space, and other chat rooms are listed in
the Team Spaces Catalog. If the chat room is part of a team space, you access
the chat room by clicking its name in the team space menu. If, on the other
hand, the team space is more of a stand-alone space, you access it by clicking
the name of the chat room in the Team Spaces Catalog.
Regardless of the chat room’s name, you can tell which of the items in the
Team Spaces Catalog are chat rooms by looking in the Template column of
the Team Spaces Catalog.
Figure 9-2 shows a sample Team Spaces Catalog, and as you can see, the
SalesJam entry uses the Chat Room template.
125
Chapter 9: Chat Rooms and Why They’re Handy
One man’s opinion: Is a conversation best held 
in a chat room, discussion area, or IM?
I’m a big fan of chat rooms, and that’s the first
place I look when I need to discuss something
with the members of my teams. I like the fact
that chat rooms enable us to work together in
real time, and preserve the conversation for
people who can’t be there live. Because of the
highly interactive and versatile nature of a chat
room conversation, things just get done faster
and questions get answered more quickly.
IM is a close second, and I guarantee that if you
don’t already use IM for work purposes it will
become one of your frequently used WSE tools,
too. The biggest benefit of IM versus chats is
the privacy that IM affords; your IM exchanges
are just between you and the person(s) with
whom you’re conversing. When what you need
to talk about is for a smaller and more limited
audience, IM is the answer.
Discussion forums are, in my experience, any-
way, of limited value. Although sometimes dis-
cussion forums work well for a project (say you
need a place to post discussion items and ques-
tions so that people can read and respond at
their leisure), I think discussion forums are too
passive and too slow paced. You and your team-
mates have to remember to go to the thread to
see whether anything new has been added to
the conversation, and you have to wait for
replies.

A chat room is made up of several parts, including the chat transcript, the
Type Your Message Here field, and the Current Participants and Past
Contributors lists.
The chat transcript shows you all of the messages that are part of the discus-
sion; you can use the scroll bars as appropriate to see what the team’s been
talking about. Don’t forget that a chat room is open for business 24/7, so what
you see in the chat transcript could be from earlier today or even last week.
Fortunately, WSE puts a time stamp on each entry so that you know the
timing of chat entries. Figure 9-3 shows a chat room in action.
The Current Participants list alphabetically lists which of  your teammates is
currently participating in the chat session.
If a member has posted in the past, he or she is only noted as a current par-
ticipant if he or she is in the chat room at the moment. Likewise, everyone
who is in the chat room is listed as a participant, even those participants
who are lurking (reading along but offering no comments of their own). In the
Current Participants list, you may also notice a little hand icon next to the
name of the people as they are typing messages.
A sure sign that this is a chat room.

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Sometimes, when lots of people are in a chat room, the conversation flows
very quickly. Other times, when fewer people are present, the conversation
lags. If you visit a chat room looking for someone to answer a question for
you, and there’s no one there but you, don’t feel lonely, and don’t despair;
you should still type your question. The next person to visit the chat room
will respond.
Typing a message
Typing a message in a chat room is easy; to type a message and post it to a
chat room, you follow these steps:
1. Type what you want to say in the Type Your Message Here field.
No one can see what you type until you click the Send Message button
or press the Enter key on your keyboard, so you can correct mistakes, 
or change your wording.
2. Click the Send Message button or press Enter.
As soon as you click the Send Message button, what you type is dis-
played in the chat transcript; anyone with access to the chat room 
can see what you typed.

Chapter 9: Chat Rooms and Why They’re Handy

Just as in an IM exchange, if you type a Web page address (like www.dummies.
com) in a chat room, your teammates can automatically click it to visit that
Web page.
Use a chat archive to keep things fresh
When you archive old chats, you keep things fresh (archiving clears the Chat
Transcript window) and provide a way to make what’s transpired in a chat
room searchable. If you want to archive chat room contents regularly (say
once a week), you can set up automated archives (see “Scheduling archives,”
later in this chapter). Saved archives are saved as part of the chat room on
the WSE server.
You can also use the Archive Now button to archive the contents of a chat
session.
When you click the Archive Now button, you see the Archive Now form, as
shown in Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4:
Archive a
chat room

up and store
its contents.
128
Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Follow these simple steps to archive a chat:
1. Click the Archive the Current Transcript Now check box.
I discuss scheduled archives later in this chapter.
2. Enter the name for the chat transcript in the Archive Name field.
Adding a name is optional, but it can come in handy, especially if the
chat room has a lot of traffic. Your transcript name could be by date,
such as chat archives, December 10 through 17, or by topic, such as
Discussion about using the new phone system.
3. Enter a description about the content of the transcript you’re archiv-
ing in the Description field.
Adding a description is optional.
4. Click OK.
When you archive a chat, two things happen:
 The entire contents of the chat transcript are removed.
 Those same contents are saved in a chat archive document, for your
(and your team’s) later viewing and searching pleasure.
As far as space is concerned, you could run WSE forever and ever without
archiving a single chat session and probably be okay; however, catastrophic
system crashes happen all the time for no good reason, so archiving chat
transcripts on a semi-regular basis is a good idea. Even if you don’t need the
contents of a chat transcript saved, archiving is still a good idea because you
can clear the Chat Transcript window and let a new conversation start from
scratch.
Scheduling archives
Setting up a scheduled archive is a good way to keep your chat room lean
and mean without having to remember to manually click the Archive Now
button (as I describe in the previous section). If you have a chat room that
sees a lot of visitors and conversations, having the room’s contents automati-
cally archived is doubly important.
Figure 9-5 shows the Scheduling Archives form that appears when you click
the Schedule Archives button.
129
Chapter 9: Chat Rooms and Why They’re Handy

Follow these easy steps using the Scheduling Archives form to schedule auto-
matic, regular archives:
1. Click the Automatically Archive Older Messages in the Chat
Transcript check box.
2. Use the Archive Messages Older Than list to determine how much of
the chat transcript you want removed from the Chat Transcript
window each time the archive is run.
For example, you can set the archive to save messages that are older
than a week; all the messages that were typed within a week remain in
the Chat Transcript window, dropping into the archive day by day.
3. Use the Perform This Archive list to determine how often, and at what
time, the automatic archive will perform its magic.
Your choices include weekly, every two weeks, monthly, and daily.
4. Click OK.
Figure 9-5:

Part III: Getting Involved with Team Spaces 

Using and searching a chat archive
Everyone who has access to the chat room can use the archives to view pre-
vious conversations. Click the Archives tab at the top of the chat room to
open a list of archives.
Figure 9-6 shows a chat archive list; each archive name is a link (such as Chat
Transcript March 23) that you can click to view its contents.
If you have the correct level of access, you can click the trash can icon next
to a chat archive to delete it. But be careful, because when you delete a chat
archive, it’s gone forever.
You can also use the Search Chat Archives For field to search for and display
only the archives that match the term you’re interested in. The search facility
in a chat room is not the only way to locate a particular chat discussion; as I
show you in Chapter 16, the wider-scope searches that the main WSE search
facility performs also search chat archives.
Figure 9-6:

131
Chapter 9: Chat Rooms and Why They’re Handy

Managing members
If your chat room is part of a team space, the people who can participate in
chats and read and search chat archives are all the members of the team
space.
If, on the other hand, your chat room is a stand-alone application, use the
Members button on the left side of the screen to manage precisely who can
come to your little chat party.
Managing the member list for a chat room is exactly the same as managing
the member list for a team space. You have to have the right access role.

In this part . . .
W
SE users come from all over the world, and the
teams and projects that WSE is used for are as
varied as the contestants on American Idol.
But one thing that all teams seem to have is common is
the number of documents, and content in general, they
produce. Some teams turn out Microsoft Word documents
by the truck load! Whether you use Microsoft Office or not,
it’s a pretty safe bet that you, your team, and the projects
you work on will need places to store and produce them.
So, then, we have Part IV, which is focused on exactly that:
how you use WSE to store, organize, produce, and collabo-
rate on content — like documents, spreadsheets, presen-
tations, and just about anything else you can think of.

Introducing Document Libraries

 Using the Document Libraries Catalog
 Creating and managing documents
 Creating a new document library and adding members
T
ake a look at your desk right now. Is it strewn with papers? Yeah, that’s
what I thought. Document management (sometimes referred to as content
management) is one of the things almost all people (and certainly all teams)
have to deal with; thus, document management is built in to IBM Workplace
Services Express.
No matter where documents come from, or what software was used to create
them, the WSE document libraries help extend your software investments
and intellectual capital. Whether you just need a place to put documents so
your team has access to them, or you intend to use WSE in a more collabora-
tive way so that people can work together to produce new documents, WSE
has great document management features that are ready, willing, and able to
do what you need them to do.
In this chapter, I introduce document management, discuss some of the ways
document libraries can streamline your content management, and get you
started with a new WSE document library.
Introducing Document Management
Document management has an entire arm of the software industry devoted to
it; software vendors (including IBM) sell very large, complex, and expensive
document management systems that can be used to run an entire enterprise.
The aspirations of WSE document management are more humble; the docu-
ment management facilities WSE offers are, as you’d probably guess, focused
on the needs of teams and projects (as opposed to an entire conglomerate).

In general, companies and organizations use document management in two
scenarios: content publishing, in which the document management system is
used as a library or reference system of sorts, and content production, in
which the system facilitates the creation of new content, files, and docu-
ments. WSE uses a little of both.
Using document management for reference
Many companies and organizations can benefit from online content libraries,
which may contain policies and procedures, user manuals, design specifica-
tions, presentations, templates, auditing tools, and more. These are fairly
common uses for a document management system, and tasks to which WSE
is particularly well suited.
Keeping such materials in an online document library in WSE has many bene-
fits, including
 Consistency: Because all the important information is maintained in the
same place, document libraries are great for keeping everyone on the
same page (pardon the pun). Anyone who needs to get information from
the horse’s mouth, so to speak, knows that the official, approved policy
guide, manual, or what have you is available in the document library. No
more will you hear anyone say, “Gee, I didn’t know that!”
 Reference: Most companies and organizations have policies and proce-
dures that every employee is supposed to know; some companies even
certify that employees have reviewed these policies. From a team per-
spective, there may be situations where the design specification, rules of
engagement, or even just simple, informal instructions on how to use
the fax machine are stored in a WSE document library, for all to see.
 Best practices: A common use for document libraries is to store guide-
lines and instructions on how to perform a job. Imagine you’re a new
consultant, just hired at one of the Big Five accounting companies —
wouldn’t a document library full of best practices, as well as a formal 
job description, make your transition to that new job easier?
 Reduced, more efficient storage: Twenty years ago, a stroll through
most businesses revealed entire bookshelves filled with three-ring
binders, which were stuffed to the gills with policies and procedures,
manuals, and the like. The advent of the digital age has gotten much of
that material and content online, and saved a lot of shelf space and trees
in the process. However, too many organizations still rely on e-mail to
distribute such electronic materials; having such content posted instead
in a central, server-based location is wiser, and leads to leaner and more
manageable inboxes. And document libraries save your company tons of
disk space, too.
136
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

 Compliance: Compliance has become a big, big deal in some industries,
especially since the willy-nilly days before the high tech bubble burst. If
your company is subject to government audits, regulation, and oversight
(such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States), putting your 
corporate information in a document library where all your team has
access can ease your compliance efforts. Even if you don’t fall under
such oversight at your own company, this kind of regulation is becoming
prevalent enough that a company with which you do business may
require it of you.
 Enablement: A very common use for online libraries is to enable
employees to be more self reliant. Often these days, employees are
asked to multitask and manage themselves. In their multiple roles, they
can’t do their jobs well if they’re not provided access to the right tools.
Say you have a sales team that’s in the business of writing proposals.
Putting a boilerplate template for a sales proposal in a document library
enables your sales team to do its job independently instead of either
coming to you for the updated template or having to reinvent the wheel
every time they’re trying to close a new deal.
Figure 10-1 shows such a document library that acts as a reference library
that contains a bunch of documents concerning accounting best practices.

137
Chapter 10: Introducing Document Libraries

Using document management 
for content creation
A common use, and one where WSE really shines for document management,
is related to the creation of new documents and files (as opposed to just
warehousing, as described in the previous section, “Using document manage-
ment for reference”). In this case, document libraries aren’t used solely as
part of a reference system, but are also the collaborative foundation of the
way content is produced, edited, and perhaps eventually disseminated out-
side the organization.
Imagine, for example, a product marketing team that is working together to
design a marketing campaign for a new product, and which, for the sake of
the argument, is producing a press release about why your company’s new
thingamajig is the best ever. A few people may be involved in turning out that
release: Two or three might write the documents; then their manager needs
to sign off on it; after that, the Public Relations department has to chime in;
and eventually a lawyer needs to make sure that the press release is all ship-
shape, legally speaking.
WSE document libraries have built-in collaborative tools to aid such a team
as they work together to create and produce the press release, or any other
kind of document. Features such as integrated instant messaging, document
locking, and workflow can streamline and speed up the way a team works
together. And imagine, for the sake of argument, that the lawyer in this little
story is not an employee of the company at all, but a hired gun. The lawyer
can still participate as a member of the team, because he or she can access
the WSE document library.
Here are some ideas about how you can use collaborative document manage-
ment in your organization:
 Product Design: The design process for new products is a highly collab-
orative affair, unless you’re self employed and work all by yourself, down
in your cellar. Document management can help your team design the
new widget.
 Responding to an RFP: A request for proposal is the lingua franca for
many large companies when they’re soliciting bids. An extended sales
team can benefit from working together in a WSE document library to
create and manage the company’s collective response to such a request.
 Customer Service: Rather than just throwing documents over the wall
to a customer, why not invite the customer to participate in the produc-
tion process for that document? Collaborating with customers leads to
tighter relationships and better customer service.

Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

 Process Definition: Similar to product design, teams that work together
to produce a process (maybe to define a new human resources policy,
for example) get that done more quickly and efficiently when they use
WSE document libraries to churn out their stuff.
Figure 10-2 shows a collaborative document library in which a team is work-
ing to produce a new set of RFPs.
You can use WSE-based document management in so many ways, so this list
is just a smattering of the most common ways WSE gets used to streamline
the collaborative content creation process.
In general, any time people need to work together to create something —
whether that something is a new policy for travel expenses or the design of a
new jet airplane — they’ll probably be working with content, and that means
WSE document libraries can help.

Chapter 10: Introducing Document Libraries

Integrating Microsoft Office
The documents, content, and files that you share in WSE document libraries
can come from just about anywhere. Often, much of the content you want to
share already exists before you start out with WSE. Not surprisingly, then,
there’s an easy way to import documents, en masse, into a WSE document
library. Of course, WSE also has built-in methods to create content.
Pound for pound, more content comes from Microsoft Office than any other
software program, so WSE has a special relationship with Microsoft Office.
For example, WSE supports round-trip editing with Microsoft Office, which
means that in the WSE interface, you can click the New Document button and
be magically transported to Microsoft Office. Write your document or create
your spreadsheet just as you’ve done a million times before. When you save
the Office file, WSE takes over and automatically uploads it to the WSE docu-
ment library. This seamless integration between Microsoft Office and IBM
Workplace Services Express means that every document instantly enters the
collaborative process; your boss can sign off on it immediately, your team
can comment on it before the big meeting, and so on.
Or not. If you don’t use Microsoft Office, WSE can still help. In fact, some-
times WSE is just the alternative for people who do not use Office (such 
as Linux users), or for people who use other programs (such as Adobe
Photoshop or a different word processor) in addition to Office. The bottom
line is that document libraries are built to work with whatever kind of 
document or content you have.
Getting Started with Document
Management in WSE
Amazingly enough, all the WSE document management features discussed in
Chapters 10, 11, and 12 are managed by a single portlet, called the Document
Manager. The Document Manager organizes the document libraries you come
across.
As a result of the massiveness of the WSE document management machine,
predicting exactly how you’ll first encounter the document libraries isn’t as
easy as it seems; the document libraries can even be added as a feature of
any team space.
Usually, however, document libraries are not created as free-standing affairs,
separate and distinct from any single team space. In most cases, you access
WSE document libraries by clicking the Team Spaces button, and then click-
ing the Documents button. Doing so shows the Document Libraries Catalog,
shown in Figure 10-3.
140
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

The Document Libraries Catalog is the list of libraries you have access to and
can use. Much like the Team Spaces Catalog (see Chapter 6), the Document
Libraries Catalog has built-in tools to help organize the list. You don’t see any
document libraries in this list for teams of which you’re not a member.
The list of document libraries in the catalog has six columns:
 Name: The library’s name is listed in this column as a clickable link.
Click it to access a list of all the documents contained in a library.
To open a particular document library, click the library’s name in the first
column. Click the individual folders and files in the library to access them.
 Favorite: This column indicates whether you’ve selected the library as
one of your own personal favorites.
 Template: This column tells you that it is, in fact, a document library.
 Owner: Check this column to see the name of the person who created
the document library.
 Last Update: This column tells you the last time a document was cre-
ated, edited, or deleted.
 Delete: Clicking the button in this column permanently deletes the docu-
ment library. Only a document library’s moderator or owner can delete a
document library. Proceed with caution.
Figure 10-3:

141
Chapter 10: Introducing Document Libraries

Click the column heading for the Name column or the Last Update column to
sort the list of libraries by that column.
Searching for a document library
If you know a library’s name but you can’t find it by searching through the
entire list of document libraries in the catalog, you can enter the first few let-
ters of the name in the Find Libraries field and click the Search button. The
Find Libraries field is at the top of the catalog (refer to Figure 10-3).
The Find Libraries field doesn’t enable you to conduct a bonafide search. You
really need to know the exact name of the document library (or at least the
first word in the library’s name) to see the results you want. After you enter
the first portion of the document library’s name and click the Search button,
the list of document libraries in the catalog shortens to show just the ones
that start with the same letters. Figure 10-4 shows the results of a search for
policies.
Use the Clear Results button if you want to reset the list of team spaces and
see all the libraries in the catalog.
Figure 10-4:
Use the Find
Libraries
field to find

142
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

You can also sort the list of libraries with the Show drop-down list. Click the
drop-down list to select
 All Libraries: Shows all the libraries to which you have access.
 My Libraries: Shows libraries for which you’re a moderator or owner.
 Public Libraries: Shows libraries that are open to everyone.
 Favorite Libraries: Shows the libraries that you’ve designated as
favorites. See “Using and setting favorites” for more information.
Using and setting favorites
If you find that there are certain document libraries that you use more 
often than others, tell WSE about it by clicking the selection box next to the
library’s name and clicking the Add to Favorites button. The libraries you
select as favorites are always displayed with a check mark in the Favorite
column, as you can see in Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5:
Identify your
favorite
libraries to

143
Chapter 10: Introducing Document Libraries

Now you can use the Show menu to display only these favorites.
If you have access to just a few document libraries, your list will be small
enough that using the Favorites option is not worth the bother.
Creating a new document library
If you have the appropriate level of access to WSE, you can create a new doc-
ument library. Access the Document Libraries Catalog and follow these steps:
1. Click the New button.
The New Document Library form appears.
2. Fill out the form by giving your new document library a name.
You can also add a description if you like.
3. Click OK.
The Set Component Properties form appears.
4. Use the New Member Notification drop-down list to determine
whether or not the team members will be notified when new docu-
ments get posted.
5. Click OK.
A notification appears on-screen, telling you that the new document
library has been successfully created, as shown in Figure 10-6.
Of course, the only benefit to creating a document library is the ability to
post documents in it. For information about dealing with documents in docu-
ment libraries, check out Chapters 11 and 12.
Adding members to a document library
Usually, the first thing you want to do after creating a new document library
is set it up so that teammates have access to it and can begin contributing
documents. Use these steps to add members to your document library:
1. Open the document library.
The Document Manager page appears.
2. Click the Members button on the left side of the screen.
3. Choose Actions➪Add Members.
The Directory Search: Find People dialog box appears.
144
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

4. Enter the name of the person to whom you want to grant access in the
Search For field and click the Search button.
The Search results list displays the names of the people who match.
You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard in the Search For field. For exam-
ple, if you enter Lon*, WSE finds anyone whose name begins with Lon
(Londergan, for example). Entering an asterisk all by itself in the Search
For field displays all the entries in the directory, which is a cool trick if
you want to scroll through the list and select names at your leisure.
Figure 10-7 shows the Directory Search: Find People dialog box with
results of a search for lon*.
5. After you select the name(s) you want, click the Add button.
To select more than one name, hold down the Ctrl key when you click
each name.
6. Click OK.
WSE lets you know that your document library has been created and puts it in the catalog.

Finding your way around 
a document library
Figure 10-8 shows a sample document library. Although the document and
folder names in your document libraries will be different than the ones
shown here, certain parts of a document library are common to every docu-
ment library you use.
Use these parts of a document library:
 Document Manager toolbar: This toolbar contains buttons for interact-
ing with the documents and folders in the document library, including
the Import button, which I discuss in Chapter 12.
 Search: Type the name of a document in the Search in Current Folder
For field and click Search to find a document in the library.
 Document list: In the Name column, you see a list of documents in the
library; if the list takes up more than one screen, WSE automatically
Figure 10-7:

146
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

adds Jump to buttons at the top and bottom of the document list so you
can navigate through the documents.
 Folder list: The list on the left side of the screen shows you a list of fold-
ers. Each of these folders contains more documents.

In This Chapter
 Using and reading documents in a document library

 Searching and sorting documents
 Collaborating on documents
 Managing a document library
I
n Chapter 10, I introduce you to the basics of interacting with the
Document Libraries Catalog. I show you how to set up a document library
of your own, and show you the major facets and functions of the system. But
there’s a whole lot more to using a document library! In fact, how you use a
particular document library depends on its purpose and the function of your
team.
Sometimes, you use documents in the libraries as references. You and your
team access the files to read and interact with the content, but not to edit or
change them in any significant way.
In other cases, document libraries and the documents in them are very col-
laborative. The idea is that you and your team are constantly editing and
changing content; working together to produce the best and most compre-
hensive press release, marketing report, budget spreadsheet, RFP response,
or what have you.
Chapter 11 focuses more on how you use, organize, and manage document
libraries, but not so much about how you create and edit the contents of the
documents. Creating and editing content in a document library gets the
attention it deserves in Chapter 12.

Getting Familiar with Your Document
Access and Editing Rights
As is always the case with IBM Workplace Services Express, what you can see
and do in any given document library is determined by your role in that par-
ticular document library. Of course, your role in this document library isn’t
necessarily your role in that document library. Sometimes you can look with-
out touching; other times, you can delete documents with impunity.
For example, imagine a document library that acts as a reference for your
organization’s human resources policies — it tells you how much vacation
you get to take (never enough), how to qualify for health benefits, and how 
to get reimbursed for business expenses. In this kind of document library,
you can’t modify a darn thing. Look, but don’t dare touch!
Here’s a list of roles you may find assigned to you when you access various
document libraries:
 User: This role essentially means that you can read, but not edit, the
documents in the document library. That just makes sense — we can’t
have people outside the HR department editing those documents.
 Editor: Editors can make edits to a document, and even have the power
to delete their own documents. In the HR document library example,
employees in the HR department have editor access to the files, but
employees of the company have user access.
In most document libraries, and most teams, the large majority of people
have user status. Only a select few have editor status.
 Privileged user: In a collaborative team space, where you and your team
are working together to bring some new product to market, you need
more people to be able to post, edit, and delete their own documents, as
well as edit other people’s documents. The big difference between edi-
tors and privileged users? The latter can edit and delete anyone’s docu-
ments, while the former can edit and delete only their own.
The coveted rights most members of a team space vie for are the ability
to add and edit documents in a document library. If you’re a document
library owner (see the following bullet), you have to think about the
access level a given person has to a document library. On one hand, you
don’t want to give too many people the power to muck up your docu-
ments. On the other hand, if you give too few people the right access,
the library will be empty, and team members will harangue you for
access rights all the time.
150
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

 Owner: The owner of a team space (and the document library it con-
tains) has a much higher level of access. Owners, well, own the library,
so they have the power to grant and deny access levels to the other
people on the team. They can also modify or delete any document in the
library.
In a collaborative situation, the percentage of people who have privi-
leged user access — and can create and edit the documents in the docu-
ment library — is much higher than in a reference document library like
the one in my HR document library example.
 wpsDocReviewer: As you can see in Chapter 12, roles sometimes get a
little more complicated in a document library. Some users may have a
special role that enables them to approve draft documents from other
team members.
 Specially modified access roles: In large document libraries that con-
tain lots of documents and document folders, it’s often useful to define
your own roles, to help you determine who can see what. For example, if
you have a bunch of documents or folders that only certain people —
perhaps only sales managers — should see, WSE lets you define your
own roles and access levels to accomplish exactly that.
Using a Document Library
In the big picture, when you use a document library, you do one of three
things:
 Work with the document lists, wherein you can search for documents,
sort their titles, delete them (if you have the right to do so), and so on.
 Work with a particular document, usually to read its contents, or per-
haps to comment on it without making editorial changes to the content.
 Work on a document, editing its contents. (See Chapter 12.)
Figure 11-1 shows the Document Manager page, with a document library
that’s part of a marketing team’s team space. Because this particular docu-
ment library has more documents than can be displayed all at once, it has
Jump to buttons for navigating to the previous or next page of document
summaries.
The Document Manager page divides the document library into two areas; on
the right is the list view, which contains the items in the document library,
and on the left is the folder tree. Click the items in the folder tree to navigate
the subfolders and change the views in the document library.
151
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

What you select in the folder tree on the left determines what you see in the
list view on the right.
Working with documents
As you can see in Figure 11-1, the Document Manager lists each document by
title, and includes information about the author and the date on which the
document (or folder, or view) was last modified. As you’d expect, clicking 
the author’s name also indicates whether the individual is online.
To the left of each item in the list is a selection box, which you use to pick an
item, or items, in preparation for taking some action upon them. For example,
if you wanted to lock three documents to prevent your team from making 
any further edits to them, you simply click these boxes so that check marks
appear next to the three documents. Then choose More Actions➪Lock (see
Figure 11-2).

Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

The Document Manager page also contains icons to indicate what, exactly,
the item is, and what state it is in. Here’s a handy-dandy list of the icons
you’ll encounter in a document library:
 Folder: This icon indicates that the item isn’t a document at all, but a
collection of documents.
 View: This icon indicates that this collection of documents is organized
differently; perhaps it’s organized and sorted by a different column.
 Document: This icon indicates that the file has been created or imported;
for example, you might see this icon next to a Microsoft Excel worksheet.
 Locked: This icon indicates that a document has been locked (probably
by its owner). Locked documents can’t be edited.
 Pending drafts: This icon indicates that the document isn’t yet ready 
for the whole team. Pending drafts only appear in the summary if you
are the document’s owner or the person to whom it has been sent for
approval.
All three of these items have been selected.

153
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Working with folders
The folder tree is used to determine what files are listed in the Document
Manager; it also enables you to navigate among the various folders and views
in the library. You can nest folders (create a subfolder inside parent folders),
and the items listed in the folder tree can be expanded and collapsed by
clicking the + or – sign next to the folder in question.
Understanding the difference between a folder and a view
When you click an item in the folder tree, the list on the right automatically
displays the contents of that particular item. In the folder list, you will find
both folders and views.
You use folders to organize the documents in a document library. A folder 
is a collection of documents. Sometimes a folder also contains other folders.
A document ends up in a folder because a person put it there, as you see in
Chapter 12.
A view, on the other hand, is a little different. Like folders, views are used to
organize a document library. However, views differ from folders in that a
view’s contents are controlled programmatically. In other words, every view
has specific selection criteria, so that when you click the name of a view, only
the documents that match the view’s selection criteria appear. For example,
you may create a view to show all of the documents created by a particular
member of the team, or a view that shows all of the documents that have the
word August in their title. You can create as many views as you need in order
to slice and dice the documents whichever way you want.
A document appears in a folder because a person put it there; but a docu-
ment appears in a view because it matches the selection criteria you built 
for a view.
Navigating through the folder tree
You can hide the folder tree altogether by clicking the aptly-named Hide
Folders link (refer to Figure 11-1) at the bottom of the folder tree; click the
equally well-named Show Folders link to bring the folder tree back.
The most important entry in the folder tree is that one at the very top, 
which is called the root. (Trees, root, you get it, right?) The root is important
because it’s like a home page of the document library. If you’re using an espe-
cially large document library with lots of documents, and lots of folders and
subfolders, you might get lost or disoriented. Click the root to go back to the
top of the folder hierarchy. In Figure 11-2, the root is called Marketing Team.
I’ve always bought in to the whole tree metaphor to understand the way fold-
ers and nested folders work in a document library, but the word root is a little 
154
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

misleading because the root is the topmost, highest level view of a document
library. In nature, of course, roots are underneath and at the bottom. To mix
this awkward arbor metaphor with another, think of clicking the topmost
item in a folder tree as a means of quickly getting back home. Just pretend
you’re a friend of Dorothy, and click your heels twice.
When you click a folder’s name in the folder tree, one, or maybe two, things
happen:
 The list on the right changes to show you only the documents and fold-
ers that are contained in the folder you clicked. Because a folder can
contain both documents and other folders, you are likely to see both
folders and documents in the list.
 The second thing that happens, sometimes, is that the folder tree itself
expands to show the folder’s subfolders. This change only occurs in the
folder tree if the folder you click contains one or more subfolders.
Figure 11-3 shows a document library with nested folders. As you can see in
the figure, the contents of the Client-Ready Materials subfolder are displayed
in the list, including a document and a subfolder (called My New Folder). This
same subfolder also appears in the folder tree, listed under the parent folder
Client-Ready Materials (which itself is a subfolder of the Sales Kit folder).
Click to hide folder list.

Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Creating a new folder
Create a new folder in a document library to give your team a way to organize
documents. Figure 11-4 shows the new folder form that you use to add a
folder to a document library.
Use the following steps to create a new folder:
1. Select the folder that will contain the new folder.
Select the root to have the new folder appear at the highest level of your
library’s folder tree, or select an existing folder if you want your new
folder to be a subfolder.
2. Choose New➪Folder.
The New Folder form appears.
3. Enter the name of the folder in the Folder Name field.
If you want, you can also add a few words describing the folder’s pur-
pose in the Description field.
4. Click OK.
The new folder is created, and it is selected in the folder tree. The list
view is empty, of course, because new folders are empty until someone
on the team puts documents in them.
Figure 11-4:
Creating a
new folder.
156
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

If you’ve used Windows Explorer, you are probably used to moving files and
folders with a quick movement of the mouse. But in the document libraries,
you can’t move a folder after it has been created. If you find that you have a
folder in the wrong place (say as a subfolder of the wrong folder), the only
way to move it is to essentially delete it altogether and then recreate it in its
proper location. But deleting a folder also permanently removes the folder’s
contents, so deleting and recreating folders can become a relatively time-
consuming process that involves moving each document in the folder to its
new location.
Deleting a folder
Deleting a folder also deletes its contents, including documents, subfolders,
and all the documents in the subfolders. Don’t delete a folder unless you’re
really sure you’re done with the contents. IBM Workplace Services Express
doesn’t give you a way to bring these files and folders back.
Use these steps to delete a folder:
1. In the folder tree on the left, click the name of the parent folder that
contains the subfolder you want to delete.
The list view shows the contents of the folder you selected, including all
documents and subfolders.
2. In the list view on the right, select the folder you want to delete by
clicking the selection box next to its name.
3. Choose More Actions➪Delete.
The Confirmation dialog box appears.
4. If you’re sure you want to delete the folder and all its contents, 
click OK.
The folder and all its contents are gone, forever.
Deciding who can use a folder
By default, the access settings for a folder are inherited from its parent. If you
create a folder called January inside a folder called Sales Reports, for exam-
ple, anyone who has access to the Sales Reports folder automatically has
access to the January folder, too. Folders at the top level of the folder tree
inherit their access from the document library’s access list, and a document
library inherits its access level from the team space in which it is contained.
That sounds like a complicated list of rules, but it actually makes your life
easier. More often than not, the access you want to provide for that subfolder
is the same access you want to provide for its parent, and even the whole doc-
ument library and team space; as long as you have set up the right access
rights and have defined the right roles for the team space, your January folder
has the right level of access too. (Setting access levels for a team space is cov-
ered in Chapter 7.)
157
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

The only time you need to sweat the access list for a particular folder is if
you want a particular folder’s access list to be different than all the rest.
Imagine, for example, a sales team place, that contains a document library. 
In the document library there’s a folder called Sales Reports, and that folder
contains 13 subfolders. Folders 1 through 12 are for the months of the year —
January, February, March, and so on. The 13th folder is different, however. It’s
called Commission Statements, and is used by your sales managers. You want
that folder’s contents to be off limits to everyone except the sales managers.
The access level for the whole team space is already set to give the sales
team access, and that access level is inherited all the way down to the
monthly sales folders, so you don’t have to do anything special to give the
team access to those 12 folders.
You do, however, have to set up a more restricted access list for the Commis-
sion Statements folder so that just the sales managers have access to it, its
subfolders, and any of their contents.
Use these steps to set the access rights for a folder:
1. Navigate to the folder whose access level you want to change.
The list view shows the contents of the folder.
2. Choose Folder Actions➪Set Access to This Folder.
The Resource Permissions page appears. See Figure 11-5.
3. Select the roles that you want to have access to the folder by clicking
in the check box(es) of the roles on the Resource Permissions page.
These roles will also have access to all the contents of the folder (includ-
ing subfolders).
4. Click OK.
Inheritance is the coin of the WSE access realm, so changing a folder’s access
level so that it can be used only by certain members of the team means that
the documents in the folder (and any subfolders in the folder) will only be
accessible to people with that role, too.
See Chapter 15 to read about defining the roles that you have available on the
Resource Permissions page.
158
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Renaming a folder or changing its description
If the content or purpose of a folder changes, you may feel like you need to
change the folder’s name, too. Or maybe your esoteric naming system is only
memorable and descriptive to you. Whatever reason you may have to change
a folder’s name or description, you can use these steps to make the neces-
sary changes:
1. Navigate to the folder whose properties you want to change.
The list view shows the contents of the folder.
2. Choose Folder Actions➪Edit Folder Properties.
The Edit Folder Properties form appears.
3. Enter the new name and/or description.
4. If you want to announce the folder’s new name to members of the
team, click Send a Link to These People and then click the Add button
to select the names of the people you want to notify.
5. Click OK.

Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Creating a view
Views provide a way to organize the documents in a library. Every view has
its own selection criteria, which WSE uses to determine which documents to
display when you select the view. Unlike folders, views can’t be nested. In
fact, views are always displayed at the top, root level of a document library.
You can’t have a view inside a folder.
To create a new view, choose New➪View. Figure 11-6 shows the View Criteria
form that appears.
Although the most common views are based on document filenames, a view’s
selection criteria can also be based on the documents’ titles, descriptions,
authors, languages, or creation and modification dates.
Views are especially useful in large document libraries with many levels of
nested folders. Such libraries, although admittedly well organized, present
navigation challenges; team members may not know where in the hierarchy
particular folders and documents are scattered, for example. The selection
Figure 11-6:

View
Criteria form
to name a
view and

which
documents
it displays.
160
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

criteria associated with a view transcends the folder hierarchy, and the view
displays all the matching documents, no matter how deeply buried they may
be in the library’s folder hierarchy.
If a given member of the team doesn’t have the role required to see a given
document, that document isn’t displayed when that person uses that view,
even if the document meets all the other criteria.
Establishing the criteria for the new view is just a matter of filling out the
form and entering the appropriate search terms in the appropriate field(s).
Here are some tips:
 View names can contain spaces; however, asterisks (*), question marks
(?), greater than (>) and less than (<) signs, percent signs (%), at signs
(@), forward (/) and backward (\) slashes, apostrophes (’), double
quotes (“ ”), pipes (|), colons (:), plus signs (+), pound signs (#), and
ampersands (&) can’t be included.
 For each criteria you enter — title for example — use the drop-down list
to determine whether you want the view to display documents that
match all of the words you have entered in the criteria field, or the exact
phrase you entered in the criteria phrase, or at least one of the words,
or none of the words.
 You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard in the Filename, Title, Description,
and Author fields.
 Use the Case Sensitive check box if you want words to match exactly.
For example, if you click in this check box, the view displays titles like
SALES REPORTS, but not sales reports.
 Use the date range fields at the bottom if you want the dates that docu-
ments were created or last edited to be a part of the view’s selection 
criteria.
 You can combine multiple criteria (documents created by Stephen
Londergan in January, for example) by using the Combine Criteria With
drop-down list. Select And if you want the view to display documents
that match all of the criteria fields you fill out; select Or if you want the
view to display documents that match any of the criteria.
 Click OK when you’re finished defining the selection criteria.
Getting a jumpstart on view criteria
How many times have you been at a cocktail party, bris, or wedding recep-
tion, when someone said to you, “Geez, I wish I could think of reasons to
create views in my WSE document libraries”? Well, now you know how to
161
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

answer that question. Armed with this list, you’ll never be at a loss for words
or without ideas on how views can help your team sort through the docu-
ments in a document library:
 By Author: Create a view to display all of the documents that were cre-
ated by a certain person.
 By Date: Create a view with date-based criteria to show all the docu-
ments that were added in a given month, quarter, or year.
 By File Type: For example, if you’re looking for photographs, use *.jpg
in the filename field to display all the JPEG files in the library. Or you can
create a view that shows all of the Microsoft Word documents that have
been posted by using *.doc in the filename criteria field.
 By Project or Customer: Use the * wildcard, the title, and the
Description field criteria to show all of the documents related to a par-
ticular project or initiative. (Of course, this option only works if your
team is responsible about always including the name of the project or
customer in the description for the documents members create.)
Views, by their very nature, are used to limit the number of documents that
are being displayed, and are only worth creating in large document libraries.
If you have a document library with only a few documents, creating a bunch
of views to manipulate those few documents just isn’t worth the trouble.
Deleting a view
Use these steps to delete a view:
1. Click the name of the document library’s root.
The list view shows all of the contents of the document library.
2. Select the view you want to delete by clicking in the selection box
next to its name in the list view.
3. Choose More Actions➪Delete.
The confirmation dialog box appears.
4. If you’re sure you want to delete the view and all of its contents, 
click OK.
The view is deleted.
Deleting a view is significantly less dangerous than deleting a folder, because
deleting a view doesn’t delete the documents that match the view’s selection
criteria.
162
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Finding the Documents You Need
The more you and your team use document libraries, the more important
knowing how to search becomes. Document libraries with lots of documents
and complicated hierarchies of nested folders often require a whole lot of
(perhaps too much) clicking and navigating to find just the document you
need. WSE has a built-in search facility that automatically indexes the docu-
ments in a document library, to make them easy to find.
The WSE search engine indexes both the metadata (each document’s file-
name, title, author, and so on) as well as the document’s content, so perform-
ing a search means WSE actually examines the body of the documents as it
build its list of hits.
When you search in a document library, you only get hits from the documents
in that library that match your search criteria. If you want to search multiple
document libraries, use the Search button in the WSE Navigation bar.
You can also find documents by using views, which I cover earlier in this
chapter in the section “Creating a view.”
Conducting simple searches
WSE displays the Search field and button at the top of every folder, so it’s
easy to use and always on hand. Searches are automatically reduced in scope
so that they focus on the current folder, which means that entering a word or
phrase in the Search For field and clicking the Search button only finds
matching documents in the folder that’s currently selected.
To search the entire document library, make sure you click the document
library’s root before starting your search.
Figure 11-7 shows the results of a simple search for the documents in the
library that contain the word sales. The results list works very much like any
other list view, but does not include the folder tree. You can read, edit, and
delete the documents as you would in any other document list.
Click the name of the document library (in Figure 11-7, the name of the docu-
ment library is Marketing Team) to clear the search results and return to the
folder tree and document list.
163
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Using the Advanced Search page
WSE enables you to be more particular in your search with Advanced
Searches, which is shown in Figure 11-8 and displayed in WSE when you click
the Advanced Search link.
As you can see in the figure, an advanced search lets you use the Include in
Search radio buttons to narrow the search to just the title, perhaps, or just
the document’s author. You can also widen the scope of the search to the
entire document library, and/or search for documents that are in a particular
language.
To perform an advanced search, enter your search terms and click the Search
button.
WSE isn’t multilingual, so it doesn’t know on its own whether a document
was written in English, Cantonese, or French. It bases its language search
results on what the author says about the language. As you see in Chapter 12,
when you or a member of your team creates a new document, one of the
fields WSE asks for is the language in which the document is written. The
Language of Search String drop-down list only works if your team has been
responsible about selecting the right language for each and every posted
document.
Figure 11-7:
The results
of a simple
search.
164
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Sorting documents
Another easy way to find documents it to sort the items in a document
library. Every folder’s contents can be sorted by the Name, Author, or Last
Modified column, in either ascending or descending order. Just click the
name of the column to sort and reorder the contents of a folder.
Managing Documents
Chapter 12 contains more detail than you can imagine on how to create new
documents and edit existing ones, but this section is your first stop if you want
to know how to manage existing documents. Managing documents includes
downloading, reading, and locking documents. Your ability to manage docu-
ments is, of course, based on the level of access you have to the team space,
library, folder, or document in question.

165
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Downloading documents
You can download any document in a document library. Downloading docu-
ments essentially puts a copy of the document onto your computer’s hard
drive for your personal use.
If you intend to edit a document in a team space and make your revisions and
edits available to the team, downloading the document is very clearly not the
way to go. (I discuss editing content with or for the team in Chapter 12.)
Downloading a document is of fairly limited use because you are only getting
a copy of the file. You should only download files that you intend to use for
particular purposes. For example, in a library of human resources forms, you
may need to download a claim form so that you can fill it out and mail it to
your insurance company for reimbursement for those new eyeglasses (they
look great, by the way).
166
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 
Configuring your browser to download documents
Use these steps to configure Internet Explorer
to download files from a WSE document library:
1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Choose Tools➪Folder Options.
The Folder Options window opens.
3. Click the File Types tab.
4. Select the extension you want to configure
from the Registered File Types list.
For example, select DOC to associate that
extension with Microsoft Word documents.
5. Click Advanced.
The Edit File Type window opens.
6. Choose Actions➪Open.
7. Ensure that the Confirm Open After
Download option is checked.
8. Click OK to save your settings and return to
the Folder Options window.
9. Click Close to save your changes.
Use these steps to configure Netscape Navigator
to download files from a WSE document library:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options window opens.
3. Expand the Navigator Category and select
Helper Applications.
4. Click New Type.
5. Type unknown in both the MIME Type and
Extension fields.
6. Select Save It to Disk.
7. Click OK to save your settings and return to
the Preferences window.
8. Click OK to save your changes.
Repeat this process for other file types that you
plan to download.

You can download a document, make the changes to it, and then upload it
back to the document library. Although that is technically possible, it’s not a
good idea because you have no way of eliminating the possibility that some-
one else comes along, makes changes to the document, and reposts it, there-
fore putting two versions of the file into circulation. In Chapter 12, I show you
the built-in WSE features that facilitate creating and editing documents.
You’ve been warned.
To download a copy of a document, open the document in question and
choose More Actions➪Download.
What happens next depends on the way your browser is configured; if it’s a
Word document, Microsoft Word probably opens and loads the document
automatically. Other kinds of documents may get automatically saved to your
computer’s hard drive so you have to start the program in order to open and
work with the document.
Reading documents
Opening a document to view and read its contents is easy; just click the docu-
ment’s name in the list view. The list view is replaced by the document you
clicked, as you can see in Figure 11-9.
WSE automatically renders the contents of the document, so that you (and
your team) can view its contents with your Web browser. This is important,
because it means that someone who is reading a WSE document doesn’t need
to have the software that was used to create it in the first place. For example,
anyone on the team can view the contents of a Microsoft Word document,
without having to start (or even purchase) Microsoft Word.
This rule applies to any program, not just Microsoft Office. Even though 
most of the content in your WSE document libraries probably originates in
Microsoft Office, WSE works with just about anything. When you open a doc-
ument in a WSE document library, you don’t know if it’s a PDF, Word docu-
ment, Excel spreadsheet, photograph, or database file. And that’s half the
point of using WSE in the first place.
In Figure 11-9, you see links at the top of a WSE document. You can use the
links to view the next document in the folder or the previous document in the
folder. The Back to Folder link closes the document and returns you to the
document list and folder tree (I suspect that you’ll use this link most often).
167
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Locking and unlocking documents 
and folders
A locked document or folder is one whose contents can’t be changed. Select
the document(s) or folder(s) in question in the list view, and choose More
Actions➪Lock. Locking a document prevents everyone (including you) from
editing or deleting the document.
As you can see earlier in this chapter in the section “Working with docu-
ments,” locked documents are highlighted as such in the list view with a 
special padlocked document icon.
To unlock a document or folder and let the whole team edit it, select the doc-
ument(s) or folder(s) in question in the list view, and choose More Actions➪
Unlock.
Use these links to navigate between documents.
Click here to access the document in its native format.

168
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Locking documents is a convenient way to prevent people from making a
change to a document, and to let the team know that the document in ques-
tion is finished. Although I just provided pretty easy instructions for unlock-
ing a document, the access settings in most document libraries are such that
most people can’t unlock a document after it’s been locked. Wouldn’t that
defeat the whole purpose of locking it in the first place?
Collaborating in a Document Library
The most important and interesting kind of collaboration that takes place in a
document library is all about the creating and editing of documents — setting
up a document library, for example, so that people can work together to pro-
duce content, edit one another’s documents, and so on. This is such an
essential part of WSE in general and document libraries in particular that 
all of Chapter 12 is focused on exactly that.
But in advance of Chapter 12, there are a couple of other cool things you can
do in a WSE document library to make a document library and its contents
more collaborative.
Finding ways to interact with an author
You have a few ways to interact with a document’s author, or a folder’s
owner. Figure 11-10 shows you what happens when you click an author’s
name. You can interact in any of the following ways:
 Show Person Record: Choose this option to look up the person in your
organization’s directory; this is a useful option if you need to know more
about the person than is shown when you click his or her name.
 Send E-mail: Choose this option if you need to communicate with the
person and he or she isn’t available for a chat session.
 Start Chat: When you’re working with the list view, or have opened a
document to read, you can send the document’s author an instant mes-
sage if you have a question or need clarification about the document.
(Or how about just sending an IM to tell the author what a good job he
or she did? It’s not always about your needs, you know.) See Chapter 9
for more information on chatting.
 Add to Instant Contacts: Choose this option to make the person one of
your buddies.
169
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Commenting on documents
You can comment on a document in a document library, if you have some
words of wisdom to add or clarification to make. Other people in the team
can read and respond to comments, so you can have a discussion of sorts
about a particular document, right in the context of the document itself.
To view the comments that your team has made about a document, click the
Comments link at the top of the document. Usually, this button is immedi-
ately below the Edit button.
If you don’t see a Comments link on a document, but you see a New Comment
link instead; that just means that you’ll be the first person to chime in.
Figure 11-11 shows a short discussion thread about the Sales Planning
spreadsheet.
To add a comment to a document, open the document and click the New
Comment link, or, if the document already has a raging discussion, open the
document’s comments and click either the New or Reply button, and fill 
out the New Comment form, as shown in Figure 11-12. Click OK when you’re
finished.

Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Sending a link
WSE has a built-in way to notify members of the team about changes to a doc-
ument library. You can send a link to members of the team so that they can
easily access the new version of the document, renamed folder, or what have
you. You can send a link to any document, folder, or view.
Sending a link has two big benefits. First, and probably most obvious, it lets
people know that there is a new or revised document, an especially useful
tool if you have a big team working in stages on the same documents.
Second, it reduces e-mail clutter, because you’re sending a link via e-mail, 
as opposed to sending the 47MB (megabyte) document itself.
To send a link, open or select the document, folder, or view you want to tell
the team about, and then choose More Actions➪Send Link.
Use the Add button to pick the names of the people who you want to receive
the link to the document, folder, or view via e-mail. Enter comments, if you
have any, in the Comments field and click OK.
Figure 11-13 shows the Send a Link form.

Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Managing Document Libraries 
as an Administrator
If you have administrator rights to WSE, you can manage a document library
through the WSE administrator, often abbreviated as admin. The easiest way
to tell whether you have this level of access is to look for the Administration
link in the toolbar at the top of the WSE page. If you see it, you have adminis-
trative rights to WSE, and if you don’t, you don’t.
Use these steps to manage a document library:
1. Log in as an administrator.
2. Click the Administration link in the toolbar.
3. Click Portal Content in the Navigator.
4. Click Manage Document Libraries.
The Document Library Manager appears, as shown in Figure 11-14.
Figure 11-14:
Managing
WSE
document
libraries.
173
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

Because just about every team space has a document library, it’s not surpris-
ing that there are a lot of libraries in the list.
As you can see in the figure, each document library has five buttons you can
click to interact with it:
 Import files to document library: This button offers a quick and easy
way to load a whole bunch of documents into a document library, all in
one fell swoop.
 Copy Document Library: Before you had one document library, after
you had two. Why would you want to copy a document library? Good
question. But you can.
 Edit Document Library: Click this button to change a document
library’s properties.
 Access Control: Click this button to control the roles associated with
the document library.
 Delete Document Library: Click this button to remove the document
library, and all of its contents, forever.
Importing files
If you’re going to import documents to WSE, it’s usually because it’s a brand-
new document library, into which you want to upload a bunch of existing
content. If, for example, you had previously been using shared folders on
your local area network to distribute files to a team, importing them is the
best way to load those documents into WSE document libraries, instead.
Although Chapter 12 discusses importing an individual document, importing
through the Document Library Manager gives you (as an administrator) more
control over the import process, and (most important) enables you to import
more than one file at a time.
You can import files in one of three ways, the second of which is the method
you’ll likely use most often:
 From the server file system: Choose this option when the files to be
imported are located on the WSE server.
If the files you’re importing are located on the server’s hard drive, click
the Import from Server File System field and enter the path to the files in
the Server Directory field.
174
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

 From the client file system: Choose this option when the files to be
imported are on your own hard drive or network drive.
If the files you’re importing are located on your computer, click the
Import from Client File System field and use either the Select Files or
Select File Directory button to find the files you want to import.
 HTTP import: Choose this option to create a document in the library
based on the elements of a Web page you specify.
If you are importing the contents of a Web page, click the HTTP Import
field and enter the Root URL of the page you want to import.
If you choose to import the files from the server’s file system or if you
choose an HTTP import, you can also schedule the import to take place
at a later time, clicking the Import Content as a Background Process
field, and using the Start Date and Start Time fields to pick the time.
Figure 11-15 shows the Import Files form.
Figure 11-15:
Importing
files into a
document
library.
175
Chapter 11: Don’t Just Sit There, Get Involved with Document Libraries

The Add Files to Path field tells WSE where, in the document library’s folder
hierarchy, to put the documents you are about to import. If you leave this
field blank, the files end up in the document library’s root; if that’s not where
you want them, you should enter a more specific folder name, such as Sales
Reports.
If you enter a folder name that does not exist, WSE creates the folder as it
imports the files.
When you import files from the client file system (also known as your com-
puter), the files are imported immediately.
Editing a library’s properties
Click the Edit Document Library button to change various document library
settings, such as its title, version control settings, and so on. Figure 11-16
shows the document library properties form.
Figure 11-16:
Managing a
document
library’s
properties.
176
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Here’s a list of properties you can change:
 Document library name: The default name that WSE assigns to a docu-
ment library that is created as part of a team space is fairly nonsensical,
something like _35_0O40I1HT9A0SHU2P_4JI (it rolls off the tongue
nicely, doesn’t it?). Use the document library properties form to give a
document library a more reasonable name, such as Marketing Team
Document Library. Although this isn’t a required change, it sure makes
WSE document libraries just a tiny bit easier to find and manage.
 Versions of documents: As you see in Chapter 12, WSE document
libraries store multiple versions of a document, by default; every time a
document is edited, WSE stores the older version in the document
library for future reference. You can turn this feature off, if you don’t
need multiple versions of a document to be preserved, by clicking the
Disable Document Versioning radio button.
 Document workflow features: Workflow is a WSE feature that optionally
enables new documents to be routed to certain members of the team
before they are published and made available for the wider team to see.
Click the Enable Workflow radio button to turn on this feature (it’s off by
default, unlike document versioning), and then use the Approvers field
to determine the name of the group to whom those draft documents will
be sent.
 Document locking: This feature is turned on by default, and is one that
you probably should leave turned on. When a member of the team edits
a document, for example, WSE automatically locks the document so that
no one else can edit that document at the same time.
Managing access control
Click the Access Control button to manage the permissions associated with
the document library.
The Resource Permissions form, shown in Figure 11-17, appears. Use this
form to edit the role membership for the document library. If, for example,
you need to add a person to the Manager role, click the Edit Role button on
the right, and then use the Add button on the Edit Manager form to select the
name of the person, people, or group who will be granted Manager access to
the document library.

Chapter 12
Working with Documents
In This Chapter
 Making your team more productive with document management
 Creating and editing documents
 Using the built-in WSE document editors
 Working with drafts, approvals, and versions
 Fine-tuning the document library
Just about every team or project has a need to produce content. No matter
how big or small your company is, and no matter what business you’re in,
you probably churn out documents by the gazillion.
Adding and managing content — such as word-processing documents,
spreadsheets, presentations, PDFs, images, and anything else you can think
of — are two of the most common activities in a team space, and this chapter
is where you should start if you want to create, edit, and manage content.
Because teams spend so much time cranking it out, IBM Workplace Services
Express puts a lot of effort into making it easy to create and share content.
WSE also provides some pretty cool and innovative ways for a content-based
team to work together. Think of the built-in IM functions, or the ability to
send users a link to a document, which I discuss in Chapter 11.
Improving Productivity with Document
Management Tools
One of the central promises that WSE makes is about team productivity —
making it easier for teams to do what they need to do in less time. In the sim-
plest case, that might be making it easier for a person (you or a member of
your team) to produce a new document; just reducing the amount of time
and clicks it takes to get a new document published and shared, for example.

But there’s more to team productivity than saved mouse clicks. Lots of
teams, whether they realize it or not, come together to make decisions; they
decide how to market new products, how to respond to a customer RFP, or
how to deal with some new market opportunity or competitive threat. So if
you consider all the clicks WSE saves teams as they create their documents,
and add to that the streamlined way teams can operate by having the docu-
ments and content they need so easily accessible from WSE document
libraries, you’ll find WSE just makes every project go down smoother.
Microsoft Office, anyone?
Have you ever heard of Microsoft Office? Just kidding. Since Microsoft Word’s
debut in 1989, Office has pretty much taken the world by storm, and is the de
facto standard for producing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
Not surprisingly, WSE works very well with Office, with built-in features that
allow you to use Office to create documents, which you then share with WSE.
However, Office isn’t always the answer — particularly for people who use
WSE to consume (read) content; that’s why, for example, WSE automatically
renders Office documents. WSE transforms Office documents into Web pages,
so that readers don’t need Office to see what’s in those files. Most would
agree that Office excels (pardon the pun) at producing documents, spread-
sheets, and presentations, but sometimes Office just isn’t necessary. Here are
a few reasons it’s so great that WSE works around Microsoft Office:
 No need to buy Office for employees who will never use it: As you see
in Chapter 11, many teams have more readers than they do editors. For
example, say you have 100 people using a human resources document
library; maybe only 10 of those 100 produce content for the HR library.
All the rest are just readers. Buying those other 90 people a copy of
Microsoft Office just doesn’t make sense, at least not for the sake of
accessing the HR document library. (Of course maybe you’d buy them
Microsoft Office for other reasons.)
 If you have Linux, Office won’t work anyway: Sometimes Office isn’t
the right answer for producing documents. More and more companies
use Linux for their desktops, and those people all need another choice,
because Microsoft Office doesn’t run on Linux.
 Team members outside your company can still read documents: WSE
teams probably include employees of your company, along with one or
two members who aren’t — maybe a business partner or a customer. In
that scenario, it’s impractical to assume that your business partner has
the same version of Office that your employees use, and it’s unwise to
demand that your customer upgrade.
180
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Microsoft Office is clearly the best choice for many companies and in many situ-
ations. (Most of this book was written in Microsoft Word, by the way.) But it’s
not the only game in town. WSE broadens your horizons a bit, content-wise, so
that you can think about other ways teams interact with document and content.
Shifting your document paradigm
Isn’t paradigm an obnoxious word? Fancy nomenclature aside, the point is
that you create documents a little differently with WSE than you do without
it. That’s not to say that you use Word any differently than you have for the
past ten years. Rather, it’s the process that’s different.
Say that you need to write a new draft of a press release to share with your
team. In the old days (before the dawn of WSE, circa 2004), you would start
Word in your computer and write your opus. Then you’d save the file
(Opus.doc) on your computer and either print it (gasp!) or, more likely,
e-mail the thing around to your team as an attachment.
What’s different in the world of WSE is just that first step — when you sit
down to write the press release, you start with WSE. You still use Word to
create the press release, but because you begin the document in WSE, it is
automatically saved in the document library; it’s automatically uploaded to
the server — and that means, among other things, that you don’t have to
e-mail it around.
There are a million reasons why having documents on the server is good for
business: Among other things, you can save the steps of having to upload it,
reduce e-mail traffic, and make the press release immediately available to the
team. Putting a Word document directly into a document library means you
can use workflow to get the document approved and use WSE version track-
ing to preserve changes, too.
Using Microsoft Office 
to Create Documents
Figure 12-1 shows a document library; as you can see, you can click the New
button to create a new Microsoft Office document.
The next section describes the steps for creating a new document; see
Chapter 11 for steps to import an already-existing document into a WSE docu-
ment library.
181
Chapter 12: Working with Documents

The following steps show you how to create a new Office document:
1. Open the document library to which you want the new document to
be saved.
2. Open the folder, if appropriate, in the library where you want the
document to be saved.
You can always move a document to a different folder, after the fact, as
you can see later in this chapter.
3. Choose New➪Microsoft Word (.doc).
If you’re creating a spreadsheet, choose Microsoft Excel (.xls); if you’re
creating a presentation, choose Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt).
The New Document form appears.
4. Enter the title for the document in the Title field.
WSE automatically fills in the filename for you, based on what you enter
in the Title field. Although you can change the filename, you always
interact with the document by its Title, which means that filenames in
WSE are a lot less important than you’re used to them being.

Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

5. Optionally, enter a comment about the document in the Description
field.
6. Choose the document’s language from the Document Language list.
WSE isn’t multilingual; choosing the language is useful if you (or some-
one on your team) want to limit a search to documents in a particular
language.
7. Click the Open File button.
Although this button’s name is 100 percent technically accurate, I wish
this button said “Start Word and let me edit my document,” because
that’s really what it does.
8. If the Document Manager plug-in dialog box is displayed, click OK.
After you click OK, Microsoft Word (or Excel or PowerPoint) starts. If you
don’t see this dialog box, the Microsoft application opens on its own.
9. Create your document, build your spreadsheet, or do whatever you
need to do in Office.
10. When you’re finished with the document, choose File➪Save and
File➪Exit.
Microsoft Office closes, and you return to the WSE New Document form.
As you can see in Figure 12-2, there’s one more step to finish the docu-
ment and upload it to the document library.
11. Click the Publish button.
When you click the Publish button, watch for the Saving to Document
Manager dialog box, which is shown in Figure 12-3.
You may not see a Publish button; you may see a Submit for Approval
button, instead (see Chapter 11 for more on workflow and the Submit for
Approval button).
Figure 12-2:

183
Chapter 12: Working with Documents

Depending on the size of the file you created, it may take a few moments for
WSE to upload the file. At this stage, WSE renders the document so that
people can read it even if they don’t have Office. You don’t have to do any-
thing special — WSE takes care of converting the file automatically.
When the upload and conversion process is complete, you’re returned to the
folder you selected in Step 2, and you see your new document listed, in all its
glory, among all the rest.
When all is said and done, WSE stores your document two separate ways.
First, the Office file (.doc, .xls, or .ppt file) is attached to and stored in the
document library, should you need to edit it later. Second, the file is con-
verted to a Web page so that people can read it with their browser. I include
this tip in the interest of full disclosure, and for intrepid readers who wonder
how they’ll be able to edit their Office documents after they’re uploaded and
converted for the team. Fear not, dear reader; your file is there.
If you want to save the document without making it available to the team —
maybe it’s lunch time, or maybe you’re at the office and want to save and
upload your draft so that you can edit it later, from home — click the Save as
Private Draft button in Step 11. If you save document as a private draft, the
team can’t see it; only you can.
Creating Documents with 
the Document Editors
IBM Workplace Services Express includes a way to create simple documents
without using Microsoft Office. Using these tools, you can create simple
word-processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. These tools
are officially called the productivity components, or more simply, the editors.
Figure 12-3:

library.
184
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

If your goal is to write the great American novel, or a complex, multipage sta-
tistical analysis spreadsheet, the productivity components aren’t for you.
You’d be better served by Microsoft Office. If, however, you and your team
have humbler intentions, and need to produce a simple document quickly,
WSE’s built-in editors may be just the ticket. As a group, the editors are the
cornerstone of WSE productivity; imagine the team with a mixture of
Windows users and Linux users, or a team with some people who work at
your company and some people who don’t.
Creating documents with the WSE editors
Creating a document with the editors is very much the same as the steps out-
lined in the previous section “Using Microsoft Office to Create Documents,”
except that in Step 3 you choose New➪Rich Text Editor File, New➪
Spreadsheet Editor File, or New➪Presentation Editor File.
If you’re creating a new file with one of the WSE editors, when you click the
Open File button in Step 7, the built-in editor window opens.
With Linux operating systems, WSE uses a special applet to communicate
with your workstation, so you need to install a supported Java Runtime
Environment (JRM) on your browser. Chapter 19 offers more information.
Make sure your browser allows pop-up windows. WSE editors won’t run if the
automatically generated windows are blocked.
I’ve noticed when I travel that the TV remote control at hotels always has a
sticker on the back that says This device will not work outside of
Motel 8. Sometimes the remote is even bolted to the table. (Maybe you get
to stay in better hotels.) Similar rules apply to the WSE editor files; they only
work in WSE. You can’t, for example, use the Spreadsheet Editor to save a
spreadsheet locally on your own hard drive. The files you create with WSE’s
rich text, spreadsheet, and presentation tools have to be saved in a WSE doc-
ument library.
Introducing the Spreadsheet Editor
WSE’s Spreadsheet Editor functions much like any other spreadsheet; it 
organizes information in rows and columns. The individual cells in a row or
column are named by the coordinates (A1, B7, and so on), and each cell can
contain a label, number, or formula.
185
Chapter 12: Working with Documents

Spreadsheets are all about the formulas you can put in a cell; what makes
spreadsheets special is that when you change a number somewhere in
the spreadsheet, the effect on the entire spreadsheet can be seen immediately.
The Spreadsheet Editor has formatting commands to determine how the con-
tents of a cell will be displayed — bold, font size, number of decimal places,
and the like.
Figure 12-4 shows the WSE Spreadsheet Editor. You can find a list of spread-
sheet formulas and functions in Appendix F.
Using the Spreadsheet Editor’s Edit bar
The Spreadsheet Editor’s Edit bar contains buttons for formatting cells in
your spreadsheet. Here’s a set of buttons and what they do:
 Save: Saves the spreadsheet.
 Print: Prints the spreadsheet.
 Cut: Cuts a selection to the Clipboard.
 Copy: Copies a selection to the Clipboard.

Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

 Paste: Pastes a selection from the Clipboard into the selected cell(s).
 Copy Format: Copies the format of selected cells (but not the contents).
 Sum: Adds the selected cells.
 Bold: Applies bold to the selected cell(s).
 Italic: Italicizes the selected cell(s).
 Underline: Underlines the selected cell(s).
 Background Color: Chooses the background color for the selected
cell(s).
 Text Color: Changes the font color.
 Cell Border: Adds a border to a cell.
 Align Left: Makes contents of a cell flush left.
 Center: Centers the contents of a selected cell.
 Align Right: Makes a cell flush right.
 Check Spelling: Checks the spelling of the selected cell(s).
187
Chapter 12: Working with Documents
Changing the size of a spreadsheet
When you create a new spreadsheet, by default
the spreadsheet contains eight columns (A
through H) and 20 rows. Choose File➪Set 
Size to use the Set Size dialog box to make 
the spreadsheet larger or smaller. You can 
also choose Tools➪Insert Row or Tools➪Insert
Column to add rows and columns. Similarly,
choose Tools➪Delete Row or Tools➪Delete
Column to individually add and delete rows and
columns.
Of course, the smaller the spreadsheet the
better.

Using the Spreadsheet Editor’s menus
The Spreadsheet Editor’s Menu toolbar provides drop-down menus that offer
the following options:
 File: Save, Set Size, Print, and Close.
 Edit: Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste Values, Clear, Fill Down, Fill Right, and Macros.
 Tools: Insert rows and columns, delete rows and columns, change row
heights and column widths, sort the spreadsheet, and hide the spread-
sheet grid lines.
 Format: Change cell’s appearance.
 Help: Contains the Help Center.
Using the spreadsheet macros
WSE spreadsheets can contain macros (mini bits of code that automate a par-
ticular sequence of commands or spreadsheet operations), and WSE includes
a series of logical statements and operators to help build them. A macro is a
mini computer program (that looks a lot like regular old JavaScript). Macros
are incredibly helpful in spreadsheets because you can set them up to tabu-
late a series of numbers automatically, for example.
The Macro Editor is available from the Edit menu.
Introducing the Rich Text Editor
WSE’s Rich Text Editor is used to create documents, as you can see in 
Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5:
WSE’s built-
in document
editors are

188
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Using the Rich Text Editor’s Edit bar
The Rich Text Editor’s Edit bar contains buttons for formatting and working
with text in a document:
 Save: Saves the document.
 Close: Closes the editor, gives you the option to save your changes, and
returns to the new document in WSE.
 Print: Prints the document.
 Cut: Cuts the selection to Clipboard. (Some browsers may not support
this option.)
 Copy: Copies the selection to Clipboard. (Some browsers may not sup-
port this option.)
 Paste: Pastes the selection to Clipboard. (Some browsers may not sup-
port this option.)
 Undo: Undoes the last thing you did. 
 Redo: Redoes whatever you just undid. (Make up your mind, will you?)

 Insert Table: Inserts a table with rows and columns.
 Insert Line: Inserts a horizontal rule.
 Switch Text Direction: Switches the document’s direction.
 Switch Text Direction to Right: Switches document direction for the
selection from left to right.
 Switch Text Direction to Left: Switches document direction for the
selection from right to left.
189
Chapter 12: Working with Documents

 Spell Check: Checks the document’s spelling.
 Question Mark: Displays the WSE Help window.
 Format: Selects the format of the text, such as Normal, Heading 1,
Heading 2, and so on.
 Bold: Bolds selected text.
 Italic: Italicizes text.
 Underline: Underlines text.
 Align left: Aligns the selected text to the left.
 Center: Centers the selected text.
 Align Right: Right-aligns the selected text.
 Numbered List: Puts a selection in a numbered list.
 Bulleted List: Puts a selection in a bulleted list.
 Indent: Indents the selection to the right.
 Remove Indent: Removes the indentation of the selection.
 HTML: Shows the HTML source for a document.
Unlike the Spreadsheet Editor, the Rich Text Editor doesn’t have menus. If
you prefer not to use the mouse, press Shift+Control+M to access a special
set of word-processing icons. Press the Tab key to navigate among the icons
and press Enter to select the one you want.
Introducing the Presentation Editor
WSE’s built-in Presentation Editor helps you create simple presentations, álà
PowerPoint. WSE presentations are made up of pages, and the Presentation
Editor has buttons to create, edit, arrange, sort, and display them. There are
two parts to each presentation page: the title area (which usually consists of
words) and the content area (which usually consists of words and images).
190
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

The overall look and feel of a presentation is determined by the presenta-
tion’s master page, which is a lot like a template; it sets the style of all the
pages in the presentation. WSE includes the following master pages:
 Default Master
 Basic Master
 Title Master
 Ruled Master
 Wood Master
 Blocks Master
 Grandma’s Garden
 Chocolate Bananas
 Let’s Watch TV
Working with a presentation
You can view a presentation in one of three ways: Outline, Sorter, and Screen
Show. Figure 12-6 shows a presentation in Outline mode, and as you can see,
WSE provides a tree view of the presentation’s pages, on the left, and a draw
area on the right which you use to edit the selected page.
Click the View toolbar’s buttons in the lower-right corner of the Presentation
Editor to switch between the three view modes. In Outline and Sorter modes,
you can also click the buttons in the Arrow toolbar to navigate between the
pages in the presentation.

Using the Presentation Editor’s buttons
The Presentation Editor’s Edit bar contains buttons for formatting the indi-
vidual pages of your presentation:
 Save: Saves the presentation you are working on.
 Print: Prints your resentation.
 Undo: Takes away your most recent change.
 Redo: Repeats your most recent change.
 Cut: Cuts the selection to a Clipboard.

Chapter 12: Working with Documents
Handling (or not handling) file compatibility issues
The files that you create and share with Office
are different than the files you create and share
with the WSE editors, and in the current version
of WSE you can’t mix and match between Office
and the editors.
In other words, you use Office to edit Office files
and you use the productivity components to edit
productivity component files, but you don’t use
Office to edit non-Office files or use the produc-
tivity components to edit nonproductivity com-
ponent files.
This discussion is about editing, not reading
documents. Anyone with the correct WSE
access rights can read any document, no
matter where or how it was created.

About Editing Documents, After the Fact
Sometimes you can edit a document, and sometimes you can’t. Usually you
can edit your own documents, and, depending on the document library’s
access settings, you may able to edit teammates’ documents, too. However,
sometimes you can’t edit documents at all, not even the documents you cre-
ated yourself.
You can easily tell whether you can edit a document, because when you open
it you either see the Edit button or you don’t.
Here are some reasons you might be prevented from editing a document:
 The document library may not be set up to let you edit any of the docu-
ments, because of the nature of the library itself.
 The document is locked — either someone else on your team is editing
it, or someone manually locked it to prevent further changes.
Assuming you can edit a particular document — because you have the cor-
rect access and the document isn’t locked — the following sections cover a
few of the additional things you can do with the document in addition to edit-
ing its actual content.
Editing a document’s properties
The most important part of a document, of course, is its content. But there’s
more to a document, as far as WSE is concerned.
You can edit the document’s properties — the fields that WSE tracks about
every document — such as the document’s name, description, and so on.
This content about a document is sometimes called metadata. Document
properties can be very important for making sure that other team members
can find the document, especially when they search for it. The more informa-
tion you include in the property fields, the more likely it will be that other
users can access and use the content in the document.
To edit a document’s properties, whether it was created with Office or a WSE
editor, follow these steps:
1. Locate and open the document you want to change and click the Edit
button.
The Edit Document form appears.
2. Use the Edit Document form to change the document’s title, descrip-
tion, or preferred language.
194
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

3. When you’re finished, click the Publish, Submit for Approval, or Save
as Private Draft button, as appropriate.
The document is saved and closed.
Replacing a document
On occasion you may need to replace a document, lock, stock, and barrel.
This isn’t something you do often, but sometimes you have a file on your
local hard drive that you need to upload in place of a document that’s already
in the library. Needless to say, the existing document is, well, replaced —
permanently — so proceed with caution. You can not replace a document
that has been saved as a pending draft.
Use these steps to replace an existing document in a document library with
one from your computer:
1. Locate and open the document you want to replace.
2. Click the Replace button.
The Replace Document form appears.
3. Click the Browse button and select the file on your hard drive that
you want to upload as the replacement.
4. Click the Publish, Submit for Approval, or Save as Private Draft
button, as appropriate.
The new document appears in the document library and the old one
vanishes.
Moving or copying a document
Although the steps for copying and moving a document are almost the same,
the results are, of course, different. When you copy a document, you end up
with two identical versions of the document in two different folders. When
you move a document, the document is taken out of its original folder and
deposited in the folder you specify.
Use these steps to copy or move a document in a document library:
1. Locate and open the document.
2. Choose More Actions➪Copy or More Actions➪Move.
The Copy to Folder (or Move to Folder) form appears.
195
Chapter 12: Working with Documents

3. Select the destination folder where you want to put the copied or
moved document.
4. Click OK.
The document is copied or moved to its new location.
Deleting a document
The steps to delete a document deserve a little special consideration, given
the inherent danger. Think twice about deleting a document, because the docu-
ment is removed from the WSE document library permanently and irrevocably.
Use these steps to remove a document from a document library:
1. Locate and open the document.
2. Choose More Actions➪Delete.
The Are You Sure You Want to Delete This Document dialog box appears.
3. If you are 110 percent certain you will never need the document
again, click the OK button.
Click Cancel to change your mind and leave the document right where it is.
Converting documents
You can’t use Microsoft Office to edit a document, spreadsheet, or presenta-
tion that was created with WSE productivity components, and you can’t use
the productivity components to edit Office documents, either.
WSE does include a built-in conversion mechanism intended to help you con-
vert files back and forth, from whatever format the document is in (Microsoft
Office for example) to WSE format, and vice-versa.
When you convert a document, the converted document replaces the original
document. Therefore, you lose the original document.
WSE’s document conversion process is far from perfect. Before converting a
document, it’s a good idea to make a copy of the file (see “Moving or copying
a document,” earlier in this chapter), and then put the copy through the con-
verter. That way, if you don’t get the results you expected from WSE’s conver-
sion, you still have the original.
Use these steps to convert a document:
196
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

1. Locate and open the document.
2. Choose More Actions➪Convert.
A list of formats to which the document can be converted appears.
3. Select the format into which you want the document to be converted
from the Create New Version As field.
4. Click OK.
WSE converts the document’s internal file format, so that it can be
edited by the other program.
Managing access to a document
In Chapter 11, I show you how to use WSE roles to determine which folders in
a document library are available to which users. You can follow similar steps
to determine which members of a team can view or edit a document.
The most common reason for hiding a document from certain members of
the team is because it’s not finished. WSE handles this scenario for you, by
letting you save documents as private drafts, so if you’ve already saved a
document as a private draft, you don’t need to do anything else. Nobody else
can see the document until you publish it.
Hiding documents isn’t difficult, and can be just the ticket when certain docu-
ments are intended for certain people. That said, you will likely find that man-
aging access to entire folders, rather than individual documents, is easier and
less time consuming.
As I discuss in Chapter 11, WSE documents inherit their access settings from
their parent folder, so rest assured that protecting an entire folder from cer-
tain individuals protects the documents in the folder, too.
Use these steps to change a document’s access:
1. Locate and open the document.
2. Choose More Actions➪Set Access.
The Resource Permission form appears, showing the roles that have
been defined for the document library.
3. To remove access for the people assigned to a certain role, click the
check box next to the role, or click the Edit button in the last column
to view or change the people who are assigned to the role.
4. Click OK.
197
Chapter 12: Working with Documents

Working with versions
WSE has options for working with multiple versions of a document. Much like
WSE’s workflow capabilities, versioning has to be turned on as part of the
document library’s settings, which I explain in Chapter 11.
As you can see in Figure 12-7, versioning is a handy way to keep track of how
a document has changed through a collaborative editing process; the basic
idea is that a given entry in a document library might, in fact, have several
versions. One version is special, called the current version, and it’s the one
and only version that is displayed when a member of the team clicks the doc-
ument’s title in the list view. Other versions of a document are accessible via
a Versions link that appears at the top of WSE document versions.
When you have a version-enabled document library, you can view earlier ver-
sions of a document, save a new version of a document, change which ver-
sion is the current version, and download a version to your computer.
Viewing versions
To work with versions, open the document in question and click the Versions
link at the top of the document.
Figure 12-7:
Working

198
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Creating a new version of a document
To create a new version of a document — essentially making a new copy of
the document — follow these steps:
1. Open the document.
2. Click the Versions link.
The Document Versions list appears.
3. Click the New Version button.
The New Version form appears.
4. Enter a description of the version — what makes this version different
from all the rest — in the Note field.
5. Click OK.
WSE copies the document you selected in Step 1, and creates it as a new
version. If there are multiple versions of a document, they are listed in
descending order so that the most recently created version is always at
the top of the list.
You can tell which version is the current version because it is the one that is
listed as active in the Status column of the Versions list.
Changing which version is the current version
You can select a version and make it the current version — in effect promot-
ing it so that it is the one that team members see when they open the docu-
ment. Follow these steps:
1. Locate and open the document.
2. Click the Versions link.
The Document Versions list appears.
3. Click the version you want to promote.
The selected document version opens.
4. Click the Promote to Current Version button.
5. Click OK.
WSE copies the document you selected in Step 1 and creates it as a new
version. If there are multiple versions of a document, they are listed in
descending order, so that the most recently created version is always at
the top of the list.
199
Chapter 12: Working with Documents

Downloading a version
Download a version if you want to create an extra copy of the document on
your hard drive for your own or backup purposes. Follow these steps:
1. Locate and open the document.
2. Click the Versions link.
The Document Versions list appears.
3. Click the Download button.
4. Select the location where you want to save the document (C:\My
Documents, for example).
5. Click Save.
The document version is saved to your hard drive, and it is still accessi-
ble through WSE. If the version available through WSE is edited, your
copy won’t be changed.
Working with draft documents
There are two kinds of draft documents in WSE, private drafts and pending
drafts. Any document saved as a draft is not yet ready for a wide audience.
Private drafts are documents that you yourself have saved for your own pur-
poses; pending drafts are documents that are in a workflow process and have
been submitted to an approver. In either case, draft documents are not visi-
ble to the entire team.
Working with private drafts
The first, and most common, kind of draft document, is your own. You can
save a document as a private draft if you’re finished editing it for the moment
(maybe it’s lunchtime) but you’re not ready to release the document to the
whole team.
Every WSE document library contains a special folder, called Private Drafts,
in which you store such documents.
Figure 12-8 shows a private draft document from a Private Drafts folder. You
have already noticed, no doubt, that a draft document has a couple of special
buttons at the top:
 Accept: When you click this button, the document is no longer consid-
ered to be a draft document and no longer appears in your Private
Drafts folder. More important, the document assumes its rightful place
among the rest of the documents in the document library, so that the
whole team has access to it. Click the Accept button when your private
draft document is finished and ready to go.
200
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

 Delete Draft: When you click this button, the draft document is gone for-
ever and ever.
 Edit: When you click this button, the document opens so that you can
continue working on it.
As you can see in the figure, a private draft document also has two special
tabs the top of the page: Current Document and Private Draft.
Imagine that you come to work on Monday and write a new press release.
You finish the document late Monday afternoon, and you save and publish it
so everyone can read it. On Wednesday, you decide to revise the press
release. You click the document’s Edit button and start editing away. But
you’re a might bit peckish as noontime rolls around, so you save the docu-
ment as a private draft and head off to the cafeteria.
In this little story, as far as WSE is concerned, there are two versions of the
press release. There’s the version that you finished and published on
Monday, and there’s the version you’ve been working on all morning
Wednesday. That’s what those tabs are about; the Current Document tab is
where you (and the team) can find the published document from Monday.
The Private Draft tab is where you (and you alone, because no one else can
see it) can find your draft after lunch.

Although every document library has a Private Drafts folder, only some have
a Pending Drafts folder.
Some document libraries are set up to use workflow. In such a document
library, every document goes through an approval process before it’s avail-
able to the whole team. This workflow business is either turned on for a given
document library, or it isn’t. See Chapter 11 for details on how to enable
workflow and how to identify who on the team is an approver.
When you work in a document library that has workflow turned on, team
members can’t publish a document when it’s finished. Instead, the author
submits it for approval. Doing so uploads the file, and converts it, too. But
WSE submits the document for approval, by putting it in the Pending Drafts
folder of the person who has been identified as the approver. Only after it’s
approved is the document published for others on the team to see.
Working with a pending draft is much the same as working with a private
draft, with two notable exceptions. A pending draft includes both an Accept
button and a Reject button at the top of the page.
As an approver, you get to decide whether a document is ready to see the
light of day. If you click the Accept button, the document is removed from the
Pending Drafts folder (where only the approver and the author could see it)
and is posted to the document library at large.
If you click the Reject button instead, the document isn’t published at all, but
is instead returned to the author for more work.
Although there can be multiple people who are identified in WSE as
approvers, the first one to approve or deny a submitted draft wins. In other
words, the workflow in WSE isn’t complex or smart enough to manage com-
plex approval chains. It’s a simple first in, first out kind of affair.
Managing a Document Library
If you’re the manager of a team space that contains a document library, you
may very well want to fine-tune the way the document library functions. You
can tweak a few document library settings so that the document library does
exactly what you want it to do. Log in to WSE with administrator rights, open
the document library, and click the portlet’s Configure button to use the con-
figure form, shown in Figure 12-9.
202
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

As you can see in Figure 12-9, the form has eight fields you can use to config-
ure the document library:
 Indicator for New Documents: This field determines whether or not
recently added documents are described as such with that cute little red
New! descriptor. In document libraries with frequent updates, enabling
this option is a cool way to let everyone know which documents have
been changed recently. In document libraries that don’t have frequent
updates, this feature isn’t worth the trouble.
 Conversions: This field determines whether the WSE conversion feature
can be used in the document library. See “Converting documents,” ear-
lier in this chapter.
 Editors: This field disables or enables the document editors. Disabling
them means that the team can’t use WSE’s built-in productivity compo-
nents to create simple documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. By
default this feature is enabled.
 Plug-in: Disabling the use of plug-ins forces people to use the WSE edi-
tors to create and edit documents, and means that people on the team
can’t use external programs (such as Microsoft Office) to create and edit
content. By default, this feature is enabled.
Attention Linux users: An applet is used to communicate with your
client file system, so Linux users must have a supported Java Runtime
Environment installed.

Chapter 12: Working with Documents

 Folder Tree: Disabling the folder tree means that the document library
won’t display that easy-to-navigate folder tree on the left, when a person
opens the document library. It’s a matter of preference, of course, but I
can’t imagine a reason to turn this off.
 Active Content Filtering: This field controls a security option that pre-
vents certain kinds of documents from displaying potentially harmful
content. Turning Active Content Filtering on automatically removes cer-
tain JavaScript, Java, and ActiveX components when a document is
viewed. If the content and documents in your library come from trust-
worthy sources — usually, people on your team — you probably don’t
have to worry about changing this setting. If, on the other hand, your
libraries contain a lot of external content that you get from other places,
you might consider turning this feature on.
 Tools Button: This field allows or prevents people from downloading
and installing the Document Manager desktop components on their
computer. Check out Appendix B for more information about the desk-
top components.
 Default Folder: Use this field on the off chance that you want to change
the root folder of the document library.
You can also click the portlet’s Edit button to use the Edit form. As Figure 12-10
illustrates so effectively, there are five fields that further fine-tune how a doc-
ument library functions.
Figure 12-10:
Editing a

library.
204
Part IV: Sharing and Safeguarding Documents 

Use these fields if you need finer control over how your document library
works:
 Number of Documents Displayed per Page: Although most document
libraries display 15 documents in the list view; you can change this to 
5, 25, or 50 documents.
 Enable Portal Editors for Each Document Type: Pick and choose which
of the WSE productivity components your team can use to create content.
 Number of Days to Show Documents as New: If, and only if, you turned
on the Indicator for New Documents field described in the previous list,
use this field to determine how long WSE considers a document to be
new. Your choices are 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, or 30 days.
 Choose to Display Folder Tree: Disabling the folder tree means that the
document library doesn’t display that easy-to-navigate folder tree on 
the left.
 Tools Button: This field allows or prevents people from downloading
and installing the desktop components.
Click OK when you are finished changing the document library’s configuration.

Making IBM
Workplace

Your Own

In this part . . .
I
n the old days, making a portal suit your own particu-
lar tastes and needs was a daunting affair, because it
meant rolling up your sleeves and delving into the world
of portlets, Cascading Style Sheets, and Java programming.
With the advent of tools like IBM Workplace Services
Express, however, setting up portals got a whole lot easier.
WSE is flexible, so you can customize it as you see fit;
because you can use your web browser to customize the
program, everything is a whole lot easier. WSE takes care of
all the technical lifting, so you can focus on the job at hand,
without becoming a Java programmer in the process.
This part of the book is devoted to making WSE work the
way you want it to. Like the burger joint says: Have it 
your way.

Chapter 13
Working with Forms
In This Chapter
 Working with forms and form templates
 All about WSE fields
 Creating views to summarize and graph information
 Working with portlets
F
orms make IBM Workplace Services Express special. When you drag a
form out of the Portlet Palette and drop it on your team space’s home
page, it’s easy to forget how much work and time you’re saving yourself, and
your team.
First, consider all the technology behind each form, which you get to take for
granted. You (and your team) can use a form to collect information about
how to get to a meeting with a customer without thinking about all the whys
and wherefores of how Java, DHTML, Cascading Style Sheets, and all the
other technical stuff are used to set up the form, control its layout, and make
sure it works for Windows and Linux users.
Second, the forms in WSE are infinitely modifiable; without any in-depth pro-
gramming or Web development know-how, you can add fields to WSE’s forms,
create and edit form views, add charts to a team space or page, and so on.
Traditionally, portals have been impractical for a lot of companies (particu-
larly smaller ones) because portals require so much technological heavy 
lifting. But WSE in general and forms in particular remove that complexity.
Chapter 13 is all about how you modify forms to suit your own particular
needs or preferences.

Putting Forms in Context
You can use forms in WSE without ever changing a thing. You may find that
the forms that come with WSE work just great for your purposes. On the
other hand, you may decide that a tweak here or a change there might make
the forms you use even better suited to your team’s purposes. There are a
couple of reasons you might modify a form, and just like everything in WSE,
your ability to do so is based on your access level.
Here are a couple of really good reasons for changing forms:
 To meet your team’s specific needs. The most common, immediate, 
and practical reason you’d modify a form is to make it suit the needs 
of a particular team or project. Say you added the Customer Contacts
form to your team space’s home page. Maybe your company tracks cus-
tomers by a company number, so you want that number to be tracked
by the Customer Contacts form, as well. Adding a new field to the
Customer Contacts form in your team space is very easy to do.
 To meet your organization’s long-term needs. An admittedly less-
frequent scenario is that you want to edit a form’s template. This scenario
requires a long-range perspective. Say you want to make that aforemen-
tioned Customer Number field something that is always included in the
Customer Contacts form, no matter who in your company uses it. You’re
showing a little foresight by planning ahead so that if someone creates a
new team space tomorrow or next month that happens to use the
Customer Contacts form, he or she doesn’t need to add this field.
Furthermore, the field not only appears in the form always, but always in
the same place.
Foresight is a wonderful thing of course, but sometimes it’s hard to
come by. If you notice that you are making the same modifications to a
given form every time you use it (“Wait, didn’t I do this last month?”),
you should decide to save yourself the trouble next month by making the
change to the template this month.
You can modify a given form in a given team space on a one-time basis to
meet the needs of a particular team. Or, thinking a little more broadly, you
can modify a form’s template, so that any time anyone uses that form, your
modifications are included.
You can also take a form that you have customized and turn it into a tem-
plate. This is an ideal situation if you have made a bunch of modifications to
a form, because you don’t have to make those same changes again to the
template. Also, you still have both the original version of the template and
the customized version to choose from in the future.
210
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Working with Forms
WSE forms are small enough, and easy enough, to change, so you don’t need
to spend a lot of time planning how a form will work. Most people take a let’s-
try-it-and-see-if-we-like-it approach to creating and customizing forms.
That said, each form is used in four different ways, and keeping them in the
back of your head is a good idea as you add fields, design the views, and so
on. I show you how to change the views in the following section, “Modifying 
a form in a team space.”
You view forms in a variety of ways. You use the same portlet to summarize,
read, edit, and graph items.
Figure 13-1 shows a List view, in which WSE summarizes the documents that
have been entered in the form. The list usually consists of documents, orga-
nized in a table; each row contains information about the particular item, and
each column represents a particular field. Depending on the number of fields
the form has, a view may not show all of the fields (there simply may not be
enough room).
211
Chapter 13: Working with Forms
Understanding instances
WSE uses the word instance to distinguish
between one place where you have used a
given form and another place where you have
used a given form. For example, you might have
two instances of the Customer Contacts form in
a team space, on two different pages. Changing
an instance of the form in one part of the team
space doesn’t change it in its other location. If
you subsequently add a new instance of the
Customer Contacts form to a team space, the
new instance will not have the new field, either.
Similarly, if you modify a template, your changes
take effect and appear in the template every
time you use it in the future. However, WSE 2.5
doesn’t support design inheritance between a
form template and the instances of that form
that you’ve previously used in WSE. In other
words, if you add a new field to the Customer
Contacts form template, any existing places
where you have already used the Customer
Contacts form are not affected and don’t
include the new field.

Figure 13-2 shows the same form being used to read an item. Unlike the List
view, when you read an item, all of the fields that are part of the item appear.
Using a form to edit an item is a whole lot like using a form to read an item,
except that when you read an item you can’t change the values in the fields,
and when you edit an item, you can (see Figure 13-3).

Figure 13-4 shows a special view, called a chart. When you choose this view,
WSE summarizes any list of items in either a bar or pie chart.
Modifying a form in a team space
To modify a form in a team space, open the team space and click the Edit
button for the form you want to change. Figure 13-5 shows the dialog box for
editing a form.

213
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

As you can see in the figure, there are three tabs you can use to change the
way a form works:
 Properties: This tab helps you determine the name that is displayed at
the top of the portlet and the icon that is used for the form.
 Fields: Use this tab to manage the fields that are part of the form, the
type of information they each contain, and their placement on the
screen.
 Views: With this tab, you can control the form’s views, including the
columns that view will or will not display. You can also create charts
with this tab.
Modifying a form that is already in use in a team space is a matter of clicking
the Edit button to open the Edit Form dialog box, and using whichever of
these three tabs is appropriate; click the Done button when you are finished
making changes to the form.
Use these three tabs to customize your forms.
Figure 13-5:
Modifying a
form.
214
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

When you edit a form in a team space, your changes affect that instance of the
form, and none other. See the sidebar, earlier in this chapter, “Understanding
instances,” for more information.
Modifying a form template
Use these steps to change a form template so that the changes you make to
the template are available each and every time you use the form:
1. Click the Templates link in the toolbar.
The Application Template Library appears.
2. Click the Navigator’s Form Template Library button.
The Form Template Library appears, listing all of the form templates
that are available.
3. Click the name of the template you want to change.
If the name of the form template you want to edit doesn’t appear as a
link, the form template is locked. You can use the Unlock button on the
right to unlock the form template. If you can’t unlock the form template,
someone else may be modifying it already; consult your teammates to
see who is working on the form, if necessary.
As you can see in Figure 13-6, modifying a form template works much
like modifying a form in a team space, except that the page includes a
Preview Main Page button, a Save and Close button, a Save As button, 
a Cancel button, and a Help button at the top of the screen.
4. Click the Properties, Fields, or Views tab to determine what and how
the form will present it contents.
As you design a form’s fields, layouts, and views, get in the habit of using
the Preview Main Page button to get a look at how your final product will
look.
5. When you are finished changing the form template, click the Save and
Close button.
Your changes apply to any subsequent uses of that form.
Your changes take effect and appear in the template every time you use it in
the future, but WSE 2.5 doesn’t support design inheritance between a form
template and the instances of that form that you’ve previously used in WSE.
See the sidebar, “Understanding instances,” earlier in this chapter, to find
out more.
215
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

Creating a new form template
Rather than starting from scratch, WSE jump-starts a new form by copying
the fields, properties, and views of an existing form template, which you then
modify to suit your needs. (If you’re not sure where to start, see the handy
table in “Finding Out WSE’s Built-in Form Templates,” later in this chapter.
The table contains a description of each form template, including its fields
and views.)
Use these steps to create a brand-new form template:
1. Click the Templates link in the toolbar.
The Application Template Library appears.
2. Click the Navigator’s Form Template Library button.
The Form Template Library is displayed.
3. Click the New button.
The New Form Template form appears.
Figure 13-6:
Modifying 
a form
template.
216
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

4. Enter the name for the new form template in the Form Template Name
field and select the form on which your new form will be based from
the Starting Point drop-down menu.
The form name you enter must be unique.
5. Click OK.
The new form template’s properties are displayed.
6. Use the Properties, Fields, and Views tabs to modify how the form
works, what fields it contains, and how its views function.
7. Click the Navigator’s Save and Close button when you are finished.
As soon as you create your new form template, it is available for use in
any team space or on any WSE page.
You probably want to put your new form template to immediate use in a team
space or on a WSE page. Don’t be surprised, however, if your new form tem-
plate is not listed in the Portlet Palette; you will probably have to use the Add
button at the bottom of the Portlet Palette to get your new form template to
show up.
Setting a form template’s roles
By default, you can assign one of two roles to a form template:
 Template Editors: Users assigned to this role can edit the form template
and change the template’s roles.
 Template User: Users assigned to this role can drag and drop the form
onto a page.
If there are other people in your company or organization that need to modify
the form template, you should add them to the Template Editors role; anyone
who needs to use the form (to add the form to a page, for example) should be
assigned the Template Users role.
By default, no one is assigned to either of these roles when you create a new
form template. That’s why it’s important to modify a template’s roles as soon
as you can so that other people can use it.
Use these steps to assign the roles for a form template:
1. Click the Templates link on the toolbar.
The Application Template Library appears.
217
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

2. Click the Navigator’s Form Template Library button.
The Form Template Library appears.
3. Find the form template whose roles you want to modify and click the
Template Roles button.
4. Use the Template Roles form, shown in Figure 13-7, to manage the
form’s two roles.
5. Use the Role field to select either Template Editors or Template Users,
and then use the Add and Remove buttons to determine who has the
selected role. Click Add.
The Directory Search dialog box appears, listing the names of the people
or groups who will be assigned the selected role.
In the figure, I have assigned the Template Users role to Everyone, which
is the name of a group defined in my WSE directory.
Just because a person or group is designated a Template Editor doesn’t
mean that he or she is a Template User; and Template Users aren’t nec-
essarily Template Editors. You have to assign each role explicitly.
6. Click the Close Template Roles button when you are finished assign-
ing the form template’s roles.
Figure 13-7:

218
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Creating a new form template 
from an existing form
Perhaps you have modified a form in a team space, and the modifications you
made have worked out so great that you want to turn your form into a form
template.
Almost every form has an Actions button, from which you can select the Save
As a New Form Template option. You give the new form template a name, and
you’re in business. The new form template appears, for example, in the Form
Template Library, and is available in the Portlet Palette.
Working with Fields
The most basic element of every WSE form is a field, which is one snippet 
of the item, such as the customer’s last name, the date the contract was
opened, whether or not the invoice has been printed, and so on. WSE fields
may behave a little differently, depending on how you’re using them.
For example, consider the File Attachment field type. If you edit an item that
includes a File Attachment field, you get to use the built-in Browse button to
upload a file from your file system to WSE. If you are instead reading an item,
a File Attachment field displays the name of the attached file, and includes a
built-in link so that you can download it. When you include a File Attachment
field in a view, however, it displays the name of the file that was uploaded.
WSE supports 16 different field types in all (skip ahead a bit to Figure 13-9 if
to see them):
 Plain-Text, Single-Line: One line of words.
 Plain-Text, Multiple-Line: Like a single-line field, but this field has (you
guessed it) more lines. This field type can have between 2 and 99 lines
worth of information.
 Rich-Text, Multiple-Line: Can contain character formatting (bold text,
for example), tables, different font sizes, URLs, and so on.
 On-and-Off Control: More commonly known as a radio button field; dis-
plays a check box with two possible choices, only one of which you can
select. Appropriate for yes/no, is-it or isn’t-it situations.
 Single-Item Selection: Works like an on-and-off control field, but has a
list of possible choices, only one of which you can select.
 Multiple-Item Selection: Works like a single-item selection field, but can
have more than one item selected.
219
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

 Date: Includes a built-in calendar that you can click on to pick a date.
 Time: Stores a time value, and includes a control to make entering a time
easy.
 URL: Holds URLs that can be clicked to open the Web page in question.
 Name: Holds the name of a person from your organization’s directory.
Also includes a built-in dialog box to look people up.
 File Attachment: When you view this field, it automatically helps you
download the attached file. When you edit this field, it includes a Browse
button that uploads a file from your hard drive to the WSE system.
 Item Author: A calculated field that automatically displays the name of
the person who created the item in question.
 Creation Date: A calculated field that records the time and date that the
item was created.
 Modification Date: A calculated field that displays the last time the item
was edited.
 Rich Text: Not a field, per se, but a way to enter static information that
appears on the form, such as special form instructions, section titles,
and the like.
 Section Header: Similar to rich text, but doesn’t have any rich text for-
matting options.
Adding and managing fields
You can (assuming you have the appropriate access) add a new field to an
instance of a form or to a form template. The steps for each are slightly 
different.
Working with the fields on a form
Use these steps to add, edit, reorder, or remove a field from a form:
1. Open the page in the team space that contains the form you want to
change.
2. Choose Actions➪Customize.
The form’s properties screen is displayed.
3. Click the Fields tab.
4. Create and manage the order of the fields on the form.
See “Managing fields,” later in this chapter.
5. Click Done when you’re finished.
220
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Adding a field to a form template
Use these steps to add, edit, reorder, or remove fields on a form template:
1. Click the Templates link in the toolbar.
The Application Template Library is displayed.
2. Click the Navigator’s Form Template Library button.
The Form Template Library is displayed.
3. Click the name of the template you want to change.
4. Click the Fields tab.
5. Use the steps described in the following sections to create and manage
the order of the fields on the form.
6. Click the Done button when you are finished.

Figure 13-8 shows the Field Summary list, which is used to create and manage
the fields on a form or form template.
Figure 13-8:
Managing
the fields
on a form
or form
template.
221
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

As the figure illustrates, the fields on a form are laid out in up to three
columns; the fields in each column determine how the form displays its con-
tents when you use the form to read or edit a document. Here are some tips
for managing fields:
 Use the up, down, left, and right arrows to control where a particular
field will be displayed; you can reorder the fields in a particular column,
or move them from one column to another.
 Use the Trashcan icon to remove the field altogether; or click the field’s
name to change its properties and type.
 Because this page looks so dissimilar to the version of the form you’ll
actually use, click the Preview button early and often to see how the
form will look when it is being used to read or edit an item.
 Select the field by which a matching item will be listed when someone
searches WSE with the Field list.
 Click Done when you’re finished changing the fields around.
Adding a new field
Defining a new field is a pretty painless process that involves choosing the
field’s type, entering the field’s properties, and determining where the field
will appear on the form.
Figure 13-9 shows the New Field form, which appears when you click the New
Field button.
Follow these steps after you click the New Field button:
1. Select the type of information that you want the field to hold.
2. Click Next.
3. Use the form to define the properties for the field.
See Figure 13-10. Which properties, exactly, you set are determined by
the field type you chose in Step 3. For example, the Rich Text field has a
width and a height setting that a Date field does not.
4. You can (but do not need to) change the default name that WSE 
supplies.
Every field has a unique field name, which is required, that is automati-
cally generated by WSE. This is the name by which the field will be
known internally by WSE.

223
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

5. Add a descriptive label.
Every field includes an optional label, which is what WSE uses on the
form, as the field’s column heading in views, and so on. Because there
are rules for field names (spaces aren’t allowed, for example), it’s a good
idea to use a more descriptive and easier-to-read label for every field
you define.
6. Add default values if necessary.
Many fields include a default value, in which you can enter a word,
phrase, date, or whatever. The value is entered in the field, automati-
cally, whenever someone creates a new document.
7. Click the This Field Is Required to Have a Value check box if you want
to make a field mandatory.
8. If you have nothing else you want to do, see the section, “Previewing
and completing the process of adding and modifying a new field,”
later in this chapter, to wrap up the process.
If you have additional changes you want to make to your new field, read
the following section, “Modifying a field you’ve added.”
Modifying a field you’ve added
You can make other changes to a field you have added to a form. For exam-
ple, six of the field types have additional attributes:
 Plain-Text, Single-Line fields require you to enter a size and a maximum
length of between 1 and 99 characters. The Size attribute determines
how big the field will be when displayed on the form; the Maximum
Length attribute prevents anyone from entering a value longer than the
length you specify.
 Plain-Text, Multiple-Line fields ask you to specify the columns and rows
for the field, all the better to determine the number of characters
(width) and height of the field’s contents.
 Rich-Text, Multiple-Line fields include settings for the field’s width and
height, which you enter in pixels. The default value is 300 pixels wide
and 150 pixels tall.
 On-and-Off Control fields allow you to determine whether the field is
checked or unchecked, by default.
 Single-Item fields present a list of choices; you must enter the list of pos-
sible values in the choices box, and (optionally) choose one to be the
default by entering it in the next field. This field type also asks you to
224
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

choose a user interface for the field. For example, do you want the field
to list possible values as radio buttons, in a list box, or in drop-down
menu? Answer this question with your choice here.
Screen real estate is often at a premium, so the list box option is often
the best choice for a Single-Item Selection field, since it’s the smallest.
 Multiple-Item fields are similar to the list of possible choices and default
values you see when you use a Single-Item field; however a Multiple-Item
field’s user interface setting allows you to either display the field as
check boxes or as a list box.
Previewing and completing the
process of adding a new field
To complete the process of adding a new field, follow these steps:
1. Click the Done button when you are finished changing the fields.
WSE automatically puts the new field at the bottom of the first column,
which means the field appears in the lower-left corner of the form when
you use it to read, add, or edit a document.
2. Click the arrow buttons next to the field’s name if you want to make
the new field appear higher in the column, or if you want to move it to
another column altogether.
225
Chapter 13: Working with Forms
Knowing about other special fields
The Item Author, Creation Date, and Modification
Date fields are special because they are calcu-
lated automatically by WSE and aren’t editable.
Putting one of these three fields on a form still
requires you to name the field and give it a label,
however.
The Design fields types — Rich Text and
Section Header — are also special. These fields
aren’t editable either, and are used to help
organize your form. For example, if you want a
big bold heading on your form, you could create
a Rich Text field on the form for the heading.
Similarly, a section header can be used to divide
a form into logical sections, to improve the orga-
nization and readability of a form that has a lot
of fields. Rich Text and Section Header fields
are, in effect, static; their contents cannot be
changed, and their contents do not change from
one item to the next.

3. Optionally, click the Preview button to see how the form looks when
it is used to read or edit an item.
4. Click the Done button when you are finished adding new fields.
A form is used to summarize, display, and edit information, and usually
doesn’t have the luxury of being the only form or portlet on the page.
Most pages have several other forms and portlets surrounding your
little beauty. In particular, Rich Text fields can get you in trouble,
because they are big. Aesthetically speaking, try to keep your forms
small, and the number of fields in them low.
Working with Views
Every form (and form template) has at least one view. Views allow you to
summarize and organize a form’s documents in a simple, easy-to-read format.
Most views are essentially tables, containing rows and columns of informa-
tion. Views usually display some, but not all, of the fields in a given form, and
have built-in tools for sorting the items.
A special kind of view is called a chart, which you can use to provide a simple
pie chart or bar chart summary of documents.
Views display all of the documents in a given form. If you want to see only
certain documents, use WSE filters (which I discuss in Chapter 7) to limit
which documents are shown in a particular view.
Figure 13-11 shows WSE’s Customer Contacts form, which comes with a view
called All Items. This particular view lists all the documents that have been
entered in the Customer Contacts form, and summarizes them to list the con-
tact’s last name, first name, work e-mail address, and work phone number.
Figure 13-11:
Views are

a form’s
documents.
226
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

You can modify the views that come with WSE, or you can create your own. If,
for example, you added a new Customer Number field to the Customer
Contacts form, you’d likely want to modify the All Items view to include that
new field.
Or maybe you need a new view for the Customer Contacts form because your
team needs to list each contact’s e-mail addresses, as shown in Figure 13-12.
You can either add a new view (or customize an existing one) to a form, or
permanently change a form’s template.
Although most views are shared — available to a wide audience — there may
be times when a private view is useful, too. Private views are available only to
you; no one else will even know that your private view exists. Private views
cannot be added to a form template.
Creating a new view
You can add a new view to a form or to a form template. The most common
reason to create a new view is to add some fields that the other views do not
display.
To add a new view to a form, open the page that contains the form you want
to change, and choose Actions➪Customize. To add a new view to a form tem-
plate, open the form template on the Form Template Library. Then follow
these steps:
1. Click the New button.
The View Properties form appears.
Figure 13-12:
Create 
your own
views to
summarize
documents
any which
way you
want.
227
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

2. Name the new view and determine the display options.
For example, the new view may be shared or private, or appear as a
table or as a chart. You can’t have two views in the same form with the
same name.
After you create and save a new view, you can’t change its properties.
You can’t change a view’s name, make a shared view private, or switch a
table view to a chart view. You can only delete it.
3. Click Next.
4. Select the columns that the new view will display, and the order in
which the columns will be displayed.
By default, a new view includes all the columns that have been defined
for the form, which is usually too many.
Figure 13-13 shows the View Definition screen. As you can see, WSE dis-
plays each column that the view will display.
5. Use the arrow buttons to reorder the columns, and use the – button to
remove a column from the view altogether.
If you remove a column and then change your mind, you can select it
from the list and use the Add Column button to put it back.
Click the column heading to change the way the column is described in
the view. For example, in Figure 13-13, the first column will display the
contents of the Display Name field; however, I changed the column head-
ing to say Name, just because I thought that was a little more user friendly.
6. Click Finish when you’re done selecting the new view’s columns.
7. Click Done to return to the form.
When you finish adding a new view to a form, it is automatically added
to the form’s Show list, as you can see in Figure 13-14.
Modifying a view
You can modify a view to change the columns it displays, change their order,
or change the order in which the views are listed in the form’s Show list.
Use these steps to modify an existing view:
1. Open the page that contains the form you want to change.
2. Choose Actions➪Customize.
To change a view in a form template, open the form template in the Form
Template Library.
228
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

3. Click the Views tab.
4. To delete the view altogether, click the Trashcan icon next to the view
you want to remove.
5. To change the order in which the form lists the views, click the up or
down button next to the views to rearrange them.
Figure 13-14:

229
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

6. To change the columns the view displays, click the name of the view,
and then follow the steps in the previous section, “Creating a new view.”
7. When you are finished changing the view, click the Save and Close
button (if you’re modifying a template’s view), or click the Done button
(if you’re modifying a form’s view).
Working with Chart views
Charts are just a fancy kind of view that you can use to graphically summa-
rize a collection of documents in a form. For example, Figure 13-15 shows a
pie chart representation of the cars owned by a bunch of people.
When displaying a Chart view, you can see details about a given bar or slice
by hovering the mouse cursor over it.
Creating a Chart view is easy; you just select Chart as the view type in the
View properties form.
Figure 13-16 shows the view properties form for a Chart view; as you can see
in the figure, all you have to do is select the field on which the chart will be
based and click either the Bar Chart or Pie Chart radio button to select the
type of chart.
Figure 13-15:
Chart views

a form’s
contents in
either a bar
or pie chart.
230
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

WSE charts are easy to create, and of course they’re dynamic; every time 
you choose a WSE Chart view from a form’s Show menu, the chart is updated
automatically. If someone on the team has added new documents to the form
since the last time you viewed that chart, the chart is updated to reflect the
new documents the next time you view it.
That said, WSE charts are pretty simple; there aren’t any formatting options,
and you can only plot one bar per series in a bar chart.
Using WSE’s Built-in Form Templates
Table 13-1 lists the form templates that are included with WSE. The first
column is the name of the form template; the second column describes it;
and columns three and four list the fields that the form includes, and the 
template’s views, respectively.
Use this table as a handy-dandy reference if you are considering which form
to add to a team space, if you need to modify the fields that a form uses, or if
you’re going to create a new form template of your own and are wondering
which of the built-in forms you should use as a starting point.

Working with Other Kinds of Portlets
WSE’s built-in form templates are, in fact, portlets. Because they’re built in
and so easy to use, they’re the portlets you’ll use more often than any other.
You may have occasion to use other kinds of portlets, however. WSE includes
some sample portlets, of course, like the My Weather portlet that’s probably
right in the middle of your home page. But if you know how to build your
own, or if you download portlets from the IBM Workplace Solutions catalog,
you can use the portlets to your heart’s content.
It’s hard to offer much guidance on how to use a particular portlet, because
the workings of any given portlet are up to the person who creates it. If you
download one of the thousand or so portlets that are available from the IBM
Workplace Solutions catalog, for example, it will probably come with its own
instructions.
However, there are two things you need to do to be able to use a portlet in
WSE. You must know how to install a portlet, and you must make sure it
shows up in the Portlet Palette.
Adding a new portlet to WSE
Use these steps to add a portlet to WSE:
1. Click the Administration link in the toolbar.
2. Click Portlets in the Navigation bar.
The Portlet Management page is displayed.
3. Click Install.
The Install Portlets form is displayed.
4. Enter the filename and path for the new portlet, or use the Browse
button to locate the portlet file on your hard drive.
5. Click the Next button, and then click the Install button.
WSE tells you whether the new portlet has been successfully installed.
You have to install a portlet to be able to use it in WSE.
234
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Adding portlets to the Portlet Palette
That oh-so-cool Portlet Palette that you use to drag and drop portlets doesn’t
necessarily list all of the portlets that are available. Particularly if you have
installed a new portlet as described in the previous section, you need to
follow an extra step or two before you can drag and drop the portlet onto 
a page.
Use these steps whenever you need to add a portlet to what’s listed in the
Portlet Palette:
1. Open the Portlet Palette.
The Portlet Palette slides out.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the list and click the Add link.
3. If you know the portlet’s title, enter it in the Search For field.
Alternatively, click the plus sign next to the Search On field, and then
select Title Contains, Description Contains, Keyword Contains, Last
Modified, or Unique Name. Enter the appropriate search term in the
Search For field.
Choose All Available to see every single portlet WSE has installed.
4. Click the Search button.
WSE displays all of the portlets that are installed and match what you
entered in the Search For field.
5. Click the selection box next to the portlet you want to add to the
Portlet Palette and click OK.
The Portlet Palette now includes your portlet in the list, for your drag-
ging and dropping pleasure.
Removing portlets from the Portlet Palette
Over time, your Portlet Palette list can become cluttered with portlets you
don’t use that often. Use the following (somewhat awkward) steps to remove
a portlet from the Portlet Palette:
1. Open the Portlet Palette.
The Portlet Palette slides out.
2. Click the Edit icon at the top of the Portlet Palette’s list (it looks like a
pencil).
235
Chapter 13: Working with Forms

3. Click the Portlets Category link.
The list of the portlets that your Portlet Palette is using is displayed.
4. Select the portlets you want to remove from the list by clicking the
selection box next to them.
5. Click the Remove button and then click OK.
WSE shows the Portlet Palette, which no longer contains the portlet(s)
you removed.
Removing a portlet form the Portlet Palette isn’t really deleting it or unin-
stalling it; you’re just removing it from what you see when the Portlet Palette
comes a slidin’ out.
Adding categories from the Portlet Palette
In the interest of leaving no stone uncovered, consider the scenario where
you have tons and tons of portlets. Can you imagine how cumbersome the
Portlet Palette would be in such circumstances, and how much time you’d
waste scrolling through that long list of portlets?
Fortunately, when presented with such unlikely circumstances, you can cate-
gorize the portlets that are listed in the Portlet Palette. Doing so has two
effects:
 The Portlet Palette is slightly easier to use.
 You will look like a complete WSE hotshot the next time you need to
show off to your friends.
Use the following steps to add a portlet from the Portlet Palette:
1. Open the Portlet Palette.
The Portlet Palette slides out.
2. Click the Edit icon at the top of the Portlet Palette’s list.
3. Click the New button.
4. Enter the New category in the Category Name field.
5. Click the Add button.
6. Use the Search button to find the portlets that you want to be in your
new category.
236
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

7. Click the Selection box next to the name of each portlet you want to
put in the new category.
8. Enter the name of the new category of portlets in the Category Name
field.
9. Click the Done button two times.
WSE shows the Portlet Palette, which now contains the new portlet 
category.
Figure 13-17 shows a Portlet Palette with two categories, and also proves that
the author of this book is, in fact, a complete WSE hotshot.

t’s easy to create a new team space, because you never have to start from
scratch. With IBM Workplace Services Express team space templates, you
can jump-start a new team space or project by loading the new team space
up with the pages, portlets, and roles that you need.
Chapter 14 tells you how to create a new team space, modify an existing one,
manage who can (and can’t) use the team space and its tools, and how to
make your own team space templates.
Getting Your New Team Space Started
In the big picture, there are three steps to bringing a new team space to life:
1. Choose a template and create the team space.
A brand-new team space is just a few clicks away, but you have to
choose a template first.
2. Add members.
Just about the first thing you do after establishing the new team space is
invite people to start using it.

3. Customize it.
WSE’s team space templates aren’t mind readers, so chances are that
your new team space isn’t 100 percent exactly what you and your team
need, even though it will be pretty close. You’ll probably want to add
some pages of your own, rearrange or select different portlets, and so on.
Depending on how much customization your team space needs, you may want
to complete your team space’s customizations before declaring the team space
open for business. So go ahead and swap Step 3 for Step 2 if you want to.
Knowing your template options
Making a new team space is easy; the only part you really have to think about
is the template on which the team space will be based. WSE includes about a
dozen templates to choose from, not including any templates you create on
your own (see “Creating a new template,” later in this chapter).
Templates are the genesis of every team space, and are like a tear sheet for
your new team space; the basic premise is that rather than starting a new
team space from scratch, it’s easier to start with a team space that already
has pages, forms, portlets, and roles built in.
Here’s a list of the team space templates you can use (in addition to any you
might have created yourself). These are the templates that are included 
with WSE:
 Employee Human Resources Site: Designed to help you share human
resources information with an entire organization. Its home page
includes Announcements, FAQs, and Links, and a Human Resources Site
that also includes a document library and members page.
 Customer Support Team: Useful for any group that supports another. Its
home page uses the following portlets: Announcements, Issues, Members,
Links, and FAQs. This template also provides a Schedule page that uses
the Team Calendar and Vacations portlets. Customer support team spaces
also include pages for a document library, chat room, discussion, and
search pages.
 Chat Room: A place for the team to have live chats (we discuss using
chat rooms in Chapter 9). The Chat Room template includes tools for
archiving your team’s pearls of wisdom.
 Discussion: Threaded discussion forums for teams, as discussed in
Chapter 10.
 Sales Team: Useful for a team of sellers. Its home page uses the
Announcements and Members portlets. This template provides a
Schedule page with the Team Calendar, Team Tasks, Milestones, and
Vacations portlets. Its Sales page uses the Customer Contacts,
240
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Prospects, and Sales Tracking portlets, and this template also includes a
document library, discussion forum, and search page.
 Human Resources Team: A simple template with just two pages. It
includes a page for a chat room and a page for the team space’s mem-
bers list.
 Event Planning: Helps you plan an event, such as a team meeting, party,
customer visit, executive briefing, and so on. Its home page uses the
Team Tasks, Directions, Sign up Sheet, and Invitations portlets. The tem-
plate also provides a discussion page, chat room, search page, and a
page for managing members.
 Marketing Team: A lot like the Sales Team template, except that it does
not include a Sales page. The Marketing Team template provides a home
page with the Announcements, Members, and Links portlets. Its
Schedule page uses the Team Calendar, Team Tasks, Milestones, and
Vacations portlets. The template also includes a document library, dis-
cussion forum, and search page.
 Meeting Materials: Designed to help you run an individual meeting. Its
home page uses the Agenda, Minutes, Team Tasks, and Attendance
portlets. It also includes a chat room, document library, a members
page, and search pages.
The Meeting Materials template is found in the Applications (not Team
Spaces) page.
 Team Project: Useful for running simple projects. The template provides
a home page that uses the Announcements and Members lists. It also
provides a Team Calendar page with the Team Calendar and Team Tasks
portlets, and a document library, chat room, discussion forum, and
search page.
 Team Project, Extended: Useful for managing and running larger or
more complex projects than the “plain” team project template. Its home
page includes the Announcements and Members portlets. Its Team
Calendar page uses the Team Calendar, Team Tasks, Milestones, and
Vacations portlets. The template also provides a document library, dis-
cussion area, chat room, and search page.
Building a team space from a template
Use the following steps to create a new team space:
1. Click the Navigator’s Team Spaces button.
The Team Spaces Catalog is displayed.
2. Click the New button.
The New Team Space form appears, as shown in Figure 14-1.
241
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

3. Enter the name for the new team space in the Name field.
Team space names can’t include a back slash (\), asterisk (*), question
mark (?), angle brackets (<>), or vertical bar (|).
4. Select the template on which the new team space will be based from
the Template list.
5. Enter a description in the Description field.
Although it’s optional, including at least a few words about what the new
team space is intended to do is a good idea. What you type in the
Description field appears at the top of the new team space’s home page,
so the description should be short, sweet, and professional.
6. Click the OK button.
The Set Component Properties form appears.
The fields that appear on the Set Component Properties form vary
depending on the template you choose in Step 4. Most templates ask
you whether you want to use New Member Notification tools. The Set
Component Properties form may also include questions about how
many team tasks should be listed at a time.
7. Click OK to create the team space.
WSE creates the new team space (it might take a minute or so for this
step to finish), adds the new team space to the team space catalog, and
tells you when it’s finished, as you can see in Figure 14-2.

Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates
Who’s the boss?
Running a team space is easy; in fact, you may
find that you don’t have to do that much.
Most of your activity occurs when the team
space is new, or at least new to you. When
you’re the new manager of a particular team
space — either because you just created it, or
because you inherited it from someone else —
you’ll find yourself spending the most time
involved with its day-to-day care and feeding.
For example, if you use the steps in the section
“Building a team space from a template,” ear-
lier in this chapter, to create a new team space,
you probably have some ideas about how to
customize the team space to meet your pro-
ject’s needs; perhaps you need slightly different
forms than the template provided, or you 
may even want new pages to organize the team
and its deliverables. When you create a new
team space, you also need to think about its
membership and decide who can access the
team space and use its pages and tools. In
some team spaces, you may even want to divvy
up access so that some people have access to
this part of the team space and other people on
the team have access to that part of the team
space. In other words, when you create a new
team space, you may need to spend some time
thinking through and implementing roles and
access levels.
But after a while, the design and access deci-
sions you have to make (and the time you have
to spend implementing them) tend to diminish.
When you’re past the setting up stage, the most
common thing you do as a team space manager
is deal with membership. As people leave the
team and project, or join it, it’s your job as the
team space manager to give or deny people
access to various areas, documents, and tools.

Adding and managing members
Every team space has a Members portlet that’s used to manage the list of
people who can (or can’t) use the team space. A Members list appears on
each team space, as well. Where you find the Members portlet depends on
the team space and/or the template that was used to create the team space.
Very often the Members portlet is front and center, on the team space’s home
page, but some team spaces have a special page just for the Members portlet.
When you create a new team space, as you can see in Figure 14-3, the
Members list and Members portlet are pretty small. When you create a
brand-new team space, you’re the only person listed.
When you peek behind the curtain of any team space, you find that every
part of the team space has a role assigned to it. Roles determine who has
access to various parts of the team space. In Figure 14-3, for example, there
are two roles: Moderators and Contributors. (I introduce the Moderator and
Contributor roles in Chapter 4.)
Every area in WSE (including forms, portlets, pages, document libraries, and
more) has a role associated with it. The roles tell individuals, “You can only
see and use this part of WSE if you have that role.”
Figure 14-3:

244
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Consider the typical Sales Team template. It has at least 16 distinct compo-
nents. The team space has six pages and a dozen or so portlets scattered
around. In each of those 16 components, you can customize the roles to slice
and dice exactly which members of the team have access to any one of those
16 components.
For example, the Sales Team template comes with the two roles (Moderators
and Contributors) shown in Figure 14-3. The template comes ready-made to
include the Contributors role on each of the 16 components.
What does that mean to you? It means you don’t have to go around defining
and assigning roles for every last page, portlet, and form in a new team
space. The roles are predefined, so in the vast majority of team spaces, your
only job is to determine which members are associated with the preset roles.
Understanding role rules
Roles are WSE’s way of fine-tuning who has access (and what kind of access)
to a team space.
Many team spaces, like the one shown in Figure 14-3, have just two roles:
 Contributors can contribute to the team space by adding and editing doc-
uments to any of the portlets on any of the pages.
 Moderators can contribute to the team space, edit the team space (add a
new page, for example), and manage the Members list.
A person’s role varies from one team space to another, and the rights
associated with a role might be different, too. For example, two different
team spaces might define the specific rights associated with the
Moderators role differently.
Understanding the benefits of customized roles
You can define your own roles in a team space. You might create a role to
limit access to a certain part of a team space, for example, or to distinguish
between who can read documents and who can edit them.
Creating a customized role requires you to follow two basic steps:
1. Create the new role.
This step may involve associating the role with a specific page of the
team space.
2. Define which of the team space’s members are given the new role.
245
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

For example, say you create a 2006 Sales team space, based on the Sales
Team template. The team space is a team hub for 101 people — 90 sales
people, and 11 sales managers.
The team space has six pages that it inherited from the template: a home
page, plus the Schedule, Sales, Documents, Discussion, and Search pages. Of
course, you can add more pages. For the sake of this example, say you add a
seventh page called Commission Statements. (I show you how to add a page in
“Creating a new page,” later in this chapter.) This page is intended to be the
part of the team space that those 11 sales managers use to determine who is
getting paid what. For the sake of the argument, you want to make the
Commission Statements page available to just the 11 sales managers.
In this example, the 2006 Sales team space needs four roles:
 Moderator: Someone, probably you, has to manage the team space’s
components and members.
 Contributor: This is the rank-and-file role for the 90 sales people who
will have access to the first six pages of the team space.
 Sales Manager: This is the custom role you have to create, assign mem-
bers to, and associate with the Commission Statements page.
 Everyone else: Although you don’t define this role explicitly, most team
space membership is limited to a certain group of people. Anyone who
has not been assigned the role of moderator, contributor, or sales man-
ager can’t access the team space at all.
It’s good to understand how roles work, but don’t get put off. In many team
spaces, the two or three roles that come from the team space’s template are
sufficient. In those cases, you don’t have to create any roles at all; you just
have to manage who has which role.
Defining roles in a team space
Use the following steps to create and manage roles in a team space:
1. Open the team space in question.
2. Choose Actions➪Edit.
The team space’s Properties page appears.
3. Click the Roles button, which appears on the left side of the screen.
The roles that are already defined in the team space are listed on the
Roles page.
246
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

4. To modify what rights are associated with a particular role, click the
name of the role in the Roles list; or to create a new role altogether,
click the New button.
The Role properties page is displayed.
Figure 14-4 shows a sample role being defined; needless to say, the exact
contents of WSE roles are determined by the contents (pages and
portlets) of the team space in question.
5. Click the OK button and then click Done when you are finished creat-
ing or editing a role.
Keep reading this section for more information about the options you
can set.
When you create a new role, you can have it inherit settings from an existing
role, or you can define the role’s settings from scratch.
Figure 14-4:
Defining 
a team
space’s role.
247
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

As you can see in the figure, each role has a name, which appears in the team
space’s Members portlet. Make a note of the two check boxes at the top of
Figure 14-4:
 Members of This Role Can Edit the Application: Clicking this check box
means that members of this role can edit the page or pages in the team
space for which this role has been set up.
 Members of This Role Can Manage Members: Clicking this check box
means that members of this role can add and delete members for the
page or pages in the team space for which this role has been set up.
If the role is set up for just one page of the team space, individuals given
editorial and management rights can only make changes to the page in
question. Clicking both check boxes essentially grants all members of
the role the Moderator rights that you, as manager of the team space,
have — at least for the page in question.
The most important part of the Roles form is in the middle, where WSE dis-
plays each page and portlet in the team space, along with a drop-down list
that you use to select what level of access, if any, the role will have. For exam-
ple, for a document library, you can define a certain role as Reader (these
members can read documents, but nothing more), Editor (these members
can read, create, edit, and delete their own documents), or Manager (these
members can manage the document library, editing and deleting any of its
contents).
If you want to hide an element or page of the team space from members of a
role, select the item (like the Commission Statements page) and select the No
Access option from the drop-down menu.
Using the Members portlet
Use the Members portlet to determine who has access to a given team space,
and what role individuals have. Although every team space has a Members
portlet, you need the Moderator role in order to use it.
When you create a new team space, you are automatically set up as the team
space owner, and automatically assigned the Moderator role, so you can
manage its members.
Figure 14-5 shows an example Members portlet; as you can see, the portlet
shows the names of the roles that have been defined in the team space. Click
the plus (+) and minus (–) signs next to a role’s name to see its members.
Use the Members portlet’s Show drop-down list to change which members
are displayed; you can select All Members and Groups, All Members, or
Online Members Only.
248
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

If you have Moderator access to a team space, you can use the Actions
button in the Members portlet to manage the team space’s members. The
Actions button has five options:
 Add Members: Use this option to give people access to the team space.
 Manage Members: Change the role assigned to a particular person or
group of people, or revoke access altogether.
 Change Owner: If you’re the owner, you can make someone else the owner.
 Cancel My Membership: Any member of a team space (except its
owner) can voluntarily resign from a team space.
 Give All Members Access as Contributors: Choose this option to let
anyone who has a username and password for your WSE server access
the team space.
Using the Members portlet to add members to a team space
Use the following steps to make a person (or group of people) a member of a
team space:
1. Open the page in the team space that has the Members portlet.
When in doubt, look on the team space’s home page.
2. In the Members portlet, choose Actions➪Add Members.
The Directory Search: Find People dialog box is displayed.
3. Enter the name of the person or group in the Search For field and
click the Search button.
You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard in the Search For field.
The list of matching people and group names is displayed in the Search
results list.
Figure 14-5:
An example

249
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

4. Select the person, people, or groups to whom you want to grant
access; click Add.
The names you selected are displayed in the Selected Names list.
5. Click OK.
WSE tells you that the people you have selected have been added to the
Members list. These people can now use the team space, will see the
team space listed when they visit the Team Spaces Catalog, can search
the team space’s contents, and so on.
When you add a person or group to a team space’s Members list, the person
is assigned to whichever is the last role in your Members list. Use the steps
outlined in the next section, “Using the Members portlet to manage mem-
bers,” to change the role.
Using the Members portlet to manage members
When you choose Actions➪Manage Members, WSE displays the Manage
Members page, as shown in Figure 14-6.
Click here to assign group roles.
Figure 14-6:
Use the
Manage
Members
page to

250
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Use the following steps to change a person’s role:
1. Click the name of the role that contains the member whose role you
want to change.
The list of the role’s members is displayed.
2. Select the person whose role you want to change by clicking the selec-
tion box next to their name.
You can select more than one person.
3. To revoke access for those you’ve selected, click the Remove button.
4. To change the role the person has, click the Reassign button. Select
the person’s new role from the Reassign Members To drop-down list.
As you can see in Figure 14-6, the Members page has tabs for setting
member access and group access. Because a group’s members are
defined in your organization’s directory, using groups is often preferable,
especially if the team space has a lot of members. The steps for adding
groups to a team space’s Members list are the same as those for adding
individuals, except that you click the Group Access tab.
5. Click the Close Manage Members link when you are finished reassign-
ing roles.
Customizing a Team Space
As the moderator of a team space, you can change the team space — for
example, you might need to change the team space’s name, or (more likely)
add new pages and customize existing pages.
Editing team space properties
When you choose Actions➪Edit, the team space Properties page is displayed.
Figure 14-7 shows the Edit Application Properties Of form. You can change
the following:
 Application Name: Enter the new name in the Application Name field to
change the name of the team space; what you enter in this field deter-
mines how the team space is identified in the Team Spaces Catalog, and
what is displayed at the top of the team space’s home page.
251
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

 Category: If you make changes to the Category field, the team space is
no longer listed in the Team Spaces Catalog, and instead appears among
either your document libraries or applications.
 Description: Change what’s in the Description field. This text is also dis-
played at the top of the team space’s home page.
 Theme: This drop-down list enables you to change the look and layout
of the team space. In the unlikely (and rather unadvisable) event that
you want a team space to look different than the rest of WSE, select a dif-
ferent theme from the drop-down list.
Click the OK button when you are finished editing a team space’s properties.
Editing a team space’s component settings
Some team spaces include optional components that extend the team space’s
operation. Click the Component tab on the team space Properties page.
Figure 14-7:
Changing 
a team

properties.
252
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Figure 14-8 shows a sample Components form; the configurable settings that
appear on the Components form vary from one team space to the next. The
team space shown in the figure uses the Team Tasks portlet, for example, so
clicking the Edit button enables you to change how many tasks are displayed
at a time, and in which order.
Managing a team space’s 
pages and layout
A common reason to edit a team space’s properties is to work with its pages.
For example, you might want to add a new page, or change the portlets that
are on an existing page. You can even delete a page (and all its contents)
completely.
When you choose Actions➪Edit, the team space Properties page is displayed;
click Pages and Layout to work with the Pages and Layout form, as shown in
Figure 14-9.
Figure 14-8:
Changing 
a team
space’s
component
properties.
253
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

As you can see in the figure, the Pages and Layout form shows all the pages
that make up the team space. Use the up and down arrow buttons (shown on
the right side of Figure 14-9) to change the order in which the pages are pre-
sented, and use the Delete button (cautiously) to delete a page altogether.
If you want to make a page temporarily inaccessible, use the Status column to
indicate whether it is active or inactive. Inactive pages are saved as part of a
team space’s design, but are not accessible or usable by anyone on the team.
Click the link in the Status column to toggle the page’s status between Active
and Inactive.
You may be wondering why you would want to make a page inactive. Well,
deleting a page removes the page, the portlets on the page, and (most impor-
tant) whatever information has been entered in those portlets — forever. By
making a page inactive instead of deleting it permanently, the page isn’t
accessible to anyone on the team, but you still have access to it, just in case
you find later that you need it again.
Reorganize up or down.
Figure 14-9:
Managing 
a team

254
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Creating a new page
To create a brand-new page in a team space, click the New Page button and
use the form shown in Figure 14-10 to define its properties and layout. The
name you enter in the Title field determines how the page is listed in the
team space’s navigators and menus.
A page can have one of six layouts, which you select from the Choose a
Layout field. The layout you select serves as a foundation of sorts for the
page, and determines where and how portlets can be added to the page.
After you select the page’s layout, you can (optionally) use the Add Portlets
button that is displayed in each frame of the page to determine which, if any,
portlets appear in that frame.
When you click the Add Portlets button in a frame, you then use the Add
Portlets to Page form to select the portlet that you want to include in that
frame on that page. (You, or someone else on the team, could instead open the
team space and use the Portlet Palette to drag and drop portlets on the page.)
Figure 14-10:
Managing 
a team
space’s
pages.
255
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

One advantage of adding portlets by editing the page (as opposed to drag-
ging and dropping them from the Portlet Palette) becomes obvious when you
choose Show➪Page Content with Portlet Appearance and Locks.
You can change the theme of the portlet, in the unlikely and thoroughly unad-
visable event that you want it to look different than the rest. It’s far more
likely that you will click the portlet’s Lock button, as shown in Figure 14-11, in
order to prevent anyone on the team from deleting the portlet from the page.
In other words, when people view the page in the team space, the portlet in
question doesn’t display the little trash can icon.
If you select a multiframe page layout, you can also click the up, down, left,
and right arrow buttons to rearrange the portlets on the page.
Click Done when you’re finished creating a new page.
When you create a new page in a team space, WSE always puts it at the
bottom of your existing pages. Click the up and down arrow buttons if you
want your new page to get top billing.

Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Editing a page
The steps for editing a page — to change its name, its layout, or the portlets
it contains — are the same as those for creating a new page, except that you
click the name of the page you want to edit on the Pages and Layout form.
Working with Team Space Templates
With just a few exceptions, the concept behind and steps involved in editing
a team space template are the same as those involved in editing individual
team space pages. Of course, you edit a template for different reasons, but
the way you edit it is the same.
Why would you edit a template? You might create your own. Perhaps you find
that every time you create a new team space, you end up adding a new page —
such as the Commission Statements page example I discuss earlier in this
chapter. Make those changes once to the template so that you don’t have to
make them each and every time you create a team space based on the tem-
plate in question.
Managing templates
When you click the Templates link on the toolbar, the Application Template
Library is displayed, as shown in Figure 14-12. Use the library to create new
templates, and manage and modify existing ones.
The library lists each template’s name, owner, category, and modification
date; it also provides icons for editing the template:
 Template Roles: Click this icon to determine the names of the roles that
a new team space will inherit from the template, and what, if any, mem-
bers are assigned to the roles.
 Export: Creates an XML representation of the template that you can
import into the Application Template Library on another WSE server.
This is the way you move templates from one WSE server to another.
 Delete: Deletes a template altogether.
 Unlock: Because templates can be locked to prevent anyone from chang-
ing them, you may sometimes see the Unlock button in the last column
instead of the trash can button. Click this button to unlock a template
and allow changes to be made to it.
257
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

Managing a template’s roles
When you click the Template Roles button, you use the Template Roles form,
shown in Figure 14-13.
Use the Template Roles form to define the roles that you want the template’s
descendants to have. Optionally, you can determine which people or group
names are inherited, too. For example, if you always route submitted drafts
to a group called Expense Approvers, you could prepopulate that group name
in one of the template’s roles.
Although you can preload a role with member names, it’s more common to
define roles generally and leave the assignment of actual people and groups
to particular roles to individual team space owners.
If you are the WSE administrator, consider adding your name as a member of
the Moderators role on each of the templates; then you will automatically
have moderator access to all of the team spaces that are created at your
organization — which can be helpful if you have to help a team space owner
troubleshoot problems.
Click the Close Template Roles button when you are finished editing 
template roles.

Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Importing and exporting templates
The import and export facility is used to convert a template back and forth
between XML. This is the way you move a team space template from one WSE
server to another, and is also an easy way to create a backup of a template.
When you click the Export button, WSE converts the template into an XML
document, and prompts you where to save the new XML file.
Creating a new template
Use the following steps to create a new template:
1. Click the New button.
The New Application Template form is displayed.
2. Enter the name by which the new template will be known in the
Application Template Name field.
3. Choose Category➪Team Space.
4. Optionally, enter a few words about the template’s purpose in the
Description field.

259
Chapter 14: Creating Team Spaces and Team Space Templates

5. If you want your new template to be based on another template, select
the template from the Starting Point drop-down list.
6. Click OK.
WSE creates the new template, and lists it with all the rest in the
Application Template Library.
Editing a template
Edit a template by clicking its name in the Application Template Library.
Figure 14-14 illustrates how similar editing a template is to editing a team
space; the steps, for example, to add a new page to a template are the same
as those described earlier in this chapter in “Customizing a Team Space.”
The WSE Template Editor includes a special toolbar of its own, with five 
buttons:
 Preview: Temporarily closes the Template Editor so that you can see
what a team space based on the template will look like. Click the Done
Previewing button when you’re, well, done previewing.
 Save and Close: Saves the changes you make to the template and closes
the Template Editor.
 Save As: Saves the template with a new name, which you specify.
 Cancel: Abandons the changes you make to the template.
 Help: Although owning a copy of IBM Workplace Services Express For
Dummies dramatically diminishes your need and desire to click the Help
button, there just might be a hint or two in the WSE help system that’s
worth a look.
Creating a new template from a team space
Although you can always use that aptly named New button to create a new
template, there’s another way that may be easier and more practical.
The idea here is to take a team space that’s in production, and convert it
to a template. Because you’ve already made a bunch of modifications to
the team space, converting it to a template (assuming you need it as a tem-
plate) just saves you the steps of making those same modifications all over
again.
260
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Use the following steps to convert a team space to a template:
1. Open the team space in question.
2. Choose Actions➪Edit.
The team space properties page is displayed.
3. Click the Save as New Application Template button.
4. Enter the name for the new template in the Application Template
Name field, and (optionally) add some words describing the tem-
plate’s purpose in the Description field.
5. Click OK, and then click Done.
Unlike some other programs, WSE does not support inheritance between
templates and their descendants. Say that on Monday you create a new team
space based on the Sales Team template. Then, for the sake of the argument,
you add a new page to the Sales Team template, on Tuesday. WSE does not
have a way for the subsequent changes you make in a template to get pushed
into its descendants. In other words, you have to manually add that new page
to the team space, too.

I
BM Workplace Services Express is designed to be easy to run and manage,
and although WSE and the IBM WebSphere Portal and IBM Workplace plat-
forms on which it is based are infinitely configurable, most of the heavy-duty
stuff is purposely buried and hidden from you.
Day in and day out, you will spend more time managing individual team
spaces, and less time worrying about and managing the system itself; the fact
that it’s a pretty self-sufficient program is half the reason you’re using WSE in
the first place.
But there are occasions where you need to administer other parts of WSE.
For example, you may need to manage some custom WSE pages, or perhaps
you want to change the amount of time that WSE waits before automatically
logging out an inactive user.
Chapter 15 lets you get under the hood, introducing you to the important
concepts and settings that you need to know about in order to manage WSE.
Putting on Your Administrator Hat
Administratively speaking, the three areas where you’ll spend your time are,
in order of priority:
1. Managing users: People inevitably come and go, need access to this or
that team space, get transferred from one project to another, and so on.

2. Managing applications: All the things you do to keep a team space or
document library up and running — managing the pages, portlets,
scheduled tasks, and other parts.
3. Managing the portal itself: These are the administrative tasks related to
the portal itself, such as taking care of the URL that people use to access
their team spaces, tweaking the auto logout time period, setting adminis-
trator passwords, and so on.
Considering your entire career with WSE, you’ll spend far more time on items
Number 1 and Number 2 than you will spend on Number 3.
Managing Users and Groups
How, exactly, you manage users depends very much on how your WSE server
and system are set up. More specifically, it’s based on how your WSE server
is configured to use directory services (the database of usernames, pass-
words, groups, and so on).
In the simplest WSE installations, WSE uses its own, built-in directory, running
on a single WSE server. In this scenario, you use the built-in WSE Administrator
to add and edit users, define and edit group members, and so on.
More often, however, WSE is configured to use an external, existing directory,
for a couple of reasons:
 From a very practical point of view, running directory services on a
separate server makes the WSE server perform better. Offloading
directory services to a different server means there is just one less thing
for the WSE server to worry about.
 Most organizations already have a directory that’s set up and function-
ing to help administer your e-mail system and other applications.
Pointing WSE at an existing directory means that people use the same user-
names and passwords in WSE that they use to access other applications.
Although you don’t have to use an external directory with WSE, it’s usually a
good idea, for both performance and practical reasons.
Registering a new user
If you are using WSE’s internal directory, or have write access to an external
LDAP directory, use the following steps to create a new user:
264
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

1. Log in to WSE with a username and password that has administrative
rights.
The home page is displayed.
2. Click the toolbar’s Administration link.
The WSE Administrator forms are displayed.
3. Click the Navigator’s Access link.
The Access page is displayed.
4. Click Users and Groups.
The Manage Users and Groups form is displayed.
265
Chapter 15: Running WSE
Do you LDAP?
WSE works with LDAP (Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol) directories. LDAP is a stan-
dard, and that means you can use WSE with
Microsoft Active Directory, a Lotus Domino
Name and Address book, and so on. In the
cases where WSE uses a separate and exter-
nal directory, it may or may not be configured
with write access to the LDAP directory; this
determines whether or not, for example, you
can add new users from the WSE administrative
pages, or if you must use some other applica-
tion (Microsoft Active Directory, or Lotus
Domino, for example) to create and manage
users and groups.
From a strictly make-this-easy-for-me-to-manage
point of view, it’s certainly easiest for WSE to
have write access to the LDAP directory, but
there may be other concerns that make that
impractical or even downright unadvisable for
your organization. For example, if WSE is being
used and managed by a business unit or depart-
ment in your organization, your IT department
probably is (quite understandably) hesitant to let
WSE change the organization’s directory.
All the issues pertaining to WSE’s directory 
and its relationship with your organization’s
directory affect the mundane tasks of adding
and managing users. Here are the options:
 If your WSE server is using an external
LDAP directory, you probably won’t use
WSE to create and manage users and
groups — you’ll do that in some other appli-
cation. You will manage roles in WSE, but
that’s it.
 If WSE uses its own internal directory, or if
WSE is configured with write access to an
external LDAP directory, you can use the
WSE administrative forms to manage users.
 If WSE is configured to use an external
LDAP directory, but does not have write
access to the directory, you can not use
WSE to create and manage users; you’ll
have to do that externally.
The issues and how-to’s of designing, manag-
ing, and deploying an organization-wide LDAP
directory strategy are well beyond the scope of
this book, and could easily warrant (and already
have, in the case of Microsoft’s Active
Directory) an entire book of their own — check
out Active Directory For Dummies by Marcia
Loughry, published by Wiley.

5. Click the Search button.
All of the available groups are displayed.
6. Click the group to which the new user will belong.
WSE displays the users who are already members of the group you
selected.
7. Click the New User button.
The Provide User Information form is displayed, shown in Figure 15-1.
The form contains a dozen fields. The basic information is required; the
regional fields are optional:
• User ID (required): The ID that the person will use to log in to
WSE, which can be between 3 and 60 characters long.
• Password (required): The accompanying password the person will
use to log in to WSE.
• Confirm Password (required): Make sure you entered the pass-
word correctly.
• First Name and Last Name (required): Fill in what the user’s
momma calls him or her.
• E-mail (required): The person’s e-mail address.
• Preferred Language: The language in which the portal will be pre-
sented to the person.
• Preferred Regional Format: Further customizes the way WSE pre-
sents itself, including such minutiae as currency symbols, date for-
mats, and the like.
• Time Zone: Sets the international time zone for the user.
• Preferred Calendar Type: Select Gregorian, Japanese, Taiwanese,
Buddhist, or Islamic.
• First day of the week: Determines which day will be listed first in
calendars, such as the one presented by the Team Calendar form.
• First work day of the week: Determines which day is considered
the first day of the week for appointments and meetings.
8. Click OK.
WSE adds the new person to the directory, and includes the person as a
member of the group you selected.

Adding an existing user 
to an existing group
The steps for adding an existing user are easy, because you don’t need to
specify a new password and so on for the person. Use these steps to add an
existing member to a group:
1. Log in to WSE with a username and password that has administrative
rights.
The home page is displayed.
2. Click the toolbar’s Administration link.

Excusez-moi, mais parlez-vous WSE?
WSE includes built-in support for 24 languages:
Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Danish,
Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simpli-
fied Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional
Chinese, and Turkish.
When you register a WSE user, the Preferred
Language field determines what language
appears on-screen. When a user who selects
(or for whom you select) English logs in, the
portal is presented in the language of London;
likewise, les utilisateurs français verront la
français. WSE is even smart enough to reorient
the portal based on the language; for example,
when Arabic users log in, the portal is pre-
sented in Arabic and is also presented in a right-
to-left orientation.
Also, many of the WSE portlets are already mul-
tilingual; for example, log in as a French user
and the weather portlet might predict la neige
instead of snow; log in as a German user and the
team calendar knows enough to list Montag,
Dienstag, Mittwoch, and so on (see the figure).
German users don’t see a New Entry button;
they see a Neuer Eintrag button.
However, WSE doesn’t translate content. In
other words, although WSE can translate the
name of, say, the built-in Pending Drafts folder
or the days of the week in a team calendar, WSE
won’t translate the name of a folder you cre-
ated, or the body of a Microsoft Word document
you posted.

5. Click the Search button.
All of the available groups are displayed.
6. Click the group(s) to which the user will be added.
WSE displays the users who are already members of the group you
selected. You can add the user to more than one group by Shift+clicking
or Ctrl+clicking.
7. Click the Add Member button.
The list of WSE users is displayed.
8. Select the name(s) of the people or person to add by clicking the selec-
tion box to the left of each individual’s name.
9. Click OK.
WSE makes the person or people you selected members of the group.
Working with users
As you can see in Figure 15-2, when you search for a user, WSE presents five
buttons:
 View Membership: Shows all the groups of which the individual is a
member, and lets you revoke membership.
 Duplicate Group Assignments: Makes two people members of the same
groups; this is especially useful when adding new members.
 Duplicate Role Assignments: Assigns the same roles to two people; also
very useful when adding new members.
 Edit: Edits the user’s profile, such as resetting their password, preferred
language, and so on.
 Delete: Removes the user — be careful.
Most often, when you add someone to your directory, he or she is joining an
existing team or project. WSE makes duplicating role and group assignments
easy; select the name of the person whose role or group assignments you
want to copy and use the second or third button, shown in Figure 15-2, to
copy the settings to a different person.
269
Chapter 15: Running WSE

Creating a new group
Technically, adding a new group is a one-step process, but in practical terms
you really have to do two things. First you create the new group, and then
you add members to it. Use these steps to add a new group:
1. Log in to WSE with a username and password that has administrative
rights.
The home page is displayed.
2. Click the toolbar’s Administration link.
The WSE Administrator forms are displayed.

3. Click the Navigator’s Access link.
The Access page is displayed.
4. Click Users and Groups.
The Manage Users and Groups form is displayed.
5. Click the New Group button.
The New Group form — it only has one field — is displayed.
6. Enter the name for the new group in the ID field, and click OK.
After you create a new group, use the steps in the section, earlier in this
chapter, called “Adding an existing user to an existing group,” to add
members to it.
Handling resource permissions
The word resource is somewhat loaded. Everything in WSE is considered to
be a resource — every page you see, every page you create, every portlet,
and so on. Fortunately you don’t have to manage the vast majority of WSE
resources; you are likely to be worried about only the resources that are rele-
vant to your particular team space or document library. Here are a few areas
where you need to edit resource permissions:
 You might modify one of the form portlets (see Chapter 13), and subse-
quently want to set the permissions for the new portlet so that only
people with a given role can use it.
 You may need to manage your portal pages. For example, if you add a
new page to WSE, you can modify the resource permissions settings to
determine who has access to it.
 If certain users don’t use their e-mail inside WSE; you could use the
resource permissions settings to determine which role your portal
requires to see and use the Mail page.
You can use resource permissions to set role requirements for any part
of WSE — the home page, the Team Spaces Catalog, an individual team
space, a page in the team space, and so on.
Figure 15-3 shows the Resource Types page, which appears when you click
the Resource Permissions link.
271
Chapter 15: Running WSE

Tread lightly when managing resource permissions. Many of the resources
are necessary system components, and setting their access inappropriately
can make WSE unusable.
Figure 15-3:
Managing
resource
permissions.
272
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 
Taking on the hierarchy
The pages in WSE are collected in a hierarchy.
For example, consider the To Do page. That To
Do page is part of the Mail page. The Mail page
is itself a member of a collection called My
Portal, which also includes the Welcome, Team
Spaces, and Search pages. Further, My Portal
is a member of Content Root, which also includes
the Administration pages, Page Customizer, and
a whole host of other internal pages.
In most cases, the permissions for a given page
are inherited, which is to say that a child page
has, by default, the same permission require-
ments as its parent. For example, the To Do page
in the Mail hierarchy is, by default, available to
everyone who has access to the Mail page. And
by default, the Mail page is available to every-
one who has access to My Portal.
If you wanted to limit the access to the entire
Mail hierarchy, you can do one-stop shopping
by simply modifying the resource permissions
for the Mail page.

Setting permission for a page
Figure 15-4 shows what it looks like when you edit the resource permissions
for the Mail page. To set the permissions for a given page, you first navigate
to the page in question, by clicking the Pages link on the Resource Types
page, and then clicking as many links as it takes to dig through the hierarchy
to get to the page you want to change.
As you can see in the figure, the Mail page contains, by default, four pages of
its own: Mail, Calendar, Address Book, and To Do.
When you click the Assign Access button, WSE displays the Assign Access
form, as shown in Figure 15-5. Use the check boxes to determine whether or
not a given role is required to use the page you selected, and use the Edit
Role buttons to determine which people are assigned as members of the spe-
cific role.
Click OK when you’re finished changing the resource permissions for a 
given page.
Figure 15-4:
Managing
permissions
for a page.
273
Chapter 15: Running WSE

Setting user and group permissions
In the previous section, “Setting permission for a page,” I discuss how you
determine access for a given resource. Alternatively, you can approach
access from the user’s perspective. In effect, you select the person and then
determine what resources he or she can and can’t access.
Simply click the User and Group Permissions button to manage access for an
individual person or for a group of people. After you search for the person or
group, you navigate through the entire resource hierarchy (as described in
the previous section) and select the resources for which the person or group
has access.
Managing Portal Content
The Navigator’s Portal Content button provides the opportunity to manage
how your team spaces and document libraries function.
Figure 15-5:

the role(s)
required to
use a given
resource —

274
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Keeping things fresh with 
workplace policies
A workplace policy keeps a team space or document library in check. You can
specify the maximum size to which the team space can grow, and also set up
use policies to determine what happens if a team space or document library
languishes, unused, on the WSE server for a specified period of time. If and
when a team space is getting close to either threshold, WSE send a warning
e-mail message to whomever you specify.
Although they’re not required, policies are helpful management tools, espe-
cially if you have lots of team spaces. On the other had, if you only have five
or six team spaces, policies probably won’t be worth the trouble.
Figure 15-6 shows the Workplace Policies list, which is used to set up the
policies that WSE has available.
Figure 15-6:
Use policies
to help
manage
your WSE
server.
275
Chapter 15: Running WSE

As you can see in the figure, WSE lists three policy options: Default Team
Space Policy, Default Web Conference Policy, and Default Workplace
Application Policy.
Because WSE doesn’t support Web conferences, and because the like-named
policy was included in WSE by mistake, you only need to worry about team
space and application policies. Team space policies apply to (you guessed it)
team spaces, and application policies are used with document libraries.
In the unlikely event that you have so many team spaces and document
libraries that you need to create multiple policies to manage them, you can
use the New Workplace Application Policy button to do exactly that.
It’s conceivable, for example, that you have two kinds of team spaces —
maybe one bunch that was created by employees of your company, and
another that was created by business partners — so you could have different
policies to help you manage each. You can set up different rules for different
kinds of team spaces, but quite frankly, I think it’s pretty unlikely that you’ll
need to micromanage team spaces this much.
When you create a new policy or edit an existing one, use the fields on the
New Properties form (shown in Figure 15-7) to determine how the policy
functions. There are five fields on the form:
 Name: The policy’s nom de plume.
 Maximum Workplace Application Size: These fields determine what, if
anything, is considered to be the maximum size for the team space or
application. If you set a maximum size, you can also use the Send
Warning Message At field to decide when WSE starts squawking about
that the team space is bloated.
 Send Warning Message When Maximum Workplace Application Size Is
Exceeded To: If you activate this option, choose one or more roles to get
the notification e-mail from WSE that team space needs to lose some
weight; you can also warn all visitors that the team space is tipping the
scales by clicking the Display Warning Message in Home Page of
Application check box.
 Length of Time to Keep After No Activity: This setting determines how
long a team space or document library has before WSE considers it to
have gone stale because of inactivity.
 Send Warning Message for Maximum Days with No Activity To: Select
the people to whom WSE sends an administrative e-mail warning about a
team space that is suffering from lack of use.
276
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

Applying workplace policies
After you define the thresholds and parties to be notified, you can then choose
the team spaces and document libraries to which the WSE policy applies.
Use the following steps to apply a policy to a team space or document library:
1. Log in to WSE with a username and password that has administrative
rights.
The home page is displayed.
2. Click the toolbar’s Administration link.
The WSE Administrator forms are displayed.
3. Click the Navigator’s Portal Content link.
The Portal Content Management page is displayed.
4. Click Workplaces.
The Workplace Policy page appears, as shown in Figure 15-8. The table
shows the list of all the team spaces and document libraries, and which
policy is being used with the application.
Figure 15-7:
Setting up
the rules for
a workplace
policy.
277
Chapter 15: Running WSE

5. Select the team space or document library to which you want to add a
policy by clicking the selection check box next to its name.
You can select more than one option.
6. Choose the policy to apply to the applications you selected by select-
ing it from the Assign Policy drop-down list.
7. Click the Go button.
Timing workplace tasks
Some team spaces and document libraries use scheduled tasks; for example,
the Team Tasks form sends e-mail notifications when tasks are nearly over-
due. Use the Workplace Task Scheduler to tell WSE what to do and when.
Unless you have built your own portlets, or perhaps downloaded a portlet
from the IBM Workplace Solutions catalog, you probably only have two tasks
on your WSE server:
Figure 15-8:
Select a
team
space or
document
library and
use the
Assign
Policy list
to set
its policy.
278
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

 Update Overdue Team Tasks: Part of the Team Tasks Form portlet, this
task runs at the time you specify. WSE examines the team tasks to make
sure that everything is up-to-date and on track.
 Collect Workplace Notifications: Part of workplace policies, as dis-
cussed in the previous section, this task analyzes all of the WSE team
spaces and document libraries vis-à-vis their respective workplace
policy and sends the administrative e-mails for any that have exceeded
their thresholds.
As you can see in Figure 15-9, the Workplace Task Scheduler indicates
whether or not a given task is active in the Enabled column; select a task and
click the Enable or Disable button to determine whether or not WSE should
run the task.
When you click the name of a task, WSE displays the Workplace Task
Scheduler form, as shown in Figure 15-10. Use the fields on the form to select
the time of day when the task will be run, as well as the frequency (daily,
weekly, and so on).
Figure 15-9:
Use the
Workplace
Task
Scheduler
to determine
when and if
a given task

279
Chapter 15: Running WSE

Click the OK button when you are finished scheduling a workplace task.
Managing pages
The WSE Administrator includes management features for pages, similar in
many ways to the page management tools I discuss in Chapter 4.
As you can see in Figure 15-11, the Manage Pages form is displayed when you
click the Navigator’s Portal User Interface button.
It’s a pretty safe bet that the first thing you do after clicking the Navigator’s
Portal User Interface button is click My Portal in the page list, because it con-
tains the user pages that make up your portal.
You use the Manage Pages form to create and manage three types of portal
resources:
 Pages: ’Nuff said.
 Labels: Used to separate content on a page. For example, on a page that
contains other pages, you might use a label to put a separator in the list
of pages that appears on the left.
 URLs: An external Web page, or a link to a WSE Web page.
If a given page contains child pages, its name will be a link; click the link to
manage the page’s children pages.
Figure 15-10:
Use the
Workplace
Task
Scheduler
form to
determine
the exact
time and
frequency
that a given
task will run.
280
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

When you use the New Page, New Label, or New URL buttons, the new
resource comes into the world as a child of the page you’re editing, and as a
sibling, so to speak, of the pages that are already on the page you are working
with. If, for example, you are viewing the Mail page when you add a new page,
after the new page is created it is listed on the Mail page alongside the Calendar
and To Do pages. If, on the other hand, you create a new page while viewing My
Portal, the new page will be listed amongst the Welcome, Mail, Team Spaces,
and Search pages.
For each existing page, URL, or label that the Manage Pages form lists, you
can perform six actions:
 Move Up: Move the page up, or to the left, among its peer pages.
 Move Down: Move the page down, or to the right, among its peer pages.
 Edit Page Properties: Change the page’s title and properties.
 Edit Page Layout: Determine the number of columns on the page and
which portlets the page will contain.
Figure 15-11:
Manage
pages,
labels, and
URLs with

Chapter 15: Running WSE

 Set Page Permissions: Determine who can see and use the page.
 Delete: Remove the page and its contents altogether (proceed with
caution).
Changing the look and feel of WSE 
with themes and skins
Skins and themes control the way WSE presents itself to users. Such attrib-
utes as the portal’s colors, button placement, and so on, are under your con-
trol. WSE includes 20 themes, and you can make your own too.
Skins have a subtle effect; they determine the shading and appearance of the
borders that surround each portlet. Themes make more noticeable changes
to the WSE interface.
Some of the themes have names that are self-explanatory; you can probably
guess that choosing Lime, for example, makes WSE take on a distinctive green
tint. When you change themes, you can adjust navigation models for WSE. For
example, you can specify whether the Navigator and Page buttons are presented
in a top-down or left-right orientation. Figure 15-12 shows the Forest theme.
Playing with the WSE themes is a fairly safe thing to do, so experiment with
the themes until you find the color and navigation combination that suits
your fancy.
Two of the themes that come with WSE are special:
 IBM Workplace Services Express is the default, out-of-the box theme.
The figures in this book use this theme.
 Alloy looks and functions very much like the IBM Workplace Services
Express theme, but does not include any IBM branding.
Use the following steps to change the theme that WSE uses:
1. Log in to WSE with administrative rights.
The home page is displayed.
2. Click the toolbar’s Administration link.
The WSE Administrator forms are displayed.
3. Click Themes and Skins.
The Themes and Skins page is displayed.
282
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

4. From the Themes drop-down list, select the theme you want WSE to
use as the default. Click the Set as Default Portal Theme button.
WSE tells you that the new theme is in effect.
5. Exit the WSE Administrator.
Click the My Work link. You won’t see your changes take effect until you
log out as an administrator.
Figure 15-12:
The Forest
theme is

283
Chapter 15: Running WSE
Getting a peek behind the scenes 
with skins and themes
For those in the know, you can create your own WSE skins and themes by editing the Java Server
Pages (JSPs), Cascading Style Sheets, and HTML pages that make up each theme and skin.
You can find a skin’s files in a directory on the WSE server, such as
C:\WebSphere\AppServer\installedApp\yourservername\wps.ear\
wps.war\skins\html\skinname\Control.jsp
(continued)

284
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 
Files associated with a theme are in a different directory, such as
C:\WebSphere\AppServer\installedApp\yourservername\wps.ear\
wps.war\themes\html\workplace\Default.jsp.
The ins and outs of Java Server Pages and Cascading Style Sheets are, quite frankly, not for the
faint of heart. If, dear reader, you’re already comfortable working with such, here are a few tips for
editing WSE skins and themes. In general, you need to restart WSE every time you make one of
these modifications.
To get started, locate the file named ibm-web-ext.xmi, which is usually in a directory along
the lines of
C:\WebSphere\AppServer\config\cells\yourservername\applications\
wps.ear\deployments\wps\
In this text file, find the string reloadingEnabled=”false” and change it to
reloadingEnabled=”true”. Restart the WSE server after you edit and save this file.
Make sure, when you are done creating your new skin or theme, that you set the ibm-
web-ext.xmi file’s reloadingEnabled attribute back to “false”.
Make a copy of the theme and/or skin you want to modify by copying the theme’s and/or skin’s
directories; use the WSE Administrator’s Add New Theme button to register the new skins and
themes. You can then edit the theme and skin files you copied.
Resource strings for the buttons that are used in a given theme and skin are contained in a series
of files named workplacetheme_XX.properties, where XX indicates the language the
file contains; for example, workplacetheme_fr.properties contains the resource strings
for French. These files are typically found in C:\WebSphere\PortalServer\shared\
app\nls.
So-called general audience resource strings (such as the portal’s title, which displays each page’s
title) are also found in C:\WebSphere\PortalServer\shared\app\nls, and have sim-
ilar names, such as workplacetheme_XX.properties.
To add a custom image as the portal’s logo, you need to edit two toolbars: ToolBar
Includes.jsp and TemplateToolBarIncludes.jsp; add an HTML tag, such as <img
src=”myownlogo.gif” width=”235” height=”25” alt=”My Own Company
Logo”> in the <%-- Link to content --%> section of each JSP.
You can find the reference of record for modifying WSE and WebSphere skins and themes online
from IBM. Visit

index.html.

Getting Specific Administrative Tips
Here are a few administrative tips — things you might consider if you want to
make WSE a little better or easier to use.
Configuring the Forgotten Password page
The WSE Login page includes a link for people to click when they’ve forgotten
their password; the page itself is shown in Figure 15-13. To add your own
instructions to this page, edit the file called engine_XX.properties in 
the C:\WebSphere\PortalServer\shared\app\nls directory. If you’re
editing the version of this page for English users, for example, you edit
engine_en.properties.
Find the section of the file called Forgot Password, and edit the forgot.
sample, forgot.support, forgot.help, and forgot.secret statements
to suit your needs. Doesn’t Figure 15-14 look better?

285
Chapter 15: Running WSE

Setting auto logout features
For privacy and security reasons, WSE automatically logs out inactive users,
usually after 30 minutes. These steps let you change the amount of time WSE
waits before forcing a user to log in again:
1. Log in to the WebSphere Application Server administrative console.
The URL for the WebSphere Application Server administrative console is
probably something like https://yourservername:9044/admin/
logon.jsp.
2. Choose Servers➪Application Servers➪WebSphere Portal➪Web
Container➪Session Management.
The WebSphere Session Management form is displayed, as shown in
Figure 15-15.
3. In the Session Timeout field, enter the number of minutes WSE should
wait before kicking an inactive user out of the system.
The default setting is 30 minutes.

4. Click OK and then click the Save link.
5. Click the Logout link to apply the new setting and close the WebSphere
Administrator.
You have to log out for your changes to take effect.
Adding a Web-based Search engine 
to WSE Search
WSE’s Search facility includes three tabs, by default: Applications, Documents,
and Team Spaces. If you want your searches to be a little more global, you can
follow these steps to add a new tab to WSE search, so that users can use an
external search engine to search the Web:
1. Click the Navigator’s Search button.
The Search form is displayed.
Figure 15-15:
Use the
WebSphere
Adminis-
trator to
change the

time period.
287
Chapter 15: Running WSE

2. Click the Search portlet’s Configure button (which looks like a 
little wrench).
The Search Source list is displayed.
3. Click the Add Search Source button.
4. The Search Source Details form contains three fields, which you must
complete:
• Name: What you enter in this field becomes the name of the tab
that WSE shows in the Search portlet.
• Description: A hint.
• Web Address: The URL for the search engine you’re adding.
To add Google, try this URL:
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-
8&q=
5. Click OK to add the new Search tab.
6. Click OK again to save the new Search tab.
Figure 15-16 shows the Search portal with a Google tab. If you use the
Google URL supplied in Step 4, WSE passes search terms between the
Search portlet’s tabs. In other words, if you were to search Team Spaces
for books by londergan, when you click the Google tab, you automatically
see the results of a Google search for books by londergan.
Changing the WSE default language
Use these steps to determine WSE’s default language. This is the language
WSE will use on the Login page, and for any page in the portal, when the page
is viewed by a person whose profile does not have a language setting. Follow
these steps:
1. Log in to WSE with administrative rights.
The home page is displayed.
2. Click the toolbar’s Administration link.
The WSE Administrator forms are displayed.
3. Click the Navigator’s Portal Settings link.
The Portal Settings page is displayed.
288
Part V: Making IBM Workplace Services Express Your Own 

4. Click Global Settings.
The Global Settings form is displayed.
5. Select the WSE default language from the Default Portal Language list
and click the Save button.
You need to stop and restart WSE before the new language setting 
takes effect.

mpress your friends and coworkers with the following tips and techniques.
Turning Off That Pop-up Ad Blocker
If you have external pop-up ad blocker software, or if your Web browser uses
a pop-up ad blocker, you may have trouble getting WSE to do what it needs to
do. The WSE software often needs to open a new browser window in order to
accomplish a task, so if you’re using pop-up blocker software, you should
turn it off when you’re using WSE.
Bookmarking Anything and Everything
Most people know that bookmarking the WSE Login page is a smart idea, but
did you know you can bookmark anything? If, for example, you frequently use
the same team space, or frequently access a particular document in a partic-
ular document library, create a bookmark when you have the page open. You
just saved yourself a step the next time you need to visit the team space or
document library!

Checking Out the IBM Workplace
Solutions Catalog
WSE comes with a ton of built-in portlets, but that’s just the beginning. You
can find a whole world of additional portlets just waiting for you. WSE works
with any IBM WebSphere 5.1 portlet — and if you don’t know what that means,
you probably don’t need to know what that means. The best place to get new
portlets is the IBM Workplace Solutions catalog, which is owned and operated
by IBM. Not all portlets are free, but some are, and this Web site is definitely
worth a look-see: http://catalog.lotus.com/wps/portal/workplace.
Creating Documents with 
the Built-in Editors
Sometimes Microsoft Office isn’t the right answer, so don’t forget about the
Document, Spreadsheet, and Presentation editors that come with IBM
Workplace Services Express. You wouldn’t write the great American novel
with the WSE’s document editor, but it’s a nice to have when Microsoft Word
isn’t appropriate.
Checking Out the IBM Web Site
The best place to look for information about IBM Workplace Services Express
is, not surprisingly, IBM’s own Web site. This site is the best place to check
technical specifications, download the software, and become a member of
the worldwide WSE community. Take a look at www.ibm.com/software/
workplace/servicesexpress.
Making a Team Space for Anything
Team spaces are easy to create and use, so think outside of the proverbial
box and use WSE early and often. The more team spaces you create and the
more you use WSE, the more ideas you’ll have for using WSE.

Ten Things You Should Never 
Do with Workplace 
Services Express
In This Chapter
 Playing it safe with your password
 Experimenting with the tools
 Getting over the fact that someone might mess up your documents
 Logging out
I
n this chapter, you find a list of ten WSE-related things you should never
do. Heed these warnings and save yourself some heartbreak; or ignore
them at your own peril.
Don’t Tell Anyone Your Password
This probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard this, but the first no-no in IBM
Workplace Services Express is sharing your password. At some companies,
it’s grounds for dismissal. Because so much of your access to WSE materials
is based on who you are — what team spaces you can use, which documents
you can edit, and everything else — you wouldn’t want an unauthorized
person to be able to log in to WSE and wreak havoc. And writing your pass-
word on a sticky note and sticking it to your monitor isn’t such a hot idea,
either. Make your password easy for you to remember and hard for others to
guess. And then keep it quiet.

Don’t Resist Getting Your Feet Wet
Are you having WSE anxiety? Don’t! WSE is easy to use, and is pretty forgiv-
ing. The best way to start using WSE is to start using WSE. Create a team
space, post some documents, and play around with some pages on your own.
Go ahead, the Portlet Palette won’t bite. If you’re not sure how to do some-
thing, experiment anyway. What’s the worst that could happen?
Don’t Change Your User ID on Your Own
It’s just not a good idea. If you do need a new or different user ID, that usually
happens in your external LDAP directory, and not in WSE. Talk to your admin-
istrator or manager if you want to change this kind of information.
Don’t Forget the Team
Wouldn’t life have been better in preschool if everyone had remembered to
share? It’s not yours, it’s ours. The kind of work you do in WSE and the kind of
information you post is, by its very nature, shared. That means that some-
times you need to think twice about changing a document or page you see in
WSE; even though you might have ideas about how a document could be
improved, you’ll probably want to gather consensus from the team before
making a ton of wholesale changes.
Don’t Use Office When the Productivity
Components Will Do
Sometimes Microsoft Office isn’t the right choice, so don’t forget about the
Document, Spreadsheet, and Presentation editors that come with IBM
Workplace Services Express. They’re nice to have if Microsoft Word isn’t
appropriate.
298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Get Too Caught Up 
in WSE Discussions
Many WSE team space templates provide a page for discussion forums, but
the discussion forums may not be as robust as you need them to be. They
don’t support rich text, you can’t attach files, and so on, so they may be
impractical — even if you do like using them. WSE chat rooms — where your
team can work together in real time — are way, way better.
Don’t Forget to Log Out
When you’re leaving WSE (is it time for lunch already?), make sure to log out
in order to prevent any unauthorized access. Logging out only takes two sec-
onds, and logging back in takes even less time when you return. In other
words, you really have no excuse. . . .
Don’t Forget to Publish a Document
Remember to click that Publish button when you are finished editing an older
document or creating a new document. Otherwise, your changes may be lost.
Don’t Manage Users in WSE
In almost all cases, user management (defining user IDs and passwords, spec-
ifying which person belongs to which group, and stuff like that) is best han-
dled externally, as far as WSE is concerned. See Chapter 15.
Don’t Talk to Strangers
And it’s not a good idea to take wooden nickels, either.

Ten (Okay, Seven) Special
Reminders If You 
Use Microsoft 
In This Chapter
 Editing Office documents in WSE
 Sending e-mail without switching programs
 Staying on a single server or stretching out to two
 Calming down about compatibility issues
I
s your company a Microsoft shop? Here are a few things you should keep
in mind if you’re a Microsoft person (or working for a company that uses a
lot of Microsoft stuff) using IBM Workplace Services Express for the first time.
Using Round-Trip Editing
WSE is designed to work very, very closely with Microsoft Office. Round-trip
editing is the fancy feature that lets you create a Microsoft Office document
(or spreadsheet, or presentation) in WSE and save it into a WSE document
library, where it’s available to the whole team. See Part IV for everything you
need to know about handling documents in WSE.
If you use Office, you should not be importing documents on a regular basis.
Use round-trip editing instead. It’s faster and more convenient.

Sending E-mail from within 
the WSE Program
WSE comes with a built-in portlet that you can use to add your Microsoft
Exchange–based e-mail, calendar, and contact list to the Mail page. You don’t
have to toggle over to your Outlook inbox!
Remembering the Desktop Components
Sometimes Microsoft Office isn’t the right answer, so don’t forget about the
document, spreadsheet, and presentation editors that come with IBM
Workplace Services Express. You wouldn’t write the great American novel
with the WSE’s Document editor, but it’s a nice to have when Microsoft Word
isn’t appropriate.
Using WSE with any Version 
of Microsoft Office
WSE’s content features (drag-and-drop publishing, round-trip editing, 
desktop components, and so on) work with Microsoft Office 97, Office 2000,
and Office XP.
Following the Single Server Promise
WSE is intended to run on as little hardware as possible. Sometimes that means
you run WSE on a single server, or (more likely) you run WSE on one server,
but point it at a different server for its LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol) directory — otherwise known as your company’s address book. WSE
is intended to work very well alongside Microsoft’s Active Directory.
Moving Beyond Windows and Office
Extended teams — especially those that include people from outside your
organization — don’t necessarily use the same software you use. Some may
302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

use an older version of Microsoft Office, and others may use Linux. WSE elim-
inates the compatibility issues that may come up, so feel free to extend your
idea of what a team is.
Relaxing
Despite the fact that WSE comes from IBM, and despite the fact that IBM and
Microsoft compete in many areas, WSE is designed to be a very easy and nat-
ural choice for Microsoft customers. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that
just because your company is a Microsoft shop, you need to use all Microsoft
products. WSE is designed to work in any kind of company and with just
about any kind of technology, so the hope is that you’ll find that WSE is a
great complement to whatever Microsoft software you already use.

Ten (Or So) Special Reminders 
If You’re a Penguin
In This Chapter
 Getting comfortable with the productivity components
 Installing JRE
 Avoiding the desktop components
D
o you use Linux? Or are you part of a team that uses Linux? Here are a
few things to keep in mind.
Getting the Support You Need
If you’re reading this chapter, you don’t need to be told that Linux has started
to take the world by storm. As Linux becomes more and more popular, a lot
of software vendors are rushing to include Linux support in their applica-
tions. But sadly, Linux support is often an afterthought; some software that
boasts both Windows and Linux support treats Linux users as second-class
citizens. That is not the case with WSE; it’s been designed from the get-go to
deliver the same functionality to users, whether they use the Linux operating
system or Windows. Put simply, WSE works great with Linux.
Using the Productivity Components
Penguins should become comfortable with WSE’s built-in productivity com-
ponents for creating simple documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
These components are essential to the collaborative functions of IBM
Workplace Services Express. The productivity components help you create
and share content with the other people on your team, who themselves may
or may not be Linux users, and who may or may not use Microsoft Office.

Installing That Special Applet
Linux desktop users need a special applet to work with WSE document
libraries — specifically to connect WSE with your local document editing
applications, to communicate with the desktop, and to let you import multi-
ple files from your local file system to the WSE document libraries. The
applet, in turn, requires you to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
installed on your browser.
The good news is that the required applet is automatically downloaded and
installed the first time you import a document. If you have a JRE installed,
you’re prompted to accept an IBM certificate. Not surprisingly, you should
accept this IBM certificate when prompted to do so. That’s all you need to do
to install the applet.
Steering Clear of the 
Desktop Components
The desktop components that come with IBM Workplace Services Express —
which allow Windows users to treat a WSE document library as a virtual
Windows Explorer folder — do not work with Linux desktops. Skip them.
Moving Beyond the Users
IBM Workplace Services Express isn’t just about the users. Sure, WSE sup-
ports Linux clients, but don’t forget you can also use Linux as the operating
system for your WSE servers, too.
Remembering that Not 
Everyone Uses Linux
Some members of your team will inevitably use Windows and Office. Take pity
on them, but don’t forget them. Be prepared, and don’t be surprised if you see
some documents in your team spaces that originated in Microsoft Office.
306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Keeping in Mind that WSE Works 
with Many Versions of Linux
So you don’t use plain-vanilla Linux? IBM Workplace Services Express is com-
patible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SuSE Linux Enterprise Server;
check www.ibm.com/software/workplace/servicesexpress if you
need more particulars about a release, which Linux components need to be
installed, and so on.

Appendixes

In this part . . .
Your appendix is a small organ located on the left side
of your lower abdomen. Although doctors long
thought it to be a vestigial organ of unknown origin, new
research has shown . . . Whoops, wrong book.
The brief appendixes in this part contain some important
information about Workplace Services Express, none of
which will cause swelling or inflammation.

Appendix A
Maybe Mail, Maybe Not
In This Appendix
 Figuring out what you need to do
 Configuring mail so that it plays nice with WSE
B
ecause you use your inbox all the time, it’s fairly common that you’d
want to have access to it from within IBM Workplace Services Express;
almost every example presented in this book, for example, includes a tab for
accessing your mail. Click the Mail tab and you can find your inbox, calendar,
contact list, and so on — assuming that it’s configured to work with IBM
Workplace Services Express.
WSE comes with a set of portlets that you can use to hook up with your mail
system. This short appendix describes the whys and hows of configuring
your e-mail with WSE. Listen up if you’re an IT administrator!
Getting Your Mail Program 
in Line with WSE
WSE has a lot of features built in, but e-mail isn’t one of them. WSE provides
the portlets you can use to wire WSE up with whatever mail system you
already have.
There are eight portlets that come with WSE. One of them is surely the right
one to interact with your current mail program:
 Consolidated Mail Client: Use this portlet to connect WSE to an IMAP,
POP3, Microsoft Exchange 5.5, or Microsoft Exchange 2000 server.
 IBM Internet Mail Box: Use this portlet to connect to an Internet-based
mail server that receives, composes, and sends mail (you can use many
Web-based e-mail programs, such as Gmail or Hotmail).

 Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Mail: This portlet connects WSE to (you guessed
it) Microsoft Exchange 5.5 so that you can read and send e-mail messages.
 Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Calendar: This portlet connects WSE to Microsoft
Exchange 5.5 so that you can work with your meetings and appointments.
 Microsoft Exchange Contacts: This portlet connects WSE to Microsoft
Exchange 5.5 so that you can work with your Microsoft contacts.
 Microsoft Exchange Notes: This portlet connects WSE to Microsoft
Exchange 5.5 Notes.
 Microsoft Exchange Tasks: This portlet connects WSE to Microsoft
Exchange 5.5 so that you can work with your meetings and appointments.
 Domino Web Access: This portlet connects a Domino server so that you
can interact with your mail, calendar, to-do list, contacts, and notebook.
If your mail system isn’t listed here, or if you want to download the latest and
greatest version of the mail portlet you’ll be using, visit http://catalog.
lotus.com/wps/portal/workplace.
WSE’s Mail tab in the Navigator comes preloaded with three pages of mail-
related activities. The three pages are called Mail, Calendar, and Address
Book. Setting up WSE to connect with your (or your users’) e-mail is simply a
matter of picking the right portlet for the right page and then doing a little
configuration work (entering the name of your POP3 server, for example).
Setting Up WSE and Your Mail System
In the following section, I show you how to set up Lotus Domino–based mail.
If you don’t use Domino, use one of the other portlets instead. The steps for
setting up, say, Microsoft Exchange, or Internet-based mail are remarkably
similar to those I present in the next few pages — except for Steps 4 and 6,
when you pick one of the portlets.
Adding the Domino Web Access 
portlet to the Mail page
Use these steps to use WSE with IBM Lotus Domino–based e-mail:
312
Part VII: Appendixes 

1. Click the Mail tab in the Navigator.
The Mail page appears.
2. Click the Portlet Palette.
The WSE Portlet Palette slides out to show you the tools you have avail-
able. (That slider thing is still my favorite part of WSE.)
Because the Domino Web Access portlet probably isn’t in the default
list, you have to add it.
If you see the Domino Web Access portlet in the palette, skip ahead to
Step 6.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the Portlets list and click Add.
The Add Item To Category Portlets form appears.
4. Enter Domino in the Title Contains field and click OK.
The list of matching portlets appears.
5. Select Domino Web Access by clicking the check box that appears
next to it. Then click OK.
Domino Web Access is listed among the available portlets in the 
Portlet Palette.
6. Add the Domino Web Access portlet to the Mail page.
Simply drag it from the Portlet Palette to the page.
The portlet appears on the page and (usually) magically displays your
e-mail inbox, in all its sartorial splendor.
Configuring the Domino 
Web Access portlet
The Domino Web Access form, shown in Figure A-1, is used to control how
the portlet interacts with and displays your mail. Click the Domino Web
Access portlet’s Edit button to open the form.
313
Appendix A: Maybe Mail, Maybe Not

As you can see in the figure, the form has several fields that you can use to
fine-tune how WSE interacts with Domino:
 Functional Area: Because the Domino Web Access portlet can display
more than just your inbox, use this field to select what the portlet will
display.
In the example described in the previous section, you’d select Mail; if
you were adding the Domino Web Access portlet to the Calendar page,
you’d pick Calendar in this field instead.
 Application Title: This title appears at the top of the Mail portlet.
 Width: Determines how much of the screen the Domino Web Access
portlet will take up when it’s open.
 Source: Determines whether WSE should automatically interact with the
Domino server to determine your mail file’s location, or if users will have
to enter the server name, filename, and port number manually.
 Protocol: Determines which protocol WSE will use when communicating
with the Domino mail server.
 Use Reverse Proxy Server: If your mail server is protected by a reverse
proxy server, use the fields in this section to indicate the server’s name
and other particulars.

Part VII: Appendixes 

Knowing the Domino Web Access 
portlet’s other attributes
The Domino Web Access portlet is also the portlet you use if you want to
have access to your calendar, to-do list, Personal N&A book, and notebook.
There is one difference between using Domino-based mail with WSE and
using Exchange-based mail with WSE. For Domino, you use one portlet, and
then configure it to display your inbox, calendar, Personal N&A book, and so
on. Although Microsoft Exchange sports all those same capabilities when
used with WSE, you must use a separate portlet to access each.
The steps to make your Domino-based calendar and address book appear on
the WSE Calendar and Address Book pages are almost the same as those
described for adding your inbox:
1. Open the page you want to add the portlet to — the Calendar page,
for example.
2. Use the Portlet Palette to drag the Domino Web Access portlet onto
the page.
3. Click the Domino Web Access portlet’s Edit button and use the
Functional Area field to change the portlet’s content to the appropri-
ate selection.
For example, if you’re adding the calendar, select Calendar from the
Functional Area drop-down list.
Depending on which Functional Area you choose, the Domino Web Access
form may have a few more questions for you. For example, when you choose
the Calendar option, the form automatically expands so that you can deter-
mine whether the default calendar will be one day, one week, one month, and
so on.
You may want WSE to display your Domino-based notebook or to-do list in
addition to your calendar. The easiest way to add them is to add the Domino
Web Access portlet to your Calendar page, twice. You then point the top
instance of the portlet at your calendar and point the second instance of the
portlet at your to-do list or notebook.
Alternatively, you can add a new page to hold your to-do list or notebook.
Use these steps to add a new page altogether (you may need to log in with
administrative rights to complete the steps):
1. Click the Administration link in the toolbar.
The Portal User Interface page appears.
315
Appendix A: Maybe Mail, Maybe Not

2. Click Manage Pages.
The Content Root list (every WSE page on your server) appears.
3. Click My Portal.
A list of pages in My Portal appears.
4. Click Mail.
A list of pages in Mail appears.
5. Click the New button to add a new page.
The New Page Mail form appears.
6. Enter a name for the new page in the Title field.
If you’re adding the notebook, type notebook.
What you enter in the Title field is what’s listed in the Mail page’s
Navigator.
If you are creating one new page to hold both your Domino To Do list
and Notebook, use the Properties field in the Advanced Options section
of the form to make the page use two columns.
7. Click the OK button. Then click it again.
The new page is listed among the other pages in Mail. Optionally, use the
up and down arrow buttons to manually rearrange the pages.
8. Click the Edit button to change the new page’s content.
The Edit layout form appears.
9. Click the Add Portlets button.
The Add Portlet form appears. If the Domino Web Access portlet isn’t in
the list, use the Search On field or the Jump to Page button to find it.
10. Click the Selection box next to Domino Web Access and then click OK.
11. If you are finished adding portlets to the page, click Done.
If not, use the Add Portlets button to add more portlets and click the
Done button when you have added them all.
The list of pages in Mail appears.
You can confirm that your new page has been added to Mail by clicking
the toolbar’s My Work button to close the WSE Administrator, and click-
ing the Mail tab in the Navigator.
316
Part VII: Appendixes 

Because the page in the previous example was added through the WSE
Administrator, the new page (which includes the Domino Web Access port-
let) will be included in Mail for all of the portal’s users. However, each person
must configure the Domino Web Access portlet to display the notebook or 
to-do list.
No Mas? No Mail?
What if you don’t want people to see the Mail tab in WSE? Perhaps your com-
pany uses Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes for e-mail, and consequently you
don’t want people getting confused and trying to use WSE to interact with
their mail. Or perhaps you’re inviting customers to collaborate with you in
WSE; although such customers would visit your WSE server to interact with
your shared team spaces, letting them visit your WSE server to read their
e-mail doesn’t make sense.
The easiest way to mask the Mail pages from all or some of the users in your
organization and beyond is to use the Mail page’s access permissions to
exclude specific users.
Use these steps to change who can see and use the Mail page:
1. Click the Administration link in the toolbar.
The Portal User Interface page appears.
2. Click Manage Pages.
The Content Root list (which includes every WSE page on your server)
appears.
3. Click the Set Page Permissions button (which looks like a key) for the
Mail page.
The Assign Access for Pages➪Mail form appears.
4. Assign the access as you see fit.
Figure A-2 shows the Resource Permissions page. What you do here
depends on how you intend to manage the Mail tab. If, for example, you
intend to hide the Mail page from everyone on the team, uncheck all of
the boxes on the Assign Access for Pages➪Mail form.
317
Appendix A: Maybe Mail, Maybe Not

If, on the other hand, you intend to hide the Mail page from some (but
not all) members of the team, use the role check boxes to select the role
that is required to use the page, and use the Edit Role buttons to deter-
mine which user or group is or isn’t a member of the requisite role.
5. Click OK, and then click Done, when you’re finished changing the
Mail page’s access properties.

The Desktop Components

 Understanding what the desktop components do
 Installing and configuring the components
 Using the desktop components with Microsoft Office
T
he desktop components that come with IBM Workplace Services Express
provide an optional way to interact with document libraries through
Windows Explorer, and this appendix explains how to install and use them.
If you’re a Linux user, skip this appendix. The desktop components don’t
work unless you use Microsoft Windows and have Microsoft Office installed.
Also, some Windows users may prefer to interact with document libraries
with their Web browsers, as we discussed in Chapters 11 and 12. If you prefer
the browser view, go ahead and skip this appendix.
Discovering the Desktop Components
The IBM Workplace Services Express desktop components provide an interest-
ing alternative for interacting with WSE document libraries, because they
allow you to work with document libraries without using your Web browser.
When you install the desktop components, you can work with WSE document
libraries directly from Windows Explorer. For example, you can drag a file
from your desktop into the Desktop Components window, and, like magic, the
file is automatically uploaded to the document library.

The desktop components also integrate with Microsoft Office. For example,
you can use the Microsoft Word menu to save a file directly into a WSE docu-
ment library.
In effect, installing the desktop component software on your Windows work-
station fools Windows into thinking that a WSE document library is a local
folder.
Figure B-1 shows, for example, a Microsoft Windows Explorer window, view-
ing the folders and contents in a WSE document library. What’s important to
note is that those are the exact same folders and documents you’d see if you
visited that same document library with your favorite Web browser.
If you want to use the desktop components, installing and running the desk-
top component software is pretty easy, as you can see in the following sec-
tion. In fact, the desktop components software is typically installed so that it
is loaded, automatically, every time you start your computer, and it runs in
the system tray.

Installing the Desktop Components
Use these steps to install the WSE desktop components on a Windows 
workstation:
1. Open a WSE document library.
2. Choose Tools➪Install Desktop Components.
The desktop components Installation screen appears.
3. Click the Install Now link to begin the installation process.
You could instead use the Download link to download the desktop com-
ponents installer if you want to install them later.
4. Click OK if you see the Document Manager Plug-In dialog box.
The IBM Workplace Document Manager Desktop Components
InstallShield dialog box appears.
If you don’t see the Document Manager Plug-In dialog box, the
InstallShield dialog box appears on its own.
5. Click Next.
The License Agreement dialog box appears.
6. Read every last word of the license (there will be a quiz later) and, if
you agree, click the I Accept the Terms in the License Agreement
radio button. Then click Next.
The Destination Folder dialog box appears. By default, WSE installs the
desktop component software in the directory shown. Use the browse
button if you need to change the location.
7. Click Next.
The Ready to Install the Program dialog box appears.
8. Click the Install button.
WSE installs the software; this step usually takes about two minutes.
When finished, the InstallShield Wizard Completed dialog box appears.
9. Click the Finish button to exit the installation program and load the
desktop component software.
321
Appendix B: The Desktop Components

Configuring the Desktop 
Component Software
Figure B-2 shows the Desktop Components Setup dialog box, which is used to
configure the desktop component software to connect with your WSE server.
Before you can use the desktop components, you must configure them. To
access the Desktop Components Setup dialog box, open My Computer and
double-click the Document Manager option. In the new window that appears,
choose File➪Add Server.
The Desktop Components Setup dialog box has several fields, all of which
(except Save Password) are required:
 Document Manager Server URL: Add the URL that the desktop compo-
nent software will use to access your WSE server.
 Server User ID: Enter your user ID, the same one you use when you log
in to WSE with your browser.
 Server Password: Enter your password, the same one you use when you
log in to WSE with your browser.
 Save Password: Click this check box if you don’t want to get asked for
your password every time you start the desktop component software.
 Server Display Name: Enter the name by which you want the server to
be listed in Windows Explorer.
 Local Directory: This field determines where WSE will store the local, tem-
porary files you work on. You usually do not need to change this field’s
default value, so don’t change the info here unless you have a good reason.
Figure B-2:

Part VII: Appendixes 

When you’re done with this part of the Desktop Components Setup dialog
box, click Next. The Step 2 dialog box appears, as shown in Figure B-3.
Don’t get put off by the fields in the Desktop Components Setup dialog box;
enter the same URL and username that you’ve been using all along. Give your
WSE administrator a call if you do get thwarted.
You have to decide whether to click the Save Documents to the Server as
Private Drafts check box. If you don’t want documents you edit with the desk-
top components software to be immediately published or submitted for
approval, then click the check box. If you do, leave it alone.
When you’re done with the Step 2 dialog box, click Finish. A Windows Explorer
window opens, showing the folders and documents in the WSE document
library intermingled with the folders and documents on your local hard drive.
Although this window is connected to your WSE document library, you can
use it as you would any other Windows Explorer window — for example, you
can click the column heading to sort the window’s contents, change from a
detail view to a large icon view, and so on. You will also find a new Document
Manager icon listed under My Computer.
Using the Document Manager Icons
Here’s a list of the special Document Manager icons you’re likely to see in
Windows Explorer:
 Document Manager: The gateway to the WSE document libraries.
 WSE Server: This icon appears next to the name of the servers when
you open the Document Manager.
Figure B-3:
Configuring
the desktop

323
Appendix B: The Desktop Components

 Document Library: You see this icon when you open a WSE server; it
appears next to each document library you can use.
 Folder: The name says it all.
 Document: A document that’s in the document library.
 View Pending Drafts: Click this icon to see the documents in the library
that are pending your review.
 Draft: This icon appears next to a document that is not yet published.
 Pending Approval: This icon appears next to a document in a workflow-
enabled library, which is not yet approved.
 Locked Documents: Click this icon to see the documents in the library
that are locked.
 Locked Document: This icon appears next to a document that can’t be
edited.
 Upload Failure: This icon identifies a document that the desktop com-
ponent software could not upload to the WSE server for some reason.
(Did you kick out that Ethernet cable?)
Using the Desktop Components 
to Interact with a WSE 
Document Library
If you know how to use Microsoft Windows, you know how to interact with a
document library; you just treat it almost like another drive or folder on your
computer.
For example, to copy a file from your local file system into the document
library, simply click the Document Manager icon, navigate to the document
library’s folder, and then drag and drop the file from your computer into that
folder. When you drop a file into a Document Manager folder, you are really
uploading the document into the document library; when the copy finishes
uploading, for example, anyone who visits the document library with their
browser can see and use the document as they would any other.
To delete a file, right-click on the file and select Delete from the mouse’s pop-
up menu. Same (or similar) deal if you want to create a new document or
folder, and so on.
324
Part VII: Appendixes 

These processes work just the same way that any other Windows folder does —
with one exception: You can’t use the desktop components to create a new
document library.
Using a new document library
When you use WSE for the first time, it is configured to point at the document
library you used to download the desktop component software. Use the fol-
lowing steps to add an additional document library:
1. Open the Document Manager.
The list of WSE servers you can use appears.
2. Open the WSE server.
Double-click it.
The list of document libraries you are already connected to appears.
3. Right-click in the Document Manager window and select Add Library
from the pop-up menu.
The Add Document Library dialog box, which lists all of the document
libraries that are available on the WSE server, appears.
4. Select the document library you want to add and click Next.
5. Use the Local Directory field to determine where WSE will store the
local temporary files for this document library.
Usually you do not need to change this field’s default value.
6. Click the Save Documents to the Server as Private Drafts check box if
you don’t want the documents you edit when using the desktop compo-
nents software to be immediately published or submitted for approval.
7. Click Finish.
A Windows Explorer window opens, showing the folders and documents
in the document library you added.
Editing documents
When you edit documents with the desktop components (open such a file 
by either double-clicking it in the Desktop Component window or by using
Microsoft Office to open the document from the library directly), the desktop
components software downloads the file you choose into the directory you
325
Appendix B: The Desktop Components

selected when you added the library. When you save the file, the desktop
component software takes care of uploading the file back into the document
library.
Using the desktop components 
with Microsoft Office
WSE has a special relationship with Microsoft Office, so it’s no surprise that
the desktop components software does, too.
When you install the desktop components, and you have Microsoft Office, a
special addition is made to Office’s File menu, in order to make it easy to use
Microsoft Office with your document library.
For example, Figure B-4 shows what it looks like when you open a Microsoft
Word document from a WSE document library.
Figure B-4:
Using
Microsoft
Office with a

library.
326
Part VII: Appendixes 

When you use Office to work with a document library, choose File➪
Document Manager to interact with your libraries on the WSE server. 
You have seven choices:
 Open from Library: This option lets you open and edit a document from
a WSE document library. When you save the document, it is automati-
cally saved in the WSE document library.
 Add to Library: Similar to Save As, this option takes whatever document
you have open in Office and saves it in a document library.
 Lock: After you select a document in a library, use this option to prevent
anyone from making changes to a document.
 Unlock: After you select a document in a library, use this choice to allow
someone on the team to make changes.
 Submit Draft: When you have opened a document from a document
library that has workflow turned on, use this choice to submit a docu-
ment for approval.
 Delete Draft: This option removes the selected document.
 Properties: This option displays information about the selected 
document.
These WSE options should sound familiar; they mimic the buttons you have
available when you are working with a document library via your browser.
Using the Desktop Components with
Other Windows Applications
Although the desktop components sport such tight integration with Office,
you can use them with any Windows application. If you use Lotus 1-2-3, for
example, and want to edit a spreadsheet from a document library, choose
File➪Open in Lotus 1-2-3 and navigate to My Computer➪Document Manager➪
your WSE server➪your document library, and so on until you find the file you
wanted to edit. Figure B-5 shows that any Windows program can be used to
work with the files in a document library.

Using the Domino 
Application Portlet
In This Appendix
 Using the Domino Application Portlet
 Configuring the portlet to access a Domino application
T
he Domino Application portlet is special. It provides an easy way to com-
bine your WSE portal with Domino applications. If you have a Domino
server, and Domino applications on the server, use this portlet to make those
applications work with WSE. What makes the portlet so special? Well, it’s free
and included with WSE.
If you can’t find a copy, or want to make sure you have the latest and greatest,
search for domino application portlet at the IBM Workplace Solutions catalog.
The other thing that makes the portlet special is how easy it is to use. You
just drop this baby on a WSE page, tell it which Domino server and database
to use, and you’re off to the races.
Adding the Portlet to the Portlet Palette
Although the Domino Application portlet is included with WSE, it usually isn’t
included in the Portlet Palette, until you add it. Use the following steps to add
the Domino Application portlet to the Portlet Palette:
1. Open the Portlet Palette.
The list of available portlets is displayed.

2. Click the Add link at the bottom of the list.
The Add Item To Category Portlets form appears.
3. Enter domino application in the Title Contains field and click the
Search button.
The Domino Application portlet appears.
4. Click in the check box next to the Domino Application portlet to select
it and click OK.
The Domino Application portlet is added to the list of available portlets
in the Portlet Palette.
Using the Domino Application Portlet 
in IBM Workplace Services Express
Add the Domino Application portlet to a WSE page the way you would add
any other portlet; open the Portlet Palette and drag the Domino Application
portlet onto the page.
Figure C-1 shows the newly added, but not yet configured, Domino Application
portlet.
Click the portlet’s Edit button (which looks like pencil) and use the Domino
Application Portlet form, shown in Figure C-2, to configure it.
Figure C-1:
The Domino
Application
portlet.
330
Part VII: Appendixes 

The form has ten fields:
 Username: If the Access Control List (ACL) of the Domino database
requires authentication, enter the name the portlet should use to log in
to WSE in this field.
 Password: If the ACL of the Domino database requires authentication,
enter the password the portlet will use to log in to WSE in this field.
 Protocol: The protocol that the Domino server uses for Web 
connections — either HTTP or HTTPS.
 Host: The name of the server that holds the Domino database.
 Port: The port number used for access to the Domino server.
 Path and Filename: The path and filename of the Domino database.
 Width: This field sets the width for the frame the portlet will use. The
default value is 100 percent; you probably don’t need to change this value.
Figure C-2:
Tell the
Domino
Application
portlet how
to talk to
your

server.
331
Appendix C: Using the Domino Application Portlet

 Height: How tall the portlet will be, in pixels. The default setting is 500
pixels, and you probably don’t need to change this value.
 Border: The number of pixels for the portlets border; enter 0 if you
don’t need a border.
 Portlet Title: Text that goes at the top of the portlet. If you don’t change
this field, the title remains Domino Application Portlet.
The Authentication Model, Credential Vault Setting, and System Slot Identifier
fields are used in certain portal configuration settings. You need to contact
your system administrator if you have reason to believe that these fields are
for you, because they probably aren’t. Otherwise, leave them alone.
Click the Save button and then click the Close button when you’re finished.

Appendix E
Installing IBM Workplace
Services Express
In This Appendix
 Getting WSE installed and running
 Playing with the WSE server
T
his appendix contains an overview of the installation process for IBM
Workplace Services Express 2.5. It’s been said that WSE installs in under
an hour, and although that may not be the most enjoyable way to spend an
hour, it could be a lot worse; some products that combine collaboration, doc-
ument management, instant messaging, and a portal could literally take days
to build and configure.
The steps in this appendix describe how you can install the simplest WSE
configuration by using the Workplace Services Express Installation Wizard. In
this example, all of WSE will be running on the same server.
If you are planning to use WSE for a large or complex team, or if you anticipate
that you’ll need room for a lot of team spaces, it behooves you to consider using
two or more servers, divvying up the responsibility for the collaboration, data-
base, authentication, instant messaging, and portal functions between them.
Details about installing and configuring such a WSE system are described 
in the documentation for WSE, available online at IBM’s Web site. Visit
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wseic/v2r5/index.
jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wse.doc/wpf/cust_ovr.html.
Installing WSE
Of course, the first step in installing WSE is to get your hot little hands on the
software. After you do that, you can either run the installation program and
wizards directly from the WSE DVD, or you can copy the WSE DVD’s contents
onto the hard drive of the computer onto which you’re installing WSE.

In either case, you need to switch to the directory that contains the installa-
tion files, which is usually named WSEserver. For example, switch to per-
haps D:\WSEserver (if D: is your server’s DVD drive, or whichever drive is
appropriate for your system). Then follow these steps:
1. If you’re installing WSE on a Windows server, run the install.bat
batch file that’s in the WSEserver directory.
If installing on Linux, run /install.sh.
You must be logged in as a root user to install WSE on a Linux server.
2. Select the language for the installation, and then click OK.
3. Click Next on the Welcome panel.
4. Select I Accept the Terms in the License Agreement and click Next.
5. Enter the name of the directory in which you want to install WSE in
the Directory field, or use the Browse button to select the directory
and click the Next button.
You can install WSE in any directory you want, as long as you remember
where you put it.
6. Enter the WSE server’s host name in the Hostname field (shown in
Figure E-1) and click the Next button.
The Password dialog box appears.
7. Choose an Administrator ID and password, and enter them in the
Administrator User ID, Password, and Confirm password fields and
click the Next button.
Figure E-1:
Enter the
new WSE
server’s
host name.
340
Part VII: Appendixes 

8. Make sure that you’re cool with everything shown in the Confirmation
dialog box. If you notice a mistake, use the Back button to go back and
fix the error. If everything looks okay, click the Next button.
9. Go get a cup of coffee.
I’m not even kidding. It’ll take WSE a good 20 or 30 minutes to copy all
the files, unpack them, put them where they belong, and generally get
everything nice and tidy. There’s no reason for you to sit there while
WSE grinds away. Trust me, there’s nothing to see.
Finally, the Congratulations dialog box appears.
10. Click the Start IBM Workplace Services Express check box and then
click the Next button.
11. Time for more coffee.
Starting WSE for the first time is going to take awhile, too. Not as long as
Step 9 did, but you definitely have time to get a refill on that cup of joe.
The IBM Workplace Services Started Successfully dialog box appears.
12. Select the Launch First Steps check box and click the Next button.
What happens next definitely, as they say, depends. The WSE Installation
Wizard starts your Web browser and opens your WSE server’s home
page. At this stage of the game, it’s likely that the only user ID that’s
been set up is the one you entered in Step 7, so you can either log in
with that user ID and password or register (see Chapter 2) to give your-
self a real user ID and password.
If you plan to configure WSE to use an existing directory (LDAP or Active
Directory) rather than its own built-on directory, now’s the time to do that.
Similarly, if you plan to use a different database than the one WSE installs by
default, do that before building a ton of team spaces. Information on these
and other installation-related tasks are made available by IBM on the WSE
Infocenter, which is on IBM’s Web site at http://publib.boulder.ibm.
com/infocenter/wseic/v2r5/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.wse.
doc/wpf/cust_ovr.html.
Starting the WSE Server
Although the WSE Installation Wizard starts the WSE server automatically,
sometimes you need to do the same thing, manually. The server has to be up
and running before any of your team members can access it. Use these steps
to start WSE, manually:
1. Get thee to a command prompt.
341
Appendix E: Installing IBM Workplace Services Express

2. Switch to the directory where you installed WSE (as you promised to
remember back in installation Step 5).
3. Switch to the directory named PortalServer\rootscripts, which
is inside the directory you found in Step 2.
For example, the directory might be C:\Program Files\IBM\
WorkplaceServicesExpress\PortalServer\rootscripts\
subtasks.
4. Enter one of the following commands:
• If you use Windows, type startWorkplaceServices.bat.
• If you use Linux, type ./startWorkplaceServices.sh.
Watch for a message in the command prompt window that states that
the server has started successfully.
When you install WSE on Windows, it is automatically configured for you as a
Windows service.
Stopping the WSE Server Manually
Use these steps to stop WSE manually:
1. Get thee to a command prompt.
2. Switch to the directory where you installed WSE (as you promised to
remember back in installation Step 5).
3. Switch to the directory named PortalServer\rootscripts, which
is inside the directory you found in the previous step.
For example, the directory might be C:\Program Files\IBM\
WorkplaceServicesExpress\PortalServer\rootscripts\
subtasks.
4. Enter one of the following commands:
• If you use Windows, type stopWorkplaceServices.bat.
• If you use Linux, type ./stopWorkplaceServices.sh.
5. Watch for a message that states that the server has shut down.
You can start and stop the server without using the command prompt.
Simply traverse to the same C:\Program Files\IBM\Workplace
ServicesExpress\PortalServer\rootscripts\subtasks folder using
Windows Explorer, find the appropriate .bat or .sh file, and double-click it.
A command prompt window opens. After the server completes its latest
process, it shuts down.
